Rhodesia is coloured green and countries friendly to the government (South Africa and Portugal) are shown in purple.]]\n\n[[File:RhodesiaAllies1975.png|thumb|The geopolitical situation of Rhodesia after the independence of Angola and Mozambique in 1975. Rhodesia itself is shown in green, nations friendly to the nationalist guerrillas are shown in orange, and South Africa and its dependency South-West Africa (now Namibia) are coloured purple.]]\n\nThe independence of Mozambique and [[Angola]] in 1975 challenged white minority rule in Southern Africa. Firstly, the independence wars in Angola and Mozambique demonstrated that even with great military resources it was virtually impossible for a small white minority to guarantee the safety of its members, let alone to exert control over a mobilised and agitated population outside of major power centres. The downfall of Portuguese colonial rule gave hope to black liberation struggles in the then apartheid [[South Africa]] and [[Rhodesia]]. Second, in both countries revolutionary [[socialist]] movements gained power. These movements had been cooperating with the black liberation movements in South Africa and Rhodesia, and continued to openly support them, offering them a safe haven from where they could coordinate their operations and train new forces. As President Machel put it in a speech in 1975: \"The struggle in Zimbabwe is our struggle\".<ref name=\"jpires.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jpires.org/?p=1240 |title=MOZAMBIQUE: Dismantling the Portuguese Empire |publisher=jpires.org |accessdate=4 March 2012 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe independence of Mozambique was especially devastating for white-ruled Rhodesia in multiple aspects. The Rhodesian armed forces lacked the manpower to effectively protect its 800-mile border with Mozambique against entering ZANLA insurgents. At the same time, the apartheid government and the Smith regime lost Portugal as an ally and with it the tens of thousands of soldiers that had been deployed in the Portuguese colonial wars. Additionally Rhodesia used Mozambican ports as their primary means for imports and exports, with over 80% of all imports passing through Maputo and Beira into the heavily sanctioned country. The loss of these ports after President Machel declared sanctions against the country further weakened the already fragile economy of Rhodesia and angered the Ian Smith regime.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Mota Lopes and Mario Borgdeth, \"Borders of Blood\" Kanemo Production and Communication Ltd.</ref>\n\nThus with the South African and Rhodesian white minority government position severely weakened by the events of 1974/75 both governments sought to undermine the newly independent countries and to shatter FRELIMO's goal of building the first, non-racial socialist state in Southern Africa.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Bob and Amy Coen, \"Mozambique: The Struggle for Survival\" Video Africa, 1987</ref> The countries capacity to support national liberation movements also concerned South Africa and Rhodesia and both countries sought for a first strike strategy to counter this new threat. This manifested itself in the Rhodesia-sponsored foundation of [[RENAMO]], then called the Mozambique National Resistance (MNR), in 1974 and in South Africa's adoption of the \"[[Total National Strategy]]\".\n\n=== Internal Mozambican tensions ===\n\n==== FRELIMO dissidents ====\n\nSoon after independence, FRELIMO begun Mozambique's transformation into a socialist one-party-state. This was accompanied by crackdowns on dissidents and the nationalisation of important economic facilities abandoned by fleeing Portuguese.<ref name=\"jpires.org\"/> Numerous political parties sprung up virtually overnight and vied for power with FRELIMO. Many of these parties like [[COREMO]] and UNAR were made up of FRELIMO dissidents such as [[Uria Simango]] and Lazaro Nkavandame. Both men were arrested and convicted in a public trial before [[Samora Machel]] before being sent to re-education camps. Simango was reportedly later extrajudicially executed<ref>''Mozambique: the tortuous road to democracy'' by J. Cabrita, Macmillan, 2001. {{ISBN|9780333920015}}</ref> whilst Nkavandame reportedly died of natural causes.\n\nFurthermore, the nationalisation of many formerly Portuguese-owned enterprises, fear of a retaliation against whites, and an ultimatum to either accept Mozambican citizenship or leave the country within 90 days, drove the majority of the 370,000 [[Portuguese Mozambicans|white Portuguese Mozambicans]] out of the country. As the Portuguese left some purposefully sabotaged the economy, stealing profits from factories, driving tractors into the sea and pouring cement into sewers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The Portuguese exodus resulted in economic chaos as only few Africans had received higher education or even primary education under Portuguese rule with over 95% of the population illiterate.<ref>Mario Mouzinho ''Literacy in Mozambique: education for all challenges'' UNESCO, 2006</ref><ref name=\"jpires.org\"/>\n\n==== Overturning of traditional hierarchies and re-education camps ====\n\nAs a revolutionary Marxist party, FRELIMO embarked on overturning traditional, tribal governance structures that grew extensively under the Portuguese colonial rule in an effort to counter regionalism and tribalism to build a single, national identity. Shortly after independence many local chiefs were ousted and removed from positions of power and many dissidents were imprisoned in re-education camps.<ref>Igreja 2007, p.128.</ref> Another source of conflict was the continuation of the aldeamento system that the Portuguese had introduced as a means of exerting control and inhibiting contact between the population and the rebels. It coerced thousands of peasants to move into communal villages and communal farms where they were given food, water and healthcare, but lacked adequate tools and money to farm effectively. FRELIMO hoped that this system would enable the fulfilment of its ambitious agricultural development goals, but the implementation often alienated parts of the rural population, whom FRELIMO had popular support from during the independence struggle. This was especially the case in central and northern Mozambique, where households are traditionally separated by considerable distances.<ref>The cultural dimension of war traumas in central Mozambique: The case of Gorongosa. http://priory.com/psych/traumacult.htm</ref>\n\n== Course of the war ==\n\n=== Outbreak ===\n\nFrom 1975 to 1979, Rhodesian troops and forces repeatedly entered into Mozambique in order to carry out [[Rhodesian Bush War|operations against supposed ZANLA (Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army) bases]] tolerated on Mozambican territory by the FRELIMO government<ref>Lohman&MacPherson 1983, Chapter 4.</ref> and to destabilise the FRELIMO government directly. These included the bombing of the Beira Port in 1979 and the occupation of the town of Mapai in 1977.<ref>J. A. Kalley, E. Schoeman and L. E. Andoret, \"Southern African Political History: A chronology of key political events from Independence to mid-1997\" Greenwood, 1999</ref> During one such raid, Rhodesian forces freed FRELIMO ex-official [[Andr\u00e9 Matsangaissa]] from a re-education camp. He was given military and organisational training and installed as the leader of the fledgling movement known as the ''Mozambique Resistance'', which had been founded by the Rhodesian secret service before the independence of Mozambique in 1975 as an intelligence gathering group on FRELIMO and ZANLA. It was created in Salisbury, Rhodesia under the auspices of [[Ken Flower]], head of the Rhodesian CIO, and Orlando Cristina, a former anti-guerrilla operative for the Portuguese.<ref>Andersson 2016, p.52</ref><ref>Abrahamsson & Nilsson 1995, p.246</ref><ref>Lulat 2008, p.272</ref><ref>Weigert 1995, p.73</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> RENAMO subsequently started operating in the Gorongosa region in order to destabilise the FRELIMO government and its support for the ZANLA liberation movement. However, in 1979 Matsangaissa died in RENAMO's unsuccessful first attack on a major regional centre (Vila Paiva) and RENAMO was quickly ousted from the region. Subsequently, [[Afonso Dhlakama]] was installed as the new leader of RENAMO and with extensive South African support it quickly organised itself into an effective guerilla army.<ref>Igreja 2007 p.128ff</ref>\n\n=== RENAMO strategies and operations ===\n[[File:Afonso Dhlakama, 1993 in Maringue.jpg|thumb|[[Afonso Dhlakama]] (center), leader of [[RENAMO]] from 1979 ]]\n\nHaving fought the Portuguese using guerrilla strategies, FRELIMO was now forced to defend itself against the very same methods it employed against the colonial regime. It had to defend vast areas and hundreds of locations, while RENAMO operated out of a few remote camps, carrying out raids against towns and important infrastructure. Furthermore, RENAMO systematically forced civilians into its employment. This was done by mass abduction and intimidation, especially of children in order to use them as soldiers. It is estimated that one-third of RENAMO forces were child soldiers.<ref>^ {{cite web |url=http://newhistories.group.shef.ac.uk/wordpress/wordpress/?p=2867 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235024/http://newhistories.group.shef.ac.uk/wordpress/wordpress/?p=2867 |archivedate=30 December 2013}}</ref> But abducted people also had to serve RENAMO in administrative or public service functions in the areas it controlled. Another way of using civilians for military purposes was the so-called system of \"Gandira\". This system especially affected the rural population in areas controlled by RENAMO, forcing them to fulfill three main tasks: 1) produce food for RENAMO, 2) transport goods and ammunition, 3) in the case of women, serve as sex slaves.<ref>Igreja 2007, p.153f.</ref> Despite RENAMO'S alleged goals of freeing Mozambique from 'Machelist Communism'<ref>\"Mozambique Dissidents' Military Communiqu\u00e9\" Summary of World Broadcasts, 15 July 1980</ref> RENAMO never established a political program that proposed an alternative to FRELIMO, nor anyone in the role of a political leader throughout the war.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBoth sides heavily relied on the use of land mines; FRELIMO as a means to defend important infrastructure, RENAMO in order to terrify the populace, stall the economy and destroy the civil services, roads, schools and health centres.\n\nThus, despite its far superior numbers, FRELIMO was unable to adequately defend most regions except the most important cities by the mid-1980s. RENAMO was able to carry out raids virtually anywhere in the country except for the major cities. Transportation had become a perilous business. Even armed convoys were not safe from RENAMO attacks and were frequently attacked.<ref>^ {{cite web |url=http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/mozambique/key-actors.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229195859/http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/mozambique/key-actors.php |archivedate=29 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== FRELIMO strategies and operations ===\n\nFRELIMO reacted by reusing a system similar to the fortified villages ''aldeamentos'' introduced by the Portuguese: the creation of fortified communal villages called ''aldeamentos comunais'' where much of the rural population was relocated as the war intensified. Furthermore, in order to keep a minimum level of infrastructure working, three heavily guarded and mined corridors were established consisting of roads, railways and power lines: the Beira, the Tete (also called the Tete Run which speaks for itself regarding its safety) and the Limpopo Corridor.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web |url=http://ccrweb.ccr.uct.ac.za/archive/defencedigest/defdigest03.html#1 |title=Defence Digest - Working Paper 3 |publisher=Ccrweb.ccr.uct.ac.za |accessdate=4 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205234951/http://ccrweb.ccr.uct.ac.za/archive/defencedigest/defdigest03.html#1 |archivedate=5 February 2012}}</ref> Despite extensive fortification along these corridors they were frequently subject to attacks, bombings of the railway line and locomotives along the Beira Corridor cost the FRELIMO government millions as it struggled to provide adequate food and services and put strains on its ally [[Zimbabwe]].\n\n=== Foreign support and intervention ===\n\nFRELIMO initially received substantial military and development aid from the Soviet Union and East Germany but later received support from France, the UK and the U.S. In the U.S., conservative circles lobbied for the U.S Government to provide open support to RENAMO but were opposed by the State Department, which finally gained the upper hand following the publication of numerous, detailed reports which documented RENAMO's brutality. RENAMO received extensive military and logistical support from Rhodesia and South Africa as well as organisational support from West Germany.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nIn 1982, landlocked Zimbabwe directly intervened in the civil war in order to secure its vital transport routes in Mozambique, stop cross-border RENAMO raids, and help its old ally FRELIMO. Zimbabwe's help became crucial to the defence of the corridors, particularly the important Beira corridor. Later Zimbabwe became engaged further, carrying out several joint operations with FRELIMO against RENAMO strongholds.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/> Thus RENAMO had to give up its base camps in the Gorongosa area. [[Tanzania]] also sent troops to back FRELIMO. [[North Korea]], the [[German Democratic Republic]] and the [[Soviet Union]] also armed and trained FRELIMO forces, with the North Koreans establishing a Military Mission in Mozambique during the early 1980s<ref name=DPRK/> North Korean advisers were instrumental in the formation of FRELIMO's first specialized counter-insurgency brigade, which was deployed from 1983 onward.<ref name=DPRK/> and the GDR providing military assistance and training members of the Mozambican [[FPLM]] in the GDR.<ref>Klaus Storkmann, \"Fighting the Cold War in southern Africa? East German military support to FRELIMO\"  Portuguese Journal of Social Science, 2010</ref>\n\nMalawi had a complicated relationship with both FRELIMO and RENAMO.<ref name=Arnold/> During the mid-1980s, FRELIMO repeatedly accused Malawian president [[Hastings Banda]] of providing sanctuary for RENAMO insurgents.<ref name=Arnold/> Mozambican security forces occasionally carried out raids into Malawi to strike at suspected RENAMO base camps in that country, a practice which brought them into direct confrontation with the [[Malawian Defence Force]].<ref name=Arnold/> In 1986, Malawi bowed to Mozambican pressure and expelled 12,000 RENAMO insurgents.<ref name=Arnold/> Banda explicitly turned against RENAMO after the disgruntled insurgents began targeting a vital rail line which linked Blantyre to Mozambican ports on the [[Indian Ocean]] coast.<ref name=Arnold/> Beginning in April 1987 the Malawian government deployed troops into Mozambique to defend the rail line, where they were involved in a number of engagements with RENAMO.<ref name=Arnold/>\n\nAfter 1980, South Africa became RENAMO's main supporter. The FRELIMO government, led by President Machel, was economically devastated by the war and sought to end the conflict and continue the development of Mozambique. Even the military and diplomatic support with the [[socialist bloc]] could not alleviate the nation's economic misery and famine as a result of the war. After negotiations, a reluctant Machel signed a non-aggression pact with South Africa, known as the [[Nkomati Accord]]. In return, [[Pretoria]] promised to stop assistance to the MNR in exchange for FRELIMO's commitment to prevent the ANC from using Mozambique as a sanctuary to pursue its campaign to overthrow white minority rule in South Africa. Following a May 1983 car bombing in Pretoria, the South Africans bombed the capital, declaring they had killed 41 'ANC Terrorists' while in actuality killing three workers at a jam factory in Maputo.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Joseph Hanlon, \"Beggar Your Neighbours: Apartheid Power in Southern Africa, 1986</ref> With the economy in shambles, Machel was forced to scale back some of the more ambitious socialist policies; in a visit to Western Europe that same month, Machel signed military and economic agreements with Portugal, France, and the UK. Collective and state agricultural programs were also scaled back, prompting concerns from the [[socialist bloc]] that Mozambique was \"moving straight and naively into the mouth of the evil capitalist wolf\".<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Paul Fauvet, \"Carlos Cardoso: Telling the Truth in Mozambique\" Double Storey Books, 2003</ref> The volume of direct South African government support for RENAMO diminished slightly after Nkomati Accord, but documents discovered during the capture of RENAMO headquarters at Gorongosa in central Mozambique in August 1985 revealed that the South African Army had continued and extended its already extensive logistical, communication and military support for RENAMO. FRELIMO, meanwhile, fully honoured its side of the deal to expel violent ANC members from its territory and to downgrade the ANC's presence in the south of the country.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n=== Military stalemate ===\n\nBy the end of the 1980s RENAMO, whilst incapable of capturing or securing any large cities, was still able to terrorise the rural areas and smaller settlements at will. FRELIMO retained control of the urban areas and the corridors, but was unable to effectively protect the countryside from RENAMO attacks. FRELIMO was also unable to pin down RENAMO and force it into a direct full-scale confrontation.\n\nOn 19 October 1986, President Machel died when his presidential aircraft [[1986 Mozambican Tupolev Tu-134 crash|crashed]] near South Africa's border under mysterious circumstances. A South African sponsored investigation alleged that the crash was caused by errors made by the flight crew, a conclusion that was not universally accepted. Subsequent investigations have failed to reach a conclusion and the accident remains surrounded by conspiracy theories. Machel's successor was [[Joaquim Chissano|Joaquim Alberto Chissano]], who had served as foreign minister from 1975 until Machel's death. Chissano continued Machel's policies of expanding Mozambique's international ties, particularly the country's links with the West, and starting programs of internal economic and military reforms.\n\nDuring the war, hundreds of thousands of people died from famine, particularly the devastating famine of 1984.<ref name=\"Zinsmeister, Karl 1988 p. 88, 28\">Zinsmeister, Karl. \"All the Hungry People.\" REASON 20 (June 1988): 22-30. p. 88, 28</ref><ref name=\"Andersson, Hilary 1992. p. 64, 92\">Andersson, Hilary.

This is due to the unconditional general amnesty law for the period from 1976 to 1992 passed by the parliament (then still composed entirely of FRELIMO members) in 1992. Instead of receiving justice, victims were often urged to forget.<ref>Igreja 1988, p.20-22.</ref>{{Better source|date=December 2018}}\n\n=== RENAMO ===\n\nRENAMO systematically committed war crimes and crimes against humanity as part of its destabilization strategy. These include mass killing, rape and mutilation of non-combatants during terroristic raids on villages and towns, the use of child soldiers and the employment of the Gandira system, based upon forced labour and sexual violence. Often women would be apprehended while out in the fields, then raped as a means to boost troop morale. Gandira caused widespread starvation among the rural population due to the little time left to produce food for themselves. This caused more and more persons to be physically unable to endure the long transportation marches demanded from them. Refusing to participate in Gandira or falling behind on the marches resulted in severe beating and often execution.<ref>Gersony 1988, pp. 20-22</ref> Flight attempts were also punished harshly. One particularly gruesome practice was the mutilation and killing of children left behind by escaped parents.<ref>Gersony 1988, p.24-27</ref><ref>Gersony 1988, p. 32</ref> RENAMO's brutal tactics quickly earned it a searing resentment and hate among most Mozambicans who referred to them as \"Armed Bandits\" and endorsed beatings against them, even pressuring the military into a public execution of four RENAMO rebels in 1983.<ref>\"Pena de morte exigida para bandidos armados\", Noticias, 1983</ref>\n\nRENAMO crimes gained worldwide public attention when RENAMO soldiers butchered 424 civilians, including the patients of a hospital, with guns and machetes during a raid on the rural town of Homoine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mozambiquehistory.net/homoine.html |title=MHN: Homoine, 1987 |publisher=Mozambiquehistory.net |accessdate=4 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307230039/http://www.mozambiquehistory.net/homoine.html |archivedate=7 March 2012}}</ref> This incident prompted an investigation into RENAMO methods by US-State Department consultant Robert Gersony, which finally put an end to conservative ambitions for US-government support for RENAMO.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-alperinsheriff/mccain-urged-reagan-admin_b_135431.html |title=Jacob Alperin-Sheriff: McCain Urged Reagan Admin To Meet Terror Groups Without Pre-Conditions |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=4 March 2012}}</ref> The report concluded that RENAMO's actions in Homoine did not significantly differ from the tactics it normally employed in such raids. These methods are described in the report in the following way:<blockquote>The attack stage was sometimes reported to begin with what appeared to the inhabitants to be the indiscriminate firing of automatic weapons by a substantial force of attacking RENAMO combatants. [\u2026] Reportedly the Government soldiers aim their defensive fire at the attackers, while the RENAMO forces shoot indiscriminately into the village. In some cases refugees perceived that the attacking force had divided into three detachments: one conducts the military attack; another enters houses and removes valuables, mainly clothing, radios, food, pots and other possessions; a third moves through the looted houses with pieces of burning thatch setting fire to the houses in the village. There were several reports that schools and health clinics are typical targets for destruction. The destruction of the village as a viable entity appears to be the main objective of such attacks. This type of attack causes several types of civilian casualties. As is normal in guerrilla warfare, some civilians are killed in crossfire between the two opposing forces, although this tends in the view of the refugees to account for only a minority of the deaths. A larger number of civilians in these attacks and other contexts were reported to be victims of purposeful shooting deaths and executions, of axing, knifing, bayoneting, burning to death, forced drowning and asphyxiation, and other forms of murder where no meaningful resistance or defense is present. Eyewitness accounts indicate that when civilians are killed in these indiscriminate attacks, whether against defended or undefended villages, children, often together with mothers and elderly people, are also killed. Varying numbers of civilian victims in each attack were reported to be rounded up and abducted [...].<ref>Gersony 1988, p. 30f.</ref></blockquote>Thus it appears the only difference between the Homoine massacre and RENAMO's usual methods was the size of the operation. Normally RENAMO would choose smaller, easier targets instead of attacking a town defended by some 90 government soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-24/news/mn-3651_1_renamo |title=Toll Over 380; Guerrillas Blamed : Massacre in Mozambique: Babies, Elderly Shot Down|website=Los Angeles Times|date=16 August 1987}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Gersony Report, RENAMO's transgressions were far more systematic, widespread and grave than FRELIMO's: the refugees interviewed for the Gersony Report attributed 94% of the murders, 94% of the abductions and 93% of the lootings to RENAMO.<ref>Gersony 1988, p.34-36.</ref> However, this conclusion has been disputed by the French Marxist scholar Michel Cahen, who states that both sides were equally to blame:<blockquote>There can be no doubt that the war was largely one fought against civilians... I am also convinced that the war was equally savage on both sides, even if the total domination of the media by FRELIMO for the 15 years of the war has led even those most desirous of remaining objective to attribute the majority of the atrocities to RENAMO. The people themselves were not duped: they attributed various acts of banditry and certain massacres to \"RENAMO 1,\" but others to \"RENAMO 2\" \u2013 the euphemistic term for FRELIMO soldiers and militiamen acting on their own.<ref>Cahen 1998, p. 13.</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== FRELIMO ===\n\nFRELIMO soldiers also committed serious war crimes during the civil war.<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1990/WR90/AFRICA.BOU-07.htm#P403_90345 Mozambique] HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH WORLD REPORT 1990</ref> FRELIMO forced people into its employment and conscription periods often extended beyond what the law allowed. Living in the communal villages became mandatory in certain provinces. However, in some areas, cultural norms required households to live at some distance apart from each other.  Therefore, many people preferred living in the countryside despite the risk of RENAMO assaults and raids.<ref name=\"priory1\">{{cite web|url=http://priory.com/psych/traumacult.htm |title=War Traumas in Central Mozambique |publisher=Priory.com |date=10 February 2007 |accessdate=4 March 2012}}</ref> Thus people would often be forced into the communal villages at gunpoint by FAM-soldiers or their Zimbabwean allies. As a local recalls:<blockquote>I never wanted to leave my old residence and come to the communal village. Even with the war, I wanted to stay where I had my land and granaries. Ever since a long time ago, we never lived with so many people together in the same place. Everyone must live in his own yard. The Komeredes [Zimbabwean soldiers] came to my house and said that I should leave my house and go to the communal village where there were a lot of people. I tried to refuse and then they set fire to my house, my granaries, and my fields. They threatened me with death and they told me and my family to go forward. Inside the communal village we lived like pigs. It was like a yard for pigs. We were so many people living close to each other. If someone slept with his wife everyone could listen to what they were doing. When we went to the fields or to the cemeteries to bury the dead, the soldiers had to come behind and in front of us. When the women went to the river to wash themselves, the soldiers had to go too and they usually saw our women naked. Everything was a complete shame inside that corral. Usually to eat, we had to depend on humanitarian aid, but we never knew when it would arrive. It was terrible; that is why many people used to run away from the communal village to their old residences where RENAMO soldiers were, although it was also terrible there.<ref name=\"priory1\" /></blockquote>Rape also became a widespread and problematic practise of FRELIMO soldiers. However, it was far less frequent and lacked the institutionalised quality of sexual violence carried out by RENAMO.<ref>Igreja 2007, p. 150.</ref>\n\nAs part of a series of measures following independence, FRELIMO introduced \"reeducation camps\" to which petty criminals, political opponents, and alleged anti-social elements such as prostitutes were sent, oftentimes without trial due to a lack of judges. Despite these accusations President Machel made numerous visits to various camps and released about 2,000 detainees in 1980 and closed numerous camps due to human rights abuses.<ref>Jay Ross, \"Mozambican Reeducation Camps Raise Rights Questions\", ''The Washington Post'' (United States of America), 7 May 1980</ref><ref>\"Machel's Speech on Unjust Detentions in Reeducation Camps\" Summary of World Broadcasts, 6 October 1981</ref> The government was also accused of executing thousands of people while trying to extend its control throughout the country.<ref>Hoile, David.

FRELIMO's new draft constitution in July 1989 paved the way for a multiparty system, and a new constitution was adopted in November 1990. Mozambique was now a multiparty state, with periodic elections, and guaranteed democratic rights.\n\nOn 4 October 1992, the [[Rome General Peace Accords]], negotiated by the [[Community of Sant'Egidio]] with the support of the [[United Nations]], were signed in [[Rome]] between President Chissano and RENAMO leader Afonso Dhlakama, which formally took effect on 15 October 1992. A UN peacekeeping force ([[UNOMOZ]]) of 7,500 arrived in Mozambique and oversaw a two-year transition to democracy. 2,400 international observers also entered the country to supervise the elections held on 27\u201328 October 1994. The last UNOMOZ contingents departed in early 1995. By then out of a total population of 13-15 million at the time, the Mozambican civil war had caused about one million deaths, displaced 5.7 million internally and resulted with 1.7 million refugees.<ref name=\"state1\"/><ref name=\"populstat1\"/><ref name=\"unhcr.org\">''[https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/publications/sowr/4a4c754a9/state-worlds-refugees-2000-fifty-years-humanitarian-action.html State of the World's Refugees, 2000]'' United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</ref>\n\n=== Landmines ===\n[[HALO Trust]], a de-mining group funded by the US and UK, began operating in Mozambique in 1993, recruiting local workers to remove land mines scattered throughout the country. Four HALO workers were killed in the subsequent effort to rid Mozambique of land mines, which continued to cause as many as several hundred civilian injuries and fatalities annually for years after the war. In September 2015, the country was finally declared to be free of land mines, with the last known device intentionally detonated as part of a ceremony.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/17/last-known-landmine-mozambique-destroyed?CMP=share_btn_tw|title=Flash and a bang as Mozambique is declared free of landmines|date=17 September 2015|accessdate=17 September 2015|work=The Guardian|first=David|last=Smith}}</ref>\n\n===Resurgence of violence since 2013===\n{{main|RENAMO insurgency (2013\u20132019)}}\nIn mid-2013, after more than twenty years of peace, the RENAMO insurgency was renewed, mainly in the central and northern regions of the country. On 5 September 2014, former president [[Armando Guebuza]] and the leader of RENAMO Afonso Dhlakama signed the Accord on Cessation of Hostilities, which brought the military hostilities to a halt and allowed both parties to concentrate on the general elections to be held in October 2014. Yet, following the general elections, a new political crisis emerged and the country appears to be once again on the brink of violent conflict. RENAMO does not recognise the validity of the election results, and demands the control of six provinces \u2013 Nampula, Niassa, Tete, Zambezia, Sofala, and Manica \u2013 where they claim to have won a majority.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/19787524 | title=Provincial Autonomy: The Territorial Dimension of Peace in Mozambique | first=Nat\u00e1lia | last=Bueno | publisher=Academia | accessdate=20 February 2019 }}</ref>\n\nOn 20 January 2016, the Secretary General of RENAMO, Manuel Bissopo, was injured in a shootout, where his bodyguard died. However, a joint commission for the political dialogue between the President of the Republic, Filipe Nyusi, and RENAMO leader, Afonso Dhlakama, was eventually set up and a working meeting was held.

Rhodesia itself is shown in green, nations friendly to the nationalist guerrillas are shown in orange, and South Africa and its dependency South-West Africa (now Namibia) are coloured purple.]]\n\nThe independence of Mozambique and [[Angola]] in 1975 challenged white minority rule in Southern Africa. Firstly, the independence wars in Angola and Mozambique demonstrated that even with great military resources it was virtually impossible for a small white minority to guarantee the safety of its members, let alone to exert control over a mobilised and agitated population outside of major power centres. The downfall of Portuguese colonial rule gave hope to black liberation struggles in the then apartheid [[South Africa]] and [[Rhodesia]]. Second, in both countries revolutionary [[socialist]] movements gained power. These movements had been cooperating with the black liberation movements in South Africa and Rhodesia, and continued to openly support them, offering them a safe haven from where they could coordinate their operations and train new forces. As President Machel put it in a speech in 1975: \"The struggle in Zimbabwe is our struggle\".<ref name=\"jpires.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jpires.org/?p=1240 |title=MOZAMBIQUE: Dismantling the Portuguese Empire |publisher=jpires.org |accessdate=4 March 2012 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe independence of Mozambique was especially devastating for white-ruled Rhodesia in multiple aspects. The Rhodesian armed forces lacked the manpower to effectively protect its 800-mile border with Mozambique against entering ZANLA insurgents. At the same time, the apartheid government and the Smith regime lost Portugal as an ally and with it the tens of thousands of soldiers that had been deployed in the Portuguese colonial wars. Additionally Rhodesia used Mozambican ports as their primary means for imports and exports, with over 80% of all imports passing through Maputo and Beira into the heavily sanctioned country. The loss of these ports after President Machel declared sanctions against the country further weakened the already fragile economy of Rhodesia and angered the Ian Smith regime.<ref>Jos\u00e9 Mota Lopes and Mario Borgdeth, \"Borders of Blood\" Kanemo Production and Communication Ltd.</ref>\n\nThus with the South African and Rhodesian white minority government position severely weakened by the events of 1974/75 both governments sought to undermine the newly independent countries and to shatter FRELIMO's goal of building the first, non-racial socialist state in Southern Africa.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Bob and Amy Coen, \"Mozambique: The Struggle for Survival\" Video Africa, 1987</ref> The countries capacity to support national liberation movements also concerned South Africa and Rhodesia and both countries sought for a first strike strategy to counter this new threat. This manifested itself in the Rhodesia-sponsored foundation of [[RENAMO]], then called the Mozambique National Resistance (MNR), in 1974 and in South Africa's adoption of the \"[[Total National Strategy]]\".\n\n=== Internal Mozambican tensions ===\n\n==== FRELIMO dissidents ====\n\nSoon after independence, FRELIMO begun Mozambique's transformation into a socialist one-party-state. This was accompanied by crackdowns on dissidents and the nationalisation of important economic facilities abandoned by fleeing Portuguese.<ref name=\"jpires.org\"/> Numerous political parties sprung up virtually overnight and vied for power with FRELIMO. Many of these parties like [[COREMO]] and UNAR were made up of FRELIMO dissidents such as [[Uria Simango]] and Lazaro Nkavandame. Both men were arrested and convicted in a public trial before [[Samora Machel]] before being sent to re-education camps. Simango was reportedly later extrajudicially executed<ref>''Mozambique: the tortuous road to democracy'' by J. Cabrita, Macmillan, 2001. {{ISBN|9780333920015}}</ref> whilst Nkavandame reportedly died of natural causes.\n\nFurthermore, the nationalisation of many formerly Portuguese-owned enterprises, fear of a retaliation against whites, and an ultimatum to either accept Mozambican citizenship or leave the country within 90 days, drove the majority of the 370,000 [[Portuguese Mozambicans|white Portuguese Mozambicans]] out of the country. As the Portuguese left some purposefully sabotaged the economy, stealing profits from factories, driving tractors into the sea and pouring cement into sewers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The Portuguese exodus resulted in economic chaos as only few Africans had received higher education or even primary education under Portuguese rule with over 95% of the population illiterate.<ref>Mario Mouzinho ''Literacy in Mozambique: education for all challenges'' UNESCO, 2006</ref><ref name=\"jpires.org\"/>\n\n==== Overturning of traditional hierarchies and re-education camps ====\n\nAs a revolutionary Marxist party, FRELIMO embarked on overturning traditional, tribal governance structures that grew extensively under the Portuguese colonial rule in an effort to counter regionalism and tribalism to build a single, national identity. Shortly after independence many local chiefs were ousted and removed from positions of power and many dissidents were imprisoned in re-education camps.<ref>Igreja 2007, p.128.</ref> Another source of conflict was the continuation of the aldeamento system that the Portuguese had introduced as a means of exerting control and inhibiting contact between the population and the rebels. It coerced thousands of peasants to move into communal villages and communal farms where they were given food, water and healthcare, but lacked adequate tools and money to farm effectively. FRELIMO hoped that this system would enable the fulfilment of its ambitious agricultural development goals, but the implementation often alienated parts of the rural population, whom FRELIMO had popular support from during the independence struggle. This was especially the case in central and northern Mozambique, where households are traditionally separated by considerable distances.<ref>The cultural dimension of war traumas in central Mozambique: The case of Gorongosa. http://priory.com/psych/traumacult.htm</ref>\n\n== Course of the war ==\n\n=== Outbreak ===\n\nFrom 1975 to 1979, Rhodesian troops and forces repeatedly entered into Mozambique in order to carry out [[Rhodesian Bush War|operations against supposed ZANLA (Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army) bases]] tolerated on Mozambican territory by the FRELIMO government<ref>Lohman&MacPherson 1983, Chapter 4.</ref> and to destabilise the FRELIMO government directly. These included the bombing of the Beira Port in 1979 and the occupation of the town of Mapai in 1977.<ref>J. A. Kalley, E. Schoeman and L. E. Andoret, \"Southern African Political History: A chronology of key political events from Independence to mid-1997\" Greenwood, 1999</ref> During one such raid, Rhodesian forces freed FRELIMO ex-official [[Andr\u00e9 Matsangaissa]] from a re-education camp. He was given military and organisational training and installed as the leader of the fledgling movement known as the ''Mozambique Resistance'', which had been founded by the Rhodesian secret service before the independence of Mozambique in 1975 as an intelligence gathering group on FRELIMO and ZANLA. It was created in Salisbury, Rhodesia under the auspices of [[Ken Flower]], head of the Rhodesian CIO, and Orlando Cristina, a former anti-guerrilla operative for the Portuguese.<ref>Andersson 2016, p.52</ref><ref>Abrahamsson & Nilsson 1995, p.246</ref><ref>Lulat 2008, p.272</ref><ref>Weigert 1995, p.73</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> RENAMO subsequently started operating in the Gorongosa region in order to destabilise the FRELIMO government and its support for the ZANLA liberation movement. However, in 1979 Matsangaissa died in RENAMO's unsuccessful first attack on a major regional centre (Vila Paiva) and RENAMO was quickly ousted from the region. Subsequently, [[Afonso Dhlakama]] was installed as the new leader of RENAMO and with extensive South African support it quickly organised itself into an effective guerilla army.<ref>Igreja 2007 p.128ff</ref>\n\n=== RENAMO strategies and operations ===\n[[File:Afonso Dhlakama, 1993 in Maringue.jpg|thumb|[[Afonso Dhlakama]] (center), leader of [[RENAMO]] from 1979 ]]\n\nHaving fought the Portuguese using guerrilla strategies, FRELIMO was now forced to defend itself against the very same methods it employed against the colonial regime. It had to defend vast areas and hundreds of locations, while RENAMO operated out of a few remote camps, carrying out raids against towns and important infrastructure. Furthermore, RENAMO systematically forced civilians into its employment. This was done by mass abduction and intimidation, especially of children in order to use them as soldiers. It is estimated that one-third of RENAMO forces were child soldiers.<ref>^ {{cite web |url=http://newhistories.group.shef.ac.uk/wordpress/wordpress/?p=2867 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235024/http://newhistories.group.shef.ac.uk/wordpress/wordpress/?p=2867 |archivedate=30 December 2013}}</ref> But abducted people also had to serve RENAMO in administrative or public service functions in the areas it controlled. Another way of using civilians for military purposes was the so-called system of \"Gandira\". This system especially affected the rural population in areas controlled by RENAMO, forcing them to fulfill three main tasks: 1) produce food for RENAMO, 2) transport goods and ammunition, 3) in the case of women, serve as sex slaves.<ref>Igreja 2007, p.153f.</ref> Despite RENAMO'S alleged goals of freeing Mozambique from 'Machelist Communism'<ref>\"Mozambique Dissidents' Military Communiqu\u00e9\" Summary of World Broadcasts, 15 July 1980</ref> RENAMO never established a political program that proposed an alternative to FRELIMO, nor anyone in the role of a political leader throughout the war.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nBoth sides heavily relied on the use of land mines; FRELIMO as a means to defend important infrastructure, RENAMO in order to terrify the populace, stall the economy and destroy the civil services, roads, schools and health centres.\n\nThus, despite its far superior numbers, FRELIMO was unable to adequately defend most regions except the most important cities by the mid-1980s. RENAMO was able to carry out raids virtually anywhere in the country except for the major cities. Transportation had become a perilous business. Even armed convoys were not safe from RENAMO attacks and were frequently attacked.<ref>^ {{cite web |url=http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/mozambique/key-actors.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229195859/http://www.c-r.org/our-work/accord/mozambique/key-actors.php |archivedate=29 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== FRELIMO strategies and operations ===\n\nFRELIMO reacted by reusing a system similar to the fortified villages ''aldeamentos'' introduced by the Portuguese: the creation of fortified communal villages called ''aldeamentos comunais'' where much of the rural population was relocated as the war intensified. Furthermore, in order to keep a minimum level of infrastructure working, three heavily guarded and mined corridors were established consisting of roads, railways and power lines: the Beira, the Tete (also called the Tete Run which speaks for itself regarding its safety) and the Limpopo Corridor.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web |url=http://ccrweb.ccr.uct.ac.za/archive/defencedigest/defdigest03.html#1 |title=Defence Digest - Working Paper 3 |publisher=Ccrweb.ccr.uct.ac.za |accessdate=4 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205234951/http://ccrweb.ccr.uct.ac.za/archive/defencedigest/defdigest03.html#1 |archivedate=5 February 2012}}</ref> Despite extensive fortification along these corridors they were frequently subject to attacks, bombings of the railway line and locomotives along the Beira Corridor cost the FRELIMO government millions as it struggled to provide adequate food and services and put strains on its ally [[Zimbabwe]].\n\n=== Foreign support and intervention ===\n\nFRELIMO initially received substantial military and development aid from the Soviet Union and East Germany but later received support from France, the UK and the U.S. In the U.S., conservative circles lobbied for the U.S Government to provide open support to RENAMO but were opposed by the State Department, which finally gained the upper hand following the publication of numerous, detailed reports which documented RENAMO's brutality. RENAMO received extensive military and logistical support from Rhodesia and South Africa as well as organisational support from West Germany.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nIn 1982, landlocked Zimbabwe directly intervened in the civil war in order to secure its vital transport routes in Mozambique, stop cross-border RENAMO raids, and help its old ally FRELIMO. Zimbabwe's help became crucial to the defence of the corridors, particularly the important Beira corridor. Later Zimbabwe became engaged further, carrying out several joint operations with FRELIMO against RENAMO strongholds.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/> Thus RENAMO had to give up its base camps in the Gorongosa area. [[Tanzania]] also sent troops to back FRELIMO. [[North Korea]], the [[German Democratic Republic]] and the [[Soviet Union]] also armed and trained FRELIMO forces, with the North Koreans establishing a Military Mission in Mozambique during the early 1980s<ref name=DPRK/> North Korean advisers were instrumental in the formation of FRELIMO's first specialized counter-insurgency brigade, which was deployed from 1983 onward.<ref name=DPRK/> and the GDR providing military assistance and training members of the Mozambican [[FPLM]] in the GDR.<ref>Klaus Storkmann, \"Fighting the Cold War in southern Africa? East German military support to FRELIMO\"  Portuguese Journal of Social Science, 2010</ref>\n\nMalawi had a complicated relationship with both FRELIMO and RENAMO.<ref name=Arnold/> During the mid-1980s, FRELIMO repeatedly accused Malawian president [[Hastings Banda]] of providing sanctuary for RENAMO insurgents.<ref name=Arnold/> Mozambican security forces occasionally carried out raids into Malawi to strike at suspected RENAMO base camps in that country, a practice which brought them into direct confrontation with the [[Malawian Defence Force]].<ref name=Arnold/> In 1986, Malawi bowed to Mozambican pressure and expelled 12,000 RENAMO insurgents.<ref name=Arnold/> Banda explicitly turned against RENAMO after the disgruntled insurgents began targeting a vital rail line which linked Blantyre to Mozambican ports on the [[Indian Ocean]] coast.<ref name=Arnold/> Beginning in April 1987 the Malawian government deployed troops into Mozambique to defend the rail line, where they were involved in a number of engagements with RENAMO.<ref name=Arnold/>\n\nAfter 1980, South Africa became RENAMO's main supporter. The FRELIMO government, led by President Machel, was economically devastated by the war and sought to end the conflict and continue the development of Mozambique. Even the military and diplomatic support with the [[socialist bloc]] could not alleviate the nation's economic misery and famine as a result of the war. After negotiations, a reluctant Machel signed a non-aggression pact with South Africa, known as the [[Nkomati Accord]]. In return, [[Pretoria]] promised to stop assistance to the MNR in exchange for FRELIMO's commitment to prevent the ANC from using Mozambique as a sanctuary to pursue its campaign to overthrow white minority rule in South Africa. Following a May 1983 car bombing in Pretoria, the South Africans bombed the capital, declaring they had killed 41 'ANC Terrorists' while in actuality killing three workers at a jam factory in Maputo.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Joseph Hanlon, \"Beggar Your Neighbours: Apartheid Power in Southern Africa, 1986</ref> With the economy in shambles, Machel was forced to scale back some of the more ambitious socialist policies; in a visit to Western Europe that same month, Machel signed military and economic agreements with Portugal, France, and the UK. Collective and state agricultural programs were also scaled back, prompting concerns from the [[socialist bloc]] that Mozambique was \"moving straight and naively into the mouth of the evil capitalist wolf\".<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Paul Fauvet, \"Carlos Cardoso: Telling the Truth in Mozambique\" Double Storey Books, 2003</ref> The volume of direct South African government support for RENAMO diminished slightly after Nkomati Accord, but documents discovered during the capture of RENAMO headquarters at Gorongosa in central Mozambique in August 1985 revealed that the South African Army had continued and extended its already extensive logistical, communication and military support for RENAMO. FRELIMO, meanwhile, fully honoured its side of the deal to expel violent ANC members from its territory and to downgrade the ANC's presence in the south of the country.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n=== Military stalemate ===\n\nBy the end of the 1980s RENAMO, whilst incapable of capturing or securing any large cities, was still able to terrorise the rural areas and smaller settlements at will. FRELIMO retained control of the urban areas and the corridors, but was unable to effectively protect the countryside from RENAMO attacks. FRELIMO was also unable to pin down RENAMO and force it into a direct full-scale confrontation.\n\nOn 19 October 1986, President Machel died when his presidential aircraft [[1986 Mozambican Tupolev Tu-134 crash|crashed]] near South Africa's border under mysterious circumstances. A South African sponsored investigation alleged that the crash was caused by errors made by the flight crew, a conclusion that was not universally accepted. Subsequent investigations have failed to reach a conclusion and the accident remains surrounded by conspiracy theories. Machel's successor was [[Joaquim Chissano|Joaquim Alberto Chissano]], who had served as foreign minister from 1975 until Machel's death. Chissano continued Machel's policies of expanding Mozambique's international ties, particularly the country's links with the West, and starting programs of internal economic and military reforms.\n\nDuring the war, hundreds of thousands of people died from famine, particularly the devastating famine of 1984.<ref name=\"Zinsmeister, Karl 1988 p. 88, 28\">Zinsmeister, Karl. \"All the Hungry People.\" REASON 20 (June 1988): 22-30. p. 88, 28</ref><ref name=\"Andersson, Hilary 1992. p. 64, 92\">Andersson, Hilary.

This is due to the unconditional general amnesty law for the period from 1976 to 1992 passed by the parliament (then still composed entirely of FRELIMO members) in 1992. Instead of receiving justice, victims were often urged to forget.<ref>Igreja 1988, p.20-22.</ref>{{Better source|date=December 2018}}\n\n=== RENAMO ===\n\nRENAMO systematically committed war crimes and crimes against humanity as part of its destabilization strategy. These include mass killing, rape and mutilation of non-combatants during terroristic raids on villages and towns, the use of child soldiers and the employment of the Gandira system, based upon forced labour and sexual violence. Often women would be apprehended while out in the fields, then raped as a means to boost troop morale. Gandira caused widespread starvation among the rural population due to the little time left to produce food for themselves. This caused more and more persons to be physically unable to endure the long transportation marches demanded from them. Refusing to participate in Gandira or falling behind on the marches resulted in severe beating and often execution.<ref>Gersony 1988, pp. 20-22</ref> Flight attempts were also punished harshly. One particularly gruesome practice was the mutilation and killing of children left behind by escaped parents.<ref>Gersony 1988, p.24-27</ref><ref>Gersony 1988, p. 32</ref> RENAMO's brutal tactics quickly earned it a searing resentment and hate among most Mozambicans who referred to them as \"Armed Bandits\" and endorsed beatings against them, even pressuring the military into a public execution of four RENAMO rebels in 1983.<ref>\"Pena de morte exigida para bandidos armados\", Noticias, 1983</ref>\n\nRENAMO crimes gained worldwide public attention when RENAMO soldiers butchered 424 civilians, including the patients of a hospital, with guns and machetes during a raid on the rural town of Homoine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mozambiquehistory.net/homoine.html |title=MHN: Homoine, 1987 |publisher=Mozambiquehistory.net |accessdate=4 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307230039/http://www.mozambiquehistory.net/homoine.html |archivedate=7 March 2012}}</ref> This incident prompted an investigation into RENAMO methods by US-State Department consultant Robert Gersony, which finally put an end to conservative ambitions for US-government support for RENAMO.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-alperinsheriff/mccain-urged-reagan-admin_b_135431.html |title=Jacob Alperin-Sheriff: McCain Urged Reagan Admin To Meet Terror Groups Without Pre-Conditions |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=4 March 2012}}</ref> The report concluded that RENAMO's actions in Homoine did not significantly differ from the tactics it normally employed in such raids. These methods are described in the report in the following way:<blockquote>The attack stage was sometimes reported to begin with what appeared to the inhabitants to be the indiscriminate firing of automatic weapons by a substantial force of attacking RENAMO combatants. [\u2026] Reportedly the Government soldiers aim their defensive fire at the attackers, while the RENAMO forces shoot indiscriminately into the village. In some cases refugees perceived that the attacking force had divided into three detachments: one conducts the military attack; another enters houses and removes valuables, mainly clothing, radios, food, pots and other possessions; a third moves through the looted houses with pieces of burning thatch setting fire to the houses in the village. There were several reports that schools and health clinics are typical targets for destruction. The destruction of the village as a viable entity appears to be the main objective of such attacks. This type of attack causes several types of civilian casualties. As is normal in guerrilla warfare, some civilians are killed in crossfire between the two opposing forces, although this tends in the view of the refugees to account for only a minority of the deaths. A larger number of civilians in these attacks and other contexts were reported to be victims of purposeful shooting deaths and executions, of axing, knifing, bayoneting, burning to death, forced drowning and asphyxiation, and other forms of murder where no meaningful resistance or defense is present. Eyewitness accounts indicate that when civilians are killed in these indiscriminate attacks, whether against defended or undefended villages, children, often together with mothers and elderly people, are also killed. Varying numbers of civilian victims in each attack were reported to be rounded up and abducted [...].<ref>Gersony 1988, p. 30f.</ref></blockquote>Thus it appears the only difference between the Homoine massacre and RENAMO's usual methods was the size of the operation. Normally RENAMO would choose smaller, easier targets instead of attacking a town defended by some 90 government soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-24/news/mn-3651_1_renamo |title=Toll Over 380; Guerrillas Blamed : Massacre in Mozambique: Babies, Elderly Shot Down|website=Los Angeles Times|date=16 August 1987}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Gersony Report, RENAMO's transgressions were far more systematic, widespread and grave than FRELIMO's: the refugees interviewed for the Gersony Report attributed 94% of the murders, 94% of the abductions and 93% of the lootings to RENAMO.<ref>Gersony 1988, p.34-36.</ref> However, this conclusion has been disputed by the French Marxist scholar Michel Cahen, who states that both sides were equally to blame:<blockquote>There can be no doubt that the war was largely one fought against civilians... I am also convinced that the war was equally savage on both sides, even if the total domination of the media by FRELIMO for the 15 years of the war has led even those most desirous of remaining objective to attribute the majority of the atrocities to RENAMO. The people themselves were not duped: they attributed various acts of banditry and certain massacres to \"RENAMO 1,\" but others to \"RENAMO 2\" \u2013 the euphemistic term for FRELIMO soldiers and militiamen acting on their own.<ref>Cahen 1998, p. 13.</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== FRELIMO ===\n\nFRELIMO soldiers also committed serious war crimes during the civil war.<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1990/WR90/AFRICA.BOU-07.htm#P403_90345 Mozambique] HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH WORLD REPORT 1990</ref> FRELIMO forced people into its employment and conscription periods often extended beyond what the law allowed. Living in the communal villages became mandatory in certain provinces. However, in some areas, cultural norms required households to live at some distance apart from each other.  Therefore, many people preferred living in the countryside despite the risk of RENAMO assaults and raids.<ref name=\"priory1\">{{cite web|url=http://priory.com/psych/traumacult.htm |title=War Traumas in Central Mozambique |publisher=Priory.com |date=10 February 2007 |accessdate=4 March 2012}}</ref> Thus people would often be forced into the communal villages at gunpoint by FAM-soldiers or their Zimbabwean allies. As a local recalls:<blockquote>I never wanted to leave my old residence and come to the communal village. Even with the war, I wanted to stay where I had my land and granaries. Ever since a long time ago, we never lived with so many people together in the same place. Everyone must live in his own yard. The Komeredes [Zimbabwean soldiers] came to my house and said that I should leave my house and go to the communal village where there were a lot of people. I tried to refuse and then they set fire to my house, my granaries, and my fields. They threatened me with death and they told me and my family to go forward. Inside the communal village we lived like pigs. It was like a yard for pigs. We were so many people living close to each other. If someone slept with his wife everyone could listen to what they were doing. When we went to the fields or to the cemeteries to bury the dead, the soldiers had to come behind and in front of us. When the women went to the river to wash themselves, the soldiers had to go too and they usually saw our women naked. Everything was a complete shame inside that corral. Usually to eat, we had to depend on humanitarian aid, but we never knew when it would arrive. It was terrible; that is why many people used to run away from the communal village to their old residences where RENAMO soldiers were, although it was also terrible there.<ref name=\"priory1\" /></blockquote>Rape also became a widespread and problematic practise of FRELIMO soldiers. However, it was far less frequent and lacked the institutionalised quality of sexual violence carried out by RENAMO.<ref>Igreja 2007, p. 150.</ref>\n\nAs part of a series of measures following independence, FRELIMO introduced \"reeducation camps\" to which petty criminals, political opponents, and alleged anti-social elements such as prostitutes were sent, oftentimes without trial due to a lack of judges. Despite these accusations President Machel made numerous visits to various camps and released about 2,000 detainees in 1980 and closed numerous camps due to human rights abuses.<ref>Jay Ross, \"Mozambican Reeducation Camps Raise Rights Questions\", ''The Washington Post'' (United States of America), 7 May 1980</ref><ref>\"Machel's Speech on Unjust Detentions in Reeducation Camps\" Summary of World Broadcasts, 6 October 1981</ref> The government was also accused of executing thousands of people while trying to extend its control throughout the country.<ref>Hoile, David.

FRELIMO's new draft constitution in July 1989 paved the way for a multiparty system, and a new constitution was adopted in November 1990. Mozambique was now a multiparty state, with periodic elections, and guaranteed democratic rights.\n\nOn 4 October 1992, the [[Rome General Peace Accords]], negotiated by the [[Community of Sant'Egidio]] with the support of the [[United Nations]], were signed in [[Rome]] between President Chissano and RENAMO leader Afonso Dhlakama, which formally took effect on 15 October 1992. A UN peacekeeping force ([[UNOMOZ]]) of 7,500 arrived in Mozambique and oversaw a two-year transition to democracy. 2,400 international observers also entered the country to supervise the elections held on 27\u201328 October 1994. The last UNOMOZ contingents departed in early 1995. By then out of a total population of 13-15 million at the time, the Mozambican civil war had caused about one million deaths, displaced 5.7 million internally and resulted with 1.7 million refugees.<ref name=\"state1\"/><ref name=\"populstat1\"/><ref name=\"unhcr.org\">''[https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/publications/sowr/4a4c754a9/state-worlds-refugees-2000-fifty-years-humanitarian-action.html State of the World's Refugees, 2000]'' United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</ref>\n\n=== Landmines ===\n[[HALO Trust]], a de-mining group funded by the US and UK, began operating in Mozambique in 1993, recruiting local workers to remove land mines scattered throughout the country. Four HALO workers were killed in the subsequent effort to rid Mozambique of land mines, which continued to cause as many as several hundred civilian injuries and fatalities annually for years after the war. In September 2015, the country was finally declared to be free of land mines, with the last known device intentionally detonated as part of a ceremony.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/17/last-known-landmine-mozambique-destroyed?CMP=share_btn_tw|title=Flash and a bang as Mozambique is declared free of landmines|date=17 September 2015|accessdate=17 September 2015|work=The Guardian|first=David|last=Smith}}</ref>\n\n===Resurgence of violence since 2013===\n{{main|RENAMO insurgency (2013\u20132019)}}\nIn mid-2013, after more than twenty years of peace, the RENAMO insurgency was renewed, mainly in the central and northern regions of the country. On 5 September 2014, former president [[Armando Guebuza]] and the leader of RENAMO Afonso Dhlakama signed the Accord on Cessation of Hostilities, which brought the military hostilities to a halt and allowed both parties to concentrate on the general elections to be held in October 2014. Yet, following the general elections, a new political crisis emerged and the country appears to be once again on the brink of violent conflict. RENAMO does not recognise the validity of the election results, and demands the control of six provinces \u2013 Nampula, Niassa, Tete, Zambezia, Sofala, and Manica \u2013 where they claim to have won a majority.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/19787524 | title=Provincial Autonomy: The Territorial Dimension of Peace in Mozambique | first=Nat\u00e1lia | last=Bueno | publisher=Academia | accessdate=20 February 2019 }}</ref>\n\nOn 20 January 2016, the Secretary General of RENAMO, Manuel Bissopo, was injured in a shootout, where his bodyguard died.

It is a member municipality of the [[Metro Vancouver]] regional district and metropolitan area. Mainly a suburban city, Surrey is the province's second-largest by population after [[Vancouver]] and the third-largest by area after [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]] and [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]].\n\nThe seven neighbourhoods, or town centres, that the City of Surrey comprises are [[Fleetwood, Surrey|Fleetwood]], [[Whalley, Surrey|Whalley]], [[Whalley, Surrey|City Centre]], [[Guildford, British Columbia|Guildford]], [[Newton, Surrey|Newton]], [[Cloverdale, Surrey|Cloverdale]], and [[South Surrey]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Surrey Communities|url=https://www.surrey.ca/community/6798.aspx|accessdate=February 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nSurrey was incorporated in 1879, and encompasses land formerly occupied by a number of [[Halqemeylem]]-speaking aboriginal groups. When Englishman H.J. Brewer looked across the [[Fraser River]] from [[New Westminster]] and saw a land reminiscent of his native County of [[Surrey]] in England, the settlement of Surrey was placed on the map. The area then comprised forests of [[douglas fir]], [[fir]], [[Thuja plicata|red cedar]], [[tsuga|hemlock]], [[blackberry]] bushes, and [[cranberry]] bogs. A portion of present-day Whalley (named after Harry Whalley, who owned and operated a gas bar at the bend in King George Blvd, (formerly King George Highway) at 108 Avenue, \"Whalley's Corner\") was used as a burial ground by the [[Kwantlen First Nation|Kwantlen]] (or Qw'ontl'en) Nation.\n\nSettlers arrived first in Cloverdale and parts of South Surrey, mostly to farm, fish, harvest oysters, or set up small stores. Once the [[Pattullo Bridge]] was erected in 1937, the way was open for Surrey to expand. In the post-war 1950s, North Surrey's neighbourhoods filled with single family homes and Surrey (not yet a city) became a bedroom community, absorbing commuters who worked in Burnaby or Vancouver.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Surrey witnessed unprecedented growth, as people from different parts of Canada and the world, particularly Asia, began to make the municipality their home. Surrey is projected to surpass the city of Vancouver as the most populous city in BC by 2020 - 2030.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://globalnews.ca/news/653206/surreys-population-projected-to-surpass-vancouvers/ | title=Surrey's population projected to surpass Vancouver's | publisher=Global News | date=June 18, 2013 | accessdate=September 29, 2015 | author=Jill Bennett}}</ref>\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nSurrey is governed by an eight-member city council. The current mayor of Surrey is [[Doug McCallum]], who took office on November 5, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.surrey.ca/city-government/2999.aspx|title=City Council|first=City of|last=Surrey|website=www.surrey.ca|accessdate=November 16, 2018}}</ref> The last elections were held in October 2018.

post-secondary educational institutions, Simon Fraser University and Kwantlen Polytechnic University, received opportunities for expansion. In 2002, Simon Fraser University made an investment by opening a campus in Surrey, the SFU Surrey Campus, which acts a satellite campus operating as a public research university as well as providing further impetus for shaping the city. Kwantlen Polytechnic University was granted a university designation from the BC provincial government, upgrading itself from a community college to an official academic teaching institution that has become renowned in applied research.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.surrey.ca/files/Education_Sector_Profile_Brochure__LORES.pdf | title=City of Surrey education | publisher=City of Surrey | accessdate=February 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nFarming has strongly been attached to the economic well-being of Surrey, as the city of Surrey itself fostered and cemented a robust culture of farming. Approximately a third of Surrey's land is preserved and designated as farmland that is utilized for the local production of food to cater the city's growing population as well as increasing employment opportunities via the creation of local jobs. Agriculture continues to invigorate Surrey's economy employing 3300 people or 1.6 percent of Surrey's overall labour force. Manufacturing is also a highly diversified sector where products are produced for developed and emerging industries that range from the cutting of lumber for various BC logging firms to constructing wind turbines as many Surrey-based environmental firms are capitalizing on the city's initiatives for the clean energy sector.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.surrey.ca/business-economic-development/3506.aspx | title=Economic Development | publisher=City of Surrey | accessdate=February 14, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.surrey.ca/files/Agriculture_Sector_Profile_LORES.pdf | title=Farming | publisher=City of Surrey | accessdate=February 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Health care ===\n\nThe health sector makes a significant contribution to Surrey's economy. Surrey is home to almost 900 health-related businesses where major focuses in several life science sub-sectors that include infectious diseases, marine bio-science, neuroscience, oncology and regenerative medicine.

SFU took over the space and programming that was initially built for [[Technical University of British Columbia|TechBC]], a technical university proposed for south of the [[Fraser River]] by the then-[[British Columbia New Democratic Party|NDP]] led provincial government. SFU Surrey offers a number of programs, including TechOne and Explorations; first-year cohort options; and studies in Health Science, Applied Sciences, Natural Sciences, Liberal Arts, Business Administration, and Interactive Arts and Technology.\n\nSurrey is also the home of [[Kwantlen Polytechnic University]], a polytechnic university that opened its doors in the [[Newton Town Centre]] of Surrey in 1981 as a response to the growing need for expanded vocational training across the Fraser Valley. Since then, it has expanded to provide satellite campuses in [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], [[Langley, British Columbia (city)|Langley]], and a trades and technology centre in the [[Cloverdale, British Columbia|Cloverdale Town Centre]]. The Surrey campus offers university transfer, career-training and academic-upgrading programs with focuses on science, business, arts, and health, including a publicly accessible wellness centre, while the Cloverdale campus offers vocational training through apprenticeships, citations, certificates, and diplomas for skilled trades and technical careers.\n\nSurrey also has many private post-secondary institutions offering vocational training including [[Brighton College (Canada)|Brighton College]], [[Sprott Shaw College]], [[CDI College]], Western Community College, Sterling College, Stenberg College, Academy of Learning, Surrey Community College, Discovery Community College and [[Vancouver Career College]].\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Attractions ===\n\n[[File:City of Surrey Museum 2010a.jpg|right|thumb|Surrey Museum in the [[Cloverdale, British Columbia|Cloverdale]] area of Surrey]]\n[[File:Surrey center library.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Surrey Central Library]]\n[[File:City of Surrey Cenotaph 2009.jpg|right|thumb|Surrey Cenotaph]]\nThe Museum of Surrey is affiliated with [[Canadian Museums Association|CMA]], [[Canadian Heritage Information Network|CHIN]], and [[Virtual Museum of Canada]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  It reopened as the Museum of Surrey on September 29, 2018, after a renovation which added {{convert|12000|sqft}} to the previous {{convert|24000|sqft|adj=on}} building.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://dailyhive.com/vancouver/surrey-museum-expansion-opening-2018|title=$16-million expansion of Museum of Surrey to open this fall|last=Chan|first=Kenneth|date=April 24, 2018|work=Daily Hive|access-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/2372.aspx|title=Museum of Surrey|last=Surrey|first=City of|website=www.surrey.ca|access-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe historic Surrey Municipal Hall complex includes the Cenotaph in Heritage Square, the Surrey Museum, and Cloverdale Library.

Early trails and roads helped to encourage the settlement of Surrey. The first trail built by a settler was the 1861 the [[Kennedy Trail]]. James Kennedy built the trail to provide a route between New Westminster and the natural pasture land on the Mud Bay Flats next to the Serpentine River.<ref>Early Trails and Roads in the Lower Fraser Valley, W.

The lower deck, for rail, enabled [[British Columbia Electric Railway|BC Electric Railway]] to finally construct the Interurban line, an electric suburb commuter rail route connecting Chilliwack to Vancouver. It opened for service in 1910, and ran through Kennedy, [[Newton Town Centre|Newton]], Sullivan, and [[Cloverdale, British Columbia|Cloverdale]]. Currently, two of the BCER cars (1225 & 1304) are nearly finished being restored for operation on the mainline between Cloverdale and Sullivan.

[[British Columbia Highway 10|Highway 10]] was built in 1953, and [[British Columbia Highway 15|Highway 15]] in 1957. In 1964, the provincial government completed Highway 401 and the [[Port Mann Bridge]]; that section of roadway would later be renamed [[British Columbia Highway 1|Highway 1]]. In 1959, the [[George Massey Tunnel]] was opened, along with what is known as [[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]]. With the completion of the new Highways 1 and 99, the Fraser Highway and King George Boulevard became major arteries.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Surrey saw the return of rail transit with the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] [[Expo Line (TransLink)|Expo Line]] expansion into Surrey.

In 2011, the city council released the second update to the 2008 document indicating the progress made in the three years since the inception of the report.<ref>{{cite web | title = Sustainability Charter update 2011 | publisher = City of Surrey | url = http://www.surrey.ca/files/2011FinalSustainabilityReport_web.pdf | accessdate = February 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Problems ===\n{{Anchor|Hurdles}}\nBeing an all-inclusive plan requires an interplay of many complex and sometimes [[wicked problems]]. Trying to account for all problems is ambitious, and as the report admits, being at the municipal level reduces the funding, power and resources to implement the vision. The report acknowledges the political hurdle and notes that the city needs to influence players with more power such as the provincial or federal government in order for the vision to be successful.\n\nSome other hurdles that have arisen since the inception of the charter include the following:\n\n==== Suburban sprawl and the Gateway Program ====\n[[File:Holland Park, Surrey BC2.jpg|alt=|thumb|Holland Park and Residential towers in Surrey]]\n{{See also|Urban sprawl|Gateway Program}}\n\nSurrey currently faces the problem of Urban Sprawl, the phenomenon that is characterized by the low density residential, with almost no commercial or industrial zoning. This results in a heavy outflow of traffic in the morning, and inflow in the evening.\n\nThe announcement of the Gateway Program in 2005 by the [[British Columbia Ministry of Transportation]] meant a large expenditure in transportation infrastructure. Despite the oppositions by the [[Metro Vancouver]] and several mayoral councils,<ref>{{cite web | title = Burnaby Public Consultation on Provincial Gateway Program | publisher = City of Burnaby | url = http://www.burnaby.ca/Assets/city+services/roads+and+traffic/Transportation+-+Gateway+-+January+15+2007+Council+Report.pdf | accessdate = February 13, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Standing Committee Minutes | publisher = City of Vancouver | url = http://vancouver.ca/ctyclerk/cclerk/20060606/documents/ttmin.pdf | accessdate = February 13, 2013}}</ref> the project went ahead to create the [[South Fraser Perimeter Road]] and the [[Port Mann Bridge#Replacement|Port Mann Bridge]], both which pass through major portions of Surrey. It has been criticized to be contradictory to not only Metro Vancouver's Sustainable Region Initiative,<ref>{{cite web | title = Proposed twinning of the Port Mann Bridge and Highway 1 expansion | publisher = David Suzuki Foundation | url = http://www.livableregion.ca/pdf/PortMannBriefingJune06.pdf | accessdate = February 13, 2013}}</ref> but also Surrey's Sustainability Charter. Studies have shown that with an increase in road capacity, ''generated traffic'' increases, that is traffic that is diverted (shifted in time and route) and induced travel (increased total motor vehicle travel).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vtpi.org/gentraf.pdf |title=Generated Traffic and Induced Travel Implications for Transport Planning |last=Litman |first=Todd |publisher=Victoria Transport Policy Institute |date=September 10, 2012 |accessdate=February 11, 2013 }}</ref> With the construction of the 10 lane [[Port Mann Bridge#Replacement|Port Mann Bridge]], the problem of suburban sprawl is exacerbated not only with the additional capacity, but RapidBus service was also cancelled despite expectations of a stop in Surrey.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.news1130.com/2012/11/23/dianne-watts-angry-surrey-dropped-from-rapidbus-plans/ |title=Dianne Watts angry Surrey dropped from RapidBus plans |date=November 23, 2012 |publisher=News1130 |accessdate=February 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Transportation and land use ====\n\nThe Sustainability Charter hinges on a large reduction on [[automobile dependency]] requiring a well established transit infrastructure to the multiple districts of Surrey. In 2008, [[Gordon Campbell]] announced the extension of the [[Expo Line (TransLink)|Expo Line]] beyond the current terminus to as far as Langley.<ref>{{cite news |title=More Skytrains for Surrey |date=January 16, 2008 |publisher=The Leader  |location=Surrey, BC |id={{ProQuest|373127516}} }}</ref> However, financial shortfall came upon Translink shortly after, and many of the announced plans came to a halt. Plans to expand northward via the [[Evergreen Line (TransLink)|Evergreen Line]] came to fruition prior the vision of extending [[light rail]] out to Guildford, Newton and Langley. Trying to make ends meet, Mayor\nWatts attempts to impose equal tolling across the region to assist with funding transit to reduce car reliance.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/a-better-surrey-hinges-on-halted-transit-plans/article4279109/ |title=A better Surrey hinges on halted transit plans |date=June 15, 2012 |publisher=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=February 13, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nProtecting agricultural land reserves also play an important part in the charter of sustainability. The idea behind the agricultural land reserves is to encourage and increase the role of urban agriculture thus reducing the reliance of food transport and increasing the quality and availability of food to local people. The Charter takes the idea one step further by bringing in value adding food processing agribusiness to complete the supply chain circle.<ref>{{cite web | title = Sustainability Charter: a commitment to sustainability | publisher = City of Surrey | url = http://www.surrey.ca/files/Sustainability_Charter.pdf |pages=20 | accessdate = February 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a case study of Toronto completed by Pierre Filion, he claims that while transit and natural area conservation are successful at achieving their respective immediate objectives, they \"do not modify metropolitan-wide relations between transportation and land use...in a fashion that is consistent with smart growth\".

Canada, located south of the [[Fraser River]] and north of the [[Canada\u2013United States border]]. It is a member municipality of the [[Metro Vancouver]] regional district and metropolitan area. Mainly a suburban city, Surrey is the province's second-largest by population after [[Vancouver]] and the third-largest by area after [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]] and [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]].\n\nThe seven neighbourhoods, or town centres, that the City of Surrey comprises are [[Fleetwood, Surrey|Fleetwood]], [[Whalley, Surrey|Whalley]], [[Whalley, Surrey|City Centre]], [[Guildford, British Columbia|Guildford]], [[Newton, Surrey|Newton]], [[Cloverdale, Surrey|Cloverdale]], and [[South Surrey]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Surrey Communities|url=https://www.surrey.ca/community/6798.aspx|accessdate=February 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nSurrey was incorporated in 1879, and encompasses land formerly occupied by a number of [[Halqemeylem]]-speaking aboriginal groups. When Englishman H.J. Brewer looked across the [[Fraser River]] from [[New Westminster]] and saw a land reminiscent of his native County of [[Surrey]] in England, the settlement of Surrey was placed on the map. The area then comprised forests of [[douglas fir]], [[fir]], [[Thuja plicata|red cedar]], [[tsuga|hemlock]], [[blackberry]] bushes, and [[cranberry]] bogs. A portion of present-day Whalley (named after Harry Whalley, who owned and operated a gas bar at the bend in King George Blvd, (formerly King George Highway) at 108 Avenue, \"Whalley's Corner\") was used as a burial ground by the [[Kwantlen First Nation|Kwantlen]] (or Qw'ontl'en) Nation.\n\nSettlers arrived first in Cloverdale and parts of South Surrey, mostly to farm, fish, harvest oysters, or set up small stores. Once the [[Pattullo Bridge]] was erected in 1937, the way was open for Surrey to expand. In the post-war 1950s, North Surrey's neighbourhoods filled with single family homes and Surrey (not yet a city) became a bedroom community, absorbing commuters who worked in Burnaby or Vancouver.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Surrey witnessed unprecedented growth, as people from different parts of Canada and the world, particularly Asia, began to make the municipality their home. Surrey is projected to surpass the city of Vancouver as the most populous city in BC by 2020 - 2030.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://globalnews.ca/news/653206/surreys-population-projected-to-surpass-vancouvers/ | title=Surrey's population projected to surpass Vancouver's | publisher=Global News | date=June 18, 2013 | accessdate=September 29, 2015 | author=Jill Bennett}}</ref>\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nSurrey is governed by an eight-member city council. The current mayor of Surrey is [[Doug McCallum]], who took office on November 5, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.surrey.ca/city-government/2999.aspx|title=City Council|first=City of|last=Surrey|website=www.surrey.ca|accessdate=November 16, 2018}}</ref> The last elections were held in October 2018.

post-secondary educational institutions, Simon Fraser University and Kwantlen Polytechnic University, received opportunities for expansion. In 2002, Simon Fraser University made an investment by opening a campus in Surrey, the SFU Surrey Campus, which acts a satellite campus operating as a public research university as well as providing further impetus for shaping the city. Kwantlen Polytechnic University was granted a university designation from the BC provincial government, upgrading itself from a community college to an official academic teaching institution that has become renowned in applied research.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.surrey.ca/files/Education_Sector_Profile_Brochure__LORES.pdf | title=City of Surrey education | publisher=City of Surrey | accessdate=February 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n\nFarming has strongly been attached to the economic well-being of Surrey, as the city of Surrey itself fostered and cemented a robust culture of farming. Approximately a third of Surrey's land is preserved and designated as farmland that is utilized for the local production of food to cater the city's growing population as well as increasing employment opportunities via the creation of local jobs. Agriculture continues to invigorate Surrey's economy employing 3300 people or 1.6 percent of Surrey's overall labour force. Manufacturing is also a highly diversified sector where products are produced for developed and emerging industries that range from the cutting of lumber for various BC logging firms to constructing wind turbines as many Surrey-based environmental firms are capitalizing on the city's initiatives for the clean energy sector.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.surrey.ca/business-economic-development/3506.aspx | title=Economic Development | publisher=City of Surrey | accessdate=February 14, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.surrey.ca/files/Agriculture_Sector_Profile_LORES.pdf | title=Farming | publisher=City of Surrey | accessdate=February 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Health care ===\n\nThe health sector makes a significant contribution to Surrey's economy. Surrey is home to almost 900 health-related businesses where major focuses in several life science sub-sectors that include infectious diseases, marine bio-science, neuroscience, oncology and regenerative medicine.

SFU took over the space and programming that was initially built for [[Technical University of British Columbia|TechBC]], a technical university proposed for south of the [[Fraser River]] by the then-[[British Columbia New Democratic Party|NDP]] led provincial government. SFU Surrey offers a number of programs, including TechOne and Explorations; first-year cohort options; and studies in Health Science, Applied Sciences, Natural Sciences, Liberal Arts, Business Administration, and Interactive Arts and Technology.\n\nSurrey is also the home of [[Kwantlen Polytechnic University]], a polytechnic university that opened its doors in the [[Newton Town Centre]] of Surrey in 1981 as a response to the growing need for expanded vocational training across the Fraser Valley. Since then, it has expanded to provide satellite campuses in [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], [[Langley, British Columbia (city)|Langley]], and a trades and technology centre in the [[Cloverdale, British Columbia|Cloverdale Town Centre]]. The Surrey campus offers university transfer, career-training and academic-upgrading programs with focuses on science, business, arts, and health, including a publicly accessible wellness centre, while the Cloverdale campus offers vocational training through apprenticeships, citations, certificates, and diplomas for skilled trades and technical careers.\n\nSurrey also has many private post-secondary institutions offering vocational training including [[Brighton College (Canada)|Brighton College]], [[Sprott Shaw College]], [[CDI College]], Western Community College, Sterling College, Stenberg College, Academy of Learning, Surrey Community College, Discovery Community College and [[Vancouver Career College]].\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Attractions ===\n\n[[File:City of Surrey Museum 2010a.jpg|right|thumb|Surrey Museum in the [[Cloverdale, British Columbia|Cloverdale]] area of Surrey]]\n[[File:Surrey center library.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Surrey Central Library]]\n[[File:City of Surrey Cenotaph 2009.jpg|right|thumb|Surrey Cenotaph]]\nThe Museum of Surrey is affiliated with [[Canadian Museums Association|CMA]], [[Canadian Heritage Information Network|CHIN]], and [[Virtual Museum of Canada]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}  It reopened as the Museum of Surrey on September 29, 2018, after a renovation which added {{convert|12000|sqft}} to the previous {{convert|24000|sqft|adj=on}} building.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://dailyhive.com/vancouver/surrey-museum-expansion-opening-2018|title=$16-million expansion of Museum of Surrey to open this fall|last=Chan|first=Kenneth|date=April 24, 2018|work=Daily Hive|access-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.surrey.ca/culture-recreation/2372.aspx|title=Museum of Surrey|last=Surrey|first=City of|website=www.surrey.ca|access-date=September 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe historic Surrey Municipal Hall complex includes the Cenotaph in Heritage Square, the Surrey Museum, and Cloverdale Library.

Early trails and roads helped to encourage the settlement of Surrey. The first trail built by a settler was the 1861 the [[Kennedy Trail]]. James Kennedy built the trail to provide a route between New Westminster and the natural pasture land on the Mud Bay Flats next to the Serpentine River.<ref>Early Trails and Roads in the Lower Fraser Valley, W.

The lower deck, for rail, enabled [[British Columbia Electric Railway|BC Electric Railway]] to finally construct the Interurban line, an electric suburb commuter rail route connecting Chilliwack to Vancouver. It opened for service in 1910, and ran through Kennedy, [[Newton Town Centre|Newton]], Sullivan, and [[Cloverdale, British Columbia|Cloverdale]]. Currently, two of the BCER cars (1225 & 1304) are nearly finished being restored for operation on the mainline between Cloverdale and Sullivan.

[[British Columbia Highway 10|Highway 10]] was built in 1953, and [[British Columbia Highway 15|Highway 15]] in 1957. In 1964, the provincial government completed Highway 401 and the [[Port Mann Bridge]]; that section of roadway would later be renamed [[British Columbia Highway 1|Highway 1]]. In 1959, the [[George Massey Tunnel]] was opened, along with what is known as [[British Columbia Highway 99|Highway 99]]. With the completion of the new Highways 1 and 99, the Fraser Highway and King George Boulevard became major arteries.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Surrey saw the return of rail transit with the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] [[Expo Line (TransLink)|Expo Line]] expansion into Surrey.

In 2011, the city council released the second update to the 2008 document indicating the progress made in the three years since the inception of the report.<ref>{{cite web | title = Sustainability Charter update 2011 | publisher = City of Surrey | url = http://www.surrey.ca/files/2011FinalSustainabilityReport_web.pdf | accessdate = February 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Problems ===\n{{Anchor|Hurdles}}\nBeing an all-inclusive plan requires an interplay of many complex and sometimes [[wicked problems]]. Trying to account for all problems is ambitious, and as the report admits, being at the municipal level reduces the funding, power and resources to implement the vision. The report acknowledges the political hurdle and notes that the city needs to influence players with more power such as the provincial or federal government in order for the vision to be successful.\n\nSome other hurdles that have arisen since the inception of the charter include the following:\n\n==== Suburban sprawl and the Gateway Program ====\n[[File:Holland Park, Surrey BC2.jpg|alt=|thumb|Holland Park and Residential towers in Surrey BC]]\n{{See also|Urban sprawl|Gateway Program}}\n\nSurrey currently faces the problem of Urban Sprawl, the phenomenon that is characterized by the low density residential, with almost no commercial or industrial zoning. This results in a heavy outflow of traffic in the morning, and inflow in the evening.\n\nThe announcement of the Gateway Program in 2005 by the [[British Columbia Ministry of Transportation]] meant a large expenditure in transportation infrastructure. Despite the oppositions by the [[Metro Vancouver]] and several mayoral councils,<ref>{{cite web | title = Burnaby Public Consultation on Provincial Gateway Program | publisher = City of Burnaby | url = http://www.burnaby.ca/Assets/city+services/roads+and+traffic/Transportation+-+Gateway+-+January+15+2007+Council+Report.pdf | accessdate = February 13, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Standing Committee Minutes | publisher = City of Vancouver | url = http://vancouver.ca/ctyclerk/cclerk/20060606/documents/ttmin.pdf | accessdate = February 13, 2013}}</ref> the project went ahead to create the [[South Fraser Perimeter Road]] and the [[Port Mann Bridge#Replacement|Port Mann Bridge]], both which pass through major portions of Surrey. It has been criticized to be contradictory to not only Metro Vancouver's Sustainable Region Initiative,<ref>{{cite web | title = Proposed twinning of the Port Mann Bridge and Highway 1 expansion | publisher = David Suzuki Foundation | url = http://www.livableregion.ca/pdf/PortMannBriefingJune06.pdf | accessdate = February 13, 2013}}</ref> but also Surrey's Sustainability Charter. Studies have shown that with an increase in road capacity, ''generated traffic'' increases, that is traffic that is diverted (shifted in time and route) and induced travel (increased total motor vehicle travel).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vtpi.org/gentraf.pdf |title=Generated Traffic and Induced Travel Implications for Transport Planning |last=Litman |first=Todd |publisher=Victoria Transport Policy Institute |date=September 10, 2012 |accessdate=February 11, 2013 }}</ref> With the construction of the 10 lane [[Port Mann Bridge#Replacement|Port Mann Bridge]], the problem of suburban sprawl is exacerbated not only with the additional capacity, but RapidBus service was also cancelled despite expectations of a stop in Surrey.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.news1130.com/2012/11/23/dianne-watts-angry-surrey-dropped-from-rapidbus-plans/ |title=Dianne Watts angry Surrey dropped from RapidBus plans |date=November 23, 2012 |publisher=News1130 |accessdate=February 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Transportation and land use ====\n\nThe Sustainability Charter hinges on a large reduction on [[automobile dependency]] requiring a well established transit infrastructure to the multiple districts of Surrey. In 2008, [[Gordon Campbell]] announced the extension of the [[Expo Line (TransLink)|Expo Line]] beyond the current terminus to as far as Langley.<ref>{{cite news |title=More Skytrains for Surrey |date=January 16, 2008 |publisher=The Leader  |location=Surrey, BC |id={{ProQuest|373127516}} }}</ref> However, financial shortfall came upon Translink shortly after, and many of the announced plans came to a halt. Plans to expand northward via the [[Evergreen Line (TransLink)|Evergreen Line]] came to fruition prior the vision of extending [[light rail]] out to Guildford, Newton and Langley. Trying to make ends meet, Mayor\nWatts attempts to impose equal tolling across the region to assist with funding transit to reduce car reliance.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/british-columbia/a-better-surrey-hinges-on-halted-transit-plans/article4279109/ |title=A better Surrey hinges on halted transit plans |date=June 15, 2012 |publisher=The Globe and Mail |accessdate=February 13, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nProtecting agricultural land reserves also play an important part in the charter of sustainability. The idea behind the agricultural land reserves is to encourage and increase the role of urban agriculture thus reducing the reliance of food transport and increasing the quality and availability of food to local people.

Each trophic class supports different types of fish and other organisms, as well. If the algal biomass in a lake or other water body reaches too high a concentration (say >80 TSI), massive [[fish die-off]]s may occur as decomposing biomass deoxygenates the water.\n\n===Oligotrophic===\n[[File:20161001 Kurtkowiec i Czerwone Stawy G\u0105sienicowe 1730.jpg|thumb|[[Kurtkowiec Lake]], an oligotrophic lake in the [[Tatra Mountains]] of southern [[Poland]]]]\n\nAn oligotrophic lake is a lake with low [[primary productivity]], as a result of low [[nutrient]] content. These lakes have low [[algal]] production, and consequently, often have very clear waters, with high [[drinking water|drinking-water]] quality. The bottom waters of such lakes typically have ample [[oxygen]]; thus, such lakes often support many [[fish]] species such as [[lake trout]], which require cold, well-[[Oxygenation (environmental)|oxygenated]] waters. The oxygen content is likely to be higher in deep lakes, owing to their larger [[hypolimnion|hypolimnetic]] volume.\n\nEcologists use the term [[oligotroph]]ic to distinguish unproductive lakes, characterised by nutrient deficiency, from productive, eutrophic lakes, with an ample or excessive nutrient supply. Oligotrophic lakes are most common in cold regions underlain by resistant [[igneous]] rocks (especially [[granitic]] bedrock).\n\n===Mesotrophic===\nMesotrophic lakes are lakes with an intermediate level of productivity. These lakes are commonly clear water lakes and ponds with beds of submerged aquatic plants and medium levels of nutrients.\n\nThe term mesotrophic is also applied to terrestrial habitats. Mesotrophic soils have moderate nutrient levels.\n\n===Eutrophic===\n{{Main|Eutrophication}}\n[[Image:River algae Sichuan.jpg|thumb|upright|Algal bloom in a village river in the mountains near [[Chengdu]], [[Sichuan]], China]]\n\nA eutrophic water body, commonly a lake or pond, has high biological productivity. Due to excessive nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, these water bodies are able to support an abundance of aquatic plants. Usually, the water body will be dominated either by aquatic plants or algae. When aquatic plants dominate, the water tends to be clear. When algae dominate, the water tends to be darker. The algae engage in photosynthesis which supplies oxygen to the fish and biota which inhabit these waters. Occasionally, an excessive algal bloom will occur and can ultimately result in fish death, due to respiration by algae and bottom-living bacteria. The process of [[eutrophication]] can occur naturally and by [[human impact on the environment]].\n\nEutrophic comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''eutrophos'' meaning \"well-nourished\", from ''eu'' meaning good and ''trephein'' meaning \"to nourish\".<ref>Definition of [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/eutrophic eutrophic] at [[dictionary.com]].</ref>\n\n===Hypereutrophic===\nHypereutrophic lakes are very nutrient-rich lakes characterized by frequent and severe nuisance [[algal blooms]] and low transparency. Hypereutrophic lakes have a visibility depth of less than {{convert|3|ft|cm|sigfig=1}}, they have greater than 40 micrograms/litre total [[chlorophyll]] and greater than 100 micrograms/litre [[phosphorus]].\n\nThe excessive algal blooms can also significantly reduce oxygen levels and prevent life from functioning at lower depths creating dead zones beneath the surface.\n\nLikewise, large algal blooms can cause [[biodilution]] to occur, which is a decrease in the concentration of a pollutant with an increase in [[trophic level]]. This is opposed to [[biomagnification]] and is due to a decreased concentration from increased algal uptake.\n\n==Trophic index drivers==\nBoth natural and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] factors can influence a lake or other water body's trophic index. A water body situated in a nutrient-rich region with high [[net primary productivity]] may be naturally eutrophic. Nutrients carried into water bodies from [[non-point sources]] such as agricultural runoff, residential fertilisers, and sewage will all increase the algal [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], and can easily cause an oligotrophic lake to become hypereutrophic.\n\n==Management targets==\nOften, the desired trophic index differs between stakeholders. Water-fowl enthusiasts (e.g. duck hunters) may want a lake to be eutrophic so that it will support a large population of waterfowl. Residents, though, may want the same lake to be oligotrophic, as this is more pleasant for swimming and boating. Natural resource agencies are generally responsible for reconciling these conflicting uses and determining what a water body's trophic index should be.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Biomass (ecology)]]\n* [[Eutrophication]]\n* [[Nonpoint source pollution]]\n* [[Secchi disk]]\n* [[Surface runoff]]\n* [[Trophic level]]\n* [[Trophic level index]], a similar measure used in New Zealand\n* [[Water quality]]\n* [[List of biological development disorders]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{aquatic ecosystem topics|expanded=none}}\n{{modelling ecosystems}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Trophic State Index}}\n[[Category:Aquatic ecology]]\n[[Category:Environmental science]]\n[[Category:Water pollution]]\n[[Category:Lakes]]\n[[Category:Limnology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|A measure of the ability of water to sustain biological activity}}\n[[File:Lake George from village beach.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Lake George (New York)|Lake George, New York]], an [[oligotrophic lake]].]]\n\nThe '''Trophic State Index''' ('''TSI''') is a classification system designed to rate water bodies based on the amount of [[biological activity]] they sustain.<ref name=\"USFWaterAtlas\">{{cite web |last1=University of Southern Florida Water Institute |title=Trophic State Index (TSI) |url=http://www.lake.wateratlas.usf.edu/shared/learnmore.asp?toolsection=lm_tsi |website=Learn More About Trophic State Index (TSI) - Lake.WaterAtlas.org |publisher=University of Southern Florida |accessdate=6 June 2018}}</ref> Although the term \"trophic index\" is commonly applied to lakes, any surface water body may be indexed.\n\nThe TSI of a water body is rated on a scale from zero to one hundred.<ref name=\"USFWaterAtlas\" /> Under the TSI scale, water bodies may be defined as:<ref name=\"USFWaterAtlas\" /> \n\n* '''oligotrophic''' (TSI 0\u201340, having the least amount of biological productivity, \"good\" water quality);\n* '''mesoeutrophic''' (TSI 40\u201360, having a moderate level of biological activity, \"fair\" water quality); or\n* '''eutrophic''' to '''hypereutrophic''' (TSI 60\u2013100, having the highest amount of biological activity, \"poor\" water quality).\n\nThe quantities of [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and other biologically useful nutrients are the primary determinants of a water body's TSI.

The process of [[eutrophication]] can occur naturally and by [[human impact on the environment]].\n\nEutrophic comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''eutrophos'' meaning \"well-nourished\", from ''eu'' meaning good and ''trephein'' meaning \"to nourish\".<ref>Definition of [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/eutrophic eutrophic] at [[dictionary.com]].</ref>\n\n===Hypereutrophic===\nHypereutrophic lakes are very nutrient-rich lakes characterized by frequent and severe nuisance [[algal blooms]] and low transparency. Hypereutrophic lakes have a visibility depth of less than {{convert|3|ft|cm|sigfig=1}}, they have greater than 40 micrograms/litre total [[chlorophyll]] and greater than 100 micrograms/litre [[phosphorus]].\n\nThe excessive algal blooms can also significantly reduce oxygen levels and prevent life from functioning at lower depths creating dead zones beneath the surface.\n\nLikewise, large algal blooms can cause [[biodilution]] to occur, which is a decrease in the concentration of a pollutant with an increase in [[trophic level]]. This is opposed to [[biomagnification]] and is due to a decreased concentration from increased algal uptake.\n\n==Trophic index drivers==\nBoth natural and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] factors can influence a lake or other water body's trophic index. A water body situated in a nutrient-rich region with high [[net primary productivity]] may be naturally eutrophic. Nutrients carried into water bodies from [[non-point sources]] such as agricultural runoff, residential fertilisers, and sewage will all increase the algal [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], and can easily cause an oligotrophic lake to become hypereutrophic.\n\n==Management targets==\nOften, the desired trophic index differs between stakeholders. Water-fowl enthusiasts (e.g. duck hunters) may want a lake to be eutrophic so that it will support a large population of waterfowl. Residents, though, may want the same lake to be oligotrophic, as this is more pleasant for swimming and boating. Natural resource agencies are generally responsible for reconciling these conflicting uses and determining what a water body's trophic index should be.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Biomass (ecology)]]\n* [[Eutrophication]]\n* [[Nonpoint source pollution]]\n* [[Secchi disk]]\n* [[Surface runoff]]\n* [[Trophic level]]\n* [[Trophic level index]], a similar measure used in New Zealand\n* [[Water quality]]\n* [[List of biological development disorders]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{aquatic ecosystem topics|expanded=none}}\n{{modelling ecosystems}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Trophic State Index}}\n[[Category:Aquatic ecology]]\n[[Category:Environmental science]]\n[[Category:Water pollution]]\n[[Category:Lakes]]\n[[Category:Limnology]]\n", "name_user": "Every-leaf-that-trembles", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added anchor to oligotrophic", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trophic_state_index"}

Football was the favorite free-time activity of local inhabitants. Milo\u0161 Vran\u010di\u0107 and Branko Banjac, two football passionates, came up with an idea to form a football club in the town. On 30 August 1958, the constituent assembly was held and new football club was created. It got the name '''LSK''' (''Lakta\u0161ki sportski klub'') and it was founded on the initiative of [[FK Partizan]].\n\nFirst generation of players of LSK was formed by: Milo\u0161 Vran\u010di\u0107, Branko Jakovljevi\u0107, Jovo Male\u0161evi\u0107, Slobodan Trnini\u0107, Miroslav Vran\u010di\u0107, Nenad Trnini\u0107, Neboj\u0161a Popovi\u0107, Milo\u0161 Saji\u0107, Vlatko Misija and Vlado Vranje\u0161.\n\nFirst match ever played was against FK Sloga at home and ended 4\u20134.\n\nIn '''1968''' due to the fact that most of the town's youth was going to study in universities throughout the country, the club was dissolved.\n\n===Rebirth in 1974===\n\nThe meeting of Tomislav Davidovi\u0107 and Branko Banjac, was decisive in reforming the club.\nOther persons that gave their contribution to this goal were Mladen Srdi\u0107 and Munib Ganibegovi\u0107, who helped preparing the administration and all necessary documentation.\n\n\u0110uro Male\u0161evi\u0107 wrote the first Regulations and Statute.\n\nThe Renewing Board assembly was held on 17 June 1974. First Executive Council members to be elected were Miljo Samard\u017ei\u0107, Du\u0161ko Kne\u017eevi\u0107, Srboljub Jefti\u0107, \u0110uro Male\u0161evi\u0107 and Branko Banjac.\nIt was decided that new football club get the name FK Lakta\u0161i (Fudbalski Klub Lakta\u0161i).\n\n===Era of Du\u0161an Tati\u0107===\nAfter 1974, the club has been improving year after year. They have started playing in the lowest leagues. Consolidation among the players and board members can be attributed to successful manager Du\u0161an Tati\u0107. Led by him, club managed to reach Intermunicipal and Regional leagues of [[SR Bosnia and Herzegovina]].\n\n===The Football Association of Republika Srpska===\n\nThe association was formed on 5 September 1992 by Bosnian Serbs who had declared independence from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Afterwards, '''FK Lakta\u0161i''' were clustered into '''Second league&nbsp;\u2013 Group Banjaluka'''. In 2000, due to reorganization of the Association, the club was transferred into the '''Third league of Republika Srpska.'''\n\n===Golden era (2003\u20132008)===\n\nIn the season 2002\u201303, under [[Vlado Jagodi\u0107]], club won the Third league and joined the [[Second League of the Republika Srpska]].\nJagodi\u0107 walked through the Second league in the 2003\u201304 season and got promoted to the [[First League of Republika Srpska]].\nThe club was finishing as middle-placed until the season 2006\u201307 when Jagodi\u0107 led the team to become the champions of [[Republika Srpska]] for the first time in club history and got promoted to [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the highest football competition in the country.\n\n==Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina (2007\u20132010)==\n\n===2007\u201308===\n\nIn season 2007\u201308, long-awaited journey could begin. Inspired and well motivated, FK Lakta\u0161i played their first match in Sarajevo, against [[FK Slavija]] and went home with 0\u20130 whereas in the second and first home match in new competition, they won [[NK Travnik]] 3:1. Vlado Jagodi\u0107 was given a sack during the winter break as he could not get along with board despite the great results. Lakta\u0161i also reached the 1/4 Finals of the Cup. At the end of season, team was in the middle of league table. Undoubtedly, the best player in this year was legendary striker [[Dragan Go\u0161i\u0107]].\n\n===2008\u201309===\n\nIn 2008\u201309, club continued to perform well. Surprisingly, at half-season they were third-placed. Despite the change of coach during the winter, club managed to finish the league on 8th position. The biggest win that year was 4\u20130 at home against [[NK \u010celik]] and glorious moment was defeating local rivals [[FK Borac Banja Luka|FK Borac]] 1\u20130 away.\n\n===2009\u201310===\n\nFirst months of the 2009\u201310 season were fatal. In 15 matches Lakta\u0161i won only 8 points. Great turnover happened in January. [[Slobodan Komljenovi\u0107]], former [[Serbia national football team|FR Yugoslavia international]], along with other managers and German coach [[Thomas Geist]], took over the club. Afterwards, many great players such as [[Vladan Gruji\u0107]], former Bosnian international, signed for the club in order to work alongside Komljenovi\u0107 and to help the club avoiding relegation. Legendary coach [[Dragoslav Stepanovi\u0107]] came to Lakta\u0161i to work as a manager as he was in family relations with Komljenovi\u0107. Unfortunately, that was not enough. Although team was playing great, at the end they finished on 15th position with 31 points, 1 point away from salvation.\n\n==Supporters==\n\nLakta\u0161i supporters \u010carobnjaci (Wizards) were formed in the 21st century. The nickname itself was given by one of the club legends, Goran Injac. The fans played an important role in 2006/2007 season when players won the First league of the Republika Srpska and got promoted to Premier league of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their leader is Ranko Beri\u0107.

Although team was playing great, at the end they finished on 15th position with 31 points, 1 point away from salvation.\n\n==Supporters==\n\nLakta\u0161i supporters \u010carobnjaci (Wizards) were formed in the 21st century. The nickname itself was given by one of the club legends, Goran Injac. The fans played an important role in 2006/2007 season when players won the First league of the Republika Srpska and got promoted to Premier league of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their leader is Ranko Beri\u0107. Since the 2009/2010 season, this fan group no longer gather as they boycott board politics.\n\n==Honours==\n;[[First League of the Republika Srpska]] (1):\n*2007\n;[[Second League of Republika Srpska|Second League of Republika Srpska&nbsp;\u2013 West]] (1):\n*2004\n;[[Third League of Republika Srpska|Third League of Republika Srpska&nbsp;\u2013 West]] (1):\n*2003\n\n==Notable former players==\n''For a list of current and former players with Wikipedia article, please see [[:Category:FK Lakta\u0161i players]].''\n\n==Managers==\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} [[Sabahudin Lihovi\u0107]]\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} [[Vlado Jagodi\u0107]] <small>(2002\u20132007)</small>\n*{{flagicon|Serbia}} [[\u010cedomir \u0110oin\u010devi\u0107]] <small>(2008\u20132009)</small>\n*{{flagicon|Serbia}} [[Slobodan Kustudi\u0107]] <small>(2008)</small>\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} [[Lazo Jovani\u0107]] <small>(2009)</small>\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} [[Zoran \u0106urguz]] <small>(2009\u20132010)</small>\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} [[Marko Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] <small>(2009\u20132010)</small>\n*{{flagicon|Serbia}} [[Dragoslav Stepanovi\u0107]] <small>(2010)</small>\n*{{flagicon|Serbia}}  [[Milan Milanovi\u0107 (footballer born 1963)|Milan Milanovi\u0107]] <small>(2010\u20132011)</small>\n*{{flagicon|Serbia}} [[Zdravko Gaji\u0107]] <small>(2011)</small>\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} [[Milo\u0161 Poji\u0107]] <small>(2011\u20132012)</small>\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} [[Predrag Tati\u0107]] <small>(2012\u20132014)</small>\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} [[Milo\u0161 Poji\u0107]] <small>(2014)</small>\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} [[Vlado Jagodi\u0107]] (2020)\n*{{flagicon|BIH}} [[Predrag Tati\u0107]] (2020\u2013present)\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081104015822/http://fk-laktasi.com/ Official Website]\n* [https://sites.google.com/site/fklaktasisite/home FK Lakta\u0161i] old official website\n* [http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/club=2600280/domestic.html FK Lakta\u0161i at UEFA.COM]\n* [http://www.eufo.de/football/bih/fk_ltasi.html FK Lakta\u0161i at EUFO.DE]\n* [http://www.weltfussball.de/teams/fk-laktasi/ FK Lakta\u0161i at Weltfussball.de]\n\n{{Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}\n{{Football in BiH}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Laktasi, Fk}}\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 1974]]\n[[Category:Football clubs in Republika Srpska]]\n[[Category:Football clubs in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n[[Category:1974 establishments in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n", "name_user": "Serbianboy87", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FK_Lakta%C5%A1i"}

During the [[Han dynasty]], it was part of [[Yichun, Jiangxi|Yichun]]. In 267, during the time of the [[Three Kingdoms]], it became Pingxiang County, which made it a higher level of administration than what it is today. During the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907), it was part of the [[Jiangnanxi Circuit]], and was called [[Yuanzhou (modern Jiangxi)|Yuanzhou]]. Its name and area of administration were changed many times until 1970, when it assumed its present form.\n\n==Administration==\n\nPingxiang has direct jurisdiction over two [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban districts]], one economic development area, three [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]], 28 towns, 18 townships, and 7 sub-districts.\n\n'''Urban districts''': \n*[[Anyuan District]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5b89\u6e90\u533a}})\n*[[Xiangdong District]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6e58\u4e1c\u533a}})\n*[[Anyuan Economic Development Zone]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5b89\u6e90\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f00\u53d1\u533a}})\n\n'''Counties''':\n*[[Shangli County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4e0a\u6817\u53bf}})\n*[[Luxi County, Jiangxi|Luxi County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u82a6\u6eaa\u53bf}})\n*[[Lianhua County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u83b2\u82b1\u53bf}})\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n!colspan=\"6\"| Map\n|-\n|colspan=\"6\" rowspan=\"11\"| <div style=\"position: relative\" class=\"center\">\n{{Image label begin|image=Administrative Division Pingxiang.png|width=300|link=}} \n{{Image label|x=290|y=450|scale=300/750|text=[[Anyuan District|'''Anyuan''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=90|y=580|scale=300/750|text=[[Xiangdong District|'''Xiangdong''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=240|y=240|scale=300/750|text=[[Shangli County|'''Shangli<br>County''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=500|y=500|scale=300/750|text=[[Luxi County, Jiangxi|'''Luxi<br>County''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=340|y=870|scale=300/750|text=[[Lianhua County|'''Lianhua<br>County''']]}}\n|}\n\n==Demographics==\nThe population of the total administrative area of Pingxiang was estimated to be 1,874,000 at the 2012 census.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Economy==\n\nIn 2013, the [[GDP]] was 79.2 billion RMB, an 8.2% growth over the previous year. Rural income was 11,100 RMB, a 10.5% growth over 2012 and urban income was 23,489 RMB, an 11% growth over 2012 (without regard to inflation).\n\n==Resources==\nPingxiang has abundant water and mineral resources. Five rivers flow across the land which delivers approximately 2.626 billion cubic meters per year. Coal, iron ore, limestone, kaolin and granite are the most abundant minerals of the city. Even today, the ''Pingxiangren'' or local people proudly refer to their city as the \"coal center of southern China.\"\n\n==Transportation==\nPingxiang is a regional hub for transportation. It is about 1.5 hrs drive to the CSX from downtown of Pingxiang. A couple of highways and the main rail line between Changsha and Nanchang run through the city. The city has had a high-speed railway since September 2014.\n\n==Tourism==\nWugong (also known as WooKong) mountain is a national well known place for tourism. It lies in the east of Pingxiang, 45 minutes from downtown. The highest altitude is 1,918 meters while the average altitude is about 1,500 meters. Most of the landscape remains virginal in despite of some necessary infrastructures that benefit tourists.\n\nYangqi mountain is famous for the religion of Buddhism, lies in north of Pingxiang, one hour's drive from downtown.\n\nNielongdong (also known as Sinful Dragon Cave) has a tale which refers to Chinese traditional religion and zodiac. This beautiful area is only twenty minutes north.\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Pingxiang, Jiangxi}}\n*[http://www.pingxiang.gov.cn/ Official website (Chinese)]\n\n{{Jiangxi topics}}\n{{Jiangxi}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Jiangxi]]\n[[Category:Prefecture-level divisions of Jiangxi]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the city in Jiangxi province|the city in Guangxi autonomous region|Pingxiang, Guangxi|other uses|Pingxiang (disambiguation)}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n|name                   = {{raise|0.2em|Pingxiang}}\n|settlement_type        = [[Prefecture-level city]]\n|other_name             = Pingsiang\n|native_name            = {{lower|0.1em|{{nobold|{{lang|zh-hans|\u840d\u4e61\u5e02}}}}}}\n|official_name          = \n|nickname               = \n|motto                  = \n|image_skyline          = Pingxiang, JX, PRC.jpg\n|imagesize              = 250px\n|image_caption          =Downtown Pingxiang\n|image_flag             = \n|flag_size              = \n|image_seal             = \n|seal_size              = \n|image_shield           = \n|shield_size            =\n|image_blank_emblem     =\n|blank_emblem_size      =\n|image_map              = Location of Pingxiang Prefecture within Jiangxi (China).png\n|mapsize                =\n|map_caption            = Location of Pingxiang City jurisdiction in Jiangxi\n|image_map1             =\n|mapsize1               = \n|map_caption1           =\n<!--\n|pushpin_map            = Jiangxi\n|pushpin_map_caption    = Location of the city centre in Jiangxi\n|pushpin_label_position = left\n|pushpin_mapsize        =\n-->\n|subdivision_type       = Country\n|subdivision_name       = People's Republic of China\n|subdivision_type1      = [[Provinces of China|Province]]\n|subdivision_name1      = [[Jiangxi]]\n|subdivision_type2      = \n|subdivision_name2      = \n|seat_type              =\n|seat                   =\n|government_type        =\n|leader_title           = Mayor\n|leader_name            = [[Li Xiaobao]] \n|leader_title1          =  <!-- for places with, say, both a mayor and a city manager -->\n|leader_name1           =\n|established_title      =  \n|established_date       = \n|area_magnitude         = \n<!--Enter: Imperial, if Imperial (metric) is desired-->\n|area_footnotes         = \n|area_total_km2         = 3824 \n|area_land_km2          = 3824 \n|area_water_km2         =\n|area_water_percent     = \n|area_urban_km2         = 1073\n|area_metro_km2         = 1073\n|population_as_of       =2010\n|population_footnotes   = \n|population_note        = \n|population_total       =1,854,510\n|population_density_km2 = auto\n|population_metro       = 893,550\n|population_density_metro_km2 =\n|population_urban       = 893,550\n|population_density_urban_km2 =\n|timezone = [[China Standard Time|China Standard]]\n|utc_offset = +8\n|coor_pinpoint = Pingxiang government\n|coordinates            = {{coord|27.659|N|113.887|E|type:adm2nd_region:CN-36_source:Gaode|format=dms|display=it}}\n|elevation_footnotes    =  <!--for references: use <ref> </ref> tags-->\n|elevation_m              = \n|elevation_ft           = \n|postal_code_type       =  <!-- enter ZIP code, Postcode, Post code, Postal code... -->\n|postal_code            = 337000\n|area_code              = 0799\n|iso_code = [[ISO 3166-2:CN|CN-JX-03]]\n|website = {{URL|www.pingxiang.gov.cn/}}\n|footnotes              = \n}}\n\n'''Pingxiang''' ({{zh|s=\u840d\u4e61 |t=\u840d\u9109 |p=P\u00edngxi\u0101ng|w=P'ing-hsiang}}) is a medium-sized [[prefecture-level city]] located in western [[Jiangxi]] province, People's Republic of China.\n\n==Geography and climate==\n\nPingxiang is a limitrophe city between Jiangxi and [[Hunan]] provinces.

During the [[Han dynasty]], it was part of [[Yichun, Jiangxi|Yichun]]. In 267, during the time of the [[Three Kingdoms]], it became Pingxiang County, which made it a higher level of administration than what it is today. During the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907), it was part of the [[Jiangnanxi Circuit]], and was called [[Yuanzhou (modern Jiangxi)|Yuanzhou]]. Its name and area of administration were changed many times until 1970, when it assumed its present form.\n\n==Administration==\n\nPingxiang has direct jurisdiction over two [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban districts]], one economic development area, three [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]], 28 towns, 18 townships, and 7 sub-districts.\n\n'''Urban districts''': \n*[[Anyuan District]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5b89\u6e90\u533a}})\n*[[Xiangdong District]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6e58\u4e1c\u533a}})\n*[[Anyuan Economic Development Zone]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5b89\u6e90\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5f00\u53d1\u533a}})\n\n'''Counties''':\n*[[Shangli County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4e0a\u6817\u53bf}})\n*[[Luxi County, Jiangxi|Luxi County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u82a6\u6eaa\u53bf}})\n*[[Lianhua County]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u83b2\u82b1\u53bf}})\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n!colspan=\"6\"| Map\n|-\n|colspan=\"6\" rowspan=\"11\"| <div style=\"position: relative\" class=\"center\">\n{{Image label begin|image=Administrative Division Pingxiang.png|width=300|link=}} \n{{Image label|x=290|y=450|scale=300/750|text=[[Anyuan District|'''Anyuan''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=90|y=580|scale=300/750|text=[[Xiangdong District|'''Xiangdong''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=240|y=240|scale=300/750|text=[[Shangli County|'''Shangli<br>County''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=500|y=500|scale=300/750|text=[[Luxi County, Jiangxi|'''Luxi<br>County''']]}}\n{{Image label|x=340|y=870|scale=300/750|text=[[Lianhua County|'''Lianhua<br>County''']]}}\n|}\n\n==Demographics==\nThe population of the total administrative area of Pingxiang was estimated to be 1,874,000 at the 2012 census.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Economy==\n\nIn 2013, the [[GDP]] was 79.2 billion RMB, an 8.2% growth over the previous year. Rural income was 11,100 RMB, a 10.5% growth over 2012 and urban income was 23,489 RMB, an 11% growth over 2012 (without regard to inflation).\n\n==Resources==\nPingxiang has abundant water and mineral resources. Five rivers flow across the land which delivers approximately 2.626 billion cubic meters per year. Coal, iron ore, limestone, kaolin and granite are the most abundant minerals of the city. Even today, the ''Pingxiangren'' or local people proudly refer to their city as the \"coal center of southern China.\"\n\n==Transportation==\nPingxiang is a regional hub for transportation. It is about 1.5 hrs drive to the CSX from downtown of Pingxiang. A couple of highways and the main rail line between Changsha and Nanchang run through the city. The city has had a high-speed railway since September 2014.\n\n==Tourism==\nWugong (also known as WooKong) mountain is a national well known place for tourism. It lies in the east of Pingxiang, 45 minutes from downtown. The highest altitude is 1,918 meters while the average altitude is about 1,500 meters. Most of the landscape remains virginal in despite of some necessary infrastructures that benefit tourists.\n\nYangqi mountain is famous for the religion of Buddhism, lies in north of Pingxiang, one hour's drive from downtown.\n\nNielongdong (also known as Sinful Dragon Cave) has a tale which refers to Chinese traditional religion and zodiac. This beautiful area is only twenty minutes north.\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Pingxiang, Jiangxi}}\n*[http://www.pingxiang.gov.cn/ Official website (Chinese)]\n\n{{Jiangxi topics}}\n{{Jiangxi}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Jiangxi]]\n[[Category:Prefecture-level divisions of Jiangxi]]\n", "name_user": "CaradhrasAiguo", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingxiang"}

New Zealand is the southwestern corner of the [[Polynesian Triangle]], a region of the Pacific Ocean with three island groups at its corners: [[Hawaiian Islands]], Rapa Nui ([[Easter Island]]), and New Zealand ([[Aotearoa]] in M\u0101ori).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.maori.com/aotearoa|title=Aotearoa \u2013 The Maori Name for New Zealand|publisher=Maori Tourism Limited|work=www.maori.com|language=en-NZ|access-date=2017-07-27}}</ref> The many island cultures within the Polynesian Triangle share similar languages derived from a [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|proto-Malayo-Polynesian language]] used in southeastern Asia 5,000 years ago.

Other main Polynesian cultures include: [[Easter Island|Rapa Nui]] (now known as Easter Island), [[Hawaii]], [[Marquesas]], [[Samoa]], [[Tahiti]], [[Tonga]], and [[Cook Islands]]. Over the last five millennia, a sequence of complicated and remarkable transoceanic treks were performed in an unprecedented accomplishment of navigation and curiosity. The final segments of these feats were across extreme and unmatched distances: to Hawaii, Rapa Nui, and Aotearoa.<ref>{{cite book|last=Somerville|first=Alice Te Punga|title=Once Were Pacific: Maori Connections to Oceania|year=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|page=17}}</ref>\n\nPolynesian seafarers were ocean navigators and [[astronomy|astronomers]]. Polynesians would travel long distances by sea. The strong female presence among early settlers in New Zealand suggests Polynesian migration voyages were not accidental but deliberate.

Many edible plants were brought from the home islands and of these [[Sweet potato|''k\u016bmara'' (sweet potato)]] was to become the most important. In the far South, however, it was too cold to grow any of these crops. Large quantities of [[Cordyline australis|t\u012b]] tubers were eaten that were slow-cooked in large {{lang|mi|umu}} or {{lang|mi|[[h\u0101ngi]]}} (earth ovens) to get rid of the poison and to produce a slightly sweet pulp. Shellfish, fish, sharks and seals were also common foods. Native dogs ({{lang|mi|kur\u012b}}) and rats were brought from the Pacific Islands. The introduction of rats undoubtedly had more impact on New Zealand wildlife than any other organism apart from humans.<ref name=\"campbell&hutchings\" /> The dogs were used for hunting but also as food.<ref>Irwin pp 10\u201314.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe new environment offered challenges to the settlers. Its cold climate meant that tropical staple crops needed careful cultivation to survive, and some failed to grow locally. [[Sweet potato|K\u016bmara]] was an important crop that arrived with the Polynesian settlers. Much of the activity to produce k\u016bmara became ritualised \u2013 it was even associated with Rongom\u0101t\u0101ne (Rongo), a high-ranking {{lang|mi|atua}} (god).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/kumara/page-4|title=K\u016bmara \u2013 Religious aspects|last=Adds|first=Peter|encyclopedia=Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=1 November 2013}}</ref> K\u016bmara featured in some {{lang|mi|whakatauk\u012b}} (proverbs): \"{{lang|mi|Kaore te k\u016bmara e k\u014drero mo t\u014dna m\u0101ngaro}}\" (the k\u016bmara does not speak of its own sweetness) encouraged people to be modest.\n\nSeasonal activities included gardening, fishing and the hunting of birds.

Missionaries report being appalled at the violent, seemingly arbitrary nature of M\u0101ori behaviour. This included warfare, slavery, cannibalism, sexual abuse of women, killing of female children and revenge killings. However, by 1840, many of these customs were all but abolished or not publicly practised.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=220}}\n\nIn the coastal South Island, the M\u0101ori population was very small. Whalers set up shore stations along the southern and eastern coasts and formed M\u0101ori\u2013European working communities. In the early 1800s, it was common for chiefs to provide whalers with M\u0101ori wives, often their daughters. By the 1820s, European men had married about 200 M\u0101ori women in the coastal area between modern Christchurch and Invercargill, about half of all the marriageable aged women in the South Island \u2013 in fact, M\u0101ori men were finding it hard to compete for wives.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=320}}\n\nContact with Europeans enabled M\u0101ori to access the material culture of England, then the most advanced industrial nation in the world. By 1800, the desire for iron objects such as large ships' nails overcame apprehension about boarding an anchored ship and this drove M\u0101ori trading behaviour, lasting until 1840.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=32}} Desirable steel objects and blankets were at first traded for fish. M\u0101ori were generally very curious about European culture after initial misunderstandings and apprehension, with M\u0101ori showing great ability to accept changes and integrating these into their normal way of life{{sfn|O'Malley|2012}}<ref>''Climates of War''. E. Bohan. p 29</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} Marion Du Fresne gave northern M\u0101ori potatoes, wheat, onions, goats, pigs, chickens and other food to raise. Potatoes and pigs rapidly became a key part of M\u0101ori agriculture in the north, but the new food was almost exclusively reserved for trading purposes, with M\u0101ori still eating fish and fern roots, supplemented by [[k\u016bmara]]. Later, as M\u0101ori grew large areas of potatoes (Hongi Hika had a 40-acre potato field), whalers would call into the Bay of Islands, in particular, to trade for fresh supplies.\n\nOne significant change was the immediacy of reciprocation in trade. In tradition M\u0101ori tikanga, when an item was given there was no expectation of immediate response as gifted items were mainly food, which was governed by seasonal supply. When dealing with Europeans, M\u0101ori learnt that immediate payment was expected. Gift giving was a different matter in M\u0101ori culture. Gifts were given to recognise {{lang|mi|mana}} (power or authority).{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=112}}\n\nBurial practices also changed to incorporate aspects of Christianity. Bodies were usually buried in the ground by the mid 1840s although sometimes coffins, decorated with M\u0101ori motifs were used, suspended in trees or on poles as drawn by J. Polack.

In 1900 few M\u0101ori lived in European urban settlements. This changed very slowly. There were only 1,766 M\u0101ori in Auckland in 1935. In 1936 only 11.2% of M\u0101ori lived in urban areas. By 1945 this had risen to 19% and by 1971 to 68%. These changes reflect a significant alteration in the basis for income and employment \u2013 from working on rural land to working mainly in construction, freezing works or labouring. The dominant factors influencing this shift were the burgeoning M\u0101ori population and the inability of the land to support the increasing population.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, MP Ngata had passed land legislation to help M\u0101ori make better use of their remaining tribal land. M\u0101ori were handicapped in using and developing the land for modern agriculture as much M\u0101ori land was steep, remote, erosion-prone with high rainfall.{{sfn|King|2001|pages=101\u2013107}} European farmers who owned their land freehold mechanised to gain higher productivity, using bank loans for the new equipment. M\u0101ori were unable to gain loans as their land was generally tribal land and could not be used for securing individual loans. Leasing land to European farmers gave M\u0101ori a steady income but this was spread among many people. M\u0101ori farming was often based on a different system of values and not driven by European goals of efficiency and high productivity.{{sfn|King|2001|page=103}}\n\nApart from jobs, another attraction to urban migration were the monetary, recreational and lifestyle attractions of the city. Many M\u0101ori felt that success lay in the city rather than the country. King describes this as a \"fantasy contagion-the realty did not live up to the myth but this did not stop the fantasy or the migration\".{{sfn|King|2001|page=104}}\nOther changes were a rising birth rate. In 1955, the M\u0101ori birth rate was nearly double the European rate at 43.6 compared to 26 per 1000. At the same time, M\u0101ori had fewer qualifications. In 1956 6.5% of M\u0101ori held professional, managerial or clerical jobs compared to 26.7% non-M\u0101ori. As a result, only 3.36% of M\u0101ori earned 700 pounds or more per annum compared to 18.6% for non-M\u0101ori.{{sfn|King|2001|page=105}} M\u0101ori were significantly impacted by changing economic circumstances such as the drop in wool prices. This made M\u0101ori more vulnerable to economic and social deprivation. King says that the lower M\u0101ori educational attainment lead to lower income jobs, which led to lower income, poor housing, and poor health, which in turn led to higher rates of crime.{{sfn|King|2001|page=105}}\n\nThese ingredients were potential causes of racial tension. They were seen by the wider community as \"M\u0101ori problems\". By the 1970s and 1980s, enough urbanised M\u0101ori had reached positions of influence to bring about a gradual but radical change to the thinking of governments. Their advocacy was underscored by an increasing willingness to use [[M\u0101ori protest movement|vigorous protest to push Mana M\u0101ori]].

The expression, an abstraction of the word for aristocracy, had been coined by Henry Williams in the Treaty of Waitangi to convey the idea of \"chieftainship\". However, the term was often used by M\u0101ori to express the idea of political rights for all M\u0101ori, not just the {{lang|mi|rangatira}} class, or the idea of M\u0101ori sovereignty or M\u0101ori independence.\n\nEducated urban M\u0101ori advocated the teaching of M\u0101ori language and the inclusion of a M\u0101ori point of view in all aspects of education. M\u0101ori began to express their ideas in new political movements with M\u0101ori voters switching from supporting the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour party]] to alternatives such as the M\u0101ori lead [[New Zealand First|New Zealand First party]] in 1992. The introduction of [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] (Mixed Member Proportional) elections in 1996 had the effect of giving minority groups of any shades, more influence.

Mana is sacred power bestowed by the gods on the ancestral lineage of chiefs, or {{lang|mi|tohunga}}. While the {{lang|mi|mana}} itself is a supernatural gift, the chief is free to waste or magnify it.{{sfn|Mol|1981|page=15}} Historian Judith Binney says that maintaining and increasing the {{lang|mi|mana}} of {{lang|mi|whanau}} and {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} and loyalty within the group is unquestionably at the heart of M\u0101ori cultural concepts. She says that M\u0101ori cultural history is confusing to the uninformed as it consists of narrative-myths that stretch far back in time. Also confusing is that chronological time is irrelevant or distorted<ref>Stories Without End. J. Binney, p 182</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} to the M\u0101ori cultural story, so a person living in the present may narrate a story about their family or hap\u016b that happened centuries ago; nonetheless, the narrator appears as a contemporary figure in the myth.\n\nA key element of cultural leadership is to link the narrator to a well known historical figure with mana (prestige/authority power).<ref>Stories Without End, J Binney, pp. 78\u201385</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} This is why being able to recite the family history is so important. In M\u0101ori culture names of people and places are fluid. Individuals may change their name several times or have several different names that they use depending on the cultural situation. In the past, hap\u016b changed names if they moved to another area where an alternative name was more positive. One of the main reasons for name fluidity was access to resources. As a hap\u016b moved seasonally to utilise different resources its name changed to reflect an ancestor who had historical-cultural rights to that resource. Binney says that being connected to a powerful hap\u016b with many well-known ancestors was important for protection and survival. As M\u0101ori communication was almost totally oral until well into the contact period, oral myth-narratives became more varied to match the needs of each hap\u016b or whanau.\n\n=== {{lang|mi|Whakapapa}} (genealogy) ===\n{{lang|mi|[[Whakapapa]]}} is the origin and path of descent of a person, object or geographic area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/whakapapa-genealogy|title=Whakapapa \u2013 genealogy \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|last=Taonga|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-12}}</ref> A person's {{lang|mi|whakapapa}} establishes their mana and tribal connections.

In the context of a gift exchange, {{lang|mi|utu}} creates and preserves social connections and commitments. {{lang|mi|Utu}} recovers balance in the event that social relations are interrupted. A version of {{lang|mi|utu}}, {{lang|mi|muru}}, is defined as the confiscation of a person's possessions as reparation for a misdeed against an individual, community, or society.<ref>\"The Boyd Incident,\" Ministry for Culture and Heritage, 20 December 2012, retrieved on 10 April 2018.</ref>{{cnf|January 2020}}\n\nGift exchange was governed by three basic principles. Firstly giving had to have the appearance of being free and spontaneous, without stipulation of a return present. Secondly, a strict system of obligation was in force whereby the receiver was bound to not only reciprocate but to increase the value of the reciprocated gift. Thirdly the system demanded that further social obligation had now been established to continue the exchanges. Failure to respond meant loss of mana or influence. Where parties had travelled a long way to give a present it was expected that the return gift be immediate but often due to seasonal food supplies it was accepted that a return gift would be given at some later date when supplies allowed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Firth|first=R.|title=Primitive Economics of the New Zealand Maori|year=1929}}</ref> While a gift conveyed an obligation to return the favour, so did an insult.

A {{lang|mi|marae}} is the centre for much of M\u0101ori community life. Generally the [[M\u0101ori language]] is used in ceremonies and speeches, although translations and explanations are provided when the primary participants are not M\u0101ori speakers. Increasingly, New Zealand schools and universities have their own {{lang|mi|marae}} to facilitate the teaching of M\u0101ori language and culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tourism.net.nz/new-zealand/about-new-zealand/maori-culture.html|title=Maori Culture New Zealand, Maori Culture, Traditions and Tourism|last=Guide|first=New Zealand Tourism|website=www.tourism.net.nz|language=en|access-date=2017-07-27}}</ref>\n\nThe {{lang|mi|marae}} is a communal ceremonial centre where meetings and ceremonies take place in accordance with traditional protocols. The {{lang|mi|marae}} symbolises group unity and generally consists of an open cleared area in front of a large carved meeting house, along with a dining hall and other facilities necessary to provide a comfortable stay for visiting groups. On the {{lang|mi|marae}} official functions take place including formal welcomes, celebrations, weddings, christenings, reunions, and {{lang|mi|[[tangihanga]]}} (funerals). The older people have the authority on the {{lang|mi|marae}}, and they impart, primarily through [[oral tradition]], traditions and cultural practices to the young people. These include [[genealogy]], [[spirituality]], [[Public speaking|oratory]], and politics, and arts such as [[music composition]], performance, [[weaving]], or carving.\n\nThe {{lang|mi|hui}} or meeting, usually on a marae. It begins with a {{lang|mi|[[p\u014dwhiri]]}} (a welcoming ceremony). If a visitor is noteworthy, he or she may be welcomed with an aggressive challenge by a warrior armed with a {{lang|mi|[[taiaha]]}} (traditional fighting staff), who then offers a token of peace, such as a fern frond, to the visitor. Acceptance of the token in the face of such aggression is a demonstration of the courage and {{lang|mi|[[mana]]}} of the visitor. The {{lang|mi|p\u014dwhiri}} is highly structured, with speeches from both hosts and guests following a traditional format, their sequence dictated by the {{lang|mi|kawa}} (protocol) of that place, and followed by {{lang|mi|[[M\u0101ori music|waiata]]}}, songs. {{lang|mi|Hui}} are held for business, for festivities or for rites of passage such as baptism, marriage and death.

The {{lang|mi|h\u0101ngi}} consists of a shallow hole dug in the ground, in which a fire is prepared and stones are placed on the top. When the stones are hot, prepared food is placed on top of them, meat first and then vegetables such as k\u016bmara, potatoes and pumpkin. The {{lang|mi|h\u0101ngi}} is then covered with leaves or mats woven out of {{lang|mi|[[Phormium tenax|harakeke]]}}, or wet sacks, and soil is then heaped over the {{lang|mi|h\u0101ngi}} to seal in the heat to cook the food.\n\n=== {{lang|mi|Marae}} events ===\nLike in pre-European times, {{lang|mi|marae}} continue to be the location of many ceremonial events, including birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries.

As indicated by Ka'ai and Higgins, \"the importance of the {{lang|mi|tangihanga}} and its central place in {{lang|mi|marae}} custom is reflected in the fact that it takes precedence over any other gathering on the {{lang|mi|marae}}\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Ki te whaiao: An introduction to M\u0101ori culture and society|last1=Ka'ai|first1=T.

It is normal for M\u0101ori to travel very long distances to attend the {{lang|mi|tangi}} of a loved one. Often black clothes are worn, following Victorian practices. Guests will speak formally about the deceased on the {{lang|mi|marae atea}} often referring to tribal history and using humour. Pathos is commonly used to create a feeling of comfort and unity. Speeches are supported by {{lang|mi|waiata}} (songs). The {{lang|mi|whanau}} of the deceased sit by the coffin on the {{lang|mi|wharenui}} porch but do not speak or reply. The family may often hold or display photos of the deceased or important ancestors. A {{lang|mi|tangi}} may go on for several days, especially for a person of great {{lang|mi|mana}}.

Oratory, the making of speeches, is especially important in the rituals of encounter, and it is regarded as important for a speaker to include allusions to traditional narrative and to a complex system of proverbial sayings, called {{lang|mi|whakatauk\u012b}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.korero.maori.nz/forlearners/proverbs.html|title=Whakatauk\u012b \u2013 Proverbs|work=korero.maori.nz website}}</ref> Oral traditions include songs, calls, chants, {{lang|mi|haka}} and formalised speech patterns that recall the history of the people.\n\n=== Other traditional buildings ===\n[[File:Pataka.jpg|thumb|{{lang|mi|Pataka}} with {{lang|mi|[[tekoteko]]}}|alt=|260x260px]]\n[[File:Maori Village.jpg|thumb|A M\u0101ori village, {{circa|late 1800s}}|alt=|260x260px]]\nThe standard building in a classic M\u0101ori settlement was a simple sleeping {{lang|mi|whare puni}} (house/hut) about 2 metres x 3 metres with a low roof, an earth floor, no window and a single low doorway. Heating was provided by a small open fire in winter. There was no chimney.\n\nMaterial used in construction varied between areas, but raupo reeds, flax and totara bark shingles for the roof were common.<ref>Te Papa Museum of NZ. Wharepuni.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} Similar small {{lang|mi|whare}}, but with interior drains, were used to store k\u016bmara on sloping racks.\n\nIn the classic period a higher proportion of {{lang|mi|whare}} were located inside {{lang|mi|p\u0101}} than was the case after contact with Europeans. A chief's {{lang|mi|whare}} was similar but larger \u2014 often with full headroom in the centre, a small window and a partly enclosed front porch. In times of conflict the chief lived in a {{lang|mi|whare}} on the {{lang|mi|tihi}} or summit of a hill {{lang|mi|p\u0101}}. In colder areas, such as in the North Island central plateau, it was common for {{lang|mi|whare}} to be partly sunk into the ground for better insulation.\n\nFood was not cooked in the sleeping {{lang|mi|whare}} but in the open or under a {{lang|mi|kauta}} (lean-to). Saplings with branches and foliage removed were used to store and dry items such as fishing nets or cloaks. Valuable items were stored in pole-mounted storage shelters called {{lang|mi|pataka}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=John|author-link=John White (ethnographer)|title=The Ancient History of the Maori, His Mythology and Traditions|volume=V1|year=1888|publisher=Pataka.

This practice was done in order to express the buildings' significance and to secure the gods' protection. For smaller buildings, small animals were sacrificed to distinguish it from other buildings and to exhibit its uniqueness.{{sfn|Mol|1981|page=13}}\n\nThe traditional M\u0101ori {{lang|mi|whare}} continued to be used in rural areas in particular well into the post-contact period. They were usually very small with a dirt floor and full of vermin, especially fleas.

Significant finance and {{lang|mi|mana}} was invested in increasingly elaborate meeting houses which became a source of {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} or {{lang|mi|iwi}} pride and prestige.\n\nA meeting house was likely to have outside carvings and increasingly as European tools were used, intricate interior carving and woven panels depicting tribal history. Rotorua became a centre of carving excellence under the encouragement of the M\u0101ori MPs in the Young M\u0101ori party. Itinerant specialist carvers travelled widely, employing their skills in many locations. Meetinghouses became places for tribal celebrations or political meetings, especially after the 1860s Land Wars. They were a place to display largesse and enhance {{lang|mi|mana}} with elaborate feasts and entertainment. By the 20th century {{lang|mi|wharepuni}} were common and averaged 18\u201324m long by 8m wide. There were no M\u0101ori buildings of this size in pre-European days. As M\u0101ori became familiar with European building construction and design they incorporated features such as chimneys and fireplaces and made use of bigger doorways and windows as well as sawn timber but even by the turn of the 19th century toilet facilities were often primitive, despite the urgings of the M\u0101ori MPs Pomare and Ngata who worked hard to improve the standard of M\u0101ori dwellings over their many years in office.{{sfn|King|2001|page=47}}<ref>Maori MPs.NZ History online.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Mythology and religion ==\n{{main|M\u0101ori mythology|M\u0101ori religion|Taniwha}}\n{{Tall image|KupeWheke.jpg|150|300|alt=Tall wooden carving showing Kupe above two tentacled sea creatures|Late 20th-century [[whakairo|carving]] depicting the mythological navigator [[Kupe]] fighting two sea creatures|right}}\nTraditional M\u0101ori religion, has deviated little from its tropical Eastern [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] roots on the island of [[Hawaiki|Hawaiki Nui]].

The early European explorer and painter Earle noted in 1827 that these diseases were common even in isolated inland districts such as Taupo. His M\u0101ori advisers said the diseases were very old.\n\nEarle recognised that {{lang|mi|tohunga}} used a range of plants to treat minor skin ailments. Much later European doctors advocated investigation of the medicinal properties of plants commonly used in M\u0101ori medicine.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Missionaries===\n[[File:Whare Karakia o Onuku.jpg|thumb|Church near Onuku marae, Banks Peninsula. Opened in 1878 as the first non-denominational church in New Zealand.]]\nCMS missionaries insisted M\u0101ori abandon cannibalism and child infanticide before they could be baptised. They tried to discourage polygamy. Some early missionaries had sympathy for abandoned wives but Henry Williams was adamant that polygamy disqualified M\u0101ori from baptism. CMS missionaries also outlawed the use of further {{lang|mi|moko}}, taking part in lewd dances and practising customary funeral rites.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=175}} Catholic missionaries who arrived 20 years after the Church of England CMS missionaries were less concerned with stopping these customary practices before Christian conversion. They reasoned that they could influence M\u0101ori more effectively after baptism and were subsequently successful in attracting many converts in the western Hokianga district, away from the dominant CMS influence.\n\nMissionaries did not arrive in the Waikato until about 1834\u20135. CMS Mission Stations were established at Manakau, Maraetai, Waikato Heads, Kaitotehe opposite Tuapiri, Te Awamutu, Kopua and Kawhia. Missionaries helped explain the Treaty of Waitangi to Tainui in 1840.\n\n=== First M\u0101ori interpretation of Christianity===\nIn the 1830s Te Atua Wera started the Papahurihia Faith in opposition to the missionaries. It mixed Christian, Judaic and M\u0101ori customary influences. They held services on Saturday and called themselves {{lang|mi|Hurai}} or Jews. Te Atua Wera reverted to the more customary role of a {{lang|mi|tohunga}} figure by the late 1830s. Te Atua Wera taught that heaven was a place where there was happiness, no cold or hunger with an abundance of flour, sugar, muskets, ships, murder and voluptuousness.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=175}}\n\n== Children and education ==\n[[File:SwingAngas1847.JPG|thumb|A group of M\u0101ori children on a morere swing (1847)]]\n\n=== Childhood ===\nEarly European reports suggest that M\u0101ori children were indulged and led a carefree and playful life. A French explorer in 1772 commented that \"[the women] seemed to be good mothers and showed affection for their offspring. I have often seen them play with the children, caress them, chew the fern-root, pick at the stringy parts, and then take it out of their mouth to put it into that of their nurslings. The men were also very fond of and kind to their children.\"{{sfn|Salmond|1991|page=422}} French missionary Jean-Simon Bernard wrote, disapprovingly, in 1844: \"The children here are completely free; the parents never do anything to them. They never beat them and do not allow anyone else to beat them.\"{{sfn|Salmond|1991|page=422}} The killing of children could be the ''take'' (cause) of war.

Bishop Selwyn took adult M\u0101ori to Sydney where they experienced limited schooling to learn English. When missionaries back in arrived in the Bay of Islands they realised that if they were going to introduce Christianity and change what they considered to be barbaric practices like cannibalism, slavery, lewd dancing and having multiple wives, they would need to establish schools. Both the missionaries and their wives constructed schools and provided slates and bibles as reading material. The first school was established by T. Kendal in 1816. Recently original slates and written material from that period in the Bay of Islands has been located, photographed and published. Some adults attended school but most pupils were the sons or daughter of chiefs or other persons of status.\n\nBy 1853 Mr and Mrs Ashwell had been running a mission school at Taupiri in the Waikato for 50 M\u0101ori girls for 3 years. The girls learnt arithmetic and reading.<ref>Voyagers.p63. P. Moon. Penguin. 2014.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} In the early 1860s Governor Grey had provided money to support a trade school near Te Awamutu in the Waikato. The aim was to produce M\u0101ori workers who were literate but could also work with, and repair, agricultural machinery as used on farms and in the new flour mills. In 1863 the renegade Rewi Maniapoto attacked and burnt down the school, stealing the printing press. He aimed to kill leading Europeans in the area but they had been warned by friendly M\u0101ori and left before the attack. Because of the negative influence of Maniapoto and other anti-government factions, the school had previously had poor attendance, with as few as 10 boys attending regularly. All teaching by missionaries was in M\u0101ori and this continued in the native schools until 1900 when at the insistence of the Young M\u0101ori Party M\u0101ori MPs, schools started teaching in English. Influential M\u0101ori MPs [[\u0100pirana Ngata|Ngata]] and [[M\u0101ui P\u014dmare|P\u014dmare]] insisted that M\u0101ori be taught modern ways and sponsored the Suppression of Tohungaism Act in parliament. P\u014dmare, in particular, worked hard to banish ancient M\u0101ori concepts and practices that caused harm in the M\u0101ori community.<ref>The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, Maui Pomare.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Food ==\n[[File:Mount hobson Auckland kumara pits.jpg|thumb|Pits where kumara were stored to protect them over the winter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/218774|title=K\u016bmara storage pits, 1930|last=Godber|first=Albert Percy|publisher= New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|work=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref>|alt=|260x260px]]\n[[File:Maori earth oven.svg|thumb|{{lang|mi|H\u0101ngi}} or earth ovens are still used today to cook food|alt=|260x260px]]\n{{See also|M\u0101ori cuisine|H\u0101ngi}}\n\n=== Traditional M\u0101ori foods ===\nEating shellfish such as mussels and oysters was very common. During summer sea fish such as kahawai were caught using bone or {{lang|mi|[[Lygodium articulatum|mangemange]]}} hooks, 2-piece lures or large flax nets. In creeks and lakes, eels were caught in large numbers when migrating along known waterways using {{lang|mi|hinaki}}, a long cone-shaped net. Birds such as ducks were targeted during the moulting season and young birds such as Petrels and Gannets were taken from nests and cooked in their own fat to preserve them. Such preserved birds were favourite gifts to fulfil social gift obligations. M\u0101ori closely observed the natural world to take advantage of seasonal opportunities. Native pigeons ate [[Miro (tree)|miro]] berries which made them thirsty. M\u0101ori carved wooden bowls equipped with multiple neck snares and placed these in miro trees to catch these large birds.\n\nEvidence from many recent Eastern Golden Bay excavations, especially at Tata Beach, shows that in middens local shellfish and fish bones were most prominent, followed by dog ({{lang|mi|kur\u012b}}) bones and rat bones. Less common were bones from small birds and sea mammals. The Tata Beach site and other nearby sites such as Takapou were in use from 1450 up to 1660 AD, well into the Classic period. The coastal sites showed that M\u0101ori had created man-made soils in the sand dunes ranging from small to very large (over 100m<sup>2</sup>). The natural soil A horizons had been modified by placing dark, humus-rich soil near the surface.<ref name=\"gardensofrongo\">{{cite journal|last=Barber|first=Ian|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=53|date=Dec 2012|title=Gardens of Rongo|doi=10.1086/667834}}</ref> This practice was widespread in M\u0101ori communities where k\u016bmara was grown, although in many cases free-draining sand, gravels and pumice were mixed with humus-rich loam. K\u016bmara are slow-growing in the temperate NZ climate and need free-draining subsoils. In the Eastern Golden Bay north-facing slopes were favoured.<ref name=\"gardensofrongo\" />\n\nThe warmer climate of the north and northern and central coastal regions allowed better growth of subtropical plants such as k\u016bmara, yam and gourds. In Auckland, and on Mayor Island, volcanic land was cleared of rocks which were used for low shelter walls. In some areas piles of volcanic rock which kept warm at night, were used to train the vines of gourds.\n\nMany special techniques had been devised to grow and especially to store k\u016bmara so it did not rot. Careful storage and use of {{lang|mi|tapu}} was essential to prevent unauthorised use. Seed k\u016bmara in particular were highly {{lang|mi|tapu}}. The main problem for k\u016bmara growers were native caterpillars. Early European explorers reported that M\u0101ori often ringed a garden with burning vegetation in an attempt to control caterpillars. M\u0101ori continued to use traditional fern roots \u2014 {{lang|mi|aruhe}} \u2014 as a normal part of their diet into the mid-19th century.\n\n=== Introduced foods ===\nThe introduction of European foods changed many aspects of M\u0101ori agriculture. Under tradition, M\u0101ori agriculture land was abandoned after a few crops because of reduced production. This was the common pattern apart from a few very fertile alluvial river valleys. Fertiliser was not used{{sfn|Belgrave|2013|page=110}} although M\u0101ori had devised various techniques to enhance production such as the addition of pumice or similar materials to improve drainage on heavy soils. M\u0101ori allowed gardens to revert to shrubs and plantations were shifted to another area. The introduction of foreign weeds which thrived was a significant issue from the 1820s but offset by the widespread growth of the introduced potato, the traditional varieties of which are still grown and known as {{lang|mi|taewa}} or [[M\u0101ori potatoes]].\n\nEuropean farms and the methods they used became a cultural and economic magnet for M\u0101ori{{sfn|Belgrave|2013|page=110}} in the North, in Auckland and later in the Te Awamutu area of the Waikato. Under the tuition of missionaries, M\u0101ori learnt to mass-produce food, especially potatoes, far in excess of their own needs for trading into the late 1850s. In 1858 European numbers equalled M\u0101ori numbers and increasingly European farmers were able to supply towns such as Auckland. At the same time the strong market demand for supplying food to the gold rush markets in Australia and California ended.\n\n== Trade and travel ==\n\n===Transport===\n{{main|Waka (canoe)}}\n[[File:Abaconda New Zealand maori waka.jpg|thumb|{{lang|mi|[[Waka (canoe)|Waka]]}} (canoes) are built in a variety of sizes depending on their purpose, including deep-sea fishing, river crossings or historically war and migration.]]\nThe normal M\u0101ori method of travel was on foot. The North Island had an extensive network of single lane one metre wide tracks that traversed beaches, plains, valleys and mountain passes. Some of these tracks were used by many {{lang|mi|iwi}} and were considered neutral territory. Missionaries who travelled with M\u0101ori guides found that at river crossings canoes were left for the use of any traveller.<ref>Tainui. L. Kelly.2002.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} Between 1840 and 1850 numbers of explorers, artists, government officials including Governor Grey travelled inland with the aid of M\u0101ori guides. The guides carried heavy loads and would carry Europeans across creeks. Crossing swamps was common. Although they carried some food they relied on purchasing basic foodstuffs such as potatoes or native pigeons from M\u0101ori settlements. The most popular payment was in tobacco which was in great demand. In more remote areas travellers sometimes found M\u0101ori living by themselves and growing a few potatoes.<ref>Voyages. P. Moon. Penguin. 2014.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\nCanoes ({{lang|mi|[[waka (canoe)|waka]]}}) were used extensively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/waka-canoes/page-1|title=Waka \u2013 canoes |work=Te Ara}}</ref> These ranged from small river-going boats, to the large {{lang|mi|waka taua}} sea-going war vessels carrying up to 80 paddlers, and up to {{convert|40|m|ft}} long.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/waka-canoes/3|title=Waka taua|work=Te Ara}}</ref> Waka were used extensively for long-range travel down the east coast and to cross Cook Strait. In 1822\u201323 [[Te Rauparah\u0101]], who had established a base by capturing Kapiti Island, reconnoitred the upper South Island in waka before launching a seaborne invasion the following year against Ng\u0101i Tahu and Rangit\u0101ne iwi. Te Rauparah\u0101 later hired a European ship to attack Akaroa Harbour.{{sfn|King|2003}} This showed that Te Rauparaha was prepared to use Western technology to further his own  goals. [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]], who followed several war parties, reported as many as 50 waka taua travelling together at one time, although he reported they only went out to sea in relatively calm weather. From 1835 large numbers of European ships entered the Bay of Islands every year with Henry Williams reporting an average of 70\u201380 ships per year. Many M\u0101ori men worked on the ships, with a reported average of eight M\u0101ori seamen per whaling ship. Ten metre long whaleboats began to be used by M\u0101ori. They could be both rowed and sailed.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012}} In the 1850s as M\u0101ori with the active encouragement of Grey embraced trade were gradually able to develop a large fleet of small trading schooners and similar craft. All the initial European centres had been supported by Maori.\n\n[[File:Maori war canoe, drawing by Alexander Sporing.jpg|thumb|Maori war canoe, drawing by Alexander Sporing, [[First voyage of James Cook|Cook's first voyage]], 1769]]\nDuring the mid 19th century Auckland and Northland M\u0101ori dominated shipping trade. In 1851 51 vessels were registered and 30 smaller vessels licensed. By 1857 there were 37 schooners. The fleet increased steadily during the Tasman trade boom of 1853\u201356. M\u0101ori paid customs duties to the government and invested heavily in vessels, so suffered considerably when a dramatic market slump hit New Zealand especially effecting the Auckland\u2013Waikato\u2013Hauraki area.<ref>Climates of War. E. Bohan. pp 36\u201337.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} During the musket war period and for a time afterwards, Maori, isolated from their tribal support by these devastating conflicts, hid in isolated places, living off patches of vegetables they grew in tiny gardens. This practice was very common in Taranaki which had been devastated by Waikato attacks in particular. European explorers, such as Dieffenbach, often stumbled upon these survivors while exploring. He described these {{lang|mi|whare}} as hotbeds for rats and vermin.<ref>P. Moon. p. 111. 2014.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Trade===\nWith the arrival of Europeans M\u0101ori gradually started to trust the value of British money and use it as a medium of exchange instead of goods. This was rare before 1834 but became increasingly common as more M\u0101ori worked as sailors on European ships, where they gained a good reputation as being strong capable workers.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=West|first=Jonathan|title=The Face of Nature: An Environmental History of the Otago Peninsula|date=March 2018|publisher=[[University of Otago|Otago University]] Press|isbn=978-1-92732238-3|location=Dunedin|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Az_ltwEACAAJ&dq=face+of+nature}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/economic-history/page-2|title=2. \u2013 Economic history \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref>\n\nBy 1839 a large proportion of the M\u0101ori trade in goods was paid for in cash, with M\u0101ori showing a strong preference for coins rather than paper banknotes. Northern M\u0101ori learnt that they could more easily hide cash from their relatives avoiding the traditional obligatory sharing of goods with their {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}}. The period 1835 to 1840 completed the revolution in the north M\u0101ori economy with M\u0101ori abandoning many of their former trading habits and adopting those of the Europeans to the point where M\u0101ori became dependent on the flow of European goods to maintain their new way of life.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|pages=130\u2013135}}\n \nThe effect of trading increased the influence of chiefs over their {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}}. Northern traders assumed that the chief was the organisational head of the {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} and all trade went through him including payments for goods purchased. This gave chiefs much more influence, especially after 1835, because trade was so regular. In pre-contact times the power of chiefs was never very great, largely being restricted to directing warfare.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=203}} Early European observers noted that at {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} and {{lang|mi|whanuau hui}} (meetings) every person, including women, had their say and the chief had no more influence than any other person on the final decision. Where a chief had great {{lang|mi|mana}}, especially powers of persuasion, chiefs had more influence because of their personality rather than any recognised authority.\n \nNot all {{lang|mi|iwi}} had regular contact with Europeans. The French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville visited Tasman Bay in 1827 and using knowledge he had picked up at the Bay of Islands was able to communicate with local M\u0101ori. He found that although they had some passing awareness of Europeans\u2014they seemed to know about firearms\u2014the extent of their understanding was far less than that of the Northern M\u0101ori.{{sfn|Moon|2012|page=128}}\n\nIn the Waikato regular contact did not start until five decades after contact in the north of New Zealand. It was not until Ng\u0101ti Toa was forced out of Kawhia in 1821 that the bulk of the Tainui people had contact with Europeans. In 1823 a man called Te Puaha visited the Bay of Islands, bringing back with him Captain Kent who arrived by ship at Kawhia.\n\nBy 1859 trade was the main area in which M\u0101ori interacted with Europeans. Trade was an area that M\u0101ori expected to control. From first contact, they had sold or exchanged fresh foodstuffs initially for high-value goods such as axes and later for money. George Grey was keen to encourage M\u0101ori trade and commerce and established new laws to empower them in 1846. M\u0101ori brought numerous cases under this legislation and won. This was their first and most successful legal experience.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burke|first=E.|title=Climates of War|year=2005|publisher=Hazard Press|page=36}}</ref> M\u0101ori had begun to include European concepts into their own cultural behaviour. In 1886 banknotes were printed (but not issued) by Te Peeke o Aotearoa, a bank established by [[T\u0101whiao]] the [[M\u0101ori King Movement|M\u0101ori King]]. The text on these notes was M\u0101ori and there was also a picture of a flax bush. The bank's cheques had M\u0101ori figures and native birds and plants drawn on them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/213266|title=1. \u2013 Coins and banknotes \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Land negotiations ===\n{{main|M\u0101ori Land Court|Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements}}\nThe M\u0101ori relationship with the land is complex. Traditionally the resources the land held were controlled based on systems of {{lang|mi|mana}} (power) and {{lang|mi|whakapapa}} (ancestral right). The land itself was both sacred and abstract. In many cases multiple groups would express a connection with the same important river or mountain. Oral tradition would record the migrations of groups from one area to another and their connection with an ancestral location.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn the early 19th century many Europeans entered into dealings with M\u0101ori to obtain land for their use. In some cases settlers thought they were buying land to obtain equivalent to freehold title under British law; M\u0101ori claimed that the various deeds signed by M\u0101ori were more limited and conditional, stopping short of outright alienation. It has been argued that the use of the word {{lang|mi|tuku}} in deeds, meaning to let or allow or give freely, was not the same as selling. This and other interpretations of early 19th century New Zealand land deals have been the source of much disagreement both within the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] process and outside it.<ref>Waitangi Tribunal, [https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/WT/wt_DOC_68635760/Muriwhenua%20Land.pdf Muriwhenua Land Report], p. 394</ref>{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=147}}\n\nM\u0101ori, especially after 1830, were eager to have Europeans living on their land under their protection so they could benefit from European knowledge and trade. Missionaries on the other hand were keen to buy land so they could grow their own food to make them less dependent on tribal \"protectors\", who sometimes used food supplies to coerce them. Settlers allowed M\u0101ori to stay on the land they had \"bought\" and often continued to give presents to tribal chiefs, often prompted by the chiefs themselves, in order to maintain friendly relationships. These compromises stopped with the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=147}}\n\nAnother reason for M\u0101ori to \"sell\" land to missionaries was to protect the title of the land from other tribal competitors. M\u0101ori who had converted to Christianity wanted to protect their land without resorting to warfare. Some degree of control passed to the missionaries who M\u0101ori trusted to allow them continued access and use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.treatyofwaitangi.net.nz/WhyaTreaty.html|title=The Treaty of Waitangi|website=www.treatyofwaitangi.net.nz|access-date=2017-07-27}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1840 generally, older chiefs were reluctant to sell while younger chiefs were in favour. The situation was complicated as M\u0101ori often had overlapping rights on poorly defined land. The settlers and the government also had very limited access to trained surveyors and even freehold land boundaries were ill-defined. Surveying was a relatively new skill and involved much hard physical work especially in hill country. New farmers were able to purchase a small freehold farm from M\u0101ori on which they established their homestead and farm buildings. They then entered into leases with M\u0101ori owners for much larger areas of land. Short-term leases gave M\u0101ori a powerful position as there was a large demand for grazing land.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe Native Lands Act was a policy enforced by the government in 1865, which allowed the M\u0101ori people to obtain individual titles for their land to sell. This act abolished the traditional shared landholdings and made it easier for European settlers to directly purchase land for themselves.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sorrenson|first=M. P.

These claims against the government were to become a major feature of {{lang|mi|iwi}} politics. Each generation of leaders were judged based on their ability to progress a land claim.{{sfn|Belgrave|2013}}\n\n== Leadership and politics ==\n{{see also|M\u0101ori politics}}\n\n=== M\u0101ori kingship ===\n{{Main|M\u0101ori King Movement}}\nFrom the time of their arrival in New Zealand, M\u0101ori lived in tribes that functioned independently under the leadership of their own chiefs. However, by the 1850s M\u0101ori were faced with increasing numbers of British settlers, political marginalisation and growing demand from the Crown to purchase their lands. From about 1853 M\u0101ori began reviving the ancient tribal {{lang|mi|runanga}} or chiefly war councils where land issues were raised and in May 1854 a large meeting \u2014 attracting as many as 2000 M\u0101ori leaders \u2014 was held at Manawapou in south Taranaki where speakers urged concerted opposition to selling land.{{sfn|Dalton|1967|pages=62\u201363}} Inspired by a trip to England during which he had met [[Queen Victoria]], Te Rauparaha's son, [[Tamihana Te Rauparaha]], used the {{lang|mi|runanga}} to promote the idea of forming a M\u0101ori kingdom, with one king ruling over all tribes.<ref name=\"sinclair\">{{cite book|last=Sinclair|first=Keith|title=A History of New Zealand|publisher=Penguin|year=2000|isbn=978-0-14-029875-8|edition=2000|location=Auckland|pages=115\u2013117}}</ref> The {{lang|mi|kotahitanga}} or unity movement was aimed at bringing to M\u0101ori the unity that was an obvious strength among the Europeans.{{sfn|Dalton|1967|pages=62\u201363}}<ref name=\"sinclair\" /> It was believed that by having a monarch who could claim status similar to that of Queen Victoria, M\u0101ori would be able to deal with [[P\u0101keh\u0101]] (Europeans) on equal footing.

New Zealand is the southwestern corner of the [[Polynesian Triangle]], a region of the Pacific Ocean with three island groups at its corners: [[Hawaiian Islands]], Rapa Nui ([[Easter Island]]), and New Zealand ([[Aotearoa]] in M\u0101ori).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.maori.com/aotearoa|title=Aotearoa \u2013 The Maori Name for New Zealand|publisher=Maori Tourism Limited|work=www.maori.com|language=en-NZ|access-date=2017-07-27}}</ref> The many island cultures within the Polynesian Triangle share similar languages derived from a [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|proto-Malayo-Polynesian language]] used in southeastern Asia 5,000 years ago.

Other main Polynesian cultures include: [[Easter Island|Rapa Nui]] (now known as Easter Island), [[Hawaii]], [[Marquesas]], [[Samoa]], [[Tahiti]], [[Tonga]], and [[Cook Islands]]. Over the last five millennia, a sequence of complicated and remarkable transoceanic treks were performed in an unprecedented accomplishment of navigation and curiosity. The final segments of these feats were across extreme and unmatched distances: to Hawaii, Rapa Nui, and Aotearoa.<ref>{{cite book|last=Somerville|first=Alice Te Punga|title=Once Were Pacific: Maori Connections to Oceania|year=2009|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|page=17}}</ref>\n\nPolynesian seafarers were ocean navigators and [[astronomy|astronomers]].

Many edible plants were brought from the home islands and of these [[Sweet potato|''k\u016bmara'' (sweet potato)]] was to become the most important. In the far South, however, it was too cold to grow any of these crops. Large quantities of [[Cordyline australis|t\u012b]] tubers were eaten that were slow-cooked in large {{lang|mi|umu}} or {{lang|mi|[[h\u0101ngi]]}} (earth ovens) to get rid of the poison and to produce a slightly sweet pulp. Shellfish, fish, sharks and seals were also common foods. Native dogs ({{lang|mi|kur\u012b}}) and rats were brought from the Pacific Islands. The introduction of rats undoubtedly had more impact on New Zealand wildlife than any other organism apart from humans.<ref name=\"campbell&hutchings\" /> The dogs were used for hunting but also as food.<ref>Irwin pp 10\u201314.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe new environment offered challenges to the settlers. Its cold climate meant that tropical staple crops needed careful cultivation to survive, and some failed to grow locally. [[Sweet potato|K\u016bmara]] was an important crop that arrived with the Polynesian settlers. Much of the activity to produce k\u016bmara became ritualised \u2013 it was even associated with Rongom\u0101t\u0101ne (Rongo), a high-ranking {{lang|mi|atua}} (god).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/kumara/page-4|title=K\u016bmara \u2013 Religious aspects|last=Adds|first=Peter|encyclopedia=Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=1 November 2013}}</ref> K\u016bmara featured in some {{lang|mi|whakatauk\u012b}} (proverbs): \"{{lang|mi|Kaore te k\u016bmara e k\u014drero mo t\u014dna m\u0101ngaro}}\" (the k\u016bmara does not speak of its own sweetness) encouraged people to be modest.\n\nSeasonal activities included gardening, fishing and the hunting of birds. Main tasks were segregated for men and women, but there were also a lot of group activities involving food gathering and food cultivation.\n\nThese early colonists explored New Zealand to find suitable stones for tool-making.

In the early 1800s, it was common for chiefs to provide whalers with M\u0101ori wives, often their daughters. By the 1820s, European men had married about 200 M\u0101ori women in the coastal area between modern Christchurch and Invercargill, about half of all the marriageable aged women in the South Island \u2013 in fact, M\u0101ori men were finding it hard to compete for wives.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=320}}\n\nContact with Europeans enabled M\u0101ori to access the material culture of England, then the most advanced industrial nation in the world. By 1800, the desire for iron objects such as large ships' nails overcame apprehension about boarding an anchored ship and this drove M\u0101ori trading behaviour, lasting until 1840.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=32}} Desirable steel objects and blankets were at first traded for fish. M\u0101ori were generally very curious about European culture after initial misunderstandings and apprehension, with M\u0101ori showing great ability to accept changes and integrating these into their normal way of life{{sfn|O'Malley|2012}}<ref>''Climates of War''. E. Bohan. p 29</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} Marion Du Fresne gave northern M\u0101ori potatoes, wheat, onions, goats, pigs, chickens and other food to raise. Potatoes and pigs rapidly became a key part of M\u0101ori agriculture in the north, but the new food was almost exclusively reserved for trading purposes, with M\u0101ori still eating fish and fern roots, supplemented by [[k\u016bmara]]. Later, as M\u0101ori grew large areas of potatoes (Hongi Hika had a 40-acre potato field), whalers would call into the Bay of Islands, in particular, to trade for fresh supplies.\n\nOne significant change was the immediacy of reciprocation in trade. In tradition M\u0101ori tikanga, when an item was given there was no expectation of immediate response as gifted items were mainly food, which was governed by seasonal supply. When dealing with Europeans, M\u0101ori learnt that immediate payment was expected. Gift giving was a different matter in M\u0101ori culture. Gifts were given to recognise {{lang|mi|mana}} (power or authority).{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=112}}\n\nBurial practices also changed to incorporate aspects of Christianity. Bodies were usually buried in the ground by the mid 1840s although sometimes coffins, decorated with M\u0101ori motifs were used, suspended in trees or on poles as drawn by J. Polack.

In 1900 few M\u0101ori lived in European urban settlements. This changed very slowly. There were only 1,766 M\u0101ori in Auckland in 1935. In 1936 only 11.2% of M\u0101ori lived in urban areas. By 1945 this had risen to 19% and by 1971 to 68%. These changes reflect a significant alteration in the basis for income and employment \u2013 from working on rural land to working mainly in construction, freezing works or labouring. The dominant factors influencing this shift were the burgeoning M\u0101ori population and the inability of the land to support the increasing population.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, MP Ngata had passed land legislation to help M\u0101ori make better use of their remaining tribal land. M\u0101ori were handicapped in using and developing the land for modern agriculture as much M\u0101ori land was steep, remote, erosion-prone with high rainfall.{{sfn|King|2001|pages=101\u2013107}} European farmers who owned their land freehold mechanised to gain higher productivity, using bank loans for the new equipment. M\u0101ori were unable to gain loans as their land was generally tribal land and could not be used for securing individual loans. Leasing land to European farmers gave M\u0101ori a steady income but this was spread among many people. M\u0101ori farming was often based on a different system of values and not driven by European goals of efficiency and high productivity.{{sfn|King|2001|page=103}}\n\nApart from jobs, another attraction to urban migration were the monetary, recreational and lifestyle attractions of the city. Many M\u0101ori felt that success lay in the city rather than the country. King describes this as a \"fantasy contagion-the realty did not live up to the myth but this did not stop the fantasy or the migration\".{{sfn|King|2001|page=104}}\nOther changes were a rising birth rate. In 1955, the M\u0101ori birth rate was nearly double the European rate at 43.6 compared to 26 per 1000. At the same time, M\u0101ori had fewer qualifications. In 1956 6.5% of M\u0101ori held professional, managerial or clerical jobs compared to 26.7% non-M\u0101ori. As a result, only 3.36% of M\u0101ori earned 700 pounds or more per annum compared to 18.6% for non-M\u0101ori.{{sfn|King|2001|page=105}} M\u0101ori were significantly impacted by changing economic circumstances such as the drop in wool prices. This made M\u0101ori more vulnerable to economic and social deprivation. King says that the lower M\u0101ori educational attainment lead to lower income jobs, which led to lower income, poor housing, and poor health, which in turn led to higher rates of crime.{{sfn|King|2001|page=105}}\n\nThese ingredients were potential causes of racial tension. They were seen by the wider community as \"M\u0101ori problems\". By the 1970s and 1980s, enough urbanised M\u0101ori had reached positions of influence to bring about a gradual but radical change to the thinking of governments. Their advocacy was underscored by an increasing willingness to use [[M\u0101ori protest movement|vigorous protest to push Mana M\u0101ori]].

The expression, an abstraction of the word for aristocracy, had been coined by Henry Williams in the Treaty of Waitangi to convey the idea of \"chieftainship\". However, the term was often used by M\u0101ori to express the idea of political rights for all M\u0101ori, not just the {{lang|mi|rangatira}} class, or the idea of M\u0101ori sovereignty or M\u0101ori independence.\n\nEducated urban M\u0101ori advocated the teaching of M\u0101ori language and the inclusion of a M\u0101ori point of view in all aspects of education. M\u0101ori began to express their ideas in new political movements with M\u0101ori voters switching from supporting the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour party]] to alternatives such as the M\u0101ori lead [[New Zealand First|New Zealand First party]] in 1992. The introduction of [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] (Mixed Member Proportional) elections in 1996 had the effect of giving minority groups of any shades, more influence.

Mana is sacred power bestowed by the gods on the ancestral lineage of chiefs, or {{lang|mi|tohunga}}. While the {{lang|mi|mana}} itself is a supernatural gift, the chief is free to waste or magnify it.{{sfn|Mol|1981|page=15}} Historian Judith Binney says that maintaining and increasing the {{lang|mi|mana}} of {{lang|mi|whanau}} and {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} and loyalty within the group is unquestionably at the heart of M\u0101ori cultural concepts. She says that M\u0101ori cultural history is confusing to the uninformed as it consists of narrative-myths that stretch far back in time. Also confusing is that chronological time is irrelevant or distorted<ref>Stories Without End. J. Binney, p 182</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} to the M\u0101ori cultural story, so a person living in the present may narrate a story about their family or hap\u016b that happened centuries ago; nonetheless, the narrator appears as a contemporary figure in the myth.\n\nA key element of cultural leadership is to link the narrator to a well known historical figure with mana (prestige/authority power).<ref>Stories Without End, J Binney, pp. 78\u201385</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} This is why being able to recite the family history is so important. In M\u0101ori culture names of people and places are fluid. Individuals may change their name several times or have several different names that they use depending on the cultural situation. In the past, hap\u016b changed names if they moved to another area where an alternative name was more positive. One of the main reasons for name fluidity was access to resources. As a hap\u016b moved seasonally to utilise different resources its name changed to reflect an ancestor who had historical-cultural rights to that resource. Binney says that being connected to a powerful hap\u016b with many well-known ancestors was important for protection and survival. As M\u0101ori communication was almost totally oral until well into the contact period, oral myth-narratives became more varied to match the needs of each hap\u016b or whanau.\n\n=== {{lang|mi|Whakapapa}} (genealogy) ===\n{{lang|mi|[[Whakapapa]]}} is the origin and path of descent of a person, object or geographic area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/whakapapa-genealogy|title=Whakapapa \u2013 genealogy \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|last=Taonga|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-12}}</ref> A person's {{lang|mi|whakapapa}} establishes their mana and tribal connections.

In the context of a gift exchange, {{lang|mi|utu}} creates and preserves social connections and commitments. {{lang|mi|Utu}} recovers balance in the event that social relations are interrupted. A version of {{lang|mi|utu}}, {{lang|mi|muru}}, is defined as the confiscation of a person's possessions as reparation for a misdeed against an individual, community, or society.<ref>\"The Boyd Incident,\" Ministry for Culture and Heritage, 20 December 2012, retrieved on 10 April 2018.</ref>{{cnf|January 2020}}\n\nGift exchange was governed by three basic principles. Firstly giving had to have the appearance of being free and spontaneous, without stipulation of a return present. Secondly, a strict system of obligation was in force whereby the receiver was bound to not only reciprocate but to increase the value of the reciprocated gift. Thirdly the system demanded that further social obligation had now been established to continue the exchanges. Failure to respond meant loss of mana or influence. Where parties had travelled a long way to give a present it was expected that the return gift be immediate but often due to seasonal food supplies it was accepted that a return gift would be given at some later date when supplies allowed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Firth|first=R.|title=Primitive Economics of the New Zealand Maori|year=1929}}</ref> While a gift conveyed an obligation to return the favour, so did an insult.

A {{lang|mi|marae}} is the centre for much of M\u0101ori community life. Generally the [[M\u0101ori language]] is used in ceremonies and speeches, although translations and explanations are provided when the primary participants are not M\u0101ori speakers. Increasingly, New Zealand schools and universities have their own {{lang|mi|marae}} to facilitate the teaching of M\u0101ori language and culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tourism.net.nz/new-zealand/about-new-zealand/maori-culture.html|title=Maori Culture New Zealand, Maori Culture, Traditions and Tourism|last=Guide|first=New Zealand Tourism|website=www.tourism.net.nz|language=en|access-date=2017-07-27}}</ref>\n\nThe {{lang|mi|marae}} is a communal ceremonial centre where meetings and ceremonies take place in accordance with traditional protocols. The {{lang|mi|marae}} symbolises group unity and generally consists of an open cleared area in front of a large carved meeting house, along with a dining hall and other facilities necessary to provide a comfortable stay for visiting groups. On the {{lang|mi|marae}} official functions take place including formal welcomes, celebrations, weddings, christenings, reunions, and {{lang|mi|[[tangihanga]]}} (funerals). The older people have the authority on the {{lang|mi|marae}}, and they impart, primarily through [[oral tradition]], traditions and cultural practices to the young people. These include [[genealogy]], [[spirituality]], [[Public speaking|oratory]], and politics, and arts such as [[music composition]], performance, [[weaving]], or carving.\n\nThe {{lang|mi|hui}} or meeting, usually on a marae. It begins with a {{lang|mi|[[p\u014dwhiri]]}} (a welcoming ceremony). If a visitor is noteworthy, he or she may be welcomed with an aggressive challenge by a warrior armed with a {{lang|mi|[[taiaha]]}} (traditional fighting staff), who then offers a token of peace, such as a fern frond, to the visitor. Acceptance of the token in the face of such aggression is a demonstration of the courage and {{lang|mi|[[mana]]}} of the visitor. The {{lang|mi|p\u014dwhiri}} is highly structured, with speeches from both hosts and guests following a traditional format, their sequence dictated by the {{lang|mi|kawa}} (protocol) of that place, and followed by {{lang|mi|[[M\u0101ori music|waiata]]}}, songs. {{lang|mi|Hui}} are held for business, for festivities or for rites of passage such as baptism, marriage and death.

The {{lang|mi|h\u0101ngi}} consists of a shallow hole dug in the ground, in which a fire is prepared and stones are placed on the top. When the stones are hot, prepared food is placed on top of them, meat first and then vegetables such as k\u016bmara, potatoes and pumpkin. The {{lang|mi|h\u0101ngi}} is then covered with leaves or mats woven out of {{lang|mi|[[Phormium tenax|harakeke]]}}, or wet sacks, and soil is then heaped over the {{lang|mi|h\u0101ngi}} to seal in the heat to cook the food.\n\n=== {{lang|mi|Marae}} events ===\nLike in pre-European times, {{lang|mi|marae}} continue to be the location of many ceremonial events, including birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries.

As indicated by Ka'ai and Higgins, \"the importance of the {{lang|mi|tangihanga}} and its central place in {{lang|mi|marae}} custom is reflected in the fact that it takes precedence over any other gathering on the {{lang|mi|marae}}\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Ki te whaiao: An introduction to M\u0101ori culture and society|last1=Ka'ai|first1=T.

It is normal for M\u0101ori to travel very long distances to attend the {{lang|mi|tangi}} of a loved one. Often black clothes are worn, following Victorian practices. Guests will speak formally about the deceased on the {{lang|mi|marae atea}} often referring to tribal history and using humour. Pathos is commonly used to create a feeling of comfort and unity. Speeches are supported by {{lang|mi|waiata}} (songs). The {{lang|mi|whanau}} of the deceased sit by the coffin on the {{lang|mi|wharenui}} porch but do not speak or reply. The family may often hold or display photos of the deceased or important ancestors. A {{lang|mi|tangi}} may go on for several days, especially for a person of great {{lang|mi|mana}}.

Oratory, the making of speeches, is especially important in the rituals of encounter, and it is regarded as important for a speaker to include allusions to traditional narrative and to a complex system of proverbial sayings, called {{lang|mi|whakatauk\u012b}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.korero.maori.nz/forlearners/proverbs.html|title=Whakatauk\u012b \u2013 Proverbs|work=korero.maori.nz website}}</ref> Oral traditions include songs, calls, chants, {{lang|mi|haka}} and formalised speech patterns that recall the history of the people.\n\n=== Other traditional buildings ===\n[[File:Pataka.jpg|thumb|{{lang|mi|Pataka}} with {{lang|mi|[[tekoteko]]}}|alt=|260x260px]]\n[[File:Maori Village.jpg|thumb|A M\u0101ori village, {{circa|late 1800s}}|alt=|260x260px]]\nThe standard building in a classic M\u0101ori settlement was a simple sleeping {{lang|mi|whare puni}} (house/hut) about 2 metres x 3 metres with a low roof, an earth floor, no window and a single low doorway. Heating was provided by a small open fire in winter. There was no chimney.\n\nMaterial used in construction varied between areas, but raupo reeds, flax and totara bark shingles for the roof were common.<ref>Te Papa Museum of NZ. Wharepuni.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} Similar small {{lang|mi|whare}}, but with interior drains, were used to store k\u016bmara on sloping racks.\n\nIn the classic period a higher proportion of {{lang|mi|whare}} were located inside {{lang|mi|p\u0101}} than was the case after contact with Europeans. A chief's {{lang|mi|whare}} was similar but larger \u2014 often with full headroom in the centre, a small window and a partly enclosed front porch. In times of conflict the chief lived in a {{lang|mi|whare}} on the {{lang|mi|tihi}} or summit of a hill {{lang|mi|p\u0101}}. In colder areas, such as in the North Island central plateau, it was common for {{lang|mi|whare}} to be partly sunk into the ground for better insulation.\n\nFood was not cooked in the sleeping {{lang|mi|whare}} but in the open or under a {{lang|mi|kauta}} (lean-to). Saplings with branches and foliage removed were used to store and dry items such as fishing nets or cloaks. Valuable items were stored in pole-mounted storage shelters called {{lang|mi|pataka}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=John|author-link=John White (ethnographer)|title=The Ancient History of the Maori, His Mythology and Traditions|volume=V1|year=1888|publisher=Pataka.

This practice was done in order to express the buildings' significance and to secure the gods' protection. For smaller buildings, small animals were sacrificed to distinguish it from other buildings and to exhibit its uniqueness.{{sfn|Mol|1981|page=13}}\n\nThe traditional M\u0101ori {{lang|mi|whare}} continued to be used in rural areas in particular well into the post-contact period. They were usually very small with a dirt floor and full of vermin, especially fleas.

Significant finance and {{lang|mi|mana}} was invested in increasingly elaborate meeting houses which became a source of {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} or {{lang|mi|iwi}} pride and prestige.\n\nA meeting house was likely to have outside carvings and increasingly as European tools were used, intricate interior carving and woven panels depicting tribal history. Rotorua became a centre of carving excellence under the encouragement of the M\u0101ori MPs in the Young M\u0101ori party. Itinerant specialist carvers travelled widely, employing their skills in many locations. Meetinghouses became places for tribal celebrations or political meetings, especially after the 1860s Land Wars. They were a place to display largesse and enhance {{lang|mi|mana}} with elaborate feasts and entertainment. By the 20th century {{lang|mi|wharepuni}} were common and averaged 18\u201324m long by 8m wide. There were no M\u0101ori buildings of this size in pre-European days. As M\u0101ori became familiar with European building construction and design they incorporated features such as chimneys and fireplaces and made use of bigger doorways and windows as well as sawn timber but even by the turn of the 19th century toilet facilities were often primitive, despite the urgings of the M\u0101ori MPs Pomare and Ngata who worked hard to improve the standard of M\u0101ori dwellings over their many years in office.{{sfn|King|2001|page=47}}<ref>Maori MPs.NZ History online.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Mythology and religion ==\n{{main|M\u0101ori mythology|M\u0101ori religion|Taniwha}}\n{{Tall image|KupeWheke.jpg|150|300|alt=Tall wooden carving showing Kupe above two tentacled sea creatures|Late 20th-century [[whakairo|carving]] depicting the mythological navigator [[Kupe]] fighting two sea creatures|right}}\nTraditional M\u0101ori religion, has deviated little from its tropical Eastern [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] roots on the island of [[Hawaiki|Hawaiki Nui]].

The early European explorer and painter Earle noted in 1827 that these diseases were common even in isolated inland districts such as Taupo. His M\u0101ori advisers said the diseases were very old.\n\nEarle recognised that {{lang|mi|tohunga}} used a range of plants to treat minor skin ailments. Much later European doctors advocated investigation of the medicinal properties of plants commonly used in M\u0101ori medicine.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Missionaries===\n[[File:Whare Karakia o Onuku.jpg|thumb|Church near Onuku marae, Banks Peninsula. Opened in 1878 as the first non-denominational church in New Zealand.]]\nCMS missionaries insisted M\u0101ori abandon cannibalism and child infanticide before they could be baptised. They tried to discourage polygamy. Some early missionaries had sympathy for abandoned wives but Henry Williams was adamant that polygamy disqualified M\u0101ori from baptism. CMS missionaries also outlawed the use of further {{lang|mi|moko}}, taking part in lewd dances and practising customary funeral rites.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=175}} Catholic missionaries who arrived 20 years after the Church of England CMS missionaries were less concerned with stopping these customary practices before Christian conversion. They reasoned that they could influence M\u0101ori more effectively after baptism and were subsequently successful in attracting many converts in the western Hokianga district, away from the dominant CMS influence.\n\nMissionaries did not arrive in the Waikato until about 1834\u20135. CMS Mission Stations were established at Manakau, Maraetai, Waikato Heads, Kaitotehe opposite Tuapiri, Te Awamutu, Kopua and Kawhia. Missionaries helped explain the Treaty of Waitangi to Tainui in 1840.\n\n=== First M\u0101ori interpretation of Christianity===\nIn the 1830s Te Atua Wera started the Papahurihia Faith in opposition to the missionaries. It mixed Christian, Judaic and M\u0101ori customary influences. They held services on Saturday and called themselves {{lang|mi|Hurai}} or Jews. Te Atua Wera reverted to the more customary role of a {{lang|mi|tohunga}} figure by the late 1830s. Te Atua Wera taught that heaven was a place where there was happiness, no cold or hunger with an abundance of flour, sugar, muskets, ships, murder and voluptuousness.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=175}}\n\n== Children and education ==\n[[File:SwingAngas1847.JPG|thumb|A group of M\u0101ori children on a morere swing (1847)]]\n\n=== Childhood ===\nEarly European reports suggest that M\u0101ori children were indulged and led a carefree and playful life. A French explorer in 1772 commented that \"[the women] seemed to be good mothers and showed affection for their offspring. I have often seen them play with the children, caress them, chew the fern-root, pick at the stringy parts, and then take it out of their mouth to put it into that of their nurslings. The men were also very fond of and kind to their children.\"{{sfn|Salmond|1991|page=422}} French missionary Jean-Simon Bernard wrote, disapprovingly, in 1844: \"The children here are completely free; the parents never do anything to them. They never beat them and do not allow anyone else to beat them.\"{{sfn|Salmond|1991|page=422}} The killing of children could be the ''take'' (cause) of war.

Bishop Selwyn took adult M\u0101ori to Sydney where they experienced limited schooling to learn English. When missionaries back in arrived in the Bay of Islands they realised that if they were going to introduce Christianity and change what they considered to be barbaric practices like cannibalism, slavery, lewd dancing and having multiple wives, they would need to establish schools. Both the missionaries and their wives constructed schools and provided slates and bibles as reading material. The first school was established by T. Kendal in 1816. Recently original slates and written material from that period in the Bay of Islands has been located, photographed and published. Some adults attended school but most pupils were the sons or daughter of chiefs or other persons of status.\n\nBy 1853 Mr and Mrs Ashwell had been running a mission school at Taupiri in the Waikato for 50 M\u0101ori girls for 3 years. The girls learnt arithmetic and reading.<ref>Voyagers.p63. P. Moon. Penguin. 2014.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} In the early 1860s Governor Grey had provided money to support a trade school near Te Awamutu in the Waikato. The aim was to produce M\u0101ori workers who were literate but could also work with, and repair, agricultural machinery as used on farms and in the new flour mills. In 1863 the renegade Rewi Maniapoto attacked and burnt down the school, stealing the printing press. He aimed to kill leading Europeans in the area but they had been warned by friendly M\u0101ori and left before the attack. Because of the negative influence of Maniapoto and other anti-government factions, the school had previously had poor attendance, with as few as 10 boys attending regularly. All teaching by missionaries was in M\u0101ori and this continued in the native schools until 1900 when at the insistence of the Young M\u0101ori Party M\u0101ori MPs, schools started teaching in English. Influential M\u0101ori MPs [[\u0100pirana Ngata|Ngata]] and [[M\u0101ui P\u014dmare|P\u014dmare]] insisted that M\u0101ori be taught modern ways and sponsored the Suppression of Tohungaism Act in parliament. P\u014dmare, in particular, worked hard to banish ancient M\u0101ori concepts and practices that caused harm in the M\u0101ori community.<ref>The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, Maui Pomare.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Food ==\n[[File:Mount hobson Auckland kumara pits.jpg|thumb|Pits where kumara were stored to protect them over the winter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/218774|title=K\u016bmara storage pits, 1930|last=Godber|first=Albert Percy|publisher= New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|work=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref>|alt=|260x260px]]\n[[File:Maori earth oven.svg|thumb|{{lang|mi|H\u0101ngi}} or earth ovens are still used today to cook food|alt=|260x260px]]\n{{See also|M\u0101ori cuisine|H\u0101ngi}}\n\n=== Traditional M\u0101ori foods ===\nEating shellfish such as mussels and oysters was very common. During summer sea fish such as kahawai were caught using bone or {{lang|mi|[[Lygodium articulatum|mangemange]]}} hooks, 2-piece lures or large flax nets. In creeks and lakes, eels were caught in large numbers when migrating along known waterways using {{lang|mi|hinaki}}, a long cone-shaped net. Birds such as ducks were targeted during the moulting season and young birds such as Petrels and Gannets were taken from nests and cooked in their own fat to preserve them. Such preserved birds were favourite gifts to fulfil social gift obligations. M\u0101ori closely observed the natural world to take advantage of seasonal opportunities. Native pigeons ate [[Miro (tree)|miro]] berries which made them thirsty. M\u0101ori carved wooden bowls equipped with multiple neck snares and placed these in miro trees to catch these large birds.\n\nEvidence from many recent Eastern Golden Bay excavations, especially at Tata Beach, shows that in middens local shellfish and fish bones were most prominent, followed by dog ({{lang|mi|kur\u012b}}) bones and rat bones. Less common were bones from small birds and sea mammals. The Tata Beach site and other nearby sites such as Takapou were in use from 1450 up to 1660 AD, well into the Classic period. The coastal sites showed that M\u0101ori had created man-made soils in the sand dunes ranging from small to very large (over 100m<sup>2</sup>). The natural soil A horizons had been modified by placing dark, humus-rich soil near the surface.<ref name=\"gardensofrongo\">{{cite journal|last=Barber|first=Ian|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=53|date=Dec 2012|title=Gardens of Rongo|doi=10.1086/667834}}</ref> This practice was widespread in M\u0101ori communities where k\u016bmara was grown, although in many cases free-draining sand, gravels and pumice were mixed with humus-rich loam. K\u016bmara are slow-growing in the temperate NZ climate and need free-draining subsoils. In the Eastern Golden Bay north-facing slopes were favoured.<ref name=\"gardensofrongo\" />\n\nThe warmer climate of the north and northern and central coastal regions allowed better growth of subtropical plants such as k\u016bmara, yam and gourds. In Auckland, and on Mayor Island, volcanic land was cleared of rocks which were used for low shelter walls. In some areas piles of volcanic rock which kept warm at night, were used to train the vines of gourds.\n\nMany special techniques had been devised to grow and especially to store k\u016bmara so it did not rot. Careful storage and use of {{lang|mi|tapu}} was essential to prevent unauthorised use. Seed k\u016bmara in particular were highly {{lang|mi|tapu}}. The main problem for k\u016bmara growers were native caterpillars. Early European explorers reported that M\u0101ori often ringed a garden with burning vegetation in an attempt to control caterpillars. M\u0101ori continued to use traditional fern roots \u2014 {{lang|mi|aruhe}} \u2014 as a normal part of their diet into the mid-19th century.\n\n=== Introduced foods ===\nThe introduction of European foods changed many aspects of M\u0101ori agriculture. Under tradition, M\u0101ori agriculture land was abandoned after a few crops because of reduced production. This was the common pattern apart from a few very fertile alluvial river valleys. Fertiliser was not used{{sfn|Belgrave|2013|page=110}} although M\u0101ori had devised various techniques to enhance production such as the addition of pumice or similar materials to improve drainage on heavy soils. M\u0101ori allowed gardens to revert to shrubs and plantations were shifted to another area. The introduction of foreign weeds which thrived was a significant issue from the 1820s but offset by the widespread growth of the introduced potato, the traditional varieties of which are still grown and known as {{lang|mi|taewa}} or [[M\u0101ori potatoes]].\n\nEuropean farms and the methods they used became a cultural and economic magnet for M\u0101ori{{sfn|Belgrave|2013|page=110}} in the North, in Auckland and later in the Te Awamutu area of the Waikato. Under the tuition of missionaries, M\u0101ori learnt to mass-produce food, especially potatoes, far in excess of their own needs for trading into the late 1850s. In 1858 European numbers equalled M\u0101ori numbers and increasingly European farmers were able to supply towns such as Auckland. At the same time the strong market demand for supplying food to the gold rush markets in Australia and California ended.\n\n== Trade and travel ==\n\n===Transport===\n{{main|Waka (canoe)}}\n[[File:Abaconda New Zealand maori waka.jpg|thumb|{{lang|mi|[[Waka (canoe)|Waka]]}} (canoes) are built in a variety of sizes depending on their purpose, including deep-sea fishing, river crossings or historically war and migration.]]\nThe normal M\u0101ori method of travel was on foot. The North Island had an extensive network of single lane one metre wide tracks that traversed beaches, plains, valleys and mountain passes. Some of these tracks were used by many {{lang|mi|iwi}} and were considered neutral territory. Missionaries who travelled with M\u0101ori guides found that at river crossings canoes were left for the use of any traveller.<ref>Tainui. L. Kelly.2002.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} Between 1840 and 1850 numbers of explorers, artists, government officials including Governor Grey travelled inland with the aid of M\u0101ori guides. The guides carried heavy loads and would carry Europeans across creeks. Crossing swamps was common. Although they carried some food they relied on purchasing basic foodstuffs such as potatoes or native pigeons from M\u0101ori settlements. The most popular payment was in tobacco which was in great demand. In more remote areas travellers sometimes found M\u0101ori living by themselves and growing a few potatoes.<ref>Voyages. P. Moon. Penguin. 2014.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\nCanoes ({{lang|mi|[[waka (canoe)|waka]]}}) were used extensively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/waka-canoes/page-1|title=Waka \u2013 canoes |work=Te Ara}}</ref> These ranged from small river-going boats, to the large {{lang|mi|waka taua}} sea-going war vessels carrying up to 80 paddlers, and up to {{convert|40|m|ft}} long.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/waka-canoes/3|title=Waka taua|work=Te Ara}}</ref> Waka were used extensively for long-range travel down the east coast and to cross Cook Strait. In 1822\u201323 [[Te Rauparah\u0101]], who had established a base by capturing Kapiti Island, reconnoitred the upper South Island in waka before launching a seaborne invasion the following year against Ng\u0101i Tahu and Rangit\u0101ne iwi. Te Rauparah\u0101 later hired a European ship to attack Akaroa Harbour.{{sfn|King|2003}} This showed that Te Rauparaha was prepared to use Western technology to further his own  goals. [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]], who followed several war parties, reported as many as 50 waka taua travelling together at one time, although he reported they only went out to sea in relatively calm weather. From 1835 large numbers of European ships entered the Bay of Islands every year with Henry Williams reporting an average of 70\u201380 ships per year. Many M\u0101ori men worked on the ships, with a reported average of eight M\u0101ori seamen per whaling ship. Ten metre long whaleboats began to be used by M\u0101ori. They could be both rowed and sailed.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012}} In the 1850s as M\u0101ori with the active encouragement of Grey embraced trade were gradually able to develop a large fleet of small trading schooners and similar craft. All the initial European centres had been supported by Maori.\n\n[[File:Maori war canoe, drawing by Alexander Sporing.jpg|thumb|Maori war canoe, drawing by Alexander Sporing, [[First voyage of James Cook|Cook's first voyage]], 1769]]\nDuring the mid 19th century Auckland and Northland M\u0101ori dominated shipping trade. In 1851 51 vessels were registered and 30 smaller vessels licensed. By 1857 there were 37 schooners. The fleet increased steadily during the Tasman trade boom of 1853\u201356. M\u0101ori paid customs duties to the government and invested heavily in vessels, so suffered considerably when a dramatic market slump hit New Zealand especially effecting the Auckland\u2013Waikato\u2013Hauraki area.<ref>Climates of War. E. Bohan. pp 36\u201337.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} During the musket war period and for a time afterwards, Maori, isolated from their tribal support by these devastating conflicts, hid in isolated places, living off patches of vegetables they grew in tiny gardens. This practice was very common in Taranaki which had been devastated by Waikato attacks in particular. European explorers, such as Dieffenbach, often stumbled upon these survivors while exploring. He described these {{lang|mi|whare}} as hotbeds for rats and vermin.<ref>P. Moon. p. 111. 2014.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Trade===\nWith the arrival of Europeans M\u0101ori gradually started to trust the value of British money and use it as a medium of exchange instead of goods. This was rare before 1834 but became increasingly common as more M\u0101ori worked as sailors on European ships, where they gained a good reputation as being strong capable workers.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=West|first=Jonathan|title=The Face of Nature: An Environmental History of the Otago Peninsula|date=March 2018|publisher=[[University of Otago|Otago University]] Press|isbn=978-1-92732238-3|location=Dunedin|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Az_ltwEACAAJ&dq=face+of+nature}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/economic-history/page-2|title=2. \u2013 Economic history \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref>\n\nBy 1839 a large proportion of the M\u0101ori trade in goods was paid for in cash, with M\u0101ori showing a strong preference for coins rather than paper banknotes. Northern M\u0101ori learnt that they could more easily hide cash from their relatives avoiding the traditional obligatory sharing of goods with their {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}}. The period 1835 to 1840 completed the revolution in the north M\u0101ori economy with M\u0101ori abandoning many of their former trading habits and adopting those of the Europeans to the point where M\u0101ori became dependent on the flow of European goods to maintain their new way of life.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|pages=130\u2013135}}\n \nThe effect of trading increased the influence of chiefs over their {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}}. Northern traders assumed that the chief was the organisational head of the {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} and all trade went through him including payments for goods purchased. This gave chiefs much more influence, especially after 1835, because trade was so regular. In pre-contact times the power of chiefs was never very great, largely being restricted to directing warfare.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=203}} Early European observers noted that at {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} and {{lang|mi|whanuau hui}} (meetings) every person, including women, had their say and the chief had no more influence than any other person on the final decision. Where a chief had great {{lang|mi|mana}}, especially powers of persuasion, chiefs had more influence because of their personality rather than any recognised authority.\n \nNot all {{lang|mi|iwi}} had regular contact with Europeans. The French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville visited Tasman Bay in 1827 and using knowledge he had picked up at the Bay of Islands was able to communicate with local M\u0101ori. He found that although they had some passing awareness of Europeans\u2014they seemed to know about firearms\u2014the extent of their understanding was far less than that of the Northern M\u0101ori.{{sfn|Moon|2012|page=128}}\n\nIn the Waikato regular contact did not start until five decades after contact in the north of New Zealand. It was not until Ng\u0101ti Toa was forced out of Kawhia in 1821 that the bulk of the Tainui people had contact with Europeans. In 1823 a man called Te Puaha visited the Bay of Islands, bringing back with him Captain Kent who arrived by ship at Kawhia.\n\nBy 1859 trade was the main area in which M\u0101ori interacted with Europeans. Trade was an area that M\u0101ori expected to control. From first contact, they had sold or exchanged fresh foodstuffs initially for high-value goods such as axes and later for money. George Grey was keen to encourage M\u0101ori trade and commerce and established new laws to empower them in 1846. M\u0101ori brought numerous cases under this legislation and won. This was their first and most successful legal experience.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burke|first=E.|title=Climates of War|year=2005|publisher=Hazard Press|page=36}}</ref> M\u0101ori had begun to include European concepts into their own cultural behaviour. In 1886 banknotes were printed (but not issued) by Te Peeke o Aotearoa, a bank established by [[T\u0101whiao]] the [[M\u0101ori King Movement|M\u0101ori King]]. The text on these notes was M\u0101ori and there was also a picture of a flax bush. The bank's cheques had M\u0101ori figures and native birds and plants drawn on them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/213266|title=1. \u2013 Coins and banknotes \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Land negotiations ===\n{{main|M\u0101ori Land Court|Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements}}\nThe M\u0101ori relationship with the land is complex. Traditionally the resources the land held were controlled based on systems of {{lang|mi|mana}} (power) and {{lang|mi|whakapapa}} (ancestral right). The land itself was both sacred and abstract. In many cases multiple groups would express a connection with the same important river or mountain. Oral tradition would record the migrations of groups from one area to another and their connection with an ancestral location.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn the early 19th century many Europeans entered into dealings with M\u0101ori to obtain land for their use. In some cases settlers thought they were buying land to obtain equivalent to freehold title under British law; M\u0101ori claimed that the various deeds signed by M\u0101ori were more limited and conditional, stopping short of outright alienation. It has been argued that the use of the word {{lang|mi|tuku}} in deeds, meaning to let or allow or give freely, was not the same as selling. This and other interpretations of early 19th century New Zealand land deals have been the source of much disagreement both within the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] process and outside it.<ref>Waitangi Tribunal, [https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/WT/wt_DOC_68635760/Muriwhenua%20Land.pdf Muriwhenua Land Report], p. 394</ref>{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=147}}\n\nM\u0101ori, especially after 1830, were eager to have Europeans living on their land under their protection so they could benefit from European knowledge and trade. Missionaries on the other hand were keen to buy land so they could grow their own food to make them less dependent on tribal \"protectors\", who sometimes used food supplies to coerce them. Settlers allowed M\u0101ori to stay on the land they had \"bought\" and often continued to give presents to tribal chiefs, often prompted by the chiefs themselves, in order to maintain friendly relationships. These compromises stopped with the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=147}}\n\nAnother reason for M\u0101ori to \"sell\" land to missionaries was to protect the title of the land from other tribal competitors. M\u0101ori who had converted to Christianity wanted to protect their land without resorting to warfare. Some degree of control passed to the missionaries who M\u0101ori trusted to allow them continued access and use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.treatyofwaitangi.net.nz/WhyaTreaty.html|title=The Treaty of Waitangi|website=www.treatyofwaitangi.net.nz|access-date=2017-07-27}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1840 generally, older chiefs were reluctant to sell while younger chiefs were in favour. The situation was complicated as M\u0101ori often had overlapping rights on poorly defined land. The settlers and the government also had very limited access to trained surveyors and even freehold land boundaries were ill-defined. Surveying was a relatively new skill and involved much hard physical work especially in hill country. New farmers were able to purchase a small freehold farm from M\u0101ori on which they established their homestead and farm buildings. They then entered into leases with M\u0101ori owners for much larger areas of land. Short-term leases gave M\u0101ori a powerful position as there was a large demand for grazing land.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe Native Lands Act was a policy enforced by the government in 1865, which allowed the M\u0101ori people to obtain individual titles for their land to sell. This act abolished the traditional shared landholdings and made it easier for European settlers to directly purchase land for themselves.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sorrenson|first=M. P.

These claims against the government were to become a major feature of {{lang|mi|iwi}} politics. Each generation of leaders were judged based on their ability to progress a land claim.{{sfn|Belgrave|2013}}\n\n== Leadership and politics ==\n{{see also|M\u0101ori politics}}\n\n=== M\u0101ori kingship ===\n{{Main|M\u0101ori King Movement}}\nFrom the time of their arrival in New Zealand, M\u0101ori lived in tribes that functioned independently under the leadership of their own chiefs. However, by the 1850s M\u0101ori were faced with increasing numbers of British settlers, political marginalisation and growing demand from the Crown to purchase their lands. From about 1853 M\u0101ori began reviving the ancient tribal {{lang|mi|runanga}} or chiefly war councils where land issues were raised and in May 1854 a large meeting \u2014 attracting as many as 2000 M\u0101ori leaders \u2014 was held at Manawapou in south Taranaki where speakers urged concerted opposition to selling land.{{sfn|Dalton|1967|pages=62\u201363}} Inspired by a trip to England during which he had met [[Queen Victoria]], Te Rauparaha's son, [[Tamihana Te Rauparaha]], used the {{lang|mi|runanga}} to promote the idea of forming a M\u0101ori kingdom, with one king ruling over all tribes.<ref name=\"sinclair\">{{cite book|last=Sinclair|first=Keith|title=A History of New Zealand|publisher=Penguin|year=2000|isbn=978-0-14-029875-8|edition=2000|location=Auckland|pages=115\u2013117}}</ref> The {{lang|mi|kotahitanga}} or unity movement was aimed at bringing to M\u0101ori the unity that was an obvious strength among the Europeans.{{sfn|Dalton|1967|pages=62\u201363}}<ref name=\"sinclair\" /> It was believed that by having a monarch who could claim status similar to that of Queen Victoria, M\u0101ori would be able to deal with [[P\u0101keh\u0101]] (Europeans) on equal footing.

He adopted the [[Cree language]] name for the lake: ''w\u012bnip\u0113k'' (\u1410\u14c2\u142f\u1420), meaning \"muddy waters\". [[Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La V\u00e9rendrye|La V\u00e9rendrye]] referred to the lake as ''Ouinipigon'' when he built the first forts in the area in the 1730s. Later, the [[Red River Colony]] to its south took the lake's name for Winnipeg, the capital of Manitoba.\n\nLake Winnipeg lies along one of the oldest trading routes in North America to have flown the [[British flag]]. For several centuries, furs were traded along this route between [[York Factory]] on Hudson Bay<ref name = \"CanoeRoutesMorse\">''Fur Trade Canoe Routes of Canada/ Then and Now'' by Eric W. Morse Canada National and Historic Parks Branch, first printing 1969.</ref> (which was the longtime headquarters for the Hudson's Bay Company) over Lake Winnipeg and the [[Red River Trails]] to the confluence of the [[Minnesota River|Minnesota]] and [[Mississippi River]]s at [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]. This was a strategic trading route for the [[First British Empire]]. With the establishment of the [[Second British Empire]] after Britain's loss of the [[Thirteen Colonies]], a significant increase in trade occurred over Lake Winnipeg between Rupert's Land and the [[United States]].\n\n== Economy ==\n=== Transportation ===\nBecause of its length, the Lake Winnipeg water system and the lake was an important transportation route in the province before the railways reached Manitoba. It continued to be a major transportation route even after the railways reached the province. In addition to aboriginal canoes and [[York boat]]s, several steamboats plied the lake, including ''[[SS Anson Northup|Anson Northup]]'', ''[[SS City of Selkirk|City of Selkirk]]'', ''[[SS Colvile|Colvile]]'', ''[[SS Keenora|Keenora]]'', ''[[SS Premier|Premier]]'', ''[[SS Princess|Princess]]'', ''[[SS Winnitoba|Winnitoba]]'', ''[[SS Wolverine|Wolverine]]'' and most recently the diesel-powered ''[[MS Lord Selkirk II]]'' passenger cruise ship.\n\n=== Communities ===\nCommunities on the lake include [[Grand Marais, Manitoba|Grand Marais]], [[Lester Beach (Manitoba)|Lester Beach]], [[Riverton, Manitoba|Riverton]], [[Gimli, Manitoba|Gimli]], [[Winnipeg Beach, Manitoba|Winnipeg Beach]], [[Victoria Beach, Manitoba|Victoria Beach]], [[Hillside Beach, Manitoba|Hillside beach]], [[Pine Falls, Manitoba|Pine Falls]], [[Manigotagan, Manitoba|Manigotagan]], [[Berens River, Manitoba|Berens River]], [[Bloodvein First Nation|Bloodvein]], Sandy Hook, Albert Beach, [[Hecla-Grindstone Provincial Park#Hecla Village|Hecla Village]] and [[Grand Rapids, Manitoba|Grand Rapids]].

The mussels are devastating to the ecological opportunities of the lake.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/lake-winnipeg-zebra-mussels-lost-cause-eva-pip-1.3264283 Lake Winnipeg a lost cause - CBC Online]</ref>\n\n== History ==\nIt is believed [[Henry Kelsey]] was the first European to see the lake, in 1690. He adopted the [[Cree language]] name for the lake: ''w\u012bnip\u0113k'' (\u1410\u14c2\u142f\u1420), meaning \"muddy waters\". [[Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La V\u00e9rendrye|La V\u00e9rendrye]] referred to the lake as ''Ouinipigon'' when he built the first forts in the area in the 1730s. Later, the [[Red River Colony]] to its south took the lake's name for Winnipeg, the capital of Manitoba.\n\nLake Winnipeg lies along one of the oldest trading routes in North America to have flown the [[British flag]]. For several centuries, furs were traded along this route between [[York Factory]] on Hudson Bay<ref name = \"CanoeRoutesMorse\">''Fur Trade Canoe Routes of Canada/ Then and Now'' by Eric W. Morse Canada National and Historic Parks Branch, first printing 1969.</ref> (which was the longtime headquarters for the Hudson's Bay Company) over Lake Winnipeg and the [[Red River Trails]] to the confluence of the [[Minnesota River|Minnesota]] and [[Mississippi River]]s at [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]. This was a strategic trading route for the [[First British Empire]]. With the establishment of the [[Second British Empire]] after Britain's loss of the [[Thirteen Colonies]], a significant increase in trade occurred over Lake Winnipeg between Rupert's Land and the [[United States]].\n\n== Economy ==\n=== Transportation ===\nBecause of its length, the Lake Winnipeg water system and the lake was an important transportation route in the province before the railways reached Manitoba. It continued to be a major transportation route even after the railways reached the province. In addition to aboriginal canoes and [[York boat]]s, several steamboats plied the lake, including ''[[SS Anson Northup|Anson Northup]]'', ''[[SS City of Selkirk|City of Selkirk]]'', ''[[SS Colvile|Colvile]]'', ''[[SS Keenora|Keenora]]'', ''[[SS Premier|Premier]]'', ''[[SS Princess|Princess]]'', ''[[SS Winnitoba|Winnitoba]]'', ''[[SS Wolverine|Wolverine]]'' and most recently the diesel-powered ''[[MS Lord Selkirk II]]'' passenger cruise ship.\n\n=== Communities ===\nCommunities on the lake include [[Grand Marais, Manitoba|Grand Marais]], [[Lester Beach (Manitoba)|Lester Beach]], [[Riverton, Manitoba|Riverton]], [[Gimli, Manitoba|Gimli]], [[Winnipeg Beach, Manitoba|Winnipeg Beach]], [[Victoria Beach, Manitoba|Victoria Beach]], [[Hillside Beach, Manitoba|Hillside beach]], [[Pine Falls, Manitoba|Pine Falls]], [[Manigotagan, Manitoba|Manigotagan]], [[Berens River, Manitoba|Berens River]], [[Bloodvein First Nation|Bloodvein]], Sandy Hook, Albert Beach, [[Hecla-Grindstone Provincial Park#Hecla Village|Hecla Village]] and [[Grand Rapids, Manitoba|Grand Rapids]]. A number of pleasure beaches are found on the southern end of the lake, which are popular in the summer, attracting many visitors from Winnipeg, about 80&nbsp;km south.\n[[File:Gimli Manitoba Canada Panorama.jpg|thumb|800px|center|<center>[[Rural Municipality of Gimli|Gimli]] on Lake Winnipeg.</center>]]\n\n=== Commercial fisheries ===\nLake Winnipeg has important commercial fisheries. Its catch makes up a major part of Manitoba's $30 million per year fishing industry.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/conservation/fish/ |title=Manitoba Water Stewardship - Fisheries |access-date=2 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925040430/http://www.gov.mb.ca/conservation/fish/ |archive-date=25 September 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The lake was once the main source of [[goldeye]] in Canada, which is why the fish is sometimes called Winnipeg goldeye.
