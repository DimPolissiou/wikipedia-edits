He was born in [[Prishtina]], [[Kosovo]] and his origin is from [[Ka\u00e7inar]], [[Mirdit\u00eb]]. He is one of the first albanian rappers and the leader of TBA (The bloody alboz). The message that he sends through out his songs and the fact that he never made a music video on his career make his style of rap unique. Even though he isn\u2019t as active on the music industry these days he is still considered the best albanian rapper ever.   <ref>{{cite web|url= https://gazetablic.com/unikkatil-feston-ditelindjen-ja-sa-vjecar-po-behet-reperi/ |title=Unikkatil feston dit\u00eblindjen ja sa vje\u00e7ar po b\u00ebhet |publisher=gazetablic.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.botapress.info/rebel-a-k-a-unikatil-pershendet-nga-prekazi/|title=Unikkatil p\u00ebrsh\u00ebndet nga Prekazi |publisher=botapress.info}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VL02DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA43|title=Kosovo=Jet|last1=Knaus|first1=Verena|last2=Warrander|first2=Gail|last3=Olenicoff|first3=Larissa|last4=Jennions|first4=Bridget Nurre|page=43|date=Oct 5, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insajderi.com/unikkatil-feston-ditelindjen/|title=Unikkatil feston dit\u00eblindjen|publisher=insajderi.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyrics.al/unikkatil/biografia|title=Unikkatil :: Biography|publisher=lyrics.al}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nHis music career began in 1993 when he recorded his first record.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lajmeshqip.com/showbiz-lifestyle/rikthehet-\"shekspiri-shqiptar\"-per-ti-mundur-te-gjithe-me-\"fitorja-e-sinqerte\"|title=Rikthehet \"Shekspiri Shqiptar\u00eb\" p\u00ebr ti mundur t\u00eb gjith\u00eb me \"Fitorja e Sinqert\u00eb\"|publisher=lajmeshqip.com}}</ref> One of the most popular Albanian rappers,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.botasot.info/mediale-vip-showbiz/796388/kur-unikkatil-shperthen-me-kuq-e-zi/ |title=Kur Unikatil shp\u00ebrthen me \"Kuq E Zi\"|publisher=botasot.info}}</ref> his concert in the Pristina stadium was noted to have no less than 25,000 attendees.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://telegrafi.com/ekskluzive-unikkatili-perseri-ne-stadium/|title=Ekskluzive: Unikkatili, p\u00ebrs\u00ebri n\u00eb stadium \u2013 Telegrafi|date=15 July 2013|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S88kN9FEVFc|title=UNIKKATIL \u2013 KONCERTI NE PRISHTINE \u2013 PRIVE KLANKOSOVA|first=|last=PriveKlanKosova|date=21 July 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQK_sRL15FM|title=Unikkatil dhe TBA \u2013 Koncert ne Prishtine RinON \u2013 RTK|first=|last=RTKrinon|date=10 June 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> He was commended by internationally acclaimed Albanian writer [[Ismail Kadare]] as an \"inspiration to Albanians worldwide\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albeu.com/showbiz/unikatili-e-cmoj-punen-e-kadarese/77834/|title=Unikatili: E \u00e7moj pun\u00ebn e Kadares\u00eb|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://periskopi.com/mund-ta-fitoje-unikkatili-nobelin-para-ismail-kadarese/|title=A mund ta fitoj\u00eb Unikkatili Nobelin para Ismail Kadares\u00eb? - Periskopi|date=19 October 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nUnikkatil has released five albums so far.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.teksteshqip.com/unikkatil/albume |title= Albumet e Unikkatil-it |publisher=teksteshqip.com}}</ref> The first album ''Shihemi N'p\u00ebrkujtime'' was released in 2002,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/sh%C3%ADhemi-np\u00ebrkujt%C3%ADme/1202611453|title=Shihemi N'P\u00ebrkujtime on iTunes|date=4 August 2002|publisher=}}</ref> followed by ''Fj\u00e1lt e Pavdekshme'' in 2004,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/fj\u00e1lt-e-pavdekshme/1202601334|title=Fj\u00e1lt E Pavdekshme on iTunes|date=1 May 2004|publisher=}}</ref> ''Prezenton The Bloody Alboz'' in 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/prezenton-the-bloody-alboz/473594365|title=Prezenton the Bloody Alboz by Unikkatil on Apple Music|date=5 November 2005|publisher=}}</ref> ''Armiqt Suprem'' in 2006 <ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/armiqt-suprem/468211146|title=Armiqt Suprem by Unikkatil on Apple Music|date=28 November 2006|publisher=}}</ref> and ''Kanuni i Katilit'' in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/kanuni-i-katilit/468190977|title=Kanuni I Katilit by Unikkatil on iTunes|date=17 December 2007|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\nUnikkatil - A Nive (Feat.

During high school, he was involved in fights and was kicked out of school three times. Then, he started having karate lessons. In 1995, his best friend Dren Thaqi died in a crash with a train. He dedicated a song to him called \"Shpirt n'paqe\". He was against the Serbian invasion in Kosovo and supported the war of KLA (Kosovo Liberation Army). Some of his songs were not played on radio, because he would have been in trouble with the Serbian government. In 1996, with his family, he immigrated to the USA. He established Conqueror Records followed by The Bloody Alboz. Except Unikkatil, the other members are Klepto, Presioni, Jetoni, Cyanide, Miloti, NAG, Rameka, TEE, Z.E.F and B-52.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1981 births]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Pristina]]\n[[Category:Albanian rappers]]\n\n\n{{Albania-bio-stub}} \nwww.soundwave.tv\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox musical artist\n| image = Unikkatil-.jpg\n| name = Viktor Palokaj\n| years_active = 1992 - present\n| background = solo_singer\n| occupation = Rappers, singer, songwriter, record producer\n| birth_date = {{birth date and age|df=yes|1981|3|18}}\n| birth_place = [[Prishtina]], [[Kosovo]]\n}}\n\n'''Viktor Palokaj''' (born March 18, 1981), known professionally as '''Unikkatil''' (stylized as '''UniKKatil'''), is an Albanian rapper, singer, songwriter and record producer who lives in [[Bronx]], [[New York (city)|New York]].

During high school, he was involved in fights and was kicked out of school three times. Then, he started having karate lessons. In 1995, his best friend Dren Thaqi died in a crash with a train. He dedicated a song to him called \"Shpirt n'paqe\". He was against the Serbian invasion in Kosovo and supported the war of KLA (Kosovo Liberation Army). Some of his songs were not played on radio, because he would have been in trouble with the Serbian government. In 1996, with his family, he immigrated to the USA. He established Conqueror Records followed by The Bloody Alboz. Except Unikkatil, the other members are Klepto, Presioni, Jetoni, Cyanide, Miloti, NAG, Rameka, TEE, Z.E.F and B-52.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1981 births]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Pristina]]\n[[Category:Albanian rappers]]\n\n\n{{Albania-bio-stub}} \nwww.soundwave.tv\n", "name_user": "Ali Veselaj", "label": "safe", "comment": "I told more about his career and his style", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unikkatil"}
