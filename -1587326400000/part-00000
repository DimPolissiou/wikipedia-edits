There are seven main rivers that enter Pakistan from upper riparian states, including the [[Kabul River]] that enters from Afghanistan, and the [[Indus River]], [[Jhelum River]], [[Chenab River]], [[Ravi River]], and [[Sutlej|Sutlej River]] that enter from India. Among these the Ravi and Sutlej are diverted in upstream India, for which consumptive use was awarded to India under the [[Indus Waters Treaty]] signed in 1960 by India and Pakistan. Canal networks from the Indus (main stem), Jhelum River, and Chenab River supply water throughout the agricultural plains in [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]] and in [[Sindh]], while the rest of the country has very little access to other fresh water.<ref name=\":02\"/> Potential scarcity of water not only threatens Pakistan's economy but also poses a serious threat to the lives of millions of Pakistanis.\n\nLower flows due to the Indus Waters Treaty, as well as diversion to canals, means that lower dilution flows are available within the rivers of Pakistan. On the other hand, water pollution generation is increasing largely due to the growing economy and population, and an almost complete lack of water treatment. The sources for water pollution include the overuse of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, the dumping of industrial effluent into lakes and rivers, untreated sewage being dumped into rivers and the ocean, and contaminated pipelines being used to transport water.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://environment.gov.pk/PRO_PDF/PositionPaper/Water%20Pollution.pdf|title=Brief on Water Pollution|last=|first=|date=|website=environment.gov.pk|publisher=|access-date=30 October 2016}}</ref> The contamination of fresh drinking water makes it harder for people to find clean water supplies and increases the prevalence of [[waterborne diseases]]. Consequently, most of the reported health problems in Pakistan are either a direct or indirect result of polluted water.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sabir|first=Ismat|title=Water is Becoming Scarce|newspaper=Pakistan Observer|publication-date=28 November 2012|volume=}}</ref> 45% of infant deaths are due to diarrhea and 60% to overall waterborne diseases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcrwr.gov.pk/images/press%20news/Current%20Synopsis.pdf|title=Satellite Based Monitoring of Groundwater Storage Variations Over Indus Basin|last=|first=|date=|website=www.pcrwr.gov.pk|publisher=Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resource, Ministry of Science & Technology|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113052216/http://www.pcrwr.gov.pk/images/press%20news/Current%20Synopsis.pdf|archive-date=2016-11-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Noise pollution ===\nThe megacities of Pakistan, such as [[Karachi]], [[Lahore]], [[Islamabad]] and [[Rawalpindi]], face the issue of [[noise pollution]]. The main source of this pollution is the traffic noise caused by buses, cars, trucks, [[Pulled rickshaw|rickshaws]] and water tankers. A study showed that on one of Karachi's main roads, the average noise level was around 90&nbsp;dB and was capable of reaching about 110&nbsp;dB. This is much higher than the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]'s noise level standard of 70&nbsp;dB, which is not meant to be harmful to the human ear. However, the study also concluded that in Pakistan, \"the traffic noise levels limit as laid down by National Environment Quality standards, Environmental Protection Agency is 85 dB\".<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Traffic Noise Pollution in Karachi, Pakistan|url=http://lumhs.edu.pk/jlumhs/Vol09No03/pdfs/v9n3oa09.pdf|journal=Journal of Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences|volume=09}}</ref>\n\nThis high level of noise pollution can cause auditory and non-auditory health issues. Auditory issues include the loss of auditory sensory cells; non-auditory health issues include sleep disturbance, noise and cardiovascular disease, [[Endocrine system|endocrine]] response to noise and psychiatric disorder.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Exploring Noise Pollution, Source and its impacts: an anthropological Study of rawalpindi city|url=http://www.sci-int.com/pdf/3641762493rd%20Paper%20Noise%20615-616.pdf|journal=Pakistan Association of Anthropology|volume=|issn=1013-5316|access-date=2016-11-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804132348/http://sci-int.com/pdf/3641762493rd%20Paper%20Noise%20615-616.pdf|archive-date=2016-08-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> There are very few, vague laws and policies in regards to noise levels. There is no accountability, and while the federal and provincial environmental protection agencies receive dozens of complaints on noise pollution from the public, these agencies are unable to take action due to legal constraints and the absence of national noise level standards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.pk/PRO_PDF/NoisePaperGen.pdf|title=Position Paper for environmental quality standards of noise in pakistan|last=|first=|date=|website=environment.gov.ok|publisher=Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency|access-date=30 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Air pollution ===\n[[Air pollution]] is a growing environmental problem in most major cities of Pakistan. According to a World Bank report, \"Karachi's urban air pollution is among the most severe in the world and it engenders significant damages to human health and the economy\". The inefficient use of energy, an increase in the number of vehicles used daily, an increase in unregulated industrial emissions and the burning of garbage and plastic have contributed the most to air pollution in urban areas. According to a recent study, the Sindh Environment Protection Department claims that the average level of pollution in big cities is approximately four times higher than the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organisation]]'s limits. These emissions have detrimental effects, including \"[[respiratory disease]]s, reduced visibility, loss of vegetation and an effect on the growth of plants.\"\n\nOne of the greatest contributors to air pollution is industrial activity. The inadequate air emission treatments and lack of regulatory control over industrial activity has contributed to the deterioration of ambient air quality in major cities. In addition, the common practice of burning massive amounts of solid waste, including plastic and rubber, on street corners by the public, releases toxic gases, which are extremely harmful for residents in the area.\n\nIn 2018, a young entrepreneur in Karachi, Abid Omar, launched the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative to monitor air quality in Pakistan's big cities. The project aims to increase the availability of air quality data in Pakistan and make citizens more aware of the health impacts of air pollution.<ref>https://thediplomat.com/2018/08/pakistans-rising-air-pollution-crisis/</ref> The US State Department has set up three high-quality air quality monitoring stations at three locations in Pakistan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pk.usembassy.gov/u-s-mission-pakistan-starts-publishing-air-quality-data/|title=U.S. Mission Pakistan Starts Publishing Air Quality Data|date=2019-04-30|website=U.S. Embassy & Consulates in Pakistan|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-01}}</ref>\n\nSpecifically, studies have revealed the negative consequences air pollution can have on the welfare of those impacted. Studies have revealed how the constant fluctuation of particulate matter poses a major threat to Pakistan\u2019s citizens who are frequently exposes to harmful levels of air pollution. Suspended Particulate Matter, which has been linked to respiratory illnesses has been found in harmful quantities in Pakistan's major urban areas. Some strategies that can be used to effectively manage Pakistan's urban air pollution problems include the advancements to road design and improvement of transport sustainability, increased use of abatement policy by the Pakistani government, and a conversion to clean fuel energy alternatives like CNG.\n\n== Climate change ==\n{{Main|Climate change in Pakistan}}\n{{See also|Indus River#Effects of climate change on the river}}\n\n[[Climate change]] has affected the people and the environment of Pakistan in different ways. Although Pakistan is a relatively small emitter of [[greenhouse gas]] as compared to other countries, the country will, however, be greatly affected by the negative impacts of climate change. According to the Pakistan Economic Survey of 2014-15,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://budget.par.com.pk|title=Pakistan Economic Survey 2014-15, Environment|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Pakistan Federal Budget|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220183353/http://budget.par.com.pk/|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> the \"increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events coupled with erratic monsoon rains causing frequent and intense floods and droughts\" are the most prominent problems Pakistan will face due to climate change. The survey concluded that the change in weather patterns has destroyed infrastructures, has taken many lives and has had devastating impacts on the agriculture sector, which has in turn has affected Pakistan's economy.\n\nAccording to the BBC Climate Asia report,<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/mediaaction/pdf/climateasia/reports/ClimateAsia_PakistanReport.pdf|title=Pakistan, How the people of Pakistan live with climate change and what communication can do|last=Zaheer|first=Khadija|last2=Colom|first2=Anna|date=|website=www.bbc.co.uk/climateasia|publisher=BBC Media Action|access-date=}}</ref> the majority of the Pakistani people surveyed claimed that climate change has heavily impacted their lives in the form of floods and droughts, and most importantly has affected the availability of resources such as energy and water. 53% of Pakistanis felt that their lives had become worse off than they were five years ago. Although the effects of climate change are evident, the survey found that the majority of the people were unaware of the meaning of climate change, and \"ascribed changes in climate and extreme weather events to the will of God.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Natural disasters ==\n{{Main|List of natural disasters in Pakistan}}\nDue to Pakistan's diverse land and climatic conditions, it is prone to different forms of natural disasters, including [[earthquake]]s, [[flood]]s, [[tsunami]]s, [[drought]]s, [[cyclone]]s and hurricanes.<ref name=\":02\" /> A disaster management report claims that the provinces of [[Gilgit-Baltistan]] (GB), [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] and [[Azad Kashmir|AJK]] are vulnerable seismic regions and hence highly susceptible to earthquakes, while [[Sindh]] and [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]] constantly suffer from floods because they are low-lying areas.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Irshad|first=Muhammad|last2=Ali|first2=Arshad|last3=Iqbal|first3=Shahid|date=April\u2013June 2015|title=Disaster Management System of Pakistan|journal=Acta Technica Corvininesis- Bulletin of Engineering|volume=8|issue=2|issn=2067-3809}}</ref>\n\nSome of the worst natural disasters that Pakistan has faced include the [[1935 Quetta earthquake]] when around 60,000 people were killed, the 1950 floods when an estimated 2900 people died and 900,000 people were left homeless, the [[1974 Hunza earthquake]] where around 5300 people were killed, the [[2005 Kashmir earthquake|2005 Kashmir quake]] that killed at least 73,000 and affected more than 1.5 million people, and the [[2010 Pakistan floods|Pakistan floods of 2010]] where 20 million people were affected.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/661518/ten-worst-disasters-in-pakistan|title=Ten worst disasters in Pakistan|date=2011-09-24|newspaper=DAWN.COM|access-date=2016-11-12}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation efforts==\n{{Main|Conservation in Pakistan}}\nThe government has expressed concern about environmental threats to economic growth and social development and since the early 1990s has addressed environmental concerns with new legislation and institutions such as the Pakistan Environment Protection Council. However, foreign lenders provide most environmental protection funds, and only 0.04 percent of the government's development budget goes to environmental protection. Thus, the government's ability to enforce environmental regulations is limited, and private industries often lack the funds to meet environmental standards established by international trade organizations. Government of Pakistan start new compagin with Clean and Green Pakistan to over come environmental issues.\n\n=== Clean Green Champion Program ===\nAn initiative named Clean Green Pakistan was launched in 2019 by Government of Pakistan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.ramizansari.com/2019/11/25/pm-launches-clean-green-champion-program/|title=PM Launches Clean Green Champion Program|last=Ansari|first=Ramiz|date=2019-11-25|website=Blog by Ramiz Ansari|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref> The idea of initiative was to held a competition between cities of Pakistan in Cleanliness and Greenery.

Short fim like \"Green Election Compagin\" and \" Stop \" is a part of Cean Green Pakistan Effort.\n\n===National Conservation Strategy===\nThe \n Conservation Strategy Report has three explicit objectives: conservation of natural resources, promotion of sustainable development, and improvement of efficiency in the use and management of resources. It sees itself as a \"call for action\" addressed to central and provincial governments, businesses, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), local communities, and individuals.\n\nThe primary agricultural nonpoint source pollutants are nutrients (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus), sediment, animal wastes, pesticides, and salts. Agricultural nonpoint sources enter surface water through direct [[surface runoff]] or through seepage to ground water that discharges to a surface water outlet. Various farming activities result in the erosion of soil particles. The sediment produced by erosion can damage fish habitat and wetlands, and often transports excess agricultural chemicals resulting in contaminated runoff. This runoff, in turn, affects changes to aquatic habitat such as temperature increases and decreased oxygen. The most common sources of excess nutrients in surface water from nonpoint sources are chemical fertilizers and manure from animal facilities. Such nutrients cause eutrophication in surface water. Pesticides used for pest control in agricultural operations can also contaminate surface as well as ground-water resources. Return flows, runoff, and [[leach ate]] from irrigated lands may transport sediment, nutrients, salts, and other materials. Finally, improper grazing practices in riparian areas, as well as upland areas, can also cause water quality degradation. The development of Pakistan is viewed as a multigenerational enterprise.\n\nIn seeking to tranform attitudes and practices, the National Conservation Strategy recognizes that two key changes in values are needed: the restoration of the conservation ethic derived from [[Islam]]ic moral values, called Qantas, and the revival of community spirit and responsibility, Haqooq ul Ibad.\n\nThe National Conservation Strategy Report recommends fourteen program areas for priority implementation: maintaining soils in [[farm|croplands]], increasing efficiency of [[irrigation]], protecting watersheds, supporting forestry and plantations, restoring rangelands and improving livestock, protecting water bodies and sustaining fisheries, conserving biodiversity, increasing energy efficiency, developing and deploying renewable resources, preventing or decreasing pollution, managing urban wastes, supporting institutions to manage common resources, integrating population and environmental programs, and preserving the cultural heritage. It identifies sixty-eight specific programs in these areas, each with a long-term goal and expected outputs and physical investments required within ten years. Special attention has been paid to the potential roles of environmental NGOs, women's organizations, and international NGOs in working with the government in its conservation efforts. Recommendations from the National Conservation Strategy Report are incorporated in the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1993\u201398).\n\nIn a recent study conducted by the Global CLEAN campaign, it was found that the average temperature in Pakistan had risen by .2 degrees in only two years, This is a dramatic change and puts emphasis on climate change campaigns.\n\n'''Land use'''\n* Arable land - 27%\n* Permanent crops - 1%\n* Permanent pastures - 6%\n* Forests and woodland - 5%\n* Other - 61% (1993 est.)\n* Irrigated land - 171,100&nbsp;km\u00b2 (1993 est.)\n\n===Protected areas===\n{{Main|Protected areas of Pakistan}}\nPakistan has 14 [[National Parks|national parks]], 72 [[Wildlife Sanctuary|wildlife sanctuaries]], 66 [[game reserve]]s, 9 marine and littoral protected areas, 19 protected [[Ramsar convention|wetlands]] and a number of other protected [[grassland]]s, [[shrubland]]s, [[woodland]]s and [[natural monument]]s.\n\n====International agreements====\nPakistan is a party to several international agreements related to environment and climate.

The main source of this pollution is the traffic noise caused by buses, cars, trucks, [[Pulled rickshaw|rickshaws]] and water tankers. A study showed that on one of Karachi's main roads, the average noise level was around 90&nbsp;dB and was capable of reaching about 110&nbsp;dB. This is much higher than the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]'s noise level standard of 70&nbsp;dB, which is not meant to be harmful to the human ear. However, the study also concluded that in Pakistan, \"the traffic noise levels limit as laid down by National Environment Quality standards, Environmental Protection Agency is 85 dB\".<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Traffic Noise Pollution in Karachi, Pakistan|url=http://lumhs.edu.pk/jlumhs/Vol09No03/pdfs/v9n3oa09.pdf|journal=Journal of Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences|volume=09}}</ref>\n\nThis high level of noise pollution can cause auditory and non-auditory health issues. Auditory issues include the loss of auditory sensory cells; non-auditory health issues include sleep disturbance, noise and cardiovascular disease, [[Endocrine system|endocrine]] response to noise and psychiatric disorder.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Exploring Noise Pollution, Source and its impacts: an anthropological Study of rawalpindi city|url=http://www.sci-int.com/pdf/3641762493rd%20Paper%20Noise%20615-616.pdf|journal=Pakistan Association of Anthropology|volume=|issn=1013-5316|access-date=2016-11-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804132348/http://sci-int.com/pdf/3641762493rd%20Paper%20Noise%20615-616.pdf|archive-date=2016-08-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> There are very few, vague laws and policies in regards to noise levels.

According to a World Bank report, \"Karachi's urban air pollution is among the most severe in the world and it engenders significant damages to human health and the economy\". The inefficient use of energy, an increase in the number of vehicles used daily, an increase in unregulated industrial emissions and the burning of garbage and plastic have contributed the most to air pollution in urban areas. According to a recent study, the Sindh Environment Protection Department claims that the average level of pollution in big cities is approximately four times higher than the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organisation]]'s limits. These emissions have detrimental effects, including \"[[respiratory disease]]s, reduced visibility, loss of vegetation and an effect on the growth of plants.\"\n\nOne of the greatest contributors to air pollution is industrial activity. The inadequate air emission treatments and lack of regulatory control over industrial activity has contributed to the deterioration of ambient air quality in major cities. In addition, the common practice of burning massive amounts of solid waste, including plastic and rubber, on street corners by the public, releases toxic gases, which are extremely harmful for residents in the area.\n\nIn 2018, a young entrepreneur in Karachi, Abid Omar, launched the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative to monitor air quality in Pakistan's big cities. The project aims to increase the availability of air quality data in Pakistan and make citizens more aware of the health impacts of air pollution.<ref>https://thediplomat.com/2018/08/pakistans-rising-air-pollution-crisis/</ref> The US State Department has set up three high-quality air quality monitoring stations at three locations in Pakistan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pk.usembassy.gov/u-s-mission-pakistan-starts-publishing-air-quality-data/|title=U.S. Mission Pakistan Starts Publishing Air Quality Data|date=2019-04-30|website=U.S. Embassy & Consulates in Pakistan|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-01}}</ref>\n\nSpecifically, studies have revealed the negative consequences air pollution can have on the welfare of those impacted. Studies have revealed how the constant fluctuation of particulate matter poses a major threat to Pakistan\u2019s citizens who are frequently exposes to harmful levels of air pollution. Suspended Particulate Matter, which has been linked to respiratory illnesses has been found in harmful quantities in Pakistan's major urban areas. Some strategies that can be used to effectively manage Pakistan's urban air pollution problems include the advancements to road design and improvement of transport sustainability, increased use of abatement policy by the Pakistani government, and a conversion to clean fuel energy alternatives like CNG.\n\n== Climate change ==\n{{Main|Climate change in Pakistan}}\n{{See also|Indus River#Effects of climate change on the river}}\n\n[[Climate change]] has affected the people and the environment of Pakistan in different ways. Although Pakistan is a relatively small emitter of [[greenhouse gas]] as compared to other countries, the country will, however, be greatly affected by the negative impacts of climate change. According to the Pakistan Economic Survey of 2014-15,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://budget.par.com.pk|title=Pakistan Economic Survey 2014-15, Environment|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Pakistan Federal Budget|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220183353/http://budget.par.com.pk/|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> the \"increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather events coupled with erratic monsoon rains causing frequent and intense floods and droughts\" are the most prominent problems Pakistan will face due to climate change. The survey concluded that the change in weather patterns has destroyed infrastructures, has taken many lives and has had devastating impacts on the agriculture sector, which has in turn has affected Pakistan's economy.\n\nAccording to the BBC Climate Asia report,<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/mediaaction/pdf/climateasia/reports/ClimateAsia_PakistanReport.pdf|title=Pakistan, How the people of Pakistan live with climate change and what communication can do|last=Zaheer|first=Khadija|last2=Colom|first2=Anna|date=|website=www.bbc.co.uk/climateasia|publisher=BBC Media Action|access-date=}}</ref> the majority of the Pakistani people surveyed claimed that climate change has heavily impacted their lives in the form of floods and droughts, and most importantly has affected the availability of resources such as energy and water. 53% of Pakistanis felt that their lives had become worse off than they were five years ago.

However, foreign lenders provide most environmental protection funds, and only 0.04 percent of the government's development budget goes to environmental protection. Thus, the government's ability to enforce environmental regulations is limited, and private industries often lack the funds to meet environmental standards established by international trade organizations. Government of Pakistan start new compagin with Clean and Green Pakistan to over come environmental issues.\n\n=== Clean Green Champion Program ===\nAn initiative named Clean Green Pakistan was launched in 2019 by Government of Pakistan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.ramizansari.com/2019/11/25/pm-launches-clean-green-champion-program/|title=PM Launches Clean Green Champion Program|last=Ansari|first=Ramiz|date=2019-11-25|website=Blog by Ramiz Ansari|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref> The idea of initiative was to held a competition between cities of Pakistan in Cleanliness and Greenery.

Short fim like \"Green Election Compagin\" and \" Stop \" is a part of Cean Green Pakistan Effort.\n\n===National Conservation Strategy===\nThe \n Conservation Strategy Report has three explicit objectives: conservation of natural resources, promotion of sustainable development, and improvement of efficiency in the use and management of resources. It sees itself as a \"call for action\" addressed to central and provincial governments, businesses, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), local communities, and individuals.\n\nThe primary agricultural nonpoint source pollutants are nutrients (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus), sediment, animal wastes, pesticides, and salts. Agricultural nonpoint sources enter surface water through direct [[surface runoff]] or through seepage to ground water that discharges to a surface water outlet. Various farming activities result in the erosion of soil particles. The sediment produced by erosion can damage fish habitat and wetlands, and often transports excess agricultural chemicals resulting in contaminated runoff. This runoff, in turn, affects changes to aquatic habitat such as temperature increases and decreased oxygen. The most common sources of excess nutrients in surface water from nonpoint sources are chemical fertilizers and manure from animal facilities. Such nutrients cause eutrophication in surface water. Pesticides used for pest control in agricultural operations can also contaminate surface as well as ground-water resources. Return flows, runoff, and [[leach ate]] from irrigated lands may transport sediment, nutrients, salts, and other materials. Finally, improper grazing practices in riparian areas, as well as upland areas, can also cause water quality degradation. The development of Pakistan is viewed as a multigenerational enterprise.\n\nIn seeking to tranform attitudes and practices, the National Conservation Strategy recognizes that two key changes in values are needed: the restoration of the conservation ethic derived from [[Islam]]ic moral values, called Qantas, and the revival of community spirit and responsibility, Haqooq ul Ibad.\n\nThe National Conservation Strategy Report recommends fourteen program areas for priority implementation: maintaining soils in [[farm|croplands]], increasing efficiency of [[irrigation]], protecting watersheds, supporting forestry and plantations, restoring rangelands and improving livestock, protecting water bodies and sustaining fisheries, conserving biodiversity, increasing energy efficiency, developing and deploying renewable resources, preventing or decreasing pollution, managing urban wastes, supporting institutions to manage common resources, integrating population and environmental programs, and preserving the cultural heritage. It identifies sixty-eight specific programs in these areas, each with a long-term goal and expected outputs and physical investments required within ten years. Special attention has been paid to the potential roles of environmental NGOs, women's organizations, and international NGOs in working with the government in its conservation efforts. Recommendations from the National Conservation Strategy Report are incorporated in the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1993\u201398).\n\nIn a recent study conducted by the Global CLEAN campaign, it was found that the average temperature in Pakistan had risen by .2 degrees in only two years, This is a dramatic change and puts emphasis on climate change campaigns.\n\n'''Land use'''\n* Arable land - 27%\n* Permanent crops - 1%\n* Permanent pastures - 6%\n* Forests and woodland - 5%\n* Other - 61% (1993 est.)\n* Irrigated land - 171,100&nbsp;km\u00b2 (1993 est.)\n\n===Protected areas===\n{{Main|Protected areas of Pakistan}}\nPakistan has 14 [[National Parks|national parks]], 72 [[Wildlife Sanctuary|wildlife sanctuaries]], 66 [[game reserve]]s, 9 marine and littoral protected areas, 19 protected [[Ramsar convention|wetlands]] and a number of other protected [[grassland]]s, [[shrubland]]s, [[woodland]]s and [[natural monument]]s.\n\n====International agreements====\nPakistan is a party to several international agreements related to environment and climate.

Soon after, he appeared in commercials for products such as [[Pepsi-Cola]].\n\nHe began his career with bit parts in smaller movies, including ''[[Myra Breckinridge (film)|Myra Breckinridge]]'' (invited on the set by [[Mae West]]<ref name=\"mcall gayrole\"/>), ''[[Coma (1978 film)|Coma]]'', and ''[[The Seven Minutes (film)|The Seven Minutes]]''. He appeared in a number of TV series, mini-series and TV movies. He was also the face of Marlboro cigarettes as the Marlboro Man and [[Revlon]]'s Chaz cologne.<ref name=\"mcall gayrole\"/> Selleck appeared in the commercial for [[Right Guard]] deodorant in 1971, with [[Farrah Fawcett]] in 1972 for the [[aperitif]] [[Dubonnet]], and another in 1977 for the toothpaste [[Close-Up (toothpaste)|Close-Up]].  He was also in a Safeguard deodorant soap commercial (date not available). In 1972, he starred in the B-movie ''[[Daughters of Satan]]''. Still struggling as an unfamiliar TV actor, Selleck had a recurring role in the 1970s as private investigator Lance White in ''[[The Rockford Files]]''.\n\nSelleck is an avid [[outdoorsman]], marksman and [[firearms]] collector. These interests led him to leading-man [[cowboy]] roles in [[Western films]], starting with his role as cowboy and frontier marshal [[Sackett|Orrin Sackett]] in the 1979 film ''[[The Sacketts]]'', opposite [[Sam Elliott]], [[Jeff Osterhage]], and Western legends [[Glenn Ford]] and [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]]. He followed ''The Sacketts'' with ''[[The Shadow Riders (film)|The Shadow Riders]]'' in 1982, then portraying a cat burglar in 1930s London in ''Lassiter'' in 1984.  ''Quigley Down Under'' is probably one of his best-known Western films, although he won a \"Western Heritage Award\" for his 1997 role in ''[[Last Stand at Saber River]]''. In 1979 he starred in ''[[Concrete Cowboys (1979 film)|Concrete Cowboys]]'' with [[Jerry Reed]].\n\n===Magnum stardom===\n[[File:Princess Diana and Tom Selleck at White House C31879-14.jpg|thumb|Selleck meeting [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] at the [[White House]] in November 1985.

Diana is wearing the [[Travolta dress]].]]\nSelleck was an accessible actor, but spent years receiving little interest from the entertainment industry. His big break came when he was cast in the lead role as Thomas Magnum in ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]''. The producers would not release the actor for other projects, so Selleck had to pass on the role of [[Indiana Jones]] in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', which meant that the role went to actor [[Harrison Ford]] instead. It turned out that the shooting of the pilot for ''Magnum'' was delayed for over six months by a [[List of Hollywood strikes|writers' strike]], which would have enabled him to complete ''Raiders''.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://siouxcityjournal.com/entertainment/television/tom-selleck-recalls-magnum-looks-to-blue-bloods-for-change/article_8bf13baf-850b-5a0a-8a70-f7d448cac369.html | title = Tom Selleck recalls 'Magnum,' looks to 'Blue Bloods' for change | first = Bruce R. | last = Miller | work = Sioux City Journal | date = September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|Look, I made a deal with Magnum and it was the best thing that ever happened to me.

Magnum was a former [[U.S. Navy]] Officer, a veteran of a Special Operations unit, \"SEAL\" in the Vietnam War, and later a member of the \"Naval Intelligence Agency\" (a fictional version of the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]]), who had resigned his commission with the Navy to become a private investigator living in Hawaii.  The show would go on for eight seasons and 163 episodes until 1988, winning him an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/tom-selleck | title = Tom Selleck Emmy Award Winner | publisher = Emmys.com | accessdate = December 27, 2013}}</ref> for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in [[36th Primetime Emmy Awards|1984]].\n\nSelleck was famous for his mustache, a Hawaiian-style [[aloha shirt]], a [[Detroit Tigers]] baseball cap, and a Colt MKIV/Series 70 Government Model handgun (a commercial version of the U.S. Military M1911A1) which his character regularly carried. The actual prop from the show was a 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, serial number 70L33101, used for its reliable functioning with readily available blanks; although the original gun was a traditional .45 ACP 1911.  Magnum also used a Star Model B, another 9mm similar to the M1911A1, and a Detonics Pocket 9 during the series.\n\nMagnum drove a [[Ferrari 308 GTB/GTS|Ferrari 308 GTS]] in the series. The model became so identified with the role that Ferrari fans now refer to the red-painted model as a \"Magnum\" Ferrari.\n\nAfter the end of the show in 1988, it established itself as the top-rated one-hour show in the history of syndicated reruns (at least until 1998).<ref name=\"chicagotribune 9802210041\">{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1998-02-21-9802210041-story.html|title=Tom Selleck just does what feels right|website=Chicagotribune.com|date=21 February 1998|author=Mike Duffy}}</ref> Selleck confirmed that he was the most popular choice by fans to play the role of Magnum in the once-rumored ''Magnum, P.I.'' movie.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0698726/ | title = Selleck Wants Back in the Magnum Driver's Seat | website = IMDb.com | date = March 4, 2009 |access-date=July 24, 2016}}</ref> In 1984, he introduced [[Nancy Reagan]] at the [[1984 Republican National Convention]].<ref name=\"mcall gayrole\"/> Selleck was offered the lead role of Mitch Buchannon in ''[[Baywatch]]'', but turned down the role because he did not want to be seen as a sex symbol. The role eventually went to [[David Hasselhoff]].\n\nDuring the Magnum years, he also starred as an [[acrophobia|acrophobic]] police detective in ''[[Runaway (1984 film)|Runaway]]'' and a stand-in father in ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]''.\n\n===TV and advertising===\n[[File:Tom Selleck 2010.jpg|thumb|Tom Selleck at the 2010 Summer Session of the Television Critics Association]]\nIn 1990, he starred as an American 19th-century sharpshooter in the [[Western (genre)#Meat pie Western|Australian western]] ''[[Quigley Down Under]]'', a role and film that he considers one of his best. During the 1990s, he also starred in ''[[Three Men and a Little Lady]]'', ''[[High Road to China]]'', ''[[Lassiter (film)|Lassiter]]'', ''[[Her Alibi]]'', ''[[An Innocent Man (film)|An Innocent Man]]'', ''[[Folks!

Richard was a divorced [[ophthalmologist]] who was a friend of Monica's parents, and at first the relationship was hidden from her parents. The relationship eventually ended over Richard's reluctance to commit to having children, though Selleck did make a few more appearances in later episodes. His decision to star in a six-episode plot of ''Friends'' was seen as a digression from the movies back to TV shows and a mistake by his career advisers. Selleck recruited a new agent and accepted the part.<ref name=\"chicagotribune 9802210041\"/> This role earned him an [[Emmy Award]] nomination in 2000 for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.<ref name=\"cbs 62421\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbs.com/shows/blue_bloods/cast/62421/|title=Biography|website=Cbs.com}}</ref>\n\nHe did the voice-over for the 1993 [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] advertising campaigns titled \"You Will.\" These advertisements had a futuristic feel, and posed the question of, \"What if you had the technology to _____? Well, you will ... and the company that will bring it to you? AT&T.\" \n\nIn the mid-1990s, Selleck hosted a special series on TLC called ''The Practical Guide to the Universe'', in which he talked about the stars, planets, galaxies, etc.\n\nIn February 1998, Selleck accepted the lead role in a sitcom for CBS called ''[[The Closer (1998 TV series)|The Closer]]''. This role was Tom Selleck's big comeback on prime time TV.<ref name=\"chicagotribune 9802210041\"/> In it he played Jack McLaren, a legendary publicist heading up a brand new marketing firm. His costars included [[Ed Asner]], [[David Krumholtz]], and [[Penelope Ann Miller]]. Despite the high pedigree, and the expectations for his first series since ''Magnum, P.I.'', low ratings caused the show to be canceled after ten episodes.\n\nHis last two cowboy roles to date were in the 2001 [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] movie ''[[Crossfire Trail]]'' (based on a [[Louis L'Amour]] novel of the same name), and the 2003 motion picture ''[[Monte Walsh (2003 film)|Monte Walsh]]''. In 2001, Selleck played the lead role of Murray in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival of [[Herb Gardner]]'s comedic play ''[[A Thousand Clowns]]''. It ran for only two months. Critics, though far from uniformly negative about Selleck's performance, generally compared it unfavorably to that of [[Jason Robards|Jason Robards, Jr.]], who won awards in the 1960s for playing the character on the stage and in [[A Thousand Clowns|a movie version]].\n\nSelleck played the role of General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in [[A&E Network|A&E]]'s 2004 made-for-TV movie ''[[Ike: Countdown to D-Day]]''. The movie showed the planning, politics, and preparation for the 1944 [[Invasion of Normandy]], and Selleck was critically lauded for playing a cool, calm Eisenhower.\n\nSince 2005, Selleck has starred in the role of transplanted lawman [[Jesse Stone (character)|Jesse Stone]] in a series of made-for-TV movies based on [[Robert B.

(Son Kevin attended Selleck's alma mater, USC, and became a volleyball team All-American in 1990.) Outrigger Canoe Club teammate Dennis Berg, in the summer 2011 issue of ''Volleyball USA'' magazine, said of Selleck, \"Tom was a great teammate, appreciative of being included with such a talented and experienced group, practicing and playing hard when his ''Magnum'' schedule permitted.... He was very patient with all of us, and we relished the big crowds that replaced the usual sparse number of players' friends and spouses at the national tourney matches.\"<ref>''Volleyball USA'' (Summer 2011), vol 39, no 2 {{OCLC|31165992}}</ref>\n\nSelleck is an avid [[ice hockey]] fan and has been seen attending [[Los Angeles Kings]] games at [[Staples Center]].

Soon after, he appeared in commercials for products such as [[Pepsi-Cola]].\n\nHe began his career with bit parts in smaller movies, including ''[[Myra Breckinridge (film)|Myra Breckinridge]]'' (invited on the set by [[Mae West]]<ref name=\"mcall gayrole\"/>), ''[[Coma (1978 film)|Coma]]'', and ''[[The Seven Minutes (film)|The Seven Minutes]]''. He appeared in a number of TV series, mini-series and TV movies. He was also the face of Marlboro cigarettes as the Marlboro Man and [[Revlon]]'s Chaz cologne.<ref name=\"mcall gayrole\"/> Selleck appeared in the commercial for [[Right Guard]] deodorant in 1971, with [[Farrah Fawcett]] in 1972 for the [[aperitif]] [[Dubonnet]], and another in 1977 for the toothpaste [[Close-Up (toothpaste)|Close-Up]].  He was also in a Safeguard deodorant soap commercial (date not available). In 1972, he starred in the B-movie ''[[Daughters of Satan]]''. Still struggling as an unfamiliar TV actor, Selleck had a recurring role in the 1970s as private investigator Lance White in ''[[The Rockford Files]]''.\n\nSelleck is an avid [[outdoorsman]], marksman and [[firearms]] collector. These interests led him to leading-man [[cowboy]] roles in [[Western films]], starting with his role as cowboy and frontier marshal [[Sackett|Orrin Sackett]] in the 1979 film ''[[The Sacketts]]'', opposite [[Sam Elliott]], [[Jeff Osterhage]], and Western legends [[Glenn Ford]] and [[Ben Johnson (actor)|Ben Johnson]]. He followed ''The Sacketts'' with ''[[The Shadow Riders (film)|The Shadow Riders]]'' in 1982, then portraying a cat burglar in 1930s London in ''Lassiter'' in 1984.  ''Quigley Down Under'' is probably one of his best-known Western films, although he won a \"Western Heritage Award\" for his 1997 role in ''[[Last Stand at Saber River]]''. In 1979 he starred in ''[[Concrete Cowboys (1979 film)|Concrete Cowboys]]'' with [[Jerry Reed]].\n\n===Magnum stardom===\n[[File:Princess Diana and Tom Selleck at White House C31879-14.jpg|thumb|Selleck meeting [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] at the [[White House]] in November 1985.

Diana is wearing the [[Travolta dress]].]]\nSelleck was an accessible actor, but spent years receiving little interest from the entertainment industry. His big break came when he was cast in the lead role as Thomas Magnum in ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]''. The producers would not release the actor for other projects, so Selleck had to pass on the role of [[Indiana Jones]] in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', which meant that the role went to actor [[Harrison Ford]] instead. It turned out that the shooting of the pilot for ''Magnum'' was delayed for over six months by a [[List of Hollywood strikes|writers' strike]], which would have enabled him to complete ''Raiders''.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://siouxcityjournal.com/entertainment/television/tom-selleck-recalls-magnum-looks-to-blue-bloods-for-change/article_8bf13baf-850b-5a0a-8a70-f7d448cac369.html | title = Tom Selleck recalls 'Magnum,' looks to 'Blue Bloods' for change | first = Bruce R. | last = Miller | work = Sioux City Journal | date = September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{cquote|Look, I made a deal with Magnum and it was the best thing that ever happened to me.

Magnum was a former [[U.S. Navy]] Officer, a veteran of a Special Operations unit, \"SEAL\" in the Vietnam War, and later a member of the \"Naval Intelligence Agency\" (a fictional version of the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]]), who had resigned his commission with the Navy to become a private investigator living in Hawaii.  The show would go on for eight seasons and 163 episodes until 1988, winning him an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/tom-selleck | title = Tom Selleck Emmy Award Winner | publisher = Emmys.com | accessdate = December 27, 2013}}</ref> for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series in [[36th Primetime Emmy Awards|1984]].\n\nSelleck was famous for his mustache, a Hawaiian-style [[aloha shirt]], a [[Detroit Tigers]] baseball cap, and a Colt MKIV/Series 70 Government Model handgun (a commercial version of the U.S. Military M1911A1) which his character regularly carried. The actual prop from the show was a 9\u00d719mm Parabellum, serial number 70L33101, used for its reliable functioning with readily available blanks; although the original gun was a traditional .45 ACP 1911.  Magnum also used a Star Model B, another 9mm similar to the M1911A1, and a Detonics Pocket 9 during the series.\n\nMagnum drove a [[Ferrari 308 GTB/GTS|Ferrari 308 GTS]] in the series. The model became so identified with the role that Ferrari fans now refer to the red-painted model as a \"Magnum\" Ferrari.\n\nAfter the end of the show in 1988, it established itself as the top-rated one-hour show in the history of syndicated reruns (at least until 1998).<ref name=\"chicagotribune 9802210041\">{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1998-02-21-9802210041-story.html|title=Tom Selleck just does what feels right|website=Chicagotribune.com|date=21 February 1998|author=Mike Duffy}}</ref> Selleck confirmed that he was the most popular choice by fans to play the role of Magnum in the once-rumored ''Magnum, P.I.'' movie.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0698726/ | title = Selleck Wants Back in the Magnum Driver's Seat | website = IMDb.com | date = March 4, 2009 |access-date=July 24, 2016}}</ref> In 1984, he introduced [[Nancy Reagan]] at the [[1984 Republican National Convention]].<ref name=\"mcall gayrole\"/> Selleck was offered the lead role of Mitch Buchannon in ''[[Baywatch]]'', but turned down the role because he did not want to be seen as a sex symbol. The role eventually went to [[David Hasselhoff]].\n\nDuring the Magnum years, he also starred as an [[acrophobia|acrophobic]] police detective in ''[[Runaway (1984 film)|Runaway]]'' and a stand-in father in ''[[Three Men and a Baby]]''.\n\n===TV and advertising===\n[[File:Tom Selleck 2010.jpg|thumb|Tom Selleck at the 2010 Summer Session of the Television Critics Association]]\nIn 1990, he starred as an American 19th-century sharpshooter in the [[Western (genre)#Meat pie Western|Australian western]] ''[[Quigley Down Under]]'', a role and film that he considers one of his best. During the 1990s, he also starred in ''[[Three Men and a Little Lady]]'', ''[[High Road to China]]'', ''[[Lassiter (film)|Lassiter]]'', ''[[Her Alibi]]'', ''[[An Innocent Man (film)|An Innocent Man]]'', ''[[Folks!

Richard was a divorced [[ophthalmologist]] who was a friend of Monica's parents, and at first the relationship was hidden from her parents. The relationship eventually ended over Richard's reluctance to commit to having children, though Selleck did make a few more appearances in later episodes. His decision to star in a six-episode plot of ''Friends'' was seen as a digression from the movies back to TV shows and a mistake by his career advisers. Selleck recruited a new agent and accepted the part.<ref name=\"chicagotribune 9802210041\"/> This role earned him an [[Emmy Award]] nomination in 2000 for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.<ref name=\"cbs 62421\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbs.com/shows/blue_bloods/cast/62421/|title=Biography|website=Cbs.com}}</ref>\n\nHe did the voice-over for the 1993 [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] advertising campaigns titled \"You Will.\" These advertisements had a futuristic feel, and posed the question of, \"What if you had the technology to _____? Well, you will ... and the company that will bring it to you? AT&T.\" \n\nIn the mid-1990s, Selleck hosted a special series on TLC called ''The Practical Guide to the Universe'', in which he talked about the stars, planets, galaxies, etc.\n\nIn February 1998, Selleck accepted the lead role in a sitcom for CBS called ''[[The Closer (1998 TV series)|The Closer]]''. This role was Tom Selleck's big comeback on prime time TV.<ref name=\"chicagotribune 9802210041\"/> In it he played Jack McLaren, a legendary publicist heading up a brand new marketing firm. His costars included [[Ed Asner]], [[David Krumholtz]], and [[Penelope Ann Miller]]. Despite the high pedigree, and the expectations for his first series since ''Magnum, P.I.'', low ratings caused the show to be canceled after ten episodes.\n\nHis last two cowboy roles to date were in the 2001 [[Turner Network Television|TNT]] movie ''[[Crossfire Trail]]'' (based on a [[Louis L'Amour]] novel of the same name), and the 2003 motion picture ''[[Monte Walsh (2003 film)|Monte Walsh]]''. In 2001, Selleck played the lead role of Murray in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revival of [[Herb Gardner]]'s comedic play ''[[A Thousand Clowns]]''. It ran for only two months. Critics, though far from uniformly negative about Selleck's performance, generally compared it unfavorably to that of [[Jason Robards|Jason Robards, Jr.]], who won awards in the 1960s for playing the character on the stage and in [[A Thousand Clowns|a movie version]].\n\nSelleck played the role of General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in [[A&E Network|A&E]]'s 2004 made-for-TV movie ''[[Ike: Countdown to D-Day]]''. The movie showed the planning, politics, and preparation for the 1944 [[Invasion of Normandy]], and Selleck was critically lauded for playing a cool, calm Eisenhower.\n\nSince 2005, Selleck has starred in the role of transplanted lawman [[Jesse Stone (character)|Jesse Stone]] in a series of made-for-TV movies based on [[Robert B. Parker]]'s novels. To date, the series comprises nine films, with the most recent released in October 2015.<ref name=\"eight\">{{cite web | url = http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/01/26/emmy-and-golden-globe-award-winner-tom-selleck-stars-in-jesse-stone-benefit-of-the-doubt-a-new-television-movie-to-be-broadcast-sunday-may-20-082404/20120126cbs03/ | title = Emmy and Golden Globe Award Winner Tom Selleck Stars in \"Jesse Stone: Benefit Of The Doubt,\" a New Television Movie To Be Broadcast Sunday, May 20 | website = The Futon Critic.com | accessdate = January 26, 2012}}</ref> In addition to his portrayal of the films' protagonist, Selleck now acts as producer for the series.

(Son Kevin attended Selleck's alma mater, USC, and became a volleyball team All-American in 1990.) Outrigger Canoe Club teammate Dennis Berg, in the summer 2011 issue of ''Volleyball USA'' magazine, said of Selleck, \"Tom was a great teammate, appreciative of being included with such a talented and experienced group, practicing and playing hard when his ''Magnum'' schedule permitted.... He was very patient with all of us, and we relished the big crowds that replaced the usual sparse number of players' friends and spouses at the national tourney matches.\"<ref>''Volleyball USA'' (Summer 2011), vol 39, no 2 {{OCLC|31165992}}</ref>\n\nSelleck is an avid [[ice hockey]] fan and has been seen attending [[Los Angeles Kings]] games at [[Staples Center]].

Many white horses have dark eyes, though some have blue eyes.  In contrast to gray horses which are born with pigmented skin they keep for life and pigmented hair that lightens to white with age, truly white horses are born with white hair and mostly pink, unpigmented skin.  Some white horses are born with partial pigmentation in their skin and hair, which may or may not be retained as they mature, but when a white horse lightens, both skin and hair lose pigmentation.   In contrast, grays retain skin pigment and only the  hair becomes white.\n\nWhite colorings, whether [[Horse markings|white markings]], [[Pinto horse|white patterns]] or [[dominant white]] are collectively known as depigmentation [[phenotype]]s, and are all caused by areas of skin that lack pigment cells ([[melanocyte]]s).<ref name=rieder2008>{{cite journal |url=http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/esm115v1 |title=Genetic Analysis of White Facial and Leg Markings in the Swiss Franches-Montagnes Horse Breed |last=Rieder |first=Stefan |author2=Christian Hagger |author3=Gabriela Obexer-Ruff |author4=Tosso Leeb |author5=Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Poncet |journal=Journal of Heredity |publisher=The American Genetic Association |doi=10.1093/jhered/esm115 |date=2008-02-21 |accessdate=2009-07-03 |quote=Phenotypes may vary from tiny depigmentated body spots to white head and leg markings, further on to large white spotting and finally nearly complete depigmentation in white-born horses...White markings result from the lack of melanocytes in the hair follicles and the skin...A completely pigmented head or leg depends on the complete migration and clonal proliferation of the melanoblasts in the mesoderm of the developing fetus, thus ensuring that limbs and the head acquire a full complement of melanocytes |volume=99 |pages=130\u20136 |pmid=18296388 |issue=2|doi-access=free }}</ref> Depigmentation phenotypes have various genetic causes, and those that have been studied usually map to the ''[[EDNRB]]'' and ''[[CD117|KIT]]'' genes.

Dominant white has been studied in [[Thoroughbred]]s, [[Arabian horse]]s, the [[American creme and white horse registry|American White horse]], the [[Camarillo White Horse|Camarillo White horse]], and several other breeds. There are 27 identified variants of dominant white as of 2017, plus [[sabino horse|sabino 1]], each corresponding to a spontaneously-white foundation animal and a [[mutation]] on the ''[[CD117|KIT]]'' gene. Researchers have suggested that at least some forms of dominant white result in nonviable embryos in the homozygous state, though others are known to be viable as homozygotes. While homologous mutations in mice are often linked to [[anemia]] and [[infertility|sterility]], no such effects have been observed in dominant white horses. Dominant white horses typically have white noses that can be subject to [[sunburn]].\n\n===Sabino-white===\n{{main|Sabino horse}}\nSabino-white horses are pink-skinned with all-white or nearly-white coats and dark eyes.

Affected [[foal]]s are carried to term and at birth appear normal, though they have pink-skinned all-white or nearly-white coats and blue eyes. However, the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] of these foals cannot function due to the [[aganglionosis|absence of nerve cells]], and the condition cannot be treated. Foals with Lethal White Syndrome invariably die of [[Horse colic|colic]] within 72 hours, and are usually humanely [[euthanize]]d.  Carriers of the gene, who are healthy and normal, can be identified  by a [[DNA test]]. While carriers often exhibit the \"frame overo\" pattern, this is not a dispositive trait and testing is necessary, as the pattern can appear in a minimal form as normal [[Horse markings|white markings]] or be masked by other white spotting genes.\n\n==Horses that appear white, but are not==\n[[File:Cabalo044eue.jpg|thumb|This horse is gray, not white. Its hair coat is completely white, but its underlying skin, seen around the eye and muzzle, is black.]]\nTrue white horses have unpigmented pink skin and unpigmented white hair, though eye color varies. The lack of pigment in the skin and hair is caused by the absence of pigment-producing cells called [[melanocyte]]s. Some coat colors are characterized by light or white-like coats and even pinkish skin, however these white-like coats are not lacking melanocytes. Instead, white-like coat colors result from various changes in the ways melanocytes produce [[Melanin|pigment]].\n\n===Gray===\n{{main|Gray (horse)}}\n[[Gray (horse)|Gray]] horses have the most common \"white-like\" coat color. However, the most noticeable difference between a gray horse whose hair coat is completely white and a white horse is skin color: most gray horses have black skin and dark eyes, white horses have light, unpigmented skin.  The gray gene does not affect skin or eye color, so grays typically have dark skin and eyes, as opposed to the unpigmented pink skin of true white horses.<ref name=locke2002>{{cite journal |title=Linkage of the grey coat colour locus to microsatellites on horse chromosome 25 |last=Locke |first=MM |author2=MCT Penedo |author3=SJ Bricker |author4=LV Millon |author5=JD Murray  |year=2002 |publisher=International Society for Animal Genetics |journal=Animal Genetics |volume=33 |pages=329\u2013337 |quote=The progressive loss of colour in the hair of grey horses is controlled by a dominantly inherited allele at the Grey locus (GG).

Although the rate at which horses will turn grey is variable, the amount of white hair increases with age until the coat is completely white at maturity. Pigmentation of the skin and eyes is not affected by GG. Dark skin distinguishes the grey phenotype from that of pink-skinned cremello and white horses. |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2052.2002.00885.x |pmid=12354140 |issue=5}}</ref>  The skin and eyes may be other colors if influenced by other factors such as [[Horse markings|white markings]], certain [[Pinto horse|white spotting patterns]] or [[dilution gene]]s.

This same hair coat shade would be considered [[cremello]] if the horse had double cream dilution, but still would not be white.]]\n\n===Diluted coat colors===\n{{main|dilution gene}}\nTrue white hair is rooted in unpigmented skin that lacks melanocytes. In contrast, diluted coat colors have melanocytes, but vary due to the concentration or chemical structure of the pigments made by these pigment-producing cells, not the absence of the cells themselves.  There are at least five known types of pigment dilution in horses, three which, as described below, can act to produce off-white phenotypes. Horses with strongly diluted coat colors usually have pale blue eyes, cream-colored coats, and rosy-pink skin. [[Horse markings|White markings]] are usually visible upon closer inspection.\n\n* The '''[[Cream gene]]''' produces two types of diluted color.  '''Cremellos''', '''perlinos''', and '''smoky creams''' have rosy-pink skin, pale blue eyes, and cream-colored coats that can appear almost white. These coat colors, collectively called \"double dilutes\" or \"blue-eyed creams\", result when a horse is [[homozygous]] for the [[cream gene]]. When [[heterozygous]], the cream gene is also responsible for [[palomino]] and [[buckskin (horse)|buckskin]].  A few Palominos have a very light hair coat is occasionally mistaken for either cremello or white.  White markings and patterns are visible against the slightly-pigmented coat and skin.

The iris pigment epithelium prevents damaging light scattering within the eye. Blue-eyed humans and mammals have little or no pigment in the stroma, but retain pigment in the iris pigment epithelium. If pigment is missing from both the stroma and the iris pigment epithelium, the only pigment in the eye is the hemoglobin in blood vessels.

In contrast, grays retain skin pigment and only the  hair becomes white.\n\nWhite colorings, whether [[Horse markings|white markings]], [[Pinto horse|white patterns]] or [[dominant white]] are collectively known as depigmentation [[phenotype]]s, and are all caused by areas of skin that lack pigment cells ([[melanocyte]]s).<ref name=rieder2008>{{cite journal |url=http://jhered.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/esm115v1 |title=Genetic Analysis of White Facial and Leg Markings in the Swiss Franches-Montagnes Horse Breed |last=Rieder |first=Stefan |author2=Christian Hagger |author3=Gabriela Obexer-Ruff |author4=Tosso Leeb |author5=Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Poncet |journal=Journal of Heredity |publisher=The American Genetic Association |doi=10.1093/jhered/esm115 |date=2008-02-21 |accessdate=2009-07-03 |quote=Phenotypes may vary from tiny depigmentated body spots to white head and leg markings, further on to large white spotting and finally nearly complete depigmentation in white-born horses...White markings result from the lack of melanocytes in the hair follicles and the skin...A completely pigmented head or leg depends on the complete migration and clonal proliferation of the melanoblasts in the mesoderm of the developing fetus, thus ensuring that limbs and the head acquire a full complement of melanocytes |volume=99 |pages=130\u20136 |pmid=18296388 |issue=2|doi-access=free }}</ref> Depigmentation phenotypes have various genetic causes, and those that have been studied usually map to the ''[[EDNRB]]'' and ''[[CD117|KIT]]'' genes.

In contrast, diluted coat colors have melanocytes, but vary due to the concentration or chemical structure of the pigments made by these pigment-producing cells, not the absence of the cells themselves.  There are at least five known types of pigment dilution in horses, three which, as described below, can act to produce off-white phenotypes. Horses with strongly diluted coat colors usually have pale blue eyes, cream-colored coats, and rosy-pink skin. [[Horse markings|White markings]] are usually visible upon closer inspection.\n\n* The '''[[Cream gene]]''' produces two types of diluted color.  '''Cremellos''', '''perlinos''', and '''smoky creams''' have rosy-pink skin, pale blue eyes, and cream-colored coats that can appear almost white. These coat colors, collectively called \"double dilutes\" or \"blue-eyed creams\", result when a horse is [[homozygous]] for the [[cream gene]]. When [[heterozygous]], the cream gene is also responsible for [[palomino]] and [[buckskin (horse)|buckskin]].  A few Palominos have a very light hair coat is occasionally mistaken for either cremello or white.  White markings and patterns are visible against the slightly-pigmented coat and skin. The cream gene is not known to be associated with any health problems.\n* '''Pearl-Cream pseudo-double dilute''' occurs when a horse has one cream gene and one [[pearl gene]].

Eyes are pigmented at the front of the iris called the [[stroma of iris|stroma]], and in a thin layer at the back of the iris in tissue called the [[iris pigment epithelium]]. The iris pigment epithelium prevents damaging light scattering within the eye. Blue-eyed humans and mammals have little or no pigment in the stroma, but retain pigment in the iris pigment epithelium. If pigment is missing from both the stroma and the iris pigment epithelium, the only pigment in the eye is the hemoglobin in blood vessels. This accounts for the reddish appearance of eyes in some types of albinism.<ref name=retina>{{cite book |title=Text Atlas of the Retina |last=Hamilton |first=Peter |author2=Richard Gregson |author3=Gary Edd Fish  |edition=1 |publisher=Informa Health Care |year=1997 |isbn=1-85317-226-X |page=151 |quote=In the most severe form, the latter may look pink since the only pigment present is hemoglobin within the iris blood vessels}}</ref>\n\nIn research mammals, such as mice, albinism is more strictly defined. Albino mice occur due to a recessive mutation of the ''C'' gene.

Likewise, most white horses used in movies are actually [[Gray (horse)|grays]], in part because they are easier to find.\n\nHowever, there are a few truly white horses who were used in film.  One of the best-known examples was \"Silver,\" ridden by the [[Lone Ranger]], a role actually played by two different white horses.  At least one horse who played \"Topper,\" ridden by [[Hopalong Cassidy]], was also white.  Another famous white horse is [[Yukichan]]<!--[[:ja:\u30e6\u30ad\u30c1\u30e3\u30f3|Yukichan]]-->, a Japanese [[Thoroughbred]] racehorse who won the Kanto Oaks at [[Kawasaki Racecourse]].<ref>[http://www.pedigreequery.com/yukichan Yukichan horse pedigreequery]</ref>\n\n==Mythology==\n{{main|White horse (mythology)}}\nThroughout history, white horses have been [[White horse (mythology)|mythologized]] in many cultures.

One was led by the State museums sector, evidencing pioneering technology, and the other by the railway industry, in which the key contribution came from the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]] as successors to the historic [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]].\n\nWhat became the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] collection was begun in the 1860s by the Patent Office,<ref>{{cite book|last=Liffen|first= John|editor-last=Lewis|editor-first= M.

Sometimes relics were stored in company workshops and offices and some were destroyed as circumstances changed. Where put on public display at all the equipment was usually mounted on railway stations in a case or on a plinth.  ''Coppernob'' at [[Barrow-in-Furness]], ''Derwent'' and ''Locomotion'' at [[Darlington]] and ''Tiny'' at [[Newton Abbot]] were long-lived examples of this form of display.\n\nThe first railway museums were opened at Hamar in [[Norway]] (1896)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/norway/central-norway/hamar/sights/museums-galleries/norwegian-railway-museum|title=Attractions in Hamar, Norway|first=Lonely|last=Planet|date=|website=lonelyplanet.com}}</ref> and [[Nuremberg]] in [[Germany]] (1899).

Indeed, two of the [[Great Western Railway]]\u2019s earliest broad-gauge locomotives, ''North Star'' and ''Lord of the Isles'', which had been set aside at [[Swindon Works]], were cut up in 1906 for lack of space and several other relics were similarly lost in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Barker|first=Robert|title='Lost' preserved railway rolling stock|journal=Transport History|volume=9|pages=100\u20139|year=1978}}</ref>\n\n[[File:LNER Museum.jpg|thumb|Stirling Single in the old LNER Museum]]\nFrom 1880, J.

It was only when the NRM was formed that Britain acquired a rail-served railway museum where large exhibits could come and go with ease.\n\nThe collection was dominated by items from the North Eastern Railway, together with [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] items. The other three \u2018[[Big Four British railway companies|Big Four]]\u2019 railway companies showed little interest in contributing to the LNER's initiative, though eventually one locomotive representative of each did find its way there: the Great Western's [[GWR 3700 Class 3440 City of Truro|''City of Truro'']], [[London and North Western Railway]] ''Columbine'' and [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] [[LB&SCR B1 Class|B1 Class]] ''Gladstone''.\n\nThe GWR assembled a valuable collection of small objects, mounted privately in a long corridor at [[London Paddington station|Paddington station]], and in 1925 it built a replica of ''North Star''. It preserved ''City of Truro''<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Harris|editor-first= Nigel|title=City of Truro, a locomotive legend|publisher=Silver Link Publishing|location=Carnforth|year=1985|isbn=0-947971-02-5}}</ref> and ''Tiny'' in 1931 and purchased ''Shannon'' for preservation in 1946.\n\nThe LMS had its own collection of small objects at [[Euston railway station|Euston]]. It also began to build up a collection of historic locomotives, which included [[Caledonian Railway Single|Caledonian 123]], ''Columbine'', ''Cornwall'', ''Hardwicke'', Highland 103, Midland 118 and ''Pet''. Three others, set aside for preservation at [[Crewe Works]], were scrapped in a change of policy in 1932. The LMS set aside one further locomotive (Midland 158A) before it was overtaken by nationalisation. It also succeeded in preserving a collection of historic royal saloons at [[Wolverton]] and built a replica ''Rocket'', with six replica carriages, for the [[Liverpool & Manchester Railway]] centenary in 1930, and a replica [[Grand Junction Railway]] Travelling Post Office.\n\nThe [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] inherited three preserved carriages of the [[Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway]], long displayed at York and at [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]], but otherwise had no policy of preserving redundant equipment. ''Ryde'' was preserved from 1934 until cut up in 1940; the only other locomotive preserved by the Southern was ''Boxhill'' in 1947. (''Gladstone'' was preserved by the [[Stephenson Locomotive Society]] as a private initiative and much later (in 1959) donated to the [[British Transport Commission]].)\n[[File:GNR C2 990 'Henry Oakley' at Doncaster Works.JPG|thumb|right|[[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] [[GNR Class C1 (small boiler)|Class C1]] 990 ''Henry Oakley'', first [[4-4-2 (locomotive)|Atlantic]] in Britain, at its birthplace, [[Doncaster Works]] ]]\n\nThe [[nationalisation of British Railways]] in 1948 gave the opportunity for a more consolidated approach and a report was produced by the British Transport Commission in 1951.<ref>\n\n{{cite book|title=The Preservation of Relics and Records: report to the British Transport Commission|publisher=British Transport Commission|location=London|year=1951}}</ref>\n\nAmongst other things this recommended a curator be appointed for the Commission's holdings (John M.

One was led by the State museums sector, evidencing pioneering technology, and the other by the railway industry, in which the key contribution came from the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]] as successors to the historic [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]].\n\nWhat became the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] collection was begun in the 1860s by the Patent Office,<ref>{{cite book|last=Liffen|first= John|editor-last=Lewis|editor-first= M.

Sometimes relics were stored in company workshops and offices and some were destroyed as circumstances changed. Where put on public display at all the equipment was usually mounted on railway stations in a case or on a plinth.  ''Coppernob'' at [[Barrow-in-Furness]], ''Derwent'' and ''Locomotion'' at [[Darlington]] and ''Tiny'' at [[Newton Abbot]] were long-lived examples of this form of display.\n\nThe first railway museums were opened at Hamar in [[Norway]] (1896)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/norway/central-norway/hamar/sights/museums-galleries/norwegian-railway-museum|title=Attractions in Hamar, Norway|first=Lonely|last=Planet|date=|website=lonelyplanet.com}}</ref> and [[Nuremberg]] in [[Germany]] (1899). These inspired talk of doing the same in Britain, both in the 1890s and again in 1908,<ref>{{cite book|last=Steel|first= Ernest A. |last2=Steel |first2=Elenora H.|title=The Miniature World of Henry Greenly|publisher=Model & Allied Publications|location=Kings Langley|year=1973|isbn=0-85242-306-3|pages=45\u20138}}</ref> but this came to nothing at that time. Indeed, two of the [[Great Western Railway]]\u2019s earliest broad-gauge locomotives, ''North Star'' and ''Lord of the Isles'', which had been set aside at [[Swindon Works]], were cut up in 1906 for lack of space and several other relics were similarly lost in subsequent years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Barker|first=Robert|title='Lost' preserved railway rolling stock|journal=Transport History|volume=9|pages=100\u20139|year=1978}}</ref>\n\n[[File:LNER Museum.jpg|thumb|Stirling Single in the old LNER Museum]]\nFrom 1880, J.

It was only when the NRM was formed that Britain acquired a rail-served railway museum where large exhibits could come and go with ease.\n\nThe collection was dominated by items from the North Eastern Railway, together with [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] items. The other three \u2018[[Big Four British railway companies|Big Four]]\u2019 railway companies showed little interest in contributing to the LNER's initiative, though eventually one locomotive representative of each did find its way there: the Great Western's [[GWR 3700 Class 3440 City of Truro|''City of Truro'']], [[London and North Western Railway]] ''Columbine'' and [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] [[LB&SCR B1 Class|B1 Class]] ''Gladstone''.\n\nThe GWR assembled a valuable collection of small objects, mounted privately in a long corridor at [[London Paddington station|Paddington station]], and in 1925 it built a replica of ''North Star''. It preserved ''City of Truro''<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Harris|editor-first= Nigel|title=City of Truro, a locomotive legend|publisher=Silver Link Publishing|location=Carnforth|year=1985|isbn=0-947971-02-5}}</ref> and ''Tiny'' in 1931 and purchased ''Shannon'' for preservation in 1946.\n\nThe LMS had its own collection of small objects at [[Euston railway station|Euston]]. It also began to build up a collection of historic locomotives, which included [[Caledonian Railway Single|Caledonian 123]], ''Columbine'', ''Cornwall'', ''Hardwicke'', Highland 103, Midland 118 and ''Pet''. Three others, set aside for preservation at [[Crewe Works]], were scrapped in a change of policy in 1932. The LMS set aside one further locomotive (Midland 158A) before it was overtaken by nationalisation.

{"title_page": "Series (mathematics)", "text_new": "{{short description|Infinite sum}}\n{{about|infinite sums|finite sums|Summation}}\n{{Calculus}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''series''' is, roughly speaking, a description of the operation of adding infinitely many quantities, one after the other, to a given starting quantity.<ref>{{cite book |title=Calculus Made Easy |last1=Thompson |first1=Silvanus |authorlink1=Silvanus P. Thompson |last2=Gardner |first2=Martin |authorlink2=Martin Gardner |date=1998 |isbn=978-0-312-18548-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/calculusmadeeasy00thom_0 }}</ref>  The study of series is a major part of [[calculus]] and its generalization, [[mathematical analysis]]. Series are used in most areas of mathematics, even for studying finite structures (such as in [[combinatorics]]), through [[generating function]]s. In addition to their ubiquity in mathematics, infinite series are also widely used in other quantitative disciplines such as [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[statistics]] and [[finance]].\n\nFor a long time, the idea that such a [[potential infinity|potentially infinite]] summation could produce a finite result was considered [[paradox]]ical. This paradox was resolved using the concept of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] during the 19th century. [[Zeno's paradox]] of [[Achilles and the tortoise]] illustrates this counterintuitive property of infinite sums: Achilles runs after a tortoise, but when he reaches the position of the tortoise at the beginning of the race, the tortoise has reached a second position; when he reaches this second position, the tortoise is at a third position, and so on. [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] concluded that Achilles could ''never'' reach the tortoise, and thus that movement does not exist. Zeno divided the race into infinitely many sub-races, each requiring a finite amount of time, so that the total time for Achilles to catch the tortoise is given by a series.  The resolution of the paradox is that, although the series has an infinite number of terms, it has a finite sum, which gives the time necessary for Achilles to catch up with the tortoise.\n\nIn modern terminology, any (ordered) [[Sequence (mathematics)|infinite sequence]] <math>(a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots)</math> of [[Term (mathematics)|terms]] (that is, numbers, [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], or anything that can be added) defines a series, which is the operation of adding the {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} one after the other. To emphasize that there are an infinite number of terms, a series may be called an '''infinite series'''. Such a series is represented (or denoted) by an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] like\n: <math>a_1+a_2+a_3+\\cdots,</math>\nor, using the [[summation sign]],\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty a_i.</math>\n\nThe infinite sequence of additions implied by a series cannot be effectively carried on (at least in a finite amount of time). However, if the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] to which the terms and their finite sums belong has a notion of [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]], it is sometimes possible to assign a value to a series, called the sum of the series. This value is the limit as {{math|''n''}}  tends to infinity (if the limit exists) of the finite sums of the {{math|''n''}} first terms of the series, which are called the {{math|''n''}}th '''partial sums''' of the series. That is,\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty a_i  = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i.</math>\nWhen this limit exists, one says that the series is '''convergent''' or '''summable''', or that the sequence <math>(a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots)</math> is '''summable'''. In this case, the limit is called the '''sum''' of the series. Otherwise, the series is said to be '''divergent'''.\n\nGenerally, the terms of a series come from a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]], often the [[Field (mathematics)|field]] <math>\\mathbb R</math> of the [[real number]]s or the field <math>\\mathbb C</math> of the [[complex number]]s. In this case, the set of all series is itself a ring (and even an [[associative algebra]]), in which the addition consists of adding the series term by term, and the multiplication is the [[Cauchy product]].\n\n==Basic properties==\n\nAn infinite series or simply a series is an infinite sum, represented by an [[infinite expression]] of the form<ref name=\"SW501\">{{harvnb|Swokowski|1983|loc=p. 501}}</ref>\n:<math>a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots, </math>\nwhere <math>(a_n)</math> is any ordered [[sequence]] of [[term (mathematics)|terms]], such as [[number]]s, [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], or anything else that can be [[addition|added]] (an [[abelian group]]).  This is an expression that is obtained from the list of terms <math>a_0,a_1,\\dots</math> by laying them side by side, and conjoining them with the symbol \"+\".  A series may also be represented by using [[Summation#Capital-sigma notation|summation notation]], such as\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_n </math> .\n\nIf an abelian group ''A'' of terms has a concept of [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] (for example, if it is a [[metric space]]), then some series, the [[convergent series]], can be interpreted as having a value in ''A'', called the ''sum of the series''. This includes the common cases from calculus in which the group is the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers. Given a series <math>s=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n,</math> its ''k''th '''partial sum''' is\n:<math>s_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{k}a_n = a_0 + a_1 + \\cdots + a_k.</math>\nBy definition, the series <math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n</math> ''converges'' to the limit {{math|''L''}} (or simply ''sums'' to {{math|''L''}}), if the sequence of its partial sums has a limit {{math|''L''}}.<ref name=\"SW501\" /> In this case, one usually writes\n:<math>L = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_n.</math>\nA series is said to be ''convergent'' if it converges to some limit or ''divergent'' when it does not.  The value of this limit, if it exists, is then the value of the series.\n\n===Convergent series===\n[[File:Geometric sequences.svg|thumb|right|Illustration of 3 [[geometric series]] with partial sums from 1 to 6 terms. The dashed line represents the limit.]]\nA series {{math|\u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is said to [[Convergent series|converge]] or to ''be convergent'' when the sequence {{math|(''s''<sub>''k''</sub>)}} of partial sums has a finite [[Limit of a sequence|limit]]. If the limit of {{math|''s''<sub>''k''</sub>}} is infinite or does not exist, the series is said to [[Divergent series|diverge]].<ref>{{citation|title=Calculus|author=Michael Spivak}}</ref> When the limit of partial sums exists, it is called the value (or sum) of the series\n\n: <math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} s_k = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\sum_{n=0}^k a_n.</math>\n\nAn easy way that an infinite series can converge is if all the ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are zero for ''n'' sufficiently large.  Such a series can be identified with a finite sum, so it is only infinite in a trivial sense.\n\nWorking out the properties of the series that converge even if infinitely many terms are non-zero is the essence of the study of series. Consider the example\n\n:<math> 1 + \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+\\cdots+ \\frac{1}{2^n}+\\cdots.</math>\n\nIt is possible to \"visualize\" its convergence on the [[real number|real number line]]: we can imagine a line of length 2, with successive segments marked off of lengths 1, \u00bd, \u00bc, etc. There is always room to mark the next segment, because the amount of line remaining is always the same as the last segment marked: when we have marked off \u00bd, we still have a piece of length \u00bd unmarked, so we can certainly mark the next&nbsp;\u00bc.  This argument does not prove that the sum is ''equal'' to 2 (although it is), but it does prove that it is ''at most''&nbsp;2.  In other words, the series has an upper bound. Given that the series converges, proving that it is equal to 2 requires only elementary algebra. If the series is denoted {{math|''S''}}, it can be seen that\n\n:<math>S/2 = \\frac{1+ \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+\\cdots}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+ \\frac{1}{16} +\\cdots.</math>\n\nTherefore,\n\n:<math>S-S/2 = 1 \\Rightarrow S = 2.</math>\n\nThe idiom can be extended to other, equivalent notions of series. For instance, a [[Repeating decimal|recurring decimal]], as in\n\n:<math>x = 0.111\\dots </math>,\n\nencodes the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{10^n}.</math>\n\nSince these series always converge to [[real numbers]] (because of what is called the [[Complete space|completeness property]] of the real numbers), to talk about the series in this way is the same as to talk about the numbers for which they stand.  In particular, the decimal expansion 0.111... can be identified with <sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub>.  This leads to an argument that {{nowrap|1=9 \u00d7 0.111... = 0.999... = 1}}, which only relies on the fact that the limit laws for series preserve the arithmetic operations; this argument is presented in the article [[0.999...]].\n\n==Examples of numerical series==\n{{For|other examples|List of mathematical series|Sums of reciprocals#Infinitely many terms}}\n* A ''[[geometric series]]'' is one where each successive term is produced by multiplying the previous term by a [[Mathematical constant|constant number]] (called the common ratio in this context).

It is thus a [[unary operation]] on sequences. Further, this function is [[Linear map|linear]], and thus is a [[linear operator]] on the [[vector space]] of sequences, denoted \u03a3. The inverse operator is the [[finite difference]] operator, denoted \u0394. These behave as discrete analogs of [[Integral|integration]] and [[derivative|differentiation]], only for series (functions of a natural number) instead of functions of a real variable. For example, the sequence (1, 1, 1, ...) has series (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) as its partial summation, which is analogous to the fact that <math>\\int_0^x 1\\,dt = x.</math>\n\nIn [[computer science]] it is known as [[prefix sum]].\n\n==Properties of series==\nSeries are classified not only by whether they converge or diverge, but also by the properties of the terms a<sub>n</sub> (absolute or conditional convergence); type of convergence of the series (pointwise, uniform); the class of the term a<sub>n</sub> (whether it is a real number, arithmetic progression, trigonometric function); etc.\n\n===Non-negative terms===\nWhen ''a<sub>n</sub>'' is a non-negative real number for every ''n'', the sequence ''S<sub>N</sub>'' of partial sums is non-decreasing. It follows that a series \u2211''a<sub>n</sub>'' with non-negative terms converges if and only if the sequence ''S<sub>N</sub>'' of partial sums is bounded.\n\nFor example, the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2}</math>\n\nis convergent, because the inequality\n\n:<math>\\frac1 {n^2} \\le \\frac{1}{n-1} - \\frac{1}{n}, \\quad n \\ge 2,</math>\n\nand a telescopic sum argument implies that the partial sums are bounded by 2. The exact value of the original series is the [[Basel problem]].\n\n===Absolute convergence===\n{{Main|Absolute convergence}}\nA series\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n</math>\n''converges absolutely'' if the series of [[absolute value]]s\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\left|a_n\\right|</math>\nconverges. This is sufficient to guarantee not only that the original series converges to a limit, but also that any reordering of it converges to the same limit.\n\n===Conditional convergence===\n{{Main|Conditional convergence}}\nA series of real or complex numbers is said to be '''conditionally convergent''' (or '''semi-convergent''') if it is convergent but not absolutely convergent. A famous example is the alternating series\n\n:<math>\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty {(-1)^{n+1}  \\over n} = 1 - {1 \\over 2} + {1 \\over 3} - {1 \\over 4} + {1 \\over 5} - \\cdots,</math>\n\nwhich is convergent (and its sum is equal to&nbsp;ln&nbsp;2), but the series formed by taking the absolute value of each term is the divergent [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]]. The [[Riemann series theorem]] says that any conditionally convergent series can be reordered to make a divergent series, and moreover, if the ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are real and ''S'' is any real number, that one can find a reordering so that the reordered series converges with sum equal to&nbsp;''S''.\n\n[[Abel's test]] is an important tool for handling semi-convergent series. If a series has the form\n\n:<math>\\sum a_n = \\sum \\lambda_n b_n</math>\n\nwhere the partial sums ''B''<sub>''N''</sub>&nbsp;= {{nowrap|''b''<sub>0</sub> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''b<sub>n</sub>''}} are bounded, ''\u03bb''<sub>''n''</sub> has bounded variation, and {{nowrap|lim \u03bb<sub>''n''</sub>&thinsp;''B''<sub>''n''</sub>}} exists:\n\n:<math>\\sup_N \\Bigl| \\sum_{n=0}^N b_n \\Bigr| < \\infty, \\ \\ \\sum |\\lambda_{n+1} - \\lambda_n| < \\infty\\ \\text{and} \\ \\lambda_n B_n \\ \\text{converges,}</math>\n\nthen the series {{nowrap|\u2211&thinsp;''a<sub>n</sub>''}} is convergent.  This applies to the pointwise convergence of many trigonometric series, as in\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{\\sin(n x)}{\\ln n}</math>\n\nwith 0&nbsp;< ''x''&nbsp;< 2\u03c0.  Abel's method consists in writing ''b''<sub>''n''+1</sub>&nbsp;= ''B''<sub>''n''+1</sub>&nbsp;\u2212 ''B''<sub>''n''</sub>, and in performing a transformation similar to [[integration by parts]] (called [[summation by parts]]), that relates the given series {{nowrap|\u2211&thinsp;''a<sub>n</sub>''}} to the absolutely convergent series\n\n:<math> \\sum (\\lambda_n - \\lambda_{n+1}) \\, B_n.</math>\n\n===Evaluation of truncation errors===\nThe evaluation of truncation errors is an important procedure in [[numerical analysis]] (especially [[validated numerics]] and [[computer-assisted proof]]).\n====[[Alternating series]]====\nWhen conditions of the [[alternating series test]] is satisfied by <math>S:=\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty(-1)^m u_m</math>, there is an exact error evaluation.<ref>[https://www.ck12.org/book/CK-12-Calculus-Concepts/section/9.9/ Positive and Negative Terms: Alternating Series]</ref> Set <math>s_n</math> as the partial sum of the given alternating series <math>S:=\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty(-1)^m u_m</math>.

Such a series converges if the [[sequence]] ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> is [[monotone decreasing]] and converges to&nbsp;0. The converse is in general not true.\n* For some specific types of series there are more specialized convergence tests, for instance for [[Fourier series]] there is the [[Dini test]].\n\n==Series of functions==\n{{Main|Function series}}\nA series of real- or complex-valued functions\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty f_n(x)</math>\n\n'''[[Pointwise convergence|converges pointwise]]''' on a set ''E'', if the series converges for each ''x'' in ''E'' as an ordinary series of real or complex numbers.  Equivalently, the partial sums\n:<math>s_N(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^N f_n(x)</math>\nconverge to ''\u0192''(''x'') as ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e for each ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''E''.\n\nA stronger notion of convergence of a series of functions is called '''[[uniform convergence]]'''.  The series converges uniformly if it converges pointwise to the function ''\u0192''(''x''), and the error in approximating the limit by the ''N''th partial sum,\n:<math>|s_N(x) - f(x)|</math>\ncan be made minimal ''independently'' of ''x'' by choosing a sufficiently large ''N''.\n\nUniform convergence is desirable for a series because many properties of the terms of the series are then retained by the limit.  For example, if a series of continuous functions converges uniformly, then the limit function is also continuous.  Similarly, if the ''\u0192''<sub>''n''</sub> are [[integral|integrable]] on a closed and bounded interval ''I'' and converge uniformly, then the series is also integrable on ''I'' and can be integrated term-by-term. Tests for uniform convergence include the [[Weierstrass M-test|Weierstrass' M-test]], [[Abel's uniform convergence test]], [[Dini's test]], and the [[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy criterion]].\n\nMore sophisticated types of convergence of a series of functions can also be defined.  In [[measure theory]], for instance, a series of functions converges [[almost everywhere]] if it converges pointwise except on a certain set of [[null set|measure zero]].  Other [[modes of convergence]] depend on a different [[metric space]] structure on the space of functions under consideration.  For instance, a series of functions '''converges in mean''' on a set ''E'' to a limit function ''\u0192'' provided\n:<math>\\int_E \\left|s_N(x)-f(x)\\right|^2\\,dx \\to 0</math>\nas ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e.\n\n===Power series===\n:{{Main|Power series}}\n\nA '''power series''' is a series of the form\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n(x-c)^n.</math>\n\nThe [[Taylor series]] at a point ''c'' of a function is a power series that, in many cases, converges to the function in a neighborhood of ''c''. For example, the series\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}</math>\nis the Taylor series of <math>e^x</math> at the origin and converges to it for every ''x''.\n\nUnless it converges only at ''x''=''c'', such a series converges on a certain open disc of convergence centered at the point ''c'' in the complex plane, and may also converge at some of the points of the boundary of the disc.  The radius of this disc is known as the [[radius of convergence]], and can in principle be determined from the asymptotics of the coefficients ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>.  The convergence is uniform on [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] (that is, [[compact set|compact]]) subsets of the interior of the disc of convergence: to wit, it is [[Compact convergence|uniformly convergent on compact sets]].\n\nHistorically, mathematicians such as [[Leonhard Euler]] operated liberally with infinite series, even if they were not convergent. When calculus was put on a sound and correct foundation in the nineteenth century, rigorous proofs of the convergence of series were always required.\n\n=== Formal power series ===\n{{main|Formal power series}}\n\nWhile many uses of power series refer to their sums, it is also possible to treat power series as ''formal sums'', meaning that no addition operations are actually performed, and the symbol \"+\" is an abstract symbol of conjunction which is not necessarily interpreted as corresponding to addition. In this setting, the sequence of coefficients itself is of interest, rather than the convergence of the series. Formal power series are used in [[combinatorics]] to describe and study [[sequence]]s that are otherwise difficult to handle, for example, using the method of [[generating function]]s.  The [[Hilbert\u2013Poincar\u00e9 series]] is a formal power series used to study [[graded algebra]]s.\n\nEven if the limit of the power series is not considered, if the terms support appropriate structure then it is possible to define operations such as [[addition]], [[multiplication]], [[derivative]], [[antiderivative]] for power series \"formally\", treating the symbol \"+\" as if it corresponded to addition. In the most common setting, the terms come from a [[commutative ring]], so that the formal power series can be added term-by-term and multiplied via the [[Cauchy product]]. In this case the algebra of formal power series is the [[total algebra]] of the [[monoid]] of [[natural numbers]] over the underlying term ring.<ref>{{citation|author=[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]|title=Algebra|publisher=Springer|year=1989}}: \u00a7III.2.11.</ref>  If the underlying term ring is a [[differential algebra]], then the algebra of formal power series is also a differential algebra, with differentiation performed term-by-term.\n\n===Laurent series===\n{{Main|Laurent series}}\nLaurent series generalize power series by admitting terms into the series with negative as well as positive exponents.  A Laurent series is thus any series of the form\n:<math>\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty a_n x^n.</math>\nIf such a series converges, then in general it does so in an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] rather than a disc, and possibly some boundary points.  The series converges uniformly on compact subsets of the interior of the annulus of convergence.\n\n===Dirichlet series===\n:{{Main|Dirichlet series}}\n\nA [[Dirichlet series]] is one of the form\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty {a_n \\over n^s},</math>\n\nwhere ''s'' is a [[complex number]].  For example, if all ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are equal to 1, then the Dirichlet series is the [[Riemann zeta function]]\n\n:<math>\\zeta(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^s}.</math>\n\nLike the zeta function, Dirichlet series in general play an important role in [[analytic number theory]].  Generally a Dirichlet series converges if the real part of ''s'' is greater than a number called the abscissa of convergence.  In many cases, a Dirichlet series can be extended to an [[analytic function]] outside the domain of convergence by [[analytic continuation]].  For example, the Dirichlet series for the zeta function converges absolutely when Re&nbsp;''s''&nbsp;> 1, but the zeta function can be extended to a holomorphic function defined on <math>\\mathbf{C}\\setminus\\{1\\}</math>&thinsp; with a simple [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]] at&nbsp;1.\n\nThis series can be directly generalized to [[general Dirichlet series]].\n\n===Trigonometric series===\n{{Main|Trigonometric series}}\nA series of functions in which the terms are [[trigonometric function]]s is called a '''trigonometric series''':\n:<math>\\tfrac12 A_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(A_n\\cos nx + B_n \\sin nx\\right).</math>\nThe most important example of a trigonometric series is the [[Fourier series]] of a function.\n\n==History of the theory of infinite series==\n\n===Development of infinite series===\n[[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematician [[Archimedes]] produced the first known summation of an infinite series with a\nmethod that is still used in the area of calculus today. He used the [[method of exhaustion]] to calculate the [[area]] under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of [[Pi|\u03c0]].<ref>{{cite web | title = A history of calculus |author1=O'Connor, J.J.  |author2=Robertson, E.F.  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher = [[University of St Andrews]]| url = http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/The_rise_of_calculus.html |date=February 1996|accessdate= 2007-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ502088&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ502088|title=Archimedes and Pi-Revisited.|first=Bidwell, James|last=K.|date=30 November 1993|journal=School Science and Mathematics|volume=94|issue=3}}</ref>\n\nMathematicians from Kerala, India studied infinite series around 1350 CE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/article/?id=2962|title=Indians predated Newton 'discovery' by 250 years|author=|date=|website=manchester.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century, [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] worked in the new [[decimal]] system on infinite series and published several [[Maclaurin series]]. In 1715, a general method for constructing the [[Taylor series]] for all functions for which they exist was provided by [[Brook Taylor]]. [[Leonhard Euler]] in the 18th century, developed the theory of [[hypergeometric series]] and [[q-series]].\n\n===Convergence criteria===\nThe investigation of the validity of infinite series is considered to begin with [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in the 19th century. Euler had already considered the hypergeometric series\n\n:<math>1 + \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{1\\cdot\\gamma}x + \\frac{\\alpha(\\alpha+1)\\beta(\\beta+1)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\gamma(\\gamma+1)}x^2 + \\cdots</math>\non which Gauss published a memoir in 1812. It established simpler criteria of convergence, and the questions of remainders and the range of convergence.\n\n[[Cauchy]] (1821) insisted on strict tests of convergence; he showed that if two series are convergent their product is not necessarily so, and with him begins the discovery of effective criteria. The terms ''convergence'' and ''divergence'' had been introduced long before by [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|Gregory]] (1668). [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] had given various criteria, and [[Colin Maclaurin]] had anticipated some of Cauchy's discoveries. Cauchy advanced the theory of [[power series]] by his expansion of a complex [[function (mathematics)|function]] in such a form.\n\n[[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] (1826) in his memoir on the [[binomial series]]\n:<math>1 + \\frac{m}{1!}x + \\frac{m(m-1)}{2!}x^2 + \\cdots</math>\n\ncorrected certain of Cauchy's conclusions, and gave a completely\nscientific summation of the series for complex values of <math>m</math> and <math>x</math>. He showed the necessity of considering the subject of continuity in questions of convergence.\n\nCauchy's methods led to special rather than general criteria, and\nthe same may be said of [[Joseph Ludwig Raabe|Raabe]] (1832), who made the first elaborate\ninvestigation of the subject, of [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] (from 1842), whose\nlogarithmic test [[Paul du Bois-Reymond|DuBois-Reymond]] (1873) and [[Alfred Pringsheim|Pringsheim]] (1889) have\nshown to fail within a certain region; of [[Joseph Louis Fran\u00e7ois Bertrand|Bertrand]] (1842), [[Pierre Ossian Bonnet|Bonnet]]\n(1843), [[Carl Johan Malmsten|Malmsten]] (1846, 1847, the latter without integration);\n[[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] (1847), [[Paucker]] (1852), [[Chebyshev]] (1852), and [[Arndt]]\n(1853).\n\nGeneral criteria began with [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] (1835), and have been\nstudied by [[Gotthold Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] (1847), [[Weierstrass]] in his various\ncontributions to the theory of functions, [[Ulisse Dini|Dini]] (1867),\nDuBois-Reymond (1873), and many others. Pringsheim's memoirs (1889) present the most complete general theory.\n\n===Uniform convergence===\nThe theory of [[uniform convergence]] was treated by Cauchy (1821), his\nlimitations being pointed out by Abel, but the first to attack it\nsuccessfully were [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel|Seidel]] and [[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] (1847\u201348). Cauchy took up the\nproblem again (1853), acknowledging Abel's criticism, and reaching\nthe same conclusions which Stokes had already found. Thomae used the\ndoctrine (1866), but there was great delay in recognizing the\nimportance of distinguishing between uniform and non-uniform\nconvergence, in spite of the demands of the theory of functions.\n\n===Semi-convergence===\nA series is said to be semi-convergent (or conditionally convergent) if it is convergent but not [[absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]].\n\nSemi-convergent series were studied by Poisson (1823), who also gave a general form for the remainder of the Maclaurin formula. The most important solution of the problem is due, however, to Jacobi (1834),\nwho attacked the question of the remainder from a different standpoint and reached a different formula. This expression was also worked out, and another one given, by [[Carl Johan Malmsten|Malmsten]] (1847).  [[Schl\u00f6milch]] (''Zeitschrift'', Vol.I, p.&nbsp;192, 1856) also improved Jacobi's remainder, and showed the relation between the remainder and [[Faulhaber's formula|Bernoulli's function]]\n\n:<math>F(x) = 1^n + 2^n + \\cdots + (x - 1)^n.</math>\n\n[[Angelo Genocchi|Genocchi]] (1852) has further contributed to the theory.\n\nAmong the early writers was [[Josef Hoene-Wronski|Wronski]], whose \"loi supr\u00eame\" (1815) was hardly recognized until [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] (1873) brought it into\nprominence.\n\n===Fourier series===\n[[Fourier series]] were being investigated\nas the result of physical considerations at the same time that\nGauss, Abel, and Cauchy were working out the theory of infinite\nseries. Series for the expansion of sines and cosines, of multiple\narcs in powers of the sine and cosine of the arc had been treated by\n[[Jacob Bernoulli]] (1702) and his brother [[Johann Bernoulli]] (1701) and still\nearlier by [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]]. Euler and [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] simplified the subject,\nas did [[Louis Poinsot|Poinsot]], [[Karl Schr\u00f6ter|Schr\u00f6ter]], [[James Whitbread Lee Glaisher|Glaisher]], and [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]].\n\nFourier (1807) set for himself a different problem, to\nexpand a given function of ''x'' in terms of the sines or cosines of\nmultiples of ''x'', a problem which he embodied in his ''[[Th\u00e9orie analytique de la chaleur]]'' (1822). Euler had already given the\nformulas for determining the coefficients in the series;\nFourier was the first to assert and attempt to prove the general\ntheorem. [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson|Poisson]] (1820\u201323) also attacked the problem from a\ndifferent standpoint. Fourier did not, however, settle the question\nof convergence of his series, a matter left for [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] (1826) to\nattempt and for Dirichlet (1829) to handle in a thoroughly\nscientific manner (see [[convergence of Fourier series]]). Dirichlet's treatment (''[[Journal f\u00fcr die reine und angewandte Mathematik|Crelle]]'', 1829), of trigonometric series was the subject of criticism and improvement by\nRiemann (1854), Heine, [[Rudolf Lipschitz|Lipschitz]], [[Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli|Schl\u00e4fli]], and\n[[Paul du Bois-Reymond|du Bois-Reymond]]. Among other prominent contributors to the theory of\ntrigonometric and Fourier series were [[Ulisse Dini|Dini]], [[Charles Hermite|Hermite]], [[Georges Henri Halphen|Halphen]],\nKrause, Byerly and [[Paul \u00c9mile Appell|Appell]].\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Asymptotic series===\n[[Asymptotic series]], otherwise [[asymptotic expansion]]s, are infinite series whose partial sums become good approximations in the limit of some point of the domain.  In general they do not converge, but they are useful as sequences of approximations, each of which provides a value close to the desired answer for a finite number of terms. The difference is that an asymptotic series cannot be made to produce an answer as exact as desired, the way that convergent series can. In fact, after a certain number of terms, a typical asymptotic series reaches its best approximation; if more terms are included, most such series will produce worse answers.\n\n===Divergent series===\n{{Main|Divergent series}}\nUnder many circumstances, it is desirable to assign a limit to a series which fails to converge in the usual sense.  A [[summability method]] is such an assignment of a limit to a subset of the set of divergent series which properly extends the classical notion of convergence.  Summability methods include [[Ces\u00e0ro summation]], (''C'',''k'') summation, [[Abel summation]], and [[Borel summation]], in increasing order of generality (and hence applicable to increasingly divergent series).\n\nA variety of general results concerning possible summability methods are known.  The [[Silverman\u2013Toeplitz theorem]] characterizes ''matrix summability methods'', which are methods for summing a divergent series by applying an infinite matrix to the vector of coefficients.  The most general method for summing a divergent series is non-constructive, and concerns [[Banach limit]]s.\n\n===Series in topological vector spaces===\nIf ''X'' is a [[Topological Vector Space]] (TVS) and <math>\\left( x_{\\alpha} \\right)_{\\alpha \\in A}</math> is a (possibly [[uncountable]]) family in ''X'' then this family is '''summable'''{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=179-180}} if the limit <math>\\lim_{H \\in \\mathcal{F}(A)} x_{H}</math> of the [[Net (mathematics)|net]] <math>\\left( x_H \\right)_{H \\in \\mathcal{F}(A)}</math> converges in ''X'', where <math>\\mathcal{F}(A)</math> is the [[directed set]] of all finite subsets of ''A'' directed by inclusion <math>\\subseteq</math> and <math>x_H := \\sum_{i \\in H} x_i</math>. \n\nIt is called '''[[absolutely summable]]''' if in addition, for every continuous seminorm ''p'' on ''X'', the family <math>\\left( p \\left( x_{\\alpha} \\right) \\right)_{\\alpha \\in A}</math> is summable.\nIf ''X'' is a normable space and if <math>\\left( x_{\\alpha} \\right)_{\\alpha \\in A}</math> is an absolutely summable family in ''X'', then necessarily all but a countable collection of <math>x_{\\alpha}</math>'s are 0. Hence, in normed spaces, it is usually only ever necessary to consider series with countably many terms. \n\nSummable families play an important role in the theory of [[nuclear space]]s.\n\n====Series in Banach spaces====\nThe notion of series can be easily extended to the case of a [[Banach space]].  If ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> is a sequence of elements of a Banach space ''X'', then the series \u03a3''x''<sub>''n''</sub> converges to ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''X'' if the sequence of partial sums of the series tends to ''x''; to wit,\n:<math>\\biggl\\|x - \\sum_{n=0}^N x_n\\biggr\\|\\to 0</math>\nas ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e.\n\nMore generally, convergence of series can be defined in any [[abelian group|abelian]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]].  Specifically, in this case, \u03a3''x''<sub>''n''</sub> converges to ''x'' if the sequence of partial sums converges to ''x''.\n\n===Summations over arbitrary index sets===\nDefinitions may be given for sums over an arbitrary index set {{math|''I''}}.<ref>{{citation|author=Jean Dieudonn\u00e9|title=Foundations of mathematical analysis|publisher=Academic Press}}</ref>  There are two main differences with the usual notion of series: first, there is no specific order given on the set {{math|''I''}}; second, this set {{math|''I''}} may be uncountable.  The notion of convergence needs to be strengthened, because the concept of [[conditional convergence]] depends on the ordering of the index set.\n\nIf <math>a:I \\mapsto G</math> is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] from an [[index set]] {{math|''I''}} to a set {{math|''G''}}, then the \"series\" associated to <math>a</math> is the [[formal sum]] of the elements <math>a(x) \\in G </math> over the index elements <math>x \\in I</math> denoted by the\n:<math>\\sum_{x \\in I} a(x).</math>\n\nWhen the index set is the natural numbers <math>I=\\mathbb{N}</math>, the function <math>a:\\mathbb{N} \\mapsto G</math> is a [[sequence]] denoted by <math>a(n)=a_n</math>. A series indexed on the natural numbers is an ordered formal sum and so we rewrite <math>\\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}</math> as <math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}</math> in order to emphasize the ordering induced by the natural numbers. Thus, we obtain the common notation for a series indexed by the natural numbers\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots.</math>\n\n====Families of non-negative numbers====\nWhen summing a family {''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}, ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', of non-negative numbers, one may define\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\in I}a_i = \\sup \\Bigl\\{ \\sum_{i\\in A}a_i\\,\\big| A \\text{ finite, } A \\subset I\\Bigr\\} \\in [0, +\\infty].</math>\n\nWhen the supremum is finite, the set of ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'' such that ''a<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;> 0 is countable.  Indeed, for every ''n''&nbsp;\u2265 1, the set <math> A_n = \\{ i \\in I \\,:\\, a_i > 1/n \\}</math> is finite, because\n\n:<math> \\frac 1 n \\, \\textrm{card}(A_n) \\le \\sum_{i\\in A_n} a_i  \\le \\sum_{i\\in I}a_i < \\infty.</math>\n\nIf ''I''&thinsp; is countably infinite and enumerated as ''I''&nbsp;= {''i''<sub>0</sub>, ''i''<sub>1</sub>,...} then the above defined sum satisfies\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in I} a_i = \\sum_{k=0}^{+\\infty} a_{i_k},</math>\n\nprovided the value \u221e is allowed for the sum of the series.\n\nAny sum over non-negative reals can be understood as the integral of a non-negative function with respect to the [[counting measure]], which accounts for the many similarities between the two constructions.\n\n====Abelian topological groups====\nLet ''a''&nbsp;: ''I'' \u2192 ''X'', where ''I''&thinsp; is any set and ''X''&thinsp; is an [[abelian group|abelian]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]].  Let ''F''&thinsp; be the collection of all [[finite set|finite]] [[subset]]s of ''I'', with ''F'' viewed as a [[directed set]], [[Partially ordered set|ordered]] under [[inclusion (mathematics)|inclusion]] with [[union (set theory)|union]] as [[join (mathematics)|join]].  Define the sum ''S''&thinsp; of the family ''a'' as the limit\n\n:<math> S = \\sum_{i\\in I}a_i = \\lim \\Bigl\\{\\sum_{i\\in A}a_i\\,\\big| A\\in F\\Bigr\\}</math>\n\nif it exists and say that the family ''a'' is unconditionally summable.  Saying that the sum ''S''&thinsp; is the limit of finite partial sums means that for every neighborhood ''V''&thinsp; of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''<sub>0</sub> of ''I''&thinsp; such that\n\n:<math>S - \\sum_{i \\in A} a_i \\in V, \\quad A \\supset A_0.</math>\n\nBecause ''F''&thinsp; is not [[total order|totally ordered]], this is not a [[limit of a sequence]] of partial sums, but rather of a [[net (mathematics)|net]].<ref name=\"Bourbaki\">{{cite book|title=General Topology: Chapters 1\u20134 |first=Nicolas |last=Bourbaki |authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki |year=1998 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-64241-1 |pages=261\u2013270}}</ref><ref name=\"Choquet\">{{cite book|title=Topology |first=Gustave |last=Choquet |authorlink=Gustave Choquet |year=1966 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-173450-3 |pages=216\u2013231}}</ref>\n\nFor every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a smaller neighborhood ''V''&thinsp; such that ''V''&nbsp;\u2212 ''V''&nbsp;\u2282 ''W''. It follows that the finite partial sums of an unconditionally summable family ''a<sub>i</sub>'', ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', form a ''Cauchy net'', that is, for every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''<sub>0</sub> of ''I''&thinsp; such that\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in A_1} a_i - \\sum_{i \\in A_2} a_i \\in W, \\quad A_1, A_2 \\supset A_0.</math>\n\nWhen ''X''&thinsp; is [[Complete metric space|complete]], a family ''a'' is unconditionally summable in ''X''&thinsp; if and only if the finite sums satisfy the latter Cauchy net condition. When ''X''&thinsp; is complete and ''a<sub>i</sub>'', ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', is unconditionally summable in ''X'', then for every subset ''J''&nbsp;\u2282 ''I'', the corresponding subfamily ''a<sub>j</sub>'', ''j''&nbsp;\u2208 ''J'', is also unconditionally summable in ''X''.\n\nWhen the sum of a family of non-negative numbers, in the extended sense defined before, is finite, then it coincides with the sum in the topological group ''X''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''R'''.\n\nIf a family ''a'' in ''X''&thinsp; is unconditionally summable, then for every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''<sub>0</sub> of ''I''&thinsp; such that ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;\u2208 ''W''&thinsp; for every ''i'' not in ''A''<sub>0</sub>.  If ''X''&thinsp; is [[first-countable space|first-countable]], it follows that the set of ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I''&thinsp; such that ''a<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;\u2260 0 is countable.  This need not be true in a general abelian topological group (see examples below).\n\n====Unconditionally convergent series====\nSuppose that ''I''&nbsp;= '''N'''.  If a family ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''n''&nbsp;\u2208 '''N''', is unconditionally summable in an abelian Hausdorff topological group ''X'', then the series in the usual sense converges and has the same sum,\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbf{N}} a_n.</math>\n\nBy nature, the definition of unconditional summability is insensitive to the order of the summation.  When \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> is unconditionally summable, then the series remains convergent after any permutation ''\u03c3'' of the set '''N''' of indices, with the same sum,\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_{\\sigma(n)} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n.</math>\n\nConversely, if every permutation of a series \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> converges, then the series is unconditionally convergent.  When ''X''&thinsp; is complete, then unconditional convergence is also equivalent to the fact that all subseries are convergent; if ''X''&thinsp; is a Banach space, this is equivalent to say that for every sequence of signs ''\u03b5''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;= \u00b11<!-- this is not about convergence of functions, even less about uniform convergence. -->, the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\varepsilon_n a_n</math>\n\nconverges in ''X''.  If ''X''&thinsp; is a Banach space, then one may define the notion of absolute convergence.  A series \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> of vectors in ''X''&thinsp; converges absolutely if\n\n:<math> \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbf{N}} \\|a_n\\| < +\\infty.</math>\n\nIf a series of vectors in a Banach space converges absolutely then it converges unconditionally, but the converse only holds in finite-dimensional Banach spaces (theorem of {{harvtxt|Dvoretzky|Rogers|1950}}).\n\n====Well-ordered sums====\nConditionally convergent series can be considered if ''I'' is a [[well-ordered]] set, for example, an [[ordinal number]] ''\u03b1''<sub>0</sub>.  One may define by [[transfinite recursion]]:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha + 1} a_\\beta = a_{\\alpha} + \\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha} a_\\beta</math>\n\nand for a limit ordinal ''\u03b1'',\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha} a_\\beta = \\lim_{\\gamma\\to\\alpha} \\sum_{\\beta < \\gamma} a_\\beta</math>\n\nif this limit exists.  If all limits exist up to ''\u03b1''<sub>0</sub>, then the series converges.\n\n====Examples====\n\n{{ordered list\n|1= Given a function ''f''&nbsp;: ''X''\u2192''Y'', with ''Y'' an abelian topological group, define for every ''a''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''X''\n\n:<math>f_a(x)=\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & x\\neq a, \\\\\nf(a) & x=a, \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\na function whose [[support (mathematics)|support]] is a [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] {''a''}.

Actually, one usually assumes more: the family of functions is ''locally finite'', that is, for every ''x'' there is a neighborhood of ''x'' in which all but a finite number of functions vanish.  Any regularity property of the ''\u03c6<sub>i</sub>'',&thinsp; such as continuity, differentiability, that is preserved under finite sums will be preserved for the sum of any subcollection of this family of functions.\n\n|3= On the [[first uncountable ordinal]] \u03c9<sub>1</sub> viewed as a topological space in the [[order topology]], the constant function ''f'': [0,\u03c9<sub>1</sub>) \u2192 [0,\u03c9<sub>1</sub>] given by ''f''(\u03b1) = 1 satisfies\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\alpha\\in[0,\\omega_1)}f(\\alpha) = \\omega_1</math>\n\n(in other words, \u03c9<sub>1</sub> copies of 1 is \u03c9<sub>1</sub>) only if one takes a limit over all ''countable'' partial sums, rather than finite partial sums.

Series are used in most areas of mathematics, even for studying finite structures (such as in [[combinatorics]]), through [[generating function]]s. In addition to their ubiquity in mathematics, infinite series are also widely used in other quantitative disciplines such as [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[statistics]] and [[finance]].\n\nFor a long time, the idea that such a [[potential infinity|potentially infinite]] summation could produce a finite result was considered [[paradox]]ical. This paradox was resolved using the concept of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] during the 19th century. [[Zeno's paradox]] of [[Achilles and the tortoise]] illustrates this counterintuitive property of infinite sums: Achilles runs after a tortoise, but when he reaches the position of the tortoise at the beginning of the race, the tortoise has reached a second position; when he reaches this second position, the tortoise is at a third position, and so on. [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] concluded that Achilles could ''never'' reach the tortoise, and thus that movement does not exist. Zeno divided the race into infinitely many sub-races, each requiring a finite amount of time, so that the total time for Achilles to catch the tortoise is given by a series.  The resolution of the paradox is that, although the series has an infinite number of terms, it has a finite sum, which gives the time necessary for Achilles to catch up with the tortoise.\n\nIn modern terminology, any (ordered) [[Sequence (mathematics)|infinite sequence]] <math>(a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots)</math> of [[Term (mathematics)|terms]] (that is, numbers, [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], or anything that can be added) defines a series, which is the operation of adding the {{math|''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}} one after the other. To emphasize that there are an infinite number of terms, a series may be called an '''infinite series'''. Such a series is represented (or denoted) by an [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] like\n: <math>a_1+a_2+a_3+\\cdots,</math>\nor, using the [[summation sign]],\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty a_i.</math>\n\nThe infinite sequence of additions implied by a series cannot be effectively carried on (at least in a finite amount of time). However, if the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] to which the terms and their finite sums belong has a notion of [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]], it is sometimes possible to assign a value to a series, called the sum of the series. This value is the limit as {{math|''n''}}  tends to infinity (if the limit exists) of the finite sums of the {{math|''n''}} first terms of the series, which are called the {{math|''n''}}th '''partial sums''' of the series. That is,\n:<math>\\sum_{i=1}^\\infty a_i  = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i.</math>\nWhen this limit exists, one says that the series is '''convergent''' or '''summable''', or that the sequence <math>(a_1,a_2,a_3,\\ldots)</math> is '''summable'''. In this case, the limit is called the '''sum''' of the series. Otherwise, the series is said to be '''divergent'''.\n\nGenerally, the terms of a series come from a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]], often the [[Field (mathematics)|field]] <math>\\mathbb R</math> of the [[real number]]s or the field <math>\\mathbb C</math> of the [[complex number]]s. In this case, the set of all series is itself a ring (and even an [[associative algebra]]), in which the addition consists of adding the series term by term, and the multiplication is the [[Cauchy product]].\n\n==Basic properties==\n\nAn infinite series or simply a series is an infinite sum, represented by an [[infinite expression]] of the form<ref name=\"SW501\">{{harvnb|Swokowski|1983|loc=p. 501}}</ref>\n:<math>a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots, </math>\nwhere <math>(a_n)</math> is any ordered [[sequence]] of [[term (mathematics)|terms]], such as [[number]]s, [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], or anything else that can be [[addition|added]] (an [[abelian group]]).  This is an expression that is obtained from the list of terms <math>a_0,a_1,\\dots</math> by laying them side by side, and conjoining them with the symbol \"+\".  A series may also be represented by using [[Summation#Capital-sigma notation|summation notation]], such as\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_n </math> .\n\nIf an abelian group ''A'' of terms has a concept of [[limit (mathematics)|limit]] (for example, if it is a [[metric space]]), then some series, the [[convergent series]], can be interpreted as having a value in ''A'', called the ''sum of the series''. This includes the common cases from calculus in which the group is the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers. Given a series <math>s=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n,</math> its ''k''th '''partial sum''' is\n:<math>s_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{k}a_n = a_0 + a_1 + \\cdots + a_k.</math>\nBy definition, the series <math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n</math> ''converges'' to the limit {{math|''L''}} (or simply ''sums'' to {{math|''L''}}), if the sequence of its partial sums has a limit {{math|''L''}}.<ref name=\"SW501\" /> In this case, one usually writes\n:<math>L = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}a_n.</math>\nA series is said to be ''convergent'' if it converges to some limit or ''divergent'' when it does not.  The value of this limit, if it exists, is then the value of the series.\n\n===Convergent series===\n[[File:Geometric sequences.svg|thumb|right|Illustration of 3 [[geometric series]] with partial sums from 1 to 6 terms. The dashed line represents the limit.]]\nA series {{math|\u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is said to [[Convergent series|converge]] or to ''be convergent'' when the sequence {{math|(''s''<sub>''k''</sub>)}} of partial sums has a finite [[Limit of a sequence|limit]]. If the limit of {{math|''s''<sub>''k''</sub>}} is infinite or does not exist, the series is said to [[Divergent series|diverge]].<ref>{{citation|title=Calculus|author=Michael Spivak}}</ref> When the limit of partial sums exists, it is called the value (or sum) of the series\n\n: <math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} s_k = \\lim_{k\\to\\infty} \\sum_{n=0}^k a_n.</math>\n\nAn easy way that an infinite series can converge is if all the ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are zero for ''n'' sufficiently large.  Such a series can be identified with a finite sum, so it is only infinite in a trivial sense.\n\nWorking out the properties of the series that converge even if infinitely many terms are non-zero is the essence of the study of series. Consider the example\n\n:<math> 1 + \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+\\cdots+ \\frac{1}{2^n}+\\cdots.</math>\n\nIt is possible to \"visualize\" its convergence on the [[real number|real number line]]: we can imagine a line of length 2, with successive segments marked off of lengths 1, \u00bd, \u00bc, etc. There is always room to mark the next segment, because the amount of line remaining is always the same as the last segment marked: when we have marked off \u00bd, we still have a piece of length \u00bd unmarked, so we can certainly mark the next&nbsp;\u00bc.  This argument does not prove that the sum is ''equal'' to 2 (although it is), but it does prove that it is ''at most''&nbsp;2.  In other words, the series has an upper bound. Given that the series converges, proving that it is equal to 2 requires only elementary algebra. If the series is denoted {{math|''S''}}, it can be seen that\n\n:<math>S/2 = \\frac{1+ \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+\\cdots}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}+ \\frac{1}{4}+ \\frac{1}{8}+ \\frac{1}{16} +\\cdots.</math>\n\nTherefore,\n\n:<math>S-S/2 = 1 \\Rightarrow S = 2.</math>\n\nThe idiom can be extended to other, equivalent notions of series. For instance, a [[Repeating decimal|recurring decimal]], as in\n\n:<math>x = 0.111\\dots </math>,\n\nencodes the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{10^n}.</math>\n\nSince these series always converge to [[real numbers]] (because of what is called the [[Complete space|completeness property]] of the real numbers), to talk about the series in this way is the same as to talk about the numbers for which they stand.  In particular, the decimal expansion 0.111... can be identified with <sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub>.  This leads to an argument that {{nowrap|1=9 \u00d7 0.111... = 0.999... = 1}}, which only relies on the fact that the limit laws for series preserve the arithmetic operations; this argument is presented in the article [[0.999...]].\n\n==Examples of numerical series==\n{{For|other examples|List of mathematical series|Sums of reciprocals#Infinitely many terms}}\n* A ''[[geometric series]]'' is one where each successive term is produced by multiplying the previous term by a [[Mathematical constant|constant number]] (called the common ratio in this context).  Example:\n::<math>1 + {1 \\over 2} + {1 \\over 4} + {1 \\over 8} + {1 \\over 16} + \\cdots=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty{1 \\over 2^n}.</math>\n:In general, the geometric series\n::<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty z^n</math>\n:converges [[if and only if]] <math display=\"inline\">|z| < 1</math>.\n* [[Hypergeometric series]]:\n:<math>_rF_s \\left[ \\begin{matrix}a_1, a_2, \\dotsc, a_r \\\\ b_1, b_2, \\dotsc, b_s \\end{matrix}; z \\right] := \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(a_1)_n (a_2)_n \\dotsb (a_r)_n}{(b_1)_n (b_2)_n \\dotsb (b_s)_n \\; n!} z^n</math>\nand their generalizations (such as [[basic hypergeometric series]] and [[elliptic hypergeometric series]]) frequently appear in [[integrable systems]] and [[mathematical physics]].<ref>Gasper, G., Rahman, M. (2004). Basic hypergeometric series.

The value of the series is then ''b''<sub>1</sub> \u2212 ''L''.\n* There are some elementary series whose convergence is not yet known/proven. For example, it is unknown whether the Flint Hills series {{anchor|Flint Hills series|Flint Hills Series}}\n::<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{\\csc^{2} n}{n^{3}}</math>\n:converges or not. The convergence depends on how well <math>\\pi</math> can be approximated with rational numbers (which is unknown as of yet). More specifically, the values of ''n'' with large numerical contributions to the sum are the numerators of the continued fraction convergents of <math>\\pi</math>, a sequence beginning with 1, 3, 22, 333, 355, 103993, ... {{OEIS|A046947}}. These are integers that are close to <math>n\\pi</math> for some integer ''n'', so that <math>\\sin n\\pi</math> is close to 0 and its reciprocal is large. Alekseyev (2011) proved that if the series converges, then the [[irrationality measure]] of <math>\\pi</math> is smaller than 2.5, which is much smaller than the current known bound of 7.10320533....<ref>Max A.

It is thus a [[unary operation]] on sequences. Further, this function is [[Linear map|linear]], and thus is a [[linear operator]] on the [[vector space]] of sequences, denoted \u03a3. The inverse operator is the [[finite difference]] operator, denoted \u0394. These behave as discrete analogs of [[Integral|integration]] and [[derivative|differentiation]], only for series (functions of a natural number) instead of functions of a real variable. For example, the sequence (1, 1, 1, ...) has series (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) as its partial summation, which is analogous to the fact that <math>\\int_0^x 1\\,dt = x.</math>\n\nIn [[computer science]] it is known as [[prefix sum]].\n\n==Properties of series==\nSeries are classified not only by whether they converge or diverge, but also by the properties of the terms a<sub>n</sub> (absolute or conditional convergence); type of convergence of the series (pointwise, uniform); the class of the term a<sub>n</sub> (whether it is a real number, arithmetic progression, trigonometric function); etc.\n\n===Non-negative terms===\nWhen ''a<sub>n</sub>'' is a non-negative real number for every ''n'', the sequence ''S<sub>N</sub>'' of partial sums is non-decreasing. It follows that a series \u2211''a<sub>n</sub>'' with non-negative terms converges if and only if the sequence ''S<sub>N</sub>'' of partial sums is bounded.\n\nFor example, the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n = 1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^2}</math>\n\nis convergent, because the inequality\n\n:<math>\\frac1 {n^2} \\le \\frac{1}{n-1} - \\frac{1}{n}, \\quad n \\ge 2,</math>\n\nand a telescopic sum argument implies that the partial sums are bounded by 2. The exact value of the original series is the [[Basel problem]].\n\n===Absolute convergence===\n{{Main|Absolute convergence}}\nA series\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n</math>\n''convergec absolutely'' if the series of [[absolute value]]s\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\left|a_n\\right|</math>\nconverges. This is sufficient to guarantee not only that the original series converges to a limit, but also that any reordering of it converges to the same limit.\n\n===Conditional convergence===\n{{Main|Conditional convergence}}\nA series of real or complex numbers is said to be '''conditionally convergent''' (or '''semi-convergent''') if it is convergent but not absolutely convergent. A famous example is the alternating series\n\n:<math>\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^\\infty {(-1)^{n+1}  \\over n} = 1 - {1 \\over 2} + {1 \\over 3} - {1 \\over 4} + {1 \\over 5} - \\cdots,</math>\n\nwhich is convergent (and its sum is equal to&nbsp;ln&nbsp;2), but the series formed by taking the absolute value of each term is the divergent [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]]. The [[Riemann series theorem]] says that any conditionally convergent series can be reordered to make a divergent series, and moreover, if the ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are real and ''S'' is any real number, that one can find a reordering so that the reordered series converges with sum equal to&nbsp;''S''.\n\n[[Abel's test]] is an important tool for handling semi-convergent series. If a series has the form\n\n:<math>\\sum a_n = \\sum \\lambda_n b_n</math>\n\nwhere the partial sums ''B''<sub>''N''</sub>&nbsp;= {{nowrap|''b''<sub>0</sub> + \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 + ''b<sub>n</sub>''}} are bounded, ''\u03bb''<sub>''n''</sub> has bounded variation, and {{nowrap|lim \u03bb<sub>''n''</sub>&thinsp;''B''<sub>''n''</sub>}} exists:\n\n:<math>\\sup_N \\Bigl| \\sum_{n=0}^N b_n \\Bigr| < \\infty, \\ \\ \\sum |\\lambda_{n+1} - \\lambda_n| < \\infty\\ \\text{and} \\ \\lambda_n B_n \\ \\text{converges,}</math>\n\nthen the series {{nowrap|\u2211&thinsp;''a<sub>n</sub>''}} is convergent.  This applies to the pointwise convergence of many trigonometric series, as in\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{\\sin(n x)}{\\ln n}</math>\n\nwith 0&nbsp;< ''x''&nbsp;< 2\u03c0.  Abel's method consists in writing ''b''<sub>''n''+1</sub>&nbsp;= ''B''<sub>''n''+1</sub>&nbsp;\u2212 ''B''<sub>''n''</sub>, and in performing a transformation similar to [[integration by parts]] (called [[summation by parts]]), that relates the given series {{nowrap|\u2211&thinsp;''a<sub>n</sub>''}} to the absolutely convergent series\n\n:<math> \\sum (\\lambda_n - \\lambda_{n+1}) \\, B_n.</math>\n\n===Evaluation of truncation errors===\nThe evaluation of truncation errors is an important procedure in [[numerical analysis]] (especially [[validated numerics]] and [[computer-assisted proof]]).\n====[[Alternating series]]====\nWhen conditions of the [[alternating series test]] is satisfied by <math>S:=\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty(-1)^m u_m</math>, there is an exact error evaluation.<ref>[https://www.ck12.org/book/CK-12-Calculus-Concepts/section/9.9/ Positive and Negative Terms: Alternating Series]</ref> Set <math>s_n</math> as the partial sum of the given alternating series <math>S:=\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty(-1)^m u_m</math>.

When the ratio is less than 1, but not less than a constant less than 1, convergence is possible but this test does not establish it.\n* [[Root test]]: If there exists a constant ''C''&nbsp;< 1 such that |''a''<sub>''n''</sub>|<sup>1/''n''</sup>&nbsp;\u2264 ''C'' for all sufficiently large&nbsp;''n'', then \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> converges absolutely.\n* [[Integral test for convergence|Integral test]]: if ''\u0192''(''x'') is a positive [[monotone decreasing]] function defined on the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] <nowiki>[</nowiki>1, \u221e<nowiki>)</nowiki><!--DO NOT \"FIX\" THE \"TYPO\" IN THE FOREGOING.

Such a series converges if the [[sequence]] ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> is [[monotone decreasing]] and converges to&nbsp;0. The converse is in general not true.\n* For some specific types of series there are more specialized convergence tests, for instance for [[Fourier series]] there is the [[Dini test]].\n\n==Series of functions==\n{{Main|Function series}}\nA series of real- or complex-valued functions\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty f_n(x)</math>\n\n'''[[Pointwise convergence|converges pointwise]]''' on a set ''E'', if the series converges for each ''x'' in ''E'' as an ordinary series of real or complex numbers.  Equivalently, the partial sums\n:<math>s_N(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^N f_n(x)</math>\nconverge to ''\u0192''(''x'') as ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e for each ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''E''.\n\nA stronger notion of convergence of a series of functions is called '''[[uniform convergence]]'''.  The series converges uniformly if it converges pointwise to the function ''\u0192''(''x''), and the error in approximating the limit by the ''N''th partial sum,\n:<math>|s_N(x) - f(x)|</math>\ncan be made minimal ''independently'' of ''x'' by choosing a sufficiently large ''N''.\n\nUniform convergence is desirable for a series because many properties of the terms of the series are then retained by the limit.  For example, if a series of continuous functions converges uniformly, then the limit function is also continuous.  Similarly, if the ''\u0192''<sub>''n''</sub> are [[integral|integrable]] on a closed and bounded interval ''I'' and converge uniformly, then the series is also integrable on ''I'' and can be integrated term-by-term. Tests for uniform convergence include the [[Weierstrass M-test|Weierstrass' M-test]], [[Abel's uniform convergence test]], [[Dini's test]], and the [[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy criterion]].\n\nMore sophisticated types of convergence of a series of functions can also be defined.  In [[measure theory]], for instance, a series of functions converges [[almost everywhere]] if it converges pointwise except on a certain set of [[null set|measure zero]].  Other [[modes of convergence]] depend on a different [[metric space]] structure on the space of functions under consideration.  For instance, a series of functions '''converges in mean''' on a set ''E'' to a limit function ''\u0192'' provided\n:<math>\\int_E \\left|s_N(x)-f(x)\\right|^2\\,dx \\to 0</math>\nas ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e.\n\n===Power series===\n:{{Main|Power series}}\n\nA '''power series''' is a series of the form\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n(x-c)^n.</math>\n\nThe [[Taylor series]] at a point ''c'' of a function is a power series that, in many cases, converges to the function in a neighborhood of ''c''. For example, the series\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^n}{n!}</math>\nis the Taylor series of <math>e^x</math> at the origin and converges to it for every ''x''.\n\nUnless it converges only at ''x''=''c'', such a series converges on a certain open disc of convergence centered at the point ''c'' in the complex plane, and may also converge at some of the points of the boundary of the disc.  The radius of this disc is known as the [[radius of convergence]], and can in principle be determined from the asymptotics of the coefficients ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>.  The convergence is uniform on [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]] (that is, [[compact set|compact]]) subsets of the interior of the disc of convergence: to wit, it is [[Compact convergence|uniformly convergent on compact sets]].\n\nHistorically, mathematicians such as [[Leonhard Euler]] operated liberally with infinite series, even if they were not convergent. When calculus was put on a sound and correct foundation in the nineteenth century, rigorous proofs of the convergence of series were always required.\n\n=== Formal power series ===\n{{main|Formal power series}}\n\nWhile many uses of power series refer to their sums, it is also possible to treat power series as ''formal sums'', meaning that no addition operations are actually performed, and the symbol \"+\" is an abstract symbol of conjunction which is not necessarily interpreted as corresponding to addition. In this setting, the sequence of coefficients itself is of interest, rather than the convergence of the series. Formal power series are used in [[combinatorics]] to describe and study [[sequence]]s that are otherwise difficult to handle, for example, using the method of [[generating function]]s.  The [[Hilbert\u2013Poincar\u00e9 series]] is a formal power series used to study [[graded algebra]]s.\n\nEven if the limit of the power series is not considered, if the terms support appropriate structure then it is possible to define operations such as [[addition]], [[multiplication]], [[derivative]], [[antiderivative]] for power series \"formally\", treating the symbol \"+\" as if it corresponded to addition. In the most common setting, the terms come from a [[commutative ring]], so that the formal power series can be added term-by-term and multiplied via the [[Cauchy product]]. In this case the algebra of formal power series is the [[total algebra]] of the [[monoid]] of [[natural numbers]] over the underlying term ring.<ref>{{citation|author=[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]|title=Algebra|publisher=Springer|year=1989}}: \u00a7III.2.11.</ref>  If the underlying term ring is a [[differential algebra]], then the algebra of formal power series is also a differential algebra, with differentiation performed term-by-term.\n\n===Laurent series===\n{{Main|Laurent series}}\nLaurent series generalize power series by admitting terms into the series with negative as well as positive exponents.  A Laurent series is thus any series of the form\n:<math>\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^\\infty a_n x^n.</math>\nIf such a series converges, then in general it does so in an [[annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] rather than a disc, and possibly some boundary points.  The series converges uniformly on compact subsets of the interior of the annulus of convergence.\n\n===Dirichlet series===\n:{{Main|Dirichlet series}}\n\nA [[Dirichlet series]] is one of the form\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty {a_n \\over n^s},</math>\n\nwhere ''s'' is a [[complex number]].  For example, if all ''a''<sub>''n''</sub> are equal to 1, then the Dirichlet series is the [[Riemann zeta function]]\n\n:<math>\\zeta(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^s}.</math>\n\nLike the zeta function, Dirichlet series in general play an important role in [[analytic number theory]].  Generally a Dirichlet series converges if the real part of ''s'' is greater than a number called the abscissa of convergence.  In many cases, a Dirichlet series can be extended to an [[analytic function]] outside the domain of convergence by [[analytic continuation]].  For example, the Dirichlet series for the zeta function converges absolutely when Re&nbsp;''s''&nbsp;> 1, but the zeta function can be extended to a holomorphic function defined on <math>\\mathbf{C}\\setminus\\{1\\}</math>&thinsp; with a simple [[pole (complex analysis)|pole]] at&nbsp;1.\n\nThis series can be directly generalized to [[general Dirichlet series]].\n\n===Trigonometric series===\n{{Main|Trigonometric series}}\nA series of functions in which the terms are [[trigonometric function]]s is called a '''trigonometric series''':\n:<math>\\tfrac12 A_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\left(A_n\\cos nx + B_n \\sin nx\\right).</math>\nThe most important example of a trigonometric series is the [[Fourier series]] of a function.\n\n==History of the theory of infinite series==\n\n===Development of infinite series===\n[[Greek mathematics|Greek]] mathematician [[Archimedes]] produced the first known summation of an infinite series with a\nmethod that is still used in the area of calculus today. He used the [[method of exhaustion]] to calculate the [[area]] under the arc of a [[parabola]] with the summation of an infinite series, and gave a remarkably accurate approximation of [[Pi|\u03c0]].<ref>{{cite web | title = A history of calculus |author1=O'Connor, J.J.  |author2=Robertson, E.F.  |lastauthoramp=yes | publisher = [[University of St Andrews]]| url = http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/HistTopics/The_rise_of_calculus.html |date=February 1996|accessdate= 2007-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ502088&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ502088|title=Archimedes and Pi-Revisited.|first=Bidwell, James|last=K.|date=30 November 1993|journal=School Science and Mathematics|volume=94|issue=3}}</ref>\n\nMathematicians from Kerala, India studied infinite series around 1350 CE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/article/?id=2962|title=Indians predated Newton 'discovery' by 250 years|author=|date=|website=manchester.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century, [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] worked in the new [[decimal]] system on infinite series and published several [[Maclaurin series]]. In 1715, a general method for constructing the [[Taylor series]] for all functions for which they exist was provided by [[Brook Taylor]]. [[Leonhard Euler]] in the 18th century, developed the theory of [[hypergeometric series]] and [[q-series]].\n\n===Convergence criteria===\nThe investigation of the validity of infinite series is considered to begin with [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in the 19th century. Euler had already considered the hypergeometric series\n\n:<math>1 + \\frac{\\alpha\\beta}{1\\cdot\\gamma}x + \\frac{\\alpha(\\alpha+1)\\beta(\\beta+1)}{1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\gamma(\\gamma+1)}x^2 + \\cdots</math>\non which Gauss published a memoir in 1812. It established simpler criteria of convergence, and the questions of remainders and the range of convergence.\n\n[[Cauchy]] (1821) insisted on strict tests of convergence; he showed that if two series are convergent their product is not necessarily so, and with him begins the discovery of effective criteria. The terms ''convergence'' and ''divergence'' had been introduced long before by [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|Gregory]] (1668). [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] had given various criteria, and [[Colin Maclaurin]] had anticipated some of Cauchy's discoveries. Cauchy advanced the theory of [[power series]] by his expansion of a complex [[function (mathematics)|function]] in such a form.\n\n[[Niels Henrik Abel|Abel]] (1826) in his memoir on the [[binomial series]]\n:<math>1 + \\frac{m}{1!}x + \\frac{m(m-1)}{2!}x^2 + \\cdots</math>\n\ncorrected certain of Cauchy's conclusions, and gave a completely\nscientific summation of the series for complex values of <math>m</math> and <math>x</math>. He showed the necessity of considering the subject of continuity in questions of convergence.\n\nCauchy's methods led to special rather than general criteria, and\nthe same may be said of [[Joseph Ludwig Raabe|Raabe]] (1832), who made the first elaborate\ninvestigation of the subject, of [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] (from 1842), whose\nlogarithmic test [[Paul du Bois-Reymond|DuBois-Reymond]] (1873) and [[Alfred Pringsheim|Pringsheim]] (1889) have\nshown to fail within a certain region; of [[Joseph Louis Fran\u00e7ois Bertrand|Bertrand]] (1842), [[Pierre Ossian Bonnet|Bonnet]]\n(1843), [[Carl Johan Malmsten|Malmsten]] (1846, 1847, the latter without integration);\n[[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] (1847), [[Paucker]] (1852), [[Chebyshev]] (1852), and [[Arndt]]\n(1853).\n\nGeneral criteria began with [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]] (1835), and have been\nstudied by [[Gotthold Eisenstein|Eisenstein]] (1847), [[Weierstrass]] in his various\ncontributions to the theory of functions, [[Ulisse Dini|Dini]] (1867),\nDuBois-Reymond (1873), and many others. Pringsheim's memoirs (1889) present the most complete general theory.\n\n===Uniform convergence===\nThe theory of [[uniform convergence]] was treated by Cauchy (1821), his\nlimitations being pointed out by Abel, but the first to attack it\nsuccessfully were [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel|Seidel]] and [[George Gabriel Stokes|Stokes]] (1847\u201348). Cauchy took up the\nproblem again (1853), acknowledging Abel's criticism, and reaching\nthe same conclusions which Stokes had already found. Thomae used the\ndoctrine (1866), but there was great delay in recognizing the\nimportance of distinguishing between uniform and non-uniform\nconvergence, in spite of the demands of the theory of functions.\n\n===Semi-convergence===\nA series is said to be semi-convergent (or conditionally convergent) if it is convergent but not [[absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]].\n\nSemi-convergent series were studied by Poisson (1823), who also gave a general form for the remainder of the Maclaurin formula. The most important solution of the problem is due, however, to Jacobi (1834),\nwho attacked the question of the remainder from a different standpoint and reached a different formula. This expression was also worked out, and another one given, by [[Carl Johan Malmsten|Malmsten]] (1847).  [[Schl\u00f6milch]] (''Zeitschrift'', Vol.I, p.&nbsp;192, 1856) also improved Jacobi's remainder, and showed the relation between the remainder and [[Faulhaber's formula|Bernoulli's function]]\n\n:<math>F(x) = 1^n + 2^n + \\cdots + (x - 1)^n.</math>\n\n[[Angelo Genocchi|Genocchi]] (1852) has further contributed to the theory.\n\nAmong the early writers was [[Josef Hoene-Wronski|Wronski]], whose \"loi supr\u00eame\" (1815) was hardly recognized until [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] (1873) brought it into\nprominence.\n\n===Fourier series===\n[[Fourier series]] were being investigated\nas the result of physical considerations at the same time that\nGauss, Abel, and Cauchy were working out the theory of infinite\nseries. Series for the expansion of sines and cosines, of multiple\narcs in powers of the sine and cosine of the arc had been treated by\n[[Jacob Bernoulli]] (1702) and his brother [[Johann Bernoulli]] (1701) and still\nearlier by [[Franciscus Vieta|Vieta]]. Euler and [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] simplified the subject,\nas did [[Louis Poinsot|Poinsot]], [[Karl Schr\u00f6ter|Schr\u00f6ter]], [[James Whitbread Lee Glaisher|Glaisher]], and [[Ernst Kummer|Kummer]].\n\nFourier (1807) set for himself a different problem, to\nexpand a given function of ''x'' in terms of the sines or cosines of\nmultiples of ''x'', a problem which he embodied in his ''[[Th\u00e9orie analytique de la chaleur]]'' (1822). Euler had already given the\nformulas for determining the coefficients in the series;\nFourier was the first to assert and attempt to prove the general\ntheorem. [[Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson|Poisson]] (1820\u201323) also attacked the problem from a\ndifferent standpoint. Fourier did not, however, settle the question\nof convergence of his series, a matter left for [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] (1826) to\nattempt and for Dirichlet (1829) to handle in a thoroughly\nscientific manner (see [[convergence of Fourier series]]). Dirichlet's treatment (''[[Journal f\u00fcr die reine und angewandte Mathematik|Crelle]]'', 1829), of trigonometric series was the subject of criticism and improvement by\nRiemann (1854), Heine, [[Rudolf Lipschitz|Lipschitz]], [[Ludwig Schl\u00e4fli|Schl\u00e4fli]], and\n[[Paul du Bois-Reymond|du Bois-Reymond]]. Among other prominent contributors to the theory of\ntrigonometric and Fourier series were [[Ulisse Dini|Dini]], [[Charles Hermite|Hermite]], [[Georges Henri Halphen|Halphen]],\nKrause, Byerly and [[Paul \u00c9mile Appell|Appell]].\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Asymptotic series===\n[[Asymptotic series]], otherwise [[asymptotic expansion]]s, are infinite series whose partial sums become good approximations in the limit of some point of the domain.  In general they do not converge, but they are useful as sequences of approximations, each of which provides a value close to the desired answer for a finite number of terms. The difference is that an asymptotic series cannot be made to produce an answer as exact as desired, the way that convergent series can. In fact, after a certain number of terms, a typical asymptotic series reaches its best approximation; if more terms are included, most such series will produce worse answers.\n\n===Divergent series===\n{{Main|Divergent series}}\nUnder many circumstances, it is desirable to assign a limit to a series which fails to converge in the usual sense.  A [[summability method]] is such an assignment of a limit to a subset of the set of divergent series which properly extends the classical notion of convergence.  Summability methods include [[Ces\u00e0ro summation]], (''C'',''k'') summation, [[Abel summation]], and [[Borel summation]], in increasing order of generality (and hence applicable to increasingly divergent series).\n\nA variety of general results concerning possible summability methods are known.  The [[Silverman\u2013Toeplitz theorem]] characterizes ''matrix summability methods'', which are methods for summing a divergent series by applying an infinite matrix to the vector of coefficients.  The most general method for summing a divergent series is non-constructive, and concerns [[Banach limit]]s.\n\n===Series in topological vector spaces===\nIf ''X'' is a [[Topological Vector Space]] (TVS) and <math>\\left( x_{\\alpha} \\right)_{\\alpha \\in A}</math> is a (possibly [[uncountable]]) family in ''X'' then this family is '''summable'''{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=179-180}} if the limit <math>\\lim_{H \\in \\mathcal{F}(A)} x_{H}</math> of the [[Net (mathematics)|net]] <math>\\left( x_H \\right)_{H \\in \\mathcal{F}(A)}</math> converges in ''X'', where <math>\\mathcal{F}(A)</math> is the [[directed set]] of all finite subsets of ''A'' directed by inclusion <math>\\subseteq</math> and <math>x_H := \\sum_{i \\in H} x_i</math>. \n\nIt is called '''[[absolutely summable]]''' if in addition, for every continuous seminorm ''p'' on ''X'', the family <math>\\left( p \\left( x_{\\alpha} \\right) \\right)_{\\alpha \\in A}</math> is summable.\nIf ''X'' is a normable space and if <math>\\left( x_{\\alpha} \\right)_{\\alpha \\in A}</math> is an absolutely summable family in ''X'', then necessarily all but a countable collection of <math>x_{\\alpha}</math>'s are 0. Hence, in normed spaces, it is usually only ever necessary to consider series with countably many terms. \n\nSummable families play an important role in the theory of [[nuclear space]]s.\n\n====Series in Banach spaces====\nThe notion of series can be easily extended to the case of a [[Banach space]].  If ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> is a sequence of elements of a Banach space ''X'', then the series \u03a3''x''<sub>''n''</sub> converges to ''x''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''X'' if the sequence of partial sums of the series tends to ''x''; to wit,\n:<math>\\biggl\\|x - \\sum_{n=0}^N x_n\\biggr\\|\\to 0</math>\nas ''N''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e.\n\nMore generally, convergence of series can be defined in any [[abelian group|abelian]] [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] [[topological group]].  Specifically, in this case, \u03a3''x''<sub>''n''</sub> converges to ''x'' if the sequence of partial sums converges to ''x''.\n\n===Summations over arbitrary index sets===\nDefinitions may be given for sums over an arbitrary index set {{math|''I''}}.<ref>{{citation|author=Jean Dieudonn\u00e9|title=Foundations of mathematical analysis|publisher=Academic Press}}</ref>  There are two main differences with the usual notion of series: first, there is no specific order given on the set {{math|''I''}}; second, this set {{math|''I''}} may be uncountable.  The notion of convergence needs to be strengthened, because the concept of [[conditional convergence]] depends on the ordering of the index set.\n\nIf <math>a:I \\mapsto G</math> is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] from an [[index set]] {{math|''I''}} to a set {{math|''G''}}, then the \"series\" associated to <math>a</math> is the [[formal sum]] of the elements <math>a(x) \\in G </math> over the index elements <math>x \\in I</math> denoted by the\n:<math>\\sum_{x \\in I} a(x).</math>\n\nWhen the index set is the natural numbers <math>I=\\mathbb{N}</math>, the function <math>a:\\mathbb{N} \\mapsto G</math> is a [[sequence]] denoted by <math>a(n)=a_n</math>. A series indexed on the natural numbers is an ordered formal sum and so we rewrite <math>\\sum_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}</math> as <math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty}</math> in order to emphasize the ordering induced by the natural numbers. Thus, we obtain the common notation for a series indexed by the natural numbers\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots.</math>\n\n====Families of non-negative numbers====\nWhen summing a family {''a''<sub>''i''</sub>}, ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', of non-negative numbers, one may define\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\in I}a_i = \\sup \\Bigl\\{ \\sum_{i\\in A}a_i\\,\\big| A \\text{ finite, } A \\subset I\\Bigr\\} \\in [0, +\\infty].</math>\n\nWhen the supremum is finite, the set of ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'' such that ''a<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;> 0 is countable.

It follows that the finite partial sums of an unconditionally summable family ''a<sub>i</sub>'', ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', form a ''Cauchy net'', that is, for every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''<sub>0</sub> of ''I''&thinsp; such that\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in A_1} a_i - \\sum_{i \\in A_2} a_i \\in W, \\quad A_1, A_2 \\supset A_0.</math>\n\nWhen ''X''&thinsp; is [[Complete metric space|complete]], a family ''a'' is unconditionally summable in ''X''&thinsp; if and only if the finite sums satisfy the latter Cauchy net condition. When ''X''&thinsp; is complete and ''a<sub>i</sub>'', ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I'', is unconditionally summable in ''X'', then for every subset ''J''&nbsp;\u2282 ''I'', the corresponding subfamily ''a<sub>j</sub>'', ''j''&nbsp;\u2208 ''J'', is also unconditionally summable in ''X''.\n\nWhen the sum of a family of non-negative numbers, in the extended sense defined before, is finite, then it coincides with the sum in the topological group ''X''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''R'''.\n\nIf a family ''a'' in ''X''&thinsp; is unconditionally summable, then for every ''W'', neighborhood of 0 in ''X'', there is a finite subset ''A''<sub>0</sub> of ''I''&thinsp; such that ''a''<sub>''i''</sub>&nbsp;\u2208 ''W''&thinsp; for every ''i'' not in ''A''<sub>0</sub>.  If ''X''&thinsp; is [[first-countable space|first-countable]], it follows that the set of ''i''&nbsp;\u2208 ''I''&thinsp; such that ''a<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;\u2260 0 is countable.  This need not be true in a general abelian topological group (see examples below).\n\n====Unconditionally convergent series====\nSuppose that ''I''&nbsp;= '''N'''.  If a family ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>, ''n''&nbsp;\u2208 '''N''', is unconditionally summable in an abelian Hausdorff topological group ''X'', then the series in the usual sense converges and has the same sum,\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n = \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbf{N}} a_n.</math>\n\nBy nature, the definition of unconditional summability is insensitive to the order of the summation.  When \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> is unconditionally summable, then the series remains convergent after any permutation ''\u03c3'' of the set '''N''' of indices, with the same sum,\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_{\\sigma(n)} = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n.</math>\n\nConversely, if every permutation of a series \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> converges, then the series is unconditionally convergent.  When ''X''&thinsp; is complete, then unconditional convergence is also equivalent to the fact that all subseries are convergent; if ''X''&thinsp; is a Banach space, this is equivalent to say that for every sequence of signs ''\u03b5''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;= \u00b11<!-- this is not about convergence of functions, even less about uniform convergence. -->, the series\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\varepsilon_n a_n</math>\n\nconverges in ''X''.  If ''X''&thinsp; is a Banach space, then one may define the notion of absolute convergence.  A series \u2211''a''<sub>''n''</sub> of vectors in ''X''&thinsp; converges absolutely if\n\n:<math> \\sum_{n \\in \\mathbf{N}} \\|a_n\\| < +\\infty.</math>\n\nIf a series of vectors in a Banach space converges absolutely then it converges unconditionally, but the converse only holds in finite-dimensional Banach spaces (theorem of {{harvtxt|Dvoretzky|Rogers|1950}}).\n\n====Well-ordered sums====\nConditionally convergent series can be considered if ''I'' is a [[well-ordered]] set, for example, an [[ordinal number]] ''\u03b1''<sub>0</sub>.  One may define by [[transfinite recursion]]:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha + 1} a_\\beta = a_{\\alpha} + \\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha} a_\\beta</math>\n\nand for a limit ordinal ''\u03b1'',\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\beta < \\alpha} a_\\beta = \\lim_{\\gamma\\to\\alpha} \\sum_{\\beta < \\gamma} a_\\beta</math>\n\nif this limit exists.  If all limits exist up to ''\u03b1''<sub>0</sub>, then the series converges.\n\n====Examples====\n\n{{ordered list\n|1= Given a function ''f''&nbsp;: ''X''\u2192''Y'', with ''Y'' an abelian topological group, define for every ''a''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''X''\n\n:<math>f_a(x)=\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & x\\neq a, \\\\\nf(a) & x=a, \\\\\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\na function whose [[support (mathematics)|support]] is a [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] {''a''}.  Then\n\n:<math>f=\\sum_{a \\in X}f_a</math>\n\nin the [[topology of pointwise convergence]] (that is, the sum is taken in the infinite product group ''Y''<sup>''X''&nbsp;</sup>).\n\n|2= In the definition of [[partitions of unity]], one constructs sums of functions over arbitrary index set ''I'',\n\n:<math> \\sum_{i \\in I} \\varphi_i(x) = 1.</math>\n\nWhile, formally, this requires a notion of sums of uncountable series, by construction there are, for every given ''x'', only finitely many nonzero terms in the sum, so issues regarding convergence of such sums do not arise.  Actually, one usually assumes more: the family of functions is ''locally finite'', that is, for every ''x'' there is a neighborhood of ''x'' in which all but a finite number of functions vanish.  Any regularity property of the ''\u03c6<sub>i</sub>'',&thinsp; such as continuity, differentiability, that is preserved under finite sums will be preserved for the sum of any subcollection of this family of functions.\n\n|3= On the [[first uncountable ordinal]] \u03c9<sub>1</sub> viewed as a topological space in the [[order topology]], the constant function ''f'': [0,\u03c9<sub>1</sub>) \u2192 [0,\u03c9<sub>1</sub>] given by ''f''(\u03b1) = 1 satisfies\n\n:<math>\\sum_{\\alpha\\in[0,\\omega_1)}f(\\alpha) = \\omega_1</math>\n\n(in other words, \u03c9<sub>1</sub> copies of 1 is \u03c9<sub>1</sub>) only if one takes a limit over all ''countable'' partial sums, rather than finite partial sums.

{"title_page": "List of Ontario by-elections", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThe '''list of Ontario by-elections''' includes every [[by-election]] held in the [[provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Ontario]]. By-elections occur whenever there is a vacancy in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Legislative Assembly]], although an imminent [[general election]] may allow the vacancy to remain until the [[dissolution of parliament]].\n\n==Causes==\nA by-election occurs whenever there is a vacancy in the Ontario legislature. Vacancies can occur for the following reasons:\n\n* Death of a member.\n* Resignation of a member.\n* Voided results\n* Expulsion from the legislature.\n* Ineligibility to sit.\n\nWhen there is a vacancy, a by-election must be called within six months. Under amendments to the Election Act approved in 2016, a by-election is no longer required when a vacancy occurs in the 12 months leading up to a [[Fixed-term election|fixed general election date]].\n\n==Ministerial by-elections==\nThe list includes [[ministerial by-election]]s which occurred due to the requirement that incumbent members recontest their seats upon being appointed to [[Executive Council of Ontario|Cabinet]]. These [[by-election]]s were almost always uncontested. This requirement was amended in 1926 to exempt ministers appointed within three months after a general election. In 1941 it was abolished \ncompletely.\n\n\n==42nd Legislative Assembly of Ontario 2018-present==\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"width:100%\"\n!By-election !! Date !! Incumbent !! colspan=2 | Party !!

By-elections occur whenever there is a vacancy in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Legislative Assembly]], although an imminent [[general election]] may allow the vacancy to remain until the [[dissolution of parliament]].\n\n==Causes==\nA by-election occurs whenever there is a vacancy in the Ontario legislature. Vacancies can occur for the following reasons:\n\n* Death of a member.\n* Resignation of a member.\n* Voided results\n* Expulsion from the legislature.\n* Ineligibility to sit.\n\nWhen there is a vacancy, a by-election must be called within six months. Under amendments to the Election Act approved in 2016, a by-election is no longer required when a vacancy occurs in the 12 months leading up to a [[Fixed-term election|fixed general election date]].\n\n==Ministerial by-elections==\nThe list includes [[ministerial by-election]]s which occurred due to the requirement that incumbent members recontest their seats upon being appointed to [[Executive Council of Ontario|Cabinet]]. These [[by-election]]s were almost always uncontested. This requirement was amended in 1926 to exempt ministers appointed within three months after a general election. In 1941 it was abolished \ncompletely.\n\n\n==42nd Legislative Assembly of Ontario 2018-present==\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"width:100%\"\n!By-election !! Date !! Incumbent !! colspan=2 | Party !!
