This demerit system is mediated by a \"demerit card\" that all students must have on them during school hours.  Each semester, students are issued a demerit card with spaces for 40 demerits.

Students may choose to opt-out of this punishment once per semester if they choose to instead take a \"work Jug\", which entails providing an adequate service alternative by aiding staff and teachers.  Repeat or serious offenses will result in a \"Saturday Jug\", a 4-hour detention during the weekend issue by the Dean of Students.  On average, students receive approximately 5 demerits, or one Jug, per semester.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.creightonprep.creighton.edu/page.cfm?p=5130|title=Creighton Prep: FAQs for Parents|website=creightonprep.creighton.edu|access-date=2019-03-13}}</ref> In the event of a student missing a morning Jug or not completing their homework prior to the class, the student is the assigned to attend \"Laughlin Hour\" (formally referred to as \"Ninth Hour\").

Therefore, the program Peer Tutoring is designed to serve an intervention role in improving grades prior to considering expulsion or further disciplinary action.   Freshmen and Sophomores who do not meet the requirements must attend six-hour-long, after-school sessions during a period of three weeks where they receive academic help from student volunteers.  After the initial three weeks have ended, the student's grades will be reviewed, if the student is still failing two or more classes then they will be assigned an additional three weeks.  Failure to attend this program will result in a Saturday Jug.<ref name=\":9\" /> If a student does not meet this satisfactory standard by the end of the semester, they will be placed into academic probation for the following semester or could be potentially dismissed depending on the severity of their performance.

This demerit system is mediated by a \"demerit card\" that all students must have on them during school hours.  Each semester, students are issued a demerit card with spaces for 40 demerits.  At 5 demerit intervals, a student will receive a detention, referred to as a \"Jug\" (standing for Justice Under God).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.omaha.com/news/kelly-creighton-prep-losing-a-living-saint/article_6b1b8769-4bc6-5f62-bbb2-7ff4188696c0.html|title=Kelly: Creighton Prep losing a 'living saint'|last=columnist|first=Michael Kelly / World-Herald|website=Omaha.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> This is not without exception as some major offenses will circumvent this demerit system and instead impose the Jug as punishment.<ref>{{Citation|title=JUG at Creighton Prep (HD)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLa6MZF3vpQ|language=en|access-date=2019-10-07}}</ref>  These Jugs are mandatory as they must be served the following morning prior to school, or postponed to a later date depending on circumstances.  Students may choose to opt-out of this punishment once per semester if they choose to instead take a \"work Jug\", which entails providing an adequate service alternative by aiding staff and teachers.  Repeat or serious offenses will result in a \"Saturday Jug\", a 4-hour detention during the weekend issue by the Dean of Students.  On average, students receive approximately 5 demerits, or one Jug, per semester.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.creightonprep.creighton.edu/page.cfm?p=5130|title=Creighton Prep: FAQs for Parents|website=creightonprep.creighton.edu|access-date=2019-03-13}}</ref> In the event of a student missing a morning Jug or not completing their homework prior to the class, the student is the assigned to attend \"Laughlin Hour\" (formally referred to as \"Ninth Hour\").

The film project involved work in conjunction with Creighton Prep's Fine Arts Department, who's film department was given opportunity to share projects and ideas with Payne.  Furthermore, Damon and Payne both autographed a golf flag that would eventually be auctioned off at Prep's annual BASH fundraiser on April 23.  Coincidentally, Prep students had already begun a campaign to raising money for Damon's charity, [[Water.org]], prior to being informed that the film would be taking place.  Due to the dynamic that developed better the student body and [[Matt Damon]], Rev. Tom Neitzke, president of Creighton Prep, jokingly declared Matt Damon an honorary alum of Creighton Prep.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Omaha Film Festival ===\nIn 2016, students Brendan Doyle and Hunter Parry co-directed the short film \"T for Tyranny\".

This issue has been criticized by Creighton Prep staff but spokespersons for the school stated each chant must be judged on a case by case policy, as there is no administrative standard to judge these chants. This issue was stated to be a result of the bylaws of the [[Nebraska School Activities Association]], which state \"member schools are charged with maintaining proper crowd control and enforcing principles of good sportsmanship and ethics at all interscholastic contests\". Therefore, individual schools have are responsible for maintaining these standards but \"what\u2019s appropriate is up to the schools\" (Jim Tenopir).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.omaha.com/news/education/are-students-going-too-far-in-the-way-they-boo/article_1c9bd474-7d09-52c4-a771-dde842f1f8f8.html|title=Are students going too far in the way they boo?

This included accounts of physical violence against him due to his sexuality, and affirming that the culture against those who are gay is still present. This further included descriptions of how Creighton Prep's dominate culture surround gay identities is that it was viewed as \"sick, sinful and unacceptable in the eyes of the world.\" This ended with Glenn describing that Prep needed a paradigm shift in their culture as the status quo has conveyed the message of gay students being seen as \"damaged goods\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/issue/313/faith-focus/god-intended|title=As God Intended|date=2001-05-21|website=America Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, President of Creighton Prep, Reverend Robert Hotz resigned following an incident where he invited an openly gay alumni to speak on his experiences pertaining both religion, service, and homosexuality.

She was classically trained attending both the [[Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet|Leningrad State Choreographic Institute]] and [[Moscow State Academy of Choreography|Moscow Choreographic School]]. She performed in Russia until her marriage in the early 1930s to a Japanese diplomat. After agreeing to move to Japan in 1936, she developed classical ballet in the country, bringing with her the theoretical and pedagogical materials to underpin her dance lessons and establish the field.\n\nFrom 1936 to her retirement in 1957, Sapphire was employed by the Nihon Gekij\u014d variety theater, serving as its [[prima ballerina]], choreographer and ballet instructor. She performed classic Russian ballets producing all aspects of the productions, as well as choreographing Japanese dances for stage and film. She retired from the stage in 1953, but continued to be influential in ballet until 1957. In 1960, her husband was assigned to a post in Poland and she lived there for three years. In her later years, Sapphire wrote three books about ballet, which remain influential in Japan.\n\n==Early life and training==\nOlga Ivanova Pavlova was born on 28 June 1907 in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia to Juliana Kuzminichna Kuzmina and Gustav Yanovich Grudberg. Her parents had a [[common-law marriage]], as they were unable to marry since Grudberg was not a member of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. He was a locksmith, originally from [[Riga]] and her mother was originally from [[Pskov]], near the [[Estonia]]n border. When their first child, Ekaterina was born, she was baptized with the surname Pavlova, a family name of her great-uncle. When Olga was born, she was given the same surname.{{sfn|\u041a\u0430\u0434\u0437\u0438|\u0428\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0430|2019|p=253}} The era of her birth was a turbulent time, as the [[1905 Russian Revolution]] had begun two years prior to her birth, [[World War I]] would follow when she was seven years old, and the [[Russian Revolution|1917 Revolution]] began when she was ten.{{sfn|Ascher|1994|p=93}}{{sfn|Sato|1996|p=22}} She later wrote of her childhood that it was a time of cold and hunger.{{sfn|Sato|1996|p=22}}\n\nFrom an early age, Pavlova was taken with ballet, but given their circumstances life as an artist was improbable. When World War I broke out, her mother began working in the store of the [[People's House]], the center of the cultural scene in Saint Petersburg. Against her husband's wishes, Kuzmina encouraged her daughter and at age 12, Pavlova entered the free school located at #3 Gagarinskaya Street.{{sfn|\u041a\u0430\u0434\u0437\u0438|\u0428\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0430|2019|p=253}} The school was run by Baron Yuri Nikolaevich Miklos, who had opened it as a philanthropic effort to develop dance. He hired noted instructors to teach classical ballet, as well as [[ballroom dancing|ballroom]] and [[character dancing]], and students received 4 years of lectures before their final examinations.{{sfn|\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0430|1995|pp=2\u20133}} Pavlova studied under Apollinaria Gordova and was classmates with [[Igor Shvetsov]].{{sfn|\u041a\u0430\u0434\u0437\u0438|\u0428\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0430|2019|p=253}} In 1922, when authorities closed the Miklos school,{{sfn|\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0430|1995|p=3}} she transferred to the school operated by [[Akim Volynsky]] and studied theory, taking evening dance courses at the [[Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet|Leningrad State Choreographic Institute]].{{sfn|\u041a\u0430\u0434\u0437\u0438|\u0428\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0430|2019|p=253}} The [[Stalinism|Stalinist period]] was difficult as classical ballets were being replaced with ideological themes and ballet masters were relocating to the west.{{sfn|Sato|1996|p=22}}  At her 1928 graduation, Pavlova performed as a soloist in fragments choreographed by [[Marius Petipa]] from ''[[La vestale (Spontini)|La vestale]]'' by [[Gaspare Spontini]].{{sfn|\u041a\u0430\u0434\u0437\u0438|\u0428\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0430|2019|p=253}}\n\n==Career==\n===In Russia (1928\u20131935)===\nPavlova danced with [[Vakhtang Chabukiani]] and {{ill|Sergey Gavrilovich Koren|ru|\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u044c, \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u0413\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} in scenes of the ballet ''The Masque of the Red Death'' ({{lang-ru|\u041c\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0421\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0438}}) by [[Nikolai Tcherepnin]], on 10 November 1928.

After the war, Kobayashi faced reprisals for his war activities, and Sapphire lost her primary backer.

ballerina and choreographer '''Olga Ivanovna Pavlova''' ({{lang-ru|\u041e\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0430 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u041f\u0430\u0432\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430}}), whose married name was '''Midori Shimizu''' ({{lang-ja|\u6e05\u6c34\u307f\u3069\u308a}}). She was classically trained attending both the [[Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet|Leningrad State Choreographic Institute]] and [[Moscow State Academy of Choreography|Moscow Choreographic School]]. She performed in Russia until her marriage in the early 1930s to a Japanese diplomat. After agreeing to move to Japan in 1936, she developed classical ballet in the country, bringing with her the theoretical and pedagogical materials to underpin her dance lessons and establish the field.\n\nFrom 1936 to her retirement in 1957, Sapphire was employed by the Nihon Gekij\u014d variety theater, serving as its [[prima ballerina]], choreographer and ballet instructor. She performed classic Russian ballets producing all aspects of the productions, as well as choreographing Japanese dances for stage and film. She retired from the stage in 1953, but continued to be influential in ballet until 1957. In 1960, her husband was assigned to a post in Poland and she lived there for three years. In her later years, Sapphire wrote three books about ballet, which remain influential in Japan.\n\n==Early life and training==\nOlga Ivanova Pavlova was born on 28 June 1907 in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia to Juliana Kuzminichna Kuzmina and Gustav Yanovich Grudberg. Her parents had a [[common-law marriage]], as they were unable to marry since Grudberg was not a member of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. He was a locksmith, originally from [[Riga]] and her mother was originally from [[Pskov]], near the [[Estonia]]n border. When their first child, Ekaterina was born, she was baptized with the surname Pavlova, a family name of her great-uncle. When Olga was born, she was given the same surname.{{sfn|\u041a\u0430\u0434\u0437\u0438|\u0428\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0430|2019|p=253}} The era of her birth was a turbulent time, as the [[1905 Russian Revolution]] had begun two years prior to her birth, [[World War I]] would follow when she was seven years old, and the [[Russian Revolution|1917 Revolution]] began when she was ten.{{sfn|Ascher|1994|p=93}}{{sfn|Sato|1996|p=22}} She later wrote of her childhood that it was a time of cold and hunger.{{sfn|Sato|1996|p=22}}\n\nFrom an early age, Pavlova was taken with ballet, but given their circumstances life as an artist was improbable. When World War I broke out, her mother began working in the store of the [[People's House]], the center of the cultural scene in Saint Petersburg. Against her husband's wishes, Kuzmina encouraged her daughter and at age 12, Pavlova entered the free school located at #3 Gagarinskaya Street.{{sfn|\u041a\u0430\u0434\u0437\u0438|\u0428\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0430|2019|p=253}} The school was run by Baron Yuri Nikolaevich Miklos, who had opened it as a philanthropic effort to develop dance. He hired noted instructors to teach classical ballet, as well as [[ballroom dancing|ballroom]] and [[character dancing]], and students received 4 years of lectures before their final examinations.{{sfn|\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0430|1995|pp=2\u20133}} Pavlova studied under Apollinaria Gordova and was classmates with [[Igor Shvetsov]].{{sfn|\u041a\u0430\u0434\u0437\u0438|\u0428\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0430|2019|p=253}} In 1922, when authorities closed the Miklos school,{{sfn|\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0443\u0445\u043e\u0432\u0430|1995|p=3}} she transferred to the school operated by [[Akim Volynsky]] and studied theory, taking evening dance courses at the [[Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet|Leningrad State Choreographic Institute]].{{sfn|\u041a\u0430\u0434\u0437\u0438|\u0428\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0430|2019|p=253}} The [[Stalinism|Stalinist period]] was difficult as classical ballets were being replaced with ideological themes and ballet masters were relocating to the west.{{sfn|Sato|1996|p=22}}  At her 1928 graduation, Pavlova performed as a soloist in fragments choreographed by [[Marius Petipa]] from ''[[La vestale (Spontini)|La vestale]]'' by [[Gaspare Spontini]].{{sfn|\u041a\u0430\u0434\u0437\u0438|\u0428\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0430|2019|p=253}}\n\n==Career==\n===In Russia (1928\u20131935)===\nPavlova danced with [[Vakhtang Chabukiani]] and {{ill|Sergey Gavrilovich Koren|ru|\u041a\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u044c, \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0433\u0435\u0439 \u0413\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447}} in scenes of the ballet ''The Masque of the Red Death'' ({{lang-ru|\u041c\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0421\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0438}}) by [[Nikolai Tcherepnin]], on 10 November 1928.

Presbyterian denominations tracing their history to the Covenanters and often incorporating the name continue the ideas and traditions in [[Scotland]] and internationally.\n\nThey derived their name from the word ''[[Covenant (law)|covenant]]'' meaning a bond, legal document or agreement, with particular reference to the [[Covenant (biblical)|Covenant]] between God and the Israelites in the Old Testament.{{efn|In the summer of 1643, the Scottish parliament and General Assembly of the Church entered into negotiations for an alliance with the English Parliament. Historians have concentrated on the clauses of the Solemn League and Covenant, the treaty which resulted from those deliberations.\n<ref>{{harvnb|Furgol|1983|p=20.}}</ref>}} {{efn|\"Following the outbreak of the Civil War in England, in 1642, a committee of noblemen and clergy from both Scotland and England composed a document entitled the 'Solemn League and Covenant'. It was signed between September and October, in both countries, and later in the same year, in Ireland. This committed the Scots to supply an army to aid the Parliamentarian Par against the Royalists in the Civil War. As in the National Covenant, the signatories pledged to 'amend our lives, and each one to go before another in the example of a real Reformation'. As with the National Covenant they entered into a mutual contract with God where the signatory promised to reform his or her person, in this case, not only for the upholding of 'the Religion', but that 'the Lord may tu away his wrath, and heavy indignation'\". (All quotations are from 'The Solemn League and Covenant', reprinted in SB, ILL, pp.122-5). The success of the Scottish National Covenant was thought by many sectarians and clergy alike to have been the direct result of the process of mutual bonding between the nation and God. Thus, at a time of rising religious schism, a threatened invasion of Irish Catholics and Royalist-Parliamentarian hostilities, the English Parliamentarians bound themselves to the same course that had appeared to guarantee the Scots 'virtually unmitigated success' (Edward J. Cowan, 'The Making of the National Covenant', in John Morrell, ed. (1988), p.75).\n<ref>{{harvnb|Currie|2009|pp=17\u201319}}</ref>}}\n\n==Beginnings==\nThe Covenanters are so named for the series of bonds or covenants by which the adherents bound themselves to maintain the Presbyterian doctrine and polity as the sole form of religion of their country. The first \"godly bond\" of the [[Lords of the Congregation]] and their followers is dated December 1557; but more important is the [[s:National Covenant of the Church of Scotland|National Covenant of the Church of Scotland]] (1581), drawn up by [[John Craig (minister)|John Craig]] in consequence of the strenuous efforts [[Roman Catholic]]s were making to regain their hold upon Scotland, and called the King's Confession or Negative Confession.  Based on the [[Scots Confession|Scots Confession of Faith of 1560]], this document denounced the [[Pope]] and the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church in no measured terms. It was adopted by the General Assembly of the [[Church of Scotland]], signed by King [[James I of England|James VI]] and his household, and enjoined on persons of all ranks and classes, and was subscribed to again in 1590 and 1596.<ref name=MacPherson >MacPherson.</ref>\n\n==Upheaval and the Wars of the Three Kingdoms==\n{{refimprove|section|date=February 2020}}\nIn 1637, Scotland was in a state of turmoil. [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] and [[William Laud]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], met with a reverse in their efforts to impose a new liturgy on the Scots. The new liturgy had been devised by a panel of Scottish bishops, including [[John Spottiswoode|Archbishop Spottiswoode]] of St. Andrews, but a riot against its use was orchestrated in [[St Giles' Cathedral]], Edinburgh, ostensibly started by [[Jenny Geddes]]. Fearing further measures on the part of the king, it occurred to [[Archibald Johnston]] (Lord Warriston) to revive the Negative Confession of 1581 in a form suited to the times. Together with the cooperation of [[Alexander Henderson (theologian)|Alexander Henderson]], this National Covenant (as it was called) was finalized in early 1638.\n\n[[File:Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] where the National Covenant was signed in 1638]]\n[[File:The Signing of the National Covenant in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Signing of the National Covenant in Greyfriars Kirkyard, by [[William Allan (painter)|William Allan]] ]]\n[[File:The National Covenant of 1638.JPG|thumb|left|160px|Edinburgh's copy of the National Covenant]]\n\nAdditional matter intended to suit the document to the special circumstances of the time was added, primarily a recital of the acts of parliament against \"superstitious and papistical rites\" and an elaborate oath to maintain the reformed religion. The Covenant was adopted and signed by a large gathering in the [[Greyfriars Kirkyard|kirkyard]] of [[Greyfriars Kirk]] in [[Edinburgh]], on 28 February 1638, after which copies were sent throughout the country for signing. The subscribers engaged by oath to maintain religion in the form that it existed in 1580, and to reject all innovations introduced since that time, while also professing loyalty to the king. It did not specifically reject episcopacy but in effect undermined it. Further subscriptions and swearing ceremonies took place across Scotland, emotionally charged events evoking mass crying and yelling.<ref>Mullan, pp. 288\u2013289.</ref> The year 1638 marked an apex of events for the Covenanters, for it was the time of broad confrontations with the established church supported by the monarchy. Confrontations occurred in several parts of Scotland, such as the one with the [[Bishops of Aberdeen]] by a high level assembly of Covenanters staging their operations from [[Muchalls Castle]]. The General Assembly of 1638 was composed of ardent Covenanters, and in 1640 the Covenant was adopted by the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish parliament]], its subscription being made a requirement for all citizens. Before this date, the Covenanters were usually referred to as Supplicants, but from about this time the former designation began to prevail. The Covenanters raised an army to resist Charles I's religious reforms, and defeated him in the [[Bishops' Wars]]. The crisis that this caused to the Stuart monarchy helped bring about the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], which included the [[English Civil War]], the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Scottish Civil War]] and [[Irish Confederate Wars]].\n\nFor the following ten years of civil war in Britain, the Covenanters were the ''[[de facto]]'' government of Scotland. In 1642, they sent an army to [[Ulster]] in Ireland to protect the Scottish settlers there from the Irish Catholic rebels who had attacked them in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. The Scottish army remained in Ireland until the end of the civil wars, but was confined to its garrison around [[Carrickfergus]] after its defeat at the [[Battle of Benburb]] in 1646.\n\n[[File:The Solemn League And Covenant.jpg|thumb|The Solemn League And Covenant, as publicised in England]]\n{{wikisource|Solemn League and Covenant}}\nA further Covenanter military intervention began in 1643. The leaders of the English Parliament, worsted in the English Civil War, implored the aid of the Scots, which was promised on condition that the Scottish system of church government would be adopted in England. Following considerable debate, a document called the [[Solemn League and Covenant]] was drawn up. This was in effect a treaty between England and Scotland which called for the preservation of the reformed religion in Scotland and the reformation of religion in England and Ireland \"according to the word of God and the example of the best reformed churches\", and the extirpation of [[popery]] and [[prelacy]]. It did not explicitly mention [[Presbyterianism]] and included some ambiguous formulations that left the door open to Independency. It was subscribed to by many in both kingdoms and also in Ireland. It was approved by the English Parliament. With some slight modifications it was approved by the [[Westminster Assembly of Divines]]. This agreement meant that the Covenanters sent another army south to England to fight on the Parliamentarian side in the [[First English Civil War]]. The Scottish armies in England were instrumental in bringing about the victory of the English Parliament over the king.<ref name=MacPherson/>\n\nIn turn, this sparked the outbreak of civil war in Scotland in 1644\u201347, as Scottish [[Cavalier|Royalist]] opponents of the Covenanters took up arms against them. Royalism was most common among Scottish Roman Catholics and [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalians]], who were opposed to the Covenanters' imposition of their religious settlement on the country.  The Covenanters' enemies, led by [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]] and aided by an Irish expeditionary force and Highland clans led by [[Alasdair Mac Colla]] won a series of victories over hastily raised Covenanter forces in 1644\u201345. However, the Scottish Royalists were ultimately defeated in September 1645, at the [[Battle of Philiphaugh]], near [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]]. The disaster at Philiphaugh was largely due to the Royalists' own disunity and the return of the main Covenanter armies from England. The civil war in Scotland was a bitter episode which exposed the religious divisions between Presbyterians, Episcopalians and Catholics, the political divisions between Royalists and Covenanters and the cultural divisions between the Highlands and Lowlands.\n\n[[File:Replica Covenanter flag, Royal Scottish Museum.jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Replica Covenanter flag, National Museum of Scotland]]\nThe end of the first civil wars in Scotland and England left the Covenanters hopeful that their Solemn League and Covenant would be implemented in the Three Kingdoms. However, Charles I refused to accept it when he surrendered himself to the Scots in 1646. He was taken to Newcastle, where several attempts were made to persuade him to take the Covenants.  When this failed, he was handed over to the commissioners of Parliament in early 1647. However, many Covenanters, led by [[James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton|James Hamilton]], were suspicious of their English allies' intentions and opened secret negotiations with Charles I. He made important concessions to them in the \"[[engagers|Engagement]]\" made with the Scots in December 1647. The Engagement was rejected by the militant Covenanters known as the [[Kirk Party]], who wanted the king to endorse their agenda explicitly before an alliance could be reached. A Scottish army invaded England in support of the Engagement, but was routed at the [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Battle of Preston]], leaving the Kirk Party in the ascendant in Scotland. The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]], which had been submitted for ratification in 1646, was in part adopted by act of the English Parliament in 1648 as the Articles of Christian Religion, while in Scotland it was approved with minor reservations in August 1647 and ratified by the Scottish Parliament in February 1649.\n\nThe Covenanters' insistence on dictating the future of both Scotland and England eventually led to all-out war with their erstwhile allies, the English Parliament, and to the Covenanters signing an alliance with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] known as the [[Treaty of Breda (1650)|Treaty of Breda]]. Charles II, before landing in Scotland in June 1650, declared by a solemn oath his approbation of both covenants, and this was renewed on the occasion of his coronation at Scone in the following January.\n\nHowever, the Covenanters were utterly defeated in 1650\u201352 by the forces of the English Parliament under [[Oliver Cromwell]]. Lowland Scotland was occupied by the [[New Model Army]] and the Covenanters were sidelined. From 1638 to 1651 the Covenanters, led by [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll]], had been the dominant party in Scotland, directing policy both at home and abroad. Their power had been seriously weakened, however, by Cromwell's victory at [[battle of Dunbar (1650)|Dunbar]] in September 1650 and was practically destroyed after the [[Battle of Worcester]] and the English occupation of Lowland Scotland. Under Cromwell's [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]], Scotland was forced into a temporary union with England and the General Assembly of the Kirk lost all civil power.\n\n==Restoration and \"The Killing Time\"==\n{{main|The Killing Time}}\n[[File:Murder scene, Archbishop Sharp Memorial, St. Andrews.JPG|thumb|The murder of Archbishop Sharp on his memorial at St. Andrews]]\n[[File:A Covenanters' Conventicle, from a children's history book.jpg|thumb|A conventicle in progress, from a children's history book published in 1906]]\n[[File:Covenanter Bible.jpg|thumb|A Covenanter's bible in the National Museum of Scotland]]\n[[File:Covenanters Prison, Greyfriars Kirkyard - geograph.org.uk - 1351472.jpg|thumb|Covenanters Prison, Greyfriars Kirkyard]]\n\nWorse was to come for the Covenanters when Charles II was [[Restoration (Scotland)|restored]] nine years later.  Firmly seated upon the throne, Charles renounced the covenants, which in 1662 were declared unlawful oaths to be abjured by all persons holding public offices. Argyll himself was executed for treason, [[episcopacy]] was restored, [[James Sharp (bishop)|James Sharp]] was appointed [[Archbishop of St Andrews]] and Primate of Scotland, the court of high commission was revived, and ministers who refused to recognize the authority of the bishops were expelled from their livings. Archbishop Sharp survived an assassination attempt in 1668 only to be killed by another group of Covenanters in 1679.\n\nFollowing the restoration of Episcopacy, rebel ministers began to preach at secret open-air meetings in the countryside known as \"[[conventicles]]\". A period of sustained persecution began. Oppressive measures against these illegal field assemblies where attendance was made a capital offence<ref name=Fifty >The Covenanters, The Fifty Years Struggle 1638-1688.</ref> led to an outbreak of armed rebellion in 1666, originating in Galloway. Advancing from the west towards Edinburgh, a small force of poorly armed Covenanters was defeated at the [[Battle of Rullion Green]] in the [[Pentland Hills]], a location which caused the whole tragic episode to be misleadingly named the Pentland Rising. To quell unrest in south-west Scotland, the government brought in 6,000 [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] soldiers, described by its enemies as an \"inhumane and barbarous Highland host\", which were quartered on suspected Covenanters and were accused of committing many atrocities.<ref name=Fifty/>\n\nA further rebellion broke out in 1679, after the unexpected success of a group of covenanters, armed with pitch forks and the like, against government forces led by [[John Graham of Claverhouse]] at the [[Battle of Drumclog]]. For a time the authorities looked in danger of losing control of the south west of Scotland, as more and more people joined the rebel camp at Bothwell near [[Glasgow]]; but only a few weeks after Drumclog the rebels were defeated at the [[Battle of Bothwell Brig]]. In the weeks before the battle the Covenanters spent more time arguing among themselves than preparing for the inevitable counterstroke, which did much to contribute towards their downfall. Of 1,200 captured rebels taken to Edinburgh, some 400 were imprisoned in an area of Greyfriars Kirkyard over the winter months.<ref name=Grey >Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh.</ref>\n\nInevitably, the government behaved harshly at first towards some of those caught in arms. On the initiative of [[James, Duke of Monmouth]], who led the king's army to victory at Bothwell Brig, a more conciliatory policy was followed for a time, though this met with limited success.\n\nThrough the period of repression the Covenanters held their convictions with a zeal that was only intensified by the persecution. For them it was a matter of belief. For the government, in contrast, the whole conventicle movement was seen as a problem of public order, which they attempted to deal with often using very inadequate resources. However, after the collapse of the 1679 rebellion a more dangerous element entered into the whole equation.  \n[[File:Condemned Covenanters on Their Way to Execution in the West Bow, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|A painting showing the last Covenanter martyr [[James Renwick (Covenanter)|James Renwick]] being taken to execution in 1688]]\n\nIn 1680 a more extreme mood appeared among sections of the Covenanter underground, which found expression in a document known as the ''[[Sanquhar Declaration]]''.  This was the manifesto of the followers of the Reverend [[Richard Cameron (Covenanter)|Richard Cameron]], soon to be known as the [[Cameronian]]s. Hitherto, many in the Covenanter underground maintained an outward loyalty to the king, despite their opposition to the religious policy of his government; but the Cameronians took matters to a new height, renouncing their allegiance to Charles and denouncing his brother, James, as a papist. One extreme position inevitably led to another: the government in attempting to stamp out sedition authorized field executions without trial. This was the beginning of what [[Robert Wodrow]] later called [[the Killing Time]]. Cameron himself was killed in a clash with government forces at [[Airds Moss]] in July 1680, but his followers, now a tiny part of the Covenanter movement, continued to exist. After the accession of [[James II of England|James VII]] in 1685 the King issued a series of ''Letters of Indulgence'' allowing such \"ousted ministers as had lived peaceably and orderly to return to their livings\".<ref name=Catholic >The Catholic Encyclopedia.</ref> This succeeded in luring many ministers away from the struggle, but those remaining became more determined. When [[William III of England|William of Orange]] summoned a ''Convention of the Estates'' which met on 14 March 1689 in Edinburgh to consider whether Scotland should recognise him or James, forces of Cameronians arrived to bolster William's support. In the subsequent [[Dundee's rising|Jacobite rising]], the [[26th (Cameronian) Regiment of Foot|Cameronian Guard]] helped to defeat the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] Highlanders, particularly at the [[Battle of Dunkeld]]. Although the Cameronians had helped to defend the Revolution, they were disappointed that their religious views were not adopted by the new government. The binding obligation of the National Covenant (1638) and the Solemn League and Covenant (1643) was passed over since the acts of parliament in favour of these had been rescinded by Charles and were not revived under William and Mary. For some Covenanters even William of Orange was an \"uncovenanted\" King since he was head of the Church of England which was an episcopal church. Perhaps 1000 people in the south west made an issue of the failure to maintain the covenants and also, with some justification, viewed the new establishment as tainted by [[Thomas Erastus|Erastianism]]. They formed the ''United Societies'' refusing to recognise the \"usurped\" Church of Scotland.<ref name=Wayback>Who is the Reformed Presbyterian Church (Covenanted)?</ref>\n\n==Martyrs and memorials==\nThough the rebellion had ended and a degree of Presbyterian tolerance for other faiths had been suggested by thanks given for James's Indulgence of 1687, for allowing all \"to serve God after their own way and manner\",<ref name=Catholic/> memories of \"[[the Killing Time]]\" were now kept alive by monuments and tombstones at the many [[martyr]] graves across the south of Scotland, particularly the south west. \"For the word of God and Scotland's work of Reformation.

Quite often the corpse was hanged or beheaded first\", and burying the body in the kirkyard could result in another punitive death.<ref name=Fifty/> In 1707 a monument was erected at [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] in Edinburgh, near the open ground known as the \"Covenanters' Prison\", where some twelve-hundred Covenanters were held captive after Bothwell.<ref name=Grey/> It gives a figure of 18,000 killed in the period 1661 to 1680, quoting an estimate which [[Daniel Defoe]] claimed was \"Collected from the Accounts both Publick and Private\" for his ''Memoirs of the Church of Scotland'' (1717).\n\n''The History of the Sufferings of the Church of Scotland from the Restoration to the Revolution'' by [[Robert Wodrow]], published in 1721-1722, produced a detailed record and denounced the persecution of the Covenanters.

Having come to Ireland for religious, economic, and political reasons throughout the Seventeenth Century, Scottish Presbyterians, including Covenanters, once again for religious, economic, and political reasons felt compelled to migrate again. The migration is usually dated from the year 1717, when preacher [[William Tennent]], founder of [[Log College]], the first Presbyterian seminary in North America, came with his family to the [http://Philadelphia Philadelphia] area. In North America Covenanters became known as members of the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America|Reformed Presbyterian Church]]. They were among the most vocal agitators for independence from Great Britain and volunteered in large numbers as soldiers in the revolutionary armies. The Covenanters were opposed to slavery, and in 1800 the Reformed Church voted to outlaw slave-holding among its members.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Calvinism|Christianity|Scotland|History|Religion}}\n* [[Religion in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]\n* [[Plantation of Ulster]]\n* [[Samuel Rutherford]]\n* [[Archibald Johnston]]\n* [[Alexander Henderson (theologian)]]\n* [[James Sharp (bishop)]]\n* [[The Killing Time]]\n* [[David Hackston]]\n* [[Richard Cameron (Covenanter)]]\n* [[Donald Cargill]]\n* [[Alexander Peden]]\n* [[James Renwick (Covenanter)]]\n* [[List of Christian denominations#Presbyterian and Reformed Churches|List of Presbyterian and Reformed denominations]]\n* [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|indent=yes}}\n::[http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/c/covenanters.html Covenanters] ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]''\n::{{cite web|url=http://www.sorbie.net/covenanters.htm |title=The Covenanters, The Fifty Years Struggle 1638-1688 |publisher=Sorbie.net |date=1920-07-26 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}\n::{{cite thesis|last=Currie|first=Janette| title=History, hagiography, and fakestory: representations of the Scottish Covenanters in non-fictional and fictional texts from 1638 to 1835|year=2009|publisher=University of Stirling|url=https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/1499|ref=harv}}\n::{{cite thesis| last=Furgol | first= E.

It was signed between September and October, in both countries, and later in the same year, in Ireland. This committed the Scots to supply an army to aid the Parliamentarian Par against the Royalists in the Civil War. As in the National Covenant, the signatories pledged to 'amend our lives, and each one to go before another in the example of a real Reformation'. As with the National Covenant they entered into a mutual contract with God where the signatory promised to reform his or her person, in this case, not only for the upholding of 'the Religion', but that 'the Lord may tu away his wrath, and heavy indignation'. (All quotations are from 'The Solemn League and Covenant', reprinted in SB, ILL, pp.122-5). The success of the Scottish National Covenant was thought by many sectarians and clergy alike to have been the direct result of the process of mutual bonding between the nation and God. Thus, at a time of rising religious schism, a threatened invasion of Irish Catholics and Royalist-Parliamentarian hostilities, the English Parliamentarians bound themselves to the same course that had appeared to guarantee the Scots 'virtually unmitigated success' (Edward J. Cowan, 'The Making of the National Covenant', in John Morrell, ed. (1988), p.75).</ref>\n\n==Beginnings==\nThe Covenanters are so named for the series of bonds or covenants by which the adherents bound themselves to maintain the Presbyterian doctrine and polity as the sole form of religion of their country. The first \"godly bond\" of the [[Lords of the Congregation]] and their followers is dated December 1557; but more important is the [[s:National Covenant of the Church of Scotland|National Covenant of the Church of Scotland]] (1581), drawn up by [[John Craig (minister)|John Craig]] in consequence of the strenuous efforts [[Roman Catholic]]s were making to regain their hold upon Scotland, and called the King's Confession or Negative Confession.  Based on the [[Scots Confession|Scots Confession of Faith of 1560]], this document denounced the [[Pope]] and the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church in no measured terms. It was adopted by the General Assembly of the [[Church of Scotland]], signed by King [[James I of England|James VI]] and his household, and enjoined on persons of all ranks and classes, and was subscribed to again in 1590 and 1596.<ref>{{cite news |last1=MacPherson |first1=Hamish |title=How the defiance of the Covenanters changed history |url=http://www.thenational.scot/news/15658853.How_the_defiance_of_the_Covenanters_changed_history/ |accessdate=17 August 2018 |agency=The National |date=14 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Upheaval and the Wars of the Three Kingdoms==\n{{refimprove|section|date=February 2020}}\nIn 1637, Scotland was in a state of turmoil. [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] and [[William Laud]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], met with a reverse in their efforts to impose a new liturgy on the Scots. The new liturgy had been devised by a panel of Scottish bishops, including [[John Spottiswoode|Archbishop Spottiswoode]] of St. Andrews, but a riot against its use was orchestrated in [[St Giles' Cathedral]], Edinburgh, ostensibly started by [[Jenny Geddes]]. Fearing further measures on the part of the king, it occurred to [[Archibald Johnston]] (Lord Warriston) to revive the Negative Confession of 1581 in a form suited to the times. Together with the cooperation of [[Alexander Henderson (theologian)|Alexander Henderson]], this National Covenant (as it was called) was finalized in early 1638.\n\n[[File:Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] where the National Covenant was signed in 1638]]\n[[File:The Signing of the National Covenant in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Signing of the National Covenant in Greyfriars Kirkyard, by [[William Allan (painter)|William Allan]] ]]\n[[File:The National Covenant of 1638.JPG|thumb|left|160px|Edinburgh's copy of the National Covenant]]\nAdditional matter intended to suit the document to the special circumstances of the time was added, primarily a recital of the acts of parliament against \"superstitious and papistical rites\" and an elaborate oath to maintain the reformed religion. The Covenant was adopted and signed by a large gathering in the [[Greyfriars Kirkyard|kirkyard]] of [[Greyfriars Kirk]] in [[Edinburgh]], on 28 February 1638, after which copies were sent throughout the country for signing. The subscribers engaged by oath to maintain religion in the form that it existed in 1580, and to reject all innovations introduced since that time, while also professing loyalty to the king. It did not specifically reject episcopacy but in effect undermined it. Further subscriptions and swearing ceremonies took place across Scotland, emotionally charged events evoking mass crying and yelling.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Scottish Puritanism, 1590-1638|last=Mullan|first=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=0-19-826997-8|location=Oxford|pages=288-289}}</ref> The year 1638 marked an apex of events for the Covenanters, for it was the time of broad confrontations with the established church supported by the monarchy. Confrontations occurred in several parts of Scotland, such as the one with the [[Bishops of Aberdeen]] by a high level assembly of Covenanters staging their operations from [[Muchalls Castle]]. The General Assembly of 1638 was composed of ardent Covenanters, and in 1640 the Covenant was adopted by the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish parliament]], its subscription being made a requirement for all citizens. Before this date, the Covenanters were usually referred to as Supplicants, but from about this time the former designation began to prevail. The Covenanters raised an army to resist Charles I's religious reforms, and defeated him in the [[Bishops' Wars]]. The crisis that this caused to the Stuart monarchy helped bring about the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], which included the [[English Civil War]], the [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Scottish Civil War]] and [[Irish Confederate Wars]].\n\nFor the following ten years of civil war in Britain, the Covenanters were the ''[[de facto]]'' government of Scotland. In 1642, they sent an army to [[Ulster]] in Ireland to protect the Scottish settlers there from the Irish Catholic rebels who had attacked them in the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]]. The Scottish army remained in Ireland until the end of the civil wars, but was confined to its garrison around [[Carrickfergus]] after its defeat at the [[Battle of Benburb]] in 1646.\n\n[[File:The Solemn League And Covenant.jpg|thumb|The Solemn League And Covenant, as publicised in England]]\n{{wikisource|Solemn League and Covenant}}\nA further Covenanter military intervention began in 1643. The leaders of the English Parliament, worsted in the English Civil War, implored the aid of the Scots, which was promised on condition that the Scottish system of church government would be adopted in England. Following considerable debate, a document called the [[Solemn League and Covenant]] was drawn up. This was in effect a treaty between England and Scotland which called for the preservation of the reformed religion in Scotland and the reformation of religion in England and Ireland \"according to the word of God and the example of the best reformed churches\", and the extirpation of [[popery]] and [[prelacy]]. It did not explicitly mention [[Presbyterianism]] and included some ambiguous formulations that left the door open to Independency. It was subscribed to by many in both kingdoms and also in Ireland. It was approved by the English Parliament. With some slight modifications it was approved by the [[Westminster Assembly of Divines]]. This agreement meant that the Covenanters sent another army south to England to fight on the Parliamentarian side in the [[First English Civil War]]. The Scottish armies in England were instrumental in bringing about the victory of the English Parliament over the king.<ref>{{cite news |last1=MacPherson |first1=Hamish |title=How the Solemn League and Covenant of 1643 changed our islands forever |url=http://www.thenational.scot/news/15673067.How_the_Solemn_League_and_Covenant_of_1643_changed_our_islands_forever/ |accessdate=17 August 2018 |agency=The National |date=21 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn turn, this sparked the outbreak of civil war in Scotland in 1644\u201347, as Scottish [[Cavalier|Royalist]] opponents of the Covenanters took up arms against them. Royalism was most common among Scottish Roman Catholics and [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalians]], who were opposed to the Covenanters' imposition of their religious settlement on the country.  The Covenanters' enemies, led by [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]] and aided by an Irish expeditionary force and Highland clans led by [[Alasdair Mac Colla]] won a series of victories over hastily raised Covenanter forces in 1644\u201345. However, the Scottish Royalists were ultimately defeated in September 1645, at the [[Battle of Philiphaugh]], near [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]]. The disaster at Philiphaugh was largely due to the Royalists' own disunity and the return of the main Covenanter armies from England. The civil war in Scotland was a bitter episode which exposed the religious divisions between Presbyterians, Episcopalians and Catholics, the political divisions between Royalists and Covenanters and the cultural divisions between the Highlands and Lowlands.\n\n[[File:Replica Covenanter flag, Royal Scottish Museum.jpg|thumb|alt=alt text|Replica Covenanter flag, National Museum of Scotland]]\nThe end of the first civil wars in Scotland and England left the Covenanters hopeful that their Solemn League and Covenant would be implemented in the Three Kingdoms. However, Charles I refused to accept it when he surrendered himself to the Scots in 1646. He was taken to Newcastle, where several attempts were made to persuade him to take the Covenants.  When this failed, he was handed over to the commissioners of Parliament in early 1647. However, many Covenanters, led by [[James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton|James Hamilton]], were suspicious of their English allies' intentions and opened secret negotiations with Charles I. He made important concessions to them in the \"[[engagers|Engagement]]\" made with the Scots in December 1647. The Engagement was rejected by the militant Covenanters known as the [[Kirk Party]], who wanted the king to endorse their agenda explicitly before an alliance could be reached. A Scottish army invaded England in support of the Engagement, but was routed at the [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Battle of Preston]], leaving the Kirk Party in the ascendant in Scotland. The [[Westminster Confession of Faith]], which had been submitted for ratification in 1646, was in part adopted by act of the English Parliament in 1648 as the Articles of Christian Religion, while in Scotland it was approved with minor reservations in August 1647 and ratified by the Scottish Parliament in February 1649.\n\nThe Covenanters' insistence on dictating the future of both Scotland and England eventually led to all-out war with their erstwhile allies, the English Parliament, and to the Covenanters signing an alliance with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] known as the [[Treaty of Breda (1650)|Treaty of Breda]]. Charles II, before landing in Scotland in June 1650, declared by a solemn oath his approbation of both covenants, and this was renewed on the occasion of his coronation at Scone in the following January.\n\nHowever, the Covenanters were utterly defeated in 1650\u201352 by the forces of the English Parliament under [[Oliver Cromwell]]. Lowland Scotland was occupied by the [[New Model Army]] and the Covenanters were sidelined. From 1638 to 1651 the Covenanters, led by [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll]], had been the dominant party in Scotland, directing policy both at home and abroad. Their power had been seriously weakened, however, by Cromwell's victory at [[battle of Dunbar (1650)|Dunbar]] in September 1650 and was practically destroyed after the [[Battle of Worcester]] and the English occupation of Lowland Scotland. Under Cromwell's [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]], Scotland was forced into a temporary union with England and the General Assembly of the Kirk lost all civil power.\n\n==Restoration and \"The Killing Time\"==\n{{main|The Killing Time}}\n[[File:Murder scene, Archbishop Sharp Memorial, St. Andrews.JPG|thumb|The murder of Archbishop Sharp on his memorial at St. Andrews]]\n[[File:A Covenanters' Conventicle, from a children's history book.jpg|thumb|A conventicle in progress, from a children's history book published in 1906]]\n[[File:Covenanter Bible.jpg|thumb|A Covenanter's bible in the National Museum of Scotland]]\n[[File:Covenanters Prison, Greyfriars Kirkyard - geograph.org.uk - 1351472.jpg|thumb|Covenanters Prison, Greyfriars Kirkyard]]\nWorse was to come for the Covenanters when Charles II was [[Restoration (Scotland)|restored]] nine years later.  Firmly seated upon the throne, Charles renounced the covenants, which in 1662 were declared unlawful oaths to be abjured by all persons holding public offices. Argyll himself was executed for treason, [[episcopacy]] was restored, [[James Sharp (bishop)|James Sharp]] was appointed [[Archbishop of St Andrews]] and Primate of Scotland, the court of high commission was revived, and ministers who refused to recognize the authority of the bishops were expelled from their livings. Archbishop Sharp survived an assassination attempt in 1668 only to be killed by another group of Covenanters in 1679.\n\nFollowing the restoration of Episcopacy, rebel ministers began to preach at secret open-air meetings in the countryside known as \"[[conventicles]]\". A period of sustained persecution began. Oppressive measures against these illegal field assemblies where attendance was made a capital offence<ref name=Covenanters>{{cite web|url=http://www.sorbie.net/covenanters.htm |title=The Covenanters, The Fifty Years Struggle 1638-1688 |publisher=Sorbie.net |date=1920-07-26 |accessdate=2012-05-14}}</ref> led to an outbreak of armed rebellion in 1666, originating in Galloway. Advancing from the west towards Edinburgh, a small force of poorly armed Covenanters was defeated at the [[Battle of Rullion Green]] in the [[Pentland Hills]], a location which caused the whole tragic episode to be misleadingly named the Pentland Rising. To quell unrest in south-west Scotland, the government brought in 6,000 [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]] soldiers, described by its enemies as an \"inhumane and barbarous Highland host\", which were quartered on suspected Covenanters and were accused of committing many atrocities.<ref name=Covenanters/>\n\nA further rebellion broke out in 1679, after the unexpected success of a group of covenanters, armed with pitch forks and the like, against government forces led by [[John Graham of Claverhouse]] at the [[Battle of Drumclog]]. For a time the authorities looked in danger of losing control of the south west of Scotland, as more and more people joined the rebel camp at Bothwell near [[Glasgow]]; but only a few weeks after Drumclog the rebels were defeated at the [[Battle of Bothwell Brig]]. In the weeks before the battle the Covenanters spent more time arguing among themselves than preparing for the inevitable counterstroke, which did much to contribute towards their downfall. Of 1,200 captured rebels taken to Edinburgh, some 400 were imprisoned in an area of Greyfriars Kirkyard over the winter months.<ref name=greyfriars>{{cite web |url=http://www.covenanter.org.uk/Greyfriars/ |title=Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh |publisher=Covenanter.org.uk |accessdate=2012-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513123235/http://www.covenanter.org.uk/Greyfriars/ |archivedate=2013-05-13 }}</ref>\n\nInevitably, the government behaved harshly at first towards some of those caught in arms. On the initiative of [[James, Duke of Monmouth]], who led the king's army to victory at Bothwell Brig, a more conciliatory policy was followed for a time, though this met with limited success.\n\nThrough the period of repression the Covenanters held their convictions with a zeal that was only intensified by the persecution. For them it was a matter of belief. For the government, in contrast, the whole conventicle movement was seen as a problem of public order, which they attempted to deal with often using very inadequate resources. However, after the collapse of the 1679 rebellion a more dangerous element entered into the whole equation.  \n[[File:Condemned Covenanters on Their Way to Execution in the West Bow, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|A painting showing the last Covenanter martyr [[James Renwick (Covenanter)|James Renwick]] being taken to execution in 1688]]\n\nIn 1680 a more extreme mood appeared among sections of the Covenanter underground, which found expression in a document known as the ''[[Sanquhar Declaration]]''.  This was the manifesto of the followers of the Reverend [[Richard Cameron (Covenanter)|Richard Cameron]], soon to be known as the [[Cameronian]]s. Hitherto, many in the Covenanter underground maintained an outward loyalty to the king, despite their opposition to the religious policy of his government; but the Cameronians took matters to a new height, renouncing their allegiance to Charles and denouncing his brother, James, as a papist. One extreme position inevitably led to another: the government in attempting to stamp out sedition authorized field executions without trial. This was the beginning of what [[Robert Wodrow]] later called [[the Killing Time]]. Cameron himself was killed in a clash with government forces at [[Airds Moss]] in July 1680, but his followers, now a tiny part of the Covenanter movement, continued to exist. After the accession of [[James II of England|James VII]] in 1685 the King issued a series of ''Letters of Indulgence'' allowing such \"ousted ministers as had lived peaceably and orderly to return to their livings\".<ref name=catenc>[http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/c/covenanters.html Covenanters] ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]''</ref> This succeeded in luring many ministers away from the struggle, but those remaining became more determined. When [[William III of England|William of Orange]] summoned a ''Convention of the Estates'' which met on 14 March 1689 in Edinburgh to consider whether Scotland should recognise him or James, forces of Cameronians arrived to bolster William's support. In the subsequent [[Dundee's rising|Jacobite rising]], the [[26th (Cameronian) Regiment of Foot|Cameronian Guard]] helped to defeat the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] Highlanders, particularly at the [[Battle of Dunkeld]]. Although the Cameronians had helped to defend the Revolution, they were disappointed that their religious views were not adopted by the new government. The binding obligation of the National Covenant (1638) and the Solemn League and Covenant (1643) was passed over since the acts of parliament in favour of these had been rescinded by Charles and were not revived under William and Mary. For some Covenanters even William of Orange was an \"uncovenanted\" King since he was head of the Church of England which was an episcopal church. Perhaps 1000 people in the south west made an issue of the failure to maintain the covenants and also, with some justification, viewed the new establishment as tainted by [[Thomas Erastus|Erastianism]]. They formed the ''United Societies'' refusing to recognise the \"usurped\" Church of Scotland.<ref name=crpc>{{cite web |author=Covie |url=http://www.covenanter.org/RPCCov/aboutrpcc.htm |title=Who are the Covenanted Reformed Presbyterian Church? |publisher=Covenanter.org |accessdate=2012-05-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609050403/http://www.covenanter.org/RPCCov/aboutrpcc.htm |archivedate=2012-06-09 }}</ref>\n\n==Martyrs and memorials==\n\nThough the rebellion had ended and a degree of Presbyterian tolerance for other faiths had been suggested by thanks given for James's Indulgence of 1687, for allowing all \"to serve God after their own way and manner\",<ref name=catenc/> memories of \"[[the Killing Time]]\" were now kept alive by monuments and tombstones at the many [[martyr]] graves across the south of Scotland, particularly the south west. \"For the word of God and Scotland's work of Reformation.

Quite often the corpse was hanged or beheaded first\", and burying the body in the kirkyard could result in another punitive death.<ref name=Covenanters/> In 1707 a monument was erected at [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] in Edinburgh, near the open ground known as the \"Covenanters' Prison\", where some twelve-hundred Covenanters were held captive after Bothwell.<ref name=greyfriars/> It gives a figure of 18,000 killed in the period 1661 to 1680, quoting an estimate which [[Daniel Defoe]] claimed was \"Collected from the Accounts both Publick and Private\" for his ''Memoirs of the Church of Scotland'' (1717).\n\n''The History of the Sufferings of the Church of Scotland from the Restoration to the Revolution'' by [[Robert Wodrow]], published in 1721-1722, produced a detailed record and denounced the persecution of the Covenanters.

Having come to Ireland for religious, economic, and political reasons throughout the Seventeenth Century, Scottish Presbyterians, including Covenanters, once again for religious, economic, and political reasons felt compelled to migrate again. The migration is usually dated from the year 1717, when preacher [[William Tennent]], founder of [[Log College]], the first Presbyterian seminary in North America, came with his family to the [http://Philadelphia Philadelphia] area. In North America Covenanters became known as members of the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of North America|Reformed Presbyterian Church]]. They were among the most vocal agitators for independence from Great Britain and volunteered in large numbers as soldiers in the revolutionary armies. The Covenanters were opposed to slavery, and in 1800 the Reformed Church voted to outlaw slave-holding among its members.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Calvinism|Christianity|Scotland|History|Religion}}\n* [[Religion in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Scotland in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]\n* [[Plantation of Ulster]]\n* [[Samuel Rutherford]]\n* [[Archibald Johnston]]\n* [[Alexander Henderson (theologian)]]\n* [[James Sharp (bishop)]]\n* [[The Killing Time]]\n* [[David Hackston]]\n* [[Richard Cameron (Covenanter)]]\n* [[Donald Cargill]]\n* [[Alexander Peden]]\n* [[James Renwick (Covenanter)]]\n* [[List of Christian denominations#Presbyterian and Reformed Churches|List of Presbyterian and Reformed denominations]]\n* [[Reformed Presbyterian Church of Scotland]]\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Buckroyd, J.

To top, his own sister Leticia and her husband as well as Catalina's mother are on-and-off moochers of his wealth as well.\n\nOn the day of his birthday, Antonio realizes what he has caused when none of his loved ones remembers to congratulate him, and to top it off they only appear to ask for more and more. That's when Antonio finally snaps and decides to put a limit: from now on each of them will have to work to earn a living. His life falls apart with the arrival of Julieta, whom he almost hits with his car as she was running away from her wedding once she discovered the truth about her groom. Julieta becomes a person from whom he will not be able to separate.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jorge Salinas]] as Antonio Solano\n* [[Marjorie de Sousa]] as Julieta Vargas\n* [[Lorena Herrera]] as Catalina

In his eagerness that his family does not lack anything, Antonio is generous to the point of spoiling his wife and children; as a result the three kids, Eduardo, Javier, and Viviana become good-for-nothing spoiled brats, doing nothing but spend the money in superficial things, while his wife Catalina only worries about staying beautiful with surgeries. To top, his own sister Leticia and her husband as well as Catalina's mother are on-and-off moochers of his wealth as well.\n\nOn the day of his birthday, Antonio realizes what he has caused when none of his loved ones remembers to congratulate him, and to top it off they only appear to ask for more and more. That's when Antonio finally snaps and decides to put a limit: from now on each of them will have to work to earn a living. His life falls apart with the arrival of Julieta, whom he almost hits with his car as she was running away from her wedding once she discovered the truth about her groom. Julieta becomes a person from whom he will not be able to separate.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jorge Salinas]] as Antonio Solano\n* [[Marjorie de Sousa]] as Julieta Vargas\n* [[Lorena Herrera]] as Catalina

Prior to 1992, the only times Republicans failed to win the county in the preceding 100 years of presidential elections were in the midst of a divided party vote in 1912, the presence of Wisconsinite [[Robert La Follette]] on the ballot in 1924, & national Democratic Party landslides in 1932, 1936, & 1964. From 1992 onward, the county has been a Democratic-leaning swing county, voting for the statewide winner in all presidential elections since then except 2004 & the national winner in all except 2000. Republican [[Donald Trump]] won the county in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], though a majority of county residents voted for [[Tammy Baldwin]]'s re-election campaign for the U.S. Senate [[2018 United States Senate election in Wisconsin|two years later in 2018]].\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=May 7, 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

From 1992 onward, the county has been a Democratic-leaning swing county, voting for the statewide winner in all presidential elections since then except 2004 & the national winner in all except 2000. Republican [[Donald Trump]] won the county in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]], though a majority of county residents voted for [[Tammy Baldwin]]'s re-election campaign for the U.S. Senate [[2018 United States Senate election in Wisconsin|two years later in 2018]].\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=May 7, 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

The geography of Ferrol meant that an entire Spanish fleet could slip out on a single tide. By the time the British were able to resume the blockade, the Spanish would be safely away and out to sea. Despite these advantages, a decline set during the reign of [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]], and in 1800, during the [[Ferrol Expedition (1800)]], after the defences had been reduced, a British fleet of 109 vessels landed troops on the beach of Doni\u00f1os to take the Castle of San Felipe.

The geography of Ferrol meant that an entire Spanish fleet could slip out on a single tide. By the time the British were able to resume the blockade, the Spanish would be safely away and out to sea. Despite these advantages, a decline set during the reign of [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]], and in 1800, during the [[Ferrol Expedition (1800)]], after the defences had been reduced, a British fleet of 109 vessels landed troops on the beach of Doni\u00f1os to take the Castle of San Felipe. Although only equipped with meagre artillery, the castle's small defence force under the command of [[Andrade|Count Donadio]] together with a sizable number of volunteer citizens of Ferrol, successfully resisted the attack and the fleet withdrew. The alliance with the [[United Kingdom]] during the [[Peninsular War]] of 1808\u201314 failed to prevent the deterioration in the town\u2019s fortunes.
