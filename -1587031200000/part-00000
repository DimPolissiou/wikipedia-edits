The club also moved into their new home, Mumbai Football Arena. The club also signed [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] Golden Ball winner [[Diego Forl\u00e1n]] on a three-month deal, with Option to Extend for another year as a marquee. <ref>{{cite news |url=https://english.kolkata24x7.com/mumbai-city-fc-announce-diego-forlan-as-marquee-player.html/|title=Mumbai City FC Announce Diego Forlan As Marquee Player}}</ref>\n\nLjungberg sat out the first season after a few brief appearances.[[Nicolas Anelka]] moved to a coaching role. This season showcased [[Diego Forl\u00e1n]]. The Uruguayan changed the dynamics of a struggling team to title contenders. Forlan scored the first hat-trick of the Hero Indian Super League 2016 season as '''Mumbai City FC''' beat [[Kerala Blasters FC|Kerala Blasters]] 5\u20130 at Mumbai Football Arena on 19 November 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.news18.com/news/football/isl-2016-diego-forlan-hat-trick-helps-mumbai-city-trounce-kerala-blasters-5-0-1313543.html|title=ISL 2016: Diego Forlan Hat-trick Helps Mumbai City Trounce Kerala Blasters 5-0}}</ref> It was also the first hat-trick of any marquee player in the history of the ISL. The team conceded the least number of goals (8) of all teams in the league, whilst Lucian Goian has the most number of tackles (67) in the league. This managed to fix the goal conceded stat in favour of the Mumbaikars. Alexandre's men kept 8 clean sheets in the group stage, making it a record across all the three editions of the tournament. This had been possible due to the rugged approach of the team. A compact midfield and a packed defense have kept the opposition attackers at bay. Argentine Matias Defederico had been partnering Forlan up front. The dual forward strategy had reaped benefits for the team. They have received the record for inflicting the biggest defeat when they had 5 goals past FC Pune City.\nAs a result, Mumbai City finished the 14 rounds with 6 wins, 5 draws and 3 losses. This was a steep improvement from previous seasons. However, it went down to Atletico de Kolkata in the twin legged semi-finals.\n\nThe Mumbai franchise continued to work with [[Alexandre Guimar\u00e3es]] after he guided the club to their first ever playoffs in three seasons. The club opted to re-sign Amrinder Singh for 12.0&nbsp;million INR. He was the best goalkeeper in the league in 2016, keeping record clean sheets for the club. They also retained the services of midfielder Sehnaj Singh who was instrumental in the club's success in the earlier season. In the foreign department, they retained the defensive duo of Lucian Goian and Gerson Vieira and midfielder Leo Costa. They also retained Rakesh Oram under the U-21 player quota.\nThey finished the season in 7th position, failing to qualify for the playoffs, with the coach being criticized for overly defensive tactics. \n\nMumbai City FC also took part in the inaugural edition of the Super Cup. They kicked off proceedings smoothly by defeating Indian Arrows by a scoreline reading 2\u20131 in the qualifier Round. However they were handed a defeat by [[East Bengal FC]] in the Round of 16. On 14 August 2018, Mumbai City FC officially stated that, \"Mumbai City FC and Alexandre   Guimar\u00e3es have parted company by mutual consent.\" This ended the Guimar\u00e3es Era with the Brazilian-born Costa Rican manager being with the Islanders since 2016.\n\n=== Jorge Costa era (2018\u20132020) ===\nAfter the announcement that Mumbai City FC had parted ways with Guimar\u00e3es, the Islanders broke the news about their new head coach. Former Portugal international Jorge Costa had signed to be the coach of Mumbai City FC for the 2018/19 Indian Super League season. The Club also signed India Internationals [[Alen Deory]] and [[Subhasish Bose]]. The Foreign Players for the new season were announced to be [[Modou Sougou]], [[Rafael Bastos]], [[Marko Klisura]], [[Arnold Issoko]], [[Paulo Machado|Paolo Machado]], [[Mat\u00edas Mirabaje|Matias Mirabaje,]] and long standing central defender [[Lucian Goian]]. The team started the season with a 2\u20130 loss at home to [[Jamshedpur FC|Jamshedpur]], followed by a 1\u20131 draw to [[Kerala Blasters FC|Kerala Blasters]]. The team then recorded a 2\u20130 win against [[FC Pune City]], and then lost 5\u20130 to Goa. After that Coach Costa made some interesting tactical changes which led to the club's best unbeaten run in history (9 games unbeaten). The team ended December with a 6\u20131 win against [[Kerala Blasters FC|Kerala Blasters]], with [[Modou Sougou]] scoring 4 of the teams 6 goals in the match, which was a record breaking tally as Sougou became the First player in the league to score 4 goals, & it was Mumbai's best victory against any club. They also managed to break league leaders [[Bengaluru FC]] 's unbeaten run at [[Mumbai Football Arena]] in January. The club managed to secure Play-off Finish with a 3\u20131 Victory against ATK on 22 February 2019 with a game in hand thanks to [[Modou Sougou]] 's second hattrick, which is also a record for having maximum hattricks for the Mumbai team. The 3rd place finish saw them face off against [[FC Goa]] , which resulted in an embarrassing 5\u20131 defeat at Home despite Mumbai opening the scoring. But they managed to bounce back and beat Goa in the Away fixture by a scoreline of 1\u20130. It wasn't enough however as the team had to bow out based on Goal Difference and hence couldn't play in the 2018/19 ISL Final happening in Mumbai itself. Even though Mumbai Lost in Play-offs, [[Arnold Issoko]] won the DHL Winning Pass of the League Award for his maximum assists (8 assists) in the League & [[Modou Sougou]] became joint second goalscorer with 12 Goals. Fan Favorite [[Amrinder Singh]] ended the league with most number of saves & joint highest number of clean sheets (6). With that positive note, on 19 March 2019, the officials of the club confirmed that Head Coach Jorge Costa had extended his stay at the club. The Portuguese signed a one-year extension and would continue to be at the helm for the Islanders until the end of the 2019/20 season. \n\nThe next task at hand for Jorge Costa and the side was the 2019 Hero Super Cup with the Islanders drawn to play [[Chennaiyin FC]] in the Round of 16 on 29 March at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneshwar. Costa opted to play with an almost all-Indian Squad having [[Lucian Goian]] as the only foreign recruit in their ranks. Costa also Promoted two highly rated youngsters from the youth ranks, Mohammed Kaif & Nakul Shelke. The team started off promisingly, but failed to capitalise on the chances created & were eliminated from the Super Cup with a 2\u20130 defeat. \n\nAfter announcing the departure of club captain and record appearance maker [[Lucian Goian]] to [[Chennaiyin FC]] before the 2019\u201320 season, MCFC brought in [[Mato Grgi\u0107|Mato Grgic]], [[S\u00e8rge Kevyn|Serge Kevyn]], [[Amine Chermiti]], [[Diego Carlos]], and [[Mohamed Larbi]] to replace the departing captain as well as [[Arnold Issoko]], who recorded the highest amount of assists in the league during the 2018/19 season. [[Jorge Costa]] was retained as coach for the new season, with the first game of the 2019\u201320 season resulting in a 1\u20130 win over [[Kerala Blasters FC|Kerala Blasters]]. There were ups and downs for Jorge Costa's team but injuries to the mainstays of the team hamper MCFC's good run. but in the end, they fell short of the final playoff spot by three points. Mumbai City finished fifth on the table, three points below [[Chennaiyin FC]] but coach Coasta still managed to keep Mumbai competitive despite suffering from injury issues to some of his key players. looking back at the records the Islanders had registered a record statistic as they had 12 players on the scoresheet who had scored the team's total of 15 goals. Costa's Mumbai City had a reputation for being defensively strong and lethal on the counter-attack. With a shrewd game plan on his hand, Costa's teams always churned out results when it mattered most to them. And against big teams in the league, they always turned up. In fact, Costa's Mumbai City is the first team to do a league double over Bengaluru FC in the ISL and they haven't lost to them in two years. It looked good back then but at the end of the season, none of Mumbai City's attackers has recorded a double-digit tally of goals. and after the season got over, The Islanders had parted ways with Portuguese tactician Jorge Costa after two years at the club. Costa departs after making an impact at the club. With Costa leaving behind a legacy of a strong defence.\n\n== Supporters ==\nThe West Coast Brigade is the official fan club of Mumbai City FC, which is known for its support to the team both home and away. Renowned for travelling in large numbers to support the team across the length and breadth of the country, the West Coast Brigade is held in high regard by the MCFC management and the players as they have dedicated a stand for West Coast Brigade members in the Mumbai Football Arena. In 2017, Mumbai City FC became the first club in ISL history to announce a special section for away fans.\n\n==Rivalries==\nFrom league's inception, [[FC Pune City]] (now dissolved) and Mumbai City FC were the only two clubs in the Indian Super League from a single state i.e. Maharashtra, which created an elite rivalry between the two. But from 2019 season, MCFC is the only club representing the state of Maharashtra. As well as this, [[Delhi Dynamos]] (now [[Odisha FC]]) had previously been a significant rival of MCFC due to Mumbai and Delhi being the two largest and most significant Indian cities. \n\n== Crest ==\nThe crest is a reflection of the city's identity. It consists of three main elements, all forming the city's image. The fortress wall on the top depicts the resilient, proud and determined spirit of [[Mumbai]] and its people. The seven stars are a reference to the seven islands that form Mumbai, each, an integral and special part of the city. The railway system is an important part of the city, and proves to be its lifeline. It is also the symbol for the spirit of Mumbai \u2013 diverse, yet united. It is on this very fundamental that the city functions as a competent, cohesive unit, and thus, the train has been incorporated in the crest. The navy blue colour represents the sea; a figure the city is deeply connected to, in both economic as well as symbolic terms. The white represents sincerity and purity, both of which, the club strives to embody.\n\n==Stadium==\n[[File:Mumbai Football Arena.jpg|thumb|[[Mumbai Football Arena]]]]\n{{Main|Mumbai Football Arena}}\nMumbai City FC played their home games at the [[DY Patil Stadium]] for two seasons (2014\u20132015), they shifted their home ground to [[Mumbai Football Arena]] from 3rd season.

The club also moved into their new home, Mumbai Football Arena. The club also signed [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] Golden Ball winner [[Diego Forl\u00e1n]] on a three-month deal, with Option to Extend for another year as a marquee. <ref>{{cite news |url=https://english.kolkata24x7.com/mumbai-city-fc-announce-diego-forlan-as-marquee-player.html/|title=Mumbai City FC Announce Diego Forlan As Marquee Player}}</ref>\n\nLjungberg sat out the first season after a few brief appearances.[[Nicolas Anelka]] moved to a coaching role. This season showcased [[Diego Forl\u00e1n]]. The Uruguayan changed the dynamics of a struggling team to title contenders. Forlan scored the first hat-trick of the Hero Indian Super League 2016 season as '''Mumbai City FC''' beat [[Kerala Blasters FC|Kerala Blasters]] 5\u20130 at Mumbai Football Arena on 19 November 2016.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.news18.com/news/football/isl-2016-diego-forlan-hat-trick-helps-mumbai-city-trounce-kerala-blasters-5-0-1313543.html|title=ISL 2016: Diego Forlan Hat-trick Helps Mumbai City Trounce Kerala Blasters 5-0}}</ref> It was also the first hat-trick of any marquee player in the history of the ISL. The team conceded the least number of goals (8) of all teams in the league, whilst Lucian Goian has the most number of tackles (67) in the league. This managed to fix the goal conceded stat in favour of the Mumbaikars. Alexandre's men kept 8 clean sheets in the group stage, making it a record across all the three editions of the tournament. This had been possible due to the rugged approach of the team. A compact midfield and a packed defense have kept the opposition attackers at bay. Argentine Matias Defederico had been partnering Forlan up front. The dual forward strategy had reaped benefits for the team. They have received the record for inflicting the biggest defeat when they had 5 goals past FC Pune City.\nAs a result, Mumbai City finished the 14 rounds with 6 wins, 5 draws and 3 losses. This was a steep improvement from previous seasons. However, it went down to Atletico de Kolkata in the twin legged semi-finals.\n\nThe Mumbai franchise continued to work with [[Alexandre Guimar\u00e3es]] after he guided the club to their first ever playoffs in three seasons. The club opted to re-sign Amrinder Singh for 12.0&nbsp;million INR. He was the best goalkeeper in the league in 2016, keeping record clean sheets for the club. They also retained the services of midfielder Sehnaj Singh who was instrumental in the club's success in the earlier season. In the foreign department, they retained the defensive duo of Lucian Goian and Gerson Vieira and midfielder Leo Costa. They also retained Rakesh Oram under the U-21 player quota.\nThey finished the season in 7th position, failing to qualify for the playoffs, with the coach being criticized for overly defensive tactics. \n\nMumbai City FC also took part in the inaugural edition of the Super Cup. They kicked off proceedings smoothly by defeating Indian Arrows by a scoreline reading 2\u20131 in the qualifier Round. However they were handed a defeat by [[East Bengal FC]] in the Round of 16. On 14 August 2018, Mumbai City FC officially stated that, \"Mumbai City FC and Alexandre   Guimar\u00e3es have parted company by mutual consent.\" This ended the Guimar\u00e3es Era with the Brazilian-born Costa Rican manager being with the Islanders since 2016.\n\n=== Jorge Costa era (2018\u20132020) ===\nAfter the announcement that Mumbai City FC had parted ways with Guimar\u00e3es, the Islanders broke the news about their new head coach. Former Portugal international Jorge Costa had signed to be the coach of Mumbai City FC for the 2018/19 Indian Super League season. The Club also signed India Internationals [[Alen Deory]] and [[Subhasish Bose]]. The Foreign Players for the new season were announced to be [[Modou Sougou]], [[Rafael Bastos]], [[Marko Klisura]], [[Arnold Issoko]], [[Paulo Machado|Paolo Machado]], [[Mat\u00edas Mirabaje|Matias Mirabaje,]] and long standing central defender [[Lucian Goian]]. The team started the season with a 2\u20130 loss at home to [[Jamshedpur FC|Jamshedpur]], followed by a 1\u20131 draw to [[Kerala Blasters FC|Kerala Blasters]]. The team then recorded a 2\u20130 win against [[FC Pune City]], and then lost 5\u20130 to Goa. After that Coach Costa made some interesting tactical changes which led to the club's best unbeaten run in history (9 games unbeaten). The team ended December with a 6\u20131 win against [[Kerala Blasters FC|Kerala Blasters]], with [[Modou Sougou]] scoring 4 of the teams 6 goals in the match, which was a record breaking tally as Sougou became the First player in the league to score 4 goals, & it was Mumbai's best victory against any club. They also managed to break league leaders [[Bengaluru FC]] 's unbeaten run at [[Mumbai Football Arena]] in January. The club managed to secure Play-off Finish with a 3\u20131 Victory against ATK on 22 February 2019 with a game in hand thanks to [[Modou Sougou]] 's second hattrick, which is also a record for having maximum hattricks for the Mumbai team. The 3rd place finish saw them face off against [[FC Goa]] , which resulted in an embarrassing 5\u20131 defeat at Home despite Mumbai opening the scoring. But they managed to bounce back and beat Goa in the Away fixture by a scoreline of 1\u20130. It wasn't enough however as the team had to bow out based on Goal Difference and hence couldn't play in the 2018/19 ISL Final happening in Mumbai itself. Even though Mumbai Lost in Play-offs, [[Arnold Issoko]] won the DHL Winning Pass of the League Award for his maximum assists (8 assists) in the League & [[Modou Sougou]] became joint second goalscorer with 12 Goals. Fan Favorite [[Amrinder Singh]] ended the league with most number of saves & joint highest number of clean sheets (6). With that positive note, on 19 March 2019, the officials of the club confirmed that Head Coach Jorge Costa had extended his stay at the club. The Portuguese signed a one-year extension and would continue to be at the helm for the Islanders until the end of the 2019/20 season. \n\nThe next task at hand for Jorge Costa and the side was the 2019 Hero Super Cup with the Islanders drawn to play [[Chennaiyin FC]] in the Round of 16 on 29 March at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneshwar. Costa opted to play with an almost all-Indian Squad having [[Lucian Goian]] as the only foreign recruit in their ranks. Costa also Promoted two highly rated youngsters from the youth ranks, Mohammed Kaif & Nakul Shelke. The team started off promisingly, but failed to capitalise on the chances created & were eliminated from the Super Cup with a 2\u20130 defeat. \n\nAfter announcing the departure of club captain and record appearance maker [[Lucian Goian]] to [[Chennaiyin FC]] before the 2019\u201320 season, MCFC brought in [[Mato Grgi\u0107|Mato Grgic]], [[S\u00e8rge Kevyn|Serge Kevyn]], [[Amine Chermiti]], [[Diego Carlos]], and [[Mohamed Larbi]] to replace the departing captain as well as [[Arnold Issoko]], who recorded the highest amount of assists in the league during the 2018/19 season. [[Jorge Costa]] was retained as coach for the new season, with the first game of the 2019\u201320 season resulting in a 1\u20130 win over [[Kerala Blasters FC|Kerala Blasters]]. There were ups and downs for Jorge Costa's team but injuries to the mainstays of the team hamper MCFC's good run. but in the end, they fell short of the final playoff spot by three points. Mumbai City finished fifth on the table, three points below [[Chennaiyin FC]] but coach Coasta still managed to keep Mumbai competitive despite suffering from injury issues to some of his key players. looking back at the records the Islanders had registered a record statistic as they had 12 players on the scoresheet who had scored the team's total of 15 goals. Costa's Mumbai City had a reputation for being defensively strong and lethal on the counter-attack. With a shrewd game plan on his hand, Costa's teams always churned out results when it mattered most to them. And against big teams in the league, they always turned up. In fact, Costa's Mumbai City is the first team to do a league double over Bengaluru FC in the ISL and they haven't lost to them in two years. It looked good back then but at the end of the season, none of Mumbai City's attackers has recorded a double-digit tally of goals. and after the season got over, The Islanders had parted ways with Portuguese tactician Jorge Costa after two years at the club. Costa departs after making an impact at the club. With Costa leaving behind a legacy of a strong defence.\n\n== Supporters ==\nThe West Coast Brigade is the official fan club of Mumbai City FC, which is known for its support to the team both home and away. Renowned for travelling in large numbers to support the team across the length and breadth of the country, the West Coast Brigade is held in high regard by the MCFC management and the players as they have dedicated a stand for West Coast Brigade members in the Mumbai Football Arena. In 2017, Mumbai City FC became the first club in ISL history to announce a special section for away fans.\n\n==Rivalries==\nFrom league's inception, [[FC Pune City]] (now dissolved) and Mumbai City FC were the only two clubs in the Indian Super League from a single state i.e. Maharashtra, which created an elite rivalry between the two. But from 2019 season, MCFC is the only club representing the state of Maharashtra. As well as this, [[Delhi Dynamos]] (now [[Odisha FC]]) had previously been a significant rival of MCFC due to Mumbai and Delhi being the two largest and most significant Indian cities. \n\n== Crest ==\nThe crest is a reflection of the city's identity. It consists of three main elements, all forming the city's image. The fortress wall on the top depicts the resilient, proud and determined spirit of [[Mumbai]] and its people. The seven stars are a reference to the seven islands that form Mumbai, each, an integral and special part of the city. The railway system is an important part of the city, and proves to be its lifeline. It is also the symbol for the spirit of Mumbai \u2013 diverse, yet united. It is on this very fundamental that the city functions as a competent, cohesive unit, and thus, the train has been incorporated in the crest. The navy blue colour represents the sea; a figure the city is deeply connected to, in both economic as well as symbolic terms. The white represents sincerity and purity, both of which, the club strives to embody.\n\n==Stadium==\n[[File:Mumbai Football Arena.jpg|thumb|[[Mumbai Football Arena]]]]\n{{Main|Mumbai Football Arena}}\nMumbai City FC played their home games at the [[DY Patil Stadium]] for two seasons (2014\u20132015), they shifted their home ground to [[Mumbai Football Arena]] from 3rd season.

Shivaji carved out an enclave from the declining [[Adilshahi sultanate]] of [[Bijapur]] that formed the genesis of the [[Maratha Empire]]. In 1674, he was formally crowned as the ''[[chhatrapati]]'' (emperor) of his realm at [[Raigad Fort|Raigad]].\n\nOver the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the [[Mughal Empire]], [[Sultanate of Golkonda]] and [[Sultanate of Bijapur]], as well as European colonial powers. Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations. He revived ancient Hindu political traditions and court conventions and promoted the usage of [[Marathi language|Marathi]] and [[Sanskrit]], rather than [[Persian language]], in court and administration.\n\nShivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but he began to take on increased importance with the emergence of the [[Indian independence movement]], as many elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.{{sfn|Wolpert|1962|p=81}} Particularly in [[Maharashtra]], debates over his history and role have engendered great passion and sometimes even violence as disparate groups have sought to characterise him and his legacy.<!-- DOES NOT NEED CITE SINCE ITS A SUMMARY OF OBJECTIVE POINTS FROM HISTORIOGRAPHY SECTION -->\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n<br />\n\n==Early life==\n{{main|Early life of Shivaji}}\nShivaji was born in the hill-fort of [[Shivneri]], near the city of [[Junnar]] in what is now [[Pune district]].
