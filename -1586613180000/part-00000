Today at Phillips Exeter Academy, all classes are taught using this method, with no more than 12 or 13. In November 1930, Harkness gave Exeter $5.8 million to support this initiative.

The report harshly criticized the school for not supporting the victims when they reported the incidents and for a pattern of not including these allegations in the faculty members' files. Apparently, the school maintained two sets of files, and would keep the more sensitive material away from Human Resources and prospective employers. Typically, faculty members would then leave Exeter but get hired at peer schools. In at least one case, the teacher then molested students at his next school. The school has apologized.<ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/phillips-exeter-academy-new-hampshire-former-staffers-accused-of-abuse-2018-08-25/| title=11 former New Hampshire prep school staffers accused of abuse| work=CBS News| date=August 25, 2018| access-date=August 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/us/phillips-exeter-sex-assault.html| last1=P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a| first1=Richard| title=Phillips Exeter Deans Failed to Report Sex Assault Case, Police Say| date=November 14, 2017| access-date=August 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Emblems==\n\n===Academy seal===\nExeter has two chief symbols: a seal depicting a river, sun and [[beehive]], incorporating the academy's mottos; and the ''Lion Rampant''.

A beehive often represented the industry and cooperation of a lodge or, in this case, the studies and united efforts of Academy students. The ''Lion Rampant'' is derived from the Phillips family's [[coat of arms]], and suggests that all of the academy's alumni are part of the \"Exonian family\".\n\nExeter has three mottoes on the academy seal: ''Non Sibi'' (Latin 'Not for oneself') indicating a life based on community and duty; ''Finis origine pendet'' (Latin 'The end depends on the beginning') reflecting Exeter's emphasis on hard work as preparation for a fruitful adult life; and ''\u03a7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9 \u0398\u03b5\u03bf\u1fe6'' (Greek 'By the grace of God') reflecting Exeter's Calvinist origins, of which the only remnant today is the school's requirement that most students take two courses in religion or philosophy.<ref>{{cite web|last=The Trustees of Phillips Exeter Academy|title=Phillips Exeter Academy {{!}} Academy Archives|url=https://www.exeter.edu/academics/library/archives-special-collections|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===School colors and the alumnus tie===\nThere are several variants of school colors associated with Phillips Exeter Academy that range from crimson red and white to burgundy red and silver.

John Phillips had made his fortune as a merchant and banker before going into public service, and financially supported his nephew [[Samuel Phillips, Jr.]] in founding his own school, [[Phillips Academy]], in [[Andover, Massachusetts]], three years earlier.

Today at Phillips Exeter Academy, all classes are taught using this method, with no more than 12 or 13. In November 1930, Harkness gave Exeter $5.8 million to support this initiative.

However, racial strife and ideological differences led to its [[Singapore in Malaysia|separation]] to become a sovereign [[city-state]] two years later. With overwhelming parliamentary control at every election, Lee oversaw Singapore's transformation from a British crown colony with a natural deep harbour to a [[Developed country|developed]] country with a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income]] economy. In the process, he forged a system of [[meritocracy|meritocratic]], highly effective and non-corrupt government and civil service. Many of his policies are now taught at the [[Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy]]. Lee eschewed [[populist]] policies in favour of long-term social and economic planning. He championed [[meritocracy]] and [[multiracialism]] as governing principles, making English the [[common language]] to integrate its immigrant society and to facilitate trade with the West, whilst mandating [[bilingualism]] in schools to preserve students' [[mother tongue]] and ethnic identity.\n\nLee's rule was criticised for curtailing civil liberties (media control and limits on public protests) and bringing libel suits against political opponents.

He related that London overwhelmed him and he sought the more pleasant surroundings of Cambridge, where he read law at [[Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge|Fitzwilliam College]]. A fellow Raffles College student introduced him to the Censor of Fitzwilliam House, W. S. Thatcher, who admitted him for the 1947 Lent term. He matriculated in January 1947.\n\nLee graduated First Class in both parts of the Tripos with an exceptional Starred-First for Part II Law in 1949; this placed him at the very top of his cohort, and he was awarded the Fitzwilliam's Whitlock Prize. The college said he was placed above two contemporaries who later became Professors of Law in Cambridge. Lee was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in 1950. In 1969, he was elected an honorary fellow of Fitzwilliam College and was the most senior of the College's Honorary Fellows for many years.

However, a lift-boy in his office told him his file had been taken out by the security department, and he realised he was being followed by Japanese security personnel (which continued for three months), so he abandoned those plans as he knew if he went ahead, he would be in trouble.

He also worked as a legal advisor to the [[Trade union|trade]] and [[students' union]]s.<ref name=fromthirdworldtofirst/> His first experience with politics in Singapore was his role as election agent for Laycock under the banner of the pro-British [[Progressive Party (Singapore)|Progressive Party]] in the 1951 legislative council elections.<ref name=fromthirdworldtofirst/>\n\n=== Fajar trial ===\nLee was the junior counsel for the Fajar trial in May 1954 when members of the [[University Socialist Club]] were arrested for publishing an article considered [[sedition|seditious]] in the club's magazine ''The Fajar''. One story is that it was Lee who invited the lead counsel [[Denis Pritt|D. N. Pritt]] to defend the students, although this was denied by Club members. Lee gained a widespread reputation through the victory of the trial, the first sedition trial in Colonial post-war Malaya. ''The Straits Times'' on 26 August 1954 proclaimed this a \"tremendous victory for freedom of speech\". At the same time, Lee was accepted by most Singaporeans as the \"hero of high\". Furthermore, the co-operation between Lee and the Club members strengthened their relationship which was significant for Lee's future political career and the founding of the PAP.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Men in White: The Untold Story of Singapore's Ruling Political Party |last=Yap |first=Sonny |last2=Richard |first2=Lim |last3=Weng |first3=K.

He had been expelled by the party after making open disputes with his Cabinet colleagues, including over the abolition of the City Council when he was the last Mayor. Two other PAP members had followed him to join his faction and resigned from the party but did not resign their seats with Ong. Ong stood as an independent and he won the Hong Lim by-election defeating PAP candidate [[Jek Yeun Thong]], which proved a blow to the PAP for the leaders had campaigned non-stop for Jek but Ong was too popular in the Chinese community and so Jek lost the elections.\n\nLater that year another by-election was held after the death of the incumbent PAP member Baharuddin Mohammed Ariff in the constituency of [[Anson Single Member Constituency|Anson]] on 15 July 1961 which saw the political return of former [[Labour Front]] chief minister [[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Marshall]], now [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]] (WP) leader.\n\nTwo days after the Anson result, Lee assumed full responsibility for the two election setbacks and resigned as prime minister to PAP chairman [[Toh Chin Chye]], only for Toh to reject it.\n\nOn 21 July 1961, Lee then moved a [[motion of confidence]] in his own government five days after the Anson by-election. The motion was agreed to with 27 \"Ayes\", 8 \"Noes\" and 16 abstentions. The members who voted \"No\" included David Marshall and members of the [[Singapore People's Alliance]]. 13 allegedly pro-communist PAP members and 3 members of [[Ong Eng Guan]]'s UPP abstained.\n\nLee's view was that the PAP members who did not vote for his motion would be expelled for breaking ranks and pulling support away to Communist opponents and he did so, sacking the 13 abstainers and reducing his assembly majority to 1. Together with six prominent left-leaning leaders from trade unions, the breakaway members established a new party, the [[Barisan Sosialis]]. 35 of 51 branches of the PAP and 19 of 23 branch secretaries defected to Barisan.\n\n===Merger with Malaysia (1963\u20131965)===\n{{main|Singapore in Malaysia}}\n[[File:Singapore during the formation of Malaysia (16 September 1963).jpg|thumb|Lee Kuan Yew declaring the forming of the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 in Singapore]]\n\n====Lead up to merger====\nIndependence of Singapore from Britain through a merger with the Federation of Malaya had been the PAP's platform since its founding in 1954. The merger was supported both by the non-communists and the communists in the PAP. So when the PAP won a strong mandate in the 1959 General Election, it pursued merger vigorously.\n\nAfter Malaysian Prime Minister [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] proposed the formation of a federation which would include [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], Singapore, [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in 1961, Lee began to campaign for a merger to end British colonial rule. The communists made a startling about-turn and were determined to derail merger, even though they had all along insisted that Malaya and Singapore were one entity. [[Chin Peng]], leader of the [[Malayan Communist Party]] made it clear that it wished to sabotage merger or delay its implementation at that stage.\n\nLee explained in a series of radio broadcasts in 1961 that the communists and [[Barisan Sosialis]] opposed merger because they wanted to establish control over Singapore so they could subsequently subvert and take over Malaya. The radio talks won over public opinion in favour of merger on the terms proposed by Lee's government. Lee would use the results of [[1962 Singaporean national referendum|a referendum held on 1 September 1962]], in which 70% of the votes were cast in support of his merger proposal, to demonstrate that the people supported his plan; most of the other votes were blank, as Lee had not allowed a \"No\" option.<ref name=\"illusion\">Lennox A.

In February 1962, the Malayans insisted on the apprehension of opposition leaders in Singapore and warned that they would pull out from the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Council]] if their requests were ignored.<ref name=\":3\" />Observing that the Malayans were pushing for an arrest programme, Lee Kuan Yew jumped onto the bandwagon in March 1962.<ref name=\":2\" />The arrests were scheduled for 16 December 1962 at 0200 hours but shortly before the scheduled date Lee Kuan Yew expanded the list of arrestees to include Malayan parliamentarians Lim Kean Siew and [[Ahmad Boestaman]] because they were opposed to merger.<ref name=\":2\" /> Lee also wanted the Malayan government to assume joint responsibility for the arrests and even composed a draft public statement for them to present in the federal parliament.<ref name=\":1\" /> Malayan Prime Minister [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] rejected Lee's demands on the grounds that insufficient evidence existed to justify the arrest of the Malayan parliamentarians.<ref name=\":1\" /> In January 1963, the Tunku was alarmed when Lee Kuan Yew continued to expand the arrest list to include \"some members of Marshall's and Ong's parties\" despite \"protestations of Singapore Special Branch.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Nevertheless, on 18 January 1963, the Malayan government agreed on the specifics of the arrests \"except for two matters... the UPP members and the proposal that Lim be offered by Lee the opportunity to leave Singapore after the arrest.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nHowever, Tunku warned [[Geofroy Tory]], the [[List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Malaysia|British High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur]] on 30 January 1963, that 'if this operation failed, merger with Singapore was off'<ref name=\"TanAlvin\" />. Tory, in turn warned everyone else, particularly his British colleagues and especially Lord Selkirk, to put their reservations aside as 'this was positively the last time' <ref name=\"TanAlvin\" />. All parties finally agreed to proceed, and 2 February 1963 was selected for the commencement of Operation Coldstore. 113 were detained including [[Lim Chin Siong]] and 23 others from Barisan Sosialis.\n\n====From merger to separation====\nOn 16 September 1963, Singapore became part of the new Federation of Malaysia. The [[Barisan Sosialis]] was the [[People's Action Party]]'s strongest contenders in politics. However, Operation Coldstore had substantially weakened the Barisan as most of its key personnel had been detained. According to Matthew Jones, \"the Barisan never recovered from the combined effects of the outcome of the referendum result and the 'Cold Store' detentions.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" /> Jones also highlights that numerous Barisan leaders and members were bogged down with lawsuits and its followers were \"demoralised\".<ref name=\":2\" /> In the [[1963 Singaporean general election|1963 election]] held on 21 September, 5 days after the merger, Lee's PAP defeated Barisan Sosialis in a landslide victory.\n\nHowever, the Singapore's union with Malaysia was short-lived. The Malaysian central government, ruled by the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), became worried by the inclusion of Singapore's Chinese majority and the political challenge of the PAP in Malaysia.\n\nThe [[1964 race riots in Singapore]] followed, such as that on 21 July 1964 near Kallang Gasworks in which 23 people were killed and hundreds injured as Chinese and Malays attacked each other. It is still disputed how the riots started, and theories include a bottle being thrown into a Muslim rally by a Chinese, while others have argued that it was started by a Malay. More riots broke out in September 1964, as rioters looted cars and shops, forcing both Tunku Abdul Rahman and Lee to make public appearances to calm the situation.\n\nUnable to resolve the crisis, Tunku Abdul Rahman decided to expel Singapore from Malaysia, choosing to \"sever all ties with a State Government that showed no measure of loyalty to its Central Government\". Lee refused and tried to work out a compromise, but without success. He was later convinced by [[Goh Keng Swee]] that the secession was inevitable.<ref name=\"asias\">Arthur Cotterell (2014).

Lee made his first official visit to Indonesia on 25 May 1973, just a few years after the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]] under [[Sukarno]]'s regime.

For example, Lee warned against \"insensitive evangelisation\", by which he referred to instances of Christian proselytising directed at Malays. In 1974 the government advised the Bible Society of Singapore to stop publishing religious material in Malay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploitz.com/Singapore-Religious-Change-cg.php|title=Public-domain information from the US State Department Country Guide|website=exploitz.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050319013143/http://www.exploitz.com/Singapore-Religious-Change-cg.php|archivedate=19 March 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Decisions and policies===\n\n====National security====\nThe vulnerability of Singapore was deeply felt, with threats from multiple sources including the communists and Indonesia with its confrontational stance. As Singapore gained admission to the United Nations, Lee quickly sought international recognition of Singapore's independence. He appointed [[Goh Keng Swee]] as [[Minister for the Interior and Defence]] to build up the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) and requested help from other countries, particularly [[Israel]] and [[Taiwan (ROC)]], for advice, training and facilities.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lee Kuan yew |title=From Third World to First |year=2000 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=978-0-06-019776-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/14 14\u201315, 20, 25\u201326] |url=https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/14 }}</ref> In 1967, Lee introduced conscription whereby all able-bodied male Singaporean citizens age 18 and above are required to serve National Service (NS) either in the Singapore Armed Forces, [[Singapore Police Force]] or the [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]].

Tourism helped but did not completely resolve the unemployment problem. Together with his economic aide, [[Economic Development Board]] chairman [[Hon Sui Sen]], and in consultation with Dutch economist [[Albert Winsemius]], Lee set up factories and initially focused on the manufacturing industry. Before the British completely withdrew from Singapore in 1971, Lee also persuaded the British not to destroy their dock and had the British naval dockyard later converted for civilian use.\n\nAfter years of trial and error, Lee and his cabinet decided the best way to boost Singapore's economy was to attract foreign investments from [[multinational corporations]] (MNCs). By establishing First World infrastructure and standards in Singapore, the new nation could woo American, Japanese and European entrepreneurs and professionals to set up base there.

However, this reliance has made Singapore subject to the possibility of price increases and allowed Malaysian officials to use the water reliance as political leverage by [[Water conflicts between Malaysia and Singapore|threatening to cut off supply]]. To reduce this problem, Lee decided to experiment with water recycling in 1974.<ref name=\"water\">Tortajada, Cecilia; Joshi, Yugal; Biswas, Asit K.(2013).

Routledge. p. 26.</ref> However, the water treatment plant was closed in 1975 due to cost and reliability issues. In 1998, the Public Utilities Board (PUB) and the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) initiated the Singapore Water Reclamation Study (NEWater Study). The aim was to determine if NEWater was a viable source of raw water for Singapore's needs. In 2001, PUB initiated efforts to increase water supplies for non-potable use. Using NEWater for these would help reduce the demand for the reservoirs for potable water.\n\nThe [[Singapore International Water Week]] was started in 2008; it focused on sustainable water solutions for cities. The Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize was introduced in recognition given to outstanding contributions towards solving the global water crisis. The prize has become an international award given out to individuals and groups worldwide.\n\n===Relations with Malaysia===\n\n====Mahathir Mohamad====\nLee looked forward to improving relationships with [[Mahathir Mohamad]] upon the latter's promotion to Deputy Prime Minister. Knowing that Mahathir was in line to become the next [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], Lee invited Mahathir (through Singapore President [[Devan Nair]]) to visit Singapore in 1978. The first and subsequent visits improved both personal and diplomatic relationships between them. Then [[UMNO]]'s Secretary-General Mahathir asked Lee to cut off all links with [[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|Democratic Action Party]]; in exchange, Mahathir undertook not to interfere in the affairs of [[Malay Singaporeans]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn June 1988, Lee and Mahathir reached an agreement in [[Kuala Lumpur]] to build the Linggui dam on the [[Johor River]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1533_2009-06-23.html|title=Singapore-Malaysia water agreements|author=National Library Board, Singapore|website=nl.sg|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609063811/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1533_2009-06-23.html|archivedate=9 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Lee's death, Mahathir posted a blog post that suggested his respect for Lee despite their differences, stating that while \"I am afraid on most other issues we could not agree [...] [h]is passage marks the end of the period when those who fought for independence lead their countries and knew the value of independence.

Then I have to revive it. It's a terrible problem because learning it in adult life, it hasn't got the same roots in your memory.</blockquote>\n\nIn an interview with [[China Central Television]] (CCTV) on 12 June 2005, Lee stressed the need to have a continuous renewal of talent in the country's leadership, saying:\n<blockquote>In a different world we need to find a niche for ourselves, little corners where in spite of our small size we can perform a role which will be useful to the world. To do that, you will need people at the top, decision-makers who have got foresight, good minds, who are open to ideas, who can seize opportunities like we did. [...] My job really was to find my successors. I found them, they are there; their job is to find their successors. So there must be this continuous renewal of talented, dedicated, honest, able people who will do things not for themselves but for their people and for their country. If they can do that, they will carry on for another one generation and so it goes on.

Michael Barr in his book ''The Ruling Elite of Singapore: Networks of Influence and Power'' claims that the system of meritocracy in Singapore is not quite how the government presents it; rather, it is a system of nepotism and collusion run by Lee's family and their crony friends and allies. Barr claims further that although the government presents the city-state as multi-ethnic and cosmopolitan, all the networks are dominated by ethnic Chinese, leaving the minority Malay and Indian ethnic groups powerless. According to Barr, the entire process of selecting and grooming of future political and economic talent is monopolised in the hands of the ruling People's Action Party, which Lee himself founded with a handful of other British-educated ethnic Chinese that he met in his days at Cambridge.<ref>Barr, M.

He also remarked that Lee is \"an increasingly self-righteous know-all\", surrounded by \"department store dummies\". In response to these remarks, Lee sued Nair in a Canadian court and Nair countersued. Lee then brought a motion to have Nair's counterclaim thrown out of court. Lee argued that Nair's counterclaim disclosed no reasonable cause of action and constituted an inflammatory attack on the integrity of the Singapore government. However, the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]] refused to throw out Nair's counterclaim, holding that Lee had abused the litigating process and therefore Nair had a reasonable cause of action.<ref>''Lee v.

The ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' apologised in March that readers of the article may \"infer that the younger Lee did not achieve his position through merit\".

The case stemmed from a 1994 settlement between the three Singaporean leaders and the paper about an article, also by Bowring, that referred to \"dynastic politics\" in East Asian countries, including Singapore. In that settlement, Bowring agreed not to say or imply that the younger Lee had attained his position through nepotism by his father Lee Kuan Yew.

However, racial strife and ideological differences led to its [[Singapore in Malaysia|separation]] to become a sovereign [[city-state]] two years later. With overwhelming parliamentary control at every election, Lee oversaw Singapore's transformation from a British crown colony with a natural deep harbour to a [[Developed country|developed]] country with a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income]] economy. In the process, he forged a system of [[meritocracy|meritocratic]], highly effective and non-corrupt government and civil service. Many of his policies are now taught at the [[Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy]]. Lee eschewed [[populist]] policies in favour of long-term social and economic planning. He championed [[meritocracy]] and [[multiracialism]] as governing principles, making English the [[common language]] to integrate its immigrant society and to facilitate trade with the West, whilst mandating [[bilingualism]] in schools to preserve students' [[mother tongue]] and ethnic identity.\n\nLee's rule was criticised for curtailing civil liberties (media control and limits on public protests) and bringing libel suits against political opponents.

He described his schoolmates at Telok Kurau as generally poor and not very bright. He then attended [[Raffles Institution (Secondary)|Raffles Institution]] in 1935, where he had difficulties keeping up because he met the top 150 students from all over Singapore. Lee joined the [[Scouting|Scouts]] for three years, played [[cricket]], [[tennis]], and [[chess]], and [[debate]]d for the school. He obtained several scholarships, and came top in the School Certificate examinations in 1940, gaining the John Anderson scholarship to attend [[Raffles College]] (now [[Raffles Institution#Former Raffles Institution (High School)|Raffles Institution Junior College]]). Lee's future wife, [[Kwa Geok Choo]], was his classmate and the only girl at Raffles Institution at that time.

After the war, Lee went on to study in England. He briefly attended [[London School of Economics]] as enrolment at the University of Cambridge had already closed. He related that London overwhelmed him and he sought the more pleasant surroundings of Cambridge, where he read law at [[Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge|Fitzwilliam College]]. A fellow Raffles College student introduced him to the Censor of Fitzwilliam House, W. S. Thatcher, who admitted him for the 1947 Lent term. He matriculated in January 1947.\n\nLee graduated First Class in both parts of the Tripos with an exceptional Starred-First for Part II Law in 1949; this placed him at the very top of his cohort, and he was awarded the Fitzwilliam's Whitlock Prize. The college said he was placed above two contemporaries who later became Professors of Law in Cambridge. Lee was called to the Bar at the Middle Temple in 1950. In 1969, he was elected an honorary fellow of Fitzwilliam College and was the most senior of the College's Honorary Fellows for many years. In 1971, Lee gave the Foundation Lecture \u2013 \"East and West: the twain have met\".<ref name=manandhisideas/>\n\n==Early life==\nLee experienced hardship during the Japanese occupation from 1942 to 1945. During the war, Lee learnt Japanese and first worked as a SAS (Singapore Administration Service) officer in Sentosa islands  where he listened to Allied radio stations and wrote down what they were reporting in the ''Hodobu'' office (\u5831\u9053\u90e8&nbsp;\u2013 a Japanese propaganda department).<ref name = \"Time 1999\">{{cite news |last=McCarthy |first=Terry |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990823/lee1.html |title=Lee Kuan Yew |newspaper=Time Asia |location=Hong Kong |date=23 August 1999 |quote=Lee Kuan Yew towers over other Asian leaders on the international stage ... |access-date=14 August 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040815041902/http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990823/lee1.html |archive-date=15 August 2004 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Towards the end of the war, by listening to Allied radio stations, he realised the Japanese were losing the war, and fearing that a brutal war would break out in Singapore as the Japanese made their last stand, he made plans to purchase and move to a farm on the [[Cameron Highlands]] with his family. However, a lift-boy in his office told him his file had been taken out by the security department, and he realised he was being followed by Japanese security personnel (which continued for three months), so he abandoned those plans as he knew if he went ahead, he would be in trouble.

Lee gained a widespread reputation through the victory of the trial, the first sedition trial in Colonial post-war Malaya. ''The Straits Times'' on 26 August 1954 proclaimed this a \"tremendous victory for freedom of speech\". At the same time, Lee was accepted by most Singaporeans as the \"hero of high\".

He had been expelled by the party after making open disputes with his Cabinet colleagues, including over the abolition of the City Council when he was the last Mayor. Two other PAP members had followed him to join his faction and resigned from the party but did not resign their seats with Ong. Ong stood as an independent and he won the Hong Lim by-election defeating PAP candidate [[Jek Yeun Thong]], which proved a blow to the PAP for the leaders had campaigned non-stop for Jek but Ong was too popular in the Chinese community and so Jek lost the elections.\n\nLater that year another by-election was held after the death of the incumbent PAP member Baharuddin Mohammed Ariff in the constituency of [[Anson Single Member Constituency|Anson]] on 15 July 1961 which saw the political return of former [[Labour Front]] chief minister [[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Marshall]], now [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]] (WP) leader.\n\nTwo days after the Anson result, Lee assumed full responsibility for the two election setbacks and resigned as prime minister to PAP chairman [[Toh Chin Chye]], only for Toh to reject it.\n\nOn 21 July 1961, Lee then moved a [[motion of confidence]] in his own government five days after the Anson by-election. The motion was agreed to with 27 \"Ayes\", 8 \"Noes\" and 16 abstentions. The members who voted \"No\" included David Marshall and members of the [[Singapore People's Alliance]]. 13 allegedly pro-communist PAP members and 3 members of [[Ong Eng Guan]]'s UPP abstained.\n\nLee's view was that the PAP members who did not vote for his motion would be expelled for breaking ranks and pulling support away to Communist opponents and he did so, sacking the 13 abstainers and reducing his assembly majority to 1. Together with six prominent left-leaning leaders from trade unions, the breakaway members established a new party, the [[Barisan Sosialis]]. 35 of 51 branches of the PAP and 19 of 23 branch secretaries defected to Barisan.\n\n===Merger with Malaysia (1963\u20131965)===\n{{main|Singapore in Malaysia}}\n[[File:Singapore during the formation of Malaysia (16 September 1963).jpg|thumb|Lee Kuan Yew declaring the forming of the Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 in Singapore]]\n\n====Lead up to merger====\nIndependence of Singapore from Britain through a merger with the Federation of Malaya had been the PAP's platform since its founding in 1954. The merger was supported both by the non-communists and the communists in the PAP. So when the PAP won a strong mandate in the 1959 General Election, it pursued merger vigorously.\n\nAfter Malaysian Prime Minister [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] proposed the formation of a federation which would include [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], Singapore, [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in 1961, Lee began to campaign for a merger to end British colonial rule. The communists made a startling about-turn and were determined to derail merger, even though they had all along insisted that Malaya and Singapore were one entity. [[Chin Peng]], leader of the [[Malayan Communist Party]] made it clear that it wished to sabotage merger or delay its implementation at that stage.\n\nLee explained in a series of radio broadcasts in 1961 that the communists and [[Barisan Sosialis]] opposed merger because they wanted to establish control over Singapore so they could subsequently subvert and take over Malaya. The radio talks won over public opinion in favour of merger on the terms proposed by Lee's government. Lee would use the results of [[1962 Singaporean national referendum|a referendum held on 1 September 1962]], in which 70% of the votes were cast in support of his merger proposal, to demonstrate that the people supported his plan; most of the other votes were blank, as Lee had not allowed a \"No\" option.<ref name=\"illusion\">Lennox A.

In February 1962, the Malayans insisted on the apprehension of opposition leaders in Singapore and warned that they would pull out from the [[Internal Security Act (Singapore)|Internal Security Council]] if their requests were ignored.<ref name=\":3\" />Observing that the Malayans were pushing for an arrest programme, Lee Kuan Yew jumped onto the bandwagon in March 1962.<ref name=\":2\" />The arrests were scheduled for 16 December 1962 at 0200 hours but shortly before the scheduled date Lee Kuan Yew expanded the list of arrestees to include Malayan parliamentarians Lim Kean Siew and [[Ahmad Boestaman]] because they were opposed to merger.<ref name=\":2\" /> Lee also wanted the Malayan government to assume joint responsibility for the arrests and even composed a draft public statement for them to present in the federal parliament.<ref name=\":1\" /> Malayan Prime Minister [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] rejected Lee's demands on the grounds that insufficient evidence existed to justify the arrest of the Malayan parliamentarians.<ref name=\":1\" /> In January 1963, the Tunku was alarmed when Lee Kuan Yew continued to expand the arrest list to include \"some members of Marshall's and Ong's parties\" despite \"protestations of Singapore Special Branch.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Nevertheless, on 18 January 1963, the Malayan government agreed on the specifics of the arrests \"except for two matters... the UPP members and the proposal that Lim be offered by Lee the opportunity to leave Singapore after the arrest.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nHowever, Tunku warned [[Geofroy Tory]], the [[List of High Commissioners of the United Kingdom to Malaysia|British High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur]] on 30 January 1963, that 'if this operation failed, merger with Singapore was off'<ref name=\"TanAlvin\" />. Tory, in turn warned everyone else, particularly his British colleagues and especially Lord Selkirk, to put their reservations aside as 'this was positively the last time' <ref name=\"TanAlvin\" />. All parties finally agreed to proceed, and 2 February 1963 was selected for the commencement of Operation Coldstore. 113 were detained including [[Lim Chin Siong]] and 23 others from Barisan Sosialis.\n\n====From merger to separation====\nOn 16 September 1963, Singapore became part of the new Federation of Malaysia. The [[Barisan Sosialis]] was the [[People's Action Party]]'s strongest contenders in politics. However, Operation Coldstore had substantially weakened the Barisan as most of its key personnel had been detained. According to Matthew Jones, \"the Barisan never recovered from the combined effects of the outcome of the referendum result and the 'Cold Store' detentions.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" /> Jones also highlights that numerous Barisan leaders and members were bogged down with lawsuits and its followers were \"demoralised\".<ref name=\":2\" /> In the [[1963 Singaporean general election|1963 election]] held on 21 September, 5 days after the merger, Lee's PAP defeated Barisan Sosialis in a landslide victory.\n\nHowever, the Singapore's union with Malaysia was short-lived. The Malaysian central government, ruled by the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), became worried by the inclusion of Singapore's Chinese majority and the political challenge of the PAP in Malaysia.\n\nThe [[1964 race riots in Singapore]] followed, such as that on 21 July 1964 near Kallang Gasworks in which 23 people were killed and hundreds injured as Chinese and Malays attacked each other. It is still disputed how the riots started, and theories include a bottle being thrown into a Muslim rally by a Chinese, while others have argued that it was started by a Malay. More riots broke out in September 1964, as rioters looted cars and shops, forcing both Tunku Abdul Rahman and Lee to make public appearances to calm the situation.\n\nUnable to resolve the crisis, Tunku Abdul Rahman decided to expel Singapore from Malaysia, choosing to \"sever all ties with a State Government that showed no measure of loyalty to its Central Government\". Lee refused and tried to work out a compromise, but without success. He was later convinced by [[Goh Keng Swee]] that the secession was inevitable.<ref name=\"asias\">Arthur Cotterell (2014).

Lee made his first official visit to Indonesia on 25 May 1973, just a few years after the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]] under [[Sukarno]]'s regime.

For example, Lee warned against \"insensitive evangelisation\", by which he referred to instances of Christian proselytising directed at Malays. In 1974 the government advised the Bible Society of Singapore to stop publishing religious material in Malay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exploitz.com/Singapore-Religious-Change-cg.php|title=Public-domain information from the US State Department Country Guide|website=exploitz.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050319013143/http://www.exploitz.com/Singapore-Religious-Change-cg.php|archivedate=19 March 2005}}</ref>\n\n===Decisions and policies===\n\n====National security====\nThe vulnerability of Singapore was deeply felt, with threats from multiple sources including the communists and Indonesia with its confrontational stance. As Singapore gained admission to the United Nations, Lee quickly sought international recognition of Singapore's independence. He appointed [[Goh Keng Swee]] as [[Minister for the Interior and Defence]] to build up the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) and requested help from other countries, particularly [[Israel]] and [[Taiwan (ROC)]], for advice, training and facilities.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lee Kuan yew |title=From Third World to First |year=2000 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=978-0-06-019776-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/14 14\u201315, 20, 25\u201326] |url=https://archive.org/details/fromthirdworldto00leek/page/14 }}</ref> In 1967, Lee introduced conscription whereby all able-bodied male Singaporean citizens age 18 and above are required to serve National Service (NS) either in the Singapore Armed Forces, [[Singapore Police Force]] or the [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]].

Tourism helped but did not completely resolve the unemployment problem. Together with his economic aide, [[Economic Development Board]] chairman [[Hon Sui Sen]], and in consultation with Dutch economist [[Albert Winsemius]], Lee set up factories and initially focused on the manufacturing industry. Before the British completely withdrew from Singapore in 1971, Lee also persuaded the British not to destroy their dock and had the British naval dockyard later converted for civilian use.\n\nAfter years of trial and error, Lee and his cabinet decided the best way to boost Singapore's economy was to attract foreign investments from [[multinational corporations]] (MNCs). By establishing First World infrastructure and standards in Singapore, the new nation could woo American, Japanese and European entrepreneurs and professionals to set up base there. By the 1970s, the arrival of MNCs like [[Texas Instruments]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[General Electric]] laid the foundations, turning Singapore into a major [[electronics]] exporter the following decade.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lee Kuan Yew |title=From Third World to First \u2013 The Singapore Story (1965\u20132000) |year=2000 |publisher=Times Edition |isbn=978-9812049841 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/singaporestoryme00leek/page/80 80\u201381] |url=https://archive.org/details/singaporestoryme00leek/page/80 }}</ref> Workers were frequently retrained to familiarise themselves with the work systems and cultures of foreign MNCs.

However, this reliance has made Singapore subject to the possibility of price increases and allowed Malaysian officials to use the water reliance as political leverage by [[Water conflicts between Malaysia and Singapore|threatening to cut off supply]]. To reduce this problem, Lee decided to experiment with water recycling in 1974.<ref name=\"water\">Tortajada, Cecilia; Joshi, Yugal; Biswas, Asit K.(2013).

Routledge. p. 26.</ref> However, the water treatment plant was closed in 1975 due to cost and reliability issues. In 1998, the Public Utilities Board (PUB) and the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources (MEWR) initiated the Singapore Water Reclamation Study (NEWater Study). The aim was to determine if NEWater was a viable source of raw water for Singapore's needs. In 2001, PUB initiated efforts to increase water supplies for non-potable use. Using NEWater for these would help reduce the demand for the reservoirs for potable water.\n\nThe [[Singapore International Water Week]] was started in 2008; it focused on sustainable water solutions for cities. The Lee Kuan Yew Water Prize was introduced in recognition given to outstanding contributions towards solving the global water crisis. The prize has become an international award given out to individuals and groups worldwide.\n\n===Relations with Malaysia===\n\n====Mahathir Mohamad====\nLee looked forward to improving relationships with [[Mahathir Mohamad]] upon the latter's promotion to Deputy Prime Minister. Knowing that Mahathir was in line to become the next [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], Lee invited Mahathir (through Singapore President [[Devan Nair]]) to visit Singapore in 1978. The first and subsequent visits improved both personal and diplomatic relationships between them. Then [[UMNO]]'s Secretary-General Mahathir asked Lee to cut off all links with [[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|Democratic Action Party]]; in exchange, Mahathir undertook not to interfere in the affairs of [[Malay Singaporeans]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn June 1988, Lee and Mahathir reached an agreement in [[Kuala Lumpur]] to build the Linggui dam on the [[Johor River]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1533_2009-06-23.html|title=Singapore-Malaysia water agreements|author=National Library Board, Singapore|website=nl.sg|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609063811/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_1533_2009-06-23.html|archivedate=9 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Lee's death, Mahathir posted a blog post that suggested his respect for Lee despite their differences, stating that while \"I am afraid on most other issues we could not agree [...] [h]is passage marks the end of the period when those who fought for independence lead their countries and knew the value of independence.

In one of his parliamentary speeches, he said: \"Singaporeans must learn to juggle English and Mandarin\". Subsequently, in December 2004, Lee stepped down to another level, becoming a minister mentor and a year-long campaign called \"{{lang|zh-Hans|\u534e\u8bed Cool!}}\" (Huayu Cool!) was launched, in an attempt to attract young viewers to learn and speak Mandarin.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.zaobao.com/chinese/pages1/chinese_sg071204.html |script-title=zh:\u534e\u8bed Cool! |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212155239/http://www.zaobao.com/chinese/pages1/chinese_sg071204.html |archivedate=12 December 2009 |work=[[Zaobao]] |date=7 December 2004 |language=zh-sg}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2005, Lee published a book, ''Keeping My Mandarin Alive'', documenting his decades of effort to master Mandarin, a language that he said he had to re-learn due to disuse:\n<blockquote>[B]ecause I don't use it so much, therefore it gets disused and there's language loss. Then I have to revive it. It's a terrible problem because learning it in adult life, it hasn't got the same roots in your memory.</blockquote>\n\nIn an interview with [[China Central Television]] (CCTV) on 12 June 2005, Lee stressed the need to have a continuous renewal of talent in the country's leadership, saying:\n<blockquote>In a different world we need to find a niche for ourselves, little corners where in spite of our small size we can perform a role which will be useful to the world. To do that, you will need people at the top, decision-makers who have got foresight, good minds, who are open to ideas, who can seize opportunities like we did. [...] My job really was to find my successors. I found them, they are there; their job is to find their successors. So there must be this continuous renewal of talented, dedicated, honest, able people who will do things not for themselves but for their people and for their country. If they can do that, they will carry on for another one generation and so it goes on. The moment that breaks, it's gone.</blockquote>\n\nOn 13 September 2008, Lee underwent successful treatment for abnormal heart rhythm ([[atrial flutter]]) at [[Singapore General Hospital]], but he was still able to address a philanthropy forum via video link from hospital.<ref>{{cite news |title=Singapore's Lee Kwan Yew hospitalized |newspaper=International Herald Tribune |location=Paris |date=13 September 2008}}</ref> On 28 September 2010, he was hospitalised for a chest infection, cancelling plans to attend the wake of the Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, [[Balaji Sadasivan]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=MM treated for chest infection |newspaper=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=29 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2010, Lee's private conversations with [[James Steinberg]], US [[Deputy Secretary of State]], on 30 May 2009 were among the [[United States diplomatic cables leak|US Embassy cables leaked]] by [[WikiLeaks]].

Chen referred to a controversial play about Singaporean porn actress [[Annabel Chong]] which explored pornography and alternative sexuality. Lee was then asked if he believed homosexuality was a product of nature or nurture.

Michael Barr in his book ''The Ruling Elite of Singapore: Networks of Influence and Power'' claims that the system of meritocracy in Singapore is not quite how the government presents it; rather, it is a system of nepotism and collusion run by Lee's family and their crony friends and allies. Barr claims further that although the government presents the city-state as multi-ethnic and cosmopolitan, all the networks are dominated by ethnic Chinese, leaving the minority Malay and Indian ethnic groups powerless. According to Barr, the entire process of selecting and grooming of future political and economic talent is monopolised in the hands of the ruling People's Action Party, which Lee himself founded with a handful of other British-educated ethnic Chinese that he met in his days at Cambridge.<ref>Barr, M.

He also remarked that Lee is \"an increasingly self-righteous know-all\", surrounded by \"department store dummies\". In response to these remarks, Lee sued Nair in a Canadian court and Nair countersued. Lee then brought a motion to have Nair's counterclaim thrown out of court. Lee argued that Nair's counterclaim disclosed no reasonable cause of action and constituted an inflammatory attack on the integrity of the Singapore government. However, the [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice]] refused to throw out Nair's counterclaim, holding that Lee had abused the litigating process and therefore Nair had a reasonable cause of action.<ref>''Lee v. Globe and Mail'' (2001), 6 C.P.C.

The ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' apologised in March that readers of the article may \"infer that the younger Lee did not achieve his position through merit\". The New York Times Company and Bowring also agreed to pay S$60,000 to Lee Hsien Loong, S$50,000 to Lee and S$50,000 to Goh (totalling about US$114,000 at the time), in addition to legal costs. The case stemmed from a 1994 settlement between the three Singaporean leaders and the paper about an article, also by Bowring, that referred to \"dynastic politics\" in East Asian countries, including Singapore. In that settlement, Bowring agreed not to say or imply that the younger Lee had attained his position through nepotism by his father Lee Kuan Yew.

One of the most persistent was originally chartered in 1868 as the Hudson Highland Suspension Bridge Company, whose proposed bridge would have crossed from [[Anthony's Nose (Westchester)|Anthony's Nose]] to [[Fort Clinton]], now roughly the site of the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]]. It was never built.\n\nThe Poughkeepsie Bridge Company was chartered in June 1871 to build the bridge, and [[J. Edgar Thomson]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] was persuaded to support the effort. Contracts were let to a firm called the American Bridge Company (not the [[American Bridge Company|company of the same name]] founded later), but the [[Panic of 1873]] intervened and the scheme collapsed.\n\nIn 1886, the Manhattan Bridge Building Company was organized to finance the construction. Among the prominent backers was [[Henry Clay Frick]], the coal tycoon and associate of [[Andrew Carnegie]]. The [[Union Bridge Company]] of [[Athens, Pennsylvania]], which had completed the [[Michigan Central Railway|Michigan Central]] cantilever bridge at Niagara (see [[Niagara Cantilever Bridge]]), was subcontracted to build the Poughkeepsie Bridge. Dawson, Symmes and Usher were the foundation engineers, while John F. O'Rourke, P. P. Dickinson and Arthur B. Paine were the structural engineers. The bridge was designed by [[Charles Macdonald (architect)|Charles Macdonald]] and Arthur B. Paine. As is typical for cantilever bridges, construction was carried out by constructing cribwork, masonry piers, towers, fixed truss sections on falsework, and finally cantilever sections, with the final cantilever interconnection (suspended) spans floated out or raised with [[falsework]]. The first train crossed the bridge on December 29, 1888, and it was formally opened for scheduled passenger service on January 1, 1889.\n\nConsidered an engineering marvel of the day, the bridge has seven main spans. The total length is {{convert|6,768|ft|m}}, including approaches, and the top of the deck is {{convert|212|ft|m}} above water. It is a multispan cantilever truss bridge, having two river-crossing cantilever spans of {{convert|548|ft|m}} each, one center span of {{convert|546|ft|m}}, two anchor (connecting) spans of {{convert|525|ft|m}}, two shore spans of {{convert|201|ft|m}} each, a {{convert|2,641|ft|m}} approach viaduct on the eastern bank and a {{convert|1,033|ft|m}} approach viaduct on the western bank. All seven spans were built of newly available Bessemer Process \"mild\" (between 0.16% and 0.29% carbon) steel, while the two approach viaducts were built of iron. It formed part of the most direct rail route between the industrial northeastern states and the midwestern and western states.<ref>POUGHKEEPSIE EAGLE Souvenir Edition dated January 1, 1889; plus independent engineering articles from the period.</ref>\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:Detroit Photographic Company (0676).jpg|thumb|left|Poughkeepsie Bridge ca. 1900]]\n[[File:Under the Bridge, Poughkeepsie, N.

Traffic from the connecting [[New York, Ontario & Western]] ceased when that railroad shut down on March 30, 1957. Another connection, the coal-, slate-, and cement-hauling [[Lehigh & New England]], shut down in 1961. At the same time, some new traffic began crossing the bridge, such as the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven's]] \"Super Jet\", one of the first trains to carry truck trailers. The [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]]'s acquisition of the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven]] in 1969 discouraged connecting traffic with the [[Erie Lackawanna]], which competed with other Penn Central routes. After 1971, only one through train in each direction, for [[Erie Lackawanna]], crossed the bridge.<ref name=swanberg>{{Citation | last = Swanberg | first = J.W. | title = Railroad Blueprint: Maybrook, New York| journal = Trains Magazine |date=January 2005 | pages = 50\u201359}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Penn Central did not connect with the old New Haven on the west side of the bridge, it came close. For a short time in 1969 and 1970, Penn Central ran a daily train between [[Cedar Hill Yard]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and [[Potomac Yard]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], by way of the [[Lehigh and Hudson River Railway]], which connected with the [[Penn Central]] [[Belvidere Delaware Railroad|Belvidere Division]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], 72 miles south of the old interchange with the New Haven at [[Maybrook Yard]] in [[Maybrook, New York]]. The service ended in a dispute over haulage charges and the traffic was diverted to the longer all-Penn Central route through [[Selkirk, New York]]. Ironically, the only reason the [[Lehigh and Hudson River]] was not part of the Penn Central was because a Penn Central predecessor, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], had prevented the New Haven from acquiring it in 1905.<ref name=swanberg/> The [[Lehigh and Hudson River]] and Erie Lackawanna were finally joined with the Penn Central when all were taken over by [[Conrail]] in 1976.\n\nOn May 8, 1974, a [[Railroad tie|tie]] fire damaged about {{convert|700|ft|m}} of decking and underlying girders on the bridge's eastern section.<ref>{{cite news | last = Cruz | first = Roberto | title = Railroad bridge fire 40th anniversary: Fire in the sky | newspaper = The Poughkeepsie Journal | date = May 7, 2014 | url = http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/local/2014/05/07/poughkeepsie-railroad-fire-anniversary/8831573/ | accessdate =  January 2, 2015}}</ref> It was likely started by a spark from an eastbound freight train that had just crossed the span.<ref>{{Citation | last  = Sutherland | first = Joseph | title = Fire Closes Rail Bridge 3 Months | newspaper = The Evening News | location = Newburgh, NY | date = May 9, 1974 | page = 1 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R1VRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4DMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1613%2C1667620 }}</ref> The Penn Central had neglected the bridge's fire-protection system, which had no water on the day of the fire, and had laid off employees who kept watch for such fires.<ref name=mabee /> A photograph of the last train, a run-through from the [[Erie Lackawanna]], was included in a 40th anniversary web feature by the [[Poughkeepsie Journal]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Cusumano | first = Chris | title = INTERACTIVE: How the Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge fire changed history | newspaper = The Poughkeepsie Journal | date = May 7, 2014 | url = http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/longform/news/2014/05/07/bridgefire/8725801/ | accessdate = January 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1974, the Penn Central applied for $1.75 million to repair and improve the bridge from the federal government through the [[Regional Rail Reorganization Act]] of 1973.<ref>{{Citation | title = Fate of Poughkeepsie Rail Bridge Up to Court | newspaper = The Evening News | location = Newburgh, NY | date = August 30, 1974  | page = 4A | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IlRRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rTMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=987%2C5261610 }}</ref> By 1975, efforts had shifted to acquiring a combination of state and railroad funding.

(of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and [[Albany, New York]]), project engineers and managers, has stated in writing that the wind loads were carefully examined for the replacement, solid-concrete Walkway decking, and that this item is not a safety problem.<ref>Email from Peter Melewski, Bergmann Associates, P.C. Project Manager (Albany, New York office), to Donald L. Pevsner, dated December 4, 2009: in possession of the Walkway Group.</ref> The decking work was completed on September 5, 2009.  Walkway opened the bridge to the public on October 3, 2009, in time for the quadricentennial celebration of [[Henry Hudson]] sailing up the [[Hudson River]], and that day handed it over to the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]] for management. Despite this, inevitable comparisons have been drawn to the similar [[Kinzua Bridge]], in northwestern Pennsylvania, which blew over in a [[microburst]] tornado when the bolts connecting the steel framework to the piers failed. Ironically, renovation work was going on to strengthen the corroded areas when the tornado destroyed most of this former Erie Railroad viaduct. During [[Hurricane Irene]], residents living within 500 feet of the Poughkeepsie Bridge were evacuated as a precaution, and emergency repairs to reduce bridge sway (by the addition of new steel X-braces, supplanting the original turnbuckle-adjusted tension rods) were hurriedly installed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe bridge became a [[National Recreation Trail]] in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.americantrails.org/nationalrecreationtrails/09NRTapps.html |title=2009 National Recreation Trail designations |accessdate=January 1, 2011 |publisher=[[National Trails System]]}}</ref>\n\n==Walkway over the Hudson State Historic Park==\n[[File:Walkway Over the Hudson 4.JPG|thumb|left|The walkway shortly after its opening]]\nThe opening ceremony of the Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park, on October 3, 2009, featured music by [[Pete Seeger]], and was attended by Governor [[David Paterson]], Senator [[Chuck Schumer]], Congressman [[Maurice Hinchey]], president of nearby [[Vassar College]] [[Catharine Bond Hill]],<ref>{{cite news| title = Poughkeepsie unveils historic Walkway Over Hudson| newspaper = [[Miscellany News]]| location = [[Poughkeepsie, New York]]| date = October 7, 2009| url = http://www.miscellanynews.com/poughkeepsie-unveils-historic-walkway-over-hudson-1.1943475| accessdate = December 22, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091011035312/http://www.miscellanynews.com/poughkeepsie-unveils-historic-walkway-over-hudson-1.1943475| archive-date = October 11, 2009| url-status = dead}}</ref> John May, engineer of the last train across the bridge, and other officials.

It is also part of the [[Empire State Trail]].\n\n===New additions===\nOn May 22, 2013, the Walkway Over the Hudson organization opened a new east pavilion, built entirely through donations of money and services.

This allows visitors to reach the center of the span via a more direct route.  It also connects the walkway to the Poughkeepsie waterfront area, which is near the railroad station, [[Mid-Hudson Children's Museum]], and Waryas Park.\n\nOn June 29, 2018, the $5.4 million, 3,500-square-foot Ulster Welcome Center at the western gateway officially opened. The facility has a plaza and amphitheater, 1,400 square foot covered patio and concession stand and public restrooms.\n\nOn June 20, 2019, the $3 million Dutchess Welcome Center at the eastern end of the park was dedicated and opened to the public. The 1,800 square-foot facility features restrooms, bike racks, tourist information, an outdoor patio with benches and a water fountain for dogs. Dual entrances are off Washington Street and Orchard Place.\n\nA new glassed-in elevator, opened on June 20, 2019, that takes visitors to the Walkway from '''Upper Landing Park''' has been rebuilt with new \"energy chain\" technology which will make operations more reliable.\n\n===Events and incidents===\nThe first footrace on the walkway occurred the day after the official opening on October 4, 2009. The 5k race started on the Highland side, crossed to the Poughkeepsie side and turned around at the parking lot and finished back in Highland. The race was won by James Boeding in a time of 16:26. The female winner was Kira DeCaprio in 20:12.

One of the most persistent was originally chartered in 1868 as the Hudson Highland Suspension Bridge Company, whose proposed bridge would have crossed from [[Anthony's Nose (Westchester)|Anthony's Nose]] to [[Fort Clinton]], now roughly the site of the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]]. It was never built.\n\nThe Poughkeepsie Bridge Company was chartered in June 1871 to build the bridge, and [[J. Edgar Thomson]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] was persuaded to support the effort. Contracts were let to a firm called the American Bridge Company (not the [[American Bridge Company|company of the same name]] founded later), but the [[Panic of 1873]] intervened and the scheme collapsed.\n\nIn 1886, the Manhattan Bridge Building Company was organized to finance the construction. Among the prominent backers was [[Henry Clay Frick]], the coal tycoon and associate of [[Andrew Carnegie]]. The [[Union Bridge Company]] of [[Athens, Pennsylvania]], which had completed the [[Michigan Central Railway|Michigan Central]] cantilever bridge at Niagara (see [[Niagara Cantilever Bridge]]), was subcontracted to build the Poughkeepsie Bridge. Dawson, Symmes and Usher were the foundation engineers, while John F. O'Rourke, P. P. Dickinson and Arthur B. Paine were the structural engineers. The bridge was designed by [[Charles Macdonald (architect)|Charles Macdonald]] and Arthur B. Paine. As is typical for cantilever bridges, construction was carried out by constructing cribwork, masonry piers, towers, fixed truss sections on falsework, and finally cantilever sections, with the final cantilever interconnection (suspended) spans floated out or raised with [[falsework]]. The first train crossed the bridge on December 29, 1888, and it was formally opened for scheduled passenger service on January 1, 1889.\n\nConsidered an engineering marvel of the day, the bridge has seven main spans. The total length is {{convert|6,768|ft|m}}, including approaches, and the top of the deck is {{convert|212|ft|m}} above water. It is a multispan cantilever truss bridge, having two river-crossing cantilever spans of {{convert|548|ft|m}} each, one center span of {{convert|546|ft|m}}, two anchor (connecting) spans of {{convert|525|ft|m}}, two shore spans of {{convert|201|ft|m}} each, a {{convert|2,641|ft|m}} approach viaduct on the eastern bank and a {{convert|1,033|ft|m}} approach viaduct on the western bank. All seven spans were built of newly available Bessemer Process \"mild\" (between 0.16% and 0.29% carbon) steel, while the two approach viaducts were built of iron. It formed part of the most direct rail route between the industrial northeastern states and the midwestern and western states.<ref>POUGHKEEPSIE EAGLE Souvenir Edition dated January 1, 1889; plus independent engineering articles from the period.</ref>\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:Detroit Photographic Company (0676).jpg|thumb|left|Poughkeepsie Bridge ca. 1900]]\n[[File:Under the Bridge, Poughkeepsie, N.

Traffic from the connecting [[New York, Ontario & Western]] ceased when that railroad shut down on March 30, 1957. Another connection, the coal-, slate-, and cement-hauling [[Lehigh & New England]], shut down in 1961. At the same time, some new traffic began crossing the bridge, such as the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven's]] \"Super Jet\", one of the first trains to carry truck trailers. The [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]]'s acquisition of the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven]] in 1969 discouraged connecting traffic with the [[Erie Lackawanna]], which competed with other Penn Central routes. After 1971, only one through train in each direction, for [[Erie Lackawanna]], crossed the bridge.<ref name=swanberg>{{Citation | last = Swanberg | first = J.W. | title = Railroad Blueprint: Maybrook, New York| journal = Trains Magazine |date=January 2005 | pages = 50\u201359}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Penn Central did not connect with the old New Haven on the west side of the bridge, it came close. For a short time in 1969 and 1970, Penn Central ran a daily train between [[Cedar Hill Yard]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and [[Potomac Yard]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], by way of the [[Lehigh and Hudson River Railway]], which connected with the [[Penn Central]] [[Belvidere Delaware Railroad|Belvidere Division]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], 72 miles south of the old interchange with the New Haven at [[Maybrook Yard]] in [[Maybrook, New York]]. The service ended in a dispute over haulage charges and the traffic was diverted to the longer all-Penn Central route through [[Selkirk, New York]]. Ironically, the only reason the [[Lehigh and Hudson River]] was not part of the Penn Central was because a Penn Central predecessor, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], had prevented the New Haven from acquiring it in 1905.<ref name=swanberg/> The [[Lehigh and Hudson River]] and Erie Lackawanna were finally joined with the Penn Central when all were taken over by [[Conrail]] in 1976.\n\nOn May 8, 1974, a [[Railroad tie|tie]] fire damaged about {{convert|700|ft|m}} of decking and underlying girders on the bridge's eastern section.<ref>{{cite news | last = Cruz | first = Roberto | title = Railroad bridge fire 40th anniversary: Fire in the sky | newspaper = The Poughkeepsie Journal | date = May 7, 2014 | url = http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/local/2014/05/07/poughkeepsie-railroad-fire-anniversary/8831573/ | accessdate =  January 2, 2015}}</ref> It was likely started by a spark from an eastbound freight train that had just crossed the span.<ref>{{Citation | last  = Sutherland | first = Joseph | title = Fire Closes Rail Bridge 3 Months | newspaper = The Evening News | location = Newburgh, NY | date = May 9, 1974 | page = 1 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R1VRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4DMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1613%2C1667620 }}</ref> The Penn Central had neglected the bridge's fire-protection system, which had no water on the day of the fire, and had laid off employees who kept watch for such fires.<ref name=mabee /> A photograph of the last train, a run-through from the [[Erie Lackawanna]], was included in a 40th anniversary web feature by the [[Poughkeepsie Journal]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Cusumano | first = Chris | title = INTERACTIVE: How the Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge fire changed history | newspaper = The Poughkeepsie Journal | date = May 7, 2014 | url = http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/longform/news/2014/05/07/bridgefire/8725801/ | accessdate = January 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1974, the Penn Central applied for $1.75 million to repair and improve the bridge from the federal government through the [[Regional Rail Reorganization Act]] of 1973.<ref>{{Citation | title = Fate of Poughkeepsie Rail Bridge Up to Court | newspaper = The Evening News | location = Newburgh, NY | date = August 30, 1974  | page = 4A | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IlRRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rTMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=987%2C5261610 }}</ref> By 1975, efforts had shifted to acquiring a combination of state and railroad funding.

Walkway opened the bridge to the public on October 3, 2009, in time for the quadricentennial celebration of [[Henry Hudson]] sailing up the [[Hudson River]], and that day handed it over to the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]] for management. Despite this, inevitable comparisons have been drawn to the similar [[Kinzua Bridge]], in northwestern Pennsylvania, which blew over in a [[microburst]] tornado when the bolts connecting the steel framework to the piers failed. Ironically, renovation work was going on to strengthen the corroded areas when the tornado destroyed most of this former Erie Railroad viaduct. During [[Hurricane Irene]], residents living within 500 feet of the Poughkeepsie Bridge were evacuated as a precaution, and emergency repairs to reduce bridge sway (by the addition of new steel X-braces, supplanting the original turnbuckle-adjusted tension rods) were hurriedly installed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nThe bridge became a [[National Recreation Trail]] in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.americantrails.org/nationalrecreationtrails/09NRTapps.html |title=2009 National Recreation Trail designations |accessdate=January 1, 2011 |publisher=[[National Trails System]]}}</ref>\n\n==Walkway over the Hudson State Historic Park==\n[[File:Walkway Over the Hudson 4.JPG|thumb|left|The walkway shortly after its opening]]\nThe opening ceremony of the Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park, on October 3, 2009, featured music by [[Pete Seeger]], and was attended by Governor [[David Paterson]], Senator [[Chuck Schumer]], Congressman [[Maurice Hinchey]], president of nearby [[Vassar College]] [[Catharine Bond Hill]],<ref>{{cite news| title = Poughkeepsie unveils historic Walkway Over Hudson| newspaper = [[Miscellany News]]| location = [[Poughkeepsie, New York]]| date = October 7, 2009| url = http://www.miscellanynews.com/poughkeepsie-unveils-historic-walkway-over-hudson-1.1943475| accessdate = December 22, 2009| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091011035312/http://www.miscellanynews.com/poughkeepsie-unveils-historic-walkway-over-hudson-1.1943475| archive-date = October 11, 2009| url-status = dead}}</ref> John May, engineer of the last train across the bridge, and other officials.

The facility has a plaza and amphitheater, 1,400 square foot covered patio and concession stand and public restrooms.\n\nOn June 20, 2019, the $3 million Dutchess Welcome Center at the eastern end of the park was dedicated and opened to the public. The 1,800 square-foot facility features restrooms, bike racks, tourist information, an outdoor patio with benches and a water fountain for dogs.

Despite some positive critical notice\u2014notably by [[Anthony Boucher]] in ''[[The New York Times]]''\u2014he was little-recognized in his lifetime. Only after death did Thompson's literary stature grow. In the late 1980s, several of his novels were re-published in the ''[[Black Lizard (publisher)|Black Lizard]]'' series of re-discovered crime fiction.\n\nHis best-regarded works include ''[[The Killer Inside Me]]'', ''[[Savage Night]]'', ''[[A Hell of a Woman]]'' and ''[[Pop. 1280]].'' In these works, Thompson turned the derided crime genre into literature and art, featuring [[unreliable narrator]]s, odd structure, and the quasi-surrealistic inner narratives of the last thoughts of his dying or dead characters. A number of Thompson's books were adapted as popular films, including ''[[The Getaway (novel)|The Getaway]]'' and ''[[The Grifters (novel)|The Grifters]]''.\n\nThe writer [[Ronald Verlin Cassill|R.V. Cassill]] has suggested that of all crime fiction, Thompson's was the rawest and most harrowing; that neither [[Dashiell Hammett]] nor [[Raymond Chandler]] nor [[Horace McCoy]], author of the bleak ''[[They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (novel)|They Shoot Horses, Don't They?]],'' ever \"wrote a book within miles of Thompson\".<ref name=polito373>{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Polito|title=Savage Art: A Biography of Jim Thompson|url=https://archive.org/details/savageartbiograp00poli|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]]|date=1995}}</ref> Similarly, in the introduction to ''[[Now and on Earth]]'', [[Stephen King]] says he most admires Thompson's work because \"The guy was over the top. ''The guy was absolutely over the top.'' Big Jim didn't know the meaning of the word ''stop''. There are three brave lets inherent in the foregoing: he let himself see everything, he let himself write it down, then he let himself publish it.\"<ref name= king>King, Stephen; \"Big Jim Thompson: An Appreciation\" pp vii\u2013x in Jim Thompson's ''Now And On Earth'', Vintage Crime/Black Lizard, New York (1994 trade paperback edition; {{ISBN|0-679-74013-9}}. The emphasis is his.)</ref>\n\nThompson was called a \"Dimestore Dostoevsky\" by writer [[Geoffrey O'Brien]]. Film director [[Stephen Frears]], who directed an adaptation of Thompson's ''The Grifters'' as [[1990 in film|1990]]'s ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'', also identified elements of [[Greek tragedy]] in his themes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">From an interview in the 1998 North American DVD version of ''The Grifters'' film.</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\nThompson's life was nearly as colorful as his fiction. His novels were considered semi-autobiographical, or, at least, inspired by his experiences. Thompson's father was [[sheriff]] of [[Caddo County]], Oklahoma. He ran for the state legislature in 1906, but was defeated. Soon after he left the sheriff's office under a cloud due to rumors of [[embezzlement]]. The Thompson family moved to Texas. (The theme of a once-prominent family overtaken by ill-fortune was featured in some of Thompson's works.)\n\n===Early work===\nThompson was born in [[Anadarko, Oklahoma|Anadarko]], [[Oklahoma Territory]], and began writing early: he published a few short pieces while still in his mid-teens. He was intelligent and well-read, but had little interest in or inclination towards formal education. For about two years during [[prohibition]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], Thompson worked long and often wild nights as a bellboy while attending school in the day. He worked at the [[Hotel Texas]]. One biographical profile reports that \"Thompson quickly adapted to the needs of the hotel's guests, busily catering to tastes ranging from questionable morality to directly and undeniably illegal.\" [[Bootleg liquor]] was ubiquitous, and Thompson's brief trips to procure heroin and [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] for hotel patrons were not uncommon.<ref>{{cite web|website=popsubculture.com|url=http://www.popsubculture.com/pop/bio_project/jim_thompson.html|title=Jim Thompson}}</ref> He was soon earning up to $300 per week more than his official $15 monthly wage.\n\nHe smoked and drank heavily, and at nineteen he suffered a [[nervous breakdown]]. In 1926, Thompson began working as an [[petroleum|oil]] field laborer. In the oil fields he met [[Harry McClintock]], a musician, as well as a member and organizer for [[Industrial Workers of the World]], who recruited him into the union.<ref>{{cite web|last=Burnett|first=Jay|title=Things Are Not As They Seem|url=http://www.pennilesspress.co.uk/prose/things_are_not_as_they_seem.htm|publisher=The Penniless Press On-Line|accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> With his father he began an independent oil drilling operation that was ultimately unsuccessful. Thompson returned to Fort Worth, intending to attend school and to write professionally.\n\nThompson's autobiographical \"Oil Field Vignettes\" was published in 1929 (found in March 2010 by history recovery specialist Lee Roy Chapman). He began attending the [[University of Nebraska]] the same year as part of a program for gifted students with \"untraditional educational backgrounds.\" By 1931, however, he had dropped out of school.\n\nFor several years Thompson occasionally wrote short stories for various [[true crime]] magazines. Generally, he would write about murder cases about which he had read in newspapers, but using a first person voice. In this era, he wrote other pieces for various newspapers and magazines, usually as a freelancer, but occasionally as a full-time staff writer. His 1936 \"Ditch of Doom,\" published in ''Master Detective'' Magazine, was selected by the [[Library of America]] in the early 21st century for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime writing.\n\nIn the early 1930s, Thompson worked as the head of the Oklahoma [[Federal Writers Project]], one of several [[New Deal]] programs intended to provide work for Americans during the [[Great Depression]]. [[Louis L'Amour]], among others, worked under Thompson's direction in this project. Thompson joined the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] in 1935 but left the group by 1938.\n\n===First novels===\nIn the early stages of [[World War II]], Thompson worked at an aircraft factory. He was investigated by the [[FBI]] because of his early Communist Party affiliation. These events were fodder for his semi-autobiographical debut novel, ''Now And On Earth'' (1942). It established his bleak, pessimistic tone, and it was positively reviewed but sold poorly. It featured little of the violence and crime that later permeated his writing. In his second novel, ''Heed The Thunder'' (1946), Thompson centered it on crime. It explores a warped and violent [[Nebraska]] family, partly modeled on his own extended clan.\n\nGaining little attention, Thompson gravitated to the less-prestigious but more lucrative crime fiction genre with ''[[Nothing More Than Murder]].'' He afterwards moved to Lion Books, a small paperback publisher. Lion's [[Arnold Hano]] was his ideal editor, offering the writer essentially free rein about content, yet expecting him to be productive and reliable. Lion published most of Thompson's best-regarded works.\n\nTo support his family while writing novels, Thompson took a job as a reporter with the ''Los Angeles Mirror'', a tabloid newspaper owned by the [[Los Angeles Times]], shortly after the ''Mirror'' was founded in 1948. He wrote for the ''Mirror'' until 1949.\n\n===Fifties maturity and ''The Killer Inside Me''===\n[[File:KillerInsideMe.jpg|thumb|140px|''The Killer Inside Me'']]\nIn 1952, Thompson published ''[[The Killer Inside Me]]''. The narrator, Lou Ford, is a small-town deputy sheriff who appears amiable, pleasant and slightly dull-minded. Ford is actually very intelligent and fighting a nearly-constant urge to act violently; Ford describes his urge as ''the sickness'' (always italicised). Lion Books tried to have ''The Killer Inside Me'' nominated for a [[National Book Award]]. It was eponymously adapted for the cinema in 1976 (by director [[Burt Kennedy]], with [[Stacy Keach]] as Lou Ford) and [[The Killer Inside Me (2010 film)|again in 2010]] (by director [[Michael Winterbottom]], with [[Casey Affleck]] as Ford and co-starring [[Kate Hudson]] and [[Jessica Alba]]). After ''The Killer Inside Me'' was published, Thompson began producing novels at a furious pace. He published another novel in 1952, then five novels a year in 1953 and 1954.\n\n''[[Savage Night]],'' published in 1953, is generally ranked as one of his best novels. It is also one of his oddest literary offerings. Its narrator, Charlie \"Little\" Bigger (also known as Carl Bigelow), is a small, [[tuberculosis|tubercular]] [[hitman]] whose mind is deteriorating with his body. In reviewing ''Savage Night'', Boucher said it was \"written with vigor and bite, but sheering off from [[Realism (arts)|realism]] into a peculiar [[surrealist]] ending of sheer [[Grand Guignol|Guignol]] horror. Odd that a mass-consumption paperback should contain the most experimental writing I've seen in a suspense novel of late\".<ref name= polito373/> ''Savage Night'' contains an interlude\u2014whether or not it is fantasy or dream, hallucination or flashback is unclear\u2014when Bigger meets a poor, verbose writer who, much like Thompson, has a penchant for booze and makes a living writing pulp fiction to be sold alongside pornography. The writer also claims to operate a \"farm\" where he grows vaginas as a metaphor for the material he writes.\n\n===Later novels, television work and novelizations===\nAfter his film work, Thompson remained in California for the rest of his life. From the mid-1950s through the late 1960s, Thompson continued to write fiction, although not at the same torrid pace of 1952 to 1954. During this era, Thompson usually completed one novel a year, but he gradually drifted away from writing his increasingly unpopular novels, abandoning the medium completely by the end of the 1960s. In 1967, he published ''South of Heaven'', about a young migrant laborer working on an oil pipeline in Texas.\n\nWith his novels providing scant income, Thompson turned to other forms of writing to pay the bills. Beginning in 1959, and continuing through the mid-1960s, Thompson also began writing television programs, including episodes of the action/adventure shows ''[[Mackenzie's Raiders]]'' (1959), ''[[Cain's Hundred]]'' (1961) and ''[[Convoy (TV series)|Convoy]]'' (1965). TV work seemingly dried up for Thompson after this point, so he turned to writing tie-in novels based on produced TV shows and screenplays: this work paid a flat fee, and could be completed quickly. Thompson's tie-ins include an original novel based on the television series ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'' (1967), as well as screenplay novelizations of the films ''[[The Undefeated (1969 film)|The Undefeated]]'' (1969) and ''[[Nothing But a Man]]'' (1970).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/jthompso.htm |title=Jim Thompson |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030416021954/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/jthompso.htm |archivedate=April 16, 2003 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s, Thompson wrote his two final original books, ''King Blood'' and ''Child of Rage'' (its provisional title was ''White Mother, Black Son''), neither of which were published until the early 1970s, the latter in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crimetime.co.uk/features/jimthompson.php |title=Waring, Charles.

Redford hired him to write a motion picture script about the life of a [[hobo]] during the [[Great Depression]]. Thompson was paid $10,000 for his script ''Bo'', though it was never produced.\n\nMotion picture writer/director [[Sam Fuller]] expressed an interest in adapting ''The Getaway'' for the screen, and Thompson's biographer Robert Polito, in the biography ''[[Savage Art]]'', notes that Fuller so admired the novel that he quipped, half-seriously, that he could use the novel itself as a [[shooting script]]. Eventually, [[Sam Peckinpah]] was slated to direct ''The Getaway.''\n\nIn many regards, ''The Getaway'' was a frustrating repeat of his earlier experience with Kubrick. Thompson wrote a script, but Steve McQueen (who was cast in the movie's lead role of Doc McCoy) rejected it as too reliant on dialogue, with not enough action. Though [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]] was given the sole script credit, Thompson insisted that much of his script ended up in the film. Thompson sought [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild]] [[arbitration]] but the Guild ultimately ruled against him. In the end, the film was heavily [[bowdlerized]] from Thompson's original vision and as King writes, \"if you have seen only the film version of ''The Getaway'', you have no idea of the existential horrors awaiting Doc and Carol McCoy at the point where [[Sam Peckinpah]] ended the story.\"<ref name= king/>\n\nThompson actually appeared in the 1975 movie ''[[Farewell, My Lovely (1975 film)|Farewell, My Lovely]]'', starring Robert Mitchum. He played the character Judge Baxter Wilson Grayle.<ref name= polito495>Robert Polito (1995) p.495</ref> When Thompson's fortunes were fading, he made the acquaintance of writer [[Harlan Ellison]] who had long admired Thompson's books. Though Thompson still drank heavily (preferring to meet at the famed writer's haunt, the [[Musso & Frank Grill]]) and Ellison was a [[teetotaler]] (preferring fast food restaurants), they often met for meals and conversation.\n\nThough Thompson's books were falling out of print in the United States, the French had discovered his works. Though they were not runaway bestsellers in France, his books did sell well enough in that country to keep a trickle of [[royalties]] flowing towards Thompson. Incidentally, Polito also debunks the myth that Thompson was not paid well for his works: Thompson's pay, he notes, was roughly in line with what writers of similar works received during that era.\n\nThompson died in Los Angeles, aged 70, after a series of strokes aggravated by his long-term alcoholism. He refused to eat for some time prior to his death, and this self-inflicted [[starvation]] contributed greatly to his demise. At the time of his death none of his novels were in print in his home country.\n\n==Style==\nThompson's stories are about [[Confidence trick|grifter]]s, losers, [[Psychopathy|sociopath]]s and [[psychopath]]s\u2014some at the fringe of society, some at its heart\u2014their [[nihilism|nihilistic]] world-view being best-served by [[first-person narrative]]s revealing a frighteningly deep understanding of the warped mind. There are few good guys in Thompson's literature: most of his characters are abusive or simply biding time until an opportunity presents itself, though many also have decent impulses.\n\nDespite some positive critical notice, only after his best years as a writer did Thompson achieve a measure of fame. Yet that neglect might stem from his style: the crime novels are fast-moving and compelling but sometimes sloppy and uneven. Thompson wrote quickly (many novels were written in a month); using his newspaper experience to write concise, evocative prose with little editing.\n\nYet at his best his novels were among the most effectively and memorably written genre pieces. He also managed unusual and highly successful literary tricks: halfway through ''A Hell Of A Woman'', the first-person narrator Frank \"Dolly\" Dillon has a [[mental breakdown]]; the sides of his personality then take turns narrating the chapters, alternately violently psychotic (telling the sordid tale that happened) or sweet-natured and patient (telling the idealized fantasy that did not happen). In the final page of the original manuscript the two sides of Dillon's broken personality appear together as two columns of text. The publisher disliked that and instead alternated the two narrations in a long paragraph, alternating standard Roman type and [[Italic type|italicised]] type. Thompson disliked the change, thinking it confusing and difficult for the reader.\n\nFor most of his life Thompson drank heavily; the effects of alcoholism often featured in his works, most prominently in ''The Alcoholics'' (1953) which is set in a [[Alcohol detoxification|detoxification]] clinic. [[Donald E. Westlake]], who adapted ''The Grifters'' for the screen, observed that alcoholism had a great role in Thompson's literature though it tended to be tacit and subtle. Westlake described typical personal relationships in Thompson novels as pleasant in the morning, argumentative in the afternoon and abusive at night\u2014behavior common to the alcoholic Thompson's style of life but which he elided from the stories.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Films and adaptations==\n===Involvement with Stanley Kubrick===\nIn 1955, Thompson moved to Hollywood, California, where [[Stanley Kubrick]] commissioned him to write the screenplay adaptation of [[Lionel White]]'s novel ''Clean Break'' to be filmed as ''[[The Killing (film)|The Killing]]'', Kubrick's first studio-financed movie. Thompson wrote most of the script but Kubrick credited himself as screenplay writer, cheating Thompson with only a vague \"dialogue\" writer credit. They collaborated again on ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' (mostly written by Thompson, who was billed as third screenwriter behind Kubrick and [[Calder Willingham]]) and again in the criminal story titled ''Lunatic at Large'' that never materialized, despite Thompson's having completed and submitted the screen treatment. Though pleased with the work, Kubrick was side-tracked by ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''; when Kubrick returned to ''Lunatic at Large'', the sole copy of Thompson's manuscript had been lost. Kubrick was quoted by family and friends as regretting the lost opportunity. Yet, in 1999, after Kubrick's death, son-in-law Phillip Hobbs found a partial manuscript among his documents. In 2006 the project, re-worked by another co-writer was in pre-production, fifty years after Thompson wrote it.\n\n===Book adaptations===\nTwo of Thompson's books (''[[The Getaway (novel)|The Getaway]]'' and ''[[The Killer Inside Me (1976 film)|The Killer Inside Me]]'') were adapted as Hollywood motion pictures during his lifetime receiving relatively poor reviews. However, Polito argues that neither adaptation was ultimately true to Thompson's spirit. A second, more faithful adaptation of ''[[The Killer Inside Me (2010 film)|The Killer Inside Me]]'' was released in 2010, starring [[Casey Affleck]] and directed by [[Michael Winterbottom]].<ref>{{cite news | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/18/movies/18killer.html | title = The Killer Inside Me |work=The New York Times | date = 2010-06-08 | last = Scott | first = A. O. | accessdate = 2012-04-04}}</ref>\n\nFrench director [[Bertrand Tavernier]] adapted ''Pop. 1280'' for his 1981 film, ''[[Coup de Torchon]]'', changing the setting from the American South to a French colony in West Africa of the 1930s. Aside from shift in setting, Polito argues that ''Coup de Torchon'' was remarkably faithful to the plot and the spirit of the novel, and remains arguably the most authentic adaptation of any of Thompson's work.\n\n''A Hell of a Woman'' was also adapted in French as ''[[S\u00e9rie noire (film)|S\u00e9rie noire]]'' (1979) by Alain Corneau, with dialogues by French Oulipo writer Georges P\u00e9rec. This noir masterpiece set in the grim Paris outskirts features a 16-year-old Marie Trintignant's debut performance, as well as what is generally agreed to be Patrick Dewaere's finest performance. Dewaere conveys a tragic dimension to his manic portrayal of a mediocre door-to-door salesman, at one point repeatedly bashing his head against a car in an effort to exorcise his angst and guilt.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Hollywood resumed its interest in Thompson's writing and several of his novels were re-published. Three novels were adapted for new film treatments during that period: ''[[The Kill-Off]]''; ''[[After Dark, My Sweet (novel)|After Dark, My Sweet]]''; and ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'', which garnered four [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations.\n\n''[[The Getaway (1994 film)|The Getaway]]'' was remade in 1994 with [[Alec Baldwin]] and [[Kim Basinger]] in the lead roles; the film retained the happy ending of the earlier film and received comparable poor reviews.\n\nIn 1996, ''A Swell-Looking Babe'' was released as ''Hit Me,'' and 1997 saw the release of ''[[This World, Then the Fireworks (1997 film)|This World, Then the Fireworks]]'' from Thompson's short story of that name. The latter film starred [[Billy Zane]] and [[Gina Gershon]] as a pair of twisted siblings.\n\n== Cultural references ==\n*Thompson was a major influence on the songwriting style of [[Mark Sandman]], the singer for [[Morphine (band)|Morphine]] and [[Treat Her Right]]; see Sandman songs like \"Murder for the Money\" and \"A Good Woman is Hard to Find\".\n*There is a reference to Thompson's book ''The Killer Inside Me'' in the song, \"Sri Lanka Sex Hotel\", on the Dead Milkmen's Beelzebubba album, and in the song \"Killer Inside Me\" on [[MC 900 Ft. Jesus]]' album ''Welcome to My Dream''.\n*David Thomas, lead singer of [[Pere Ubu]], says of the band's album [[Why I Hate Women]]: \"the back story for this album was the Jim Thompson novel he never wrote.\"<ref>{{cite web |title= Why I Hate Women |publisher= Ubu Projex |url= http://www.ubuprojex.net/wihw.html |accessdate= 2008-05-12}}</ref>\n*Songwriter, guitarist, and singer John Wesley Harding, in an introduction to his song \"The Truth\" during the WXRT-FM Twilight Concert at the World Music Theatre in Tinley Park, Ill., on Sep 12, 1992, said the song was for anyone who had seen the 1950 American film ''Sunset Boulevard'' or \"read a Jim Thompson novel.\"\n*Donald Westlake, who adapted ''The Grifters'' for film in 1990, satirized Thompson later that year in his own novel ''Drowned Hopes''. This book features a character named \"Tom Jimson\" who is hard-boiled to the point of absurdity.\n*In the 1997 film ''[[Cop Land]]'', which takes place partly in (fictitious) Garrison, New Jersey, the \"Welcome to Garrison\" sign pictured sixteen minutes into the film indicates that the population of the town is 1280, as a possible reference to Thompson's novel ''[[Pop. 1280]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://birthmoviesdeath.com/2016/07/19/a-tribute-to-the-sheriff-of-cop-land|title=A Tribute To The Sheriff Of COP LAND|author=Page, Priscilla|date=July 19, 2016|publisher=[[Birth.Movies.Death.]]}}</ref>\n*Jim Thompson has been cited by Norwegian [[crime fiction|crime novelist]] [[Jo Nesb\u00f8]] as being a major influence on his style of writing, particularly because of the way in which he described the human mind and nature.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Greatest Crime Writer|url=https://www.mulhollandbooks.com/guest-posts/the-greatest-crime-writer/|website=mulhollandbooks.com}}</ref>\n*Musician [[Mark E.

Despite some positive critical notice\u2014notably by [[Anthony Boucher]] in ''[[The New York Times]]''\u2014he was little-recognized in his lifetime. Only after death did Thompson's literary stature grow. In the late 1980s, several of his novels were re-published in the ''[[Black Lizard (publisher)|Black Lizard]]'' series of re-discovered crime fiction.\n\nHis best-regarded works include ''[[The Killer Inside Me]]'', ''[[Savage Night]]'', ''[[A Hell of a Woman]]'' and ''[[Pop. 1280]].'' In these works, Thompson turned the derided crime genre into literature and art, featuring [[unreliable narrator]]s, odd structure, and the quasi-surrealistic inner narratives of the last thoughts of his dying or dead characters. A number of Thompson's books were adapted as popular films, including ''[[The Getaway (novel)|The Getaway]]'' and ''[[The Grifters (novel)|The Grifters]]''.\n\nThe writer [[Ronald Verlin Cassill|R.V. Cassill]] has suggested that of all crime fiction, Thompson's was the rawest and most harrowing; that neither [[Dashiell Hammett]] nor [[Raymond Chandler]] nor [[Horace McCoy]], author of the bleak ''[[They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (novel)|They Shoot Horses, Don't They?]],'' ever \"wrote a book within miles of Thompson\".<ref name=polito373>{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Polito|title=Savage Art: A Biography of Jim Thompson|url=https://archive.org/details/savageartbiograp00poli|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]]|date=1995}}</ref> Similarly, in the introduction to ''[[Now and on Earth]]'', [[Stephen King]] says he most admires Thompson's work because \"The guy was over the top. ''The guy was absolutely over the top.'' Big Jim didn't know the meaning of the word ''stop''. There are three brave lets inherent in the foregoing: he let himself see everything, he let himself write it down, then he let himself publish it.\"<ref name= king>King, Stephen; \"Big Jim Thompson: An Appreciation\" pp vii\u2013x in Jim Thompson's ''Now And On Earth'', Vintage Crime/Black Lizard, New York (1994 trade paperback edition; {{ISBN|0-679-74013-9}}. The emphasis is his.)</ref>\n\nThompson was called a \"Dimestore Dostoevsky\" by writer [[Geoffrey O'Brien]]. Film director [[Stephen Frears]], who directed an adaptation of Thompson's ''The Grifters'' as [[1990 in film|1990]]'s ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'', also identified elements of [[Greek tragedy]] in his themes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">From an interview in the 1998 North American DVD version of ''The Grifters'' film.</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\nThompson's life was nearly as colorful as his fiction. His novels were considered semi-autobiographical, or, at least, inspired by his experiences. Thompson's father was [[sheriff]] of [[Caddo County]], Oklahoma. He ran for the state legislature in 1906, but was defeated. Soon after he left the sheriff's office under a cloud due to rumors of [[embezzlement]]. The Thompson family moved to Texas. (The theme of a once-prominent family overtaken by ill-fortune was featured in some of Thompson's works.)\n\n===Early work===\nThompson was born in [[Anadarko, Oklahoma|Anadarko]], [[Oklahoma Territory]], and began writing early: he published a few short pieces while still in his mid-teens. He was intelligent and well-read, but had little interest in or inclination towards formal education. For about two years during [[prohibition]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], Thompson worked long and often wild nights as a bellboy while attending school in the day. He worked at the [[Hotel Texas]]. One biographical profile reports that \"Thompson quickly adapted to the needs of the hotel's guests, busily catering to tastes ranging from questionable morality to directly and undeniably illegal.\" [[Bootleg liquor]] was ubiquitous, and Thompson's brief trips to procure heroin and [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] for hotel patrons were not uncommon.<ref>{{cite web|website=popsubculture.com|url=http://www.popsubculture.com/pop/bio_project/jim_thompson.html|title=Jim Thompson}}</ref> He was soon earning up to $300 per week more than his official $15 monthly wage.\n\nHe smoked and drank heavily, and at nineteen he suffered a [[nervous breakdown]]. In 1926, Thompson began working as an [[petroleum|oil]] field laborer. In the oil fields he met [[Harry McClintock]], a musician, as well as a member and organizer for [[Industrial Workers of the World]], who recruited him into the union.<ref>{{cite web|last=Burnett|first=Jay|title=Things Are Not As They Seem|url=http://www.pennilesspress.co.uk/prose/things_are_not_as_they_seem.htm|publisher=The Penniless Press On-Line|accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> With his father he began an independent oil drilling operation that was ultimately unsuccessful. Thompson returned to Fort Worth, intending to attend school and to write professionally.\n\nThompson's autobiographical \"Oil Field Vignettes\" was published in 1929 (found in March 2010 by history recovery specialist Lee Roy Chapman). He began attending the [[University of Nebraska]] the same year as part of a program for gifted students with \"untraditional educational backgrounds.\" By 1931, however, he had dropped out of school.\n\nFor several years Thompson occasionally wrote short stories for various [[true crime]] magazines. Generally, he would write about murder cases about which he had read in newspapers, but using a first person voice. In this era, he wrote other pieces for various newspapers and magazines, usually as a freelancer, but occasionally as a full-time staff writer. His 1936 \"Ditch of Doom,\" published in ''Master Detective'' Magazine, was selected by the [[Library of America]] in the early 21st century for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American True Crime writing.\n\nIn the early 1930s, Thompson worked as the head of the Oklahoma [[Federal Writers Project]], one of several [[New Deal]] programs intended to provide work for Americans during the [[Great Depression]]. [[Louis L'Amour]], among others, worked under Thompson's direction in this project. Thompson joined the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] in 1935 but left the group by 1938.\n\n===First novels===\nIn the early stages of [[World War II]], Thompson worked at an aircraft factory. He was investigated by the [[FBI]] because of his early Communist Party affiliation. These events were fodder for his semi-autobiographical debut novel, ''Now And On Earth'' (1942). It established his bleak, pessimistic tone, and it was positively reviewed but sold poorly. It featured little of the violence and crime that later permeated his writing. In his second novel, ''Heed The Thunder'' (1946), Thompson centered it on crime. It explores a warped and violent [[Nebraska]] family, partly modeled on his own extended clan.\n\nGaining little attention, Thompson gravitated to the less-prestigious but more lucrative crime fiction genre with ''[[Nothing More Than Murder]].'' He afterwards moved to Lion Books, a small paperback publisher. Lion's [[Arnold Hano]] was his ideal editor, offering the writer essentially free rein about content, yet expecting him to be productive and reliable. Lion published most of Thompson's best-regarded works.\n\nTo support his family while writing novels, Thompson took a job as a reporter with the ''Los Angeles Mirror'', a tabloid newspaper owned by the [[Los Angeles Times]], shortly after the ''Mirror'' was founded in 1948. He wrote for the ''Mirror'' until 1949.\n\n===Fifties maturity and ''The Killer Inside Me''===\n[[File:KillerInsideMe.jpg|thumb|140px|''The Killer Inside Me'']]\nIn 1952, Thompson published ''[[The Killer Inside Me]]''. The narrator, Lou Ford, is a small-town deputy sheriff who appears amiable, pleasant and slightly dull-minded. Ford is actually very intelligent and fighting a nearly-constant urge to act violently; Ford describes his urge as ''the sickness'' (always italicised). Lion Books tried to have ''The Killer Inside Me'' nominated for a [[National Book Award]]. It was eponymously adapted for the cinema in 1976 (by director [[Burt Kennedy]], with [[Stacy Keach]] as Lou Ford) and [[The Killer Inside Me (2010 film)|again in 2010]] (by director [[Michael Winterbottom]], with [[Casey Affleck]] as Ford and co-starring [[Kate Hudson]] and [[Jessica Alba]]). After ''The Killer Inside Me'' was published, Thompson began producing novels at a furious pace. He published another novel in 1952, then five novels a year in 1953 and 1954.\n\n''[[Savage Night]],'' published in 1953, is generally ranked as one of his best novels. It is also one of his oddest literary offerings. Its narrator, Charlie \"Little\" Bigger (also known as Carl Bigelow), is a small, [[tuberculosis|tubercular]] [[hitman]] whose mind is deteriorating with his body. In reviewing ''Savage Night'', Boucher said it was \"written with vigor and bite, but sheering off from [[Realism (arts)|realism]] into a peculiar [[surrealist]] ending of sheer [[Grand Guignol|Guignol]] horror. Odd that a mass-consumption paperback should contain the most experimental writing I've seen in a suspense novel of late\".<ref name= polito373/> ''Savage Night'' contains an interlude\u2014whether or not it is fantasy or dream, hallucination or flashback is unclear\u2014when Bigger meets a poor, verbose writer who, much like Thompson, has a penchant for booze and makes a living writing pulp fiction to be sold alongside pornography. The writer also claims to operate a \"farm\" where he grows vaginas as a metaphor for the material he writes.\n\n===Later novels, television work and novelizations===\nAfter his film work, Thompson remained in California for the rest of his life. From the mid-1950s through the late 1960s, Thompson continued to write fiction, although not at the same torrid pace of 1952 to 1954. During this era, Thompson usually completed one novel a year, but he gradually drifted away from writing his increasingly unpopular novels, abandoning the medium completely by the end of the 1960s. In 1967, he published ''South of Heaven'', about a young migrant laborer working on an oil pipeline in Texas.\n\nWith his novels providing scant income, Thompson turned to other forms of writing to pay the bills. Beginning in 1959, and continuing through the mid-1960s, Thompson also began writing television programs, including episodes of the action/adventure shows ''[[Mackenzie's Raiders]]'' (1959), ''[[Cain's Hundred]]'' (1961) and ''[[Convoy (TV series)|Convoy]]'' (1965). TV work seemingly dried up for Thompson after this point, so he turned to writing tie-in novels based on produced TV shows and screenplays: this work paid a flat fee, and could be completed quickly. Thompson's tie-ins include an original novel based on the television series ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'' (1967), as well as screenplay novelizations of the films ''[[The Undefeated (1969 film)|The Undefeated]]'' (1969) and ''[[Nothing But a Man]]'' (1970).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/jthompso.htm |title=Jim Thompson |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030416021954/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/jthompso.htm |archivedate=April 16, 2003 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s, Thompson wrote his two final original books, ''King Blood'' and ''Child of Rage'' (its provisional title was ''White Mother, Black Son''), neither of which were published until the early 1970s, the latter in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crimetime.co.uk/features/jimthompson.php |title=Waring, Charles.

Redford hired him to write a motion picture script about the life of a [[hobo]] during the [[Great Depression]]. Thompson was paid $10,000 for his script ''Bo'', though it was never produced.\n\nMotion picture writer/director [[Sam Fuller]] expressed an interest in adapting ''The Getaway'' for the screen, and Thompson's biographer Robert Polito, in the biography ''[[Savage Art]]'', notes that Fuller so admired the novel that he quipped, half-seriously, that he could use the novel itself as a [[shooting script]]. Eventually, [[Sam Peckinpah]] was slated to direct ''The Getaway.''\n\nIn many regards, ''The Getaway'' was a frustrating repeat of his earlier experience with Kubrick. Thompson wrote a script, but Steve McQueen (who was cast in the movie's lead role of Doc McCoy) rejected it as too reliant on dialogue, with not enough action. Though [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]] was given the sole script credit, Thompson insisted that much of his script ended up in the film. Thompson sought [[Writers Guild of America|Writers Guild]] [[arbitration]] but the Guild ultimately ruled against him. In the end, the film was heavily [[bowdlerized]] from Thompson's original vision and as King writes, \"if you have seen only the film version of ''The Getaway'', you have no idea of the existential horrors awaiting Doc and Carol McCoy at the point where [[Sam Peckinpah]] ended the story.\"<ref name= king/>\n\nThompson actually appeared in the 1975 movie ''[[Farewell, My Lovely (1975 film)|Farewell, My Lovely]]'', starring Robert Mitchum. He played the character Judge Baxter Wilson Grayle.<ref name= polito495>Robert Polito (1995) p.495</ref> When Thompson's fortunes were fading, he made the acquaintance of writer [[Harlan Ellison]] who had long admired Thompson's books. Though Thompson still drank heavily (preferring to meet at the famed writer's haunt, the [[Musso & Frank Grill]]) and Ellison was a [[teetotaler]] (preferring fast food restaurants), they often met for meals and conversation.\n\nThough Thompson's books were falling out of print in the United States, the French had discovered his works. Though they were not runaway bestsellers in France, his books did sell well enough in that country to keep a trickle of [[royalties]] flowing towards Thompson. Incidentally, Polito also debunks the myth that Thompson was not paid well for his works: Thompson's pay, he notes, was roughly in line with what writers of similar works received during that era.\n\nThompson died in Los Angeles, aged 70, after a series of strokes aggravated by his long-term alcoholism. He refused to eat for some time prior to his death, and this self-inflicted [[starvation]] contributed greatly to his demise. At the time of his death none of his novels were in print in his home country.\n\n==Style==\nThompson's stories are about [[Confidence trick|grifter]]s, losers, [[Psychopathy|sociopath]]s and [[psychopath]]s\u2014some at the fringe of society, some at its heart\u2014their [[nihilism|nihilistic]] world-view being best-served by [[first-person narrative]]s revealing a frighteningly deep understanding of the warped mind. There are few good guys in Thompson's literature: most of his characters are abusive or simply biding time until an opportunity presents itself, though many also have decent impulses.\n\nDespite some positive critical notice, only after his best years as a writer did Thompson achieve a measure of fame. Yet that neglect might stem from his style: the crime novels are fast-moving and compelling but sometimes sloppy and uneven. Thompson wrote quickly (many novels were written in a month); using his newspaper experience to write concise, evocative prose with little editing.\n\nYet at his best his novels were among the most effectively and memorably written genre pieces. He also managed unusual and highly successful literary tricks: halfway though ''A Hell Of A Woman'', the first-person narrator Frank \"Dolly\" Dillon has a [[mental breakdown]]; the sides of his personality then take turns narrating the chapters, alternately violently psychotic (telling the sordid tale that happened) or sweet-natured and patient (telling the idealized fantasy that did not happen). In the final page of the original manuscript the two sides of Dillon's broken personality appear together as two columns of text. The publisher disliked that and instead alternated the two narrations in a long paragraph, alternating standard Roman type and [[Italic type|italicised]] type. Thompson disliked the change, thinking it confusing and difficult for the reader.\n\nFor most of his life Thompson drank heavily; the effects of alcoholism often featured in his works, most prominently in ''The Alcoholics'' (1953) which is set in a [[Alcohol detoxification|detoxification]] clinic. [[Donald E. Westlake]], who adapted ''The Grifters'' for the screen, observed that alcoholism had a great role in Thompson's literature though it tended to be tacit and subtle. Westlake described typical personal relationships in Thompson novels as pleasant in the morning, argumentative in the afternoon and abusive at night\u2014behavior common to the alcoholic Thompson's style of life but which he elided from the stories.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Films and adaptations==\n===Involvement with Stanley Kubrick===\nIn 1955, Thompson moved to Hollywood, California, where [[Stanley Kubrick]] commissioned him to write the screenplay adaptation of [[Lionel White]]'s novel ''Clean Break'' to be filmed as ''[[The Killing (film)|The Killing]]'', Kubrick's first studio-financed movie. Thompson wrote most of the script but Kubrick credited himself as screenplay writer, cheating Thompson with only a vague \"dialogue\" writer credit. They collaborated again on ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' (mostly written by Thompson, who was billed as third screenwriter behind Kubrick and [[Calder Willingham]]) and again in the criminal story titled ''Lunatic at Large'' that never materialized, despite Thompson's having completed and submitted the screen treatment. Though pleased with the work, Kubrick was side-tracked by ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''; when Kubrick returned to ''Lunatic at Large'', the sole copy of Thompson's manuscript had been lost. Kubrick was quoted by family and friends as regretting the lost opportunity. Yet, in 1999, after Kubrick's death, son-in-law Phillip Hobbs found a partial manuscript among his documents. In 2006 the project, re-worked by another co-writer was in pre-production, fifty years after Thompson wrote it.\n\n===Book adaptations===\nTwo of Thompson's books (''[[The Getaway (novel)|The Getaway]]'' and ''[[The Killer Inside Me (1976 film)|The Killer Inside Me]]'') were adapted as Hollywood motion pictures during his lifetime receiving relatively poor reviews. However, Polito argues that neither adaptation was ultimately true to Thompson's spirit. A second, more faithful adaptation of ''[[The Killer Inside Me (2010 film)|The Killer Inside Me]]'' was released in 2010, starring [[Casey Affleck]] and directed by [[Michael Winterbottom]].<ref>{{cite news | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/18/movies/18killer.html | title = The Killer Inside Me |work=The New York Times | date = 2010-06-08 | last = Scott | first = A. O. | accessdate = 2012-04-04}}</ref>\n\nFrench director [[Bertrand Tavernier]] adapted ''Pop. 1280'' for his 1981 film, ''[[Coup de Torchon]]'', changing the setting from the American South to a French colony in West Africa of the 1930s. Aside from shift in setting, Polito argues that ''Coup de Torchon'' was remarkably faithful to the plot and the spirit of the novel, and remains arguably the most authentic adaptation of any of Thompson's work.\n\n''A Hell of a Woman'' was also adapted in French as ''[[S\u00e9rie noire (film)|S\u00e9rie noire]]'' (1979) by Alain Corneau, with dialogues by French Oulipo writer Georges P\u00e9rec. This noir masterpiece set in the grim Paris outskirts features a 16-year-old Marie Trintignant's debut performance, as well as what is generally agreed to be Patrick Dewaere's finest performance. Dewaere conveys a tragic dimension to his manic portrayal of a mediocre door-to-door salesman, at one point repeatedly bashing his head against a car in an effort to exorcise his angst and guilt.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Hollywood resumed its interest in Thompson's writing and several of his novels were re-published. Three novels were adapted for new film treatments during that period: ''[[The Kill-Off]]''; ''[[After Dark, My Sweet (novel)|After Dark, My Sweet]]''; and ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'', which garnered four [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations.\n\n''[[The Getaway (1994 film)|The Getaway]]'' was remade in 1994 with [[Alec Baldwin]] and [[Kim Basinger]] in the lead roles; the film retained the happy ending of the earlier film and received comparable poor reviews.\n\nIn 1996, ''A Swell-Looking Babe'' was released as ''Hit Me,'' and 1997 saw the release of ''[[This World, Then the Fireworks (1997 film)|This World, Then the Fireworks]]'' from Thompson's short story of that name. The latter film starred [[Billy Zane]] and [[Gina Gershon]] as a pair of twisted siblings.\n\n== Cultural references ==\n*Thompson was a major influence on the songwriting style of [[Mark Sandman]], the singer for [[Morphine (band)|Morphine]] and [[Treat Her Right]]; see Sandman songs like \"Murder for the Money\" and \"A Good Woman is Hard to Find\".\n*There is a reference to Thompson's book ''The Killer Inside Me'' in the song, \"Sri Lanka Sex Hotel\", on the Dead Milkmen's Beelzebubba album, and in the song \"Killer Inside Me\" on [[MC 900 Ft. Jesus]]' album ''Welcome to My Dream''.\n*David Thomas, lead singer of [[Pere Ubu]], says of the band's album [[Why I Hate Women]]: \"the back story for this album was the Jim Thompson novel he never wrote.\"<ref>{{cite web |title= Why I Hate Women |publisher= Ubu Projex |url= http://www.ubuprojex.net/wihw.html |accessdate= 2008-05-12}}</ref>\n*Songwriter, guitarist, and singer John Wesley Harding, in an introduction to his song \"The Truth\" during the WXRT-FM Twilight Concert at the World Music Theatre in Tinley Park, Ill., on Sep 12, 1992, said the song was for anyone who had seen the 1950 American film ''Sunset Boulevard'' or \"read a Jim Thompson novel.\"\n*Donald Westlake, who adapted ''The Grifters'' for film in 1990, satirized Thompson later that year in his own novel ''Drowned Hopes''. This book features a character named \"Tom Jimson\" who is hard-boiled to the point of absurdity.\n*In the 1997 film ''[[Cop Land]]'', which takes place partly in (fictitious) Garrison, New Jersey, the \"Welcome to Garrison\" sign pictured sixteen minutes into the film indicates that the population of the town is 1280, as a possible reference to Thompson's novel ''[[Pop. 1280]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://birthmoviesdeath.com/2016/07/19/a-tribute-to-the-sheriff-of-cop-land|title=A Tribute To The Sheriff Of COP LAND|author=Page, Priscilla|date=July 19, 2016|publisher=[[Birth.Movies.Death.]]}}</ref>\n*Jim Thompson has been cited by Norwegian [[crime fiction|crime novelist]] [[Jo Nesb\u00f8]] as being a major influence on his style of writing, particularly because of the way in which he described the human mind and nature.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Greatest Crime Writer|url=https://www.mulhollandbooks.com/guest-posts/the-greatest-crime-writer/|website=mulhollandbooks.com}}</ref>\n*Musician [[Mark E.

These movements were nationalist and revolutionary not Islamic but their view that terrorism could be effective in reaching their political goals generated the first phase of modern international terrorism. In the late 1960s, Palestinian secular movements such as [[Fatah|Al Fatah]] and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) began to target civilians outside the immediate arena of conflict. Following Israel's [[Six-Day War|1967 defeat of Arab forces]], Palestinian leaders began to see that the [[Arab world]] was unable to militarily confront Israel. During the same time, lessons drawn from [[revolutionary movement]]s in Latin America, North Africa, Southeast Asia as well as during the Jewish struggle against Britain in Palestine, saw the Palestinians turn away from [[guerrilla warfare]] towards urban terrorism. These movements were secular in nature but their international organization served to spread terrorist tactics worldwide.<ref name=\":4\" />\n \nReligiously motivated groups grew after the failure of Arab nationalism in the [[Six-Day War]] against Israel.

Islamists often identify what they see as a historical struggle between [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], dating back as far as the [[Crusades]], among other historical conflicts between practitioners of the two respective religions. [[Osama bin Laden]], for example, almost invariably described his enemies as aggressive and his call for action against them as defensive. [[Defensive jihad]] differs from offensive jihad by being \"[[fard]] al-ayn\", or a personal obligation of all Muslims, rather than \"fard al-kifaya\", a communal obligation, that is, some Muslims may perform it but it is not required of others. Hence, framing a fight as defensive has the advantage of both appearing to be a victim rather than appearing to be an aggressor, and giving the struggle the very highest religious priority for all good Muslims.\n\nMany of the violent terrorist groups use the name of jihad to fight against certain Western nations and [[Israel]]. An example is bin Laden's al-Qaeda, which is also known as \"International Islamic Front for Jihad Against the Jews and Crusaders\". Most militant Islamists oppose Israel's policies, and they often oppose its very existence.\n\nAccording to [[U.S. Army]] Colonel Dale C. Eikmeier, \"ideology\", rather than any individual or group, is the \"center of gravity\" of al-Qaeda and related groups, and that ideology is a \"collection of violent Islamic thought called [[Qutbism]]\".<ref name=\"eikmeier\"/> He summarizes the tenets of Qutbism as being:\n* A belief that Muslims have deviated from true Islam and must return to \"pure Islam\" as originally practiced during the time of [[Muhammad]].\n* The path to \"pure Islam\" is only through a literal and strict interpretation of the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]], along with implementation of Muhammad's commands.\n* Muslims should interpret the original sources individually without being bound to follow the interpretations of Islamic scholars.\n* That any interpretation of the Quran from a historical, contextual perspective is a corruption, and that the majority of Islamic history and the [[Fiqh|classical jurisprudential tradition]] is mere sophistry.<ref name=\"eikmeier\"/>\n\nThe historic rivalry between [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and Muslims in the [[South Asia|Indian subcontinent]] has also often been the primary motive behind some of the most deadly terrorist attacks in India. According to a [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] report, India topped the list of countries most affected by Islamic terrorism.\n\nIn addition, Islamist militants, scholars, and leaders opposed Western society for what they see as [[Morality|immoral]] [[secularism]]. Islamists have claimed that such unrestricted free speech has led to the proliferation of [[pornography]], [[immorality]], [[secularism]], [[homosexuality]], [[feminism]], and many other ideas that Islamists often oppose. Although bin Laden almost always emphasized the alleged oppression of Muslims by America and Jews when talking about the need for jihad in his messages, in his \"Letter to America\", he answered the question, \"What are we calling you to, and what do we want from you?\" with\n\n<blockquote>We call you to be a people of manners, principles, honour, and purity; to reject the immoral acts of fornication, homosexuality, intoxicants, gambling's, and trading with interest (...) You separate religion from your policies, (...) You are the nation that permits Usury, which has been forbidden by all the religions (...) You are a nation that permits the production, trading and usage of intoxicants (...) You are a nation that permits acts of immorality (...) You are a nation that permits gambling in its all forms. (...) You use women to serve passengers, visitors, and strangers to increase your profit margins. You then rant that you support the liberation of women.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/nov/24/theobserver Full text: bin Laden's 'letter to America'] accessed 24 May 2007</ref></blockquote>\n\nGiven their perceived [[piety]], ''[[The Times]]'' noted the irony when an investigation discovered that Jihadists were seeking anonymity through some of the same networks used to distribute [[child pornography]].

The bombers, and their sympathizers often believe that suicide bombers, as martyrs ([[Shahid|shaheed]]) to the cause of jihad against the enemy, will receive the rewards of [[Jannah|paradise]] for their actions.\n\n===Hijackings===\nIslamic terrorism sometimes employs the hijacking of passenger vehicles. The most infamous were the [[September 11 attacks|\"9/11\"]] attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people on a single day in 2001, effectively ending the era of [[aircraft hijacking]].\n\n===Kidnappings and executions===\n{{Main|Beheading in Islamism}}\n{{see also|Beheading video|ISIL beheading incidents}}\n\nAlong with bombings and hijackings, Islamic terrorists have made extensive use of highly publicised kidnappings and executions, often circulating videos of the acts for use as propaganda. A frequent form of execution by these groups is [[decapitation]], another is shooting. In the 1980s, a series of abductions of American citizens by Hezbollah during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] resulted in the 1986 [[Iran\u2013Contra affair]]. During the chaos of the [[Iraq War]], more than 200 kidnappings [[Foreign hostages in Iraq|foreign hostages]] (for various reasons and by various groups, including purely criminal) gained great international notoriety, even as the great majority (thousands) of victims were Iraqis. In 2007, the [[kidnapping of Alan Johnston]] by [[Army of Islam (Gaza Strip)|Army of Islam]] resulted in the British government meeting a Hamas member for the first time.\n\n[[Islamism|Islamist]] militants, including [[Boko Haram]], [[Hamas]], [[al-Qaeda]] and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], have used [[kidnapping]] as a method of fundraising, as a means of bargaining for political concessions, and as a way of intimidating potential opponents.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shay|first1=Shaul|title=Global Jihad and the Tactic of Terror Abduction: A Comprehensive Review of Islamic Terrorist Organizations|date=December 2013|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1845196110}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Rubin]] argued in 2005 that hostage-taking became popular among terrorist groups as a tactic that can hold the attention of a public that had become inured to mass death techniques such as [[suicide bombing]], and that it can garner significant \"political and diplomatic\" payoff. Rubin writes that Islamist kidnappers have the additional, \"ideological goals\" of using hostages both to \"shock the outside world\" and to \"appeal to their own constituency\", and that the public humiliation of hostages is a specific Islamist goal.

The three main reasons France is attacked are, in no particular order:<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n* France's foreign policy towards Muslim countries and jihadist fronts. France is seen as the spearhead directed against jihadist groups in Africa, just as the United States is seen as the main force opposing jihadist groups elsewhere. France's former foreign policies such as that as its colonization of Muslim countries is also brought up in jihadist propaganda, for example that the influence of French education, culture and political institutions had served to erase the Muslim identity of those colonies and their inhabitants.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Bindner|first=Laurence|date=2018|title=Jihadists' Grievance Narratives against France|url=https://icct.nl/publication/jihadists-grievance-narratives-against-france/|journal=Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism Studies|volume=|pages=4\u20138|doi=10.19165/2018.2.01|via=}}</ref>\n* France's secular domestic policies (''[[La\u00efcit\u00e9]]'') which jihadists perceive to be hostile towards Islam.

For instance, [[Marianne]], the national emblem of France, is considered a \"a false idol\" by jihadists and the French to be \"idol worshippers\". France also has no law against blasphemy and an [[Anti-clericalism|anticlerical]] satirical press which is less respectful towards religion than that of the US or the United Kingdom.

These movements were nationalist and revolutionary not Islamic but their view that terrorism could be effective in reaching their political goals generated the first phase of modern international terrorism. In the late 1960s, Palestinian secular movements such as [[Fatah|Al Fatah]] and the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) began to target civilians outside the immediate arena of conflict. Following Israel's [[Six-Day War|1967 defeat of Arab forces]], Palestinian leaders began to see that the [[Arab world]] was unable to militarily confront Israel. During the same time, lessons drawn from [[revolutionary movement]]s in Latin America, North Africa, Southeast Asia as well as during the Jewish struggle against Britain in Palestine, saw the Palestinians turn away from [[guerrilla warfare]] towards urban terrorism. These movements were secular in nature but their international organization served to spread terrorist tactics worldwide.<ref name=\":4\" />\n \nReligiously motivated groups grew after the failure of Arab nationalism in the [[Six-Day War]] against Israel.

Since their beginning in 1994, the Pakistani-supported [[Taliban]] militia in Afghanistan has gained several characteristics traditionally associated with [[state sponsors of terrorism|state-sponsors of terrorism]], providing logistical support, travel documentation, and training facilities. Since 1989 the increasing willingness of religious extremists to strike targets outside immediate country or regional areas highlights the global nature of contemporary terrorism.

Islamists often identify what they see as a historical struggle between [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], dating back as far as the [[Crusades]], among other historical conflicts between practitioners of the two respective religions. [[Osama bin Laden]], for example, almost invariably described his enemies as aggressive and his call for action against them as defensive. [[Defensive jihad]] differs from offensive jihad by being \"[[fard]] al-ayn\", or a personal obligation of all Muslims, rather than \"fard al-kifaya\", a communal obligation, that is, some Muslims may perform it but it is not required of others. Hence, framing a fight as defensive has the advantage of both appearing to be a victim rather than appearing to be an aggressor, and giving the struggle the very highest religious priority for all good Muslims.\n\nMany of the violent terrorist groups use the name of jihad to fight against certain Western nations and [[Israel]]. An example is bin Laden's al-Qaeda, which is also known as \"International Islamic Front for Jihad Against the Jews and Crusaders\". Most militant Islamists oppose Israel's policies, and they often oppose its very existence.\n\nAccording to [[U.S. Army]] Colonel Dale C. Eikmeier, \"ideology\", rather than any individual or group, is the \"center of gravity\" of al-Qaeda and related groups, and that ideology is a \"collection of violent Islamic thought called [[Qutbism]]\".<ref name=\"eikmeier\"/> He summarizes the tenets of Qutbism as being:\n* A belief that Muslims have deviated from true Islam and must return to \"pure Islam\" as originally practiced during the time of [[Muhammad]].\n* The path to \"pure Islam\" is only through a literal and strict interpretation of the [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]], along with implementation of Muhammad's commands.\n* Muslims should interpret the original sources individually without being bound to follow the interpretations of Islamic scholars.\n* That any interpretation of the Quran from a historical, contextual perspective is a corruption, and that the majority of Islamic history and the [[Fiqh|classical jurisprudential tradition]] is mere sophistry.<ref name=\"eikmeier\"/>\n\nThe historic rivalry between [[Hinduism|Hindus]] and Muslims in the [[South Asia|Indian subcontinent]] has also often been the primary motive behind some of the most deadly terrorist attacks in India. According to a [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] report, India topped the list of countries most affected by Islamic terrorism.\n\nIn addition, Islamist militants, scholars, and leaders opposed Western society for what they see as [[Morality|immoral]] [[secularism]]. Islamists have claimed that such unrestricted free speech has led to the proliferation of [[pornography]], [[immorality]], [[secularism]], [[homosexuality]], [[feminism]], and many other ideas that Islamists often oppose. Although bin Laden almost always emphasized the alleged oppression of Muslims by America and Jews when talking about the need for jihad in his messages, in his \"Letter to America\", he answered the question, \"What are we calling you to, and what do we want from you?\" with\n\n<blockquote>We call you to be a people of manners, principles, honour, and purity; to reject the immoral acts of fornication, homosexuality, intoxicants, gambling's, and trading with interest (...) You separate religion from your policies, (...) You are the nation that permits Usury, which has been forbidden by all the religions (...) You are a nation that permits the production, trading and usage of intoxicants (...) You are a nation that permits acts of immorality (...) You are a nation that permits gambling in its all forms.

Wide majorities say such attacks are, at most, rarely acceptable. The shift of attitudes against terror has been especially dramatic in Jordan, where 29% of Jordanians were recorded as viewing suicide-attacks as often or sometimes justified (down from 57% in May 2005). In the largest majority-Muslim nation, Indonesia, 74% of respondents agree that terrorist attacks are \"never justified\" (a substantial increase from the 41% level to which support had risen in March 2004); in Pakistan, that figure is 86%; in Bangladesh, 81%; and in Iran, 80%.<ref name=\"australia.to\"/>\n* A poll conducted in Osama bin Laden's home country of Saudi Arabia in December 2008 shows that his compatriots have dramatically turned against him, his organisation, Saudi volunteers in Iraq, and terrorism in general.

The bombers, and their sympathizers often believe that suicide bombers, as martyrs ([[Shahid|shaheed]]) to the cause of jihad against the enemy, will receive the rewards of [[Jannah|paradise]] for their actions.\n\n===Hijackings===\nIslamic terrorism sometimes employs the hijacking of passenger vehicles. The most infamous were the [[September 11 attacks|\"9/11\"]] attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people on a single day in 2001, effectively ending the era of [[aircraft hijacking]].\n\n===Kidnappings and executions===\n{{Main|Beheading in Islamism}}\n{{see also|Beheading video|ISIL beheading incidents}}\n\nAlong with bombings and hijackings, Islamic terrorists have made extensive use of highly publicised kidnappings and executions, often circulating videos of the acts for use as propaganda. A frequent form of execution by these groups is [[decapitation]], another is shooting. In the 1980s, a series of abductions of American citizens by Hezbollah during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] resulted in the 1986 [[Iran\u2013Contra affair]]. During the chaos of the [[Iraq War]], more than 200 kidnappings [[Foreign hostages in Iraq|foreign hostages]] (for various reasons and by various groups, including purely criminal) gained great international notoriety, even as the great majority (thousands) of victims were Iraqis. In 2007, the [[kidnapping of Alan Johnston]] by [[Army of Islam (Gaza Strip)|Army of Islam]] resulted in the British government meeting a Hamas member for the first time.\n\n[[Islamism|Islamist]] militants, including [[Boko Haram]], [[Hamas]], [[al-Qaeda]] and the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], have used [[kidnapping]] as a method of fundraising, as a means of bargaining for political concessions, and as a way of intimidating potential opponents.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shay|first1=Shaul|title=Global Jihad and the Tactic of Terror Abduction: A Comprehensive Review of Islamic Terrorist Organizations|date=December 2013|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1845196110}}</ref>\n\n[[Michael Rubin]] argued in 2005 that hostage-taking became popular among terrorist groups as a tactic that can hold the attention of a public that had become inured to mass death techniques such as [[suicide bombing]], and that it can garner significant \"political and diplomatic\" payoff.

The three main reasons France is attacked are, in no particular order:<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n* France's foreign policy towards Muslim countries and jihadist fronts. France is seen as the spearhead directed against jihadist groups in Africa, just as the United States is seen as the main force opposing jihadist groups elsewhere. France's former foreign policies such as that as its colonization of Muslim countries is also brought up in jihadist propaganda, for example that the influence of French education, culture and political institutions had served to erase the Muslim identity of those colonies and their inhabitants.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Bindner|first=Laurence|date=2018|title=Jihadists' Grievance Narratives against France|url=https://icct.nl/publication/jihadists-grievance-narratives-against-france/|journal=Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism Studies|volume=|pages=4\u20138|doi=10.19165/2018.2.01|via=}}</ref>\n* France's secular domestic policies (''[[La\u00efcit\u00e9]]'') which jihadists perceive to be hostile towards Islam. Also France's status as an officially secular nation and jihadists label France as \"the flagship of disbelief\".<ref name=\":7\" />\n* Jihadists consider France as a strong proponent of disbelief. For instance, [[Marianne]], the national emblem of France, is considered a \"a false idol\" by jihadists and the French to be \"idol worshippers\". France also has no law against blasphemy and an [[Anti-clericalism|anticlerical]] satirical press which is less respectful towards religion than that of the US or the United Kingdom.

In the [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]] in October 2002, three Chechen separatist groups took an estimated 850 people hostage in the Russian capital; at least 129 hostages died during the storming by Russian special forces, all but one killed by the chemicals used to subdue the attackers (whether this attack would more properly be called a [[nationalism|nationalist]] rather than an Islamist attack is in question).

One is that the shrine was a place of worship for Angels before the creation of man. Later, a house of worship was built on the location which was lost during the flood in [[Noah]]'s time and was finally rebuilt by [[Abraham]] and [[Ishmael]] as mentioned later in the Quran. Ibn Kathir regarded this tradition as weak and preferred instead the narration by [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] that although several other temples might have preceded the ''Kaaba'', it was the first \"House of God\", dedicated solely to Him, built by His instruction and sanctified and blessed by Him as stated in Quran 22:26\u201329.<ref>{{cite book|title=Tafsir Ibn Kathir on 3:96|url=http://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=7&tSoraNo=3&tAyahNo=96&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=1}}</ref> A [[Hadith]] in [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] states that the ''Kaaba'' was the First Mosque on Earth, and the Second Mosque was the [[temple of solomon|Temple in Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Sahih Bukhari|location=Book 55, Hadith 585|url=http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=55&translator=1&start=0&number=585#585}}</ref>\n\nWhile Abraham was building the ''Kaaba'', an angel brought to him the [[Black Stone]] which he placed in the eastern corner of the structure. Another stone was the Maqam-e-Ibrahim (literally the Station of Abraham) where Abraham stood for elevation while building the structure. The Black Stone and the Maqam-e-Ibrahim are believed by Muslims to be the only remnant of the original structure made by Abraham as naturally the remaining structure had to be demolished and rebuilt several times over history for maintenance purposes. After the construction was complete, God enjoined the descendants of Ishmael to perform an annual pilgrimage: the [[Hajj]] and the [[Korban]], sacrifice of cattle. The vicinity of the shrine was also made a sanctuary where bloodshed and war were forbidden.{{cite quran|22|26|e=33}}\n\nAccording to Islamic tradition, over the millennia after Ishmael's death, his progeny and the local tribes who settled around the [[Zamzam Well|oasis of Zam-Zam]] gradually turned to polytheism and idolatry. Several idols were placed within the ''Kaaba'' representing deities of different aspects of nature and different tribes.

There was a \"red stone\", the deity of the south Arabian city of Ghaiman, and the \"white stone\" in the ''Kaaba'' of al-Abalat (near the city of [[Tabalah, Saudi Arabia|Tabala]], south of Mecca). Grunebaum in ''Classical Islam'' points out that the experience of divinity of that period was often associated with stone [[Fetishism|fetishes]], mountains, special rock formations, or \"trees of strange growth.\"<ref>Grunebaum, p. 24</ref>\n\nThe ''Kaaba'' was thought to be at the center of the world, with the Gate of Heaven directly above it. The ''Kaaba'' marked the location where the sacred world intersected with the profane; the embedded Black Stone was a further symbol of this as a [[meteorite]] that had fallen from the sky and linked heaven and earth.<ref>Armstrong, ''Jerusalem'', p. 221</ref>\n\nAccording to Sarwar,<ref>{{cite book|title=Muhammad the Holy Prophet|author=Hafiz Ghulam Sarwar|pages=18\u201319}}</ref> about 400 years before the birth of Muhammad, a man named \"Amr bin Lahyo bin Harath bin Amr ul-Qais bin Thalaba bin Azd bin Khalan bin Babalyun bin Saba\", who was descended from [[Qahtan]] and was the king of [[Hijaz]] had placed a Hubal idol onto the roof of the ''Kaaba''. This idol was one of the chief deities of the ruling tribe [[Quraysh]]. The idol was made of red agate and shaped like a human, but with the right hand broken off and replaced with a golden hand. When the idol was moved inside the ''Kaaba'', it had seven arrows in front of it, which were used for [[divination]].<ref>Francis E.

They depict it as a city grown rich on the proceeds of the [[spice trade]].

Crone argues that if Mecca had been a well-known center of trade, it would have been mentioned by later authors such as [[Procopius]], [[Nonnosus]], or the Syrian church chroniclers writing in Syriac.

One is that the shrine was a place of worship for Angels before the creation of man. Later, a house of worship was built on the location which was lost during the flood in [[Noah]]'s time and was finally rebuilt by [[Abraham]] and [[Ishmael]] as mentioned later in the Quran. Ibn Kathir regarded this tradition as weak and preferred instead the narration by [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] that although several other temples might have preceded the ''Kaaba'', it was the first \"House of God\", dedicated solely to Him, built by His instruction and sanctified and blessed by Him as stated in Quran 22:26\u201329.<ref>{{cite book|title=Tafsir Ibn Kathir on 3:96|url=http://www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=0&tTafsirNo=7&tSoraNo=3&tAyahNo=96&tDisplay=yes&UserProfile=0&LanguageId=1}}</ref> A [[Hadith]] in [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] states that the ''Kaaba'' was the First Mosque on Earth, and the Second Mosque was the [[temple of solomon|Temple in Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Sahih Bukhari|location=Book 55, Hadith 585|url=http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=55&translator=1&start=0&number=585#585}}</ref>\n\nWhile Abraham was building the ''Kaaba'', an angel brought to him the [[Black Stone]] which he placed in the eastern corner of the structure. Another stone was the Maqam-e-Ibrahim (literally the Station of Abraham) where Abraham stood for elevation while building the structure. The Black Stone and the Maqam-e-Ibrahim are believed by Muslims to be the only remnant of the original structure made by Abraham as naturally the remaining structure had to be demolished and rebuilt several times over history for maintenance purposes. After the construction was complete, God enjoined the descendants of Ishmael to perform an annual pilgrimage: the [[Hajj]] and the [[Korban]], sacrifice of cattle. The vicinity of the shrine was also made a sanctuary where bloodshed and war were forbidden.{{cite quran|22|26|e=33}}\n\nAccording to Islamic tradition, over the millennia after Ishmael's death, his progeny and the local tribes who settled around the [[Zamzam Well|oasis of Zam-Zam]] gradually turned to polytheism and idolatry. Several idols were placed within the ''Kaaba'' representing deities of different aspects of nature and different tribes. Several rituals were adopted in the Pilgrimage (Hajj) including doing naked circumambulation.<ref name=\"Ishaq2\">{{Cite book | last = Ibn Ishaq | first = Muhammad | title = Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah \u2013 The Life of Muhammad Translated by A.

There was a \"red stone\", the deity of the south Arabian city of Ghaiman, and the \"white stone\" in the ''Kaaba'' of al-Abalat (near the city of [[Tabalah, Saudi Arabia|Tabala]], south of Mecca). Grunebaum in ''Classical Islam'' points out that the experience of divinity of that period was often associated with stone [[Fetishism|fetishes]], mountains, special rock formations, or \"trees of strange growth.\"<ref>Grunebaum, p. 24</ref>\n\nThe ''Kaaba'' was thought to be at the center of the world, with the Gate of Heaven directly above it. The ''Kaaba'' marked the location where the sacred world intersected with the profane; the embedded Black Stone was a further symbol of this as a [[meteorite]] that had fallen from the sky and linked heaven and earth.<ref>Armstrong, ''Jerusalem'', p. 221</ref>\n\nAccording to Sarwar,<ref>{{cite book|title=Muhammad the Holy Prophet|author=Hafiz Ghulam Sarwar|pages=18\u201319}}</ref> about 400 years before the birth of Muhammad, a man named \"Amr bin Lahyo bin Harath bin Amr ul-Qais bin Thalaba bin Azd bin Khalan bin Babalyun bin Saba\", who was descended from [[Qahtan]] and was the king of [[Hijaz]] had placed a Hubal idol onto the roof of the ''Kaaba''. This idol was one of the chief deities of the ruling tribe [[Quraysh]]. The idol was made of red agate and shaped like a human, but with the right hand broken off and replaced with a golden hand. When the idol was moved inside the ''Kaaba'', it had seven arrows in front of it, which were used for [[divination]].<ref>Francis E. Peters, ''Muhammad and the origins of Islam'', SUNY Press, 1994, p. 109.</ref>\n\nTo maintain peace among the perpetually warring tribes, Mecca was declared a sanctuary where no violence was allowed within {{convert|20|mi|km}} of the ''Kaaba''.

They depict it as a city grown rich on the proceeds of the [[spice trade]]. Crone believes that this is an exaggeration and that Mecca may only have been an outpost trading with nomads for leather, cloth, and camel butter. Crone argues that if Mecca had been a well-known center of trade, it would have been mentioned by later authors such as [[Procopius]], [[Nonnosus]], or the Syrian church chroniclers writing in Syriac. The town is absent, however, from any geographies or histories written in the three centuries before the rise of Islam.<ref>{{cite book| last = Crone| first = Patricia| authorlink = | title = Makkan Trade and the Rise of Islam| publisher = Gorgias |year=2004| location = Piscataway, New Jersey| url =| doi = | id = }} p. 137</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', \"before the rise of Islam it was revered as a sacred sanctuary and was a site of pilgrimage.\"<ref>Britannica 2002 Deluxe Edition [[CD-ROM]], \"Ka'bah.\"</ref> According to [[Germany|German]] historian Eduard Glaser, the name \"''Kaaba''\" may have been related to the southern [[Arabian]] or [[Ethiopia]]n word \"''mikrab''\", signifying a temple.<ref name=\"eoi318\"/> Again, Crone disputes this etymology.\n\nIn [[Samaritan]] literature, the Samaritan Book of the Secrets of Moses (Asatir) claims that Ishmael and his eldest son [[Nebaioth]] built the ''Kaaba'' as well as the city of Mecca.<ref>{{cite book |last= Gaster |first= Moses |title= The Asatir: the Samaritan book of Moses |url= https://archive.org/stream/MN40245ucmf_0#page/n271/mode/2up |quote= Ishmaelites built Mecca (Baka, Bakh) |year= 1927 |publisher=The Royal Asiatic Society |location=London |pages=262, 71 }}</ref> \"The Secrets of Moses\" or Asatir book was suggested by some opinion to have been compiled in the 10th century,<ref>Crown, Alan David (2001).

[[Ibn Ishaq]]'s ''[[Sirat Ras\u016bl All\u0101h]]'', one of the biographies of Muhammad (as reconstructed and translated by Guillaume), describes Muhammad settling a quarrel between Meccan clans as to which clan should set the Black Stone cornerstone in place.\n\nAccording to Ishaq's biography, Muhammad's solution was to have all the clan elders raise the cornerstone on a cloak, after which Muhammad set the stone into its final place with his own hands.<ref>{{cite book |last=Guillaume |first=A. | title=The Life of Muhammad |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1955 |location=Oxford}} pp. 84\u201387</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch1s6.html |title=Muhammad's Birth and Forty Years prior to Prophethood|work=Ar-Raheeq Al-Makhtum (The Sealed Nectar): Memoirs of the Noble Prophet|accessdate=2007-05-04|author=Saifur Rahman al-Mubarakpuri, translated by Issam Diab|year=1979}}</ref> Ibn Ishaq says that the timber for the reconstruction of the ''Kaaba'' came from a Greek ship that had been wrecked on the [[Red Sea]] coast at Shu'ayba and that the work was undertaken by a [[Copt]]ic carpenter called Baqum.<ref>Cyril Glasse, ''New Encyclopedia of Islam'', p. 245.

During the first half of Muhammad's time as a prophet while he was at Mecca, he and his followers were severely persecuted which eventually led to their migration to [[Medina]] in 622 CE. In 624 CE, the direction of the qiblah was changed from Jerusalem to the ''Kaaba'' in Mecca.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Saifur Rahman|title=The Sealed Nectar|pages=[https://archive.org/details/TheSealedNectar_201312/page/n129 130]|url=https://archive.org/details/TheSealedNectar_201312}}</ref> In 628 CE, Muhammad led a group of Muslims towards Mecca with the intention of performing the minor pilgrimage (''Umrah'') at the ''Kaaba'', although he wasn't allowed by the people of Mecca.
