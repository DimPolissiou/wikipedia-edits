Although music journalist [[Alexis Petridis]] noted that parts of the album were over-ambitious, he went on to claim that incredibly, though, most of the time Healy gets away with it. That's sometimes because his observations are sharp \u2013 as a skewering of celebrity squad culture, \"you look famous, let's be friends / And portray we possess something important / And do the things we like\" is pretty acute \u2013 but more usually because they come loaded with witty self-awareness and deprecation: the endless depictions of vacuous, coke-numbed girls he has met would get wearying were it not for the fact that he keeps turning the lyrical crosshair on himself.

Although music journalist [[Alexis Petridis]] noted that parts of the album were over-ambitious, he went on to claim that incredibly, though, most of the time Healy gets away with it. That's sometimes because his observations are sharp \u2013 as a skewering of celebrity squad culture, \"you look famous, let's be friends / And portray we possess something important / And do the things we like\" is pretty acute \u2013 but more usually because they come loaded with witty self-awareness and deprecation: the endless depictions of vacuous, coke-numbed girls he has met would get wearying were it not for the fact that he keeps turning the lyrical crosshair on himself.

The episode was written by Brian Young and directed by [[Joshua Butler]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe whole town is under the influence of Silas ([[Paul Wesley]]) to find Katherine ([[Nina Dobrev]]). A woman sees her on the street but Katherine hits her so she will not call Silas. Matt ([[Zach Roerig]]) and Jeremy ([[Steven R. McQueen]]) find her before she runs away again and capture her to hide her from everyone so Silas will not find her.\n\nElena and Caroline ([[Candice Accola]]) try to get close to the Biology professor, Wes Maxfield ([[Rick Cosnett]]), to find out what he knows since he was the one who covered the real cause of death of Megan. However, they do not have much luck in his class.\n\nSilas visits Elena at the college, who still does not know that Stefan is Silas, and he tricks her to tell him where Jeremy might be. Before he leaves he compels her to kill Damon ([[Ian Somerhalder]]) who also came to the college the moment he found out that Silas was there. Elena gets alone with Damon and she forces him to drink vervain to weaken him. She then ties him up so she can kill him. Damon realizes that she is under Silas' influence and he tries to make her fight it and also tells her the whole truth about Stefan and Silas.\n\nIn the meantime, Elena is with Jesse ([[Kendrick Sampson]]) who tells her that there is a rumor that Professor Maxfield is a member of a secret group in college but no one knows what that really is. Later, before Elena leaves school temporarily to find Stefan, she has a mysterious conversation with Professor Maxfield, about her father.\n\nSilas, with Elena's directions, tracks down Jeremy, Matt and Katherine. He kills Matt after he realizes that he hosts a traveler in his body. He fights with Jeremy and Katherine comes back to help by shooting Silas. Meanwhile, Matt is on the other side while waiting for the ring to bring him back to life, where he sees Bonnie ([[Kat Graham]]). Bonnie tells him all the truth about her being dead but he does not remember any of these when he comes back to life.\n\nAfter Silas is shot, it is shown that he needs to feed. He encounters the two travelers who are chasing him and while the man tells him that they want to put him back in the tomb, the woman, Nadia ([[Olga Fonda]]), kills her partner and says that she has her own agenda.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Damon and Elena, with Sheriff Forbes' ([[Marguerite MacIntyre]]) help find the safe that Stefan is locked in, however when they open it, instead of Stefan they find a dead man who appears to have been fed on by a vampire.\n\n==Featured music==\nIn the \"True Lies\" episode we can hear the songs:<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.tvfanatic.com/music/shows/the-vampire-diaries/episodes/true-lies.html|title = ''The Vampire Diaries''.

The episode was written by Brian Young and directed by [[Joshua Butler]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe whole town is under the influence of Silas ([[Paul Wesley]]) to find Katherine ([[Nina Dobrev]]). A woman sees her on the street but Katherine hits her so she will not call Silas. Matt ([[Zach Roerig]]) and Jeremy ([[Steven R. McQueen]]) find her before she runs away again and capture her to hide her from everyone so Silas will not find her.\n\nElena and Caroline ([[Candice Accola]]) try to get close to the Biology professor, Wes Maxfield ([[Rick Cosnett]]), to find out what he knows since he was the one who covered the real cause of death of Megan. However, they do not have much luck in his class.\n\nSilas visits Elena at the college, who still does not know that Stefan is Silas, and he tricks her to tell him where Jeremy might be. Before he leaves he compels her to kill Damon ([[Ian Somerhalder]]) who also came to the college the moment he found out that Silas was there. Elena gets alone with Damon and she forces him to drink vervain to weaken him. She then ties him up so she can kill him. Damon realizes that she is under Silas' influence and he tries to make her fight it and also tells her the whole truth about Stefan and Silas.\n\nIn the meantime, Elena is with Jesse ([[Kendrick Sampson]]) who tells her that there is a rumor that Professor Maxfield is a member of a secret group in college but no one knows what that really is. Later, before Elena leaves school temporarily to find Stefan, she has a mysterious conversation with Professor Maxfield, about her father.\n\nSilas, with Elena's directions, tracks down Jeremy, Matt and Katherine. He kills Matt after he realizes that he hosts a traveler in his body. He fights with Jeremy and Katherine comes back to help by shooting Silas. Meanwhile, Matt is on the other side while waiting for the ring to bring him back to life, where he sees Bonnie ([[Kat Graham]]). Bonnie tells him all the truth about her being dead but he does not remember any of these when he comes back to life.\n\nAfter Silas is shot, it is shown that he needs to feed. He encounters the two travelers who are chasing him and while the man tells him that they want to put him back in the tomb, the woman, Nadia ([[Olga Fonda]]), kills her partner and says that she has her own agenda.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Damon and Elena, with Sheriff Forbes' ([[Marguerite MacIntyre]]) help find the safe that Stefan is locked in, however when they open it, instead of Stefan they find a dead man who appears to have been fed on by a vampire.\n\n==Featured music==\nIn the \"True Lies\" episode we can hear the songs:<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.tvfanatic.com/music/shows/the-vampire-diaries/episodes/true-lies.html|title = ''The Vampire Diaries''.

''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the skit series during its seventh season in 1973\u201374. It would air new installments of the skit for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"The Family\" would not air until September 8, 1979 on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"The Family\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978. Altogether, there were 31 installments of \"The Family\" sketches.\n\nNot only was \"The Family\" well received enough to become a recurring skit on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', but it was admired enough to be developed into a 1982 [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie, ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', and then [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into a full-fledged comedy series in 1983, titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'': a show which first aired on [[NBC]], until it was cancelled in 1984; then revived in 1986 in [[television syndication|first-run syndication]], lasting until its series finale in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionhits.com/mamasfamily/ |title=The Mama's Family Site |publisher=Televisionhits.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> [[Carol Burnett]], whose [[Eunice Higgins]] character was central in \"The Family\" sketches, did not appear in the sitcom's second incarnation, due to her acrimonious 1984 divorce from ''The Carol Burnett Show'' and ''Mama's Family'' producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], who owned all the ''Mama's Family'' characters. Burnett also resented [[Vicki Lawrence]] for accepting the role of Mama in first-run syndication as she would be working for Hamilton.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=dTAwUcvzFOTw2QXQloGoCw&id=xT4EGArhKIAC&dq=Vicki+Lawrence+autobiography&q=Eunice+ |title=Vicki!: the true-life adventures of Miss Fireball \u2013 Vicki Lawrence, Marc Eliot \u2013 Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>\n\nAlong with featuring Carol Burnett as Eunice Higgins, \"The Family\" skits featured [[Vicki Lawrence]] as [[Thelma Harper]] (originally, only known as \"Mama\" for the most part, although Mickey Hart, Ed's employee, had referred to her as \"Thelma\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7OqigcLrMc |title=The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Family \u2013 Mickey's Apartment 1/2 (uncut) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-11-12 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>), and [[Harvey Korman]] as [[Ed Higgins]]. In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama has five children (in the subsequent series, she has only three): in addition to [[Ellen Harper]] (played by [[Betty White]]) and Eunice, there were three sons: Larry Harper ([[Alan Alda]]), Phillip Harper ([[Roddy McDowall]]), and Jack Harper ([[Tom Smothers]]).  All three were replaced by [[Vinton Harper]], played by [[Ken Berry]], in the spin-off television series. Berry played Phillip in the made-for-TV movie, ''Eunice'' (precursor to ''Mama's Family''). [[Tim Conway]] played recurring character Mickey Hart, Ed's employee.\n\n==Background==\n\"The Family\" sketch was created and written by [[Dick Clair]] and [[Jenna McMahon]]. They originally had Burnett in mind to play Mama and have a guest star to play Eunice. However, Burnett decided that she wanted to play Eunice and wanted to give the part of Mama to Lawrence. Burnett also decided to do the sketch [[Southern American English|southern]] because of her own [[Texas]] background. The writers were so displeased with these decisions that during the first run-through, they threw down their pads and pencils and stormed out of the rehearsal hall. They complained that the sketch was ruined and that it would offend the [[American south|South]]. After airing and the enormously favorable viewer response, Clair and McMahon wound up writing the sketches for the rest of the run of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nAmong plot techniques, \"The Family\" uses: (A) [[satire]] and [[observational comedy]], as the sketch subtly pokes fun of  real life occurrences and real-life human behaviors, inflating them and making fun of them; (B) [[comedy of manners]], as the characters satirize the behaviors of [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]], [[working class|working-class]] southerners and speak in southern [[drawl]]s.\n\nUnlike ''Mama's Family'', the central character of \"The Family\" sketches is Eunice. \"The Family\" sketches are about the noisy, quarrelsome couple of Eunice and Ed and Eunice's unwelcome house guest who only adds to the drama, that being her catty elderly mama. There was a great deal more squabbling in \"The Family\" sketches than on ''Mama's Family''. It was stated many times that Eunice and Ed had two young sons, named [[Bubba Higgins]] and Billy-Joe Higgins (though in one skit, Eunice calls her children Bubba and Raymond); they are [[unseen character]]s in \"The Family\" sketches. The Bubba Higgins character, however, regularly appears in the first-run syndication version of ''Mama's Family''. Mama, Eunice, and Ed often have uproarious verbal wars over petty issues, such as board games (they played ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', ''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]]'',  and ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]''), how much butter has been used for the bread, what exactly happened 30 or 40 years ago, etc. The final \"Family\" sketch to air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had Eunice talking to a psychiatrist trying to figure out what went wrong with her life.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n* '''[[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the very fiery, stormy, irrepressible, browbeating daughter of Mama and wife of Ed, Eunice is histrionic and full of powerful emotions: cheerful and giddy one minute and uncontrollably upset the next. Eunice seemingly never changes outfits as she's always seen in the same [[Olive (color)|olive green]] dress. Greatly ambitious, Eunice aspires to achieve [[Celebrity|fame]], power, and a career in [[entertainment industry|entertainment]]; however, she's portrayed as a woman who can't excel past substandard living due to a selfless nature to see after her elderly mother (heavily emphasized in the ''Eunice'' movie). In addition, she feels deprived of even minimal contentment due to what she perceives as an inconsiderate, [[wikt:lowbrow#Adjective|lowbrow]] husband who couldn't care less about her happiness.\n\n:She wishes for nothing more than to move up the ladder and live out her dreams, but lacks the initiative and get-up-and-go, choosing rather to care for her aging mother. Her siblings, who rarely visit or call Mama, all live successful lives. Eunice is the only offspring willing to care for Mama, but Mama ungratefully treats her the worst. This is often shown in Mama's tendency to praise her other children for their successes, and in the same breath belittling Eunice for having no talent and thereby making nothing of herself. This is just one of many reasons why heated altercations break out among the three characters. When Eunice starts ranting, she brings up loads of irrelevant matters that she holds resentment over. Often her long-drawn-out rants will relate to issues dating as far back as her childhood. Of the three characters, Eunice exercises the most control in the gang.\n\n* '''[[Thelma Harper|Mama]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama is a cold, [[spite (sentiment)|spiteful]], cantankerous, elderly [[widow]]. Mama has other sides to her in ''Mama's Family'', such as her tendency to make good-natured wisecracks and snappy retorts; however, her commentary in \"The Family\" sketches is limited to constant captious complaints, belligerent remarks that instigate the other characters, and an easily annoyed demeanor. She also makes insinuative, disparaging remarks intended to offend and anger her daughter and son-in-law. For example, she constantly lets Ed and Eunice know what's wrong with them and how they've amounted to nothing.\n\n:In contrast to ''Mama's Family'', where she's portrayed as more independent and active, she's portrayed as a dependent senior in \"The Family\" sketches.  Ever an aggressor, Mama's often the one stirring up all the conflict and commotion among the three. Sometimes when they're all starting to get along (an ephemeral occurrence on the show, often arising from a [[wikt: mercurial|mercurial]] trait in all the characters), Mama will say something that she's fully aware will provoke Eunice and Ed. In fact, one of Eunice's most commonly used locutions is based on this behavior of Mama's: ''\"Don't you start with me, ol' lady!\"''\n\n:Mama originally lives on her own in \"The Family\" sketches, but ends up moving in with Eunice and Ed when old age catches up to her. It's worth noting as well that the home Mama is said and shown to have raised her children in is different among \"The Family\" sketches, the ''Eunice'' movie, and ''Mama's Family''. Moreover, there are slight changes between the home used in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1 & 2)|first life]] of ''Mama's Family'' and its [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life]].\n\n* '''[[Ed Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the fiercely ill-tempered, slovenly, goofy, quirky son-in-law of Mama and the husband to Eunice. Ed is quick to become irritated by his wife and mother-in-law and doesn't hesitate to show it fiercely. When they're not at each other's throats, Eunice and Mama regularly bash Ed. Mama antagonizes Ed with putdowns over what a failure and unsuccessful slob he is, and Eunice regularly nags him about his \"inconsiderate\" treatment of her and her needs. Though Ed occasionally capitulates to his wife's browbeating and mother-in-law's carping, he has no qualms with exploding at and bickering with them, although it only gets him into shouting matches and heated altercations with Mama and Eunice, who will quickly move to bickering with each other in the process. Ed has nothing much to show for his life, and his low-class job and manner gives Eunice's rants and Mama's insults credibility. While in \"The Family\" sketches, as well as the Eunice movie, Ed leaves and divorces Eunice, he's seen married to her in all of their ''Mama's Family'' appearances. \n* '''Phillip Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Phillip was the eldest of Mama's three sons. He was a successful [[Hollywood]]-based [[screenwriter]] and [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]/[[Nobel Peace Prize]]-winning author. Although Phillip was Mama's favorite (along with Ellen), he was never spared Thelma's criticism, insults, or wrath.\n* '''Larry Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Larry was Mama's first-to-last son. He was a free-spirit who is a [[commercial illustrator]], and he was teased by Ed, who thought that painting was somewhat sissy. He appeared in the ''Christmas'' sketch, coming home for [[Christmas]] after five years, and he is unmarried.\n* '''Jack Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Jack was Mama's youngest son. He was visited by Eunice, Ed, and Mama in the hospital. It is mentioned that he and his wife Janie have children, and that he works in sales.\n* '''[[Ellen Harper]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Ellen was older than Eunice, and was as snobby and stuck on herself as she was on ''Mama's Family'' with a difference: She would snap back at her mother with more frequency and didn't even try to hide her glee when she got something that Eunice wanted.  She was married (her husband originally referred to as Tom, then Arthur, and later as Bruce) and had two spoiled daughters, Mary Beth and Debbie.  At one time, it was revealed that Ellen's full name was Mary Ellen.\n* '''Mickey Hart''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mickey was Ed's employee at the hardware store. He wears a [[hearing aid]] and calls Mama \"Mother Harper\" and has referred to her as \"Thelma.\"\n* '''Dan Fogarty''' \u2013 An old friend of Ed's \u2013 portrayed by Dick Van Dyke \u2013 who stayed with Eunice for a short time after Ed abandoned her in the final season (Harvey Korman had left the series).  Eunice evidently was rather sweet on him, but since Van Dyke left the show in the middle of the season, the relationship was never developed.\n*'''Carl Harper''' \u2013 A predominately [[unseen character]], he is the deceased husband of Mama and father of Ellen, Eunice, Jack, Larry, and Philip.

''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the skit series during its seventh season in 1973\u201374. It would air new installments of the skit for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"The Family\" would not air until September 8, 1979 on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"The Family\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978. Altogether, there were 31 installments of \"The Family\" sketches.\n\nNot only was \"The Family\" well received enough to become a recurring skit on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', but it was admired enough to be developed into a 1982 [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie, ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', and then [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into a full-fledged comedy series in 1983, titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'': a show which first aired on [[NBC]], until it was cancelled in 1984; then revived in 1986 in [[television syndication|first-run syndication]], lasting until its series finale in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionhits.com/mamasfamily/ |title=The Mama's Family Site |publisher=Televisionhits.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> [[Carol Burnett]], whose [[Eunice Higgins]] character was central in \"The Family\" sketches, did not appear in the sitcom's second incarnation, due to her acrimonious 1984 divorce from ''The Carol Burnett Show'' and ''Mama's Family'' producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], who owned all the ''Mama's Family'' characters. Burnett also resented [[Vicki Lawrence]] for accepting the role of Mama in first-run syndication as she would be working for Hamilton.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=dTAwUcvzFOTw2QXQloGoCw&id=xT4EGArhKIAC&dq=Vicki+Lawrence+autobiography&q=Eunice+ |title=Vicki!: the true-life adventures of Miss Fireball \u2013 Vicki Lawrence, Marc Eliot \u2013 Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>\n\nAlong with featuring Carol Burnett as Eunice Higgins, \"The Family\" skits featured [[Vicki Lawrence]] as [[Thelma Harper]] (originally, only known as \"Mama\" for the most part, although Mickey Hart, Ed's employee, had referred to her as \"Thelma\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7OqigcLrMc |title=The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Family \u2013 Mickey's Apartment 1/2 (uncut) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-11-12 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>), and [[Harvey Korman]] as [[Ed Higgins]]. In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama has five children (in the subsequent series, she has only three): in addition to [[Ellen Harper]] (played by [[Betty White]]) and Eunice, there were three sons: Larry Harper ([[Alan Alda]]), Phillip Harper ([[Roddy McDowall]]), and Jack Harper ([[Tommy Smothers]]).  All three were replaced by [[Vinton Harper]], played by [[Ken Berry]], in the spin-off television series. Berry played Phillip in the made-for-TV movie, ''Eunice'' (precursor to ''Mama's Family''). [[Tim Conway]] played recurring character Mickey Hart, Ed's employee.\n\n==Background==\n\"The Family\" sketch was created and written by [[Dick Clair]] and [[Jenna McMahon]]. They originally had Burnett in mind to play Mama and have a guest star to play Eunice. However, Burnett decided that she wanted to play Eunice and wanted to give the part of Mama to Lawrence. Burnett also decided to do the sketch [[Southern American English|southern]] because of her own [[Texas]] background. The writers were so displeased with these decisions that during the first run-through, they threw down their pads and pencils and stormed out of the rehearsal hall. They complained that the sketch was ruined and that it would offend the [[American south|South]]. After airing and the enormously favorable viewer response, Clair and McMahon wound up writing the sketches for the rest of the run of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nAmong plot techniques, \"The Family\" uses: (A) [[satire]] and [[observational comedy]], as the sketch subtly pokes fun of  real life occurrences and real-life human behaviors, inflating them and making fun of them; (B) [[comedy of manners]], as the characters satirize the behaviors of [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]], [[working class|working-class]] southerners and speak in southern [[drawl]]s.\n\nUnlike ''Mama's Family'', the central character of \"The Family\" sketches is Eunice. \"The Family\" sketches are about the noisy, quarrelsome couple of Eunice and Ed and Eunice's unwelcome house guest who only adds to the drama, that being her catty elderly mama. There was a great deal more squabbling in \"The Family\" sketches than on ''Mama's Family''. It was stated many times that Eunice and Ed had two young sons, named [[Bubba Higgins]] and Billy-Joe Higgins (though in one skit, Eunice calls her children Bubba and Raymond); they are [[unseen character]]s in \"The Family\" sketches. The Bubba Higgins character, however, regularly appears in the first-run syndication version of ''Mama's Family''. Mama, Eunice, and Ed often have uproarious verbal wars over petty issues, such as board games (they played ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', ''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]]'',  and ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]''), how much butter has been used for the bread, what exactly happened 30 or 40 years ago, etc. The final \"Family\" sketch to air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had Eunice talking to a psychiatrist trying to figure out what went wrong with her life.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n* '''[[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the very fiery, stormy, irrepressible, browbeating daughter of Mama and wife of Ed, Eunice is histrionic and full of powerful emotions: cheerful and giddy one minute and uncontrollably upset the next. Eunice seemingly never changes outfits as she's always seen in the same [[Olive (color)|olive green]] dress. Greatly ambitious, Eunice aspires to achieve [[Celebrity|fame]], power, and a career in [[entertainment industry|entertainment]]; however, she's portrayed as a woman who can't excel past substandard living due to a selfless nature to see after her elderly mother (heavily emphasized in the ''Eunice'' movie). In addition, she feels deprived of even minimal contentment due to what she perceives as an inconsiderate, [[wikt:lowbrow#Adjective|lowbrow]] husband who couldn't care less about her happiness.\n\n:She wishes for nothing more than to move up the ladder and live out her dreams, but lacks the initiative and get-up-and-go, choosing rather to care for her aging mother. Her siblings, who rarely visit or call Mama, all live successful lives. Eunice is the only offspring willing to care for Mama, but Mama ungratefully treats her the worst. This is often shown in Mama's tendency to praise her other children for their successes, and in the same breath belittling Eunice for having no talent and thereby making nothing of herself. This is just one of many reasons why heated altercations break out among the three characters. When Eunice starts ranting, she brings up loads of irrelevant matters that she holds resentment over. Often her long-drawn-out rants will relate to issues dating as far back as her childhood. Of the three characters, Eunice exercises the most control in the gang.\n\n* '''[[Thelma Harper|Mama]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama is a cold, [[spite (sentiment)|spiteful]], cantankerous, elderly [[widow]]. Mama has other sides to her in ''Mama's Family'', such as her tendency to make good-natured wisecracks and snappy retorts; however, her commentary in \"The Family\" sketches is limited to constant captious complaints, belligerent remarks that instigate the other characters, and an easily annoyed demeanor. She also makes insinuative, disparaging remarks intended to offend and anger her daughter and son-in-law. For example, she constantly lets Ed and Eunice know what's wrong with them and how they've amounted to nothing.\n\n:In contrast to ''Mama's Family'', where she's portrayed as more independent and active, she's portrayed as a dependent senior in \"The Family\" sketches.  Ever an aggressor, Mama's often the one stirring up all the conflict and commotion among the three. Sometimes when they're all starting to get along (an ephemeral occurrence on the show, often arising from a [[wikt: mercurial|mercurial]] trait in all the characters), Mama will say something that she's fully aware will provoke Eunice and Ed. In fact, one of Eunice's most commonly used locutions is based on this behavior of Mama's: ''\"Don't you start with me, ol' lady!\"''\n\n:Mama originally lives on her own in \"The Family\" sketches, but ends up moving in with Eunice and Ed when old age catches up to her. It's worth noting as well that the home Mama is said and shown to have raised her children in is different among \"The Family\" sketches, the ''Eunice'' movie, and ''Mama's Family''. Moreover, there are slight changes between the home used in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1 & 2)|first life]] of ''Mama's Family'' and its [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life]].\n\n* '''[[Ed Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the fiercely ill-tempered, slovenly, goofy, quirky son-in-law of Mama and the husband to Eunice. Ed is quick to become irritated by his wife and mother-in-law and doesn't hesitate to show it fiercely. When they're not at each other's throats, Eunice and Mama regularly bash Ed. Mama antagonizes Ed with putdowns over what a failure and unsuccessful slob he is, and Eunice regularly nags him about his \"inconsiderate\" treatment of her and her needs. Though Ed occasionally capitulates to his wife's browbeating and mother-in-law's carping, he has no qualms with exploding at and bickering with them, although it only gets him into shouting matches and heated altercations with Mama and Eunice, who will quickly move to bickering with each other in the process. Ed has nothing much to show for his life, and his low-class job and manner gives Eunice's rants and Mama's insults credibility. While in \"The Family\" sketches, as well as the Eunice movie, Ed leaves and divorces Eunice, he's seen married to her in all of their ''Mama's Family'' appearances. \n* '''Phillip Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Phillip was the eldest of Mama's three sons. He was a successful [[Hollywood]]-based [[screenwriter]] and [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]/[[Nobel Peace Prize]]-winning author. Although Phillip was Mama's favorite (along with Ellen), he was never spared Thelma's criticism, insults, or wrath.\n* '''Larry Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Larry was Mama's first-to-last son. He was a free-spirit who is a [[commercial illustrator]], and he was teased by Ed, who thought that painting was somewhat sissy. He appeared in the ''Christmas'' sketch, coming home for [[Christmas]] after five years, and he is unmarried.\n* '''Jack Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Jack was Mama's youngest son. He was visited by Eunice, Ed, and Mama in the hospital. It is mentioned that he and his wife Janie have children, and that he works in sales.\n* '''[[Ellen Harper]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Ellen was older than Eunice, and was as snobby and stuck on herself as she was on ''Mama's Family'' with a difference: She would snap back at her mother with more frequency and didn't even try to hide her glee when she got something that Eunice wanted.  She was married (her husband originally referred to as Tom, then Arthur, and later as Bruce) and had two spoiled daughters, Mary Beth and Debbie.  At one time, it was revealed that Ellen's full name was Mary Ellen.\n* '''Mickey Hart''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mickey was Ed's employee at the hardware store. He wears a [[hearing aid]] and calls Mama \"Mother Harper\" and has referred to her as \"Thelma.\"\n* '''Dan Fogarty''' \u2013 An old friend of Ed's \u2013 portrayed by Dick Van Dyke \u2013 who stayed with Eunice for a short time after Ed abandoned her in the final season (Harvey Korman had left the series).  Eunice evidently was rather sweet on him, but since Van Dyke left the show in the middle of the season, the relationship was never developed.\n*'''Carl Harper''' \u2013 A predominately [[unseen character]], he is the deceased husband of Mama and father of Ellen, Eunice, Jack, Larry, and Philip. He spends the vast majority of his time nested on the [[toilet]] in the bathroom with the door closed. In fact, he died on the toilet.

Wyman]] and was directed by [[Jeannot Szwarc]] and [[Miguel Sapochnik]].\n\n==Plot==\nPeter ([[Joshua Jackson]]), Walter ([[John Noble]]), and Astrid ([[Jasika Nicole]]), after being recovered by Etta ([[Georgina Haig]]), begin to adjust to the Observer-controlled world of 2036. Walter notes that he and the Observer September had created a plan prior to the Observers' takeover, but September had fragmented Walter's memory to protect the information. After the Observers' arrival, Walter had Olivia ([[Anna Torv]]) retrieve a device to help restore these memories, but she had disappeared.  In the present, they trace Olivia's path, finding a nearby patch of amber, but cut into with several human-sized chunks removed. Etta explains there are \"amber gypsies\", who cut and sell trapped humans on the black market. They track down Olivia's piece of amber to Edward Markham ([[Clark Middleton]]), who had been in love with Olivia since the first time he saw her.\n\nWhile they are retrieving the amber, the Observers, alerted by the black market dealer, arrive. Though they safely escape with Olivia, Walter is captured and taken to a secure Observer facility, where Captain Windmark ([[Michael Kopsa]]) arrives to interrogate him. Windmark starts violently probing Walter's mind. He taunts Walter with the fact that there is no music in this future, that nothing will grow from the scorched earth. On continued probing, Windmark discovers the fragmented memories and attempts to obtain the memories by any means possible.\n\nOlivia is freed from the amber, and has a tearful reunion with Peter while meeting her grown up daughter for the first time. As they talk, it is revealed that Peter, Olivia, and young Etta were enjoying a picnic in a park on the day of the Observers' invasion, and Etta went missing in the confusion. Subsequently, Peter and Olivia had separated; Peter going to search for Etta, who had been taken by the Observers, and Olivia joining Walter in fighting them. Etta takes them to a hidden facility where human resistance members have found the device that Olivia had been trying to locate, the Transilience Thought-Unifier Model-11, which is capable of restoring Walter's thoughts, though they believe the device to be non-functional. While there, they are able to track Walter's capture to a secured Observer facility. Etta uses her Fringe credentials to break into the facility and recover Walter. Afterwards, Windmark connects Etta to images of a young girl from Walter's mind.\n\nOnce safe, Walter finds that the Unifier device activates to his touch, but when they try to use it, it fails to find any memories; Etta suspects that the memories were destroyed, and the plan is lost for good. A despondent Walter tries to sleep but is distracted by reflections from outside, which he traces to a makeshift sculpture made of broken CDs. In a bag nearby he finds an undamaged CD and plays it on a car's stereo; he cries as it plays [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]]'s \"[[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]]\", the first music he's heard since awaking in 2036. As he mulls emotionally, he spies a single dandelion, growing from the rubble, and cries to himself.\n\n==Production==\n\"Transilience Thought Unifier Model-11\" was written by showrunner [[J.H.

She called Haig a \"revelation\" and noted her resemblance to Torv, who Adly MacKenzie asserted was \"per usual, heartbreakingly perfect.\"<ref name=zap2itreview/> The Zap2It reviewer also found Walter's torture \"tough to watch, but we can't tear our eyes away from John Noble's award-worthy performance.\"<ref name=zap2itreview>{{cite web | url = http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2012/09/fringe-season-5-premiere-review-will-the-future-get-the-better-of-the-bishop-family.html | title = 'Fringe' Season 5 premiere review: Will the future get the better of the Bishop family? | date = 2012-09-28 | accessdate = 2012-09-29 | publisher = [[Zap2It]] | first = Carina | last = Adly MacKenzie | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120930001832/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2012/09/fringe-season-5-premiere-review-will-the-future-get-the-better-of-the-bishop-family.html | archivedate = 2012-09-30 }}</ref> Writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', Jeff Jensen criticized Peter and Olivia's break-up backstory, believing it was not compatible with their known timeline and also because \"it felt to me like ''Fringe'' was making more out of the matter than it should have, trying too hard to make some emotional drama, to give Anna Torv and Joshua Jackson something to play.\"<ref name=ewreview>{{cite web | url =http://tvrecaps.ew.com/recap/fringe-season-5-episode-1-season-premiere/2/ | title = 'Fringe' season premiere recap: Future Shock Blues | date = 2012-09-28 | accessdate = 2012-09-29 | work= [[Entertainment Weekly]] | first = Jeff| last= Jensen}}</ref> Jensen concluded his review by noting the series' departure from the old episode formula of \"imbu[ing] the inhuman with as much emotional resonance as their human character\" in favor of \"a swift-moving serialized thriller,\" and hoped the change \"has the weight and power that we've come to expect.\"<ref name=ewreview/>\n\nRamsey Isler of [[IGN]] was more critical of the episode and rated it 7.7 out of 10. Due to the season's shortened length, he said he was a \"tiny bit concerned that this season premiere wasn't as powerful as I hoped.\"<ref name=ignreview/> Isler added that while the episode \"does a good job of filling in the informational gaps... there's still something missing. There's still no link between where we were for 4 seasons, and where we are now.\"<ref name=ignreview>{{cite web | url =http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/29/fringe-transilience-thought-modifier-model-11-review | title = Fringe: \"Transilience Thought Unifier Model-11\" Review  | date = 2012-09-28 | accessdate = 2012-09-29 | publisher= [[IGN]] | first = Ramsey | last= Isler}}</ref> He was unsure about Henrietta's addition, writing that because she was \"thrust into the mix and viewers were just expected to accept her as is,\" she did not yet feel a part of the series. Isler did however praise the final sequence with Walter, writing that it \"is a great scene; artfully directed and made even more special by the fact that ''Fringe'' rarely uses pop music to set the mood. This scene is simple, but impressive enough to stand out as the best part of this episode and set the tone for the rest of the season. There's still hope for this story and this world, and as usual ''Fringe'' viewers will have to be patient to see that hope spring forth.\"<ref name=ignreview/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120925054721/http://www.fox.com/fringe/recaps/season-5/episode-1 \"Transilience Thought Unifier Model-11\"] at [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox.com]]\n* {{IMDb episode|2383819}}\n* {{tv.com episode|fringe/transilience-thought-unifier-model-11-2487215}}\n\n{{Fringe (TV series)}}\n\n[[Category:2012 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Fringe (season 5) episodes]]\n[[Category:Television episodes directed by Miguel Sapochnik]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 2036]]\n", "name_user": "Gonnym", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transilience_Thought_Unifier_Model-11"}
