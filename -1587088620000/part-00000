Following a series of destructive annual raids into Byzantine [[Asia Minor]] by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], Empress Irene apparently secured a truce with Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 798 in exchange for the annual payment of [[tribute]], repeating the terms agreed for a three-year truce after Harun's [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (782)|first large-scale campaign]] into Asia Minor in 782.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=113}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 1.

In the summer of the same year, he launched the first Byzantine raid in two decades against the Arab frontier districts (''[[thughur]]'') in Cilicia. The Byzantine army raided the territory surrounding the fortresses of [[Mopsuestia]] and [[Anazarbus]] and took prisoners as it went. The garrison of Mopsuestia attacked the Byzantine force and recovered most of the prisoners and spoils, but the Byzantines marched on to [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], which had been refortified and repopulated on Harun's orders in 786 to strengthen the Muslim hold on Cilicia. The city fell and the entire garrison was taken captive.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=135, 138\u2013139}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=261\u2013262}} At the same time, another Byzantine force raided the Upper Mesopotamian ''thughur'' and unsuccessfully besieged the fortress of [[Melitene]], while a Byzantine-instigated rebellion against the local Arab garrison began in [[Cyprus]], which for over a century had been an Arab\u2013Byzantine [[condominium (international law)|condominium]].{{efn|In 688, Emperor [[Justinian II]] and the [[Umayyad]] caliph [[Abd al-Malik]] concluded an agreement whereby Cyprus became a neutral territory, its tax revenue shared between Byzantium and the Caliphate, and its ports open to both powers, including for military purposes against one another. Apart from a brief Byzantine reoccupation under [[Basil I the Macedonian]], this status lasted until 965, when the island was reincorporated into the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Cyprus\" (T. E. Gregory), pp. 567\u2013569}}}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=135, 138\u2013139}}\n\nThis sudden resumption of Byzantine offensive activity greatly alarmed Harun, especially as he received reports that Nikephoros was planning similar attacks for the next year, which this time would aim at the full reoccupation of these frontier territories. As the historian [[Warren Treadgold]] writes, if the Byzantines had been successful in this endeavour, \"garrisoning Tarsus and Melitene would have partly blocked the main Arab invasion routes across the Taurus into the Byzantine heartland, to the Byzantines' great benefit\". On the other hand, Nikephoros was certainly aware of the huge superiority of the Caliphate in men and resources, and it is more likely that he intended this campaign simply as a show of strength and a test of his enemy's resolve.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=139}}\n\n==Campaign==\nHaving settled matters in Khurasan by confirming Ibn Mahan in his governorship,{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=253\u2013254}} Harun returned to the west in November 805 and prepared a huge retaliatory expedition for 806, drawing men from [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Medieval Persia|Persia]], and [[Medieval Egypt|Egypt]].

Al-Tabari reports that Harun put on a cap with the inscription \"Warrior for the Faith and Pilgrim\" (in Arabic, \"''[[Ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]]'', ''[[hajj]]''\"). The Abbasids crossed Cilicia, where Harun ordered Tarsus to be rebuilt, and entered Byzantine [[Cappadocia]] through the [[Cilician Gates]]. Harun marched to [[Tyana]], which at the time seems to have been abandoned. There, he began to establish his base of operations, ordering [[Uqbah ibn Ja'far al-Khuza'i]] to refortify the town and erect a [[mosque]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144\u2013145}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=262\u2013263}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

The city was plundered and razed, and its inhabitants enslaved and deported to the Caliphate.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=661}} The fall of Herakleia was considered by the Arab chroniclers the most significant achievement of Harun's expeditions against the Byzantines,{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=356}} and is the central event in the narratives of Harun's retaliatory campaign against Nikephoros. As the historian [[Marius Canard]] remarks, \"for the Arabs the capture of Herakleia had an impact as profound as the [[Sack of Amorium]] in 838\", which is completely at odds with the city's actual importance. Indeed, the Byzantine sources do not place any particular emphasis on the fall of Herakleia compared to the other fortresses captured during Harun's 806 campaign.{{efn|name=fn2|There is at least some indication in the Arab sources that a different course was suggested to the Caliph: Harun is said to have asked two leaders from the frontier region on whether he should attack Herakleia. The first replied that it was the strongest fortress, and that if it fell, no-one would be able to oppose them, but the second replied that the city would yield little booty, and that he should attack a more important city. However, during the course of the siege he is said to have changed his mind and encouraged Harun to persist with the siege, when the Caliph was thinking of abandoning it.{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=364}}}}{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=378}}\n\nAt the same time, on Cyprus, Humayd ravaged the island and took some 16,000 Cypriots, including the [[Archbishop of Cyprus|local archbishop]], captive to Syria, where they were sold as slaves.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=662}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=145}}\n\nNikephoros, outnumbered and threatened by the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] in his rear, could not resist the Abbasid onslaught. He campaigned himself at the head of his army and seemingly won a few minor engagements against isolated detachments, but stayed well clear of the main Abbasid forces. In the end, with the harrowing possibility of the Arabs wintering on Byzantine soil in Tyana, he sent three [[cleric]]s as ambassadors: [[Michael of Synnada|Michael]], the bishop of [[Synnada]], [[Peter of Goulaion|Peter]], the abbot of the [[monastery]] of Goulaion, and Gregory, the steward of the metropolis of [[Amastris (city)|Amastris]]. Harun agreed to peace in exchange for the payment of an annual tribute (30,000 [[gold]] ''[[solidus (coin)|nomismata]]'', according to Theophanes, 50,000 according to al-Tabari), but the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], were to pay a humiliating personal poll-tax (''[[jizya]]'') of three gold coins each to the Caliph (four and two respectively, in Tabari's version), thereby acknowledging themselves as the Caliph's subjects. In addition, Nikephoros promised not to rebuild the dismantled forts. Harun then recalled his forces from their various sieges and evacuated Byzantine territory.{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

According to Tabari, Harun\n\n<blockquote>\"ordered the slave girl to be sought out; she was brought back, adorned with finery and installed on a seat in the tent in which he himself was lodging. The slave girl and the tent, together with its contents, vessels and fittings, were handed over to Nikephoros's envoy. He also sent to Nikephoros the perfume which he had requested, and he further sent to him dates, dishes of jellied sweets, raisins and healing drugs.\"{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=264}}</blockquote>\n\nNikephoros returned the favour by dispatching a horse laden with 50,000 silver coins, 100 [[satin]] garments, 200 garments of fine [[brocade]], 12 [[falcon]]s, four hunting dogs, and three more horses.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=264}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=146}} But as soon as the Arabs had withdrawn, the Emperor again restored the frontier forts and thereafter ceased the payment of tribute.

The larger summer raid under [[Harthama ibn A'yan]] was met by Nikephoros in person, and after an indecisive battle both sides retreated. The Byzantines raided the region of [[Marash]] in return, while in late summer Humayd launched a major naval raid, which pillaged [[Rhodes]] and reached as far as the [[Peloponnese]], where it may have fomented a [[Siege of Patras (805 or 807)|rebellion]] among the local [[Slavs]]. On his return, however, Humayd lost several ships to a storm, and on the Peloponnese, the Slavic revolt was put down after failing to capture the city of [[Patras]] during the siege of 805.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=147\u2013148}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=267\u2013268}} The failure of the year's Abbasid efforts were compounded by the outbreak of [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]]'s rebellion in Khurasan, which forced Harun to depart again for the East. The Caliph concluded a new truce, and another prisoner exchange was held at the Lamos in 808. Nikephoros was thus left with his gains, both the restored frontier fortifications and the cessation of tribute, intact.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=155}}\n\n==Impact==\n[[File:Arabische Eroberung 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Multi-color map of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, showing the phases of Muslim expansion to the 10th century|Map of the [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]] during the 7th and 8th centuries and of the Muslim world under the [[Umayyad]] and early [[Abbasid]] caliphates, from the {{Interlanguage link|Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas|de|lt=''Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas''}} of [[Gustav Droysen]] (1886)]]\n\nHarun's massive expedition achieved remarkably little in material terms.

In general terms, they were content with the territorial limits achieved, and whatever external campaigns they waged were retaliatory or pre-emptive, meant to preserve their frontier and impress Abbasid might upon their neighbours.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|p=302}} At the same time, the campaigns against Byzantium in particular were important for domestic consumption. The annual raids were a symbol of the continuing ''[[jihad]]'' of the early Muslim state and were the only external expeditions where the Caliph or his sons participated in person. They were closely paralleled in official [[propaganda]] by the leadership by Abbasid family members of the annual pilgrimage (''[[hajj]]'') to [[Mecca]], highlighting the dynasty's leading role in the religious life of the Muslim community.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|pp=278\u2013279}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=105\u2013106}} Harun al-Rashid in particular actively strove to embody this duty: he was said to have alternated between leading the ''hajj'' one year and attacking Byzantium the next.{{sfn|El-Cheikh|2004|pp=89\u201390}} The hitherto unseen extent of his personal involvement in the ''jihad'' converted it into a central tenet of his conception of the caliphate, leading modern historians to consider Harun as the creator of a new type of model ruler, the \"''ghazi''-caliph\".{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=xvii}}{{sfn|Bonner|1996|pp=99\u2013106}}{{sfn|Haug|2011|pp=637\u2013638}}}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144, 146}} In that regard, the Abbasid campaign was certainly a success: after 806, the Byzantine ruler abandoned whatever expansionist plans he may have had for the eastern border and focused his energy on his fiscal reforms, the recovery of the [[Balkans]], and his wars there against the Bulgars, which would end with his death in the disastrous [[Battle of Pliska]] in 811.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=168\u2013174}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=146, 157\u2013174}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 3.

Shaban]] considers the campaign a \"limited success\" at best, and criticizes Harun's \"single-minded\" attention to the Byzantines as a \"totally misguided effort\". According to Shaban, not only did the Byzantines have no real ability (or intention) to seriously threaten the Caliphate, but Harun's recruitment drive led to the influx of eastern soldiers from Khurasan, which antagonized the traditional Syrian\u2013Iraqi military elites and created rifts that contributed to the [[Fourth Fitna|Abbasid civil war]] that broke out after Harun's death.{{sfn|Shaban|1976|pp=32, 38\u201339}} This conflict, between Harun's sons [[al-Amin]] ({{reign|809|813}}) and [[al-Ma'mun]] ({{reign|813|833}}), meant that the Abbasid Caliphate was not able to exploit the Byzantine reversals in the Balkans. Indeed, the 806 campaign and the ineffectual raids of 807 mark the last major, centrally organized, Abbasid expeditions against Byzantium for over twenty years.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=157}} Isolated raids and counter-raids continued at land as well as at sea, and, independently of the Abbasids, local Muslim leaders [[Emirate of Crete|conquered]] [[Crete]] and launched the [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|conquest]] of [[Sicily]] in the 820s.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=127\u2013128}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=183, 219\u2013220, 248\u2013257}} Nevertheless, large-scale operations over the land border in eastern Asia Minor between the two empires resumed only after the accession of Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] ({{reign|829|842}}), whose confrontations with the caliphs al-Ma'mun and [[al-Mu'tasim]] ({{reign|833|842}}) culminated in the great invasions by al-Ma'mun in 830\u2013833, and the Sack of Amorium by al-Mu'tasim in 838.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=128\u2013131}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=272\u2013275, 278\u2013281, 292\u2013305}}\n\n[[File:Heraqla,SE.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Photo of a mound of ruins in a barren field|View of the remnants of ''Hiraqla'', a victory monument erected by Harun after the campaign of 806]]\nThe longest-lasting impact of Harun's campaign is found in literature. Among the Arabs, several legends or anecdotes, related by sources such as [[al-Masudi]] and the ''[[Kitab al-Aghani]]'', were associated with it, emphasizing the city's strong fortifications, describing a single combat between a Byzantine and an Arab champion which was decided when the Arab captured the Byzantine by using a [[lasso]], or the terror inspired among the defenders by the Abbasid army's use of large catapults throwing [[Greek fire]]-like substances.{{sfn|Canard|1962|pp=363\u2013372}} The [[Ottoman Turks]] also placed great importance on Harun's battles with the Byzantines. The account of the 17th-century Ottoman traveller [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] mixes the events of Harun's 782 campaign, when the Arab army had reached the [[Bosporus]], with those of 806, as well as introducing clearly fictional elements such as the manner of Nikephoros' death. According to Evliya, Harun besieged Constantinople twice. The first time the Caliph withdrew, after securing as much land as an oxhide could cover and building a fortress there, in an imitation of the ancient tale of [[Dido|Queen Dido]]. The second time, Harun marched on Constantinople to avenge the massacre of Muslims living there, and ordered Nikephoros executed by hanging at the [[Hagia Sophia]].{{sfn|Canard|1926|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nTo commemorate his successful campaign, Harun built a victory monument about {{convert|8|km|mi|sigfig=1}} west of Raqqa, his principal residence. Known as ''{{ill|Hiraqla|de|Heraqla}}'' in local tradition, apparently after Herakleia, it comprises a square structure with sides {{convert|100|m|ft}} long, surrounded by a circular wall about {{convert|500|m|ft}} in diameter, pierced by four gates in the cardinal directions. The main structure, built from stone taken from churches demolished on Harun's orders in 806\u2013807, has four vaulted halls on the ground floor, and ramps leading to an upper storey, which was left incomplete on Harun's departure for Khurasan and subsequent death.{{sfn|Meinecke|1995|p=412}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{The History of al-Tabari | volume = 30 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqf1gwM9O58C}}\n* {{cite book | last = Bonner | first = Michael | title = Aristocratic Violence and Holy War: Studies in the Jihad and the Arab\u2013Byzantine Frontier | year = 1996 | publisher = American Oriental Society | location = New Haven, Connecticut | isbn = 0-940490-11-0  | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book | last=Brooks | first=E.

The expedition took place in southeastern and central [[Asia Minor]], where the Abbasid and Byzantine empires shared a long land border.\n\nUpon coming to the throne, the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Nikephoros I]] ({{reign|802|811}}) ceased paying the [[tribute]] agreed to by his predecessors with the Caliphate, and launched attacks on the Abbasid [[al-Awasim|frontier regions]]. The [[Abbasid caliph]], [[Harun al-Rashid]] ({{reign|786|809}}), who sought to promote himself as a champion of ''[[jihad]]'', decided to lead in person a retaliatory attack with the objective of punishing the Byzantines and impressing Abassid might upon their emperor.\n\nHarun assembled his army at [[Raqqa]] in northern Syria. Medieval historians record numbers to be as high as 135,000 or even 300,000 men. While these are clearly exaggerated, it is clear that the Abbasid force assembled for the invasion was far larger than anything seen before. The Abbasid army set out from Raqqa on 11 June 806, crossed the coastal region of [[Cilicia]] and the [[Taurus Mountains]], and invaded the Byzantine province of [[Cappadocia]]. The Abbasids met no opposition and raided at will, capturing several towns and fortresses. Celebrated in Arab histories was the siege, fall, and sack of the city of [[Heraclea Cybistra|Herakleia]]; its name was later given to a victory monument erected by the Caliph near Raqqa. The Byzantine losses forced Nikephoros to seek peace terms in which he offered a resumption of tribute payments in exchange for the Abbasids' withdrawal. However, this time Harun exacted an additional [[jizya|personal tax]] levied on the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], as a token of their submission to the Caliph.\n\nAlmost immediately following Harun's departure, Nikephoros violated the peace terms by refortifying the sacked frontier forts and stopping tribute payments. However, Harun's preoccupation with a rebellion in [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], and his death three years later, prevented a reprisal on a similar scale to 806. Smaller-scale raids continued on both sides, but the [[Fourth Fitna|Abbasid civil war]], which began after 809, and the Byzantine preoccupation with the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] contributed to a cessation of large-scale [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars|Arab\u2013Byzantine conflict]] for the next two decades.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]] of Byzantine empress [[Irene of Athens]] in October 802 and the accession of [[Nikephoros I]] in her place marked the start of a more violent phase in the long history of the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]]. Following a series of destructive annual raids into Byzantine [[Asia Minor]] by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], Empress Irene apparently secured a truce with Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 798 in exchange for the annual payment of [[tribute]], repeating the terms agreed for a three-year truce after Harun's [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (782)|first large-scale campaign]] into Asia Minor in 782.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=113}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 1. Historical background}} Nikephoros, on the other hand, was more warlike\u2014a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] source records that when he learned of Nikephoros's accession, a [[Elpidius (rebel)|Byzantine renegade]] warned the Abbasid governor of [[Upper Mesopotamia]] to \"throw away his [[silk]] and put on his armour\". In addition, the new emperor was determined to refill the treasury by, among other measures, ceasing the tribute.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=127, 130}}\n\n[[File:Solidus-Nicephorus I and Staraucius-sb1604.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Obverse and reverse of a medieval gold coin, showing the busts of a bearded crowned man and of a younger crowned man|Gold ''[[solidus (coin)|nomisma]]'' of Emperor [[Nikephoros I]] (left) and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]] (right)]]\nIn retaliation for the cessation of tribute and the violation of the peace agreement concluded with Irene, Harun launched a raid under his son [[Al-Qasim ibn Harun al-Rashid|al-Qasim]] in spring 803.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=238\u2013239}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=131}} Nikephoros could not respond to this, as he faced a large-scale revolt of the Byzantine army of Asia Minor under its commander-in-chief, [[Bardanes Tourkos]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=131\u2013133}} After disposing of Bardanes, Nikephoros assembled his army and marched out to meet a second, larger invasion under the Caliph in person. After Harun raided the frontier region, the two armies faced one another for two months in central Asia Minor, but it did not come to a battle: Nikephoros and Harun exchanged letters,{{efn|[[Al-Tabari]] and other Muslim sources record the texts, supposedly of Nikephoros' letter demanding the return of the tribute paid until then, and Harun's brief reply to Nikephoros, calling him \"the dog of the Byzantines\" (''kalb [[R\u00fbm|al-Rum]]''): \"O son of an infidel woman, I have read your letter, and the reply is what you will see, without you having to hear it.

Nikephoros set out to confront the Arabs, but was surprised and heavily defeated at the [[Battle of Krasos]], where he barely escaped with his life.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 1.

In the summer of the same year, he launched the first Byzantine raid in two decades against the Arab frontier districts (''[[thughur]]'') in Cilicia. The Byzantine army raided the territory surrounding the fortresses of [[Mopsuestia]] and [[Anazarbus]] and took prisoners as it went. The garrison of Mopsuestia attacked the Byzantine force and recovered most of the prisoners and spoils, but the Byzantines marched on to [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], which had been refortified and repopulated on Harun's orders in 786 to strengthen the Muslim hold on Cilicia. The city fell and the entire garrison was taken captive.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=135, 138\u2013139}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=261\u2013262}} At the same time, another Byzantine force raided the Upper Mesopotamian ''thughur'' and unsuccessfully besieged the fortress of [[Melitene]], while a Byzantine-instigated rebellion against the local Arab garrison began in [[Cyprus]], which for over a century had been an Arab\u2013Byzantine [[condominium (international law)|condominium]].{{efn|In 688, Emperor [[Justinian II]] and the [[Umayyad]] caliph [[Abd al-Malik]] concluded an agreement whereby Cyprus became a neutral territory, its tax revenue shared between Byzantium and the Caliphate, and its ports open to both powers, including for military purposes against one another. Apart from a brief Byzantine reoccupation under [[Basil I the Macedonian]], this status lasted until 965, when the island was reincorporated into the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Cyprus\" (T. E. Gregory), pp. 567\u2013569}}}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=135, 138\u2013139}}\n\nThis sudden resumption of Byzantine offensive activity greatly alarmed Harun, especially as he received reports that Nikephoros was planning similar attacks for the next year, which this time would aim at the full reoccupation of these frontier territories. As the historian [[Warren Treadgold]] writes, if the Byzantines had been successful in this endeavour, \"garrisoning Tarsus and Melitene would have partly blocked the main Arab invasion routes across the Taurus into the Byzantine heartland, to the Byzantines' great benefit\". On the other hand, Nikephoros was certainly aware of the huge superiority of the Caliphate in men and resources, and it is more likely that he intended this campaign simply as a show of strength and a test of his enemy's resolve.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=139}}\n\n==Campaign==\nHaving settled matters in Khurasan by confirming Ibn Mahan in his governorship,{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=253\u2013254}} Harun returned to the west in November 805 and prepared a huge retaliatory expedition for 806, drawing men from [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Medieval Persia|Persia]], and [[Medieval Egypt|Egypt]]. According to [[al-Tabari]], his army numbered 135,000 regular troops and additional volunteers and [[Filibuster (military)|freebooters]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=99, 106}} These numbers are easily the largest ever recorded for the entire Abbasid era,{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=99, 106}} and about half as many as the estimated strength of the entire [[Byzantine army]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=144}} Although they\u2014and the even more fantastic claims of the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor]] of 300,000 men\u2014are certainly exaggerated, they are nevertheless indicative of the size of the Abbasid force.{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=99, 106}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|pp=661, 662 (note 5)}}  At the same time, a naval force under his admiral [[Humayd ibn Ma'yuf al-Hajuri]] was prepared to raid Cyprus.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=144}}\n\n[[File:Arab-Byzantine frontier zone.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Geophysical map of eastern Anatolia and northern Syria, showing the main fortresses during the Arab\u2013Byzantine frontier wars|Map of the Byzantine\u2013Arab frontier zone in southeastern [[Asia Minor]], where the Abbasid campaign of 806 took place]]\nThe huge invasion army departed Harun's residence of [[Raqqa]] in northern Syria on 11 June 806, with the Caliph at its head. Al-Tabari reports that Harun put on a cap with the inscription \"Warrior for the Faith and Pilgrim\" (in Arabic, \"''[[Ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]]'', ''[[hajj]]''\"). The Abbasids crossed Cilicia, where Harun ordered Tarsus to be rebuilt, and entered Byzantine [[Cappadocia]] through the [[Cilician Gates]]. Harun marched to [[Tyana]], which at the time seems to have been abandoned. There, he began to establish his base of operations, ordering [[Uqbah ibn Ja'far al-Khuza'i]] to refortify the town and erect a [[mosque]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144\u2013145}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=262\u2013263}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

The city was plundered and razed, and its inhabitants enslaved and deported to the Caliphate.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=661}} The fall of Herakleia was considered by the Arab chroniclers the most significant achievement of Harun's expeditions against the Byzantines,{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=356}} and is the central event in the narratives of Harun's retaliatory campaign against Nikephoros. As the historian [[Marius Canard]] remarks, \"for the Arabs the capture of Herakleia had an impact as profound as the [[Sack of Amorium]] in 838\", which is completely at odds with the city's actual importance. Indeed, the Byzantine sources do not place any particular emphasis on the fall of Herakleia compared to the other fortresses captured during Harun's 806 campaign.{{efn|name=fn2|There is at least some indication in the Arab sources that a different course was suggested to the Caliph: Harun is said to have asked two leaders from the frontier region on whether he should attack Herakleia. The first replied that it was the strongest fortress, and that if it fell, no-one would be able to oppose them, but the second replied that the city would yield little booty, and that he should attack a more important city. However, during the course of the siege he is said to have changed his mind and encouraged Harun to persist with the siege, when the Caliph was thinking of abandoning it.{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=364}}}}{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=378}}\n\nAt the same time, on Cyprus, Humayd ravaged the island and took some 16,000 Cypriots, including the [[Archbishop of Cyprus|local archbishop]], captive to Syria, where they were sold as slaves.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=662}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=145}}\n\nNikephoros, outnumbered and threatened by the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] in his rear, could not resist the Abbasid onslaught. He campaigned himself at the head of his army and seemingly won a few minor engagements against isolated detachments, but stayed well clear of the main Abbasid forces. In the end, with the harrowing possibility of the Arabs wintering on Byzantine soil in Tyana, he sent three [[cleric]]s as ambassadors: [[Michael of Synnada|Michael]], the bishop of [[Synnada]], [[Peter of Goulaion|Peter]], the abbot of the [[monastery]] of Goulaion, and Gregory, the steward of the metropolis of [[Amastris (city)|Amastris]]. Harun agreed to peace in exchange for the payment of an annual tribute (30,000 [[gold]] ''[[solidus (coin)|nomismata]]'', according to Theophanes, 50,000 according to al-Tabari), but the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], were to pay a humiliating personal poll-tax (''[[jizya]]'') of three gold coins each to the Caliph (four and two respectively, in Tabari's version), thereby acknowledging themselves as the Caliph's subjects. In addition, Nikephoros promised not to rebuild the dismantled forts. Harun then recalled his forces from their various sieges and evacuated Byzantine territory.{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

According to Tabari, Harun\n\n<blockquote>\"ordered the slave girl to be sought out; she was brought back, adorned with finery and installed on a seat in the tent in which he himself was lodging. The slave girl and the tent, together with its contents, vessels and fittings, were handed over to Nikephoros's envoy. He also sent to Nikephoros the perfume which he had requested, and he further sent to him dates, dishes of jellied sweets, raisins and healing drugs.\"{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=264}}</blockquote>\n\nNikephoros returned the favour by dispatching a horse laden with 50,000 silver coins, 100 [[satin]] garments, 200 garments of fine [[brocade]], 12 [[falcon]]s, four hunting dogs, and three more horses.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=264}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=146}} But as soon as the Arabs had withdrawn, the Emperor again restored the frontier forts and thereafter ceased the payment of tribute.

The larger summer raid under [[Harthama ibn A'yan]] was met by Nikephoros in person, and after an indecisive battle both sides retreated. The Byzantines raided the region of [[Marash]] in return, while in late summer Humayd launched a major naval raid, which pillaged [[Rhodes]] and reached as far as the [[Peloponnese]], where it may have fomented a [[Siege of Patras (805 or 807)|rebellion]] among the local [[Slavs]]. On his return, however, Humayd lost several ships to a storm, and on the Peloponnese, the Slavic revolt was put down after failing to capture the city of [[Patras]] during the siege of 805.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=147\u2013148}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=267\u2013268}} The failure of the year's Abbasid efforts were compounded by the outbreak of [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]]'s rebellion in Khurasan, which forced Harun to depart again for the East. The Caliph concluded a new truce, and another prisoner exchange was held at the Lamos in 808. Nikephoros was thus left with his gains, both the restored frontier fortifications and the cessation of tribute, intact.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=155}}\n\n==Impact==\n[[File:Arabische Eroberung 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Multi-color map of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, showing the phases of Muslim expansion to the 10th century|Map of the [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]] during the 7th and 8th centuries and of the Muslim world under the [[Umayyad]] and early [[Abbasid]] caliphates, from the {{Interlanguage link|Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas|de|lt=''Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas''}} of [[Gustav Droysen]] (1886)]]\n\nHarun's massive expedition achieved remarkably little in material terms. Despite the sack of Herakleia, and its prominent treatment in Arab sources, no permanent result was achieved, as Nikephoros was quick to violate the terms of the truce.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=146}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 3. Consequences}} According to the historian Warren Treadgold, if Harun had taken the advice offered by one of his lieutenants to proceed further west and sack a major city, he might have inflicted more long-lasting damage on Byzantium,{{efn|name=fn2}} but the Caliph's objectives were more limited: Harun was content with a show of force that would intimidate Nikephoros and prevent him from repeating the offensive of 805, and which bolstered his credentials as a champion of Islam.{{efn|name=fn1|In contrast with their [[Umayyad]] predecessors, the Abbasid caliphs pursued a conservative foreign policy. In general terms, they were content with the territorial limits achieved, and whatever external campaigns they waged were retaliatory or pre-emptive, meant to preserve their frontier and impress Abbasid might upon their neighbours.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|p=302}} At the same time, the campaigns against Byzantium in particular were important for domestic consumption. The annual raids were a symbol of the continuing ''[[jihad]]'' of the early Muslim state and were the only external expeditions where the Caliph or his sons participated in person. They were closely paralleled in official [[propaganda]] by the leadership by Abbasid family members of the annual pilgrimage (''[[hajj]]'') to [[Mecca]], highlighting the dynasty's leading role in the religious life of the Muslim community.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|pp=278\u2013279}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=105\u2013106}} Harun al-Rashid in particular actively strove to embody this duty: he was said to have alternated between leading the ''hajj'' one year and attacking Byzantium the next.{{sfn|El-Cheikh|2004|pp=89\u201390}} The hitherto unseen extent of his personal involvement in the ''jihad'' converted it into a central tenet of his conception of the caliphate, leading modern historians to consider Harun as the creator of a new type of model ruler, the \"''ghazi''-caliph\".{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=xvii}}{{sfn|Bonner|1996|pp=99\u2013106}}{{sfn|Haug|2011|pp=637\u2013638}}}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144, 146}} In that regard, the Abbasid campaign was certainly a success: after 806, the Byzantine ruler abandoned whatever expansionist plans he may have had for the eastern border and focused his energy on his fiscal reforms, the recovery of the [[Balkans]], and his wars there against the Bulgars, which would end with his death in the disastrous [[Battle of Pliska]] in 811.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=168\u2013174}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=146, 157\u2013174}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 3. Consequences}}\n\nOn the other hand, the historian [[M. A. Shaban]] considers the campaign a \"limited success\" at best, and criticizes Harun's \"single-minded\" attention to the Byzantines as a \"totally misguided effort\". According to Shaban, not only did the Byzantines have no real ability (or intention) to seriously threaten the Caliphate, but Harun's recruitment drive led to the influx of eastern soldiers from Khurasan, which antagonized the traditional Syrian\u2013Iraqi military elites and created rifts that contributed to the [[Fourth Fitna|Abbasid civil war]] that broke out after Harun's death.{{sfn|Shaban|1976|pp=32, 38\u201339}} This conflict, between Harun's sons [[al-Amin]] ({{reign|809|813}}) and [[al-Ma'mun]] ({{reign|813|833}}), meant that the Abbasid Caliphate was not able to exploit the Byzantine reversals in the Balkans. Indeed, the 806 campaign and the ineffectual raids of 807 mark the last major, centrally organized, Abbasid expeditions against Byzantium for over twenty years.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=157}} Isolated raids and counter-raids continued at land as well as at sea, and, independently of the Abbasids, local Muslim leaders [[Emirate of Crete|conquered]] [[Crete]] and launched the [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|conquest]] of [[Sicily]] in the 820s.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=127\u2013128}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=183, 219\u2013220, 248\u2013257}} Nevertheless, large-scale operations over the land border in eastern Asia Minor between the two empires resumed only after the accession of Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] ({{reign|829|842}}), whose confrontations with the caliphs al-Ma'mun and [[al-Mu'tasim]] ({{reign|833|842}}) culminated in the great invasions by al-Ma'mun in 830\u2013833, and the Sack of Amorium by al-Mu'tasim in 838.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=128\u2013131}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=272\u2013275, 278\u2013281, 292\u2013305}}\n\n[[File:Heraqla,SE.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Photo of a mound of ruins in a barren field|View of the remnants of ''Hiraqla'', a victory monument erected by Harun after the campaign of 806]]\nThe longest-lasting impact of Harun's campaign is found in literature. Among the Arabs, several legends or anecdotes, related by sources such as [[al-Masudi]] and the ''[[Kitab al-Aghani]]'', were associated with it, emphasizing the city's strong fortifications, describing a single combat between a Byzantine and an Arab champion which was decided when the Arab captured the Byzantine by using a [[lasso]], or the terror inspired among the defenders by the Abbasid army's use of large catapults throwing [[Greek fire]]-like substances.{{sfn|Canard|1962|pp=363\u2013372}} The [[Ottoman Turks]] also placed great importance on Harun's battles with the Byzantines. The account of the 17th-century Ottoman traveller [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] mixes the events of Harun's 782 campaign, when the Arab army had reached the [[Bosporus]], with those of 806, as well as introducing clearly fictional elements such as the manner of Nikephoros' death. According to Evliya, Harun besieged Constantinople twice. The first time the Caliph withdrew, after securing as much land as an oxhide could cover and building a fortress there, in an imitation of the ancient tale of [[Dido|Queen Dido]]. The second time, Harun marched on Constantinople to avenge the massacre of Muslims living there, and ordered Nikephoros executed by hanging at the [[Hagia Sophia]].{{sfn|Canard|1926|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nTo commemorate his successful campaign, Harun built a victory monument about {{convert|8|km|mi|sigfig=1}} west of Raqqa, his principal residence. Known as ''{{ill|Hiraqla|de|Heraqla}}'' in local tradition, apparently after Herakleia, it comprises a square structure with sides {{convert|100|m|ft}} long, surrounded by a circular wall about {{convert|500|m|ft}} in diameter, pierced by four gates in the cardinal directions. The main structure, built from stone taken from churches demolished on Harun's orders in 806\u2013807, has four vaulted halls on the ground floor, and ramps leading to an upper storey, which was left incomplete on Harun's departure for Khurasan and subsequent death.{{sfn|Meinecke|1995|p=412}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{The History of al-Tabari | volume = 30 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqf1gwM9O58C}}\n* {{cite book | last = Bonner | first = Michael | title = Aristocratic Violence and Holy War: Studies in the Jihad and the Arab\u2013Byzantine Frontier | year = 1996 | publisher = American Oriental Society | location = New Haven, Connecticut | isbn = 0-940490-11-0  | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book | last=Brooks | first=E.

It was initially called Flagstaff because of the flagstaff raised on nearby [[Mount Victoria, Auckland|Mount Victoria (Takarunga)]].

[[William Hobson]], then the Governor of New Zealand, considered the sandspit-protected area a better choice for a naval installation than the shallower [[Tamaki, New Zealand|Tamaki]] waters on the southern side of the harbour.<ref name=\"TRAVEL\"/> While some facilities have expanded and shifted in location over time, the area is still the primary base for the [[Royal New Zealand Navy]].

In 1860 the first [[paddlesteamer]] ferries began operation.<ref name=\"devonporttours1\" /><ref name=\"fullers\" />\n\nThese were in turn replaced by double-ended, screw-driven ferries in 1904.<ref name=\"fullers\" /> Both passenger and vehicle ferries operated on the Devonport run until the opening of the [[Auckland Harbour Bridge]] in 1959. Immediately after the opening of the bridge, passenger ferry services to other North Shore destinations (such as [[Northcote, New Zealand|Northcote]] and [[Birkenhead, New Zealand|Birkenhead]]) were cancelled, as were all vehicular ferries.

It was initially called Flagstaff because of the flagstaff raised on nearby [[Mount Victoria, Auckland|Mount Victoria (Takarunga)]].

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a population of 152,374, up from 124,966 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. The cities of [[Norco, California|Norco]] and [[Riverside, California|Riverside]] lie to the north and northeast, [[Chino Hills, California|Chino Hills]] and [[Yorba Linda, California|Yorba Linda]] to the northwest, and the [[Cleveland National Forest]] and the [[Santa Ana Mountains]] to the southwest, and unincorporated Riverside County along the rest of the border, respectively. Corona is approximately {{convert|48|mi|km|}} southeast of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and {{convert|95|mi|km|}} north-northwest of [[San Diego, California|San Diego]].\n\nCorona, located along the western edge of Southern California's [[Inland Empire]] region, is known as the \"Circle City\" due to Grand Boulevard's 3-mile (5 km) circular layout. It is one of the most residential cities in the Inland Empire, but also has a large industrial portion on the northern half. It is the headquarters of companies such as [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation]], [[Monster Beverage Corporation]], and [[supercar]] manufacturer [[Saleen]].\n\n[[File:ButterfieldstagestationCorona1860.jpg|thumb|right| [[Temescal Butterfield stage station]] Corona in 1860]]\n\n==History==\nCorona, originally named '''South Riverside''', was founded at the height of the Southern California [[citrus]] boom in 1886, and is situated at the upper end of the [[Santa Ana River]] Canyon, a significant pass through the [[Santa Ana Mountains]]. The town of Corona was once the \"Lemon Capital of the World\". A museum there presents the lemon's former role in the local economy. The city derived its name (and its nickname, \"The Circle City\") from the unique layout of its streets, with a standard grid enclosed by the circular Grand Boulevard, {{convert|2.75|mi|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} in circumference.<ref>{{cite news|title=Corona: 'Circle City' to mark centennial of road races|url=http://www.pe.com/articles/corona-675538-race-city.html|newspaper=[[The Press-Enterprise]]|date=August 16, 2013|quote=...Grand Boulevard seems a quaint oddity. A perfect circle, with a circumference just over 2.75 miles, it's the rationale for Corona's tagline as the 'Circle City'.}}</ref> The street layout was designed by Hiram Clay Kellogg, a civil engineer from [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]] who was an influential figure in the early development of Orange County.\n\nCorona was established as a town by the [[South Riverside Land and Water Company]]. The company was incorporated in 1886; founding members included ex-Governor of Iowa [[Samuel Merrill (Iowa)|Samuel Merrill]], R.B. Taylor, George L. Joy, A.S. Garretson, and Adolph Rimpau.<ref>[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8z3208k/ Finding aid of South Riverside Land and Water Company records, Online Archive of California] from oac.cdlib.org accessed April 26, 2015.</ref> Originally a citrus growers' organization, it purchased the lands of [[Rancho La Sierra (Yorba)|Rancho La Sierra]] of Bernardo Yorba, and the [[Rancho Temescal (Serrano)|Rancho Temescal]] grant and the colony of South Riverside was laid out. They also secured the water rights to [[Temescal Creek (Riverside County)|Temescal Creek]], its tributaries and Lee Lake. Dams and pipelines were built to carry the water to the colony. In 1889, the Temescal Water Company was incorporated, to supply water for the new colony. This company purchased all the water-bearing lands in the Temescal valley and began drilling artesian wells.<ref>Ellerbe, ''History of Temescal Valley'', pp. 18\u201319</ref>\n\nOriginally located in [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]], the city was named \"South Riverside\" and received its post office in that name on August 11, 1887.<ref>Frickstad, Walter N., ''A Century of California Post Offices 1848-1954'', Philatelic Research Society, Oakland, CA. 1955, pp.135-147</ref> In 1893, South Riverside became part of the new Riverside County. In 1896, the city was renamed \"Corona\" for its circular Grand Boulevard, where three international automobile races were held in 1913, 1914 and 1916.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hoover |first=Mildred B. |authorlink= |author2=Hero Rensch |author3=Ethel Rensch |author4=William N.

[[Lucille Ball]] and [[Desi Arnaz]] spent time at their ranch, located in north Corona, and played golf often at the Cresta Verde Golf Course in the northeastern section of the city.<ref>http://www.crestaverde.com</ref> After their divorce, Mr. Arnaz continued to live in Corona.\n\nIn recent years Corona has been known as the \"Gateway to the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]]\". Prior to the 1980s, the city was largely an agricultural community, dominated by citrus orchards, ranches, and [[dairy]] farms. High real estate prices in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]] and [[Orange County, California|Orange]] counties made the area's land desirable to developers and industrialists, and by the late 1990s Corona was considered a major [[suburb]] of [[Los Angeles]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nHousing development in the city has been accelerated by access to the area via the [[California State Route 91|SR 91]], with many families leaving Orange County to larger, more affordable housing available in the city. The construction of the nearby [[California State Route 71|SR 71]] has linked Corona to the [[Pomona Valley|Pomona]] and [[San Gabriel Valley|San Gabriel]] valleys. Due to traffic caused by Corona's considerable growth, [[91 Express Lanes|toll lanes]] have been built along the 91 freeway, with future toll lane expansions under construction and in the planning stages along [[Interstate 15]]. While there were talks to construct a proposed {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on|0}} automobile and rail tunnel under Santiago Peak to connect Interstate 15 in Corona with [[Interstate 5]] and [[California State Route 55|SR 55]] in Orange County to reduce commuter traffic on the crowded 91 freeway, this concept has been shelved indefinitely.\n\nIn 2002, the city government considered an initiative to secede from Riverside County and form an autonomous Corona County because the city government and some residents were dissatisfied with how services were handled in nearby areas. The effort was also considered by areas in other cities in the western part of the county as far south as [[Murrieta, California|Murrieta]]. Whether nearby cities such as [[Norco, California|Norco]] would have been included in the new county are unknown. The proposed county would have been bordered by [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]] to the northwest, and by [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] to the west, but it never came to fruition.<ref>[http://www.newspress.com/northsouth/greatdivide.html Santa Barbara News Press article on the county split proposal, with a brief mention of the proposed Corona County.]</ref>\n\n===Historical markers===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Roadside Historical Markers in Corona<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Marael |title=Why Stop?

Most of the rainfall (as in all of Southern California) occurs during winter and early spring. Frost is not uncommon and happens mostly in December and January. Snowfall within city limits is rare, however the nearby Santa Ana Mountains receive a dusting of snow a few times each winter. Winter days are pleasant, with the average high staying around 65 and the average low around 40, occasionally dropping down to freezing. The spring brings pleasant weather, with little rain.  Summertime is hot, with highs averaging in the low to mid 90s. During the hottest months, daytime temperatures in Corona can exceed 100 degrees.<ref>[http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/vacationplanner/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USCA0252?from=36hr_bottomnav_vacation www.weather.com]</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/usa/corona/historic | title=Past Weather in Corona, California, USA \u2014 Yesterday or Further Back}}</ref> In early summer, Corona receives common overcast weather known as \"May Gray\" and \"[[June Gloom]]\".

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a population of 152,374, up from 124,966 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. The cities of [[Norco, California|Norco]] and [[Riverside, California|Riverside]] lie to the north and northeast, [[Chino Hills, California|Chino Hills]] and [[Yorba Linda, California|Yorba Linda]] to the northwest, and the [[Cleveland National Forest]] and the [[Santa Ana Mountains]] to the southwest, and unincorporated Riverside County along the rest of the border, respectively. Corona is approximately {{convert|48|mi|km|}} southeast of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and {{convert|95|mi|km|}} north-northwest of [[San Diego, California|San Diego]].\n\nCorona, located along the western edge of Southern California's [[Inland Empire]] region, is known as the \"Circle City\" due to Grand Boulevard's 3-mile (5 km) circular layout. It is one of the most residential cities in the Inland Empire, but also has a large industrial portion on the northern half. It is the headquarters of companies such as [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation]], [[Monster Beverage Corporation]], and [[supercar]] manufacturer [[Saleen]].\n\n[[File:ButterfieldstagestationCorona1860.jpg|thumb|right| [[Temescal Butterfield stage station]] Corona in 1860]]\n\n==History==\nCorona, originally named '''South Riverside''', was founded at the height of the Southern California [[citrus]] boom in 1886, and is situated at the upper end of the [[Santa Ana River]] Canyon, a significant pass through the [[Santa Ana Mountains]]. The town of Corona was once the \"Lemon Capital of the World\". A museum there presents the lemon's former role in the local economy. The city derived its name (and its nickname, \"The Circle City\") from the unique layout of its streets, with a standard grid enclosed by the circular Grand Boulevard, {{convert|2.75|mi|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} in circumference.<ref>{{cite news|title=Corona: 'Circle City' to mark centennial of road races|url=http://www.pe.com/articles/corona-675538-race-city.html|newspaper=[[The Press-Enterprise]]|date=August 16, 2013|quote=...Grand Boulevard seems a quaint oddity. A perfect circle, with a circumference just over 2.75 miles, it's the rationale for Corona's tagline as the 'Circle City'.}}</ref> The street layout was designed by Hiram Clay Kellogg, a civil engineer from [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]] who was an influential figure in the early development of Orange County.\n\nCorona was established as a town by the [[South Riverside Land and Water Company]]. The company was incorporated in 1886; founding members included ex-Governor of Iowa [[Samuel Merrill (Iowa)|Samuel Merrill]], R.B. Taylor, George L. Joy, A.S. Garretson, and Adolph Rimpau.<ref>[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8z3208k/ Finding aid of South Riverside Land and Water Company records, Online Archive of California] from oac.cdlib.org accessed April 26, 2015.</ref> Originally a citrus growers' organization, it purchased the lands of [[Rancho La Sierra (Yorba)|Rancho La Sierra]] of Bernardo Yorba, and the [[Rancho Temescal (Serrano)|Rancho Temescal]] grant and the colony of South Riverside was laid out. They also secured the water rights to [[Temescal Creek (Riverside County)|Temescal Creek]], its tributaries and Lee Lake. Dams and pipelines were built to carry the water to the colony. In 1889, the Temescal Water Company was incorporated, to supply water for the new colony. This company purchased all the water-bearing lands in the Temescal valley and began drilling artesian wells.<ref>Ellerbe, ''History of Temescal Valley'', pp. 18\u201319</ref>\n\nOriginally located in [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]], the city was named \"South Riverside\" and received its post office in that name on August 11, 1887.<ref>Frickstad, Walter N., ''A Century of California Post Offices 1848-1954'', Philatelic Research Society, Oakland, CA. 1955, pp.135-147</ref> In 1893, South Riverside became part of the new Riverside County. In 1896, the city was renamed \"Corona\" for its circular Grand Boulevard, where three international automobile races were held in 1913, 1914 and 1916.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hoover |first=Mildred B. |authorlink= |author2=Hero Rensch |author3=Ethel Rensch |author4=William N.

[[Lucille Ball]] and [[Desi Arnaz]] spent time at their ranch, located in north Corona, and played golf often at the Cresta Verde Golf Course in the northeastern section of the city.<ref>http://www.crestaverde.com</ref> After their divorce, Mr. Arnaz continued to live in Corona.\n\nIn recent years Corona has been known as the \"Gateway to the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]]\". Prior to the 1980s, the city was largely an agricultural community, dominated by citrus orchards, ranches, and [[dairy]] farms. High real estate prices in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]] and [[Orange County, California|Orange]] counties made the area's land desirable to developers and industrialists, and by the late 1990s Corona was considered a major [[suburb]] of [[Los Angeles]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nHousing development in the city has been accelerated by access to the area via the [[California State Route 91|SR 91]], with many families leaving Orange County to larger, more affordable housing available in the city. The construction of the nearby [[California State Route 71|SR 71]] has linked Corona to the [[Pomona Valley|Pomona]] and [[San Gabriel Valley|San Gabriel]] valleys. Due to traffic caused by Corona's considerable growth, [[91 Express Lanes|toll lanes]] have been built along the 91 freeway, with future toll lane expansions under construction and in the planning stages along [[Interstate 15]]. While there were talks to construct a proposed {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on|0}} automobile and rail tunnel under Santiago Peak to connect Interstate 15 in Corona with [[Interstate 5]] and [[California State Route 55|SR 55]] in Orange County to reduce commuter traffic on the crowded 91 freeway, this concept has been shelved indefinitely.\n\nIn 2002, the city government considered an initiative to secede from Riverside County and form an autonomous Corona County because the city government and some residents were dissatisfied with how services were handled in nearby areas. The effort was also considered by areas in other cities in the western part of the county as far south as [[Murrieta, California|Murrieta]]. Whether nearby cities such as [[Norco, California|Norco]] would have been included in the new county are unknown. The proposed county would have been bordered by [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]] to the northwest, and by [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] to the west, but it never came to fruition.<ref>[http://www.newspress.com/northsouth/greatdivide.html Santa Barbara News Press article on the county split proposal, with a brief mention of the proposed Corona County.]</ref>\n\n===Historical markers===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Roadside Historical Markers in Corona<ref>{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Marael |title=Why Stop?

Most of the rainfall (as in all of Southern California) occurs during winter and early spring. Frost is not uncommon and happens mostly in December and January. Snowfall within city limits is rare, however the nearby Santa Ana Mountains receive a dusting of snow a few times each winter. Winter days are pleasant, with the average high staying around 65 and the average low around 40, occasionally dropping down to freezing. The spring brings pleasant weather, with little rain.  Summertime is hot, with highs averaging in the low to mid 90s.

The deviation is the centre two tracks, with the [[Wairarapa Line]]'s Ngauranga station in the background, alongside [[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]].]]\nThe double track [[Tawa Flat deviation]] opened to goods trains on 22 July 1935 and to passenger trains on 19 June 1937, bypassing the original single track WMR line between Wellington and [[Tawa, New Zealand|Tawa]]. With a pair of tunnels under the Wellington hills, the deviation alleviated issues with more and heavier freight traffic on the steep and twisting original route where long sections at 1 in 60 gradient required banker engines. The Wellington to Johnsonville section of the original line was retained as the [[Johnsonville Line]] and the Johnsonville to Tawa section closed.\n\nThe sections from Plimmerton to South Junction, north of Pukerua Bay and Muri, and North Junction to Paekakariki were duplicated in 1940. From 24 July 1940 electrification at 1500 V DC of the southern section of the NIMT from Wellington to Paekakariki was completed.  The [[Tawa Flat deviation]] has a long tunnel (Tawa No 2)  not suitable for steam operation because of excessive smoke (although steam trains were temporarily operated in the new deviation from 1935). A Centralised Train Control (CTC) system was installed in 1940, so that new signal boxes were not required and five stations between Tawa and Pukerua Bay no longer had to be continually staffed for Tablet operation; see [[Kapiti Line#Duplication|Kapiti Line]]. Electrification eliminated the need to relieve the steep (1 in 57) gradients from Plimmerton to the Pukerua Bay summit by a deviation to the east and allowed more frequent suburban passenger trains (and allowed suburban electric multiple units to run on this section from September 1949).\n[[File:Electric Locomotives Near Paekakariki.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EW class locomotive|EW]]1805 hauling [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] 4611 near Paekakariki on the electrified Wellington section.

Duplication from Tawa to Porirua opened on 15 December 1957, from Porirua to Paremata on 7 November 1960, and Paremata to Plimmerton on 16 October 1961. The section between [[Porirua]] and [[Plimmerton]] was straightened in conjunction with the duplication by reclaiming land along the eastern shore of Porirua Harbour.\n\nBetween 1964 and 1966 a deviation away from the centre of Palmerston North via the [[Milson deviation]] on the edge of the city.\n\nIn 1967 the floors of the tunnels on the WMR section between Paekakariki and Pukerua Bay were lowered to enable the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|DA class]] locomotives to travel all the way to Wellington.\n\nBetween 1973 and 1981 the major [[Mangaweka deviation]] in the central section between [[Mangaweka]] and Utiku was built, with three viaducts, all over 70m tall, crossing the Rangitikei and Kawhatau rivers.\n\nThe central section from Te Rapa near Hamilton to Palmerston North was electrified at 25 kV AC between 1984 and 1988 as part of the [[Think Big]] government energy programme. Some tunnels were opened out or bypassed by deviations while in others clearances were increased, and curves eased. The section between [[Ohakune]] and Horopito was realigned with three viaducts replaced to handle higher loads and speeds. The most notable bridge replaced was the curved metal viaduct at Hapuawhenua by a modern concrete structure, though the original has been restored as a tourist attraction.\n\nIn 2009\u201310, the 1.5&nbsp;km section of line between Wellington Junction and Distant Junction was rebuilt from double track to triple track, to ease peak-time congestion.\n\nIn February 2011 duplication between Paekakariki and Waikanae was completed as part of the upgrade and expansion of the Wellington suburban network; see [[Kapiti Line]] for more information.\n\nIn 2012\u201313 four bridges near Rangiriri between Auckland and Hamilton were replaced. The bridges were all over 100 years old with steel spans and timber piers, and were replaced by modern low-maintenance concrete ballast deck bridges.

Wellington's urban network is electrified at ([[1500 V DC railway electrification|1500 V DC]]); as formerly used in other sections of the New Zealand  network. In Wellington the operating voltage has been increased to 1700 V DC since the full introduction of the [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|Matangi EMU]], to increase the power available.  \n \nElectrification of the NIMT was mooted by electrical engineer [[Evan Parry]] in the first volume of the ''New Zealand Journal of Science and Technology'' in November 1918. In light of a national coal shortage following [[World War I]], Parry argued that the network was under great strain due to ever-increasing volumes of freight, and the use of steam traction was partly to blame. Parry also noted that there was great potential for cheap hydro-electricity generation in the central North Island to power electrification.\n\nThe first part of the NIMT to be electrified was the [[Wellington]]\u2013[[Paekakariki railway station|Paekakariki]] section via the [[Tawa Flat deviation]] that was completed on 24 July 1940. This was largely to prevent smoke nuisance in the 4.3&nbsp;km No. 2 tunnel, and to provide for banking on the Paekakariki to Pukerua Bay section. Electric traction in this section is now used only by [[Transdev Wellington]] for Metlink suburban passenger services on the [[Kapiti Line]], and was extended to [[Paraparaumu railway station|Paraparaumu]] on 7 May 1983 and [[Waikanae railway station|Waikanae]] on 20 February 2011. Funded by the [[Greater Wellington Regional Council]], the extension to Waikanae coincided with the delivery of new [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|FP class Matangi]] [[electric multiple unit]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|title=KiwiRail \u2013 Wellington Projects|date=22 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722185555/http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|archivedate=22 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Second World War railway services suffered due to skill and coal shortages. Skilled staff sought employment opportunities elsewhere in the economy. From 1948 to 1951 the General Manager of the Railways Department, Francis William Aickin, advocated electrification of the entire line, despite protests from his engineering staff. Aickin had previously been Staff Superintendent and Chief Legal Advisor to the Department, and considered using diesel locomotives for trains on the NIMT to be too expensive. He turned his attention to electrification, mainly because he saw that it could relieve the coal situation and prevent high expenditure on imported fuels.\n\nHe commissioned a study into electrification, which concluded that a low-frequency AC system could be cheaper than 1500 V DC, the system in use in Wellington. Aickin sent a technical mission of four senior officers overseas in March 1949 and travelled overseas himself to negotiate a tentative contract with a British construction company. The Chief Mechanical Engineer and Chief Accountant specified and costed the system and Aickin was able to complete a substantial report justifying the NIMT electrification and submit it to the Government.\n\nOfficers from [[New Zealand Treasury]] and the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Ministry of Works]] and two experts from [[Sweden]] (Thelander and Edenius) commented on the proposal and in December 1950 the Government granted approval in principle and agreed to appoint Thelander as a consultant. However, Aickin fell out with the then National Government and retired as General Manager in July 1951. With the change in regime, the electrification proposal disappeared.\n\nA key assumption of Aickin's report was that traffic on the NIMT would grow by 50% from 1948 to 1961. Since a diesel-electric locomotive was in fact a travelling power station, the savings through electrification compared to diesel could be regarded as the difference between the cost of buying bulk electrical energy generated substantially from New Zealand resources and the cost of generating electricity in a small plant using imported diesel fuel.\n\nHowever, the Royal Commission on Railways created following Aickin's tenure rejected the report's findings. Aickin's successor, H.C. Lusty, revised the tentative contract with [[English Electric]] to specify [[NZR DF class (1954)|DF]] diesel-electric locomotives. They were later found to be unreliable, and only ten were supplied. 42 [[New Zealand DG and DH class locomotive|DG]] locomotives were supplied instead for secondary lines. For main lines including the NIMT, [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup> class]] diesel-electric locomotives were ordered from General Motors.\n\nThe {{convert|411|km|mi|abbr=on}} section between [[Palmerston North]] and [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] was electrified at 25 kV 50&nbsp;Hz [[alternating current|AC]], opened on 24 June 1988<ref name=\"nzro_winter_1988\">{{cite journal|journal=New Zealand Railway Observer|title=North Island Main Trunk Electrified|date=Autumn 1988|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|issn=0028-8624|volume=45| issue =  1|page=49|author=Tom McGavin}}</ref> as one of the [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]] [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government's]] \"[[Think Big]]\" energy development projects. An overall cost in excess of $100 million had been projected, with some 40% being for the locomotives, but the final cost was about $250 million. The economics of the project was greatly undermined by the fall of the price of oil in the 1980s and the deregulation of land transport, which removed the long-distance monopoly NZR held when the cost-benefit report was written.\n[[File:EF30163+Overlander NearWaiouru 22March2003 JChristianson.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF]]30163 hauling The [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] on the [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] section in 2003.]]\nThe electrification of the section, which had its genesis in a study group set up in June 1974 to report on measures to be taken to cope with increasing rail traffic volumes, received approval in 1980. This led to a technical study carried out with assistance from the Japanese [[Railway Technical Research Institute]]. The report stated that track capacity would be increased by electrification because such traction is faster and able to move more freight at once. The report stated, for example, that whereas a diesel locomotive could haul 720-tonne trains at {{convert|27|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} up the [[Raurimu Spiral]], an electric locomotive could haul 1100/1200-tonne trains at {{convert|45|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, cutting 3\u20135 hours off journey times. Less fuel would be needed and employing regenerative braking in electric locomotives lowers the fuel consumption further.\n\nElectrification's advantages were reflected in the economic evaluation in the report, which showed a rate of return of 18%. Sensitivity analysis showed that this high rate of return gave the project robustness against lower traffic volumes than expected (the return remained positive even if traffic fell), against significant increases in construction cost, and against lower than expected rises in the diesel fuel price.\n\nPart of the project included replacing the copper wire communications system with a new [[fiber optic|fibre optic]] communications cable (due to interference caused by AC power with the DC copper wire system) between Wellington and Auckland. In 1994 New Zealand Rail Limited sold the cable to [[Clear Communications]] for telephone traffic, leasing part of it back for signalling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canterbury.cyberplace.org.nz/community/CAFCA/cafca94/sept94.html|title=September 1994&nbsp;decisions|publisher=[[Campaign Against Foreign Control of Aotearoa]]}}</ref>\n\nProposals to [[Auckland railway electrification|electrify the Auckland suburban rail network]] dated back to the 1960s,{{sfn|Churchman & Hurst|2001|p=30}} they mainly coincided with proposals to electrify the NIMT in its entirety.

In 1932 the [[4-8-4]] [[NZR K class (1932)|K class]] was introduced, and later improved in 1939 with the [[NZR Ka class|K<sup>A</sup>]].\n\nThe introduction of the English Electric [[NZR DF class (1954)|D<sup>F</sup> class]] in 1954 began the end of the steam era, and in 1955 with the introduction of the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup>]] major withdrawals of steam locomotives began. 1972 saw the introduction of [[New Zealand DX class locomotive|D<sup>X</sup>]] locomotives and the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]] railcars: the latter remained in service between Auckland and Wellington until 1991.\n\nWith electrification and the introduction of the [[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF class]] electric locomotives in the late 1980s, the DX class was mainly reassigned to other areas of the network, including hauling coal on the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] in the [[South Island]]. Since then services between Te Rapa and Palmerston North have been worked mainly by the electrics, although some services are still diesel operated, such as those originating from or terminating on other lines, or originating from within the central section, like the paper pulp freight trains from Karioi.\n\nAs of May 2016, regular rolling stock on the NIMT include:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"background:#f9f9f9;\"\n!

The daily \"Express\" left earlier in the evening, followed by the \"Limited\", which had fewer stops for passengers.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1968 daytime trains were called the [[Scenic Daylight]]. In 1968, an [[NZR RM class|RM class]] [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88-seater]] [[railcar]] was refurbished and repainted in a distinctive blue scheme that led to it being nicknamed the Blue Streak. It initially operated an unsuccessful service between [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and Auckland in early 1968, and was transferred to the Auckland-Wellington run on 23 September 1968.\n[[File:Tolldc4093.jpg|thumb|A [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] hauls the now replaced [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] long-distance passenger train between Auckland and Wellington.]]\nIn 1971 [[New Zealand Railways Department|NZR]] introduced the [[Silver Star (NZR train)|Silver Star]], a luxury sleeper train. The service was not economically viable, and was withdrawn in 1979. Much more successful was the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]], a daytime [[railcar]] service, introduced in 1972 to replace the \"Blue Streak\". This service was withdrawn in 1991 and replaced by [[Overlander (train)|The Overlander]].\n\nIn conjunction with the introduction of the carriage train Overlander service, the Silver Fern railcars were redeployed to start new services between Tauranga and Auckland \u2013 [[Kaimai Express]], and Auckland and Rotorua \u2013 [[Geyserland Express]], in 1991. In 2000 a new commuter service called the [[Waikato Connection]] was introduced between Hamilton and Auckland and ran in conjunction with the services to Tauranga and Rotorua until all three services were cancelled in 2001.\n\nOn 25 July 2006 Toll announced that the Overlander would cease at the end of September 2006, but on 28 September 2006 the train's continuation on a limited timetable was announced.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10403445| title=Overlander to continue running| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=28 September 2006| accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> It ran daily during the summer months and thrice-weekly for the balance of the year.\n\nIn 2012 KiwiRail announced the Overlander would be replaced by the [[Northern Explorer]], with new [[New Zealand AK class carriage|AK class carriages]] to provide a premium tourist train on a quicker timetable with fewer stops. It commenced on Monday 25 June 2012, and consists of one train running from Auckland to Wellington on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and Wellington to Auckland on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. It has fewer stops than the Overlander, stopping only at Papakura, Hamilton, [[Otorohanga]], National Park, Ohakune, Palmerston North and Paraparaumu.\n\nThe [[Capital Connection (train)|Capital Connection]] commuter train operates between [[Palmerston North]] and Wellington.\n\nBoth KiwiRail and private enthusiast operators such as the Railway Enthusiasts Society, Mainline Steam and Steam Inc operate charter trains.\n\n===Auckland suburban===\n[[File:Britomart Outside Facade.jpg|thumb|The northern terminus of the NIMT, [[Britomart Transport Centre]].]]\n{{main|Public transport in Auckland|Auckland railway electrification}}\nSuburban trains run on the NIMT at regular intervals as follows:\n\n[[Eastern Line, Auckland|Eastern Line]] (Manukau to Britomart via Glen Innes) trains run on the NIMT between Puhinui and Britomart.\n\n[[Southern Line, Auckland|Southern Line]] (Papakura to Britomart via Otahuhu and Newmarket) trains run on the NIMT from Papakura to [[Westfield Junction]]. They then run on the [[North Auckland Line]] to Newmarket, and the [[Newmarket Line]] to the vicinity of [[Quay Park]], where they rejoin the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) into Britomart. A diesel train shuttle service runs on the NIMT between Pukekohe and Papakura.\n\n[[Onehunga Line]] and [[Western Line, Auckland|Western Line]] trains use the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) from the vicinity of Quay Park into Britomart.\n\n===Wellington suburban===\n[[File:Wellington Railway Station by night.

With a pair of tunnels under the Wellington hills, the deviation alleviated issues with more and heavier freight traffic on the steep and twisting original route where long sections at 1 in 60 gradient required banker engines. The Wellington to Johnsonville section of the original line was retained as the [[Johnsonville Line]] and the Johnsonville to Tawa section closed.\n\nThe sections from Plimmerton to South Junction, north of Pukerua Bay and Muri, and North Junction to Paekakariki were duplicated in 1940. From 24 July 1940 electrification at 1500 V DC of the southern section of the NIMT from Wellington to Paekakariki was completed.  The [[Tawa Flat deviation]] has a long tunnel (Tawa No 2)  not suitable for steam operation because of excessive smoke (although steam trains were temporarily operated in the new deviation from 1935). A Centralised Train Control (CTC) system was installed in 1940, so that new signal boxes were not required and five stations between Tawa and Pukerua Bay no longer had to be continually staffed for Tablet operation; see [[Kapiti Line#Duplication|Kapiti Line]]. Electrification eliminated the need to relieve the steep (1 in 57) gradients from Plimmerton to the Pukerua Bay summit by a deviation to the east and allowed more frequent suburban passenger trains (and allowed suburban electric multiple units to run on this section from September 1949).\n[[File:Electric Locomotives Near Paekakariki.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EW class locomotive|EW]]1805 hauling [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] 4611 near Paekakariki on the electrified Wellington section.

Some tunnels were opened out or bypassed by deviations while in others clearances were increased, and curves eased. The section between [[Ohakune]] and Horopito was realigned with three viaducts replaced to handle higher loads and speeds. The most notable bridge replaced was the curved metal viaduct at Hapuawhenua by a modern concrete structure, though the original has been restored as a tourist attraction.\n\nIn 2009\u201310, the 1.5&nbsp;km section of line between Wellington Junction and Distant Junction was rebuilt from double track to triple track, to ease peak-time congestion.\n\nIn February 2011 duplication between Paekakariki and Waikanae was completed as part of the upgrade and expansion of the Wellington suburban network; see [[Kapiti Line]] for more information.\n\nIn 2012\u201313 four bridges near Rangiriri between Auckland and Hamilton were replaced.

Wellington's urban network is electrified at ([[1500 V DC railway electrification|1500 V DC]]); as formerly used in other sections of the New Zealand  network. In Wellington the operating voltage has been increased to 1700 V DC since the full introduction of the [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|Matangi EMU]], to increase the power available.  \n \nElectrification of the NIMT was mooted by electrical engineer [[Evan Parry]] in the first volume of the ''New Zealand Journal of Science and Technology'' in November 1918. In light of a national coal shortage following [[World War I]], Parry argued that the network was under great strain due to ever-increasing volumes of freight, and the use of steam traction was partly to blame. Parry also noted that there was great potential for cheap hydro-electricity generation in the central North Island to power electrification.\n\nThe first part of the NIMT to be electrified was the [[Wellington]]\u2013[[Paekakariki railway station|Paekakariki]] section via the [[Tawa Flat deviation]] that was completed on 24 July 1940. This was largely to prevent smoke nuisance in the 4.3&nbsp;km No. 2 tunnel, and to provide for banking on the Paekakariki to Pukerua Bay section. Electric traction in this section is now used only by [[Transdev Wellington]] for Metlink suburban passenger services on the [[Kapiti Line]], and was extended to [[Paraparaumu railway station|Paraparaumu]] on 7 May 1983 and [[Waikanae railway station|Waikanae]] on 20 February 2011. Funded by the [[Greater Wellington Regional Council]], the extension to Waikanae coincided with the delivery of new [[New Zealand FP class electric multiple unit|FP class Matangi]] [[electric multiple unit]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|title=KiwiRail \u2013 Wellington Projects|date=22 September 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722185555/http://www.kiwirail.co.nz/index.php?page=wellington-projects|archivedate=22 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Second World War railway services suffered due to skill and coal shortages. Skilled staff sought employment opportunities elsewhere in the economy. From 1948 to 1951 the General Manager of the Railways Department, Francis William Aickin, advocated electrification of the entire line, despite protests from his engineering staff. Aickin had previously been Staff Superintendent and Chief Legal Advisor to the Department, and considered using diesel locomotives for trains on the NIMT to be too expensive. He turned his attention to electrification, mainly because he saw that it could relieve the coal situation and prevent high expenditure on imported fuels.\n\nHe commissioned a study into electrification, which concluded that a low-frequency AC system could be cheaper than 1500 V DC, the system in use in Wellington. Aickin sent a technical mission of four senior officers overseas in March 1949 and travelled overseas himself to negotiate a tentative contract with a British construction company. The Chief Mechanical Engineer and Chief Accountant specified and costed the system and Aickin was able to complete a substantial report justifying the NIMT electrification and submit it to the Government.\n\nOfficers from [[New Zealand Treasury]] and the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Ministry of Works]] and two experts from [[Sweden]] (Thelander and Edenius) commented on the proposal and in December 1950 the Government granted approval in principle and agreed to appoint Thelander as a consultant. However, Aickin fell out with the then National Government and retired as General Manager in July 1951. With the change in regime, the electrification proposal disappeared.\n\nA key assumption of Aickin's report was that traffic on the NIMT would grow by 50% from 1948 to 1961. Since a diesel-electric locomotive was in fact a travelling power station, the savings through electrification compared to diesel could be regarded as the difference between the cost of buying bulk electrical energy generated substantially from New Zealand resources and the cost of generating electricity in a small plant using imported diesel fuel.\n\nHowever, the Royal Commission on Railways created following Aickin's tenure rejected the report's findings. Aickin's successor, H.C. Lusty, revised the tentative contract with [[English Electric]] to specify [[NZR DF class (1954)|DF]] diesel-electric locomotives. They were later found to be unreliable, and only ten were supplied. 42 [[New Zealand DG and DH class locomotive|DG]] locomotives were supplied instead for secondary lines. For main lines including the NIMT, [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup> class]] diesel-electric locomotives were ordered from General Motors.\n\nThe {{convert|411|km|mi|abbr=on}} section between [[Palmerston North]] and [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] was electrified at 25 kV 50&nbsp;Hz [[alternating current|AC]], opened on 24 June 1988<ref name=\"nzro_winter_1988\">{{cite journal|journal=New Zealand Railway Observer|title=North Island Main Trunk Electrified|date=Autumn 1988|publisher=[[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]]|issn=0028-8624|volume=45| issue =  1|page=49|author=Tom McGavin}}</ref> as one of the [[Robert Muldoon|Muldoon]] [[Third National Government of New Zealand|National Government's]] \"[[Think Big]]\" energy development projects. An overall cost in excess of $100 million had been projected, with some 40% being for the locomotives, but the final cost was about $250 million. The economics of the project was greatly undermined by the fall of the price of oil in the 1980s and the deregulation of land transport, which removed the long-distance monopoly NZR held when the cost-benefit report was written.\n[[File:EF30163+Overlander NearWaiouru 22March2003 JChristianson.jpg|thumb|[[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF]]30163 hauling The [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] on the [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] section in 2003.]]\nThe electrification of the section, which had its genesis in a study group set up in June 1974 to report on measures to be taken to cope with increasing rail traffic volumes, received approval in 1980. This led to a technical study carried out with assistance from the Japanese [[Railway Technical Research Institute]]. The report stated that track capacity would be increased by electrification because such traction is faster and able to move more freight at once. The report stated, for example, that whereas a diesel locomotive could haul 720-tonne trains at {{convert|27|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} up the [[Raurimu Spiral]], an electric locomotive could haul 1100/1200-tonne trains at {{convert|45|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, cutting 3\u20135 hours off journey times. Less fuel would be needed and employing regenerative braking in electric locomotives lowers the fuel consumption further.\n\nElectrification's advantages were reflected in the economic evaluation in the report, which showed a rate of return of 18%. Sensitivity analysis showed that this high rate of return gave the project robustness against lower traffic volumes than expected (the return remained positive even if traffic fell), against significant increases in construction cost, and against lower than expected rises in the diesel fuel price.\n\nPart of the project included replacing the copper wire communications system with a new [[fiber optic|fibre optic]] communications cable (due to interference caused by AC power with the DC copper wire system) between Wellington and Auckland. In 1994 New Zealand Rail Limited sold the cable to [[Clear Communications]] for telephone traffic, leasing part of it back for signalling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canterbury.cyberplace.org.nz/community/CAFCA/cafca94/sept94.html|title=September 1994&nbsp;decisions|publisher=[[Campaign Against Foreign Control of Aotearoa]]}}</ref>\n\nProposals to [[Auckland railway electrification|electrify the Auckland suburban rail network]] dated back to the 1960s,{{sfn|Churchman & Hurst|2001|p=30}} they mainly coincided with proposals to electrify the NIMT in its entirety.

In 1932 the [[4-8-4]] [[NZR K class (1932)|K class]] was introduced, and later improved in 1939 with the [[NZR Ka class|K<sup>A</sup>]].\n\nThe introduction of the English Electric [[NZR DF class (1954)|D<sup>F</sup> class]] in 1954 began the end of the steam era, and in 1955 with the introduction of the [[New Zealand DA class locomotive|D<sup>A</sup>]] major withdrawals of steam locomotives began. 1972 saw the introduction of [[New Zealand DX class locomotive|D<sup>X</sup>]] locomotives and the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]] railcars: the latter remained in service between Auckland and Wellington until 1991.\n\nWith electrification and the introduction of the [[New Zealand EF class locomotive|EF class]] electric locomotives in the late 1980s, the DX class was mainly reassigned to other areas of the network, including hauling coal on the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] in the [[South Island]].

The daily \"Express\" left earlier in the evening, followed by the \"Limited\", which had fewer stops for passengers.\n\nBetween 1963 and 1968 daytime trains were called the [[Scenic Daylight]]. In 1968, an [[NZR RM class|RM class]] [[NZR RM class (88 seater)|88-seater]] [[railcar]] was refurbished and repainted in a distinctive blue scheme that led to it being nicknamed the Blue Streak. It initially operated an unsuccessful service between [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and Auckland in early 1968, and was transferred to the Auckland-Wellington run on 23 September 1968.\n[[File:Tolldc4093.jpg|thumb|A [[New Zealand DC class locomotive|DC]] hauls the now replaced [[Overlander (train)|Overlander]] long-distance passenger train between Auckland and Wellington.]]\nIn 1971 [[New Zealand Railways Department|NZR]] introduced the [[Silver Star (NZR train)|Silver Star]], a luxury sleeper train. The service was not economically viable, and was withdrawn in 1979. Much more successful was the [[NZR RM class (Silver Fern)|Silver Fern]], a daytime [[railcar]] service, introduced in 1972 to replace the \"Blue Streak\". This service was withdrawn in 1991 and replaced by [[Overlander (train)|The Overlander]].\n\nIn conjunction with the introduction of the carriage train Overlander service, the Silver Fern railcars were redeployed to start new services between Tauranga and Auckland \u2013 [[Kaimai Express]], and Auckland and Rotorua \u2013 [[Geyserland Express]], in 1991. In 2000 a new commuter service called the [[Waikato Connection]] was introduced between Hamilton and Auckland and ran in conjunction with the services to Tauranga and Rotorua until all three services were cancelled in 2001.\n\nOn 25 July 2006 Toll announced that the Overlander would cease at the end of September 2006, but on 28 September 2006 the train's continuation on a limited timetable was announced.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&ObjectID=10403445| title=Overlander to continue running| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] | date=28 September 2006| accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> It ran daily during the summer months and thrice-weekly for the balance of the year.\n\nIn 2012 KiwiRail announced the Overlander would be replaced by the [[Northern Explorer]], with new [[New Zealand AK class carriage|AK class carriages]] to provide a premium tourist train on a quicker timetable with fewer stops. It commenced on Monday 25 June 2012, and consists of one train running from Auckland to Wellington on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays, and Wellington to Auckland on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. It has fewer stops than the Overlander, stopping only at Papakura, Hamilton, [[Otorohanga]], National Park, Ohakune, Palmerston North and Paraparaumu.\n\nThe [[Capital Connection (train)|Capital Connection]] commuter train operates between [[Palmerston North]] and Wellington.\n\nBoth KiwiRail and private enthusiast operators such as the Railway Enthusiasts Society, Mainline Steam and Steam Inc operate charter trains.\n\n===Auckland suburban===\n[[File:Britomart Outside Facade.jpg|thumb|The northern terminus of the NIMT, [[Britomart Transport Centre]].]]\n{{main|Public transport in Auckland|Auckland railway electrification}}\nSuburban trains run on the NIMT at regular intervals as follows:\n\n[[Eastern Line, Auckland|Eastern Line]] (Manukau to Britomart via Glen Innes) trains run on the NIMT between Puhinui and Britomart.\n\n[[Southern Line, Auckland|Southern Line]] (Papakura to Britomart via Otahuhu and Newmarket) trains run on the NIMT from Papakura to [[Westfield Junction]]. They then run on the [[North Auckland Line]] to Newmarket, and the [[Newmarket Line]] to the vicinity of [[Quay Park]], where they rejoin the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) into Britomart. A diesel train shuttle service runs on the NIMT between Pukekohe and Papakura.\n\n[[Onehunga Line]] and [[Western Line, Auckland|Western Line]] trains use the NIMT only for the short section (about 500 metres) from the vicinity of Quay Park into Britomart.\n\n===Wellington suburban===\n[[File:Wellington Railway Station by night.

The [[leading edge slats|slats]] at its [[leading edge]] and the [[flap (aircraft)|flap]]s at its [[trailing edge]] are extended.]]\nAircraft wings may feature some of the following:\n*A rounded [[leading edge]] cross-section\n*A sharp [[trailing edge]] cross-section\n*Leading-edge devices such as [[leading edge slats|slats]], [[leading edge slot|slots]], or [[leading edge extension|extension]]s\n*Trailing-edge devices such as [[flap (aircraft)|flap]]s or flaperons (combination of flaps and ailerons)\n*[[Winglets]] to keep wingtip vortices from increasing drag and decreasing lift\n*[[Dihedral (aircraft)|Dihedral]], or a positive wing angle to the horizontal, increases ''spiral stability'' around the roll axis, whereas ''anhedral'', or a negative wing angle to the horizontal, decreases spiral stability.\n\nAircraft wings may have various devices, such as flaps or slats that the pilot uses to modify the shape and surface area of the wing to change its operating characteristics in flight.\n*[[Aileron]]s (usually near the wingtips) to roll the aircraft clockwise or counterclockwise about its long axis\n*[[Spoiler (aeronautics)|Spoiler]]s on the upper surface to disrupt the lift and to provide additional traction to an aircraft that has just landed but is still moving.\n*[[Vortex generator]]s to help prevent flow separation in transonic flow\n*[[Wing fence]]s to keep flow attached to the wing by stopping boundary layer separation from spreading roll direction. \n*[[Folding wing]]s allow more aircraft storage in the confined space of the [[hangar|hangar deck]] of an [[aircraft carrier]]\n*[[Variable-sweep wing]] or \"swing wings\" that allow outstretched wings during low-speed flight (i.e., take-off and landing) and [[swept wing|swept back wing]]s for high-speed flight (including [[supersonic flight]]), such as in the [[F-111 Aardvark]], the [[F-14 Tomcat]], the [[Panavia Tornado]], the [[MiG-23]], the [[MiG-27]], the [[Tu-160]] and the [[B-1B Lancer]] warplanes\n* [[Strake (aeronautics)|Strake]]s to improve flight characteristics\n* [[Chine (aeronautics)|Chine]], which may blend into the wing\n* [[Leading-edge droop flap]], a high-lift device\n* [[Aircraft fairing|Fairing]]s, structures whose primary function is to produce a smooth outline and reduce drag. For example, flap track fairings\n\nWings may have other [[Wing configuration#Minor independent surfaces|minor independent surfaces]].\n\n==Applications and variants==\n{{refimprove|section|date=March 2019}}\nBesides [[fixed-wing aircraft]], applications for wing shapes include:\n*[[Hang glider]]s, which use wings ranging from fully flexible ([[paraglider]]s, gliding [[parachute]]s), flexible (framed sail wings), to rigid\n*[[Kite types|Kites]], which use a variety of lifting surfaces\n*[[Free flight (model aircraft)|Flying model airplane]]s\n*[[Helicopter]]s, which use a rotating wing with a variable pitch angle to provide directional forces\n*[[Propeller]]s, whose blades generate lift for propulsion.\n*The [[NASA]] [[Space Shuttle]], which uses its wings only to glide during its descent to a runway. These types of aircraft are called [[spaceplane]]s.\n*Some [[racing cars]], especially [[Formula One car]]s, which use upside-down wings (or ''[[airfoil]]s'') to provide greater traction at high speeds\n*[[Sailboat]]s, which use sails as vertical wings with variable fullness and direction to move across water\n\n===In nature===\nIn nature, wings have [[evolution|evolved]] in insects, [[pterosaurs]], dinosaurs ([[bird]]s), and mammals ([[bats]]) as a means of [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]]. Various species of [[penguin]]s and other flighted or [[flightless bird|flightless]] water birds such as [[auk]]s, [[cormorant]]s, [[guillemot]]s, [[shearwater]]s, [[eider duck|eider]] and scoter ducks and diving [[petrels]] are avid swimmers, and use their wings to propel through water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/stanfordbirds/text/essays/Swimming.html|title=Swimming|publisher=Stanford.edu|date=|accessdate=2012-04-25}}</ref>\n<center>\n;Wing forms in nature\n</center>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:PSM V19 D181 Various seeds of trees.jpg|Winged tree seeds that cause [[Autorotation (helicopter)|autorotation]] in descent\nFile:Seagull wing.jpg|A [[laughing gull]], exhibiting the \"[[gull wing]]\" outline.\nFile:PikiWiki_Israel_11327_Wildlife_and_Plants_of_Israel-Bat-003.jpg|Bat in flight\n</gallery>\n\n===Tensile structures===\nIn 1948, [[Francis Rogallo]] invented a kite-like [[Rogallo wing|tensile wing]] supported by inflated or rigid struts, which ushered in new possibilities for aircraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4308/ch11.htm#382 |title=Rogallo Wing -the story told by NASA |publisher=History.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-23}}</ref> Near in time, [[Domina Jalbert]] invented flexible un-sparred ram-air airfoiled thick wings.
