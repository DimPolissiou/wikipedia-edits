It was originally invented for characterizing the seismic [[Echo (phenomenon)|echoes]] resulting from [[earthquake]]s and [[bomb]] explosions. It has also been used to determine the fundamental frequency of human speech and to analyze [[radar]] signal returns. Cepstrum pitch determination is particularly effective because the effects of the vocal excitation (pitch) and [[vocal tract]] (formants) are additive in the logarithm of the power spectrum and thus clearly separate.<ref name=noll67/>\n\nThe autocepstrum is defined as the cepstrum of the [[autocorrelation]]. The autocepstrum is more accurate than the cepstrum in the analysis of data with echoes.\n\nThe cepstrum is a representation used in [[homomorphic filtering|homomorphic signal processing]], to convert signals combined by [[convolution]] (such as a source and filter) into sums of their cepstra, for linear separation. In particular, the power cepstrum is often used as a feature vector for representing the human voice and musical signals. For these applications, the spectrum is usually first transformed using the [[mel scale]]. The result is called the [[mel-frequency cepstrum]] or MFC (its coefficients are called mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, or MFCCs). It is used for voice identification, [[pitch detection algorithm|pitch detection]] and much more. The cepstrum is useful in these applications because the low-frequency periodic excitation from the [[vocal cord]]s and the [[formant]] filtering of the [[vocal tract]], which convolve in the [[time domain]] and multiply in the [[frequency domain]], are additive and in different regions in the quefrency domain.\n\nRecently cepstrum based deconvolution was used to remove the effect of the stochastic impulse trains, which originates an [[Electromyography#Surface_and_intramuscular_EMG_recording_electrodes|sEMG]] signal, from the power spectrum of sEMG signal itself. In this way, only information on motor unit action potential (MUAP) shape and amplitude were maintained, and then, used to estimate the parameters of a time-domain model of the MUAP itself.<ref>G. Biagetti, P. Crippa, S. Orcioni, and C. Turchetti, \u201cHomomorphic deconvolution for muap estimation from surface emg signals,\u201d IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, vol. 21, no. 2, pp. 328\u2013 338, March 2017.</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Quefrency}}Cepstral concepts==\n\nThe [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]] of a cepstral graph is called the '''quefrency'''.<ref name=\"Steinbuch-Weber_1974\">{{cite book |title=Taschenbuch der Informatik - Band III - Anwendungen und spezielle Systeme der Nachrichtenverarbeitung |language=German |editor-first1=Karl W. |editor-last1=Steinbuch |editor-link1=Karl W.

For example, if the sampling rate of an audio signal is 44100&nbsp;Hz and there is a large peak in the cepstrum whose quefrency is 100 samples, the peak indicates the presence of a fundamental frequency that is 44100/100 = 441&nbsp;Hz. This peak occurs in the cepstrum because the harmonics in the spectrum are periodic and the period corresponds to the fundamental frequency, since harmonics are integer multiples of said fundamental frequency. \n\nNote that a pure sine wave can not be used to test the cepstrum for its pitch determination from quefrency as a pure sine wave does not contain any harmonics and does not lead to quefrency peaks. Rather, a test signal containing harmonics should be used (such as the sum of at least two sines where the second sine is some harmonic (multiple) of the first sine, or better, a signal with a square or triangle waveform, as such signals provide many overtones in the spectrum.).\n\n=={{anchor|Filter}}Filtering==\n\nPlaying further on the anagram theme, a filter that operates on a cepstrum might be called a ''lifter''. A low-pass lifter is similar to a low-pass filter in the [[frequency domain]]. It can be implemented by multiplying by a window in the quefrency domain and then converting back to the frequency domain, resulting in a modified signal, i.e. with signal echo beeing reduced.\n\n==Convolution==\n\nA very important property of the cepstral domain is that the [[convolution]] of two signals can be expressed as the addition of their complex cepstra:\n\n: <math>x_1 * x_2 \\mapsto x'_1 + x'_2.</math>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* D.

It was in use before the cepstrum.<ref>\n\"Predictive decomposition of time series with applications to seismic exploration\", E. A.

It was originally invented for characterizing the seismic [[Echo (phenomenon)|echoes]] resulting from [[earthquake]]s and [[bomb]] explosions. It has also been used to determine the fundamental frequency of human speech and to analyze [[radar]] signal returns. Cepstrum pitch determination is particularly effective because the effects of the vocal excitation (pitch) and [[vocal tract]] (formants) are additive in the logarithm of the power spectrum and thus clearly separate.<ref name=noll67/>\n\nThe autocepstrum is defined as the cepstrum of the [[autocorrelation]]. The autocepstrum is more accurate than the cepstrum in the analysis of data with echoes.\n\nThe cepstrum is a representation used in [[homomorphic filtering|homomorphic signal processing]], to convert signals combined by [[convolution]] (such as a source and filter) into sums of their cepstra, for linear separation. In particular, the power cepstrum is often used as a feature vector for representing the human voice and musical signals. For these applications, the spectrum is usually first transformed using the [[mel scale]]. The result is called the [[mel-frequency cepstrum]] or MFC (its coefficients are called mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, or MFCCs). It is used for voice identification, [[pitch detection algorithm|pitch detection]] and much more. The cepstrum is useful in these applications because the low-frequency periodic excitation from the [[vocal cord]]s and the [[formant]] filtering of the [[vocal tract]], which convolve in the [[time domain]] and multiply in the [[frequency domain]], are additive and in different regions in the quefrency domain.\n\nRecently cepstrum based deconvolution was used to remove the effect of the stochastic impulse trains, which originates an [[Electromyography#Surface_and_intramuscular_EMG_recording_electrodes|sEMG]] signal, from the power spectrum of sEMG signal itself. In this way, only information on motor unit action potential (MUAP) shape and amplitude were maintained, and then, used to estimate the parameters of a time-domain model of the MUAP itself.<ref>G. Biagetti, P. Crippa, S. Orcioni, and C. Turchetti, \u201cHomomorphic deconvolution for muap estimation from surface emg signals,\u201d IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, vol. 21, no. 2, pp. 328\u2013 338, March 2017.</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Quefrency}}Cepstral concepts==\n\nThe [[Dependent and independent variables|independent variable]] of a cepstral graph is called the '''quefrency'''.<ref name=\"Steinbuch-Weber_1974\">{{cite book |title=Taschenbuch der Informatik - Band III - Anwendungen und spezielle Systeme der Nachrichtenverarbeitung |language=German |editor-first1=Karl W. |editor-last1=Steinbuch |editor-link1=Karl W.

For example, if the sampling rate of an audio signal is 44100&nbsp;Hz and there is a large peak in the cepstrum whose quefrency is 100 samples, the peak indicates the presence of a fundamental frequency that is 44100/100 = 441&nbsp;Hz. This peak occurs in the cepstrum because the harmonics in the spectrum are periodic and the period corresponds to the fundamental frequency, since harmonics are integer multiples of said fundamental frequency. \n\nNote that a pure sine wave can not be used to test the cepstrum for its pitch determination from quefrency as a pure sine wave does not contain any harmonics and does not lead to quefrency peaks. Rather, a test signal containing harmonics should be used (such as the sum of at least two sines where the second sine is some harmonic (multiple) of the first sine, or better, a signal with a square or triangle waveform, as such signals provide many overtones in the spectrum.).\n\n=={{anchor|Filter}}Filtering==\n\nPlaying further on the anagram theme, a filter that operates on a cepstrum might be called a ''lifter''. A low-pass lifter is similar to a low-pass filter in the [[frequency domain]]. It can be implemented by multiplying by a window in the quefrency domain and then converting back to the frequency domain, resulting in a modified signal, i.e. with signal echo beeing reduced.\n\n==Convolution==\n\nA very important property of the cepstral domain is that the [[convolution]] of two signals can be expressed as the addition of their complex cepstra:\n\n: <math>x_1 * x_2 \\mapsto x'_1 + x'_2.</math>\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* D.

During the Reformation, Esztergom welcomed Jewish merchants and craftsmen, who built a synagogue for themselves. In 1858 another synagogue was erected on the site of today's synagogue - in the former village of Szenttam\u00e1s {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}. About thirty years later, architect [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]], along with his colleague, [[Lip\u00f3t Baumhorn]], was commissioned to design a new synagogue. This was Baumhorn's first solo work. The synagogue was designed in the style of late romance, originally single-story with a gallery for the women of the congregation. It was inaugurated in 1888 by [[Ign\u00e1c Weisz]], rabbi of Esztergom and [[Immanuel L\u00f6w|Imm\u00e1nuel L\u0151w]], the rabbi of [[Szeged]] {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}. Until World War II, it was frequented by the Jews of Esztergom and the surrounding villages. During World War II, the synagogue was bombed and badly damaged. Most of the Jews \u2014 about five hundred \u2014 were deported, and have not had a significant community in the city ever since. Since then, only the name Imah\u00e1z utca remains of the original purpose of the building {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\nThe empty building was awarded in 1964 to the organisation of ATNSA (Association of Technical and Natural Science Associations) in the city. This was when the first major renovations began. Space was partitioned with reinforced concrete slabs, breaking down the women's gallery. From 1980 to 1981, it housed the Tech House, which until 2006 served as a conference centre. Over the next few years, the organisation has continually renovated and completely restructured to be able to hold conferences and lectures. It has created lecture rooms, interpreting booths, rooms suitable for receptions, and district heating has been introduced. In 1996, the roof and dome shells were renovated. Accordingly, several prestigious events took place between the walls of the former Jewish temple. Politicians often gave lectures here on their tours {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}. In 2006, the municipality bought the Technika House for 70 million HUF. After that, the office of the Ister-Granum Euroregion operated there for a short time, until in 2008 it moved to the building of the County Hall of Botty\u00e1n J\u00e1nos Street {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe two-story monument synagogue is 1216 square meters. On both sides of the fa\u00e7ade, there is a column-shaped, tower-like part of the building. These are connected by a triple-arched, arcade foyer. There is a conference room upstairs with interpreting booths. The original 1888 marble staircase leads here. \n\nThe Martyr Monument in front of the building was made according to the plans of Istv\u00e1n Martsa. The original 2.5-meter bronze work was made for the monument competition in Mauthausen and was placed in the Hungarian barracks of the Auschwitz camp museum. Today's statue was erected in 1985. Its pedestal is a bonfire made of railway sleepers.

There are references to a synagogue in Esztergom dating back as early as 1050.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Patai|first=Raphael|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LLuPS1yVDf8C&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq=Esztergom+1050+year+synagogue&source=bl&ots=yDFE5i4J0h&sig=ACfU3U35PE7HquvF-8XZKqyrw-48C4YI6g&hl=en&ppis=_e&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj_m9H9gNXoAhUEHc0KHdpBDlgQ6AEwFHoECAsQLA#v=onepage&q=Esztergom%201050%20year%20synagogue&f=false|title=The Jews of Hungary: History, Culture, Psychology|date=1996|publisher=Wayne State University Press|isbn=978-0-8143-2561-2|language=en}}</ref> This is evidenced by the fact that two Jewish merchants from Regensburg, who came to the city from Russia, met their comrades in front of the synagogue. During the Reformation, Esztergom welcomed Jewish merchants and craftsmen, who built a synagogue for themselves. In 1858 another synagogue was erected on the site of today's synagogue - in the former village of Szenttam\u00e1s {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}. About thirty years later, architect [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]], along with his colleague, [[Lip\u00f3t Baumhorn]], was commissioned to design a new synagogue. This was Baumhorn's first solo work. The synagogue was designed in the style of late romance, originally single-story with a gallery for the women of the congregation. It was inaugurated in 1888 by [[Ign\u00e1c Weisz]], rabbi of Esztergom and [[Immanuel L\u00f6w|Imm\u00e1nuel L\u0151w]], the rabbi of [[Szeged]] {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}. Until World War II, it was frequented by the Jews of Esztergom and the surrounding villages. During World War II, the synagogue was bombed and badly damaged. Most of the Jews \u2014 about five hundred \u2014 were deported, and have not had a significant community in the city ever since. Since then, only the name Imah\u00e1z utca remains of the original purpose of the building {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\nThe empty building was awarded in 1964 to the organization of MTESZ (Association of Technical and Natural Science Associations) in the city. This was when the first major renovations began. Space was partitioned with reinforced concrete slabs, breaking down the women's gallery. From 1980 to 1981, it housed the Tech House, which until 2006 served as a conference center. Over the next few years, the organization has continually renovated and completely restructured to be able to hold conferences and lectures. It has created lecture rooms, interpreting booths, rooms suitable for receptions, and district heating has been introduced. In 1996, the roof and dome shells were renovated. Accordingly, several prestigious events took place between the walls of the former Jewish temple. Politicians often gave lectures here on their tours {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}. In 2006, the municipality bought the Technika House for 70 million HUF. After that, the office of the Ister-Granum Euroregion operated there for a short time, until in 2008 it moved to the building of the County Hall of Botty\u00e1n J\u00e1nos Street {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe two-story monument synagogue is 1216 square meters. On both sides of the fa\u00e7ade, there is a column-shaped, tower-like part of the building. These are connected by a triple-arched, arcaded foyer. There is a conference room upstairs with interpreting booths. The original 1888 marble staircase leads here. \n\nThe Martyr Monument in front of the building was made according to the plans of Istv\u00e1n Martsa. The original 2.5-meter bronze work was made for the monument competition in Mauthausen and was placed in the Hungarian barracks of the Auschwitz camp museum. Today's statue was erected in 1985. Its pedestal is a bonfire made of railway sleepers. A plaque commemorates the abductees on the wall of the building {{citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\n== Sources ==\n* [http://epiteszforum.hu/node/12112 \u00c9p\u00edt\u00e9szf\u00f3rum - Az esztergomi zsinag\u00f3ga \u00fajj\u00e1\u00e9led\u00e9se]\n* Pifk\u00f3 P\u00e9ter \u2013 Zachar Anna:Esztergom helyt\u00f6rt\u00e9neti kronol\u00f3gi\u00e1ja a kezdetekt\u0151l 1950-ig\n* Kom\u00e1rom-Esztergom megye m\u0171eml\u00e9kjegyz\u00e9ke (2006)\n* Esztergom 2000 enciklop\u00e9dia\n* Annales Strigonienses 1994, 145. o.\n\n[[Category:Synagogues in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Esztergom]]\n{{improve categories|date=April 2020}}\n<references />\n[[Category:Synagogues by century]]\n[[Category:20]]\n__INDEX__\n__NEWSECTIONLINK__\n", "name_user": "SukhvirSingh110", "label": "safe", "comment": "I made some changes in spelling errors.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esztergom_Synagogue"}

The [[50th Indian Parachute Brigade]] was formed on 27 October 1941, comprising the British [[156th Parachute Battalion (United Kingdom)|151st Parachute Battalion]], the [[British Indian Army]] 152nd Indian Parachute Battalion, and the 153rd Gurkha Parachute Battalion.<ref name=\"Global Sec Para Rgt\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-para.htm Parachute Regiment, India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100338/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-para.htm |date=22 February 2014 }} on GlobalSecurity.org</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soc.mil/ARSOF_History/articles/v14n2_vajra_prahar_sb_parachute.html|title=Sidebar: Indian Army Parachute Regiment: A Brief History|last=|first=|date=2018|website=United States Army Special Operations Command|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> The Parachute Regiment was formed from these and several other units in 1952.\n\nIn 1944, the 50th was allocated to the newly founded [[44th Airborne Division (India)|44th Airborne Division]]. In the post-independence restructuring, India retained only one parachute brigade\u2014the 50th. This brigade consisted of three distinguished battalions personally nominated by the then Commander-in-Chief, namely 1 PARA (Punjab), 2 PARA (Maratha) and 3 PARA (Kumaon). During the [[Jammu and Kashmir]] operations of 1947-48 these battalions distinguished themselves with glory in the battles of Shelatang, [[Nowshera, Jammu and Kashmir|Naushera]], Jhangar and [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]], and were awarded the respective Battle Honours.\n\nOn 15 April 1952, the three battalions serving with the Parachute Brigade were removed from their respective Infantry Regiments to form the Parachute Regiment. Since then the Parachute Regiment has grown to comprise ten battalions including Parachute (Special Forces) battalions. In 1986, 8 PARA became 12 Battalion, Mechanised Infantry Regiment, while 21 Maratha LI converted to PARA (Special Forces). During their short but eventful existence so far, the regiment's battalions have had extensive operational experience, and singular achievements, to speak of their level of professionalism.\n\nDuring the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], an ''ad hoc'' commando unit, named Meghdoot Force, consisting of volunteers from various infantry units was organized by then Major Megh Singh of the [[Brigade of the Guards]]. The unit performed well in combat, and the Government authorized the formal raising of a commando unit. [[Megh Singh|Lt Col Megh Singh]] was selected to raise the unit which was originally intended to be a part of the Brigade of the Guards. However, recognizing parachute qualification as an integral element of special operations, the unit was transferred to the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]] and raised as its 9th Battalion (Commando) on 1 July 1966. The erstwhile members of the Meghdoot Force formed the nucleus, and the new unit was based in [[Gwalior]]. In June 1967 the unit was split equally into two to form a second commando unit, designated as 10th Battalion, each with three Companies.  10th Battalion was mandated to operate in the [[Thar Desert|Western Desert]] and 9th Battalion in the northern mountains. In 1969, these battalions were re-designated as 9 and 10 Para (Commando) battalions.<ref name=\"Global Sec Para Rgt\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 1978, the 1 Para, as an experiment, was converted to become the first special forces unit of the Indian army, and was kept as the tactical reserve. Already a recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice, and the [[General officer commanding|GOC-in-C]] Eastern Command Unit Citation once, the unit was originally 1 Punjab, which was later re-designated as 1 PARA (PUNJAB) and in 1978 was converted to 1 PARA (SF). The unit is well over 200 years old.\n\nOn 15 January 1992, the Parachute Regiment Training Centre along with the Records and PAO(OR), and the Para Regiment, moved to Bangalore and occupied the erstwhile location of Pioneer Corps and Training Centre.

After a stringent selection and training process that spanned more than a year, on 1 February 1996, the unit under Colonel VB Shinde, was formally inducted as the 21st Battalion (Special Forces), The Parachute Regiment. The unit has done well in its short lifespan and is the proud recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice (1992 and 2006) and the GOC-in-C Eastern Command Unit Citation once (2008), as well as a host of individual gallantry awards. With the changing scenario in military operations and the need for more special forces units, 2 Para began the conversion process from parachute to special forces role, followed closely by the 3 Para and the 4 Para in the year 2004 and 2005. The attempt did see a some success, but the reason it failed to achieve its goal was due to the stringent selection process.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===1971 Indo-Pakistan War===\nThe unit first saw action in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Indo-Pakistani war]], the first six-man assault team was inserted {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=off}} deep into Indus and Charchao, where they carried out raids. The assault team killed 73 and wounded 140 on the Pakistani side. In addition, they also destroyed 35mm artillery guns of the Pakistan independent battery. They also destroyed an airfield. In Bangladesh 2 PARA (Airborne), which was a part of 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade, carried out India's first airborne assault operation to capture Poongli Bridge in Mymensingh District near Dhaka. Subsequently, they were the first unit to enter Dhaka. For this action 2 PARA were given the Battle Honour of Poongli Bridge and the Theater Honour Dhaka.<ref name=popl>{{cite book|last=Rao|first=K.

During the operation, six artillery guns were destroyed by a raiding team composed of six officers and around 120 soldiers led by Major C. M. Malhotra. The special forces raiders began their operation at 5.30 PM on 13 December 1971. They started off from [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]] and crossed the [[Poonch River]]. After they reached the Mandole village, they started searching for the artillery guns and eventually located them. The raiders divided themselves into six teams. Each one of the six team was tasked to destroy one of the six guns. Subsequently, an intense [[gunfight]] took place between the Indian raiders and [[Pakistan Army]] soldiers. The gunfight resulted in two Indian casualties and many Pakistani casualties, with some Pakistani soldiers escaping from the battle. Finally, the raiders destroyed all the artillery using explosives and returned to their base at 6.30 AM on 14 December 1971.<ref name=mandhol>{{cite web |title=Operation 'Mandhol' forced Pakistan to change war plan |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Operation-Mandhol-forced-Pakistan-to-change-war-plan/articleshow/27444282.cms |website=[[The Times of India]] |accessdate=27 February 2020 |date=16 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis operation caused the Pakistan military to tweak its military doctrine by assigning additional soldiers for defending artillery guns. [[Pakistan Army]] officials, who came to India as a delegation after the war had ended, acknowledged the raid. Operation Mandhol is now a part of the syllabus at the [[Indian Military Academy]].<ref name=\"mandhol\" />\n\n==== Chachro Raid ====\nA series of raids were conducted by soldiers from the 10 Para (also known as ''The Desert Scorpions'') at [[Chachro]], Virawah, [[Nagarparkar]] and [[Islamkot]] during the [[1971 Indo-Pakistani war]]. The objective of these raids were to hit [[Pakistan military]] installations located 80 kilometres inside hostile territory, disrupting supply lines, creating confusion and undertake important inroads into hostile territory. Two teams, codenamed Alpha and Charlie, trained for a duration of five months in skills such as [[desert warfare]].<ref name=\"chachro raid\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/the-chachro-raid-of-1971-indias-most-daring-surgical-strike-in-pakistan-1336153.html|title=The Chachro Raid of 1971 \u2013 India's Most Daring Surgical Strike in Pak|last=|first=|date=January 15, 2017|website=[[CNN-News18]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n\nDuring the raids, the Indian commandos inserted themselves 80 kilometres deep into Pakistani territory and traversed a distance of over 500 kilometres, attacking [[Pakistan military]] installations and positions. They completed the raids with zero Indian casualties.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nThe raids began on 5 December 1971, when commandos from the 10 Para penetrated 70 kilometres inside hostile territory. The soldiers went into a defensive posture as they encountered heavy firing from Pakistani posts. The Indian raiders sent one of their vehicles rushing towards Pakistani positions, firing a [[Light machine gun|LMG]], to distract gunfire. This tactic was successful because of the cover provided by nighttime. Subsequently, the other raiders too opened fire and overpowered the Pakistani posts.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nSoon, a [[Pathfinder (military)|pathfinder]] team was assigned the task of charting a route for the Alpha team to attack the wing headquarters of the [[Pakistan Rangers]] in [[Chachro]]. The pathfinders used the cover of darkness to chart a suitable route and green-lighted the raid before the dawn of December 7. Within a few hours, the team killed 17 Pakistani soldiers, took 12 prisoners and captured [[Chachro]]. After this raid, the Charlie team exfiltrated out of the battlefield. [[Chachro]] was subsequently handed over to Indian [[Infantry|infantrymen]] and the Alpha team proceeded further.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nThe Alpha team moved towards their next targets: Virawah and [[Nagarparkar]]. They reached Virawah before the dawn of December 8, moving in broad daylight the preceding day. The first contact made by the raiders with the Pakistani soldiers was at 1:30 AM. [[Hand-to-hand combat]] between the Indian raiders and the Pakistanis ensued, followed by [[Shootout|gunfights]]. Soon, Virawah was captured by the Indian raiders. The raiders then proceeded to [[Nagarparkar]] and captured it by the morning of December 8.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nFollowing this, the Indian raiders had returned to their base in India but were again tasked to attack ammunition dump in [[Islamkot]]. The raiders reached their target at 5:30 AM on December 17 but found the target empty. Subsequently, while retreating, the raiders ambushed a Pakistani convoy, killing 18-20 Pakistani troops and imprisoning survivors.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\n===Operation Bluestar 1984===\nIn 1984 the Para (SF) were involved in [[Operation Blue Star]]. They were charged to lead an attack on the Holy Site of the Sikh religion the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] to evict Sikh militants in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]. 80 members of 1 Para (SF) were given the task of assaulting two areas of the temple, one of which required divers. However, there were a number of setbacks as a result of inaccurate intelligence on the strength of the militants who were trained by Gen. [[Shabeg Singh]] (ex- 1 Para himself), operating in low light, the conventional manner of the raid, and the lack of incentive, all of which resulted in a mission failure. The diver mission was aborted after the first team got bogged down. The commandos accompanied by Raghunath dubey achieved their aims after a gunfight with militants that lasted hours.<ref name=\"Katoch\">{{cite web |title=Interview Lt Gen P.C.

However, the lack of proper planning by the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF), and insufficient intelligence on the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]]'s (LTTE) whereabouts, caused [[Jaffna University Helidrop|the initial heli-borne assault]] on Jaffna University on 11 October 1987 to be a tragic failure. However it was because of the efforts of the Para (SF) that later led to the capture of the Jaffna peninsula, forcing the LTTE militants to take refuge in the forests.\n\nSix soldiers lost their lives in that mission. Due to their superior training, the Para (SF) took refuge under a house, after they were misled by a youth who offered his services to help the commandos track [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] but instead took them on a wild goose chase. They engaged the enemy for 24 hours and picked up all their dead with their weapons after reinforcements arrived the next morning.\n\nAfter the failed assault on Jaffna City, the 10 Para (SF) participated in a heli-borne assault on the town of Moolai {{convert|23|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the north west in November 1987. More than 200 LTTE guerrillas were killed and an arms depot seized. In order to give the commandos battle experience, 1 Para (SF) was rotated home in early 1988 and replaced by 9 Para (SF).\n\nThis battalion was scheduled to return home in June 1988, but the tour of duty was extended due to a planned air assault into the coastal swamps around [[Mullaitivu District|Mullaittivu]]. The mission was a success, in that it located several arms caches. The 9 Para (SF) also provided 12 men for the security of the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka.\n\n===Operation Cactus 1988, Maldives===\n{{Main|Operation Cactus}}\nWith the capture of [[Maldives]], an island nation off the south western coast of India, on 3 November 1988 by the [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam]] (PLOTE) [[mercenaries]], the army turned to the 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade to carry out an airborne/air transported operation to liberate the country and return power to the legal government. This operation had 6 PARA spearheading the mission. 6 Para flew in on 4 November 1988 in a fleet of [[IL-76]], [[An-32]] and [[An-12]] transport aircraft. One team rescued the president, another took over the airfield, and a third rescued Maldivian security personnel besieged in the [[National Security Service (Maldives)|National Security Service]] HQ. Later 7 Para and part of 17 Para Field Regiment were also deployed to the Maldives. When mercenaries tried to escape by sea along with hostages, they were intercepted by the [[Indian navy]]. Thus, 6 Para, and the 17 Para Field Regiment conducted the first-ever international intervention by the [[Indian army]] without any loss of life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/operation-cactus-how-indian-troops-went-to-maldives-and-helped-quell-a-coup/articleshow/62816787.cms|title=Operation Cactus: How Indian troops went to Maldives and helped quell a coup|last=|first=|last2=|date=7 February 2018|website=[[The Times of India]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-17|last3=|first3=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thequint.com/news/india/operation-cactus-maldives-crisis-should-india-intervene-again|title=Operation Cactus: The Day India Saved the Maldives|date=2018-02-06|website=The Quint|language=en|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref>\n\n===1999 Kargil War===\n{{Main|Kargil War}}\nIn 1999 nine out of ten Parachute battalions were deployed for Operation Vijay in Kargil, which bears testimony to the operational profile of the Regiment. While the Parachute Brigade cleared the Mushkoh Valley intrusions, 5 PARA was actively involved in the forgotten sector of Batalik, and was awarded the Chief of Army Staff (COASS) Unit Citation.\n\n===Operation Khukri 2000, Sierra Leone===\n[[Operation Khukri]] was a rescue mission conducted by the 2 PARA (SF) in Sierra Leone in June 2000. About 90 operators commanded by Major (now Lt. Col.) Harinder Sood were airlifted from New Delhi to spearhead the mission to rescue 223 men of the 5/8 Gurkha Rifles who were surrounded and held captive by [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF) rebels for over 75 days just 90 Para (SF) forced 2000-5000 members of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) divided into 5 battalions to surrender. This ultimately led to the liberation of Freetown.\n\n===Operation Summer Storm 2009===\nOn 11 April 2009, the 57 Mountain Division of the Indian Army based in Manipur, Para Commandos along with the para-military Assam Rifles and State Police, launched a counter insurgency operation, code-named \"Operation Summer Storm\" in the Loktak Lake region and adjoining [[Loktak Lake]] in Bishnupur District, located south of State capital of Imphal. The first major mobilization of troops in 2009 ended on 21 April. As the troops began pulling out, an Army spokesperson described the operation as a success, disclosing that 129 militants, all belonging to the [[People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak]] (PREPAK) were killed. The Forces also claimed to have located and destroyed five militant camps during the Operation and more than 117 weapons, including sixty nine AK-series rifles, forty-eight rocket launchers, and an unspecified quantity of explosives and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). No militant was arrested. No fatalities among the Special Force (SF) personnel or civilians was reported.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idsa.in/TWIR/4_3_2009_Manipur|title=Manipur: Operation \u2018Summer Storm\u2019 called off {{!}} Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses|website=idsa.in|language=en|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/myanmar-operation-sends-a-larger-political-message-india-will-pay-back-if-provoked/articleshow/47657355.cms|title=Myanmar operation sends a larger political message: India will pay back, if provoked|date=2015-06-14|work=The Economic Times|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/operation-summer-storm-392192|title=Operation Summer Storm|work=NDTV.com|access-date=2018-03-07}}</ref>\n\n===Ongoing counter-insurgency operations in Kashmir and in northeastern India===\n{{external media\n| image1 = [https://spiderimg.amarujala.com/assets/images/2020/01/31/750x506/nagrota-terror-attack_1580463635.jpeg Para SF operators arrive to take position] before a gunfight took place at a toll plaza in Nagrota, Jammu and Kashmir in January 2020.

Sometimes these units work with the [[Rashtriya Rifles]] (COIN force) in complicated operations. Since the mid-1990s, the role of Paratroopers and Para (SF) as a counter terrorism force has increased substantially. They are now actively involved in counter terrorist (CT) and COIN operations in Kashmir as an essential part of the Home Ministry's decision to conduct pro-active raids against militants in the countryside and mountains. Personnel include Para (SF), Paratroopers (Airborne), [[National Security Guards]] (NSG) and special units of the [[Rashtriya Rifles]] - a paramilitary unit created for counter insurgency operations in Kashmir.

The terrorists sneaked across the border early on Thursday, barely three days ahead of a meeting between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan. The attack was on a police station. The 16 Cavalry unit of the Army in Samba district falls under the jurisdiction of 9 corps, headquartered at Yol Cantonment in Himachal Pradesh. The three heavily armed terrorists, believed to be from the group [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] (LeT), were holed up in the cavalry armored unit's camp at Samba for several hours after they barged into the Officers mess, until they were killed during a fierce gunfight with 1 Para (SF) of the army.

The Para (SF) commandos first carried out an aerial reconnaissance of the camp before landing to neutralize the three terrorists. The 1 Para (SF) had identified the exact spot during the aerial reconnaissance from where the intruders were returning the army fire. After landing, the commandos started engaging the terrorists in a direct gunfight, but in order to give them an impression that their exact hiding location had still not been identified, an abandoned building inside the camp was blasted. This made the terrorists complacent thinking that their hiding spot had not been yet been pin-pointed. They kept on intermittently returning army fire until all three of them were eliminated. The entire operation, from the moment the terrorists entered the camp until they were gunned down, took nearly nine hours to complete. The main worry of the soldiers tasked to eliminate the terrorists was the Army Public School situated some distance from the place where the terrorists had been engaged in a sustained firefight. Army men were worried about the possibility of the terrorists moving into the school and taking children and staff as hostage. For this reason, the operation to eliminate the terrorists was carried out with extreme caution and patience<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/battle-of-samba-how-army-subdued-fidayeens-113092700627_1.html|title=Battle of Samba: How army subdued fidayeens|last=IANS|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816185331/http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/battle-of-samba-how-army-subdued-fidayeens-113092700627_1.html|archivedate=16 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Counter insurgency operation in Myanmar 2015===\n{{Main|2015 Indian counter-insurgency operation in Myanmar}}\nBased on precise intelligence inputs, the Indian Air Force and 21 para (SF) carried a cross-border operation along the Indo-Myanmar border and destroyed two militant camps one each of the [[National Socialist Council of Nagaland]] (K) (NSCN) and the [[Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup]] (KYKL). The operations were carried out inside Myanmar territory along the [[Nagaland]] and [[Manipur]] border at two locations. One of the locations was near Ukhrul in Manipur. The army attacked two militants' transit camps.\n\n70 commandos were reportedly involved in the operation. The commandos, equipped with assault rifles, rocket launchers, grenades and night vision goggles, were divided into two groups after they fast roped from [[HAL Dhruv|Dhruv]] helicopters just inside the Indian territory near the border with Myanmar. The teams trekked through the thick jungles for at least {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=off}} before they reached training camps. Each of the teams was further divided into two sub-groups.

The regiment has tried raising new battalions to augment the strength of the special forces however the task has not been completed due to the tough selection phase. Furthermore, in the absence of a centralized command and lack of a centralized and standardized procedure for selection, even among the Para (SF) battalions, selection procedures vary. Meaning there is a different standard to get into different Para (SF) battalions.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, there were plans to take the three para commando battalions from the Parachute Regiment and bring them together under an individual specialized organisation, the Special Forces Regiment. However, after several logistic and administrative obstacles, these plans were abandoned, and they continue to be trained and recruited by the Parachute Regiment.\n\nPara (SF) operate in assault teams, which work individually behind enemy lines, whereas the Paratroopers (Airborne) work in large teams and coordinate with other units as their role involves occupying large areas behind enemy lines. The total strength of the regiment stands at about 10,000, this includes five airborne infantry battalions, one Rashtriya Rifles and two Territorial Army battalion personnel, while the Para (SF) includes between 5,000 and 6,000 personnel. They have to hide their identity from general public.\n\nThe [[Special Group (India)|Special Group]], a confidential special forces unit of the [[Research and Analysis Wing]], recruits soldiers from the Para SF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theweek.in/theweek/cover/covert-operations.html|title=Close encounters of the covert kind|date=October 9, 2016|website=[[The Week (Indian magazine)|The Week]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190821160929/https://www.theweek.in/theweek/cover/covert-operations.html|archive-date=21 August 2019|access-date=2019-10-05}}</ref>\n\n===Functions===\n* [[Intelligence (information gathering)|Intelligence collection]], [[special reconnaissance]]\n* Subversion and [[sabotage]] of vital enemy infrastructure and communications through deep penetration and surgical strikes behind enemy lines.\n* Covert and overt/direct action special operations as part of the Indian Army's counter-terrorist and counter-insurgency operations.\n* [[Hostage rescue]] operations within and beyond Indian territory.\n\nThe unit is tasked with missions such as special operations, direct action, hostage rescue, counter-terrorism, unconventional warfare, special reconnaissance, foreign internal defense, counter-proliferation, counter-insurgency, seek and destroy and personnel recovery.<ref name=\"KatochHistory\" />\n\n==Personnel==\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:1st SFG (A) Trains with Indian Special Forces.jpg|American [[Green Berets]] from 1st SFG (A) try the Para SF [[Tavor]]\nFile:Para commando weapon aim.jpg|A Para SF officer tries a U.S. [[M4 carbine]]\nFile:Green Berets assigned to 2nd Battalion, 1st Special Forces Group (Airborne), conducted training exercise with Indian Para Special Forces (3).jpg|[[Green Berets]] from [[1st Special Forces Group (United States)|1st SFG (A)]] conducting combat water survival training with Para SF\n</gallery>\n\n===Selection===\n\nAll Indian paratroopers are volunteers.

Both the selection procedures are one of the longest and toughest training regimens in the world,the applicant is exposed to sleep deprivation, humiliation, exhaustion, and mental and physical torture. Deaths have been reported during this selection process. The attrition rate is very high, and selection rarely exceeds 10 percent. Even though a candidate may have cleared selection, he is not formally inducted into the regiment until completion of the ''Balidan Padh'' where, after training, a candidate is involved in active operations in a hostile zone for a year. Provided the candidate survives the ''Balidan Padh'', he is given the ''Balidan Badge'' and formally inducted into the regiment.\n\nThe soldiers are selected accordingly.

The soldier applying for the Parachute Regiment must go through the necessary medical requirements.\n* Selection (encompassing a selection process and basic SF training) - the duration of this stage has changed over the years. For the Parachute het Regiment it was initially 28 days which became 45 days after 1999 and is now 90 days (3 months). The intensity also differs according to the prospective battalion. Para (SF) selection takes place twice a year. Probationers undergo extreme physical and mental tests. The drop out rate is high. Those who fail go back to their parent regiment. Those who complete the probation are inducted into the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]]. 10 Para (SF) selection: the probation for the 10 Para (SF) starts in the desert, with rigorous physical training being undertaken in desert climate. There is no training manual, so there is no specific routine. Probationers go without food for 4 days, they have to minimize water consumption up to 1 litre water for 3 days and be able to go without sleep for 7 days. A 10&nbsp;kg sandbag become a permanent buddy for the probationer. Routine speed marches and runs of 10&nbsp;km, 20&nbsp;km, 30&nbsp;km and 40&nbsp;km with full battle gears are conducted. Probationers must be exceptional navigators in areas where there is no network signal, no roads or landmarks and sand dunes that keep shifting every night.<ref name=\"mustaffa\" /> In Parachute training, candidates then complete a 3-week Basic Parachute Course at the Indian Army's Parachute Training School in Agra.\n* Advanced SF Training<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.in/Indias-Special-Forces-History-Future/dp/9382573976|title=India's Special Forces: 1: History and Future of Special Forces|last=Katoch|first=Gen P.

This is followed by immediate observational skills and operation tactics under pressure which included probationary having to recall objects placed in their exercises. This is followed by 10&nbsp;km speed march and 6 hours of continuous exercises. Finally practical combat skills tested such as placing ambushes, response to an ambush, making camps, stretchers and simulated evacs.

In the special forces, the members are imparted both basic and advance training. They are taught specialised modes of infiltration and exfiltration, either by air (combat freefall) or sea (combat diving). Some trainees return to PTS to undergo the free-fall course, which requires at least 50 jumps from altitudes up to {{convert|33,500|ft|m|abbr=off}} to pass. Both High Altitude Low Opening ([[HALO/HAHO|HALO]]) and High Altitude High Opening ([[HAHO]])techniques are learned. The ability to use the HAHO method and specially designed maneuverable [[parachute]]s called HAPPS (High Altitude Parachute Penetration System)/AMX-310 to conduct stealth insertions over distances up to {{convert|50|km|mi}} is also perfected.<ref name=\"BR para\" />\n\nFor combat diving training, the commandos are sent to the Naval Diving School, Kochi. Like other special forces, these para commandos are trained for land, air and water.\n\nThe daily routine begins with a {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} morning run. Infiltration, exfiltration, assault, room and building intervention, intelligence gathering, patrolling, ambush tactics, counter-ambush tactics, counter insurgency, counter-terrorism, unconventional warfare, guerilla warfare, asymmetric warfare, raids and sabotage, martial arts training, tactical shooting, stress firing, reflex shooting, buddy system drills, close quarter battle, tactical driving, advance weapon courses and handling, sniping, demolition training, survival skills, linguistic training, logistic training, trade-craft training is imparted by the intelligence agencies. The training drills involve live ammunition at all times which is a reason for fatal accidents at times leading to death.\n\nNight and weapons training and field craft involving {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} treks with {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} loads and live ammunition are conducted. Weekly forced marches with {{convert|65|kg|lb|abbr=on}} combat loads with distances over {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} and quarterly night drops with full combat loads are also conducted.\n\nIn addition to this in-house training, the commandos also attend a number of schools run by the Army that specialise in terrain and environmental warfare.<ref name=\"BR para\" /> These include the Junior Leaders' Commando Training Camp in [[Belgaum]], [[Karnataka]], the Parvat Ghatak School (for high altitude mountain warfare) in Tawang [[Arunachal Pradesh]], the desert warfare school in [[Rajasthan]], the [[High Altitude Warfare School]] (HAWS) in Sonamarg, [[Kashmir]], the [[Counterinsurgency and Jungle Warfare School]] (CIJWS) in Vairengte, Mizoram, and the [[Indian special forces training school]] in Nahan, Himachal Pradesh.

SOF members from the three nations routinely train at each other's facilities to improve military cooperation and tactical skills. This allows the SOF operators from each nation to see tactics and perspectives offered by other top-notch organizations.

The [[50th Indian Parachute Brigade]] was formed on 27 October 1941, comprising the British [[156th Parachute Battalion (United Kingdom)|151st Parachute Battalion]], the [[British Indian Army]] 152nd Indian Parachute Battalion, and the 153rd Gurkha Parachute Battalion.<ref name=\"Global Sec Para Rgt\">[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-para.htm Parachute Regiment, India] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222100338/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/rgt-para.htm |date=22 February 2014 }} on GlobalSecurity.org</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soc.mil/ARSOF_History/articles/v14n2_vajra_prahar_sb_parachute.html|title=Sidebar: Indian Army Parachute Regiment: A Brief History|last=|first=|date=2018|website=United States Army Special Operations Command|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> The Parachute Regiment was formed from these and several other units in 1952.\n\nIn 1944, the 50th was allocated to the newly founded [[44th Airborne Division (India)|44th Airborne Division]]. In the post-independence restructuring, India retained only one parachute brigade\u2014the 50th. This brigade consisted of three distinguished battalions personally nominated by the then Commander-in-Chief, namely 1 PARA (Punjab), 2 PARA (Maratha) and 3 PARA (Kumaon). During the [[Jammu and Kashmir]] operations of 1947-48 these battalions distinguished themselves with glory in the battles of Shelatang, [[Nowshera, Jammu and Kashmir|Naushera]], Jhangar and [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]], and were awarded the respective Battle Honours.\n\nOn 15 April 1952, the three battalions serving with the Parachute Brigade were removed from their respective Infantry Regiments to form the Parachute Regiment. Since then the Parachute Regiment has grown to comprise ten battalions including Parachute (Special Forces) battalions. In 1986, 8 PARA became 12 Battalion, Mechanised Infantry Regiment, while 21 Maratha LI converted to PARA (Special Forces). During their short but eventful existence so far, the regiment's battalions have had extensive operational experience, and singular achievements, to speak of their level of professionalism.\n\nDuring the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], an ''ad hoc'' commando unit, named Meghdoot Force, consisting of volunteers from various infantry units was organized by then Major Megh Singh of the [[Brigade of the Guards]]. The unit performed well in combat, and the Government authorized the formal raising of a commando unit. [[Megh Singh|Lt Col Megh Singh]] was selected to raise the unit which was originally intended to be a part of the Brigade of the Guards. However, recognizing parachute qualification as an integral element of special operations, the unit was transferred to the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]] and raised as its 9th Battalion (Commando) on 1 July 1966. The erstwhile members of the Meghdoot Force formed the nucleus, and the new unit was based in [[Gwalior]]. In June 1967 the unit was split equally into two to form a second commando unit, designated as 10th Battalion, each with three Companies.  10th Battalion was mandated to operate in the [[Thar Desert|Western Desert]] and 9th Battalion in the northern mountains. In 1969, these battalions were re-designated as 9 and 10 Para (Commando) battalions.<ref name=\"Global Sec Para Rgt\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 1978, the 1 Para, as an experiment, was converted to become the first special forces unit of the Indian army, and was kept as the tactical reserve. Already a recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice, and the [[General officer commanding|GOC-in-C]] Eastern Command Unit Citation once, the unit was originally 1 Punjab, which was later re-designated as 1 PARA (PUNJAB) and in 1978 was converted to 1 PARA (SF). The unit is well over 200 years old.\n\nOn 15 January 1992, the Parachute Regiment Training Centre along with the Records and PAO(OR), and the Para Regiment, moved to Bangalore and occupied the erstwhile location of Pioneer Corps and Training Centre.

After a stringent selection and training process that spanned more than a year, on 1 February 1996, the unit under Colonel VB Shinde, was formally inducted as the 21st Battalion (Special Forces), The Parachute Regiment. The unit has done well in its short lifespan and is the proud recipient of the Chief of Army Staff Unit Citation twice (1992 and 2006) and the GOC-in-C Eastern Command Unit Citation once (2008), as well as a host of individual gallantry awards. With the changing scenario in military operations and the need for more special forces units, 2 Para began the conversion process from parachute to special forces role, followed closely by the 3 Para and the 4 Para in the year 2004 and 2005. The attempt did see a some success, but the reason it failed to achieve its goal was due to the stringent selection process.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===1971 Indo-Pakistan War===\nThe unit first saw action in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|1971 Indo-Pakistani war]], the first six-man assault team was inserted {{convert|240|km|mi|abbr=off}} deep into Indus and Charchao, where they carried out raids. The assault team killed 73 and wounded 140 on the Pakistani side. In addition, they also destroyed 35mm artillery guns of the Pakistan independent battery. They also destroyed an airfield. In Bangladesh 2 PARA (Airborne), which was a part of 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade, carried out India's first airborne assault operation to capture Poongli Bridge in Mymensingh District near Dhaka. Subsequently, they were the first unit to enter Dhaka. For this action 2 PARA were given the Battle Honour of Poongli Bridge and the Theater Honour Dhaka.<ref name=popl>{{cite book|last=Rao|first=K.

During the operation, six artillery guns were destroyed by a raiding team composed of six officers and around 120 soldiers led by Major C. M. Malhotra. The special forces raiders began their operation at 5.30 PM on 13 December 1971. They started off from [[Poonch district, India|Poonch]] and crossed the [[Poonch River]]. After they reached the Mandole village, they started searching for the artillery guns and eventually located them. The raiders divided themselves into six teams. Each one of the six team was tasked to destroy one of the six guns. Subsequently, an intense [[gunfight]] took place between the Indian raiders and [[Pakistan Army]] soldiers. The gunfight resulted in two Indian casualties and many Pakistani casualties, with some Pakistani soldiers escaping from the battle. Finally, the raiders destroyed all the artillery using explosives and returned to their base at 6.30 AM on 14 December 1971.<ref name=mandhol>{{cite web |title=Operation 'Mandhol' forced Pakistan to change war plan |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Operation-Mandhol-forced-Pakistan-to-change-war-plan/articleshow/27444282.cms |website=[[The Times of India]] |accessdate=27 February 2020 |date=16 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis operation caused the Pakistan military to tweak its military doctrine by assigning additional soldiers for defending artillery guns. [[Pakistan Army]] officials, who came to India as a delegation after the war had ended, acknowledged the raid. Operation Mandhol is now a part of the syllabus at the [[Indian Military Academy]].<ref name=\"mandhol\" />\n\n==== Chachro Raid ====\nA series of raids were conducted by soldiers from the 10 Para (also known as ''The Desert Scorpions'') at [[Chachro]], Virawah, [[Nagarparkar]] and [[Islamkot]] during the [[1971 Indo-Pakistani war]]. The objective of these raids were to hit [[Pakistan military]] installations located 80 kilometres inside hostile territory, disrupting supply lines, creating confusion and undertake important inroads into hostile territory. Two teams, codenamed Alpha and Charlie, trained for a duration of five months in skills such as [[desert warfare]].<ref name=\"chachro raid\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.news18.com/news/india/the-chachro-raid-of-1971-indias-most-daring-surgical-strike-in-pakistan-1336153.html|title=The Chachro Raid of 1971 \u2013 India's Most Daring Surgical Strike in Pak|last=|first=|date=January 15, 2017|website=[[CNN-News18]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref>\n\nDuring the raids, the Indian commandos inserted themselves 80 kilometres deep into Pakistani territory and traversed a distance of over 500 kilometres, attacking [[Pakistan military]] installations and positions. They completed the raids with zero Indian casualties.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nThe raids began on 5 December 1971, when commandos from the 10 Para penetrated 70 kilometres inside hostile territory. The soldiers went into a defensive posture as they encountered heavy firing from Pakistani posts. The Indian raiders sent one of their vehicles rushing towards Pakistani positions, firing a [[Light machine gun|LMG]], to distract gunfire. This tactic was successful because of the cover provided by nighttime. Subsequently, the other raiders too opened fire and overpowered the Pakistani posts.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nSoon, a [[Pathfinder (military)|pathfinder]] team was assigned the task of charting a route for the Alpha team to attack the wing headquarters of the [[Pakistan Rangers]] in [[Chachro]]. The pathfinders used the cover of darkness to chart a suitable route and green-lighted the raid before the dawn of December 7. Within a few hours, the team killed 17 Pakistani soldiers, took 12 prisoners and captured [[Chachro]]. After this raid, the Charlie team exfiltrated out of the battlefield. [[Chachro]] was subsequently handed over to Indian [[Infantry|infantrymen]] and the Alpha team proceeded further.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nThe Alpha team moved towards their next targets: Virawah and [[Nagarparkar]]. They reached Virawah before the dawn of December 8, moving in broad daylight the preceding day. The first contact made by the raiders with the Pakistani soldiers was at 1:30 AM. [[Hand-to-hand combat]] between the Indian raiders and the Pakistanis ensued, followed by [[Shootout|gunfights]]. Soon, Virawah was captured by the Indian raiders. The raiders then proceeded to [[Nagarparkar]] and captured it by the morning of December 8.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\nFollowing this, the Indian raiders had returned to their base in India but were again tasked to attack ammunition dump in [[Islamkot]]. The raiders reached their target at 5:30 AM on December 17 but found the target empty. Subsequently, while retreating, the raiders ambushed a Pakistani convoy, killing 18-20 Pakistani troops and imprisoning survivors.<ref name=\"chachro raid\" />\n\n===Operation Bluestar 1984===\nIn 1984 the Para (SF) were involved in [[Operation Blue Star]]. They were charged to lead an attack on the Holy Site of the Sikh religion the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] to evict Sikh militants in [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]. 80 members of 1 Para (SF) were given the task of assaulting two areas of the temple, one of which required divers. However, there were a number of setbacks as a result of inaccurate intelligence on the strength of the militants who were trained by Gen. [[Shabeg Singh]] (ex- 1 Para himself), operating in low light, the conventional manner of the raid, and the lack of incentive, all of which resulted in a mission failure. The diver mission was aborted after the first team got bogged down. The commandos accompanied by Raghunath dubey achieved their aims after a gunfight with militants that lasted hours.<ref name=\"Katoch\">{{cite web |title=Interview Lt Gen P.C.

However, the lack of proper planning by the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF), and insufficient intelligence on the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]]'s (LTTE) whereabouts, caused [[Jaffna University Helidrop|the initial heli-borne assault]] on Jaffna University on 11 October 1987 to be a tragic failure. However it was because of the efforts of the Para (SF) that later led to the capture of the Jaffna peninsula, forcing the LTTE militants to take refuge in the forests.\n\nSix soldiers lost their lives in that mission. Due to their superior training, the Para (SF) took refuge under a house, after they were misled by a youth who offered his services to help the commandos track [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] but instead took them on a wild goose chase. They engaged the enemy for 24 hours and picked up all their dead with their weapons after reinforcements arrived the next morning.\n\nAfter the failed assault on Jaffna City, the 10 Para (SF) participated in a heli-borne assault on the town of Moolai {{convert|23|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the north west in November 1987. More than 200 LTTE guerrillas were killed and an arms depot seized. In order to give the commandos battle experience, 1 Para (SF) was rotated home in early 1988 and replaced by 9 Para (SF).\n\nThis battalion was scheduled to return home in June 1988, but the tour of duty was extended due to a planned air assault into the coastal swamps around [[Mullaitivu District|Mullaittivu]]. The mission was a success, in that it located several arms caches. The 9 Para (SF) also provided 12 men for the security of the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka.\n\n===Operation Cactus 1988, Maldives===\n{{Main|Operation Cactus}}\nWith the capture of [[Maldives]], an island nation off the south western coast of India, on 3 November 1988 by the [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam]] (PLOTE) [[mercenaries]], the army turned to the 50 (Independent) Parachute Brigade to carry out an airborne/air transported operation to liberate the country and return power to the legal government. This operation had 6 PARA spearheading the mission. 6 Para flew in on 4 November 1988 in a fleet of [[IL-76]], [[An-32]] and [[An-12]] transport aircraft. One team rescued the president, another took over the airfield, and a third rescued Maldivian security personnel besieged in the [[National Security Service (Maldives)|National Security Service]] HQ. Later 7 Para and part of 17 Para Field Regiment were also deployed to the Maldives. When mercenaries tried to escape by sea along with hostages, they were intercepted by the [[Indian navy]]. Thus, 6 Para, and the 17 Para Field Regiment conducted the first-ever international intervention by the [[Indian army]] without any loss of life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/operation-cactus-how-indian-troops-went-to-maldives-and-helped-quell-a-coup/articleshow/62816787.cms|title=Operation Cactus: How Indian troops went to Maldives and helped quell a coup|last=|first=|last2=|date=7 February 2018|website=[[The Times of India]]|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-09-17|last3=|first3=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thequint.com/news/india/operation-cactus-maldives-crisis-should-india-intervene-again|title=Operation Cactus: The Day India Saved the Maldives|date=2018-02-06|website=The Quint|language=en|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref>\n\n===1999 Kargil War===\n{{Main|Kargil War}}\nIn 1999 nine out of ten Parachute battalions were deployed for Operation Vijay in Kargil, which bears testimony to the operational profile of the Regiment.

About 90 operators commanded by Major (now Lt. Col.) Harinder Sood were airlifted from New Delhi to spearhead the mission to rescue 223 men of the 5/8 Gurkha Rifles who were surrounded and held captive by [[Revolutionary United Front]] (RUF) rebels for over 75 days just 90 Para (SF) forced 2000-5000 members of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) divided into 5 battalions to surrender. This ultimately led to the liberation of Freetown.\n\n===Operation Summer Storm 2009===\nOn 11 April 2009, the 57 Mountain Division of the Indian Army based in Manipur, Para Commandos along with the para-military Assam Rifles and State Police, launched a counter insurgency operation, code-named \"Operation Summer Storm\" in the Loktak Lake region and adjoining [[Loktak Lake]] in Bishnupur District, located south of State capital of Imphal. The first major mobilization of troops in 2009 ended on 21 April. As the troops began pulling out, an Army spokesperson described the operation as a success, disclosing that 129 militants, all belonging to the [[People's Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak]] (PREPAK) were killed. The Forces also claimed to have located and destroyed five militant camps during the Operation and more than 117 weapons, including sixty nine AK-series rifles, forty-eight rocket launchers, and an unspecified quantity of explosives and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). No militant was arrested.

The terrorists sneaked across the border early on Thursday, barely three days ahead of a meeting between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan. The attack was on a police station. The 16 Cavalry unit of the Army in Samba district falls under the jurisdiction of 9 corps, headquartered at Yol Cantonment in Himachal Pradesh. The three heavily armed terrorists, believed to be from the group [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]] (LeT), were holed up in the cavalry armored unit's camp at Samba for several hours after they barged into the Officers mess, until they were killed during a fierce gunfight with 1 Para (SF) of the army.

The Para (SF) commandos first carried out an aerial reconnaissance of the camp before landing to neutralize the three terrorists. The 1 Para (SF) had identified the exact spot during the aerial reconnaissance from where the intruders were returning the army fire. After landing, the commandos started engaging the terrorists in a direct gunfight, but in order to give them an impression that their exact hiding location had still not been identified, an abandoned building inside the camp was blasted. This made the terrorists complacent thinking that their hiding spot had not been yet been pin-pointed. They kept on intermittently returning army fire until all three of them were eliminated. The entire operation, from the moment the terrorists entered the camp until they were gunned down, took nearly nine hours to complete. The main worry of the soldiers tasked to eliminate the terrorists was the Army Public School situated some distance from the place where the terrorists had been engaged in a sustained firefight. Army men were worried about the possibility of the terrorists moving into the school and taking children and staff as hostage. For this reason, the operation to eliminate the terrorists was carried out with extreme caution and patience<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/battle-of-samba-how-army-subdued-fidayeens-113092700627_1.html|title=Battle of Samba: How army subdued fidayeens|last=IANS|accessdate=19 July 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816185331/http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/battle-of-samba-how-army-subdued-fidayeens-113092700627_1.html|archivedate=16 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Counter insurgency operation in Myanmar 2015===\n{{Main|2015 Indian counter-insurgency operation in Myanmar}}\nBased on precise intelligence inputs, the Indian Air Force and 21 para (SF) carried a cross-border operation along the Indo-Myanmar border and destroyed two militant camps one each of the [[National Socialist Council of Nagaland]] (K) (NSCN) and the [[Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup]] (KYKL). The operations were carried out inside Myanmar territory along the [[Nagaland]] and [[Manipur]] border at two locations. One of the locations was near Ukhrul in Manipur. The army attacked two militants' transit camps.\n\n70 commandos were reportedly involved in the operation. The commandos, equipped with assault rifles, rocket launchers, grenades and night vision goggles, were divided into two groups after they fast roped from [[HAL Dhruv|Dhruv]] helicopters just inside the Indian territory near the border with Myanmar. The teams trekked through the thick jungles for at least {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=off}} before they reached training camps. Each of the teams was further divided into two sub-groups.

The regiment has tried raising new battalions to augment the strength of the special forces however the task has not been completed due to the tough selection phase. Furthermore, in the absence of a centralized command and lack of a centralized and standardized procedure for selection, even among the Para (SF) battalions, selection procedures vary. Meaning there is a different standard to get into different Para (SF) battalions.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, there were plans to take the three para commando battalions from the Parachute Regiment and bring them together under an individual specialized organisation, the Special Forces Regiment. However, after several logistic and administrative obstacles, these plans were abandoned, and they continue to be trained and recruited by the Parachute Regiment.\n\nPara (SF) operate in assault teams, which work individually behind enemy lines, whereas the Paratroopers (Airborne) work in large teams and coordinate with other units as their role involves occupying large areas behind enemy lines. The total strength of the regiment stands at about 10,000, this includes five airborne infantry battalions, one Rashtriya Rifles and two Territorial Army battalion personnel, while the Para (SF) includes between 5,000 and 6,000 personnel. They have to hide their identity from general public.\n\nThe [[Special Group (India)|Special Group]], a confidential special forces unit of the [[Research and Analysis Wing]], recruits soldiers from the Para SF.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theweek.in/theweek/cover/covert-operations.html|title=Close encounters of the covert kind|date=October 9, 2016|website=[[The Week (Indian magazine)|The Week]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190821160929/https://www.theweek.in/theweek/cover/covert-operations.html|archive-date=21 August 2019|access-date=2019-10-05}}</ref>\n\n===Functions===\n* [[Intelligence (information gathering)|Intelligence collection]], [[special reconnaissance]]\n* Subversion and [[sabotage]] of vital enemy infrastructure and communications through deep penetration and surgical strikes behind enemy lines.\n* Covert and overt/direct action special operations as part of the Indian Army's counter-terrorist and counter-insurgency operations.\n* [[Hostage rescue]] operations within and beyond Indian territory.\n\nThe unit is tasked with missions such as special operations, direct action, hostage rescue, counter-terrorism, unconventional warfare, special reconnaissance, foreign internal defense, counter-proliferation, counter-insurgency, seek and destroy and personnel recovery.<ref name=\"KatochHistory\" />\n\n==Personnel==\n<gallery class=\"center\" mode=\"packed\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:1st SFG (A) Trains with Indian Special Forces.jpg|American [[Green Berets]] from 1st SFG (A) try the Para SF [[Tavor]]\nFile:Para commando weapon aim.jpg|A Para SF officer tries a U.S. [[M4 carbine]]\nFile:Green Berets assigned to 2nd Battalion, 1st Special Forces Group (Airborne), conducted training exercise with Indian Para Special Forces (3).jpg|[[Green Berets]] from [[1st Special Forces Group (United States)|1st SFG (A)]] conducting combat water survival training with Para SF\n</gallery>\n\n===Selection===\n\nAll Indian paratroopers are volunteers.

For the Para (Air) it was initially 28 days which became 45 days after 1999 and is now 90 days (approximately 3 months). The Para (SF) was 90 days long and hasn't been changed since. The intensity also differs according to the prospective battalion. Para (SF) selection takes place twice a year. Probationers undergo extreme physical and mental tests. The drop out rate is high. Those who fail go back to their parent regiment. Those who complete the probation are inducted into the [[Parachute Regiment (India)|Parachute Regiment]]. 10 Para (SF) selection: the probation for the 10 Para (SF) starts in the desert, with rigorous physical training being undertaken in desert climate. There is no training manual, so there is no specific routine. Probationers go without food for 4 days, they have to minimize water consumption up to 1 litre water for 3 days and be able to go without sleep for 7 days. A 10&nbsp;kg sandbag become a permanent buddy for the probationer. Routine speed marches and runs of 10&nbsp;km, 20&nbsp;km, 30&nbsp;km and 40&nbsp;km with full battle gears are conducted. Probationers must be exceptional navigators in areas where there is no network signal, no roads or landmarks and sand dunes that keep shifting every night.<ref name=\"mustaffa\" /> In Parachute training, candidates then complete a 3-week Basic Parachute Course at the Indian Army's Parachute Training School in Agra.\n* Advanced SF Training<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.in/Indias-Special-Forces-History-Future/dp/9382573976|title=India's Special Forces: 1: History and Future of Special Forces|last=Katoch|first=Gen P.

This is followed by immediate observational skills and operation tactics under pressure which included probationary having to recall objects placed in their exercises. This is followed by 10&nbsp;km speed march and 6 hours of continuous exercises. Finally practical combat skills tested such as placing ambushes, response to an ambush, making camps, stretchers and simulated evacs.

In the special forces, the members are imparted both basic and advance training. They are taught specialised modes of infiltration and exfiltration, either by air (combat freefall) or sea (combat diving). Some trainees return to PTS to undergo the free-fall course, which requires at least 50 jumps from altitudes up to {{convert|33,500|ft|m|abbr=off}} to pass. Both High Altitude Low Opening ([[HALO/HAHO|HALO]]) and High Altitude High Opening ([[HAHO]])techniques are learned. The ability to use the HAHO method and specially designed maneuverable [[parachute]]s called HAPPS (High Altitude Parachute Penetration System)/AMX-310 to conduct stealth insertions over distances up to {{convert|50|km|mi}} is also perfected.<ref name=\"BR para\" />\n\nFor combat diving training, the commandos are sent to the Naval Diving School, Kochi. Like other special forces, these para commandos are trained for land, air and water.\n\nThe daily routine begins with a {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} morning run. Infiltration, exfiltration, assault, room and building intervention, intelligence gathering, patrolling, ambush tactics, counter-ambush tactics, counter insurgency, counter-terrorism, unconventional warfare, guerilla warfare, asymmetric warfare, raids and sabotage, martial arts training, tactical shooting, stress firing, reflex shooting, buddy system drills, close quarter battle, tactical driving, advance weapon courses and handling, sniping, demolition training, survival skills, linguistic training, logistic training, trade-craft training is imparted by the intelligence agencies. The training drills involve live ammunition at all times which is a reason for fatal accidents at times leading to death.\n\nNight and weapons training and field craft involving {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} treks with {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} loads and live ammunition are conducted. Weekly forced marches with {{convert|65|kg|lb|abbr=on}} combat loads with distances over {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} and quarterly night drops with full combat loads are also conducted.\n\nIn addition to this in-house training, the commandos also attend a number of schools run by the Army that specialise in terrain and environmental warfare.<ref name=\"BR para\" /> These include the Junior Leaders' Commando Training Camp in [[Belgaum]], [[Karnataka]], the Parvat Ghatak School (for high altitude mountain warfare) in Tawang [[Arunachal Pradesh]], the desert warfare school in [[Rajasthan]], the [[High Altitude Warfare School]] (HAWS) in Sonamarg, [[Kashmir]], the [[Counterinsurgency and Jungle Warfare School]] (CIJWS) in Vairengte, Mizoram, and the [[Indian special forces training school]] in Nahan, Himachal Pradesh.

SOF members from the three nations routinely train at each other's facilities to improve military cooperation and tactical skills. This allows the SOF operators from each nation to see tactics and perspectives offered by other top-notch organizations.
