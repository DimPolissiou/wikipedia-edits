It was officially standardized as the '''Tank, Combat, Full Tracked: 105-mm Gun, M60''' in March 1959.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page=165}} Although developed from the [[M48 Patton]], the M60 series was never ''officially'' classified as a member of the Patton tank family, but as a \"product-improved descendant\" of the Patton tank's design.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 6, 408 }} The United States fully committed to the [[Main Battle Tank]] doctrine in 1963 when the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] retired the last ([[M103 (heavy tank)|M103]]) heavy tank battalion. The M60 tank series became America's primary main battle tank during the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 181 }} Over 15,000 M60s were built by Chrysler. Hull production ended in 1983, but 5,400 older models were converted to the M60A3 variant ending in 1990.<ref name=\"fas.org\" />\n\nIt reached operational capability with fielding to US Army units in Europe beginning in December 1960.<ref name=\"historyofwar.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_m60patton.html|title=M60 Patton Main Battle Tank (USA)|website=www.historyofwar.org}}</ref> The first combat usage of the M60 was with Israel during the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]] where it saw service under the \"Magach 6\" designation, performing well in combat against comparable tanks such as the [[T-62]]. In 1982 the Israelis once again used the M60 during the [[1982 Lebanon War]], equipped with upgrades such as [[explosive reactive armor]] to defend against guided missiles that proved very effective at destroying tanks. The M60 also saw use in 1983 with [[United States invasion of Grenada|Operation Urgent Fury]], supporting US Marines in an amphibious assault into Grenada. M60s delivered to Iran also served in the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. The United States' largest deployment of M60s was in the 1991 [[Gulf War]], where the US Marines equipped with M60A1s effectively defeated Iraqi armored forces, including [[T-72|T-72M]] tanks. The United States readily retired the M60 after Operation Desert Storm, with the last units being retired from active service in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=28|title=M60 (Patton) Main Battle Tank (MBT) - United States|website=www.militaryfactory.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-07}}</ref> M60-series vehicles continue in front-line service with a number of countries' militaries, though most of these have been highly modified and had their firepower, mobility and protection upgraded to increase their combat effectiveness on the modern battlefield.\n\nThe M60 underwent many updates over its service life. The interior layout, based on the design of the M48, provided ample room for updates and improvements, extending the vehicle's service life for over four decades. It was widely used by the US and its Cold War allies, especially those in [[NATO]], and remains in service throughout the world today, despite having been superseded by the [[M1 Abrams]] in the US military. The tank's hull also developed a wide variety of prototypical, utility and support vehicles such as armored recovery vehicles, bridge layers and combat engineering vehicles. As of 2015 [[Egypt]] is the largest operator with 1,716 upgraded M60A3s, [[Turkey]] is second with 866 upgraded units in service, and [[Saudi Arabia]] is third with over 650 units.\n\n==Development==\n===Impetus===\nThe United States entered a period of frenzied activity during the crisis atmosphere of the [[Korean War]], when America seemed to lag behind the Soviet Union in terms of tank quality and quantity.<ref name=\"benning.army.mil\">https://www.benning.army.mil/Armor/Historian/content/PDF/Armor%20Dev%20Cold%20War.pdf</ref> Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure speedy delivery of new tanks. Such rapid production caused problems but the importance given to rapidly equipping combat units with new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to quantity production.<ref name=\"benning.army.mil\"/>\n\nThe [[M47 Patton]] entered production in 1951 and was used by the United States Army and Marine Corps but ongoing technical and production problems kept it from serving in the Korean War. The [[M48 Patton]] tank entered US service in 1952 but its early designs were deemed unsatisfactory by Army Field Forces (AFF). The improvements to the M48 focused on improving the 90mm main gun and fire control systems while simultaneously exploring the development of silicas glass composite armor and autoloader systems. The tank continued further development through 1955 in conjunction with its simultaneous mass production. The course of its development during the mid 1950s was the source of widespread debate among Congressional Budget Oversight committees.\n\nThe [[T95 Medium Tank|T95 program]], which began in 1955 was intended to supersede the M48. It featured a host of innovative and experimental components such as its 90&nbsp;mm smoothbore T208 cannon rigidly affixed to its turret, experimental X-shaped engine design, composite armor and infrared rangefinder. The burden of developing them, however, slowed the overall program to a crawl. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, a Soviet [[T-54/T-55|T-54A]] medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the UK's embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/the-beast-of-budapest.htm |title=The Beast of Budapest |website=HistoryNet.com |date=19 July 2018 |access-date=1 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921230135/http://www.historynet.com/the-beast-of-budapest.htm |archive-date=21 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> After a brief examination of this tank's armor by a British military attach\u00e9 it was concluded that the [[Ordnance QF 20-pounder|20-pounder (84mm L/66.7)]] was apparently incapable of defeating its frontal armor with HEAT or APC ammunition. Its 100mm main gun was a significant advancement over the weapon of the [[T-44]]. Also there were rumors of an even larger 115mm gun in the works. These events spurred the [[United Kingdom]] to develop a new tank gun in 1956, the [[Royal Ordnance L7]] to keep the [[Centurion (tank)|Centurion]] viable against this new Soviet tank design and the [[United States]] to develop the XM60 tank in 1957.<ref name=Halberstadt>{{Cite book |last=Halberstadt |first=Hans |title=Inside the Great Tanks |publisher=The Crowood Press |location=Wiltshire, England |year=1997 |pages=94\u201396 |isbn=1-86126-270-1 |oclc=40989477 |quote=The T-54/T-55 series is the hands down, all time most popular tank in history.}}</ref> This new tank design incorporated many Army Combat Vehicle (ARCOVE) committee improvements to the M48, chiefly the use of diesel engines to increase its operational range and the use of a more powerful main gun.\n\n===Choice of components===\n\n====M68 105 mm Main Gun====\nThe main gun was chosen after a comparative firing test of six different guns carried out on the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in 1958. The factors evaluated were accuracy, lethality of a hit, rate of fire and penetration performance.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 453\u2013454 }}\n\nAn M48A2C was fit with the 90&nbsp;mm M41 and tested with the new T300E53 HEAT round. A smoothbore version of the 90&nbsp;mm, the T208E9, was mounted on the T95E1 tank and tested the T320E62 APDS round. An American version of the British L7 105&nbsp;mm gun, under the name [[Royal Ordnance L7#United States|105&nbsp;mm T254E1]], was mounted on the T95E2 and tested with British APDS ammunition. Finally, two versions of the 120&nbsp;mm gun from the M103 were trialed, the existing M58 model and a lightened variant known as T123E6 which was mounted on the T95E4.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 155 }}\n\nThe T123E6 was preferred by the Ordnance Department because its ammunition, the same as that for the M58 gun, was already at an advanced state of development.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page=153 }} The ammunition was in two parts, shell and propellant bag, which required significant time to load. In the M103 this was addressed by adding a second loader, but a medium tank would not have the internal space needed for another crewmember and the firing rate would suffer as a result. In testing it demonstrated a maximum rate  of 4 rounds per minute vs. the T254's 7 rpm.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 453\u2013454 }}\n\nBased on these tests, the 105&nbsp;mm T254E1 was selected, modified to the T254E2 and standardized as the [[Royal Ordnance L7|Cannon, 105mm Gun, M68]]. It used a vertical sliding breechblock instead of the T254E1's horizontal breechblock. Until American-made barrels could be obtained with comparable accuracy, British X15/L52 barrels were to be used.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 155 }} US built XM24/L52 barrels (length 218.5 inches)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.williammaloney.com/Aviation/WatervlietArsenalMuseum/TankCannon/pages/09M68_105mmGun.htm|title=09 M68 105mm Gun|website=www.williammaloney.com|access-date=2019-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180121075334/http://www.williammaloney.com/Aviation/WatervlietArsenalMuseum/TankCannon/pages/09M68_105mmGun.htm|archive-date=2018-01-21|url-status=live}}</ref> fitted with an eccentric bore evacuator were used for the M60-series starting in June 1959 but retained interchangeability with the British X15/L52 barrel.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 152 }} All of the US guns and XM24 barrels were produced at the [[Watervliet Arsenal]], NY and the gun mounts (M116 for the M60 and M140 for the M60A1/A3) manufactured at the [[Rock Island Arsenal]], IL.<ref>https://www.gao.gov/assets/190/188401.pdf</ref> US M68 guns were fitted with an eccentric bore evacuator instead of a concentric model in order to provide more clearance over the rear deck.<ref name=\"Organizational Maintenance Manual--Tank 2306\">TM 9-2350-253-20-2 Organizational Maintenance Manual--Tank, Combat, Full Tracked: 105-mm Gun, M60A3 (2350-00-148-6548) and (2350-01-061-2306) TTS Turret.

The M60 hull had a straight slope and beak compared to the earlier M48's rounded one. The hull bottom had a strong boat-like appearance with a pronounced recess between the upper tracks and external suspension arms and one shock absorber on the first roadwheel pair. The armor was improved, at 6 inches (155&nbsp;mm) on the front glacis and mantle of solid rolled homogeneous armor, while it was 4.3 inches (110&nbsp;mm) on the M48.

The T95E5 turret used on the M60 was hemispherically shaped and bore a strong resemblance to the M48 Patton. The M60A1 was the first version to employ the newly designed T95E7 turret with a redesigned bustle increasing the number of rounds for the main gun to 63. The M60A2 featured a specially designed turret for the M162 gun/missile launcher that greatly reduced the frontal arc in comparison to the M60A1's T95E7 turret.  The M60A3's turret was similar to the A1's but with increased armor protection for the frontal arc and mantlet in an effort to provide additional protection of the turret's hydraulics system.\n\n====M19 Commander's Cupola====\nA redesigned full vision cupola was envisioned for the commander's station. It had 7 tiltable vision blocks arranged to give the commander a 360 degree field of view with overlapping vision between adjacent vision blocks. The front vision block could be replaced with a dual power M34 7x50 binocular day sight or an M19E1 IR periscope. A special feature was that the cupola body could be raised up to 3 1/2 inches providing the commander a direct field of vision while remaining under armor protection. Access was through a hatch cover on the roof and a .50 caliber M2HB machine gun was pedestal mounted on the forward part of the cupola. It could be aimed and fired with the cupola closed. Also there was an 11 inch long hydraulically operated port on the left side allowing spent cartridge cases to be ejected.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 156 }} After creating a full-sized mock up of this design using the [[T95 Medium Tank#Versions and modifications|T95E6 turret]], it was dropped in favor of a design based on the M1 cupola of the M48A2's turret. This T9 cupola provided the commander with more headroom than the T6 cupola of the T95 tank, carrying a new [[Receiver (firearms)|short receiver]] M85/T175 .50 caliber machine gun{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 156 }} and it was standardized as the Cupola, Tank Commander's Caliber .50 Machine Gun,<ref name=\"Direct Support 1975\" /> M19. The first M19 cupola (a modified T9) was ready on 27 October 1958. It has an M28C sight for the machine gun in the forward part of the cupola and eight vision blocks. The front vision block can be replaced by a M19E1 infrared periscope or an M36E1 passive periscope for night observation.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_m60patton.html |title = M60 Patton Main Battle Tank (USA)}}</ref> Initial production of the cupola was problematic. The first 300 M60s produced were armed with a .50cal M2HB machine gun in a pedestal mount welded to the left side of the commander's cupola owing to production problems with the new M85 machine gun. Of these tanks, the first 45 manufactured were made without the cupola itself, also due to production problems.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Crismon, Fred W. U.S. Military Tracked Vehicles.

Removing the cupola lowered the vehicle's relatively high silhouette. The cupola's hatch also opened toward the rear of the vehicle and was dangerous to close if under small-arms fire owing to a lock-open mechanism that required the user to apply leverage to unlock it prior to closing. The commander was able to observe the battlefield using the binocular M34 vision block or M19E1 IR Periscope while remaining under armor protection with a 360 degree traverse independent of the turret,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60a3.htm |title=M60A3 Patton |website=onwar.com |access-date=2019-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914203428/https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60a3.htm |archive-date=2018-09-14 |url-status=live }}</ref> was stabilized in azimuth and elevation<ref name=\"50megs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m60.html|title=105mm Gun Tank M60|website=afvdb.50megs.com|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528154422/http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m60.html|archive-date=2019-05-28|url-status=live}}</ref> and carried 600 rounds of ammunition.<ref name=\"onwar.com1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60.htm |title=M60 Patton |website=onwar.com |access-date=2019-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426112135/https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60.htm |archive-date=2019-04-26 |url-status=live }}</ref> All M60s in US service retained the M19 cupola until the tank was phased out of service.

Some M48A5s were retrofitted with the M19 cupola to maintain training levels of National Guard units.\n\n====Main Battle Tank Designation====\nThe concept of the [[medium tank]] gradually evolved into the [[Main Battle Tank]] (MBT) in the 1960s. The MBT was to combine the firepower and protection sufficient for the assault role with the mobility to perform as a medium tank.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 149 }} The main battle tank thus took on the role the British had once called the \"universal tank\", exemplified by the [[Centurion (tank)|British Centurion]], filling almost all battlefield roles. Typical main battle tanks were as well armed as any other vehicle on the battlefield, highly mobile, and well armored. Yet they were cheap enough to be built in large numbers. The first generation consists of the medium tanks designed and produced directly after World War II that were later redefined as main battle tanks. These were exemplified by the [[M47 Patton|M47]] and [[M48 Patton]]s armed with  a 90mm main gun already in widespread US service. The original variant of the M60 series also fulfilled the definition of a late first generation MBT sometimes being referred to as an intermediate second generation design. The Soviet [[T-54/T-55|T-54 and T-55]] as well as the original configuration of the [[T-62|T-62A]] tank designs are also regarded as first generation MBTs. The second generation had enhanced night-fighting capabilities and in most cases NBC protection. Most western tanks of this generation were armed with the 105&nbsp;mm Royal Ordnance L7 tank gun or derivatives of it. Notable are the [[Chieftain (tank)|British Chieftain]] and [[Leopard 1|German Leopard 1]]. The United States fully committed to the main battle tank doctrine in 1963 when the Marine Corps deactivated its last [[M103 (heavy tank)|M103 Heavy Tank]] battalion.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1988|page= 327 }} The first American nomenclature-designated second generation MBT was the M60A1 version of the M60 series. The term MBT is used in strategic doctrine and the composition of force as determined by the United States Army. The M60 series tanks fulfilled the MBT role on a strategic and tactical level. It was never referred to as such in any official training or technical manuals. The first Soviet second generation main battle tank designs were the [[T-64]] and [[T-72]].<ref>\u0422\u0430\u043d\u043a \u0422-62. \u0420\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u044d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u043b\u0443\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438. 1968</ref>\n\n===Production Versions===\n\n===XM60 Development===\nBy May 1957 it became clear that the [[T95 Medium Tank]] would not have a significant advantage over the [[M48A2]]. The X-shaped motor and electro-optical rangefinder were both discarded due to performance, and the accuracy of the smoothbore gun continued to be unsatisfactory. All this led to the closure of the T95 project on July 7, 1960. At the same time, work on the T95E7 turret was continued, which led to the creation of the fairly successful M60A1 turret.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 149 }} The course of the M48 Patton's tank production was the source of widespread Congressional debate. The [[Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]] believed that the Army was not progressing with sufficient speed in its tank modernization program and recommended the immediate replacement of the M48A2. Correctly predicting that Congress would not approve the procurement of the M48A2 after the fiscal year 1959, the Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics (DCSLOG) proposed a tank based on the M48A2 featuring improved firepower and the AVDS-1790 engine. Since the main gun had not yet been specified, four XM60 weapons systems were submitted in September 1957.\n\n[[File:XM60 120 big.png|thumb|left|Concept design #1 of the XM60 mounting the T123E6 main gun and British styled gun barrel, the newly designed full-vision cupola using the T95E6 turret as preferred by the Ordnance Department.]] \nThe first concept was armed with the 120mm gun T123E6 in the long nosed T95E6 turret. This was the design preferred by the Ordnance Department. It was fitted with a newly designed full-vision commander's cupola. A full sized mock-up of this turret was constructed before this concept was dropped, mainly due to its slow rate of fire. The second carried the 105mm rifled T254E2 main gun in the T95E5 type turret and the T9 cupola style of the M48A2. The T254 guns used British X15/L52 barrels with a concentric bore evacuator on the barrel.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 62 }} The Army Ordnance Technical Committee chose this design for production in August 1958. The third concept was to mount the 90mm T208 smooth-bore main gun and the T95E6 turret. It never progressed beyond design drawings. The fourth used the T95E1 turret and the T208 main gun. A mock-up was built using the new vision cupola. All of these conceptual designs were referred to as the XM60. A contract was awarded to Chrysler Engineering in September 1958 for the advanced production engineering (APE) of the XM60 concept #2.{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 47 }} The T95 hull was considered however its one-piece front casting was too difficult and expensive to produce in quantity. Some existing T95 hulls were re-fitted with the AVDS-1790 engine and used from 1960 to 1964 to develop the T118E1 prototyping of the [[M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle]].<ref>Tank Data, vol. 3. Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD: US Army Ordnance School, Jul 1968.</ref> Instead the decision was made to use modified M48A2 hulls. The hulls had 3 return rollers and 6 steel roadwheel pairs per side with no shock absorbers, using only bumper springs on the first and sixth roadwheel arms, along with a widened turret well and ring, and a flat wedge-shaped glacis. The T254E2 gun was chosen to be the main weapon of the tank in August 1958 being standardized as the M68 105mm gun. After a briefing on 11 December 1958, [[Maxwell D. Taylor|General Maxwell Taylor]] ordered the XM60 into production because of the improvements it offered in firepower, protection, and cruising range.{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 47 }}  Since the tank had not yet received its official designation these prototype hulls were briefly referred to as the M68 in December 1958 until they were officially named the M60 in March 1959.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com3\" /> Fulfilling this requirement was an interim tank design that resulted in the M60-series,{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 152 }} which largely resembles the M48 it was based on, but has significant differences.\n\n===M60===\n[[File:M60 Pilot 1.jpg|thumb|M60 production pilot number 1 after completion by Chrysler on 2 July 1959.

Production pilot 2 was finished on 4 August and used to develop technical publications and an additional 47 tanks produced to complete the first low rate production buy. In August 1959, an engineering bid package was awarded for the second low rate production buy of M60s to be built at the Delaware Plant. Production pilot 3 was completed 2 September and went to the Detroit Arsenal Test Center for maintenance evaluations, it was then sent to Fort Knox for user trials. The fourth pilot was completed on 26 October  and was used as the master hull to verify production standards at the Detroit Tank Plant with a low-rate initial production total of 180 M60s built in 1959.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\"/> Subsequent production, starting with the October 1960 batch were built at the [[Detroit Arsenal (Warren, Michigan)|Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant]], in Warren Michigan.

The M60 mounted a 105&nbsp;mm M68 main gun with the [[bore evacuator]] mounted towards the middle of the tube carrying 57 rounds in the clamshell shaped turret style of the M48. Nine rounds were stowed in the left side of the turret bustle behind the loader.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m48patton.html |title=90mm Gun Tank M48 Patton 48 |website=afvdb.50megs.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424102744/http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m48patton.html |archive-date=2019-04-24 |url-status=live }}</ref> The remaining rounds were stored inside safe containers on the hull floor.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com3\"/> A new short receiver coaxial machine gun was designed for the M60 tank.

The ballistic computer is a mechanically driven unit that permits ammunition selection, range correction, and superelevation correction by the gunner. The ballistic drive receives the range input and, through the use of cams and gears, provides superelevation information to the superelevation actuator. The superelevation actuator adds sufficient hydraulic fluid to the elevating mechanism to correctly position the gun.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nIn late 1962 a kit was fielded that allowed the use of the AN/VSS-1(V)1 IR searchlight. The searchlight has both infrared and visible light capabilities and was positioned over the gun. Along with an M32 IR periscope for the gunner, M19 IR periscope and M18 IR binoculars for the commander provided [[Night-vision device#Generation 1|first generation night vision]] capability to the M60 and M60A1 tanks. This kit was also compatible with the M48A5.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 166\u2013167 }}\n\nThe hull bottom had a strong boat-like appearance with a pronounced recess between the upper tracks and external suspension arms with cast aluminum roadwheels and return rollers along with a single shock absorber on the first roadwheel pair. Cast aluminum road wheels were used to save weight. The armor was improved, at 6 inches (155&nbsp;mm) on the front glacis and mantle of solid rolled homogeneous armor, while it was 4.3 inches (110&nbsp;mm) on the M48.  Power was provided by the AVDS-1790-2A engine, CD-850-5 cross drive transmission and the T97E2 track assembly as used on the M48A3.<ref>afvdb.50megs.com/usa/m48patton.html</ref> The drive sprocket is located at the rear of the hull. The vehicle also provides full NBC protection for the crew using the M13A1 protection system creating a positive atmospheric pressure in the crew compartment. The positive pressure keeps contaminated air out and forces the smoke produced from firing the main or coax guns out of the vehicle. Access between the driver's compartment and the turret fighting compartment was also restricted, requiring that the turret be traversed to the rear.\n\nThe M60 was deployed to [[West Germany]] to counter the threat presented from the [[T-54]]s and [[T-55]]s of the Soviet Union and [[Warsaw Pact]] as well as to South Korea but was never sent to [[Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnam]] mainly due to unfavorable terrain and the general lack of significant numbers of North Vietnamese armor.

In that time span numerous product improvement programs were put forward. As the major changes were incorporated into the production line, the vehicle model designations were changed. The first of which was Top Loading Air Cleaner (TLAC) in 1971. This reduced dirt and dust ingestion, which increased engine life as well as easier servicing of the engine.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 199 }} Early TLAC panels were made from aluminum and were vulnerable to damage from small arms fire.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> Next came Add-On Stabilization (AOS) that was introduced in late 1972.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 199 }} This was an add-on kit made to fit with minimum modifications to the existing hydraulic gun control system. The add-on-stabilization system provides stabilization control for both gun elevation and turret traverse. It provides the gunner with the capability of aiming and target tracking and also improved surveillance of the battlefield terrain by the gunner while the tank is moving.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> It may be used in any one of three modes of control: (1) power-with-stabilization-on, (2) power-with-stabilization-off, and (3) manual. In the power-with-stabilization-on mode, the gunner's aim on target is automatically retained while the vehicle is in motion. This mode provides a fire-on the-move capability. The power-with-stabilization-off option eliminates needless exercise of the stabilization system and provides a back up power mode. The manual back up system permits the crew to aim and fire the weapons should the electrical/hydraulical subsystems fail.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> At a range of 2000 meters, hit probabilities of better than 70% from a moving M60A1 were obtained in Aberdeen<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> test results while without a stabilizer it was essentially zero. M60A1s with this upgrade were denoted as the M60A1(AOS). The T142 track was fielded in 1974 which had replaceable rubber pads, better end connecters and improved service life.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 200 }} M60A1(AOS)+ was the denotation for M60A1s equipped with the TLAC, AOS and the T142 track.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nIntroduced in 1975 the Reliability Improved Selected Equipment (RISE) was a comprehensive upgrade of the M60A1 hull as well as integrating the previous TLAC and AOS upgrades. It included the upgraded [[Continental AV1790|AVDS-1790-2C RISE diesel engine]] and CD-850-6 transmission that featured several changes in order to improve service life and reliability. A new 650 ampere oil cooled alternator, a solid state regulator and new wiring harness with more accessible disconnectors was also incorporated into the hull's electrical system{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 200 }} as well as armored steel TLAC panels and the return to the use of steel roadwheels and return rollers. They were denoted as M60A1(RISE).<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> The 1977 fielding of the passive M32E1 sight for the gunner and M36E1 periscope for the commander as well as the M24E1 IR night vision block for the driver provided [[Night-vision device#Generation 2 (GEN II)|second generation night vision]] capabilities for M60A1 and RISE tanks. These new passive gunner's sight and commander's periscope provide recognition capability at longer ranges and at relatively low night light levels (1/2 moonlight). Under starlight conditions, they will provide recognition beyond 500 meters with the use of an IR searchlight.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> During 1978 a kit for the mounting of the M240 as the coaxial machine gun was fielded.  The development of the M735 [[Armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot|APFSDS]] ammunition required a cam update to the gun's mechanical ballistic drive for accurate firing. M60A1s configured to this standard were denoted as M60A1(RISE)+.\n[[File:US Army M551 Sheridan German village.jpg|thumb|A US Army M60A1 RISE Passive tank maneuvers through a narrow German village street while participating in [[Exercise REFORGER|REFORGER]] 1982.]]\nThe M60A1(RISE) Passive featured the implementation of all previous updates plus Kevlar spall liners for the turret, AN/VVS-2 passive night vision block for the driver, a deep water fording kit, the capability to mount Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA){{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 202 }}{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 56 }} and the AVDS-1790-2D RISE engine with CD-850-6A transmission and a Vehicle Engine Exhaust Smoke System (VEESS) that visually obscured the area around the vehicle.

The two six-barreled, electronically fired M239 smoke grenade launchers, one on each side of the main gun and replacement of the coax machine gun with the M240C were implemented in late 1978. The smoke grenades contains a phosphors compound that masks the thermal signature of the vehicle to the enemy.  They were denoted as M60A1(RISE) Passive.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nOver the period of M60A1 tank production several essential engineering changes were incorporated. Many of these miscellaneous changes are to improve the system safety, reliability, maintainability and increase mission performance. The M60A1 tank Hull/Turret PIP Update Kit includes those items that could not be readily identified with basic major product improvements and to incorporate essential engineering changes that had occurred during M60A1 tank production. The update program included engineering changes and minor product improvements which were not part of specific product improvements, but were required to upgrade early vintage M60A1 tanks up to the current M60A1(RISE) Passive production configuration.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nThe M60A1 was in production from October 1962 until May 1980<ref name=\"historyofwar.org\"/> and was extensively used by the US Army and Marine Corps as well as being widely exported to foreign governments. A total of 7,948 M60A1s (all variants including E60A) were built.{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 327 }} Many of them were later converted to the A3 standard.\n\n===M60A2{{anchor|M60A2}}===\nDuring the early 1960s there was some debate regarding the future of main tank weaponry, largely focusing on conventional kinetic energy rounds versus missiles. In the early 1960s it was generally accepted that the maximum effective range of the M68 gun was between 1800 and 2000 meters. The XM-13/MGM-51 missile system had proven itself viable, obtaining over 90% first round accuracy up to 4000 meters. But the development of a main-battle tank variant was bogged down by having too many design proposals. In response, studies were made in August 1961 to retrofit existing M60 tanks with a weapon capable of firing both conventional HEAT (High-Explosive Anti-Tank) rounds and launching ATGMs (Anti-Tank Guided-Missiles).<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/medium-tank-m60a2-starship/|title=152mm Gun/Launcher M60A2 'Starship'|date=7 July 2017|website=Tank Encyclopedia}}</ref> Three M60E1 tanks with T95 turrets were modified to permit the installation of the 152mm XM81 gun-launcher. Mounted on former M60 hulls, they were to provide test beds for the evaluation of the Shillelagh weapon system. Although this system was the preferred armament for the MBT-70, by late 1961 problems with the XM13 missile required that the program be reorganized. The missile was reclassified as an applied research project and it was obvious that there would be some delay before it would be available for service.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 627 }} On 10 January 1962, representatives from various ordnance organizations met at the Ordnance Tank-Automotive Center (OTAC) to review armament systems that might be suitable replacements, if the Shillelagh missile could not be developed in a timely manner. Time was particularly critical for the AR/AAV (the XM551 Sheridan) which required a decision on the armament by April 1962. The possible delay was not as serious for the MBT-70 since the program was limited to conceptual design and component development. The requirements also differed for the tank because of its ability to carry a much heavier weapon system. Several backup weapons were also under consideration and concept studies were prepared showing their application to the MBT-70 concepts. The 152mm gun-launcher XM81 also was considered without the missile depending only on the combustible case conventional ammunition. It was expected that the Shillelagh or some other missile then could be introduced at a later date. The 105mm gun M68 as standardized for the M60 tank was considered as an alternate armament system. It had the advantage of being immediately available and its ammunition was already in production. Of the several turrets drafted, one of the earliest was the driver-in-turret integrated fighting compartment. This design was further developed using the [[MBT-70]]. Another proposal was a more compact turret design of the T95E7.<ref>Hunnicutt, R.P. Patton: A History of the American Main Battle Tank, volume 1. Navato, CA: Presidio Press, 1984 pp.631-633</ref>\n\n;Development\n[[File:XM66 Type C design concept.png|thumb|Conceptual drawing of the XM66 with Type C turret]]\nDuring the development of the M60A2, three different turret types were considered, the Type A, Type B and Type C. The Type A turret would be constructed based on the T95E7 turret and then further modified and produced as the Type B standard. The Type C turret was essentially a larger [[M551 Sheridan]]-style turret. A mock-up of this turret was built, but the design was never seriously considered and soon abandoned. All of these conceptual variants were referred to as the XM66. On 10 January 1964, the Army reviewed all three variants and selected the Type A variant for further development. Initially two Type A turrets were built in 1964.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 138 }} The M60A1 hull was used starting in 1966 to develop the new compact turret design using the 152mm M162/XM81E13 rifled barrel main gun.

The M60A1E1 variant was used to evaluate the M162/XM81E13 gun on different mounts and compatibility with the XM13 Guided Missile, Armor Defeating together with the XMTM51 training round. They used a modified M60A1/T95E7 turret. During the early testing of the M162/XM81E13 main gun it was noted that misfires and premature detonations of the M409 conventional case ammunition were caused by unburnt propellant in the bore and breech. This flaw was often catastrophic as it set off the projectile in the barrel as it was fired.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/medium-tank-m60a2-starship/ |title=152mm Gun/Launcher M60A2 'Starship' |date=7 July 2017 |access-date=1 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327085943/http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/medium-tank-m60a2-starship/ |archive-date=27 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> To remedy this the guns were equipped with a traditional fume extractor on the barrel.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= }} The XM81E13 Gun/Launcher also experienced frequent faulty breaches, often not closing correctly during a missile firing, allowing the exhaust of the launching Shillelagh to vent hot noxious gasses into the crew compartment.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\"/> [[File:M60A1E1 Tank.jpg|thumb|left|M60A1E2 tank prototype with Type B turret.]] As the M60A1 hull became available in 1966, it was decided to upgrade these prototype vehicles to the M60A1 standard. Vehicles using the M60A1 hull and chassis received the M60A1E2 designation, and were used to develop the Type B compact turret.<ref>Sabot Publications, M60A2 Main Battle Tank in Detail, Volume 1/</ref> The M60A1E2 finalized the turret design with the use of a compact turret which reduced exposed frontal area by 40% compared to the M60A1 and continued development of the M51 Missile Guidance System (M51MGS).<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> These were later standardized as the M60A2. Initial plans called to retrofit the turret of every M60 with the new A2 turret, and use them in the mobile anti-armor role  alongside the M60A1 tanks. But the continual technical and reliability difficulties with the dual purpose gun caused this to be abandoned. The M60A1E3 variant was a prototype mounting the M68 105&nbsp;mm rifled gun to the turret of the M60A1E2. This was evaluated due to several earlier faults noted in the M60A1E1's main gun. Compared to the Shillelagh system, the use of the 105mm gun increased the overall tank weight by about 1700 pounds.<ref>Hunnicutt, R.P. Patton: A History of the American Main Battle Tank, volume 1. Navato, CA: Presidio Press, 1984 p.632</ref> The M60A1E4 was a conceptual variant that explored the use of various remote controlled weapons, including a 20mm gun as secondary armament.

It consisted of a large disk with a narrow channel in the center with each crew member in the turret having their own hatch. The gunner and loader were located to the right and left of the gun, respectively, and the commander was in a turret basket up and behind the main gun. As a result, each crew member was effectively isolated from one another with the gunner and loader separated by Shillelagh missiles in their storage position. The commander was in the rear compartment under a large redesigned cupola, which somewhat negated the low profile silhouette of the turret.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\"/> The M162 gun was fully stabilized in both turret traverse and gun elevation using the same upgrade kit as the M60A1 AOS. This system could be used by the gunner to engage targets with unguided M409 rounds while the vehicle was in motion, but the tank had to remain stationary when firing and tracking an MGM-51 missile.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\"/> The turret interior also received Kevlar spall liners. Four M226 smoke grenade launchers were mounted on each side of the turret bustle.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> Additionally  there was a mounting point to the left of the turret for an AN/VSS-1(V)1 Infrared Spotlight and M19E1 IR periscope providing [[Night-vision device#Generation 1|first generation night vision]] for night operations. A basket was fitted to the rear of the turret to stow the spotlight when not in use. Late production versions replaced the bore evacuator with the Closed-Bore Scavenger System (CBSS), a compressed air system that pushed the fumes and gasses out of the muzzle when the breach was opened.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Initial production M60A2s used the M60A1 hull powered by an AVDS-1790-2A TLAC engine, CD-850-5 cross-drive transmission and the T97 track assembly.

After acquiring a target a small charge would propel the missile out of the barrel, the missile's solid-fueled sustainer rocket then ignited and launched the Shillelagh. For the time of flight of the missile, the gunner had to keep the cross-hairs pointed at the target. A direct infrared beam  missile tracker in the gunner's sight detected any deviation of the flight path from the line-of-sight to the target, and transmitted corrective commands to the missile via an infrared command link. The MGM-51A was stabilized by flip-out fins, and controlled by hot gas jet reaction controls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-51.html|title=Ford MGM-51 Shillelagh|website=www.designation-systems.net}}</ref> The gunner also employed an [[M73 Machine gun|M73]] (later replaced with a [[M240 machine gun|M240C]]) to the gun mantle's right with 2,000 rounds.<ref>Sabot Publications, M60A2 Main Battle Tank in Detail, Volume</ref> The commanders cupola was redesigned causing the [[M85 machine gun|M85]] to be mounted in the inverted position in order to provide access to its feed cover and mounted a single M34 periscope carrying 600 rounds.<ref name=\"auto5\">Sabot Publications, M60A2 Main Battle Tank in Detail, Volume 2</ref> The M60A2's combat load for the M162 main gun consisted of 33 M409 rounds and 13 [[MGM-51 Shillelagh]] missiles.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/>\n\n;Flaws\nThis weapon system had several drawbacks. First the gunner had to keep the target in the crosshairs of the sight during the entire flight time of the missile.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://history.redstone.army.mil/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109174232/https://history.redstone.army.mil/ |archive-date=2019-01-09 |url-status=live }}</ref> This meant that only one target could be tracked and engaged at a time. Furthermore, the M60A2 could not fire or track a missile while moving.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> Secondly was the high minimum range of about 730&nbsp;m (2,400&nbsp;ft). Until the missile reached this range it flew beneath the tracking system's infrared beam and could therefore not be guided by the infrared command link. Also minimum range was slightly above the maximum effective range of the M60A2's conventional unguided munition, this created a dangerous gap area that could not be adequately covered by fire known as a \"dead zone\". It was also discovered that structural cracks in the barrel occurred after several missile firings. This defect was traced to a flaw in the longitudinal key, which fitted into a keyway inside the gun barrel. It was determined that a less deep key would significantly extend the service life of the barrel. The Missile Control System was also very fragile owing to its dependence on vacuum tubes which often broke when firing the gun.  Finally a Shillelagh missile was considerably more expensive than the M409 round. The vehicle was one of the most technologically complex of its era, eventually garnering an unofficial nickname of \"Starship\".<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> This also contributed to its failure, largely due to difficulties with maintenance, training, and complicated operation.\n\nThe M60A2 proved a disappointment, though its technical advancements would pave the way for future tanks. Its intended successor, the [[MBT-70]], was canceled in 1971 and its funding diverted into the [[History of the M1 Abrams#Development|conceptual development of the XM1 Abrams]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/mbt-70.htm |title = MBT-70 / Xm803}}</ref> The Shillelagh/M60A2 system was phased out from active units by 1981, and the turrets scrapped.

M60 series tanks were phased out of US service by 1997 and [[Opposing Force|OPFOR(S)]] training use in 2005. Together with the large number of M60MBTs still in foreign service and a large US Army surplus inventory, several upgrades for the tank were offered starting in 1985. There are three basic approaches to upgrade decisions for the M60MBT. Some countries, such as Taiwan and Jordan, have sought to modernize the M60 as a frontline main battle tank. Turkey is seeking a middle-ground, keeping it useful as it develops more modern designs. Other countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Thailand are modernizing their M60 fleets for counterinsurgency-type operations. While the market for M60 modernization is somewhat limited, because the tank is generally operated by poorer countries or has been relegated to secondary tasks, other companies have come up with more advanced upgrade solutions. Additionally, several countries also funded their own design upgrades, notable examples are the [[Magach]], [[Sabra (tank)|Sabra]] and Phoenix variants. In 2005, M60 variants were in service with [[Military of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Military of Greece|Greece]], [[Israel Defense Forces|Israel]], [[Royal Jordanian Army|Jordan]], [[Turkish Army|Turkey]], [[Republic of China Army|Taiwan]] and some 20 other nations to varying degrees.\n\n====Super M60/AX====\n[[File:Super-m60.jpg|thumb|right|General Dynamics Super M60/AX prototype, 1985]]The Super M60/AX, also called ''Super 60'', was a comprehensive update package for the M60A1 and A3 tanks, first offered in 1985 by General Dynamics. The vehicle was developed as a private venture for the export market and was never evaluated for US military service. The upgrade offered to increase the protection, firepower and mobility for the M60A1 and A3 tanks.\n\nAlthough the US Army chose not to pursue the installation of a new power pack or suspension system in the M60 series, General Dynamics formed a co-operative private venture with Telledyne Continental to develop an upgrade. The new engine and suspension not only smoothen the off-road ride, but also allowed the M60/AX to handle well in spite of its considerable weight increase over the original M60A1. After initial tests, additional modifications were applied, featuring an armor upgrade intended to increase protection from shaped charged projectiles.<ref>http://www.military-today.com/tanks/super_m60.htm</ref> It was referred to as the Super 60 Program.\n\nThe tank upgrade is based on the M60A1 RISE hull and the T95E7 turret as used on the M60A1 and A3 variants of the M60 series. Mobility was increased by 20% with a new engine and transmission. It featured the AVCR-1790-1B engine coupled to a Renk RK-304 transmission with 4 forward and 4 reverse gears. The torsion bar suspension system of the M60 was replaced with the National Waterlift hydropneumatic suspension system (HSS).{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1988|pages=  }} Survivability was enhanced with a layer of Chobham spaced [[Vehicle armour#Appliqu\u00e9|applique armor]] built around the M60A1 turret, that noticeably changed its appearance.

The Fire Control System (FCS) is essentially the same as used on the M60A3TTS consisting of an M21E1 solid-state ballistic computer, Raytheon AN/VSG2 Tank Thermal Sight (TTS) for the gunner, a Raytheon AN/VVS2 flash-lamp pumped ruby-laser based range finder, accurate up to 5000 meters, an M10A2E3 electro-mechanical ballistic drive and solid-state analog data card bus.  The [[prototype]] built did not have an optical range finder but one could have been easily installed.\n\nAs one of the first upgrade packages offered for the M60 series, the M60/AX prototype demonstrated the potential for upgrading the M60A1/A3 and even the M48 series as well. Even though this update package offered M60 users an opportunity to dramatically increase the combat capabilities of their tank fleets, no country ever bought the update, and the program effectively ceased by the end of the [[Cold War]]. Only one [[prototype]] was built. The overall failure of the Super 60 Program was likely due to the lack of immediate necessity for such a vehicle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.military-today.com/tanks/super_m60.htm |title=Super M60 Prototype Main Battle Tank |website=Military-today.com |access-date=2019-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190520231703/http://www.military-today.com/tanks/super_m60.htm |archive-date=2019-05-20 |url-status=live }}</ref> This design was also developed independently by Israel in their [[Magach#Versions|Magach 7]] series.\n\n====M60-2000 Main Battle Tank====\n{{main|M60-2000 Main Battle Tank}}\n[[File:M60-1220S.png|thumb|right|M60-120S]]\nThe [[General Dynamics Land Systems]] (GDLS) M60-2000 or 120S was an upgrade of the M60A1 tank. The development of the M60-2000 was primarily due to the large number of M60 Main Battle Tanks in service with many Middle Eastern nations unable to afford a sufficient force of more modern main battle tanks. The upgrade was marketed at those M60 users with the industrial capability to convert the tanks themselves. The M60-2000/120S was a GDLS supplied conversion kit that married the M1A1 turret of the [[M1 Abrams]] to the M60A1 RISE hull, offering many features of the M1A1 Abrams to existing M60 users at a reduced cost.\n\nIt was first referred to the M60-2000 Program and design work began in late 1999 by General Dynamics Land Systems as a private venture for the export market and was never evaluated for US military service. Later the M60 designation was dropped because of the extensive changes and to highlight this as a new vehicle to potential customers thus changing the name to the 120S Project. The M60-2000 was test-marketed during 2000 and a number of countries in NATO and the Middle East were briefed on the vehicle. Following customer feedback, detailed engineering work was carried out and in December GDLS decided to build a functional prototype.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/m60-2000.htm |title = M60-2000 / 120S Main Battle Tank}}</ref> In August 2001 the company rolled out the fully functional prototype of the 120S MBT at their Detroit, Michigan, facility. The prototype was shown at the IDEF Exhibition held in Turkey in October 2001.\n\nThe 120S was initially aimed at the Turkish Land Forces Command (TLFC) M60 upgrade requirement but this competition was subsequently won by [[Israel Military Industries|IMI Military Industries]] with their [[Sabra (tank)|Sabra II]] upgrade. The [[Egyptian Army]] was considering this offer until it was finally rejected in favor of a licensed contract to build M1s in Egypt.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dsca.mil/major-arms-sales/egypt-co-production-m1a1-abrams-tank |title = Egypt - Co-production of M1A1 Abrams Tank &#124; the Official Home of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency}}</ref> Only one prototype was made.

It was officially standardized as the '''Tank, Combat, Full Tracked: 105-mm Gun, M60''' in March 1959.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page=165}} Although developed from the [[M48 Patton]], the M60 series was never ''officially'' classified as a member of the Patton tank family, but as a \"product-improved descendant\" of the Patton tank's design.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 6, 408 }} The United States fully committed to the [[Main Battle Tank]] doctrine in 1963 when the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] retired the last ([[M103 (heavy tank)|M103]]) heavy tank battalion. The M60 tank series became America's primary main battle tank during the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 181 }} Over 15,000 M60s were built by Chrysler. Hull production ended in 1983, but 5,400 older models were converted to the M60A3 variant ending in 1990.<ref name=\"fas.org\" />\n\nIt reached operational capability with fielding to US Army units in Europe beginning in December 1960.<ref name=\"historyofwar.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_m60patton.html|title=M60 Patton Main Battle Tank (USA)|website=www.historyofwar.org}}</ref> The first combat usage of the M60 was with Israel during the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War]] where it saw service under the \"Magach 6\" designation, performing well in combat against comparable tanks such as the [[T-62]]. In 1982 the Israelis once again used the M60 during the [[1982 Lebanon War]], equipped with upgrades such as [[explosive reactive armor]] to defend against guided missiles that proved very effective at destroying tanks. The M60 also saw use in 1983 with [[United States invasion of Grenada|Operation Urgent Fury]], supporting US Marines in an amphibious assault into Grenada. M60s delivered to Iran also served in the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. The United States' largest deployment of M60s was in the 1991 [[Gulf War]], where the US Marines equipped with M60A1s effectively defeated Iraqi armored forces, including [[T-72|T-72M]] tanks. The United States readily retired the M60 after Operation Desert Storm, with the last units being retired from active service in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/armor/detail.asp?armor_id=28|title=M60 (Patton) Main Battle Tank (MBT) - United States|website=www.militaryfactory.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-07}}</ref> M60-series vehicles continue in front-line service with a number of countries' militaries, though most of these have been highly modified and had their firepower, mobility and protection upgraded to increase their combat effectiveness on the modern battlefield.\n\nThe M60 underwent many updates over its service life. The interior layout, based on the design of the M48, provided ample room for updates and improvements, extending the vehicle's service life for over four decades. It was widely used by the US and its Cold War allies, especially those in [[NATO]], and remains in service throughout the world today, despite having been superseded by the [[M1 Abrams]] in the US military. The tank's hull also developed a wide variety of prototypical, utility and support vehicles such as armored recovery vehicles, bridge layers and combat engineering vehicles. As of 2015 [[Egypt]] is the largest operator with 1,716 upgraded M60A3s, [[Turkey]] is second with 866 upgraded units in service, and [[Saudi Arabia]] is third with over 650 units.\n\n==Development==\n===Impetus===\nThe United States entered a period of frenzied activity during the crisis atmosphere of the [[Korean War]], when America seemed to lag behind the Soviet Union in terms of tank quality and quantity.<ref name=\"benning.army.mil\">https://www.benning.army.mil/Armor/Historian/content/PDF/Armor%20Dev%20Cold%20War.pdf</ref> Testing and development cycles occurred simultaneously with production to ensure speedy delivery of new tanks. Such rapid production caused problems but the importance given to rapidly equipping combat units with new tanks precluded detailed testing and evaluation prior to quantity production.<ref name=\"benning.army.mil\"/>\n\nThe [[M47 Patton]] entered production in 1951 and was used by the United States Army and Marine Corps but ongoing technical and production problems kept it from serving in the Korean War. The [[M48 Patton]] tank entered US service in 1952 but its early designs were deemed unsatisfactory by Army Field Forces (AFF). The improvements to the M48 focused on improving the 90mm main gun and fire control systems while simultaneously exploring the development of silicas glass composite armor and autoloader systems. The tank continued further development through 1955 in conjunction with its simultaneous mass production. The course of its development during the mid 1950s was the source of widespread debate among Congressional Budget Oversight committees.\n\nThe [[T95 Medium Tank|T95 program]], which began in 1955 was intended to supersede the M48. It featured a host of innovative and experimental components such as its 90&nbsp;mm smoothbore T208 cannon rigidly affixed to its turret, experimental X-shaped engine design, composite armor and infrared rangefinder. The burden of developing them, however, slowed the overall program to a crawl. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, a Soviet [[T-54/T-55|T-54A]] medium tank was driven onto the grounds of the UK's embassy in Budapest by the Hungarians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/the-beast-of-budapest.htm |title=The Beast of Budapest |website=HistoryNet.com |date=19 July 2018 |access-date=1 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921230135/http://www.historynet.com/the-beast-of-budapest.htm |archive-date=21 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> After a brief examination of this tank's armor by a British military attach\u00e9 it was concluded that the [[Ordnance QF 20-pounder|20-pounder (84mm L/66.7)]] was apparently incapable of defeating its frontal armor with HEAT or APC ammunition. Its 100mm main gun was a significant advancement over the weapon of the [[T-44]]. Also there were rumors of an even larger 115mm gun in the works. These events spurred the [[United Kingdom]] to develop a new tank gun in 1956, the [[Royal Ordnance L7]] to keep the [[Centurion (tank)|Centurion]] viable against this new Soviet tank design and the [[United States]] to develop the XM60 tank in 1957.<ref name=Halberstadt>{{Cite book |last=Halberstadt |first=Hans |title=Inside the Great Tanks |publisher=The Crowood Press |location=Wiltshire, England |year=1997 |pages=94\u201396 |isbn=1-86126-270-1 |oclc=40989477 |quote=The T-54/T-55 series is the hands down, all time most popular tank in history.}}</ref> This new tank design incorporated many Army Combat Vehicle (ARCOVE) committee improvements to the M48, chiefly the use of diesel engines to increase its operational range and the use of a more powerful main gun.\n\n===Choice of components===\n\n====M68 105 mm Main Gun====\nThe main gun was chosen after a comparative firing test of six different guns carried out on the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in 1958. The factors evaluated were accuracy, lethality of a hit, rate of fire and penetration performance.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 453\u2013454 }}\n\nAn M48A2C was fit with the 90&nbsp;mm M41 and tested with the new T300E53 HEAT round. A smoothbore version of the 90&nbsp;mm, the T208E9, was mounted on the T95E1 tank and tested the T320E62 APDS round. An American version of the British L7 105&nbsp;mm gun, under the name [[Royal Ordnance L7#United States|105&nbsp;mm T254E1]], was mounted on the T95E2 and tested with British APDS ammunition. Finally, two versions of the 120&nbsp;mm gun from the M103 were trialed, the existing M58 model and a lightened variant known as T123E6 which was mounted on the T95E4.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 155 }}\n\nThe T123E6 was preferred by the Ordnance Department because its ammunition, the same as that for the M58 gun, was already at an advanced state of development.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page=153 }} The ammunition was in two parts, shell and propellant bag, which required significant time to load. In the M103 this was addressed by adding a second loader, but a medium tank would not have the internal space needed for another crewmember and the firing rate would suffer as a result. In testing it demonstrated a maximum rate  of 4 rounds per minute vs. the T254's 7 rpm.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 453\u2013454 }}\n\nBased on these tests, the 105&nbsp;mm T254E1 was selected, modified to the T254E2 and standardized as the [[Royal Ordnance L7|Cannon, 105mm Gun, M68]]. It used a vertical sliding breechblock instead of the T254E1's horizontal breechblock.

The M60 hull had a straight slope and beak compared to the earlier M48's rounded one. The hull bottom had a strong boat-like appearance with a pronounced recess between the upper tracks and external suspension arms and one shock absorber on the first roadwheel pair. The armor was improved, at 6 inches (155&nbsp;mm) on the front glacis and mantle of solid rolled homogeneous armor, while it was 4.3 inches (110&nbsp;mm) on the M48. The first prototype hulls did not have shock absorbers and were briefly named M68 in late 1958 before the Ordnance Department renamed it the M60 in March 1959.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com3\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/M60_Patton.php |title=M60 Patton |date=18 November 2014 |website=Tank Encyclopedia |access-date=10 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910223330/http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/M60_Patton.php |archive-date=10 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> This hull version was used only on the original M60 variant and early M728s and M60AVLBs.

This hull model was used on the M60A1, M60A2 and M60A3 models of the M60-series as well as the M728A1 and M60A1 AVLB.

The T95E5 turret used on the M60 was hemispherically shaped and bore a strong resemblance to the M48 Patton. The M60A1 was the first version to employ the newly designed T95E7 turret with a redesigned bustle increasing the number of rounds for the main gun to 63. The M60A2 featured a specially designed turret for the M162 gun/missile launcher that greatly reduced the frontal arc in comparison to the M60A1's T95E7 turret.  The M60A3's turret was similar to the A1's but with increased armor protection for the frontal arc and mantlet in an effort to provide additional protection of the turret's hydraulics system.\n\n====M19 Commander's Cupola====\nA redesigned full vision cupola was envisioned for the commander's station. It had 7 tiltable vision blocks arranged to give the commander a 360 degree field of view with overlapping vision between adjacent vision blocks. The front vision block could be replaced with a dual power M34 7x50 binocular day sight or an M19E1 IR periscope. A special feature was that the cupola body could be raised up to 3 1/2 inches providing the commander a direct field of vision while remaining under armor protection. Access was through a hatch cover on the roof and a .50 caliber M2HB machine gun was pedestal mounted on the forward part of the cupola. It could be aimed and fired with the cupola closed. Also there was an 11 inch long hydraulically operated port on the left side allowing spent cartridge cases to be ejected.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 156 }} After creating a full-sized mock up of this design using the [[T95 Medium Tank#Versions and modifications|T95E6 turret]], it was dropped in favor of a design based on the M1 cupola of the M48A2's turret. This T9 cupola provided the commander with more headroom than the T6 cupola of the T95 tank, carrying a new [[Receiver (firearms)|short receiver]] M85/T175 .50 caliber machine gun{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 156 }} and it was standardized as the Cupola, Tank Commander's Caliber .50 Machine Gun,<ref name=\"Direct Support 1975\" /> M19. The first M19 cupola (a modified T9) was ready on 27 October 1958. It has an M28C sight for the machine gun in the forward part of the cupola and eight vision blocks. The front vision block can be replaced by a M19E1 infrared periscope or an M36E1 passive periscope for night observation.<ref name=\"ReferenceE\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/weapons_m60patton.html |title = M60 Patton Main Battle Tank (USA)}}</ref> Initial production of the cupola was problematic. The first 300 M60s produced were armed with a .50cal M2HB machine gun in a pedestal mount welded to the left side of the commander's cupola owing to production problems with the new M85 machine gun. Of these tanks, the first 45 manufactured were made without the cupola itself, also due to production problems.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Crismon, Fred W. U.S. Military Tracked Vehicles. Osceola, WI: Motorbooks International, 1992</ref> All of these early M60s eventually had the M19 cupola and M85 machine gun installed.\n\nCompared to a conventional pintle mount, the remote-controlled M85 machine gun was relatively ineffective in the anti-aircraft role for which it was designed. Removing the cupola lowered the vehicle's relatively high silhouette. The cupola's hatch also opened toward the rear of the vehicle and was dangerous to close if under small-arms fire owing to a lock-open mechanism that required the user to apply leverage to unlock it prior to closing. The commander was able to observe the battlefield using the binocular M34 vision block or M19E1 IR Periscope while remaining under armor protection with a 360 degree traverse independent of the turret,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60a3.htm |title=M60A3 Patton |website=onwar.com |access-date=2019-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914203428/https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60a3.htm |archive-date=2018-09-14 |url-status=live }}</ref> was stabilized in azimuth and elevation<ref name=\"50megs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m60.html|title=105mm Gun Tank M60|website=afvdb.50megs.com|access-date=2019-05-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190528154422/http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m60.html|archive-date=2019-05-28|url-status=live}}</ref> and carried 600 rounds of ammunition.<ref name=\"onwar.com1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60.htm |title=M60 Patton |website=onwar.com |access-date=2019-04-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190426112135/https://www.onwar.com/weapons/afv/data/usambtm60.htm |archive-date=2019-04-26 |url-status=live }}</ref> All M60s in US service retained the M19 cupola until the tank was phased out of service. The few M60A3s in Army service as training vehicles had their commander's cupola removed as it was deemed unnecessary for training and to better mimic the profile of Soviet tanks. Some M48A5s were retrofitted with the M19 cupola to maintain training levels of National Guard units.\n\n====Main Battle Tank Designation====\nThe concept of the [[medium tank]] gradually evolved into the [[Main Battle Tank]] (MBT) in the 1960s. The MBT was to combine the firepower and protection sufficient for the assault role with the mobility to perform as a medium tank.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 149 }} The main battle tank thus took on the role the British had once called the \"universal tank\", exemplified by the [[Centurion (tank)|British Centurion]], filling almost all battlefield roles. Typical main battle tanks were as well armed as any other vehicle on the battlefield, highly mobile, and well armored. Yet they were cheap enough to be built in large numbers. The first generation consists of the medium tanks designed and produced directly after World War II that were later redefined as main battle tanks. These were exemplified by the [[M47 Patton|M47]] and [[M48 Patton]]s armed with  a 90mm main gun already in widespread US service. The original variant of the M60 series also fulfilled the definition of a late first generation MBT sometimes being referred to as an intermediate second generation design. The Soviet [[T-54/T-55|T-54 and T-55]] as well as the original configuration of the [[T-62|T-62A]] tank designs are also regarded as first generation MBTs. The second generation had enhanced night-fighting capabilities and in most cases NBC protection. Most western tanks of this generation were armed with the 105&nbsp;mm Royal Ordnance L7 tank gun or derivatives of it. Notable are the [[Chieftain (tank)|British Chieftain]] and [[Leopard 1|German Leopard 1]]. The United States fully committed to the main battle tank doctrine in 1963 when the Marine Corps deactivated its last [[M103 (heavy tank)|M103 Heavy Tank]] battalion.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1988|page= 327 }} The first American nomenclature-designated second generation MBT was the M60A1 version of the M60 series. The term MBT is used in strategic doctrine and the composition of force as determined by the United States Army. The M60 series tanks fulfilled the MBT role on a strategic and tactical level. It was never referred to as such in any official training or technical manuals. The first Soviet second generation main battle tank designs were the [[T-64]] and [[T-72]].<ref>\u0422\u0430\u043d\u043a \u0422-62. \u0420\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043f\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u044d\u043a\u0441\u043f\u043b\u0443\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438. 1968</ref>\n\n===Production Versions===\n\n===XM60 Development===\nBy May 1957 it became clear that the [[T95 Medium Tank]] would not have a significant advantage over the [[M48A2]]. The X-shaped motor and electro-optical rangefinder were both discarded due to performance, and the accuracy of the smoothbore gun continued to be unsatisfactory. All this led to the closure of the T95 project on July 7, 1960. At the same time, work on the T95E7 turret was continued, which led to the creation of the fairly successful M60A1 turret.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 149 }} The course of the M48 Patton's tank production was the source of widespread Congressional debate. The [[Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]] believed that the Army was not progressing with sufficient speed in its tank modernization program and recommended the immediate replacement of the M48A2. Correctly predicting that Congress would not approve the procurement of the M48A2 after the fiscal year 1959, the Deputy Chief of Staff, Logistics (DCSLOG) proposed a tank based on the M48A2 featuring improved firepower and the AVDS-1790 engine. Since the main gun had not yet been specified, four XM60 weapons systems were submitted in September 1957.\n\n[[File:XM60 120 big.png|thumb|left|Concept design #1 of the XM60 mounting the T123E6 main gun and British styled gun barrel, the newly designed full-vision cupola using the T95E6 turret as preferred by the Ordnance Department.]] \nThe first concept was armed with the 120mm gun T123E6 in the long nosed T95E6 turret. This was the design preferred by the Ordnance Department. It was fitted with a newly designed full-vision commander's cupola. A full sized mock-up of this turret was constructed before this concept was dropped, mainly due to its slow rate of fire. The second carried the 105mm rifled T254E2 main gun in the T95E5 type turret and the T9 cupola style of the M48A2. The T254 guns used British X15/L52 barrels with a concentric bore evacuator on the barrel.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 62 }} The Army Ordnance Technical Committee chose this design for production in August 1958. The third concept was to mount the 90mm T208 smooth-bore main gun and the T95E6 turret. It never progressed beyond design drawings. The fourth used the T95E1 turret and the T208 main gun. A mock-up was built using the new vision cupola. All of these conceptual designs were referred to as the XM60. A contract was awarded to Chrysler Engineering in September 1958 for the advanced production engineering (APE) of the XM60 concept #2.{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 47 }} The T95 hull was considered however its one-piece front casting was too difficult and expensive to produce in quantity. Some existing T95 hulls were re-fitted with the AVDS-1790 engine and used from 1960 to 1964 to develop the T118E1 prototyping of the [[M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle]].<ref>Tank Data, vol. 3. Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD: US Army Ordnance School, Jul 1968.</ref> Instead the decision was made to use modified M48A2 hulls. The hulls had 3 return rollers and 6 steel roadwheel pairs per side with no shock absorbers, using only bumper springs on the first and sixth roadwheel arms, along with a widened turret well and ring, and a flat wedge-shaped glacis. The T254E2 gun was chosen to be the main weapon of the tank in August 1958 being standardized as the M68 105mm gun. After a briefing on 11 December 1958, [[Maxwell D. Taylor|General Maxwell Taylor]] ordered the XM60 into production because of the improvements it offered in firepower, protection, and cruising range.{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 47 }}  Since the tank had not yet received its official designation these prototype hulls were briefly referred to as the M68 in December 1958 until they were officially named the M60 in March 1959.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com3\" /> Fulfilling this requirement was an interim tank design that resulted in the M60-series,{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 152 }} which largely resembles the M48 it was based on, but has significant differences.\n\n===M60===\n[[File:M60 Pilot 1.jpg|thumb|M60 production pilot number 1 after completion by Chrysler on 2 July 1959.

In August 1959, an engineering bid package was awarded for the second low rate production buy of M60s to be built at the Delaware Plant. Production pilot 3 was completed 2 September and went to the Detroit Arsenal Test Center for maintenance evaluations, it was then sent to Fort Knox for user trials.

The M60 mounted a 105&nbsp;mm M68 main gun with the [[bore evacuator]] mounted towards the middle of the tube carrying 57 rounds in the clamshell shaped turret style of the M48. Nine rounds were stowed in the left side of the turret bustle behind the loader.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m48patton.html |title=90mm Gun Tank M48 Patton 48 |website=afvdb.50megs.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424102744/http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/pics/m48patton.html |archive-date=2019-04-24 |url-status=live }}</ref> The remaining rounds were stored inside safe containers on the hull floor.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com3\"/> A new short receiver coaxial machine gun was designed for the M60 tank.

The ballistic computer is a mechanically driven unit that permits ammunition selection, range correction, and superelevation correction by the gunner. The ballistic drive receives the range input and, through the use of cams and gears, provides superelevation information to the superelevation actuator. The superelevation actuator adds sufficient hydraulic fluid to the elevating mechanism to correctly position the gun.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nIn late 1962 a kit was fielded that allowed the use of the AN/VSS-1(V)1 IR searchlight. The searchlight has both infrared and visible light capabilities and was positioned over the gun. Along with an M32 IR periscope for the gunner, M19 IR periscope and M18 IR binoculars for the commander provided [[Night-vision device#Generation 1|first generation night vision]] capability to the M60 and M60A1 tanks. This kit was also compatible with the M48A5.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|pages= 166\u2013167 }}\n\nThe hull bottom had a strong boat-like appearance with a pronounced recess between the upper tracks and external suspension arms with cast aluminum roadwheels and return rollers along with a single shock absorber on the first roadwheel pair. Cast aluminum road wheels were used to save weight. The armor was improved, at 6 inches (155&nbsp;mm) on the front glacis and mantle of solid rolled homogeneous armor, while it was 4.3 inches (110&nbsp;mm) on the M48.  Power was provided by the AVDS-1790-2A engine, CD-850-5 cross drive transmission and the T97E2 track assembly as used on the M48A3.<ref>afvdb.50megs.com/usa/m48patton.html</ref> The drive sprocket is located at the rear of the hull. The vehicle also provides full NBC protection for the crew using the M13A1 protection system creating a positive atmospheric pressure in the crew compartment. The positive pressure keeps contaminated air out and forces the smoke produced from firing the main or coax guns out of the vehicle. Access between the driver's compartment and the turret fighting compartment was also restricted, requiring that the turret be traversed to the rear.\n\nThe M60 was deployed to [[West Germany]] to counter the threat presented from the [[T-54]]s and [[T-55]]s of the Soviet Union and [[Warsaw Pact]] as well as to South Korea but was never sent to [[Republic of Vietnam|South Vietnam]] mainly due to unfavorable terrain and the general lack of significant numbers of North Vietnamese armor.

It featured several design improvements  including an updated gun hydraulic configuration, a stabilization upgrade for the gun, a gun elevation kill switch for the loader, improved ballistic drive and other component refinements.<ref name=\"ReferenceI\"/>\n\n;Upgrades\nAs development of a new main battle tank stalled with problems and cost escalating quickly, the M60A1 was forced to serve longer than originally intended with production lasting almost 20 years. In that time span numerous product improvement programs were put forward. As the major changes were incorporated into the production line, the vehicle model designations were changed. The first of which was Top Loading Air Cleaner (TLAC) in 1971. This reduced dirt and dust ingestion, which increased engine life as well as easier servicing of the engine.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 199 }} Early TLAC panels were made from aluminum and were vulnerable to damage from small arms fire.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> Next came Add-On Stabilization (AOS) that was introduced in late 1972.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 199 }} This was an add-on kit made to fit with minimum modifications to the existing hydraulic gun control system. The add-on-stabilization system provides stabilization control for both gun elevation and turret traverse. It provides the gunner with the capability of aiming and target tracking and also improved surveillance of the battlefield terrain by the gunner while the tank is moving.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> It may be used in any one of three modes of control: (1) power-with-stabilization-on, (2) power-with-stabilization-off, and (3) manual. In the power-with-stabilization-on mode, the gunner's aim on target is automatically retained while the vehicle is in motion. This mode provides a fire-on the-move capability. The power-with-stabilization-off option eliminates needless exercise of the stabilization system and provides a back up power mode. The manual back up system permits the crew to aim and fire the weapons should the electrical/hydraulical subsystems fail.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> At a range of 2000 meters, hit probabilities of better than 70% from a moving M60A1 were obtained in Aberdeen<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> test results while without a stabilizer it was essentially zero. M60A1s with this upgrade were denoted as the M60A1(AOS). The T142 track was fielded in 1974 which had replaceable rubber pads, better end connecters and improved service life.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 200 }} M60A1(AOS)+ was the denotation for M60A1s equipped with the TLAC, AOS and the T142 track.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nIntroduced in 1975 the Reliability Improved Selected Equipment (RISE) was a comprehensive upgrade of the M60A1 hull as well as integrating the previous TLAC and AOS upgrades. It included the upgraded [[Continental AV1790|AVDS-1790-2C RISE diesel engine]] and CD-850-6 transmission that featured several changes in order to improve service life and reliability. A new 650 ampere oil cooled alternator, a solid state regulator and new wiring harness with more accessible disconnectors was also incorporated into the hull's electrical system{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 200 }} as well as armored steel TLAC panels and the return to the use of steel roadwheels and return rollers. They were denoted as M60A1(RISE).<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> The 1977 fielding of the passive M32E1 sight for the gunner and M36E1 periscope for the commander as well as the M24E1 IR night vision block for the driver provided [[Night-vision device#Generation 2 (GEN II)|second generation night vision]] capabilities for M60A1 and RISE tanks. These new passive gunner's sight and commander's periscope provide recognition capability at longer ranges and at relatively low night light levels (1/2 moonlight). Under starlight conditions, they will provide recognition beyond 500 meters with the use of an IR searchlight.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/> During 1978 a kit for the mounting of the M240 as the coaxial machine gun was fielded.  The development of the M735 [[Armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot|APFSDS]] ammunition required a cam update to the gun's mechanical ballistic drive for accurate firing. M60A1s configured to this standard were denoted as M60A1(RISE)+.\n[[File:US Army M551 Sheridan German village.jpg|thumb|A US Army M60A1 RISE Passive tank maneuvers through a narrow German village street while participating in [[Exercise REFORGER|REFORGER]] 1982.]]\nThe M60A1(RISE) Passive featured the implementation of all previous updates plus Kevlar spall liners for the turret, AN/VVS-2 passive night vision block for the driver, a deep water fording kit, the capability to mount Explosive Reactive Armor (ERA){{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 202 }}{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 56 }} and the AVDS-1790-2D RISE engine with CD-850-6A transmission and a Vehicle Engine Exhaust Smoke System (VEESS) that visually obscured the area around the vehicle. The VEESS smokescreen system does not provide protection against infrared, thermal or laser detection. The two six-barreled, electronically fired M239 smoke grenade launchers, one on each side of the main gun and replacement of the coax machine gun with the M240C were implemented in late 1978. The smoke grenades contains a phosphors compound that masks the thermal signature of the vehicle to the enemy.  They were denoted as M60A1(RISE) Passive.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nOver the period of M60A1 tank production several essential engineering changes were incorporated. Many of these miscellaneous changes are to improve the system safety, reliability, maintainability and increase mission performance. The M60A1 tank Hull/Turret PIP Update Kit includes those items that could not be readily identified with basic major product improvements and to incorporate essential engineering changes that had occurred during M60A1 tank production. The update program included engineering changes and minor product improvements which were not part of specific product improvements, but were required to upgrade early vintage M60A1 tanks up to the current M60A1(RISE) Passive production configuration.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\"/>\n\nThe M60A1 was in production from October 1962 until May 1980<ref name=\"historyofwar.org\"/> and was extensively used by the US Army and Marine Corps as well as being widely exported to foreign governments. A total of 7,948 M60A1s (all variants including E60A) were built.{{sfn|Lathrop|McDonald|2003|page= 327 }} Many of them were later converted to the A3 standard.\n\n===M60A2{{anchor|M60A2}}===\nDuring the early 1960s there was some debate regarding the future of main tank weaponry, largely focusing on conventional kinetic energy rounds versus missiles. In the early 1960s it was generally accepted that the maximum effective range of the M68 gun was between 1800 and 2000 meters. The XM-13/MGM-51 missile system had proven itself viable, obtaining over 90% first round accuracy up to 4000 meters. But the development of a main-battle tank variant was bogged down by having too many design proposals. In response, studies were made in August 1961 to retrofit existing M60 tanks with a weapon capable of firing both conventional HEAT (High-Explosive Anti-Tank) rounds and launching ATGMs (Anti-Tank Guided-Missiles).<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/medium-tank-m60a2-starship/|title=152mm Gun/Launcher M60A2 'Starship'|date=7 July 2017|website=Tank Encyclopedia}}</ref> Three M60E1 tanks with T95 turrets were modified to permit the installation of the 152mm XM81 gun-launcher. Mounted on former M60 hulls, they were to provide test beds for the evaluation of the Shillelagh weapon system. Although this system was the preferred armament for the MBT-70, by late 1961 problems with the XM13 missile required that the program be reorganized. The missile was reclassified as an applied research project and it was obvious that there would be some delay before it would be available for service.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 627 }} On 10 January 1962, representatives from various ordnance organizations met at the Ordnance Tank-Automotive Center (OTAC) to review armament systems that might be suitable replacements, if the Shillelagh missile could not be developed in a timely manner. Time was particularly critical for the AR/AAV (the XM551 Sheridan) which required a decision on the armament by April 1962. The possible delay was not as serious for the MBT-70 since the program was limited to conceptual design and component development. The requirements also differed for the tank because of its ability to carry a much heavier weapon system. Several backup weapons were also under consideration and concept studies were prepared showing their application to the MBT-70 concepts. The 152mm gun-launcher XM81 also was considered without the missile depending only on the combustible case conventional ammunition. It was expected that the Shillelagh or some other missile then could be introduced at a later date. The 105mm gun M68 as standardized for the M60 tank was considered as an alternate armament system. It had the advantage of being immediately available and its ammunition was already in production. Of the several turrets drafted, one of the earliest was the driver-in-turret integrated fighting compartment. This design was further developed using the [[MBT-70]]. Another proposal was a more compact turret design of the T95E7.<ref>Hunnicutt, R.P. Patton: A History of the American Main Battle Tank, volume 1. Navato, CA: Presidio Press, 1984 pp.631-633</ref>\n\n;Development\n[[File:XM66 Type C design concept.png|thumb|Conceptual drawing of the XM66 with Type C turret]]\nDuring the development of the M60A2, three different turret types were considered, the Type A, Type B and Type C. The Type A turret would be constructed based on the T95E7 turret and then further modified and produced as the Type B standard. The Type C turret was essentially a larger [[M551 Sheridan]]-style turret. A mock-up of this turret was built, but the design was never seriously considered and soon abandoned. All of these conceptual variants were referred to as the XM66. On 10 January 1964, the Army reviewed all three variants and selected the Type A variant for further development. Initially two Type A turrets were built in 1964.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 138 }} The M60A1 hull was used starting in 1966 to develop the new compact turret design using the 152mm M162/XM81E13 rifled barrel main gun. These developmental tanks were designated as the M60A1E series.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= 141 }}\n\nThe M60A1E1 referred to vehicles based on the modified T95E7 Type A turrets with M60 hulls used through 1965. The M60A1E1 variant was used to evaluate the M162/XM81E13 gun on different mounts and compatibility with the XM13 Guided Missile, Armor Defeating together with the XMTM51 training round. They used a modified M60A1/T95E7 turret. During the early testing of the M162/XM81E13 main gun it was noted that misfires and premature detonations of the M409 conventional case ammunition were caused by unburnt propellant in the bore and breech. This flaw was often catastrophic as it set off the projectile in the barrel as it was fired.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/medium-tank-m60a2-starship/ |title=152mm Gun/Launcher M60A2 'Starship' |date=7 July 2017 |access-date=1 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327085943/http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/US/medium-tank-m60a2-starship/ |archive-date=27 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> To remedy this the guns were equipped with a traditional fume extractor on the barrel.{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1984|page= }} The XM81E13 Gun/Launcher also experienced frequent faulty breaches, often not closing correctly during a missile firing, allowing the exhaust of the launching Shillelagh to vent hot noxious gasses into the crew compartment.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\"/> [[File:M60A1E1 Tank.jpg|thumb|left|M60A1E2 tank prototype with Type B turret.]] As the M60A1 hull became available in 1966, it was decided to upgrade these prototype vehicles to the M60A1 standard. Vehicles using the M60A1 hull and chassis received the M60A1E2 designation, and were used to develop the Type B compact turret.<ref>Sabot Publications, M60A2 Main Battle Tank in Detail, Volume 1/</ref> The M60A1E2 finalized the turret design with the use of a compact turret which reduced exposed frontal area by 40% compared to the M60A1 and continued development of the M51 Missile Guidance System (M51MGS).<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> These were later standardized as the M60A2. Initial plans called to retrofit the turret of every M60 with the new A2 turret, and use them in the mobile anti-armor role  alongside the M60A1 tanks. But the continual technical and reliability difficulties with the dual purpose gun caused this to be abandoned. The M60A1E3 variant was a prototype mounting the M68 105&nbsp;mm rifled gun to the turret of the M60A1E2. This was evaluated due to several earlier faults noted in the M60A1E1's main gun. Compared to the Shillelagh system, the use of the 105mm gun increased the overall tank weight by about 1700 pounds.<ref>Hunnicutt, R.P. Patton: A History of the American Main Battle Tank, volume 1. Navato, CA: Presidio Press, 1984 p.632</ref> The M60A1E4 was a conceptual variant that explored the use of various remote controlled weapons, including a 20mm gun as secondary armament.

It consisted of a large disk with a narrow channel in the center with each crew member in the turret having their own hatch. The gunner and loader were located to the right and left of the gun, respectively, and the commander was in a turret basket up and behind the main gun. As a result, each crew member was effectively isolated from one another with the gunner and loader separated by Shillelagh missiles in their storage position. The commander was in the rear compartment under a large redesigned cupola, which somewhat negated the low profile silhouette of the turret.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\"/> The M162 gun was fully stabilized in both turret traverse and gun elevation using the same upgrade kit as the M60A1 AOS. This system could be used by the gunner to engage targets with unguided M409 rounds while the vehicle was in motion, but the tank had to remain stationary when firing and tracking an MGM-51 missile.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com4\"/> The turret interior also received Kevlar spall liners. Four M226 smoke grenade launchers were mounted on each side of the turret bustle.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> Additionally  there was a mounting point to the left of the turret for an AN/VSS-1(V)1 Infrared Spotlight and M19E1 IR periscope providing [[Night-vision device#Generation 1|first generation night vision]] for night operations. A basket was fitted to the rear of the turret to stow the spotlight when not in use.

After acquiring a target a small charge would propel the missile out of the barrel, the missile's solid-fueled sustainer rocket then ignited and launched the Shillelagh. For the time of flight of the missile, the gunner had to keep the cross-hairs pointed at the target. A direct infrared beam  missile tracker in the gunner's sight detected any deviation of the flight path from the line-of-sight to the target, and transmitted corrective commands to the missile via an infrared command link. The MGM-51A was stabilized by flip-out fins, and controlled by hot gas jet reaction controls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/m-51.html|title=Ford MGM-51 Shillelagh|website=www.designation-systems.net}}</ref> The gunner also employed an [[M73 Machine gun|M73]] (later replaced with a [[M240 machine gun|M240C]]) to the gun mantle's right with 2,000 rounds.<ref>Sabot Publications, M60A2 Main Battle Tank in Detail, Volume</ref> The commanders cupola was redesigned causing the [[M85 machine gun|M85]] to be mounted in the inverted position in order to provide access to its feed cover and mounted a single M34 periscope carrying 600 rounds.<ref name=\"auto5\">Sabot Publications, M60A2 Main Battle Tank in Detail, Volume 2</ref> The M60A2's combat load for the M162 main gun consisted of 33 M409 rounds and 13 [[MGM-51 Shillelagh]] missiles.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/>\n\n;Flaws\nThis weapon system had several drawbacks.

Furthermore, the M60A2 could not fire or track a missile while moving.<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> Secondly was the high minimum range of about 730&nbsp;m (2,400&nbsp;ft). Until the missile reached this range it flew beneath the tracking system's infrared beam and could therefore not be guided by the infrared command link. Also minimum range was slightly above the maximum effective range of the M60A2's conventional unguided munition, this created a dangerous gap area that could not be adequately covered by fire known as a \"dead zone\". It was also discovered that structural cracks in the barrel occurred after several missile firings. This defect was traced to a flaw in the longitudinal key, which fitted into a keyway inside the gun barrel. It was determined that a less deep key would significantly extend the service life of the barrel. The Missile Control System was also very fragile owing to its dependence on vacuum tubes which often broke when firing the gun.  Finally a Shillelagh missile was considerably more expensive than the M409 round. The vehicle was one of the most technologically complex of its era, eventually garnering an unofficial nickname of \"Starship\".<ref name=\"tanks-encyclopedia.com2\"/> This also contributed to its failure, largely due to difficulties with maintenance, training, and complicated operation.\n\nThe M60A2 proved a disappointment, though its technical advancements would pave the way for future tanks. Its intended successor, the [[MBT-70]], was canceled in 1971 and its funding diverted into the [[History of the M1 Abrams#Development|conceptual development of the XM1 Abrams]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/mbt-70.htm |title = MBT-70 / Xm803}}</ref> The Shillelagh/M60A2 system was phased out from active units by 1981, and the turrets scrapped.

These were essentially M60s with minor modifications requested by approved foreign purchasers.  Some of the modifications included removal of the M19 cupola, different models of machine guns, electronics, fire control systems or radios, external armor plates, smoke launchers and power packs.<ref>https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a528585.pdf</ref> Israel purchased many of these tanks forming the basis for the [[Magach#Versions|Magach 6]] series.\n\nThis series included the following designations:\n*E60: modified M60 variant for non-US service\n*E60A: modified M60A1 variant for non-US service\n*E60B: modified M60A3 variant for non-US service\n\nThe M60A2 was never approved for foreign sales.\n\n===Foreign upgrades===\nA [[United States Congress|US Congressional Report]] in November 1993 stated that there were 5,522 serviceable M60A1 and M60A3 tanks in the US Army's inventory available for sale or transfer to US allies or foreign nations. Of these 111 were in [[South Korea|Korea]], 1,435 were in [[Europe]], and 3,976 located in the continental US (CONUS). The average age of these tanks was 16 years and an expected peacetime service life of 20 years. The average price was US$212,898 per tank without radios or machine guns and they were not overhauled.

M60 series tanks were phased out of US service by 1997 and [[Opposing Force|OPFOR(S)]] training use in 2005. Together with the large number of M60MBTs still in foreign service and a large US Army surplus inventory, several upgrades for the tank were offered starting in 1985. There are three basic approaches to upgrade decisions for the M60MBT. Some countries, such as Taiwan and Jordan, have sought to modernize the M60 as a frontline main battle tank. Turkey is seeking a middle-ground, keeping it useful as it develops more modern designs. Other countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Thailand are modernizing their M60 fleets for counterinsurgency-type operations. While the market for M60 modernization is somewhat limited, because the tank is generally operated by poorer countries or has been relegated to secondary tasks, other companies have come up with more advanced upgrade solutions. Additionally, several countries also funded their own design upgrades, notable examples are the [[Magach]], [[Sabra (tank)|Sabra]] and Phoenix variants. In 2005, M60 variants were in service with [[Military of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Military of Greece|Greece]], [[Israel Defense Forces|Israel]], [[Royal Jordanian Army|Jordan]], [[Turkish Army|Turkey]], [[Republic of China Army|Taiwan]] and some 20 other nations to varying degrees.\n\n====Super M60/AX====\n[[File:Super-m60.jpg|thumb|right|General Dynamics Super M60/AX prototype, 1985]]The Super M60/AX, also called ''Super 60'', was a comprehensive update package for the M60A1 and A3 tanks, first offered in 1985 by General Dynamics. The vehicle was developed as a private venture for the export market and was never evaluated for US military service. The upgrade offered to increase the protection, firepower and mobility for the M60A1 and A3 tanks.\n\nAlthough the US Army chose not to pursue the installation of a new power pack or suspension system in the M60 series, General Dynamics formed a co-operative private venture with Telledyne Continental to develop an upgrade. The new engine and suspension not only smoothen the off-road ride, but also allowed the M60/AX to handle well in spite of its considerable weight increase over the original M60A1. After initial tests, additional modifications were applied, featuring an armor upgrade intended to increase protection from shaped charged projectiles.<ref>http://www.military-today.com/tanks/super_m60.htm</ref> It was referred to as the Super 60 Program.\n\nThe tank upgrade is based on the M60A1 RISE hull and the T95E7 turret as used on the M60A1 and A3 variants of the M60 series. Mobility was increased by 20% with a new engine and transmission. It featured the AVCR-1790-1B engine coupled to a Renk RK-304 transmission with 4 forward and 4 reverse gears. The torsion bar suspension system of the M60 was replaced with the National Waterlift hydropneumatic suspension system (HSS).{{sfn|Hunnicutt|1988|pages=  }} Survivability was enhanced with a layer of Chobham spaced [[Vehicle armour#Appliqu\u00e9|applique armor]] built around the M60A1 turret, that noticeably changed its appearance.

A pair of steel track skirts were added as well as Kevlar spall liners for the fighting compartment. It has a crew of 4, the commander, loader and gunner are positioned in the turret and the driver in the front of the hull.\n[[File:Magach-7-latrun-2.jpg|left|thumb|Magach 7C in Yad la-Shiryon museum, Latrun.]]\nThe weapons of the M60/AX are similar to those of the M60A3, but different models were used. The main gun is the rifled 105&nbsp;mm/L55 M68A1E2 with a longer XM24 tube and a thermal sleeve, the same weapon used on the M1 and M1IP versions of the [[M1 Abrams]] MBT with 43 rounds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tanknutdave.com/the-us-super-m60-tank-upgrade-package/|title=The US Super M60 Tank Upgrade Package}}</ref>  The 7.62&nbsp;mm M73 coaxial machine gun used on the M60A1 is replaced with a 7.62&nbsp;mm M240C, with the same number of rounds. The M19 cupola was replaced with a low silhouette model with a pop-up hatch for the commander and a 12.7&nbsp;mm [[M2 Browning|M2HB]] machine gun on a pintle mount with 600 rounds. The Fire Control System (FCS) is essentially the same as used on the M60A3TTS consisting of an M21E1 solid-state ballistic computer, Raytheon AN/VSG2 Tank Thermal Sight (TTS) for the gunner, a Raytheon AN/VVS2 flash-lamp pumped ruby-laser based range finder, accurate up to 5000 meters, an M10A2E3 electro-mechanical ballistic drive and solid-state analog data card bus.  The [[prototype]] built did not have an optical range finder but one could have been easily installed.\n\nAs one of the first upgrade packages offered for the M60 series, the M60/AX prototype demonstrated the potential for upgrading the M60A1/A3 and even the M48 series as well. Even though this update package offered M60 users an opportunity to dramatically increase the combat capabilities of their tank fleets, no country ever bought the update, and the program effectively ceased by the end of the [[Cold War]]. Only one [[prototype]] was built. The overall failure of the Super 60 Program was likely due to the lack of immediate necessity for such a vehicle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.military-today.com/tanks/super_m60.htm |title=Super M60 Prototype Main Battle Tank |website=Military-today.com |access-date=2019-06-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190520231703/http://www.military-today.com/tanks/super_m60.htm |archive-date=2019-05-20 |url-status=live }}</ref> This design was also developed independently by Israel in their [[Magach#Versions|Magach 7]] series.\n\n====M60-2000 Main Battle Tank====\n{{main|M60-2000 Main Battle Tank}}\n[[File:M60-1220S.png|thumb|right|M60-120S]]\nThe [[General Dynamics Land Systems]] (GDLS) M60-2000 or 120S was an upgrade of the M60A1 tank. The development of the M60-2000 was primarily due to the large number of M60 Main Battle Tanks in service with many Middle Eastern nations unable to afford a sufficient force of more modern main battle tanks. The upgrade was marketed at those M60 users with the industrial capability to convert the tanks themselves. The M60-2000/120S was a GDLS supplied conversion kit that married the M1A1 turret of the [[M1 Abrams]] to the M60A1 RISE hull, offering many features of the M1A1 Abrams to existing M60 users at a reduced cost.\n\nIt was first referred to the M60-2000 Program and design work began in late 1999 by General Dynamics Land Systems as a private venture for the export market and was never evaluated for US military service. Later the M60 designation was dropped because of the extensive changes and to highlight this as a new vehicle to potential customers thus changing the name to the 120S Project. The M60-2000 was test-marketed during 2000 and a number of countries in NATO and the Middle East were briefed on the vehicle. Following customer feedback, detailed engineering work was carried out and in December GDLS decided to build a functional prototype.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/m60-2000.htm |title = M60-2000 / 120S Main Battle Tank}}</ref> In August 2001 the company rolled out the fully functional prototype of the 120S MBT at their Detroit, Michigan, facility.

[[Jordan]] and the [[Golan Heights]] border the river to the east, while the [[West Bank]] and [[Israel]] lie to its west. Both Jordan and the West Bank take their names from the river.\n\nThe river holds major significance in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]] since the [[Bible]] says that the Israelites crossed it into the [[Promised Land]] and that [[Jesus of Nazareth]] [[Baptism of Jesus|was baptized]] by [[John the Baptist]] in it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interfaithsustain.com/an-interfaith-look-at-the-jordan-river/|title=An Interfaith Look at the Jordan River|accessdate=16 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418195919/http://www.interfaithsustain.com/an-interfaith-look-at-the-jordan-river/|archive-date=18 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Jordan River has an upper course from its sources to the Sea of Galilee, and a lower course south of the Sea of Galilee down to the Dead Sea. In traditional terminology, the upper course (or most of it) is commonly referred to as passing through the \"[[Hula Valley]]\", as opposed to \"Upper Jordan Valley\"; the Sea of Galilee through which the river passes is a separate entity; and the term [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] is reserved for the lower course, fed by the Yarmouk and Zarqa Rivers.\n\nOver its upper course (fed by the Hasbani River, Banias River, Dan River, and the Iyyon Stream), the river drops rapidly in a {{convert|75|km|adj=on}} run to the once large and swampy [[Hula Valley|Lake Hula]], which is slightly above [[sea level]]. Exiting the now much-diminished lake, it goes through an even steeper drop over the {{convert|25|km}} down to the Sea of Galilee, which it enters at its northern end. The Jordan deposits much of the silt it is carrying within the lake, which it leaves again near its southern tip at [[Degania Dam]]. At that point, the river is situated about 210 metres below sea level. The last {{convert|120|km|adj=on}}-long section follows what is commonly termed the \"Jordan Valley\", which has less [[stream gradient|gradient]] (the total drop is another 210 metres) so that the river [[meander]]s before entering the [[Dead Sea]], a [[Endorheic basin|terminal lake]] about 422 metres below sea level with no outlet. Two major [[Tributary|tributaries]] enter from the east during this last section: the [[Yarmouk River]] and [[Zarqa River]].\n\nIts section north of the Sea of Galilee is within the boundaries of Israel and forms the western boundary of the [[Golan Heights]]. South of the lake, it forms the border between the Kingdom of Jordan (to the east), and Israel (to the west).\n\n===Tributaries===\n[[File:The Jordan River loops, aerial view 1938.jpg|thumb|Aerial view, 1938]]\n\nThe streams coming together to create the River Jordan in its upper basin are, west to east:\n* [[Nahal Ayun|Iyyon]] (Hebrew: \u05e2\u05d9\u05d5\u05df ''Iyyon''), Arabic name: Ajoun stream,<ref name=AFIAL2012/> but \u062f\u0631\u062f\u0631\u0647 ''Dardara'' for the uppermost course and \u0628\u0631\u0627\u063a\u064a\u062b ''Bareighith'' or ''Beregeith'' for the rest of its course, a stream which flows from [[Marjeyoun District|Merj 'Ayun area]] in southern Lebanon.\n* [[Hasbani River|Hasbani]] (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0635\u0628\u0627\u0646\u064a ''Hasbani'', Hebrew: either \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05e8 ''Snir'' or ''Hatzbani''), a stream which flows from the north-western foot of Mount Hermon in Lebanon.<ref>{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rhAzDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT260 |title= Essays in Political Geography |last= |first= |publisher= Routledge |year= 2016 |isbn= 9781317605287 |page= 260 |access-date=2019-01-17 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200102035947/https://books.google.com/books?id=rhAzDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT260 |archive-date= 2020-01-02 |url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=AFIAL2012>{{cite web |authors= Mark Zeitoun, Karim Eid-Sabbagh, Muna Dajani, Michael Talhami |title= Hydro-political Baseline of the Upper Jordan River |pages= 19-23, chapter ''Sources of the Jordan'' (2.1) |publisher= Association of the Friends of Ibrahim Abd el Al (AFIAL) with the [[University of East Anglia|UEA]] Water Security Research Centre |location= Beirut |year= 2012 |url= https://www.uea.ac.uk/documents/439774/1029261/UJR+Hydropol+Baseline+-+Main+lo-res+%282012%29.pdf/28ae7dc7-e16f-45a4-95a1-d285edbfc528 |access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n* [[Dan River (Middle East)|Dan]] (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0646 ''Leddan'' or ''Liddan'', Hebrew: \u05d3\u05df ''Dan''), the largest among the Jordan's upper course tributaries,<ref name=AFIAL2012/> a stream whose source is also at the base of Mount Hermon.<ref name=carta>[http://carta-jerusalem.com/biblical-sites/jordan-river/ Jordan River], Carta Jerusalem, accessed 82020</ref><ref name=AFIAL2012/>\n* [[Nahal Hermon|Banias]] (Arabic: \u0628\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627\u0633 ''Banias'', Hebrew: either ''Banias'' or \u05d7\u05e8\u05de\u05d5\u05df ''Hermon''),<ref name=carta/><ref name=AFIAL2012/> a stream arising from a spring at [[Banias]] at the foot of [[Mount Hermon]], with\n**Nahal Assal (Hebrew) / Wadi el-Asl (Arabic) as a major tributary.<ref name=AFIAL2012/>\n\nSouth of the [[Sea of Galilee]], the Jordan River receives the waters of further tributaries, the main ones, both coming from the east (Jordan), being\n* [[Yarmouk River|Yarmouk]], the largest tributary of the lower course of the River Jordan, which forms the border between Syria and Jordan and then Jordan and Israel<ref name=FAO2009>The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO)] of the [[United Nations]], [http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/basins/jordan/print1.stm  ''Jordan Basin''], based on 2009 \"Water Report 34\", accessed 18 April 2020</ref><ref name=Gafny>Gafny, S.

There is no regular description of the Jordan in the Bible; only scattered and indefinite references to it are given. [[Jacob]] crossed it and its tributary, the [[Jabbok]] (the modern Al-Zarqa), on his way back from [[Haran]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|32:11|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|32:23\u201324|HE}}). It is noted as the line of demarcation between the \"two tribes and the half tribe\" settled to the [[Transjordan (Bible)|east]] ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] {{bibleverse-nb||Numbers|34:15|HE}}) and the \"nine tribes and the half tribe of Manasseh\" that, led by [[Joshua]], settled to the west ({{bibleverse||Joshua|13:7|HE}}, passim). \n\nOpposite [[Jericho]], it was called \"the Jordan of Jericho\" ({{bibleverse||Numbers|34:15|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Numbers|35:1|HE}}). The Jordan has a number of [[ford (crossing)|fords]], and one of them is famous as the place where many Ephraimites were slain by Jephthah ([[Book of Judges|Judges]] {{bibleverse-nb||Judges|12:5\u20136|HE}}). It seems that these are the same fords mentioned as being near Beth-barah, where Gideon lay in wait for the [[Midian]]ites ({{bibleverse||Judges|7:24|HE}}). In the plain of the Jordan, between [[Sukkot|Succoth]] and [[Zarthan]], is the clay ground where Solomon had his brass-foundries ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Kings|7:46|HE}}). In {{bibleverse|2|Kings|6:1-4|HE}} the Jordan valley is portrayed as a woodland region. Biblical commentator [[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] suggested that \"trees were rare in most parts of Palestine, but plentiful in the Jordan Valley\".<ref>[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/6.htm Barnes' Notes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106204816/http://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/6.htm |date=2018-01-06 }} on 2 Kings 6, accessed 26 December 2017</ref>\n\nIn biblical history, the Jordan appears as the scene of several [[miracle]]s, the first taking place when the Jordan, near Jericho, was crossed by the Israelites under Joshua ({{bibleverse||Joshua|3:15\u201317|HE}}). Later the two tribes and the half tribe that settled east of the Jordan built a large altar on its banks as \"a witness\" between them and the other tribes ({{bibleverse||Joshua|22:10|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|22:26|HE}}, et seq.). The Jordan was crossed by [[Elijah]] and [[Elisha]] on dry ground ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|2:8|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|2:14|HE}}). The prophet and wonder-worker Elisha performed two miracles at the Jordan: he healed [[Naaman]]'s [[leprosy]] by having him bathe in its waters ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|5:14|HE}}), and he made an axe head lost by one of the \"children of the prophets\" float, by throwing a piece of wood into the water ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|6:6|HE}}).\n\n[[Yom HaAliyah]] (Aliyah Day, {{lang-he|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d9\u05d4}}) is an [[Israel]]i national holiday celebrated annually on the tenth of the [[Hebrew]] month of [[Nisan]] to commemorate the Israelites crossing the Jordan River into the Land of Israel while carrying the [[Ark of the Covenant]] as recorded in the Hebrew Bible\u2019s Book of Joshua.\n\n===New Testament===\n[[File:Jordanian Christian women visiting Al-Maghtas, Jordan River, 1913 (cropped) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Jordanian Christian women on pilgrimage to [[Al-Maghtas]], 28 November 1913.]]\nThe [[New Testament]] states that [[John the Baptist]] baptised unto repentance<ref>Cf. {{bibleverse||Acts|19:4|KJV}}</ref> in the Jordan ([[Matthew 3:5]]\u2013[[Matthew 3:6|6]]; [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]]{{bibleverse-nb||Mark|1:5|KJV}}; [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|3:3|KJV}}; [[Gospel of John|John]]{{bibleverse-nb||John|1:28|KJV}}). These acts of [[Baptism]] are also reported as having taken place at [[Bethabara]] ({{bibleverse||John|1:28|KJV}}).\n\n[[File:Bethany (5).JPG|250px|right|thumb| [[Al-Maghtas]] ruins on the Jordanian side of the Jordan River are the putative location for the Baptism of [[Jesus]] and the ministry of [[John the Baptist]]]]\n\n[[Jesus]] came [[Baptism of Jesus|to be baptised]] by him there ([[Matthew 3:13]]; {{bibleverse||Mark|1:9|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|3:21|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|4:1|KJV}}). The Jordan is also where John the Baptist bore record of Jesus as the [[Son of God]] and [[Lamb of God]] ({{bibleverse||John|1:29\u201336|KJV}}).\n\nThe [[prophecy]] of [[Isaiah]] regarding the [[Messiah]] which names the Jordan ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|9:1\u20132|KJV}}) is also reported in {{bibleverse||Matthew|4:15|KJV}}.\n\nThe New Testament speaks several times about Jesus crossing the Jordan during his ministry ({{bibleverse||Matthew|19:1|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|10:1|KJV}}), and of believers crossing the Jordan to come hear him [[Sermon|preach]] and to be [[miracle|healed]] of their diseases ({{bibleverse||Matthew|4:25|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|3:7\u20138|KJV}}). When his enemies sought to capture him, Jesus took refuge at the river in the place John had first baptised ({{bibleverse||John|10:39\u201340|KJV}}).\n\nScholars have concluded that the site called [[Al-Maghtas]] on the east side has long been considered the location for the Baptism of Jesus and a place of pilgrimage though most current pilgrims go to a location on the west side, [[Qasr el Yahud]], also long'established but not as early.

[[Jordan]] and the [[Golan Heights]] border the river to the east, while the [[West Bank]] and [[Israel]] lie to its west. Both Jordan and the West Bank take their names from the river.\n\nThe river holds major significance in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]] since the [[Bible]] says that the Israelites crossed it into the [[Promised Land]] and that [[Jesus of Nazareth]] [[Baptism of Jesus|was baptized]] by [[John the Baptist]] in it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interfaithsustain.com/an-interfaith-look-at-the-jordan-river/|title=An Interfaith Look at the Jordan River|accessdate=16 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418195919/http://www.interfaithsustain.com/an-interfaith-look-at-the-jordan-river/|archive-date=18 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Jordan River has an upper course from its sources to the Sea of Galilee, and a lower course south of the Sea of Galilee down to the Dead Sea. In traditional terminology, the upper course (or most of it) is commonly referred to as passing through the \"[[Hula Valley]]\", as opposed to \"Upper Jordan Valley\"; the Sea of Galilee through which the river passes is a separate entity; and the term [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] is reserved for the lower course, fed by the Yarmouk and Zarqa Rivers.\n\nOver its upper course (fed by the Hasbani River, Banias River, Dan River, and the Iyyon Stream), the river drops rapidly in a {{convert|75|km|adj=on}} run to the once large and swampy [[Hula Valley|Lake Hula]], which is slightly above [[sea level]]. Exiting the now much-diminished lake, it goes through an even steeper drop over the {{convert|25|km}} down to the Sea of Galilee, which it enters at its northern end. The Jordan deposits much of the silt it is carrying within the lake, which it leaves again near its southern tip at [[Degania Dam]]. At that point, the river is situated about 210 metres below sea level. The last {{convert|120|km|adj=on}}-long section follows what is commonly termed the \"Jordan Valley\", which has less [[stream gradient|gradient]] (the total drop is another 210 metres) so that the river [[meander]]s before entering the [[Dead Sea]], a [[Endorheic basin|terminal lake]] about 422 metres below sea level with no outlet. Two major [[Tributary|tributaries]] enter from the east during this last section: the [[Yarmouk River]] and [[Zarqa River]].\n\nIts section north of the Sea of Galilee is within the boundaries of Israel and forms the western boundary of the [[Golan Heights]]. South of the lake, it forms the border between the Kingdom of Jordan (to the east), and Israel (to the west).\n\n===Tributaries===\n[[File:The Jordan River loops, aerial view 1938.jpg|thumb|Aerial view, 1938]]\n\nThe streams coming together to create the River Jordan in its upper basin are, west to east:\n* [[Nahal Ayun|Iyyon]] (Hebrew: \u05e2\u05d9\u05d5\u05df ''Iyyon''), Arabic name: Ajoun stream,<ref name=AFIAL2012/> but \u062f\u0631\u062f\u0631\u0647 ''Dardara'' for the uppermost course and \u0628\u0631\u0627\u063a\u064a\u062b ''Bareighith'' or ''Beregeith'' for the rest of its course, a stream which flows from [[Marjeyoun District|Merj 'Ayun area]] in southern Lebanon.\n* [[Hasbani River|Hasbani]] (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0627\u0635\u0628\u0627\u0646\u064a ''Hasbani'', Hebrew: either \u05e9\u05e0\u05d9\u05e8 ''Snir'' or ''Hatzbani''), a stream which flows from the north-western foot of Mount Hermon in Lebanon.<ref>{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=rhAzDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT260 |title= Essays in Political Geography |last= |first= |publisher= Routledge |year= 2016 |isbn= 9781317605287 |page= 260 |access-date=2019-01-17 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200102035947/https://books.google.com/books?id=rhAzDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT260 |archive-date= 2020-01-02 |url-status= live}}</ref><ref name=AFIAL2012>{{cite web |authors= Mark Zeitoun, Karim Eid-Sabbagh, Muna Dajani, Michael Talhami |title= Hydro-political Baseline of the Upper Jordan River |pages= 19-23, chapter ''Sources of the Jordan'' (2.1) |publisher= Association of the Friends of Ibrahim Abd el Al (AFIAL) with the [[University of East Anglia|UEA]] Water Security Research Centre |location= Beirut |year= 2012 |url= https://www.uea.ac.uk/documents/439774/1029261/UJR+Hydropol+Baseline+-+Main+lo-res+%282012%29.pdf/28ae7dc7-e16f-45a4-95a1-d285edbfc528 |access-date=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n* [[Dan River (Middle East)|Dan]] (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0644\u062f\u0627\u0646 ''Leddan'' or ''Liddan'', Hebrew: \u05d3\u05df ''Dan''), the largest among the Jordan's upper course tributaries,<ref name=AFIAL2012/> a stream whose source is also at the base of Mount Hermon.<ref name=carta>[http://carta-jerusalem.com/biblical-sites/jordan-river/ Jordan River], Carta Jerusalem, accessed 82020</ref><ref name=AFIAL2012/>\n* [[Nahal Hermon|Banias]] (Arabic: \u0628\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627\u0633 ''Banias'', Hebrew: either ''Banias'' or \u05d7\u05e8\u05de\u05d5\u05df ''Hermon''),<ref name=carta/><ref name=AFIAL2012/> a stream arising from a spring at [[Banias]] at the foot of [[Mount Hermon]], with\n**Nahal Assal (Hebrew) / Wadi el-Asl (Arabic) as a major tributary.<ref name=AFIAL2012/>\n\nSouth of the [[Sea of Galilee]], the Jordan River receives the waters of further tributaries, the main ones, both coming from the east (Jordan), being\n* [[Yarmouk River|Yarmouk]], the largest tributary of the lower course of the River Jordan, which forms the border between Syria and Jordan and then Jordan and Israel<ref name=FAO2009>The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO)] of the [[United Nations]], [http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/basins/jordan/print1.stm  ''Jordan Basin''], based on 2009 \"Water Report 34\", accessed 18 April 2020</ref><ref name=Gafny>Gafny, S.

There is no regular description of the Jordan in the Bible; only scattered and indefinite references to it are given. [[Jacob]] crossed it and its tributary, the [[Jabbok]] (the modern Al-Zarqa), on his way back from [[Haran]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|32:11|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|32:23\u201324|HE}}). It is noted as the line of demarcation between the \"two tribes and the half tribe\" settled to the [[Transjordan (Bible)|east]] ([[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] {{bibleverse-nb||Numbers|34:15|HE}}) and the \"nine tribes and the half tribe of Manasseh\" that, led by [[Joshua]], settled to the west ({{bibleverse||Joshua|13:7|HE}}, passim). \n\nOpposite [[Jericho]], it was called \"the Jordan of Jericho\" ({{bibleverse||Numbers|34:15|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Numbers|35:1|HE}}). The Jordan has a number of [[ford (crossing)|fords]], and one of them is famous as the place where many Ephraimites were slain by Jephthah ([[Book of Judges|Judges]] {{bibleverse-nb||Judges|12:5\u20136|HE}}). It seems that these are the same fords mentioned as being near Beth-barah, where Gideon lay in wait for the [[Midian]]ites ({{bibleverse||Judges|7:24|HE}}). In the plain of the Jordan, between [[Sukkot|Succoth]] and [[Zarthan]], is the clay ground where Solomon had his brass-foundries ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] {{bibleverse-nb|1|Kings|7:46|HE}}). In {{bibleverse|2|Kings|6:1-4|HE}} the Jordan valley is portrayed as a woodland region. Biblical commentator [[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] suggested that \"trees were rare in most parts of Palestine, but plentiful in the Jordan Valley\".<ref>[http://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/6.htm Barnes' Notes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180106204816/http://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_kings/6.htm |date=2018-01-06 }} on 2 Kings 6, accessed 26 December 2017</ref>\n\nIn biblical history, the Jordan appears as the scene of several [[miracle]]s, the first taking place when the Jordan, near Jericho, was crossed by the Israelites under Joshua ({{bibleverse||Joshua|3:15\u201317|HE}}). Later the two tribes and the half tribe that settled east of the Jordan built a large altar on its banks as \"a witness\" between them and the other tribes ({{bibleverse||Joshua|22:10|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Joshua|22:26|HE}}, et seq.). The Jordan was crossed by [[Elijah]] and [[Elisha]] on dry ground ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|2:8|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb|2|Kings|2:14|HE}}). The prophet and wonder-worker Elisha performed two miracles at the Jordan: he healed [[Naaman]]'s [[leprosy]] by having him bathe in its waters ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|5:14|HE}}), and he made an axe head lost by one of the \"children of the prophets\" float, by throwing a piece of wood into the water ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|6:6|HE}}).\n\n[[Yom HaAliyah]] (Aliyah Day, {{lang-he|\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd \u05d4\u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d9\u05d4}}) is an [[Israel]]i national holiday celebrated annually on the tenth of the [[Hebrew]] month of [[Nisan]] to commemorate the Israelites crossing the Jordan River into the Land of Israel while carrying the [[Ark of the Covenant]] as recorded in the Hebrew Bible\u2019s Book of Joshua.\n\n===New Testament===\n[[File:Jordanian Christian women visiting Al-Maghtas, Jordan River, 1913 (cropped) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Jordanian Christian women on pilgrimage to [[Al-Maghtas]], 28 November 1913.]]\nThe [[New Testament]] states that [[John the Baptist]] baptised unto repentance<ref>Cf. {{bibleverse||Acts|19:4|KJV}}</ref> in the Jordan ([[Matthew 3:5]]\u2013[[Matthew 3:6|6]]; [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]]{{bibleverse-nb||Mark|1:5|KJV}}; [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|3:3|KJV}}; [[Gospel of John|John]]{{bibleverse-nb||John|1:28|KJV}}). These acts of [[Baptism]] are also reported as having taken place at [[Bethabara]] ({{bibleverse||John|1:28|KJV}}).\n\n[[File:Bethany (5).JPG|250px|right|thumb| [[Al-Maghtas]] ruins on the Jordanian side of the Jordan River are the putative location for the Baptism of [[Jesus]] and the ministry of [[John the Baptist]]]]\n\n[[Jesus]] came [[Baptism of Jesus|to be baptised]] by him there ([[Matthew 3:13]]; {{bibleverse||Mark|1:9|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|3:21|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|4:1|KJV}}). The Jordan is also where John the Baptist bore record of Jesus as the [[Son of God]] and [[Lamb of God]] ({{bibleverse||John|1:29\u201336|KJV}}).\n\nThe [[prophecy]] of [[Isaiah]] regarding the [[Messiah]] which names the Jordan ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|9:1\u20132|KJV}}) is also reported in {{bibleverse||Matthew|4:15|KJV}}.\n\nThe New Testament speaks several times about Jesus crossing the Jordan during his ministry ({{bibleverse||Matthew|19:1|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|10:1|KJV}}), and of believers crossing the Jordan to come hear him [[Sermon|preach]] and to be [[miracle|healed]] of their diseases ({{bibleverse||Matthew|4:25|KJV}}; {{bibleverse||Mark|3:7\u20138|KJV}}). When his enemies sought to capture him, Jesus took refuge at the river in the place John had first baptised ({{bibleverse||John|10:39\u201340|KJV}}).\n\nScholars have concluded that the site called [[Al-Maghtas]] on the east side has long been considered the location for the Baptism of Jesus and a place of pilgrimage though most current pilgrims go to a location on the west side, [[Qasr el Yahud]], also long'established but not as early.
