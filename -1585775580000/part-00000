It is the first  published in his  ''Foundation Trilogy'' (later expanded into [[The Foundation Series|the ''Foundation'' Series]]). ''Foundation'' is a cycle of five interrelated short stories, first published as a single book by [[Gnome Press]] in 1951. Collectively they tell the early story of the Foundation, an institute founded by psychohistorian Hari Seldon to preserve the best of galactic civilization after the collapse of the Galactic Empire.\n\n==Origin and early publication history==\nFour of the five stories had been earlier published in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' between 1942 and 1944 under different titles. A fifth part, the first in terms of fictional chronology, was added for the 1951 Gnome Press edition.  The original four stories also appeared in 1955 as part of [[List of Ace double novels|Ace Double's novel series]] as D-110 under the title '''''The 1,000-Year Plan'''''.\n\nTwo further books, each consisting of two novellas, were published shortly after and the three are considered a trilogy. Asimov would write two further sequel novels and two prequels. Later writers have written new additions authorized by Asimov's estate. The ''Foundation'' Series is often regarded as one of Isaac Asimov's best works, alongside his [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'' series]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Background==\nOn 1 August 1941 [[Isaac Asimov]] proposed to [[John W. Campbell]] of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' that he write a short story set in a slowly declining Galactic Empire, based on the [[fall of the Roman Empire]]. Campbell liked the idea, and by the end of a two-hour meeting Asimov planned to write a series of stories depicting the fall of the first Galactic Empire and the rise of the second. Asimov submitted the first \"Foundation\" story on 8 September, Campbell purchased it on 15 September, and ''Astounding'' published it in May 1942. Asimov wrote seven more stories over eight years, and they were collected into [[Foundation trilogy|''The Foundation Trilogy'']]. Published from 1951 to 1953, the three books became Asimov's most popular science fiction and won a [[Hugo Award]] for Best All-Time Series in 1966.<ref name=\"earlyyears383_387\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/384/mode/2up |title=The early Asimov; or, Eleven years of trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City NY |pages=383\u2013387}}</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\n===\"The Psychohistorians\"===\nThis part is original to the 1951 book version and takes place in 0 F.E. (\"Foundation Era\"). The story begins on [[Trantor]], the capital of the 12,000-year-old [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]], a powerful but slowly decaying empire. [[Hari Seldon]], a mathematician and psychologist, has developed [[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]], a new field of science and psychology that equates all possibilities in large societies to mathematics, allowing for the prediction of future events.\n\nBy means of psychohistory, Seldon has discovered the declining nature of the Empire, angering the aristocratic members of the Committee of Public Safety, the ''de facto'' rulers of the Empire.  The Committee considers Seldon's views and statements treasonous, and he is arrested along with young mathematician [[Gaal Dornick]], who has arrived on Trantor to meet Seldon.  Seldon is tried by the Committee and defends his beliefs, explaining his theories and predictions, including his belief that the Empire will collapse in 500 years and enter a 30,000-year dark age.  He informs the Committee that an alternative to this future is attainable, and explains to them that creating a compendium of all human knowledge, the ''[[Encyclopedia Galactica]]'', would not avert the inevitable fall of the Empire but would reduce the dark age to one millennium.\n\nThe skeptical Committee, not wanting to make Seldon a martyr, offers him exile to a remote world, [[Terminus (planet)|Terminus]], with others who could help him create the ''Encyclopedia''.  He accepts their offer, prepares for the departure of the \"Encyclopedists\" and receives an imperial decree officially acknowledging his actions. Seldon informs Dornick that despite the Empire believing they won by exiling Seldon the outcome was exactly what he had hoped would happen. Terminus would be the home of the first Foundation while a second would be established \"at Star's End.\" Seldon further announces he's dying and implores Dornick to become a leader in the new Foundation.\n\n===\"The Encyclopedists\"===\n\"The Encyclopedists\" was originally published in the May, 1942 issue of ''[[Astounding Science-Fiction]]'' under the title of \"Foundation\". The story begins in 50 F.E. on Terminus, which has almost no mineral resources. There is one region suitable for the development of a large city, named Terminus City. The colony of professionals, devoted to the creation of the Encyclopedia Galactica, is managed by the Board of Trustees of the Encyclopedia Galactica Foundation, composed solely of scientists, called the Encyclopedists. The affairs of Terminus City itself are handled by the city's first Mayor, Salvor Hardin, who is a political figurehead and virtually powerless due to the influence of the Board of Trustees.{{efn-lr|Hardin, wanting to be a psychological engineer, had studied psychology under Bor Alurin, the only first-class psychologist included in the Foundation's original population, but as Alurin was careful never to teach more than the barest theory, of which Hardin had tired, and as Terminus had no facilities for psychological engineering, Hardin had instead gone into politics.}} However, Hardin refuses to accept the ''status quo,'' which he believes puts Terminus in danger of political exploitation by the four neighboring prefectures of the Empire, which have declared independence and severed contact with its capital, Trantor, and are now calling themselves \"The Four Kingdoms.\" Hardin manages to avoid an attempt by the Kingdom of Anacreon to establish military bases on Terminus and to take advantage of their nuclear power, which Terminus retains but which the Four Kingdoms do not. Hardin succeeds in diverting Anacreon from its initial goal and furthers his goal of the establishment of a stable political system on Terminus.\n\nHardin's efforts are still resisted by the Board of Trustees and its chairman, Dr. Lewis Pirenne, who erroneously believe they are protected by imperial decree. To remove this obstacle, Hardin and his chief advisor, Yohan Lee, plan a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" designed to remove the Board of Trustees from its politically powerful position on the same day that, in the city's Time Vault, a holographic recording of Hari Seldon is programmed to play. The recording will contain psychohistoric proof of Hardin's success or failure; Hardin realizes that his coup is a great gamble due to the possible case that his beliefs are incompatible with Seldon's original goals.\n\nThe next day in the Time Vault the holographic video of Hari Seldon in his wheelchair appears. He reveals that the Encyclopedia Galactica is actually a distraction intended to make the colony's creation possible. The true purpose of the Foundation is to form one nucleus of a Second Galactic Empire and shorten the predicted period of chaos to a mere thousand years, rather than thirty thousand years.\n\nAfter the video ends, the Encyclopedists admit, to Hardin, to having been wrong, and Pirenne schedules a meeting to discuss their next action. Hardin knew that this victory would give him the leverage he needed to gain significant power and thus \"assume actual government\" by removing the \"figurehead\" status from his Mayoral office. He also knew that Anacreon's forces would be arriving soon to forcibly take the Foundation. Salvor Hardin had guessed the solution, and as Hari Seldon said, \"it was obvious.\"\n\n===\"The Mayors\"===\n\"The Mayors\" was originally published in the June 1942 issue of ''Astounding Science-Fiction'' as \"Bridle and Saddle\" (referring to Aesop's fable \"[[The Horse that Lost its Liberty]]\", a variant of which is recited by Hardin during the climax of the story). By 80 F.E., the Foundation's scientific understanding has given it significant leverage over the Four Kingdoms, though it is still isolated from the Galactic Empire. Exercising its control over the region through an artificial religion, [[Scientism (Foundation)|Scientism]], the Foundation shares its technology with the Four Kingdoms while referring to it as religious truth. Maintenance technicians comprise Scientism's priesthood, trained on Terminus. A majority of the priests themselves are unaware of the true importance of their \"religion,\" referring to advanced technology as \"holy\" artifacts and tools. The religion is not suppressed by the secular elite of the Four Kingdoms, reminiscent of Western European rulers of the early medieval period, who use it to consolidate their power over the zealous populaces.\n\n[[Salvor Hardin]], as Mayor of Terminus City, is the effective ruler of the Foundation, and has been reelected as mayor continuously since his political victory over the ''Encyclopedia Galactica'' Board of Trustees. However, his influence is suddenly checked by a new political movement led by city councillor Sef Sermak, which encourages direct action against the Four Kingdoms and a cessation of the scientific proselytizing encouraged by Hardin's administration.  The movement, which calls itself \"The Actionist Party\" and whose followers refer to themselves as Actionists, is wildly popular, and Sermak and his fellow Actionist leaders refuse to respond to Hardin's efforts to appease them.\n\nThe kingdom that is most concerning to the Actionists is that of [[Anacreon (planet)|Anacreon]], ruled by Prince Regent Wienis and his nephew, the teenaged King Lepold I. Wienis plans to overthrow the Foundation's power by launching a direct military assault against Terminus, making use of an abandoned Imperial battlecruiser redesigned by Foundation experts to fit the needs of the elite Anacreonian navy. However, Hardin orders a few minor modifications to be incorporated into the ship's design prior to its completion.\n\nWienis plans to launch his offensive on the night of his nephew's coronation as king and sole ruler of Anacreon. Hardin attends the coronation ceremony and is arrested, but he has already arranged with Anacreonian High Priest Poly Verisof, who is aware of the true nature of Scientism and is also Terminus's Ambassador to Anacreon, to foster a popular uprising against Wienis. Convincing the Anacreonian populace that an assault against the Foundation and Terminus is blasphemous, Verisof leads an infuriated mob to the royal palace and surrounds it, demanding Hardin's release. Meanwhile, one of Hardin's modifications to the battlecruiser shows itself; an ultrawave relay, a remote kill-switch to the ship's systems. The priest-attendant of the ship, Theo Aporat, presents the relay's activation as a divine curse, and the crew, convinced of the Foundation's god's power, mutinies against its commander, Admiral Prince Lefkin, Wienis's son. Lefkin confronts the mutineers and, captured, is forced to broadcast a message to Anacreon demanding Wienis's arrest and threatening a bombardment of the royal palace if that and other demands are not met. Wienis, maddened by his failure, orders Hardin's execution, but his royal guardsmen refuse to obey him. Attempting and failing, due to a protective energy field, to kill Hardin personally, Wienis dies by suicide.\n\nHardin is proven correct again upon his return to Terminus City by another Seldon recording, set to play at this date. Though Actionists continue to hold a significant amount of power, enough now to control the City Council, an attempt to impeach the Mayor has already failed, and his popularity is renewed among the city's residents. It is also confirmed by Hari Seldon that the Foundation's immediate neighbors, the Four Kingdoms, will now be virtually powerless and incapable of resisting Scientism's advance. However, the growing nationalism of the fractured Periphery makes it hard for religion to make further conquests.\n\n===\"The Traders\"===\n\"The Traders\" was originally published in the October 1944 issue of ''Astounding Science-Fiction'' as \"The Wedge\". Circa 135 F.E., the Foundation has expanded and has sent out officially sanctioned Traders to exchange technology with neighboring planets for what amounts to greater political and economic power.  Master Trader Eskel Gorov, also an agent of the Foundation government, has travelled to the worlds of Askone, where he hopes to trade atomics.  Gorov, however, is met with resistance by Askone's governing Elders due to traditional taboos that effectively ban advanced technology.  Gorov is imprisoned and sentenced to death; the Elders refuse Foundation requests for clemency.\n\nTrader Linmar Ponyets is ordered by the Foundation to try to negotiate with the Elders, and travels to the central Askonian planet.  Ponyets meets with the Elders' Grand Master and deduces that, though he is determined to have Gorov executed, he may be willing to exchange the captive for a suitable bribe, which Ponyets realizes would be a sum of gold.  Ponyets clumsily fashions a transmuter that will convert iron into gold.  The Grand Master informs Ponyets that others who have attempted this have failed and have been punished with execution for both their attempt and for their failure; Ponyets succeeds and convinces the Grand Master that the gold is appropriate for Askonian religious decoration, which pleases the Elders.\n\nCouncilor Pherl, the Grand Master's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, appears to be wary of Ponyets.  Meeting with the Councilor, Ponyets discovers that Pherl is instead quite willing to work with him, if only due to the chances of eventually attaining the Grand Mastership himself.  Pherl, from a different ethnic background than traditional Grand Masters and a young man, believes that a stable supply of gold will be able to dramatically increase his power, and Ponyets sells him the transmuter. He also plants a video recorder inside, and, once Pherl tries to back out of paying the agreed price, blackmails him with a recording of the transmuter's use.\n\nGorov is released quickly. According to a new agreement, he and Ponyets can take as much tin from Pherl's mines as they can carry. Ponyets discusses his success with Gorov, and explains that now, Pherl is going to become the new Grand Master - and one very much interested in selling Foundation goods, since Ponyets left all his cargo with him, and making people buy it is the only way for Pherl to salvage some of his pride. Gorov criticizes his techniques due to what he perceives as Ponyets's lack of morality.  Ponyets replies by reminding Gorov of an alleged statement made by Salvor Hardin: \"Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right!\"\n\n===\"The Merchant Princes\"===\n\"The Merchant Princes\" was first published in the August 1944 issue of ''Astounding Science-Fiction'' as \"The Big and the Little\")\n\nCirca 155 F.E., the powerful Foundation has subjugated the neighboring Four Kingdoms and tries expanding its religious empire. However, due to rumors of the subjugation of the Four Kingdoms and, later, Askone, further expansion faces heavy resistance. Recently, three Foundation vessels have vanished near the planets of the Republic of Korell, thus the nation is suspected of either independent technological development or buying smuggled Foundation goods. Master Trader Hober Mallow is assigned to deal with Korell and also to investigate their technological developments and find the missing ships. Those who have assigned this mission to Mallow, Foreign Secretary Publis Manlio and Mayoral Secretary Jorane Sutt, believe that a Seldon Crisis is underway; they fear that domestic tensions caused by the great autonomy given to Traders and shaky foreign relations may give rise to a nuclear conflict involving the Foundation.\n\nSutt and Manlio, wanting to weaken the Traders and suspecting Mallow of being connected to the smugglers, plant an agent, Jaim Twer, who boasts of a lay education, aboard Mallow's ship, the ''Far Star.''{{efn-lr|Twer accidentally reveals himself to have, in reality, received a priestly education by proving to be ignorant of the nature of [[Seldon Crisis|Seldon Crises]].}} After the ''Far Star'' lands on Korell, the crew allows a Foundation missionary aboard the ship, in violation of orders Mallow has given that require his permission before anyone boards or leaves the ''Far Star''.\n\nKorellian law forbids Foundation missionaries to be on the planet under penalty of death. The crew determines that the Reverend Jord Parma of Anacreon (as he calls himself) had been captured by the Korellians but escaped before being killed. Rev. Parma is injured, apparently mentally confused, and in need of hospitalization. A short time after Parma has been let aboard the ship, an angry mob appears, surrounding the ''Far Star,'' and demanding that the missionary be turned over to them as an escaped criminal. This rapid response by the Korellians in what is an extremely remote location arouses Mallow's suspicions: Where did Parma actually escape from? Why was there a mob seemingly already gathered in the middle of nowhere? Suspecting a set-up, rather than fight the mob, Mallow decides to turn the missionary over to them (and to certain death), despite Twer's frantic attempt to intervene. Soon afterwards, Mallow is invited to meet with Korell's authoritarian ruler, Commdor (\"First Citizen Of The State\") Asper Argo (after several days of failure at securing such a meeting), indicating that Mallow had apparently passed a test by the Korellians by showing respect for their laws. Argo appears friendly and welcomes Foundation technological gifts; however, he refuses to allow Foundation missionaries on Korell, which turns out to coincide with Mallow's own interests.\n\nMallow, among other things, offers the Commdor tools for heavy industry, believing that will allow him to visit a factory, where the advanced technology would be found if Korell has it. He sees no signs of it, but does manage to catch a glimpse of the ruler's guards' weapons - atomic handguns bearing the markings of the Galactic Empire, which the Foundation assumes has fallen by this time. Mallow's discoveries lead him to believe that the Empire may be attempting to expand into the Periphery again, and has been providing weapons to client states such as Korell. Leaving the Republic and his ship, he journeys alone to the planet Siwenna, which he believes may be the capital of an Imperial province. He finds Siwenna a desolate and sad place, and meets the now-impoverished former patrician Onum Barr in the latter's isolated mansion, which is slowly crumbling. Barr, a former provincial senator and a leading citizen, had served in the Imperial government on Siwenna during a fairly stable time several decades earlier, before a series of corrupt and ambitious viceroys who each harbored dreams of becoming Emperor. After the previous viceroy rebelled against the Emperor, Barr participated in a revolution that overthrew the viceroy. However, the Imperial fleet also sent to remove the viceroy wanted to conquer a rebellious province even if it was no longer in rebellion, and began a massacre that claimed the lives of all but one of Barr's children. The new viceroy also plans a rebellion, but keeps a backup plan; fleeing into the Periphery and carving out a sizable realm there. He had secured a political alliance with Korell by marrying his daughter to Asper.\n\nMallow manages to tour a Siwennian power plant. He observes that the technicians can only maintain the plants, but cannot repair them. He also notes the nuclear generators are much bigger than those of Terminus. Both mean that the Empire cannot replace the goods Mallow sells to the Commdor. He also realizes that religion cannot make further conquests for the Foundation, but a commercial empire can.\n\nMallow is tried for murder approximately one year after his return to Terminus, due to turning over the Foundation missionary to the mob. However, he is able to produce a recording revealing to the court that the \"missionary\" was in fact a Korellian secret policeman. Acquitted, Mallow is received with delight by the population of Terminus, which (along with the wealth obtained by trading with Korell) all but ensures him the Mayor's seat in the elections scheduled to take place in the following year. To prepare for the election, Mallow engineers the arrest of Sutt and Manlio, suspecting them (rightly) of intending to engineer a coup with the aid of the Four Kingdoms' religious elements, and eventually takes office. However, he is soon faced with tensions between the Foundation and Korell, which declares war on the Foundation, using its powerful Imperial flotilla to attack Foundation ships. But instead of counterattacking, Mallow takes no action, effectively imposing an embargo on Korell, and waiting until the lack of Foundation goods forces Korell to surrender, which it does. Due to Mallow's control over industry and trade, The Foundation starts to become a [[Plutocracy]]. When one of his allies, horrified, asks why Mallow is not building towards a future empire Mallow replies it was only his job to stop the current crisis and history would take care of the ones to come.\n\n==Characters==\n===\"The Psychohistorians\"===\n*[[Hari Seldon]], mathematician who develops [[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\n*[[Gaal Dornick]], mathematician and Seldon's biographer\n*Jerril, an agent of the Commission of Public Safety who watches Gaal Dornick\n*Linge Chen, chief commissioner of public safety, and judge of Seldon's trial\n*Lors Avakim, the lawyer appointed to defend Gaal Dornick\n\n===\"The Encyclopedists\"===\n*[[Salvor Hardin]], First Mayor of Terminus \n*Anselm haut Rodric, soldier and Envoy from [[List of Foundation universe planets#Anacreon|Anacreon]] to Terminus\n*Bor Alurin, Trantorian psychologist who trained Salvor Hardin\n*Jord Fara, Member of the Board of Trustees of the Encyclopedia Committee\n*Lewis Pirenne, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Encyclopedia Committee\n*Lundin Crast, Member of the Board of Trustees of the Encyclopedia Committee\n*Lord Dorwin, Chancellor of the Empire\n*Tomaz Sutt, Member of the Board of Trustees of the Encyclopedia Committee\n*Yate Fulham, Member of the Board of Trustees of the Encyclopedia Committee\n\n===\"The Mayors\"===\n*Dokor Walto, Foundation Action Party activist\n*Jaim Orsy, Foundation Action Party activist\n*[[King Lepold I]], King of Anacreon.\n*Lem Tarki, Foundation Action Party activist.\n*Levi Norast, Foundation Action Party activist.\n*Lewis Bort, Foundation Action Party activist\n*Prince Lefkin, Wienis's eldest son.\n*Prince Regent Wienis, Prince Regent of Anacreon, uncle of King Lepold I.\n*Poly Verisof, Foundation ambassador and High Priest on Anacreon.\n*Salvor Hardin, First Mayor of Terminus.\n*Sef Sermak, Terminus City Councilor.\n*Theo Aporat, head priest on Anacreon's flagship ''Wienis''.\n*Yohan Lee, organizer of Salvor Hardin's coup and close confidante of Hardin.\n\n===\"The Traders\"===\n*[[List of Foundation series characters#Eskel Gorov|Eskel Gorov]], Master Trader and Foundation agent sentenced to death on Askone\n*[[List of Foundation series characters#Linmar Ponyets|Linmar Ponyets]], Master Trader, liberates Gorov in exchange for a transmuter.\n*[[List of Foundation series characters#Eskel Gorov|Les Gorm]], Master Trader and knows Linmar Ponyets from trading.\n\n===\"The Merchant Princes\"===\n*[[Hober Mallow]], Master Trader and first of the Merchant Princes.\n*[[List of Foundation series characters#Publis Manlio|Publis Manlio]], Foreign Secretary of the Foundation.\n*[[List of Foundation series characters#Jorane Sutt|Jorane Sutt]], Secretary to the Mayor of the Foundation.\n*[[List of Foundation series characters#Jaim Twer|Jaim Twer]], Foundation agent planted on Mallow's ship.\n\n==Reception==\nReviewer [[Groff Conklin]] declared ''Foundation'' \"a book of real intellectual entertainment and adventure.\"<ref >\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf,\" [[Galaxy Science Fiction]], February 1952, p.86.</ref> [[Anthony Boucher|Boucher]] and [[J.

It is the first  published in his  ''Foundation Trilogy'' (later expanded into [[The Foundation Series|the ''Foundation'' Series]]). ''Foundation'' is a cycle of five interrelated short stories, first published as a single book by [[Gnome Press]] in 1951. Collectively they tell the early story of the Foundation, an institute founded by psychohistorian Hari Seldon to preserve the best of galactic civilization after the collapse of the Galactic Empire.\n\n==Origin and early publication history==\nFour of the five stories had been earlier published in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' between 1942 and 1944 under different titles. A fifth part, the first in terms of fictional chronology, was added for the 1951 Gnome Press edition.  The original four stories also appeared in 1955 as part of [[List of Ace double novels|Ace Double's novel series]] as D-110 under the title '''''The 1,000-Year Plan'''''.\n\nTwo further books, each consisting of two novellas, were published shortly after and the three are considered a trilogy. Asimov would write two further sequel novels and two prequels. Later writers have written new additions authorized by Asimov's estate. The ''Foundation'' Series is often regarded as one of Isaac Asimov's best works, alongside his [[Robot series (Asimov)|''Robot'' series]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Background==\nOn 1 August 1941 [[Isaac Asimov]] proposed to [[John W. Campbell]] of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' that he write a short story set in a slowly declining Galactic Empire, based on the [[fall of the Roman Empire]]. Campbell liked the idea, and by the end of a two-hour meeting Asimov planned to write a series of stories depicting the fall of the first Galactic Empire and the rise of the second. Asimov submitted the first \"Foundation\" story on 8 September, Campbell purchased it on 15 September, and ''Astounding'' published it in May 1942. Asimov wrote seven more stories over eight years, and they were collected into [[Foundation trilogy|''The Foundation Trilogy'']]. Published from 1951 to 1953, the three books became Asimov's most popular science fiction and won a [[Hugo Award]] for Best All-Time Series in 1966.<ref name=\"earlyyears383_387\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/384/mode/2up |title=The early Asimov; or, Eleven years of trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City NY |pages=383\u2013387}}</ref>\n\n==Plot summary==\n===\"The Psychohistorians\"===\nThis part is original to the 1951 book version and takes place in 0 F.E. (\"Foundation Era\"). The story begins on [[Trantor]], the capital of the 12,000-year-old [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]], a powerful but slowly decaying empire. [[Hari Seldon]], a mathematician and psychologist, has developed [[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]], a new field of science and psychology that equates all possibilities in large societies to mathematics, allowing for the prediction of future events.\n\nBy means of psychohistory, Seldon has discovered the declining nature of the Empire, angering the aristocratic members of the Committee of Public Safety, the ''de facto'' rulers of the Empire.  The Committee considers Seldon's views and statements treasonous, and he is arrested along with young mathematician [[Gaal Dornick]], who has arrived on Trantor to meet Seldon.  Seldon is tried by the Committee and defends his beliefs, explaining his theories and predictions, including his belief that the Empire will collapse in 500 years and enter a 30,000-year dark age.  He informs the Committee that an alternative to this future is attainable, and explains to them that creating a compendium of all human knowledge, the ''[[Encyclopedia Galactica]]'', would not avert the inevitable fall of the Empire but would reduce the dark age to one millennium.\n\nThe skeptical Committee, not wanting to make Seldon a martyr, offers him exile to a remote world, [[Terminus (planet)|Terminus]], with others who could help him create the ''Encyclopedia''.  He accepts their offer, prepares for the departure of the \"Encyclopedists\" and receives an imperial decree officially acknowledging his actions. Seldon informs Dornick that despite the Empire believing they won by exiling Seldon the outcome was exactly what he had hoped would happen. Terminus would be the home of the first Foundation while a second would be established \"at Star's End.\" Seldon further announces he's dying and implores Dornick to become a leader in the new Foundation.\n\n===\"The Encyclopedists\"===\n\"The Encyclopedists\" was originally published in the May, 1942 issue of ''[[Astounding Science-Fiction]]'' under the title of \"Foundation\". The story begins in 50 F.E. on Terminus, which has almost no mineral resources. There is one region suitable for the development of a large city, named Terminus City. The colony of professionals, devoted to the creation of the Encyclopedia Galactica, is managed by the Board of Trustees of the Encyclopedia Galactica Foundation, composed solely of scientists, called the Encyclopedists. The affairs of Terminus City itself are handled by the city's first Mayor, Salvor Hardin, who is a political figurehead and virtually powerless due to the influence of the Board of Trustees.{{efn-lr|Hardin, wanting to be a psychological engineer, had studied psychology under Bor Alurin, the only first-class psychologist included in the Foundation's original population, but as Alurin was careful never to teach more than the barest theory, of which Hardin had tired, and as Terminus had no facilities for psychological engineering, Hardin had instead gone into politics.}} However, Hardin refuses to accept the ''status quo,'' which he believes puts Terminus in danger of political exploitation by the four neighboring prefectures of the Empire, which have declared independence and severed contact with its capital, Trantor, and are now calling themselves \"The Four Kingdoms.\" Hardin manages to avoid an attempt by the Kingdom of Anacreon to establish military bases on Terminus and to take advantage of their nuclear power, which Terminus retains but which the Four Kingdoms do not. Hardin succeeds in diverting Anacreon from its initial goal and furthers his goal of the establishment of a stable political system on Terminus.\n\nHardin's efforts are still resisted by the Board of Trustees and its chairman, Dr. Lewis Pirenne, who erroneously believe they are protected by imperial decree. To remove this obstacle, Hardin and his chief advisor, Yohan Lee, plan a \"coup d'\u00e9tat\" designed to remove the Board of Trustees from its politically powerful position on the same day that, in the city's Time Vault, a holographic recording of Hari Seldon is programmed to play. The recording will contain psychohistoric proof of Hardin's success or failure; Hardin realizes that his coup is a great gamble due to the possible case that his beliefs are incompatible with Seldon's original goals.\n\nThe next day in the Time Vault the holographic video of Hari Seldon in his wheelchair appears. He reveals that the Encyclopedia Galactica is actually a distraction intended to make the colony's creation possible. The true purpose of the Foundation is to form one nucleus of a Second Galactic Empire and shorten the predicted period of chaos to a mere thousand years, rather than thirty thousand years.\n\nAfter the video ends, the Encyclopedists admit, to Hardin, to having been wrong, and Pirenne schedules a meeting to discuss their next action. Hardin knew that this victory would give him the leverage he needed to gain significant power and thus \"assume actual government\" by removing the \"figurehead\" status from his Mayoral office. He also knew that Anacreon's forces would be arriving soon to forcibly take the Foundation. Salvor Hardin had guessed the solution, and as Hari Seldon said, \"it was obvious.\"\n\n===\"The Mayors\"===\n\"The Mayors\" was originally published in the June 1942 issue of ''Astounding Science-Fiction'' as \"Bridle and Saddle\" (referring to Aesop's fable \"[[The Horse that Lost its Liberty]]\", a variant of which is recited by Hardin during the climax of the story). By 80 F.E., the Foundation's scientific understanding has given it significant leverage over the Four Kingdoms, though it is still isolated from the Galactic Empire. Exercising its control over the region through an artificial religion, [[Scientism (Foundation)|Scientism]], the Foundation shares its technology with the Four Kingdoms while referring to it as religious truth. Maintenance technicians comprise Scientism's priesthood, trained on Terminus. A majority of the priests themselves are unaware of the true importance of their \"religion,\" referring to advanced technology as \"holy\" artifacts and tools. The religion is not suppressed by the secular elite of the Four Kingdoms, reminiscent of Western European rulers of the early medieval period, who use it to consolidate their power over the zealous populaces.\n\n[[Salvor Hardin]], as Mayor of Terminus City, is the effective ruler of the Foundation, and has been reelected as mayor continuously since his political victory over the ''Encyclopedia Galactica'' Board of Trustees. However, his influence is suddenly checked by a new political movement led by city councillor Sef Sermak, which encourages direct action against the Four Kingdoms and a cessation of the scientific proselytizing encouraged by Hardin's administration.  The movement, which calls itself \"The Actionist Party\" and whose followers refer to themselves as Actionists, is wildly popular, and Sermak and his fellow Actionist leaders refuse to respond to Hardin's efforts to appease them.\n\nThe kingdom that is most concerning to the Actionists is that of [[Anacreon (planet)|Anacreon]], ruled by Prince Regent Wienis and his nephew, the teenaged King Lepold I. Wienis plans to overthrow the Foundation's power by launching a direct military assault against Terminus, making use of an abandoned Imperial battlecruiser redesigned by Foundation experts to fit the needs of the elite Anacreonian navy. However, Hardin orders a few minor modifications to be incorporated into the ship's design prior to its completion.\n\nWienis plans to launch his offensive on the night of his nephew's coronation as king and sole ruler of Anacreon. Hardin attends the coronation ceremony and is arrested, but he has already arranged with Anacreonian High Priest Poly Verisof, who is aware of the true nature of Scientism and is also Terminus's Ambassador to Anacreon, to foster a popular uprising against Wienis. Convincing the Anacreonian populace that an assault against the Foundation and Terminus is blasphemous, Verisof leads an infuriated mob to the royal palace and surrounds it, demanding Hardin's release. Meanwhile, one of Hardin's modifications to the battlecruiser shows itself; an ultrawave relay, a remote kill-switch to the ship's systems. The priest-attendant of the ship, Theo Aporat, presents the relay's activation as a divine curse, and the crew, convinced of the Foundation's god's power, mutinies against its commander, Admiral Prince Lefkin, Wienis's son. Lefkin confronts the mutineers and, captured, is forced to broadcast a message to Anacreon demanding Wienis's arrest and threatening a bombardment of the royal palace if that and other demands are not met. Wienis, maddened by his failure, orders Hardin's execution, but his royal guardsmen refuse to obey him. Attempting and failing, due to a protective energy field, to kill Hardin personally, Wienis dies by suicide.\n\nHardin is proven correct again upon his return to Terminus City by another Seldon recording, set to play at this date. Though Actionists continue to hold a significant amount of power, enough now to control the City Council, an attempt to impeach the Mayor has already failed, and his popularity is renewed among the city's residents. It is also confirmed by Hari Seldon that the Foundation's immediate neighbors, the Four Kingdoms, will now be virtually powerless and incapable of resisting Scientism's advance. However, the growing nationalism of the fractured Periphery makes it hard for religion to make further conquests.\n\n===\"The Traders\"===\n\"The Traders\" was originally published in the October 1944 issue of ''Astounding Science-Fiction'' as \"The Wedge\". Circa 135 F.E., the Foundation has expanded and has sent out officially sanctioned Traders to exchange technology with neighboring planets for what amounts to greater political and economic power.  Master Trader Eskel Gorov, also an agent of the Foundation government, has travelled to the worlds of Askone, where he hopes to trade atomics.  Gorov, however, is met with resistance by Askone's governing Elders due to traditional taboos that effectively ban advanced technology.  Gorov is imprisoned and sentenced to death; the Elders refuse Foundation requests for clemency.\n\nTrader Linmar Ponyets is ordered by the Foundation to try to negotiate with the Elders, and travels to the central Askonian planet.  Ponyets meets with the Elders' Grand Master and deduces that, though he is determined to have Gorov executed, he may be willing to exchange the captive for a suitable bribe, which Ponyets realizes would be a sum of gold.  Ponyets clumsily fashions a transmuter that will convert iron into gold.  The Grand Master informs Ponyets that others who have attempted this have failed and have been punished with execution for both their attempt and for their failure; Ponyets succeeds and convinces the Grand Master that the gold is appropriate for Askonian religious decoration, which pleases the Elders.\n\nCouncilor Pherl, the Grand Master's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, appears to be wary of Ponyets.  Meeting with the Councilor, Ponyets discovers that Pherl is instead quite willing to work with him, if only due to the chances of eventually attaining the Grand Mastership himself.  Pherl, from a different ethnic background than traditional Grand Masters and a young man, believes that a stable supply of gold will be able to dramatically increase his power, and Ponyets sells him the transmuter. He also plants a video recorder inside, and, once Pherl tries to back out of paying the agreed price, blackmails him with a recording of the transmuter's use.\n\nGorov is released quickly. According to a new agreement, he and Ponyets can take as much tin from Pherl's mines as they can carry. Ponyets discusses his success with Gorov, and explains that now, Pherl is going to become the new Grand Master - and one very much interested in selling Foundation goods, since Ponyets left all his cargo with him, and making people buy it is the only way for Pherl to salvage some of his pride. Gorov criticizes his techniques due to what he perceives as Ponyets's lack of morality.  Ponyets replies by reminding Gorov of an alleged statement made by Salvor Hardin: \"Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right!\"\n\n===\"The Merchant Princes\"===\n\"The Merchant Princes\" was first published in the August 1944 issue of ''Astounding Science-Fiction'' as \"The Big and the Little\")\n\nCirca 155 F.E., the powerful Foundation has subjugated the neighboring Four Kingdoms and tries expanding its religious empire. However, due to rumors of the subjugation of the Four Kingdoms and, later, Askone, further expansion faces heavy resistance. Recently, three Foundation vessels have vanished near the planets of the Republic of Korell, thus the nation is suspected of either independent technological development or buying smuggled Foundation goods. Master Trader Hober Mallow is assigned to deal with Korell and also to investigate their technological developments and find the missing ships. Those who have assigned this mission to Mallow, Foreign Secretary Publis Manlio and Mayoral Secretary Jorane Sutt, believe that a Seldon Crisis is underway; they fear that domestic tensions caused by the great autonomy given to Traders and shaky foreign relations may give rise to a nuclear conflict involving the Foundation.\n\nSutt and Manlio, wanting to weaken the Traders and suspecting Mallow of being connected to the smugglers, plant an agent, Jaim Twer, who boasts of a lay education, aboard Mallow's ship, the ''Far Star.''{{efn-lr|Twer accidentally reveals himself to have, in reality, received a priestly education by proving to be ignorant of the nature of [[Seldon Crisis|Seldon Crises]].}} After the ''Far Star'' lands on Korell, the crew allows a Foundation missionary aboard the ship, in violation of orders Mallow has given that require his permission before anyone boards or leaves the ''Far Star''.\n\nKorellian law forbids Foundation missionaries to be on the planet under penalty of death. The crew determines that the Reverend Jord Parma of Anacreon (as he calls himself) had been captured by the Korellians but escaped before being killed. Rev. Parma is injured, apparently mentally confused, and in need of hospitalization. A short time after Parma has been let aboard the ship, an angry mob appears, surrounding the ''Far Star,'' and demanding that the missionary be turned over to them as an escaped criminal. This rapid response by the Korellians in what is an extremely remote location arouses Mallow's suspicions: Where did Parma actually escape from? Why was there a mob seemingly already gathered in the middle of nowhere? Suspecting a set-up, rather than fight the mob, Mallow decides to turn the missionary over to them (and to certain death), despite Twer's frantic attempt to intervene. Soon afterwards, Mallow is invited to meet with Korell's authoritarian ruler, Commdor (\"First Citizen Of The State\") Asper Argo (after several days of failure at securing such a meeting), indicating that Mallow had apparently passed a test by the Korellians by showing respect for their laws. Argo appears friendly and welcomes Foundation technological gifts; however, he refuses to allow Foundation missionaries on Korell, which turns out to coincide with Mallow's own interests.\n\nMallow, among other things, offers the Commdor tools for heavy industry, believing that will allow him to visit a factory, where the advanced technology would be found if Korell has it. He sees no signs of it, but does manage to catch a glimpse of the ruler's guards' weapons - atomic handguns bearing the markings of the Galactic Empire, which the Foundation assumes has fallen by this time. Mallow's discoveries lead him to believe that the Empire may be attempting to expand into the Periphery again, and has been providing weapons to client states such as Korell. Leaving the Republic and his ship, he journeys alone to the planet Siwenna, which he believes may be the capital of an Imperial province. He finds Siwenna a desolate and sad place, and meets the now-impoverished former patrician Onum Barr in the latter's isolated mansion, which is slowly crumbling. Barr, a former provincial senator and a leading citizen, had served in the Imperial government on Siwenna during a fairly stable time several decades earlier, before a series of corrupt and ambitious viceroys who each harbored dreams of becoming Emperor. After the previous viceroy rebelled against the Emperor, Barr participated in a revolution that overthrew the viceroy. However, the Imperial fleet also sent to remove the viceroy wanted to conquer a rebellious province even if it was no longer in rebellion, and began a massacre that claimed the lives of all but one of Barr's children. The new viceroy also plans a rebellion, but keeps a backup plan; fleeing into the Periphery and carving out a sizable realm there. He had secured a political alliance with Korell by marrying his daughter to Asper.\n\nMallow manages to tour a Siwennian power plant. He observes that the technicians can only maintain the plants, but cannot repair them. He also notes the nuclear generators are much bigger than those of Terminus. Both mean that the Empire cannot replace the goods Mallow sells to the Commdor. He also realizes that religion cannot make further conquests for the Foundation, but a commercial empire can.\n\nMallow is tried for murder approximately one year after his return to Terminus, due to turning over the Foundation missionary to the mob. However, he is able to produce a recording revealing to the court that the \"missionary\" was in fact a Korellian secret policeman. Acquitted, Mallow is received with delight by the population of Terminus, which (along with the wealth obtained by trading with Korell) all but ensures him the Mayor's seat in the elections scheduled to take place in the following year. To prepare for the election, Mallow engineers the arrest of Sutt and Manlio, suspecting them (rightly) of intending to engineer a coup with the aid of the Four Kingdoms' religious elements, and eventually takes office. However, he is soon faced with tensions between the Foundation and Korell, which declares war on the Foundation, using its powerful Imperial flotilla to attack Foundation ships. But instead of counterattacking, Mallow takes no action, effectively imposing an embargo on Korell, and waiting until the lack of Foundation goods forces Korell to surrender, which it does. Due to Mallow's control over industry and trade, The Foundation starts to become a Plutocracy. When one of his allies, horrified, asks why Mallow is not building towards a future empire Mallow replies it was only his job to stop the current crisis and history would take care of the ones to come.\n\n==Characters==\n===\"The Psychohistorians\"===\n*[[Hari Seldon]], mathematician who develops [[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\n*[[Gaal Dornick]], mathematician and Seldon's biographer\n*Jerril, an agent of the Commission of Public Safety who watches Gaal Dornick\n*Linge Chen, chief commissioner of public safety, and judge of Seldon's trial\n*Lors Avakim, the lawyer appointed to defend Gaal Dornick\n\n===\"The Encyclopedists\"===\n*[[Salvor Hardin]], First Mayor of Terminus \n*Anselm haut Rodric, soldier and Envoy from [[List of Foundation universe planets#Anacreon|Anacreon]] to Terminus\n*Bor Alurin, Trantorian psychologist who trained Salvor Hardin\n*Jord Fara, Member of the Board of Trustees of the Encyclopedia Committee\n*Lewis Pirenne, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Encyclopedia Committee\n*Lundin Crast, Member of the Board of Trustees of the Encyclopedia Committee\n*Lord Dorwin, Chancellor of the Empire\n*Tomaz Sutt, Member of the Board of Trustees of the Encyclopedia Committee\n*Yate Fulham, Member of the Board of Trustees of the Encyclopedia Committee\n\n===\"The Mayors\"===\n*Dokor Walto, Foundation Action Party activist\n*Jaim Orsy, Foundation Action Party activist\n*[[King Lepold I]], King of Anacreon.\n*Lem Tarki, Foundation Action Party activist.\n*Levi Norast, Foundation Action Party activist.\n*Lewis Bort, Foundation Action Party activist\n*Prince Lefkin, Wienis's eldest son.\n*Prince Regent Wienis, Prince Regent of Anacreon, uncle of King Lepold I.\n*Poly Verisof, Foundation ambassador and High Priest on Anacreon.\n*Salvor Hardin, First Mayor of Terminus.\n*Sef Sermak, Terminus City Councilor.\n*Theo Aporat, head priest on Anacreon's flagship ''Wienis''.\n*Yohan Lee, organizer of Salvor Hardin's coup and close confidante of Hardin.\n\n===\"The Traders\"===\n*[[List of Foundation series characters#Eskel Gorov|Eskel Gorov]], Master Trader and Foundation agent sentenced to death on Askone\n*[[List of Foundation series characters#Linmar Ponyets|Linmar Ponyets]], Master Trader, liberates Gorov in exchange for a transmuter.\n*[[List of Foundation series characters#Eskel Gorov|Les Gorm]], Master Trader and knows Linmar Ponyets from trading.\n\n===\"The Merchant Princes\"===\n*[[Hober Mallow]], Master Trader and first of the Merchant Princes.\n*[[List of Foundation series characters#Publis Manlio|Publis Manlio]], Foreign Secretary of the Foundation.\n*[[List of Foundation series characters#Jorane Sutt|Jorane Sutt]], Secretary to the Mayor of the Foundation.\n*[[List of Foundation series characters#Jaim Twer|Jaim Twer]], Foundation agent planted on Mallow's ship.\n\n==Reception==\nReviewer [[Groff Conklin]] declared ''Foundation'' \"a book of real intellectual entertainment and adventure.\"<ref >\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf,\" [[Galaxy Science Fiction]], February 1952, p.86.</ref> [[Anthony Boucher|Boucher]] and [[J.

Shumate of Sparta, is running for the 2020 District Court judgeship now held by Judge Jeanie Houston of Hamptonville due to the Judge's relinquishment of position.<sup>[5]</sup>\u00a0 It should be an easy race when the incumbent steps down willingly, so Ms. Shumate might have a better chance at winning the race (unlike when she ran unsuccessfully in 2014 against current Judge Crumpton<sup>[6]</sup>). \u00a0Ms. Shumate has similarly to employing persons to her elusive businesses, knowingly and voluntarily outsourced her campaign advertisement to companies outside of the Alleghany County area.<sup>[7]</sup>\u00a0 When Ms. Shumate couldn't garner enough support for her campaign from the locals she is supposed to be serving as a potential future judge, she enlisted the help of the county's Republican Party and financed the majority of her campaign advertising herself.[3]\n----[1] <nowiki>https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2020/01/20/n-c-gives-away-radon-test-kits/</nowiki>\n\n[2] <nowiki>https://www.wataugademocrat.com/news/apphealthcare-continues-fight-against-opioid-abuse-with-new-grant/article_01e48a68-8980-58dd-948a-b9aaa082b4ac.html</nowiki>\n\n[3] \n\n[4] <nowiki>http://fosteringcourtimprovement.org/nc/County/Alleghany/incare_charts.html</nowiki>\n\n[5] <nowiki>https://www.journalpatriot.com/news/file-for-county-commissioner-for-school-board/article_2ee502ba-2366-11ea-ab5f-4bc2856e079d.html</nowiki>\n\n[6] <nowiki>https://ballotpedia.org/Donna_L._Shumate</nowiki>\n\n[7] <nowiki>https://www.journalpatriot.com/news/third-quarter-candidate-spending-reports-given/article_864abc4a-6127-11e4-8891-001a4bcf6878.html</nowiki>{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1859 establishments in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Alleghany County, North Carolina| ]]\n[[Category:Counties of Appalachia]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1859]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Piney Creek Methodist Church.jpg|thumb|Piney Creek Methodist Church\nPiney Creek, NC \n]]\n\n'''Alleghany''' {{IPAc-en|\u00e6|l|\u026a|'|g|e\u026a|n|i\u02d0|}}<ref name=\"North Carolina Collection\">[http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/ref/resources/tlth.html  Talk Like A Tarheel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622041633/http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/ref/resources/tlth.html |date=2013-06-22 }}, from the North Carolina Collection website at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].

Shumate of Sparta, is running for the 2020 District Court judgeship now held by Judge Jeanie Houston of Hamptonville due to the Judge\u2019s relinquishment of position.<sup>[5]</sup>\u00a0 It should be an easy race when the incumbent steps down willingly, so Ms. Shumate might have a better chance at winning the race (unlike when she ran unsuccessfully in 2014 against current Judge Crumpton<sup>[6]</sup>). \u00a0Ms. Shumate has similarly to employing persons to her elusive businesses, knowingly and voluntarily outsourced her campaign advertisement to companies outside of the Alleghany County area.<sup>[7]</sup>\u00a0 When Ms. Shumate couldn\u2019t garner enough support for her campaign from the locals she is supposed to be serving as a potential future judge, she enlisted the help of the county\u2019s Republican Party and financed the majority of her campaign advertising herself.[3]\n----[1] <nowiki>https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2020/01/20/n-c-gives-away-radon-test-kits/</nowiki>\n\n[2] <nowiki>https://www.wataugademocrat.com/news/apphealthcare-continues-fight-against-opioid-abuse-with-new-grant/article_01e48a68-8980-58dd-948a-b9aaa082b4ac.html</nowiki>\n\n[3] \n\n[4] <nowiki>http://fosteringcourtimprovement.org/nc/County/Alleghany/incare_charts.html</nowiki>\n\n[5] <nowiki>https://www.journalpatriot.com/news/file-for-county-commissioner-for-school-board/article_2ee502ba-2366-11ea-ab5f-4bc2856e079d.html</nowiki>\n\n[6] <nowiki>https://ballotpedia.org/Donna_L._Shumate</nowiki>\n\n[7] <nowiki>https://www.journalpatriot.com/news/third-quarter-candidate-spending-reports-given/article_864abc4a-6127-11e4-8891-001a4bcf6878.html</nowiki>{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1859 establishments in North Carolina]]\n[[Category:Alleghany County, North Carolina| ]]\n[[Category:Counties of Appalachia]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1859]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: couldn\u2019t \u2192 couldn't, January of 2020 \u2192 January 2020, \u2019s \u2192 's (2), 1893-1897 \u2192 1893\u20131897", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alleghany_County,_North_Carolina"}

The district headquarters is located at Alappuzha.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Alleppey canal.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Walkway in Commercial Canal]]\nIn the early first decade of the 20th century the [[Viceroy]] of the Indian Empire, [[Lord Curzon]] made a visit in the State to [[Alleppey]], now Alappuzha. Fascinated by the scenic beauty of the place, he exclaimed, {{Quotation|Here nature has spent up on the land her richest bounties.  Alleppey, ''the Venice of the East''.<ref>[http://www.alappuzha.nic.in/aboutalpy/history.htm \"History\", ''Allapuzha, the Venice of the East,'' alappuzha.nic.in] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115143331/http://www.alappuzha.nic.in/aboutalpy/history.htm |date=15 January 2014 }}</ref>}}\n[[Kuttanad]], the [[breadbasket|rice bowl]] of Kerala, with its paddy fields, small streams and canals with lush green coconut palms, was well known even from the early periods of the [[Sangam age]].<ref>[http://www.alappuzha.com/kuttanad.htm Kuttanad]</ref> History says Alappuzha had trade relations with [[Greece]] and Rome in the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nThe early [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]], who had their home in Kuttanad, were called `Kuttuvans`, so named after this place. Pliny and Ptolemy of the 1st and 2nd centuries had mentioned places like Purakkad or Barace in their classical works.\n\nLiterary works like \"[[Unnuneeli Sandesam]]\" give some insight into the ancient period of this district. Archaeological antiquities, such as the stone inscriptions, historical monuments found in the temples, churches, and rock-cut caves, also emphasise the historic importance of Alappuzha District. Christianity had a foothold in this district, even from the 1st century AD. The church located at [[Kokkamangalam]] was one of the seven churches founded by [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]],{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  one of the twelve disciples of [[Jesus Christ]]. It is generally believed that he landed at [[Maliankara]] in [[Muziris]] Port, presently known as [[Cranganore]] or [[Kodungallur]], in 52 AD and preached Christianity in [[South India]].\n\nThe district flourished in religion and culture under the second Chera Empire, during 9th to 12th centuries AD. The literary work, `Ascharya Choodamani`, a Sanskrit drama written by [[Sakthibhadran]], a scholar of [[Chengannur]], enables us to know many pertinent facts. Further, the temple on Lord [[Ayyappan]], in Mukkal vattam near Muhamma in Alappuzha District, is called [[Cheerappanchira]], for the Kalari from which Lord Ayyappa learnt his martial arts. A recent album by [[P. Unni Krishnan]] on Lord Ayyappa, titled 'Sabarimalai Va Charanam Solli Va', has songs illustrating the history of this temple and Lord Ayyappa's stay here before he went to conquer the Mahishi Demon.<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/swamiyae-saranam-aiyappa/article4146859.ece Mukkal Vattam in Muhamma ]</ref>\n\nSince landing in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] in 1498, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] started playing an influential role in Alappuzha. They began by spreading Catholicism and converting already existing [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christians]] into Catholics. The famous [[Arthunkal#St. Andrew's Basilica, Arthunkal|St. Andrew's Basilica]] was built by them during this period.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://arthunkal.bizhat.com/arthunkal_church_history.html | publisher=Arthunkal Church | title=Arthunkal Church history}}</ref> In the 17th century, as the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] power declined, the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] gained a predominant position in the principalities of this district. They built many factories and warehouses for storing [[Black pepper|pepper]] and [[ginger]], relying on several treaties signed between the Dutch and the [[Rajas]] of [[Purakkad]], [[Kayamkulam]] and Karappuram. In course of time they also delved into the political and cultural affairs of the district. At that time Maharaja [[Marthanda Varma]] (1706\u20131758), who was the 'Maker of modern [[Travancore]]', intervened in the political affairs of those princedoms.\n\nTravancore [[Dewan]] [[Ramayyan Dalawa]] (d. 1756) resided in [[Mavelikkara]] where he had a palace built by Marthanda Varma. After the death of his wife, Ramayyan consorted with a Nair lady from Mavelikkara of the Edassery family (PGN Unnithan, a member of this family, later became the last Dewan of Travancore in 1947). After his death Ramayyan's descendants left Travancore to settle in [[Pudukkottai]] in Tamil Nadu. His Nair consort was given gifts and presents and special allowances from the Travancore government in recognition of his services to the state while his own descendants were bestowed with the honorific title of Dalawa.\n\nIn the 19th century the district saw progress in many spheres. One of the five subordinate courts opened in the state in connection with the reorganisation of the judicial system by Colonel [[George Monro (British Army officer)|George Monro]] was located at [[Mavelikkara]]. The first post office and first telegraph office in the former Travancore state were established in this district. The first manufacturing factory for the [[coir]] mats was established in 1859. In 1894 the city Improvement Committee was set up.\n\nThe district played a role in the freedom struggle of the country. The struggles of Punnapra and Vayalar in 1946 arrayed the people against Sir [[C. P. Ramaswami Iyer]], who was Dewan of Travancore. This led to Ramaswami Iyer's exit from the political scene of Travancore. A popular Ministry was formed in Travancore on 24 March 1948 after India's independence.  Travancore and [[Cochin]] states were integrated on 1 July 1949. This arrangement continued until the formation of Kerala State on 1 November 1956, under the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|States Reorganisation Act 1956]]. The district came into existence as a separate administrative unit on 1 August 1957.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Boating centre.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Boating center in Sea view canal]]\nAlappuzha is located at {{Coord|9.54|N|76.40|E|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/13/Alappuzha.html |title=Maps, Weather, Videos, and Airports for Alappuzha, India |publisher=Fallingrain.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-25}}</ref>  The average elevation is {{convert|1|m|ft}}<ref>[http://population.mongabay.com/population/india/1278985/alleppey elevation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116031902/http://population.mongabay.com/population/india/1278985/alleppey |date=16 November 2011 }}</ref>\nAlappuzha covers an area of {{convert|1414|km2}} and is flanked by {{convert|2195|km2}} of [[Vembanad Lake]], where six major rivers spread out before joining the 80&nbsp;km coast line of the district. The city of Alappuzha is crisscrossed by a system of [[canals]], which is a part of the [[National Waterway 3 (India)]].<ref>[http://ecohouseboat.com/National_Waterways-3.php National waterway 3]</ref>\n\nThe district is a sandy strip of land intercepted by lagoons, rivers and canals. There are no mountains or hills in the district except some scattered hillocks lying between [[Bharanikkavu]] and [[Chengannur]] blocks in the eastern portion of the district. There are no forest area in this district.\n\nAlappuzha is bounded by the [[Laccadive Sea]] on its west. The town has a network of lakes, lagoons and [[fresh water]] rivers. The richness of the coastal Alappuzha waters is expressed annually in the blooming and consequent deposit of a huge quantity of fishes and [[prawns]] on the Alappuzha coast called \u2018[Chakara]\u2019. This annual shifting of sandbank appears during the post-monsoon period and contributes to the local economy and is a festive season for the people of Kerala. The annual floods rejuvenate and cleanse the soil and water due to which there is abundance of marine life like prawns, [[lobsters]], fishes, turtles, and other [[flora]] in the sea.\n\nThe [[Kerala Backwaters|backwaters]] and [[wetlands]] host thousands of migrant [[common teal]], [[ducks]] and [[cormorants]] every year who reach here from long distances. A major feature of the area is the region called [[Kuttanad]], the 'granary of Kerala'. Kuttanad is also known as the rice bowl of Kerala and is one of the few places in the world where farming is done below sea level. The paddy fields lie about 0.6 to 2 m below mean sea level.<ref>[http://www.alappuzha.com/kuttanad.htm Kuttanad1]</ref>\n\n=== Climate ===\nOwing to its proximity to the sea, the climate of Alappuzha is humid and hot during the summer, although it remains fairly cool and pleasant during the months of October and November.  The average monthly temperature is 27 degree Celsius. The district gets the benefit of two seasonal monsoons, as in other parts of the state. Alappuzha town experiences a long monsoon season with heavy showers as both the [[Southwest monsoon]] and [[Northeast monsoon]] influences the weather of Alappuzha. The South-west monsoon affects the climate in the months from June to September. On the other hand, the North-east monsoon brings rain from October to November. The average rainfall received by the region is 2763&nbsp;mm.<ref>[http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/annualrainfall.htm rainfall]</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n| location = Alappuzha (1981\u20132010,

This is mainly due to the presence of houseboats that provide the tourists with a view of the scenic backwaters of the town. Another reason is the proximity to other tourist spots like [[Munnar]], [[Varkala]], Alappuzha and [[Wayanad]].\n\n== Backwater paddy cultivation (Kayal cultivation) ==\n[[Image:Kerala Kuttanad2.jpg|thumb|Paddy fields in Kuttanad]]\nThe major occupation in Alappuzha is farming. The Rice Bowl of Kerala, Kuttanadu is located in Alappuzha. Large farming areas near [[Vembanad Lake]] were reclaimed from the lake. In earlier times, the reclamation was done mainly from the shallow part of the [[Vembanad Lake]] or from the periphery of river Pamba. These reclamations constituted small areas of paddy fields called ''Padsekharam''. The bailing out of water from those fields were done manually using water wheels (''Chakram''). Gradually the manual method used for bailing out of water gave way to steam engines.\n\nThree stages can be identified in the reclamation of lands from the Vembanad Lake. In the first stage it was carried out by private entrepreneurs without any financial support from the part of the government. The ''Pattom Proclamation'', made by the Travancore Kingdom in the year 1865, gave a great boost to the reclamation activities between 1865 and 1890. During this period de-watering of the polders were done manually, using waterwheels, restricting large-scale reclamations. Only about 250 hectares of land were reclaimed during this period. Venadu Lake and Madathil Lake that were reclaimed during this period are considered as the first ''Kayal Nilam'' (lake-reclaimed land) which were reclaimed from Vembanad Lake.<ref>{{cite news\n |author=M.S.

It made the farmers consider venturing into the deeper parts of the lake. During the period between 1898 and 1903, reclamation activity was led by [[Pallithanam Luka Mathai]] (alias Pallithanathu Mathaichen) who reclaimed the [[Cherukara Kayal]] and [[Pallithanam Moovayiram Kayal]]. Houseboat is one among the main attraction of Alappuzha.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://itraveller.com/blog/alappuzha-tourist-places-alappuzha-tourism-alappuzha-houseboat/\n | title=Alappuzha tourist places\n\n }}</ref>\n\nThe second phase (1890 to 1903) of reclamation activities came to a halt because of the ban on lake reclamation imposed by the Madras Government in 1903. Cherukali Kayal, Rama Rajapuram Kayal, Aarupanku Kayal, Pantharndu Panku kayal and Mathi Kayal were the other major reclamations during this period.\n\nIn 1912, the Madras Government approved a proposal from the Travencore Government for further reclamations in three stages. Under this reclamation scheme areas were notified for reclamation in blocks each named by an alphabet letter. Out of the total area of 19,500 acres of reclaimed land 12,000 acres were reclaimed between 1913 and 1920. The reclamations between 1914 and 1920 are known as new reclamations, which were carried out in three periods. In the first period Blocks A to G measuring 6300 Acres were reclaimed. C Block, D Block (Attumukham Aarayiram (Attumuttu Kayal), Thekke Aarayiram and Vadakke Aarayiram) and E Block (Erupathinalayiram Kayal) F Block (Judge's Aarayiram Kayal) and G Block (Kochu Kayal) are the major reclamations during this period.\n\nDuring the second period of new reclamation, blocks H to N measuring 3600 acres were reclaimed. During the third period of new reclamation, R Block measuring 1,400 acres were reclaimed.\n\nDue to the steep decline in the price of rice during 1920 to 1940, the reclamation activities became sluggish, but they gained momentum again in the early 1940s. During this period, in order to increase the agricultural output, government initiated a ''Grow More Food'' campaign and provided incentives to encourage new reclamations. The advent of electric motors made the reclamation easier, cheaper and less risky as compared to the earlier periods. The last tract of the reclamations namely Q, S and T block were made during this period.\n\n== Transport ==\n\n{{wide image|Pallathuruthi bridge pano small.jpg|1200px|align-cap=center| [[Pallathuruthy]] bridge}}\n\n=== Road ===\n==== National Highways ====\n\n[[National Highway 66 (India)]] is one of the longest national highway in India.

Fascinated by the scenic beauty of the place, he exclaimed, {{Quotation|Here nature has spent up on the land her richest bounties.

Pliny and Ptolemy of the 1st and 2nd centuries had mentioned places like Purakkad or Barace in their classical works.\n\nLiterary works like \"[[Unnuneeli Sandesam]]\" give some insight into the ancient period of this district. Archaeological antiquities, such as the stone inscriptions, historical monuments found in the temples, churches, and rock-cut caves, also emphasise the historic importance of Alappuzha District. Christianity had a foothold in this district, even from the 1st century AD. The church located at [[Kokkamangalam]] was one of the seven churches founded by [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]],{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}  one of the twelve disciples of [[Jesus Christ]]. It is generally believed that he landed at [[Maliankara]] in [[Muziris]] Port, presently known as [[Cranganore]] or [[Kodungallur]], in 52 AD and preached Christianity in [[South India]].\n\nThe district flourished in religion and culture under the second Chera Empire, during 9th to 12th centuries AD. The literary work, `Ascharya Choodamani`, a Sanskrit drama written by [[Sakthibhadran]], a scholar of [[Chengannur]], enables us to know many pertinent facts. Further, the temple on Lord [[Ayyappan]], in Mukkal vattam near Muhamma in Alappuzha District, is called [[Cheerappanchira]], for the Kalari from which Lord Ayyappa learnt his martial arts.

Unni Krishnan]] on Lord Ayyappa, titled 'Sabarimalai Va Charanam Solli Va', has songs illustrating the history of this temple and Lord Ayyappa's stay here before he went to conquer the Mahishi Demon.<ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/swamiyae-saranam-aiyappa/article4146859.ece Mukkal Vattam in Muhamma ]</ref>\n\nSince landing in [[Kozhikode|Calicut]] in 1498, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] started playing an influential role in Alappuzha. They began by spreading Catholicism and converting already existing [[Saint Thomas Christians|Christians]] into Catholics. The famous [[Arthunkal#St. Andrew's Basilica, Arthunkal|St. Andrew's Basilica]] was built by them during this period.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://arthunkal.bizhat.com/arthunkal_church_history.html | publisher=Arthunkal Church | title=Arthunkal Church history}}</ref> In the 17th century, as the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] power declined, the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] gained a predominant position in the principalities of this district. They built many factories and warehouses for storing [[Black pepper|pepper]] and [[ginger]], relying on several treaties signed between the Dutch and the [[Rajas]] of [[Purakkad]], [[Kayamkulam]] and Karappuram. In course of time they also delved into the political and cultural affairs of the district. At that time Maharaja [[Marthanda Varma]] (1706\u20131758), who was the 'Maker of modern [[Travancore]]', intervened in the political affairs of those princedoms.\n\nTravancore [[Dewan]] [[Ramayyan Dalawa]] (d. 1756) resided in [[Mavelikkara]] where he had a palace built by Marthanda Varma. After the death of his wife, Ramayyan consorted with a Nair lady from Mavelikkara of the Edassery family (PGN Unnithan, a member of this family, later became the last Dewan of Travancore in 1947). After his death Ramayyan's descendants left Travancore to settle in [[Pudukkottai]] in Tamil Nadu. His Nair consort was given gifts and presents and special allowances from the Travancore government in recognition of his services to the state while his own descendants were bestowed with the honorific title of Dalawa.\n\nIn the 19th century the district saw progress in many spheres. One of the five subordinate courts opened in the state in connection with the reorganisation of the judicial system by Colonel [[George Monro (British Army officer)|George Monro]] was located at [[Mavelikkara]]. The first post office and first telegraph office in the former Travancore state were established in this district. The first manufacturing factory for the [[coir]] mats was established in 1859. In 1894 the city Improvement Committee was set up.\n\nThe district played a role in the freedom struggle of the country. The struggles of Punnapra and Vayalar in 1946 arrayed the people against Sir [[C. P. Ramaswami Iyer]], who was Dewan of Travancore. This led to Ramaswami Iyer's exit from the political scene of Travancore. A popular Ministry was formed in Travancore on 24 March 1948 after India's independence.  Travancore and [[Cochin]] states were integrated on 1 July 1949. This arrangement continued until the formation of Kerala State on 1 November 1956, under the [[States Reorganisation Act, 1956|States Reorganisation Act 1956]]. The district came into existence as a separate administrative unit on 1 August 1957.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Boating centre.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Boating center in Sea view canal]]\nAlappuzha is located at {{Coord|9.54|N|76.40|E|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/13/Alappuzha.html |title=Maps, Weather, Videos, and Airports for Alappuzha, India |publisher=Fallingrain.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-25}}</ref>  The average elevation is {{convert|1|m|ft}}<ref>[http://population.mongabay.com/population/india/1278985/alleppey elevation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116031902/http://population.mongabay.com/population/india/1278985/alleppey |date=16 November 2011 }}</ref>\nAlappuzha covers an area of {{convert|1414|km2}} and is flanked by {{convert|2195|km2}} of [[Vembanad Lake]], where six major rivers spread out before joining the 80&nbsp;km coast line of the district. The city of Alappuzha is crisscrossed by a system of [[canals]], which is a part of the [[National Waterway 3 (India)]].<ref>[http://ecohouseboat.com/National_Waterways-3.php National waterway 3]</ref>\n\nThe district is a sandy strip of land intercepted by lagoons, rivers and canals. There are no mountains or hills in the district except some scattered hillocks lying between [[Bharanikkavu]] and [[Chengannur]] blocks in the eastern portion of the district. There are no forest area in this district.\n\nAlappuzha is bounded by the [[Laccadive Sea]] on its west. The town has a network of lakes, lagoons and [[fresh water]] rivers. The richness of the coastal Alappuzha waters is expressed annually in the blooming and consequent deposit of a huge quantity of fishes and [[prawns]] on the Alappuzha coast called \u2018[Chakara]\u2019. This annual shifting of sandbank appears during the post-monsoon period and contributes to the local economy and is a festive season for the people of Kerala. The annual floods rejuvenate and cleanse the soil and water due to which there is abundance of marine life like prawns, [[lobsters]], fishes, turtles, and other [[flora]] in the sea.\n\nThe [[Kerala Backwaters|backwaters]] and [[wetlands]] host thousands of migrant [[common teal]], [[ducks]] and [[cormorants]] every year who reach here from long distances. A major feature of the area is the region called [[Kuttanad]], the 'granary of Kerala'. Kuttanad is also known as the rice bowl of Kerala and is one of the few places in the world where farming is done below sea level. The paddy fields lie about 0.6 to 2 m below mean sea level.<ref>[http://www.alappuzha.com/kuttanad.htm Kuttanad1]</ref>\n\n=== Climate ===\nOwing to its proximity to the sea, the climate of Alappuzha is humid and hot during the summer, although it remains fairly cool and pleasant during the months of October and November.  The average monthly temperature is 27 degree Celsius. The district gets the benefit of two seasonal monsoons, as in other parts of the state. Alappuzha town experiences a long monsoon season with heavy showers as both the [[Southwest monsoon]] and [[Northeast monsoon]] influences the weather of Alappuzha. The South-west monsoon affects the climate in the months from June to September. On the other hand, the North-east monsoon brings rain from October to November. The average rainfall received by the region is 2763&nbsp;mm.<ref>[http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/annualrainfall.htm rainfall]</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n| location = Alappuzha (1981\u20132010,

This is mainly due to the presence of houseboats that provide the tourists with a view of the scenic backwaters of the town. Another reason is the proximity to other tourist spots like [[Munnar]], [[Varkala]], Alappuzha and [[Wayanad]].\n\n== Backwater paddy cultivation (Kayal cultivation) ==\n[[Image:Kerala Kuttanad2.jpg|thumb|Paddy fields in Kuttanad]]\nThe major occupation in Alappuzha is farming. The Rice Bowl of Kerala, Kuttanadu is located in Alappuzha. Large farming areas near [[Vembanad Lake]] were reclaimed from the lake. In earlier times, the reclamation was done mainly from the shallow part of the [[Vembanad Lake]] or from the periphery of river Pamba. These reclamations constituted small areas of paddy fields called ''Padsekharam''. The bailing out of water from those fields were done manually using water wheels (''Chakram''). Gradually the manual method used for bailing out of water gave way to steam engines.\n\nThree stages can be identified in the reclamation of lands from the Vembanad Lake. In the first stage it was carried out by private entrepreneurs without any financial support from the part of the government. The ''Pattom Proclamation'', made by the Travancore Kingdom in the year 1865, gave a great boost to the reclamation activities between 1865 and 1890. During this period de-watering of the polders were done manually, using waterwheels, restricting large-scale reclamations. Only about 250 hectares of land were reclaimed during this period. Venadu Lake and Madathil Lake that were reclaimed during this period are considered as the first ''Kayal Nilam'' (lake-reclaimed land) which were reclaimed from Vembanad Lake.<ref>{{cite news\n |author=M.S.

It made the farmers consider venturing into the deeper parts of the lake. During the period between 1898 and 1903, reclamation activity was led by [[Pallithanam Luka Mathai]] (alias Pallithanathu Mathaichen) who reclaimed the [[Cherukara Kayal]] and [[Pallithanam Moovayiram Kayal]]. Houseboat is one among the main attraction of Alappuzha.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://itraveller.com/blog/alappuzha-tourist-places-alappuzha-tourism-alappuzha-houseboat/\n | title=Alappuzha tourist places\n\n }}</ref>\n\nThe second phase (1890 to 1903) of reclamation activities came to a halt because of the ban on lake reclamation imposed by the Madras Government in 1903. Cherukali Kayal, Rama Rajapuram Kayal, Aarupanku Kayal, Pantharndu Panku kayal and Mathi Kayal were the other major reclamations during this period.\n\nIn 1912, the Madras Government approved a proposal from the Travencore Government for further reclamations in three stages. Under this reclamation scheme areas were notified for reclamation in blocks each named by an alphabet letter. Out of the total area of 19,500 acres of reclaimed land 12,000 acres were reclaimed between 1913 and 1920. The reclamations between 1914 and 1920 are known as new reclamations, which were carried out in three periods. In the first period Blocks A to G measuring 6300 Acres were reclaimed. C Block, D Block (Attumukham Aarayiram (Attumuttu Kayal), Thekke Aarayiram and Vadakke Aarayiram) and E Block (Erupathinalayiram Kayal) F Block (Judge's Aarayiram Kayal) and G Block (Kochu Kayal) are the major reclamations during this period.\n\nDuring the second period of new reclamation, blocks H to N measuring 3600 acres were reclaimed. During the third period of new reclamation, R Block measuring 1,400 acres were reclaimed.\n\nDue to the steep decline in the price of rice during 1920 to 1940, the reclamation activities became sluggish, but they gained momentum again in the early 1940s. During this period, in order to increase the agricultural output, government initiated a ''Grow More Food'' campaign and provided incentives to encourage new reclamations. The advent of electric motors made the reclamation easier, cheaper and less risky as compared to the earlier periods. The last tract of the reclamations namely Q, S and T block were made during this period.\n\n== Transport ==\n\n{{wide image|Pallathuruthi bridge pano small.jpg|1200px|align-cap=center| [[Pallathuruthy]] bridge}}\n\n=== Road ===\n==== National Highways ====\n\n[[National Highway 66 (India)]] is one of the longest national highway in India.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
