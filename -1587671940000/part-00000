It was the first and the largest Kuiper belt object to be discovered.\n\nPluto was discovered by [[Clyde Tombaugh]] in 1930 and declared to be the [[Planets beyond Neptune|ninth planet]] from the Sun. After 1992, its status as a [[planet]] was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt. In 2005, [[Eris_(dwarf_planet)|Eris]], a dwarf planet in the [[scattered disc]] which is 27% more massive than Pluto, was discovered. This led the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) to [[IAU definition of planet|define the term \"planet\"]] formally in 2006, during their 26th General Assembly. That definition excluded Pluto and reclassified it as a dwarf planet.\n\nIt is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the [[Sun]]. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small\u2014one-sixth the mass of the [[Moon]] and one-third its volume. It has a moderately [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 30 to 49&nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s or AU (4.4\u20137.4 billion&nbsp;km) from the Sun. This means that Pluto periodically comes closer to the Sun than [[Neptune]], but a stable [[orbital resonance]] with Neptune prevents them from colliding.  Light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average distance (39.5&nbsp;AU).\n\nPluto has [[moons of Pluto|five known moons]]: [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] (the largest, with a diameter just over half that of Pluto), [[Styx (moon)|Styx]], [[Nix (moon)|Nix]], [[Kerberos (moon)|Kerberos]], and [[Hydra (moon)|Hydra]]. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a [[binary system]] because the [[barycenter]] of their orbits does not lie within either body.\n\nThe ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft performed a [[planetary flyby|flyby]] of Pluto on July 14, 2015, becoming the first ever, and to date only, spacecraft to do so. During its brief flyby, ''New Horizons'' made detailed measurements and observations of Pluto and its moons. In September 2016, astronomers announced that the reddish-brown cap of the north pole of Charon is composed of [[tholin]]s, [[organic compound|organic]] [[macromolecule]]s that may be ingredients for the [[Abiogenesis|emergence of life]], and produced from [[methane]], [[nitrogen]] and other gases released from the [[atmosphere of Pluto]] and transferred {{convert|19,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the orbiting moon.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Discovery ===\n{{Further|Planets beyond Neptune}}\n[[File:Pluto discovery plates.png|left|thumb|alt=The same area of night sky with stars, shown twice, side by side.

Pickering]] had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for such a planet.<ref name=\"Hoyt\" /> Lowell and his observatory conducted his search until his death in 1916, but to no avail. Unknown to Lowell, his surveys had captured two faint images of Pluto on March 19 and April 7, 1915, but they were not recognized for what they were.<ref name=\"Hoyt\" /><ref name=\"Littman1990\" /> There are fourteen other known [[precovery]] observations, with the earliest made by the [[Yerkes Observatory]] on August 20, 1909.<ref name=\"BuchwaldDimarioWild2000\" />\n\nPercival's widow, Constance Lowell, entered into a ten-year legal battle with the Lowell Observatory over her husband's legacy, and the search for Planet X did not resume until 1929.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|p=50}} [[Vesto Melvin Slipher]], the observatory director, gave the job of locating Planet X to 23-year-old [[Clyde Tombaugh]], who had just arrived at the observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|p=50}}\n\nTombaugh's task was to systematically image the night sky in pairs of photographs, then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position. Using a [[blink comparator]], he rapidly shifted back and forth between views of each of the plates to create the illusion of movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs. On February 18, 1930, after nearly a year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates taken on January 23 and 29. A lesser-quality photograph taken on January 21 helped confirm the movement.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|p=52}} After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the [[Harvard College Observatory]] on March 13, 1930.<ref name=\"Hoyt\" /> Pluto has yet to complete a full orbit of the Sun since its discovery, as one Plutonian year is 247.68 years long.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geek.com/feature/11-awesome-facts-about-the-lovable-dwarf-planet-pluto-1629287/|title=11 awesome facts about Pluto that you probably don't know|date=2015-07-24|website=Geek.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Name ===\nThe discovery made headlines around the globe.<ref>For example: \"Ninth Planet Discovered on Edge of Solar System: First Found in 84 Years\".

Subsequent searches for an alternative Planet X, notably by [[Robert Sutton Harrington]],<ref name=\"SeidelmannHarrington1988\" /> failed. In 1992, [[E. Myles Standish|Myles Standish]] used data from ''[[Voyager 2]]'''s flyby of Neptune in 1989, which had revised the estimates of Neptune's mass downward by 0.5%\u2014an amount comparable to the mass of Mars\u2014to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. With the new figures added in, the discrepancies, and with them the need for a Planet X, vanished.<ref name=\"Standish1993\" /> Today, the majority of scientists agree that Planet X, as Lowell defined it, does not exist.<ref name=\"Standage2000\" /> Lowell had made a prediction of Planet X's orbit and position in 1915 that was fairly close to Pluto's actual orbit and its position at that time; [[Ernest W.

This made its official status as a planet controversial, with many questioning whether Pluto should be considered together with or separately from its surrounding population. Museum and planetarium directors occasionally created controversy by omitting Pluto from planetary models of the Solar System. In February 2000 the [[Hayden Planetarium]] in New York City displayed a Solar System model of only eight planets, which made headlines almost a year later.<ref name=\"Tyson2001\" />\n\n[[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], [[3 Juno|Juno]] and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] lost their planet status after the discovery of many other [[asteroid]]s. Similarly, objects increasingly closer in size to Pluto were discovered in the Kuiper belt region. On July 29, 2005, astronomers at [[Caltech]] announced the discovery of a new [[trans-Neptunian object]], [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], which was substantially more massive than Pluto and the most massive object discovered in the Solar System since [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] in 1846. Its discoverers and the press initially called it the [[tenth planet]], although there was no official consensus at the time on whether to call it a planet.<ref name=\"NASA-JPL press release 07-29-2005\" /> Others in the astronomical community considered the discovery the strongest argument for reclassifying Pluto as a minor planet.<ref>{{cite journal |title=What Is a Planet? |journal=The Astronomical Journal |volume=132 |issue=6 |pages=2513\u20132519 |date=November 2, 2006 |doi=10.1086/508861 |last1 = Soter|first1 = Steven|bibcode=2006AJ....132.2513S |arxiv=astro-ph/0608359 }}</ref>\n\n==== IAU classification ====\n\n{{Main|IAU definition of planet}}\n\nThe debate came to a head in August 2006, with an [[IAU definition of planet|IAU resolution]] that created an official definition for the term \"planet\".

Its orbital characteristics are substantially different from those of the planets, which follow nearly circular orbits around the Sun close to a flat reference [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] called the [[ecliptic]]. In contrast, Pluto's orbit is moderately [[orbital inclination|inclined]] relative to the ecliptic (over 17\u00b0) and moderately [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] ([[elliptical]]). This eccentricity means a small region of Pluto's orbit lies closer to the Sun than Neptune's. The Pluto\u2013Charon barycenter came to [[apsis|perihelion]] on September 5, 1989,<ref name=\"jpl-ssd-horizons\" />{{efn|name = Perihelion}} and was last closer to the Sun than Neptune between February 7, 1979, and February 11, 1999.<ref name=\"pluto990209\" />\n\nIn the long term, Pluto's orbit is [[chaos theory|chaotic]]. Computer simulations can be used to predict its position for several million years (both [[time reversibility|forward and backward]] in time), but after intervals longer than the [[Lyapunov time]] of 10\u201320 million years, calculations become speculative: Pluto is sensitive to immeasurably small details of the Solar System, hard-to-predict factors that will gradually change Pluto's position in its orbit.<ref name=\"sussman88\" /><ref name=\"wisdom91\" />\n\nThe [[semi-major axis]] of Pluto's orbit varies between about 39.3 and 39.6&nbsp;[[astronomical unit|au]] with a period of about 19,951 years, corresponding to an orbital period varying between 246 and 249 years. The semi-major axis and period are presently getting longer.<ref name=williams71 />\n\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = right\n | width = 225\n | image1 = Plutoorbit1.5sideview.gif\n | image2 = TheKuiperBelt Orbits Pluto Polar.svg\n | caption1 = Orbit of Pluto&nbsp;\u2013 ecliptic view.

This \"view from above\" shows how Pluto's orbit (in red) is less circular than Neptune's (in blue), and how Pluto is sometimes closer to the Sun than Neptune. The darker sections of both orbits show where they pass below the [[plane of the ecliptic]].\n}}\n\n=== Relationship with Neptune ===\nDespite Pluto's orbit appearing to cross that of Neptune when viewed from directly above, the two objects' orbits are aligned so that they can never collide or even approach closely.\n\nThe two orbits do not intersect. When Pluto is closest to the Sun, and hence closest to Neptune's orbit as viewed from above, it is also the farthest above Neptune's path. Pluto's orbit passes about 8 [[astronomical unit|AU]] above that of Neptune, preventing a collision.<ref name=\"huainn01\" /><ref name=\"Hunter2004\" /><ref name=\"malhotra-9planets\" />\n\nThis alone is not enough to protect Pluto; [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] from the planets (especially Neptune) could alter Pluto's orbit (such as its [[apsidal precession|orbital precession]]) over millions of years so that a collision could be possible. However, Pluto is also protected by its 2:3 [[orbital resonance]] with [[Neptune]]: for every two orbits that Pluto makes around the Sun, Neptune makes three. Each cycle lasts about 495 years. This pattern is such that, in each 495-year cycle, the first time Pluto is near [[perihelion]], Neptune is over 50\u00b0 behind Pluto. By Pluto's second perihelion, Neptune will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits, and so will be nearly 130\u00b0 ahead of Pluto. Pluto and Neptune's minimum separation is over 17&nbsp;AU, which is greater than Pluto's minimum separation from Uranus (11&nbsp;AU).<ref name=\"malhotra-9planets\" /> The minimum separation between Pluto and Neptune actually occurs near the time of Pluto's aphelion.<ref name=williams71 />\n\nThe 2:3 resonance between the two bodies is highly stable and has been preserved over millions of years.<ref name=\"sp-345\" /> This prevents their orbits from changing relative to one another, and so the two bodies can never pass near each other. Even if Pluto's orbit were not inclined, the two bodies could never collide.<ref name=\"malhotra-9planets\" /> The long term stability of the mean-motion resonance is due to phase protection. If Pluto's period is slightly shorter than 3/2 of Neptune, its orbit relative to Neptune will drift, causing it to make closer approaches behind Neptune's orbit. The strong gravitational pull between the two causes [[angular momentum]] to be transferred to Pluto, at Neptune's expense. This moves Pluto into a slightly larger orbit, where it travels slightly more slowly, according to [[Kepler's third law]]. After many such repetitions, Pluto is sufficiently slowed, and Neptune sufficiently sped up, that Pluto's orbit relative to Neptune drifts in the opposite direction until the process is reversed. The whole process takes about 20,000 years to complete.<ref name=\"malhotra-9planets\" /><ref name=\"sp-345\" /><ref name=\"Cohen_Hubbard_1965\">{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=C.

These arise principally from two additional mechanisms (besides the 2:3 mean-motion resonance).\n\nFirst, Pluto's [[argument of perihelion]], the angle between the point where it crosses the ecliptic and the point where it is closest to the Sun, [[libration|librates]] around 90\u00b0.<ref name=\"williams71\" /> This means that when Pluto is closest to the Sun, it is at its farthest above the plane of the Solar System, preventing encounters with Neptune. This is a consequence of the [[Kozai mechanism]],<ref name=\"huainn01\" /> which relates the eccentricity of an orbit to its inclination to a larger perturbing body\u2014in this case Neptune. Relative to Neptune, the amplitude of libration is 38\u00b0, and so the angular separation of Pluto's perihelion to the orbit of Neptune is always greater than 52\u00b0 {{nowrap|(90\u00b0\u201338\u00b0)}}. The closest such angular separation occurs every 10,000 years.<ref name=\"sp-345\" />\n\nSecond, the longitudes of ascending nodes of the two bodies\u2014the points where they cross the ecliptic\u2014are in near-resonance with the above libration. When the two longitudes are the same\u2014that is, when one could draw a straight line through both nodes and the Sun\u2014Pluto's perihelion lies exactly at 90\u00b0, and hence it comes closest to the Sun when it is highest above Neptune's orbit. This is known as the ''1:1 superresonance''. All the [[Jovian planets]], particularly Jupiter, play a role in the creation of the superresonance.<ref name=\"huainn01\" />\n\n=== Quasi-satellite ===\nIn 2012, it was hypothesized that [[15810 Arawn]] could be a [[quasi-satellite]] of Pluto, a specific type of co-orbital configuration.<ref name=\"quasi\" /> According to the hypothesis, the object would be a quasi-satellite of Pluto for about 350,000 years out of every two-million-year period.<ref name=\"quasi\" /><ref name=\"S&T\" /> Measurements made by the ''New Horizons'' spacecraft in 2015 made it possible to calculate the orbit of Arawn more accurately.<ref name=\"2016maynasa\">{{cite web|title=New Horizons Collects First Science on a Post-Pluto Object|url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-horizons-collects-first-science-on-a-post-pluto-object|publisher=NASA|date=2016-05-13}}</ref> These calculations confirm the overall dynamics described in the hypothesis.<ref name=analemma>{{cite journal |title=The analemma criterion: accidental quasi-satellites are indeed true quasi-satellites |url=http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/07/27/mnras.stw1833.abstract |first=Carlos |last=de la Fuente Marcos |last2=de la Fuente Marcos |first2=Ra\u00fal |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |date=2016 |volume=462 |issue=3 |pages=3344\u20133349 |arxiv=1607.06686 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stw1833 |bibcode=2016MNRAS.462.3344D}}</ref> However, it is not agreed upon among astronomers whether Arawn should be classified as a quasi-satellite of Pluto based on this motion, since its orbit is primarily controlled by Neptune with only occasional smaller perturbations caused by Pluto.<ref name=porter_et_al_2016>{{cite journal |title=The First High-phase Observations of a KBO: New Horizons Imaging of (15810) 1994 JR1 from the Kuiper Belt |first=Simon B. |last=Porter |display-authors=etal |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |volume=828 |issue=2 |pages=L15 |date=2016 |arxiv=1605.05376 |bibcode=2016ApJ...828L..15P |doi=10.3847/2041-8205/828/2/L15}}</ref><ref name=\"2016maynasa\" /><ref name=analemma />\n\n== Rotation ==\nPluto's [[rotation period]], its day, is equal to 6.387 [[Earth]] days.<ref name=\"Pluto Fact Sheet\" /><ref name=\"axis\" /> Like [[Uranus]], Pluto rotates on its \"side\" in its orbital plane, with an axial tilt of 120\u00b0, and so its seasonal variation is extreme; at its [[solstice]]s, one-fourth of its surface is in continuous daylight, whereas another fourth is in continuous darkness.<ref name=\"oregon\" /> The reason for this unusual orientation has been debated. Research from the [[University of Arizona]] has suggested that it may be due to the way that a body's spin will always adjust to minimise energy. This could mean a body reorienting itself to put extraneous mass near the equator and regions lacking mass tend towards the poles.

Most astronomers agree that Pluto owes its current position to a [[planetary migration|sudden migration]] undergone by Neptune early in the Solar System's formation. As Neptune migrated outward, it approached the objects in the proto-Kuiper belt, setting one in orbit around itself (Triton), locking others into resonances, and knocking others into chaotic orbits. The objects in the [[scattered disc]], a dynamically unstable region overlapping the Kuiper belt, are thought to have been placed in their current positions by interactions with Neptune's migrating resonances.<ref name=\"Hahn2005\" /> A computer model created in 2004 by Alessandro Morbidelli of the [[C\u00f4te d'Azur Observatory|Observatoire de la C\u00f4te d'Azur]] in [[Nice]] suggested that the migration of Neptune into the Kuiper belt may have been triggered by the formation of a 1:2 resonance between Jupiter and Saturn, which created a gravitational push that propelled both Uranus and Neptune into higher orbits and caused them to switch places, ultimately doubling Neptune's distance from the Sun. The resultant expulsion of objects from the proto-Kuiper belt could also explain the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] 600&nbsp;million years after the Solar System's formation and the origin of the [[Jupiter trojan]]s.<ref name=\"Levison2007\" /> It is possible that Pluto had a near-circular orbit about 33 AU from the Sun before Neptune's migration [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbed]] it into a resonant capture.<ref name=\"Malhotra1995\" /> The [[Nice model]] requires that there were about a thousand Pluto-sized bodies in the original planetesimal disk, which included Triton and Eris.<ref name=\"Levison2007\" />\n\n== Observation and exploration ==\nPluto's distance from Earth makes its in-depth study and [[Space exploration|exploration]] difficult.

Observations were conducted using a [[remote sensing]] package that included [[digital imaging|imaging]] instruments and a radio science investigation tool, as well as [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] and other experiments. The scientific goals of ''New Horizons'' were to characterize the global geology and morphology of Pluto and its moon Charon, map their surface composition, and analyze Pluto's neutral atmosphere and its escape rate.  On October 25, 2016, at 05:48 pm ET, the last bit of data (of a total of 50 billion bits of data; or 6.25 gigabytes) was received from ''New Horizons'' from its close encounter with Pluto.<ref name=\"NYT-20161028\">{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=No More Data From Pluto |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/science/pluto-nasa-new-horizons.html |date=October 28, 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=October 28, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20161027\n | title=Pluto Exploration Complete: New Horizons Returns Last Bits of 2015 Flyby Data to Earth\n | date=October 27, 2016\n | publisher=Johns Hopkins Applied Research Laboratory\n | accessdate=October 28, 2016\n}}</ref><ref name=\"NASA-20150115(b)\">{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=Dwayne |last2=Buckley |first2=Michael |last3=Stothoff |first3=Maria |title= Release 15-011 \u2013 NASA's New Horizons Spacecraft Begins First Stages of Pluto Encounter |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2015/january/nasa-s-new-horizons-spacecraft-begins-first-stages-of-pluto-encounter |date=January 15, 2015 |work=NASA |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Mission/Spacecraft/Data-Collection.php|title=New Horizons|website=pluto.jhuapl.edu|access-date=May 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nSince the ''New Horizons'' flyby, scientists have advocated for an orbiter mission that would return to Pluto to fulfill new science objectives.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/26/15424770/nasa-spacecraft-new-horizons-flyby-pluto-moons-orbiter-mission|title=Why a group of scientists think we need another mission to Pluto|work=The Verge|access-date=July 14, 2018}}</ref> They include mapping the surface at 30 feet per pixel, observations of Pluto's smaller satellites, observations of how Pluto changes as it rotates on its axis, and topographic mapping of Pluto's regions that are covered in long-term darkness due to its axial tilt. The last objective could be accomplished using laser pulses to generate a complete topographic map of Pluto. ''New Horizons'' principal investigator Alan Stern has advocated for a [[Cassini\u2013Huygens|''Cassini'']]-style orbiter that would launch around 2030 (the 100th anniversary of Pluto's discovery) and use Charon's gravity to adjust its orbit as needed to fulfill science objectives after arriving at the Pluto system.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/36697-pluto-orbiter-mission-after-new-horizons.html|title=Going Back to Pluto?

It was the first and the largest Kuiper belt object to be discovered.\n\nPluto was discovered by [[Clyde Tombaugh]] in 1930 and declared to be the [[Planets beyond Neptune|ninth planet]] from the Sun. After 1992, its status as a [[planet]] was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt. In 2005, [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], a dwarf planet in the [[scattered disc]] which is 27% more massive than Pluto, was discovered. This led the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) to [[IAU definition of planet|define the term \"planet\"]] formally in 2006, during their 26th General Assembly. That definition excluded Pluto and reclassified it as a dwarf planet.\n\nIt is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object directly orbiting the [[Sun]]. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is primarily made of ice and rock and is relatively small\u2014one-sixth the mass of the [[Moon]] and one-third its volume. It has a moderately [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 30 to 49&nbsp;[[astronomical unit]]s or AU (4.4\u20137.4 billion&nbsp;km) from the Sun. This means that Pluto periodically comes closer to the Sun than [[Neptune]], but a stable [[orbital resonance]] with Neptune prevents them from colliding.  Light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its average distance (39.5&nbsp;AU).\n\nPluto has [[moons of Pluto|five known moons]]: [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] (the largest, with a diameter just over half that of Pluto), [[Styx (moon)|Styx]], [[Nix (moon)|Nix]], [[Kerberos (moon)|Kerberos]], and [[Hydra (moon)|Hydra]]. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a [[binary system]] because the [[barycenter]] of their orbits does not lie within either body.\n\nThe ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft performed a [[planetary flyby|flyby]] of Pluto on July 14, 2015, becoming the first ever, and to date only, spacecraft to do so. During its brief flyby, ''New Horizons'' made detailed measurements and observations of Pluto and its moons. In September 2016, astronomers announced that the reddish-brown cap of the north pole of Charon is composed of [[tholin]]s, [[organic compound|organic]] [[macromolecule]]s that may be ingredients for the [[Abiogenesis|emergence of life]], and produced from [[methane]], [[nitrogen]] and other gases released from the [[atmosphere of Pluto]] and transferred {{convert|19,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the orbiting moon.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Discovery ===\n{{Further|Planets beyond Neptune}}\n[[File:Pluto discovery plates.png|left|thumb|alt=The same area of night sky with stars, shown twice, side by side.

Unknown to Lowell, his surveys had captured two faint images of Pluto on March 19 and April 7, 1915, but they were not recognized for what they were.<ref name=\"Hoyt\" /><ref name=\"Littman1990\" /> There are fourteen other known [[precovery]] observations, with the earliest made by the [[Yerkes Observatory]] on August 20, 1909.<ref name=\"BuchwaldDimarioWild2000\" />\n\nPercival's widow, Constance Lowell, entered into a ten-year legal battle with the Lowell Observatory over her husband's legacy, and the search for Planet X did not resume until 1929.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|p=50}} [[Vesto Melvin Slipher]], the observatory director, gave the job of locating Planet X to 23-year-old [[Clyde Tombaugh]], who had just arrived at the observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|p=50}}\n\nTombaugh's task was to systematically image the night sky in pairs of photographs, then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position. Using a [[blink comparator]], he rapidly shifted back and forth between views of each of the plates to create the illusion of movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs. On February 18, 1930, after nearly a year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates taken on January 23 and 29. A lesser-quality photograph taken on January 21 helped confirm the movement.{{sfn|Croswell|1997|p=52}} After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the [[Harvard College Observatory]] on March 13, 1930.<ref name=\"Hoyt\" /> Pluto has yet to complete a full orbit of the Sun since its discovery, as one Plutonian year is 247.68 years long.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geek.com/feature/11-awesome-facts-about-the-lovable-dwarf-planet-pluto-1629287/|title=11 awesome facts about Pluto that you probably don't know|date=2015-07-24|website=Geek.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Name ===\nThe discovery made headlines around the globe.<ref>For example: \"Ninth Planet Discovered on Edge of Solar System: First Found in 84 Years\".

Subsequent searches for an alternative Planet X, notably by [[Robert Sutton Harrington]],<ref name=\"SeidelmannHarrington1988\" /> failed. In 1992, [[E. Myles Standish|Myles Standish]] used data from ''[[Voyager 2]]'''s flyby of Neptune in 1989, which had revised the estimates of Neptune's mass downward by 0.5%\u2014an amount comparable to the mass of Mars\u2014to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. With the new figures added in, the discrepancies, and with them the need for a Planet X, vanished.<ref name=\"Standish1993\" /> Today, the majority of scientists agree that Planet X, as Lowell defined it, does not exist.<ref name=\"Standage2000\" /> Lowell had made a prediction of Planet X's orbit and position in 1915 that was fairly close to Pluto's actual orbit and its position at that time; [[Ernest W.

This made its official status as a planet controversial, with many questioning whether Pluto should be considered together with or separately from its surrounding population. Museum and planetarium directors occasionally created controversy by omitting Pluto from planetary models of the Solar System. In February 2000 the [[Hayden Planetarium]] in New York City displayed a Solar System model of only eight planets, which made headlines almost a year later.<ref name=\"Tyson2001\" />\n\n[[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], [[3 Juno|Juno]] and [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] lost their planet status after the discovery of many other [[asteroid]]s.

On July 29, 2005, astronomers at [[Caltech]] announced the discovery of a new [[trans-Neptunian object]], [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], which was substantially more massive than Pluto and the most massive object discovered in the Solar System since [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] in 1846. Its discoverers and the press initially called it the [[tenth planet]], although there was no official consensus at the time on whether to call it a planet.<ref name=\"NASA-JPL press release 07-29-2005\" /> Others in the astronomical community considered the discovery the strongest argument for reclassifying Pluto as a minor planet.<ref>{{cite journal |title=What Is a Planet? |journal=The Astronomical Journal |volume=132 |issue=6 |pages=2513\u20132519 |date=November 2, 2006 |doi=10.1086/508861 |last1 = Soter|first1 = Steven|bibcode=2006AJ....132.2513S |arxiv=astro-ph/0608359 }}</ref>\n\n==== IAU classification ====\n\n{{Main|IAU definition of planet}}\n\nThe debate came to a head in August 2006, with an [[IAU definition of planet|IAU resolution]] that created an official definition for the term \"planet\".

Its orbital characteristics are substantially different from those of the planets, which follow nearly circular orbits around the Sun close to a flat reference [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] called the [[ecliptic]]. In contrast, Pluto's orbit is moderately [[orbital inclination|inclined]] relative to the ecliptic (over 17\u00b0) and moderately [[orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] ([[elliptical]]). This eccentricity means a small region of Pluto's orbit lies closer to the Sun than Neptune's. The Pluto\u2013Charon barycenter came to [[apsis|perihelion]] on September 5, 1989,<ref name=\"jpl-ssd-horizons\" />{{efn|name = Perihelion}} and was last closer to the Sun than Neptune between February 7, 1979, and February 11, 1999.<ref name=\"pluto990209\" />\n\nIn the long term, Pluto's orbit is [[chaos theory|chaotic]]. Computer simulations can be used to predict its position for several million years (both [[time reversibility|forward and backward]] in time), but after intervals longer than the [[Lyapunov time]] of 10\u201320 million years, calculations become speculative: Pluto is sensitive to immeasurably small details of the Solar System, hard-to-predict factors that will gradually change Pluto's position in its orbit.<ref name=\"sussman88\" /><ref name=\"wisdom91\" />\n\nThe [[semi-major axis]] of Pluto's orbit varies between about 39.3 and 39.6&nbsp;[[astronomical unit|au]] with a period of about 19,951 years, corresponding to an orbital period varying between 246 and 249 years. The semi-major axis and period are presently getting longer.<ref name=williams71 />\n\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = right\n | width = 225\n | image1 = Plutoorbit1.5sideview.gif\n | image2 = TheKuiperBelt Orbits Pluto Polar.svg\n | caption1 = Orbit of Pluto&nbsp;\u2013 ecliptic view.

This \"view from above\" shows how Pluto's orbit (in red) is less circular than Neptune's (in blue), and how Pluto is sometimes closer to the Sun than Neptune. The darker sections of both orbits show where they pass below the [[plane of the ecliptic]].\n}}\n\n=== Relationship with Neptune ===\nDespite Pluto's orbit appearing to cross that of Neptune when viewed from directly above, the two objects' orbits are aligned so that they can never collide or even approach closely.\n\nThe two orbits do not intersect. When Pluto is closest to the Sun, and hence closest to Neptune's orbit as viewed from above, it is also the farthest above Neptune's path. Pluto's orbit passes about 8 [[astronomical unit|AU]] above that of Neptune, preventing a collision.<ref name=\"huainn01\" /><ref name=\"Hunter2004\" /><ref name=\"malhotra-9planets\" />\n\nThis alone is not enough to protect Pluto; [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] from the planets (especially Neptune) could alter Pluto's orbit (such as its [[apsidal precession|orbital precession]]) over millions of years so that a collision could be possible. However, Pluto is also protected by its 2:3 [[orbital resonance]] with [[Neptune]]: for every two orbits that Pluto makes around the Sun, Neptune makes three. Each cycle lasts about 495 years. This pattern is such that, in each 495-year cycle, the first time Pluto is near [[perihelion]], Neptune is over 50\u00b0 behind Pluto. By Pluto's second perihelion, Neptune will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits, and so will be nearly 130\u00b0 ahead of Pluto. Pluto and Neptune's minimum separation is over 17&nbsp;AU, which is greater than Pluto's minimum separation from Uranus (11&nbsp;AU).<ref name=\"malhotra-9planets\" /> The minimum separation between Pluto and Neptune actually occurs near the time of Pluto's aphelion.<ref name=williams71 />\n\nThe 2:3 resonance between the two bodies is highly stable and has been preserved over millions of years.<ref name=\"sp-345\" /> This prevents their orbits from changing relative to one another, and so the two bodies can never pass near each other. Even if Pluto's orbit were not inclined, the two bodies could never collide.<ref name=\"malhotra-9planets\" /> The long term stability of the mean-motion resonance is due to phase protection. If Pluto's period is slightly shorter than 3/2 of Neptune, its orbit relative to Neptune will drift, causing it to make closer approaches behind Neptune's orbit. The strong gravitational pull between the two causes [[angular momentum]] to be transferred to Pluto, at Neptune's expense. This moves Pluto into a slightly larger orbit, where it travels slightly more slowly, according to [[Kepler's third law]]. After many such repetitions, Pluto is sufficiently slowed, and Neptune sufficiently sped up, that Pluto's orbit relative to Neptune drifts in the opposite direction until the process is reversed. The whole process takes about 20,000 years to complete.<ref name=\"malhotra-9planets\" /><ref name=\"sp-345\" /><ref name=\"Cohen_Hubbard_1965\">{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=C.

These arise principally from two additional mechanisms (besides the 2:3 mean-motion resonance).\n\nFirst, Pluto's [[argument of perihelion]], the angle between the point where it crosses the ecliptic and the point where it is closest to the Sun, [[libration|librates]] around 90\u00b0.<ref name=\"williams71\" /> This means that when Pluto is closest to the Sun, it is at its farthest above the plane of the Solar System, preventing encounters with Neptune. This is a consequence of the [[Kozai mechanism]],<ref name=\"huainn01\" /> which relates the eccentricity of an orbit to its inclination to a larger perturbing body\u2014in this case Neptune. Relative to Neptune, the amplitude of libration is 38\u00b0, and so the angular separation of Pluto's perihelion to the orbit of Neptune is always greater than 52\u00b0 {{nowrap|(90\u00b0\u201338\u00b0)}}. The closest such angular separation occurs every 10,000 years.<ref name=\"sp-345\" />\n\nSecond, the longitudes of ascending nodes of the two bodies\u2014the points where they cross the ecliptic\u2014are in near-resonance with the above libration. When the two longitudes are the same\u2014that is, when one could draw a straight line through both nodes and the Sun\u2014Pluto's perihelion lies exactly at 90\u00b0, and hence it comes closest to the Sun when it is highest above Neptune's orbit. This is known as the ''1:1 superresonance''. All the [[Jovian planets]], particularly Jupiter, play a role in the creation of the superresonance.<ref name=\"huainn01\" />\n\n=== Quasi-satellite ===\nIn 2012, it was hypothesized that [[15810 Arawn]] could be a [[quasi-satellite]] of Pluto, a specific type of co-orbital configuration.<ref name=\"quasi\" /> According to the hypothesis, the object would be a quasi-satellite of Pluto for about 350,000 years out of every two-million-year period.<ref name=\"quasi\" /><ref name=\"S&T\" /> Measurements made by the ''New Horizons'' spacecraft in 2015 made it possible to calculate the orbit of Arawn more accurately.<ref name=\"2016maynasa\">{{cite web|title=New Horizons Collects First Science on a Post-Pluto Object|url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-horizons-collects-first-science-on-a-post-pluto-object|publisher=NASA|date=2016-05-13}}</ref> These calculations confirm the overall dynamics described in the hypothesis.<ref name=analemma>{{cite journal |title=The analemma criterion: accidental quasi-satellites are indeed true quasi-satellites |url=http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/07/27/mnras.stw1833.abstract |first=Carlos |last=de la Fuente Marcos |last2=de la Fuente Marcos |first2=Ra\u00fal |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |date=2016 |volume=462 |issue=3 |pages=3344\u20133349 |arxiv=1607.06686 |doi=10.1093/mnras/stw1833 |bibcode=2016MNRAS.462.3344D}}</ref> However, it is not agreed upon among astronomers whether Arawn should be classified as a quasi-satellite of Pluto based on this motion, since its orbit is primarily controlled by Neptune with only occasional smaller perturbations caused by Pluto.<ref name=porter_et_al_2016>{{cite journal |title=The First High-phase Observations of a KBO: New Horizons Imaging of (15810) 1994 JR1 from the Kuiper Belt |first=Simon B. |last=Porter |display-authors=etal |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |volume=828 |issue=2 |pages=L15 |date=2016 |arxiv=1605.05376 |bibcode=2016ApJ...828L..15P |doi=10.3847/2041-8205/828/2/L15}}</ref><ref name=\"2016maynasa\" /><ref name=analemma />\n\n== Rotation ==\nPluto's [[rotation period]], its day, is equal to 6.387 [[Earth]] days.<ref name=\"Pluto Fact Sheet\" /><ref name=\"axis\" /> Like [[Uranus]], Pluto rotates on its \"side\" in its orbital plane, with an axial tilt of 120\u00b0, and so its seasonal variation is extreme; at its [[solstice]]s, one-fourth of its surface is in continuous daylight, whereas another fourth is in continuous darkness.<ref name=\"oregon\" /> The reason for this unusual orientation has been debated. Research from the [[University of Arizona]] has suggested that it may be due to the way that a body's spin will always adjust to minimise energy. This could mean a body reorienting itself to put extraneous mass near the equator and regions lacking mass tend towards the poles.

Most astronomers agree that Pluto owes its current position to a [[planetary migration|sudden migration]] undergone by Neptune early in the Solar System's formation. As Neptune migrated outward, it approached the objects in the proto-Kuiper belt, setting one in orbit around itself (Triton), locking others into resonances, and knocking others into chaotic orbits. The objects in the [[scattered disc]], a dynamically unstable region overlapping the Kuiper belt, are thought to have been placed in their current positions by interactions with Neptune's migrating resonances.<ref name=\"Hahn2005\" /> A computer model created in 2004 by Alessandro Morbidelli of the [[C\u00f4te d'Azur Observatory|Observatoire de la C\u00f4te d'Azur]] in [[Nice]] suggested that the migration of Neptune into the Kuiper belt may have been triggered by the formation of a 1:2 resonance between Jupiter and Saturn, which created a gravitational push that propelled both Uranus and Neptune into higher orbits and caused them to switch places, ultimately doubling Neptune's distance from the Sun. The resultant expulsion of objects from the proto-Kuiper belt could also explain the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] 600&nbsp;million years after the Solar System's formation and the origin of the [[Jupiter trojan]]s.<ref name=\"Levison2007\" /> It is possible that Pluto had a near-circular orbit about 33 AU from the Sun before Neptune's migration [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbed]] it into a resonant capture.<ref name=\"Malhotra1995\" /> The [[Nice model]] requires that there were about a thousand Pluto-sized bodies in the original planetesimal disk, which included Triton and Eris.<ref name=\"Levison2007\" />\n\n== Observation and exploration ==\nPluto's distance from Earth makes its in-depth study and [[Space exploration|exploration]] difficult.

Observations were conducted using a [[remote sensing]] package that included [[digital imaging|imaging]] instruments and a radio science investigation tool, as well as [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] and other experiments. The scientific goals of ''New Horizons'' were to characterize the global geology and morphology of Pluto and its moon Charon, map their surface composition, and analyze Pluto's neutral atmosphere and its escape rate.  On October 25, 2016, at 05:48 pm ET, the last bit of data (of a total of 50 billion bits of data; or 6.25 gigabytes) was received from ''New Horizons'' from its close encounter with Pluto.<ref name=\"NYT-20161028\">{{cite news |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |title=No More Data From Pluto |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/29/science/pluto-nasa-new-horizons.html |date=October 28, 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=October 28, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/News-Center/News-Article.php?page=20161027\n | title=Pluto Exploration Complete: New Horizons Returns Last Bits of 2015 Flyby Data to Earth\n | date=October 27, 2016\n | publisher=Johns Hopkins Applied Research Laboratory\n | accessdate=October 28, 2016\n}}</ref><ref name=\"NASA-20150115(b)\">{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=Dwayne |last2=Buckley |first2=Michael |last3=Stothoff |first3=Maria |title= Release 15-011 \u2013 NASA's New Horizons Spacecraft Begins First Stages of Pluto Encounter |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press/2015/january/nasa-s-new-horizons-spacecraft-begins-first-stages-of-pluto-encounter |date=January 15, 2015 |work=NASA |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Mission/Spacecraft/Data-Collection.php|title=New Horizons|website=pluto.jhuapl.edu|access-date=May 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\nSince the ''New Horizons'' flyby, scientists have advocated for an orbiter mission that would return to Pluto to fulfill new science objectives.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/26/15424770/nasa-spacecraft-new-horizons-flyby-pluto-moons-orbiter-mission|title=Why a group of scientists think we need another mission to Pluto|work=The Verge|access-date=July 14, 2018}}</ref> They include mapping the surface at 30 feet per pixel, observations of Pluto's smaller satellites, observations of how Pluto changes as it rotates on its axis, and topographic mapping of Pluto's regions that are covered in long-term darkness due to its axial tilt. The last objective could be accomplished using laser pulses to generate a complete topographic map of Pluto. ''New Horizons'' principal investigator Alan Stern has advocated for a [[Cassini\u2013Huygens|''Cassini'']]-style orbiter that would launch around 2030 (the 100th anniversary of Pluto's discovery) and use Charon's gravity to adjust its orbit as needed to fulfill science objectives after arriving at the Pluto system.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.space.com/36697-pluto-orbiter-mission-after-new-horizons.html|title=Going Back to Pluto?

The match was replayed and this time Hurlford won 3\u20131, however a similar protest by Kilmarnock was also upheld and Hurlford were disqualified from the competition. In the second round, ''Killie'' lost 4\u20131 to [[Annbank F.C.|Annbank]] at Pebble Park.\n\nA successful Ayrshire Cup campaign started with wins over [[Monkcastle F.C.|Monkcastle]] and [[Lugar Boswell Thistle F.C.|Lugar Boswell]] before Kilmarnock received a bye to the semi-finals.

In the Scottish Cup, Kilmarnock were involved in a controversial first round tie. Kilmarnock initially defeated [[Hurlford F.C.|Hurlford]] 6\u20131 at Drumbiehill Park but a protest over a breach of registration rules was upheld and the result was declared void. The match was replayed and this time Hurlford won 3\u20131, however a similar protest by Kilmarnock was also upheld and Hurlford were disqualified from the competition. In the second round, ''Killie'' lost 4\u20131 to [[Annbank F.C.|Annbank]] at Pebble Park.\n\nA successful Ayrshire Cup campaign started with wins over [[Monkcastle F.C.|Monkcastle]] and [[Lugar Boswell Thistle F.C.|Lugar Boswell]] before Kilmarnock received a bye to the semi-finals. On 31 January 1885, Kilmarnock thumped [[Ayr F.C.|Ayr]] 5\u20132 at [[Rugby Park]] to reach the final for the second consecutive season. They retained the cup after defeating Hurlford 2\u20130 in the final at Holm Quarry.\n\nThe two charity cups saw similar fates for Kilmarnock.

In the first round of the Scottish Cup, Kilmarnock easily saw off Annbank with a 7\u20131 win at Rugby Park. Their second round tie against [[Hurlford F.C.|Hurlford]] was more of a marathon after one match was declared void, two were drawn and one abandoned before the tie was finally settled six weeks after the original match. Hurlford won through with a 5\u20131 victory in the fifth match on 14 November 1885.\n\nA third successive Ayrshire Cup triumph began with an 8\u20131 win over [[Maybole F.C.
