The print's first issue of PNM was published in October 2011 by Pure Media, LLC. The magazine joined [[Metacritic]] in 2019 with its consistent stream of first-party and third-party [[video game]] [[Video game journalism|reviews]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/publication/pure-nintendo|title=Pure Nintendo Profile - Metacritic|website=www.metacritic.com|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> Currently, issues of the magazine are released digitally (though physical copies can be purchased), and it is complemented by the company's online website, [https://PureNintendo.com PureNintendo.com].\n\n== Overview ==\n\nPNM was created with the intent to complement the online news coverage found on [http://www.purenintendo.com/ PureNintendo.com]. PNM focuses on content such as developer interviews, game previews, concept and fan artwork, game tips, interactive puzzles, and gaming history. This content is supplemented with news, reviews, and other game information. Each issue has regularly featured content as well as additional features written by either Pure Nintendo staff members or contributors. The interactive apps, for the digital version of PNM, add links to external website posts, videos, and a touch interface for the pixel puzzles.\n\n== History ==\n\nFounder Justin Sharp created the website, Niwifi.net, in 2007 for users to exchange friend codes (a 12-digit code that allowed users of Nintendo's online service to find and connect with each other). Soon after its founding, Justin Sharp teamed up with Pure Nintendo Magazine co-founder James Higginbotham, and the website eventually turned its focus towards Nintendo-related news.\n\nPNM, as it is known now, was founded by Justin Sharp and James Higginbotham and first published October 2011. The magazine was initially conceptualized as a monthly publication until December 2011.<ref>{{cite web| title = INTERVIEW: JUSTIN SHARP (PURE NINTENDO MAGAZINE)| url = http://www.nintendofeed.com/2012/10/interview-justin-sharp-pure-nintendo.html| publisher = Nintendo Feed| accessdate = 3 January 2014}}</ref> PNM switched to a bi-monthly publication schedule beginning with the February 2012 issue. The first 5 issues of PNM were offered in a digital-only format. The sixth issue of PNM was the first print issue and was published August 2012 for the months of August and September 2012. Early issues of PNM were small and only 26 pages by Issue #5. Issue #6 of PNM more than doubled in size and was 62 pages long.\n\nOn September 11, 2012, Pure Nintendo launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to help fund the magazine and start a subscription service.
