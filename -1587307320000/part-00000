Prisoners must report to prison between 9:30pm and 6:30am each day, but may go to work, visit relatives and complete errands while in the community. They also may hunt with firearms if they are escorted by a prison guard. Prisoners have keys to their own cells, as this is regarded as a form of privacy. A failure to attend prison will result in 7 days in solitary confinement once the escapee returns. Prisoners are also subjected to drug testing, and a failed drug test will result in solitary confinement. There are presently 160 places in the Greenlandic prison system.\n\nGreenland intends to construct a secure facility to house prisoners needing continual supervision and/or psychiatric care, with a 20-bed capacity, a project on foot since 2007 which has been delayed several times until 2017. As a consequence, Greenlandic prisoners requiring a high level of supervision are sent to Denmark's [[Institution of Herstedvester|Herstedvester]], a prison which has the capacity to provide psychiatric care. There remains ongoing issues with care in this facility, with complaints ranging from the language barrier with Danish guards, to the Danish system de-prioritising Greenlandic inmates care and rehabilitation against the needs of Danish inmates, to the problematic means of Nuuk's judicial evaluation of the prisoners through [[Skype]] teleconferencing.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rigspolitiet]] - National police of Denmark\n*[[Police of Denmark|Politiet]] - State police of Denmark\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{police}}\n{{Americas topic|Law enforcement in}}\n{{Greenland topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Law Enforcement In Greenland}}\n\n[[Category:Government of Greenland]]\n[[Category:Greenlandic law|Enforcement]]\n[[Category:Law enforcement in Greenland| ]]\n\n{{Greenland-stub}}\n{{law-enforcement-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Law enforcement in Greenland}}\n{{more footnotes|date=April 2012}}\n\n'''Law enforcement in [[Greenland]]''', an autonomous country of the [[Danish Realm|Kingdom of Denmark]], is provided by '''Kalaallit Nunaanni Politiit''' ({{lang-da|Gr\u00f8nlands Politi}}, {{lang-en|Greenland Police}}) an independent police district of Naalagaaffimmi Politiit ({{lang-da|[[Rigspolitiet]]}}), the [[Police of Denmark|Danish national police]] service.
