There, in a rural place called Pr\u00e9montr\u00e9, he and thirteen companions established a monastery to be the cradle of a new order. As they were canons regular, they followed the [[Rule of St. Augustine]], but with supplementary statutes that made their life one of great austerity.<ref name=EB1911/> Common prayer and celebration of the Eucharist was to be the sustaining dynamic of the community.<ref name=\"depere\">{{cite web|url=http://www.norbertines.org/our_history_xanten.html|title=Saint Norbert of Xanten History at Saint Norbert Abbey in De Pere, Wisconsin|work=norbertines.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106082558/http://www.norbertines.org/our_history_xanten.html|archivedate=2013-11-06}}</ref>\n\n[[File:R\u00fcti - Ortsmuseum - Kloster - Pr\u00e4mostratenser-Habit IMG 5172.JPG|thumb|[[Religious habit]] of a Premonstratensian, former [[R\u00fcti Abbey]]]]\nIn 1126, when the order received papal [[approbation]] by [[Pope Honorius II]], there were nine houses; others were established in quick succession throughout western Europe, so that at the middle of the fourteenth century there were some 1,300 monasteries for men and 400 for women. The Norbertines played a predominant part in the conversion of the [[Wends]] and the bringing of [[Christianity]] to the territories around the [[Elbe]] and the [[Oder]]. In time, mitigations and relaxations emerged, and these gave rise to reforms and semi-independent congregations within the Order.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe Norbertines came to England about 1143, first at Newhouse in [[Lincoln, England]]; before the dissolution under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] there were 35 houses.<ref name=EB1911/> Soon after their arrival in England, they founded [[Dryburgh Abbey]] in the Borders area of [[Scotland]], which was followed by other communities at [[Whithorn Priory]], [[Dercongal Abbey]] and [[Tongland Abbey]] all in the Borders area, as well as [[Fearn Abbey]] in the northern part of the nation. Like most orders they were almost completely devastated by the successive onslaughts of the Reformation, French Revolution and Napoleon, but then experienced a revival in the 19th century.<ref name=\"staley\">[http://www.snc.edu/communications/magazine/2009v41n3/cns.html Staley, Tony. \"Home to a Living History\", ''St. Norbert College Magazine'', Fall 2009]</ref>\n\nBy the beginning of the nineteenth century the order had become almost extinct, only eight houses surviving, all in [[Austria]].<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Premonstratensians|inline=1}}</ref> However, there was something of a resurgence, and at the start of the twentieth century there were 20 monasteries and 1000 priests. {{As of|2005}}, the number of monasteries had increased to nearly 100 and spread to every continent. In 1893, Father Bernard Pennings and two other Norbertines from Berne Abbey came to the United States to minister to Belgian immigrants in northern Wisconsin. [[De Pere, Wisconsin]], became the site of the first Norbertine Abbey in the new world.<ref name=\"daylesford\" />\n\nIn the twenty-first century, like all canons regular, they follow the [[Augustinians#The Augustinian Rule|Augustinian Rule]].

Like the Norbertine communities for men, those for women are autonomous. Unusually, within the religious communities of the [[Catholic Church]], the Norbertine Order has always seen the spiritual life of the canonesses as being on an equal footing with that of its priests and [[lay brother]]s. In the [[Middle Ages]], the Premonstratentians even had a few [[double monastery|double monasteries]],<ref>[http://www.premontresisters.com/ \"Norbertine Sisters in the World\", Premontre Sisters]</ref> where men and women lived in cloisters located next to each other as part of the same abbey, the communities demonstrating their unity by sharing the church building. Today, it is common for a foundation of canonesses to have links not only with other canonesses, but also a community of canons.\n\nOn January 29, 2011, a canonry of the canonesses, the Bethlehem Priory of St. Joseph, was established with the solemn [[religious profession]] of the first nine canonesses at the [[Saint John the Baptist Cathedral (Fresno, California)|Saint John the Baptist Cathedral]], [[Fresno, California]].  The priory is located in [[Tehachapi, California]], and by 2013 had grown to 26 members in all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Blog/2439/norbertine_nuns_monastery_expansion_blessed.aspx|title=Norbertine nuns' monastery expansion blessed|work=catholicworldreport.com}}</ref>  The community was first founded as a public association of the faithful by the Norbertine canons of St. Michael's Abbey, Orange County, California.  It is the first canonry of Norbertine canonesses founded in North America.\n\n==Premonstratensian Rite==\nThe Premonstratensians were among the religious orders with their own rite who kept this rite after [[Pope Pius V]] suppressed such rites with a continuous tradition of less than two hundred years. The Premonstratensian Rite was especially characterized by a ritual solemnity.  The Premonstratensian Rite was also characterized by an emphasis on the [[Paschal mystery]] unique among the Latin rites.  This was especially seen in the solemnity with which the daily conventional high mass and office was celebrated during the Easter octave, especially vespers which concluded with a procession to the baptismal font, a practice paralleled among the Latin rites only in similar processions still found in the [[Ambrosian Rite]].  Another unique practice of the Premonstratensian Rite was the celebration of a daily votive mass in honor of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] in each of its abbeys and priories.\n\n==Structure==\nAs each abbey or priory is autonomous, practices and apostolates differ; some are contemplative in character whilst others are highly active in pastoral ministry. However, each is guided by the Rule of Saint Augustine as well as the Constitutions established by the [[General Chapter]] which is held every 6 years. Demonstrating Norbertine unity, the general Chapter includes representatives from both male and female communities. The head of the Order, termed [[Abbot]] General, resides in [[Rome]], and he is assisted in his duties by the Definitors (High Council) as well as commissions established for various aspects of the Order's life such as Liturgy and inter-abbey communications.\n\n==Abbeys==\nAs of 2012, there were Premonstratensian abbeys or priories throughout the world: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom and USA.<ref name=\"premontre\" />\n\nThere are seven circaries (Premonstratensian term for an [[ecclesiastical province]]<ref>[http://www.dict.cc/english-german/circary+%5BPremonstratensian+equivalent+to+a+monastic+province%5D.html 'circary' definition], ''dict.cc\nEnglish-German Dictionary''.</ref>):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.premontre.org/chapter/cat/places/|title=Places|work=premontre.org}}</ref>\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n* '''Anglica Circary''':\n*St Norbert Priory, Queens Park, Perth, Australia\n*[[St. Philip's Priory]], Chelmsford, England<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.praemonstratensis.co.uk/ |title=St. Philip's Priory, Chelmsford. |work=praemonstratensis.co.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=19 July 2012}}</ref>\n*Holy Trinity Abbey, Kilnacrott, Ireland\n*[[St. Norbert Abbey]], De Pere, Wisconsin<ref name=\"depere\" />\n** Holy Spirit House of Studies, Chicago\n*[[Daylesford Abbey]], Paoli, Pennsylvania, USA<ref name=\"daylesford\">{{cite web |url=http://www.daylesford.org/Home.aspx |title=Daylesford Abbey |work=daylesford.org |year=2010 |accessdate=19 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718150040/http://www.daylesford.org/home.aspx |archivedate=18 July 2012 }}</ref>\n* Immaculate Conception Priory, Middletown, Delaware, USA \n*[[St. Michael's Abbey (Orange County, California)|St. Michael's Abbey]], California, USA<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stmichaelsabbey.com/abbey/|title=St. Michael's Abbey of the Norbertine Fathers|work=St. Michael's Abbey|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322121233/http://www.stmichaelsabbey.com/abbey/|archivedate=2013-03-22}}</ref>\n*St. Moses the Black, Jackson, Mississippi, USA<ref name=\"depere\" />\n*Santa Maria de la Vid Abbey, New Mexico, USA<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.norbertinecommunity.org/ |title=Welcome to the Norbertine Community of New Mexico!

Premonstratensians are designated by ''O.Praem.'' (''Ordo Praemonstratensis'') following their name.\n\nNorbert was a friend of [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] and was largely influenced by the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] ideals as to both the manner of life and the government of his order. As the Premonstratensians are not [[monk]]s but Canons Regular, their work often involves preaching and the exercising of pastoral ministry; they frequently serve in parishes close to their abbeys or priories.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==History==\nThe order was founded in 1120.<ref name=\"geudens\">[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12387b.htm Geudens, Francis Martin. \"Premonstratensian Canons\", ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 16 June 2013]</ref> Saint Norbert had made various efforts to introduce a strict form of canonical life in various communities of canons in [[Germany]]; in 1120 he was working in the now-extinct [[Ancient Diocese of Laon]], in [[Picardy]], northeastern [[France]]. There, in a rural place called Pr\u00e9montr\u00e9, he and thirteen companions established a monastery to be the cradle of a new order. As they were canons regular, they followed the [[Rule of St. Augustine]], but with supplementary statutes that made their life one of great austerity.<ref name=EB1911/> Common prayer and celebration of the Eucharist was to be the sustaining dynamic of the community.<ref name=\"depere\">{{cite web|url=http://www.norbertines.org/our_history_xanten.html|title=Saint Norbert of Xanten History at Saint Norbert Abbey in De Pere, Wisconsin|work=norbertines.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106082558/http://www.norbertines.org/our_history_xanten.html|archivedate=2013-11-06}}</ref>\n\n[[File:R\u00fcti - Ortsmuseum - Kloster - Pr\u00e4mostratenser-Habit IMG 5172.JPG|thumb|[[Religious habit]] of a Premonstratensian, former [[R\u00fcti Abbey]]]]\nIn 1126, when the order received papal [[approbation]] by [[Pope Honorius II]], there were nine houses; others were established in quick succession throughout western Europe, so that at the middle of the fourteenth century there were some 1,300 monasteries for men and 400 for women. The Norbertines played a predominant part in the conversion of the [[Wends]] and the bringing of [[Christianity]] to the territories around the [[Elbe]] and the [[Oder]]. In time, mitigations and relaxations emerged, and these gave rise to reforms and semi-independent congregations within the Order.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nThe Norbertines came to England about 1143, first at Newhouse in [[Lincoln, England]], and before the dissolution under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] there were 35 houses.<ref name=EB1911/> Soon after their arrival in England, they founded [[Dryburgh Abbey]] in the Borders area of [[Scotland]], which was followed by other communities at [[Whithorn Priory]], [[Dercongal Abbey]] and [[Tongland Abbey]] all in the Borders area, as well as [[Fearn Abbey]] in the northern part of the nation. Like most orders they were almost completely devastated by the successive onslaughts of the Reformation, French Revolution and Napoleon, but then experienced a revival in the 19th century.<ref name=\"staley\">[http://www.snc.edu/communications/magazine/2009v41n3/cns.html Staley, Tony. \"Home to a Living History\", ''St. Norbert College Magazine'', Fall 2009]</ref>\n\nBy the beginning of the nineteenth century the order had become almost extinct, only eight houses surviving, all in [[Austria]].<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Premonstratensians|inline=1}}</ref> However, there was something of a resurgence, and at the start of the twentieth century there were 20 monasteries and 1000 priests. {{As of|2005}}, the number of monasteries had increased to nearly 100 and spread to every continent. In 1893, Father Bernard Pennings and two other Norbertines from Berne Abbey came to the United States to minister to Belgian immigrants in northern Wisconsin. [[De Pere, Wisconsin]], became the site of the first Norbertine Abbey in the new world.<ref name=\"daylesford\" />\n\nIn the twenty-first century, like all canons regular, they follow the [[Augustinians#The Augustinian Rule|Augustinian Rule]]. In order to \u201cearn their living\u201d, the different communities had, as formerly, to create and operate small industrial activities (SME) such as printing ([[Averbode Abbey]], [[Tongerlo Abbey]], [[Berne Abbey]]), farming ([[Kinshasa]], [[Ireland]], [[Postel Abbey]]), cheese-making (Postel Abbey), running schools (Averbode Abbey, Berne Abbey, [[United States]], [[Australia]]), agreements with breweries (Tongerlo Abbey, Postel Abbey, Park Abbey, [[Leffe]], [[Grimbergen]]), retreat centres (nearly everywhere), astronomical observatories (Mira, Grimbergen), artistic bookbinding (in [[Oosterhout]]), forestry ([[Schl\u00e4gl Abbey]], [[Geras Abbey]], [[Slovakia]]) and pilgrimages ([[Conques]]).<ref name=\"abbaye\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abbaye-de-leffe.be/|title=Abbaye Notre-Dame de Leffe|author=Abbaye Notre-Dame de Leffe|work=abbaye-de-leffe.be}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Premonstratentian website, there are some 1000 male and 200 female members of the Order.<ref name=\"premontre\">{{cite web|url=http://www.premontre.org/chapter/cat/welcome/who-are-the-premonstratensians/|title=Who are the Premonstratensians?|work=premontre.org}}</ref>  The Feast of All Norbertine Saints and Blesseds is celebrated internally on Nov. 13.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.norbertines.org/norbertine_associates_calendar.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117025833/http://www.norbertines.org/norbertine_associates_calendar.html |archivedate=2015-11-17 }}</ref>\n\n==Canonesses==\n[[File:JRKRUK 20130606 NORBERTANKI IMBRAMOWICE IMG 9376.jpg|thumb|left|Norbertine canonesses in [[Imbramowice, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Imbramowice]], Poland.]]\n\nThe Order has several abbeys of women who, though technically called canonesses, followed the life of an [[enclosed religious orders|enclosed religious order]] and are therefore more commonly termed Norbertine nuns. Like the Norbertine communities for men, those for women are autonomous. Unusually, within the religious communities of the [[Catholic Church]], the Norbertine Order has always seen the spiritual life of the canonesses as being on an equal footing with that of its priests and [[lay brother]]s. In the [[Middle Ages]], the Premonstratentians even had a few [[double monastery|double monasteries]],<ref>[http://www.premontresisters.com/ \"Norbertine Sisters in the World\", Premontre Sisters]</ref> where men and women lived in cloisters located next to each other as part of the same abbey, the communities demonstrating their unity by sharing the church building. Today, it is common for a foundation of canonesses to have links not only with other canonesses, but also a community of canons.\n\nOn January 29, 2011, a canonry of the canonesses, the Bethlehem Priory of St. Joseph, was established with the solemn [[religious profession]] of the first nine canonesses at the [[Saint John the Baptist Cathedral (Fresno, California)|Saint John the Baptist Cathedral]], [[Fresno, California]].  The priory is located in [[Tehachapi, California]], and by 2013 had grown to 26 members in all.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Blog/2439/norbertine_nuns_monastery_expansion_blessed.aspx|title=Norbertine nuns' monastery expansion blessed|work=catholicworldreport.com}}</ref>  The community was first founded as a public association of the faithful by the Norbertine canons of St. Michael's Abbey, Orange County, California.  It is the first canonry of Norbertine canonesses founded in North America.\n\n==Premonstratensian Rite==\nThe Premonstratensians were among the religious orders with their own rite who kept this rite after [[Pope Pius V]] suppressed such rites with a continuous tradition of less than two hundred years. The Premonstratensian Rite was especially characterized by a ritual solemnity.  The Premonstratensian Rite was also characterized by an emphasis on the [[Paschal mystery]] unique among the Latin rites.  This was especially seen in the solemnity with which the daily conventional high mass and office was celebrated during the Easter octave, especially vespers which concluded with a procession to the baptismal font, a practice paralleled among the Latin rites only in similar processions still found in the [[Ambrosian Rite]].  Another unique practice of the Premonstratensian Rite was the celebration of a daily votive mass in honor of [[Mary, mother of Jesus]] in each of its abbeys and priories.\n\n==Structure==\nAs each abbey or priory is autonomous, practices and apostolates differ; some are contemplative in character whilst others are highly active in pastoral ministry. However, each is guided by the Rule of Saint Augustine as well as the Constitutions established by the [[General Chapter]] which is held every 6 years. Demonstrating Norbertine unity, the general Chapter includes representatives from both male and female communities. The head of the Order, termed [[Abbot]] General, resides in [[Rome]], and he is assisted in his duties by the Definitors (High Council) as well as commissions established for various aspects of the Order's life such as Liturgy and inter-abbey communications.\n\n==Abbeys==\nAs of 2012, there were Premonstratensian abbeys or priories throughout the world: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Peru, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom and USA.<ref name=\"premontre\" />\n\nThere are seven circaries (Premonstratensian term for an [[ecclesiastical province]]<ref>[http://www.dict.cc/english-german/circary+%5BPremonstratensian+equivalent+to+a+monastic+province%5D.html 'circary' definition], ''dict.cc\nEnglish-German Dictionary''.</ref>):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.premontre.org/chapter/cat/places/|title=Places|work=premontre.org}}</ref>\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-2}}\n* '''Anglica Circary''':\n*St Norbert Priory, Queens Park, Perth, Australia\n*[[St. Philip's Priory]], Chelmsford, England<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.praemonstratensis.co.uk/ |title=St. Philip's Priory, Chelmsford. |work=praemonstratensis.co.uk |year=2012 |accessdate=19 July 2012}}</ref>\n*Holy Trinity Abbey, Kilnacrott, Ireland\n*[[St. Norbert Abbey]], De Pere, Wisconsin<ref name=\"depere\" />\n** Holy Spirit House of Studies, Chicago\n*[[Daylesford Abbey]], Paoli, Pennsylvania, USA<ref name=\"daylesford\">{{cite web |url=http://www.daylesford.org/Home.aspx |title=Daylesford Abbey |work=daylesford.org |year=2010 |accessdate=19 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718150040/http://www.daylesford.org/home.aspx |archivedate=18 July 2012 }}</ref>\n* Immaculate Conception Priory, Middletown, Delaware, USA \n*[[St. Michael's Abbey (Orange County, California)|St. Michael's Abbey]], California, USA<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stmichaelsabbey.com/abbey/|title=St. Michael's Abbey of the Norbertine Fathers|work=St. Michael's Abbey|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130322121233/http://www.stmichaelsabbey.com/abbey/|archivedate=2013-03-22}}</ref>\n*St. Moses the Black, Jackson, Mississippi, USA<ref name=\"depere\" />\n*Santa Maria de la Vid Abbey, New Mexico, USA<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.norbertinecommunity.org/ |title=Welcome to the Norbertine Community of New Mexico!

There is no defined line between spiritual dolls and toys. In some cultures dolls that had been used in rituals were given to children. They were also used in children's education and as carriers of cultural heritage. In other cultures dolls were considered too laden with magical powers to allow children to play with them.<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1973|pp=4\u20137 }}</ref>\n\n[[African dolls]] are used to teach and entertain; they are supernatural intermediaries, and they are manipulated for ritual purposes. Their shape and costume vary according to region and custom. Dolls are frequently handed down from mother to daughter. ''[[Akuaba]]'' are wooden ritual [[fertility]] dolls from [[Ghana]] and nearby areas. The best known ''akuaba'' are those of the [[Ashanti people]], whose ''akuaba'' have large, disc-like heads. Other tribes in the region have their own distinctive style of ''akuaba''.\n[[File:Hinadolls.jpg|thumb|[[Japanese traditional dolls|Japanese]] hina dolls, displayed during the [[Hinamatsuri]] festival]]\nThere is a rich history of [[Japanese dolls]] dating back to the [[Dog\u016b]] figures (8000\u2013200&nbsp;BCE). and [[Haniwa]] funerary figures (300\u2013600 AD). By the eleventh century, dolls were used as playthings as well as for protection and in religious ceremonies. During [[Hinamatsuri]], the doll festival, hina dolls are displayed. These are made of straw and wood, painted, and dressed in elaborate, many-layered textiles. [[Daruma doll]]s are spherical dolls with red bodies and white faces without pupils. They represent [[Bodhidharma]], the East Indian who founded [[Zen]], and are used as good luck charms. Wooden [[Kokeshi]] dolls have no arms or legs, but a large head and cylindrical body, representing little girls.\n\nThe use of an [[effigy]] to perform a spell on someone is documented in African, Native American, and European cultures. Examples of such magical devices include the European [[poppet]] and the ''[[nkisi]]'' or ''bocio'' of West and Central Africa. In European [[folk religion|folk]] [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[witchcraft]], poppet dolls are used to represent a person for casting spells on that person. The intention is that whatever actions are performed upon the effigy will be transferred to the subject through [[sympathetic magic]]. The practice of sticking pins in ''[[voodoo doll]]s'' have been associated with [[African-American]] [[Hoodoo (folk magic)|Hoodoo]] folk magic. Voodoo dolls are not a feature of [[Haitian Vodou]] religion, but have been portrayed as such in popular culture, and stereotypical voodoo dolls are sold to tourists in Haiti.

There is no defined line between spiritual dolls and toys. In some cultures dolls that had been used in rituals were given to children. They were also used in children's education and as carriers of cultural heritage. In other cultures dolls were considered too laden with magical powers to allow children to play with them.<ref>{{harvnb|Fraser|1973|pp=4\u20137 }}</ref>\n\n[[African dolls]] are used to teach and entertain; they are supernatural intermediaries, and they are manipulated for ritual purposes. Their shape and costume vary according to region and custom. Dolls are frequently handed down from mother to daughter. ''[[Akuaba]]'' are wooden ritual [[fertility]] dolls from [[Ghana]] and nearby areas. The best known ''akuaba'' are those of the [[Ashanti people]], whose ''akuaba'' have large, disc-like heads. Other tribes in the region have their own distinctive style of ''akuaba''.\n[[File:Hinadolls.jpg|thumb|[[Japanese traditional dolls|Japanese]] hina dolls, displayed during the [[Hinamatsuri]] festival]]\nThere is a rich history of [[Japanese dolls]] dating back to the [[Dog\u016b]] figures (8000\u2013200&nbsp;BCE). and [[Haniwa]] funerary figures (300\u2013600 AD). By the eleventh century, dolls were used as playthings as well as for protection and in religious ceremonies. During [[Hinamatsuri]], the doll festival, hina dolls are displayed. These are made of straw and wood, painted, and dressed in elaborate, many-layered textiles. [[Daruma doll]]s are spherical dolls with red bodies and white faces without pupils. They represent [[Bodhidharma]], the East Indian who founded [[Zen]], and are used as good luck charms. Wooden [[Kokeshi]] dolls have no arms or legs, but a large head and cylindrical body, representing little girls.\n\nThe use of an [[effigy]] to perform a spell on someone is documented in African, Native American, and European cultures. Examples of such magical devices include the European [[poppet]] and the ''[[nkisi]]'' or ''bocio'' of West and Central Africa. In European [[folk religion|folk]] [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and [[witchcraft]], poppet dolls are used to represent a person for casting spells on that person.

He was also a fourth generation mathematical instrument maker and optician in England, his family being highly regarded in this field at the time.\n\n==Early Life and Instrument Making==\nThomas Gilbert was born in 1786 in The Tower Hamlets, Middlesex, England. He was the son of William Gilbert (1755-1819) and Anna Couchman. \n\nThe Gilbert family were highly regarded makers of mathematical, optical and philosophical instruments and were based in the Tower Hill area of London, England before becoming associated with Leadenhall Street in the City of London. Thomas' great grandfather, John Gilbert (1695-1749), was the first family member known to have worked in this field and some of his work was presented to [[Isaac Newton]] and [[The Royal Society]].

These temporary huts were built on the banks of the [[River Torrens]], on the present City of Adelaide Golf Links, just south of [[Strangways Terrace]], [[North Adelaide]]. All manner of pioneering equipment, rations, hardware, and clothing were issued from this store to government parties such as builders, surveyors, police, and the Protector of Aborigines. Also, to assist the pioneering population some items and rations were sold when there were general shortages.\n\nIt was always expected that the Colonial Storekeeper position would eventually become redundant when settlement became so well developed as to support commercial suppliers to government, selected by a Supply and Tender Board answerable to a Commissioner of Public Works. \n\nThomas Gilbert retired as Colonial Storekeeper on 31 December 1854<ref>[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/197666405] Evening Journal, Adelaide, South Australia.

Along with [[Thomas Lipson]], the government granted him a lifetime pension.\n\n==Postmaster==\nIn addition to his normal duties, on 10 April 1837, shortly after the Proclamation of South Australia, Thomas Gilbert was appointed by [[John Hindmarsh|Governor Hindmarsh]] as first Postmaster in South Australia, with the first post office being operated from his private residence. Thomas Gilbert was never officially given the title of Postmaster General and was granted a salary of thirty pounds per year for the Postmaster position.<ref>Burgess, H.T. (ed) : ''The Cyclopedia of South Australia''. (Adelaide 1907), Vol.1. p.268. Facsimile {{ISBN|0858722003}}</ref> He managed the post office for approximately fifteen months, at which point he lodged a grievance with the South Australian Government as he had not been paid for this role. The Government published an official censure on Gilbert and, as a result, he resigned the position of Postmaster effective 13 December 1838 but continued in his capacity as Colonial Storekeeper.<ref>The South Australian Gazette and Colonial Register \u2013 1838 (exact date not yet known)</ref> Officially, the General Post Office in Adelaide does not recognise Thomas Gilbert as the first Postmaster General and, instead, they have an oil painting of [[Charles Todd (pioneer)|Charles Todd]] as their first Postmaster General.\n\n==Civic Activity==\nGilbert was highly regarded among his fellow colonists, holding various official positions including magistrate. He was a member of the [[Street Naming Committee (Adelaide)|Street Naming Committee]] and a founding member of the South Australian Literary and Scientific Association, which was first established in London in 1834. Gilbert was also a founding member of the [[South Australian Lodge of Friendship No. 613]]. He was elected and initiated into Freemasonry the first meeting of the Lodge which was held in 1834 at the South Australian Association in London.  He later was elected Master of the Lodge of Friendship on 14 August 1838 and over the next years served a number of terms as its Master.\n\n==Death and Legacy==\nThomas Gilbert died in Adelaide, South Australia on 30 May 1873 aged 87 years of age. He is buried in [[West Terrace Cemetery]], Adelaide. On his gravestone is written \"Erected by a few colonialists in token of their sincere admiration of his honorable and generous qualities as a public officer and faithful friend\".<ref>[http://news.webshots.com/photo/2168464940013765966OWbPoT Photograph of Thomas Gilbert's gravestone].

Thomas was apprenticed to his father and worked as an instrument maker and optician in his father's businesses, variously known as Gilbert & Wright, Gilbert Wright & Hooke, Gilbert & Gilkerson, Gilbert & Co, Gilbert & Sons<ref>[https://www.antiques-atlas.com/antique/library_telescope_on_stand_-_gilbert__sons_london/as542a441], source: Antiques Atlas - notes on a George II Period library telescope on stand by Gilbert & Sons of London sold by Jason Clarke Antiques, retrieved 24 April 2020</ref>.\n\n==W&T Gilbert partnership==\nAfter his father's death Thomas Gilbert partnered with his brother, William Dormer Gilbert (1781-1844) in their business W&T Gilbert, which operated from Leadenhall Street, City of London.

John Curnin, the Observatory's astronomer, was highly critical of the Gilbert's work on the instruments and this resulted in a scandal and an investigation by the East India Company, after which Curnin was dismissed.

He arrived at [[Nepean Bay]], [[Kangaroo Island]], South Australia on 11 September 1836 with other first settlers and surveyors on the ''Cygnet'' before travelling on to the mainland to establish the Colonial Storehouse at [[Adelaide]].\n\nGilbert attended the Proclamation of South Australia at Glenelg on 28 December 1836. He is said to have proclaimed the toast: \"Mrs Hindmarsh and the Ladies\" at the event.<ref>[http://users.chariot.net.au/~neverome/index_hamley_bridge.htm The history of Hamley Bridge].

These temporary huts were built on the banks of the [[River Torrens]], on the present City of Adelaide Golf Links, just south of [[Strangways Terrace]], [[North Adelaide]]. All manner of pioneering equipment, rations, hardware, and clothing were issued from this store to government parties such as builders, surveyors, police, and the Protector of Aborigines. Also, to assist the pioneering population some items and rations were sold when there were general shortages.\n\nIt was always expected that the Colonial Storekeeper position would eventually become redundant when settlement became so well developed as to support commercial suppliers to government, selected by a Supply and Tender Board answerable to a Commissioner of Public Works. Thomas Gilbert resigned as Colonial Storekeeper on 31 December 1854<ref>[https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/197666405] Evening Journal, Adelaide, South Australia.

Thomas Gilbert was never officially given the title of Postmaster General and was granted a salary of thirty pounds per year for the Postmaster position.<ref>Burgess, H.T.

The Government published an official censure on Gilbert and, as a result, he resigned the position of Postmaster effective 13 December 1838 but continued in his capacity as Colonial Storekeeper.<ref>The South Australian Gazette and Colonial Register \u2013 1838 (exact date not yet known)</ref> Officially, the General Post Office in Adelaide does not recognise Thomas Gilbert as the first Postmaster General and, instead, they have an oil painting of [[Charles Todd (pioneer)|Charles Todd]] as their first Postmaster General.\n\n==Civic Activity==\nGilbert was highly regarded among his fellow colonists, holding various official positions including magistrate. He was a member of the [[Street Naming Committee (Adelaide)|Street Naming Committee]] and a founding member of the South Australian Literary and Scientific Association, which was first established in London in 1834. Gilbert was also a founding member of the [[South Australian Lodge of Friendship No. 613]]. He was elected and initiated into Freemasonry the first meeting of the Lodge which was held in 1834 at the South Australian Association in London.  He later was elected Master of the Lodge of Friendship on 14 August 1838 and over the next years served a number of terms as its Master.\n\nThomas Gilbert retired as Colonial Storekeeper on 31 December 1854, being replaced by John Vidal James (1820\u201397), son-in-law of Sir [[James Hurtle Fisher]]. Along with [[Thomas Lipson]], the government granted him a lifetime pension. He died on 30 May 1873 aged 87 years of age and is buried in [[West Terrace Cemetery]], Adelaide.
