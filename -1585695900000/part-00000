Medical laboratory scientists work in [[Medical laboratory|clinical laboratories]] at [[hospital]]s, reference labs, [[biotechnology]] labs and non-clinical industrial labs. FThose that work in non clinical industrial labs are often referred to as '''biomedical laboratory technologist''' ('''BLT''') in parts of the world. \n\n==Job duties==\n[[File:Lab tech.JPG|thumb|200px|MLS in his work environment]]\nMedical laboratory scientists work in all areas of the clinical laboratory, including blood banking, chemistry, hematology, immunology, histology and microbiology . They perform a full range of laboratory tests \u2013 from simple prenatal blood tests to more complex tests to uncover diseases such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and cancer. They are also responsible for confirming the accuracy of test results, and reporting laboratory findings to pathologists and other physicians. The information that a medical laboratory scientist gives to the doctor influences the medical treatment a patient will receive. Medical laboratory scientists operate complex electronic equipment, computers, and precision instruments costing millions of dollars.<ref>[http://www.ascp.org/pdf/TheMedicalTechnologistandMedicalLaboratoryTechnician.aspx] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325091551/http://www.ascp.org/pdf/TheMedicalTechnologistandMedicalLaboratoryTechnician.aspx |date=March 25, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nMedical Laboratory Scientists analyze human fluid samples using techniques available to the clinical laboratory, such as manual white blood cell differentials/counts, bone marrow counts, analysis via microscopy, and advanced analytical equipment. Medical laboratory scientists assist doctors and nurses in choosing the correct lab tests and ensure proper collection methods.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Medical laboratory scientists receive the patient specimens, analyze the specimens and report results. A pathologist may confirm a diagnostic result, but often the medical laboratory scientist is responsible for interpreting and communicating critical patient results to the physician.\n\nMedical laboratory scientists must recognize anomalies in their test results and know how to correct problems with the instrumentation. They monitor, screen, and troubleshoot analyzers featuring the latest technology available on the market. The MLS performs equipment validations, calibrations, quality controls, \"STAT\" or run-by-run assessment, statistical control of observed data, and recording normal operations. To maintain the integrity of the laboratory process, the medical laboratory scientist recognizes factors that could introduce error and rejects contaminated or sub-standard specimens, as well as investigates discrepant results.\n\nA typical laboratory performs hundreds of different tests with a number of methodologies. Common tests performed by medical laboratory scientists are [[complete blood count]] (CBC), [[comprehensive metabolic panel]] (CMP), electrolyte panel, [[liver function tests]] (LFT), renal function tests (RFT), thyroid function test (TFT), [[urinalysis]], coagulation profile, lipid profile, [[blood type]], semen analysis (for fertility and post-vasectomy studies), serological studies and routine [[Microbiology|cultures]]. In some facilities that have few [[phlebotomist]]s, or none at all, (such as in rural areas) medical laboratory scientists may perform phlebotomy on patients, as this skill is part of the clinical training.\n\nBecause medical laboratory scientists are skilled in diverse scientific disciplines, employment outside of the medical laboratory is common. Many MLS are employed in government positions such as the FDA, USDA, non-medical industrial laboratories, and manufacturing. The practical experience required to obtain the bachelor's degree in medical technology give the MLS a unique understanding of the inter-relationship between microbiological and chemical testing and the resulting clinical manifestations in clinical, scientific, and industrial settings.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and the United States, senior laboratory scientists, who are typically post-doctoral scientists, take on significantly greater clinical responsibilities in the laboratory. In the United States these scientists may function in the role of clinical laboratory directors, while in the United Kingdom they are known as consultant clinical scientists.\n\nThough clinical scientists have existed in the UK National Health Service for ~60 years, the introduction of formally trained and accredited consultant level clinical scientists is relatively new, and was introduced as part of the new Modernising Scientific Careers framework.\n\nConsultant clinical scientists are expected to provide expert scientific and clinical leadership alongside and, at the same level as, medical consultant colleagues. While specialists in healthcare science will follow protocols, procedures and clinical guidelines, consultant clinical scientists will help shape future guidelines and the implementation of new and emerging technologies to help advance patient care.\n\n==Role in the healthcare process==\nA Medical Laboratory Scientist's role is to provide accurate laboratory results in a timely manner. An estimated 70 percent of all decisions regarding a patient's diagnosis and treatment, hospital admission and discharge are based on laboratory test results.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acla.com/importance-of-clinical-lab-testing-highlighted-during-medical-lab-professionals-week/|title=Importance of Clinical Lab Testing Highlighted During Medical Lab Professionals Week|last=|first=|date=2014-04-17|website=American Clinical Laboratory Association|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-17}}</ref>\n\nin the United Kingdom, Healthcare Scientists including Clinical Scientists may intervene throughout entire care pathways from diagnostic tests to therapeutic treatments and rehabilitation.  Although this workforce comprises approximately 5% of the healthcare workforce in the UK, their work underpins 80% of all diagnoses and clinical decisions made.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/careers-in-healthcare-science|title=Careers in Healthcare Science|website=www.nshcs.hee.nhs.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Specialty areas==\nMany Medical Laboratory Scientists are ''generalists'', skilled in most areas of the clinical laboratory. However some are specialists, qualified by unique undergraduate education or additional training to perform more complex analyses than usual within a specific field. Specialties include [[clinical chemistry|clinical biochemistry]], [[hematology]], [[coagulation]], [[microbiology]], [[bacteriology]], [[toxicology]], [[virology]], [[parasitology]], [[mycology]], [[immunology]], [[immunohematology]] ([[blood bank]]), [[histopathology]], [[histocompatibility]], [[cytopathology]], [[genetics]], [[cytogenetics]], [[electron microscopy]], and [[IVF]] labs. Medical Technologists specialty may use additional credentials, such as \"SBB\" (Specialist in Blood Banking) from the American Association of Blood Banks, \"SM\" (Specialist in Microbiology) from the American Society for Microbiology, \"SC\" (Specialist in Chemistry) from the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, or \"SH\" (Specialist in Hematology) from the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP). These additional notations may be appended to the base credential, for example, \"MLS(ASCP)SBB\".<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.ascp.org/content/docs/default-source/boc-pdfs/verification_credentials/cmp_guide-to-the-citation-of-ascp-boc-credentials.pdf?sfvrsn=12|title = Guide to The Citation of ASCP Board of Certification Credentials|website = ASCP Board of Certification|date = July 2017}}</ref> Additional information can be found in the ASCP Procedures for Examination & Certification.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ascp.org/pdf/boc-pdfs/procedures/examination-procedures.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208051356/http://www.ascp.org/pdf/boc-pdfs/procedures/examination-procedures.pdf |archive-date=2015-12-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAndrology Laboratory Scientist, Embryology Laboratory Scientist, and Molecular Diagnostics Technologist certifications are provided by the American Association of Bioanalysts; those with the certifications are classified as ALS(AAB), ELS(AAB), and MDxT(AAB) respectively.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.aab.org/aab/Certification-Qualifications.asp|title=BOR Certification/Qualifications - ABOR|website=ABOR|access-date=2016-10-18}}</ref> Certified Histocompatibility Associate, Certified Histocompatibility Technologist, Certified Histocompatibility Specialist, and Diplomate of the ABHI are titles granted by the American Board of Hisocompatibility and Immunogenetics after meeting education and experience requirements and passing the required examination; those individuals would hold the credentials CHA(ABHI), CHT(ABHI), CHS(AHBI), and D(ABHI) upon passing the corresponding examination.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref>http://www.ashi-hla.org/images/uploads/ABHIhandbookJanuary2015CM1.pdf{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, Medical Laboratory Scientists can be certified and employed in [[infection control]]. These professionals monitor and report infectious disease findings to help limit [[iatrogenic]] and [[nosocomial infections]]. They may also educate other healthcare workers about such problems and ways to minimize them.<ref>[http://www.cbic.org/certification/candidate-handbook/eligibility-requirements Infection Control Certification]</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom the number of Clinical Scientists in a pathology discipline are typically greater, where less medically qualified pathologists train as consultants. Clinical Biochemistry, Clinical Immunology and Genomic Medicine are specialities with an abundance of UK Clinical Scientists, and where the role is well established. Infection services in the United Kingdom are generally undertaken by medically qualified Microbiologists, who may have overall responsibility for laboratory services in addition to Infection Prevention and Control responsibilities, and may be required to contribute to ward rounds and patient clinics. Therefore, the Royal College of Pathologists and Royal College of Physicians have developed Combined Infection Training[10], that medical trainees gain a much more patient focused experience, and undertake Physician examinations in addition to Pathology training. The end result of this is that several regional medical deaneries no longer permit Medical Doctors to train in Microbiology or Virology as single disciplines, and instead advocate dual-specialisation as Infectious Disease/Microbiology or Infectious Disease/Virology [11]. Simultaneously the expansion of higher specialist scientist trainees in microbiology mean that many of the laboratory and scientific responsibilities of medical doctors may be taken on my Clinical Scientists, and medical doctors will instead be expected to perform a much more patient facing role. The exception in Microbiology is the sub-discipline of Virology, which is well suited to the expertise of clinical scientists due to reliance on cutting edge scientific methods, increasing use of specialised genetic technologies, and a technical understanding of virus biology, with a reduced emphasis on patient management compared with Microbiology as a whole[12].\n\nIt is therefore likely that many patients in UK hospitals may come into contact with Clinical Scientists working in a patient facing speciality, who may be confused with medical doctors due to the complex nature of their role.\n\n==Educational requirements==\nEducational and licensing requirements vary by country due to differing scopes of practice and legislative differences.\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn Australia, medical laboratory scientists complete a four-year undergraduate degree program in medical laboratory science or Master of Medical Laboratory science . These programs should be accredited by the Australian Institute of Medical Scientists (AIMS).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aims.org.au/services/accredited-degrees|title=Undergraduate Courses|last=|first=|date=|website=Australian Institute of Medical Scientists|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Canada ===\nIn Canada, three-year college or technical school programs are offered that include seven semesters, two of them comprising an unpaid internship.

University of Lahore, University of Faisalabad, University of Sargodha and Superior University Lahore offering 5-years Doctor of Medical Lab Sciences (DMLS) Program; Eligibility criteria for 4 years BS Medical Lab Sciences and 5 years Doctor of Medical Lab Sciences (DMLS) is F.Sc Pre-Medical. \n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nih.org.pk/college-of-medical-laboratory-technology-cmlt/|title=College of Medical Laboratory Technology (CMLT)|website=National Institute of Health Islamabad}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uhs.edu.pk/academics/ahs.php|title=University of Health Sciences Lahore|website=www.uhs.edu.pk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://mlt.uol.edu.pk/Programs/Undergraduate/Doctor-of-Medical-Laboratory-Sciences|title=Doctor of Medical Laboratory Sciences|website=mlt.uol.edu.pk}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, a medical laboratory scientist (MLS), medical technologist (MT), or a clinical laboratory scientist (CLS) typically earns a [[bachelor's degree]] in medical laboratory science, clinical laboratory science, or medical technology.  Other routes include attaining a degree in biomedical science or in a life / biological science (biology, biochemistry, microbiology, etc.). Both routes typically requires the MLS/MT/CLS to obtain certification from a national certifying board (AAB, AMT, or ASCP) as most laboratories exceed the federal minimum requirements established by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA).\n\nCommon comprehensive Medical laboratory scientist degree programs are set up in a few different ways. \n* In 3+1 programs, the student attends classroom courses for three years and complete a clinical rotation their final year of study. \n* In 2+2 programs, students have already completed their lower division coursework and return to complete their last two years of study in a CLS program.  \n* In 4+1 program, students who have already completed an undergraduate program return to complete a year of medical laboratory training. The training is typically completed at a clinical site rather than a college.\nThe core curriculum in medical technology generally comprises 20 credits in clinical chemistry, 20 credits in hematology, and 20 credits in clinical microbiology.\n\nDuring clinical rotations, the student experiences hands-on learning in each discipline of the laboratory and performs diagnostic testing in a functioning laboratory under supervision. With limited or no compensation, a student in the clinical phase of training usually works 40 hours per week for 20 to 52 weeks. Some programs in the United States have had the time students spend completing their clinical rotation reduced due to staffing shortages. For example, in 2015, the MLS program at the University of Minnesota reduced the clinical rotation portion of the program from 22 weeks to 12 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aacc.org/publications/cln/articles/2015/november/the-laboratory-workforce-shortage-demands-new-solutions|title=The Laboratory Workforce Shortage Demands New Solutions|last=Scott|first=Kimberly|date=2015-11-01|website=AACC|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-13}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, a two-year academic program ([[associate's degree]]) qualifies the graduate to work as a medical laboratory technician (MLT). MLTs receive training more exclusively in laboratory sciences without the basic science coursework often required by MLS programs; however, there are many MLT training programs that require substantial basic didactic science course work prior to entry into a clinical practicum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/connect/the-hidden-profession-that-saves-lives|title=The hidden profession that saves lives|last=Rohde|first=Rodney|date=2014-02-11|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-13}}</ref>  Although the didactic coursework may be less for the MLT, the clinical practicum, in many cases, is similar to that of the MLS student's. This equates to MLTs who are well equipped to enter the work force with relevant and knowledge based practical application.  The shorter training time may be attractive to many students, but there are disadvantages to this route. MTs, MLSs and CLSs usually earn higher salaries and have more responsibilities than MLTs.  In 2018, medical laboratory technicians earned an average salary of $51,219, while medical laboratory scientists earned a salary of $67,888.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.salary.com/research/salary/benchmark/medical-laboratory-technician-salary|title=Medical Laboratory Technician Salary|first=Site built by|last=Salary.com|website=Salary.com}}</ref> An added disadvantage for MLTs is that some institutions will only employ MLSs, although that practice is starting to change due to recent efforts in cost reduction, and due to staffing shortages.\n\nIn practice, the term ''medical laboratory technician'' may apply to persons who are trained to operate equipment and perform tests, usually under the supervision of the certified medical technologist or laboratory scientist. Depending on the state where employment is granted, the job duties between MLSs and MLTs may or may not be similar. For example, in Florida, a MLT may only perform highly complex testing while under the direct supervision of a clinical laboratory technologist, a clinical laboratory supervisor, or a clinical laboratory director.<ref>[http://www.fshgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Rules-and-Regulations-2014-NT.pdf Board of Clinical Laboratory Personnel]</ref> This may make it impractical for a MLT to lawfully work in a Florida blood bank. California has similar restrictions on MLTs. To accommodate California's restrictions, the American Association of Bioanalysts (AAB) developed a separate certification examination for California licensure. However, this exam does not include material covering the areas of immunohematology or microscopy.<ref>https://www.aab.org/aab/California_CLS_and_MLT.asp ABOR Certification California</ref>  Although the typical entry-level academic requirement for most MLTs is an associate degree, a 60 credit certificate program exists through military training programs; such as the U.S. Army's 68K military occupational specialty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/browse-career-and-job-categories/medical-and-emergency/medical-laboratory-specialist.html|title=Medical Laboratory Specialist|last=|first=|date=|website=Go Army|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-17}}</ref>\n\nAs in other countries, staffing shortages have become a major issue in many clinical laboratories in the United States.  Due to several factors, including boomer retirement, and inadequate recruitment and retention efforts, the medical laboratory workforce is shrinking. For the decade 2010\u20132020, workforce needs are expected to grow by 13%.  This translates into about 11,300 positions per year that will need to be filled, with only about 5000 new graduates per year coming out of various programs.  By 2025, it is estimated that the shortage of medical laboratory professionals will reach 98,700 in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/04/news/economy/health-care-workers-shortage/index.html|title=The US can't keep up with demand for health aides, nurses and doctors|first=Parija|last=Kavilanz|date=May 4, 2018|website=CNNMoney}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.labtestingmatters.org/responding-to-the-continuing-personnel-shortages-in-laboratory-medicine/|title=Responding to the Continuing Personnel Shortages in Laboratory Medicine|date=April 4, 2017|website=Lab Testing Matters}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the United Kingdom (UK) there are two varieties of registered healthcare scientist in hospitals - Clinical Scientists and Biomedical Scientists (BMS). There is a strict and formal post graduate training programme for both careers followed by statutory registration for each with the Health & Care Professions Council UK (HCPC):[1], for the safety and assurance of the customers - the patients. They are two similar but distinct careers with parallel but different training paths and different entry requirements.\n\nThe role of Clinical Scientists is to improve the health and well-being of patients and the public by practising alongside doctors, nurses, and other health and social care professionals in the delivery of healthcare. Their aim is to provide expert scientific and clinical advice to clinician colleagues, to aid in the diagnosis, treatment and management of patient care.\n\n'''Examples of the type of work they undertake include:'''\n\n* Advising, diagnosing, interpreting, and treating patients.\n* Advising health and social care professionals in the diagnosis and treatment of patients.\n* Researching the science, technology, and practise used in healthcare to innovate and improve services.\n* Designing, building, and operating technology for diagnosing and treating patients.\n* Ensuring the safety and reliability of tests and equipment used in healthcare.\n\nTrainee Clinical Scientist posts are advertised nationally, usually between November and February on the Clinical Scientists Recruitment webpages where application forms may be obtained and electronic submission of applications can be made. These posts are for the approved Pre-registration Training Programme, designed to prepare entrants for higher professional qualifications, further clinical training and eventual Consultant responsibility.\n\nClinical Scientist training involves enrolment of graduates (1st or 2nd class honours degree or better is essential due to the high competition for limited training places) into an intensive 3-year training scheme leading to certification and eventual registration before starting the higher career structure. The basic qualification for becoming a Clinical Biochemist, Clinical Immunologist or Clinical Microbiologist is a good Honours degree in an appropriate subject: for Clinical Biochemistry, that subject might be Biochemistry or Chemistry (or another life science subject which contains a substantial Biochemistry component); for Clinical Immunology, that subject might be any life science degree with an immunology component; for Clinical Microbiology that subject might be any life science degree with a microbiology component.\n\nAlthough not essential, some candidates will apply with higher degrees in an attempt to improve their chances of selection for training and several universities currently offer MSc courses in Clinical Biochemistry, Immunology and Microbiology which have been approved by the ACB or the AHCS. Full-time and 'sandwich' courses are available, and further information may be obtained from individual programmes, although the level of financial support provided varies, and should be clarified at interview. Some entrants to the profession will already have obtained a PhD, and the training and research experience that this provides is invaluable to the work of the Clinical Scientist. In larger Departments, there may be opportunities to study for a research degree after entering the profession and acquiring registration, but since this has to be fitted in with other responsibilities, it may take some years to complete. It should be clearly understood that the major role of the profession is patient care and that research, management and all the other aspects will come as side issues and not be the predominating factor in the career path. The work of Biomedical Scientists and Clinical Scientists have impact on the diagnosis and treatment of almost every patient admitted to hospitals in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe United Kingdom is facing a shortage of qualified Clinical and Biomedical Scientists.  The Royal College of Pathologists and the Royal College of Physicians have pointed out the need for increased government funding for medical training programs to prevent diagnostic facilities and medical infrastructure from being overwhelmed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.darkdaily.com/pathologists-and-physicians-in-united-kingdom-comment-on-how-shortage-of-medical-laboratory-professionals-could-soon-delay-essential-diagnostic-therapeutic-testing-206/|title=UK's Pathology Laboratories Face Staffing Shortage &#124; Dark Daily}}</ref>\n\n===Nigeria===\nIn Nigeria, Medical Laboratory Science is a high skilled profession charged by Act. 2004 Cap 114 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria. The initial qualification awarded graduates of the programme, like some other medical programmes, was Associate of the Institute of Medical Laboratory Technology/Science (AIMLT/AIMLS)\nThe Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria, which was established by Act. 2004 Cap 114 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, regulates the practice of Medical Laboratory Science in Nigeria. In Nigeria, the Medical Laboratory Science programme is Bachelor of Medical Laboratory Science (BMLS), regulated by National Universities Commission (NUC) and by the Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria (MLSCN). Students at their first year (100 level) are trained under the Faculty of Science in Basic Sciences and Faculty of Arts, Management and Social science in General studies and Entrepreneurship. At the 200 level, students are taught basic medical sciences and are introduced to Medical Laboratory Science. The third year of the programme marks the beginning of the professional training as students are engaged in the classroom for lectures as well as in the Hospital laboratory for the professional or practical training. At the fourth year students are taught the basics in all the special areas of Medical Laboratory Science. At the end of 400 level programme, successful students are presented for the First professional examination, to be moderated by  the Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria  At the fifth year, students break into 4 core or specialized areas of Medical Laboratory Science, namely: medical microbiology/parasitology, chemical pathology/immunology, haematology/blood transfusion science and histopathology/cytopathology.

They are the American Association of Bioanalysts (AAB), the American Medical Technologists (AMT), and the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP).

The HCPC registers nearly 200,000 healthcare professionals[3] and while success in an approved degree course from an accredited University is sufficient for all other professions, both clinical scientists and biomedical scientists have post graduate training and no approved degree courses. Autonomous assessment of applicants in these two professions with subsequent certification for successful ones, is the only approved UK route to registration for them.\n\n\"Clinical Scientist\", just as \"Biomedical Scientist\", is a protected title under the law (there is a \u00a35000 fine for transgressors who fraudulently use the title without being registered by the state). The HCPC can strike people off the register for malpractice in just the same way as for doctors with the General Medical Council (GMC).\n\nThose who are working in \"Trainee\" positions in the profession are permitted to use the title with an appropriate caveat, for example \u2013 \"Pre-registration Clinical Scientist\", Trainee Clinical Scientist, etc. Alternatively some may use titles specific to the discipline they train in, such as Trainee Clinical Biochemist\", \"Clinical Immunologist in Training\" or \u201c Pre-Registrant Clinical Microbiologist\u201d which is also perfectly acceptable since it is not implying the protected \"Clinical Scientist\" title of fully qualified and registered practitioners. It is against the law to formally work with the title of \u201cClinical Scientist\u201d without professional registration[4].\n\n'''Nigeria'''\n\nIn Nigeria successful student at the end of the training in both academic and professional assessments with respect to  the  graduation requirements is certified by the respective University, inducted and licensed by the Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria  after a successful internship training. <nowiki>http://mlscn.gov.ng</nowiki>\n\n== Further education ==\nAs in many healthcare professions, a Medical Laboratory Scientist may pursue higher education to advance or further specialize in their career.\n*[[Master of Science]], [[Master of Business Administration]], [[Master of Health Administration]], [[Doctor of medical laboratory science]] for specialization, education and management roles.\n*[[Doctor of Philosophy]] for management and directorship roles in the clinical laboratory as well as for academic research and professorship.

In its conception it aimed to provide a coherent framework that was accessible, affordable and designed specifically to both capture scientific and technological advances and to provide improved outcomes for patients, the service and professionals. A key aspect of the framework from the start was the formalisation of training to develop talented clinical scientists to undertake quality assured Higher Specialist Scientist Training (HSST) programmes to prepare them for roles as Consultant Clinical Scientists. It is envisaged that Consultant Clinical Scientists will work synergistically and in partnership with their medical colleagues and within multiprofessional clinical teams to support clinical scientific practice aimed at quality improvement, innovation and world-class outcomes for patients. This scientific expertise and leadership will provide important benefits and added value to patients and to the service as it moves forward through the 21st century. This will bring to fruition the vision of science and realise the potential of scientific and technological advances for both translational and personalised medicine.\n\nTraining through the Higher Specialist Scientist Training pathway is discipline specific. For life science disciplines (Immunology, Microbiology, Virology, Haematology, Biochemistry) the training curriculum and formal examinations are administered by the Royal College of Pathologists. The life science training pathway for Clinical Scientists follows a similar pathway to that undertaken by medically qualified specialist registrars in pathology. Clinical Scientists are therefore the only discipline of non-medical healthcare professionals examined by a Medical Royal College. Clinical Scientists who attain both part 1 examination certification and part 2 certification are awarded Fellowship of the Royal College of Pathologists (FRCPath) and are deemed to have the knowledge and expertise expected of a consultant level scientist. Consultant Clinical Scientist posts generally require candidates to have completed FRCPath qualification to be eligible.\n\nAll Clinical Scientists regardless of seniority or specialisation may have other responsibilities including academic appointments, responsibilities as clinical lead for a pathology service, or may have wider hospital responsibilities such as Directorship of Infection Prevention and Control, or responsibility for the hospital's Research and Development strategy. Junior clinical scientists may become involved in academic research, working towards award of a Ph.D. or DClinSci\n\n==Job title==\n[[File:Pn-lab-2001nov.jpg|thumb|right|Russian MLS prepares the analyses in ELISA laboratory]]\nThe informal abbreviations of job titles may be a source of confusion. In the United States Medical Laboratory Scientist (ASCP) and Medical Technologists (AMT) or (AAB) are often called \"med techs\" (based on the era in which they were known as \"medical technologists\"), but this shorthand term is shared by other healthcare employees, including [[pharmacy technician|pharmacy techs]], [[radiographers]] (also known as radiologic technologists), and [[respiratory therapists]].\n\nIn the United States there is a formal distinction between an MLT and a MT/MLS. Often, MT/MLS have at least a bachelor's degree, while MLT have an associate degree. However, due to grandfathering rules and certification requirements between the boards of registry, some MT/MLS may only have an associate degree.<ref>https://www.aab.org/aab/MT.asp ABOR Certification</ref>  Scientists and technologists generally earn a higher income than technicians, have more responsibilities, and have more opportunities for advancement.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, there are defined training pathways leading to professional registration as either a Clinical Scientist, or as a Biomedical Scientist. The role descriptions for these healthcare scientists are very different, where clinical scientists generally undertake non-routine research and development, as well as improving and providing clinical service using scientific expertise. Biomedical Scientists in the United Kingdom are similar to the role of MLT and MT/CLS described above, and have similar regulatory requirements for professional regulation. Clinical Scientists in the United Kingdom may struggle with a lack of professional recognition. This is in part due to the myriad job titles used to describe them including Clinical Physiologists, Medical Physicists, and Clinical Biochemists, which generally mean the public and other healthcare workers assume Clinical Scientists to be medically qualified doctors, due to the sometimes complex nature of the role.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Laboratory centrifuge]]\n*[[Laboratory information system]]\n*[[Medical technology]]\n*[[Medical laboratory]]\n*[[Phlebotomist]]\n*[[Reference ranges for common blood tests]]\n*[[Urine test]]\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Allied health professions]]\n*[[Automated analyser]]\n*[[Blood bank]]\n*[[Blood test]]\n*[[Biomedical Scientist]] similar career outside of the US\n*[[Body fluids]]\n*[[Clinical pathology]]\n*[[ISO 15189]]\n{{col-break}}{{col-end}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.csmls.org Canadian Society for medical Laboratory Science]\n*[http://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/medical-and-clinical-laboratory-technologists-and-technicians.htm U.S. Department of Labor information on Clinical Laboratory Technologists and Technicians]\n*[http://www.aacc.org/ American Association for Clinical Chemistry]\n*[http://www.ascp.org/ American Society of Clinical Pathology]\n*[http://www.ascls.org/ American Society of Clinical Laboratory Science]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120624052406/http://www.nca-info.org/ National Credentialing Agency for Laboratory Personnel]\n*[http://www.naacls.org/ National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Science]\n*[http://www.labce.com/medical_technologist.aspx Medical Technologist Continuing Education]\n*[http://www.aims.org.au/c/ AIMS: Australian Institute of Medical Scientists]\n*[http://www.nzimls.org.nz/ New Zealand Institute of Medical Laboratory Science]\n*[http://www.petie.gr/ Greek Association of Medical Laboratory Technologists]\n*[https://www.med.unc.edu/ahs/clinical/files/clsatwork2001.pdf Clinical Laboratory Scientists at Work]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Allied health professions}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Health care occupations]]\n[[Category:Science occupations]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Healthcare professional who works in the laboratory}}\n{{globalize|date=June 2015}}\n{{Infobox Occupation\n| name=Medical laboratory scientist\n| image= [[File:Medical Laboratory Scientist US NIH.jpg|250px]]\n| caption= A medical laboratory scientist at the [[National Institutes of Health]] preparing DNA samples.\n| official_names=\n\n*Medical Laboratory Scientist (MLS) / Clinical Laboratory Scientist (CLS) / Medical Laboratory Technologist (MLT) / Medical Technologist (MT) \n*Doctor of Medical Laboratory Science ( DMLS )\n\n<!------------Details------------------->\n\n| activity_sector= [[Health care]], [[Research & Development]], [[Allied Health]], [[Biomedical research]]\n| competencies= Analytical skills, quality control and knowledge of laboratory medicine and technology.\n| formation=\n*[[Doctor of Philosophy]] for Management/Directorship Roles\n*Doctor of Medical Laboratory Sciences (DMLS) for Management/Directorship Roles\n*[[Master of Science]] often for Education/Management Roles\n*[[Honours degree]] in Laboratory Science (Scientist)\n*[[Bachelor of Science]] in Medical Laboratory Science (Scientist)\n*[[Doctor of Medical Laboratory Science ]] \n( Doctor )\n\n| employment= \n*[[Hospital]]\n*[[Clinic]]\n*Private laboratory\n*Government agency\n*Non-Governmental Organization\n*Biomedical Engineer\n*Biomedical technology industry\n| related occupations=\n*[[Pathologist]]\n*Cyto- and Histotechnologist\n*[[Haemtologist]]\n*[[Phlebotomist]]}}\n\nA '''medical laboratory scientist''' ('''MLS'''), also traditionally referred to as a '''clinical laboratory scientist''' ('''CLS'''), or '''medical technologist''' ('''MT''') or '''medical laboratory techonologist''' ('''MLT'''), is a [[healthcare professional]] who performs [[biochemistry|chemical]], [[hematology|hematological]], [[immunology|immunologic]], [[histopathological]], [[Cytopathology|cytopathological]], [[microscopy|microscopic]], and [[microbiology|bacteriological]] [[medical diagnosis|diagnostic]] analyses on [[body fluids]] such as [[blood]], [[urine]], [[sputum]], [[feces|stool]], [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF), [[peritoneal fluid]], [[pericardial fluid]], and [[synovial fluid]], as well as other specimens. Medical laboratory scientists work in [[Medical laboratory|clinical laboratories]] at [[hospital]]s, reference labs, [[biotechnology]] labs and non-clinical industrial labs. FThose that work in non clinical industrial labs are often referred to as '''biomedical laboratory technologist''' ('''BLT''') in parts of the world. \n\n==Job duties==\n[[File:Lab tech.JPG|thumb|200px|MLS in his work environment]]\nMedical laboratory scientists work in all areas of the clinical laboratory, including blood banking, chemistry, hematology, immunology, histology and microbiology . They perform a full range of laboratory tests \u2013 from simple prenatal blood tests to more complex tests to uncover diseases such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and cancer. They are also responsible for confirming the accuracy of test results, and reporting laboratory findings to pathologists and other physicians. The information that a medical laboratory scientist gives to the doctor influences the medical treatment a patient will receive. Medical laboratory scientists operate complex electronic equipment, computers, and precision instruments costing millions of dollars.<ref>[http://www.ascp.org/pdf/TheMedicalTechnologistandMedicalLaboratoryTechnician.aspx] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325091551/http://www.ascp.org/pdf/TheMedicalTechnologistandMedicalLaboratoryTechnician.aspx |date=March 25, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nMedical Laboratory Scientists analyze human fluid samples using techniques available to the clinical laboratory, such as manual white blood cell differentials/counts, bone marrow counts, analysis via microscopy, and advanced analytical equipment. Medical laboratory scientists assist doctors and nurses in choosing the correct lab tests and ensure proper collection methods.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Medical laboratory scientists receive the patient specimens, analyze the specimens and report results. A pathologist may confirm a diagnostic result, but often the medical laboratory scientist is responsible for interpreting and communicating critical patient results to the physician.\n\nMedical laboratory scientists must recognize anomalies in their test results and know how to correct problems with the instrumentation. They monitor, screen, and troubleshoot analyzers featuring the latest technology available on the market. The MLS performs equipment validations, calibrations, quality controls, \"STAT\" or run-by-run assessment, statistical control of observed data, and recording normal operations. To maintain the integrity of the laboratory process, the medical laboratory scientist recognizes factors that could introduce error and rejects contaminated or sub-standard specimens, as well as investigates discrepant results.\n\nA typical laboratory performs hundreds of different tests with a number of methodologies. Common tests performed by medical laboratory scientists are [[complete blood count]] (CBC), [[comprehensive metabolic panel]] (CMP), electrolyte panel, [[liver function tests]] (LFT), renal function tests (RFT), thyroid function test (TFT), [[urinalysis]], coagulation profile, lipid profile, [[blood type]], semen analysis (for fertility and post-vasectomy studies), serological studies and routine [[Microbiology|cultures]]. In some facilities that have few [[phlebotomist]]s, or none at all, (such as in rural areas) medical laboratory scientists may perform phlebotomy on patients, as this skill is part of the clinical training.\n\nBecause medical laboratory scientists are skilled in diverse scientific disciplines, employment outside of the medical laboratory is common. Many MLS are employed in government positions such as the FDA, USDA, non-medical industrial laboratories, and manufacturing. The practical experience required to obtain the bachelor's degree in medical technology give the MLS a unique understanding of the inter-relationship between microbiological and chemical testing and the resulting clinical manifestations in clinical, scientific, and industrial settings.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and the United States, senior laboratory scientists, who are typically post-doctoral scientists, take on significantly greater clinical responsibilities in the laboratory. In the United States these scientists may function in the role of clinical laboratory directors, while in the United Kingdom they are known as consultant clinical scientists.\n\nThough clinical scientists have existed in the UK National Health Service for ~60 years, the introduction of formally trained and accredited consultant level clinical scientists is relatively new, and was introduced as part of the new Modernising Scientific Careers framework.\n\nConsultant clinical scientists are expected to provide expert scientific and clinical leadership alongside and, at the same level as, medical consultant colleagues. While specialists in healthcare science will follow protocols, procedures and clinical guidelines, consultant clinical scientists will help shape future guidelines and the implementation of new and emerging technologies to help advance patient care.\n\n==Role in the healthcare process==\nA Medical Laboratory Scientist's role is to provide accurate laboratory results in a timely manner. An estimated 70 percent of all decisions regarding a patient's diagnosis and treatment, hospital admission and discharge are based on laboratory test results.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acla.com/importance-of-clinical-lab-testing-highlighted-during-medical-lab-professionals-week/|title=Importance of Clinical Lab Testing Highlighted During Medical Lab Professionals Week|last=|first=|date=2014-04-17|website=American Clinical Laboratory Association|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-17}}</ref>\n\nin the United Kingdom, Healthcare Scientists including Clinical Scientists may intervene throughout entire care pathways from diagnostic tests to therapeutic treatments and rehabilitation.  Although this workforce comprises approximately 5% of the healthcare workforce in the UK, their work underpins 80% of all diagnoses and clinical decisions made.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nshcs.hee.nhs.uk/careers-in-healthcare-science|title=Careers in Healthcare Science|website=www.nshcs.hee.nhs.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Specialty areas==\nMany Medical Laboratory Scientists are ''generalists'', skilled in most areas of the clinical laboratory. However some are specialists, qualified by unique undergraduate education or additional training to perform more complex analyses than usual within a specific field. Specialties include [[clinical chemistry|clinical biochemistry]], [[hematology]], [[coagulation]], [[microbiology]], [[bacteriology]], [[toxicology]], [[virology]], [[parasitology]], [[mycology]], [[immunology]], [[immunohematology]] ([[blood bank]]), [[histopathology]], [[histocompatibility]], [[cytopathology]], [[genetics]], [[cytogenetics]], [[electron microscopy]], and [[IVF]] labs. Medical Technologists specialty may use additional credentials, such as \"SBB\" (Specialist in Blood Banking) from the American Association of Blood Banks, \"SM\" (Specialist in Microbiology) from the American Society for Microbiology, \"SC\" (Specialist in Chemistry) from the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, or \"SH\" (Specialist in Hematology) from the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP).

Clinical Biochemistry, Clinical Immunology and Genomic Medicine are specialities with an abundance of UK Clinical Scientists, and where the role is well established. Infection services in the United Kingdom are generally undertaken by medically qualified Microbiologists, who may have overall responsibility for laboratory services in addition to Infection Prevention and Control responsibilities, and may be required to contribute to ward rounds and patient clinics. Therefore, the Royal College of Pathologists and Royal College of Physicians have developed Combined Infection Training[10], that medical trainees gain a much more patient focused experience, and undertake Physician examinations in addition to Pathology training. The end result of this is that several regional medical deaneries no longer permit Medical Doctors to train in Microbiology or Virology as single disciplines, and instead advocate dual-specialisation as Infectious Disease/Microbiology or Infectious Disease/Virology [11]. Simultaneously the expansion of higher specialist scientist trainees in microbiology mean that many of the laboratory and scientific responsibilities of medical doctors may be taken on my Clinical Scientists, and medical doctors will instead be expected to perform a much more patient facing role. The exception in Microbiology is the sub-discipline of Virology, which is well suited to the expertise of clinical scientists due to reliance on cutting edge scientific methods, increasing use of specialised genetic technologies, and a technical understanding of virus biology, with a reduced emphasis on patient management compared with Microbiology as a whole[12].\n\nIt is therefore likely that many patients in UK hospitals may come into contact with Clinical Scientists working in a patient facing speciality, who may be confused with medical doctors due to the complex nature of their role.\n\n==Educational requirements==\nEducational and licensing requirements vary by country due to differing scopes of practice and legislative differences.\n\n=== Australia ===\nIn Australia, medical laboratory scientists complete a four-year undergraduate degree program in medical laboratory science or Master of Medical Laboratory science .

Other routes include attaining a degree in biomedical science or in a life / biological science (biology, biochemistry, microbiology, etc.). Both routes typically requires the MLS/MT/CLS to obtain certification from a national certifying board (AAB, AMT, or ASCP) as most laboratories exceed the federal minimum requirements established by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA).\n\nCommon comprehensive Medical laboratory scientist degree programs are set up in a few different ways. \n* In 3+1 programs, the student attends classroom courses for three years and complete a clinical rotation their final year of study. \n* In 2+2 programs, students have already completed their lower division coursework and return to complete their last two years of study in a CLS program.  \n* In 4+1 program, students who have already completed an undergraduate program return to complete a year of medical laboratory training. The training is typically completed at a clinical site rather than a college.\nThe core curriculum in medical technology generally comprises 20 credits in clinical chemistry, 20 credits in hematology, and 20 credits in clinical microbiology.\n\nDuring clinical rotations, the student experiences hands-on learning in each discipline of the laboratory and performs diagnostic testing in a functioning laboratory under supervision. With limited or no compensation, a student in the clinical phase of training usually works 40 hours per week for 20 to 52 weeks. Some programs in the United States have had the time students spend completing their clinical rotation reduced due to staffing shortages. For example, in 2015, the MLS program at the University of Minnesota reduced the clinical rotation portion of the program from 22 weeks to 12 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aacc.org/publications/cln/articles/2015/november/the-laboratory-workforce-shortage-demands-new-solutions|title=The Laboratory Workforce Shortage Demands New Solutions|last=Scott|first=Kimberly|date=2015-11-01|website=AACC|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-13}}</ref>\n\nIn the United States, a two-year academic program ([[associate's degree]]) qualifies the graduate to work as a medical laboratory technician (MLT). MLTs receive training more exclusively in laboratory sciences without the basic science coursework often required by MLS programs; however, there are many MLT training programs that require substantial basic didactic science course work prior to entry into a clinical practicum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elsevier.com/connect/the-hidden-profession-that-saves-lives|title=The hidden profession that saves lives|last=Rohde|first=Rodney|date=2014-02-11|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-13}}</ref>  Although the didactic coursework may be less for the MLT, the clinical practicum, in many cases, is similar to that of the MLS student's. This equates to MLTs who are well equipped to enter the work force with relevant and knowledge based practical application.  The shorter training time may be attractive to many students, but there are disadvantages to this route. MTs, MLSs and CLSs usually earn higher salaries and have more responsibilities than MLTs.  In 2018, medical laboratory technicians earned an average salary of $51,219, while medical laboratory scientists earned a salary of $67,888.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.salary.com/research/salary/benchmark/medical-laboratory-technician-salary|title=Medical Laboratory Technician Salary|first=Site built by|last=Salary.com|website=Salary.com}}</ref> An added disadvantage for MLTs is that some institutions will only employ MLSs, although that practice is starting to change due to recent efforts in cost reduction, and due to staffing shortages.\n\nIn practice, the term ''medical laboratory technician'' may apply to persons who are trained to operate equipment and perform tests, usually under the supervision of the certified medical technologist or laboratory scientist. Depending on the state where employment is granted, the job duties between MLSs and MLTs may or may not be similar. For example, in Florida, a MLT may only perform highly complex testing while under the direct supervision of a clinical laboratory technologist, a clinical laboratory supervisor, or a clinical laboratory director.<ref>[http://www.fshgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Rules-and-Regulations-2014-NT.pdf Board of Clinical Laboratory Personnel]</ref> This may make it impractical for a MLT to lawfully work in a Florida blood bank. California has similar restrictions on MLTs. To accommodate California's restrictions, the American Association of Bioanalysts (AAB) developed a separate certification examination for California licensure. However, this exam does not include material covering the areas of immunohematology or microscopy.<ref>https://www.aab.org/aab/California_CLS_and_MLT.asp ABOR Certification California</ref>  Although the typical entry-level academic requirement for most MLTs is an associate degree, a 60 credit certificate program exists through military training programs; such as the U.S. Army's 68K military occupational specialty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/browse-career-and-job-categories/medical-and-emergency/medical-laboratory-specialist.html|title=Medical Laboratory Specialist|last=|first=|date=|website=Go Army|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-17}}</ref>\n\nAs in other countries, staffing shortages have become a major issue in many clinical laboratories in the United States.  Due to several factors, including boomer retirement, and inadequate recruitment and retention efforts, the medical laboratory workforce is shrinking. For the decade 2010\u20132020, workforce needs are expected to grow by 13%.  This translates into about 11,300 positions per year that will need to be filled, with only about 5000 new graduates per year coming out of various programs.  By 2025, it is estimated that the shortage of medical laboratory professionals will reach 98,700 in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/04/news/economy/health-care-workers-shortage/index.html|title=The US can't keep up with demand for health aides, nurses and doctors|first=Parija|last=Kavilanz|date=May 4, 2018|website=CNNMoney}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.labtestingmatters.org/responding-to-the-continuing-personnel-shortages-in-laboratory-medicine/|title=Responding to the Continuing Personnel Shortages in Laboratory Medicine|date=April 4, 2017|website=Lab Testing Matters}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the United Kingdom (UK) there are two varieties of registered healthcare scientist in hospitals - Clinical Scientists and Biomedical Scientists (BMS). There is a strict and formal post graduate training programme for both careers followed by statutory registration for each with the Health & Care Professions Council UK (HCPC):[1], for the safety and assurance of the customers - the patients. They are two similar but distinct careers with parallel but different training paths and different entry requirements.\n\nThe role of Clinical Scientists is to improve the health and well-being of patients and the public by practising alongside doctors, nurses, and other health and social care professionals in the delivery of healthcare. Their aim is to provide expert scientific and clinical advice to clinician colleagues, to aid in the diagnosis, treatment and management of patient care.\n\n'''Examples of the type of work they undertake include:'''\n\n* Advising, diagnosing, interpreting, and treating patients.\n* Advising health and social care professionals in the diagnosis and treatment of patients.\n* Researching the science, technology, and practise used in healthcare to innovate and improve services.\n* Designing, building, and operating technology for diagnosing and treating patients.\n* Ensuring the safety and reliability of tests and equipment used in healthcare.\n\nTrainee Clinical Scientist posts are advertised nationally, usually between November and February on the Clinical Scientists Recruitment webpages where application forms may be obtained and electronic submission of applications can be made. These posts are for the approved Pre-registration Training Programme, designed to prepare entrants for higher professional qualifications, further clinical training and eventual Consultant responsibility.\n\nClinical Scientist training involves enrolment of graduates (1st or 2nd class honours degree or better is essential due to the high competition for limited training places) into an intensive 3-year training scheme leading to certification and eventual registration before starting the higher career structure. The basic qualification for becoming a Clinical Biochemist, Clinical Immunologist or Clinical Microbiologist is a good Honours degree in an appropriate subject: for Clinical Biochemistry, that subject might be Biochemistry or Chemistry (or another life science subject which contains a substantial Biochemistry component); for Clinical Immunology, that subject might be any life science degree with an immunology component; for Clinical Microbiology that subject might be any life science degree with a microbiology component.\n\nAlthough not essential, some candidates will apply with higher degrees in an attempt to improve their chances of selection for training and several universities currently offer MSc courses in Clinical Biochemistry, Immunology and Microbiology which have been approved by the ACB or the AHCS. Full-time and 'sandwich' courses are available, and further information may be obtained from individual programmes, although the level of financial support provided varies, and should be clarified at interview. Some entrants to the profession will already have obtained a PhD, and the training and research experience that this provides is invaluable to the work of the Clinical Scientist. In larger Departments, there may be opportunities to study for a research degree after entering the profession and acquiring registration, but since this has to be fitted in with other responsibilities, it may take some years to complete. It should be clearly understood that the major role of the profession is patient care and that research, management and all the other aspects will come as side issues and not be the predominating factor in the career path. The work of Biomedical Scientists and Clinical Scientists have impact on the diagnosis and treatment of almost every patient admitted to hospitals in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe United Kingdom is facing a shortage of qualified Clinical and Biomedical Scientists.  The Royal College of Pathologists and the Royal College of Physicians have pointed out the need for increased government funding for medical training programs to prevent diagnostic facilities and medical infrastructure from being overwhelmed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.darkdaily.com/pathologists-and-physicians-in-united-kingdom-comment-on-how-shortage-of-medical-laboratory-professionals-could-soon-delay-essential-diagnostic-therapeutic-testing-206/|title=UK's Pathology Laboratories Face Staffing Shortage &#124; Dark Daily}}</ref>\n\n===Nigeria===\nIn Nigeria, Medical Laboratory Science is a high skilled profession charged by Act. 2004 Cap 114 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria. The initial qualification awarded graduates of the programme, like some other medical programmes, was Associate of the Institute of Medical Laboratory Technology/Science (AIMLT/AIMLS)\nThe Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria, which was established by Act. 2004 Cap 114 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, regulates the practice of Medical Laboratory Science in Nigeria. In Nigeria, the Medical Laboratory Science programme is Bachelor of Medical Laboratory Science (BMLS), regulated by National Universities Commission (NUC) and by the Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria (MLSCN). Students at their first year (100 level) are trained under the Faculty of Science in Basic Sciences and Faculty of Arts, Management and Social science in General studies and Entrepreneurship. At the 200 level, students are taught basic medical sciences and are introduced to Medical Laboratory Science. The third year of the programme marks the beginning of the professional training as students are engaged in the classroom for lectures as well as in the Hospital laboratory for the professional or practical training. At the fourth year students are taught the basics in all the special areas of Medical Laboratory Science. At the end of 400 level programme, successful students are presented for the First professional examination, to be moderated by  the Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria  At the fifth year, students break into 4 core or specialized areas of Medical Laboratory Science, namely: medical microbiology/parasitology, chemical pathology/immunology, haematology/blood transfusion science and histopathology/cytopathology. At the end of the fifth year, suitable students are presented for final professional examination by the Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria|url=http://web.mlscn.gov.ng/|access-date=18 Dec 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190110174802/http://web.mlscn.gov.ng/|archive-date=10 Jan 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Certification and licensing==\n[[File:Lab tech at microscope 2.jpg|thumb|225px|A Lab tech uses a microscope for a [[Cell counting|cell count]].]]\n\n===United States===\n\nThere are currently three major certification agencies in the United States of America for clinical laboratory scientists. They are the American Association of Bioanalysts (AAB), the American Medical Technologists (AMT), and the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP). All three national accrediting agencies will certify scientists in the clinical laboratory as generalist (chemistry, hematology, immunology, immunohematology/blood bank, and microbiology).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aab.org/aab/MT.asp|title=MT(AAB)|website=ABOR}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.americanmedtech.org/Get-Certified/MT-Eligibility|website = American Medical Technologists (AMT)|title = Get Certified: MT Eligibility}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.ascp.org/BOCRouteFinder/BOCCertificationEligibility/Index|title = Examination Eligibility Assistant|website = ASCP Board of Certification}}</ref> The American Association of Bioanalysts and the American Medical Technologists certifications continue to use the traditional designation Medical Technologist (MT), while the American Society for Clinical Pathology has adopted the designation of Medical Laboratory Scientist (MLS). Regardless of terminology, these highly qualified individuals serve as scientists in the clinical laboratory.\n\nThere are two other organizations that have previously provided proficiency examinations to clinical laboratory scientist. The first, is the US Department of Health and Human Services.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/HHS+sets+August+date+for+proficiency+exam.-a04788724|title=HHS sets August date for proficiency exam. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com}}</ref> The second, is the National Credentialing Agency for Laboratory Personnel (NCA).

Puerto Rico, in order to provide the state license, requires either a local board certification with a state examination, or any of both the ASCP and the NCA.<ref>{{cite web |title= AN ACT TO REGULATE THE PROFESSION OF MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY, Act No. 167 of August 11, 1988 |publisher= LexJuris |date= 1997 |url=http://www.lexjuris.com/lexmate/profesiones/lex013.htm }}</ref> Minnesota, Texas, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Vermont, Washington, New Jersey, Iowa, Utah, Ohio, South Carolina, Wyoming, Pennsylvania, Virginia, South Dakota, Delaware, Missouri, and Alaska are currently attempting to obtain licensure. All states require documentation from a professional certification agency before issuing a state certification. A person applying for state certification may also be expected to submit fingerprints, education and training records, and competency certification. Some states also require completion of a specified number of continuing education contact hours prior to issuing or renewing a license. Licensing is somewhat controversial as it adds a bureaucratic layer in a field that is severely understaffed. Simply requiring testing personnel to obtain and maintain their national certification would help ensure competent testing personnel without increasing costs to testing personnel.\n\nSome states recognize another state's license if it is equal or more stringent, but currently California does not recognize any other state license.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ascls.org/jobs/grads/personnel_licensure.asp |title=ASCLS licensing information |access-date=2008-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907230404/http://www.ascls.org/jobs/grads/personnel_licensure.asp |archive-date=2008-09-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n\nIn the United Kingdom all clinical scientists and biomedical scientists have had to be registered with the Health & Care Professions Council (HCPC) in order to work unsupervised, to develop through the careers grades of their profession and to use the protected titles of \"Clinical Scientist\" or \"Biomedical Scientist\". The HCPC registers nearly 200,000 healthcare professionals[3] and while success in an approved degree course from an accredited University is sufficient for all other professions, both clinical scientists and biomedical scientists have post graduate training and no approved degree courses. Autonomous assessment of applicants in these two professions with subsequent certification for successful ones, is the only approved UK route to registration for them.\n\n\"Clinical Scientist\", just as \"Biomedical Scientist\", is a protected title under the law (there is a \u00a35000 fine for transgressors who fraudulently use the title without being registered by the state). The HCPC can strike people off the register for malpractice in just the same way as for doctors with the General Medical Council (GMC).\n\nThose who are working in \"Trainee\" positions in the profession are permitted to use the title with an appropriate caveat, for example \u2013 \"Pre-registration Clinical Scientist\", Trainee Clinical Scientist, etc. Alternatively some may use titles specific to the discipline they train in, such as Trainee Clinical Biochemist\", \"Clinical Immunologist in Training\" or \u201c Pre-Registrant Clinical Microbiologist\u201d which is also perfectly acceptable since it is not implying the protected \"Clinical Scientist\" title of fully qualified and registered practitioners. It is against the law to formally work with the title of \u201cClinical Scientist\u201d without professional registration[4].\n\n'''Nigeria'''\n\nIn Nigeria successful student at the end of the training in both academic and professional assessments with respect to  the  graduation requirements is certified by the respective University, inducted and licensed by the Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria  after a successful internship training. <nowiki>http://mlscn.gov.ng</nowiki>\n\n== Further education ==\nAs in many healthcare professions, a Medical Laboratory Scientist may pursue higher education to advance or further specialize in their career.\n*[[Master of Science]], [[Master of Business Administration]], [[Master of Health Administration]], [[Doctor of medical laboratory science]] for specialization, education and management roles.\n*[[Doctor of Philosophy]] for management and directorship roles in the clinical laboratory as well as for academic research and professorship.  Doctors of Philosophy holding a degree in a biological science, and who are board certified by a CLIA-approved entity, are qualified as a medical laboratory director.<ref>{{cite web|title=Certification Boards for Laboratory Directors of High Complexity Testing|url=https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/CLIA/Certification_Boards_Laboratory_Directors.html|website=cms.gov}}</ref>\n*Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of clinical laboratory Science - this is the position that qualifies an individual to oversee or direct almost all types of clinical laboratories.

In its conception it aimed to provide a coherent framework that was accessible, affordable and designed specifically to both capture scientific and technological advances and to provide improved outcomes for patients, the service and professionals. A key aspect of the framework from the start was the formalisation of training to develop talented clinical scientists to undertake quality assured Higher Specialist Scientist Training (HSST) programmes to prepare them for roles as Consultant Clinical Scientists. It is envisaged that Consultant Clinical Scientists will work synergistically and in partnership with their medical colleagues and within multiprofessional clinical teams to support clinical scientific practice aimed at quality improvement, innovation and world-class outcomes for patients. This scientific expertise and leadership will provide important benefits and added value to patients and to the service as it moves forward through the 21st century. This will bring to fruition the vision of science and realise the potential of scientific and technological advances for both translational and personalised medicine.\n\nTraining through the Higher Specialist Scientist Training pathway is discipline specific. For life science disciplines (Immunology, Microbiology, Virology, Haematology, Biochemistry) the training curriculum and formal examinations are administered by the Royal College of Pathologists. The life science training pathway for Clinical Scientists follows a similar pathway to that undertaken by medically qualified specialist registrars in pathology. Clinical Scientists are therefore the only discipline of non-medical healthcare professionals examined by a Medical Royal College. Clinical Scientists who attain both part 1 examination certification and part 2 certification are awarded Fellowship of the Royal College of Pathologists (FRCPath) and are deemed to have the knowledge and expertise expected of a consultant level scientist. Consultant Clinical Scientist posts generally require candidates to have completed FRCPath qualification to be eligible.\n\nAll Clinical Scientists regardless of seniority or specialisation may have other responsibilities including academic appointments, responsibilities as clinical lead for a pathology service, or may have wider hospital responsibilities such as Directorship of Infection Prevention and Control, or responsibility for the hospital's Research and Development strategy. Junior clinical scientists may become involved in academic research, working towards award of a Ph.D. or DClinSci\n\n==Job title==\n[[File:Pn-lab-2001nov.jpg|thumb|right|Russian MLS prepares the analyses in ELISA laboratory]]\nThe informal abbreviations of job titles may be a source of confusion. In the United States Medical Laboratory Scientist (ASCP) and Medical Technologists (AMT) or (AAB) are often called \"med techs\" (based on the era in which they were known as \"medical technologists\"), but this shorthand term is shared by other healthcare employees, including [[pharmacy technician|pharmacy techs]], [[radiographers]] (also known as radiologic technologists), and [[respiratory therapists]].\n\nIn the United States there is a formal distinction between an MLT and a MT/MLS. Often, MT/MLS have at least a bachelor's degree, while MLT have an associate degree. However, due to grandfathering rules and certification requirements between the boards of registry, some MT/MLS may only have an associate degree.<ref>https://www.aab.org/aab/MT.asp ABOR Certification</ref>  Scientists and technologists generally earn a higher income than technicians, have more responsibilities, and have more opportunities for advancement.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, there are defined training pathways leading to professional registration as either a Clinical Scientist, or as a Biomedical Scientist. The role descriptions for these healthcare scientists are very different, where clinical scientists generally undertake non-routine research and development, as well as improving and providing clinical service using scientific expertise. Biomedical Scientists in the United Kingdom are similar to the role of MLT and MT/CLS described above, and have similar regulatory requirements for professional regulation. Clinical Scientists in the United Kingdom may struggle with a lack of professional recognition. This is in part due to the myriad job titles used to describe them including Clinical Physiologists, Medical Physicists, and Clinical Biochemists, which generally mean the public and other healthcare workers assume Clinical Scientists to be medically qualified doctors, due to the sometimes complex nature of the role.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Laboratory centrifuge]]\n*[[Laboratory information system]]\n*[[Medical technology]]\n*[[Medical laboratory]]\n*[[Phlebotomist]]\n*[[Reference ranges for common blood tests]]\n*[[Urine test]]\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Allied health professions]]\n*[[Automated analyser]]\n*[[Blood bank]]\n*[[Blood test]]\n*[[Biomedical Scientist]] similar career outside of the US\n*[[Body fluids]]\n*[[Clinical pathology]]\n*[[ISO 15189]]\n{{col-break}}{{col-end}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.csmls.org Canadian Society for medical Laboratory Science]\n*[http://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/medical-and-clinical-laboratory-technologists-and-technicians.htm U.S. Department of Labor information on Clinical Laboratory Technologists and Technicians]\n*[http://www.aacc.org/ American Association for Clinical Chemistry]\n*[http://www.ascp.org/ American Society of Clinical Pathology]\n*[http://www.ascls.org/ American Society of Clinical Laboratory Science]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20120624052406/http://www.nca-info.org/ National Credentialing Agency for Laboratory Personnel]\n*[http://www.naacls.org/ National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Science]\n*[http://www.labce.com/medical_technologist.aspx Medical Technologist Continuing Education]\n*[http://www.aims.org.au/c/ AIMS: Australian Institute of Medical Scientists]\n*[http://www.nzimls.org.nz/ New Zealand Institute of Medical Laboratory Science]\n*[http://www.petie.gr/ Greek Association of Medical Laboratory Technologists]\n*[https://www.med.unc.edu/ahs/clinical/files/clsatwork2001.pdf Clinical Laboratory Scientists at Work]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Allied health professions}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Health care occupations]]\n[[Category:Science occupations]]\n", "name_user": "Danhash", "label": "safe", "comment": "removed spaces inside of parentheses", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_laboratory_scientist"}

Under such circumstances, patients may describe shortness of breath when they bend over (e.g. when tying shoelaces)..\n\n==Mechanism==\nOrthopnea is due to increased distribution of blood to the [[pulmonary circulation]] when a person lies flat or closer to a horizontal position. Lying flat decreases the inhibitory effect that the gravity usually has on the blood that is coming back to the heart from the lower extremities of the body. This increases the right sided venous return. In a normal person, this redistribution of blood has little effect on respiratory function as the left ventricle has the adequate capacity to suddenly increase its stroke volume (as a result of Frank-Starling mechanism). In a person with [[heart failure]], the left ventricle has an inadequate capacity to respond to increased arrival of blood from the pulmonary circulation. This leads to the pooling up of blood in the pulmonary circulation.

Under such circumstances, patients may describe shortness of breath when they bend over (e.g. when tying shoelaces)..\n\n==Mechanism==\nOrthopnea is due to increased distribution of blood to the [[pulmonary circulation]] when a person lies flat or closer to a horizontal position. Lying flat decreases the inhibitory effect that the gravity usually has on the blood that is coming back to the heart from the lower extremities of the body. This increases the right sided venous return. In a normal person, this redistribution of blood has little effect on respiratory function as the left ventricle has the adequate capacity to suddenly increase its stroke volume (as a result of Frank-Starling mechanism). In a person with [[heart failure]], the left ventricle has an inadequate capacity to respond to increased arrival of blood from the pulmonary circulation. This leads to the pooling up of blood in the pulmonary circulation. The increased intra-parenchymal pulmonary intravascular pressure can also result in hydrostatic pressure related fluid exudation into the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], thus causing [[pulmonary edema]] and further worsening shortness of breath. Thus, shortness of breath is commonly experienced after a reasonably short time lying near to flat for a person with left ventricular failure.<ref name=Mukerji/> This is different from the dyspnea experienced by someone with lung parenchymal pathology (both restrictive and obstructive) when lying down, which is sudden and instead related to an acute change in diaphragmatic/accessory respiratory muscle mechanical advantage lost when moving the body into a more horizontal position.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nDiagnosis is based mostly on the clinical features.\n\n==Treatment==\n\nTreating the underlying cause will serve the purpose.\n\n==Etymology ==\nThe word ''orthopnea'' uses [[classical compound|combining forms]] of ''[[wikt:ortho-#Prefix|ortho-]]'' + ''[[wikt:-pnea#Suffix|-pnea]]'', from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ortho'', straight, regular, + ''pnoia'', breath.

There is often a history of a blow or other trauma to the area a few weeks to a few months earlier.  Patients with traumatic neurological injuries, severe neurologic disorders or severe burns who develop heterotopic ossification experience limitation of motion in the areas affected.\n\n== Causes ==\nHeterotopic ossification of varying severity can be caused by surgery or trauma to the hips and legs. About every third patient who has total hip arthroplasty (joint replacement) or a severe fracture of the long bones of the lower leg will develop heterotopic ossification, but is uncommonly symptomatic.  Between 50% and 90% of patients who developed heterotopic ossification following a previous hip arthroplasty will develop additional heterotopic ossification.\n\nHeterotopic ossification often develops in patients with traumatic brain or spinal cord injuries, other severe neurologic disorders or severe burns, most commonly around the hips.  The mechanism is unknown.  This may account for the clinical impression that traumatic brain injuries cause accelerated fracture healing.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.injury.2004.08.028|pmid=15710151|title=Does traumatic brain injury result in accelerated fracture healing?|journal=Injury|volume=36|issue=3|pages=363|year=2005|last1=Morley|first1=John|last2=Marsh|first2=Sarah|last3=Drakoulakis|first3=Emmanuil|last4=Pape|first4=Hans-Christoph|last5=Giannoudis|first5=Peter V.}}</ref>\n\nThere are also rare genetic disorders causing heterotopic ossification such as [[fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva]] (FOP), a condition that causes injured bodily tissues to be replaced by heterotopic bone. Characteristically exhibiting in the [[hallux|big toe]] at birth, it causes the formation of heterotopic bone throughout the body over the course of the sufferer's life, causing chronic pain and eventually leading to the immobilisation and fusion of most of the skeleton by abnormal growths of bone.\n\nAnother rare genetic disorder causing heterotopic ossification is [[progressive osseous heteroplasia]] (POH), is a condition characterized by cutaneous or subcutaneous ossification.\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n[[File:Heterotopic Ossification Elbow1.JPG|thumb|Heterotopic ossification of the elbow, after comminuted fracture and arthroplasty.]]\n[[File:Heterotopic Ossification Elbow2.JPG|thumb|left|Heteropic ossification of the elbow, after comminuted fracture and arthroplasty.]]\nDuring the early stage, an x-ray will not be helpful because there is no calcium in the matrix. (In an acute episode which is not treated, it will be 3\u2013 4 weeks after onset before the x-ray is positive.) Early laboratory tests are not very helpful.  Alkaline phosphatase will be elevated at some point, but initially may be only slightly elevated, rising later to a high value for a short time.  Unless weekly tests are done, this peak value may not be detected. It is not useful in patients who have had fractures or spine fusion recently, as they will cause elevations.\n\nThe only definitive diagnostic test in the early acute stage is a [[bone scan]], which will show hetertopic ossification 7 \u2013 10 days earlier than an x-ray.  The three-phase bone scan may be the most sensitive method of detecting early heterotopic bone formation.  However, an abnormality detected in the early phase may not progress to the formation of heterotopic bone.  Another finding, often misinterpreted as early heterotopic bone formation, is an increased (early) uptake around the knees or the ankles in a patient with a very recent spinal cord injury.  It is not clear exactly what this means, because these patients do not develop heterotopic bone formation.  It has been hypothesized that this may be related to the autonomic nervous system and its control over circulation.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.spinalcord.uab.edu/show.asp?durki=21485 | title=Heterotopic Ossification \u2013 SCI InfoSheet #12 | accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>\n\nWhen the initial presentation is swelling and increased temperature in a leg, the differential diagnosis includes thrombophlebitis.  It may be necessary to do both a bone scan and a venogram to differentiate between heterotopic ossification and thrombophlebitis, and it is even possible that both could be present simultaneously. In heterotopic ossification, the swelling tends to be more proximal and localized, with little or no foot/ankle edema, whereas in thrombophlebitis the swelling is usually more uniform throughout the leg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinalcord.ar.gov/Publications/FactSheets/sheets1-5/fact1.html |title=Heterotopic Ossification |accessdate=2008-06-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505034718/http://www.spinalcord.ar.gov/Publications/FactSheets/sheets1-5/fact1.html |archivedate=2008-05-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Treatment ==\nThere is no clear form of treatment.

A variety of doses and techniques have been used.  Generally, radiation therapy should be delivered as close as practical to the time of surgery.  A dose of 7-8 Gray in a single fraction within 24\u201348 hours of surgery has been used successfully.  Treatment volumes include the peri-articular region, and can be used for hip, knee, elbow, shoulder, jaw or in patients after spinal cord trauma.\n\nSingle dose radiation therapy is well tolerated and is cost effective, without an increase in bleeding, infection or wound healing disturbances.<ref>Principles and Practice of Radiation Oncology Fifth Edition, Perez and Brady, Lippincott pp. 1955\u201356</ref>\n\n'''Other possible treatments.'''\n\nCertain antiinflammatory agents, such as indomethacin, ibuprofen and aspirin, have shown some effect in preventing recurrence of heterotopic ossification after total hip replacement.\n<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">spinal cord injury information network \u2013 info sheet 12</ref>\n\nConservative treatments such as passive [[range of motion]] exercises or other [[joint mobilization|mobilization]] techniques provided by [[physical therapists or occupational therapists]] may also assist in preventing HO.

Between 50% and 90% of patients who developed heterotopic ossification following a previous hip arthroplasty will develop additional heterotopic ossification.\n\nHeterotopic ossification often develops in patients with traumatic brain or spinal cord injuries, other severe neurologic disorders or severe burns, most commonly around the hips.  The mechanism is unknown.  This may account for the clinical impression that traumatic brain injuries cause accelerated fracture healing.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.injury.2004.08.028|pmid=15710151|title=Does traumatic brain injury result in accelerated fracture healing?|journal=Injury|volume=36|issue=3|pages=363|year=2005|last1=Morley|first1=John|last2=Marsh|first2=Sarah|last3=Drakoulakis|first3=Emmanuil|last4=Pape|first4=Hans-Christoph|last5=Giannoudis|first5=Peter V.}}</ref>\n\nThere are also rare genetic disorders causing heterotopic ossification such as [[fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva]] (FOP), a condition that causes injured bodily tissues to be replaced by heterotopic bone. Characteristically exhibiting in the [[hallux|big toe]] at birth, it causes the formation of heterotopic bone throughout the body over the course of the sufferer's life, causing chronic pain and eventually leading to the immobilisation and fusion of most of the skeleton by abnormal growths of bone.\n\nAnother rare genetic disorder causing heterotopic ossification is [[progressive osseous heteroplasia]] (POH), is a condition characterized by cutaneous or subcutaneous ossification.\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n[[File:Heterotopic Ossification Elbow1.JPG|thumb|Heterotopic ossification of the elbow, after comminuted fracture and arthroplasty.]]\n[[File:Heterotopic Ossification Elbow2.JPG|thumb|left|Heteropic ossification of the elbow, after comminuted fracture and arthroplasty.]]\nDuring the early stage, an x-ray will not be helpful because there is no calcium in the matrix. (In an acute episode which is not treated, it will be 3\u2013 4 weeks after onset before the x-ray is positive.) Early laboratory tests are not very helpful.  Alkaline phosphatase will be elevated at some point, but initially may be only slightly elevated, rising later to a high value for a short time.  Unless weekly tests are done, this peak value may not be detected. It is not useful in patients who have had fractures or spine fusion recently, as they will cause elevations.\n\nThe only definitive diagnostic test in the early acute stage is a [[bone scan]], which will show hetertopic ossification 7 \u2013 10 days earlier than an x-ray.  The three-phase bone scan may be the most sensitive method of detecting early heterotopic bone formation.  However, an abnormality detected in the early phase may not progress to the formation of heterotopic bone.  Another finding, often misinterpreted as early heterotopic bone formation, is an increased (early) uptake around the knees or the ankles in a patient with a very recent spinal cord injury.  It is not clear exactly what this means, because these patients do not develop heterotopic bone formation.  It has been hypothesized that this may be related to the autonomic nervous system and its control over circulation.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.spinalcord.uab.edu/show.asp?durki=21485 | title=Heterotopic Ossification \u2013 SCI InfoSheet #12 | accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>\n\nWhen the initial presentation is swelling and increased temperature in a leg, the differential diagnosis includes thrombophlebitis.  It may be necessary to do both a bone scan and a venogram to differentiate between heterotopic ossification and thrombophlebitis, and it is even possible that both could be present simultaneously. In heterotopic ossification, the swelling tends to be more proximal and localized, with little or no foot/ankle edema, whereas in thrombophlebitis the swelling is usually more uniform throughout the leg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinalcord.ar.gov/Publications/FactSheets/sheets1-5/fact1.html |title=Heterotopic Ossification |accessdate=2008-06-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505034718/http://www.spinalcord.ar.gov/Publications/FactSheets/sheets1-5/fact1.html |archivedate=2008-05-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Treatment ==\nThere is no clear form of treatment. Originally, bisphosphonates were expected to be of value after hip surgery but there has been no convincing evidence of benefit, despite having been used prophylactically.<ref>Metabolic Bone and Stone Disease. BEC Nordin, AG NEED, HA Morris: Churchill Livingstone, 1993. p 328-9</ref>\n\nDepending on the growth's location, orientation and severity, surgical removal may be possible.\n[[File:Heterotopic Ossification removal 2011.jpg|thumb|Surgical removal of a Heterotopic Ossification fusing the right Humerus and Radius following a severe TBI and complete fracture of the Ulna.]]\n\n'''Radiation Therapy.'''\n[[File:Heterotopic Ossification Elbow RT.JPG|thumb|Elbow heterotopic ossification radiation therapy field, status post surgery.]]\nProphylactic radiation therapy for the prevention of heterotopic ossification has been employed since the 1970s.  A variety of doses and techniques have been used.  Generally, radiation therapy should be delivered as close as practical to the time of surgery.  A dose of 7-8 Gray in a single fraction within 24\u201348 hours of surgery has been used successfully.  Treatment volumes include the peri-articular region, and can be used for hip, knee, elbow, shoulder, jaw or in patients after spinal cord trauma.\n\nSingle dose radiation therapy is well tolerated and is cost effective, without an increase in bleeding, infection or wound healing disturbances.<ref>Principles and Practice of Radiation Oncology Fifth Edition, Perez and Brady, Lippincott pp. 1955\u201356</ref>\n\n'''Other possible treatments.'''\n\nCertain antiinflammatory agents, such as indomethacin, ibuprofen and aspirin, have shown some effect in preventing recurrence of heterotopic ossification after total hip replacement.\n<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">spinal cord injury information network \u2013 info sheet 12</ref>\n\nConservative treatments such as passive [[range of motion]] exercises or other [[joint mobilization|mobilization]] techniques provided by [[physical therapists or occupational therapists]] may also assist in preventing HO.  A review article looked at 114 adult patients retrospectively and suggested that the lower incidence of HO in patients with a very severe [[Traumatic brain injury|TBI]] may have been due to early intensive physical and occupational therapy in conjunction with [[pharmacotherapy|pharmacological treatment]].<ref>Simonsen, L.L., Sonne-Holm, S., Krasheninnikoff, M., Engberg, A.W.

Care Injured'' '''38''': 1146\u20131150.</ref>  Another review article also recommended physiotherapy as an adjunct to pharmacological and medical treatments because passive range of motion exercises may maintain range at the joint and prevent secondary soft tissue [[contractures]], which are often associated with joint immobility.<ref>Cipriano, C.A., Pill, S.G., Keenan, M.A. (2009). \"Heterotopic ossification following traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury\".

It occurs in [[neuromuscular junction]] disorders, such as [[myasthenia gravis]].\n\n==Pathophysiology==\n{{See also|Muscle contraction}}\nMuscle cells work by detecting a [[Action potential|flow]] of electrical impulses from the [[brain]], which signals them to [[Muscle contraction|contract]] through the release of [[calcium]] by the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]]. Fatigue (reduced ability to generate force) may occur due to the nerve, or within the muscle cells themselves. New research from scientists at Columbia University suggests that muscle fatigue is caused by calcium leaking out of the muscle cell. This makes less calcium available for the muscle cell. In addition, the Columbia researchers propose that an enzyme activated by this released calcium eats away at muscle fibers.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/12/health/research/12musc.html?_r=2&ref=science&oref=slogin&oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=Finding May Solve Riddle of Fatigue in Muscles | first=Gina | last=Kolata | date=February 12, 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[Substrate (biochemistry)|Substrates]] within the muscle generally serve to power muscular contractions. They include molecules such as [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), [[glycogen]] and [[Phosphocreatine|creatine phosphate]]. ATP binds to the [[myosin]] head and causes the \u2018ratchetting\u2019 that results in contraction according to the [[Sliding filament mechanism|sliding filament model]]. Creatine phosphate stores energy so ATP can be rapidly regenerated within the muscle cells from [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ions, allowing for sustained powerful contractions that last between 5\u20137 seconds. Glycogen is the intramuscular storage form of [[glucose]], used to generate energy quickly once intramuscular creatine stores are exhausted, producing [[lactic acid]] as a metabolic byproduct. Contrary to common belief, lactic acid accumulation doesn't actually cause the burning sensation felt when people exhaust their oxygen and oxidative metabolism, but in actuality, lactic acid in presence of oxygen recycles to produce [[pyruvate]] in the liver, which is known as the [[Cori cycle]].\n\nSubstrates produce metabolic fatigue by being depleted during exercise, resulting in a lack of intracellular energy sources to fuel contractions. In essence, the muscle stops contracting because it lacks the energy to do so.\n\n==Differential diagnosis==\n\n===True vs. perceived weakness===\n\n* True weakness (or neuromuscular) describes a condition where the force exerted by the muscles is less than would be expected, for example [[muscular dystrophy]]. \n* Perceived weakness (or non-neuromuscular) describes a condition where a person feels more effort than normal is required to exert a given amount of force but actual muscle strength is normal, for example [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Adams and Victor's Principles of Neurology, Ninth Edition | publisher=McGraw-Hill |author1=Ropper, Allan H. |author2=Samuels, Martin A. | authorlink=Chapter 24.

When a nerve experiences [[synaptic fatigue]] it becomes unable to stimulate the muscle that it innervates. Most movements require a force far below what a muscle could potentially generate, and barring [[pathology]], neuromuscular fatigue is seldom an issue.\n\nFor extremely powerful contractions that are close to the upper limit of a muscle's ability to generate force, neuromuscular fatigue can become a limiting factor in untrained individuals. In novice [[strength training|strength trainers]], the muscle's ability to generate force is most strongly limited by nerve's ability to sustain a [[rate coding|high-frequency signal]]. After an extended period of maximum contraction, the nerve's signal reduces in frequency and the force generated by the contraction diminishes. There is no sensation of pain or discomfort, the muscle appears to simply \u2018stop listening\u2019 and gradually cease to move, often [[Muscle contraction#Eccentric contraction|lengthening]]. As there is insufficient stress on the muscles and tendons, there will often be no [[delayed onset muscle soreness]] following the workout.  Part of the process of strength training is increasing the nerve's ability to generate sustained, high frequency signals which allow a muscle to contract with their greatest force.  It is this \"neural training\" that causes several weeks worth of rapid gains in strength, which level off once the nerve is generating maximum contractions and the muscle reaches its physiological limit. Past this point, training effects increase muscular strength through myofibrillar or sarcoplasmic [[Muscle hypertrophy#Strength training|hypertrophy]] and metabolic fatigue becomes the factor limiting contractile force.\n\n====Peripheral muscle fatigue====\nPeripheral muscle fatigue during physical work is considered{{By whom|date=April 2012}} an inability for the body to supply sufficient energy or other metabolites to the contracting muscles to meet the increased energy demand. This is the most common case of physical fatigue\u2014affecting a national{{Where|date=April 2012}} average of 72% of adults in the work force in 2002. This causes contractile dysfunction that manifests in the eventual reduction or lack of ability of a single muscle or local group of muscles to do work. The insufficiency of energy, i.e. sub-optimal [[cellular respiration|aerobic metabolism]], generally results in the accumulation of [[lactic acid]] and other [[acid]]ic anaerobic metabolic by-products in the muscle, causing the stereotypical burning sensation of local muscle fatigue, though recent studies have indicated otherwise, actually finding that lactic acid is a source of energy.<ref name=robergs>{{cite journal |author1=R.

Peripheral regulation  therefore depends on the localized metabolic chemical conditions of the local muscle affected, whereas the central model of muscle fatigue is an integrated mechanism that works to preserve the integrity of the system by initiating muscle fatigue through muscle derecruitment, based on collective feedback from the periphery, before cellular or organ failure occurs. Therefore, the feedback that is read by this central regulator could include chemical and mechanical as well as cognitive cues. The significance of each of these factors will depend on the nature of the fatigue-inducing work that is being performed.\n\nThough not universally used, \"metabolic fatigue\" is a common alternative term for peripheral muscle weakness, because of the reduction in contractile force due to the direct or indirect effects of the reduction of substrates or accumulation of metabolites within the [[muscle fiber|myocytes]].

Fatigue (reduced ability to generate force) may occur due to the nerve, or within the muscle cells themselves. New research from scientists at Columbia University suggests that muscle fatigue is caused by calcium leaking out of the muscle cell. This makes less calcium available for the muscle cell. In addition, the Columbia researchers propose that an enzyme activated by this released calcium eats away at muscle fibers.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/12/health/research/12musc.html?_r=2&ref=science&oref=slogin&oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=Finding May Solve Riddle of Fatigue in Muscles | first=Gina | last=Kolata | date=February 12, 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[Substrate (biochemistry)|Substrates]] within the muscle generally serve to power muscular contractions. They include molecules such as [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), [[glycogen]] and [[Phosphocreatine|creatine phosphate]]. ATP binds to the [[myosin]] head and causes the \u2018ratchetting\u2019 that results in contraction according to the [[Sliding filament mechanism|sliding filament model]]. Creatine phosphate stores energy so ATP can be rapidly regenerated within the muscle cells from [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) and inorganic phosphate ions, allowing for sustained powerful contractions that last between 5\u20137 seconds. Glycogen is the intramuscular storage form of [[glucose]], used to generate energy quickly once intramuscular creatine stores are exhausted, producing [[lactic acid]] as a metabolic byproduct. Contrary to common belief, lactic acid accumulation doesn't actually cause the burning sensation felt when people exhaust their oxygen and oxidative metabolism, but in actuality, lactic acid in presence of oxygen recycles to produce [[pyruvate]] in the liver, which is known as the [[Cori cycle]].\n\nSubstrates produce metabolic fatigue by being depleted during exercise, resulting in a lack of intracellular energy sources to fuel contractions. In essence, the muscle stops contracting because it lacks the energy to do so.\n\n==Differential diagnosis==\n\n===True vs. perceived weakness===\n\n* True weakness (or neuromuscular) describes a condition where the force exerted by the muscles is less than would be expected, for example [[muscular dystrophy]]. \n* Perceived weakness (or non-neuromuscular) describes a condition where a person feels more effort than normal is required to exert a given amount of force but actual muscle strength is normal, for example [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Adams and Victor's Principles of Neurology, Ninth Edition | publisher=McGraw-Hill |author1=Ropper, Allan H. |author2=Samuels, Martin A. | authorlink=Chapter 24.

When a nerve experiences [[synaptic fatigue]] it becomes unable to stimulate the muscle that it innervates. Most movements require a force far below what a muscle could potentially generate, and barring [[pathology]], neuromuscular fatigue is seldom an issue.\n\nFor extremely powerful contractions that are close to the upper limit of a muscle's ability to generate force, neuromuscular fatigue can become a limiting factor in untrained individuals. In novice [[strength training|strength trainers]], the muscle's ability to generate force is most strongly limited by nerve's ability to sustain a [[rate coding|high-frequency signal]]. After an extended period of maximum contraction, the nerve's signal reduces in frequency and the force generated by the contraction diminishes. There is no sensation of pain or discomfort, the muscle appears to simply \u2018stop listening\u2019 and gradually cease to move, often [[Muscle contraction#Eccentric contraction|lengthening]]. As there is insufficient stress on the muscles and tendons, there will often be no [[delayed onset muscle soreness]] following the workout.  Part of the process of strength training is increasing the nerve's ability to generate sustained, high frequency signals which allow a muscle to contract with their greatest force.  It is this \"neural training\" that causes several weeks worth of rapid gains in strength, which level off once the nerve is generating maximum contractions and the muscle reaches its physiological limit. Past this point, training effects increase muscular strength through myofibrillar or sarcoplasmic [[Muscle hypertrophy#Strength training|hypertrophy]] and metabolic fatigue becomes the factor limiting contractile force.\n\n====Peripheral muscle fatigue====\nPeripheral muscle fatigue during physical work is considered{{By whom|date=April 2012}} an inability for the body to supply sufficient energy or other metabolites to the contracting muscles to meet the increased energy demand. This is the most common case of physical fatigue\u2014affecting a national{{Where|date=April 2012}} average of 72% of adults in the work force in 2002. This causes contractile dysfunction that manifests in the eventual reduction or lack of ability of a single muscle or local group of muscles to do work. The insufficiency of energy, i.e. sub-optimal [[cellular respiration|aerobic metabolism]], generally results in the accumulation of [[lactic acid]] and other [[acid]]ic anaerobic metabolic by-products in the muscle, causing the stereotypical burning sensation of local muscle fatigue, though recent studies have indicated otherwise, actually finding that lactic acid is a source of energy.<ref name=robergs>{{cite journal |author1=R.

Peripheral regulation  therefore depends on the localized metabolic chemical conditions of the local muscle affected, whereas the central model of muscle fatigue is an integrated mechanism that works to preserve the integrity of the system by initiating muscle fatigue through muscle derecruitment, based on collective feedback from the periphery, before cellular or organ failure occurs. Therefore, the feedback that is read by this central regulator could include chemical and mechanical as well as cognitive cues. The significance of each of these factors will depend on the nature of the fatigue-inducing work that is being performed.\n\nThough not universally used, \"metabolic fatigue\" is a common alternative term for peripheral muscle weakness, because of the reduction in contractile force due to the direct or indirect effects of the reduction of substrates or accumulation of metabolites within the [[muscle fiber|myocytes]]. This can occur through a simple lack of energy to fuel contraction, or through interference with the ability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to stimulate [[actin]] and [[myosin]] to contract.\n\n==Management==\n{{Empty section|date=October 2017}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n|   DiseasesDB     = 22832\n|   ICD10          = {{ICD10|R|53||m|60}}\n|   ICD9           = {{ICD9|728.87}} ({{ICD9|728.9}} before 10/01/03); alternatively, {{ICD9|780.79}}\n|   ICDO           = \n|   MedlinePlus    = 003174\n|   eMedicineSubj  = \n|   eMedicineTopic = \n|   MeshID         = D018908\n}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.mcardlesdisease.org McArdle's disease]\n\n{{Myopathy}}\n{{Common Cold}}\n\n[[Category:Symptoms and signs: Nervous system]]\n[[Category:Neurological disorders]]\n[[Category:Muscular disorders]]\n[[Category:Symptoms and signs: musculoskeletal system]]\n", "name_user": "Dismanet", "label": "safe", "comment": "Adding new medical resources.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakness"}
