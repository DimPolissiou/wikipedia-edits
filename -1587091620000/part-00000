On his way to kendo practice, he comes across a girl named Mui Aiba in a school uniform he never saw before. After being nursed back to health by Takeshi, instead of thanking him, she accidentally turns him into a magician.\n\nTakeshi learns that the current world is actually split into two - the world that he's living in, and the world of magicians. He also learns that Mui is a magician enrolled in the Subaru Magic Academy, where many magicians can learn to control their powers and live in peace with regular humans. Instead of returning to the real world, Takeshi and his new magician friends Kurumi Isoshima and Kazumi Ida decide to enroll into the academy as well.\n\nThese three friends are fighting for different reasons, either to escape their turbulent past or to catch up to the future. They possess different abilities which they must learn to harness in order to fend off the Ghost Trailers, a group of magicians who are resorting to using violence to assert their superiority over humans. Takeshi and his friends must strive to become stronger and must face the Ghost Trailers' leader in order to prevent the Second Great Magic War from taking place.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n;{{Nihongo|Takeshi Nanase|\u4e03\u702c \u6b66|Nanase Takeshi}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Mamoru Miyano]]|Gabriel Regojo}}<ref name=\"sentaicastlist\">{{cite web | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-05-21/magical-warfare-english-dub-cast-unveiled/.88419 | title = Official Magical Warfare English Dub Cast List | work=[[Anime News Network]] | date = May 21, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}</ref>\n:The male protagonist. A high school freshman, he is talented in kendo with a serious personality. Takeshi has a cold relationship with his family and pretends to be in a relationship with his childhood friend Kurumi. This relationship is one of the main sources of conflict between him and his younger brother, Gekk\u014d. Since the beginning of middle school, he has chosen not to call Kurumi by her first name, instead referring to her \"Isoshima-san\", which is considered to be too polite for people who have known each other as long as they have. Takeshi became a magician after Mui unintentionally exposed him to magic shortly after they first met. Rather than return to the Real World with their magic sealed away permanently, he, along with Kurumi and Ida, chooses to become a magician and enrolls in Subaru Magic Academy. His magic is Evasive-type and his Aspect (the tool that acts as a focus through which magicians project their power) is a type of gun sword with the approximate length and weight of a kendo sword, that was named \"Twilight\" by its previous owner, one of the 15 'Great Magicians'. He loses his sword after the first fight with Gekkou. He appears to feel a great deal of affection for Kurumi, although not to the same extent as she does for him, and seems to be marginally aware of Mui's feelings for him, and recalled the promise about breaking off the fake relationship with Kurumi if they ever found a person they truly love while staring directly at Mui.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Mui Aiba|\u76f8\u7fbd \u516d|Aiba Mui}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Nao T\u014dyama]]|[[Allison Sumrall]]}}<ref name=\"sentaicastlist\"/>\n:One of the female protagonists. A magician who was found by Takeshi when she collapsed on the school grounds, and unintentionally turned him into magician by exposing him to magic. She uses Acceleration magic and is trying to release her older brother from Trailer's influence. When Takeshi and his friends enroll in Subaru Magic Academy, Mui is transferred to Class C as punishment, even though she is S-class in both theory and practical magic. Her Aspect is a gun she named \"Arthur\" and has had feelings for Takeshi ever since they kissed in the school infirmary.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kurumi Isoshima|\u4e94\u5341\u5cf6 \u304f\u308b\u307f|Isoshima Kurumi}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Asami Seto]]|Sara Ornelas}}<ref name=\"sentaicastlist\"/>\n:The other female protagonist. Kurumi is Takeshi's childhood friend and his fake girlfriend. She became a magician during the confrontation between Takeshi and the magicians from Trailer and gained Transformation magic. Her Aspect is a lipstick.\n:She is a beautiful girl and has been admired ever since she was young. From the time she entered middle school she was confessed to by numerous boys including, disturbingly, university students. After a traumatizing experience with a stalker, she asked Takeshi, whom she considered to be the only boy she could trust, to pretend to be her boyfriend to keep other boys away from her. This arrangement was to last until either of them found someone they truly love. Despite pretending to be in a relationship with Takeshi, she has genuine feelings for him and wishes to become a real couple.\n:As the story progresses, her traumatic past involving Takeshi and Gekk\u014d, her complex relationship with them, and the affections Takeshi, Gekk\u014d, and Takao Oigami all harbor toward her serve to move the plot forward. Kurumi later becomes Takeshi's reason for developing his abilities so that he can fight all-out against Gekk\u014d. Kazuma Ryuusenji, Trailer's leader, entrusts her with important truths.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kazumi Ida|\u4f0a\u7530 \u4e00\u4e09|Ida Kazumi}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kenichi Suzumura]]|Scott Gibbs}}<ref name=\"sentaicastlist\"/>\n:Takeshi's friend, who appears to be and acts like a punk with bleached spiky hair, earrings, and skull ring.

Kippei refers to her as 'V' and appears to be wary of her magical strength.

When Takeshi ran after his brother to explain the situation, Gekk\u014d was hit by a car. The accident caused lasting damage to Gekk\u014d's leg and forced him to quit kendo, the one thing he was better at than his older brother. Gekk\u014d's resentment of his brother over Kurumi changed into hatred because he blames his brother for stealing everything from him (first Kurumi, then kendo) and later, after years of mental abuse, \"running away\" to a new school (Subaru Magic Academy). Gekk\u014d follows Takeshi to Subaru Magic Academy, to his older brother's and Kurumi's surprise, and turns out to be a magician capable of casting very powerful and destructive magic. He became a magician through the intervention of Washizu. During Trailers' attack on the Academy it is revealed that he has a vindictive personality (and has always believed himself to be superior to his brother) and desires above all else to hurt Takeshi and take away everything that he holds dear.

Takeshi Nanase is motivated to pass the exam, as it would give them a chance to recover Tsuganashi Aiba. For the Evasive Magic portion of the exam, Takeshi must navigate through the city created by illusion magic, in order to reach the distant building. Students whom are injured would be withdrawled from the exam, regarding them as failing. The city is revealed to be littered with various obstacles, as a street is crowded with a large machine gun in the shape of a spider which causes huge destruction, but Takeshi manages to avoid it. He attempts to confront Takao Oigami, who is also attending the exam, but he seems to have no memory of him, and what went in the real world. However, the exam is infiltrated by Violet, and two other trailers, causing many of the levels in the exam to fall apart, leaving them in the Level 1 maze. Kurumi Isoshima is confused by the infiltration and destruction, and is about to be crushed by a giant robot, but Takao Oigami saves her life.

Momoka Shijou informs them of this, and that if she did not fulfill their promise, they might have resorted to doing it by their own means. She hands Mui Aiba a single bullet containing Binding Magic, which if shot accurately, would give her the chance to capture her brother without harming him. She summons a Black Door using her aspect, which pulls out two of the Ghost Trailers, Takao Oigami and Hotaru Kumagai, and they all follow through it. The students then find themselves in The Ruined World, and a vehicle magically appears there with Tsuganashi and Kippei Washizu. With the trade, Hotaru and Takao are forced to go over to the vehicle, but Hotaru denies being a trailer and this is all a prank, while Takao recalls that their memories must have been wiped. Kurumi Isoshima attempts to thank him again, but he tells her to grow stronger and hands her a mysterious object as Takao and Hotaru are escorted to Kippei, while Tsuganashi goes back to them, and later tries to fight them. However, they protect themselves against his ice spears. A large key is then summoned, and is spun around and in an aftermath cracks the concrete below them. He attempts to hook onto a building wall with his ice spear as he dangles off as it collapses below him, but Nanami Hyoudou breaks it. However, he launches back up to the ground level, impales two students with ice spears and flies off, while Mui follows her brother hot in pursuit. Kazumi Ida and Takeshi Nanase later follow them, in attempt to retrieve them both. Meanwhile, Momoka and Nippei are seen above a dilapidated bridge, and she claims that he was only her mentor before he became her enemy. He states that they were teammates before, but she claims that she should have killed him. After being accused of not caring about the trade situation, Momoka defends herself that she owed him due to the situation with Mitoka, but he claims his innocence only for her to attack him, but he dodges the blade. They later get into a magical duel, and he recalls his Destructive Magic, and that his attack can melt anything with his dissolve spell by just laying his eyes on it. He claims that everything around them will melt in thirteen minutes, and they both draw their blades in a battle. The bridge then collapses in their duel, and he compliments her serious power. She teleports her sword behind him in a strike to give an illusion that she was there, but he claims it's predictable, but is shown to be right back where she originally was and summons an arsenal shot. This causes the blade and bullets to go right at him, and he flies high in the air to escape, but the chains latch around his leg, capturing him, and dragging him down into a black ditch and shutting it in front of him in which he can have fun dying there by her words. It later explodes, seemingly killing him. However, blood starts to drip down her forehead and she is confused, and thinks that due to him being dead his magic shouldn't affect her Anymore. However, he emerges from the river still intact to her surprise and explains how he's still alive. He announces it's been eight minutes since he cast his spell on her, and her clothing is ripped up, she's bleeding and with bruises across her body. She later tries to finish him with Space Arc, but he still remains against the suction and she still continues to slowly die from Dissolve. However, a car from the debris is sucked up, which collides with Nippei and sucks him into the portal, and Momoka falls down into the ocean. Mui, Ida and Takeshi find themselves inside a mysterious ice lair, which is Tsuganashi's castle. Mui states that they'll need to break through the ceiling due to their being no entrance and Ida volunteers to do it to show off the flames he's been learning with all of his practice lessons. He summons fire from his ring, and it fires at the ceiling but does not destroy it. However, various ice spears attempt to impale them inside the lair, and they swiftly dodge them. Takeshi summons Liberate, and Ida hands him a bullet to load into the cartridge. The force of Union! Blast Fog sends him flying back onto the ground, with an explosion. Mui informs them that when two magicians share bullets that the other made, they have to be on the same wavelength in order for it to successfully work. He reveals to have been thinking of his lunch while doing it, explaining why it failed.  Takeshi attempts to retrieve his sword, but after getting a grip on it, his hands along with the sword are frozen solid. Mui eventually shoots through the ceiling to go chasing after her brother after becoming frustrated with him. She finds herself by his thrown, and he draws his sword while Ida tries to burn through the ice blocking Takeshi from escaping. He realizes that he should have never given up on Gekkou Nanase, and tells Ida to destroy the ice with one giant blast and he follows his orders. Meanwhile, Mui continues to try and reason with Tsunagashi despite his memory loss about them, and after asking him what he'd really like to be doing, he silences her and attempts to make her stop. She tells him her misery after being alone and away from him, and in a shock, he blasts her onto the ground. As he's about to finish her, the place goes up in flames as Takeshi and Ida return, in Mui's defense. Mui then gets up, and informs Tsuganashi that her only request is for him to smile like he once did before and that no matter what that if he's happy, she will be too. She admits that his change in personality from gentle to careless upsets her, and she slowly cries, only for tears to noticeably drip from his own eyes. He realizes that he was crying, and gets a quick flashback of past memories, and Mui prepares a bullet which she loads into her cartridge. She begs him to return to the way he used to be, and summons Liberate which causes her gun to increase in length drastically. This enrages Tsuganashi, and he charges at them but she fires the bullet, but the scene shifts to Momoka and Nanami, as the principal is shown to be recovering from her wounds and that Nanami was revealed to save her. Nanami claims that she needs to rest for a few months, but Momoka states that she'll get infested with mushrooms but Nanami replies that she'll bathe her daily, embarrassing her. Tsuganashi is shown to be recovered in the infirmary, as Mui rests her hand on his and he bids her a good morning. She hugs him in relief, glad that he's back and tells him to never go away again. Kippei is shown to be alive, and in the academy and meets Violet, who is shocked that he's still in fine condition after what happened. She brought them together to find a candidate for their missing fifth student, and asks for his suggestion. However, he promptly killed two of the men with them, shocking Violet, and he reveals that Kamura will shortly awaken and that the Reborn trailers would continue and the episode cuts off.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 7\n| Title           = The Magic Sword's Secret\n| TranslitTitle   = Maken no himitsu\n| NativeTitle     = \u9b54\u5263\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| DirectedBy      = Kiyoshi Murayama\n| WrittenBy       = Sayaka Harada\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|2|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = After the return of Tsuganashi Aiba, Takeshi keeps having nightmares during his sleep.

Gekk\u014d informs Takeshi that the accident was actually an assassination attempt arranged by their mother. Unwilling to believe that, a fight between the brothers ensues with Takeshi now able to fight with Gekk\u014d on even terms thanks to his mother's training. He is on the verge of gaining the upper hand when Gekk\u014d resorts to subterfuge to get Takeshi to drop his guard. Meanwhile, Kurumi has been searching the battlefield for Takeshi. She finds him just as Gekk\u014d is about to stab him and interposes herself at the last second, saving Takeshi, to the horror of both brothers. This galvanizes Takeshi and he starts fighting his brother in earnest. The engagement becomes so intense that their powers start to go out of control. Momoka appears and shoots a magical \"bomb\" towards both of them, causing them to disappear from the battlefield. Kazuma is shown in Takeshi's house. He has healed Y\u014dko and after calling her mother, he takes a picture of Isoshima from his pocket - that same picture of her that Takeshi has. The focus then shifts to a just-awakened Takeshi who finds himself on the Academy grounds, but they are strangely untouched by recent events. His mother and one of his teachers appear, only the teacher is calling her Sensei and Takeshi realizes that something is off. A nearby poster indicates that the year is 1998 - 16 years in the past. He then encounters other people he has met including Momoko, Washizu, Tsukiomi and Kazuma who appear to be friends. To his further surprise, Gekk\u014d runs up to the group while Takeshi sits on a bench trying to make sense of everything. The group walks past Takeshi and Gekk\u014d menacingly greets him.\n}}\n|}\n\n==Reception==\nSuzuki admitted that it was a mistake to have his light novel adapted into an anime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2014-01-16/even-magical-warfare-original-creator-didnt-think-the-anime-was-a-good-idea|title=Even Magical Warfare's Original Creator Didn't Think the Anime was a Good Idea|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=January 16, 2014|accessdate=May 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|http://www.mediafactory.co.jp/bunkoj/mahousensou/|Official light novel website}} {{in lang|ja}}\n*{{Official website|http://www.tbs.co.jp/anime/mahosen/|Official anime website}} {{in lang|ja}}\n*{{ann|light novel|17791}}\n\n{{Y\u016bz\u014d Sat\u014d}}\n{{Madhouse|state=collapsed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Magical Warfare}}\n[[Category:2011 Japanese novels]]\n[[Category:Adventure anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Anime and manga based on light novels]]\n[[Category:Fantasy anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Japanese fantasy novels]]\n[[Category:Light novels]]\n[[Category:Madhouse (company)]]\n[[Category:Fiction about magic]]\n[[Category:Mainichi Broadcasting System shows]]\n[[Category:Media Factory manga]]\n[[Category:MF Bunko J]]\n[[Category:Kadokawa Dwango franchises]]\n[[Category:Romance anime and manga]]\n[[Category:School life in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Sentai Filmworks]]\n[[Category:Sh\u014djo manga]]\n[[Category:Tokyo Broadcasting System shows]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = Magical Warfare\n| image           = Magical Warfare light novel volume 1 cover.jpg\n| caption         = First light novel volume cover featuring the character Mui Aiba\n| ja_kanji        = \u9b54\u6cd5\u6226\u4e89\n| ja_romaji       = Mahou Sensou\n| genre           = [[Adventure fiction|Adventure]], [[fantasy]], [[Romance novel|romance]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Magical Warfare |url=http://www.sentaifilmworks.com/catalog/magical-warfare |publisher=[[Sentai Filmworks]] |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Print\n| type            = light novel\n| author          = Hisashi Suzuki\n| illustrator     = Lunalia\n| publisher       = [[Media Factory]]\n| demographic     = Male\n| imprint         = [[MF Bunko J]]\n| first           = November 25, 2011\n| last            = September 25, 2015\n| volumes         = 12\n| volume_list     = #Light novels\n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Print\n| type            = manga\n| author          = Hisashi Suzuki\n| illustrator     = You Ibuki\n| publisher       = [[Media Factory]]\n| demographic     = ''[[Sh\u014djo manga|Sh\u014djo]]''\n| magazine        = [[Monthly Comic Gene]]\n| first           = April 15, 2013\n| last            = \n| volumes         = 5\n| volume_list     = #Manga\n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Video\n| type            = TV series\n| director        = Y\u016bz\u014d Sat\u014d\n| producer        = \n| writer          = Kazuyuki Fudeyasu\n| music           = Masato K\u014dda\n| studio          = [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]]\n| licensee        = {{English anime licensee|AUS=[[Madman Entertainment]]|NA=[[Sentai Filmworks]]}}\n| network         = [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]], [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]], [[Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting|CBC]], [[BS-TBS]]\n| network_en      = {{English anime network|US=[[Anime Network]]|NA=[[Animax|Animax 2.0 USA]]|SEA=[[Animax Asia]]}}\n| first           = January 9, 2014\n| last            = March 27, 2014\n| episodes        = 12\n| episode_list    = #Episode list\n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Footer}}\n{{Nihongo|'''''Magical Warfare'''''|\u9b54\u6cd5\u6226\u4e89|Mah\u014d Sens\u014d|lead=yes}} is a Japanese [[light novel]] series written by Hisashi Suzuki and illustrated by Lunalia.

On his way to kendo practice, he comes across a girl named Mui Aiba in a school uniform he never saw before. After being nursed back to health by Takeshi, instead of thanking him, she accidentally turns him into a magician.\n\nTakeshi learns that the current world is actually split into two - the world that he's living in, and the world of magicians. He also learns that Mui is a magician enrolled in the Subaru Magic Academy, where many magicians can learn to control their powers and live in peace with regular humans. Instead of returning to the real world, Takeshi and his new magician friends Kurumi Isoshima and Kazumi Ida decide to enroll into the academy as well.\n\nThese three friends are fighting for different reasons, either to escape their turbulent past or to catch up to the future. They possess different abilities which they must learn to harness in order to fend off the Ghost Trailers, a group of magicians who are resorting to using violence to assert their superiority over humans. Takeshi and his friends must strive to become stronger and must face the Ghost Trailers' leader in order to prevent the Second Great Magic War from taking place.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n;{{Nihongo|Takeshi Nanase|\u4e03\u702c \u6b66|Nanase Takeshi}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Mamoru Miyano]]|Gabriel Regojo}}<ref name=\"sentaicastlist\">{{cite web | url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-05-21/magical-warfare-english-dub-cast-unveiled/.88419 | title = Official Magical Warfare English Dub Cast List | work=[[Anime News Network]] | date = May 21, 2015|accessdate=May 21, 2015}}</ref>\n:The male protagonist. A high school freshman, he is talented in kendo with a serious personality. Takeshi has a cold relationship with his family and pretends to be in a relationship with his childhood friend Kurumi. This relationship is one of the main sources of conflict between him and his younger brother, Gekk\u014d. Since the beginning of middle school, he has chosen not to call Kurumi by her first name, instead referring to her \"Isoshima-san\", which is considered to be too polite for people who have known each other as long as they have. Takeshi became a magician after Mui unintentionally exposed him to magic shortly after they first met. Rather than return to the Real World with their magic sealed away permanently, he, along with Kurumi and Ida, chooses to become a magician and enrolls in Subaru Magic Academy. His magic is Evasive-type and his Aspect (the tool that acts as a focus through which magicians project their power) is a type of gun sword with the approximate length and weight of a kendo sword, that was named \"Twilight\" by its previous owner, one of the 15 'Great Magicians'. He loses his sword after the first fight with Gekkou. He appears to feel a great deal of affection for Kurumi, although not to the same extent as she does for him, and seems to be marginally aware of Mui's feelings for him, and recalled the promise about breaking off the fake relationship with Kurumi if they ever found a person they truly love while staring directly at Mui.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Mui Aiba|\u76f8\u7fbd \u516d|Aiba Mui}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Nao T\u014dyama]]|[[Allison Sumrall]]}}<ref name=\"sentaicastlist\"/>\n:One of the female protagonists. A magician who was found by Takeshi when she collapsed on the school grounds, and unintentionally turned him into magician by exposing him to magic. She uses Acceleration magic and is trying to release her older brother from Trailer's influence. When Takeshi and his friends enroll in Subaru Magic Academy, Mui is transferred to Class C as punishment, even though she is S-class in both theory and practical magic. Her Aspect is a gun she named \"Arthur\" and has had feelings for Takeshi ever since they kissed in the school infirmary.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kurumi Isoshima|\u4e94\u5341\u5cf6 \u304f\u308b\u307f|Isoshima Kurumi}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Asami Seto]]|Sara Ornelas}}<ref name=\"sentaicastlist\"/>\n:The other female protagonist. Kurumi is Takeshi's childhood friend and his fake girlfriend. She became a magician during the confrontation between Takeshi and the magicians from Trailer and gained Transformation magic. Her Aspect is a lipstick.\n:She is a beautiful girl and has been admired ever since she was young. From the time she entered middle school she was confessed to by numerous boys including, disturbingly, university students. After a traumatizing experience with a stalker, she asked Takeshi, whom she considered to be the only boy she could trust, to pretend to be her boyfriend to keep other boys away from her. This arrangement was to last until either of them found someone they truly love. Despite pretending to be in a relationship with Takeshi, she has genuine feelings for him and wishes to become a real couple.\n:As the story progresses, her traumatic past involving Takeshi and Gekk\u014d, her complex relationship with them, and the affections Takeshi, Gekk\u014d, and Takao Oigami all harbor toward her serve to move the plot forward. Kurumi later becomes Takeshi's reason for developing his abilities so that he can fight all-out against Gekk\u014d. Kazuma Ryuusenji, Trailer's leader, entrusts her with important truths.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kazumi Ida|\u4f0a\u7530 \u4e00\u4e09|Ida Kazumi}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kenichi Suzumura]]|Scott Gibbs}}<ref name=\"sentaicastlist\"/>\n:Takeshi's friend, who appears to be and acts like a punk with bleached spiky hair, earrings, and skull ring.

During one of these readings the fortune she tells Kurumi leads to her developing doubts about Takeshi. Violet is revealed to be a member of Trailer, having killed an entire party of magicians from Wizard Brace to keep her identity secret. Kippei refers to her as 'V' and appears to be wary of her magical strength. Her position as a teacher and her fortune telling sideshow allow her to gather information, influence students to either act as Trailer wishes (e.g. by giving out false information, leading them into traps etc.) or join Trailer or to become more susceptible to being influenced by Trailer.\n\n===Ghost Trailer===\n;{{Nihongo|Gekk\u014d Nanase|\u4e03\u702c \u6708\u5149|Nanase Gekk\u014d}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Nobuhiko Okamoto]]|[[Clint Bickham]]}}<ref name=\"sentaicastlist\"/>\n:Takeshi's younger brother and the main antagonist.

The brothers' relationship soured after Gekk\u014d confronted Takeshi about his new 'relationship' with Kurumi, accusing him of taking advantage of her vulnerable state after the stalker incident. When Takeshi ran after his brother to explain the situation, Gekk\u014d was hit by a car. The accident caused lasting damage to Gekk\u014d's leg and forced him to quit kendo, the one thing he was better at than his older brother. Gekk\u014d's resentment of his brother over Kurumi changed into hatred because he blames his brother for stealing everything from him (first Kurumi, then kendo) and later, after years of mental abuse, \"running away\" to a new school (Subaru Magic Academy). Gekk\u014d follows Takeshi to Subaru Magic Academy, to his older brother's and Kurumi's surprise, and turns out to be a magician capable of casting very powerful and destructive magic. He became a magician through the intervention of Washizu. During Trailers' attack on the Academy it is revealed that he has a vindictive personality (and has always believed himself to be superior to his brother) and desires above all else to hurt Takeshi and take away everything that he holds dear. Gekkou although loses to Takeshi after the second fight in their hometown and the Gun Sword \"Twilight\" returns to Takeshi.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tsuganashi Aiba|\u76f8\u7fbd \u5341|Aiba Tsuganashi}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Toshiyuki Morikawa]]|[[Leraldo Anzaldua]]}}<ref name=\"sentaicastlist\"/>\n:Mui's older brother, whose memories were erased by Ghost Trailers.

Takeshi Nanase is motivated to pass the exam, as it would give them a chance to recover Tsuganashi Aiba. For the Evasive Magic portion of the exam, Takeshi must navigate through the city created by illusion magic, in order to reach the distant building. Students whom are injured would be withdrawled from the exam, regarding them as failing. The city is revealed to be littered with various obstacles, as a street is crowded with a large machine gun in the shape of a spider which causes huge destruction, but Takeshi manages to avoid it. He attempts to confront Takao Oigami, who is also attending the exam, but he seems to have no memory of him, and what went in the real world. However, the exam is infiltrated by Violet, and two other trailers, causing many of the levels in the exam to fall apart, leaving them in the Level 1 maze. Kurumi Isoshima is confused by the infiltration and destruction, and is about to be crushed by a giant robot, but Takao Oigami saves her life. She tries to confront him about what went down in the real world similar to Takeshi, but he still has no memory and is withdrawn from the exam after getting hit by the robot, destroyed by him.\n\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| Title           = Battle and Recovery\n| TranslitTitle   = Gekit\u014d to dakkan\n| NativeTitle     = \u6fc0\u95d8\u3068\u596a\u9084\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| DirectedBy      = Akira Mano\n| WrittenBy       = Momoko Murakami\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|2|13}}\n| ShortSummary    = With the success in the magic exam, they had been given the chance to recover Tsuganashi Aiba. Momoka Shijou informs them of this, and that if she did not fulfill their promise, they might have resorted to doing it by their own means. She hands Mui Aiba a single bullet containing Binding Magic, which if shot accurately, would give her the chance to capture her brother without harming him. She summons a Black Door using her aspect, which pulls out two of the Ghost Trailers, Takao Oigami and Hotaru Kumagai, and they all follow through it. The students then find themselves in The Ruined World, and a vehicle magically appears there with Tsuganashi and Kippei Washizu. With the trade, Hotaru and Takao are forced to go over to the vehicle, but Hotaru denies being a trailer and this is all a prank, while Takao recalls that their memories must have been wiped. Kurumi Isoshima attempts to thank him again, but he tells her to grow stronger and hands her a mysterious object as Takao and Hotaru are escorted to Kippei, while Tsuganashi goes back to them, and later tries to fight them. However, they protect themselves against his ice spears. A large key is then summoned, and is spun around and in an aftermath cracks the concrete below them. He attempts to hook onto a building wall with his ice spear as he dangles off as it collapses below him, but Nanami Hyoudou breaks it. However, he launches back up to the ground level, impales two students with ice spears and flies off, while Mui follows her brother hot in pursuit. Kazumi Ida and Takeshi Nanase later follow them, in attempt to retrieve them both. Meanwhile, Momoka and Nippei are seen above a dilapidated bridge, and she claims that he was only her mentor before he became her enemy. He states that they were teammates before, but she claims that she should have killed him. After being accused of not caring about the trade situation, Momoka defends herself that she owed him due to the situation with Mitoka, but he claims his innocence only for her to attack him, but he dodges the blade. They later get into a magical duel, and he recalls his Destructive Magic, and that his attack can melt anything with his dissolve spell by just laying his eyes on it. He claims that everything around them will melt in thirteen minutes, and they both draw their blades in a battle. The bridge then collapses in their duel, and he compliments her serious power. She teleports her sword behind him in a strike to give an illusion that she was there, but he claims it's predictable, but is shown to be right back where she originally was and summons an arsenal shot. This causes the blade and bullets to go right at him, and he flies high in the air to escape, but the chains latch around his leg, capturing him, and dragging him down into a black ditch and shutting it in front of him in which he can have fun dying there by her words. It later explodes, seemingly killing him. However, blood starts to drip down her forehead and she is confused, and thinks that due to him being dead his magic shouldn't affect her Anymore. However, he emerges from the river still intact to her surprise and explains how he's still alive. He announces it's been eight minutes since he cast his spell on her, and her clothing is ripped up, she's bleeding and with bruises across her body. She later tries to finish him with Space Arc, but he still remains against the suction and she still continues to slowly die from Dissolve. However, a car from the debris is sucked up, which collides with Nippei and sucks him into the portal, and Momoka falls down into the ocean. Mui, Ida and Takeshi find themselves inside a mysterious ice lair, which is Tsuganashi's castle. Mui states that they'll need to break through the ceiling due to their being no entrance and Ida volunteers to do it to show off the flames he's been learning with all of his practice lessons. He summons fire from his ring, and it fires at the ceiling but does not destroy it. However, various ice spears attempt to impale them inside the lair, and they swiftly dodge them. Takeshi summons Liberate, and Ida hands him a bullet to load into the cartridge. The force of Union! Blast Fog sends him flying back onto the ground, with an explosion. Mui informs them that when two magicians share bullets that the other made, they have to be on the same wavelength in order for it to successfully work. He reveals to have been thinking of his lunch while doing it, explaining why it failed.  Takeshi attempts to retrieve his sword, but after getting a grip on it, his hands along with the sword are frozen solid. Mui eventually shoots through the ceiling to go chasing after her brother after becoming frustrated with him. She finds herself by his thrown, and he draws his sword while Ida tries to burn through the ice blocking Takeshi from escaping. He realizes that he should have never given up on Gekkou Nanase, and tells Ida to destroy the ice with one giant blast and he follows his orders. Meanwhile, Mui continues to try and reason with Tsunagashi despite his memory loss about them, and after asking him what he'd really like to be doing, he silences her and attempts to make her stop. She tells him her misery after being alone and away from him, and in a shock, he blasts her onto the ground. As he's about to finish her, the place goes up in flames as Takeshi and Ida return, in Mui's defense. Mui then gets up, and informs Tsuganashi that her only request is for him to smile like he once did before and that no matter what that if he's happy, she will be too. She admits that his change in personality from gentle to careless upsets her, and she slowly cries, only for tears to noticeably drip from his own eyes. He realizes that he was crying, and gets a quick flashback of past memories, and Mui prepares a bullet which she loads into her cartridge. She begs him to return to the way he used to be, and summons Liberate which causes her gun to increase in length drastically. This enrages Tsuganashi, and he charges at them but she fires the bullet, but the scene shifts to Momoka and Nanami, as the principal is shown to be recovering from her wounds and that Nanami was revealed to save her. Nanami claims that she needs to rest for a few months, but Momoka states that she'll get infested with mushrooms but Nanami replies that she'll bathe her daily, embarrassing her. Tsuganashi is shown to be recovered in the infirmary, as Mui rests her hand on his and he bids her a good morning. She hugs him in relief, glad that he's back and tells him to never go away again. Kippei is shown to be alive, and in the academy and meets Violet, who is shocked that he's still in fine condition after what happened. She brought them together to find a candidate for their missing fifth student, and asks for his suggestion. However, he promptly killed two of the men with them, shocking Violet, and he reveals that Kamura will shortly awaken and that the Reborn trailers would continue and the episode cuts off.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 7\n| Title           = The Magic Sword's Secret\n| TranslitTitle   = Maken no himitsu\n| NativeTitle     = \u9b54\u5263\u306e\u79d8\u5bc6\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| DirectedBy      = Kiyoshi Murayama\n| WrittenBy       = Sayaka Harada\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|2|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = After the return of Tsuganashi Aiba, Takeshi keeps having nightmares during his sleep.

He fears the worst, given his precognitive dream (that Gekk\u014d kills their mother) and demands that Gekk\u014d let him pass. Gekk\u014d informs Takeshi that the accident was actually an assassination attempt arranged by their mother. Unwilling to believe that, a fight between the brothers ensues with Takeshi now able to fight with Gekk\u014d on even terms thanks to his mother's training. He is on the verge of gaining the upper hand when Gekk\u014d resorts to subterfuge to get Takeshi to drop his guard. Meanwhile, Kurumi has been searching the battlefield for Takeshi. She finds him just as Gekk\u014d is about to stab him and interposes herself at the last second, saving Takeshi, to the horror of both brothers. This galvanizes Takeshi and he starts fighting his brother in earnest. The engagement becomes so intense that their powers start to go out of control. Momoka appears and shoots a magical \"bomb\" towards both of them, causing them to disappear from the battlefield. Kazuma is shown in Takeshi's house. He has healed Y\u014dko and after calling her mother, he takes a picture of Isoshima from his pocket - that same picture of her that Takeshi has. The focus then shifts to a just-awakened Takeshi who finds himself on the Academy grounds, but they are strangely untouched by recent events. His mother and one of his teachers appear, only the teacher is calling her Sensei and Takeshi realizes that something is off. A nearby poster indicates that the year is 1998 - 16 years in the past. He then encounters other people he has met including Momoko, Washizu, Tsukiomi and Kazuma who appear to be friends. To his further surprise, Gekk\u014d runs up to the group while Takeshi sits on a bench trying to make sense of everything.

In December 1962, the South Korean Ministry of Public Health and Social Affairs, to which the emigration section was attached, sent 92 people (members of seventeen families) to [[Brazil]]. Although the South Korean government's desire to direct emigrants to the [[Southern Hemisphere]] was based on the size of the Brazilian economy, many [[Koreans]] were hindered by the Brazilian government's demand that all visas, including those for tourists, be preapproved.\n\n==Life in Brazil==\nThere has been a large flow of undocumented Korean migrants from [[Paraguay]] to [[Brazil]]. In 1992, the South Korean embassy in Brazil extrapolated a population of about 40,000, based on families registered at its various consulates in Brazil. This sample may be underrepresenting the numbers significantly, since both documented and especially undocumented immigrants may choose not to register with [[List of diplomatic missions of South Korea|South Korean diplomatic missions]] in Brazil. Unofficial estimates put the Korean population of Brazil at between two and three times that of the embassy. The overwhelming majority (90 percent)<ref>[http://www.everyculture.com/South-America/Asians-in-South-America.html Asians in South America<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> of Korean immigrants live in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], where they have created some 2,500 small businesses, most of which are [[home business]]es produce textiles and clothing. Koreans are believed to control two-thirds of the clothing retail business, and their materials travel all over Brazil. Some Koreans also work in the field of [[electronic engineering]] and in the export-import trade. In S\u00e3o Paulo, the majority of Koreans live either in [[Liberdade (district of S\u00e3o Paulo)|Liberdade neighborhood]], the traditional Japanese neighborhood; in [[Bom Retiro, S\u00e3o Paulo|Bom Retiro]], a traditional immigrant neighborhood most recently populated by East European Jews and the Lebanese; in Br\u00e1s, the former Italian neighborhood, and in the upper-middle-class neighborhood of [[Aclima\u00e7\u00e3o]] where 30% of the area's resident population is made up of Korean or of Korean origin. The Pra\u00e7a General Polidoro square in Aclima\u00e7\u00e3o is surrounded by Korean restaurants, churches and other businesses.\n\nOn 6 January 2010, per Municipal Law n\u00ba 15100, the S\u00e3o Paulo City Council officially recognised Bom Retiro as the Korean cultural neighbourhood.<ref>Prefeitura da Cidade de S\u00e3o Paulo.

Most Koreans decided to stay in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], where they could seek out profitable businesses and build a strong ethnic community in the city. Since the late 1980s, the economic situations of Koreans in Brazil have slowly deteriorated. Many successful [[Koreans]] who accumulated sufficient wealth abandoned Brazil to look for economic opportunities elsewhere. Some non-affluent Koreans who failed to adjust to Brazilian society also did not find bright futures in Brazil. Some Korean immigrants in Brazil decided to return to their homeland, the economy of which has grown much faster than Brazil's since the 1980s.

In December 1962, the South Korean Ministry of Public Health and Social Affairs, to which the emigration section was attached, sent 92 people (members of seventeen families) to [[Brazil]]. Although the South Korean government's desire to direct emigrants to the [[Southern Hemisphere]] was based on the size of the Brazilian economy, many [[Koreans]] were hindered by the Brazilian government's demand that all visas, including those for tourists, be preapproved.\n\n==Life in Brazil==\nThere has been a large flow of undocumented Korean migrants from [[Paraguay]] to [[Brazil]]. In 1992, the South Korean embassy in Brazil extrapolated a population of about 40,000, based on families registered at its various consulates in Brazil. This sample may be underrepresenting the numbers significantly, since both documented and especially undocumented immigrants may choose not to register with [[List of diplomatic missions of South Korea|South Korean diplomatic missions]] in Brazil. Unofficial estimates put the Korean population of Brazil at between two and three times that of the embassy. The overwhelming majority (90 percent)<ref>[http://www.everyculture.com/South-America/Asians-in-South-America.html Asians in South America<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> of Korean immigrants live in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], where they have created some 2,500 small businesses, most of which are [[home business]]es produce textiles and clothing. Koreans are believed to control two-thirds of the clothing retail business, and their materials travel all over Brazil. Some Koreans also work in the field of [[electronic engineering]] and in the export-import trade. In S\u00e3o Paulo, the majority of Koreans live either in [[Liberdade (district of S\u00e3o Paulo)|Liberdade neighborhood]], the traditional Japanese neighborhood; in [[Bom Retiro, S\u00e3o Paulo|Bom Retiro]], a traditional immigrant neighborhood most recently populated by East European Jews and the Lebanese; in Br\u00e1s, the former Italian neighborhood, and in the upper-middle-class neighborhood of [[Aclima\u00e7\u00e3o]] where 30% of the area's resident population is made up of Korean or of Korean origin. The Pra\u00e7a General Polidoro square in Aclima\u00e7\u00e3o is surrounded by Korean restaurants, churches and other businesses.\n\nOn 6 January 2010, per Municipal Law n\u00ba 15100, the S\u00e3o Paulo City Council officially recognised Bom Retiro as the Korean cultural neighbourhood.<ref>Prefeitura da Cidade de S\u00e3o Paulo.

Most Koreans decided to stay in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], where they could seek out profitable businesses and build a strong ethnic community in the city. Since the late 1980s, the economic situations of Koreans in Brazil have slowly deteriorated. Many successful [[Koreans]] who accumulated sufficient wealth abandoned Brazil to look for economic opportunities elsewhere. Some non-affluent Koreans who failed to adjust to Brazilian society also did not find bright futures in Brazil. Some Korean immigrants in Brazil decided to return to their homeland, the economy of which has grown much faster than Brazil\u2019s since the 1980s.

It was held on Tuesday, November 8, 1960. In a closely contested election, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[John F. Kennedy]] defeated incumbent [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nominee. This was the first election in which fifty states participated and the last in which the [[District of Columbia]] did not. It was also the first election in which an incumbent president was ineligible to run for a third term because of the term limits established by the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment]]. It is also the last election where the losing candidate won [[Ohio]].\n\nNixon faced little opposition in the Republican race to succeed popular incumbent [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Kennedy, a junior [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Massachusetts]], established himself as the Democratic front-runner with his strong performance in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1960|1960 Democratic primaries]], including a key victory in [[West Virginia]] over [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Hubert Humphrey]]. He defeated Senate Majority Leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on the first presidential ballot of the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]], and asked Johnson to serve as his running mate. The issue of the [[Cold War]] dominated the election, as tensions were high between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nKennedy won a 303 to 219 [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] victory and is generally considered to have won the national popular vote by 112,827, a margin of 0.17 percent, though some argue that Nixon should be credited with the popular vote victory,<ref>https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/10/19/did_jfk_lose_the_popular_vote_115833.html</ref> as the issue of the popular vote was complicated by the presence of several [[unpledged elector]]s in the [[Deep South]]. Fourteen unpledged electors from [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]] cast their vote for Senator [[Harry F. Byrd]], as did a [[faithless elector]] from [[Oklahoma]]. The 1960 presidential election was the closest election since [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]], and this closeness can be explained by a number of factors.<ref>Rorabaugh (2009)</ref> Kennedy benefited from the [[Recession of 1958|economic recession of 1957\u201358]], which hurt the standing of the [[incumbent]] Republican Party, and he had the advantage of 17 million more registered Democrats than Republicans.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ann Mari |last=May |title=President Eisenhower, Economic Policy, and the 1960 Presidential Election |journal=[[Journal of Economic History]] |volume=50 |issue=2 |year=1990 |pages=417\u2013427 |jstor=2123282 |doi=10.1017/s0022050700036536|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1023&context=cbafacpub }}</ref> Furthermore, the new votes that Kennedy, the first [[Roman Catholic]] president, gained among Catholics almost neutralized the new votes Nixon gained among [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestants]].<ref>Casey (2009)</ref> Kennedy's campaigning skills decisively outmatched Nixon's, who wasted time and resources campaigning in all fifty states while Kennedy focused on campaigning in populous [[swing states]].

Several other candidates sought support in their home state or region as \"[[favorite son]]\" candidates without any realistic chance of winning the nomination. Symington, Stevenson, and Johnson all declined to campaign in the presidential primaries. While this reduced their potential delegate count going into the Democratic National Convention, each of these three candidates hoped that the other leading contenders would stumble in the primaries, thus causing the convention's delegates to choose him as a \"compromise\" candidate acceptable to all factions of the party.\n\nKennedy was initially dogged by suggestions from some [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] elders (such as former [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Harry S. Truman]], who was supporting Symington) that he was too youthful and inexperienced to be president; these critics suggested that he should agree to be the [[running mate]] for another Democrat. Realizing that this was a strategy touted by his opponents to keep the public from taking him seriously, Kennedy stated frankly, \"I'm not running for vice president, I'm running for president.\"<ref>[[Jeff Zeleny|Zeleny, Jeff]]; Bosman, Julie (March 11, 2008).

Kennedy's [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] religion was an issue. Kennedy first challenged Minnesota Senator Hubert Humphrey in the Wisconsin primary and defeated him. Kennedy's attractive sisters, brothers, and wife Jacqueline combed the state looking for votes, leading Humphrey to complain that he \"felt like an independent merchant competing against a chain store.\"<ref>Humphrey, Hubert H.

In the end, Kennedy defeated Humphrey with over 60% of the vote, and Humphrey ended his presidential campaign. [[West Virginia]] showed that Kennedy, a Catholic, could win in a heavily Protestant state.

Even though Stevenson had twice been the Democratic Party's presidential candidate and retained a loyal following of liberals, his two landslide defeats to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Dwight Eisenhower|Dwight D. Eisenhower]] led most party leaders and delegates to search for a \"fresh face\" who could win a national election. Following the primaries, Kennedy traveled around the nation speaking to state delegations and their leaders. As the Democratic Convention opened, Kennedy was far in the lead, but was still seen as being just short of the delegate total he needed to win.\n\n====Democratic convention====\nThe [[1960 Democratic National Convention]] was held in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]]. In the week before the convention opened, Kennedy received two new challengers when Lyndon B. Johnson, the powerful [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] from Texas, and Adlai Stevenson, the party's nominee in 1952 and 1956, officially announced their candidacies (they had both privately been working for the nomination for some time). However, neither Johnson nor Stevenson was a match for the talented and highly efficient Kennedy campaign team led by [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. Johnson challenged Kennedy to a televised debate before a joint meeting of the Texas and Massachusetts delegations, to which Kennedy accepted. Most observers believed that Kennedy won the debate, and Johnson was unable to expand his delegate support beyond the South. Stevenson's failure to launch his candidacy publicly until the week of the convention meant that many liberal delegates who might have supported him were already pledged to Kennedy, and Stevenson\u2014despite the energetic support of former First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]\u2014could not break their allegiance. Kennedy won the nomination on the first ballot.\n\nThen, in a move that surprised many, Kennedy asked Johnson to be his running mate. He realized that he could not be elected without the support of traditional [[Southern Democrats]], most of whom had backed Johnson. He offered Johnson the vice presidential nomination at the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel]] at 10:15&nbsp;a.m. on July 14, 1960, the morning after being nominated for president.<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121\u2013135.

[[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]], and [[Seymour Hersh]] quoted Robert Kennedy's version of events, writing that John Kennedy \"would have preferred [[Stuart Symington]] as his [[running-mate]]\" and that Johnson teamed with [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Sam Rayburn]] to \"pressure Kennedy to offer the nomination\". Hersh goes on to present an alternative version of events; he writes that Kennedy was essentially blackmailed into offering the vice presidency to Johnson. The same story was originally presented by [[Anthony Summers]] in his biography of FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. [[Evelyn Lincoln]], Kennedy's personal secretary, told Summers in an interview that she was convinced in mid-1960 that J. Edgar Hoover and Johnson had conspired. Hoover was known to keep detailed files on the personal lives of many political figures and Kennedy was no exception. Hoover obtained information about Jack's womanizing prior to the election from at least two different sources. In January 1942, while Jack was serving in the [[United States Navy]], FBI surveillance records confirmed that he was having an affair with a woman named [[Inga Arvad]]; then, in 1958, a couple named Leonard and Florence Kater found out that their tenant, [[Pamela Turnure]], a secretary in Kennedy's Senate office, had been having an affair with the soon-to-be president. The Katers rigged up a tape recorder to pick up the sounds of the couple's lovemaking and snapped a picture of Kennedy himself. The Katers sent this information to the newspapers and one company - Stearn Publications - passed it along to Hoover. Soon after, \"he quietly obtained a copy of the compromising sex tapes and offered them to Lyndon Johnson as campaign ammunition.\" Lincoln said that Johnson \"had been using all the information Hoover could find on Kennedy - during the campaign, even before the Convention. And Hoover was in on the pressure on Kennedy at the Convention.\" A few days after the offer was made, [[Pierre Salinger]], the campaign's press secretary, had asked Jack Kennedy whether he really expected Johnson to accept the offer or if he was merely making a polite gesture. Kennedy responded cryptically: \"The whole story will never be known. And it's just as well that it won't be.\" \"The only people who were involved in the discussions were Jack and myself,\" said Robert Kennedy. \"We both promised each other that we'd never tell what happened.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J.

Hersh]], ''The Dark Side of Camelot'', 1997, Chapter 12</ref>\n\nBiographers [[Robert Caro]] and [[W. Marvin Watson]] offer a different perspective; they write that the Kennedy campaign was desperate to win what was forecast to be a very close race against [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]]. Johnson was needed on the ticket to help carry votes from Texas and the [[Southern United States]]. Caro's research showed that on July 14, Kennedy started the process while Johnson was still asleep. At 6:30&nbsp;a.m., Kennedy asked his brother to prepare an estimate of upcoming electoral votes, \"including Texas.\"<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121\u2013135. JFK offers vice presidency to LBJ\"/> Robert Kennedy called [[Pierre Salinger]] and [[Kenneth O'Donnell]] to assist him. Realizing the ramifications of counting Texas votes as their own, Salinger asked him whether he was considering a Kennedy-Johnson ticket, and Robert replied, \"yes\".<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121\u2013135. JFK offers vice presidency to LBJ\"/> Between 9 and 10 a.m., John Kennedy called Pennsylvania governor [[David L. Lawrence]], a Johnson backer, to request that Lawrence nominate Johnson for vice president if Johnson were to accept the role and then went to Johnson's suite to discuss a mutual ticket at 10:15&nbsp;a.m. John Kennedy then returned to his suite to announce the Kennedy-Johnson ticket to his closest supporters and Northern political bosses. He accepted the congratulations of [[List of governors of Ohio|Ohio Governor]] [[Michael DiSalle]], [[List of governors of Connecticut|Connecticut Governor]] [[Abraham A. Ribicoff]], [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago mayor]] [[Richard J. Daley]], and [[Mayor of New York City|New York City mayor]] [[Robert F. Wagner Jr.]]. Lawrence said that \"Johnson has the strength where you need it most\"; he then left to begin writing the nomination speech.<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121\u2013135. JFK offers vice presidency to LBJ\"/> O'Donnell remembers being angry at what he considered a betrayal by John Kennedy, who had previously cast Johnson as anti-labor and anti-liberal. Afterward, Robert Kennedy visited with labor leaders who were extremely unhappy with the choice of Johnson and after seeing the depth of labor opposition to Johnson, he ran messages between the hotel suites of his brother and Johnson, apparently trying to undermine the proposed ticket without John Kennedy's authorization and to get Johnson to agree to be the Democratic Party chairman rather than vice president. Johnson refused to accept a change in plans unless it came directly from John Kennedy. Despite his brother's interference, John Kennedy was firm that Johnson was who he wanted as running mate and met with staffers such as [[Larry O'Brien]], his national campaign manager, to say Johnson was to be vice president. O'Brien recalled later that John Kennedy's words were wholly unexpected, but that after a brief consideration of the electoral vote situation, he thought \"it was a stroke of genius\".<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121\u2013135.

Eisenhower could not run for the office of president again; he had been elected in 1952 and 1956.\n\nIn 1959, it looked as if Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] might face a serious challenge for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination from New York Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], the leader of the Republican moderate-liberal wing. However, Rockefeller announced that he would not be a candidate for president after a national tour revealed that the great majority of Republicans favored Nixon.<ref>(White, pp. 91\u201392)</ref>\n\nAfter Rockefeller's withdrawal, Nixon faced no significant opposition for the Republican nomination. At the [[1960 Republican National Convention]] in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], Nixon was the overwhelming choice of the delegates, with conservative Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] from Arizona receiving 10 votes from conservative delegates. In earning the nomination, Nixon became the first sitting vice president to run for president since [[John C. Breckinridge]] exactly a century prior. Nixon then chose former Massachusetts Senator and [[United Nations]] Ambassador [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], as his vice presidential running mate. Nixon chose Lodge because his foreign-policy credentials fit into Nixon's strategy to campaign more on foreign policy than domestic policy, which he believed favored the Democrats. Nixon had previously sought Rockefeller as his running mate, but the governor had no ambitions to be vice president. However, he later served as [[Gerald Ford]]'s vice president from 1974 to 1977.<ref>(White, pp. 242\u2013243)</ref>\n\n==General election==\n\n===Campaign promises===\n[[File:Dwight David Eisenhower, photo portrait by Bachrach, 1952.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the incumbent president in 1960, whose term expired on January 20, 1961]]\nDuring the campaign, Kennedy charged that under Eisenhower and the Republicans the nation had fallen behind the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]], both militarily and economically, and that as president he would \"get America moving again.\" The Eisenhower administration had established NASA in 1958, but Kennedy believed that the Republican Party had ignored the need to catch up to the Soviet Union in the Space Race. He promised that the new Democratic administration would fully appreciate the importance of space accomplishments for the national security and international prestige of the United States. Nixon responded that, if elected, he would continue the \"peace and prosperity\" that Eisenhower had brought the nation in the 1950s.  Nixon also argued that with the nation engaged in the Cold War with the Soviets, that Kennedy was too young and inexperienced to be trusted with the presidency. Had Nixon been elected, at 48 years, 11 days, he would have been [[List of Presidents of the United States by age|the fourth-youngest]] president at the date of inauguration. Kennedy, by contrast, was 43 years, 236 days, on the date of his inauguration; the second-youngest man to begin a Presidency (at 42 [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who [[First inauguration of Theodore Roosevelt|assumed the Presidency]] upon the [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassination of United States President William McKinley]] 60 years previously, was the youngest).\n\nDuring Kennedy's campaign he relied on his youth and promised to bring about change. Kennedy had a slogan emphasizing his youth reading, \"who's seasoned through and through/but not so dog-gone seasoned that he won't try something new.\" He was also endorsed by celebrities such as [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Harry Belafonte]]. Nixon relied on his experience in politics. He emphasized to the American voters that he was more qualified to hold the office of president. He wanted voters to know that he had the abilities to take on Communist threats.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Byung Joon|date=September 2016|title=Attacking the Airwaves: How Television Changed the American Presidential Campaign|url=|journal=The New England Journal of History|volume=73|pages=1\u201327}}</ref>\n\n===Campaign events===\n[[File:John F.

However, Nixon was plagued by bad luck throughout the fall campaign. In August, President Eisenhower, who had long been ambivalent about Nixon, held a televised press conference in which a reporter, Charles Mohr of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', mentioned Nixon's claims that he had been a valuable administration insider and adviser. Mohr asked Eisenhower if he could give an example of a major idea of Nixon's that he had heeded. Eisenhower responded with the flip comment, \"If you give me a week, I might think of one.\"<ref>Ambrose, Stephen E. (1991). ''Eisenhower: Soldier and President'', p. 525. Simon and Schuster. {{ISBN|0-671-74758-4}}.</ref> Although both Eisenhower and Nixon later claimed that he was merely joking with the reporter, the remark hurt Nixon, as it undercut his claims of having greater decision-making experience than Kennedy. The remark proved so damaging to Nixon that the Democrats turned Eisenhower's statement into a television commercial.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nixon's Experience?

This pledge backfired when, in August, Nixon injured his knee on a car door while campaigning in [[North Carolina]]. The knee became infected and Nixon had to cease campaigning for two weeks while the infection was treated with [[Antibacterial|antibiotics]]. When he left [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed Hospital]], Nixon refused to abandon his pledge to visit every state; he thus wound up wasting valuable time visiting states that he had no chance of winning, or that had few electoral votes and would be of little help at the election, or states that he would almost certainly win regardless. For example, in his effort to visit all 50 states, Nixon spent the vital weekend before the election campaigning in Alaska, which had only three electoral votes, while Kennedy campaigned in more populous states, such as New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.\n\nNixon visited Atlanta, Georgia on August 26 and acquired a very large turnout to his event. Nixon rode through a parade in Atlanta and was greeted by 150,000 people.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=The Nixon-Kennedy Campaigns In Georgia|last=Fleming|first=K|date=November 1960|work=The Atlanta-Journal and Constitution|access-date=}}</ref> Nixon mentioned in his speech in Atlanta, \"in the last quarter of a century there hasn't been a Democratic candidate for President that has bothered to campaign in the State of Georgia.\"<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=25759|title=John F.

Kennedy would change that statistic and visit some surprising states, including Georgia. Senator Kennedy visited the cities of Columbus, Warm Springs, and Lagrange on his campaign trail in Georgia. In his visit to Warm Springs, state troopers tried to keep Kennedy from an immense crowd, however Kennedy reached out to shake hands of those who were sick with polio.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Cheering Throng Engulfs Kennedy|last=Galphin|first=B|date=October 11, 1960|work=The Atlanta-Journal Constitution|access-date=}}</ref> He also visited small towns across Georgia on his trip and saw a mass of 100,000 people during the entire visit. Kennedy spoke at a rehabilitation facility in Warm Springs. Warm Springs was near and dear to Kennedy's heart due to the effects the facility had on [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Roosevelt spent time at the rehabilitation facility and died there in 1945.<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\"/>\n\nIn Warm Springs, Kennedy spoke to supporters at the facility and mentioned Franklin D. Roosevelt in his speech. He admired Roosevelt and commended him for sticking up for the farmers, workers, small towns, big cities, those in poverty, and those who were sick.<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\" /> He said Roosevelt had a \"spirit of strength and progress to get America moving.\"<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\" /> Kennedy discussed his six-point plan for healthcare. He wanted a medical program set up for retirement and federal funding for the construction of medical schools and hospitals. He also planned for the government to loan students money to attend medical school and provide grants to renovate old hospitals. He called for more money to be spent on medical research and finally, expand effort for rehabilitation and come up with new ways to assist those in need.<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\" /> Many Republicans disapproved Kennedy's plans and described them as an \"appeal to socialism\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Kennedy's Plans Altered: Crowd of 50,000 Is Seen|last=Gaines|first=Marion|date=October 6, 1960|work=The Atlanta-Journal Constitution|access-date=}}</ref> People around Warm Springs were supportive of Kennedy.

Johnson vigorously campaigned for Kennedy and was instrumental in helping the Democrats to carry several Southern states skeptical of him, especially Johnson's home state of Texas. Johnson made a \"last-minute change of plans and scheduled two 12-minute whistlestop speeches in Georgia\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Johnson Due in State Tonight|last=|first=|date=October 11, 1960|work=The Atlanta Constitution|access-date=}}</ref> One of these visits included stopping in Atlanta to speak from the rear of a train at Terminal Station.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=|title=New President Johnson An Old Friend to Georgia|last=|first=|date=November 23, 1963|work=The Atlanta Constitution|access-date=}}</ref> On the other hand, Ambassador Lodge, Nixon's running mate, ran a lethargic campaign and made several mistakes that hurt Nixon. Among them was a pledge\u2014not approved by Nixon\u2014that as president, Nixon would name a black person to his cabinet.

Nixon was in Los Angeles while Kennedy was in New York. The men appear to be in the same room, thanks to identical sets. Both candidates had monitors in their respective studios containing the feed from the opposite studio so they could respond to questions.

Nixon also criticized Kennedy for stating that [[Quemoy]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], two small islands off the coast of Communist China that were held by Nationalist Chinese forces based in Taiwan, were outside the treaty of protection the United States had signed with the Nationalist Chinese.

That is, Nixon lost 28% ({{sfrac|17|61}}) of the Eisenhower voters, while Kennedy lost only 15% of the Stevenson voters.

More to the point, Illinois was the site of the most extensive challenge process, which fell short despite repeated efforts spearheaded by Cook County state's attorney, Benjamin Adamowski, a Republican, who also lost his re-election bid. Despite demonstrating net errors favoring both Nixon and Adamowski (some precincts\u201440% in Nixon's case\u2014showed errors favoring them, a factor suggesting error, rather than fraud), the totals found fell short of reversing the results for either candidate.

Instead of having the voters choose from slates of electors, the Alabama ballot had voters choose the [[US Presidential Electors|electors]] individually. Traditionally, in such a situation, a given candidate is assigned the popular vote of the elector who received the most votes. For instance, candidates pledged to Nixon received anywhere from 230,951 votes (for George Witcher) to 237,981 votes (for Cecil Durham); Nixon is therefore assigned 237,981 popular votes from Alabama.\n\nThe situation was more complicated on the Democratic side. The statewide Democratic primary had chosen eleven candidates for the Electoral College, five of whom were pledged to vote for Kennedy, and six of whom were free to vote for anyone they chose. All of these candidates won in the general election, and all six unpledged electors voted against Kennedy. The actual number of popular votes received by Kennedy is therefore difficult to allocate. Traditionally, Kennedy is assigned either 318,303 votes (the votes won by the most popular Kennedy elector) or 324,050 votes (the votes won by the most popular unpledged Democratic elector); the results table below is based on Kennedy winning 318,303 votes in Alabama.<ref name=\"trende\">{{cite news| title = Did JFK Lose the Popular Vote?| publisher = RealClearPolitics| date = October 22, 2012| url = http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/10/19/did_jfk_lose_the_popular_vote_115833.html| accessdate = October 23, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=====Georgia=====\nThe actual number of popular votes received by Kennedy and Nixon in Georgia is also difficult to determine because voters voted for 12 separate electors.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Novotny|first1=Patrick|title=John F.

However, the Republican and Democratic electors receiving the highest number of votes were [[outliers]] from the other 11 electors from their party. The average vote totals for the 12 electors were 455,629 votes for the Democratic electors and 273,110 votes for the Republican electors.

There was a call from segregationists for electoral votes to be withheld or to be cast for Virginia senator [[Harry F. Byrd]], a segregationist Democrat, as an independent candidate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Novotny|first=Patrick|date=Fall 2004|title=John F.

Alabama put up a mixed slate of five loyal electors and six unpledged electors. Mississippi put up two distinct slates, one of loyalists and one of unpledged electors. Louisiana also put up two distinct slates, although the unpledged slate did not receive the \"Democratic\" label. Georgia freed its Democratic electors from pledges to vote for Kennedy. Governor [[Ernest Vandiver]] supported the unpledged electoral votes. Former governor Ellis Arnall did not support the unpledged electoral votes. Arnall called Vandiver's stand \"utterly disgraceful.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Novotny|first=Patrick|date=Fall 2004|title=John F.

Because electors pledged to Kennedy had won a clear majority of the Electoral College, the unpledged electors could not influence the results. Nonetheless, they refused to vote for Kennedy. Instead, they voted for Byrd, even though he was not an announced candidate and did not seek their votes. In addition, Byrd received one electoral vote from a faithless Oklahoma elector for a total of 15 electoral votes. The faithless Oklahoma elector voted for [[Barry Goldwater]] as vice president; the other 14 voted for [[Strom Thurmond]] as vice president.\n\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name= [[John F.

Bush]] in 2000 and 2004, and [[Donald Trump]] in 2016, won the White House despite losing California.\n* This was the first election that Arizona participated in which it did not back the winning candidate.\n* Kennedy was the first Democrat to win the presidency without carrying Arizona, Florida, Oklahoma and Virginia, the last to win without Ohio and Wisconsin, and the first to win without Tennessee and Kentucky since 1852.\n* Kennedy is the last candidate from either party elected without carrying Ohio, and only [[Bill Clinton]] in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] has won without Florida since.\n* Since [[1840 United States presidential election|1840]], this is the second and most recent presidential election in which [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]] have had a different popular vote victor. (Mississippi was also unable to vote in [[1868 United States presidential election|1868]] due to [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]). However, the majority of Alabama's electoral votes went to [[Harry F. Byrd]] instead of John F. Kennedy.

In both instances, the president-elect was the younger of the two and also the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|junior senator]] from his state.\n* Kennedy was both the last Northern Democrat and sitting United States senator to win either the presidency or popular vote until the election of Barack Obama in 2008.\n* This was the first presidential election since [[1860 United States presidential election|1860]] that the incumbent vice president was a presidential nominee.\n* Barry Goldwater was the only person to come in fourth for either president or vice president in the electoral college during the 20th century, and the first since 1872.\n* As of the 2016 presidential election, this is the last time that Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee did not all vote for the same candidate.\n* This was the only presidential election where both major candidates were less than fifty years of age.\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of the United States (1945\u20131964)]]\n* [[Inauguration of John F.

It was held on Tuesday, November 8, 1960. In a closely contested election, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[John F. Kennedy]] defeated incumbent [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Richard Nixon]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nominee. This was the first election in which fifty states participated and the last in which the [[District of Columbia]] did not. It was also the first election in which an incumbent president was ineligible to run for a third term because of the term limits established by the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment]]. It is also the last election where the losing candidate won [[Ohio]].\n\nNixon faced little opposition in the Republican race to succeed popular incumbent [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Kennedy, a junior [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[Massachusetts]], established himself as the Democratic front-runner with his strong performance in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1960|1960 Democratic primaries]], including a key victory in [[West Virginia]] over [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Hubert Humphrey]]. He defeated Senate Majority Leader [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on the first presidential ballot of the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]], and asked Johnson to serve as his running mate. The issue of the [[Cold War]] dominated the election, as tensions were high between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nKennedy won a 303 to 219 [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] victory and is generally considered to have won the national popular vote by 112,827, a margin of 0.17 percent, though some argue that Nixon should be credited with the popular vote victory,<ref>https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/10/19/did_jfk_lose_the_popular_vote_115833.html</ref> as the issue of the popular vote was complicated by the presence of several [[unpledged elector]]s in the [[Deep South]]. Fourteen unpledged electors from [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]] cast their vote for Senator [[Harry F. Byrd]], as did a [[faithless elector]] from [[Oklahoma]]. The 1960 presidential election was the closest election since [[1916 United States presidential election|1916]], and this closeness can be explained by a number of factors.<ref>Rorabaugh (2009)</ref> Kennedy benefited from the [[Recession of 1958|economic recession of 1957\u201358]], which hurt the standing of the [[incumbent]] Republican Party, and he had the advantage of 17 million more registered Democrats than Republicans.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ann Mari |last=May |title=President Eisenhower, Economic Policy, and the 1960 Presidential Election |journal=[[Journal of Economic History]] |volume=50 |issue=2 |year=1990 |pages=417\u2013427 |jstor=2123282 |doi=10.1017/s0022050700036536|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1023&context=cbafacpub }}</ref> Furthermore, the new votes that Kennedy, the first [[Roman Catholic]] president, gained among Catholics almost neutralized the new votes Nixon gained among [[Protestantism in the United States|Protestants]].<ref>Casey (2009)</ref> Kennedy's campaigning skills decisively outmatched Nixon's, who wasted time and resources campaigning in all fifty states while Kennedy focused on campaigning in populous [[swing states]]. Nixon's emphasis on his experience carried little weight for most voters. Kennedy used his large, well-funded campaign organization to win the nomination, secure endorsements, and, with the aid of the [[Political boss|big-city bosses]], get out the vote in the big cities.<ref>The Making Of The President documentary</ref> Kennedy relied on Johnson to hold the South, and used television effectively. \n\nOn November 22, 1963, Kennedy was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]] and was succeeded by [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]]. Nixon would later successfully seek the presidency in [[1968 United States presidential election|1968]].\n\n==Nominations==\n===Democratic Party===\n{{main|1960 Democratic Party presidential primaries}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" colspan=\"30\"|<big>'''Democratic Party Ticket, 1960'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:200px;\"|{{colored link|white|John F.

Several other candidates sought support in their home state or region as \"[[favorite son]]\" candidates without any realistic chance of winning the nomination. Symington, Stevenson, and Johnson all declined to campaign in the presidential primaries. While this reduced their potential delegate count going into the Democratic National Convention, each of these three candidates hoped that the other leading contenders would stumble in the primaries, thus causing the convention's delegates to choose him as a \"compromise\" candidate acceptable to all factions of the party.\n\nKennedy was initially dogged by suggestions from some [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] elders (such as former [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Harry S. Truman]], who was supporting Symington) that he was too youthful and inexperienced to be president; these critics suggested that he should agree to be the [[running mate]] for another Democrat. Realizing that this was a strategy touted by his opponents to keep the public from taking him seriously, Kennedy stated frankly, \"I'm not running for vice president, I'm running for president.\"<ref>[[Jeff Zeleny|Zeleny, Jeff]]; Bosman, Julie (March 11, 2008).

Kennedy's [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] religion was an issue. Kennedy first challenged Minnesota Senator Hubert Humphrey in the Wisconsin primary and defeated him. Kennedy's attractive sisters, brothers, and wife Jacqueline combed the state looking for votes, leading Humphrey to complain that he \"felt like an independent merchant competing against a chain store.\"<ref>Humphrey, Hubert H.

Even though Stevenson had twice been the Democratic Party's presidential candidate and retained a loyal following of liberals, his two landslide defeats to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Dwight Eisenhower|Dwight D. Eisenhower]] led most party leaders and delegates to search for a \"fresh face\" who could win a national election. Following the primaries, Kennedy traveled around the nation speaking to state delegations and their leaders. As the Democratic Convention opened, Kennedy was far in the lead, but was still seen as being just short of the delegate total he needed to win.\n\n====Democratic convention====\nThe [[1960 Democratic National Convention]] was held in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]]. In the week before the convention opened, Kennedy received two new challengers when Lyndon B. Johnson, the powerful [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]] from Texas, and Adlai Stevenson, the party's nominee in 1952 and 1956, officially announced their candidacies (they had both privately been working for the nomination for some time). However, neither Johnson nor Stevenson was a match for the talented and highly efficient Kennedy campaign team led by [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. Johnson challenged Kennedy to a televised debate before a joint meeting of the Texas and Massachusetts delegations, to which Kennedy accepted. Most observers believed that Kennedy won the debate, and Johnson was unable to expand his delegate support beyond the South. Stevenson's failure to launch his candidacy publicly until the week of the convention meant that many liberal delegates who might have supported him were already pledged to Kennedy, and Stevenson\u2014despite the energetic support of former First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]\u2014could not break their allegiance. Kennedy won the nomination on the first ballot.\n\nThen, in a move that surprised many, Kennedy asked Johnson to be his running mate. He realized that he could not be elected without the support of traditional [[Southern Democrats]], most of whom had backed Johnson. He offered Johnson the vice presidential nomination at the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel|Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel]] at 10:15&nbsp;a.m. on July 14, 1960, the morning after being nominated for president.<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121\u2013135.

[[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]], and [[Seymour Hersh]] quoted Robert Kennedy's version of events, writing that John Kennedy \"would have preferred [[Stuart Symington]] as his [[running-mate]]\" and that Johnson teamed with [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Sam Rayburn]] to \"pressure Kennedy to offer the nomination\". Hersh goes on to present an alternative version of events; he writes that Kennedy was essentially blackmailed into offering the vice presidency to Johnson. The same story was originally presented by [[Anthony Summers]] in his biography of FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]]. [[Evelyn Lincoln]], Kennedy's personal secretary, told Summers in an interview that she was convinced in mid-1960 that J. Edgar Hoover and Johnson had conspired. Hoover was known to keep detailed files on the personal lives of many political figures and Kennedy was no exception. Hoover obtained information about Jack's womanizing prior to the election from at least two different sources. In January 1942, while Jack was serving in the [[United States Navy]], FBI surveillance records confirmed that he was having an affair with a woman named [[Inga Arvad]]; then, in 1958, a couple named Leonard and Florence Kater found out that their tenant, [[Pamela Turnure]], a secretary in Kennedy's Senate office, had been having an affair with the soon-to-be president. The Katers rigged up a tape recorder to pick up the sounds of the couple's lovemaking and snapped a picture of Kennedy himself. The Katers sent this information to the newspapers and one company - Stearn Publications - passed it along to Hoover. Soon after, \"he quietly obtained a copy of the compromising sex tapes and offered them to Lyndon Johnson as campaign ammunition.\" Lincoln said that Johnson \"had been using all the information Hoover could find on Kennedy - during the campaign, even before the Convention. And Hoover was in on the pressure on Kennedy at the Convention.\" A few days after the offer was made, [[Pierre Salinger]], the campaign's press secretary, had asked Jack Kennedy whether he really expected Johnson to accept the offer or if he was merely making a polite gesture. Kennedy responded cryptically: \"The whole story will never be known. And it's just as well that it won't be.\" \"The only people who were involved in the discussions were Jack and myself,\" said Robert Kennedy. \"We both promised each other that we'd never tell what happened.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J.

Hersh]], ''The Dark Side of Camelot'', 1997, Chapter 12</ref>\n\nBiographers [[Robert Caro]] and [[W. Marvin Watson]] offer a different perspective; they write that the Kennedy campaign was desperate to win what was forecast to be a very close race against [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]]. Johnson was needed on the ticket to help carry votes from Texas and the [[Southern United States]]. Caro's research showed that on July 14, Kennedy started the process while Johnson was still asleep. At 6:30&nbsp;a.m., Kennedy asked his brother to prepare an estimate of upcoming electoral votes, \"including Texas.\"<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121\u2013135. JFK offers vice presidency to LBJ\"/> Robert Kennedy called [[Pierre Salinger]] and [[Kenneth O'Donnell]] to assist him. Realizing the ramifications of counting Texas votes as their own, Salinger asked him whether he was considering a Kennedy-Johnson ticket, and Robert replied, \"yes\".<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121\u2013135. JFK offers vice presidency to LBJ\"/> Between 9 and 10 a.m., John Kennedy called Pennsylvania governor [[David L. Lawrence]], a Johnson backer, to request that Lawrence nominate Johnson for vice president if Johnson were to accept the role and then went to Johnson's suite to discuss a mutual ticket at 10:15&nbsp;a.m. John Kennedy then returned to his suite to announce the Kennedy-Johnson ticket to his closest supporters and Northern political bosses. He accepted the congratulations of [[List of governors of Ohio|Ohio Governor]] [[Michael DiSalle]], [[List of governors of Connecticut|Connecticut Governor]] [[Abraham A. Ribicoff]], [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago mayor]] [[Richard J. Daley]], and [[Mayor of New York City|New York City mayor]] [[Robert F. Wagner Jr.]]. Lawrence said that \"Johnson has the strength where you need it most\"; he then left to begin writing the nomination speech.<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121\u2013135. JFK offers vice presidency to LBJ\"/> O'Donnell remembers being angry at what he considered a betrayal by John Kennedy, who had previously cast Johnson as anti-labor and anti-liberal. Afterward, Robert Kennedy visited with labor leaders who were extremely unhappy with the choice of Johnson and after seeing the depth of labor opposition to Johnson, he ran messages between the hotel suites of his brother and Johnson, apparently trying to undermine the proposed ticket without John Kennedy's authorization and to get Johnson to agree to be the Democratic Party chairman rather than vice president. Johnson refused to accept a change in plans unless it came directly from John Kennedy. Despite his brother's interference, John Kennedy was firm that Johnson was who he wanted as running mate and met with staffers such as [[Larry O'Brien]], his national campaign manager, to say Johnson was to be vice president. O'Brien recalled later that John Kennedy's words were wholly unexpected, but that after a brief consideration of the electoral vote situation, he thought \"it was a stroke of genius\".<ref name=\"Caro 2012, pp. 121\u2013135.

However, Rockefeller announced that he would not be a candidate for president after a national tour revealed that the great majority of Republicans favored Nixon.<ref>(White, pp. 91\u201392)</ref>\n\nAfter Rockefeller's withdrawal, Nixon faced no significant opposition for the Republican nomination. At the [[1960 Republican National Convention]] in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], Nixon was the overwhelming choice of the delegates, with conservative Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] from Arizona receiving 10 votes from conservative delegates. In earning the nomination, Nixon became the first sitting vice president to run for president since [[John C. Breckinridge]] exactly a century prior. Nixon then chose former Massachusetts Senator and [[United Nations]] Ambassador [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], as his vice presidential running mate. Nixon chose Lodge because his foreign-policy credentials fit into Nixon's strategy to campaign more on foreign policy than domestic policy, which he believed favored the Democrats. Nixon had previously sought Rockefeller as his running mate, but the governor had no ambitions to be vice president. However, he later served as [[Gerald Ford]]'s vice president from 1974 to 1977.<ref>(White, pp. 242\u2013243)</ref>\n\n==General election==\n\n===Campaign promises===\n[[File:Dwight David Eisenhower, photo portrait by Bachrach, 1952.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the incumbent president in 1960, whose term expired on January 20, 1961]]\nDuring the campaign, Kennedy charged that under Eisenhower and the Republicans the nation had fallen behind the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]], both militarily and economically, and that as president he would \"get America moving again.\" The Eisenhower administration had established NASA in 1958, but Kennedy believed that the Republican Party had ignored the need to catch up to the Soviet Union in the Space Race. He promised that the new Democratic administration would fully appreciate the importance of space accomplishments for the national security and international prestige of the United States. Nixon responded that, if elected, he would continue the \"peace and prosperity\" that Eisenhower had brought the nation in the 1950s.  Nixon also argued that with the nation engaged in the Cold War with the Soviets, that Kennedy was too young and inexperienced to be trusted with the presidency. Had Nixon been elected, at 48 years, 11 days, he would have been [[List of Presidents of the United States by age|the fourth-youngest]] president at the date of inauguration. Kennedy, by contrast, was 43 years, 236 days, on the date of his inauguration; the second-youngest man to begin a Presidency (at 42 [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who [[First inauguration of Theodore Roosevelt|assumed the Presidency]] upon the [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassination of United States President William McKinley]] 60 years previously, was the youngest).\n\nDuring Kennedy's campaign he relied on his youth and promised to bring about change. Kennedy had a slogan emphasizing his youth reading, \"who's seasoned through and through/but not so dog-gone seasoned that he won't try something new.\" He was also endorsed by celebrities such as [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Harry Belafonte]]. Nixon relied on his experience in politics. He emphasized to the American voters that he was more qualified to hold the office of president. He wanted voters to know that he had the abilities to take on Communist threats.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Byung Joon|date=September 2016|title=Attacking the Airwaves: How Television Changed the American Presidential Campaign|url=|journal=The New England Journal of History|volume=73|pages=1\u201327}}</ref>\n\n===Campaign events===\n[[File:John F.

However, Nixon was plagued by bad luck throughout the fall campaign. In August, President Eisenhower, who had long been ambivalent about Nixon, held a televised press conference in which a reporter, Charles Mohr of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', mentioned Nixon's claims that he had been a valuable administration insider and adviser. Mohr asked Eisenhower if he could give an example of a major idea of Nixon's that he had heeded. Eisenhower responded with the flip comment, \"If you give me a week, I might think of one.\"<ref>Ambrose, Stephen E. (1991). ''Eisenhower: Soldier and President'', p. 525. Simon and Schuster. {{ISBN|0-671-74758-4}}.</ref> Although both Eisenhower and Nixon later claimed that he was merely joking with the reporter, the remark hurt Nixon, as it undercut his claims of having greater decision-making experience than Kennedy. The remark proved so damaging to Nixon that the Democrats turned Eisenhower's statement into a television commercial.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nixon's Experience?

This pledge backfired when, in August, Nixon injured his knee on a car door while campaigning in [[North Carolina]]. The knee became infected and Nixon had to cease campaigning for two weeks while the infection was treated with [[Antibacterial|antibiotics]]. When he left [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed Hospital]], Nixon refused to abandon his pledge to visit every state; he thus wound up wasting valuable time visiting states that he had no chance of winning, or that had few electoral votes and would be of little help at the election, or states that he would almost certainly win regardless. For example, in his effort to visit all 50 states, Nixon spent the vital weekend before the election campaigning in Alaska, which had only three electoral votes, while Kennedy campaigned in more populous states, such as New Jersey, Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.\n\nNixon visited Atlanta, Georgia on August 26 and acquired a very large turnout to his event. Nixon rode through a parade in Atlanta and was greeted by 150,000 people.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=The Nixon-Kennedy Campaigns In Georgia|last=Fleming|first=K|date=November 1960|work=The Atlanta-Journal and Constitution|access-date=}}</ref> Nixon mentioned in his speech in Atlanta, \"in the last quarter of a century there hasn't been a Democratic candidate for President that has bothered to campaign in the State of Georgia.\"<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=25759|title=John F.

Kennedy would change that statistic and visit some surprising states, including Georgia. Senator Kennedy visited the cities of Columbus, Warm Springs, and Lagrange on his campaign trail in Georgia.

Kennedy spoke at a rehabilitation facility in Warm Springs. Warm Springs was near and dear to Kennedy's heart due to the effects the facility had on [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Roosevelt spent time at the rehabilitation facility and died there in 1945.<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\"/>\n\nIn Warm Springs, Kennedy spoke to supporters at the facility and mentioned Franklin D. Roosevelt in his speech.

He wanted a medical program set up for retirement and federal funding for the construction of medical schools and hospitals. He also planned for the government to loan students money to attend medical school and provide grants to renovate old hospitals. He called for more money to be spent on medical research and finally, expand effort for rehabilitation and come up with new ways to assist those in need.<ref name=\"presidency.ucsb.edu\" /> Many Republicans disapproved Kennedy's plans and described them as an \"appeal to socialism\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Kennedy's Plans Altered: Crowd of 50,000 Is Seen|last=Gaines|first=Marion|date=October 6, 1960|work=The Atlanta-Journal Constitution|access-date=}}</ref> People around Warm Springs were supportive of Kennedy.

Nixon insisted on campaigning until just a few hours before the first debate started. He had not completely recovered from his stay in hospital and thus looked pale, sickly, underweight, and tired.<ref name=\"Nixon, p. 270\">(Nixon, p. 270)</ref> His eyes moved across the room during the debate, and at various moments sweat was visible on his face. He also refused make-up for the first debate, and as a result his facial stubble showed prominently on the black-and-white TV screens at the time. Furthermore, the debate set appeared darker once the paint dried up, causing Nixon's suit color to blend in with the background which reduced his stature.<ref name=\"Nixon, p. 270\"/> Nixon's poor appearance on television in the first debate is reflected by the fact that his mother called him immediately following the debate to ask if he was sick.<ref>(Nixon, p. 271)</ref>{{efn|name=\"addisons\"|His tanned appearance was likely darkening ([[hyperpigmentation]]) of the skin due to [[Addison's disease#Notable cases|Addison's disease]].

Contrary to popular belief, the Sindlinger evidence suggests not that Kennedy won on television but that the candidates tied on television while Nixon won on radio.

Moreover, since 87% of American households had a television in 1960 [and that the] fraction of Americans lacking access to television in 1960 was concentrated in rural areas and particularly in southern and western states, places that were unlikely to hold significant proportions of Catholic voters.<ref name=schlinder>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.las.illinois.edu/salthaus/Publications/media%20and%20politics%20encyclopedia_kennedy-nixon%20debates.pdf|author=Scott L.

This debate was a monumental step for television. For the first time ever, split-screen technology was used to bring two people from opposite sides of the country together so they were able to converse in real time. Nixon was in Los Angeles while Kennedy was in New York. The men appear to be in the same room, thanks to identical sets. Both candidates had monitors in their respective studios containing the feed from the opposite studio so they could respond to questions. Bill Shadel moderated the debate from a third television studio in Chicago. The main topic of this debate was whether military force should be used to prevent [[Kinmen|Quemoy]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], two island archipelagos off the Chinese coast, from falling under Communist control.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=october-13-1960-debate-transcript|title=October 13, 1960 Debate Transcript|publisher=Debates.org |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/EventDetail.html?EventID=12|title=Third Kennedy-Nixon Debate|publisher=Debates.org |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Campaign issues===\nA key concern in Kennedy's campaign was the widespread skepticism among Protestants about his [[20th century history of the Catholic Church in the United States|Roman Catholic]] religion.

Nixon refused to take further action, but Kennedy placed calls to local political authorities to get King released from jail, and he also called King's father and wife. As a result, King's father endorsed Kennedy, and he received much favorable publicity in the black community.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} A letter to the Governor of Georgia regarding Martin Luther King Jr.'s arrest also helped Kennedy garner many African American votes. John F.

The same study conducted found that white voters were less influenced on the topic of civil rights than black voters in 1960. The Republican national chairman at the time, [[Thruston Ballard Morton]], regarded the African-American vote as the single most crucial factor.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Middleton|first=Russell|date=March 1962|title=The Civil Rights Issue And Presidential Voting Among Southern Negroes And Whites|url=|journal=Social Forces|volume=40|issue=3|pages=209\u2013215|doi=10.2307/2573630|jstor=2573630}}</ref>\n\nThe issue that dominated the election was the rising Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"jfk1960\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK/JFK-in-History/Campaign-of-1960.aspx|title=Campaign of 1960 - John F.

Some historians criticize Nixon for not taking greater advantage of Eisenhower's popularity (which was around 60\u201365% throughout 1960 and on election day) and for not discussing the prosperous economy of the Eisenhower presidency more often in his campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-08/uoc--int081409.php |title=It's not the economy, stupid \u2013 it's what you do with it |publisher=Eurekalert.org |date=August 14, 2009 |access-date=June 24, 2012}}</ref> As the campaign moved into the final two weeks, the polls and most political pundits predicted a Kennedy victory. However, President Eisenhower, who had largely sat out the campaign, made a vigorous campaign tour for Nixon over the last 10 days before the election. Eisenhower's support gave Nixon a badly needed boost. Nixon also criticized Kennedy for stating that [[Quemoy]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], two small islands off the coast of Communist China that were held by Nationalist Chinese forces based in Taiwan, were outside the treaty of protection the United States had signed with the Nationalist Chinese. Nixon claimed the islands were included in the treaty and accused Kennedy of showing weakness towards Communist aggression.<ref>(Ambrose, pp. 579\u2013580)</ref> Aided by the Quemoy and Matsu issue, and by Eisenhower's support, Nixon began to gain momentum and by election day the polls indicated a virtual tie.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Results===\n[[Image:PresidentialCounty1960Colorbrewer.gif|thumb|right|400px|Results by county explicitly indicating the percentage for the winning candidate.

Nixon watched the election returns from his suite at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in Los Angeles, while Kennedy watched them at the [[Kennedy Compound]] in [[Hyannis Port, Massachusetts]]. As the early returns poured in from large Northeastern and Midwestern cities, such as [[Boston]], [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Cleveland]], [[Detroit]], and [[Chicago]], Kennedy opened a large lead in the popular and electoral votes, and appeared headed for victory. However, as later returns came in from [[rural]] and [[suburban]] areas in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], the Rocky Mountain states and the Pacific Coast states, Nixon began to steadily close the gap on Kennedy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/business/media/no-concession-no-sleep-glued-to-the-tv-on-election-night-1960.html|title=No Concession, No Sleep: Glued to the TV on Election Night 1960|last=Beschloss|first=Michael|date=2016-10-29|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-01-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nBefore midnight, ''[[The New York Times]]'' had gone to press with the headline \"Kennedy Elected President\".

So close was the popular vote that a shift of 18,858 votes in Illinois and Missouri, both won by Kennedy by less than 1%, would have left both Kennedy and Nixon short of the 269 electoral votes required to win, thus forcing a contingent election in the House of Representatives.\n\nIn the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], Kennedy's victory was larger, as he took 303 electoral votes to Nixon's 219.

That is, Nixon lost 28% ({{sfrac|17|61}}) of the Eisenhower voters, while Kennedy lost only 15% of the Stevenson voters.

Kennedy's defenders, such as his speechwriter and special assistant [[Arthur M.

For example, [[Fannin County, Texas|Fannin County]] had only 4,895 registered voters, yet 6,138 votes were cast in that county, three-quarters for Kennedy.<ref name=\"wash post\"/> In an [[Angelina County, Texas|Angelina County]] precinct, Kennedy received 187 votes to Nixon's 24, though there were only a total of 86 registered voters in the precinct.<ref name=\"wash post\"/>  When Republicans demanded a statewide recount, they learned that the state Board of Elections, whose members were all Democrats, had already \"certified\" Kennedy as the official winner in Texas.<ref name=\"wash post\"/> This analysis, though, is flawed as the fact was registered voter figures only measured individuals who had paid the [[Poll taxes in the United States|poll tax]], and that certain groups were exempt from having to pay that tax.<ref>''The Houston Chronicle'', April 13, 2012, [https://www.chron.com/opinion/outlook/article/Vote-ID-law-is-a-waste-of-money-3481335.php \"Vote ID law is a waste of money\"] by Terri Burke</ref>\n\nIn Illinois, Schlesinger and others have pointed out that, even if Nixon had carried Illinois, the state alone would not have given him the victory, as Kennedy would still have won 276 electoral votes to Nixon's 246 (with 269 needed to win). More to the point, Illinois was the site of the most extensive challenge process, which fell short despite repeated efforts spearheaded by Cook County state's attorney, Benjamin Adamowski, a Republican, who also lost his re-election bid. Despite demonstrating net errors favoring both Nixon and Adamowski (some precincts\u201440% in Nixon's case\u2014showed errors favoring them, a factor suggesting error, rather than fraud), the totals found fell short of reversing the results for either candidate. While a Daley-connected circuit judge, Thomas Kluczynski (who would later be appointed a federal judge by Kennedy, at Daley's recommendation), threw out a federal lawsuit \"filed to contend\" the voting totals,<ref name=\"wash post\"/> the Republican-dominated State Board of Elections unanimously rejected the challenge to the results. Furthermore, there were signs of possible irregularities in downstate areas controlled by Republicans, which Democrats never seriously pressed, since the Republican challenges went nowhere.<ref>''Slate'', October 16, 2000, [http://www.slate.com/id/91350/ \"Was Nixon Robbed?

Instead of having the voters choose from slates of electors, the Alabama ballot had voters choose the [[US Presidential Electors|electors]] individually. Traditionally, in such a situation, a given candidate is assigned the popular vote of the elector who received the most votes. For instance, candidates pledged to Nixon received anywhere from 230,951 votes (for George Witcher) to 237,981 votes (for Cecil Durham); Nixon is therefore assigned 237,981 popular votes from Alabama.\n\nThe situation was more complicated on the Democratic side. The statewide Democratic primary had chosen eleven candidates for the Electoral College, five of whom were pledged to vote for Kennedy, and six of whom were free to vote for anyone they chose. All of these candidates won in the general election, and all six unpledged electors voted against Kennedy. The actual number of popular votes received by Kennedy is therefore difficult to allocate. Traditionally, Kennedy is assigned either 318,303 votes (the votes won by the most popular Kennedy elector) or 324,050 votes (the votes won by the most popular unpledged Democratic elector); the results table below is based on Kennedy winning 318,303 votes in Alabama.<ref name=\"trende\">{{cite news| title = Did JFK Lose the Popular Vote?| publisher = RealClearPolitics| date = October 22, 2012| url = http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/10/19/did_jfk_lose_the_popular_vote_115833.html| accessdate = October 23, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=====Georgia=====\nThe actual number of popular votes received by Kennedy and Nixon in Georgia is also difficult to determine because voters voted for 12 separate electors.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Novotny|first1=Patrick|title=John F.

The average vote totals for the 12 electors were 455,629 votes for the Democratic electors and 273,110 votes for the Republican electors.

Byrd]], a segregationist Democrat, as an independent candidate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Novotny|first=Patrick|date=Fall 2004|title=John F.

Alabama put up a mixed slate of five loyal electors and six unpledged electors. Mississippi put up two distinct slates, one of loyalists and one of unpledged electors. Louisiana also put up two distinct slates, although the unpledged slate did not receive the \"Democratic\" label. Georgia freed its Democratic electors from pledges to vote for Kennedy. Governor [[Ernest Vandiver]] supported the unpledged electoral votes. Former governor Ellis Arnall did not support the unpledged electoral votes. Arnall called Vandiver's stand \"utterly disgraceful.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Novotny|first=Patrick|date=Fall 2004|title=John F.

Because electors pledged to Kennedy had won a clear majority of the Electoral College, the unpledged electors could not influence the results. Nonetheless, they refused to vote for Kennedy. Instead, they voted for Byrd, even though he was not an announced candidate and did not seek their votes. In addition, Byrd received one electoral vote from a faithless Oklahoma elector for a total of 15 electoral votes. The faithless Oklahoma elector voted for [[Barry Goldwater]] as vice president; the other 14 voted for [[Strom Thurmond]] as vice president.\n\n{{start U.S. presidential ticket box}}\n{{U.S. presidential ticket box row| name= [[John F.

Garfield]] in 1880 to not carry California; since then, [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1976, [[George W. Bush]] in 2000 and 2004, and [[Donald Trump]] in 2016, won the White House despite losing California.\n* This was the first election that Arizona participated in which it did not back the winning candidate.\n* Kennedy was the first Democrat to win the presidency without carrying Arizona, Florida, Oklahoma and Virginia, the last to win without Ohio and Wisconsin, and the first to win without Tennessee and Kentucky since 1852.\n* Kennedy is the last candidate from either party elected without carrying Ohio, and only [[Bill Clinton]] in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]] has won without Florida since.\n* Since [[1840 United States presidential election|1840]], this is the second and most recent presidential election in which [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]] have had a different popular vote victor. (Mississippi was also unable to vote in [[1868 United States presidential election|1868]] due to [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]). However, the majority of Alabama's electoral votes went to [[Harry F. Byrd]] instead of John F. Kennedy. All of Mississippi's electoral votes went to Byrd.\n* This election marked the first time since [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]] that the Democratic candidate's share of the popular vote went up as opposed to down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ropercenter.cornell.edu/polls/us-elections/popular-vote/|title=Popular Votes 1940-2012 - Roper Center|publisher=}}</ref>\n* This was the first election where both major party candidates were born in the 20th century.\n* It marked the first election of two incumbent U.S. senators as president and vice president, a phenomenon that was repeated by [[Barack Obama]] and [[Joe Biden]] in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]]. In both instances, the President-elect was the younger of the two and also the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|junior senator]] from his state.\n* Kennedy was both the last Northern Democrat and sitting United States senator to win either the presidency or popular vote until the election of Barack Obama in 2008.\n* This was the first presidential election since [[1860 United States presidential election|1860]] that the incumbent Vice President was a presidential nominee.\n* Barry Goldwater was the only person to come in fourth for either President or vice president in the electoral college during the 20th century, and the first since 1872.\n* As of the 2016 Presidential Election this is the last time that Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee did not all vote for the same candidate.\n* This was the only presidential election where both major candidates were less than fifty years of age.\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of the United States (1945\u20131964)]]\n* [[Inauguration of John F.
