The molars are smaller than those of ''H. floresiensis''. Like other recent ''Homo'' and modern humans, the molars decrease in size towards the back of the mouth, and the [[tooth enamel|enamel]]-[[dentin]] juncture lacks well defined wavy crenulations. The enamel-dentine juncture is most similar to that of Asian ''H. erectus''. The premolars are oddly large compared to the molars, with more similar proportions to ''[[Paranthropus]]'' than any other ''Homo'', though ''H. luzonensis'' postcanine teeth differ greatly from those of ''Paranthropus'' in size and shape. ''H. luzonensis'' premolars share many characteristics with those of ''Australopithecus'', ''Paranthropus'', and early ''Homo''.<ref name=\"D\u00e9troit2019\"/>\n\nThe finger bones are long, narrow, and curved, which is seen in ''Australopithecus'', ''H. floresiensis'', and sometimes modern humans.

Unique to ''H. luzonensis'', the dorsal beak near the knuckle was strongly developed and angled towards the wrist rather than the finger. The foot bones are morphologically unique among ''Homo'', and are more or less indistinguishable from those of ''[[Australopithecus africanus|A. africanus]]'' and ''[[Australopithecus afarensis|A. afarensis]]''. ''Australopithecus'' limbs are generally interpreted as being adaptations for [[bipedalism]] and potentially [[suspensory behavior]] in the trees, but the fragmentary record of ''H. luzonensis'' limits extrapolation of locomotory behavior.<ref name=\"D\u00e9troit2019\"/>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Map of Sunda and Sahul 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The ancestors of ''H. luzonensis'' crossed the [[Huxley Line]] into the Philippines]]\n{{See also|List of extinct animals of the Philippines}}\nBecause Luzon has always been an island in the [[Quaternary]], the ancestors of ''H. luzonensis'' would have had to have made a substantial sea crossing to cross the [[Huxley Line]].<ref name=\"D\u00e9troit2019\"/>\n\nAbout 90% of the bone fragments from Callao Cave belong to the [[Philippine deer]], which suggests that deer carcasses were periodically brought into the cave.

Freight services continued after the passenger service ended.\n\nThe original operating company remains as [[Cornwall Electric]]. The company sold power from its [[hydroelectric]] assets on the [[St. Lawrence River]] since its formation, and today operates as a [[local distribution company]]. Although the main lines in the downtown area were lifted in the 1950s, a number of lines outside town remain in use as industrial spurs.\n\n==History==\n\nAn abortive early street railway attempt began in 1885 under the charter of the '''Cornwall Street Railway Company''', which was filed on 11 November 1885 and authorized by the town council a month later, on 14 December. This early street railway was equipped with steam-driven [[rolling stock]], but reportedly the rolling stock sat in the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yard for a number of years unused after arrival, and the street railway had minimal to no operations.<ref name=wyatt />\n\nJust over ten years later, a second attempt at a street railway began. On 28 December 1895, the Cornwall town council granted a second street railway charter. This charter was held by the '''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''' (CESR), which was incorporated in 1896. Initial passenger-only service began on 1 July 1896, marking the commonly-accepted start of Cornwall's street railway era.<ref name=TrainwebA /> Ridership grew quickly, but the company's financial situation was difficult, and freight service was introduced in 1899 in the hopes of generating more revenue. This resulted in a unique freight switching service which allowed freight cars to be easily transferred to and from the steam mainline and the electric street railway, reducing freight overhead costs.<ref name=TrainwebA />\n\nIn 1902, the company's bondholder, the Sun Life Assurance Company, foreclosed. This put Sun Life in the unique position of being an insurance company which owned a railway. Sun Life rechartered and relaunched the company as the '''Cornwall Street Railway, Light and Power Company, Limited''' (CSRL&P).<ref name=wyatt /> This management philosophy in the burgeoning electrical industry in Ontario became increasingly common in the lead-up to the founding of the [[Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario]], as companies sought to [[vertical integration|vertically integrate]] electrical power production, distribution, and consumption, especially in the form of electric railways and municipal lighting companies. This local consolidation was completed in 1905 with a merger with the purchase of the '''Stormont Electric Light and Power Company''', resulting in consolidation of the two companies and greater financial sustainability.<ref name=TrainwebA />\n\nStreet railways were often politically contentious, especially when managed by private companies, and around the time of the [[First World War]] through the 1920s there was a wave of street railway unionizations, strikes, and incidents of civil unrest such as the [[1914 Saint John street railway strike]] in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]]. The Cornwall street railway system was not immune and on 3 December 1919 the company was unionized under the [[Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway Employees of America]]. However, the company would continue to work to trim down its workforce and cut costs, switching from two-man to one-man crews in 1927 and 1930.<ref name=standard-freeholder2019-12-02 />\n\nThe last significant expansions to the system occurred in the 1930s. In 1931, tracks were installed on Cumberland Street, creating a southern loop along with Water, Pitt, and Second Streets. This was followed in 1934 with the installation of tracks up Cumberland Street to Seventh Street, then across to Pitt Street, completing a second loop.<ref name=standard-freeholder2019-12-02 /> In 1936, the street railway was involved in a civil disturbance, as a [[motorman (locomotive)|motorman]] attempted to bypass a [[picket line]] at the Cortaulds plant to move freight cars on the plant [[rail siding|siding]]. Eight strikers were arrested by the [[Ontario Provincial Police]].<ref name=cornwall-papers>{{cite web |title=Local Railway Items from Area Papers - Cornwall Street Railway |url=https://churcher.crcml.org/circle/Papers%20by%20Subdivision/Cornwall%20Street.pdf |publisher=Colin J. Churcher |page=2 |accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nLike with many electric street and interurban railways, the system's swan song occurred during the [[Second World War]], which stimulated freight and commuter traffic and reversed much of the industrial slump caused by the [[Great Depression]]. Industrial production had begun to gradually consolidate, and factories became larger and more suburban, forcing workers to commute to them. In Cornwall, the then-secret [[mustard gas]] plant on Wallrich Avenue led to the final extension of the system's lines. This would be some of the last passenger traffic on the system, as passenger service would be phased out shortly after the war.<ref name=standard-freeholder2019-12-02 />\n\nStreet railway service was interrupted repeatedly in 1947 by strikes. In August, streetcar operators engaged in a two-day strike for higher wages. This conflict eventually went to arbitration, and workers won a wage increase from one cent to six cents per hour in some departments. However, this was followed almost immediately by a second, eight-day strike in September, as the company had scaled wage increases to pay rather than applying a blanket increase, which the union claimed as overstepping its authority, and renewed its demand for a 12-cent increase. Ultimately, the strike was ended when the union, management, and [[Ontario Minister of Labour]] [[Charles Daley]] met in Toronto and scrapped the earlier arbitration decision, replacing it with a blanket retroactive 5-cent increase, plus a 3-cent increase going forward, and improvements to overtime pay.<ref name=cornwall-papers />\n\nIn 1949, the company made the decision to end streetcar service permanently and switch to [[trolleybus]] service.<ref name=standard-freeholder2019-12-02 /> This was a part of the general postwar wave of streetcar elimination in North America. Many systems had been poorly maintained during the 1930s and 1940s, as the war and the Great Depression starved them of funds and materials for repair, and many streetcar manufacturers closed or shifted to manufacturing other types of vehicles, making it difficult and expensive to purchase new streetcars, as opposed to cheaper, standardized bus models. Auto manufacturers had grown explosively during the Second World War due to government contracts for military vehicles, and public funds became more widely available for paved asphalt roads and highway construction.\n\nBy the early 1970s, Sun Life began to slowly divest itself of the company, and various aspects of its operations were sold off. Electrical distribution continued under Cornwall Electric, freight under CN Rail, and passenger transportation under the municipally-owned [[Cornwall Transit]]. In a contentious move, trolleybuses were replaced with diesel buses in 1971, and the historic depot at Pitt and Water Streets which had served the system since 1896 was demolished and replaced with the Cornwall Square mall.<ref name=standard-freeholder2019-12-02 /> This ended one of the last visible remnants of the streetcar service.\n\nRailway operations, however, did not end, and electric freight service continued until 1971, shortly after the company's freight operations were purchased by [[CN Rail]]. Electric freight service was replaced with diesel as part of a general wave of [[dieselization]] of the remaining electric freight railways in Ontario. Dieselization allowed companies to abandon the then-aging electric rolling stock, and to operate the same diesel trains on formerly-electric rail lines as on non-electric mainlines, simplifying freight operations. The last electric freight operation occurred on Saturday 9 October 1971, on what was a cold and rainy day.<ref name=TrainwebA /> However, by this point the remaining railway infrastructure had been reduced to a number of industrial spurs connecting to the CN mainline, with most of the original [[street running]] sections having been removed in the 1950s after the switch to trolleybuses for passenger service.\n\n==Routes==\n\nThe first two routes, in 1896, were a {{convert|1.5|mi|km|adj=on}} route on Pitt Street and a {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}} route on Montreal Street.<ref name=TrainwebA/>  In 1949, the last year of streetcar service, three routes in total were operated along Montreal Street, Pitt Street, and a belt line.<ref name=cornwallseawaynews2018-09-13/>\n\n==Rolling stock==\n\nNone of the early steam [[rolling stock]] is known to have survived.<ref name=wyatt /> Some later vehicles and pieces of equipment, however, have been preserved in various forms:\n* #11 (freight motor) is displayed at the [[Ohio Railway Museum]] under its original [[livery]] as [[Youngstown and Ohio River Railroad]] #7<ref name=TrainwebA />\n* #16 (freight motor) is displayed at the [[Halton County Radial Railway]] under its later livery as [[Lake Erie and Northern Railway]] #335<ref name=TrainwebA />\n* #17 (freight motor) is on permanent display in Cornwall<ref name=TrainwebA />\n* B-1 (snow sweeper) is in storage at the [[Canada Science and Technology Museum]]<ref name=TrainwebA />\n* #3152 (snow plow) built in 1925 by [[Canadian Car and Foundry]] is displayed at the [[Shore Line Trolley Museum]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://shorelinetrolley.org/collection/ |title=Collections |publisher=[[Shore Line Trolley Museum]] |access-date=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Cornwall, Ontario]]\n* [[Cornwall Electric]]\n* [[Cornwall Transit]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=standard-freeholder2019-12-02>\n{{cite news \n| url         = https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-history-of-transit-in-cornwall\n| title       = A history of transit in Cornwall\n| work        = [[Cornwall Standard-Freeholder]]\n| author      = Alan Hale\n| date        = 2 December 2019\n| accessdate  = 2 December 2019\n| quote       = The transit system was also vital to the effort during the Second World War.

However, the company would continue to work to trim down its workforce and cut costs, switching from two-man to one-man crews in 1927 and 1930.<ref name=standard-freeholder2019-12-02 />\n\nThe last significant expansions to the system occurred in the 1930s. In 1931, tracks were installed on Cumberland Street, creating a southern loop along with Water, Pitt, and Second Streets. This was followed in 1934 with the installation of tracks up Cumberland Street to Seventh Street, then across to Pitt Street, completing a second loop.<ref name=standard-freeholder2019-12-02 /> In 1936, the street railway was involved in a civil disturbance, as a [[motorman (locomotive)|motorman]] attempted to bypass a [[picket line]] at the Cortaulds plant to move freight cars on the plant [[rail siding|siding]]. Eight strikers were arrested by the [[Ontario Provincial Police]].<ref name=cornwall-papers>{{cite web |title=Local Railway Items from Area Papers - Cornwall Street Railway |url=https://churcher.crcml.org/circle/Papers%20by%20Subdivision/Cornwall%20Street.pdf |publisher=Colin J. Churcher |page=2 |accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\nLike with many electric street and interurban railways, the system's swan song occurred during the [[Second World War]], which stimulated freight and commuter traffic and reversed much of the industrial slump caused by the [[Great Depression]]. Industrial production had begun to gradually consolidate, and factories became larger and more suburban, forcing workers to commute to them. In Cornwall, the then-secret [[mustard gas]] plant on Wallrich Avenue led to the final extension of the system's lines. This would be some of the last passenger traffic on the system, as passenger service would be phased out shortly after the war.<ref name=standard-freeholder2019-12-02 />\n\nStreet railway service was interrupted repeatedly in 1947 by strikes. In August, streetcar operators engaged in a two-day strike for higher wages. This conflict eventually went to arbitration, and workers won a wage increase from one cent to six cents per hour in some departments. However, this was followed almost immediately by a second, eight-day strike in September, as the company had scaled wage increases to pay rather than applying a blanket increase, which the union claimed as overstepping its authority, and renewed its demand for a 12-cent increase. Ultimately, the strike was ended when the union, management, and [[Ontario Minister of Labour]] [[Charles Daley]] met in Toronto and scrapped the earlier arbitration decision, replacing it with a blanket retroactive 5-cent increase, plus a 3-cent increase going forward, and improvements to overtime pay.<ref name=cornwall-papers />\n\nIn 1949, the company made the decision to end streetcar service permanently and switch to [[trolleybus]] service.<ref name=standard-freeholder2019-12-02 /> This was a part of the general postwar wave of streetcar elimination in North America. Many systems had been poorly maintained during the 1930s and 1940s, as the war and the Great Depression starved them of funds and materials for repair, and many streetcar manufacturers closed or shifted to manufacturing other types of vehicles, making it difficult and expensive to purchase new streetcars, as opposed to cheaper, standardized bus models. Auto manufacturers had grown explosively during the Second World War due to government contracts for military vehicles, and public funds became more widely available for paved asphalt roads and highway construction.\n\nBy the early 1970s, Sun Life began to slowly divest itself of the company, and various aspects of its operations were sold off. Electrical distribution continued under Cornwall Electric, freight under CN Rail, and passenger transportation under the municipally-owned [[Cornwall Transit]]. In a contentious move, trolleybuses were replaced with diesel buses in 1971, and the historic depot at Pitt and Water Streets which had served the system since 1896 was demolished and replaced with the Cornwall Square mall.<ref name=standard-freeholder2019-12-02 /> This ended one of the last visible remnants of the streetcar service.\n\nRailway operations, however, did not end, and electric freight service continued until 1971, shortly after the company's freight operations were purchased by [[CN Rail]]. Electric freight service was replaced with diesel as part of a general wave of [[dieselization]] of the remaining electric freight railways in Ontario. Dieselization allowed companies to abandon the then-aging electric rolling stock, and to operate the same diesel trains on formerly-electric rail lines as on non-electric mainlines, simplifying freight operations. The last electric freight operation occurred on Saturday 9 October 1971, on what was a cold and rainy day.<ref name=TrainwebA /> However, by this point the remaining railway infrastructure had been reduced to a number of industrial spurs connecting to the CN mainline, with most of the original [[street running]] sections having been removed in the 1950s after the switch to trolleybuses for passenger service.\n\n==Routes==\n\nThe first two routes, in 1896, were a {{convert|1.5|mi|km|adj=on}} route on Pitt Street and a {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}} route on Montreal Street.<ref name=TrainwebA/>  In 1949, the last year of streetcar service, three routes in total were operated along Montreal Street, Pitt Street, and a belt line.<ref name=cornwallseawaynews2018-09-13/>\n\n==Rolling stock==\n\nNone of the early steam [[rolling stock]] is known to have survived.<ref name=wyatt /> Some later vehicles and pieces of equipment, however, have been preserved in various forms:\n* #11 (freight motor) is displayed at the [[Ohio Railway Museum]] under its original [[livery]] as [[Youngstown and Ohio River Railroad]] #7<ref name=TrainwebA />\n* #16 (freight motor) is displayed at the [[Halton County Radial Railway]] under its later livery as [[Lake Erie and Northern Railway]] #335<ref name=TrainwebA />\n* #17 (freight motor) is on permanent display in Cornwall<ref name=TrainwebA />\n* B-1 (snow sweeper) is in storage at the [[Canada Science and Technology Museum]]<ref name=TrainwebA />\n* #3152 (snow plow) built in 1925 by [[Canadian Car and Foundry]] is displayed at the [[Shore Line Trolley Museum]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://shorelinetrolley.org/collection/ |title=Collections |publisher=[[Shore Line Trolley Museum]] |access-date=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n[[Cornwall, Ontario]]\n\n[[Cornwall Electric]]\n\n[[Cornwall Transit]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=standard-freeholder2019-12-02>\n{{cite news \n| url         = https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-history-of-transit-in-cornwall\n| title       = A history of transit in Cornwall\n| work        = [[Cornwall Standard-Freeholder]]\n| author      = Alan Hale\n| date        = 2 December 2019\n| accessdate  = 2 December 2019\n| quote       = The transit system was also vital to the effort during the Second World War.

He also played for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], [[Atlanta Braves]] and [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]].  Before his professional career, he played [[college baseball]] at [[Georgia Tech]], where in 2000 he won the [[Dick Howser Trophy]] as the national collegiate baseball player of the year.  One of the most prolific switch hitters in MLB history, Teixeira was an integral part of the Yankees' 27th [[World Series]] championship in [[2009 World Series|2009]], leading the [[American League]] (AL) in [[home run]]s and [[runs batted in]] (RBI) while finishing second in the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] (MVP) balloting. Teixeira was a three-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], won five [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove Awards]] and three [[Silver Slugger Award]]s, and also holds the all-time major league record for most games with a home run from both sides of the plate, with 14.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=350731104 |title=Teixeira homers from both sides as Yanks rout White Sox 13\u22126 |publisher=ESPN.com |date=August 1, 2015 |accessdate=August 1, 2015}}</ref>  He was the fifth switch hitter in MLB history to reach 400 home runs.\n\nDrafted fifth overall by the Texas Rangers in [[2001 Major League Baseball draft|2001]], Teixeira made his MLB debut on [[Opening Day]] in 2003, and hit 26 home runs as a rookie.  He hit career-highs of 43 home runs and 144 RBI in 2005.  The centerpiece of consecutive mid-season trades in 2007 and 2008, the Rangers first sent him to the Braves for a prospect package centered around [[Elvis Andrus]] and [[Matt Harrison (baseball)|Matt Harrison]]. He was later traded in July 2008 to the Los Angeles Angels, where he played for half a season and lost in the first round of the playoffs. In December 2008, he agreed to a lucrative eight-year contract with the Yankees, contributing his most productive season in pinstripes the following year. Injuries limited his effectiveness afterward, including a calf strain in 2012, early season-ending wrist surgery in 2013, various ailments in 2014, a shin fracture in 2015, and neck spasms and torn cartilage in 2016.

In 1872, [[Max Sandreczky]], a German Christian physician, settled in [[Jerusalem]] and opened the first children's hospital in the country, Marienstift, which admitted children of all faiths.<ref name=NissanMartin>{{cite journal |title=Max Sandreczky: A Pediatric Surgeon in 19th-Century Jerusalem |author=Shemuel Nissan and Petra Martin |journal=Journal of Pediatric Surgery |date=August 1998 |volume= 33| issue =  8 |pages=1187\u201393 |url=http://courses.md.huji.ac.il/96854/childhospital/assets/paper.pdf |accessdate=24 November 2015 |doi=10.1016/s0022-3468(98)90148-8|pmid=9721984 }}</ref>  The Jewish agricultural settlements, financially backed by  [[Baron Edmond de Rothschild]], hired a physician who traveled between the communities and ran a pharmacy in [[Jaffa]] which he visited twice a week.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-54599984/b-nai-b-rith-sha-ar-zion-hospital-in-jaffa-1891-1921 |title=B'nai B'rith-Sha'ar Zion Hospital in Jaffa (1891\u20131921): The First Jewish Community Hospital in Palestine}}</ref>\n\nIn 1902, the first Jewish hospital, [[Shaare Zedek Medical Center|Shaarei Zedek]], opened in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]]. Additional Jewish hospitals were built in Jerusalem and Jaffa. In 1911, the Judea Worker's Health Fund, which later evolved into [[Clalit Health Services]], was established as the first Zionist health insurance fund in the country.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the Ottoman authorities closed the Jewish hospitals in Jerusalem and Jaffa. The Ottoman Army seized the medical equipment and drafted most of the doctors. With the war's end and the British conquest of Palestine, the Yishuv was left without an effective hospital system. In 1918, the [[Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America]] established the American Zionist Medical Unit (AZMU) to rebuild the Yishuv's medical system. With assistance from the AZMU and foreign contributions, the Jewish hospitals were reopened, and a new one was established in Jaffa. In 1919, hospitals were opened in [[Safed]] and [[Tiberias]], and a hospital was opened in [[Haifa]] in 1922. The AZMU was turned into the Hadassah Medical Federation, which oversaw the Yishuv's health system.<ref name=shvarts>Shvarts, Shifra: ''The Workers' Health Fund in Eretz Israel: Kupat Holim, 1911\u20131937''</ref>\n\n===British Mandate ===\nWith the start of British rule, measures were taken to improve public health in the area. They began during British military rule, and continued to grow with the establishment of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] in 1922. In [[Jerusalem]], accumulated refuse heaps were removed, public rubbish bins were installed; the entire population was vaccinated against [[smallpox]], and pools and cisterns were covered with mosquito repellent as part of the campaign to eradicate [[malaria]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.biu.ac.il/js/rennert/history_12.html |title=Life throughout the ages in a holy city}}</ref> In 1929, the [[Zionist Commission]] and the British authorities sent the Jewish epidemiologist [[Gideon Mer]] to [[Rosh Pinna]] to establish a laboratory for malaria research.

The Mandate administration also operated a Health Department that operated its own hospitals, clinics, and laboratories. The Health Department primarily cared for British personnel stationed in Israel and provided health services to the Arab population. Little was invested in Jewish health, as it was assumed that the Yishuv was capable of managing its own healthcare system. With the expansion of the Yishuv through the [[Third Aliyah|Third]] and [[Fourth Aliyah]], the number of new Jewish medical facilities grew. The number of Hadassah hospital beds tripled. New Jewish hospitals and health insurance funds were also established. The other major provider of healthcare aside from Hadassah was the [[Histadrut]] labor federation, which had its own sick fund and by 1946 operated two hospitals and hundreds of clinics and health centers. In addition, some private medical centers and health funds were also established.<ref name=shvarts/>\n\n===State of Israel===\nThe Yishuv's health system formed the basis of the Israeli healthcare system with the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. The Israeli government replaced the British Mandate's health department with a Ministry of Health, and established regional health bureaus and an epidemiological service. Hospital facilities formerly run by the British authorities were taken over by the state, and new hospitals and clinics were established. At the end of 1948, only 53% of Israel's Jewish population was insured, about 80% of them by [[Clalit Health Services|Clalit]], with a few small health funds insuring the remainder. Throughout the following years, Israel's healthcare system was expanded, and within a decade, about 90% were insured.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/aboutisrael/israelat50/pages/the%20health%20care%20system%20in%20israel-%20an%20historical%20pe.aspx |title=The Health Care System in Israel: An Historical Perspective}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1927/05/20/archive/nathan-straus-presents-health-center-in-jerusalem-to-hadassah|title=Nathan Straus Presents Health Center in Jerusalem to Hadassah|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Beit Habriuth Strauss Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Beit Habriyut Straus, [[Jerusalem]], built in 1927]]\n\nIn 1973, a law was enacted which forced all employers to participate in the medical insurance of their workers, by means of a direct payment to their workers' insurance plans. The duty of participation was eventually changed and diminished in 1991.\n\nUntil the enactment of the National Health Insurance Law in 1995, the Israeli healthcare system was based on a series of independently operating Sick Funds, which were known as Kupot Holim. The largest Kupat Holim was [[Clalit Health Services]], which was owned by the [[Histadrut]] labor federation. There were initially six other Kupot Holim, though the number was reduced to four after two of them merged. There was a series of government-owned hospitals, with 29 hospitals operated by the government in 1987. Clalit owned a series of hospitals, as well as clinics in virtually every city, town, village, and kibbutz. There were other organizations which maintained some of their own medical facilities and funded the hospitalization of their clients in government hospitals. For health insurance, people had to pay premiums  which varied according to income. The government also subsidized the health funds. Finally, there were some private doctors and very few private hospitals, and some highly expensive health plans covered private healthcare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1987/02/26/archive/israels-health-care-system-seen-by-many-as-sick-itself|title=Israel's Health Care System Seen by Many As Sick Itself - Jewish Telegraphic Agency|website=www.jta.org}}</ref> The level of health coverage provided varied among Kupot Holim. Furthermore, Clalit was the only one not to restrict entry to new members based on age, pre-existing conditions, or other factors, although membership in the Histadrut labor union was a pre-condition for membership with Clalit. This meant that people who did not (or could not) have such an affiliation and were unable to join another sick fund lacked health insurance coverage. Nevertheless, over 90% of the population was insured by the four funds.\n\nIn 1988 the government appointed a Commission of Inquiry to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of the Israeli health care system, headed by [[Shoshana Netanyahu]]. The commission handed in the final report in 1990. The main recommendation of this report was to enact a National Health Insurance law in Israel. The recommendation was promoted by Health Minister [[Haim Ramon]] and the National Health Insurance Law was passed by the [[Knesset]] in 1994 and came into effect on January 1, 1995.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.physiciansnews.com/2009/10/01/can-universal-healthcare-work-a-look-at-israels-successful-model/ |title=Can Universal Healthcare Work? A Look at Israel's Successful Model}}</ref> After enactment of the 1995 law, membership in any of the four Kupot Holim was legally guaranteed, Clalit's linkage with the Histadrut was severed, and Israeli residents became entitled to the same minimum basic basket of services regardless of which fund they belonged to, and were permitted to switch between funds once a year.\n\nIn the late 2000s, a future shortage of doctors and nurses became a concern, as the rate of doctors graduating from Israel's medical schools annually had dropped to 300, 200 less than needed, and many Soviet immigrant doctors and nurses began to retire. That number was estimated to eventually rise to 520 with the opening of a fifth medical school, but still below the 900 graduates that will be needed in 2022. This caused concerns of a shortage of medical personnel, which would imperil the quality and speed of medical care in the country. As a result, Israel began offering incentives to Jewish doctors to emigrate from abroad and practice medicine in Israel. Initially, only about 100 doctors from the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] immigrated under this program every year, but the program is now attracting doctors from [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]]. An investigative committee looking into the issue also called for incentives to be offered to Israeli medical students who had not been accepted in Israel and had gone to study medicine abroad to return to Israel, and for a program that involves 150 international students studying medicine in Israel to be shut down. In addition, the Israeli Health Ministry announced the launching of a new nursing assistants' profession, and increased nursing education programs in colleges. Israel has also begun a program under which doctors from [[Eastern Europe]] work in Israel in fields such as pediatrics and internal medicine.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/countdown-to-coalition/ |title=Countdown to coalition |author=Yossi Nachemi | work=The Times of Israel |date= 8 March 2013 |accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=180540 | title=Panel decries nurse, doctor shortages | author=Jusdy Siegel-Itzkovich |work=Jerusalem Post |date=7 June 2010 | accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.marketplace.org/topics/life/israel-looks-cure-doctor-shortage | title=Israel looks for cure to doctor shortage | publisher=Marketplace | date=26 February 2008 |accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Health insurance framework==\n===National Health Insurance Law===\n[[File:Israeli Health Care Spending as a Percentage of GDP.jpg|thumb|Health care spending in Israel as a percentage of GDP]]\n\n{{See also|Universal health coverage by country#Israel|l1=Universal health care in Israel}}\nUnder the National Health Insurance Law, membership in one of the four following health funds, or Kupot Holim (''Patient Funds'') is compulsory for all residents of Israel: [[Clalit]], [[Maccabi Health Care Services|Maccabi]], [[Kupat Holim Meuhedet|Meuhedet]] and [[Leumit Health Fund|Leumit]]. Clalit is the largest of the four, with about 54% of the population belonging to it. The four Kupot Holim are obligated to provide a uniform list of health services, known as the \"Health Basket\" (\u05e1\u05dc \u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea; ''Sal Briut'' ), for all members - a list of medical services and treatments which each Kupat Holim is required to fund for its members. The law established a system of direct oversight of the Kupot Holim by the state, and certain services are under the direct administration of the State, usually by means of the [[Health Minister of Israel|Health Ministry]].\n\nThe Health Basket covers all costs of medical diagnosis and treatment in the areas of family medicine, hospitalization (general, maternity, psychiatric and chronic), preventive medicine, surgery (including elective surgery), transplants, treatment for drug abuse and alcoholism, medical equipment and appliances, first aid and transportation to a medical facility, obstetrics and fertility treatment, medications approved under the National Health Basket (which is updated every year), treatment of chronic diseases and paramedical services such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy, and mental healthcare.<ref>{{cite web | title = history of Israel health care| url = http://www.israel.org/MFA/History/Modern%20History/Israel%20at%2050/The%20Health%20Care%20System%20in%20Israel-%20An%20Historical%20Pe}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Cabinet-expands-free-basic-dental-care-to-children-aged-13-and-14-437921|title=Cabinet expands free basic dental care to children aged 13 and 14|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.663963|title=Israel Launches Privatization of Mental Health Care|first=Ido|last=Efrati|date=2 July 2015|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}</ref> Medications for serious illnesses that are part of the official \"basket of medications\" (which is large and updated regularly, but does not include all medications) are covered, though patients must partially pay for these medications with copays: medications included in the basket are covered at rates that vary from 50% to 90%.<ref name=moia>http://www.moia.gov.il/Publications/health_en.pdf</ref> [[In vitro fertilization|IVF]] treatments for the first two children up to the age of 45 and abortions are also covered.\n\nIn general, each Kupat Holim allows members to choose a [[primary care physician]] and specialists from a list of doctors associated with the fund.<ref name=moia/> Availability of services differs by location, as each of these organizations operate their own medical facilities, including private hospitals.\n\nWhile the Kupot Holim typically cover medical treatment in Israel, they can fund medical procedures abroad when the procedure in question cannot be obtained in Israel.

These supplemental plans are usually offered in two or three coverage tiers and include or provide discounts on services and products such as: [[second opinion]]s from medical specialists, surgeries and other medical procedures by private physicians and in private or semi-private facilities in Israel and abroad, dental and orthodontic coverage for adults, discounts on drugs not included in the \"basket of medications\" (i.e., the national [[formulary (pharmacy)|prescription formulary]]), expanded maternity care, additional vaccinations and medical tests, alternative medicine, and more. The cost of these supplemental plans is relatively modest (costing an equivalent of US$10 to $35 per month for an adult depending on age group and coverage tier in 2019). The health funds are prohibited by law from denying any member participation in a supplementary health insurance plan, and may not charge different premiums due to pre-existing conditions, although they usually impose an initial [[waiting period]] before supplemental coverage takes effect. Supplemental plans are heavily promoted by the health funds and as of 2017 more than three quarters of all Israelis subscribe to them.<ref name=\"isrCBS19\">{{cite web |title=\u05dc\u05e7\u05d8 \u05e0\u05ea\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e0\u05d5\u05e9\u05d0 \u05d1\u05d9\u05d8\u05d5\u05d7\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05d3\u05e2 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d5\u05e9\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea, \u05de\u05ea\u05d5\u05da \u05d4\u05e1\u05e7\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9 2017 |url=https://www.cbs.gov.il/he/mediarelease/DocLib/2019/035/19_19_035b.pdf |publisher=[[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] |accessdate=2 March 2020 |language=Hebrew |date=3 February 2019|trans-title=Selected Data on Health Insurances and Health Information From the 2017 Social Survey}}</ref>\n\n====Private insurance coverage====\nThere are private health insurance plans which citizens may participate in addition to the compulsory participation in one of four national health funds. All major Israeli commercial insurance companies offer health insurance plans. These plans provide coverage for additional options for treatments. For example, in the area of elective surgery, a participant in a private insurance plan may choose the surgeon, anesthetist, and hospital anywhere in Israel or around the world. In the area of transplants, unlimited funding is available to ensure a donor is found and the procedure is done without the need for government approval. In the area of medications for serious illnesses, private insurance companies give access to a wider range of than the official \"basket of medications\", as the Israeli government is not financially capable of covering all medications. In comparison with health insurance in other countries, private health insurance in Israel is considered comparatively inexpensive, but premiums are based on age, gender, and unlike the supplemental coverage offered by the health funds also depend on pre-existing conditions and previous medical history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insurance-in-israel.co.il/questions-health-insurance-israel.html#Q1 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925121411/http://insurance-in-israel.co.il/questions-health-insurance-israel.html|title=Public and Private Health Insurance |archivedate=25 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nAs of 2017, approximately one third of Israelis purchase some level of private health insurance coverage.<ref name=\"isrCBS19\"/> Frequently this coverage at least partially overlaps with the supplemental coverage offered by the health funds, meaning that some subscribers pay twice for the same coverage (and which is usually less expensive when obtained through the health funds' supplemental plans). This has prompted calls for the Israeli insurance commissioner to impose tighter regulations on the private health insurance marketplace. Some insurance companies offer private health insurance coverage specifically designed to supplement the supplemental plans offered by the health funds to avoid the double-coverage situation.\n\n==Healthcare providers and facilities==\nProviders in the Israeli [[healthcare systems|healthcare system]] consist of a mixture of private, semi-private and public entities. Generally, [[family medicine|family]] and [[General practitioner|primary]] medicine facilities are run directly by [[Clalit]] for its members while the other Kupot Holim operate their own family practice clinics in the larger cities and contract with privately operated family practice clinics in smaller communities. As with primary practice, Clalit tends to provide specialty and outpatient care in their own clinics while the other health funds generally contract with outside, private care physicians and facilities for this sort of service. In addition to these, the ministry of health in conjunction with various local authorities also runs a network of public well care and [[prenatal care|prenatal]] and infant care clinics throughout the country.\n\n===Private healthcare facilities===\nThere are private hospitals and clinics throughout the country. Although the healthcare in public and private hospitals is equivalent in quality, private hospitals offer superior patient care and amenities to public hospitals, such as private rooms designed as hotel rooms, Internet and television access, restaurant-quality food, and extra beds for visitors to stay overnight.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.justlanded.com/english/Israel/Israel-Guide/Health/Hospitals|title=Israel Guide: Hospitals, Israeli hospitals and medical centres: There are over 45 hospitals and medical|date=4 July 2014|work=Just Landed}}</ref>\n\n==Safety and quality==\nIsrael has one of the most technologically advanced and highest-quality healthcare systems in the world.

However, the medical school at [[Bar-Ilan University]] follows a four-year program similar to the American system. [[Tel Aviv University]] also offers a four-year program similar to the American system for students who hold a [[bachelor's degree]] in certain biological sciences. The entrance requirements for the various schools of medicine are strict: all students must have a [[Bagrut|high school matriculation certificate]] with a grade average above 100 and a [[Psychometric Entrance Test|psychometric]] grade over 740.\n\nIn 2008, only 35% of doctors in Israel were born there, and almost 50% were immigrants, especially from Argentina and Eastern Europe, particularly the former Soviet Union. In addition, many Israelis study medicine abroad, with Israeli medical students particularly popular with European universities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.650145|title=Israel Losing Needed Doctors to Foreign Schools|work=Haaretz.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/more-than-one-in-10-israeli-doctors-working-abroad-study-shows.premium-1.514315|title=Pioneering Study - More Than One in 10 Israeli Doctors Working Abroad, Study Shows|first=Ronny|last=Linder-Ganz|date=8 April 2013|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}</ref> To practice in Israel, doctors trained abroad must pass a licensing examination to ensure that their medical training is up to Israeli standards.

A Bachelor's degree is a prerequisite for advanced certifications and clinical courses.<ref>[http://www.nursesinisrael.co.il/image/users/184470/ftp/my_files/%D7%94%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA.pdf?id=12429329]</ref><ref>http://www.old.health.gov.il/Download/pages/tnaiim040511.pdf</ref>\nLicensed practical nurse programs ended, yet were recently re-approved as a solution to the nursing shortage in Israel.\nAlthough nurse practitioners were legalized in Israel in November 2013,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://old.justice.gov.il|date= 21 November 2013 |title=The Knesset - Rishumot kovetz Hatakanot 7307 (File of Legal Records 7307) Jerusalem, Israel|website=old.justicce.gov.il}}</ref> only Israeli-trained nurse practitioners are authorized to work. Although the law provides for recognition of foreign-trained nurse practitioners, no process is in place for doing so. Only geriatric, palliative and neonatal nurse practitioners have been allowed to work thus far, although plans for other NP specialties are in place.  All NP courses to date have been provided by the Ministry of Health, and are post-Masters certificate courses several months in length. Compared to Western country standards and the International Council of Nursing, Israeli nurse practitioners have relatively limited scopes of practice and independence.\n\n== Physician assistants ==\nOne of the well-established solutions to the growing shortage of medical personnel that is experienced also in Israel is the development of mid-level practitioners, e.g., nurse practitioners and physician assistants. The development of Physician Assistants in Israel was in a constant debate for years until a committee appointed by the Ministry of Health Director General recommended on 2013 on the development of an Israeli version of Physician Assistants in five areas that are currently in great need: Internal Medicine, Surgery, Anesthesiology, Emergency Medicine and Pathology. Because of legislative reasons, and in order to implement fast, the Ministry of Health decided not to create a new general profession like in the US but to expand the capabilities and authorities of existing medical professions thus creating new 'roles' for these professions as Physician Assistants.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Physician assistants in Israel|first1=Oren|last1=Berkowitz|first2=Eyal|last2=Jacobson|first3=Gil|last3=Fire|first4=Arnon|last4=Afek|date=1 December 2014|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Physician Assistants|volume=27|issue=12|pages=7\u20138|doi=10.1097/01.JAA.0000456577.54756.e8|pmid=25373394}}</ref> The first course of Emergency Medicine Physician Assistants started on May 15, 2016, comprising about 35 participants, most of them academic paramedic with substantial experience and very few MDs from international universities (outside Israel) that failed to pass the Israeli government examination so are not licensed to practice medicine in Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.health.gov.il/english/services/medicalandhealthprofessions/physicianassistants/pages/default.aspx|title=Physician Assistants - Israel Ministry of Health Website|publisher=}}</ref> In the near future the Israeli Ministry of Health intends to open similar courses in the areas of Anesthesiology and Pathology.\n\n== Emergency services ==\n[[File:MDA Armoured Ambulance.jpg|thumb|Magen David Adom armored mobile intensive care unit]]\n\n[[Emergency medical services in Israel]] are provided by the [[Magen David Adom]] (MDA) organization, which staffs approximately 1,200 [[emergency medical technician]]s, [[paramedic]]s, and [[emergency physician]]s, and 10,000 volunteers. The organizations operates 95 stations and a fleet of over 700 ambulances. The majority of the fleet consists of [[basic life support]] ambulances. There are also smaller numbers of [[advanced life support]] ambulances and [[Mobile intensive care ambulance|mobile intensive care units]]. For [[air ambulance]] services, MDA relies primarily on [[Unit 669]] of the [[Israeli Air Force]]. There are also four [[MBB Bo 105]] utility helicopters staffed with MDA paramedics owned by Lahak Aviation operating as air ambulances throughout the country. Non-emergency and repatriation air ambulance services are normally provided by private charter carriers.\n\nMagen David Adom is supplemented in some areas by [[Hatzalah]], an emergency ambulance services network serving Jewish communities worldwide, and [[ZAKA]], a series of [[community emergency response team]]s staffed by Orthodox Jews, who in addition to providing medical services and evacuation, also aid in the identification of terrorism victims and gather spilled blood and body parts for burial. The [[Palestine Red Crescent Society]] also provides services to Arab neighborhoods in [[Jerusalem]]. It gained access to Jerusalem after signing a 2005 Memorandum of Understanding with Magen David Adom.\n\nThe ambulance system, for the most part, conforms to the Franco-German model of EMS care, and the presence of physicians at high-acuity emergencies is not uncommon. In addition, emergency ambulance services is bolstered by a variety of private carriers tasked with interfacility transfers only.\n\n==Medical tourism==\n{{main article|Medical tourism in Israel}}\n[[File:Tuba Zangarya Kupat Cholim.JPG|thumb|[[Clalit Health Services|Clalit]] clinic in the [[Bedouin]] Arab village of [[Tuba-Zangariyye]]]][[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Humanitarian Passage through the Erez Crossings.jpg|thumb|[[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] residents being transferred for medical treatment in Israel through [[Erez Crossing]]]]\n\nIsrael is emerging as a popular destination for medical tourists.<ref name=\"Haaretz\">{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/welcoming-the-world-s-ills-1.238860 |title=Welcoming the world's ills |publisher=Haaretz | date=7 February 2008}}</ref> In 2006, 15,000 foreigners travelled to the country for medical procedures, bringing in $40 million of revenue.<ref name=\"Haaretz\"/> As of 2010, up to 30,000 foreigners come to Israel every year for treatment, mostly from Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/health-ministry-to-probe-israel-medical-tourism-industry-following-haaretz-expose-1.325424|date=18 November 2010|title=Health Ministry to probe Israel medical tourism industry following Haaretz expos\u00e9|author=Dan Even|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=21 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nSome medical tourists come to Israel because the procedures they seek are not available in their home countries.

Nevertheless, as of 2016, there are roughly 250,000 non-tourists that stay in Israel for long periods that are not entitled to the benefits of the National Health Insurance Law. About 100,000 of them are foreign workers who entered Israel legally and have a mandatory private health insurance that is paid by their employer. Another 100,000 are people who entered Israel legally (as tourists or as foreign workers) but became illegal residents after overstaying their visas. The remaining 50,000 are work immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees, mainly from Eritrea and Sudan, who entered Israel illegally through the Egyptian border (prior to the construction of the [[Egypt\u2013Israel barrier]]).<ref>[[Illegal immigration from Africa to Israel]]</ref> For those illegal residents that are working full-time, there is a mandatory health insurance by the employer. This insurance is limited as it is dependent on the continued work and payments subtracted from salary, thus becoming ineffective and practically expires as the insured becomes unemployed from health reasons.\n\nFor those 'illegal residents' that don't have effective health insurance and are protected from deportation to their countries of origin (because of the ongoing conflicts or forced recruitment), a few services were developed either by the Israel Ministry of Health or by local NGOs and international aid organizations. The most important services include free access to Emergency Rooms and hospitalization services when needed for urgent care, primary care clinics,<ref>[[Physicians for Human Rights-Israel|Physicians for Human Rights\u2013Israel]]</ref> and a psychiatric clinic. There is a Public Health Clinic in Tel Aviv jointly run by the Terem organization and the Israeli Health Ministry which provides emergency care, specialist services in a number of fields, and dental care to people who do not qualify for coverage under the National Health Insurance Law and have no other source of coverage, aside from tourists. Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers make up a large part of its client base.<ref>http://www.terem.com/ClinicID.aspx?TeremClinicId=21&teremRegionId=5&lang=2</ref>\n\n==Medical facilities==\n{{See also|List of hospitals in Israel}}\nIn the end of 2014, there were 85 hospitals in Israel: 44 general hospitals, 12 mental health hospitals, 29 specialized hospitals (geriatric and rehabilitation centers), as well as 278 residential long-term facilities.<ref>[http://www.health.gov.il/PublicationsFiles/mosadot2014_p1.pdf Inpatient Institutions and Day Care Units in Israel 2014]</ref> Only 11 of the general hospitals are government-owned and operated by the Ministry of Health, 9 owned by Clalit, and the rest are private, such as [[Herzliya Medical Center]].

Most medical institutions were run by Christian missionaries, who attracted the indigent by offering free care. In the late nineteenth century, as the [[Yishuv]], the pre-state Jewish community,  began to grow in the wake of the [[First Aliyah]], the Jews attempted to establish their own medical system. In 1872, [[Max Sandreczky]], a German Christian physician, settled in [[Jerusalem]] and opened the first children's hospital in the country, Marienstift, which admitted children of all faiths.<ref name=NissanMartin>{{cite journal |title=Max Sandreczky: A Pediatric Surgeon in 19th-Century Jerusalem |author=Shemuel Nissan and Petra Martin |journal=Journal of Pediatric Surgery |date=August 1998 |volume= 33| issue =  8 |pages=1187\u201393 |url=http://courses.md.huji.ac.il/96854/childhospital/assets/paper.pdf |accessdate=24 November 2015 |doi=10.1016/s0022-3468(98)90148-8|pmid=9721984 }}</ref>  The Jewish agricultural settlements, financially backed by  [[Baron Edmond de Rothschild]], hired a physician who traveled between the communities and ran a pharmacy in [[Jaffa]] which he visited twice a week.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-54599984/b-nai-b-rith-sha-ar-zion-hospital-in-jaffa-1891-1921 |title=B'nai B'rith-Sha'ar Zion Hospital in Jaffa (1891\u20131921): The First Jewish Community Hospital in Palestine}}</ref>\n\nIn 1902, the first Jewish hospital, [[Shaare Zedek Medical Center|Shaarei Zedek]], opened in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]]. Additional Jewish hospitals were built in Jerusalem and Jaffa. In 1911, the Judea Worker's Health Fund, which later evolved into [[Clalit Health Services]], was established as the first Zionist health insurance fund in the country.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the Ottoman authorities closed the Jewish hospitals in Jerusalem and Jaffa. The Ottoman Army seized the medical equipment and drafted most of the doctors. With the war's end and the British conquest of Palestine, the Yishuv was left without an effective hospital system. In 1918, the [[Hadassah Women's Zionist Organization of America]] established the American Zionist Medical Unit (AZMU) to rebuild the Yishuv's medical system. With assistance from the AZMU and foreign contributions, the Jewish hospitals were reopened, and a new one was established in Jaffa. In 1919, hospitals were opened in [[Safed]] and [[Tiberias]], and a hospital was opened in [[Haifa]] in 1922. The AZMU was turned into the Hadassah Medical Federation, which oversaw the Yishuv's health system.<ref name=shvarts>Shvarts, Shifra: ''The Workers' Health Fund in Eretz Israel: Kupat Holim, 1911\u20131937''</ref>\n\n===British Mandate ===\nWith the start of British rule, measures were taken to improve public health in the area. They began during British military rule, and continued to grow with the establishment of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] in 1922. In [[Jerusalem]], accumulated refuse heaps were removed, public rubbish bins were installed; the entire population was vaccinated against [[smallpox]], and pools and cisterns were covered with mosquito repellent as part of the campaign to eradicate [[malaria]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.biu.ac.il/js/rennert/history_12.html |title=Life throughout the ages in a holy city}}</ref> In 1929, the [[Zionist Commission]] and the British authorities sent the Jewish epidemiologist [[Gideon Mer]] to [[Rosh Pinna]] to establish a laboratory for malaria research.

The Mandate administration also operated a Health Department that operated its own hospitals, clinics, and laboratories. The Health Department primarily cared for British personnel stationed in Israel and provided health services to the Arab population. Little was invested in Jewish health, as it was assumed that the Yishuv was capable of managing its own healthcare system. With the expansion of the Yishuv through the [[Third Aliyah|Third]] and [[Fourth Aliyah]], the number of new Jewish medical facilities grew. The number of Hadassah hospital beds tripled. New Jewish hospitals and health insurance funds were also established. The other major provider of healthcare aside from Hadassah was the [[Histadrut]] labor federation, which had its own sick fund and by 1946 operated two hospitals and hundreds of clinics and health centers. In addition, some private medical centers and health funds were also established.<ref name=shvarts/>\n\n===State of Israel===\nThe Yishuv's health system formed the basis of the Israeli healthcare system with the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. The Israeli government replaced the British Mandate's health department with a Ministry of Health, and established regional health bureaus and an epidemiological service. Hospital facilities formerly run by the British authorities were taken over by the state, and new hospitals and clinics were established. At the end of 1948, only 53% of Israel's Jewish population was insured, about 80% of them by [[Clalit Health Services|Clalit]], with a few small health funds insuring the remainder. Throughout the following years, Israel's healthcare system was expanded, and within a decade, about 90% were insured.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/aboutisrael/israelat50/pages/the%20health%20care%20system%20in%20israel-%20an%20historical%20pe.aspx |title=The Health Care System in Israel: An Historical Perspective}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1927/05/20/archive/nathan-straus-presents-health-center-in-jerusalem-to-hadassah|title=Nathan Straus Presents Health Center in Jerusalem to Hadassah|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Beit Habriuth Strauss Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Beit Habriyut Straus, [[Jerusalem]], built in 1927]]\n\nIn 1973, a law was enacted which forced all employers to participate in the medical insurance of their workers, by means of a direct payment to their workers' insurance plans. The duty of participation was eventually changed and diminished in 1991.\n\nUntil the enactment of the National Health Insurance Law in 1995, the Israeli healthcare system was based on a series of independently operating Sick Funds, which were known as Kupot Holim. The largest Kupat Holim was [[Clalit Health Services]], which was owned by the [[Histadrut]] labor federation. There were initially six other Kupot Holim, though the number was reduced to four after two of them merged. There was a series of government-owned hospitals, with 29 hospitals operated by the government in 1987. Clalit owned a series of hospitals, as well as clinics in virtually every city, town, village, and kibbutz. There were other organizations which maintained some of their own medical facilities and funded the hospitalization of their clients in government hospitals. For health insurance, people had to pay premiums  which varied according to income. The government also subsidized the health funds. Finally, there were some private doctors and very few private hospitals, and some highly expensive health plans covered private healthcare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1987/02/26/archive/israels-health-care-system-seen-by-many-as-sick-itself|title=Israel's Health Care System Seen by Many As Sick Itself - Jewish Telegraphic Agency|website=www.jta.org}}</ref> The level of health coverage provided varied among Kupot Holim. Furthermore, Clalit was the only one not to restrict entry to new members based on age, pre-existing conditions, or other factors, although membership in the Histadrut labor union was a pre-condition for membership with Clalit. This meant that people who did not (or could not) have such an affiliation and were unable to join another sick fund lacked health insurance coverage. Nevertheless, over 90% of the population was insured by the four funds.\n\nIn 1988 the government appointed a Commission of Inquiry to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of the Israeli health care system, headed by [[Shoshana Netanyahu]]. The commission handed in the final report in 1990. The main recommendation of this report was to enact a National Health Insurance law in Israel. The recommendation was promoted by Health Minister [[Haim Ramon]] and the National Health Insurance Law was passed by the [[Knesset]] in 1994 and came into effect on January 1, 1995.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.physiciansnews.com/2009/10/01/can-universal-healthcare-work-a-look-at-israels-successful-model/ |title=Can Universal Healthcare Work? A Look at Israel's Successful Model}}</ref> After enactment of the 1995 law, membership in any of the four Kupot Holim was legally guaranteed, Clalit's linkage with the Histadrut was severed, and Israeli residents became entitled to the same minimum basic basket of services regardless of which fund they belonged to, and were permitted to switch between funds once a year.\n\nIn the late 2000s, a future shortage of doctors and nurses became a concern, as the rate of doctors graduating from Israel's medical schools annually had dropped to 300, 200 less than needed, and many Soviet immigrant doctors and nurses began to retire. That number was estimated to eventually rise to 520 with the opening of a fifth medical school, but still below the 900 graduates that will be needed in 2022. This caused concerns of a shortage of medical personnel, which would imperil the quality and speed of medical care in the country. As a result, Israel began offering incentives to Jewish doctors to emigrate from abroad and practice medicine in Israel. Initially, only about 100 doctors from the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] immigrated under this program every year, but the program is now attracting doctors from [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]]. An investigative committee looking into the issue also called for incentives to be offered to Israeli medical students who had not been accepted in Israel and had gone to study medicine abroad to return to Israel, and for a program that involves 150 international students studying medicine in Israel to be shut down. In addition, the Israeli Health Ministry announced the launching of a new nursing assistants' profession, and increased nursing education programs in colleges. Israel has also begun a program under which doctors from [[Eastern Europe]] work in Israel in fields such as pediatrics and internal medicine.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/countdown-to-coalition/ |title=Countdown to coalition |author=Yossi Nachemi | work=The Times of Israel |date= 8 March 2013 |accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=180540 | title=Panel decries nurse, doctor shortages | author=Jusdy Siegel-Itzkovich |work=Jerusalem Post |date=7 June 2010 | accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.marketplace.org/topics/life/israel-looks-cure-doctor-shortage | title=Israel looks for cure to doctor shortage | publisher=Marketplace | date=26 February 2008 |accessdate=3 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Health insurance framework==\n===National Health Insurance Law===\n[[File:Israeli Health Care Spending as a Percentage of GDP.jpg|thumb|Health care spending in Israel as a percentage of GDP]]\n\n{{See also|Universal health coverage by country#Israel|l1=Universal health care in Israel}}\nUnder the National Health Insurance Law, membership in one of the four following health funds, or Kupot Holim (''Patient Funds'') is compulsory for all residents of Israel: [[Clalit]], [[Maccabi Health Care Services|Maccabi]], [[Kupat Holim Meuhedet|Meuhedet]] and [[Leumit Health Fund|Leumit]]. Clalit is the largest of the four, with about 54% of the population belonging to it. The four Kupot Holim are obligated to provide a uniform list of health services, known as the \"Health Basket\" (\u05e1\u05dc \u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea; ''Sal Briut'' ), for all members - a list of medical services and treatments which each Kupat Holim is required to fund for its members. The law established a system of direct oversight of the Kupot Holim by the state, and certain services are under the direct administration of the State, usually by means of the [[Health Minister of Israel|Health Ministry]].\n\nThe Health Basket covers all costs of medical diagnosis and treatment in the areas of family medicine, hospitalization (general, maternity, psychiatric and chronic), preventive medicine, surgery (including elective surgery), transplants, treatment for drug abuse and alcoholism, medical equipment and appliances, first aid and transportation to a medical facility, obstetrics and fertility treatment, medications approved under the National Health Basket (which is updated every year), treatment of chronic diseases and paramedical services such as physiotherapy and occupational therapy, and mental healthcare.<ref>{{cite web | title = history of Israel health care| url = http://www.israel.org/MFA/History/Modern%20History/Israel%20at%2050/The%20Health%20Care%20System%20in%20Israel-%20An%20Historical%20Pe}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Cabinet-expands-free-basic-dental-care-to-children-aged-13-and-14-437921|title=Cabinet expands free basic dental care to children aged 13 and 14|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.663963|title=Israel Launches Privatization of Mental Health Care|first=Ido|last=Efrati|date=2 July 2015|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}</ref> Medications for serious illnesses that are part of the official \"basket of medications\" (which is large and updated regularly, but does not include all medications) are covered, though patients must partially pay for these medications with copays: medications included in the basket are covered at rates that vary from 50% to 90%.<ref name=moia>http://www.moia.gov.il/Publications/health_en.pdf</ref> [[In vitro fertilization|IVF]] treatments for the first two children up to the age of 45 and abortions are also covered.\n\nIn general, each Kupat Holim allows members to choose a [[primary care physician]] and specialists from a list of doctors associated with the fund.<ref name=moia/> Availability of services differs by location, as each of these organizations operate their own medical facilities, including private hospitals.\n\nWhile the Kupot Holim typically cover medical treatment in Israel, they can fund medical procedures abroad when the procedure in question cannot be obtained in Israel.

These supplemental plans are usually offered in two or three coverage tiers and include or provide discounts on services and products such as: [[second opinion]]s from medical specialists, surgeries and other medical procedures by private physicians and in private or semi-private facilities in Israel and abroad, dental and orthodontic coverage for adults, discounts on drugs not included in the \"basket of medications\" (i.e, the national [[formulary (pharmacy)|prescription formulary]]), expanded maternity care, additional vaccinations and medical tests, alternative medicine, and more. The cost of these supplemental plans is relatively modest (costing an equivalent of US$10 to $35 per month for an adult depending on age group and coverage tier in 2019). The health funds are prohibited by law from denying any member participation in a supplementary health insurance plan, and may not charge different premiums due to pre-existing conditions, although they usually impose an initial [[waiting period]] before supplemental coverage takes effect. Supplemental plans are heavily promoted by the health funds and as of 2017 more than three quarters of all Israelis subscribe to them.<ref name=\"isrCBS19\">{{cite web |title=\u05dc\u05e7\u05d8 \u05e0\u05ea\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05e0\u05d5\u05e9\u05d0 \u05d1\u05d9\u05d8\u05d5\u05d7\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea \u05d5\u05de\u05d9\u05d3\u05e2 \u05d1\u05e0\u05d5\u05e9\u05d0 \u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea, \u05de\u05ea\u05d5\u05da \u05d4\u05e1\u05e7\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d7\u05d1\u05e8\u05ea\u05d9 2017 |url=https://www.cbs.gov.il/he/mediarelease/DocLib/2019/035/19_19_035b.pdf |publisher=[[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] |accessdate=2 March 2020 |language=Hebrew |date=3 February 2019|trans-title=Selected Data on Health Insurances and Health Information From the 2017 Social Survey}}</ref>\n\n====Private insurance coverage====\nThere are private health insurance plans which citizens may participate in addition to the compulsory participation in one of four national health funds. All major Israeli commercial insurance companies offer health insurance plans. These plans provide coverage for additional options for treatments. For example, in the area of elective surgery, a participant in a private insurance plan may choose the surgeon, anesthetist, and hospital anywhere in Israel or around the world. In the area of transplants, unlimited funding is available to ensure a donor is found and the procedure is done without the need for government approval. In the area of medications for serious illnesses, private insurance companies give access to a wider range of than the official \"basket of medications\", as the Israeli government is not financially capable of covering all medications. In comparison with health insurance in other countries, private health insurance in Israel is considered comparatively inexpensive, but premiums are based on age, gender, and unlike the supplemental coverage offered by the health funds also depend on pre-existing conditions and previous medical history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insurance-in-israel.co.il/questions-health-insurance-israel.html#Q1 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925121411/http://insurance-in-israel.co.il/questions-health-insurance-israel.html|title=Public and Private Health Insurance |archivedate=25 September 2013 }}</ref>\n\nAs of 2017, approximately one third of Israelis purchase some level of private health insurance coverage.<ref name=\"isrCBS19\"/> Frequently this coverage at least partially overlaps with the supplemental coverage offered by the health funds, meaning that some subscribers pay twice for the same coverage (and which is usually less expensive when obtained through the health funds' supplemental plans). This has prompted calls for the Israeli insurance commissioner to impose tighter regulations on the private health insurance marketplace. Some insurance companies offer private health insurance coverage specifically designed to supplement the supplemental plans offered by the health funds to avoid the double-coverage situation.\n\n==Healthcare providers and facilities==\nProviders in the Israeli [[healthcare systems|healthcare system]] consist of a mixture of private, semi-private and public entities. Generally, [[family medicine|family]] and [[General practitioner|primary]] medicine facilities are run directly by [[Clalit]] for its members while the other Kupot Holim operate their own family practice clinics in the larger cities and contract with privately operated family practice clinics in smaller communities. As with primary practice, Clalit tends to provide specialty and outpatient care in their own clinics while the other health funds generally contract with outside, private care physicians and facilities for this sort of service. In addition to these, the ministry of health in conjunction with various local authorities also runs a network of public well care and [[prenatal care|prenatal]] and infant care clinics throughout the country.\n\n===Private healthcare facilities===\nThere are private hospitals and clinics throughout the country.

However, the medical school at [[Bar-Ilan University]] follows a four-year program similar to the American system. [[Tel Aviv University]] also offers a four-year program similar to the American system for students who hold a [[bachelor's degree]] in certain biological sciences. The entrance requirements for the various schools of medicine are strict: all students must have a [[Bagrut|high school matriculation certificate]] with a grade average above 100 and a [[Psychometric Entrance Test|psychometric]] grade over 740.\n\nIn 2008, only 35% of doctors in Israel were born there, and almost 50% were immigrants, especially from Argentina and Eastern Europe, particularly the former Soviet Union. In addition, many Israelis study medicine abroad, with Israeli medical students particularly popular with European universities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.650145|title=Israel Losing Needed Doctors to Foreign Schools|work=Haaretz.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/more-than-one-in-10-israeli-doctors-working-abroad-study-shows.premium-1.514315|title=Pioneering Study - More Than One in 10 Israeli Doctors Working Abroad, Study Shows|first=Ronny|last=Linder-Ganz|date=8 April 2013|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}</ref> To practice in Israel, doctors trained abroad must pass a licensing examination to ensure that their medical training is up to Israeli standards.

Although the law provides for recognition of foreign-trained nurse practitioners, no process is in place for doing so. Only geriatric, palliative and neonatal nurse practitioners have been allowed to work thus far, although plans for other NP specialties are in place.  All NP courses to date have been provided by the Ministry of Health, and are post-Masters certificate courses several months in length. Compared to Western country standards and the International Council of Nursing, Israeli nurse practitioners have relatively limited scopes of practice and independence.\n\n== Physician assistants ==\nOne of the well-established solutions to the growing shortage of medical personnel that is experienced also in Israel is the development of mid-level practitioners, e.g., nurse practitioners and physician assistants. The development of Physician Assistants in Israel was in a constant debate for years until a committee appointed by the Ministry of Health Director General recommended on 2013 on the development of an Israeli version of Physician Assistants in five areas that are currently in great need: Internal Medicine, Surgery, Anesthesiology, Emergency Medicine and Pathology. Because of legislative reasons, and in order to implement fast, the Ministry of Health decided not to create a new general profession like in the US but to expand the capabilities and authorities of existing medical professions thus creating new 'roles' for these professions as Physician Assistants.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Physician assistants in Israel|first1=Oren|last1=Berkowitz|first2=Eyal|last2=Jacobson|first3=Gil|last3=Fire|first4=Arnon|last4=Afek|date=1 December 2014|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Physician Assistants|volume=27|issue=12|pages=7\u20138|doi=10.1097/01.JAA.0000456577.54756.e8|pmid=25373394}}</ref> The first course of Emergency Medicine Physician Assistants started on May 15, 2016, comprising about 35 participants, most of them academic paramedic with substantial experience and very few MDs from international universities (outside Israel) that failed to pass the Israeli government examination so are not licensed to practice medicine in Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.health.gov.il/english/services/medicalandhealthprofessions/physicianassistants/pages/default.aspx|title=Physician Assistants - Israel Ministry of Health Website|publisher=}}</ref> In the near future the Israeli Ministry of Health intends to open similar courses in the areas of Anesthesiology and Pathology.\n\n== Emergency services ==\n[[File:MDA Armoured Ambulance.jpg|thumb|Magen David Adom armored mobile intensive care unit]]\n\n[[Emergency medical services in Israel]] are provided by the [[Magen David Adom]] (MDA) organization, which staffs approximately 1,200 [[emergency medical technician]]s, [[paramedic]]s, and [[emergency physician]]s, and 10,000 volunteers. The organizations operates 95 stations and a fleet of over 700 ambulances. The majority of the fleet consists of [[basic life support]] ambulances. There are also smaller numbers of [[advanced life support]] ambulances and [[Mobile intensive care ambulance|mobile intensive care units]]. For [[air ambulance]] services, MDA relies primarily on [[Unit 669]] of the [[Israeli Air Force]]. There are also four [[MBB Bo 105]] utility helicopters staffed with MDA paramedics owned by Lahak Aviation operating as air ambulances throughout the country. Non-emergency and repatriation air ambulance services are normally provided by private charter carriers.\n\nMagen David Adom is supplemented in some areas by [[Hatzalah]], an emergency ambulance services network serving Jewish communities worldwide, and [[ZAKA]], a series of [[community emergency response team]]s staffed by Orthodox Jews, who in addition to providing medical services and evacuation, also aid in the identification of terrorism victims and gather spilled blood and body parts for burial. The [[Palestine Red Crescent Society]] also provides services to Arab neighborhoods in [[Jerusalem]]. It gained access to Jerusalem after signing a 2005 Memorandum of Understanding with Magen David Adom.\n\nThe ambulance system, for the most part, conforms to the Franco-German model of EMS care, and the presence of physicians at high-acuity emergencies is not uncommon. In addition, emergency ambulance services is bolstered by a variety of private carriers tasked with interfacility transfers only.\n\n==Medical tourism==\n{{main article|Medical tourism in Israel}}\n[[File:Tuba Zangarya Kupat Cholim.JPG|thumb|[[Clalit Health Services|Clalit]] clinic in the [[Bedouin]] Arab village of [[Tuba-Zangariyye]]]][[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Humanitarian Passage through the Erez Crossings.jpg|thumb|[[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] residents being transferred for medical treatment in Israel through [[Erez Crossing]]]]\n\nIsrael is emerging as a popular destination for medical tourists.<ref name=\"Haaretz\">{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/welcoming-the-world-s-ills-1.238860 |title=Welcoming the world's ills |publisher=Haaretz | date=7 February 2008}}</ref> In 2006, 15,000 foreigners travelled to the country for medical procedures, bringing in $40 million of revenue.<ref name=\"Haaretz\"/> As of 2010, up to 30,000 foreigners come to Israel every year for treatment, mostly from Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/health-ministry-to-probe-israel-medical-tourism-industry-following-haaretz-expose-1.325424|date=18 November 2010|title=Health Ministry to probe Israel medical tourism industry following Haaretz expos\u00e9|author=Dan Even|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=21 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nSome medical tourists come to Israel because the procedures they seek are not available in their home countries.

Nevertheless, as of 2016, there are roughly 250,000 non-tourists that stay in Israel for long periods that are not entitled to the benefits of the National Health Insurance Law. About 100,000 of them are foreign workers who entered Israel legally and have a mandatory private health insurance that is paid by their employer. Another 100,000 are people who entered Israel legally (as tourists or as foreign workers) but became illegal residents after overstaying their visas. The remaining 50,000 are work immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees, mainly from Eritrea and Sudan, who entered Israel illegally through the Egyptian border (prior to the construction of the [[Egypt\u2013Israel barrier]]).<ref>[[Illegal immigration from Africa to Israel]]</ref> For those illegal residents that are working full-time, there is a mandatory health insurance by the employer. This insurance is limited as it is dependent on the continued work and payments subtracted from salary, thus becoming ineffective and practically expires as the insured becomes unemployed from health reasons.\n\nFor those 'illegal residents' that don't have effective health insurance and are protected from deportation to their countries of origin (because of the ongoing conflicts or forced recruitment), a few services were developed either by the Israel Ministry of Health or by local NGOs and international aid organizations. The most important services include free access to Emergency Rooms and hospitalization services when needed for urgent care, primary care clinics,<ref>[[Physicians for Human Rights-Israel|Physicians for Human Rights\u2013Israel]]</ref> and a psychiatric clinic. There is a Public Health Clinic in Tel Aviv jointly run by the Terem organization and the Israeli Health Ministry which provides emergency care, specialist services in a number of fields, and dental care to people who do not qualify for coverage under the National Health Insurance Law and have no other source of coverage, aside from tourists. Eritrean and Sudanese asylum seekers make up a large part of its client base.<ref>http://www.terem.com/ClinicID.aspx?TeremClinicId=21&teremRegionId=5&lang=2</ref>\n\n==Medical facilities==\n{{See also|List of hospitals in Israel}}\nIn the end of 2014, there were 85 hospitals in Israel: 44 general hospitals, 12 mental health hospitals, 29 specialized hospitals (geriatric and rehabilitation centers), as well as 278 residential long-term facilities.<ref>[http://www.health.gov.il/PublicationsFiles/mosadot2014_p1.pdf Inpatient Institutions and Day Care Units in Israel 2014]</ref> Only 11 of the general hospitals are government-owned and operated by the Ministry of Health, 9 owned by Clalit, and the rest are private, such as [[Herzliya Medical Center]].

[[BHP|BHP Biliton]] was the owner of the mine when it was opened, but they wanted to close the mine as a consequence of major environmental damage due to negligence. The Government was faced with a great loss of revenue and a formula was found to continue mining. BHP transferred its shares to a trust fund for the local community, and BHP was in return granted immunity from claims because of environmental damages, while BHP continued to manage the mine. O\u2019Neill considered that a mistake and revoked the immunity. One concern was that proceeds from the mine were disappearing abroad instead of staying within Papua New Guinea. This is connected to a political rivalry with former Prime Minister Sir [[Mekere Morauta]], whose political base is in that part of the country. Morauta, as chairman of PNGSDF, challenged the nationalisation without compensation and refused access to the externalised PNGSDF in Singapore which is meant as a Social Wealth Fund for when the mine is exhausted. The case is continuing in the Singaporean courts. The government has gained the right to inspect the books of PNGSDP as it is a shareholder, but the issue of ownership is still undecided.<ref>Independent State of Papua New Guinea v PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd [2016] SGHC 19 Originating Summons No 234 of 2015 Date of judgement: 12 February 2016 Judge: Judith Prakash Available at: http://www.singaporelaw.sg/sglaw/laws-of-singapore/case-law/free-law/high-court-judgments/18364-independent-state-of-papua-new-guinea-v-png-sustainable-development-program-ltd Accessed: 10/11/2017</ref> An arbitration attempt in Singapore failed as there was no written consent to arbitration from the Papua New Guinea government.<ref>Marquita Davis: Unanimous ICSID tribunal dismisses expropriation claim due to Papua New Guinea\u2019s lack of written consent to arbitrate PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd. v.

[[BHP|BHP Biliton]] was the owner of the mine when it was opened, but they wanted to close the mine as a consequence of major environmental damage due to negligence. The Government was faced with a great loss of revenue and a formula was found to continue mining. BHP transferred its shares to a trust fund for the local community, and BHP was in return granted immunity from claims because of environmental damages, while BHP continued to manage the mine. O\u2019Neill considered that a mistake and revoked the immunity. One concern was that proceeds from the mine were disappearing abroad instead of staying within PNG. This is connected to a political rivalry with former Prime Minister Sir [[Mekere Morauta]], whose political base is in that part of the country. Morauta, as chairman of PNGSDF, challenged the nationalisation without compensation and refused access to the externalised PNGSDF in Singapore which is meant as a Social Wealth Fund for when the mine is exhausted. The case is continuing in the Singaporean courts. The government has gained the right to inspect the books of PNGSDP as it is a shareholder, but the issue of ownership is still undecided.<ref>Independent State of Papua New Guinea v PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd [2016] SGHC 19 Originating Summons No 234 of 2015 Date of judgement: 12 February 2016 Judge: Judith Prakash Available at: http://www.singaporelaw.sg/sglaw/laws-of-singapore/case-law/free-law/high-court-judgments/18364-independent-state-of-papua-new-guinea-v-png-sustainable-development-program-ltd Accessed: 10/11/2017</ref> An arbitration attempt in Singapore failed as there was no written consent to arbitration from the PNG government.<ref>Marquita Davis: Unanimous ICSID tribunal dismisses expropriation claim due to Papua New Guinea\u2019s lack of written consent to arbitrate PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd. v.
