''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', December 31, 1986.</ref>\n\nIn 1985, the Ontario Ministry of Municipal and Cultural Affairs, together with Communications Canada, approved the creation of an Ontario-based French-language educational television network. At the time, the only portions of Ontario with access to a dedicated francophone educational television service were the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]] and the [[Ottawa Valley]], which were served by [[T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec|Radio-Qu\u00e9bec]] outlet [[CIVO-TV]] in [[Hull, Quebec|Hull]]. In 1986, the new network received its broadcast licence from the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC). On January 1, 1987, this network was officially launched by the Ontario Educational Communications Authority under the name '''La Cha\u00eene Fran\u00e7aise''' (primarily known on-air as '''La Cha\u00eene'''). In 1995, La Cha\u00eene was renamed '''TFO''' (short for '''T\u00e9l\u00e9vision fran\u00e7aise de l'Ontario'''). The company would remain a part of TVO until 2007, when it was transferred to the Ontario French-language Educational Communications Authority, a separate crown corporation. It is the only French-language television broadcaster in Canada headquartered outside Quebec.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/index3.html?url=http%3A//www.broadcasting-history.ca/programming/History_of_Educational_Broadcasting.html |title=History of Educational Broadcasting |accessdate=May 7, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508061357/http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/index3.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.broadcasting-history.ca%2Fprogramming%2FHistory_of_Educational_Broadcasting.html |archivedate=May 8, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://cartt.ca/article/tfo-break-away-tvo-april-1-ontario-government-announces |title=TFO to break away from TVO on April 1, Ontario government announces |date=March 23, 2007 |accessdate=May 7, 2014 |publisher=Cartt}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/tfo-to-be-stand-alone-french-network-1.656240 |publisher=CBC |title=TFO to be stand-alone French network |date=March 30, 2007 |accessdate=May 7, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.otelfo.org/historique/ |title=Historique |accessdate=May 7, 2014 |language=French |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508025453/http://www.otelfo.org/historique/ |archivedate=May 8, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nFor the first decade of La Cha\u00eene's operations, TVOntario's existing practice of broadcasting in French on Sundays continued, and La Cha\u00eene aired English-language programming during the same time block.

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations. Following high school graduation, she worked at a local bank before moving to southern California. It was on the west coast where she rediscovered country music. Originally a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs for the company as well. Many of these songs would be recorded by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a recording career. In Nashville, Seely's \"Don't Touch Me\" was released on [[Monument Records]] and was a major hit single. She followed it with several more hits, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nSeely started collaborating with [[Jack Greene]] in the late 1960s. The pair toured and had recordings together for several years. Their biggest single would be 1970's \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\". Seely had solo success during this same time with \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely took a more diverse career approach in the years following her accident. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'', which included duets with several artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that fused [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of a weekly radio program on [[Sirius XM]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Trust Company.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The original Titusville Trust Company building.

Irene Seely was a homemaker who also enjoyed singing with her children while cooking.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} As a young child, family and friends often gathered together to perform. \"It seemed like everybody back in the country played guitars and fiddles, and when we got together there was always pickin\u2018 and singin\u2018,\" Seely recalled.{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|p=1}} She developed an interest in [[country music]] during her early years. On Saturday nights, the Seely family would spent time listening to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in her parents' car.

At the park, the family often watched performances by country artists such as [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jean Shepard]].{{sfn|Harman, Ron|Seely, Jeannie|2002|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nAt age 11, she started performing on a local radio station, located in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]].

Developing an early interest in country music, she performed regularly on local radio and television stations. Following high school graduation, she worked at a local bank before moving to southern California. It was on the west coast where she rediscovered country music. Originally a secretary at [[Imperial Records]], she soon was writing songs for the company as well. Many of these songs would be recorded by other artists. In 1965, she signed her own recording contract with [[Challenge Records (1950s-60s label)|Challenge Records]]. Seely then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to pursue a recording career. In Nashville, Seely's \"Don't Touch Me\" was released on [[Monument Records]] and was a major hit single. She followed it with several more hits, including \"[[A Wanderin' Man]]\" (1967) and \"[[I'll Love You More (Than You'll Need)]]\" (1968). \n\nSeely started collaborating with [[Jack Greene]] in the late 1960s. The pair toured and had recordings together for several years. Their biggest single would be 1970's \"[[Wish I Didn't Have to Miss You]]\". Seely had solo success during this same time with \"[[Can I Sleep in Your Arms]]\" (1973) and \"[[Lucky Ladies]]\" (1974). In 1977, Seely's career went on hiatus after sustaining severe injuries in an automobile accident. With the support of others, she resumed her career. Seely took a more diverse career approach in the years following her accident. She appeared in the [[Willie Nelson]] film ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (film)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'', acted in several stage plays and performed in concert regularly. During this period, Seely also became the first female artist to host the Grand Ole Opry. In addition, she released her first and only book to date, ''Pieces of a Puzzled Mind''.\n\nIn the 1990s, Seely returned to recording albums. This was launched with a 1990 eponymous release, followed by her first album of [[holiday music]] in 1994 called ''Number One Christmas''. In 1999, she released the studio album ''Been There Sung That'', which included duets with several artists. In 2003, Seely issued ''Life's Highway'', a studio album that fused [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] with traditional country music. Her most recent studio release was 2017's ''[[Written in Song]]'', which was issued on her own record label. Seely has since been a consistent host of the Grand Ole Opry and has been a regular host of a weekly radio program on [[Sirius XM]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Titusville Trust Company.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The original Titusville Trust Company building.

He was the wealthiest and most powerful peer of the realm. The son and heir of [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster]], and [[Maud Chaworth]], he became one of King [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]'s most trusted captains in the early phases of the [[Hundred Years' War (1337\u20131360)|Hundred Years' War]] and distinguished himself with victory in the [[Battle of Auberoche]]. He was a founding member and the second Knight of the [[Order of the Garter]] in 1348, and in 1351 was created [[Duke of Lancaster]]. An intelligent and reflective man, Grosmont taught himself to write and was the author of the book ''Livre de seyntz medicines'', a highly personal devotional treatise. He is remembered as one of the founders and early patrons of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], which was established by two guilds of the town in 1352.\n\n==Origins==\nHenry of Grosmont{{#tag:ref|In his early years Henry was known, as was customary at the time, after his birthplace, Grosmont.{{sfn|Fowler|1969|p=23}}|group=note}} was the only son of [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster]] (c. 1281\u20131345); who in turn was the younger brother and heir of [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster]] (c. 1278\u20131322). They were sons of [[Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster]] (1245\u20131296); the second son of King Henry III (ruled 1216\u20131272) and younger brother of King [[Edward I of England]] (ruled 1272\u20131307). Henry of Grosmont was thus a first cousin once removed of King Edward II and a second cousin of King Edward III (ruled 1327\u20131377). His mother was [[Maud Chaworth|Maud de Chaworth]] (1282\u20131322).{{sfn|Fowler|1969|p=23}} On his mother's side Henry of Grosmont was also the great-grandson of [[Louis VIII of France]].{{sfn|Dunbabin|2014|p=244}} Little is known of Grosmont's childhood and youth; the year and place of his birth are not known with certainty. He is believed to have been born in about 1310 at [[Grosmont Castle]] in [[Grosmont, Monmouthshire|Grosmont]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]].{{sfn|Ormrod|2005|}} According to his own memoirs he was better at [[Historical European martial arts|martial arts]] than at academic subjects, and did not learn to read until later in life.{{sfn|Fowler|1969|p=26}}\n\nHenry of Grosmont was the eventual heir of his wealthy uncle [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster]], who through his marriage to Alice de Lacy, daughter and heiress of Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln, had become the wealthiest peer in England. Constant quarrels between Thomas and his first cousin, King [[Edward II of England]], led to his execution in 1322. Having no progeny, Thomas's possessions and titles went to his younger brother [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster]], Grosmont's father. Henry of Lancaster assented to the deposition of Edward II in 1327, but fell out of favour with the regency of his widow [[Isabella of France|Queen Isabella]] and [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]]. When [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], the son of Edward II, took personal control of the government in 1330, relations with the Crown improved, but by this time Henry of Lancaster was struggling with blindness and poor health.{{sfn|Waugh|2004}} In 1330 Grosmont was knighted, and represented his father in [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] and is known to have travelled a great deal between his father's estates, presumably supervising their management. In 1331 he participated in a royal [[Tournament (medieval)|tournament]] at [[Cheapside]] in the [[City of London]].{{sfn|Ormrod|2005|}}{{sfn|Fowler|1969|pp=27\u201328}}\n\n==Adult career==\n===Scotland===\nIn 1328 Edward III's regents had agreed to the [[Treaty of Northampton]] with [[Robert the Bruce|Robert Bruce]], King of Scotland ({{reign|1306|1329}}), but this was widely resented in England and commonly known as ''turpis pax'', \"the cowards' peace\". Some Scots nobles refused to swear [[fealty]] to Bruce, and were disinherited.

Robert Bruce died in 1329; his heir was 5-year-old [[David II of Scotland|David II]] ({{reign|1329|1371}}). In 1330 Edward III, who had recently assumed his full powers, made a formal request to the Scottish Crown to restore Beaumont's lands which was refused. In 1331 the disinherited Scottish nobles gathered in [[Yorkshire]], and led by Balliol and Beaumont plotted an invasion of Scotland. Edward III was aware of the scheme but turned a blind eye. Balliol's forces sailed for Scotland on 31 July 1332. Five days after landing in [[Fife]], Balliol's force of some 2,000 men met the Scottish army of 12,000\u201315,000 men and crushed them at the [[Battle of Dupplin Moor]].

Lancaster confesses to his sins, explains various real and mythical medical remedies in terms of their theological symbolism, and exhorts the reader to greater morality.{{sfn|Fowler|1969|pp=193\u2013196}}\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

He was a founding member and the second Knight of the [[Order of the Garter]] in 1348, and in 1351 was created [[Duke of Lancaster]]. An intelligent and reflective man, Grosmont taught himself to write and was the author of the book ''Livre de seyntz medicines'', a highly personal devotional treatise. He is remembered as one of the founders and early patrons of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], which was established by two guilds of the town in 1352.\n\n==Origins==\nHenry of Grosmont{{{{#tag:ref|In his early years Henry was known, as was customary at the time, after his birthplace, Grosmont.{{sfn|Fowler|1969|p=23}}|group=note}} was the only son of [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster]] (c. 1281\u20131345); who in turn was the younger brother and heir of [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster]] (c. 1278\u20131322). They were sons of [[Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster]] (1245\u20131296); the second son of King Henry III (ruled 1216\u20131272) and younger brother of King [[Edward I of England]] (ruled 1272\u20131307). Henry of Grosmont was thus a first cousin once removed of King Edward II and a second cousin of King Edward III (ruled 1327\u20131377). His mother was [[Maud Chaworth|Maud de Chaworth]] (1282\u20131322).{{sfn|Fowler|1969|p=23}} On his mother's side Henry of Grosmont was also the great-grandson of [[Louis VIII of France]].{{sfn|Dunbabin|2014|p=244}} Little is known of Grosmont's childhood and youth; the year and place of his birth are not known with certainty.

Constant quarrels between Thomas and his first cousin, King [[Edward II of England]], led to his execution in 1322. Having no progeny, Thomas's possessions and titles went to his younger brother [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster]], Grosmont's father. Henry of Lancaster assented to the deposition of Edward II in 1327, but fell out of favour with the regency of his widow [[Isabella of France|Queen Isabella]] and [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March|Roger Mortimer]]. When [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], the son of Edward II, took personal control of the government in 1330, relations with the Crown improved, but by this time Henry of Lancaster was struggling with blindness and poor health.{{sfn|Waugh|2004}} In 1330 Grosmont was knighted, and represented his father in [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] and is known to have travelled a great deal between his father's estates, presumably supervising their management.

Some Scots nobles refused to swear [[fealty]] to Bruce, and were disinherited. They left Scotland to join forces with [[Edward Balliol]], son of King [[John I of Scotland]] ({{reign|1292|1296}}),{{sfn|Weir|2006|p=314}} whom Edward I had deposed in 1296.{{Sfn|Nicholson|1961|p=19}} One of these was Grosmont's father-in-law, [[Henry de Beaumont]], [[Earl of Buchan]] and veteran campaigner of the [[First War of Scottish Independence]]. Robert Bruce died in 1329; his heir was 5-year-old [[David II of Scotland|David II]] ({{reign|1329|1371}}). In 1330 Edward III, who had recently assumed his full powers, made a formal request to the Scottish Crown to restore Beaumont's lands which was refused. In 1331 the disinherited Scottish nobles gathered in [[Yorkshire]], and led by Balliol and Beaumont plotted an invasion of Scotland. Edward III was aware of the scheme but turned a blind eye. Balliol's forces sailed for Scotland on 31 July 1332. Five days after landing in [[Fife]], Balliol's force of some 2,000 men met the Scottish army of 12,000\u201315,000 men and crushed them at the [[Battle of Dupplin Moor]]. Balliol was crowned king of Scotland at [[Scone, Scotland|Scone]] on 24 September 1332.{{Sfn|Nicholson|1961|p=19}} Balliol's support within Scotland was limited and within six months it had collapsed.

In December 1334 Grosmont accompanied Edward III to [[Roxburgh]] in Scotland. The English force of 4,000 accompanied little and withdrew in February. Grosmont was a member of Edward III's negotiation team when a brief truce was agreed shortly after at [[Nottingham]]. In July Grosmont accompanied Edward III on another invasion of Scotland, with an army of 13,000{{snd}}for the time an extremely large force. Scotland was quelled as far as [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] and Grosmont took a senior role in raiding deeper into the country.{{sfn|Fowler|1969|pp=31\u201332}} In 1336 Grosmont was given command of 500 [[men-at-arms]] and 1,000 [[English longbow|longbow]]men and marched to Perth.

It was here that a quarrel with Otto, Duke of Brunswick, almost led to a duel between the two men, narrowly averted by the intervention of King [[John II of France|John II]] of France.{{sfn|Fowler|1969|pp=106\u2013109}} In the later half of the decade campaigning in France resumed. After a [[Lancaster's chevauch\u00e9e of 1356|chevauch\u00e9e in Normandy in 1356]] and the [[Siege of Rennes (1356\u201357)]], Lancaster participated in the last great offensive of the first phase of the Hundred Years' War: the [[Rheims]] campaign of 1359\u20131360. Then he was appointed principal negotiator for the [[Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny]], where the English achieved very favourable terms.{{sfn|Ormrod|2005|}}\n\nBy the time he died in 1361 Henry had participated in 15 military missions, leading 6 of them; been the King's lieutenant 7 times; led 6 significant embassies; and taken part in 12 truce conferences.{{sfn|Fowler|1969|p=20}}\n\n==Death and burial==\n\nAfter returning to England in November 1360, he fell ill early the next year, and died at [[Leicester Castle]] on 23 March 1361. It is possible that the cause of death was the [[Bubonic plague|plague]], which that year was making a second visitation to England.{{sfn|Fowler|1969|pp=217\u2013218}}{{efn|Mortimer argues against plague being the cause of death, as\n* Henry made his will ten days before his death, a space of time inconsistent with the usual swift progress of the plague;\n* his illness and death in early 1361 is inconsistent with the spread of plague in England being reported from about May 1361{{pb}}\n{{Fix|text=This is dependent on the date of death in March 1361 being a<br>New Style date. This needs clarification.}}|group=note}} \nHe was buried in the [[Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady of the Newarke]], Leicester, which he had built within the religious and charitable institution founded by his father next to Leicester Castle, and where he had reburied his father some years previously.{{sfn|Billson|1920|p=}}\n\n==Personal life==\nGrosmont's mother died when he was about 12, and at about age 18 he married [[Isabel of Beaumont]]; daughter of [[Henry de Beaumont]], [[Earl of Buchan]] and veteran campaigner of the [[First War of Scottish Independence]]. Grosmont and Elizebeth were to have  two daughters. The eldest was [[Maud, Countess of Leicester|Maud of Lancaster]] (4 April 1340 \u2013 10 April 1362), who married [[William I, Duke of Bavaria]] in 1352.{{sfn|Burke's|1973|p=196}} The younger was [[Blanche of Lancaster]] (25 March 1345/1347 \u2013 12 September 1368), who married her third cousin [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]] (1340\u20131399); the third of five surviving sons of King Edward III. Gaunt inherited Lancaster's possessions, and he was granted the ducal title the following year, but it was not until 1377, when the dying King Edward III was largely incapacitated, that he was able to recover the palatinate rights for the County of Lancaster. When Gaunt's son by Blanche, [[Henry IV of England|Henry of Bolingbroke]], usurped the crown in 1399 and became King Henry IV, the vast Lancaster inheritance, including the [[Honour of Bolingbroke]] and the [[Lordship of Bowland]], was merged with the Crown as the [[Duchy of Lancaster]].{{sfn|Brown|Summerson|2006}}\n\n==Character==\n\nMore is known about Lancaster's character than that of most of his contemporaries through his memoirs, the ''Livre de seyntz medicines'' (\"Book of the Holy Doctors\"), a highly personal treatise on matters of religion and piety, also containing details of historical interest. It reveals that Lancaster, at the age of 44 when he wrote the book in 1354, suffered from [[gout]].{{sfn|Ormrod|2005|}} The book is primarily a devotional work, organised around seven wounds which Henry claimed to have received, representing the [[seven deadly sins]]. Lancaster confesses to his sins, explains various real and mythical medical remedies in terms of their theological symbolism, and exhorts the reader to greater morality.{{sfn|Fowler|1969|pp=193\u2013196}}\n\n==Ancestors==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

Enshrined in Articles 15 and 16 of the Indian Constitution, it allows the Indian government to set quotas to ensure any \"socially and educationally backward classes of citizens\" is properly represented in public life.  It is intended to realise the promise of equality enshrined in the [[Constitution of India]].\n\nReservation is primarily given to 3 groups: [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes]], and [[Other Backward Classes]], abbreviated as SC, ST, and OBC respectively. These are groups that have faced social and economic discrimination in the past and/or the present and were severely underrepresented in public life.

These castes have hereditary professions considered impure by South Asian society, such as sewage cleaning, tannery, or washing clothes, and were thus considered ''polluted'' by other castes. They are subject to the practice of [[untouchability]], which takes the form of various social restrictions ranging from inability to touch other castes to inability to use the same water source or even live in the same area. Historically, and even now, they were barred from entering temples and other places of worship, and sometimes were not allowed to use the same roads. Today many of these castes, as well as following their traditional occupations, are also landless agricultural labourers. They are much more behind than all other castes on economic indicators like poverty or literacy. They make up around 220 million people, 17% of India's population.\n* The next group are the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribes]]. The definition of this group varies, but the criteria for a Scheduled Tribe \"indications of primitive traits, distinctive culture, geographical isolation, shyness of contact with the community at large, and backwardness.\" Most of these groups are considered [[Adivasi]]s, and the original inhabitants while others are nomadic tribes who were notified as \"criminal tribes\" under British rule. They range in modes of existence from subsistence agriculturalists who have had interaction between the outside world to hunter-gatherer groups still in the jungles. They have suffered from exploitation of their land by both ''zamindars'' and the British, and often the same social discrimination meted out to Dalits. However, in the Northeast, many of the tribals are relatively better-off and interact much more with the outside world. They are around 100 million people, around 8% of the population. Examples include the [[Boro people|Bodo]], [[Gondi people|Gondi]], [[Banjara]], and [[Santal people|Santal]].\n* The third main group are the [[Other Backward Class]]es. They were not originally in the reservation scheme, but during the premiership of Moraji Desai, the Mandal Commission studied all the communitiesin India to find what castes were \"backward\" compared to the general population. Based on 1931 census data, they estimated 52% of India's population belonged to castes that were \"backward\" due to various socioeconomic factors like wealth or jobs performed. The possibility for providing reservation to these people was allowed for in Article 15(4) and Article 16(4), which states the government can provide reservation to \"backward classes.\" Although the Centre maintains its own list of OBC's, comprising over 5,000 castes and subcastes, each state can create their own backward caste list for in-state reservations. Most OBCs are lower castes, were classfiied originally in the ''shudra'' varna, and have low ritual status. However, there are other castes in the OBC list who, although ritually low, are economically dominant and in many cases are the enforcers of the caste hierarchy, including some Brahmin groups. In some states there is a divide between backward castes, who face some socioeconomic disadvantage and most backward or extremely backward castes, who face a high amount of social discrimination barely above Dalits in their status. In fact, unlike Scheduled Castes, OBCs do not have to be Hindu and many states give benefits to some Muslim and Christian communities. This list is most subject to change since the criteria is not as stringent, making it a list added to often by politicians to please certain sections of their voters.\n\nThose who are not a member of these groups are lumped together in the General category, sometimes called the Open category. These are made up of mostly high castes who do not qualify for reservations: most communities in the Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya varnas. However, seats listed for general category can be taken by anyone irrespective of reservation status.\n\n==History==\n\n===Before independence===\nQuota systems favouring certain castes and other communities existed before [[Independence of India|independence]] in several areas of [[British India]]. Demands for various forms of positive discrimination had been made, for example, in 1882 and 1891.<ref name=\"ILI Law Review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ili.ac.in/pdf/article_2.pdf|title=Rethinking Reservation in Higher Education in India|last=Laskar|first=Mehbubul Hassan|publisher=ILI Law Review|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425081633/http://www.ili.ac.in/pdf/article_2.pdf|archivedate=25 April 2012 |pages=29\u201330}}</ref> [[Shahu of Kolhapur|Shahu]], the Maharaja of the [[princely state]] of [[Kolhapur State|Kolhapur]], introduced reservation in favour of non-[[Brahmin]] and backward classes, much of which came into force in 1902. He provided free education to everyone and opened several hostels to make it easier for them to receive it. He also tried to ensure that people thus educated were suitably employed, and he appealed both for a class-free India and the abolition of [[untouchability]]. His 1902 measures created 50 percent reservation for backward communities.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\nOn 16 September 1921, the first [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]] government passed the first Communal Government Order (G. O. # 613), thereby becoming the first elected body in the Indian legislative history to legislate reservations, which have since become standard across the country.\n\nThe [[British Raj]] introduced elements of reservation in the [[Indian Councils Act 1909|Government of India Act of 1909]] and there were many other measures put in place prior to independence.<ref name=\"ILI Law Review\" /> A significant one emerged from the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conference of June 1932]], when the  Prime Minister of Britain, [[Ramsay MacDonald]], proposed the [[Communal Award]], according to which separate representation was to be provided for [[Muslims]], [[Sikhs]], [[Indian Christians]], [[Anglo-Indians]], and [[Europeans]]. The depressed classes, roughly corresponding to the STs and SCs, were assigned a number of seats to be filled by election from constituencies in which only they could vote, although they could also vote in other seats. The proposal was controversial: [[Mahatma Gandhi]] fasted in protest against it but many among the depressed classes, including their leader, [[B. R. Ambedkar]], favoured it. After negotiations, Gandhi reached an agreement with Ambedkar to have a single Hindu electorate, with [[Dalits]] having seats reserved within it. Electorates for other religions, such as Islam and Sikhism, remained separate. This became known as the [[Poona Pact]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Transfer of Power in India |first=V.

Enshrined in Articles 15 and 16 of the Indian Constitution, it allows the Indian government to set quotas to ensure any \"socially and educationally backward classes of citizens\" is properly represented in public life.  It is intended to realise the promise of equality enshrined in the [[Constitution of India]].\n\nReservation is primarily given to 3 groups: [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes]], and [[Other Backward Classes]], abbreviated as SC, ST, and OBC respectively. These are groups that have faced social and economic discrimination in the past and/or the present and were severely underrepresented in public life. Today anyone whose forefathers belonged to ST/SC community gets the benefits of reservation irrespective of his socioeconomic status.\nOriginally reservation was only given to SCs and STs but was later extended to OBCs in 1987 after the implementation of the [[Mandal Commission]] report.\n\n\nIt is observed that even after 70 years of reservation the backward classes haven't been benefitted the way they should have been and reservation keeps getting extended after every 10 years. One of the major reasons for this is no income cap on ST/SC reservations unlike OBC and EWS reservations where there is an income cap so that once a person is benefitted by reservation and is capable of earning a livelihood, he is no longer entitled to reservation.\nAs there is no concept of creamy layer in ST/SC reservations, even the son, grandson and great grand son of any other class A officer gets the benefits of reservation who himself got reservation. So the benefits get siphoned off by the effluent ST/SC's and are not able to percolate to the lower strata. Even the supreme court has directed the central government to introduce creamy layer concept in ST/SC reservation, but this is not possible because of vote bank politics. So reservation is necessary in a country like India but rules for availing it should be changed for the overall development of people of backward classes.\n\n== Terms ==\nThere are several groups who get reservations in India.\n\n* The first are the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Castes]] These communities were variously seen as at the bottom or \"underneath\" the [[Caste system in India|caste system]] in South Asia, below even the ''Sudra'' varna. These castes have hereditary professions considered impure by South Asian society, such as sewage cleaning, tannery, or washing clothes, and were thus considered ''polluted'' by other castes. They are subject to the practice of [[untouchability]], which takes the form of various social restrictions ranging from inability to touch other castes to inability to use the same water source or even live in the same area. Historically, and even now, they were barred from entering temples and other places of worship, and sometimes were not allowed to use the same roads. Today many of these castes, as well as following their traditional occupations, are also landless agricultural labourers. They are much more behind than all other castes on economic indicators like poverty or literacy. They make up around 220 million people, 17% of India's population.\n* The next group are the [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribes]]. The definition of this group varies, but the criteria for a Scheduled Tribe \"indications of primitive traits, distinctive culture, geographical isolation, shyness of contact with the community at large, and backwardness.\" Most of these groups are considered [[Adivasi]]s, and the original inhabitants while others are nomadic tribes who were notified as \"criminal tribes\" under British rule. They range in modes of existence from subsistence agriculturalists who have had interaction between the outside world to hunter-gatherer groups still in the jungles. They have suffered from exploitation of their land by both ''zamindars'' and the British, and often the same social discrimination meted out to Dalits. However, in the Northeast, many of the tribals are relatively better-off and interact much more with the outside world. They are around 100 million people, around 8% of the population. Examples include the [[Boro people|Bodo]], [[Gondi people|Gondi]], [[Banjara]], and [[Santal people|Santal]].\n* The third main group are the [[Other Backward Class]]es. They were not originally in the reservation scheme, but during the premiership of Moraji Desai, the Mandal Commission studied all the communitiesin India to find what castes were \"backward\" compared to the general population. Based on 1931 census data, they estimated 52% of India's population belonged to castes that were \"backward\" due to various socioeconomic factors like wealth or jobs performed. The possibility for providing reservation to these people was allowed for in Article 15(4) and Article 16(4), which states the government can provide reservation to \"backward classes.\" Although the Centre maintains its own list of OBC's, comprising over 5,000 castes and subcastes, each state can create their own backward caste list for in-state reservations. Most OBCs are lower castes, were classfiied originally in the ''shudra'' varna, and have low ritual status. However, there are other castes in the OBC list who, although ritually low, are economically dominant and in many cases are the enforcers of the caste hierarchy, including some Brahmin groups. In some states there is a divide between backward castes, who face some socioeconomic disadvantage and most backward or extremely backward castes, who face a high amount of social discrimination barely above Dalits in their status. In fact, unlike Scheduled Castes, OBCs do not have to be Hindu and many states give benefits to some Muslim and Christian communities. This list is most subject to change since the criteria is not as stringent, making it a list added to often by politicians to please certain sections of their voters.\n\nThose who are not a member of these groups are lumped together in the General category, sometimes called the Open category. These are made up of mostly high castes who do not qualify for reservations: most communities in the Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya varnas. However, seats listed for general category can be taken by anyone irrespective of reservation status.\n\n==History==\n\n===Before independence===\nQuota systems favouring certain castes and other communities existed before [[Independence of India|independence]] in several areas of [[British India]]. Demands for various forms of positive discrimination had been made, for example, in 1882 and 1891.<ref name=\"ILI Law Review\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ili.ac.in/pdf/article_2.pdf|title=Rethinking Reservation in Higher Education in India|last=Laskar|first=Mehbubul Hassan|publisher=ILI Law Review|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425081633/http://www.ili.ac.in/pdf/article_2.pdf|archivedate=25 April 2012 |pages=29\u201330}}</ref> [[Shahu of Kolhapur|Shahu]], the Maharaja of the [[princely state]] of [[Kolhapur State|Kolhapur]], introduced reservation in favour of non-[[Brahmin]] and backward classes, much of which came into force in 1902. He provided free education to everyone and opened several hostels to make it easier for them to receive it. He also tried to ensure that people thus educated were suitably employed, and he appealed both for a class-free India and the abolition of [[untouchability]]. His 1902 measures created 50 percent reservation for backward communities.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\nOn 16 September 1921, the first [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]] government passed the first Communal Government Order (G. O. # 613), thereby becoming the first elected body in the Indian legislative history to legislate reservations, which have since become standard across the country.\n\nThe [[British Raj]] introduced elements of reservation in the [[Indian Councils Act 1909|Government of India Act of 1909]] and there were many other measures put in place prior to independence.<ref name=\"ILI Law Review\" /> A significant one emerged from the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conference of June 1932]], when the  Prime Minister of Britain, [[Ramsay MacDonald]], proposed the [[Communal Award]], according to which separate representation was to be provided for [[Muslims]], [[Sikhs]], [[Indian Christians]], [[Anglo-Indians]], and [[Europeans]]. The depressed classes, roughly corresponding to the STs and SCs, were assigned a number of seats to be filled by election from constituencies in which only they could vote, although they could also vote in other seats. The proposal was controversial: [[Mahatma Gandhi]] fasted in protest against it but many among the depressed classes, including their leader, [[B. R. Ambedkar]], favoured it. After negotiations, Gandhi reached an agreement with Ambedkar to have a single Hindu electorate, with [[Dalits]] having seats reserved within it. Electorates for other religions, such as Islam and Sikhism, remained separate. This became known as the [[Poona Pact]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Transfer of Power in India |first=V.

By the 14th century, the mountains behind the [[Gulf of Kotor]] were coming to be referred to as \"[[Montenegro]]\" ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: ''Crna Gora''; literally translates as \u201cBlack Mountain\u201d), and by the 15th century, the name was coming to increasingly replace the older name, [[Zeta]]. \n<ref name=\"Fine94\">{{cite book|author1=John V. A. Fine|title=The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest|year=1994|publisher=University of Michigan Press|p=532}}</ref> Since the end of the 17th century, Montenegro existed as a de facto independent country, first as a theocratic [[Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro|Prince-Bishopric]] (1694\u20131852), then as a secular [[Principality of Montenegro|Principality]] (1852\u20131910) and finally as a [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Kingdom]] (1910\u20131918). After the end of [[World War I]], Montenegro was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], thus losing its statehood. This led to a short-lived [[Christmas Uprising]] of 1919, between supporters of [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty]] and Montenegrin statehood and proponents of unification with Serbia and Yugoslavia under the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]]. After the World War II, Montenegro regained its political sovereignty, becoming one of the six constituent republics of the [[SFR Yugoslavia]], and Montenegro's sovereignty was recognised once again. A portion of Montenegrins declares as ethnic [[Serbs]], while a larger proportion of citizens of Montenegro identifies ethnically as Montenegrin, a division that was exacerbated with the fall of socialism. This division has deepened further since the movement for full Montenegrin independence from the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] began to gain ground in 1991, while full independence was regained after the [[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum|2006 referendum]].\n\nIn the 2011 census, around 280,000 or ''44.98%'' of the population of Montenegro identified themselves as ethnic Montenegrins, while around 180,000 or ''28.73%'' identified themselves as Serbs. The number of \"Montenegrins\", \"Serbs\" and \"Bosniaks\" fluctuates from census to census, not due to real demographic changes, but due to changes in how people self-identify nationally. According to the [[Demographic history of Serbia|Serbian 2011 census]], there are 38,527 ethnic Montenegrins in [[Serbia]], accounting for ''0.54%'' of its population. In addition, a significant number of Serbs in Serbia and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] are of Montenegrin ancestry, but exact numbers are difficult to assess \u2013 the inhabitants of Montenegro contributed greatly to the repopulation of a depopulated Serbia after two rebellions against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the early 19th century{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}. On 19 October 2007, Montenegro adopted a new Constitution which proclaimed [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] (a standardized variety of [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]) as the official language of Montenegro.\n\nThe term \"Montenegrins\" in a wider sense can also be used to denote all residents of Montenegro, regardless of their national and religious affiliation.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of Montenegro}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nSlavs settled in the Balkans during the 6th and 7th centuries. According to ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', there existed three Slavic polities on the territory of modern Montenegro: [[Duklja]], roughly corresponding to the southern half; [[Travunia]], the west; and [[Principality of Serbia (early medieval)|Principality of Serbia]], the north. Duklja emerged as an independent state during the 11th century, initially held by the [[Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty]], later to be incorporated into the state of the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]].\n\nBy forming the first country under the rule of [[\u010caslav|\u010caslav Klonimirovi\u0107]], with the centre in the old town of Ras, all these areas belong to Serbian territory by conquest. By strengthening of the coastal [[Duklja]] and the noble family of [[Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty|Vojislavljevi\u0107]], in the beginning of the 11th century, they took power from [[Vlastimirovi\u0107 dynasty|Vlastimirovic]] dynasty, and soon after that, in 1077, Prince [[Mihailo Vojislavljevi\u0107]] got the crown from the Pope and proclaimed the [[Kingdom of Duklja]], with the centre in the city of [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]].\n\nWith the descent of [[Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty]], nobleman [[Zavida|Zavid Vukanovi\u0107]], from Ribnica near Podgorica, a cousin of [[Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty|Vojislavljevi\u0107]] dynasty through a female line, gets four sons. His youngest son, [[Stefan Nemanja]], will later become the Grand Prince of the new Great [[Serbia]], and the founder of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] among all Serbs. He moves to the city of Ras, where he overthrows (and kills) his eldest brother, Tihomir, in 1169, and declares himself the Grand Prince of Ra\u0161ka. After his proclamation, the last Prince/King of Duklja, [[Mihailo Vojislavljevi\u0107]], dies, and [[Stefan Nemanja]] joins Duklja and [[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Ra\u0161ka]], and soon he returns the rest of the lands from the period of Prince [[\u010caslav|\u010caslav Klonimirovi\u0107]] and King [[Mihailo Vojislavljevi\u0107]]. From the reign of Stefan Nemanja to the fall of the Montenegrin medieval state, Duklja, by this time called Zeta, was a part of the united Great Serbia. Throughout the period of Nemanji\u0107 dynasty, [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family|Crnojevi\u0107 dynasty]] became a noble family, and later on the line of Crnojevi\u0107 was replaced by the family of [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family|Bal\u0161i\u0107i]], believed to be originating from France, who remain on the throne of the Zeta, by then known as Montenegro, until the fall of the Serbian state in 1459.\n\nThe region previously known as Duklja later became known as \"[[Zeta (crown land)|Zeta]]\". Between 1276 and 1309, Serbian queen [[Helen of Anjou]], the widow of the Serbian King [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]], ruled Zeta, where she built and restored several monasteries, most notably the Monastery of Saints Sergius and Bacchus (Sr\u0111 and Vakh) on the Bojana river below [[Shkod\u00ebr|Skadar (Shkod\u00ebr)]]. The Venetian name ''Montenegro'', meaning \"black mountain\" occurred for the first time in the charter of St. Nicholas' monastery in Vranjina, dating to 1296, during Jelena's reign. Under King [[Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin of Serbia|Stefan Milutin]] (reigned 1282-1321), at the beginning of the 14th century, the Archdiocese in Bar was the biggest feudal domain in Zeta.\n\nIn the late 14th century, southern Montenegro ([[Lordship of Zeta|Zeta]]) came under the rule of the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family]], then the [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family]], and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as ''Crna Gora'' ([[Venetian language|Venetian]]: ''{{lang|vec|monte negro}}''). In 1496, the Ottomans conquered Zeta and subsequently [[Sanjak of Montenegro|established a sanjak]] that was subordinated to the [[Sanjak of Scutari]]. Ottoman influence remained largely limited to urban areas, while various tribes in the highlands emerged as districts out of reach of the Ottomans. These tribes were at times united against the Ottomans, under the leadership of the [[Metropolitans of Montenegro]], the so-called \"prince-bishops\".\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Proclamation of the Kingdom of Montenegro.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]]]]\n[[File:Petar II Petrovic-Njegos.jpg|thumb|[[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]]]]\nWith the arrival of the Turks, because of the inaccessibility of the terrain, and because of the lack of interest of the Ottomans for the \"Montenegrin karst and fracture\"(inaccessible terrain), the tribes in Montenegro enjoyed more than autonomy, and less than independence, but even this did not prevent the Montenegrin tribes from raising various revolts against Turkish conquest . The people were divided into tribes, and shortly thereafter bloody accounts of \"brotherly\" tribes turned bloody. The most serious causes of these accidents were the lack of food in the then-Montenegro, and the few resources were left, were taken away by the Turks, and the conflicts were inevitable. At the beginning of the 18th century. From then on, to Prince [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Danilo Petrovic]], Montenegrins are under the theocratic rule of the [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107 dynasty]]. Due to the impossibility of approach, due to the terrain of Montenegro, Bishop [[Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar I Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] cursed the tribes he was ruling, using their piety to inspire unity, and thus attempted to prevent the further slaughter of the fraternal people. After his death in 1830, [[Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar of Cetinje]] was buried in the monastery of the in [[Cetinje Monastery|Cetinje]] and was proclaimed a saint.\n[[File:Flag of Montenegro (1852\u20131905).svg|thumb|Flag of [[Principality of Montenegro]] ]]\nHis adopted son [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] ruled from 1830 until 1851. It is recorded as one of the greatest educators of the Serbian people in general. He wrote one of the most important works of the romantic epoch \"[[The Mountain Wreath|Mountain Wreath]]\" (regarded as one of the artistic foundations of Serbian nationalism), and he was also credited with bringing the final look of a Montenegrin hat, which is decorated with a black frame and represents the crown, more precisely, sorrow for the slavery of the Serbian people under Ottoman yoke. The top of the cap is red, symbolising blood, where 5 golden threads are engraved, thought to signify 5 centuries of slavery under the Turks. Within these golden threads there is a \"Cross\" with four Cyrillic letters (scores) S, a variant of the Byzantine Palaiologos tetragrammic cross, sometimes referred to as the variant of the [[Serbian cross]].\n[[File:Flag of Montenegro (1905\u20131918).svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] ]]\nHe ruled as a Bishop, but he also stood firm to see that Montenegro must be modernised. He built schools, roads, raised the Church, expanded the capital of [[Cetinje]]. After his death and funeral, he was succeeded by his nephew Prince [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Danilo Petrovi\u0107]] who ruled as the first secular ruler, with the title of Knjaz. Since then, Knja\u017eevina (Principality) of Montenegro was no longer a Prince-Bishopric, but a secular monarchy. This led to the opinion of the Turkish court that this change can lead to a major change in Montenegro, and a desire for \"independence\". In 1852, [[Omar Pasha|Omer-pasha]] sent a large army against the Montenegrins. A small Montenegrin army led by Prince Danilo's brother, Duke (Vojvoda) [[Mirko Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Mirko]], defended 30 remaining fighters in the monastery of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], [[Ostrog Monastery|Ostrog]] for 9 days. This is taken as the greatest heroic force of the people in those areas. One year later, Omer-pasha again tried to conquer Montenegro, but with the great heroism of Vojvoda Mirko, the Montenegrins performed the greatest victory over the Ottomans in the new century, after which Montenegro gained essential autonomy, the highest degree to independence, and a few decades later, full independence. [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Prince Danilo]] dies in 1860, and Danilo's adoptive son came to the throne, biological son of Vojvoda [[Mirko Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Mirko]], [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nikola Petrovi\u0107]]. He remained remembered in Montenegro as the greatest ruler, owing in large part to the fact that he was the first modern-day King of Montenegro and that it was under him that Montenegro's independence had been recognised. He is of great importance for the Montenegrin people in general, because he has fought against the Ottomans in the territory of Montenegro, Herzegovina, and Bosnia, and the people often called him \"Emperor of the Heroes\". Immediately after coming to power, a [[Herzegovina uprising (1852\u201362)|war]] for the liberation of the Montenegrin people in [[Herzegovina]] started in 1862, in which [[Principality of Montenegro]] entered, but later it turned out that she entered extremely unprepared and soon after that peace was made. After returning from Russia, the then emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] enlightened him, and immediately upon his arrival he began to work hard for the urbanisation of the country. He revised the army completely, built many courts and schools, and Montenegro began to look like a European state. In 1876, with the [[Principality of Serbia]] and the [[Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty]], he started a war, in history known as \"[[Herzegovina uprising (1875\u20131877)|War for the Liberation of the Serbian People]]\".\n\nA couple of years before the war, Prince [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nikola Petrovi\u0107]] with the Serbian prince [[Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107]] made an alliance in Venice, where beside the military alliance, a contract was signed on the dynastic heritage of the new future unified joint state. It was said that the plan is for Serbia to go back to its historical borders ([[De Administrando Imperio|On the management of the Empire]]) from the [[Timok]] River to the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] peak. The Montenegrin federal unit would be an integral part of the new common state, and in it [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107 dynasty]] would have the title of the princes, while the [[Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty]] would wear a royal crown. The Montenegrins performed great victories, and by the end of the war at the [[Congress of Berlin|Berlin Congress]] in 1878, the Principality of Montenegro received recognized independence, and became an internationally recognized state. This act raised the then two Serbian states to the ranks of independence, and it meant encouragement for all Serbs to completely resist the Turkish occupation in all Serbian countries. After the war, [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Prince Nikola]] wrote all his famous works, and the most famous work is the folk anthem \"[[Onamo, 'namo!|Onamo' namo!]] \", According to many, the most beautiful Serbian song about Kosovo. In 1910, then Prince Nikola, with the permission of the great powers of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and [[Peter I of Serbia|King Peter]], proclaimed another Serbian kingdom in the Balkans: the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]]. The flag of the new state has become a flagrant national flag (a Serbian tricolor with the coat of arms of [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107-Njegos dynasty]]), while with the old flag, it is equally used in the people and the popular \"crusader\" flag of Montenegrins. Knjazevina (Principality) of Montenegro, with the address of Russia, announces the war on Japan. Naturally, the participation of Montenegrins in this war was more symbolic, as the gratitude of Montenegro to Russia for generous help. In the [[Balkan Wars]], the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] participated in the liberation battles in the [[old Serbia]] ([[Kosovo Vilayet|Kosovo]], [[Metohija]], and [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar|Ra\u0161ka]]) and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. Thus, a common border was established between the two new-age \"Serb\" states, and the dream of [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nikola]] about the liberation of the \"Serbian cradle\" (Kosovo) was realised. At the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]], Montenegro immediately declared war on [[Austria-Hungary]], after [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], but in 1916 it had to capitulate after all forces held a rally on the direction of Serbian withdrawal through Albania. After the passage of the Serbian government and the king, the crushed Montenegrin army sacrificed itself for the future of the Serbian state. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nikola]], already ill and in his late years, left his homeland. He went to [[France]], where he died.\n\nThe Montenegrins maintained their ''de-facto'' independence from the Ottoman Empire during the Ottoman's reign over most of the Balkan region (Bosnia, Serbia, Bulgaria, etc.). The Montenegrins were gathered around the Metropolitans of the Cetinje Metropolitanate, which led to further national awakening of the Montenegrins all around. The creation of a theocratic state and its advancement into a secular and independent country was even more evident in the late 15th and early 16th centuries.\n\nThe rule of the [[House of Petrovi\u0107]] in the 18th and 19th century unified the Montenegrins and established strong ties with Russia and later with Serbia (under Ottoman occupation), with occasional help from the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. That period was marked by numerous battles with Ottoman conquerors as well as by a firmer establishment of a self-governed principality.\n\nIn 1878, the [[Congress of Berlin]] recognised Montenegro as the 26th independent state in the world. Montenegro participated in the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912\u20131913, as well as in [[World War I]] on the side of the Allies.\n\n===Yugoslav era===\nAfter the liberation of the Serbian and other Yugoslav (South Slavic) peoples, the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] was proclaimed, but the \"Venetian Agreement\" between the then [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Prince Nikola]] and [[Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107|Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107]] was breached. With the unification with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], Montenegro was to have autonomy under the prince's dynasty [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]]. Due to this act, the Montenegrin public was divided on two sides. The first, majority party, better known as [[Whites (Montenegro)|Bjela\u0161i]] (\"The Whites\"), advocated unconditional unification with the Serbian Kingdom under the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty|Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]] dynasty, while [[Greens (Montenegro)|Zelena\u0161i]] (\"The Greens\"), in a minority, advocated a conditional union that would respect the Venice Treaty. In Podgorica on October 26, 1918, the [[Podgorica Assembly]] unanimously voted that Montenegro unconditionally unites with Serbia into Yugoslavia, without any autonomy. Due to this decision, the few Greens are persecuted, and their rebellion is suppressed in the coming years. In 1929, with the proclamation of the Zeta Banovina with its headquarters in Podgorica, the territory of the former Montenegro with eastern Herzegovina and Metohija gained autonomy in the form of banovina (province), and the ruler of the region became a ban, whom the king personally appoints. [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Aleksandar Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]] ordered the construction of a chapel in [[Lov\u0107en]] in 1925, and the remains of, as many would say, \"the wisest Serb\" Prince-Bishop [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] were transferred there in a grandiose ceremony. At the beginning of the Second World War, the army in the [[Zeta Banovina]] area made great success against the Italian occupation of the army, expelling the Italian army to [[Shkod\u00ebr|Shkodra]] in [[Albania]]. After the breakup of the Yugoslav state, Montenegro gets a puppet government led by [[Sekula Drljevi\u0107]], who will be expelled from the country later.\n\nMontenegro unconditionally joined Serbia on November 26, 1918 in a controversial decision of the [[Podgorica Assembly]], and soon afterwards became a part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]], later renamed [[Yugoslavia]]. A number of Montenegrin chieftains, disappointed by the effective disappearance of Montenegro, which they perceived to have resulted from political manipulation, rose up in arms during January 1919 in an uprising known as the [[Christmas Uprising|Christmas Rebellion]], which was crushed in a severe, comprehensive military campaign by 1922\u201323. Annexation of the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] on November 13, 1918 gained international recognition only at the Conference of Ambassadors in [[Paris]], held on July 13, 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orderofdanilo.org/en/family/index.htm|title=Interesting things about the royal order of Montenegro - Untitled|website=Orderofdanilo.org|accessdate=2017-08-19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516203805/http://www.orderofdanilo.org/en/family/index.htm|archivedate=2009-05-16}}</ref> In 1929 the newly renamed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] was reorganised into provinces (''banovine'') one of which, [[Zeta Banovina]], encompassed the old Kingdom of Montenegro and had [[Cetinje]] as its administrative centre.\n\nBetween the two world wars, the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] opposed the Yugoslav monarchy and its unification policy, and supported Montenegrin autonomy, gaining considerable support in Montenegro. During [[World War II]], many Montenegrins joined the [[Yugoslav partisans|Yugoslav partisan]] forces, although the portion joining the [[chetniks]] was also significant. One third of all officers in the partisan army were Montenegrins. They also gave a disproportionate number of highest-ranked party officials and generals. During WWII [[Italy]] occupied Montenegro (in 1941) and annexed to the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]] the area of Kotor, where there was a small Roman community (descendants from the populations of the renaissance-era [[Albania Veneta]]).\n\nWhen the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|second Yugoslavia]] was formed in 1945, the Communists who led the Partisans during the war formed the new r\u00e9gime. They recognised, sanctioned, and fostered a national identity of Montenegrins as a people distinct from the Serbs and other South Slavs. The number of people who were registered as Montenegrins in Montenegro was 90% in 1948; it had been dropping since, to 62% in 1991. With the rise of Serbian nationalism in the late 80's the number of citizens who declared themselves Montenegrin dropped sharply from 61.7%, in the 1991 census, to 43.16% in 2003. For a detailed overview of these trends, see the [[Demographic history of Montenegro]].\n\nAfter the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the official position of the Montenegrin assembly is: ''The Montenegrin nation is the purest ethnic group among the Serbs''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u0421\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b|first=\u0417\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430|date=2013-01-01|journal=Godi\u0161njak Pravnog Fakulteta U Banja Luci|volume=1|issue=35|pages=111|doi=10.7251/gpf1335111s|issn=2233-0429|title=\u041e \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0441\u0443 \u0418 \u041e\u0432\u043b\u0430\u0448\u045b\u0435\u045a\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0435 \u0421\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0423 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0438 1858 \u2013 1888|doi-access=free}}</ref> The Yugoslav state recognised Montenegrins as a separate nation, different from Serbs and other Slavs, and gave them their own statistical code at the 1948 population census, where about 90% of Montenegrin citizens declared themselves Montenegrin.\n\nDuring communism in the new SFRY, the flag of the SR of Montenegro was identical with the flag of the SR of Serbia, where it was a Serbian tricolour with a five-pointed star in the middle, while the Coat of Arms was a tower by the sea, surrounded by a wreath, wrapped with a Serbian tricolour. By introducing standards for the new Montenegrin nation, the people of Montenegro were confused, but it was explained that the Montenegrin nation was \"the purest among the Serbs\", and the entire people of Montenegro (predominantly the Orthodox part) expressed themselves as Montenegrin, not imagining it would later mean a separation from the Serb ethnic identity. The Serb identity in Montenegro is usually perceived as separate from the Serbian identity, considering the Serbs as a larger ethnic group separated into Serbians, Montenegrins, and others depending on the polity they come from.\n\nInitially, after the fall of Communism in the early 1990s, the idea of a distinct Montenegrin ethnic identity had been taken over by independence-minded Montenegrins. The ruling [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] (DPS) (rebranded Communist Party), led by Prime Minister [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] and President [[Momir Bulatovi\u0107]], was firmly allied with [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] throughout this period and opposed such movements.\n\nDuring the [[Bosnian War]] and [[Croatian War]] (1991\u20131995) Montenegro participated with its [[police]] and paramilitary forces in the attacks on [[Dubrovnik]] and Bosnian towns along with Serbian troops. It conducted persecutions against Bosniak refugees who were arrested by the Montenegrin police and transported to Serb camps in Fo\u010da, where they were executed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bosnjaci.net/aktuelno.php?id=4311|title=PORODICA NED\u017dIBA LOJE O NJEGOVOM HAP\u0160ENJU I DEPORTACIJI 1992.

Part of the army from the then SR of Montenegro is attacking Herzegovina and [[Dubrovnik]], and keeps Dubrovnik under [[Siege of Dubrovnik|siege]] for almost eight months. In this period, the Montenegrins have an old sense of national affiliation, and at a referendum almost 100% of the respondents who voted on the referendum declare that they want to stay in the new state the neighbourhood of Serbia and Montenegro, the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. During the siege of Dubrovnik, the Serbian (Montenegrin) paramilitary formation invents the saying: \"From [[Lov\u0107en]] a fairy salutes, where are you Serbian Dubrovnik!\" (''Serbian: \"\u0421\u0430 \u041b\u043e\u0432\u045b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435, \u0452\u0435 \u0441\u0438 \u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0414\u0443\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435!\"''), which has been taken many times as a verse with a negative connotation, because of the city being besieged for so much time. After the abolition of communism and the creation of a new state, the [[Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)|federal unit of the Republic of Montenegro]] receives a new flag and the coat-of-arms, where the flag was a classic Montenegrin national flag (a Serbian tricolour with blue colour), while the coat of arms of the Coat of Arms is taken from the historical emblem of [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107]]. Then, the great fighters for the joint [[Serbia and Montenegro|FRY]], [[Momir Bulatovi\u0107]] and [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]], together with [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], rule the state union. The paths of [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] and [[Momir Bulatovi\u0107]] diverge before the start of the NATO aggression against the [[Serbia and Montenegro|FRY]], and [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] begins to change attitudes drastically, starting first with the political attitudes and afterwards the national and religious. In 1997 a full-blown rift occurred within DPS, and \u0110ukanovi\u0107's faction won over Bulatovi\u0107's, who formed a new [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro]] (SNP). The DPS distanced itself from Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and gradually took over the independence idea from the [[Liberal Alliance of Montenegro]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro|SDP]], and has won all elections since. In the fall of 1999, shortly after the [[NATO]] bombing of Yugoslavia, the \u0110ukanovi\u0107-led Montenegrin leadership came out with a platform for the re-definition of relations within the federation that called for more Montenegrin involvement in the areas of defence and foreign policy, though the platform fell short of pushing for independence. After Milo\u0161evi\u0107's overthrow on October 5, 2000, \u0110ukanovi\u0107 for the first time came out in support of full independence. Montenegro started increasingly moving away from Serbia, and in 2003, the Parliament of Montenegro sought amendments to the Constitution. With these amendments, and the [[Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)|Federal Unit of Montenegro]] was allowed to call a referendum on independence, which took place on 21 May 2006.\n\nWhen the referendum was announced, independence was obtained by a narrow majority. However, the bar was set high in order to avoid any dispute after the vote, with the requirement for a 55% of votes in favour of independence. Since the proclamation of independence, the policy of making a new ethnic identity is even more intensified by official Montenegro, often used for political purposes, whereas the citizens still remain divided on the issue of ethnic identity.\n\n==Language==\n{{Main|Montenegrin language|Serbo-Croatian language}}\nMontenegrins speak [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], an [[Ijekavian]] variant of the [[Shtokavian dialect]] of the [[pluricentric]] [[Serbo-Croatian]] language. Neo-shtokavian Eastern-Herzegovinian sub-dialect is spoken in the North-West (largest city Nik\u0161i\u0107), and old shtokavian Zeta sub-dialect is spoken in the rest of Montenegro, including capital Podgorica and the Old Royal Capital of Cetinje, and eastern [[Sanjak]].\n\nThe Zeta dialect features additional sounds: a [[voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative]] ({{IPA|/\u0255/}}), [[voiced alveolo-palatal fricative]] *({{IPA|/\u0291/}}, (occurring in other jekavian dialects as well) and a [[voiced alveolar affricate]] ({{IPA|dz}}, shared with other old-\u0161tokavian dialects). Both sub-dialects are characterised by highly specific accents (shared with other old-\u0161tokavian dialects) and several \"hyper-ijekavisms\" (i.e. ''nijesam'', where the rest of shtokavian area uses ''nisam'') and \"hyper-[[iotation]]s\" (''\u0111evojka'' for ''djevojka'', ''\u0111eca'' for ''djeca'' etc.) (these features, especially the hyper-iotation, are more prominent in the Zeta sub-dialect), that are common in all Montenegrin vernaculars.\n\nOn the [[sociolinguistic]] level, the language has been classified as a dialect of [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croat]]. The Montenegrin constitution currently defines Montenegrin as the official language. Since the campaign for independence, a movement for recognition of the [[Montenegrin language]] as wholly separate from Serbian and other standard variants of Serbo-Croat (Bosnian, Croatian) has emerged, finding the basis for separate language identity mostly in the above-mentioned dialectal specifics. In the 2011 census, 42.88% of Montenegrin citizens stated that they speak the Serbian language, while 36.97% stated that they speak Montenegrin. Most of the young people under 18 in Montenegro, 39.23 percent, say they speak Montenegrin, while 37.47% call their mother tongue Serbian, as shown in the census held from 1 to 15 April 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/drustvo/vecina-mladih-do-18-godina-govori-crnogorskim-jezikom|title=Ve\u0107ina mladih do 18 godina govori crnogorskim jezikom|website=Vijesti.me|date=July 26, 2011|accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n{{further|Religion in Montenegro}}\nMost Montenegrins are [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]], predominantly belonging to the [[Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral]] of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] as well as its four other eparchies (dioceses) that are active in parts of Montenegro and neighbouring countries, namely the [[Eparchy of Budimlja and Nik\u0161i\u0107]], the [[Eparchy of Mile\u0161eva]], and the [[Eparchy of Zahumlje and Herzegovina]]. A very small minority are adherents of the non-canonical and unrecognised [[Montenegrin Orthodox Church]].\n\nAccording to the census of 2011, people that declared Montenegrin as their ethnicity declared the following religious identity: \n*[[Eastern Orthodox]]: 248,523 (88.7%)\n*[[Islam in Montenegro|Islam]]: 12,931 (4.6%)\n*[[Catholic Church in Montenegro|Catholic]]: 5,667 (2.0%)\n*[[Protestantism in Montenegro|Protestantism]]: 921 (0.3%)\n*[[Atheism]]/[[Agnosticism]]: 6,393 (2.3%)\n*Others: 5,883 (2.1%)\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Montenegro}}\n[[File:Montenegrin Herzegovinian costume.jpg|Male folk costume from Montenegro|thumb]]\nThe most important dimension of Montenegrins' culture is the [[ethic]]al ideal of ''\u010cojstvo i juna\u0161tvo'', roughly translated as \"Chivalry and Bravery\". Another result of its centuries-long [[warrior]] history, is the unwritten code of [[Chivalry]] that [[Marko Miljanov]], one of the most famous warriors in his time, tried to describe in his book ''Primjeri \u010dojstva i juna\u0161tva'' (Examples of Humanity and Bravery) at the end of 19th century. Its main principles stipulate that to deserve a true respect of its people, a warrior has to show virtues of [[integrity]], [[dignity]], [[humility]], [[self-sacrifice]] for the just cause if necessary, [[respect]] for others, and [[wiktionary:Rectitude|Rectitude]], along with the [[bravery]]. In the old days of battle, it resulted in Montenegrins fighting to the death, since being captured was considered the greatest [[shame]]. Miljanov defined the two characteristics in a maxim roughly translated as: \"Bravery is when I defend myself from the other, chivalry is when I defend the other from myself\" (''\"Juna\u0161tvo je kada sebe branim od drugoga, \u010dojstvo je kada drugoga branim od sebe\"'').\n\nThis ethos is still an important part of most Montenegrins' ethical belief system, and understanding it is essential in order to understand Montenegrin identity and self-perception. Most of extraordinary examples of Montenegrin conduct during its long history can be traced to the code.\n\nMontenegrins' long-standing history of fighting for independence is invariably linked with strong traditions of folk [[epic poetry]]. A prominent feature of Montenegrin culture is the [[gusle]], a one-stringed instrument played by a story-teller who sings or recites stories of heroes and battles in [[decasyllable|decasyllabic verse]]. These traditions are stronger in the northern parts of the country and are also shared with people in eastern [[Herzegovina]], western [[Serbia]], northern [[Albania]], and central [[Dalmatia]].\n\nOn the substratum of folk epic poetry, poets like [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]], widely considered the most one of the most brilliant Montenegrins and Southern Slavs in history, have created their own expression. Njego\u0161's epic book ''Gorski Vijenac'' (''[[The Mountain Wreath]]'') presents the central point of Montenegrin culture as struggle for freedom.\n\nOn the other hand, Adriatic cities like [[Herceg-Novi]], [[Kotor]], and [[Budva]] had strong trading and maritime traditions, and were more open for [[Venetian Republic|Venetian]], [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]], and other [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] influences. Possession of those cities often changed, but their population was basically a mixture of people with Orthodox and Catholic religions and traditions. These cities were incorporated into Montenegro only after the fall of Austria-Hungary. In those cities, stronger influences of medieval and renaissance [[architecture]], [[painting]], and [[lyric poetry]] can be found, and while the adherence to the principles of chivalry and bravery are part of their ethos they are usually less central than in the areas of \"old Montenegro\".\n\n==Anthropology==\nVlahovi\u0107 (2008) noted many [[Biological anthropology|anthropological studies]] which showed that Montenegrin people have strong [[Dinaric race|Dinaric]] type (with seaboard, central, Durmitor, mountain and other subtypes) autochthonous on the [[Dinaric Alps]] since the Mesolithic period. Dinaric peoples, including Montenegrins, are among the tallest people in the world. The type, particularly in Montenegro, is distinguished by brachiochepal shape, broad forehead, wide relief and strong face, wide jaw and noticeably flat notched head, while arms and legs are proportional to the body height. Hair is commonly of black color, with black or blue eyes.<ref name=\"VlahovicAnthro\">{{cite journal |last=Vlahovi\u0107 |first=Petar |title=Dinarski tip i njegovi varijeteti u Crnoj Gori |trans-title=Dinara type and its varieties in Montenegro |year=2008 |journal=Journal of the Anthropologycal Society of Serbia |volume=43 |pages=7\u201314 |issn=1820-7936}}</ref>\n\nAnthropologist [[Bo\u017eina Ivanovi\u0107]] considered that the development of the Montenegrin Dinaric variety was influenced by gracilisation and brachycephalisation; they have characteristics which were not found in other Slavic and non-Slavic European populations, nor morphological properties from paleo-anthropological series originating from the Slavic [[necropolis]] from other South Slavic area.

A. Fine|title=The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest|year=1994|publisher=University of Michigan Press|p=532}}</ref> Since the end of the 17th century, Montenegro existed as a de facto independent country, first as a theocratic [[Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro|Prince-Bishopric]] (1694\u20131852), then as a secular [[Principality of Montenegro|Principality]] (1852\u20131910) and finally as a [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Kingdom]] (1910\u20131918). After the end of [[World War I]], Montenegro was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], thus losing its statehood. This led to a short-lived [[Christmas Uprising]] of 1919, between supporters of [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty]] and Montenegrin statehood and proponents of unification with Serbia and Yugoslavia under the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]]. After the World War II, Montenegro regained its political sovereignty, becoming one of the six constituent republics of the [[SFR Yugoslavia]], and Montenegro's sovereignty was recognised once again. A portion of Montenegrins declares as ethnic [[Serbs]], while a larger proportion of citizens of Montenegro identifies ethnically as Montenegrin, a division that was exacerbated with the fall of socialism. This division has deepened further since the movement for full Montenegrin independence from the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] began to gain ground in 1991, while full independence was regained after the [[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum|2006 referendum]].\n\nIn the 2011 census, around 280,000 or ''44.98%'' of the population of Montenegro identified themselves as ethnic Montenegrins, while around 180,000 or ''28.73%'' identified themselves as Serbs. The number of \"Montenegrins\", \"Serbs\" and \"Bosniaks\" fluctuates from census to census, not due to real demographic changes, but due to changes in how people self-identify nationally. According to the [[Demographic history of Serbia|Serbian 2011 census]], there are 38,527 ethnic Montenegrins in [[Serbia]], accounting for ''0.54%'' of its population. In addition, a significant number of Serbs in Serbia and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] are of Montenegrin ancestry, but exact numbers are difficult to assess \u2013 the inhabitants of Montenegro contributed greatly to the repopulation of a depopulated Serbia after two rebellions against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the early 19th century{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}. On 19 October 2007, Montenegro adopted a new Constitution which proclaimed [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] (a standardized variety of [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]) as the official language of Montenegro.\n\nThe term \"Montenegrins\" in a wider sense can also be used to denote all residents of Montenegro, regardless of their national and religious affiliation.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of Montenegro}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\nSlavs settled in the Balkans during the 6th and 7th centuries. According to ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', there existed three Slavic polities on the territory of modern Montenegro: [[Duklja]], roughly corresponding to the southern half; [[Travunia]], the west; and [[Principality of Serbia (early medieval)|Principality of Serbia]], the north. Duklja emerged as an independent state during the 11th century, initially held by the [[Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty]], later to be incorporated into the state of the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]].\n\nBy forming the first country under the rule of [[\u010caslav|\u010caslav Klonimirovi\u0107]], with the centre in the old town of Ras, all these areas belong to Serbian territory by conquest. By strengthening of the coastal [[Duklja]] and the noble family of [[Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty|Vojislavljevi\u0107]], in the beginning of the 11th century, they took power from [[Vlastimirovi\u0107 dynasty|Vlastimirovic]] dynasty, and soon after that, in 1077, Prince [[Mihailo Vojislavljevi\u0107]] got the crown from the Pope and proclaimed the [[Kingdom of Duklja]], with the centre in the city of [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]].\n\nWith the descent of [[Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty]], nobleman [[Zavida|Zavid Vukanovi\u0107]], from Ribnica near Podgorica, a cousin of [[Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty|Vojislavljevi\u0107]] dynasty through a female line, gets four sons. His youngest son, [[Stefan Nemanja]], will later become the Grand Prince of the new Great [[Serbia]], and the founder of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] among all Serbs. He moves to the city of Ras, where he overthrows (and kills) his eldest brother, Tihomir, in 1169, and declares himself the Grand Prince of Ra\u0161ka. After his proclamation, the last Prince/King of Duklja, [[Mihailo Vojislavljevi\u0107]], dies, and [[Stefan Nemanja]] joins Duklja and [[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Ra\u0161ka]], and soon he returns the rest of the lands from the period of Prince [[\u010caslav|\u010caslav Klonimirovi\u0107]] and King [[Mihailo Vojislavljevi\u0107]]. From the reign of Stefan Nemanja to the fall of the Montenegrin medieval state, Duklja, by this time called Zeta, was a part of the united Great Serbia. Throughout the period of Nemanji\u0107 dynasty, [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family|Crnojevi\u0107 dynasty]] became a noble family, and later on the line of Crnojevi\u0107 was replaced by the family of [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family|Bal\u0161i\u0107i]], believed to be originating from France, who remain on the throne of the Zeta, by then known as Montenegro, until the fall of the Serbian state in 1459.\n\nThe region previously known as Duklja later became known as \"[[Zeta (crown land)|Zeta]]\". Between 1276 and 1309, Serbian queen [[Helen of Anjou]], the widow of the Serbian King [[Stefan Uro\u0161 I]], ruled Zeta, where she built and restored several monasteries, most notably the Monastery of Saints Sergius and Bacchus (Sr\u0111 and Vakh) on the Bojana river below [[Shkod\u00ebr|Skadar (Shkod\u00ebr)]]. The Venetian name ''Montenegro'', meaning \"black mountain\" occurred for the first time in the charter of St. Nicholas' monastery in Vranjina, dating to 1296, during Jelena's reign. Under King [[Stefan Uro\u0161 II Milutin of Serbia|Stefan Milutin]] (reigned 1282-1321), at the beginning of the 14th century, the Archdiocese in Bar was the biggest feudal domain in Zeta.\n\nIn the late 14th century, southern Montenegro ([[Lordship of Zeta|Zeta]]) came under the rule of the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family]], then the [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family]], and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as ''Crna Gora'' ([[Venetian language|Venetian]]: ''{{lang|vec|monte negro}}''). In 1496, the Ottomans conquered Zeta and subsequently [[Sanjak of Montenegro|established a sanjak]] that was subordinated to the [[Sanjak of Scutari]]. Ottoman influence remained largely limited to urban areas, while various tribes in the highlands emerged as districts out of reach of the Ottomans. These tribes were at times united against the Ottomans, under the leadership of the [[Metropolitans of Montenegro]], the so-called \"prince-bishops\".\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Proclamation of the Kingdom of Montenegro.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]]]]\n[[File:Petar II Petrovic-Njegos.jpg|thumb|[[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]]]]\nWith the arrival of the Turks, because of the inaccessibility of the terrain, and because of the lack of interest of the Ottomans for the \"Montenegrin karst and fracture\"(inaccessible terrain), the tribes in Montenegro enjoyed more than autonomy, and less than independence, but even this did not prevent the Montenegrin tribes from raising various revolts against Turkish conquest . The people were divided into tribes, and shortly thereafter bloody accounts of \"brotherly\" tribes turned bloody. The most serious causes of these accidents were the lack of food in the then-Montenegro, and the few resources were left, were taken away by the Turks, and the conflicts were inevitable. At the beginning of the 18th century. From then on, to Prince [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Danilo Petrovic]], Montenegrins are under the theocratic rule of the [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107 dynasty]]. Due to the impossibility of approach, due to the terrain of Montenegro, Bishop [[Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar I Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] cursed the tribes he was ruling, using their piety to inspire unity, and thus attempted to prevent the further slaughter of the fraternal people. After his death in 1830, [[Petar I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar of Cetinje]] was buried in the monastery of the in [[Cetinje Monastery|Cetinje]] and was proclaimed a saint.\n[[File:Flag of Montenegro (1852\u20131905).svg|thumb|Flag of [[Principality of Montenegro]] ]]\nHis adopted son [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] ruled from 1830 until 1851. It is recorded as one of the greatest educators of the Serbian people in general. He wrote one of the most important works of the romantic epoch \"[[The Mountain Wreath|Mountain Wreath]]\" (regarded as one of the artistic foundations of Serbian nationalism), and he was also credited with bringing the final look of a Montenegrin hat, which is decorated with a black frame and represents the crown, more precisely, sorrow for the slavery of the Serbian people under Ottoman yoke. The top of the cap is red, symbolising blood, where 5 golden threads are engraved, thought to signify 5 centuries of slavery under the Turks. Within these golden threads there is a \"Cross\" with four Cyrillic letters (scores) S, a variant of the Byzantine Palaiologos tetragrammic cross, sometimes referred to as the variant of the [[Serbian cross]].\n[[File:Flag of Montenegro (1905\u20131918).svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] ]]\nHe ruled as a Bishop, but he also stood firm to see that Montenegro must be modernised. He built schools, roads, raised the Church, expanded the capital of [[Cetinje]]. After his death and funeral, he was succeeded by his nephew Prince [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Danilo Petrovi\u0107]] who ruled as the first secular ruler, with the title of Knjaz. Since then, Knja\u017eevina (Principality) of Montenegro was no longer a Prince-Bishopric, but a secular monarchy. This led to the opinion of the Turkish court that this change can lead to a major change in Montenegro, and a desire for \"independence\". In 1852, [[Omar Pasha|Omer-pasha]] sent a large army against the Montenegrins. A small Montenegrin army led by Prince Danilo's brother, Duke (Vojvoda) [[Mirko Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Mirko]], defended 30 remaining fighters in the monastery of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], [[Ostrog Monastery|Ostrog]] for 9 days. This is taken as the greatest heroic force of the people in those areas. One year later, Omer-pasha again tried to conquer Montenegro, but with the great heroism of Vojvoda Mirko, the Montenegrins performed the greatest victory over the Ottomans in the new century, after which Montenegro gained essential autonomy, the highest degree to independence, and a few decades later, full independence. [[Danilo I, Prince of Montenegro|Prince Danilo]] dies in 1860, and Danilo's adoptive son came to the throne, biological son of Vojvoda [[Mirko Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Mirko]], [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nikola Petrovi\u0107]]. He remained remembered in Montenegro as the greatest ruler, owing in large part to the fact that he was the first modern-day King of Montenegro and that it was under him that Montenegro's independence had been recognised. He is of great importance for the Montenegrin people in general, because he has fought against the Ottomans in the territory of Montenegro, Herzegovina, and Bosnia, and the people often called him \"Emperor of the Heroes\". Immediately after coming to power, a [[Herzegovina uprising (1852\u201362)|war]] for the liberation of the Montenegrin people in [[Herzegovina]] started in 1862, in which [[Principality of Montenegro]] entered, but later it turned out that she entered extremely unprepared and soon after that peace was made. After returning from Russia, the then emperor [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] enlightened him, and immediately upon his arrival he began to work hard for the urbanisation of the country. He revised the army completely, built many courts and schools, and Montenegro began to look like a European state. In 1876, with the [[Principality of Serbia]] and the [[Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty]], he started a war, in history known as \"[[Herzegovina uprising (1875\u20131877)|War for the Liberation of the Serbian People]]\".\n\nA couple of years before the war, Prince [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nikola Petrovi\u0107]] with the Serbian prince [[Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107]] made an alliance in Venice, where beside the military alliance, a contract was signed on the dynastic heritage of the new future unified joint state. It was said that the plan is for Serbia to go back to its historical borders ([[De Administrando Imperio|On the management of the Empire]]) from the [[Timok]] River to the [[Una (Sava)|Una]] peak. The Montenegrin federal unit would be an integral part of the new common state, and in it [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107 dynasty]] would have the title of the princes, while the [[Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty]] would wear a royal crown. The Montenegrins performed great victories, and by the end of the war at the [[Congress of Berlin|Berlin Congress]] in 1878, the Principality of Montenegro received recognized independence, and became an internationally recognized state. This act raised the then two Serbian states to the ranks of independence, and it meant encouragement for all Serbs to completely resist the Turkish occupation in all Serbian countries. After the war, [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Prince Nikola]] wrote all his famous works, and the most famous work is the folk anthem \"[[Onamo, 'namo!|Onamo' namo!]] \", According to many, the most beautiful Serbian song about Kosovo. In 1910, then Prince Nikola, with the permission of the great powers of the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and [[Peter I of Serbia|King Peter]], proclaimed another Serbian kingdom in the Balkans: the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]]. The flag of the new state has become a flagrant national flag (a Serbian tricolor with the coat of arms of [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107-Njegos dynasty]]), while with the old flag, it is equally used in the people and the popular \"crusader\" flag of Montenegrins. Knjazevina (Principality) of Montenegro, with the address of Russia, announces the war on Japan. Naturally, the participation of Montenegrins in this war was more symbolic, as the gratitude of Montenegro to Russia for generous help. In the [[Balkan Wars]], the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] and the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] participated in the liberation battles in the [[old Serbia]] ([[Kosovo Vilayet|Kosovo]], [[Metohija]], and [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar|Ra\u0161ka]]) and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. Thus, a common border was established between the two new-age \"Serb\" states, and the dream of [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nikola]] about the liberation of the \"Serbian cradle\" (Kosovo) was realised. At the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]], Montenegro immediately declared war on [[Austria-Hungary]], after [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], but in 1916 it had to capitulate after all forces held a rally on the direction of Serbian withdrawal through Albania. After the passage of the Serbian government and the king, the crushed Montenegrin army sacrificed itself for the future of the Serbian state. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nikola]], already ill and in his late years, left his homeland. He went to [[France]], where he died.\n\nThe Montenegrins maintained their ''de-facto'' independence from the Ottoman Empire during the Ottoman's reign over most of the Balkan region (Bosnia, Serbia, Bulgaria, etc.). The Montenegrins were gathered around the Metropolitans of the Cetinje Metropolitanate, which led to further national awakening of the Montenegrins all around. The creation of a theocratic state and its advancement into a secular and independent country was even more evident in the late 15th and early 16th centuries.\n\nThe rule of the [[House of Petrovi\u0107]] in the 18th and 19th century unified the Montenegrins and established strong ties with Russia and later with Serbia (under Ottoman occupation), with occasional help from the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. That period was marked by numerous battles with Ottoman conquerors as well as by a firmer establishment of a self-governed principality.\n\nIn 1878, the [[Congress of Berlin]] recognised Montenegro as the 26th independent state in the world. Montenegro participated in the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912\u20131913, as well as in [[World War I]] on the side of the Allies.\n\n===Yugoslav era===\nAfter the liberation of the Serbian and other Yugoslav (South Slavic) peoples, the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] was proclaimed, but the \"Venetian Agreement\" between the then [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Prince Nikola]] and [[Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107|Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107]] was breached. With the unification with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]], Montenegro was to have autonomy under the prince's dynasty [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]]. Due to this act, the Montenegrin public was divided on two sides. The first, majority party, better known as [[Whites (Montenegro)|Bjela\u0161i]] (\"The Whites\"), advocated unconditional unification with the Serbian Kingdom under the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty|Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]] dynasty, while [[Greens (Montenegro)|Zelena\u0161i]] (\"The Greens\"), in a minority, advocated a conditional union that would respect the Venice Treaty. In Podgorica on October 26, 1918, the [[Podgorica Assembly]] unanimously voted that Montenegro unconditionally unites with Serbia into Yugoslavia, without any autonomy. Due to this decision, the few Greens are persecuted, and their rebellion is suppressed in the coming years. In 1929, with the proclamation of the Zeta Banovina with its headquarters in Podgorica, the territory of the former Montenegro with eastern Herzegovina and Metohija gained autonomy in the form of banovina (province), and the ruler of the region became a ban, whom the king personally appoints. [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Aleksandar Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]] ordered the construction of a chapel in [[Lov\u0107en]] in 1925, and the remains of, as many would say, \"the wisest Serb\" Prince-Bishop [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]] were transferred there in a grandiose ceremony. At the beginning of the Second World War, the army in the [[Zeta Banovina]] area made great success against the Italian occupation of the army, expelling the Italian army to [[Shkod\u00ebr|Shkodra]] in [[Albania]]. After the breakup of the Yugoslav state, Montenegro gets a puppet government led by [[Sekula Drljevi\u0107]], who will be expelled from the country later.\n\nMontenegro unconditionally joined Serbia on November 26, 1918 in a controversial decision of the [[Podgorica Assembly]], and soon afterwards became a part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]], later renamed [[Yugoslavia]]. A number of Montenegrin chieftains, disappointed by the effective disappearance of Montenegro, which they perceived to have resulted from political manipulation, rose up in arms during January 1919 in an uprising known as the [[Christmas Uprising|Christmas Rebellion]], which was crushed in a severe, comprehensive military campaign by 1922\u201323. Annexation of the [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] on November 13, 1918 gained international recognition only at the Conference of Ambassadors in [[Paris]], held on July 13, 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orderofdanilo.org/en/family/index.htm|title=Interesting things about the royal order of Montenegro - Untitled|website=Orderofdanilo.org|accessdate=2017-08-19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516203805/http://www.orderofdanilo.org/en/family/index.htm|archivedate=2009-05-16}}</ref> In 1929 the newly renamed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] was reorganised into provinces (''banovine'') one of which, [[Zeta Banovina]], encompassed the old Kingdom of Montenegro and had [[Cetinje]] as its administrative centre.\n\nBetween the two world wars, the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] opposed the Yugoslav monarchy and its unification policy, and supported Montenegrin autonomy, gaining considerable support in Montenegro. During [[World War II]], many Montenegrins joined the [[Yugoslav partisans|Yugoslav partisan]] forces, although the portion joining the [[chetniks]] was also significant. One third of all officers in the partisan army were Montenegrins. They also gave a disproportionate number of highest-ranked party officials and generals. During WWII [[Italy]] occupied Montenegro (in 1941) and annexed to the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]] the area of Kotor, where there was a small Roman community (descendants from the populations of the renaissance-era [[Albania Veneta]]).\n\nWhen the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|second Yugoslavia]] was formed in 1945, the Communists who led the Partisans during the war formed the new r\u00e9gime. They recognised, sanctioned, and fostered a national identity of Montenegrins as a people distinct from the Serbs and other South Slavs. The number of people who were registered as Montenegrins in Montenegro was 90% in 1948; it had been dropping since, to 62% in 1991. With the rise of Serbian nationalism in the late 80's the number of citizens who declared themselves Montenegrin dropped sharply from 61.7%, in the 1991 census, to 43.16% in 2003. For a detailed overview of these trends, see the [[Demographic history of Montenegro]].\n\nAfter the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the official position of the Montenegrin assembly is: ''The Montenegrin nation is the purest ethnic group among the Serbs''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=\u0421\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b|first=\u0417\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0430|date=2013-01-01|journal=Godi\u0161njak Pravnog Fakulteta U Banja Luci|volume=1|issue=35|pages=111|doi=10.7251/gpf1335111s|issn=2233-0429|title=\u041e \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0441\u0443 \u0418 \u041e\u0432\u043b\u0430\u0448\u045b\u0435\u045a\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0435 \u0421\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435 \u0423 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0438 1858 \u2013 1888|doi-access=free}}</ref> The Yugoslav state recognised Montenegrins as a separate nation, different from Serbs and other Slavs, and gave them their own statistical code at the 1948 population census, where about 90% of Montenegrin citizens declared themselves Montenegrin.\n\nDuring communism in the new SFRY, the flag of the SR of Montenegro was identical with the flag of the SR of Serbia, where it was a Serbian tricolour with a five-pointed star in the middle, while the Coat of Arms was a tower by the sea, surrounded by a wreath, wrapped with a Serbian tricolour. By introducing standards for the new Montenegrin nation, the people of Montenegro were confused, but it was explained that the Montenegrin nation was \"the purest among the Serbs\", and the entire people of Montenegro (predominantly the Orthodox part) expressed themselves as Montenegrin, not imagining it would later mean a separation from the Serb ethnic identity. The Serb identity in Montenegro is usually perceived as separate from the Serbian identity, considering the Serbs as a larger ethnic group separated into Serbians, Montenegrins, and others depending on the polity they come from.\n\nInitially, after the fall of Communism in the early 1990s, the idea of a distinct Montenegrin ethnic identity had been taken over by independence-minded Montenegrins. The ruling [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] (DPS) (rebranded Communist Party), led by Prime Minister [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] and President [[Momir Bulatovi\u0107]], was firmly allied with [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] throughout this period and opposed such movements.\n\nDuring the [[Bosnian War]] and [[Croatian War]] (1991\u20131995) Montenegro participated with its [[police]] and paramilitary forces in the attacks on [[Dubrovnik]] and Bosnian towns along with Serbian troops. It conducted persecutions against Bosniak refugees who were arrested by the Montenegrin police and transported to Serb camps in Fo\u010da, where they were executed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bosnjaci.net/aktuelno.php?id=4311|title=PORODICA NED\u017dIBA LOJE O NJEGOVOM HAP\u0160ENJU I DEPORTACIJI 1992.

Part of the army from the then SR of Montenegro is attacking Herzegovina and [[Dubrovnik]], and keeps Dubrovnik under [[Siege of Dubrovnik|siege]] for almost eight months. In this period, the Montenegrins have an old sense of national affiliation, and at a referendum almost 100% of the respondents who voted on the referendum declare that they want to stay in the new state the neighbourhood of Serbia and Montenegro, the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. During the siege of Dubrovnik, the Serbian (Montenegrin) paramilitary formation invents the saying: \"From [[Lov\u0107en]] a fairy salutes, where are you Serbian Dubrovnik!\" (''Serbian: \"\u0421\u0430 \u041b\u043e\u0432\u045b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435, \u0452\u0435 \u0441\u0438 \u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0414\u0443\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435!\"''), which has been taken many times as a verse with a negative connotation, because of the city being besieged for so much time. After the abolition of communism and the creation of a new state, the [[Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)|federal unit of the Republic of Montenegro]] receives a new flag and the coat-of-arms, where the flag was a classic Montenegrin national flag (a Serbian tricolour with blue colour), while the coat of arms of the Coat of Arms is taken from the historical emblem of [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107]]. Then, the great fighters for the joint [[Serbia and Montenegro|FRY]], [[Momir Bulatovi\u0107]] and [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]], together with [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], rule the state union. The paths of [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] and [[Momir Bulatovi\u0107]] diverge before the start of the NATO aggression against the [[Serbia and Montenegro|FRY]], and [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] begins to change attitudes drastically, starting first with the political attitudes and afterwards the national and religious. In 1997 a full-blown rift occurred within DPS, and \u0110ukanovi\u0107's faction won over Bulatovi\u0107's, who formed a new [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro]] (SNP). The DPS distanced itself from Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and gradually took over the independence idea from the [[Liberal Alliance of Montenegro]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro|SDP]], and has won all elections since. In the fall of 1999, shortly after the [[NATO]] bombing of Yugoslavia, the \u0110ukanovi\u0107-led Montenegrin leadership came out with a platform for the re-definition of relations within the federation that called for more Montenegrin involvement in the areas of defence and foreign policy, though the platform fell short of pushing for independence. After Milo\u0161evi\u0107's overthrow on October 5, 2000, \u0110ukanovi\u0107 for the first time came out in support of full independence. Montenegro started increasingly moving away from Serbia, and in 2003, the Parliament of Montenegro sought amendments to the Constitution. With these amendments, and the [[Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)|Federal Unit of Montenegro]] was allowed to call a referendum on independence, which took place on 21 May 2006.\n\nWhen the referendum was announced, independence was obtained by a narrow majority. However, the bar was set high in order to avoid any dispute after the vote, with the requirement for a 55% of votes in favour of independence. Since the proclamation of independence, the policy of making a new ethnic identity is even more intensified by official Montenegro, often used for political purposes, whereas the citizens still remain divided on the issue of ethnic identity.\n\n==Language==\n{{Main|Montenegrin language|Serbo-Croatian language}}\nMontenegrins speak [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], an [[Ijekavian]] variant of the [[Shtokavian dialect]] of the [[pluricentric]] [[Serbo-Croatian]] language. Neo-shtokavian Eastern-Herzegovinian sub-dialect is spoken in the North-West (largest city Nik\u0161i\u0107), and old shtokavian Zeta sub-dialect is spoken in the rest of Montenegro, including capital Podgorica and the Old Royal Capital of Cetinje, and eastern [[Sanjak]].\n\nThe Zeta dialect features additional sounds: a [[voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative]] ({{IPA|/\u0255/}}), [[voiced alveolo-palatal fricative]] *({{IPA|/\u0291/}}, (occurring in other jekavian dialects as well) and a [[voiced alveolar affricate]] ({{IPA|dz}}, shared with other old-\u0161tokavian dialects). Both sub-dialects are characterised by highly specific accents (shared with other old-\u0161tokavian dialects) and several \"hyper-ijekavisms\" (i.e. ''nijesam'', where the rest of shtokavian area uses ''nisam'') and \"hyper-[[iotation]]s\" (''\u0111evojka'' for ''djevojka'', ''\u0111eca'' for ''djeca'' etc.) (these features, especially the hyper-iotation, are more prominent in the Zeta sub-dialect), that are common in all Montenegrin vernaculars.\n\nOn the [[sociolinguistic]] level, the language has been classified as a dialect of [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croat]]. The Montenegrin constitution currently defines Montenegrin as the official language. Since the campaign for independence, a movement for recognition of the [[Montenegrin language]] as wholly separate from Serbian and other standard variants of Serbo-Croat (Bosnian, Croatian) has emerged, finding the basis for separate language identity mostly in the above-mentioned dialectal specifics. In the 2011 census, 42.88% of Montenegrin citizens stated that they speak the Serbian language, while 36.97% stated that they speak Montenegrin. Most of the young people under 18 in Montenegro, 39.23 percent, say they speak Montenegrin, while 37.47% call their mother tongue Serbian, as shown in the census held from 1 to 15 April 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/drustvo/vecina-mladih-do-18-godina-govori-crnogorskim-jezikom|title=Ve\u0107ina mladih do 18 godina govori crnogorskim jezikom|website=Vijesti.me|date=July 26, 2011|accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n{{further|Religion in Montenegro}}\nMost Montenegrins are [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]], predominantly belonging to the [[Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral]] of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] as well as its four other eparchies (dioceses) that are active in parts of Montenegro and neighbouring countries, namely the [[Eparchy of Budimlja and Nik\u0161i\u0107]], the [[Eparchy of Mile\u0161eva]], and the [[Eparchy of Zahumlje and Herzegovina]]. A very small minority are adherents of the non-canonical and unrecognised [[Montenegrin Orthodox Church]].\n\nAccording to the census of 2011, people that declared Montenegrin as their ethnicity declared the following religious identity: \n*[[Eastern Orthodox]]: 248,523 (88.7%)\n*[[Islam in Montenegro|Islam]]: 12,931 (4.6%)\n*[[Catholic Church in Montenegro|Catholic]]: 5,667 (2.0%)\n*[[Protestantism in Montenegro|Protestantism]]: 921 (0.3%)\n*[[Atheism]]/[[Agnosticism]]: 6,393 (2.3%)\n*Others: 5,883 (2.1%)\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Montenegro}}\n[[File:Montenegrin Herzegovinian costume.jpg|Male folk costume from Montenegro|thumb]]\nThe most important dimension of Montenegrins' culture is the [[ethic]]al ideal of ''\u010cojstvo i juna\u0161tvo'', roughly translated as \"Chivalry and Bravery\". Another result of its centuries-long [[warrior]] history, is the unwritten code of [[Chivalry]] that [[Marko Miljanov]], one of the most famous warriors in his time, tried to describe in his book ''Primjeri \u010dojstva i juna\u0161tva'' (Examples of Humanity and Bravery) at the end of 19th century. Its main principles stipulate that to deserve a true respect of its people, a warrior has to show virtues of [[integrity]], [[dignity]], [[humility]], [[self-sacrifice]] for the just cause if necessary, [[respect]] for others, and [[wiktionary:Rectitude|Rectitude]], along with the [[bravery]]. In the old days of battle, it resulted in Montenegrins fighting to the death, since being captured was considered the greatest [[shame]]. Miljanov defined the two characteristics in a maxim roughly translated as: \"Bravery is when I defend myself from the other, chivalry is when I defend the other from myself\" (''\"Juna\u0161tvo je kada sebe branim od drugoga, \u010dojstvo je kada drugoga branim od sebe\"'').\n\nThis ethos is still an important part of most Montenegrins' ethical belief system, and understanding it is essential in order to understand Montenegrin identity and self-perception. Most of extraordinary examples of Montenegrin conduct during its long history can be traced to the code.\n\nMontenegrins' long-standing history of fighting for independence is invariably linked with strong traditions of folk [[epic poetry]]. A prominent feature of Montenegrin culture is the [[gusle]], a one-stringed instrument played by a story-teller who sings or recites stories of heroes and battles in [[decasyllable|decasyllabic verse]]. These traditions are stronger in the northern parts of the country and are also shared with people in eastern [[Herzegovina]], western [[Serbia]], northern [[Albania]], and central [[Dalmatia]].\n\nOn the substratum of folk epic poetry, poets like [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161]], widely considered the most one of the most brilliant Montenegrins and Southern Slavs in history, have created their own expression. Njego\u0161's epic book ''Gorski Vijenac'' (''[[The Mountain Wreath]]'') presents the central point of Montenegrin culture as struggle for freedom.\n\nOn the other hand, Adriatic cities like [[Herceg-Novi]], [[Kotor]], and [[Budva]] had strong trading and maritime traditions, and were more open for [[Venetian Republic|Venetian]], [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]], and other [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] influences. Possession of those cities often changed, but their population was basically a mixture of people with Orthodox and Catholic religions and traditions. These cities were incorporated into Montenegro only after the fall of Austria-Hungary. In those cities, stronger influences of medieval and renaissance [[architecture]], [[painting]], and [[lyric poetry]] can be found, and while the adherence to the principles of chivalry and bravery are part of their ethos they are usually less central than in the areas of \"old Montenegro\".\n\n==Anthropology==\nVlahovi\u0107 (2008) noted many [[Biological anthropology|anthropological studies]] which showed that Montenegrin people have strong [[Dinaric race|Dinaric]] type (with seaboard, central, Durmitor, mountain and other subtypes) autochthonous on the [[Dinaric Alps]] since the Mesolithic period. Dinaric peoples, including Montenegrins, are among the tallest people in the world. The type, particularly in Montenegro, is distinguished by brachiochepal shape, broad forehead, wide relief and strong face, wide jaw and noticeably flat notched head, while arms and legs are proportional to the body height. Hair is commonly of black color, with black or blue eyes.<ref name=\"VlahovicAnthro\">{{cite journal |last=Vlahovi\u0107 |first=Petar |title=Dinarski tip i njegovi varijeteti u Crnoj Gori |trans-title=Dinara type and its varieties in Montenegro |year=2008 |journal=Journal of the Anthropologycal Society of Serbia |volume=43 |pages=7\u201314 |issn=1820-7936}}</ref>\n\nAnthropologist [[Bo\u017eina Ivanovi\u0107]] considered that the development of the Montenegrin Dinaric variety was influenced by gracilisation and brachycephalisation; they have characteristics which were not found in other Slavic and non-Slavic European populations, nor morphological properties from paleo-anthropological series originating from the Slavic [[necropolis]] from other South Slavic area. Also, the brachycephalisation and width of the face in the last five centuries is growing in Montenegrin, while among other Slavic and European communities decreasing, showing anthropological issues in Montenegro have deeper roots and broader scientific importance.<ref name=\"VlahovicAnthro\"/> Montenegrin historian Dragoje \u017divkovi\u0107 (1989) noted that modern multidisciplinary research disagrees with older consideration how Sklavinias and Slavic states had ethnical identification, example Serb ethnos, until 12th century.{{sfn|\u017divkovi\u0107|1989|p=97, 103}} Slavs mixing with native population (in case of Komani culture necropolis in [[Puk\u00eb]]) made a new cultural-historical drift of Albanian-Illyrian and Slavic built upon extinct and present [[La T\u00e8ne culture|La T\u00e8ne]], Greek-Illyrian, Illyrian-Roman, and Byzantine.{{sfn|\u017divkovi\u0107|1989|p=94\u201395}} He argued that the Slavs from [[Duklja]] promptly blended in social-economical of the natives who historically had a more developed society, as was in their interest to approach the Roman-Illyrian natives.{{sfn|\u017divkovi\u0107|1989|p=96, 124}}\n\n[[Genetic genealogy|Genetic studies]] done in 2010 on 404 male individuals from Montenegro gave the following results: haplogroups [[Haplogroup I-M438|I2a]] ([[Prehistory of Southeastern Europe#Mesolithic|Mesolithic]]) and [[Haplogroup E-V68|E-V13]] ([[Neolithic Europe|Neolithic]]) make 60%, [[Haplogroup J-M172|J2]] (Neolithic) 9%, [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b]] 9.5%, while [[Haplogroup R1a|R1a]] accounted for 7.5%, with all others less than 5% each.{{sfn|Mirabal|2010|p=380\u2013390}}\n\n==Notable Montenegrins==\n{{main|List of Montenegrins}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Montenegrins of Albania|Montenegrins in Albania]]\n* [[Montenegrin American]]\n* [[Montenegrin Argentine]]\n* [[Montenegrin Australian]]\n* [[Montenegrins of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n* [[Montenegrin Canadian]]\n* [[Montenegrins of Croatia]]\n* [[Montenegrins in Germany]]\n* [[Montenegrins of Kosovo]]\n* [[Montenegrins of Serbia]]\n** [[Montenegrins of Vojvodina]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite journal |last=Mirabal |first=Sheyla |title=Human Y-Chromosome Short Tandem Repeats: A Tale of Acculturation and Migrations as Mechanisms for the Diffusion of Agriculture in the Balkan Peninsula |journal=[[American Journal of Physical Anthropology]] |date=July 2010 |pages=380\u2013390 |volume=142 |issue=3 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.21235 |display-authors=etal |ref=harv |pmid=20091845}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Ethnic Montenegrins|Montenegrins}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* [http://www.maticacrnogorska.me/home.html Matica crnogorska (official pages)]\n* [http://www.canu.me/en Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts (official pages)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/19961222045022/http://www.montenegro.org/ The Montenegrin Association of America]\n* [http://www.montenegrina.net/pages/pages1/antropologija/o_etnogenezi_crnogoraca.htm \u0160piro Kuli\u0161i\u0107: O Etnogenezi Crnogoraca (''On Ethnogenesis of Montenegrins'')] (in [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]])\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121230175735/http://www.portalanalitika.me/drustvo/tema/47188-stav-ko-iri-laibajke-o-porijeklu-crnogorskih-plemena-1-.html Article about Montenegrin tribes (in montenegrin language)]\n\n{{Montenegro topics}}\n{{Ethnic groups of Montenegro}}\n{{Slavic ethnic groups}}\n\n[[Category:Ethnic Montenegrin people| ]]\n[[Category:Slavic ethnic groups]]\n[[Category:South Slavs]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in the Balkans]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Montenegro]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Serbia]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Croatia]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]\n", "name_user": "SrpskiAnonimac", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegrins"}

His first NFL reception was a 34-yard touchdown throw from [[Chris Miller (American football)|Chris Miller]] at Atlanta on September 11, 1994. After that touchdown, when Bruce made a catch, the Rams fans yelled \u201cBruuuuuuce\u201d.\n\n===St. Louis Rams===\nHe moved with the team to St. Louis in 1995. In 1995, Bruce was named the NFC's week 1 Special Teams player of the Week after blocking a punt that contributed to a Rams win.

His total receiving yards for 1995 (119 catches for 1,781 yards) was second only to [[Jerry Rice]]\u2019s then record of 1,848 yards for one season, and is still the fifth most in a single season. In accomplishing this feat, Isaac Bruce surpassed former Houston Oilers WR [[Charley Hennigan]]\u2019s 34-year-old record of 1,746 set in 1961. Bruce\u2019s 119 catches also ranks 12th on the NFL\u2019s all-time single-season reception list. Bruce further broke four Rams\u2019 records, including most receiving yards, most receptions, most consecutive 100-yard receiving games (6) and most 100-yard games (9). Bruce made [[USA Today]]\u2019s All-Joe team, [[John Madden (American football)#All-Madden|All-Madden]], and All-Pro by [[Sports Illustrated]] and he was voted a first alternate to the Pro Bowl. He was also awarded the [[St Louis Rams awards#Daniel F. Reeves Memorial Award|Rams MVP]].\n\nIn 1996, Bruce led his team with 84 receptions and led the NFL with 1,338 yards. He became the first Rams receiver since Henry Ellard in 1990 and 1991 to post back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons. Against the [[Baltimore Ravens]] on October 27, 1996, he caught 11 passes for 229 yards and a touchdown. On November 30, 1996, Bruce was re-signed by the Rams to a 4-year $12.1 million contract extension.<ref>[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]], November 28, 1996</ref> In 1996 Bruce was also voted to his first Pro Bowl, after having been an alternate the season before.\n\nIn the following seasons, Bruce was hampered by hamstring injuries. In 1997, he missed the first six games due to injury and in 1998 he missed the final nine games (he also missed two other games earlier in the season). In Atlanta on November 2, 1997, Bruce had another 200-yard game, totaling 10 catches, 233 yards and recording 2 touchdowns. Prior to his injury in 1998 in a home game against [[1998 Minnesota Vikings season|the Minnesota Vikings]], Bruce had 11 catches for 192 yards and an 80-yard touchdown.\n\nIn 1999, Bruce was a Second-team All-Pro and was voted to his second Pro Bowl. He caught 77 passes for 1,165 yards and 12 touchdowns as Rams had a 13\u20133 record and advanced to the Super Bowl. He also led Rams in receiving yards in the playoffs, with 317 yards on 13 catches with a team-high two touchdowns. Bruce caught [[Kurt Warner]]\u2019s 73-yard touchdown pass late in the fourth quarter of [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] to give the Rams a 23\u201316 lead, which turned out to be the game winner.\n\n[[File:Isaac Bruce 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Bruce with the Rams in 2007.]]\nPrior to the 2000 season, Bruce was re-signed by the Rams to a 7-year, $42 million contract extension.<ref>[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]], August 17, 1996</ref> In 2000 Bruce was again a Pro Bowler and caught 87 passes for 1,471 yards and 9 touchdowns. He became the first Rams receiver to earn back-to-back Pro Bowl invitations since Henry Ellard accomplished the feat for [[1988 Los Angeles Rams season|the 1988]] [[1989 Los Angeles Rams season|and 1989]] seasons. Bruce either led or was tied for the most receptions six times in 2000, led the team in receiving yards six times, and posted four 100-yard receiving games. That same year, Bruce and teammate [[Torry Holt]] became only the second WR duo from the same team to each gain over 1,400 yards in the same season (see [[Herman Moore]] and [[Brett Perriman]]).\n\nIn 2001, the Rams returned to the Super Bowl, losing to [[2001 New England Patriots season|the New England Patriots]], and Bruce made the Pro Bowl for the fourth time, becoming only the third receiver in franchise history to earn three consecutive Pro Bowl invitations ([[Elroy Hirsch]] 1951\u201353, [[Jim Phillips (American football)|Jim Phillips]] 1960\u201362). Bruce was voted offensive captain and became the franchise career leader in 100-yard receiving games (29), 1,000-yard seasons (5), and receiving touchdowns (56). He became just the second player in team history to post 500 career receptions vs. [[2001 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on October 14, 2001. He caught five passes for 56 yards against New England in [[Super Bowl XXXVI]].\n\nBruce became the Rams\u2019 all-time leader in receptions in 2002 while posting his fourth consecutive 1,000-yard receiving season. That year, he led the team with seven touchdown receptions, and ended the season with 79 receptions for 1,075 yards. On his 30th birthday, Bruce had three fumbles in a game. Luckily for Bruce, he scored a game-winning touchdown and the game is almost forgotten because of 34-34 tie between the Falcons and Steelers the same day.\n\nIn 2003, Bruce missed the 1,000 mark for the first time since 1998, finishing with 69 catches for 981 yards and 5 touchdowns, however, he became the Rams\u2019 all-time leader in receiving yards (10,461), passing his position coach [[Henry Ellard]] (9,761). That year Bruce made seven receptions for 116 yards in the NFC Divisional Playoff Game vs. Carolina on January 10, 2004, making him the only Rams player to have four career 100-yard postseason performances, breaking a tie with [[Tom Fears]].\n\nIn 2004, Bruce caught 89 passes (fifth in the NFC, eighth in the NFL) for 1,292 yards (fifth in the NFL). He started the season with four consecutive 100-yard receiving performances, the first player to accomplish this feat since Houston's Charley Hennigan in 1963. Bruce nabbed a team-high nine catches for 170 yards and one touchdown at Green Bay on November 29, 2004.\n\nWith the retirement of [[Jerry Rice]], Bruce entered 2005 as the NFL's active leader in career receiving yards; a foot injury caused him to miss 5 games, and he was passed by [[Marvin Harrison]] by the end of the season. Still, he became the 14th player in NFL history with 800 career receptions on December 11 at Minnesota.\n\nOn March 7, 2006, the Rams released Bruce rather than pay him a $1.5 million bonus;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/08/sports/football/nfl-salarycap-math-deals-full-of-funny-money.html|title=N.F.L.

He signed a 3-year, $1.75 million contract with the Rams on July 14, 1994. He earned the 1994 [[Los Angeles Rams awards#Carroll Rosenbloom Memorial Award|Carroll Rosenbloom Award]], given to the team rookie of the year. He was also voted Rams Rookie of the Year by Orange County Sports Association and the Southern California Sports Broadcasters Association. His first NFL reception was a 34-yard touchdown throw from [[Chris Miller (American football)|Chris Miller]] at Atlanta on September 11, 1994. After that touchdown, when Bruce made a catch, the Rams fans yelled \u201cBruuuuuuce\u201d.\n\n===St. Louis Rams===\nHe moved with the team to St. Louis in 1995. In 1995, Bruce was named the NFC's week 1 Special Teams player of the Week after blocking a punt that contributed to a Rams win. He was also the NFC Offensive Player of the Week for week 6 following a 10-catch, 191 yard, 2 TD performance. His total receiving yards for 1995 (119 catches for 1,781 yards) was second only to [[Jerry Rice]]\u2019s then record of 1,848 yards for one season, and is still the fifth most in a single season. In accomplishing this feat, Isaac Bruce surpassed former Houston Oilers WR [[Charley Hennigan]]\u2019s 34-year-old record of 1,746 set in 1961. Bruce\u2019s 119 catches also ranks 12th on the NFL\u2019s all-time single-season reception list. Bruce further broke four Rams\u2019 records, including most receiving yards, most receptions, most consecutive 100-yard receiving games (6) and most 100-yard games (9). Bruce made [[USA Today]]\u2019s All-Joe team, [[John Madden (American football)#All-Madden|All-Madden]], and All-Pro by [[Sports Illustrated]] and he was voted a first alternate to the Pro Bowl. He was also awarded the [[St Louis Rams awards#Daniel F. Reeves Memorial Award|Rams MVP]].\n\nIn 1996, Bruce led his team with 84 receptions and led the NFL with 1,338 yards. He became the first Rams receiver since Henry Ellard in 1990 and 1991 to post back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons. Against the [[Baltimore Ravens]] on October 27, 1996, he caught 11 passes for 229 yards and a touchdown. On November 30, 1996, Bruce was re-signed by the Rams to a 4-year $12.1 million contract extension.<ref>[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]], November 28, 1996</ref> In 1996 Bruce was also voted to his first Pro Bowl, after having been an alternate the season before.\n\nIn the following seasons, Bruce was hampered by hamstring injuries. In 1997, he missed the first six games due to injury and in 1998 he missed the final nine games (he also missed two other games earlier in the season). In Atlanta on November 2, 1997, Bruce had another 200-yard game, totaling 10 catches, 233 yards and recording 2 touchdowns. Prior to his injury in 1998 in a home game against [[1998 Minnesota Vikings season|the Minnesota Vikings]], Bruce had 11 catches for 192 yards and an 80-yard touchdown.\n\nIn 1999, Bruce was a First-team All-Pro and was voted to his second Pro Bowl. He caught 77 passes for 1,165 yards and 12 touchdowns as Rams had a 13\u20133 record and advanced to the Super Bowl. He also led Rams in receiving yards in the playoffs, with 317 yards on 13 catches with a team-high two touchdowns. Bruce caught [[Kurt Warner]]\u2019s 73-yard touchdown pass late in the fourth quarter of [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] to give the Rams a 23\u201316 lead, which turned out to be the game winner.\n\n[[File:Isaac Bruce 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Bruce with the Rams in 2007.]]\nPrior to the 2000 season, Bruce was re-signed by the Rams to a 7-year, $42 million contract extension.<ref>[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]], August 17, 1996</ref> In 2000 Bruce was again a Pro Bowler and caught 87 passes for 1,471 yards and 9 touchdowns. He became the first Rams receiver to earn back-to-back Pro Bowl invitations since Henry Ellard accomplished the feat for [[1988 Los Angeles Rams season|the 1988]] [[1989 Los Angeles Rams season|and 1989]] seasons. Bruce either led or was tied for the most receptions six times in 2000, led the team in receiving yards six times, and posted four 100-yard receiving games. That same year, Bruce and teammate [[Torry Holt]] became only the second WR duo from the same team to each gain over 1,400 yards in the same season (see [[Herman Moore]] and [[Brett Perriman]]).\n\nIn 2001, the Rams returned to the Super Bowl, losing to [[2001 New England Patriots season|the New England Patriots]], and Bruce made the Pro Bowl for the fourth time, becoming only the third receiver in franchise history to earn three consecutive Pro Bowl invitations ([[Elroy Hirsch]] 1951\u201353, [[Jim Phillips (American football)|Jim Phillips]] 1960\u201362). Bruce was voted offensive captain and became the franchise career leader in 100-yard receiving games (29), 1,000-yard seasons (5), and receiving touchdowns (56). He became just the second player in team history to post 500 career receptions vs. [[2001 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on October 14, 2001. He caught five passes for 56 yards against New England in [[Super Bowl XXXVI]].\n\nBruce became the Rams\u2019 all-time leader in receptions in 2002 while posting his fourth consecutive 1,000-yard receiving season. That year, he led the team with seven touchdown receptions, and ended the season with 79 receptions for 1,075 yards. On his 30th birthday, Bruce had three fumbles in a game. Luckily for Bruce, he scored a game-winning touchdown and the game is almost forgotten because of 34-34 tie between the Falcons and Steelers the same day.\n\nIn 2003, Bruce missed the 1,000 mark for the first time since 1998, finishing with 69 catches for 981 yards and 5 touchdowns, however, he became the Rams\u2019 all-time leader in receiving yards (10,461), passing his position coach [[Henry Ellard]] (9,761). That year Bruce made seven receptions for 116 yards in the NFC Divisional Playoff Game vs. Carolina on January 10, 2004, making him the only Rams player to have four career 100-yard postseason performances, breaking a tie with [[Tom Fears]].\n\nIn 2004, Bruce caught 89 passes (fifth in the NFC, eighth in the NFL) for 1,292 yards (fifth in the NFL). He started the season with four consecutive 100-yard receiving performances, the first player to accomplish this feat since Houston's Charley Hennigan in 1963. Bruce nabbed a team-high nine catches for 170 yards and one touchdown at Green Bay on November 29, 2004.\n\nWith the retirement of [[Jerry Rice]], Bruce entered 2005 as the NFL's active leader in career receiving yards; a foot injury caused him to miss 5 games, and he was passed by [[Marvin Harrison]] by the end of the season. Still, he became the 14th player in NFL history with 800 career receptions on December 11 at Minnesota.\n\nOn March 7, 2006, the Rams released Bruce rather than pay him a $1.5 million bonus;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/08/sports/football/nfl-salarycap-math-deals-full-of-funny-money.html|title=N.F.L.

Many obstructive diseases of the [[lung]] result from narrowing (obstruction) of the smaller bronchi and larger bronchioles, often because of excessive contraction of the smooth muscle itself. It is generally characterized by inflamed and easily collapsible airways, obstruction to airflow, problems exhaling and frequent medical clinic visits and hospitalizations. Types of obstructive lung disease include; [[asthma]], [[bronchiectasis]], [[bronchitis]] and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD).  Although COPD shares similar characteristics with all other obstructive lung diseases, such as the signs of [[coughing]] and [[wheezing]], they are distinct conditions in terms of disease onset, frequency of symptoms and reversibility of airway obstruction.<ref>National Asthma Education and Prevention Program.

The airways become inflamed and produce excess mucus and the muscles around the airways tighten making the airways narrower. Asthma is usually triggered by breathing in things in the air such as dust or pollen that produce an allergic reaction. It may be triggered by other things such as an [[upper respiratory tract infection]], cold air, exercise or smoke. Asthma is a common condition and affects over 300 million people around the world.<ref name = \"GINA\">{{cite web |url= http://www.ginasthma.com|title= GINA \u2013 the Global INitiative for Asthma |accessdate=2008-05-06 |format= |website= }}</ref>\nAsthma causes recurring episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning.\n* Exercise-Induced Asthma \u2014 is common in asthmatics, especially after participation in outdoor activities in cold weather.\n* Occupational Asthma \u2014 An estimated 2% to 5% of all asthma episodes may be caused by exposure to a specific sensitizing agent in the workplace.\n* Nocturnal Asthma \u2014 is a characteristic problem in poorly controlled asthma and is reported by more than two thirds of sub-optimally treated patients.\n\nA [[peak flow meter]] can record variations in the severity of asthma over time.

[[Asthma]] being a reversible obstruction of airways is often considered separately, but many COPD patients also have some degree of reversibility in their airways.\n\nIn COPD, there is an increase in [[airway resistance]], shown by a decrease in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) measured by [[spirometry]].  COPD is defined as a forced expiratory volume in 1 second divided by the forced vital capacity  (FEV1/FVC) that is less than 0.7 (or 70%).<ref name = \"GOLD\">{{cite web |url= http://www.goldcopd.com/|title= GOLD \u2013 the Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease|accessdate=2008-05-06 |format= |website= }}</ref> The residual volume, the volume of air left in the lungs following full expiration, is often increased in COPD, as is the total lung capacity, while the vital capacity remains relatively normal. The increased total lung capacity (hyperinflation) can result in the clinical feature of a  \"barrel chest\" \u2013 a chest with a large front-to-back diameter that occurs in some individuals with COPD. Hyperinflation can also be seen on a [[chest x-ray]] as a flattening of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]].\n\nThe most common cause of COPD is cigarette [[smoking]]. COPD is a gradually progressive condition and usually only develops after about 20 [[Pack year|pack-years]] of smoking. COPD may also be caused by breathing in other particles and gases.\n\nThe diagnosis of COPD is established through [[spirometry]] although other pulmonary function tests can be helpful.  A [[chest x-ray]] is often ordered to look for hyperinflation and rule out other lung conditions but the lung damage of COPD is not always visible on a [[chest x-ray]]. Emphysema, for example can only be seen on [[computed tomography|CT scan]].\n\nThe main form of long term management involves the use of [[Bronchodilator|inhaled bronchodilators]] (specifically [[Beta2-adrenergic agonist|beta agonists]] and [[anticholinergics]]) and inhaled [[Glucocorticoid|corticosteroids]]. Many patients eventually require [[Oxygen therapy|oxygen supplementation]] at home. In severe cases that are difficult to control, chronic treatment with oral [[Glucocorticoid|corticosteroids]] may be necessary, although this is fraught with significant side-effects.\n\nCOPD is generally irreversible although lung function can partially recover if the patient stops smoking.

[[Lung transplantation]] is also performed for severe COPD in carefully chosen cases.\n\n[[Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency]] is a fairly rare genetic condition that results in COPD (particularly emphysema) due to a lack of the antitrypsin protein which protects the fragile alveolar walls from protease enzymes released by [[Inflammation|inflammatory processes]].\n\n==Diagnosis==\nDiagnosis of obstructive disease requires several factors depending on the exact disease being diagnosed.  However one commonality between them is an [[FEV1/FVC ratio]] less than 0.7, i.e. the inability to exhale 70% of their breath within one second.\n\nFollowing is an overview of the main obstructive lung diseases. ''Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease'' is mainly a combination of chronic bronchitis and emphysema, but may be more or less overlapping with all conditions.<ref name=Kumar13-2/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

He was the plaintiff in the landmark 1803 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case ''[[Marbury v. Madison]]''.\n\n==Background==\nMarbury, son of William and Martha (Marlowe) Marbury, was born November 7, 1762 in [[Piscataway, Maryland]]. He spent most of his early life in Maryland around his home.\n\n==Career==\nMarbury became a [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] businessman and member of the [[Federalist Party]]. In an effort to prevent the incoming party from dismantling his Federalist Party-dominated government, Adams issued 42 judicial appointments, including Marbury's as [[Justice of the Peace]] in the [[District of Columbia]], on March 3, 1801, the day before he turned his government over to incoming President [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Marbury had actively campaigned for Adams (and against Jefferson) in the presidential election of 1800.<ref>David F. Forte, ''Marbury's Travail: Federalist Politics and William Marbury's Appointment as Justice of the Peace'', Catholic University Law Review, p. 402 Vol 45:349.</ref>  Jefferson refused to honor Adams' appointments on the grounds that Adams' paperwork had not been delivered to the proper offices before the change of administration had taken place.

He spent most of his early life in Maryland around his home.\n\n==Career==\nMarbury became a [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] businessman and member of the [[Federalist Party]]. In an effort to prevent the incoming party from dismantling his Federalist Party-dominated government, Adams issued 42 judicial appointments, including Marbury's as [[Justice of the Peace]] in the [[District of Columbia]], on March 3, 1801, the day before he turned his government over to incoming President [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Marbury had actively campaigned for Adams (and against Jefferson) in the presidential election of 1800.<ref>David F.
