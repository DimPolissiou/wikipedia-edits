''Comfort'' was positioned in proximity to [[Kuwait]], just off the coast of [[Saudi Arabia]] near [[Khafji]]. On 12 March 1991, ''Comfort'' was under way on her return trip home. She arrived in Baltimore on 15 April 1991. While deployed, ''Comfort'' traveled more than {{convert|30000|nmi|mi km|lk=in}} and consumed almost {{convert|3|e6U.S.gal|impgal L}} of fuel. More than 8,000 outpatients were seen, and 700 inpatients were admitted including four sailors injured in a high-pressure steam leak on {{USS|Iwo Jima|LPH-2|6}}. 337 surgical procedures were performed. Other notable benchmarks include: more than 2,100 safe helicopter activities; 7,000 prescriptions filled; 17,000 laboratory tests completed; 1,600 eyeglasses made; 800,000 meals served and 1,340 radiographic studies, including 141 [[CT scan]]s.\n{{-}}\n\n===Operation Sea Signal (1994)===\n{{Main|Operation Sea Signal}}\n''Comfort'' was ordered to activation to serve as migrant processing center for [[Haiti]]an migrants in 1994. During this mission, ''Comfort'' served as the first afloat migrant processing center. She set out for the Caribbean with a crew of 928 military and civilian personnel from various federal government and international agencies. On 16 June 1994 the first Haitian migrants were taken aboard. Over the months deployed, the population onboard swelled to 1,100. Shortly after, ''Comfort'' was ordered to discontinue processing and sailed for [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]], Cuba to drop off its remaining 400 migrants.\n{{-}}\n\n===Operation Uphold Democracy (1994)===\n{{Main|Operation Uphold Democracy}}\nOn 2 September 1994, ''Comfort'' was again directed to activate for an unprecedented second deployment.{{clarify|reason=no other hospital ship had been deployed twice?|date=April 2019}} ''Comfort'' was tasked to provide a 250-bed medically intensive patient capability for the 35,000 [[Cubans|Cuban]] and [[Haiti]]an migrants supported by Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. ''Comfort'' departed Naval Base Norfolk, Virginia, with a specially configured crew of 566 personnel. Following the diplomatic agreement reached between the United States and [[Haiti]], ''Comfort'' took up a position off [[Port-au-Prince]] ready to receive casualties that might result from the transfer of U.S. and allied forces ashore. From 16 September through 2 October 1994, ''Comfort'' personnel provided both medical and surgical support to U.S. and allied forces ashore and afloat, emergency humanitarian care to injured Haitian citizens, and participated in various aspects of the Civil Affairs Program in an effort to aid the rebuilding effort of the local healthcare system.

She set out for the Caribbean with a crew of 928 military and civilian personnel from various federal government and international agencies. On 16 June 1994 the first Haitian migrants were taken aboard. Over the months deployed, the population onboard swelled to 1,100.

''Comfort'' departed Naval Base Norfolk, Virginia, with a specially configured crew of 566 personnel. Following the diplomatic agreement reached between the United States and [[Haiti]], ''Comfort'' took up a position off [[Port-au-Prince]] ready to receive casualties that might result from the transfer of U.S. and allied forces ashore. From 16 September through 2 October 1994, ''Comfort'' personnel provided both medical and surgical support to U.S. and allied forces ashore and afloat, emergency humanitarian care to injured Haitian citizens, and participated in various aspects of the Civil Affairs Program in an effort to aid the rebuilding effort of the local healthcare system.

The missions objective was to offer valuable training to U.S. military personnel while promoting U.S. goodwill in the region. In all, the civilian and military medical team treated more than 98,000 patients, provided 386,000 patient encounters and performed 1,100 surgeries.\nThe embarked medical crew was made up of more than 500 military and [[non-governmental organization]] (Project Hope and Operation Smile) doctors, nurses, and healthcare professionals. Their primary focus was to support medical humanitarian assistance efforts ashore. A secondary mission was outpatient shipboard health service support.\nAlso supporting ''Comfort{{'}}s'' medical mission was a [[Seabee (US Navy)|SEABEE]] detachment from the East Coast-based Mobile Construction Battalion Maintenance Unit 202, which performed civic action repair and minor construction projects in the host countries.

They folded in 1994 after suddenly losing their ground. \n\n==History==\nIt is thought that the club were founded in [[1901 in football (soccer)|1901]] as '''Sholing Athletic''' and spent their early days playing in the [[Southampton Saturday Football League|Southampton League]]. In [[1919-20 in English football|1919\u201320]] Sholing won the Senior League title and the first of three successive Southampton Senior Cups. This saw them step up into the [[Hampshire League]] where they promptly won the East Division title. Playing in the County Division (later to become Division 1) Sholing soon settled and after finishing 6th and 5th they proudly won the [[Hampshire Senior Cup]] but after two tough seasons the club finished bottom and returned to the less demanding [[Southampton Saturday Football League|Southampton League]].\n\nNow known as simply '''Sholing''' the club soon re-established themselves as a force. The late Thirties were particularly successful times - in [[1937-38 in English football|1937\u201338]] they were Senior League champions and Hampshire Intermediate Cup winners, the following season saw them retain the title and win the Southampton Senior Cup.\n\nAfter World War II the club became known as '''Sholing Sports''' and returned to the [[Hampshire League]] in [[1946 in football (soccer)|1946]] when they were placed in Division 3 East. Back in county football, Sholing quickly settled and shortly after moving to their Birch Lawn home, they won promotion as champions in [[1952-53 in English football|1952\u201353]] before consolidating themselves in Division 2. After some promising seasons, Sholing were promoted to Division 1 in 1961-62 but struggled and dropped straight back down again, and were surprisingly relegated back to Division 3 in [[1964-65 in English football|1964\u201365]].\n\nThe 1970s saw Sholing Sports become a prominent force in the [[Hampshire League]]. In 1969-70 they were Division 3 East champions and in 1971\u201372 they finished runners-up in Division 2, winning promotion back to the top flight - and this time they were far better prepared. Sholing quickly became one of the top clubs in the league and began entering the national competitions, the [[FA Cup]] and [[FA Vase]]. They enjoyed several good runs in the latter competition.\n\nIn [[1973-74 in English football|1973\u201374]] Sholing won their first Division 1 title as well as the [[Hampshire Senior Cup]]. The club remained regular title contenders, finishing runners-up three times before the incredible 1982\u201383 season when they were deservedly League champions - and they completed a remarkable treble by also winning the Hampshire Senior and Russell Cotes Cup's. The following season saw Sholing retain the league title, but were beaten finalists in the Hampshire Senior Cup. In 1984-85, Sholing were league runners-up and Hampshire Senior Cup finalists, but did gain some compensation when they again won the Russell Cotes Cup.\n\nFor the 1986-87 campaign Sholing Sports became founder members of the newly formed [[Wessex League]], and enjoyed a steady debut season as they reached the finals of the Southampton Senior Cup and the inaugural League Cup. The next few years saw the club continue to hold their own but in a more professional environment their fortunes gradually declined - not helped in the early 1990s by increasing uncertainty over their Birch Lawn ground, caused mainly by financial problems at the adjacent Social Club. \n\nSholing Sports battled on until August 1993 when they were evicted from their ground - virtually on the eve of the new season and inevitably this unfortunately forced them to withdraw from the competition. The club continued to operate during the 1993-94 season with just an Under 18's side playing in the Hampshire Youth League but the search for a new home ground was unsuccessful and they inevitably folded.\n\n==Honours==\n*'''[[Hampshire League]] Division 1'''\n**Champions 1973/74, 1982/83 and 1983/84\n**Runners-up 1974/75, 1975/76, 1981/82 and 1984/85\n*'''[[Hampshire League]] Division

by some enthusiastic locals and the new '''Sholing Sports''' joined the [[Southampton Saturday Football League|Southampton League]]. Like their predecessors, they originally played at Mayfield Park and began clawing their way up through the Junior ranks. By 2009 they had reached the Senior section and were using the Royal Victoria Country Park in Netley for their home matches, but sadly after a tough 2010-11 season the club again ceased to exist.\n\nIn 2010, successful local rivals VTFC (Vosper Thornycroft) changed their name to [[Sholing FC]] in a bid to attract more local support but they are not connected in any way to Sholing Sports, who remain consigned to the history books and sorely missed.\n\n==Famous Players==\n\nOver the years many fine players appeared for Sholing Sports. In the early twenties two players moved on to professional clubs; [[Tom Parker (footballer, born 1897)|Tom Parker]] who progressed on to Southampton and the legendary Arsenal team of the thirties and also Sam Meston, who played for Southampton, Gillingham and Everton. Latterly, they had two former professionals as player-managers - [[Jack Gregory (footballer, born 1925)|Jack Gregory]] (former Southampton, Bournemouth and Leyton Orient) for the 1965-66 season, and also Tommy Hare (former Southampton and Luton Town) for the 1976-77 campaign.\n\n==References==\n*{{fchd | name=Sholing Sports (1) | id=SHOLINGS}}\n*{{fchd | name=Sholing Sports (2) | id=SHOLINS2}}\n\n\n[[Category:Defunct football clubs in England]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 1901]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 1994]]\n[[Category:1901 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:1994 disestablishments in England]]\n[[Category:2005 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 2005]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 2011]]\n[[Category:2011 disestablishments in England]]\n[[Category:Defunct football clubs in Hampshire]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox football club\n|clubname    = Sholing Sports\n|image    = Sholing_Sports_F.C.jpg\n|fullname    = Sholing Sports Football Club\n|nickname    = \n|founded     = 1901 (as Sholing Athletic)\n|dissolved   = 1994\n|ground      = Birch Lawn, <br>Sholing, [[Southampton]]\n|capacity    = 1,500\n|chairman    = \n|manager     = \n|league      = \n|season      = \n|position =  \n|pattern_la1=|pattern_b1=_blackstripes|pattern_ra1=|\n leftarm1=000000|body1=FFFFFF|rightarm1=000000|shorts1=000000|socks1=000000|\npattern_la2=|pattern_b2=|pattern_ra2=|\nleftarm2=3333FF|body2=3333FF|rightarm2=3333FF|shorts2=3333FF|socks2=3333FF|}}\n\n'''Sholing Sports''' were a long running Southampton based football team who for many years played with great success in the Hampshire and Wessex League's.

by some enthusiastic locals and the new '''Sholing Sports''' joined the [[Southampton Saturday Football League|Southampton League]]. Like their predecessors, they originally played at Mayfield Park and began clawing their way up through the Junior ranks. By 2009 they had reached the Senior section and were using the Royal Victoria Country Park in Netley for their home matches, but sadly after a tough 2010-11 season the club again ceased to exist.\n\nIn 2010, successful local rivals VTFC (Vosper Thornycroft) changed their name to [[Sholing FC]] in a bid to attract more local support but they are not connected in any way to Sholing Sports, who remain consigned to the history books and sorely missed.\n\n==Famous Players==\n\nOver the years many fine players appeared for Sholing Sports. In the early twenties two players moved on to professional clubs; [[Tom Parker (footballer, born 1897)|Tom Parker]] who progressed on to Southampton and the legendary Arsenal team of the thirties and also Sam Meston, who played for Southampton, Gillingham and Everton. Latterly, they had two former professionals as player-managers - [[Jack Gregory (footballer, born 1925)|Jack Gregory]] (former Southampton, Bournemouth and Leyton Orient) for the 1965-66 season, and also Tommy Hare (former Southampton and Luton Town) for the 1976-77 campaign.\n\n==References==\n*{{fchd | name=Sholing Sports (1) | id=SHOLINGS}}\n*{{fchd | name=Sholing Sports (2) | id=SHOLINS2}}\n\n\n[[Category:Defunct football clubs in England]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 1901]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 1994]]\n[[Category:1901 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:1994 disestablishments in England]]\n[[Category:2005 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs established in 2005]]\n[[Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 2011]]\n[[Category:2011 disestablishments in England]]\n[[Category:Defunct football clubs in Hampshire]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sholing_Sports_F.C."}
