Robotically-assisted surgery was developed to try to overcome the limitations of pre-existing [[minimally-invasive procedures|minimally-invasive surgical procedures]] and to enhance the capabilities of surgeons performing open surgery.\n\nIn the case of robotically-assisted minimally-invasive surgery, instead of directly moving the instruments, the surgeon uses one of two methods to administer the instruments. These include using a direct [[Remote manipulator|telemanipulator]] or through computer control. A telemanipulator is a remote manipulator that allows the surgeon to perform the normal movements associated with the surgery. The [[robotic arm]]s carry out those movements using [[robot end effector|end-effector]]s and [[manipulator (device)|manipulators]] to perform the actual surgery. In computer-controlled systems, the surgeon uses a computer to control the robotic arms and its end-effectors, though these systems can also still use telemanipulators for their input. One advantage of using the computerized method is that the surgeon does not have to be present, leading to the possibility for [[remote surgery]].\n\nRobotic surgery has been criticized for its expense, with the average costs in 2007 ranging from $5,607 to $45,914 per patient.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Barbash GI, Glied SA | title = New technology and health care costs--the case of robot-assisted surgery | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 363 | issue = 8 | pages = 701\u20134 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20818872 | doi = 10.1056/nejmp1006602 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/465fd6e50dc5c3c2583bc1d7a7b3b424e0101b9f }}</ref> This technique has not been approved for cancer surgery as of 2019 as the safety and usefulness is unclear.<ref>{{cite web | author = Center for Devices and Radiological Health |title=Safety Communications - Caution When Using Robotically-Assisted Surgical Devices in Women's Health including Mastectomy and Other Cancer-Related Surgeries: FDA Safety Communication |url=https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm632142.htm |website=www.fda.gov |access-date=6 March 2019 |language=en|quote=Understand that the FDA has not cleared or approved any robotically-assisted surgical device based on cancer-related outcomes such as overall survival, recurrence, and disease-free survival....

Robotically-assisted surgery was developed to try to overcome the limitations of pre-existing [[minimally-invasive procedures|minimally-invasive surgical procedures]] and to enhance the capabilities of surgeons performing open surgery.\n\nIn the case of robotically-assisted minimally-invasive surgery, instead of directly moving the instruments, the surgeon uses one of two methods to administer the instruments. These include using a direct [[Remote manipulator|telemanipulator]] or through computer control. A telemanipulator is a remote manipulator that allows the surgeon to perform the normal movements associated with the surgery. The [[robotic arm]]s carry out those movements using [[robot end effector|end-effector]]s and [[manipulator (device)|manipulators]] to perform the actual surgery. In computer-controlled systems, the surgeon uses a computer to control the robotic arms and its end-effectors, though these systems can also still use telemanipulators for their input. One advantage of using the computerized method is that the surgeon does not have to be present, leading to the possibility for [[remote surgery]].\n\nRobotic surgery has been criticized for its expense, with the average costs in 2007 ranging from $5,607 to $45,914 per patient.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Barbash GI, Glied SA | title = New technology and health care costs--the case of robot-assisted surgery | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 363 | issue = 8 | pages = 701\u20134 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20818872 | doi = 10.1056/nejmp1006602 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/465fd6e50dc5c3c2583bc1d7a7b3b424e0101b9f }}</ref> This technique has not been approved for cancer surgery as of 2019 as the safety and usefulness is unclear.<ref>{{cite web | author = Center for Devices and Radiological Health |title=Safety Communications - Caution When Using Robotically-Assisted Surgical Devices in Women's Health including Mastectomy and Other Cancer-Related Surgeries: FDA Safety Communication |url=https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/ucm632142.htm |website=www.fda.gov |access-date=6 March 2019 |language=en|quote=Understand that the FDA has not cleared or approved any robotically-assisted surgical device based on cancer-related outcomes such as overall survival, recurrence, and disease-free survival....

The film stars [[Ansel Elgort]], a young man whose life is transformed after his mother dies in a terrorist bombing at a museum, and he is convinced by an older man to take a famous painting called ''[[The Goldfinch (painting)|The Goldfinch]]'' from the museum. [[Oakes Fegley]], [[Aneurin Barnard]], [[Finn Wolfhard]], [[Sarah Paulson]], [[Luke Wilson]], [[Jeffrey Wright]], and [[Nicole Kidman]] appear in the film in supporting roles.\n\nFilm rights to the novel were sold to [[Warner Bros.]] and [[RatPac Entertainment]] with ICM Partners brokering the deal. Two years later, Crowley was hired to direct the film adaptation, and Elgort was selected to portray the lead role of Theodore Decker. Most of the remaining cast joined from October 2017 to January 2018. Filming began in [[New York City]] in January 2018 and then moved to [[Albuquerque]] in April 2018 for the rest of the production.\n\n''The Goldfinch'' premiered at the [[2019 Toronto International Film Festival]] and was theatrically released in the United States on September 13, 2019, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film received generally negative reviews from critics and was a [[box-office bomb]], with estimated losses for the studio as high as $50 million.\n\n==Plot==\nThirteen-year-old Theodore Decker's mother is killed in a bombing at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]]. In the aftermath of the bombing, Theo takes a painting after an older man tells him to, ''[[The Goldfinch (painting)|The Goldfinch]]'', one of the few remaining paintings by [[Carel Fabritius]], and hides it at his apartment. Theo is then placed with the Barbours, the family of his estranged friend Andy, as he has no other relatives in the city and his father has abandoned him.\n\nTheo reconnects with Andy and becomes close to Andy's mother, Samantha Barbour, who encourages his interest in her antiques and art. After Samantha finds an engraved ring in Theo's possession, he goes to visit the shop where it came from, Hobart & Blackwell. The shop is run by James \"Hobie\" Hobart, whose deceased partner Welton \"Welty\" Blackwell died in the bombing and gave the ring to Theo to return. Welty's niece, Pippa, was also at the museum and survived the bombing. Hobie allows Theo to visit Pippa, who has serious injuries, and the two bond. Theo begins to visit Hobie regularly, even after Pippa leaves to live with her aunt in Texas.\n\nTheo begins to settle into life with the Barbours and is invited to go on vacation with them as Andy is hinting that his parents are considering adopting him. Before they can, Theo's estranged and alcoholic father, Larry, newly detoxed, and his girlfriend Xandra arrive to reclaim Theo and relocate him to [[Las Vegas]]. One of the few items he takes with him is ''The Goldfinch'' painting.\n\nTheo makes a friend, Boris, a Ukrainian immigrant whose father is physically abusive. Boris, who has also lost his mother, introduces Theo to drugs and alcohol. Theo's father, sliding further into alcoholism and gambling, dies in a car accident. Theo decides to return to New York and promises to take care of Xandra's dog, Popper, for her. Theo begs Boris to come with him and Boris promises he will follow Theo, but never does. Theo goes to Hobie, who allows him to live with him.\n\nEight years after Theo returns to New York City, he runs into Platt, Andy's older brother. Platt informs Theo that his father was bipolar and that he and Andy were killed in a boating accident during one of his [[Mental breakdown|episodes]]. Theo goes to visit the now sickly Mrs. Barbour and reconnects with Andy's younger sister Kitsey, who flirts with him.\n\nTheo works selling restored antiques from Hobie's shop. A disgruntled art dealer accuses Theo of selling a fake, which Theo offers to buy back. However, the dealer believes that Theo possesses ''The Goldfinch'' painting and is using it as collateral to finance his shop. Theo is shocked that the man has made the connection between him and the painting, but is relieved that his guess as to its whereabouts is wrong as Theo continues to keep the wrapped painting in a storage locker.\n\nTheo becomes engaged to Kitsey, whom he does not love, still harboring a secret love for Pippa, who now lives in [[London]]. Theo catches Kitsey cheating on him, but decides to remain engaged due to his love for Mrs. Barbour and Kitsey's permissive attitude towards his drug habit.\n\nLooking to score pills one day, Theo goes to an unknown bar where he runs into Boris. The two reconnect, with Boris telling Theo that he owes everything to their friendship. Boris apologizes to Theo, which Theo initially believes is for never coming to New York City, but he then realizes is because Boris stole ''The Goldfinch'' years ago, after Theo showed it to him during a drug blackout. Ever since, Boris has used it to finance his life of crime. Boris is now no longer in possession of the painting, as a gang of thugs have stolen it. Theo is horrified and runs away from Boris.\n\nAt Theo's engagement party to Kitsey, Boris arrives and tells him he has a plan to recover ''The Goldfinch''. They fly to [[Amsterdam]], where Theo pretends to be a wealthy businessman, and they reclaim the painting. However, the plan goes badly, and Boris is shot. Theo kills a man in self-defense, losing the painting again.\n\nTheo goes to his hotel room and tries to commit suicide, only to be rescued by Boris. Boris tells Theo that, knowing where the painting is, he had a friend call in a tip to the police to recover it. After organizing a raid the police were able to safely recover the painting along with other lost and stolen art including a [[Rembrandt]]. Boris argues that perhaps their strange and unwieldy path was all for the greater good and that it is all part of the strange thing called life.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ansel Elgort]] as Theodore \"Theo\" Decker, Audrey and Larry's son.\n** [[Oakes Fegley]] as young Theo\n* [[Aneurin Barnard]] as Boris Pavlikovsky, a cosmopolitan son of a Ukrainian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who becomes Theo's close friend.\n** [[Finn Wolfhard]] as young Boris Pavlikovsky\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Samantha Barbour, Chance's wife and the seemingly chilly but kind and wealthy socialite mother of Platt, Kitsey and Andy who takes in the orphaned Theo.\n* [[Sarah Paulson]] as Xandra, a Las Vegas cocktail waitress and the girlfriend of Larry Decker.\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as Larry Decker, Theo's deadbeat father, Audrey's husband and a failed actor turned gambler and alcoholic.\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as James \"Hobie\" Hobart, Theo's mentor, Pippa's legal guardian and Welty's partner.\n* [[Ashleigh Cummings]] as Pippa, Theo's unrequited love and obsession.\n** Aimee Laurence as young Pippa\n* [[Willa Fitzgerald]] as Kitsey Barbour, Andy and Platt's sister, Theo's fianc\u00e9e and Chance and Samantha's daughter.\n** Carly Connors as young Kitsey\n* [[Denis O'Hare]] as Lucius Reeve, a dangerous art collector who discovers Theo's secret.\n* [[Boyd Gaines]] as Chance Barbour, Samantha's husband and Kitsey, Andy and Platt's father.\n* [[Peter Jacobson]] as Mr. Silver\n* [[Luke Kleintank]] as Platt Barbour, Andy and Kitsey's older brother and Chance and Samantha's son.\n** Jack DiFalco as young Platt\n* [[Robert Joy]] as Welton \"Welty\" Blackwell, Hobie's partner.\n* Ryan Foust as Andy Barbour, Chance and Samantha's son and Platt and Kitsey's brother who is a school-friend of Theo.\n* Hailey Wist as Audrey Decker, Theodore's mother and Larry's wife.\n\n==Production==\nIn July 2014, film rights to [[The Goldfinch (novel)|the novel]] were sold to [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros.

The film stars [[Ansel Elgort]], a young man whose life is transformed after his mother dies in a terrorist bombing at a museum, and he is convinced by an older man to take a famous painting called ''[[The Goldfinch (painting)|The Goldfinch]]'' from the museum. [[Oakes Fegley]], [[Aneurin Barnard]], [[Finn Wolfhard]], [[Sarah Paulson]], [[Luke Wilson]], [[Jeffrey Wright]], and [[Nicole Kidman]] appear in the film in supporting roles.\n\nFilm rights to the novel were sold to [[Warner Bros.]] and [[RatPac Entertainment]] with ICM Partners brokering the deal. Two years later, Crowley was hired to direct the film adaptation, and Elgort was selected to portray the lead role of Theodore Decker. Most of the remaining cast joined from October 2017 to January 2018. Filming began in [[New York City]] in January 2018 and then moved to [[Albuquerque]] in April 2018 for the rest of the production.\n\n''The Goldfinch'' premiered at the [[2019 Toronto International Film Festival]] and was theatrically released in the United States on September 13, 2019, by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The film received generally negative reviews from critics and was a [[box-office bomb]], with estimated losses for the studio as high as $50 million.\n\n==Plot==\nThirteen-year-old Theodore Decker's mother is killed in a bombing at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]]. In the aftermath of the bombing, Theo takes a painting after an older man tells him to, ''[[The Goldfinch (painting)|The Goldfinch]]'', one of the few remaining paintings by [[Carel Fabritius]], and hides it at his apartment. Theo is then placed with the Barbours, the family of his estranged friend Andy, as he has no other relatives in the city and his father has abandoned him.\n\nTheo reconnects with Andy and becomes close to Andy's mother, Samantha Barbour, who encourages his interest in her antiques and art. After Samantha finds an engraved ring in Theo's possession, he goes to visit the shop where it came from, Hobart & Blackwell. The shop is run by James \"Hobie\" Hobart, whose deceased partner Welton \"Welty\" Blackwell died in the bombing and gave the ring to Theo to return. Welty's niece, Pippa, was also at the museum and survived the bombing. Hobie allows Theo to visit Pippa, who has serious injuries, and the two bond. Theo begins to visit Hobie regularly, even after Pippa leaves to live with her aunt in Texas.\n\nTheo begins to settle into life with the Barbours and is invited to go on vacation with them as Andy is hinting that his parents are considering adopting him. Before they can, Theo's estranged and alcoholic father, Larry, newly detoxed, and his girlfriend Xandra arrive to reclaim Theo and relocate him to [[Las Vegas]]. One of the few items he takes with him is ''The Goldfinch'' painting.\n\nTheo makes a friend, Boris, a Ukrainian immigrant whose father is physically abusive. Boris, who has also lost his mother, introduces Theo to drugs and alcohol. Theo's father, sliding further into alcoholism and gambling, dies in a car accident. Theo decides to return to New York and promises to take care of Xandra's dog, Popper, for her. Theo begs Boris to come with him and Boris promises he will follow Theo, but never does. Theo goes to Hobie, who allows him to live with him.\n\nEight years after Theo returns to New York City, he runs into Platt, Andy's older brother. Platt informs Theo that his father was bipolar and that he and Andy were killed in a boating accident during one of his [[Mental breakdown|episodes]]. Theo goes to visit the now sickly Mrs. Barbour and reconnects with Andy's younger sister Kitsey, who flirts with him.\n\nTheo works selling restored antiques from Hobie's shop. A disgruntled art dealer accuses Theo of selling a fake, which Theo offers to buy back. However, the dealer believes that Theo possesses ''The Goldfinch'' painting and is using it as collateral to finance his shop. Theo is shocked that the man has made the connection between him and the painting, but is relieved that his guess as to its whereabouts is wrong as Theo continues to keep the wrapped painting in a storage locker.\n\nTheo becomes engaged to Kitsey, whom he does not love, still harboring a secret love for Pippa, who now lives in [[London]]. Theo catches Kitsey cheating on him, but decides to remain engaged due to his love for Mrs. Barbour and Kitsey's permissive attitude towards his drug habit.\n\nLooking to score pills one day, Theo goes to an unknown bar where he runs into Boris. The two reconnect, with Boris telling Theo that he owes everything to their friendship. Boris apologizes to Theo, which Theo initially believes is for never coming to New York City, but he then realizes is because Boris stole ''The Goldfinch'' years ago, after Theo showed it to him during a drug blackout. Ever since, Boris has used it to finance his life of crime. Boris is now no longer in possession of the painting, as a gang of thugs have stolen it. Theo is horrified and runs away from Boris.\n\nAt Theo's engagement party to Kitsey, Boris arrives and tells him he has a plan to recover ''The Goldfinch''. They fly to [[Amsterdam]], where Theo pretends to be a wealthy businessman, and they reclaim the painting. However, the plan goes badly, and Boris is shot. Theo kills a man in self-defense, losing the painting again.\n\nTheo goes to his hotel room and tries to commit suicide, only to be rescued by Boris.

After their successful dispersion and containment, Erskine went after the forest fighters' source of supplies, money and recruits, i.e. the native Kenyan population of Nairobi.

Between June 1953 and October 1955, the RAF provided a significant contribution to the conflict\u2014and, indeed, had to, for the army was preoccupied with providing security in the reserves until January 1955, and it was the only service capable of both psychologically influencing and inflicting considerable casualties on the Mau Mau fighters operating in the dense forests. Lack of timely and accurate intelligence meant bombing was rather haphazard, but almost 900 insurgents had been killed or wounded by air attacks by June 1954, and it did cause forest gangs to disband, lower their morale, and induce their pronounced relocation from the forests to the reserves.<ref name = \"Chappell 2011\">{{Harvnb|Chappell|2011}}.</ref>\n\nContrary to that which is sometimes claimed, [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] were not used during the Emergency, though [[Avro Lincoln|Lincolns]] were.

These were moved up the Pipeline to special detention camps. Thus a detainee's position in Pipeline was a straightforward reflection of how cooperative the Pipeline personnel deemed her or him to be. Cooperation was itself defined in terms of a detainee's readiness to confess their Mau Mau oath.

During transit, there was frequently little or no food and water provided, and seldom any sanitation. Once in camp, talking was forbidden outside the detainees' accommodation huts, though improvised communication was rife. Such communication included propaganda and disinformation, which went by such names as the ''Kinongo Times'', designed to encourage fellow detainees not to give up hope and so to minimise the number of those who confessed their oath and cooperated with camp authorities. Forced labour was performed by detainees on projects like the thirty-seven-mile-long South Yatta irrigation furrow.<ref name = \"Elkins 2005 pp154-91\"/> Family outside and other considerations led many detainees to confess.<ref name = \"Peterson 2008 75_76,89,91\">{{Harvnb|Peterson|2008|pp=75\u20136, 89, 91}}: \"Some detainees, worried that the substance of their lives was draining away, thought their primary duty lay with their families. They therefore confessed to British officers, and sought an early release from detention. Other detainees refused to accept the British demand that they sully other people's reputations by naming those whom they knew to be involved in Mau Mau.

Guards were regularly shifted around the Pipeline too in order to prevent relationships developing with detainees and so undercut the black markets, and inducements and punishments became better at discouraging fraternising with the enemy.<ref name = \"Elkins 2005 pp179-191\">{{Harvnb|Elkins|2005|pp=179\u201391}}.</ref> The grinding nature of the improved detention and interrogation regimen began to produce results. Most detainees confessed, and the system produced ever greater numbers of spies and informers within the camps, while others switched sides in a more open, official fashion, leaving detention behind to take an active role in interrogations, even sometimes administering beatings.<ref name = \"Elkins 2005 pp179-191\"/>\n\nThe most famous example of side-switching was Peter Muigai Kenyatta\u2014Jomo Kenyatta's son\u2014who, after confessing, joined screeners at Athi River Camp, later travelling throughout the Pipeline to assist in interrogations.<ref name = \"Elkins 2005 p148\">{{Harvnb|Elkins|2005|p=148}}. It is debatable whether Peter Kenyatta was sympathetic to Mau Mau in the first place and therefore whether he truly switched sides.</ref> Suspected informers and spies within a camp were treated in the time-honoured Mau Mau fashion: the preferred method of execution was strangulation then mutilation: \"It was just like in the days before our detention\", explained one Mau Mau member later. \"We did not have our own jails to hold an informant in, so we would strangle him and then cut his tongue out.\" The end of 1955 also saw screeners being given a freer hand in interrogation, and harsher conditions than straightforward confession were imposed on detainees before they were deemed 'cooperative' and eligible for final release.<ref name = \"Elkins 2005 pp179-191\"/>\n\n{{quote box\n| title =\n| quote = In a half-circle against the reed walls of the enclosure stand eight young, African women.

Members of the 5th KAR B Company entered the Chuka area on 13 June 1953, to flush out rebels suspected of hiding in the nearby forests. Over the next few days, the regiment had captured and executed 20 people suspected of being Mau Mau fighters for unknown reasons. The people executed belonged to the [[Kikuyu Home Guard]] \u2014 a loyalist militia recruited by the British to fight the guerrillas. Nobody ever stood trial for the massacre.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n====Hola massacre====\nThe [[Hola massacre]] was an incident during the conflict in [[Kenya]] against [[British Empire|British colonial rule]] at a colonial detention camp in [[Hola, Kenya]]. By January 1959, the camp had a population of 506 detainees, of whom 127 were held in a secluded \"closed camp\". This more remote camp near [[Garissa]], eastern Kenya, was reserved for the most uncooperative of the detainees. They often refused, even when threats of force were made, to join in the colonial \"rehabilitation process\" or perform manual labour or obey colonial orders. The camp commandant outlined a plan that would force 88 of the detainees to bend to work. On 3 March 1959, the camp commandant put this plan into action \u2013 as a result, 11 detainees were clubbed to death by guards.<ref>Maloba, Wunyabari O.

According to some members of Mau Mau, they never referred to themselves as such, instead preferring the military title Kenya Land and Freedom Army (KLFA).<ref name = \"Kanogo 1992 23to25\">{{Harvnb|Kanogo|1992|pp=23\u20135}}.</ref> Some publications, such as Fred Majdalany's ''State of Emergency: The Full Story of Mau Mau'', claim it was an anagram of ''Uma Uma'' (which means \"get out get out\") and was a military codeword based on a secret language-game Kikuyu boys used to play at the time of their circumcision. Majdalany goes on to state that the British simply used the name as a label for the Kikuyu ethnic community without assigning any specific definition.<ref name = \"Majdalany 1963 75\">{{Harvnb|Majdalany|1963|p=75}}.</ref>\n\nAkamba people say the name Mau Mau came from ' Ma Umau' meaning 'Our Grandfathers'. The term was first used during a pastoralists revolt against de-stocking that took place in 1938 led by Muindi Mbingu during which he urged the colonists to leave Kenya so that his people (the kamba) can live freely like the time of  'Our Grandfathers' (Twenda kwikala ta maau mau maitu, tuithye ngombe to Maau mau maitu, nundu nthi ino ni ya maau mau maitu).\n\nAs the movement progressed, a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] [[backronym]] was adopted: \"[[Mzungu]] Aende Ulaya, Mwafrika Apate Uhuru\" meaning \"Let the foreigner go back abroad, let the African regain independence\".<ref name = \"Kariuki 1960 167\">{{Harvnb|Kariuki|1975|p=167}}.</ref> J.M. Kariuki, a member of Mau Mau who was detained during the conflict, postulates that the British preferred to use the term ''Mau Mau'' instead of ''KLFA'' in an attempt to deny the Mau Mau rebellion international legitimacy.<ref name = \"Kariuki 1960 24\">{{Harvnb|Kariuki|1975|p=24}}.</ref> Kariuki also wrote that the term ''Mau Mau'' was adopted by the rebellion in order to counter what they regarded as colonial propaganda.<ref name = \"Kariuki 1960 167\"/>\n\nAnother possible origin is a mishearing of the Kikuyu word for oath \"muuma\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://what-when-how.com/religious-movements/mau-mau-religious-movement/|title=MAU MAU (Religious Movement)|website=what-when-how.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-12}}</ref>\n\nAuthor and activist [[Wangari Maathai]] indicates that, to her, the most interesting story of the origin of the name is the Kikuyu phrase for the beginning of a list.

Between June 1953 and October 1955, the RAF provided a significant contribution to the conflict\u2014and, indeed, had to, for the army was preoccupied with providing security in the reserves until January 1955, and it was the only service capable of both psychologically influencing and inflicting considerable casualties on the Mau Mau fighters operating in the dense forests. Lack of timely and accurate intelligence meant bombing was rather haphazard, but almost 900 insurgents had been killed or wounded by air attacks by June 1954, and it did cause forest gangs to disband, lower their morale, and induce their pronounced relocation from the forests to the reserves.<ref name = \"Chappell 2011\">{{Harvnb|Chappell|2011}}.</ref>\n\nContrary to that which is sometimes claimed, [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] were not used during the Emergency, though [[Avro Lincoln|Lincolns]] were.

Refusing to give more land to the Kikuyu in the reserves, which could have been seen as a concession to Mau Mau, Baring turned instead in 1953 to Roger Swynnerton, Kenya's assistant director of agriculture.<ref name = \"Anderson 1988 I\">{{Harvnb|Anderson|1988}}: \"The Swynnerton Plan was among the most comprehensive of all the post-war colonial development programmes implemented in British Africa.

These were moved up the Pipeline to special detention camps. Thus a detainee's position in Pipeline was a straightforward reflection of how cooperative the Pipeline personnel deemed her or him to be. Cooperation was itself defined in terms of a detainee's readiness to confess their Mau Mau oath. Detainees were screened and re-screened for confessions and intelligence, then re-classified accordingly.<ref name = \"Elkins 2005 p136\">{{Harvnb|Elkins|2005|p=136}}.</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n| title =\n| quote = [T]here is something peculiarly chilling about the way colonial officials behaved, most notoriously but not only in Kenya, within a decade of the liberation of the [Nazi] concentration camps and the return of thousands of emaciated British prisoners of war from the Pacific.

During transit, there was frequently little or no food and water provided, and seldom any sanitation. Once in camp, talking was forbidden outside the detainees' accommodation huts, though improvised communication was rife. Such communication included propaganda and disinformation, which went by such names as the ''Kinongo Times'', designed to encourage fellow detainees not to give up hope and so to minimise the number of those who confessed their oath and cooperated with camp authorities. Forced labour was performed by detainees on projects like the thirty-seven-mile-long South Yatta irrigation furrow.<ref name = \"Elkins 2005 pp154-91\"/> Family outside and other considerations led many detainees to confess.<ref name = \"Peterson 2008 75_76,89,91\">{{Harvnb|Peterson|2008|pp=75\u20136, 89, 91}}: \"Some detainees, worried that the substance of their lives was draining away, thought their primary duty lay with their families. They therefore confessed to British officers, and sought an early release from detention. Other detainees refused to accept the British demand that they sully other people's reputations by naming those whom they knew to be involved in Mau Mau. This 'hard core' kept their mouths closed, and languished for years in detention. The battle behind the wire was not fought over detainees' loyalty to a Mau Mau movement. Detainees' intellectual and moral concerns were always close to home. {{Nowrap|. . .}} British officials thought that those who confessed had broken their allegiance to Mau Mau.

Guards were regularly shifted around the Pipeline too in order to prevent relationships developing with detainees and so undercut the black markets, and inducements and punishments became better at discouraging fraternising with the enemy.<ref name = \"Elkins 2005 pp179-191\">{{Harvnb|Elkins|2005|pp=179\u201391}}.</ref> The grinding nature of the improved detention and interrogation regimen began to produce results. Most detainees confessed, and the system produced ever greater numbers of spies and informers within the camps, while others switched sides in a more open, official fashion, leaving detention behind to take an active role in interrogations, even sometimes administering beatings.<ref name = \"Elkins 2005 pp179-191\"/>\n\nThe most famous example of side-switching was Peter Muigai Kenyatta\u2014Jomo Kenyatta's son\u2014who, after confessing, joined screeners at Athi River Camp, later travelling throughout the Pipeline to assist in interrogations.<ref name = \"Elkins 2005 p148\">{{Harvnb|Elkins|2005|p=148}}. It is debatable whether Peter Kenyatta was sympathetic to Mau Mau in the first place and therefore whether he truly switched sides.</ref> Suspected informers and spies within a camp were treated in the time-honoured Mau Mau fashion: the preferred method of execution was strangulation then mutilation: \"It was just like in the days before our detention\", explained one Mau Mau member later. \"We did not have our own jails to hold an informant in, so we would strangle him and then cut his tongue out.\" The end of 1955 also saw screeners being given a freer hand in interrogation, and harsher conditions than straightforward confession were imposed on detainees before they were deemed 'cooperative' and eligible for final release.<ref name = \"Elkins 2005 pp179-191\"/>\n\n{{quote box\n| title =\n| quote = In a half-circle against the reed walls of the enclosure stand eight young, African women.

A couple of cranial specimens were also referred to the genus: UALVP 52611 (a nearly complete skull roof) and TMP 1986.036.0457 (a partial braincase).\n\nMany [[Dinosaur Park Formation|Dinosaur Park]] troodontid specimens once referred to ''[[Troodon]]'' have recently been referred to ''Stenonychosaurus'' and ''Latenivenatrix''. The specimens now referred to ''Stenonychosaurus'' include several frontals (UALVP 5282, TMP 1986.078.0040, TMP 1988.050.0088, TMP 1991.036.0690), a partial dentary (TMP 1982.019.0151), and the distal portion of a left metatarsal III (TMP 1998.068.0090).\n\nThis genus can be distinguished from other troodontids (particularly its close relative ''Latenivenatrix'') due to the following features:\n* A metatarsal III with a convex anterior surface.\n* An L-shaped frontal with a flat, anteroposteriorly rippled nasofrontal contact.\n\n==History of discovery==\nThe first specimens currently assigned to ''Troodon'' that were not teeth were both found by Sternberg in 1928, in the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] of [[Alberta]]. The first was named ''Stenonychosaurus inequalis'' by Sternberg in 1932, based on a foot, fragments of a hand, and some tail vertebrae. A remarkable feature of these remains was the enlarged claw on the second toe, which is now recognized as characteristic of early [[Paraves|paravians]]. Sternberg initially classified ''Stenonychosaurus'' as a member of the family [[Coeluridae]]. The second, a partial lower jaw bone, was described by Gilmore (1932) as a new species of lizard which he named ''[[Polyodontosaurus ]]grandis''. Later, in 1951, Sternberg recognized ''P. grandis'' as a possible synonym of ''Troodon'', and speculated that since ''Stenonychosaurus'' had a \"very peculiar [[pes (zoology)|pes]]\" and ''Troodon'' \"equally unusual teeth\", they may be closely related.  Unfortunately, no comparable specimens were available at that time to test the idea.\n[[File:Stenonychosaurus head neck NHM.jpg|thumb|upright|Head and neck of Dale Russell and Ron Seguin's sculpture, [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], London]]\nA more complete skeleton of ''Stenonychosaurus'' was described by [[Dale Russell]] in 1969 from the Dinosaur Park Formation, which eventually formed the scientific foundation for a famous life-sized sculpture of ''Stenonychosaurus'' accompanied by its fictional, [[humanoid]] descendant, the \"dinosauroid\".<ref name=russell1982>{{Cite journal | last1 = Russell | first1 = D.

Along with ''[[Saurornithoides]]'', it formed the family [[Saurornithoididae]]. Based on differences in tooth structure, and the extremely fragmentary nature of the original ''Troodon formosus'' specimens, saurornithoidids were thought to be close relatives while ''Troodon'' was considered a dubious possible relative of the family. [[Phil Currie]], reviewing the pertinent specimens in 1987, showed that supposed differences in tooth and jaw structure among troodontids and saurornithoidids were based on age and position of the tooth in the jaw, rather than a difference in species. He reclassified ''Stenonychosaurus inequalis'' as well as ''Polyodontosaurus grandis'' and ''[[Pectinodon bakkeri]]'' as junior synonyms of ''Troodon formosus''.

Currie's classification of all North American troodontid material in the single species ''Troodon formosus'' became widely adopted by other [[paleontology|paleontologists]], and all of the specimens once called ''Stenonychosaurus'' were referred to as ''Troodon'' in the scientific literature through the early 21st century.\n\nHowever, the concept that all Late Cretaceous North American troodontids belong to one species began to be questioned soon after Currie's 1987 paper was published, including by Currie himself. Currie and colleagues (1990) noted that, while they believed the Judith River troodontids were all ''T. formosus'', troodontid fossils from other formations, such as the [[Hell Creek Formation]] and [[Lance Formation]], might belong to different species. In 1991, George Olshevsky assigned the Lance formation fossils, which had first been named ''Pectinodon bakkeri'' but later synonymized with ''Troodon formosus'' to the species ''Troodon bakkeri'', and several other researchers (including Currie) reverted to keeping the Dinosaur Park Formation fossils separate as ''Troodon inequalis''.<ref name=currie2005>Currie, P.

They followed Longrich (2008) in treating ''Pectinodon bakkeri'' as a valid genus, and noted that it is likely the numerous Late Cretaceous specimens currently assigned to ''Troodon formosus'' almost certainly represent numerous new species, but that a more thorough review of the specimens is required. Because the holotype of ''T. formosus'' is a single tooth, this may render ''Troodon'' a [[nomen dubium]].<ref name=Talos>{{Cite journal|author=Lindsay E. Zanno, David J. Varricchio, Patrick M.

Russell]], then curator of vertebrate fossils at the [[Canadian Museum of Nature|National Museum of Canada]] in Ottawa, conjectured a possible evolutionary path for ''Stenonychosaurus'', if it had not perished in the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]] 65 million years ago, suggesting that it could have evolved into intelligent beings similar in body plan to humans. Over geologic time, Russell noted that there had been a steady increase in the [[encephalization quotient]] or EQ (the relative brain weight when compared to other species with the same body weight) among the dinosaurs. Russell had discovered the first Troodontid skull, and noted that, while its EQ was low compared to humans, it was six times higher than that of other dinosaurs. Russell suggested that if the trend in ''Stenonychosaurus'' evolution had continued to the present, its brain case could by now measure 1,100&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>, comparable to that of a human.<ref name=russell1982/>\n\n[[Troodontid]]s had semi-manipulative fingers, able to grasp and hold objects to a certain degree, and binocular vision.<ref name=russell1982/> Russell proposed that his \"Dinosauroid\", like members of the troodontid family, would have had large eyes and three fingers on each hand, one of which would have been partially [[Opposable thumb|opposed]]. Russell also speculated that the \"Dinosauroid\" would have had a toothless beak. As with most modern reptiles (and birds), he conceived of its genitalia as internal. Russell speculated that it would have required a navel, as a placenta aids the development of a large brain case. However, it would not have possessed mammary glands, and would have fed its young, as some birds do, on regurgitated food. He speculated that its language would have sounded somewhat like [[bird song]].<ref name=russell1982/><ref name=nash>Naish, D. (2006).

[[Gregory S. Paul]] (1988) and [[Thomas R. Holtz, Jr.]], consider it \"suspiciously human\" and [[Darren Naish]] has argued that a large-brained, highly intelligent troodontid would retain a more standard theropod body plan, with a horizontal posture and long tail, and would probably manipulate objects with the snout and feet in the manner of a bird, rather than with human-like \"hands\".<ref name=nash/>\n\n== Paleobiology ==\n[[File:Stenonychosaurus-inequalis-by-Midiaou.png|thumb|Restoration of two individuals playing in snow]] \n''Stenonychosaurus'' are thought to have been [[predator]]s, a view supported by its sickle claw on the foot and apparently good [[Depth perception|binocular vision]].\n\n''Stenonychosaurus'' teeth, however, are different from most other [[theropod]]s.

There are pits at the intersections of the denticles, and the points of the denticles point towards the tip, or apex, of each tooth. The teeth show wear facets on their sides. Holtz (1998) also noted that characteristics used to support a predatory habit for ''Stenonychosaurus'' \u2013 the grasping hands, large brain and stereoscopic vision, are all characteristics shared with the herbivorous/omnivorous [[primate]]s and omnivorous ''[[Procyon (genus)|Procyon]]'' (raccoon).\n\n[[Age determination of dinosaurs|Age determination]] studies performed on the [[Two Medicine Formation|Two Medicine]] troodont using growth ring counts suggest that this dinosaur reached its adult size probably in 3\u20135 years.<ref>Varricchio, D.

(1997) described the exact structure of the nests. They were built from sediments, they were dish shaped, about 100&nbsp;cm in internal diameter, and with a pronounced raised rim encircling the eggs. The more complete nests had between 16 (minimum number in MOR 246) and 24 (MOR 963) eggs. The eggs are shaped like elongated teardrops, with the more tapered ends pointed downwards and imbedded about halfway in the sediment. The eggs are pitched at an angle so that, on average, the upper half is closer to the center of the nest. There is no evidence that plant matter was present in the nest.\n[[File:Prismatoolithus levis, troodontid dinosaur eggs, Two Medicine Formation, Upper Cretaceous; Egg Mountain, Teton County, Montana, USA.jpg|thumb|Clutch of eggs, [[Museum of the Rockies]]]] \nVarricchio et al.(1997) were able to extract enough evidence from the nests to infer several characteristics of troodont reproductive biology. The results are that they appear to have had a type of reproduction that is intermediate between crocodiles and birds, as phylogeny would predict. The eggs are statistically grouped in pairs, which suggests that the animal had two functional oviducts, like crocodiles, rather than one, as in birds. Crocodiles lay many eggs that are small proportional to adult body size. Birds lay fewer, larger, eggs. The Two Medicine troodont was intermediate, laying an egg of about 0.5&nbsp;kg for a 50&nbsp;kg adult. This is 10 times larger than reptiles of the same mass, but two troodont eggs are roughly equivalent to the 1.1&nbsp;kg egg predicted for a 50&nbsp;kg bird.\n\nVarricchio et al. also found evidence for iterative laying, where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every one or two days, and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying brooding until all eggs were laid. MOR 363 was found with 22 empty (hatched) eggs, and the embryos found in the eggs of MOR 246 were in very similar states of development, implying that all of the young hatched approximately simultaneously. The embryos had an advanced degree of skeletal development and empty eggs were relatively uncrushed, implying that hatchlings were [[precocial]]. The authors estimated 45 to 65 total days of adult nest attendance for laying, brooding, and hatching. <ref name=\"Varrichioetal.02\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0564:EAEFTC]2.0.CO;2 | last1 = Varricchio | first1 = David J. | last2 = Horner | first2 = John J. | last3 = Jackson | first3 = Frankie D. | year = 2002 | title = Embryos and eggs for the Cretaceous theropod dinosaur ''Troodon formosus'' | url = | journal = Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 564\u2013576 }}</ref>\n\nVarricchio et al.

They also measured the ratio of the total volume of eggs in clutches to the body mass of the adult. They graphed correlations between this ratio and the type of parenting strategies used by extant birds and crocodiles and found that the ratio in the troodont was consistent with that in birds where only the adult male broods the eggs. From this they concluded that troodont females likely did not brood eggs, that the males did, and this may be a character shared between maniraptoran dinosaurs and basal birds.<ref name=Varricchioetal2008>{{cite journal | last1= Varricchio | first1= D.

A couple of cranial specimens were also referred to the genus: UALVP 52611 (a nearly complete skull roof) and TMP 1986.036.0457 (a partial braincase).\n\nMany [[Dinosaur Park Formation|Dinosaur Park]] troodontid specimens once referred to ''[[Troodon]]'' have recently been referred to ''Stenonychosaurus'' and ''Latenivenatrix''. The specimens now referred to ''Stenonychosaurus'' include several frontals (UALVP 5282, TMP 1986.078.0040, TMP 1988.050.0088, TMP 1991.036.0690), a partial dentary (TMP 1982.019.0151), and the distal portion of a left metatarsal III (TMP 1998.068.0090).\n\nThis genus can be distinguished from other troodontids (particularly its close relative ''Latenivenatrix'') due to the following features:\n* A metatarsal III with a convex anterior surface.\n* An L-shaped frontal with a flat, anteroposteriorly rippled nasofrontal contact.\n\n==History of discovery==\nThe first specimens currently assigned to ''Troodon'' that were not teeth were both found by Sternberg in 1928, in the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] of [[Alberta]]. The first was named ''Stenonychosaurus inequalis'' by Sternberg in 1932, based on a foot, fragments of a hand, and some tail vertebrae. A remarkable feature of these remains was the enlarged claw on the second toe, which is now recognized as characteristic of early [[Paraves|paravians]]. Sternberg initially classified ''Stenonychosaurus'' as a member of the family [[Coeluridae]]. The second, a partial lower jaw bone, was described by Gilmore (1932) as a new species of lizard which he named ''[[Polyodontosaurus ]]grandis''. Later, in 1951, Sternberg recognized ''P. grandis'' as a possible synonym of ''Troodon'', and speculated that since ''Stenonychosaurus'' had a \"very peculiar [[pes (zoology)|pes]]\" and ''Troodon'' \"equally unusual teeth\", they may be closely related.  Unfortunately, no comparable specimens were available at that time to test the idea.\n[[File:Stenonychosaurus head neck NHM.jpg|thumb|upright|Head and neck of Dale Russell and Ron Seguin's sculpture, [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], London]]\nA more complete skeleton of ''Stenonychosaurus'' was described by [[Dale Russell]] in 1969 from the Dinosaur Park Formation, which eventually formed the scientific foundation for a famous life-sized sculpture of ''Stenonychosaurus'' accompanied by its fictional, [[humanoid]] descendant, the \"dinosauroid\".<ref name=russell1982>{{Cite journal | last1 = Russell | first1 = D.

Along with ''[[Saurornithoides]]'', it formed the family [[Saurornithoididae]]. Based on differences in tooth structure, and the extremely fragmentary nature of the original ''Troodon formosus'' specimens, saurornithoidids were thought to be close relatives while ''Troodon'' was considered a dubious possible relative of the family. [[Phil Currie]], reviewing the pertinent specimens in 1987, showed that supposed differences in tooth and jaw structure among troodontids and saurornithoidids were based on age and position of the tooth in the jaw, rather than a difference in species. He reclassified ''Stenonychosaurus inequalis'' as well as ''Polyodontosaurus grandis'' and ''[[Pectinodon bakkeri]]'' as junior synonyms of ''Troodon formosus''.

Currie's classification of all North American troodontid material in the single species ''Troodon formosus'' became widely adopted by other [[paleontology|paleontologists]], and all of the specimens once called ''Stenonychosaurus'' were referred to as ''Troodon'' in the scientific literature through the early 21st century.\n\nHowever, the concept that all Late Cretaceous North American troodontids belong to one species began to be questioned soon after Currie's 1987 paper was published, including by Currie himself. Currie and colleagues (1990) noted that, while they believed the Judith River troodontids were all ''T. formosus'', troodontid fossils from other formations, such as the [[Hell Creek Formation]] and [[Lance Formation]], might belong to different species. In 1991, George Olshevsky assigned the Lance formation fossils, which had first been named ''Pectinodon bakkeri'' but later synonymized with ''Troodon formosus'' to the species ''Troodon bakkeri'', and several other researchers (including Currie) reverted to keeping the Dinosaur Park Formation fossils separate as ''Troodon inequalis''.<ref name=currie2005>Currie, P.

They followed Longrich (2008) in treating ''Pectinodon bakkeri'' as a valid genus, and noted that it is likely the numerous Late Cretaceous specimens currently assigned to ''Troodon formosus'' almost certainly represent numerous new species, but that a more thorough review of the specimens is required. Because the holotype of ''T. formosus'' is a single tooth, this may render ''Troodon'' a [[nomen dubium]].<ref name=Talos>{{Cite journal|author=Lindsay E. Zanno, David J. Varricchio, Patrick M.

Russell]], then curator of vertebrate fossils at the [[Canadian Museum of Nature|National Museum of Canada]] in Ottawa, conjectured a possible evolutionary path for ''Stenonychosaurus'', if it had not perished in the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]] 65 million years ago, suggesting that it could have evolved into intelligent beings similar in body plan to humans. Over geologic time, Russell noted that there had been a steady increase in the [[encephalization quotient]] or EQ (the relative brain weight when compared to other species with the same body weight) among the dinosaurs. Russell had discovered the first Troodontid skull, and noted that, while its EQ was low compared to humans, it was six times higher than that of other dinosaurs. Russell suggested that if the trend in ''Stenonychosaurus'' evolution had continued to the present, its brain case could by now measure 1,100&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup>, comparable to that of a human.<ref name=russell1982/>\n\n[[Troodontid]]s had semi-manipulative fingers, able to grasp and hold objects to a certain degree, and binocular vision.<ref name=russell1982/> Russell proposed that his \"Dinosauroid\", like members of the troodontid family, would have had large eyes and three fingers on each hand, one of which would have been partially [[Opposable thumb|opposed]]. Russell also speculated that the \"Dinosauroid\" would have had a toothless beak. As with most modern reptiles (and birds), he conceived of its genitalia as internal. Russell speculated that it would have required a navel, as a placenta aids the development of a large brain case. However, it would not have possessed mammary glands, and would have fed its young, as some birds do, on regurgitated food. He speculated that its language would have sounded somewhat like [[bird song]].<ref name=russell1982/><ref name=nash>Naish, D. (2006).

[[Gregory S. Paul]] (1988) and [[Thomas R. Holtz, Jr.]], consider it \"suspiciously human\" and [[Darren Naish]] has argued that a large-brained, highly intelligent troodontid would retain a more standard theropod body plan, with a horizontal posture and long tail, and would probably manipulate objects with the snout and feet in the manner of a bird, rather than with human-like \"hands\".<ref name=nash/>\n\n== Paleobiology ==\n[[File:Troodon-inequalis-by-Midiaou.png|thumb|Restoration of two individuals playing in snow]] \n''Stenonychosaurus'' are thought to have been [[predator]]s, a view supported by its sickle claw on the foot and apparently good [[Depth perception|binocular vision]].\n\n''Stenonychosaurus'' teeth, however, are different from most other [[theropod]]s.

There are pits at the intersections of the denticles, and the points of the denticles point towards the tip, or apex, of each tooth. The teeth show wear facets on their sides. Holtz (1998) also noted that characteristics used to support a predatory habit for ''Stenonychosaurus'' \u2013 the grasping hands, large brain and stereoscopic vision, are all characteristics shared with the herbivorous/omnivorous [[primate]]s and omnivorous ''[[Procyon (genus)|Procyon]]'' (raccoon).\n\n[[Age determination of dinosaurs|Age determination]] studies performed on the [[Two Medicine Formation|Two Medicine]] troodont using growth ring counts suggest that this dinosaur reached its adult size probably in 3\u20135 years.<ref>Varricchio, D.

(1997) described the exact structure of the nests. They were built from sediments, they were dish shaped, about 100&nbsp;cm in internal diameter, and with a pronounced raised rim encircling the eggs. The more complete nests had between 16 (minimum number in MOR 246) and 24 (MOR 963) eggs. The eggs are shaped like elongated teardrops, with the more tapered ends pointed downwards and imbedded about halfway in the sediment. The eggs are pitched at an angle so that, on average, the upper half is closer to the center of the nest. There is no evidence that plant matter was present in the nest.\n[[File:Prismatoolithus levis, troodontid dinosaur eggs, Two Medicine Formation, Upper Cretaceous; Egg Mountain, Teton County, Montana, USA.jpg|thumb|Clutch of eggs, [[Museum of the Rockies]]]] \nVarricchio et al.(1997) were able to extract enough evidence from the nests to infer several characteristics of troodont reproductive biology. The results are that they appear to have had a type of reproduction that is intermediate between crocodiles and birds, as phylogeny would predict. The eggs are statistically grouped in pairs, which suggests that the animal had two functional oviducts, like crocodiles, rather than one, as in birds. Crocodiles lay many eggs that are small proportional to adult body size. Birds lay fewer, larger, eggs. The Two Medicine troodont was intermediate, laying an egg of about 0.5&nbsp;kg for a 50&nbsp;kg adult. This is 10 times larger than reptiles of the same mass, but two troodont eggs are roughly equivalent to the 1.1&nbsp;kg egg predicted for a 50&nbsp;kg bird.\n\nVarricchio et al. also found evidence for iterative laying, where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every one or two days, and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying brooding until all eggs were laid. MOR 363 was found with 22 empty (hatched) eggs, and the embryos found in the eggs of MOR 246 were in very similar states of development, implying that all of the young hatched approximately simultaneously. The embryos had an advanced degree of skeletal development and empty eggs were relatively uncrushed, implying that hatchlings were [[precocial]]. The authors estimated 45 to 65 total days of adult nest attendance for laying, brooding, and hatching. <ref name=\"Varrichioetal.02\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0564:EAEFTC]2.0.CO;2 | last1 = Varricchio | first1 = David J. | last2 = Horner | first2 = John J. | last3 = Jackson | first3 = Frankie D. | year = 2002 | title = Embryos and eggs for the Cretaceous theropod dinosaur ''Troodon formosus'' | url = | journal = Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 564\u2013576 }}</ref>\n\nVarricchio et al.

They also measured the ratio of the total volume of eggs in clutches to the body mass of the adult. They graphed correlations between this ratio and the type of parenting strategies used by extant birds and crocodiles and found that the ratio in the troodont was consistent with that in birds where only the adult male broods the eggs. From this they concluded that troodont females likely did not brood eggs, that the males did, and this may be a character shared between maniraptoran dinosaurs and basal birds.<ref name=Varricchioetal2008>{{cite journal | last1= Varricchio | first1= D.
