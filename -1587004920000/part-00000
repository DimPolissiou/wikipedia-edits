They predominantly mention a mean and cruel king named Nanda, born to a queen after her affair with a barber, one who assassinated the king and came to power by a coup. Chandragupta later removed Nanda from power. The exception that does mention Chandragupta directly is the 2nd-century text by the Roman historian Justin. He states Chandragupta was of \u201chumble origin\u201d, then includes stories of miraculous legends associated with him, such as a wild elephant appearing and submitting itself as a ride to him before a war. The Justin version states Chandragupta and Chanakya defeated and removed the evil Nanda king.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=5-7}} The account of Megasthenes, as it has survived in Greek texts that quote him, states that Alexander the Great and Sandrocottos (Chandragupta) met, which if true would mean his rule started earlier than 321 BCE.

Mookerji|1966|pp=7\u20139}} The Chanakya\u2019s \u2018\u2019Arthasastra\u2019\u2019 refers to the Nanda rule as against the \u201cspiritual, cultural and military\u201d interests of the country, a period where intrigue and vice multiplied.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=7\u20139}} Chanakya states that Chandragupta returned dharma, nurtured a diversity of views, and a virtuous rule that kindled love among the subjects for his rule.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=7\u20139}}\n\nHindu sources are inconsistent. One medieval commentator states Chandragupta to be the son of one of the Nanda\u2019s wives with the name \u201cMura\u201d.{{sfn|R. K.

Mookerji|1966|pp=9\u201311}}  The word \"Vrishala\u201d has two meanings, one the \"son of a [[Shudra]]\u201d, another meaning being the \"best of kings\". A later commentator used the former interpretation to posit that Chandragupta came from a Shudra background. However, historian R. K. Mookerji opposes this theory, and states that the word should be interpreted as \"the best of kings\u201d.{{sfn|R. K.

[[Plutarch]] claims that he was a young man when he met [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] during the [[Indian campaign of Alexander the Great|latter's invasion of India]] (c. 326-325 BCE). Assuming the Plutarch account is true, Raychaudhuri proposed in 1923 that Chandragupta may have been born after c. 350 BCE.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1923|p=142}} According to other Greco-Roman texts, Chandragupta attacked the Greek-Indian governors after Alexander's death (c. 323 CE) with [[Seleucus I Nicator]] entering into a treaty with Chandragupta years later.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1923|p=137}}  Seleucus Nicator, under this treaty, gave up Arachosia (Kandahar), Gedrosia (Makran) and Paropanisadai(Paropamisadae, Kabul) to Chandragupta, in exchange for 500 war elephants.<ref name=\"Singh2017p264\"/>\n\nThe texts do not include the start or end year of Chandragupta's reign.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1923|p=138}} According to some Hindu and the Buddhist texts, Chandragupta's ruled for 24 years.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=13}} The Buddhist sources state Chandragupta Maurya ruled 162 years after the death of the Buddha.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1967|pp=134\u2013142}} However, the birth and death of the Buddha varies by source and all these lead to a chronology that is significantly different than the Greek-Roman records. Similarly, Jain sources composed nearly 1,200 years after Chandragupta\u2019s death give different gap between Mahavira\u2019s death and his accession.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1967|pp=134\u2013142}} As with Buddha's death, the date of Mahavira's death itself is also a matter of debate, and the inconsistencies and lack of unanimity among the Jain authors casts doubt on Jain sources. This Digambara Jain chronology, in addition, is not reconcilable with the chronology implied in other Indian and non-Indian sources.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1967|pp=134\u2013142}}\n\nHistorians such as Irfan Habib and Vivekanand Jha assign Chandragupta's reign to c. 322-298 BCE.{{sfn|Habib|Jha|2004|p=15}} Upinder Singh dates his rule from 324 or 321 BCE to 297 BCE.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=331}} Kristi Wiley states he reigned between 320 and 293 BCE.<ref name=\"Wiley2009p50\"/>\n\n=== Early life ===\n\nThe early life of Chandragupta Maurya is unclear and varies by source. According to the Sinhalese Buddhist tradition, Chandragupta's father - who was the chief of the Moriya clan - was killed in a battle, when his mother was pregnant. His mother escaped to the Puppha-pura (Pushpa-pura, literally \"flower city\", Patliputra) city with the help of her brothers. For Chandragupta safety, his maternal uncles helped a cattle-raising family adopt him as a baby. He was brought up by a [[cowman (profession)|cowherd]]. When Chandragupta grew up, the cowherd sold him to a hunter, who employed him to tend cattle.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=16}}{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1967|p=143}}\n\nAccording to the Digambara legend by Hemachandra, Chanakya was a Jain layperson and a Brahmin. When Chanakya was born, Jain monks prophesied that Chanakya will one day grow up to help make someone an emperor and will be the power behind the throne.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=6}}<ref name=\"Hemacandra1998\"/> Chanakya believed in the prophecy. He began making it true by agreeing to help the daughter of the chief of a peacock breeding community to deliver a baby boy. In exchange, for his fee, he asked the mother to give up the boy and let him adopt him at a later date.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=14}}<ref name=\"Hemacandra1998\"/> The Jain Brahmin then went about making money through magic, and returned later to claim boy Chandragupta.<ref name=\"Hemacandra1998\"/> He taught and trained him. Together, they recruited soldiers and began their violent attack of the local kingdom. First they failed, but later through alliances, they won the Nanda kingdom and proclaimed Patliputra as their capital.<ref name=\"Hemacandra1998\"/>\n\n==Career==\n=== Influence of Chanakya (Kautilya) ===\n[[File:Chanakya artistic depiction.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|alt=Chanakya|Chandragupta's [[guru]] was Chanakya, with whom he studied as a child and with whose counsel he built the Empire.

Broadly, they mention boy Chandragupta created a mock game of a royal court wherein his cowherd friends and he played. Chanakya saw the boy making decisions, approached the hunter, paid him off and adopted Chandragupta.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|pp=15\u201317}} He took the young Chandragupta, taught him, and then admitted him in Taxila to study the Vedas, military arts, law and other sastras.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|pp=15\u201317}}\n\nAfter Taxila, Chandragupta and Chanakya moved to Patliputra, the capital and a historic learning center in the eastern Maghada kingdom of India. There they met Nanda according to Hindu sources, and Dhana Nanda according to Pali-language Buddhist sources.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|pp=19\u201320}} Chandragupta became a commander of Nanda army, but according to the Roman records of Justin, Chandragupta (\"Sandrocottus\") offended the Nanda king (\"Nandrum\" or \"Nandrus\") because of which the king ordered him to be killed.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=6}} An alternate version states that it was Chanakya who was publicly insulted by the Nanda king.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=18}} Chandragupta and Chanakya escaped, and became rebels seeking to remove Nanda from power.{{sfn|Habib|Jha|2004|p=14}}{{refn|group=note|Some early printed editions of Justin's work wrongly mentioned \"Alexandrum\" instead of \"Nandrum\"; this error was corrected in philologist [[J.

Majumdar]] believed \"Alexandrum\" to be correct reading, and theorized that  Justin refers to a meeting between Chandragupta and [[Alexander the Great]] (\"Alexandrum\"). However, this is incorrect: research by historian [[Alfred von Gutschmid]] in the preceding century had clearly established that \"Nandrum\" is the correct reading supported by multiple manuscripts: only a single defective manuscript mentions \"Alexandrum\" in the margin.{{sfn|Trautmann|1970|pp=240-241}}}} The ''Mudrarakshasa'' also states that Chanakya swore to destroy the Nanda dynasty after he felt insulted by the king.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=18}}\n\nThe Roman text by Justin mentions a couple of miraculous incidents involving Sandracottus (Chandragupta) and presents these legends as omens and portents of his destined greatness. In the first incident, when Chandragupta was asleep after having escaped from Nandrum, a big lion came up to him, licked him, and then left. In the second incident, when Chandragupta was readying for war with Alexander's generals, a huge wild elephant came to him, became tame, and offered himself to be his ride to the war.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=32}}\n\n===Building the empire===\n{{Main|Conquest of the Nanda Empire|Maurya Empire}}\nAccording to the Buddhist text ''Mahavamsa Tika'', after the completion of Chandragupta's education at Taxila, he and Chanakya raised an army by recruiting soldiers from different places.

During celebrations, he was well-guarded, and on hunts, he was surrounded by women guards who were presumed to be less likely to participate in a coup conspiracy.

Prabhacandra was an important Jain monk scholar in his own right and one who migrated centuries after Chandragupta Maurya's death.<ref name=\"Dikshitar1993p264\"/> [[John Faithfull Fleet|John F Fleet]], an Indologist and epigraphist, concurs with Dikshitar and states Lewis Rice's interpretation and analysis of Shravanabelagola inscriptions were wrong and ahistorical.<ref name=\"Fleet1\"/> Other scholars have taken Lewis Rice's proposal of Chandragupta Maurya retiring and dying in Shravanabelagola as the working hypothesis, since no alternate historical information or evidence is available about Chandragupta's final years and death.<ref name=\"Dikshitar1993p264\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Paul Dundas]] \u2013 a scholar of Jain studies and Sanskrit, the Svetambara tradition of Jainism disputes the Digambara legends of antiquity.

Chanakya persuaded Chandragupta to convert to Jainism by showing Jain ascetics avoided women and focused on their religion.<ref name=\"Hemacandra1998\"/> The legend mentions Chanakya aiding the premature birth of Bindusara \u2013 the son Chandragupta and his dying queen,<ref name=\"Hemacandra1998\"/> but makes no mention of Chandragupta\u2019s migration or ''sallekhana'' (voluntary fasting to death).

His main biographical sources in chronological order are:{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=3-14}}\n*Greek and Roman sources, which are the oldest surviving records that mention Chandragupta or circumstances related to him; these include those by [[Nearchus]], [[Onesicritus]], [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia|Aristobulus]], [[Strabo]], [[Megasthenes]], [[Diodorus]], [[Arrian]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Justin (historian)|Justin]].\n*among the oldest dated Indian sources on Chandragupta are Hindu texts such as the [[Puranas]] and ''[[Arthashastra]]''; later composed Hindu sources include legends in [[Vishakhadatta]]'s ''[[Mudrarakshasa]]'', [[Somadeva]]'s ''[[Kathasaritsagara]]'' and [[Kshemendra]]'s ''[[Brihatkathamanjari]]''.\n*the earliest mentions of Chandragupta in Buddhist sources are those dated in 4th-century or after; these include the Sri Lankan Pali texts ''[[Dipavamsa]]'' (''rajavamsa'' section), ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', ''[[Mahavamsa tika]]'' and ''[[Mahabodhivamsa]]''.\n*the earliest sources that the Digambara Jain tradition state to be mentioning Chandragupta with Bhadrabahu appear in 7th\u2013 to 10th-century inscriptions at Sravana Belgola; this is disputed by scholars as well as the Svetambara Jain tradition;<ref name=\"Wiley2009p50\"/><ref name=\"Fleet1\"/> the first Digambara text interpreted to be mentioning the Maurya emperor are dated to about the 10th-century such as in the ''Brhatkathakosa'' of [[Harisena (Jain monk)|Harisena]], while the complete Jain legend about Chandragupta is found the 12th-century ''[[Parisishtaparvan]]'' by [[Hemachandra]].\n\nThe Greek and Roman texts, but for one exception, do not mention Chandragupta directly. They predominantly mention a mean and cruel king named Nanda, born to a queen after her affair with a barber, one who assassinated the king and came to power by a coup. Chandragupta later removed Nanda from power. The exception that does mention Chandragupta directly is the 2nd-century text by the Roman historian Justin. He states Chandragupta was of \u201chumble origin\u201d, then includes stories of miraculous legends associated with him, such as a wild elephant appearing and submitting itself as a ride to him before a war. The Justin version states Chandragupta and Chanakya defeated and removed the evil Nanda king.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=5-7}} The account of Megasthenes, as it has survived in Greek texts that quote him, states that Alexander the Great and Sandrocottos (Chandragupta) met, which if true would mean his rule started earlier than 321 BCE. He is described as a great king, but not as great in his power and reach as Porus in northwestern India or Agrammes (Dhana Nanda) in eastern India.<ref name=\"Singh2017p264\">{{cite book|author=Upinder Singh|title= Political Violence in Ancient India |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=t6A4DwAAQBAJ |year=2017| publisher= Harvard University Press|isbn= 978-0-674-97527-9|pages= 264\u2013265}}</ref>\n\nThe pre-4th century Brahmanical (Hindu) Puranic texts mostly mirror the Greek sources. These Hindu texts do not discuss the details of Chandragupta\u2019s ancestry, rather cover the ancestry of the Nanda king he unseated from the kingdom. The Nanda king is described as someone mean and cruel, persecuting people, as one against dharma and sastras, born out of an illicit relationship followed by coup.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=7\u20139}} The Chanakya\u2019s \u2018\u2019Arthasastra\u2019\u2019 refers to the Nanda rule as against the \u201cspiritual, cultural and military\u201d interests of the country, a period where intrigue and vice multiplied.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=7\u20139}} Chanakya states that Chandragupta returned dharma, nurtured a diversity of views, and a virtuous rule that kindled love among the subjects for his rule.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=7\u20139}}\n\nHindu sources are inconsistent. One medieval commentator states Chandragupta to be the son of one of the Nanda\u2019s wives with the name \u201cMura\u201d.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=7\u20139}} Another Sanskrit dramatic text ''[[Mudrarakshasa]]'' uses the terms \"Vrishala\" and \"Kula-hina\" to describe Chandragupta.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=9\u201311}}  The word \"Vrishala\u201d has two meanings, one the \"son of a [[Shudra]]\u201d, another meaning being the \"best of kings\". A later commentator used the former interpretation to posit that Chandragupta came from a Shudra background. However, historian R. K. Mookerji opposes this theory, and states that the word should be interpreted as \"the best of kings\u201d.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=9\u201311}} The same drama also refers to Chandragupta as someone of humble origin, in a manner similar to Justin.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=9\u201311}} According to the 11th-century texts of the Kashmiri Hindu tradition \u2013 ''[[Kathasaritsagara]]'' and ''Brihat-Katha-Manjari'' \u2013 the Nanda lineage was very short, of two competing Shudra power centers. Chandragupta was a son of Purva-Nanda, the older Nanda based in Ayodhya.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=13}}{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=15-18}}{{refn|group=note|According to Kaushik Roy, Chandragupta Maurya was a [[Shudra]] lineage king.{{sfn|Roy|2012|pp=61-62}}}} The most common theme in the Hindu sources is that Chandragupta came from a humble background and with Chanakya he emerged as a dharmic king loved by his subjects.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=7\u201313}}\n\nThe Buddhist texts such as ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' describe Chandragupta as of [[Kshatriya]] origin.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|p=14}} These sources, written about seven centuries after his dynasty ended, state that both Chandragupta and his grandson Ashoka \u2013 the great patron of Buddhism, were of the same noble family of Sakyas from which the [[Buddha]] came, but one that branched off.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=13-15}} These Buddhist sources thus attempt to link the dynasty of their patron Ashoka directly to the Buddha \u2013 the founder of their faith.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=12}} The branching, claim these sources, occurred to escape the persecution of a cruel king from Kosala and Chandragupta\u2019s ancestors moved into a secluded Himalayan kingdom known for its peacocks. The Buddhist sources explain the epithet ''Moriya'' comes from these peacocks, or ''Mora'' in Pali (Sanskrit: Mayura).{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=13-15}}<ref name=britchandrag/> The Buddhist texts are, however, also inconsistent. Some offer other legends to explain his epithet. For example, they mention a city named \"Moriya-nagara\" where all buildings were made of bricks colored like the peacock's resplendent neck.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=13-14}}  The ''Maha-bodhi-vamsa'' states he hailed from Moriya-nagara, while the ''Digha-Nikaya'' states he came from the Moriya clan of Pipphalivana.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=14}} The Buddhist sources also mention that \u201cBrahmin Chanakya\u201d was his counselor and with whose support Chandragupta became the king at Patliputra.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=13-14}}\n\n[[File:7th-century Bhadrabahu Sanskrit inscription, Purvahale Kannada script, Shravanabelgola Karnataka.jpg|thumb|upright=1.65|7th-century Bhadrabahu inscription at Shravanabelagola (Sanskrit, Purvahale Kannada script).

[[Plutarch]] claims that he was a young man when he met [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] during the [[Indian campaign of Alexander the Great|latter's invasion of India]] (c. 326-325 BCE). Assuming the Plutarch account is true, Raychaudhuri proposed in 1923 that Chandragupta may have been born after c. 350 BCE.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1923|p=142}} According to other Greco-Roman texts, Chandragupta attacked the Greek-Indian governors after Alexander's death (c. 323 CE) with [[Seleucus I Nicator]] entering into a treaty with Chandragupta years later.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1923|p=137}}  Seleucus Nicator, under this treaty, gave up Arachosia (Kandahar), Gedrosia (Makran) and Paropanisadai(Paropamisadae, Kabul) to Chandragupta, in exchange for 500 war elephants.<ref name=\"Singh2017p264\"/>\n\nThe texts do not include the start or end year of Chandragupta's reign.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1923|p=138}} According to some Hindu and the Buddhist texts, Chandragupta's ruled for 24 years.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=13}} The Buddhist sources state Chandragupta Maurya ruled 162 years after the death of the Buddha.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1967|pp=134\u2013142}} However, the birth and death of the Buddha varies by source and all these lead to a chronology that is significantly different than the Greek-Roman records. Similarly, Jain sources composed nearly 1,200 years after Chandragupta\u2019s death give different gap between Mahavira\u2019s death and his accession.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1967|pp=134\u2013142}} As with Buddha's death, the date of Mahavira's death itself is also a matter of debate, and the inconsistencies and lack of unanimity among the Jain authors casts doubt on Jain sources. This Digambara Jain chronology, in addition, is not reconcilable with the chronology implied in other Indian and non-Indian sources.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1967|pp=134\u2013142}}\n\nHistorians such as Irfan Habib and Vivekanand Jha assign Chandragupta's reign to c. 322-298 BCE.{{sfn|Habib|Jha|2004|p=15}} Upinder Singh dates his rule from 324 or 321 BCE to 297 BCE.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=331}} Kristi Wiley states he reigned between 320 and 293 BCE.<ref name=\"Wiley2009p50\"/>\n\n=== Early life ===\n\nThe early life of Chandragupta Maurya is unclear and varies by source. According to the Sinhalese Buddhist tradition, Chandragupta's father - who was the chief of the Moriya clan - was killed in a battle, when his mother was pregnant.

According to various sources, Chandragupta frequently changed bedrooms to confuse conspirators. He left his palace only for certain tasks: to go on military expeditions, to visit his court for dispensing justice, to offer sacrifices, for celebrations, and for hunting. During celebrations, he was well-guarded, and on hunts, he was surrounded by women guards who were presumed to be less likely to participate in a coup conspiracy.

Bhadrabahu led a migration of Jain monks to south India. Chandragupta Maurya joined him as a monk, after renouncing his kingdom and handing over the power to his son Bindusara.

The earliest and most important inscriptions mention Prabhacandra, which Lewis Rice presumed may have been the \"clerical name assumed by Chadragupta Maurya\" after he renounced and moved with Bhadrabahu from Patliputra. Dikshitar states there is no evidence in support of this, and the Digambara history provides evidence against this hypothesis. Prabhacandra was an important Jain monk scholar in his own right and one who migrated centuries after Chandragupta Maurya's death.<ref name=\"Dikshitar1993p264\"/> [[John Faithfull Fleet|John F Fleet]], an Indologist and epigraphist, concurs with Dikshitar and states Lewis Rice's interpretation and analysis of Shravanabelagola inscriptions were wrong and ahistorical.<ref name=\"Fleet1\"/> Other scholars have taken Lewis Rice's proposal of Chandragupta Maurya retiring and dying in Shravanabelagola as the working hypothesis, since no alternate historical information or evidence is available about Chandragupta's final years and death.<ref name=\"Dikshitar1993p264\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Paul Dundas]] \u2013 a scholar of Jain studies and Sanskrit, the Svetambara tradition of Jainism disputes the Digambara legends of antiquity.

It co-stars [[Richard Crenna]] and [[Brian Dennehy]], and is the first installment in the [[Rambo (franchise)|''Rambo'' franchise]], followed by ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]''.\n\nThe film is based on the 1972 novel [[First Blood (novel)|of the same name]] by [[David Morrell]]. In the film, Rambo, a troubled and misunderstood veteran, must rely on his combat and survival senses against the abusive law enforcement of the small town of Hope, [[Washington (state)|Washington]].\n\n''First Blood'' was released in the United States on October 22, 1982. Despite initial mixed reviews, the film was a box office success, grossing $125.2 million at the box office. Since its release, ''First Blood'' has received reappraisal from critics, with many praising the roles of Stallone, Dennehy, and Crenna, and recognizing it as an influential film in the action genre. The film's success spawned a franchise, consisting of four sequels (all of which were co-written by and starred Stallone), an animated television series and a series of comic books, novels, video games and a [[Bollywood]] remake.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Plot summaries are usually between 400-700 words. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. -->\nSeven years after his discharge, [[Vietnam War]] veteran [[John Rambo]] travels by foot to visit an old comrade, only to learn that his friend had died from cancer the previous year, due to [[Agent Orange]] exposure during the war.\n\nRambo continues to travel, wandering into the small town of Hope, [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. He is intercepted by the town's Sheriff, Will Teasle, who considers Rambo an unwanted nuisance. When Rambo, now in Teasle's police car, asks for directions to a diner, Teasle tells him that here is a diner 30 miles up the highway. He then drives Rambo out of the town and tells him that Portland, where Rambo had initially said he was headed, is straight ahead. Teasle then drops Rambo off and drives back towards the town. When Rambo tries to return, Teasle intercepts and arrests him on charges of [[vagrancy]], resisting arrest, and possessing a concealed knife.\n\nLed by sadistic chief deputy Art Galt, Teasle's officers abuse Rambo, triggering flashbacks of the torture he endured as a [[POW]] in [[Vietnam]]. When they try to dry-shave him with a straight razor, Rambo overwhelms the patrolmen, regains his knife, and fights his way out of the police station before stealing a motorcycle and fleeing into the woods. Teasle organizes a search party with automatic weapons, dogs, and a helicopter. Having spotted Rambo trapped on a high cliff over a creek, Galt defies orders from Teasle and attempts to shoot Rambo from the helicopter. Rambo leaps into a tree, injuring himself. With Galt still trying to shoot him, Rambo manages to throw a rock, fracturing the helicopter's windshield and causing the pilot to briefly lose control  resulting in Galt, who had removed his safety harness in order to get a better firing angle, to lose his balance and take a fatal plunge to the jagged rocks far below.\n\nRambo tries to persuade Teasle and his men that Galt's death was an accident and that he wants no more trouble, but the officers open fire and pursue him into the woods. It is then  revealed that Rambo is a former [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]] and received the [[Medal of Honor]], but Teasle, bent on revenge, refuses to turn the manhunt over to the State Police. One by one, using guerrilla tactics, Rambo non-lethally disables the deputies, using both booby traps and his bare hands, until only Teasle is left. Overpowering Teasle and holding a knife to his throat, Rambo tells him he could have killed them all and he threatens to give him a war he won't believe if Teasle does not let it go.\n\nThe state police and National Guard are called in to assist in the manhunt, while Rambo's mentor and former commanding officer Colonel [[Sam Trautman]] also arrives. Trautman confirms that Rambo is an expert at [[guerrilla warfare]] and [[Survival skills|survival]], which he honed in intensive combat in Vietnam; as such, he advises and suggests that Rambo be allowed to slip through the perimeter and escape to the next town - thereby diffusing the situation - then be permitted to surrender peacefully later. Confident that Rambo is hopelessly outnumbered, Teasle refuses. Teasle allows Trautman to contact Rambo \u2013 on a police radio he stole while escaping \u2013 and try to persuade him to surrender peacefully. Rambo recognizes Trautman's voice but refuses to give up, condemning Teasle and his deputies for their abuse and noting \"they drew first blood,\" before hanging up.\n\nTrying to slip through the cordon, Rambo is surprised by a young boy out hunting; he overpowers but refuses to harm the boy, who alerts the pursuers. A National Guard detachment corners Rambo at the entrance of an abandoned mine. Against orders, they use a rocket, collapsing the entrance and seemingly killing Rambo. He survives and finds another way out, hijacking a supply truck carrying an [[M60 machine gun]] and ammunition and returning to town. To distract his pursuers, he blows up a gas station, shoots out most of the town's power, and destroys a gun store near the police station. Trautman, knowing that the sheriff is no match for Rambo, tries to convince Teasle to escape, but is ignored.\n\nRambo spots Teasle on the police station's roof and they engage in a brief gunfight, ending with Teasle shot and falling through a skylight. As Rambo prepares to kill him, Trautman appears and warns Rambo that he will be shot if he does not surrender, reminding him he is the last survivor of his elite unit of Green Berets. Rambo collapses in tears and talks about his experience in Vietnam and after his return. Teasle is transported to a hospital, while Rambo surrenders to Trautman after being comforted and validated.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Rambo characters}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[John Rambo|John J.

He only returned to work on ''First Blood'' after [[Mario Kassar]] and [[Andrew G. Vajna]] of Anabasis Investments offered to finance one of his projects. Kotcheff offered the role of John Rambo to Sylvester Stallone, and the actor accepted after reading the script through a weekend.<ref name=drawing>{{cite video|title=Drawing First Blood|location=''First Blood'' DVD|date=2002|publisher=Artisan}}</ref> Various scripts adapted from Morrell's book had been pitched to studios in the years since its publication, but it was only when Stallone decided to become involved with the project that it was finally brought into production. Stallone's star power after the success of the [[Rocky (film series)|''Rocky'' films]] enabled him to rewrite the script to make the character of John Rambo more sympathetic. While Morrell's book has the Rambo character kill many of his pursuers, and Kozoll and Sackheim's draft had him killing sixteen people, in the movie Rambo does not directly cause the death of any police or national guardsmen. Stallone also decided to let Rambo survive the film instead of keeping the book's ending where he dies. A suicide scene was filmed but Kotcheff and Stallone opted to have Rambo turn himself in at Trautman's urging.<ref name=drawing/> Stallone did an estimated seven revisions of the script. Kotcheff requested further work be done on the script, which was performed by [[Larry Gross]] and [[David Giler]].\n\n===Pre-production===\nWhen David Morrell wrote the novel, which was published in 1972, the producers first considered [[Steve McQueen]] but then rejected him because they considered him too old to play a Vietnam veteran from 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yuddy.com/celebrity/steve-mcqueen/bio |title=Steve Mcqueen Bio |publisher=Yuddy.com |date= |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718224247/http://www.yuddy.com/celebrity/steve-mcqueen/bio |archive-date=July 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> For the role of Sheriff Teasle, the producers approached [[Academy Award]] winners [[Gene Hackman]] and [[Robert Duvall]] but both turned the part down. [[Lee Marvin]], another Oscar winner, turned down the part of Colonel Trautman. [[Kirk Douglas]] was eventually hired, but just before shooting began, Douglas quit the role of Colonel Trautman over a script dispute; Douglas wanted the film to end as the book did (Rambo and Teasle fatally wound each other, Trautman finishes Rambo with a kill shot then sits with the dying Teasle for the sheriff's final moments). [[Rock Hudson]] was approached but was soon to undergo heart surgery and had to pass up the chance to work with Stallone. Richard Crenna was quickly hired as a replacement; the role of Trautman became the veteran character actor's most famous role, his performance of which received much critical praise.<ref name=drawing/>\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot in [[British Columbia]], Canada in the winter of 1981.<ref name=drawing/> The town scenes in the movie were shot in [[Hope, British Columbia|Hope]] and the nearby [[Othello Tunnels]], called Chapman Gorge in the film,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~rgeerts/scenarioschrijven/1hope.html |title= Filming locations of First Blood in Hope, BC, Canada |publisher= |date= |accessdate= July 18, 2010}}</ref> while the rest of the movie was shot in [[Capilano Canyon]], [[Golden Ears Provincial Park]] and [[Pitt Lake]] in [[Pitt Meadows]].

It co-stars [[Richard Crenna]] and [[Brian Dennehy]], and is the first installment in the [[Rambo (franchise)|''Rambo'' franchise]], followed by ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]''.\n\nThe film is based on the 1972 novel [[First Blood (novel)|of the same name]] by [[David Morrell]]. In the film, Rambo, a troubled and misunderstood veteran, must rely on his combat and survival senses against the abusive law enforcement of the small town of Hope, [[Washington (state)|Washington]].\n\n''First Blood'' was released in the United States on October 22, 1982. Despite initial mixed reviews, the film was a box office success, grossing $125.2 million at the box office. Since its release, ''First Blood'' has received reappraisal from critics, with many praising the roles of Stallone, Dennehy, and Crenna, and recognizing it as an influential film in the action genre. The film's success spawned a franchise, consisting of four sequels (all of which were co-written by and starred Stallone), an animated television series and a series of comic books, novels, video games and a [[Bollywood]] remake.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Plot summaries are usually between 400-700 words. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. -->\nSeven years after his discharge, [[Vietnam War]] veteran [[John Rambo]] travels by foot to visit an old comrade, only to learn that his friend had died from cancer the previous year, due to [[Agent Orange]] exposure during the war.\n\nRambo continues to travel, wandering into the small town of Hope, [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. He is intercepted by the town's Sheriff, Will Teasle, who considers Rambo an unwanted nuisance. When Rambo, now in Teasle's police car, asks for directions to a diner, Teasle tells him that here is a diner 30 miles up the highway. He then drives Rambo out of the town and tells him that Portland, where Rambo had initially said he was headed, is straight ahead. Teasle then drops Rambo off and drives back towards the town. When Rambo tries to return, Teasle intercepts and arrests him on charges of [[vagrancy]], resisting arrest, and possessing a concealed knife.\n\nLed by sadistic chief deputy Art Galt, Teasle's officers abuse Rambo, triggering flashbacks of the torture he endured as a [[POW]] in [[Vietnam]]. When they try to dry-shave him with a straight razor, Rambo overwhelms the patrolmen, regains his knife, and fights his way out of the police station before stealing a motorcycle and fleeing into the woods. Teasle organizes a search party with automatic weapons, dogs, and a helicopter. Having spotted Rambo trapped on a high cliff over a creek, Galt defies orders from Teasle and attempts to shoot Rambo from the helicopter. Rambo leaps into a tree, injuring himself. With Galt still trying to shoot him, Rambo manages to throw a rock, fracturing the helicopter's windshield and causing the pilot to briefly lose control  resulting in Galt, who had removed his safety harness in order to get a better firing angle, to lose his balance and take a fatal plunge to the jagged rocks far below.\n\nRambo tries to persuade Teasle and his men that Galt's death was an accident and that he wants no more trouble, but the officers open fire and pursue him into the woods. It is then  revealed that Rambo is a former [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Beret]] and received the [[Medal of Honor]], but Teasle, bent on revenge, refuses to turn the manhunt over to the State Police. One by one, using guerrilla tactics, Rambo non-lethally disables the deputies, using both booby traps and his bare hands, until only Teasle is left. Overpowering Teasle and holding a knife to his throat, Rambo tells him he could have killed them all and he threatens to give him a war he won't beleive if Teasle does not let it go.\n\nThe state police and National Guard are called in to assist in the manhunt, while Rambo's mentor and former commanding officer Colonel [[Sam Trautman]] also arrives. Trautman confirms that Rambo is an expert at [[guerrilla warfare]] and [[Survival skills|survival]], which he honed in intensive combat in Vietnam; as such, he advises and suggests that Rambo be allowed to slip through the perimeter and escape to the next town - thereby diffusing the situation - then be permitted to surrender peacefully later. Confident that Rambo is hopelessly outnumbered, Teasle refuses. Teasle allows Trautman to contact Rambo \u2013 on a police radio he stole while escaping \u2013 and try to persuade him to surrender peacefully. Rambo recognizes Trautman's voice but refuses to give up, condemning Teasle and his deputies for their abuse and noting \"they drew first blood,\" before hanging up.\n\nTrying to slip through the cordon, Rambo is surprised by a young boy out hunting; he overpowers but refuses to harm the boy, who alerts the pursuers. A National Guard detachment corners Rambo at the entrance of an abandoned mine. Against orders, they use a rocket, collapsing the entrance and seemingly killing Rambo. He survives and finds another way out, hijacking a supply truck carrying an [[M60 machine gun]] and ammunition and returning to town. To distract his pursuers, he blows up a gas station, shoots out most of the town's power, and destroys a gun store near the police station. Trautman, knowing that the sheriff is no match for Rambo, tries to convince Teasle to escape, but is ignored.\n\nRambo spots Teasle on the police station's roof and they engage in a brief gunfight, ending with Teasle shot and falling through a skylight. As Rambo prepares to kill him, Trautman appears and warns Rambo that he will be shot if he does not surrender, reminding him he is the last survivor of his elite unit of Green Berets. Rambo collapses in tears and talks about his experience in Vietnam and after his return. Teasle is transported to a hospital, while Rambo surrenders to Trautman after being comforted and validated.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Rambo characters}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[John Rambo|John J.

He only returned to work on ''First Blood'' after [[Mario Kassar]] and [[Andrew G. Vajna]] of Anabasis Investments offered to finance one of his projects. Kotcheff offered the role of John Rambo to Sylvester Stallone, and the actor accepted after reading the script through a weekend.<ref name=drawing>{{cite video|title=Drawing First Blood|location=''First Blood'' DVD|date=2002|publisher=Artisan}}</ref> Various scripts adapted from Morrell's book had been pitched to studios in the years since its publication, but it was only when Stallone decided to become involved with the project that it was finally brought into production. Stallone's star power after the success of the [[Rocky (film series)|''Rocky'' films]] enabled him to rewrite the script to make the character of John Rambo more sympathetic. While Morrell's book has the Rambo character kill many of his pursuers, and Kozoll and Sackheim's draft had him killing sixteen people, in the movie Rambo does not directly cause the death of any police or national guardsmen. Stallone also decided to let Rambo survive the film instead of keeping the book's ending where he dies. A suicide scene was filmed but Kotcheff and Stallone opted to have Rambo turn himself in at Trautman's urging.<ref name=drawing/> Stallone did an estimated seven revisions of the script. Kotcheff requested further work be done on the script, which was performed by [[Larry Gross]] and [[David Giler]].\n\n===Pre-production===\nWhen David Morrell wrote the novel, which was published in 1972, the producers first considered [[Steve McQueen]] but then rejected him because they considered him too old to play a Vietnam veteran from 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yuddy.com/celebrity/steve-mcqueen/bio |title=Steve Mcqueen Bio |publisher=Yuddy.com |date= |accessdate=July 18, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718224247/http://www.yuddy.com/celebrity/steve-mcqueen/bio |archive-date=July 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> For the role of Sheriff Teasle, the producers approached [[Academy Award]] winners [[Gene Hackman]] and [[Robert Duvall]] but both turned the part down. [[Lee Marvin]], another Oscar winner, turned down the part of Colonel Trautman. [[Kirk Douglas]] was eventually hired, but just before shooting began, Douglas quit the role of Colonel Trautman over a script dispute; Douglas wanted the film to end as the book did (Rambo and Teasle fatally wound each other, Trautman finishes Rambo with a kill shot then sits with the dying Teasle for the sheriff's final moments). [[Rock Hudson]] was approached but was soon to undergo heart surgery and had to pass up the chance to work with Stallone. Richard Crenna was quickly hired as a replacement; the role of Trautman became the veteran character actor's most famous role, his performance of which received much critical praise.<ref name=drawing/>\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot in [[British Columbia]], Canada in the winter of 1981.<ref name=drawing/> The town scenes in the movie were shot in [[Hope, British Columbia|Hope]] and the nearby [[Othello Tunnels]], called Chapman Gorge in the film,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~rgeerts/scenarioschrijven/1hope.html |title= Filming locations of First Blood in Hope, BC, Canada |publisher= |date= |accessdate= July 18, 2010}}</ref> while the rest of the movie was shot in [[Capilano Canyon]], [[Golden Ears Provincial Park]] and [[Pitt Lake]] in [[Pitt Meadows]].

Sam scoffs at his brother's story despite the clown disappearing from the shop when they leave, and Sam later lies to their mom saying that Mike was not looking after him. The night continues with only Sam seeing the clown in his house which his brother dismisses as nonsense saying he made up the story. Sam goes to sleep only to awaken into a nightmare of torment by the Crimson Clown who calls him a bad kid. He eventually breaks down and pleads with the clown to give him another chance repeating his apologies. Sam awakens from his nightmare and is called downstairs by his brother Mike who presents the perfect birthday gift to their tearful happy mom. The Crimson Clown had given Sam his second chance through an alternative set of events.\n*{{Italics colon|Storyteller}} '''Gary'''\n*{{Italics colon|Notable cast}} [[Michael Barry (actor)|Michael Barry]] as ''Sam''\n| LineColor       = 216424\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 39\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n| Title           = The Tale of the Dangerous Soup\n| DirectedBy      = D.J.

He applies for a job at a restaurant where he meets a waitress names Nonnie, and the head chef named Dr. Vink. who makes a hugely popular dish at the restaurant called \"The Dangerous Soup\". One evening after hours the two hear screaming coming from a waitress trapped in a freezer. Vink is confronted by Reed and Nonnie where he is forced to reveal the secret ingredient of the soup after releasing the dazed waitress. He admits that he uses a creature in an empty freezer to gain the essence of fear from those trapped inside. Vink then uses the essence in the soup as a desired element. Vink invites Reed inside knowing he is afraid of \"nothing\" while Nonnie watches from outside. When Reed is faced with his true fear and starts screaming, Nonnie opens the door unknowingly letting the creature out. The two are then forced to face their fears in getting the creature back into the freezer again.

Such near-continuous innervation can be thought of as a \"default\" or \"steady state\" condition for muscles. Both the [[Extension (kinesiology)|extensor]] and [[flexion|flexor]] muscles are involved in the maintenance of a constant tone while at rest. In skeletal muscles, this helps maintain a normal posture.\n\nResting muscle tone varies along a bell shaped curve.  Low tone is perceived as \"lax, flabby, floppy, mushy, dead weight\" and high tone is perceived as \"tight, light, strong\".  Muscles with high tone are not necessarily strong and muscles with low tone are not necessarily weak.  In general,  low tone does increase flexibility and decrease strength and high tone does decrease flexibility and increase strength, but with many exceptions.  A person with low tone will most likely not be able to engage in \"explosive\" movement such as needed in a sprinter or high jumper.  These athletes usually have high tone that is within normal limits. A person with high tone will usually not be flexible in activities such as dance and yoga.  Joint laxity contributes greatly to flexibility, especially with flexibility in one or a few areas, instead of overall flexibility.\n\nFor example, a person can be high tone with normal to poor flexibility in most areas, but be able to put the palms of the hands on the floor with straight knees due to hypermobile sacroiliac joints.{{cn|date=April 2017}} It is important to assess several areas before deciding if a person has high, low or normal muscle tone.  A fairly reliable assessment item is how the person feels when picked up.{{cn|date=May 2017}}  For example,  small children with low tone can feel heavy while larger, high tone children feel light, which corresponds with the description of \"dead weight\".\n\nAlthough [[cardiac muscle]] and [[smooth muscle]] are not directly connected to the skeleton, they also have tonus in the sense that although their contractions are not matched with those of antagonist muscles, the non-contractile state is characterized by (sometimes random) enervation.\n\n==Pathological tonus==\nPhysical disorders can result in abnormally low ([[hypotonia]]) or high ([[hypertonia]]) muscle tone. Another form of hypertonia is [[paratonia]], which is associated with [[dementia]]. Hypotonia is seen in lower motor neuron disease like [[poliomyelitis]]. Hypotonia can present clinically as muscle [[Flaccid paralysis|flaccidity]], where the limbs appear floppy, [[stretch reflex]] responses are decreased, and the limb's resistance to passive movement is also decreased.<ref name = osullivan/> Hypertonia is seen in upper motor neuron diseases like lesions in pyramidal tract and extrapyramidal tract. Hypertonia can present clinically as either [[spasticity]] or [[Rigidity (neurology)|rigidity]]. While [[spasticity]] is velocity-dependent resistance to passive stretch (i.e. passively moving an elbow quickly will elicit increased muscle tone, but passively moving elbow slowly may not elicit increased muscle tone), [[Rigidity (neurology)|rigidity]] is velocity-independent resistance to passive stretch (i.e. there is uniform increased tone whether the elbow is passively moved quickly or slowly).<ref name=osullivan/>\n[[Spasticity]] can be in the form of the [[clasp-knife response]], in which there is increased resistance only at the beginning or at the end of the movement. Rigidity can be of the leadpipe type, in which there is resistance throughout to passive movement, or it may be of cogwheel type, in which the resistance to passive movement is in a jerky manner.\n\n===Tonus in surgery===\nIn [[ophthalmology]], tonus may be a central consideration in [[eye surgery]], as in the manipulation of [[extraocular muscle]]s to repair [[strabismus]]. Tonicity aberrations are associated with many diseases of the eye (e.g. [[Adie syndrome]]).{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n \n===Cramps===\n\nNormally, people are unaware of their muscle tone in their daily activities. The body maintains the balance between the tone of flexor and extensor muscle groups. Sometimes, in normal, healthy people, that tone is lost either in flexors or extensor muscle groups in isolation, temporarily and intermittently resulting in \"muscle cramps\". Treating these extensor or flexor group of muscles in isolation to relax can be difficult. Generally, [[muscle relaxants]] or [[quinine]] can help with cramps and is warranted when they become troublesome. But these medication cause their relaxing effect in both groups by moderating their tone. The cause of disproportionate intermittent contractions of either flexors or extensors or the cause of cramps is unknown. The stimulus for these \"cramps\" may originate in the cerebral cortex, the spinal cord, or the muscle itself. This could indicate developing pathology or other problems in the future.\n\n== See also==\n*[[GHK current equation]]\n*[[Nernst\u2013Planck equation]]\n*[[Hodgkin\u2013Huxley model]]\n*[[Hindmarsh\u2013Rose model]]\n*[[Muscle weakness]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/body/factfiles/tone/adductor_animation.shtml BBC series on muscles]\n\n{{Musculoskeletal physiology}}\n\n[[Category:Muscular system]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Continuous and passive partial contraction of the muscles}}\n{{for|the use of the term \"tone\" in weight training and bodybuilding|Toning exercises}}\n{{One source|date=June 2013}}\nIn [[physiology]], [[medicine]], and [[anatomy]], '''muscle tone''' ('''residual muscle tension''' or '''tonus''') is the continuous and passive partial [[muscle contraction|contraction of the muscles]], or the muscle's resistance to passive stretch during resting state.<ref name=osullivan>O\u2019Sullivan, S.

In skeletal muscles, this helps maintain a normal posture.\n\nResting muscle tone varies along a bell shaped curve.  Low tone is perceived as \"lax, flabby, floppy, mushy, dead weight\" and high tone is perceived as \"tight, light, strong\".  Muscles with high tone are not necessarily strong and muscles with low tone are not necessarily weak.  In general,  low tone does increase flexibility and decrease strength and high tone does decrease flexibility and increase strength, but with many exceptions.  A person with low tone will most likely not be able to engage in \"explosive\" movement such as needed in a sprinter or high jumper.  These athletes usually have high tone that is within normal limits. A person with high tone will usually not be flexible in activities such as dance and yoga.  Joint laxity contributes greatly to flexibility, especially with flexibility in one or a few areas, instead of overall flexibility.\n\nFor example, a person can be high tone with normal to poor flexibility in most areas, but be able to put the palms of the hands on the floor with straight knees due to hypermobile sacroiliac joints.{{cn|date=April 2017}} It is important to assess several areas before deciding if a person has high, low or normal muscle tone.  A fairly reliable assessment item is how the person feels when picked up.{{cn|date=May 2017}}  For example,  small children with low tone can feel heavy while larger, high tone children feel light, which corresponds with the description of \"dead weight\".\n\nAlthough [[cardiac muscle]] and [[smooth muscle]] are not directly connected to the skeleton, they also have tonus in the sense that although their contractions are not matched with those of antagonist muscles, the non-contractile state is characterized by (sometimes random) enervation.\n\n==Pathological tonus==\nPhysical disorders can result in abnormally low ([[hypotonia]]) or high ([[hypertonia]]) muscle tone. Another form of hypertonia is [[paratonia]], which is associated with [[dementia]]. Hypotonia is seen in lower motor neuron disease like [[poliomyelitis]]. Hypotonia can present clinically as muscle [[Flaccid paralysis|flaccidity]], where the limbs appear floppy, [[stretch reflex]] responses are decreased, and the limb's resistance to passive movement is also decreased.<ref name = osullivan/> Hypertonia is seen in upper motor neuron diseases like lesions in pyramidal tract and extrapyramidal tract. Hypertonia can present clinically as either [[spasticity]] or [[Rigidity (neurology)|rigidity]]. While [[spasticity]] is velocity-dependent resistance to passive stretch (i.e. passively moving an elbow quickly will elicit increased muscle tone, but passively moving elbow slowly may not elicit increased muscle tone), [[Rigidity (neurology)|rigidity]] is velocity-independent resistance to passive stretch (i.e. there is uniform increased tone whether the elbow is passively moved quickly or slowly).<ref name=osullivan/>\n[[Spasticity]] can be in the form of the [[clasp-knife response]], in which there is increased resistance only at the beginning or at the end of the movement. Rigidity can be of the leadpipe type, in which there is resistance throughout to passive movement, or it may be of cogwheel type, in which the resistance to passive movement is in a jerky manner.\n\n===Tonus in surgery===\nIn [[ophthalmology]], tonus may be a central consideration in [[eye surgery]], as in the manipulation of [[extraocular muscle]]s to repair [[strabismus]]. Tonicity aberrations are associated with many diseases of the eye (e.g. [[Adie syndrome]]).{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n \n===Cramps===\n\nNormally, people are unaware of their muscle tone in their daily activities. The body maintains the balance between the tone of flexor and extensor muscle groups. Sometimes, in normal, healthy people, that tone is lost either in flexors or extensor muscle groups in isolation, temporarily and intermittently resulting in \"muscle cramps\". Treating these extensor or flexor group of muscles in isolation to relax can be difficult. Generally, [[muscle relaxants]] or [[quinine]] can help with cramps and is warranted when they become troublesome. But these medication cause their relaxing effect in both groups by moderating their tone. The cause of disproportionate intermittent contractions of either flexors or extensors or the cause of cramps is unknown. The stimulus for these \"cramps\" may originate in the cerebral cortex, the spinal cord, or the muscle itself. This could indicate developing pathology or other problems in the future.\n\n== See also==\n*[[GHK current equation]]\n*[[Nernst\u2013Planck equation]]\n*[[Hodgkin\u2013Huxley model]]\n*[[Hindmarsh\u2013Rose model]]\n*[[Muscle weakness]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/body/factfiles/tone/adductor_animation.shtml BBC series on muscles]\n\n{{Musculoskeletal physiology}}\n\n[[Category:Muscular system]]\n", "name_user": "2601:143:8080:2e0:301a:740a:eb72:7de6", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_tone"}

The original model was part of a series of 16/32- and 32-bit computers that featured 256 KB or more of RAM, mouse-based GUIs, and significantly improved graphics and audio over 8-bit systems. This wave included the [[Atari ST]]&mdash;released the same year&mdash;Apple's [[Macintosh]], and later the [[Apple IIGS]]. Based on the [[Motorola 68000 series|Motorola 68000]] [[microprocessor]], the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound, including [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] and a [[blitter]], and a [[pre-emptive multitasking]] operating system called [[AmigaOS]].\n\nThe [[Amiga 1000]] was released in July 1985, but a series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986. The best selling model, the [[Amiga 500]], was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold.<ref name=\"reimer\" /> The [[Amiga 3000|A3000]] was introduced in 1990, followed by the [[Amiga 500 Plus|A500+]], and the [[Amiga 600|A600]] in March 1992. Finally, the [[Amiga 1200|A1200]] and the [[Amiga 4000|A4000]] were released in late 1992. The platform became particularly popular for gaming and [[demo (computer programming)|programming demo]]s. It also found a prominent role in the [[desktop video]], [[video production]], and [[show control]] business, leading to video editing systems such as the [[Video Toaster]]. The Amiga's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early [[Music tracker|tracker]] music software. The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory enabled the development of 3D rendering packages, including [[LightWave 3D]], [[Imagine (3D modeling software)|Imagine]], [[Aladdin4D]], [[TurboSilver]] and Traces, a predecessor to [[Blender (software)|Blender]].\n\nAlthough early Commodore advertisements attempt to cast the computer as an all-purpose business machine, especially when outfitted with the [[Amiga Sidecar]] PC compatibility add-on, the Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer, with a wide range of games and creative software.<ref name=\"ad1987a\" /><ref name=\"ad1987b\" /> Poor marketing and the failure of the later models to repeat the technological advances of the first systems meant that the Amiga quickly lost its market share to competing platforms, such as the [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|fourth generation game consoles]], Macintosh, and the rapidly dropping prices of [[IBM PC compatible]]s, which gained 256-color VGA graphics in 1987.<ref name=\"reimer\" /> Commodore ultimately went bankrupt in April 1994 after a version of the Amiga packaged as a game console, the [[Amiga CD32]], failed in the marketplace.\n\nSince the demise of Commodore, various groups have marketed successors to the original Amiga line, including [[Genesi]], [[Eyetech]], [[ACube Systems Srl]] and A-EON Technology. Likewise, AmigaOS has influenced replacements, clones and compatible systems such as [[MorphOS]], [[AmigaOS 4]] and [[AROS Research Operating System|AROS]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Amiga}}\n\n{{quote\n| \"The Amiga was so far ahead of its time that almost nobody\u2014including Commodore's marketing department\u2014could fully articulate what it was all about. Today, it's obvious the Amiga was the first multimedia computer, but in those days it was derided as a game machine because few people grasped the importance of advanced graphics, sound, and video. Nine years later, vendors are still struggling to make systems that work like 1985 Amigas.\"\n| ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'', August 1994\n}}\n\n===Concept and early development===\n[[Jay Miner]] joined [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]] in the 1970s to develop custom [[integrated circuit]]s, and led development of the [[Atari 2600]]'s [[Television Interface Adaptor|TIA]].<ref name=p1p3>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/07/a-history-of-the-amiga-part-1/3/ |title=A history of the Amiga, part 1: Genesis |website=Ars Technica |first=Jeremy |last=Reimer |date=3 July 2007 |access-date=14 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704114247/https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/07/a-history-of-the-amiga-part-1/3/ |archive-date=4 July 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Almost as soon as its development was complete, the team began developing a much more sophisticated set of chips, [[CTIA and GTIA|CTIA]], [[ANTIC]] and [[POKEY]], that formed the basis of the [[Atari 8-bit family]].<ref name=p1p4>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/07/a-history-of-the-amiga-part-1/4/ |title=A history of the Amiga, part 1: Genesis |website=Ars Technica |first=Jeremy |last=Reimer |date=3 July 2007 |access-date=14 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704114244/https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/07/a-history-of-the-amiga-part-1/4/ |archive-date=4 July 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nWith the 8-bit line's launch in 1979, the team once again started looking at a next generation chipset. [[Nolan Bushnell]] had sold the company to [[WarnerMedia|Warner Communications]] in 1978, and the new management was much more interested in the existing lines than development of new products that might cut into their sales. Miner wanted to start work with the new [[Motorola 68000]], but management was only interested in another [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] based system. Miner left the company, and, for a time, the industry.<ref name=p1p4/>\n\nIn 1979, [[Larry Kaplan]] left Atari and founded [[Activision]]. In 1982, Kaplan was approached by a number of investors who wanted to develop a new game platform. Kaplan hired Miner to run the hardware side of the newly formed company, \"Hi-Toro\". The system was code-named \"Lorraine\" in keeping with Miner's policy of giving systems female names, in this case the company president's wife, Lorraine Morse.<ref name=\"AutoP5-1\" /> When Kaplan left the company late in 1982, Miner was promoted to head engineer<ref name=p1p4/> and the company relaunched as Amiga Corporation.<ref>''New York Times'', 29 August 1984, p. D1</ref>\n\nA breadboard prototype was largely completed by late 1983, and shown at the January 1984 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES). At the time, the operating system was not ready, so the machine was demonstrated with the [[Demo (computer programming)#The bouncing ball|Boing Ball demo]]. A further developed version of the system was demonstrated at the June 1984 CES and shown to many companies in hopes of garnering further funding, but found little interest in a market that was in the final stages of the [[North American video game crash of 1983]].<ref name=\"AutoP5-1\" /><ref name=\"AutoP5-2\" />\n\nIn March, Atari expressed a tepid interest in Lorraine for its potential use in a games console or home computer tentatively known as the 1850XLD. But the talks were progressing slowly,<ref>''New York Times'', 29 August 1984, p. D16</ref> and Amiga was running out of money. A temporary arrangement in June led to a $500,000 loan from Atari to Amiga to keep the company going. The terms required the loan to be repaid at the end of the month, otherwise Amiga would forfeit the Lorraine design to Atari.<ref name=p3p3/>\n\n===Commodore launch===\nDuring 1983, Atari lost over $1 million a week, due to the combined effects of the crash and the ongoing price war in the home computer market. By the end of the year, Warner was desperate to sell the company. In January 1984, [[Jack Tramiel]] resigned from Commodore due to internal battles over the future direction of the company. A number of Commodore employees followed him to his new company, [[Atari Corporation|Tramel Technology]]. This included a number of the senior technical staff, where they began development of a 68000-based machine of their own. In June, Tramiel arranged a no-cash deal to take over Atari, reforming it as Atari Corporation.\n\nAs many Commodore technical staff had moved to Atari, Commodore was left with no workable path to design their own next-generation computer. The company approached Amiga offering to fund development as a home computer system. They quickly arranged to repay the Atari loan, ending that threat. The two companies were initially arranging a $4 million license agreement before Commodore offered $24 million to purchase Amiga outright.<ref name=p3p3>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/08/a-history-of-the-amiga-part-3/3/ |title=A history of the Amiga, part 3: The first prototype |website=Ars Technica |first=Jeremy |last=Reimer |date=21 August 2007 |access-date=14 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704102904/https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/08/a-history-of-the-amiga-part-3/3/ |archive-date=4 July 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBy late 1984 the prototype breadboard chipset had successfully been turned into integrated circuits, and the system hardware was being readied for production. At this time the [[operating system]] (OS) was not as ready, and led to a deal to port an OS known as [[TRIPOS]] to the platform. TRIPOS was a [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] system that had been written in [[BCPL]] during the 1970s for [[minicomputer]] systems like the [[PDP-11]], but later experimentally ported to the 68000. This early version was known as AmigaDOS and the GUI as Workbench. The BCPL parts were later rewritten in the [[C (programming language)|C]] language, and the entire system became AmigaOS.\n\nThe system was enclosed in a [[pizza box form factor]] case; a late change was the introduction of vertical supports on either side of the case to provide a \"garage\" under the main section of the system where the keyboard could be stored.<ref name=p5p1>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/10/amiga-history-4-commodore-years/2/ |title=A history of the Amiga, part 4: Enter Commodore |website=Ars Technica |first=Jeremy |last=Reimer |date=10 December 2007 |access-date=14 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704100028/https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/10/amiga-history-4-commodore-years/2/ |archive-date=4 July 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe first model was announced in 1985 as simply \"The Amiga from Commodore\", later to be retroactively dubbed the [[Amiga 1000]].{{efn|The name \"Amiga\" was chosen because it is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for ''(female) friend'', and alphabetically it appears before Apple in lists of computer makers.

These models incorporated a series of technical upgrades known as the [[Amiga Enhanced Chip Set|ECS]] and [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]], which added higher resolution displays among many other improvements and simplifications.\n\nUltimately the Amiga line would sell an estimated 4,850,000 machines over its lifetime.

They re-released the A1200 and A4000T, and introduced a new [[Motorola 68060|68060]] version of the A4000T. Amiga Technologies researched and developed the [[Amiga Walker]] prototype. They presented the machine publicly at CeBit. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amigareport.com/ar405/news13.html|title=The Amiga Walker Prototype|website=www.amigareport.com|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> Escom, in turn, went bankrupt in 1997. \n\nThe Amiga brand was then sold to a U.S. [[Wintel]] PC manufacturer, [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway 2000]], which had announced grand plans for it. In 2000, however, Gateway sold the Amiga brand without having released any products. The current owner of the trademark, [[Amiga, Inc.]], licensed the rights to sell hardware using either the Amiga or [[AmigaOne]] brand to [[Eyetech|Eyetech Group]], [[Hyperion Entertainment]] and [[Commodore USA]].\n\n== Hardware ==\n[[File:Amiga 1000 computer.jpg|thumb|[[Amiga 1000]]]]\n[[File:Amiga 600.jpg|thumb|[[Amiga 600]]]]\n[[File:Amiga 1200 with mouse, drives.jpg|thumb|[[Amiga 1200]]]]\n[[File:Amiga-CD32-wController-L.jpg|thumb|[[Amiga CD32]]]]\n[[File:Deluxe Paint for Amiga.jpg|thumb|Amiga diskette containing the [[Deluxe Paint]] bitmap graphics editing program]]\nAt its core, the Amiga has a custom chipset consisting of several [[coprocessor]]s, which handle audio, video and [[direct memory access]] independently of the [[Central processing unit|Central Processing Unit]] (CPU). This architecture freed up the Amiga's processor for other tasks and gave the Amiga a performance edge over its competitors, particularly in terms of video-intensive applications and games.<ref name=\"amiga_hardware_ref\" />\n\nThe general Amiga architecture uses two distinct [[bus (computing)|bus]] subsystems, namely, the chipset bus and the CPU bus. The chipset bus allows the custom coprocessors and CPU to address [[Amiga Chip RAM|\"Chip RAM\"]]. The CPU bus provides addressing to other subsystems, such as conventional RAM, ROM and the [[Amiga Zorro II|Zorro II]] or [[Amiga Zorro III|Zorro III]] expansion subsystems. This architecture enables independent operation of the subsystems; the CPU \"Fast\" bus can be much faster than the chipset bus. CPU expansion boards may provide additional custom buses. Additionally, \"busboards\" or \"bridgeboards\" may provide [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] or [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] buses.<ref name=\"amiga_hardware_ref\" />\n\n=== Central processing unit ===\nThe [[Motorola]] [[Motorola 68000 family|68000]] series of microprocessors was used in all Amiga models from Commodore. While all CPU in the 68000 family have a [[32-bit]] [[Instruction Set Architecture|ISA]] design (programmer uses and sees a 32-bit model), the MC68000 used in the most popular models is a [[16-bit]] (or 16/32-bit) processor because its [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] operates in 16-bit (32-bit operations require additional clock cycles, consuming more time).<ref name=\"AutoP5-4\" /><ref name=\"AutoP5-5\" /> The MC68000 has a 16-bit external [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] so 32-bits of data is transferred in two consecutive steps, a technique called [[multiplexing]]. This is transparent to the software, which was 32-bit from the beginning. The MC68000 can address 16&nbsp;MB of physical memory. Later Amiga models featured higher-speed, full 32-bit CPUs with a larger address space and [[Instruction pipelining|instruction pipeline]] facilities.\n\nCPU upgrades were offered by both Commodore and third-party manufacturers. Most Amiga models can be upgraded either by direct CPU replacement or through expansion boards. Such boards often featured faster and higher capacity memory interfaces and [[hard disk drive|hard disk]] controllers.\n\nTowards the end of Commodore's time in charge of Amiga development, there were suggestions that Commodore intended to move away from the 68000 series to higher performance [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] processors, such as the [[PA-RISC]].<ref name=\"actuator\" /><ref name=\"Haynie\" /> Those ideas were never developed before Commodore filed for bankruptcy. Despite this, third-party manufacturers designed upgrades featuring a combination of 68000 series and PowerPC processors along with a PowerPC native [[microkernel]] and software.<ref name=\"AutoP5-6\" /><ref name=\"AutoP5-7\" /> Later Amiga clones featured [[PowerPC]] processors only.\n\n=== Custom chipset ===\nThe custom chipset at the core of the Amiga design appeared in three distinct generations, with a large degree of backward-compatibility. The [[Original Chip Set]] (OCS) appeared with the launch of the A1000 in 1985. OCS was eventually followed by the modestly improved [[Amiga Enhanced Chip Set|Enhanced Chip Set]] (ECS) in 1990 and finally by the partly 32-bit [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|Advanced Graphics Architecture]] (AGA) in 1992. Each chipset consists of several coprocessors that handle [[blitter|graphics acceleration]], digital audio, [[direct memory access]] and communication between various peripherals (e.g., CPU, memory and floppy disks). In addition, some models featured auxiliary [[Amiga custom chips|custom chip]]s that performed tasks such as [[SCSI]] control and display de-interlacing.\n\n==== Graphics ====\n[[File:HAM6example.png|thumb|A 4096 color [[Hold-And-Modify|HAM]] picture created with [[Photon Paint]] in 1989]]\n\nAll Amiga systems can display full-screen animated graphics with 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 ([[Amiga Halfbrite mode|EHB Mode]]), or 4096 colors ([[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM Mode]]). Models with the AGA chipset (A1200 and A4000) also have non-EHB 64, 128, 256, and {{nowrap|262144}} ([[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM8 Mode]]) color modes and a palette expanded from 4096 to [[24-bit color|16.8 million colors]].\n\nThe Amiga chipset can ''[[genlock]]'', which is the ability to adjust its own screen refresh timing to match an incoming NTSC or PAL video signal. When combined with setting transparency, this allows an Amiga to overlay an external video source with graphics. This ability made the Amiga popular for many applications, and provides the ability to do [[Character generator|character generation]] and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects far more cheaply than earlier systems. This ability has been frequently utilized by wedding videographers, TV stations and their weather forecasting divisions (for weather graphics and radar), advertising channels, music video production, and desktop videographers. The [[NewTek]] [[Video Toaster]] was made possible by the genlock ability of the Amiga.\n\nIn 1988, the release of the Amiga A2024 fixed-frequency [[monochrome]] monitor with built-in [[framebuffer]] and flicker fixer hardware provided the Amiga with a choice of high-resolution graphic modes (1024\u00d7800 for NTSC and 1024\u00d71024 for PAL).<ref name=\"AutoP5-8\" />\n\n==== ReTargetable Graphics ====\n{{main|ReTargetable Graphics}}\n\nReTargetable Graphics is an [[application programming interface|API]] for [[device driver]]s mainly used by 3rd party graphics hardware to interface with AmigaOS via a set of [[library (computing)|libraries]]. The software libraries may include software tools to adjust [[Display resolution|resolution]], screen colors, [[Cursor (computers)#Mouse cursor|pointers]] and screenmodes. The standard [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition interface]] is limited to [[color depth|display depths]] of [[8-bit]]s, while RTG makes it possible to handle higher depths like [[24-bit]]s.\n\n==== Sound ====\nThe sound chip, named Paula, supports four [[pulse-code modulation|PCM]]-sample-based sound channels (two for the left speaker and two for the right) with 8-bit resolution for each channel and a 6-bit volume control per channel. The analog output is connected to a low-pass filter, which filters out high-frequency aliases when the Amiga is using a lower sampling rate (see [[Nyquist frequency]]). The brightness of the Amiga's power LED is used to indicate the status of the Amiga's low-pass filter. The filter is active when the LED is at normal brightness, and deactivated when dimmed (or off on older A500 Amigas). On Amiga 1000 (and first Amiga 500 and Amiga 2000 model), the power LED had no relation to the filter's status, and a wire needed to be manually soldered between pins on the sound chip to disable the filter. Paula can read directly from the system's [[Random-access memory|RAM]], using direct memory access (DMA), making sound playback without CPU intervention possible.\n\nAlthough the hardware is limited to four separate sound channels, software such as ''[[OctaMED]]'' uses software mixing to allow eight or more virtual channels, and it was possible for software to mix two hardware channels to achieve a single 14-bit resolution channel by playing with the volumes of the channels in such a way that one of the source channels contributes the most significant bits and the other the least.\n\nThe quality of the Amiga's sound output, and the fact that the hardware is ubiquitous and easily addressed by software, were standout features of Amiga hardware unavailable on PC platforms for years. Third-party sound cards exist that provide [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] functions, multi-track [[direct-to-disk recording]], multiple hardware sound channels and 16-bit and beyond resolutions. A retargetable sound API called [[AHI (Amiga)|AHI]] was developed allowing these cards to be used transparently by the [[Operating system|OS]] and software.\n\n=== Kickstart firmware ===\n{{Main|Kickstart (Amiga)}}\n\nKickstart is the [[firmware]] upon which AmigaOS is [[booting|bootstrap]]ped. Its purpose is to initialize the Amiga hardware and core components of AmigaOS and then attempt to boot from a [[Booting|bootable]] [[volume (computing)|volume]], such as a floppy disk or hard disk drive. Most models (excluding the Amiga 1000) come equipped with Kickstart on an embedded [[Read-only memory|ROM-chip]].\n\n=== Keyboard and mouse ===\n[[File:Amiga Mouse.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Amiga mouse]]\n\nThe keyboard on Amiga computers is similar to that found on a mid 80s IBM PC: Ten function keys, a numeric keypad, and four separate directional arrow keys. Caps Lock and Control share space to the left of A. Missing are the Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys: These are accomplished on Amigas by pressing shift and the appropriate arrow key. The Amiga keyboard adds a Help key, which a function key usually acts as on PCs (usually F1). In addition to the Control and Alt modifier keys, the Amiga has 2 'Amiga' keys, rendered as 'Open Amiga' and 'Closed Amiga' similar to the Open/Closed Apple logo keys on Apple II keyboards. The left is used to manipulate the operating system (moving screens and the like) and the right delivered commands to the application. The absence of Num lock frees space for more math symbols around the number pad. Contemporary Macintosh computers, for comparison, lack function keys completely.\n\nThe mouse has two buttons like Windows, but unlike Windows pressing and holding the right button replaces the system [[Status bar|status line]] at the top of the screen with a Maclike [[menu bar]]. As with Apple's [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] prior to [[Mac OS 8]], menu options are selected by releasing the button over that option, not by left clicking. Menu items that have a boolean toggle state can be left clicked whilst the menu is kept open with the right button, which allows the user \u2013 for example \u2013 to set some selected text to bold, underline and italics all at once.\n\nThe mouse plugs into one of two [[Atari joystick port]]s used for [[joystick]]s, [[Paddle (game controller)|game paddles]], and [[graphics tablet]]s. Although compatible with [[analog stick|analog joystick]]s, Atari-style digital joysticks became standard.<ref name=\"anderson198710\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1987-10-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_089_1987_Oct#page/n17/mode/2up | title=Close Up: The Amiga 500 | work=Compute! | date=October 1987 | accessdate=18 January 2015 | author=Anderson, Rhett | pages=16\u201319 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204185248/http://archive.org/stream/1987-10-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_089_1987_Oct#page/n17/mode/2up | archive-date=4 December 2014 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Other peripherals and expansions ===\n[[File:Amiga Sound Sampling Hardware.jpg|thumb|upright|8-bit sound sampling hardware for the Amiga]]\n\nThe Amiga was one of the first computers for which inexpensive sound sampling and video digitization accessories were available. As a result of this and the Amiga's audio and video capabilities, the Amiga became a popular system for editing and producing both music and video.\n\nMany expansion boards were produced for Amiga computers to improve the performance and capability of the hardware, such as memory expansions, [[SCSI]] controllers, CPU boards, and graphics boards. Other upgrades include [[genlock]]s, network cards for [[Ethernet]], [[modem]]s, [[sound card]]s and samplers, [[Video capture|video digitizers]], extra [[serial port]]s, and [[Parallel ATA|IDE]] controllers. Additions after the demise of Commodore company are [[USB]] cards. The most popular upgrades were memory, SCSI controllers and CPU accelerator cards. These were sometimes combined into the one device.\n\nEarly CPU accelerator cards feature full 32-bit CPUs of the 68000 family such as the [[Motorola 68020]] and [[Motorola 68030]], almost always with 32-bit memory and usually with [[Floating-point unit|FPUs]] and [[Memory management unit|MMUs]] or the facility to add them. Later designs feature the [[Motorola 68040]] or [[Motorola 68060]]. Both CPUs feature integrated FPUs and MMUs. Many CPU accelerator cards also had integrated SCSI controllers.\n\nPhase5 designed the [[PowerUP (accelerator)|PowerUP]] boards ([[Blizzard PPC]] and [[PowerUP (accelerator)#Cyberstorm PPC|CyberStorm PPC]]) featuring both a 68k (a 68040 or 68060) and a PowerPC (603 or 604) CPU, which are able to run the two CPUs at the same time and share the system memory. The PowerPC CPU on PowerUP boards is usually used as a coprocessor for heavy computations; a powerful CPU is needed to run [[MAME]] for example, but even decoding [[JPEG]] pictures and [[MP3]] audio was considered heavy computation at the time. It is also possible to ignore the 68k CPU and run [[Linux]] on the PPC via project Linux APUS, but a PowerPC-native AmigaOS promised by Amiga Technologies GmbH was not available when the PowerUP boards first appeared.<ref name=\"AutoP5-9\" />\n\n24-bit graphics cards and video cards were also available. Graphics cards were designed primarily for 2D artwork production, workstation use, and later, gaming. Video cards are designed for inputting and outputting video signals, and processing and manipulating video.\n\nIn the North American market, the ''NewTek [[Video Toaster]]'' was a video effects board that turned the Amiga into an affordable video processing computer that found its way into many professional video environments. One well-known use was to create the special effects in early series of ''[[Babylon 5]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geek.com/games/cgi-first-introduced-to-tv-in-babylon-5-by-mit-presentor-771051/ |work=geek.com |title=CGI first introduced to TV in Babylon 5 by MIT presentor {{sic|nolink=y}} |access-date=2014-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222172408/http://www.geek.com/games/cgi-first-introduced-to-tv-in-babylon-5-by-mit-presentor-771051/ |archive-date=2014-02-22 |url-status=live }}</ref> Due to its [[NTSC]]-only design, it did not find a market in countries that used the [[PAL]] standard, such as in Europe. In those countries, the ''OpalVision'' card was popular, although less featured and supported than the Video Toaster. Low-cost [[Time base correction|time base correctors]] (TBC) specifically designed to work with the Toaster quickly came to market, most of which were designed as standard Amiga bus cards.\n\nVarious manufacturers started producing PCI busboards for the A1200, A3000 and A4000, allowing standard Amiga computers to use PCI cards such as graphics cards, [[Sound Blaster]] sound cards, 10/100 Ethernet cards, USB cards, and television tuner cards. Other manufacturers produced hybrid boards that contained an Intel x86 series chip, allowing the Amiga to emulate a PC.\n\nPowerPC upgrades with Wide SCSI controllers, PCI busboards with Ethernet, sound and 3D graphics cards, and tower cases allowed the A1200 and A4000 to survive well into the late nineties.\n\nExpansion boards were made by [[Richmond Sound Design]] that allow their [[show control]] and [[sound design]] software to communicate with their custom hardware frames either by either ribbon cable or fiber optic cable for long distances, allowing the Amiga to control up to eight million digitally controlled external audio, lighting, automation, relay and voltage control channels spread around a large theme park, for example. See [[Amiga software]] for more information on these applications.\n\nOther devices included the following:\n* [[Amiga 500#Trap-door expansion 501|Amiga 501]] with 512&nbsp;KB RAM and [[real-time clock]]\n* Trumpcard 500 [[Amiga Zorro II|Zorro-II]] SCSI interface\n* [[Great Valley Products#GVP A530 Turbo|GVP A530 Turbo]], accelerator, RAM expansion, PC emulator\n* A2091 / A590 SCSI hard disk controller + 2&nbsp;MB RAM expansion<ref name=\"amigahw_1161\" /><ref name=\"amigahw_534\" />\n* A3070 SCSI tape backup unit with a capacity of {{nowrap|250 MB}}, [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] Archive Viper 1/4-inch<ref name=\"amigahw_1296\" />\n* A2065 Ethernet Zorro-II interface \u2013 the first Ethernet interface for Amiga; uses the [[AMD Lance Am7990|AMD Am7990]] chip<ref name=\"amigahw_905\" /><ref name=\"amigacx_a3000eth\" /> The same interface chip is used in [[DECstation]] as well.\n* Ariadne Zorro-II Ethernet interface using the AMD Am7990<ref name=\"amigacx_a3000eth\" />\n* A4066 Zorro II Ethernet interface using the SMC 91C90QF<ref name=\"amigacx_a3000eth\" /><ref name=\"amigahu_a4066p1\" /><!-- http://hardware.amiga.hu/exp/a4066 -->\n* X-Surf from Individual Computers using the Realtek 8019AS<ref name=\"amigacx_a3000eth\" />\n* A2060 [[ARCNET|Arcnet]]<ref name=\"amigahi_netfaq_AmiTCP\" />\n* A1010 [[Floppy-disk controller|floppy]] disk drive consisting of a 3.5-inch [[double density]] (DD), {{nowrap|300 rpm}}, {{nowrap|250 kbit/s}} drive unit connected via [[D-subminiature|DB-23]] connector; track-to-track delay is on the order of {{nowrap|~94 ms}}.

The PowerPC based [[AmigaOne]] computers were later marketed since 2002. Several companies and private persons have also released Amiga [[Clone (computing)|clones]] and still do so today.\n\n=== Commodore Amiga ===\n[[File:Amiga 1000DP.jpg|thumb|The [[Amiga 1000]] (1985) was the first model released.<ref name=\"AutoP5-13\" />]]\n[[File:Amiiga4000DP.jpg|thumb|The [[Amiga 4000]] (1992) was the last desktop computer made by Commodore.]]\n\nThe first Amiga model, the Amiga 1000, was launched in 1985. In 2006, [[PC World]] rated the Amiga 1000 as the seventh greatest PC of all time, stating \"Years ahead of its time, the Amiga was the world's first multimedia, multitasking personal computer\".<ref name=\"AutoP5-14\" />\n\nCommodore updated the desktop line of Amiga computers with the [[Amiga 2000]] in 1987, the [[Amiga 3000]] in 1990, and the [[Amiga 4000]] in 1992, each offering improved capabilities and expansion options. The best selling models were the budget models, however, particularly the highly successful [[Amiga 500]] (1987) and the [[Amiga 1200]] (1992). The [[Amiga 500+]] (1991) was the shortest lived model, replacing the Amiga 500 and lasting only six months until it was phased out and replaced with the [[Amiga 600]] (1992), which in turn was also quickly replaced by the Amiga 1200.<ref name=\"AutoP5-15\" />\n\nThe [[Commodore CDTV|CDTV]], launched in 1991, was a [[CD-ROM]] based all-in-one multimedia system. It was an early attempt at a multi-purpose multimedia appliance in an era before multimedia consoles and CD-ROM drives were common. Unfortunately for Commodore, the system never achieved any real commercial success. Like the [[Commodore 64 Games System|Commodore 64GS]] that was a video game console based on a computer, the CDTV was designed as a video game console and multimedia platform. It had existed before the Sony [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Sega Saturn]], but had influenced them{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. It competed with the [[TurboGrafx-16|Turbo-Grafx CD]] and [[Sega CD]] system add ons when it was being sold.\n\nCommodore's last Amiga offering before filing for bankruptcy was an attempt to capture a portion of the highly competitive 1990s console market with the [[Amiga CD32]] (1993), a 32-bit CD-ROM games console. Although discontinued after Commodore's demise it met with moderate commercial success in Europe. The CD32 was a next generation CDTV, and it was designed to save Commodore by entering the growing video game console market.\n\nFollowing purchase of Commodore's assets by Escom in 1995, the A1200 and A4000T continued to be sold in small quantities until 1996, though the ground lost since the initial launch and the prohibitive expense of these units meant that the Amiga line never regained any real popularity.\n\nSeveral Amiga models contained references to songs by the [[rock music|rock]] band [[The B-52's]]. Early A500 units had the words \"B52/ROCK LOBSTER\"<ref name=\"AutoP5-16\" /> [[PCB manufacturing|silk-screen printed]] onto their [[printed circuit board]], a reference to the song \"[[Rock Lobster]]\" The [[Amiga 600]] referenced \"JUNE BUG\" (after the song \"Junebug\") and the [[Amiga 1200]] had \"CHANNEL Z\" (after \"[[Channel Z (song)|Channel Z]]\").,<ref name=\"AutoP5-17\" /> and the CD-32 had \"Spellbound.\"\n\n=== AmigaOS 4 systems ===\n{{Main|AmigaOS 4}}\n\n[[AmigaOS 4]] is designed for PowerPC Amiga systems. It is mainly based on AmigaOS 3.1 source code, with some parts of version 3.9. Currently runs on both Amigas equipped with CyberstormPPC or BlizzardPPC accelerator boards, on the Teron series based [[AmigaOne]] computers built by [[Eyetech]] under license by [[Amiga, Inc.]], on the [[Pegasos|Pegasos II]] from [[Genesi]]/[[Genesi|bPlan GmbH]], on the [[ACube Systems Srl]] [[Sam440ep]] / [[Sam460ex]] / AmigaOne 500 systems and on the A-EON [[AmigaOne X1000]].\n\nAmigaOS 4.0 had been available only in developer pre-releases for numerous years until it was officially released in December 2006.<ref name=\"AutoP5-18\" /> Due to the nature of some provisions of the contract between Amiga Inc. and [[Hyperion Entertainment]] (the Belgian company that is developing the OS), the commercial AmigaOS 4 had been available only to licensed buyers of AmigaOne motherboards.\n\nAmigaOS 4.0 for Amigas equipped with PowerUP accelerator boards was released in November 2007.<ref name=\"AutoP5-19\" /> Version 4.1 was released in August 2008 for AmigaOne systems,<ref name=\"AutoP5-20\" /><ref name=\"AutoP5-21\" /> and in May 2011 for Amigas equipped with PowerUP accelerator boards.<ref name=\"AutoP5-22\" /> The most recent release of AmigaOS for all supported platforms is 4.1 update 5.<ref name=\"AutoP5-23\" /> Starting with release 4.1 update 4 there is an Emulation drawer containing official AmigaOS 3.x ROMs (all classic Amiga models including CD32) and relative Workbench files.\n\n[[Acube Systems]] entered an agreement with Hyperion under which it has ported AmigaOS 4 to its [[Sam440ep]] and [[Sam460ex]] line of PowerPC-based motherboards.<ref name=\"AutoP5-24\" /> In 2009 a version for [[Pegasos II]] was released in co-operation with Acube Systems.<ref name=\"AutoP5-25\" /> In 2012, A-EON Technology Ltd manufactured and released the [[AmigaOne X1000]] to consumers through their partner, Amiga Kit who provided end-user support, assembly and worldwide distribution of the new system.\n\n=== Amiga hardware clones ===\nLong-time Amiga developer MacroSystem entered the Amiga-clone market with their [[DraCo]] non-linear video editing system.<ref name=\"AutoP5-26\" /> It appears in two versions, initially a tower model and later a cube. DraCo expanded upon and combined a number of earlier expansion cards developed for Amiga (VLabMotion, Toccata, WarpEngine, RetinaIII) into a true Amiga-clone powered by the [[Motorola 68060]] processor. The DraCo can run AmigaOS 3.1 up through AmigaOS 3.9. It is the only Amiga-based system to support [[FireWire]] for video [[Input/output|I/O]]. DraCo also offers an Amiga-compatible [[Amiga Zorro III|Zorro-II]] expansion bus and introduced a faster custom DraCoBus, capable of {{nowrap|30 MB/sec}} transfer rates (faster than Commodore's [[Amiga Zorro III|Zorro-III]]). The technology was later used in the Casablanca system, a set-top-box also designed for non-linear video editing.\n\nIn 1998, Index Information released the Access, an Amiga-clone similar to the Amiga 1200, but on a motherboard that could fit into a standard [[Drive bay#5%\"|5\u00bc\" drive bay]]. It features either a [[Motorola 68020|68020]] or [[Motorola 68030|68030]] CPU, with a redesigned [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] chipset, and runs AmigaOS 3.1.\n\nIn 1998, former Amiga employees (John Smith, Peter Kittel, [[Dave Haynie]] and Andy Finkel to mention few) formed a new company called PIOS. Their hardware platform, PIOS One, was aimed at Amiga, Atari and Macintosh users. The company was renamed to Met@box in 1999 until it folded.<ref name=\"AutoP5-27\" />\n\nThe NatAmi (short for ''Native Amiga'') hardware project began in 2005 with the aim of designing and building an Amiga clone motherboard that is enhanced with modern features.<ref name=\"AutoP5-28\" /> The NatAmi motherboard is a standard [[Mini-ITX]]-compatible form factor computer motherboard, powered by a Motorola/Freescale [[68060]] and its chipset. It is compatible with the original Amiga chipset, which has been inscribed on a programmable FPGA [[Altera]] chip on the board. The NatAmi is the second Amiga clone project after the [[Minimig]] motherboard, and its history is very similar to that of the [[C-One]] mainboard developed by [[Jeri Ellsworth]] and Jens Sch\u00f6nfeld. From a commercial point of view, Natami's circuitry and design are currently [[Proprietary software|closed source]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} One goal of the NatAmi project is to design an Amiga-compatible motherboard that includes up-to-date features but that does not rely on emulation (as in [[WinUAE]]), modern PC [[Intel]] components, or a modern [[PowerPC]] mainboard. As such, NatAmi is not intended to become another evolutionary heir to classic Amigas, such as with [[AmigaOne]] or [[Pegasos]] computers. This \"purist\" philosophy essentially limits the resulting processor speed but puts the focus on bandwidth and low latencies. The developers also recreated the entire Amiga chipset, freeing it from legacy Amiga limitations such as two [[megabyte]]s of audio and video graphics RAM as in the [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA chipset]], and rebuilt this new chipset by programming a modern [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] [[Altera]] Cyclone IV chip. Later, the developers decided to create from scratch a new software-form processor chip, codenamed \"N68050\" that resides in the physical Altera FPGA programmable chip.<ref name=\"AutoP5-29\" />\n\nIn 2006, two new Amiga clones were announced, both using [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] based hardware synthesis to replace the Amiga [[Original Chip Set|OCS]] custom chipset. The first, the [[Minimig]], is a personal project of Dutch engineer Dennis van Weeren. Referred to as \"new Amiga hardware\",<ref name=\"minimig\" /> the original model was built on a [[Xilinx]] Spartan-3 development board, but soon a dedicated board was developed. The minimig uses the FPGA to reproduce the custom Denise, Agnus, Paula and [[Amiga custom chips#Gary|Gary]] chips as well as both 8520 [[MOS Technology CIA|CIAs]] and implements a simple version of [[Amiga custom chips#Amber|Amber]]. The rest of the chips are an actual 68000 CPU, ram chips, and a PIC microcontroller for [[BIOS]] control.<ref name=\"minimig\" /> The design for Minimig was released as [[Open-source software|open-source]] on July 25, 2007. In February 2008, an Italian company [[Acube Systems]] began selling Minimig boards. A third party upgrade replaces the PIC microcontroller with a more powerful ARM processor, providing more functionality such as write access and support for hard disk images. The Minimig core has been ported to the FPGArcade \"Replay\" board. The Replay uses an FPGA with about {{nowrap|3 times}} more capacity and that does support the AGA chipset and a [[Motorola 68020|68020]] [[Soft core (synthesis)|soft core]] with [[Motorola 68030|68030]] capabilities. The Replay board is designed to implement many older computers and classic arcade machines.\n\nThe second is the Clone-A system announced by [[Individual Computers]]. As of mid 2007 it has been shown in its development form, with FPGA-based boards replacing the Amiga chipset and mounted on an Amiga 500 motherboard.<ref name=\"individual\" />\n\n=== Emulation ===\n{{Main|Amiga emulation}}\n\nLike many popular but discontinued platforms, the Amiga has been emulated so that software developed for the Amiga can be run on other computer platforms without the original hardware. Such emulators attempt to replicate the functionality of the Amiga architecture in software. As mentioned above, attempts have also been made to replicate the Amiga chipset in [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] chips.<ref name=\"AutoP5-31\" />\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of emulation is the design of the Amiga chipset, which relies on cycle-critical timings. As a result, early emulators did not always achieve the intended results though later emulator versions can now accurately reproduce the behavior of Amiga systems.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n== Operating systems ==\n\n=== AmigaOS ===\n[[File:AmigaOne X1000 02.jpg|thumb|AmigaOne X1000 running AmigaOS 4.1]]\n\n{{Main|AmigaOS}}\n{{quote\n| \"[AmigaOS] remains one of the great operating systems of the past 20 years, incorporating a small kernel and tremendous [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] capabilities the likes of which have only recently been developed in [[OS/2]] and [[Windows NT]]. The biggest difference is that the AmigaOS could operate fully and multitask in as little as {{nowrap|250 K}} of address space.\n| ''[[John C. Dvorak]], PC Magazine'', October 1996.<ref name=\"AutoP5-32\" />\n}}\n\nAmigaOS is a single-user multitasking [[operating system]]. It was developed first by Commodore International, and initially introduced in 1985 with the Amiga 1000. Original versions run on the Motorola 68000 series of microprocessors, while AmigaOS 4 runs only on PowerPC microprocessors. At the time of release AmigaOS put an operating system that was well ahead of its time into the hands of the average consumer. It was one of the first commercially available consumer operating systems for personal computers to implement [[Preemption (computing)|preemptive]] multitasking.\n\nAnother notable feature was the combined use of both a [[command-line interface]] and [[graphical user interface]]. [[AmigaDOS]] was the disk operating system and command line portion of the OS and [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] the native graphical windowing, [[Icon (computing)|icon]]s, menu and pointer environment for file management and launching applications. Notably, AmigaDOS allowed long [[filename]]s (up to 107 characters) with [[Whitespace character|whitespace]] and did not require [[filename extension]]s. The [[windowing system]] and user interface engine that handles all input events is called [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition]].<ref name=\"amiga_intuition_ref\" />\n\nThe multi-tasking kernel is called [[Exec (Amiga)|Exec]]. It acts as a scheduler for tasks running on the system, providing pre-emptive multitasking with prioritised round-robin scheduling. It enabled true pre-emptive multitasking in as little as 256&nbsp;KB of free memory.<ref name=\"amiga_rkm_libs_exec\" /><ref name=\"holloway_oo_amiga_exec\" />\n\nAmigaOS does not implement [[memory protection]], because the [[Motorola 68000|68000]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] does not include a [[memory management unit]].<ref name=\"google.groups.com (Memory Protection)\" /> Although this speeds and eases [[inter-process communication]] because programs can communicate by simply passing a [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]] back and forth, the lack of memory protection made the AmigaOS more vulnerable to [[Crash (computing)|crashes]] from badly behaving [[Computer program|programs]] than other multitasking systems that did implement memory protection,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lr8ldHhh_wsC&lpg=PA74&pg=PA74 |title=Tech Book 1 - Published articles Oct 2006 - June 2008 - Michael Reed - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-07-24}}</ref> and Amiga OS is fundamentally incapable of enforcing any form of security model since any program had full access to the system. A co-operational memory protection feature was implemented in AmigaOS 4 and could be retrofitted to old AmigaOS systems using Enforcer or CyberGuard tools.\n\nThe problem was somewhat exacerbated by Commodore's initial decision to release documentation relating not only to the OS's underlying software routines, but also to the hardware itself, enabling intrepid programmers who had developed their skills on the [[Commodore 64]] to [[PEEK and POKE|POKE]] the hardware directly, as was done on the older platform. While the decision to release the documentation was a popular one and allowed the creation of fast, sophisticated sound and graphics routines in games and demos, it also contributed to system instability as some programmers lacked the expertise to program at this level. For this reason, when the new [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] chipset was released, [[Commodore International|Commodore]] declined to release low-level documentation in an attempt to force developers into using the approved software routines.\n\n==== Influence on other operating systems ====\nAmigaOS directly or indirectly inspired the development of various operating systems. [[MorphOS]] and [[AROS Research Operating System|AROS]] clearly inherit heavily from the structure of AmigaOS as explained directly in articles regarding these two operating systems. AmigaOS also influenced [[BeOS]], which featured a centralized system of [[Amiga support and maintenance software#Datatypes|Datatypes]], similar to that present in AmigaOS. Likewise, [[DragonFly BSD]] was also inspired by AmigaOS as stated by Dragonfly developer Matthew Dillon who is a former Amiga developer.<ref name=\"AutoP5-33\" /><ref name=\"AutoP5-34\" /> [[WindowLab]] and [[amiwm]] are among several [[window manager]]s for the [[X Window System]] seek to mimic the Workbench interface. IBM licensed the Amiga GUI from Commodore in exchange for the REXX language license. This allowed [[OS/2]] to have the WPS ([[Workplace Shell]]) GUI shell for OS/2 2.0, a 32-bit operating system.<ref>[http://www.os2bbs.com/os2news/OS2Warp.html OS/2 News, OS/2 BBS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020022353/http://www.os2bbs.com/os2news/OS2Warp.html |date=October 20, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Doug McIlroy |url=http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch03s02.html#os_2 |title=OS/2 Eric S.

It supports the [[Amiga 2500]] and Amiga 3000 and is included with the [[Amiga 3000UX]]. Among other unusual features of Amix is a hardware-accelerated windowing system that can scroll windows without copying data. Amix is not supported on the later Amiga systems based on [[Motorola 68040|68040]] or [[Motorola 68060|68060]] processors.\n\nOther, still maintained, operating systems are available for the classic Amiga platform, including Linux and [[NetBSD]]. Both require a CPU with [[Memory management unit|MMU]] such as the [[Motorola 68020|68020]] with [[Motorola 68851|68851]] or full versions of the [[Motorola 68030|68030]], [[Motorola 68040|68040]] or [[Motorola 68060|68060]]. There is also a version of Linux for Amigas with PowerPC accelerator cards. [[Debian]] and [[Yellow Dog Linux]] can run on the AmigaOne.\n\nThere is an official, older version of [[OpenBSD]]. The last Amiga release is 3.2. [[MINIX]] 1.5.10 also runs on Amiga.<ref name=\"AutoP5-35\" />\n\n=== Emulating other systems ===\n{{Main|Emulation on the Amiga}}\n\nThe Amiga is able to emulate other computer platforms ranging from many 8-bit systems such as the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], Nintendo Game Boy, Nintendo Entertainment System, [[Apple II]] and the [[TRS-80]]. The Commodore PC-Transformer software emulated an IBM 5150 at 1&nbsp;MHz in Monochrome mode. Later PC-Bridgecards were a full hardware PC on a card with 8086/80286/80386 Intel chips running MS-DOS and Windows in an Amiga window. A-Max emulated an Apple Macintosh using a serial port dongle that had a Macintosh ROM on it. The Amiga had the same 68000 CPU as the Macintosh and, using a Macintosh emulator, could run Mac 68K operating systems and programs. The Amiga could not directly read Macintosh 3.5\" floppies, however, due to their proprietary format. Further, it required a compatible Macintosh for a copy of its ROM. The Atari ST was also emulated. [[MAME]] (the arcade machine emulator) is also available for Amiga systems with PPC accelerator card upgrades.\n\n== Amiga software ==\n{{Main|Amiga software}}\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s the platform became particularly popular for gaming, [[demoscene]] activities and creative software uses. During this time commercial developers marketed a wide range of games and creative software, often developing titles simultaneously for the [[Atari ST]] due to the similar hardware architecture. Popular creative software included [[3D computer graphics software|3D rendering]] (ray-tracing) packages, [[raster graphics editor|bitmap graphics editors]], [[desktop video]] software, software development packages and \"[[Tracker (music software)|tracker]]\" music editors.\n\nUntil the late 1990s the Amiga remained a popular platform for non-commercial software, often developed by enthusiasts, and much of which was freely redistributable. An on-line archive, [[Aminet]], was created in 1992 and until around 1996 was the largest public archive of software, art and documents for any platform.\n\n== Marketing ==\n[[File:Amiga-90sLogo.gif|thumb|Logo used in the US on some product packaging for the Amiga 500{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}]]\n[[File:Recent Amiga.svg|thumb|Amiga Technologies logo incorporating the \"Boing Ball\" (1996)]]\n\nThe name ''Amiga'' was chosen by the developers from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for a female friend, because they knew Spanish,<ref name=\"AutoP5-36\" /> and because it occurred before [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Atari]] alphabetically. It also conveyed the message that the Amiga computer line was \"user friendly\" as a pun or play on words.<ref name=\"AutoP5-37\" />\n\nThe first official Amiga logo was a rainbow-colored double [[check mark]]. In later marketing material Commodore largely dropped the checkmark and used logos styled with various typefaces. Although it was never adopted as a [[trademark]] by Commodore, the \"Boing Ball\" has been synonymous with Amiga since its launch. It became an unofficial and enduring theme after a visually impressive animated demonstration at the 1984 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1984 showing a checkered ball bouncing and rotating. Following Escom's purchase of Commodore in 1996, the Boing Ball theme was incorporated into a new logo.<ref name=\"AutoP5-38\" />\n\nEarly Commodore advertisements attempted to cast the computer as an all-purpose business machine, though the Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer.<ref name=ad1987a/><ref name=ad1987b/> Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s Commodore primarily placed advertising in computer magazines and occasionally in national newspapers and on television.\n\n== Legacy ==\nSince the demise of Commodore, various groups have marketed successors to the original Amiga line:\n\n* [[Genesi]] sold PowerPC based hardware under the [[Pegasos]] brand running AmigaOS and [[MorphOS]];\n* [[Eyetech]] sold PowerPC based hardware under the [[AmigaOne]] brand from 2002 to 2005 running AmigaOS 4;\n* Amiga Kit distributes and sells PowerPC based hardware under the [[AmigaOne]] brand from 2010 to present day running [[AmigaOS 4]];\n* [[ACube Systems]] sells the AmigaOS 3 compatible [[Minimig]] system with a Freescale MC68SEC000 CPU (Motorola 68000 compatible) and AmigaOS 4 compatible [[Sam440ep|Sam440]] / [[Sam460ex|Sam460]] / AmigaOne 500 systems with PowerPC processors;\n* A-EON Technology Ltd sells the AmigaOS 4 compatible [[AmigaOne X1000]] system with P.A. Semi [[PWRficient]] PA6T-1682M processor.\n* Amiga Kit Amiga Store, Vesalia Computer and AMIGAstore.eu sell numerous items from aftermarket components to refurbished classic systems.\n\nAmigaOS and MorphOS are commercial proprietary operating systems. AmigaOS 4, based on AmigaOS 3.1 source code with some parts of version 3.9, is developed by [[Hyperion Entertainment]] and runs on PowerPC based hardware. MorphOS, based on some parts of AROS source code, is developed by MorphOS Team and is continued on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and other PowerPC based hardware.\n\nThere is also [[AROS Research Operating System|AROS]], a free and open source operating system (re-implementation of the AmigaOS 3.1 APIs), for Amiga 68k, x86 and ARM hardware (one version runs Linux-hosted on the [[Raspberry Pi]]). In particular, AROS for Amiga 68k hardware aims to create an open source Kickstart ROM replacement for emulation purpose and/or for use on real \"classic\" hardware.<ref name=\"AutoP5-39\" />\n\n== Amiga community ==\nAfter Commodore went bankrupt in 1994, an active Amiga community continued to support the platform long after mainstream commercial vendors abandoned it. The most popular Amiga magazine, ''[[Amiga Format]]'', continued to publish editions until 2000, some six years after Commodore filed for bankruptcy. Another magazine, ''[[Amiga Active]]'', was launched in 1999 and was published until 2001. In spite of declining interest in the platform, there was a bi-weekly specialist column in the UK weekly magazine ''[[Micro Mart]]''.\n\nSeveral notable magazines are in publication today: ''Amiga Future'',<ref name=\"AutoP5-40\" /> which is available in both English and German; ''Bitplane.it'',<ref name=\"AutoP5-41\" /> a bi-monthly magazine in Italian; and ''AmigaPower'',<ref name=\"AutoP5-42\" /> a long-running French magazine.\n\nOnline Amiga magazines still exists like [http://obligement.free.fr Obligement], a French publication available since 1997.\n\n== Notable uses ==\n{{fiction trivia|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe Amiga series of computers found a place in early computer graphic design and television presentation. Below are some examples of notable uses and users:\n* Season 1 and part of season 2 of the television series ''[[Babylon 5]]'' were rendered in LightWave 3D on Amigas.<ref name=\"lurk-effects\" /><ref name=\"lurk-thornton\" /> Other television series using Amigas for special effects included ''[[SeaQuest DSV]]''<ref name=\"AutoP5-46\" /> and ''[[Max Headroom (TV series)|Max Headroom]]''.<ref name=\"AutoP5-47\" />\n\nIn addition, many other celebrities and notable individuals have made use of the Amiga:<ref name=\"AutoP5-48\" />\n\n* [[Andy Warhol]] was an early user of the Amiga and appeared at the launch,<ref name=\"AutoP5-49\" /> where he made a computer artwork of [[Debbie Harry]].<ref name=\"AutoP5-50\" /> Warhol used the Amiga to create a new style of art made with computers, and was the author of a multimedia opera called ''[[You Are the One (Andy Warhol)|You Are the One]]'', which consists of an animated sequence featuring images of actress [[Marilyn Monroe]] assembled in a short movie with a soundtrack. The video was discovered on two old Amiga floppies in a drawer in Warhol's studio and repaired in 2006 by the Detroit [[Museum of New Art]].<ref name=\"AutoP5-51\" /> The pop artist has been quoted as saying: ''\"The thing I like most about doing this kind of work on the Amiga is that it looks like my work in other media\"''.<ref name=\"AutoP5-52\" /><ref name=\"AutoP5-53\" />\n* Artist [[Jean Giraud|Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud]] credits the Amiga he bought for his son as a bridge to learning about \"using paint box programs\".<ref name=\"AutoP5-58\" /> He uploaded some of his early experiments to the file sharing forums on [[CompuServe]].\n* The [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' contains a computer animated music video parody of the [[Dire Straits]] song \"[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]\", titled \"[[Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*]]\". According to the DVD commentary track, this spoof was created on an Amiga home computer.<ref name=\"AutoP5-60\" />\n* [[Rolf Harris]] used an Amiga to digitize his hand-drawn art work for animation on his television series, ''Rolf's Cartoon Club''.\n* [[Todd Rundgren]]'s video \"Change Myself\" was produced with Toaster and Lightwave.\n* Scottish pop artist [[Calvin Harris]] composed his 2007 debut album ''[[I Created Disco]]'' with an [[Amiga 1200]].<ref name=\"AutoP5-61\" />\n* [[Susumu Hirasawa]], a [[Japan]]ese [[Progressive rock|progressive]]-[[Electronic music|electronic]] [[artist]] is known for using Amigas to compose and perform music, aid his live shows and make his promotional videos. He has also been inspired by the Amiga, and has referenced it in his lyrics. His December 13, 1994 \"Adios Jay\" Interactive Live Show was dedicated to (then recently deceased) Jay Miner. He also used the Amiga to create the virtual drummer TAINACO, who was a CG rendered figure whose performance was made with Elan Performer and was projected with DCTV. He also composed and performed \"Eastern-boot\", the AmigaOS 4 boot jingle.\n* Electronic musician [[Max Tundra]] created his three albums with an Amiga 500.<ref name=\"AutoP5-62\" />\n* [[Bob Casale]], keyboardist and guitarist of the [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[Devo]] used Amiga computer graphics on the album cover to Devo's album ''[[Total Devo]]''\n* Most of [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']]'s music was created on an Amiga computer, converted to MIDI, and then reconverted to the game's music format.<ref name=\"Masuda's blog post about HeartGold/SoulSilver music\">{{cite web|last=Masuda|first=Junichi|title=HIDDEN POWER of masuda|url=http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir_english/?p=185|publisher=GameFreak|accessdate=7 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123075400/http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir_english/?p=185|archive-date=23 November 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Other uses ===\nThe Amiga was also used in a number of special purpose applications:\n* Amigas were used in various [[NASA]] laboratories to keep track of low orbiting satellites, and were still used until 2004 (but eventually discontinued and sold in 2006).

During demonstrations at Fort Knox, the Amigas did not interact with each other, but instead operated in \"remote mode\" because the simulation environment computer was not portable.\n*{{As of|2015}}, the Grand Rapids Public School district still uses a Commodore Amiga 2000 computer, complete with 1200 baud modem, to automate its air conditioning and heating systems for the 19 schools covered by the GRPS district. \"The system controls the start/stop of boilers, the start/stop of fans, pumps, [it] monitors space temperatures, and so on.\" The system has been running day and night for decades.<ref name=\"AutoP5-69\">{{cite news|author=Eric Limer|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a16010/30-year-old-computer-runs-school-heat/|title=One Ancient Commodore Amiga Runs the Heat and AC for 19 Public Schools|publisher=Hearst Digital Media|date=June 12, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615002258/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a16010/30-year-old-computer-runs-school-heat/|archive-date=June 15, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://woodtv.com/2015/06/11/1980s-computer-controls-grps-heat-and-ac/|title=1980s computer controls GRPS heat and AC|access-date=2016-02-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023037/http://woodtv.com/2015/06/11/1980s-computer-controls-grps-heat-and-ac/|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*Amiga models, generally 1000s and 2000s, were utilized by the [[Pop (U.S. TV network)|Prevue Guide]] (later renamed the Prevue Channel), a specialized cable network designed to provide TV listings. Though its history stretched back to 1981, the Prevue Guide did not start using Amigas on a wide-scale basis until the late 1980s. Amigas were used to generate program listings locally at the headend office, while a C-band satellite feed provided promotional material for cable networks (occupying the top half of the screen above the local listings).

The original model was part of a series of 16/32- and 32-bit computers that featured 256 KB or more of RAM, mouse-based GUIs, and significantly improved graphics and audio over 8-bit systems. This wave included the [[Atari ST]]&mdash;released the same year&mdash;Apple's [[Macintosh]], and later the [[Apple IIGS]]. Based on the [[Motorola 68000 series|Motorola 68000]] [[microprocessor]], the Amiga differed from its contemporaries through the inclusion of custom hardware to accelerate graphics and sound, including [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] and a [[blitter]], and a [[pre-emptive multitasking]] operating system called [[AmigaOS]].\n\nThe [[Amiga 1000]] was released in July 1985, but a series of production problems kept it from becoming widely available until early 1986. The best selling model, the [[Amiga 500]], was introduced in 1987 and became one of the leading home computers of the late 1980s and early 1990s with four to six million sold.<ref name=\"reimer\" /> The [[Amiga 3000|A3000]] was introduced in 1990, followed by the [[Amiga 500 Plus|A500+]], and the [[Amiga 600|A600]] in March 1992. Finally, the [[Amiga 1200|A1200]] and the [[Amiga 4000|A4000]] were released in late 1992. The platform became particularly popular for gaming and [[demo (computer programming)|programming demo]]s. It also found a prominent role in the [[desktop video]], [[video production]], and [[show control]] business, leading to video editing systems such as the [[Video Toaster]]. The Amiga's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early [[Music tracker|tracker]] music software. The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory enabled the development of 3D rendering packages, including [[LightWave 3D]], [[Imagine (3D modeling software)|Imagine]], [[Aladdin4D]], [[TurboSilver]] and Traces, a predecessor to [[Blender (software)|Blender]].\n\nAlthough early Commodore advertisements attempt to cast the computer as an all-purpose business machine, especially when outfitted with the [[Amiga Sidecar]] PC compatibility add-on, the Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer, with a wide range of games and creative software.<ref name=\"ad1987a\" /><ref name=\"ad1987b\" /> Poor marketing and the failure of the later models to repeat the technological advances of the first systems meant that the Amiga quickly lost its market share to competing platforms, such as the [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|fourth generation game consoles]], Macintosh, and the rapidly dropping prices of [[IBM PC compatible]]s, which gained 256-color VGA graphics in 1987.<ref name=\"reimer\" /> Commodore ultimately went bankrupt in April 1994 after a version of the Amiga packaged as a game console, the [[Amiga CD32]], failed in the marketplace.\n\nSince the demise of Commodore, various groups have marketed successors to the original Amiga line, including [[Genesi]], [[Eyetech]], [[ACube Systems Srl]] and A-EON Technology.

[[Nolan Bushnell]] had sold the company to [[WarnerMedia|Warner Communications]] in 1978, and the new management was much more interested in the existing lines than development of new products that might cut into their sales. Miner wanted to start work with the new [[Motorola 68000]], but management was only interested in another [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] based system. Miner left the company, and, for a time, the industry.<ref name=p1p4/>\n\nIn 1979, [[Larry Kaplan]] left Atari and founded [[Activision]]. In 1982, Kaplan was approached by a number of investors who wanted to develop a new game platform. Kaplan hired Miner to run the hardware side of the newly formed company, \"Hi-Toro\". The system was code-named \"Lorraine\" in keeping with Miner's policy of giving systems female names, in this case the company president's wife, Lorraine Morse.<ref name=\"AutoP5-1\" /> When Kaplan left the company late in 1982, Miner was promoted to head engineer<ref name=p1p4/> and the company relaunched as Amiga Corporation.<ref>''New York Times'', 29 August 1984, p. D1</ref>\n\nA breadboard prototype was largely completed by late 1983, and shown at the January 1984 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES). At the time, the operating system was not ready, so the machine was demonstrated with the [[Demo (computer programming)#The bouncing ball|Boing Ball demo]]. A further developed version of the system was demonstrated at the June 1984 CES and shown to many companies in hopes of garnering further funding, but found little interest in a market that was in the final stages of the [[North American video game crash of 1983]].<ref name=\"AutoP5-1\" /><ref name=\"AutoP5-2\" />\n\nIn March, Atari expressed a tepid interest in Lorraine for its potential use in a games console or home computer tentatively known as the 1850XLD. But the talks were progressing slowly,<ref>''New York Times'', 29 August 1984, p. D16</ref> and Amiga was running out of money. A temporary arrangement in June led to a $500,000 loan from Atari to Amiga to keep the company going. The terms required the loan to be repaid at the end of the month, otherwise Amiga would forfeit the Lorraine design to Atari.<ref name=p3p3/>\n\n===Commodore launch===\nDuring 1983, Atari lost over $1 million a week, due to the combined effects of the crash and the ongoing price war in the home computer market. By the end of the year, Warner was desperate to sell the company. In January 1984, [[Jack Tramiel]] resigned from Commodore due to internal battles over the future direction of the company. A number of Commodore employees followed him to his new company, [[Atari Corporation|Tramel Technology]]. This included a number of the senior technical staff, where they began development of a 68000-based machine of their own. In June, Tramiel arranged a no-cash deal to take over Atari, reforming it as Atari Corporation.\n\nAs many Commodore technical staff had moved to Atari, Commodore was left with no workable path to design their own next-generation computer. The company approached Amiga offering to fund development as a home computer system. They quickly arranged to repay the Atari loan, ending that threat. The two companies were initially arranging a $4 million license agreement before Commodore offered $24 million to purchase Amiga outright.<ref name=p3p3>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/08/a-history-of-the-amiga-part-3/3/ |title=A history of the Amiga, part 3: The first prototype |website=Ars Technica |first=Jeremy |last=Reimer |date=21 August 2007 |access-date=14 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704102904/https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/08/a-history-of-the-amiga-part-3/3/ |archive-date=4 July 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBy late 1984 the prototype breadboard chipset had successfully been turned into integrated circuits, and the system hardware was being readied for production. At this time the [[operating system]] (OS) was not as ready, and led to a deal to port an OS known as [[TRIPOS]] to the platform. TRIPOS was a [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] system that had been written in [[BCPL]] during the 1970s for [[minicomputer]] systems like the [[PDP-11]], but later experimentally ported to the 68000. This early version was known as AmigaDOS and the GUI as Workbench. The BCPL parts were later rewritten in the [[C (programming language)|C]] language, and the entire system became AmigaOS.\n\nThe system was enclosed in a [[pizza box form factor]] case; a late change was the introduction of vertical supports on either side of the case to provide a \"garage\" under the main section of the system where the keyboard could be stored.<ref name=p5p1>{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/10/amiga-history-4-commodore-years/2/ |title=A history of the Amiga, part 4: Enter Commodore |website=Ars Technica |first=Jeremy |last=Reimer |date=10 December 2007 |access-date=14 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170704100028/https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/10/amiga-history-4-commodore-years/2/ |archive-date=4 July 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe first model was announced in 1985 as simply \"The Amiga from Commodore\", later to be retroactively dubbed the [[Amiga 1000]].{{efn|The name \"Amiga\" was chosen because it is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for ''(female) friend'', and alphabetically it appears before Apple in lists of computer makers.

These models incorporated a series of technical upgrades known as the [[Amiga Enhanced Chip Set|ECS]] and [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]], which added higher resolution displays among many other improvements and simplifications.\n\nUltimately the Amiga line would sell an estimated 4,850,000 machines over its lifetime. The machines were most popular in the UK and Germany, with about 1.5 million sold in each country, and sales in the high hundreds of thousands in other European nations. The machine was less popular in North America, where an estimated 700,000 were sold.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amigahistory.plus.com/sales.html |title=Commodore-Amiga Sales Figures |first=Gareth |last=Knight |website=Amiga history guide |access-date=2019-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927041337/http://www.amigahistory.plus.com/sales.html |archive-date=2018-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In particular, in the U.S. the Amiga did not achieve any success outside of Commodore's traditional enthusiast market except in [[vertical market]]s for [[video processing]] and editing.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|pages=29\u201330}}</ref>\n\n===Bankruptcy ===\nIn spite of his successes in making the company profitable and bringing the Amiga line to market, Rattigan was soon forced out in a power struggle with majority shareholder, [[Irving Gould]].

They re-released the A1200 and A4000T, and introduced a new [[Motorola 68060|68060]] version of the A4000T. Amiga Technologies researched and developed the [[Amiga Walker]] prototype. They presented the machine publicly at CeBit. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amigareport.com/ar405/news13.html|title=The Amiga Walker Prototype|website=www.amigareport.com|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> Escom, in turn, went bankrupt in 1997. \n\nThe Amiga brand was then sold to a U.S. [[Wintel]] PC manufacturer, [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway 2000]], which had announced grand plans for it. In 2000, however, Gateway sold the Amiga brand without having released any products. The current owner of the trademark, [[Amiga, Inc.]], licensed the rights to sell hardware using either the Amiga or [[AmigaOne]] brand to [[Eyetech|Eyetech Group]], [[Hyperion Entertainment]] and [[Commodore USA]].\n\n== Hardware ==\n[[File:Amiga 1000 computer.jpg|thumb|[[Amiga 1000]]]]\n[[File:Amiga 600.jpg|thumb|[[Amiga 600]]]]\n[[File:Amiga 1200 with mouse, drives.jpg|thumb|[[Amiga 1200]]]]\n[[File:Amiga-CD32-wController-L.jpg|thumb|[[Amiga CD32]]]]\n[[File:Deluxe Paint for Amiga.jpg|thumb|Amiga diskette containing the [[Deluxe Paint]] bitmap graphics editing program]]\nAt its core, the Amiga has a custom chipset consisting of several [[coprocessor]]s, which handle audio, video and [[direct memory access]] independently of the [[Central processing unit|Central Processing Unit]] (CPU). This architecture freed up the Amiga's processor for other tasks and gave the Amiga a performance edge over its competitors, particularly in terms of video-intensive applications and games.<ref name=\"amiga_hardware_ref\" />\n\nThe general Amiga architecture uses two distinct [[bus (computing)|bus]] subsystems, namely, the chipset bus and the CPU bus. The chipset bus allows the custom coprocessors and CPU to address [[Amiga Chip RAM|\"Chip RAM\"]]. The CPU bus provides addressing to other subsystems, such as conventional RAM, ROM and the [[Amiga Zorro II|Zorro II]] or [[Amiga Zorro III|Zorro III]] expansion subsystems. This architecture enables independent operation of the subsystems; the CPU \"Fast\" bus can be much faster than the chipset bus. CPU expansion boards may provide additional custom buses. Additionally, \"busboards\" or \"bridgeboards\" may provide [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] or [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] buses.<ref name=\"amiga_hardware_ref\" />\n\n=== Central processing unit ===\nThe [[Motorola]] [[Motorola 68000 family|68000]] series of microprocessors was used in all Amiga models from Commodore. While all CPU in the 68000 family have a [[32-bit]] [[Instruction Set Architecture|ISA]] design (programmer uses and sees a 32-bit model), the MC68000 used in the most popular models is a [[16-bit]] (or 16/32-bit) processor because its [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] operates in 16-bit (32-bit operations require additional clock cycles, consuming more time).<ref name=\"AutoP5-4\" /><ref name=\"AutoP5-5\" /> The MC68000 has a 16-bit external [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] so 32-bits of data is transferred in two consecutive steps, a technique called [[multiplexing]]. This is transparent to the software, which was 32-bit from the beginning. The MC68000 can address 16&nbsp;MB of physical memory. Later Amiga models featured higher-speed, full 32-bit CPUs with a larger address space and [[Instruction pipelining|instruction pipeline]] facilities.\n\nCPU upgrades were offered by both Commodore and third-party manufacturers. Most Amiga models can be upgraded either by direct CPU replacement or through expansion boards. Such boards often featured faster and higher capacity memory interfaces and [[hard disk drive|hard disk]] controllers.\n\nTowards the end of Commodore's time in charge of Amiga development, there were suggestions that Commodore intended to move away from the 68000 series to higher performance [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] processors, such as the [[PA-RISC]].<ref name=\"actuator\" /><ref name=\"Haynie\" /> Those ideas were never developed before Commodore filed for bankruptcy. Despite this, third-party manufacturers designed upgrades featuring a combination of 68000 series and PowerPC processors along with a PowerPC native [[microkernel]] and software.<ref name=\"AutoP5-6\" /><ref name=\"AutoP5-7\" /> Later Amiga clones featured [[PowerPC]] processors only.\n\n=== Custom chipset ===\nThe custom chipset at the core of the Amiga design appeared in three distinct generations, with a large degree of backward-compatibility. The [[Original Chip Set]] (OCS) appeared with the launch of the A1000 in 1985. OCS was eventually followed by the modestly improved [[Amiga Enhanced Chip Set|Enhanced Chip Set]] (ECS) in 1990 and finally by the partly 32-bit [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|Advanced Graphics Architecture]] (AGA) in 1992. Each chipset consists of several coprocessors that handle [[blitter|graphics acceleration]], digital audio, [[direct memory access]] and communication between various peripherals (e.g., CPU, memory and floppy disks). In addition, some models featured auxiliary [[Amiga custom chips|custom chip]]s that performed tasks such as [[SCSI]] control and display de-interlacing.\n\n==== Graphics ====\n[[File:HAM6example.png|thumb|A 4096 color [[Hold-And-Modify|HAM]] picture created with [[Photon Paint]] in 1989]]\n\nAll Amiga systems can display full-screen animated graphics with 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 ([[Amiga Halfbrite mode|EHB Mode]]), or 4096 colors ([[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM Mode]]). Models with the AGA chipset (A1200 and A4000) also have non-EHB 64, 128, 256, and {{nowrap|262144}} ([[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM8 Mode]]) color modes and a palette expanded from 4096 to [[24-bit color|16.8 million colors]].\n\nThe Amiga chipset can ''[[genlock]]'', which is the ability to adjust its own screen refresh timing to match an incoming NTSC or PAL video signal. When combined with setting transparency, this allows an Amiga to overlay an external video source with graphics. This ability made the Amiga popular for many applications, and provides the ability to do [[Character generator|character generation]] and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects far more cheaply than earlier systems. This ability has been frequently utilized by wedding videographers, TV stations and their weather forecasting divisions (for weather graphics and radar), advertising channels, music video production, and desktop videographers. The [[NewTek]] [[Video Toaster]] was made possible by the genlock ability of the Amiga.\n\nIn 1988, the release of the Amiga A2024 fixed-frequency [[monochrome]] monitor with built-in [[framebuffer]] and flicker fixer hardware provided the Amiga with a choice of high-resolution graphic modes (1024\u00d7800 for NTSC and 1024\u00d71024 for PAL).<ref name=\"AutoP5-8\" />\n\n==== ReTargetable Graphics ====\n{{main|ReTargetable Graphics}}\n\nReTargetable Graphics is an [[application programming interface|API]] for [[device driver]]s mainly used by 3rd party graphics hardware to interface with AmigaOS via a set of [[library (computing)|libraries]]. The software libraries may include software tools to adjust [[Display resolution|resolution]], screen colors, [[Cursor (computers)#Mouse cursor|pointers]] and screenmodes. The standard [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition interface]] is limited to [[color depth|display depths]] of [[8-bit]]s, while RTG makes it possible to handle higher depths like [[24-bit]]s.\n\n==== Sound ====\nThe sound chip, named Paula, supports four [[pulse-code modulation|PCM]]-sample-based sound channels (two for the left speaker and two for the right) with 8-bit resolution for each channel and a 6-bit volume control per channel. The analog output is connected to a low-pass filter, which filters out high-frequency aliases when the Amiga is using a lower sampling rate (see [[Nyquist frequency]]). The brightness of the Amiga's power LED is used to indicate the status of the Amiga's low-pass filter. The filter is active when the LED is at normal brightness, and deactivated when dimmed (or off on older A500 Amigas). On Amiga 1000 (and first Amiga 500 and Amiga 2000 model), the power LED had no relation to the filter's status, and a wire needed to be manually soldered between pins on the sound chip to disable the filter. Paula can read directly from the system's [[Random-access memory|RAM]], using direct memory access (DMA), making sound playback without CPU intervention possible.\n\nAlthough the hardware is limited to four separate sound channels, software such as ''[[OctaMED]]'' uses software mixing to allow eight or more virtual channels, and it was possible for software to mix two hardware channels to achieve a single 14-bit resolution channel by playing with the volumes of the channels in such a way that one of the source channels contributes the most significant bits and the other the least.\n\nThe quality of the Amiga's sound output, and the fact that the hardware is ubiquitous and easily addressed by software, were standout features of Amiga hardware unavailable on PC platforms for years. Third-party sound cards exist that provide [[Digital signal processor|DSP]] functions, multi-track [[direct-to-disk recording]], multiple hardware sound channels and 16-bit and beyond resolutions. A retargetable sound API called [[AHI (Amiga)|AHI]] was developed allowing these cards to be used transparently by the [[Operating system|OS]] and software.\n\n=== Kickstart firmware ===\n{{Main|Kickstart (Amiga)}}\n\nKickstart is the [[firmware]] upon which AmigaOS is [[booting|bootstrap]]ped. Its purpose is to initialize the Amiga hardware and core components of AmigaOS and then attempt to boot from a [[Booting|bootable]] [[volume (computing)|volume]], such as a floppy disk or hard disk drive. Most models (excluding the Amiga 1000) come equipped with Kickstart on an embedded [[Read-only memory|ROM-chip]].\n\n=== Keyboard and mouse ===\n[[File:Amiga Mouse.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Amiga mouse]]\n\nThe keyboard on Amiga computers is similar to that found on a mid 80s IBM PC: Ten function keys, a numeric keypad, and four separate directional arrow keys. Caps Lock and Control share space to the left of A. Missing are the Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys: These are accomplished on Amigas by pressing shift and the appropriate arrow key. The Amiga keyboard adds a Help key, which a function key usually acts as on PCs (usually F1). In addition to the Control and Alt modifier keys, the Amiga has 2 'Amiga' keys, rendered as 'Open Amiga' and 'Closed Amiga' similar to the Open/Closed Apple logo keys on Apple II keyboards. The left is used to manipulate the operating system (moving screens and the like) and the right delivered commands to the application. The absence of Num lock frees space for more math symbols around the number pad. Contemporary Macintosh computers, for comparison, lack function keys completely.\n\nThe mouse has two buttons like Windows, but unlike Windows pressing and holding the right button replaces the system [[Status bar|status line]] at the top of the screen with a Maclike [[menu bar]]. As with Apple's [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] prior to [[Mac OS 8]], menu options are selected by releasing the button over that option, not by left clicking. Menu items that have a boolean toggle state can be left clicked whilst the menu is kept open with the right button, which allows the user \u2013 for example \u2013 to set some selected text to bold, underline and italics all at once.\n\nThe mouse plugs into one of two [[Atari joystick port]]s used for [[joystick]]s, [[Paddle (game controller)|game paddles]], and [[graphics tablet]]s. Although compatible with [[analog stick|analog joystick]]s, Atari-style digital joysticks became standard.<ref name=\"anderson198710\">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1987-10-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_089_1987_Oct#page/n17/mode/2up | title=Close Up: The Amiga 500 | work=Compute! | date=October 1987 | accessdate=18 January 2015 | author=Anderson, Rhett | pages=16\u201319 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204185248/http://archive.org/stream/1987-10-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_089_1987_Oct#page/n17/mode/2up | archive-date=4 December 2014 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Other peripherals and expansions ===\n[[File:Amiga Sound Sampling Hardware.jpg|thumb|upright|8-bit sound sampling hardware for the Amiga]]\n\nThe Amiga was one of the first computers for which inexpensive sound sampling and video digitization accessories were available. As a result of this and the Amiga's audio and video capabilities, the Amiga became a popular system for editing and producing both music and video.\n\nMany expansion boards were produced for Amiga computers to improve the performance and capability of the hardware, such as memory expansions, [[SCSI]] controllers, CPU boards, and graphics boards. Other upgrades include [[genlock]]s, network cards for [[Ethernet]], [[modem]]s, [[sound card]]s and samplers, [[Video capture|video digitizers]], extra [[serial port]]s, and [[Parallel ATA|IDE]] controllers. Additions after the demise of Commodore company are [[USB]] cards. The most popular upgrades were memory, SCSI controllers and CPU accelerator cards. These were sometimes combined into the one device.\n\nEarly CPU accelerator cards feature full 32-bit CPUs of the 68000 family such as the [[Motorola 68020]] and [[Motorola 68030]], almost always with 32-bit memory and usually with [[Floating-point unit|FPUs]] and [[Memory management unit|MMUs]] or the facility to add them. Later designs feature the [[Motorola 68040]] or [[Motorola 68060]]. Both CPUs feature integrated FPUs and MMUs. Many CPU accelerator cards also had integrated SCSI controllers.\n\nPhase5 designed the [[PowerUP (accelerator)|PowerUP]] boards ([[Blizzard PPC]] and [[PowerUP (accelerator)#Cyberstorm PPC|CyberStorm PPC]]) featuring both a 68k (a 68040 or 68060) and a PowerPC (603 or 604) CPU, which are able to run the two CPUs at the same time and share the system memory. The PowerPC CPU on PowerUP boards is usually used as a coprocessor for heavy computations; a powerful CPU is needed to run [[MAME]] for example, but even decoding [[JPEG]] pictures and [[MP3]] audio was considered heavy computation at the time. It is also possible to ignore the 68k CPU and run [[Linux]] on the PPC via project Linux APUS, but a PowerPC-native AmigaOS promised by Amiga Technologies GmbH was not available when the PowerUP boards first appeared.<ref name=\"AutoP5-9\" />\n\n24-bit graphics cards and video cards were also available. Graphics cards were designed primarily for 2D artwork production, workstation use, and later, gaming. Video cards are designed for inputting and outputting video signals, and processing and manipulating video.\n\nIn the North American market, the ''NewTek [[Video Toaster]]'' was a video effects board that turned the Amiga into an affordable video processing computer that found its way into many professional video environments. One well-known use was to create the special effects in early series of ''[[Babylon 5]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geek.com/games/cgi-first-introduced-to-tv-in-babylon-5-by-mit-presentor-771051/ |work=geek.com |title=CGI first introduced to TV in Babylon 5 by MIT presentor {{sic|nolink=y}} |access-date=2014-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222172408/http://www.geek.com/games/cgi-first-introduced-to-tv-in-babylon-5-by-mit-presentor-771051/ |archive-date=2014-02-22 |url-status=live }}</ref> Due to its [[NTSC]]-only design, it did not find a market in countries that used the [[PAL]] standard, such as in Europe. In those countries, the ''OpalVision'' card was popular, although less featured and supported than the Video Toaster. Low-cost [[Time base correction|time base correctors]] (TBC) specifically designed to work with the Toaster quickly came to market, most of which were designed as standard Amiga bus cards.\n\nVarious manufacturers started producing PCI busboards for the A1200, A3000 and A4000, allowing standard Amiga computers to use PCI cards such as graphics cards, [[Sound Blaster]] sound cards, 10/100 Ethernet cards, USB cards, and television tuner cards. Other manufacturers produced hybrid boards that contained an Intel x86 series chip, allowing the Amiga to emulate a PC.\n\nPowerPC upgrades with Wide SCSI controllers, PCI busboards with Ethernet, sound and 3D graphics cards, and tower cases allowed the A1200 and A4000 to survive well into the late nineties.\n\nExpansion boards were made by [[Richmond Sound Design]] that allow their [[show control]] and [[sound design]] software to communicate with their custom hardware frames either by either ribbon cable or fiber optic cable for long distances, allowing the Amiga to control up to eight million digitally controlled external audio, lighting, automation, relay and voltage control channels spread around a large theme park, for example. See [[Amiga software]] for more information on these applications.\n\nOther devices included the following:\n* [[Amiga 500#Trap-door expansion 501|Amiga 501]] with 512&nbsp;KB RAM and [[real-time clock]]\n* Trumpcard 500 [[Amiga Zorro II|Zorro-II]] SCSI interface\n* [[Great Valley Products#GVP A530 Turbo|GVP A530 Turbo]], accelerator, RAM expansion, PC emulator\n* A2091 / A590 SCSI hard disk controller + 2&nbsp;MB RAM expansion<ref name=\"amigahw_1161\" /><ref name=\"amigahw_534\" />\n* A3070 SCSI tape backup unit with a capacity of {{nowrap|250 MB}}, [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] Archive Viper 1/4-inch<ref name=\"amigahw_1296\" />\n* A2065 Ethernet Zorro-II interface \u2013 the first Ethernet interface for Amiga; uses the [[AMD Lance Am7990|AMD Am7990]] chip<ref name=\"amigahw_905\" /><ref name=\"amigacx_a3000eth\" /> The same interface chip is used in [[DECstation]] as well.\n* Ariadne Zorro-II Ethernet interface using the AMD Am7990<ref name=\"amigacx_a3000eth\" />\n* A4066 Zorro II Ethernet interface using the SMC 91C90QF<ref name=\"amigacx_a3000eth\" /><ref name=\"amigahu_a4066p1\" /><!-- http://hardware.amiga.hu/exp/a4066 -->\n* X-Surf from Individual Computers using the Realtek 8019AS<ref name=\"amigacx_a3000eth\" />\n* A2060 [[ARCNET|Arcnet]]<ref name=\"amigahi_netfaq_AmiTCP\" />\n* A1010 [[Floppy-disk controller|floppy]] disk drive consisting of a 3.5-inch [[double density]] (DD), {{nowrap|300 rpm}}, {{nowrap|250 kbit/s}} drive unit connected via [[D-subminiature|DB-23]] connector; track-to-track delay is on the order of {{nowrap|~94 ms}}.

The PowerPC based [[AmigaOne]] computers were later marketed since 2002. Several companies and private persons have also released Amiga [[Clone (computing)|clones]] and still do so today.\n\n=== Commodore Amiga ===\n[[File:Amiga 1000DP.jpg|thumb|The [[Amiga 1000]] (1985) was the first model released.<ref name=\"AutoP5-13\" />]]\n[[File:Amiiga4000DP.jpg|thumb|The [[Amiga 4000]] (1992) was the last desktop computer made by Commodore.]]\n\nThe first Amiga model, the Amiga 1000, was launched in 1985. In 2006, [[PC World]] rated the Amiga 1000 as the seventh greatest PC of all time, stating \"Years ahead of its time, the Amiga was the world's first multimedia, multitasking personal computer\".<ref name=\"AutoP5-14\" />\n\nCommodore updated the desktop line of Amiga computers with the [[Amiga 2000]] in 1987, the [[Amiga 3000]] in 1990, and the [[Amiga 4000]] in 1992, each offering improved capabilities and expansion options. The best selling models were the budget models, however, particularly the highly successful [[Amiga 500]] (1987) and the [[Amiga 1200]] (1992). The [[Amiga 500+]] (1991) was the shortest lived model, replacing the Amiga 500 and lasting only six months until it was phased out and replaced with the [[Amiga 600]] (1992), which in turn was also quickly replaced by the Amiga 1200.<ref name=\"AutoP5-15\" />\n\nThe [[Commodore CDTV|CDTV]], launched in 1991, was a [[CD-ROM]] based all-in-one multimedia system. It was an early attempt at a multi-purpose multimedia appliance in an era before multimedia consoles and CD-ROM drives were common. Unfortunately for Commodore, the system never achieved any real commercial success. Like the [[Commodore 64 Games System|Commodore 64GS]] that was a video game console based on a computer, the CDTV was designed as a video game console and multimedia platform. It had existed before the Sony [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[Sega Saturn]], but had influenced them{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}. It competed with the [[TurboGrafx-16|Turbo-Grafx CD]] and [[Sega CD]] system add ons when it was being sold.\n\nCommodore's last Amiga offering before filing for bankruptcy was an attempt to capture a portion of the highly competitive 1990s console market with the [[Amiga CD32]] (1993), a 32-bit CD-ROM games console. Although discontinued after Commodore's demise it met with moderate commercial success in Europe. The CD32 was a next generation CDTV, and it was designed to save Commodore by entering the growing video game console market.\n\nFollowing purchase of Commodore's assets by Escom in 1995, the A1200 and A4000T continued to be sold in small quantities until 1996, though the ground lost since the initial launch and the prohibitive expense of these units meant that the Amiga line never regained any real popularity.\n\nSeveral Amiga models contained references to songs by the [[rock music|rock]] band [[The B-52's]]. Early A500 units had the words \"B52/ROCK LOBSTER\"<ref name=\"AutoP5-16\" /> [[PCB manufacturing|silk-screen printed]] onto their [[printed circuit board]], a reference to the song \"[[Rock Lobster]]\" The [[Amiga 600]] referenced \"JUNE BUG\" (after the song \"Junebug\") and the [[Amiga 1200]] had \"CHANNEL Z\" (after \"[[Channel Z (song)|Channel Z]]\").,<ref name=\"AutoP5-17\" /> and the CD-32 had \"Spellbound.\"\n\n=== AmigaOS 4 systems ===\n{{Main|AmigaOS 4}}\n\n[[AmigaOS 4]] is designed for PowerPC Amiga systems. It is mainly based on AmigaOS 3.1 source code, with some parts of version 3.9. Currently runs on both Amigas equipped with CyberstormPPC or BlizzardPPC accelerator boards, on the Teron series based [[AmigaOne]] computers built by [[Eyetech]] under license by [[Amiga, Inc.]], on the [[Pegasos|Pegasos II]] from [[Genesi]]/[[Genesi|bPlan GmbH]], on the [[ACube Systems Srl]] [[Sam440ep]] / [[Sam460ex]] / AmigaOne 500 systems and on the A-EON [[AmigaOne X1000]].\n\nAmigaOS 4.0 had been available only in developer pre-releases for numerous years until it was officially released in December 2006.<ref name=\"AutoP5-18\" /> Due to the nature of some provisions of the contract between Amiga Inc. and [[Hyperion Entertainment]] (the Belgian company that is developing the OS), the commercial AmigaOS 4 had been available only to licensed buyers of AmigaOne motherboards.\n\nAmigaOS 4.0 for Amigas equipped with PowerUP accelerator boards was released in November 2007.<ref name=\"AutoP5-19\" /> Version 4.1 was released in August 2008 for AmigaOne systems,<ref name=\"AutoP5-20\" /><ref name=\"AutoP5-21\" /> and in May 2011 for Amigas equipped with PowerUP accelerator boards.<ref name=\"AutoP5-22\" /> The most recent release of AmigaOS for all supported platforms is 4.1 update 5.<ref name=\"AutoP5-23\" /> Starting with release 4.1 update 4 there is an Emulation drawer containing official AmigaOS 3.x ROMs (all classic Amiga models including CD32) and relative Workbench files.\n\n[[Acube Systems]] entered an agreement with Hyperion under which it has ported AmigaOS 4 to its [[Sam440ep]] and [[Sam460ex]] line of PowerPC-based motherboards.<ref name=\"AutoP5-24\" /> In 2009 a version for [[Pegasos II]] was released in co-operation with Acube Systems.<ref name=\"AutoP5-25\" /> In 2012, A-EON Technology Ltd manufactured and released the [[AmigaOne X1000]] to consumers through their partner, Amiga Kit who provided end-user support, assembly and worldwide distribution of the new system.\n\n=== Amiga hardware clones ===\nLong-time Amiga developer MacroSystem entered the Amiga-clone market with their [[DraCo]] non-linear video editing system.<ref name=\"AutoP5-26\" /> It appears in two versions, initially a tower model and later a cube. DraCo expanded upon and combined a number of earlier expansion cards developed for Amiga (VLabMotion, Toccata, WarpEngine, RetinaIII) into a true Amiga-clone powered by the [[Motorola 68060]] processor. The DraCo can run AmigaOS 3.1 up through AmigaOS 3.9. It is the only Amiga-based system to support [[FireWire]] for video [[Input/output|I/O]]. DraCo also offers an Amiga-compatible [[Amiga Zorro III|Zorro-II]] expansion bus and introduced a faster custom DraCoBus, capable of {{nowrap|30 MB/sec}} transfer rates (faster than Commodore's [[Amiga Zorro III|Zorro-III]]). The technology was later used in the Casablanca system, a set-top-box also designed for non-linear video editing.\n\nIn 1998, Index Information released the Access, an Amiga-clone similar to the Amiga 1200, but on a motherboard that could fit into a standard [[Drive bay#5%\"|5\u00bc\" drive bay]]. It features either a [[Motorola 68020|68020]] or [[Motorola 68030|68030]] CPU, with a redesigned [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] chipset, and runs AmigaOS 3.1.\n\nIn 1998, former Amiga employees (John Smith, Peter Kittel, [[Dave Haynie]] and Andy Finkel to mention few) formed a new company called PIOS. Their hardware platform, PIOS One, was aimed at Amiga, Atari and Macintosh users. The company was renamed to Met@box in 1999 until it folded.<ref name=\"AutoP5-27\" />\n\nThe NatAmi (short for ''Native Amiga'') hardware project began in 2005 with the aim of designing and building an Amiga clone motherboard that is enhanced with modern features.<ref name=\"AutoP5-28\" /> The NatAmi motherboard is a standard [[Mini-ITX]]-compatible form factor computer motherboard, powered by a Motorola/Freescale [[68060]] and its chipset. It is compatible with the original Amiga chipset, which has been inscribed on a programmable FPGA [[Altera]] chip on the board. The NatAmi is the second Amiga clone project after the [[Minimig]] motherboard, and its history is very similar to that of the [[C-One]] mainboard developed by [[Jeri Ellsworth]] and Jens Sch\u00f6nfeld. From a commercial point of view, Natami's circuitry and design are currently [[Proprietary software|closed source]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} One goal of the NatAmi project is to design an Amiga-compatible motherboard that includes up-to-date features but that does not rely on emulation (as in [[WinUAE]]), modern PC [[Intel]] components, or a modern [[PowerPC]] mainboard. As such, NatAmi is not intended to become another evolutionary heir to classic Amigas, such as with [[AmigaOne]] or [[Pegasos]] computers. This \"purist\" philosophy essentially limits the resulting processor speed but puts the focus on bandwidth and low latencies. The developers also recreated the entire Amiga chipset, freeing it from legacy Amiga limitations such as two [[megabyte]]s of audio and video graphics RAM as in the [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA chipset]], and rebuilt this new chipset by programming a modern [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] [[Altera]] Cyclone IV chip. Later, the developers decided to create from scratch a new software-form processor chip, codenamed \"N68050\" that resides in the physical Altera FPGA programmable chip.<ref name=\"AutoP5-29\" />\n\nIn 2006, two new Amiga clones were announced, both using [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] based hardware synthesis to replace the Amiga [[Original Chip Set|OCS]] custom chipset. The first, the [[Minimig]], is a personal project of Dutch engineer Dennis van Weeren. Referred to as \"new Amiga hardware\",<ref name=\"minimig\" /> the original model was built on a [[Xilinx]] Spartan-3 development board, but soon a dedicated board was developed. The minimig uses the FPGA to reproduce the custom Denise, Agnus, Paula and [[Amiga custom chips#Gary|Gary]] chips as well as both 8520 [[MOS Technology CIA|CIAs]] and implements a simple version of [[Amiga custom chips#Amber|Amber]]. The rest of the chips are an actual 68000 CPU, ram chips, and a PIC microcontroller for [[BIOS]] control.<ref name=\"minimig\" /> The design for Minimig was released as [[Open-source software|open-source]] on July 25, 2007. In February 2008, an Italian company [[Acube Systems]] began selling Minimig boards. A third party upgrade replaces the PIC microcontroller with a more powerful ARM processor, providing more functionality such as write access and support for hard disk images. The Minimig core has been ported to the FPGArcade \"Replay\" board. The Replay uses an FPGA with about {{nowrap|3 times}} more capacity and that does support the AGA chipset and a [[Motorola 68020|68020]] [[Soft core (synthesis)|soft core]] with [[Motorola 68030|68030]] capabilities. The Replay board is designed to implement many older computers and classic arcade machines.\n\nThe second is the Clone-A system announced by [[Individual Computers]]. As of mid 2007 it has been shown in its development form, with FPGA-based boards replacing the Amiga chipset and mounted on an Amiga 500 motherboard.<ref name=\"individual\" />\n\n=== Emulation ===\n{{Main|Amiga emulation}}\n\nLike many popular but discontinued platforms, the Amiga has been emulated so that software developed for the Amiga can be run on other computer platforms without the original hardware. Such emulators attempt to replicate the functionality of the Amiga architecture in software. As mentioned above, attempts have also been made to replicate the Amiga chipset in [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] chips.<ref name=\"AutoP5-31\" />\n\nOne of the most challenging aspects of emulation is the design of the Amiga chipset, which relies on cycle-critical timings. As a result, early emulators did not always achieve the intended results though later emulator versions can now accurately reproduce the behavior of Amiga systems.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n== Operating systems ==\n\n=== AmigaOS ===\n[[File:AmigaOne X1000 02.jpg|thumb|AmigaOne X1000 running AmigaOS 4.1]]\n\n{{Main|AmigaOS}}\n{{quote\n| \"[AmigaOS] remains one of the great operating systems of the past 20 years, incorporating a small kernel and tremendous [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] capabilities the likes of which have only recently been developed in [[OS/2]] and [[Windows NT]]. The biggest difference is that the AmigaOS could operate fully and multitask in as little as {{nowrap|250 K}} of address space.\n| ''[[John C. Dvorak]], PC Magazine'', October 1996.<ref name=\"AutoP5-32\" />\n}}\n\nAmigaOS is a single-user multitasking [[operating system]]. It was developed first by Commodore International, and initially introduced in 1985 with the Amiga 1000. Original versions run on the Motorola 68000 series of microprocessors, while AmigaOS 4 runs only on PowerPC microprocessors. At the time of release AmigaOS put an operating system that was well ahead of its time into the hands of the average consumer. It was one of the first commercially available consumer operating systems for personal computers to implement [[Preemption (computing)|preemptive]] multitasking.\n\nAnother notable feature was the combined use of both a [[command-line interface]] and [[graphical user interface]]. [[AmigaDOS]] was the disk operating system and command line portion of the OS and [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] the native graphical windowing, [[Icon (computing)|icon]]s, menu and pointer environment for file management and launching applications. Notably, AmigaDOS allowed long [[filename]]s (up to 107 characters) with [[Whitespace character|whitespace]] and did not require [[filename extension]]s. The [[windowing system]] and user interface engine that handles all input events is called [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition]].<ref name=\"amiga_intuition_ref\" />\n\nThe multi-tasking kernel is called [[Exec (Amiga)|Exec]]. It acts as a scheduler for tasks running on the system, providing pre-emptive multitasking with prioritised round-robin scheduling. It enabled true pre-emptive multitasking in as little as 256&nbsp;KB of free memory.<ref name=\"amiga_rkm_libs_exec\" /><ref name=\"holloway_oo_amiga_exec\" />\n\nAmigaOS does not implement [[memory protection]], because the [[Motorola 68000|68000]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] does not include a [[memory management unit]].<ref name=\"google.groups.com (Memory Protection)\" /> Although this speeds and eases [[inter-process communication]] because programs can communicate by simply passing a [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]] back and forth, the lack of memory protection made the AmigaOS more vulnerable to [[Crash (computing)|crashes]] from badly behaving [[Computer program|programs]] than other multitasking systems that did implement memory protection,<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lr8ldHhh_wsC&lpg=PA74&pg=PA74 |title=Tech Book 1 - Published articles Oct 2006 - June 2008 - Michael Reed - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-07-24}}</ref> and Amiga OS is fundamentally incapable of enforcing any form of security model since any program had full access to the system. A co-operational memory protection feature was implemented in AmigaOS 4 and could be retrofitted to old AmigaOS systems using Enforcer or CyberGuard tools.\n\nThe problem was somewhat exacerbated by Commodore's initial decision to release documentation relating not only to the OS's underlying software routines, but also to the hardware itself, enabling intrepid programmers who had developed their skills on the [[Commodore 64]] to [[PEEK and POKE|POKE]] the hardware directly, as was done on the older platform. While the decision to release the documentation was a popular one and allowed the creation of fast, sophisticated sound and graphics routines in games and demos, it also contributed to system instability as some programmers lacked the expertise to program at this level. For this reason, when the new [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] chipset was released, [[Commodore International|Commodore]] declined to release low-level documentation in an attempt to force developers into using the approved software routines.\n\n==== Influence on other operating systems ====\nAmigaOS directly or indirectly inspired the development of various operating systems. [[MorphOS]] and [[AROS Research Operating System|AROS]] clearly inherit heavily from the structure of AmigaOS as explained directly in articles regarding these two operating systems. AmigaOS also influenced [[BeOS]], which featured a centralized system of [[Amiga support and maintenance software#Datatypes|Datatypes]], similar to that present in AmigaOS. Likewise, [[DragonFly BSD]] was also inspired by AmigaOS as stated by Dragonfly developer Matthew Dillon who is a former Amiga developer.<ref name=\"AutoP5-33\" /><ref name=\"AutoP5-34\" /> [[WindowLab]] and [[amiwm]] are among several [[window manager]]s for the [[X Window System]] seek to mimic the Workbench interface. IBM licensed the Amiga GUI from Commodore in exchange for the REXX language license. This allowed [[OS/2]] to have the WPS ([[Workplace Shell]]) GUI shell for OS/2 2.0, a 32-bit operating system.<ref>[http://www.os2bbs.com/os2news/OS2Warp.html OS/2 News, OS/2 BBS] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020022353/http://www.os2bbs.com/os2news/OS2Warp.html |date=October 20, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Doug McIlroy |url=http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch03s02.html#os_2 |title=OS/2 Eric S.

It supports the [[Amiga 2500]] and Amiga 3000 and is included with the [[Amiga 3000UX]]. Among other unusual features of Amix is a hardware-accelerated windowing system that can scroll windows without copying data. Amix is not supported on the later Amiga systems based on [[Motorola 68040|68040]] or [[Motorola 68060|68060]] processors.\n\nOther, still maintained, operating systems are available for the classic Amiga platform, including Linux and [[NetBSD]]. Both require a CPU with [[Memory management unit|MMU]] such as the [[Motorola 68020|68020]] with [[Motorola 68851|68851]] or full versions of the [[Motorola 68030|68030]], [[Motorola 68040|68040]] or [[Motorola 68060|68060]]. There is also a version of Linux for Amigas with PowerPC accelerator cards. [[Debian]] and [[Yellow Dog Linux]] can run on the AmigaOne.\n\nThere is an official, older version of [[OpenBSD]]. The last Amiga release is 3.2. [[MINIX]] 1.5.10 also runs on Amiga.<ref name=\"AutoP5-35\" />\n\n=== Emulating other systems ===\n{{Main|Emulation on the Amiga}}\n\nThe Amiga is able to emulate other computer platforms ranging from many 8-bit systems such as the [[ZX Spectrum]], [[Commodore 64]], Nintendo Game Boy, Nintendo Entertainment System, [[Apple II]] and the [[TRS-80]]. The Commodore PC-Transformer software emulated an IBM 5150 at 1&nbsp;MHz in Monochrome mode. Later PC-Bridgecards were a full hardware PC on a card with 8086/80286/80386 Intel chips running MS-DOS and Windows in an Amiga window. A-Max emulated an Apple Macintosh using a serial port dongle that had a Macintosh ROM on it. The Amiga had the same 68000 CPU as the Macintosh and, using a Macintosh emulator, could run Mac 68K operating systems and programs. The Amiga could not directly read Macintosh 3.5\" floppies, however, due to their proprietary format. Further, it required a compatible Macintosh for a copy of its ROM. The Atari ST was also emulated. [[MAME]] (the arcade machine emulator) is also available for Amiga systems with PPC accelerator card upgrades.\n\n== Amiga software ==\n{{Main|Amiga software}}\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s the platform became particularly popular for gaming, [[demoscene]] activities and creative software uses. During this time commercial developers marketed a wide range of games and creative software, often developing titles simultaneously for the [[Atari ST]] due to the similar hardware architecture. Popular creative software included [[3D computer graphics software|3D rendering]] (ray-tracing) packages, [[raster graphics editor|bitmap graphics editors]], [[desktop video]] software, software development packages and \"[[Tracker (music software)|tracker]]\" music editors.\n\nUntil the late 1990s the Amiga remained a popular platform for non-commercial software, often developed by enthusiasts, and much of which was freely redistributable. An on-line archive, [[Aminet]], was created in 1992 and until around 1996 was the largest public archive of software, art and documents for any platform.\n\n== Marketing ==\n[[File:Amiga-90sLogo.gif|thumb|Logo used in the US on some product packaging for the Amiga 500{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}]]\n[[File:Recent Amiga.svg|thumb|Amiga Technologies logo incorporating the \"Boing Ball\" (1996)]]\n\nThe name ''Amiga'' was chosen by the developers from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word for a female friend, because they knew Spanish,<ref name=\"AutoP5-36\" /> and because it occurred before [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Atari]] alphabetically. It also conveyed the message that the Amiga computer line was \"user friendly\" as a pun or play on words.<ref name=\"AutoP5-37\" />\n\nThe first official Amiga logo was a rainbow-colored double [[check mark]]. In later marketing material Commodore largely dropped the checkmark and used logos styled with various typefaces. Although it was never adopted as a [[trademark]] by Commodore, the \"Boing Ball\" has been synonymous with Amiga since its launch. It became an unofficial and enduring theme after a visually impressive animated demonstration at the 1984 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1984 showing a checkered ball bouncing and rotating. Following Escom's purchase of Commodore in 1996, the Boing Ball theme was incorporated into a new logo.<ref name=\"AutoP5-38\" />\n\nEarly Commodore advertisements attempted to cast the computer as an all-purpose business machine, though the Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer.<ref name=ad1987a/><ref name=ad1987b/> Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s Commodore primarily placed advertising in computer magazines and occasionally in national newspapers and on television.\n\n== Legacy ==\nSince the demise of Commodore, various groups have marketed successors to the original Amiga line:\n\n* [[Genesi]] sold PowerPC based hardware under the [[Pegasos]] brand running AmigaOS and [[MorphOS]];\n* [[Eyetech]] sold PowerPC based hardware under the [[AmigaOne]] brand from 2002 to 2005 running AmigaOS 4;\n* Amiga Kit distributes and sells PowerPC based hardware under the [[AmigaOne]] brand from 2010 to present day running [[AmigaOS 4]];\n* [[ACube Systems]] sells the AmigaOS 3 compatible [[Minimig]] system with a Freescale MC68SEC000 CPU (Motorola 68000 compatible) and AmigaOS 4 compatible [[Sam440ep|Sam440]] / [[Sam460ex|Sam460]] / AmigaOne 500 systems with PowerPC processors;\n* A-EON Technology Ltd sells the AmigaOS 4 compatible [[AmigaOne X1000]] system with P.A. Semi [[PWRficient]] PA6T-1682M processor.\n* Amiga Kit Amiga Store, Vesalia Computer and AMIGAstore.eu sell numerous items from aftermarket components to refurbished classic systems.\n\nAmigaOS and MorphOS are commercial proprietary operating systems. AmigaOS 4, based on AmigaOS 3.1 source code with some parts of version 3.9, is developed by [[Hyperion Entertainment]] and runs on PowerPC based hardware. MorphOS, based on some parts of AROS source code, is developed by MorphOS Team and is continued on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and other PowerPC based hardware.\n\nThere is also [[AROS Research Operating System|AROS]], a free and open source operating system (re-implementation of the AmigaOS 3.1 APIs), for Amiga 68k, x86 and ARM hardware (one version runs Linux-hosted on the [[Raspberry Pi]]). In particular, AROS for Amiga 68k hardware aims to create an open source Kickstart ROM replacement for emulation purpose and/or for use on real \"classic\" hardware.<ref name=\"AutoP5-39\" />\n\n== Amiga community ==\nAfter Commodore went bankrupt in 1994, an active Amiga community continued to support the platform long after mainstream commercial vendors abandoned it. The most popular Amiga magazine, ''[[Amiga Format]]'', continued to publish editions until 2000, some six years after Commodore filed for bankruptcy. Another magazine, ''[[Amiga Active]]'', was launched in 1999 and was published until 2001. In spite of declining interest in the platform, there was a bi-weekly specialist column in the UK weekly magazine ''[[Micro Mart]]''.\n\nSeveral notable magazines are in publication today: ''Amiga Future'',<ref name=\"AutoP5-40\" /> which is available in both English and German; ''Bitplane.it'',<ref name=\"AutoP5-41\" /> a bi-monthly magazine in Italian; and ''AmigaPower'',<ref name=\"AutoP5-42\" /> a long-running French magazine.\n\nOnline Amiga magazines still exists like [http://obligement.free.fr Obligement], a French publication available since 1997.\n\n== Notable uses ==\n{{fiction trivia|date=August 2012}}\n\nThe Amiga series of computers found a place in early computer graphic design and television presentation. Below are some examples of notable uses and users:\n* Season 1 and part of season 2 of the television series ''[[Babylon 5]]'' were rendered in LightWave 3D on Amigas.<ref name=\"lurk-effects\" /><ref name=\"lurk-thornton\" /> Other television series using Amigas for special effects included ''[[SeaQuest DSV]]''<ref name=\"AutoP5-46\" /> and ''[[Max Headroom (TV series)|Max Headroom]]''.<ref name=\"AutoP5-47\" />\n\nIn addition, many other celebrities and notable individuals have made use of the Amiga:<ref name=\"AutoP5-48\" />\n\n* [[Andy Warhol]] was an early user of the Amiga and appeared at the launch,<ref name=\"AutoP5-49\" /> where he made a computer artwork of [[Debbie Harry]].<ref name=\"AutoP5-50\" /> Warhol used the Amiga to create a new style of art made with computers, and was the author of a multimedia opera called ''[[You Are the One (Andy Warhol)|You Are the One]]'', which consists of an animated sequence featuring images of actress [[Marilyn Monroe]] assembled in a short movie with a soundtrack. The video was discovered on two old Amiga floppies in a drawer in Warhol's studio and repaired in 2006 by the Detroit [[Museum of New Art]].<ref name=\"AutoP5-51\" /> The pop artist has been quoted as saying: ''\"The thing I like most about doing this kind of work on the Amiga is that it looks like my work in other media\"''.<ref name=\"AutoP5-52\" /><ref name=\"AutoP5-53\" />\n* Artist [[Jean Giraud|Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud]] credits the Amiga he bought for his son as a bridge to learning about \"using paint box programs\".<ref name=\"AutoP5-58\" /> He uploaded some of his early experiments to the file sharing forums on [[CompuServe]].\n* The [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' contains a computer animated music video parody of the [[Dire Straits]] song \"[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]\", titled \"[[Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*]]\". According to the DVD commentary track, this spoof was created on an Amiga home computer.<ref name=\"AutoP5-60\" />\n* [[Rolf Harris]] used an Amiga to digitize his hand-drawn art work for animation on his television series, ''Rolf's Cartoon Club''.\n* [[Todd Rundgren]]'s video \"Change Myself\" was produced with Toaster and Lightwave.\n* Scottish pop artist [[Calvin Harris]] composed his 2007 debut album ''[[I Created Disco]]'' with an [[Amiga 1200]].<ref name=\"AutoP5-61\" />\n* [[Susumu Hirasawa]], a [[Japan]]ese [[Progressive rock|progressive]]-[[Electronic music|electronic]] [[artist]] is known for using Amigas to compose and perform music, aid his live shows and make his promotional videos. He has also been inspired by the Amiga, and has referenced it in his lyrics. His December 13, 1994 \"Adios Jay\" Interactive Live Show was dedicated to (then recently deceased) Jay Miner. He also used the Amiga to create the virtual drummer TAINACO, who was a CG rendered figure whose performance was made with Elan Performer and was projected with DCTV. He also composed and performed \"Eastern-boot\", the AmigaOS 4 boot jingle.\n* Electronic musician [[Max Tundra]] created his three albums with an Amiga 500.<ref name=\"AutoP5-62\" />\n* [[Bob Casale]], keyboardist and guitarist of the [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[Devo]] used Amiga computer graphics on the album cover to Devo's album ''[[Total Devo]]''\n* Most of [[Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver|''Pok\u00e9mon Gold'' and ''Silver'']]'s music was created on an Amiga computer, converted to MIDI, and then reconverted to the game's music format.<ref name=\"Masuda's blog post about HeartGold/SoulSilver music\">{{cite web|last=Masuda|first=Junichi|title=HIDDEN POWER of masuda|url=http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir_english/?p=185|publisher=GameFreak|accessdate=7 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123075400/http://www.gamefreak.co.jp/blog/dir_english/?p=185|archive-date=23 November 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Other uses ===\nThe Amiga was also used in a number of special purpose applications:\n* Amigas were used in various [[NASA]] laboratories to keep track of low orbiting satellites, and were still used until 2004 (but eventually discontinued and sold in 2006). Amigas were used at Kennedy Space Center to run strip-chart recorders, to format and display data, and control stations of platforms for [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta rocket]] launches.<ref name=\"AutoP5-64\" /><ref name=\"AutoP5-65\" />\n* [[Palomar Observatory]] used Amigas to calibrate and control the [[Charge-coupled device|CCDs]] in their telescopes, as well as to display and store the digitized images they collected.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/info-magazine-13/Info_Issue_13_1987_Jan-Feb#page/n29/mode/2up|title=Info magazine issue 13|access-date=2016-07-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709030920/http://archive.org/stream/info-magazine-13/Info_Issue_13_1987_Jan-Feb#page/n29/mode/2up|archive-date=2016-07-09|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[London Transport Museum]] developed their own interactive multi-media software for the CD32. The software included a walkthrough of various exhibits and a virtual tour of the museum.<ref name=\"AutoP5-66\" />\n* Amiga 500 motherboards were used, in conjunction with a [[LaserDisc]] player and [[genlock]] device, in arcade games manufactured by [[American Laser Games]].<ref name=\"AutoP5-67\" />\n* A custom [[Amiga 4000T]] motherboard was used in the HDI 1000 medical ultrasound system built by Advanced Technology Labs (now part of Philips Medical Systems).<ref name=\"AutoP5-68\" />\n* Four Amiga 2000s were used from 1988 to 1991 to develop the digital displays panels installed in the M1-A2 Abrams Main Battle Tank built by General Dynamics Land Systems. In the General Dynamics Simulation Laboratory, the Amigas interfaced with a central simulation environment computer and produced graphics for the display panels. During demonstrations at Fort Knox, the Amigas did not interact with each other, but instead operated in \"remote mode\" because the simulation environment computer was not portable.\n*{{As of|2015}}, the Grand Rapids Public School district still uses a Commodore Amiga 2000 computer, complete with 1200 baud modem, to automate its air conditioning and heating systems for the 19 schools covered by the GRPS district. \"The system controls the start/stop of boilers, the start/stop of fans, pumps, [it] monitors space temperatures, and so on.\" The system has been running day and night for decades.<ref name=\"AutoP5-69\">{{cite news|author=Eric Limer|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a16010/30-year-old-computer-runs-school-heat/|title=One Ancient Commodore Amiga Runs the Heat and AC for 19 Public Schools|publisher=Hearst Digital Media|date=June 12, 2015|accessdate=June 15, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615002258/http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/infrastructure/a16010/30-year-old-computer-runs-school-heat/|archive-date=June 15, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://woodtv.com/2015/06/11/1980s-computer-controls-grps-heat-and-ac/|title=1980s computer controls GRPS heat and AC|access-date=2016-02-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304023037/http://woodtv.com/2015/06/11/1980s-computer-controls-grps-heat-and-ac/|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*Amiga models, generally 1000s and 2000s, were utilized by the [[Pop (U.S. TV network)|Prevue Guide]] (later renamed the Prevue Channel), a specialized cable network designed to provide TV listings. Though its history stretched back to 1981, the Prevue Guide did not start using Amigas on a wide-scale basis until the late 1980s. Amigas were used to generate program listings locally at the headend office, while a C-band satellite feed provided promotional material for cable networks (occupying the top half of the screen above the local listings). Amigas were also used to power the [[pay-per-view]] centric sister service Sneak Prevue in conjunction with laserdiscs and a C-band feed. Eventually, Prevue was relaunched in 1999 as the TV Guide Channel and due to Commodore's bankruptcy and the general outmodedness of the Amiga platform, the Amigas were phased out in favor of custom-built Windows NT computers instead.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n* [[The Weather Network]] used Amigas to display the weather on TV.

By Robert Spence Hardy</ref>\n\nThe development of the Magadhi language into its current form is unknown. However, language scholars have come to a conclusion that Magahi along with [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Bhojpuri]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]] and [[Oriya language|Oriya]] originated from the Magadhi Prakrit during the 8th to 11th centuries. These different dialects differentiated themselves and took their own course of growth and development. But it is not certain when exactly it took place. It was probably such an unidentified period during which modern Indian languages begin to take modern shape. By the end of the 12th century, the development of [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages#Apabhramsa|Apabhramsa]] reached its climax. [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], Marathi, Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Maithili and other modern languages took definite shape in their literary writings in the beginning of the 14th century. The distinct shape of Magadhi can be seen in the ''Dohakosha'' written by Sarahapa and Kauhapa. Magahi had a setback due to the transition period of Magadha administration.<ref>Maitra Asim, ''Magahi Culture'', Cosmo Publications, New Delhi (1983), pp. 64</ref> Traditionally, strolling bards recite long epic poems in this dialect, and it was because of this that the word \"Magahi\" came to mean \"a bard\". [[Kaithi]] is the script generally used for it. The pronunciation in Magahi is not as broad as in Maithili and there are a number of verbal forms for each person.<ref name=\"Maithili and Magahi\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bihar.ws/info/Bihari-Languages/Maithili-and-Magahi.html|title=Maithili and Magahi|accessdate=10 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723144641/http://bihar.ws/info/Bihari-Languages/Maithili-and-Magahi.html|archive-date=23 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Historically, Magahi had no famous written literature. There are many popular songs throughout the area in which the language is spoken, and strolling bards recite various long epic poems which are known more or less over the whole of Northern India. In Magahi spoken area folk singers sing a good number of ballads. Introduction of Urdu meant a setback to local languages as its Persian script was alien to local people.\n\nThe first success for spreading Hindi occurred in Bihar in 1881, when Hindi displaced [[Urdu]] as the official language of the province. After independence, Hindi was given the sole official status through the Bihar Official Language Act, 1950.<ref>[[Paul Brass|Brass Paul R.]], ''The Politics of India Since Independence'', Cambridge University Press, pp. 183</ref>\n\n==Speakers of Magahi==\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2019}}\nThere are several dialects of Magadhi. It is spoken in the area which formed the core of the ancient kingdom of [[Magadha]] - the modern districts of [[Patna District|Patna]], [[Nalanda District|Nalanda]], [[Gaya District|Gaya]], [[Jehanabad District|Jehanabad]], [[Arwal District|Arwal]], [[Aurangabad District, Bihar|Aurangabad]], [[Lakhisarai District|Lakhisarai]], [[Sheikhpura District|Sheikhpura]] and [[Nawada District|Nawada and Munger]]. Magahi is bounded on the north by the various forms of [[Maithili language|Maithili]] spoken in [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] across the Ganga. On the west it is bounded by the [[Bhojpuri]], On the northeast it is bounded by Maithili and [[Angika]].\nA blend of [[Magahi]] known as [[Khortha language|Khortha]] is spoken by non-tribal populace in [[North Chotanagpur division]] of [[Jharkhand]] which comprises districts of [[Bokaro district|Bokaro]], [[Chatra]], [[Dhanbad]], [[Giridih]], [[Hazaribagh]], [[Koderma]] and [[Ramgarh district|Ramgarh]]. People of Southern Bihar and Northern Jharkhand are mostly speakers of Magadhi language.<ref>Jain Dhanesh, Cardona George, The Indo-Aryan Languages, pp500</ref> Magahi is also spoken in [[Malda district]] of [[West Bengal]].<ref name=\"Magahi01\"/><ref name=\"Magahi02\"/> According to 2011 Census, there were approximately 20.7&nbsp;million Magadhi speakers.<ref name=\"census2011\"/> For most of the magahi-speakers, Hindi is the generic name for their language. The number of Magadhi speakers is difficult to indicate because of unreliable sources.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Scripts and literary tradition==\n\nMagadhi is generally written using [[Devanagari]] script. A later-developed script of Magadhi is Kaithi.<ref name=\"Maithili and Magahi\"/>\nThere have been effort by scholars in the Magahi area to explore and identify a literary tradition for Magadhi. Magadhi has a rich tradition of folk literature, and in modern times there have been various activities in the publication of literary writing. Magahi Parishad was established in Patna in 1952, which was renamed Bihar Magahi Mandal. ''Magadhi'', a journal, was started at the same time, which was renamed ''Bihan'', meaning \"tomorrow\" or the coming dawn. Later Akhil Bhartiya Magahi Sahitya Sammelan was established by Dr Ram Prasad Singh in 1977 and published a well known magazine \" Magahi Lok\". Another very famous monthly journal was started by Magahi Academy, Gaya edited by Dr. Ram Prasad Singh. Another magazine \"Magadhi\" is published by Akhil Bhartiya Magahi Bhasa Sammelan. It is headed by Kavi Yogesh. [[Nalanda Open University]] offers various courses on Magahi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nalandaopenuniversity.com/courses.html |title=Nalanda Open University - Courses |accessdate=17 November 2018}}</ref> Maghi language has a lot of poets who with their writings has influenced the common mass a lot. Among those poets the name of ''Maghi Kokil'' Jairam Singh is indelible. He is one of the scintillating gems of Maghi Sahitya. His song \"\u092c\u0926\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0917\u093e\u0935 \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u091c\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e\" created an unforgettable imprint on the minds of Maghi lovers.

But no manuscriptic text has been seen after its prakrit form synthesised except that nowadays people have given it a book form.\n\nMagadhi is often considered a dialect of Hindi which has been deemed incorrect by linguists. Its true form [[Magadhi Prakrit]] later developed into languages like [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]] and [[Odia language|Odia]]. It has more similarity to the eastern languages than far west [[Braj]], [[Bagheli]] or [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] languages.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}\nResearch work done in this field:\n* Dr Munishwar Jha - \"Magadhi And Its Formation,\" Calcutta Sanskrit College Research Series, 1967, 256 pp\n* Dr Saryu Prasad - \"A Descriptive Study of Magahi Phonology\", Ph.D. thesis submitted to Patna University.\n* Dr A.C.

By Robert Spence Hardy</ref>\n\nThe development of the Magadhi language into its current form is unknown. However, language scholars have come to a conclusion that Magahi along with [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Bhojpuri]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]] and [[Oriya language|Oriya]] originated from the Magadhi Prakrit during the 8th to 11th centuries. These different dialects differentiated themselves and took their own course of growth and development. But it is not certain when exactly it took place. It was probably such an unidentified period during which modern Indian languages begin to take modern shape. By the end of the 12th century, the development of [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages#Apabhramsa|Apabhramsa]] reached its climax. [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], Marathi, Bengali, Assamese, Oriya, Maithili and other modern languages took definite shape in their literary writings in the beginning of the 14th century. The distinct shape of Magadhi can be seen in the ''Dohakosha'' written by Sarahapa and Kauhapa. Magahi had a setback due to the transition period of Magadha administration.<ref>Maitra Asim, ''Magahi Culture'', Cosmo Publications, New Delhi (1983), pp. 64</ref> Traditionally, strolling bards recite long epic poems in this dialect, and it was because of this that the word \"Magahi\" came to mean \"a bard\". [[Kaithi]] is the script generally used for it. The pronunciation in Magahi is not as broad as in Maithili and there are a number of verbal forms for each person.<ref name=\"Maithili and Magahi\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bihar.ws/info/Bihari-Languages/Maithili-and-Magahi.html|title=Maithili and Magahi|accessdate=10 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723144641/http://bihar.ws/info/Bihari-Languages/Maithili-and-Magahi.html|archive-date=23 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Historically, Magahi had no famous written literature. There are many popular songs throughout the area in which the language is spoken, and strolling bards recite various long epic poems which are known more or less over the whole of Northern India. In Magahi spoken area folk singers sing a good number of ballads. Introduction of Urdu meant a setback to local languages as its Persian script was alien to local people.\n\nThe first success for spreading Hindi occurred in Bihar in 1881, when Hindi displaced [[Urdu]] as the official language of the province. After independence, Hindi was given the sole official status through the Bihar Official Language Act, 1950.<ref>[[Paul Brass|Brass Paul R.]], ''The Politics of India Since Independence'', Cambridge University Press, pp. 183</ref>\n\n==Speakers of Magahi==\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2019}}\nThere are several dialects of Magadhi. It is spoken in the area which formed the core of the ancient kingdom of [[Magadha]] - the modern districts of [[Patna District|Patna]], [[Nalanda District|Nalanda]], [[Gaya District|Gaya]], [[Jehanabad District|Jehanabad]], [[Arwal District|Arwal]], [[Aurangabad District, Bihar|Aurangabad]], [[Lakhisarai District|Lakhisarai]], [[Sheikhpura District|Sheikhpura]] and [[Nawada District|Nawada and Munger]]. Magahi is bounded on the north by the various forms of [[Maithili language|Maithili]] spoken in [[Mithila (region)|Mithila]] across the Ganga. On the west it is bounded by the [[Bhojpuri]], On the northeast it is bounded by Maithili and [[Angika]].\nA blend of [[Magahi]] known as [[Khortha language|Khortha]] is spoken by non-tribal populace in [[North Chotanagpur division]] of [[Jharkhand]] which comprises districts of [[Bokaro district|Bokaro]], [[Chatra]], [[Dhanbad]], [[Giridih]], [[Hazaribagh]], [[Koderma]] and [[Ramgarh district|Ramgarh]]. People of Southern Bihar and Northern Jharkhand are mostly speakers of Magadhi language.<ref>Jain Dhanesh, Cardona George, The Indo-Aryan Languages, pp500</ref> Magahi is also spoken in [[Malda district]] of [[West Bengal]].<ref name=\"Magahi01\"/><ref name=\"Magahi02\"/> According to 2011 Census, there were approximately 20.7&nbsp;million Magadhi speakers.<ref name=\"census2011\"/> For most of the magahi-speakers, Hindi is the generic name for their language. The number of Magadhi speakers is difficult to indicate because of unreliable sources.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==Scripts and literary tradition==\n\nMagadhi is generally written using [[Devanagari]] script. A later-developed script of Magadhi is Kaithi.<ref name=\"Maithili and Magahi\"/>\nThere have been effort by scholars in the Magahi area to explore and identify a literary tradition for Magadhi. Magadhi has a rich tradition of folk literature, and in modern times there have been various activities in the publication of literary writing. Magahi Parishad was established in Patna in 1952, which was renamed Bihar Magahi Mandal. ''Magadhi'', a journal, was started at the same time, which was renamed ''Bihan'', meaning \"tomorrow\" or the coming dawn. Later Akhil Bhartiya Magahi Sahitya Sammelan was established by Dr Ram Prasad Singh in 1977 and published a well known magazine \" Magahi Lok\". Another very famous monthly journal was started by Magahi Academy, Gaya edited by Dr. Ram Prasad Singh. Another magazine \"Magadhi\" is published by Akhil Bhartiya Magahi Bhasa Sammelan. It is headed by Kavi Yogesh. [[Nalanda Open University]] offers various courses on Magahi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nalandaopenuniversity.com/courses.html |title=Nalanda Open University - Courses |accessdate=17 November 2018}}</ref> Maghi language has a lot of poets who with their writings has influenced the common mass a lot. Among those poets the name of ''Maghi Kokil'' Jairam Singh is indelible. He is one of the scintillating gems of Maghi Sahitya. His song \"\u092c\u0926\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0917\u093e\u0935 \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u091c\u0930\u093f\u092f\u093e\" created an unforgettable imprint on the minds of Maghi lovers. His recently published book \"\u091a\u093f\u091c\u094b\u0930\" contains a variety of poems. Another magahi poet known locally as Lal Baba (\u0932\u093e\u0932 \u092c\u093e\u092c\u093e) for his red coloured dress, Ramashish Prasad Singh of [[Lakhisarai]] has written several poem and some of his famous collection is printed in book \"Magahi Ke Phoool\" (\u092e\u0917\u0939\u0940 \u0915\u0947 \u092b\u0942\u0932).

It has few indigenous written literature, though a number of folk-tales and popular songs have been handed down for centuries from mouth to mouth and this remain main form of knowledge transfer in literature.\n\nStrolling bards also known by name \u201cBhad\u201d or [[Baul]] recite long epic poems in the dialect, and sing verses in honour of the heroic achievements of legendary princes and brave men of ancient time like \"Alha aur udal\". But no manuscriptic text has been seen after its prakrit form synthesised except that nowadays people have given it a book form.\n\nMagadhi is often considered a dialect of Hindi which has been deemed incorrect by linguists. Its true form [[Magadhi Prakrit]] later developed into languages like [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]] and [[Odia language|Odia]]. It has more similarity to the eastern languages than far west [[Braj]], [[Bagheli]] or [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] languages.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}\nResearch work done in this field:\n* Dr Munishwar Jha - \"Magadhi And Its Formation,\" Calcutta Sanskrit College Research Series, 1967, 256 pp\n* Dr Saryu Prasad - \"A Descriptive Study of Magahi Phonology\", Ph.D. thesis submitted to Patna University.\n* Dr A.C.
