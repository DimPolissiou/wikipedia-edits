In most cases, the association, especially when formalised by [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local government]], is known as \"[[Sister cities|town twinning]]\" (though other terms, such as \"partner towns\" or \"sister cities\" are sometimes used instead), and while most of the places included are towns, the list also comprises villages, cities, districts, counties, etc. with similar links.\n\n[[File:Sign showing Greystones, Ireland, as a twin city to Holyhead, Wales.jpg|thumb|Sign posted at the entrance of Greystones, Co.

There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a [[backdoor pilot]], in the form of a television film titled ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''. The programme was [[History of Doctor Who#2000s|relaunched in 2005]], and since then has been produced in-house by [[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Wales]] in [[Cardiff]]. ''Doctor Who'' has also spawned numerous [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-offs]], including comic books, films, novels, audio dramas, and the television series ''[[Torchwood]]'' (2006\u20132011), ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' (2007\u20132011), ''[[K-9 (TV series)|K-9]]'' (2009\u20132010), and ''[[Class (2016 TV series)|Class]]'' (2016), and has been the subject of many parodies and references in popular culture.\n\nThirteen actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show with the [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|concept of regeneration]] into a new [[incarnation]], a [[plot device]] in which a Time Lord \"transforms\" into a new body when the current one is too badly harmed to heal normally. Each actor's portrayal is unique, but all represent stages in the life of the same character, and together, they form a single lifetime with a single narrative. The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The Doctor is currently portrayed by [[Jodie Whittaker]], who took on the role after [[Peter Capaldi]]'s exit in the 2017 Christmas special \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\".\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\n''Doctor Who'' follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]] who goes by the name \"[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]\". The Doctor fled Gallifrey in a stolen [[TARDIS]] (\"Time and Relative Dimension in Space\"), a [[time travel|time machine]] that travels by materialising into and dematerialising out of the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a \"chameleon circuit\" intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise; due to a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British [[police box]].\n\nAcross time and space, the Doctor's many incarnations often find events that pique their curiosity and try to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only ingenuity and minimal resources, such as the versatile [[sonic screwdriver]]. The Doctor rarely travels alone and often brings one or more [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] to share these adventures. These companions are usually humans, owing to the Doctor's fascination with planet Earth, which also leads to frequent collaborations with the international military task force [[UNIT]] when the Earth is threatened. The Doctor is centuries old and, as a Time Lord, has the ability to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] in case of mortal damage to the body, taking on a new appearance and personality. The Doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during their travels, including the [[Dalek]]s, the [[Cybermen]], and [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], another renegade Time Lord.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Doctor Who}}\n''Doctor Who'' first appeared on [[BBC One|BBC TV]] at 17:16:20 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] on Saturday, 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled programme time, due to the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] the previous day.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), p. 54</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/unearthlychild/detail.shtml|title=An Unearthly Child|publisher=BBC|date=16 August 2012|access-date=20 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626184328/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/unearthlychild/detail.shtml|archive-date=26 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length. Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The [[BBC television drama|head of drama]] [[Sydney Newman]] was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) [[Donald Wilson (writer and producer)|Donald Wilson]] and staff writer [[C. E. Webber]]. Writer [[Anthony Coburn]], [[Script editor|story editor]] [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]] and initial producer [[Verity Lambert]] also heavily contributed to the development of the series.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), pp. 157\u2013230 (\"Production Diary\")</ref><ref group=note>Newman is often given sole creator credit for the series. Some reference works such as ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1947\u20131979'' by Vincent Terrace erroneously credit Terry Nation with creating ''Doctor Who'', because of the way his name is credited in the two Peter Cushing films.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}<br />Newman and Lambert's role in originating the series was recognised in the 2007 episode \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]\", in which the Doctor, in disguise as a human named John Smith, gives his parents' names as Sydney and Verity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1992), p. 3.</ref> as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963, Whitaker commissioned [[Terry Nation]] to write a story under the title ''The Mutants''. As originally written, the [[Dalek]]s and [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thals]] were the victims of an alien [[neutron bomb]] attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"[[bug-eyed monster]]s\". According to producer Verity Lambert; \"We didn't have a lot of choice&nbsp;\u2014 we only had the Dalek serial to go&nbsp;... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.\" Nation's script became the second ''Doctor Who'' serial&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Daleks]]'' (also known as ''The Mutants''). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.<ref>Steve Tribe, James Goss ''Dr Who: The Dalek Handbook'' [[BBC Books]] [[Random House]] 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-84990-232-8}} Pg9</ref>\n\nThe BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC 1]].

[[Philip Segal]], a British [[expatriate]] who worked for [[Columbia Pictures]]' television arm in the United States, had approached the BBC about such a venture as early as July 1989, while the 26th season was still in production.<ref name=\"8thdrspecial\">Doctor Who Magazine Eighth Doctor Special, Panini Comics 2003</ref> Segal's negotiations eventually led to a [[Doctor Who (film)|''Doctor Who'' television film]], broadcast on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] in 1996 as an [[international co-production]] between Fox, [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], the BBC and [[BBC Worldwide]].

This was prompted by the poor health of the original star, [[William Hartnell]].

In ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', [[Richard Hurndall]] played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell's death in 1975; 34 years later [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] similarly replaced Hartnell in ''[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]''.

In other media, the Doctor has been played by various other actors, including [[Peter Cushing]] in [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|two films]].\n\nThe casting of a new Doctor has often inspired debate and speculation. Common topics of focus include the Doctor's gender (prior to the casting of Whittaker, all official incarnations were male), race (all Doctors were white prior to the casting of [[Jo Martin]] in \"[[Fugitive of the Judoon]]\") and age (the youngest actor to be cast is Smith at 26, and the oldest are Capaldi and Hartnell, both 55).<ref>Ted B.

In \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), the Eleventh Doctor meets a previously unseen incarnation of himself, subsequently revealed to be the [[War Doctor]].<ref name=\"HurtDoctor\" /> In the following episode, \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", David Tennant's [[Tenth Doctor]] appeared alongside [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and [[John Hurt]] as the [[War Doctor]], as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Day of the Doctor|series=Doctor Who|network=BBC|station=BBC One|location=Cardiff|date=23 November 2013|minutes=60}}</ref> Additionally, multiple incarnations of the Doctor have met in various [[Doctor Who#Audios|audio dramas]] and [[Doctor Who#Books|novels]] based on the television show. In 2017, the First Doctor (this time portrayed by [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]]) returned alongside Peter Capaldi in \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\" and \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\". In 2020\u2019s \u201cFugitive of the Judoon\u201d, Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor meets Jo Martin\u2019s incarnation of the Doctor, subsequently known as the Fugitive Doctor. They met later, albeit briefly, in \u201cThe Timeless Children\u201d later that year.\n\n====Revelations about the Doctor====\n{{See also|The Doctor (Doctor Who)#Inconsistencies|l1=The Doctor: Inconsistencies}}\n\nThroughout the programme's long history, there have been revelations about the Doctor that have raised additional questions. In ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor might not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted might have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms \"Fourth\", the First Doctor excitedly replies \"Goodness me. So there are five of me now.\" In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself \"the Eleventh\" in \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\". In the 2013 episode \"The Time of the Doctor,\" the Eleventh Doctor clarified he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration. The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied \"Fall of the Eleventh\" which had been trailed throughout the series.\n\nDuring the Seventh Doctor's era, it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord. In the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 television film]], the Eighth Doctor describes himself as being \"half human\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml|title=Doctor Who: the TV movie|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227174852/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml|archive-date=27 February 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The BBC's FAQ for the programme notes that \"purists tend to disregard this\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|title=Doctor Who&nbsp;\u2014 FAQ&nbsp;\u2014 Plot and Continuity|publisher=BBC|date=28 March 2008|accessdate=30 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126134638/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|archive-date=26 January 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> instead focusing on his Gallifreyan heritage.\n\nThe programme's first serial, ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'', shows that the Doctor has a granddaughter, [[Susan Foreman]]. In the 1967 serial, ''[[Tomb of the Cybermen]]'', when [[Victoria Waterfield]] doubts the Doctor can remember his family because of, \"being so ancient\", the Doctor says that he can when he really wants to\u2014\"The rest of the time they sleep in my mind\". The 2005 series reveals that the Ninth Doctor thought he was the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed; in \"[[The Empty Child]]\" (2005), Dr. Constantine states that, \"Before the war even began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I am neither.\" The Doctor remarks in response, \"Yeah, I know the feeling.\" In \"[[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]]\" (2007), when asked if he had a brother, he replied, \"No, not any more.\" In both \"[[Fear Her]]\" (2006) and \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\" (2008), he states that he had, in the past, been a father.\n\nIn \"[[The Wedding of River Song]]\" (2011), it is implied that the Doctor's true name is a secret that must never be revealed; this is explored further in \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), when River Song speaking his name allows the [[Great Intelligence]] to enter his tomb, and in \"The Time of the Doctor\" (2013) where speaking his true name becomes the signal by which the Time Lords would know they can safely return to the universe.\n\n===Companions===\n{{Main|Companion (Doctor Who)}}\nThe companion figure&nbsp;\u2013 generally a human&nbsp;\u2013 has been a constant feature in ''Doctor Who'' since the programme's inception in 1963.

These characters were intended to act as [[audience surrogates]], through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure.<ref name=Overview/> The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] ([[Mary Tamm]] and [[Lalla Ward]]), a [[Time Lord|Time Lady]]; [[Sarah Jane Smith]] ([[Elisabeth Sladen]]); and [[Jo Grant]] ([[Katy Manning]]). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes&nbsp;\u2014 or loves&nbsp;\u2014 on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.\n\nSince the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role. Steven Moffat described the companion as the main character of the show, as the story begins anew with each companion and she undergoes more change than the Doctor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-19/steven-moffat-the-companion-is-the-main-character-in-doctor-who-not-the-doctor|title=Steven Moffat: the companion is the main character in Doctor Who, not the Doctor|work=Radio Times|publisher=[[BBC Magazines]]|last=Jones|first=Paul|date=19 April 2012|accessdate=28 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203120410/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-19/steven-moffat-the-companion-is-the-main-character-in-doctor-who-not-the-doctor|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/03/doctor-who-returns-steven-moffat-talks-new-companion-clara-and-jenna-louise-coleman.html|title='Doctor Who' returns: Steven Moffat talks new companion Clara and Jenna-Louise Coleman|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|last=Berkshire|first=Geoff|date=27 March 2013|accessdate=28 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002317/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/03/doctor-who-returns-steven-moffat-talks-new-companion-clara-and-jenna-louise-coleman.html|archivedate=3 December 2013}}</ref> The primary companions of the [[Companion (Doctor Who)#Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Companion (Doctor Who)#Tenth Doctor|Tenth]] Doctors were [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]), [[Martha Jones]] ([[Freema Agyeman]]), and [[Donna Noble]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) with [[Mickey Smith]] ([[Noel Clarke]]) and [[Jack Harkness]] ([[John Barrowman]]) recurring as secondary companion figures.<ref name=AbsentPostcolonial>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Commonwealth Literature|doi=10.1177/0021989410366891|url=http://jcl.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/45/2/207|title=\"Sociopathetic Abscess\" or \"Yawning Chasm\"?

The actual creatures resemble octopuses with large, pronounced brains. Their armour shells have a single eye-stalk, a sink-plunger-like device that serves the purpose of a hand, and a [[directed-energy weapon]]. Their main weakness is their eyestalk;  attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad. Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to \"exterminate\" all non-Dalek beings. They even attack the [[Time Lord]]s in the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], as shown during the 50th Anniversary of the show. They continue to be a recurring 'monster' within the Doctor Who franchise, their most recent appearance being the 2019 episodes \"[[Resolution (Doctor Who)|Resolution]]\".

The original theme was composed by [[Ron Grainer]] and realised by [[Delia Derbyshire]] of the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], with assistance from [[Dick Mills]] and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964.   The various parts were built up using [[musique concr\u00e8te]] techniques, by creating [[tape loop]]s of an individually struck piano string and individual test [[oscillation|oscillators]] and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of [[Doctor Who (season 17)|season 17]] (1979\u201380). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of [[Magnetic tape sound recording|analogue tape]] containing recordings of a single plucked string, [[white noise]], and the simple [[harmonic]] waveforms of [[Tone generator|test-tone oscillators]], intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines.

Since its 2005 return, the series has featured occasional use of excerpts of pop music from the 1970s to the 2000s.\n\nThe incidental music for the first ''Doctor Who'' adventure, ''An Unearthly Child'', was written by [[Norman Kay (composer)|Norman Kay]]. Many of the stories of the [[William Hartnell]] period were scored by electronic music pioneer [[Tristram Cary]], whose ''Doctor Who'' credits include ''The Daleks'', ''[[Marco Polo (Doctor Who)|Marco Polo]]'', ''The Daleks' Master Plan'', ''The Gunfighters'' and ''[[The Mutants]]''. Other composers in this early period included [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Carey Blyton]] and [[Geoffrey Burgon]].\n\nThe most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was [[Dudley Simpson]], who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for ''[[Blake's 7]]'', and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of ''[[The Tomorrow People]]''. Simpson's first ''Doctor Who'' score was ''[[Planet of Giants]]'' (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]'' (1979). He also made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' (as a [[Music hall]] conductor).\n\nIn 1980 starting with the serial ''[[The Leisure Hive]]'' the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop. [[Paddy Kingsland]] and [[Peter Howell (musician)|Peter Howell]] contributed many scores in this period and other contributors included [[Roger Limb]], [[Malcolm Clarke (composer)|Malcolm Clarke]] and [[Jonathan Gibbs (composer)|Jonathan Gibbs]].\n\nThe Radiophonic Workshop was dropped after 1986's ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' series, and [[Keff McCulloch]] took over as the series' main composer until the end of its run, with [[Dominic Glynn]] and [[Mark Ayres]] also contributing scores.\n\nFrom the 2005 revival to the 2017 Christmas episode \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/921558/Doctor-Who-BBC-Series-11-Jodie-Whittaker-Bradley-Walsh-Exit-Composer-Writer-Murray-Gold-Dr|title=Doctor Who: Bradley Walsh WON'T work with two big stars after they confirm their exits|first=Rory|last=O'Connor|publisher=Express|date=20 February 2018|accessdate=20 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612232906/https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/921558/Doctor-Who-BBC-Series-11-Jodie-Whittaker-Bradley-Walsh-Exit-Composer-Writer-Murray-Gold-Dr|archive-date=12 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> all incidental music for the series was composed by [[Murray Gold]] and [[Ben Foster (orchestrator)|Ben Foster]], and has been performed by the [[BBC National Orchestra of Wales]] from the 2005 Christmas episode \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\" onwards.

There have been three aftershow series created, with the latest one titled ''[[Doctor Who: The Fan Show]]'', which began airing from the tenth series. Each series follows behind-the-scenes footage on the making of ''Doctor Who'' through clips and interviews with the cast, production crew and other people, including those who have participated in the television series in some manner.

It also featured a crossover with the soap opera ''[[EastEnders]]'', the action taking place in the latter's [[Albert Square]] location and around [[Greenwich]]. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the [[Pulfrich effect]] requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses.\n\nIn 1999, another special, ''[[Doctor Who: The Curse of Fatal Death|Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death]]'', was made for [[Comic Relief]] and later released on VHS. An affectionate [[parody]] of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with [[cliffhanger]]s, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased (the version released on video was split into only two episodes). In the story, the Doctor ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) encounters both [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) and the [[Dalek]]s. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, [[Richard E. Grant]], [[Jim Broadbent]], [[Hugh Grant]] and [[Joanna Lumley]]. The script was written by [[Steven Moffat]], later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series.<ref name=RTDgone>{{cite news|title=Doctor Who guru Davies steps down|work=BBC News|date=20 May 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7411177.stm|accessdate=20 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215163911/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7411177.stm|archive-date=15 February 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSince the return of ''Doctor Who'' in 2005, the franchise has produced two original \"mini-episodes\" to support Children in Need.

Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on [[LP record]]; ''[[Doctor Who and the Pescatons]]'' featuring the Fourth Doctor.  The first commercially available audiobook was an abridged reading of the Fourth Doctor story ''[[State of Decay]]'' in 1981. In 1988, during a hiatus in the television show, ''[[Slipback]]'', the first radio drama, was transmitted.\n\nSince 1999, [[Big Finish Productions]] has released several different series of Doctor Who audios on CD.  The earliest of these featured the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors, with Paul McGann's Eight Doctor joining the line in 2001.  Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor began appearing for Big Finish in 2012.  Along with the main range, adventures of the First, Second and Third Doctors have been produced in both limited cast and full cast formats, as well as audiobooks.  The 2013 series ''[[Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctor|Destiny of the Doctor]]'', produced as part of the series' 50th Anniversary celebrations, marked the first time Big Finish created stories (in this case audiobooks) featuring the Doctors from the revived show. Along with this, in May 2016 the Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, appeared alongside Catherine Tate in a collection of three audio adventures.\n\nIn addition to these main lines, both the BBC and Big Finish have produced original audio dramas and audiobooks based on spin-off material, such as ''Torchwood'' and ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' series.\n\n===Books===\n{{See also|List of Doctor Who novelists}}\n\n''Doctor Who'' books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day.

Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels have been published by [[BBC Books]]. Numerous non-fiction books about the series, including guidebooks and critical studies, have also been published, and a dedicated ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' with newsstand circulation has been published regularly since 1979.

There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a [[backdoor pilot]], in the form of a television film titled ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''. The programme was [[History of Doctor Who#2000s|relaunched in 2005]], and since then has been produced in-house by [[BBC Cymru Wales|BBC Wales]] in [[Cardiff]]. ''Doctor Who'' has also spawned numerous [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-offs]], including comic books, films, novels, audio dramas, and the television series ''[[Torchwood]]'' (2006\u20132011), ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' (2007\u20132011), ''[[K-9 (TV series)|K-9]]'' (2009\u20132010), and ''[[Class (2016 TV series)|Class]]'' (2016), and has been the subject of many parodies and references in popular culture.\n\nThirteen actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show with the [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|concept of regeneration]] into a new [[incarnation]], a [[plot device]] in which a Time Lord \"transforms\" into a new body when the current one is too badly harmed to heal normally. Each actor's portrayal is unique, but all represent stages in the life of the same character, and together, they form a single lifetime with a single narrative. The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The Doctor is currently portrayed by [[Jodie Whittaker]], who took on the role after [[Peter Capaldi]]'s exit in the 2017 Christmas special \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\".\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\n''Doctor Who'' follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue [[Time Lord]] from the planet [[Gallifrey]] who goes by the name \"[[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]\". The Doctor fled Gallifrey in a stolen [[TARDIS]] (\"Time and Relative Dimension in Space\"), a [[time travel|time machine]] that travels by materialising into and dematerialising out of the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a \"chameleon circuit\" intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise; due to a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British [[police box]].\n\nAcross time and space, the Doctor's many incarnations often find events that pique their curiosity and try to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only ingenuity and minimal resources, such as the versatile [[sonic screwdriver]]. The Doctor rarely travels alone and often brings one or more [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companions]] to share these adventures. These companions are usually humans, owing to the Doctor's fascination with planet Earth, which also leads to frequent collaborations with the international military task force [[UNIT]] when the Earth is threatened. The Doctor is centuries old and, as a Time Lord, has the ability to [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]] in case of mortal damage to the body, taking on a new appearance and personality. The Doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during their travels, including the [[Dalek]]s, the [[Cybermen]], and [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]], another renegade Time Lord.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Doctor Who}}\n''Doctor Who'' first appeared on [[BBC One|BBC TV]] at 17:16:20 [[Greenwich Mean Time|GMT]] on Saturday, 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled programme time, due to the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] the previous day.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), p. 54</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/unearthlychild/detail.shtml|title=An Unearthly Child|publisher=BBC|date=16 August 2012|access-date=20 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626184328/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/unearthlychild/detail.shtml|archive-date=26 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length. Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The [[BBC television drama|head of drama]] [[Sydney Newman]] was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) [[Donald Wilson (writer and producer)|Donald Wilson]] and staff writer [[C. E. Webber]]. Writer [[Anthony Coburn]], [[Script editor|story editor]] [[David Whitaker (screenwriter)|David Whitaker]] and initial producer [[Verity Lambert]] also heavily contributed to the development of the series.<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1994), pp. 157\u2013230 (\"Production Diary\")</ref><ref group=note>Newman is often given sole creator credit for the series. Some reference works such as ''The Complete Encyclopedia of Television Programs 1947\u20131979'' by Vincent Terrace erroneously credit Terry Nation with creating ''Doctor Who'', because of the way his name is credited in the two Peter Cushing films.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}<br />Newman and Lambert's role in originating the series was recognised in the 2007 episode \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]\", in which the Doctor, in disguise as a human named John Smith, gives his parents' names as Sydney and Verity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience<ref>Howe, Stammers, Walker (1992), p. 3.</ref> as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963, Whitaker commissioned [[Terry Nation]] to write a story under the title ''The Mutants''. As originally written, the [[Dalek]]s and [[Thal (Doctor Who)|Thals]] were the victims of an alien [[neutron bomb]] attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"[[bug-eyed monster]]s\". According to producer Verity Lambert; \"We didn't have a lot of choice&nbsp;\u2014 we only had the Dalek serial to go&nbsp;... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.\" Nation's script became the second ''Doctor Who'' serial&nbsp;\u2013 ''[[The Daleks]]'' (also known as ''The Mutants''). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.<ref>Steve Tribe, James Goss ''Dr Who: The Dalek Handbook'' [[BBC Books]] [[Random House]] 2011 {{ISBN|978-1-84990-232-8}} Pg9</ref>\n\nThe BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on [[BBC One|BBC 1]].

[[Philip Segal]], a British [[expatriate]] who worked for [[Columbia Pictures]]' television arm in the United States, had approached the BBC about such a venture as early as July 1989, while the 26th season was still in production.<ref name=\"8thdrspecial\">Doctor Who Magazine Eighth Doctor Special, Panini Comics 2003</ref> Segal's negotiations eventually led to a [[Doctor Who (film)|''Doctor Who'' television film]], broadcast on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] in 1996 as an [[international co-production]] between Fox, [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], the BBC and [[BBC Worldwide]].

The 1993 2-part story, entitled ''[[Dimensions in Time]]'', was made in collaboration with the cast of the BBC soap-opera ''[[EastEnders]]'' and was filmed partly on the ''EastEnders'' set.

In ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', [[Richard Hurndall]] played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell's death in 1975; 34 years later [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]] similarly replaced Hartnell in ''[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]''. In ''[[Time and the Rani]]'', Sylvester McCoy briefly played the Sixth Doctor during the regeneration sequence, carrying on as the Seventh. For more information, see the [[list of actors who have played the Doctor]]. In other media, the Doctor has been played by various other actors, including [[Peter Cushing]] in [[Dr. Who (Dalek films)|two films]].\n\nThe casting of a new Doctor has often inspired debate and speculation. Common topics of focus include the Doctor's gender (prior to the casting of Whittaker, all official incarnations were male), race (all Doctors were white prior to the casting of [[Jo Martin]] in \"[[Fugitive of the Judoon]]\") and age (the youngest actor to be cast is Smith at 26, and the oldest are Capaldi and Hartnell, both 55).<ref>Ted B.

In 1973's ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'', William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted ''[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]'' serial. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's ''[[The Two Doctors]]'' with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"[[Time Crash]]\" alongside David Tennant. In \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), the Eleventh Doctor meets a previously unseen incarnation of himself, subsequently revealed to be the [[War Doctor]].<ref name=\"HurtDoctor\" /> In the following episode, \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\", David Tennant's [[Tenth Doctor]] appeared alongside [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and [[John Hurt]] as the [[War Doctor]], as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Day of the Doctor|series=Doctor Who|network=BBC|station=BBC One|location=Cardiff|date=23 November 2013|minutes=60}}</ref> Additionally, multiple incarnations of the Doctor have met in various [[Doctor Who#Audios|audio dramas]] and [[Doctor Who#Books|novels]] based on the television show. In 2017, the First Doctor (this time portrayed by [[David Bradley (English actor)|David Bradley]]) returned alongside Peter Capaldi in \"[[The Doctor Falls]]\" and \"[[Twice Upon a Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\". In 2020\u2019s \u201cFugitive of the Judoon\u201d, Jodie Whittaker as the Thirteenth Doctor meets Jo Martin\u2019s incarnation of the Doctor, subsequently known as the Fugitive Doctor. They met later, albeit briefly, in \u201cThe Timeless Children\u201d later that year.\n\n====Revelations about the Doctor====\n{{See also|The Doctor (Doctor Who)#Inconsistencies|l1=The Doctor: Inconsistencies}}\n\nThroughout the programme's long history, there have been revelations about the Doctor that have raised additional questions. In ''[[The Brain of Morbius]]'' (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor might not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted might have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In ''[[Mawdryn Undead]]'' (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms \"Fourth\", the First Doctor excitedly replies \"Goodness me. So there are five of me now.\" In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself \"the Eleventh\" in \"[[The Lodger (Doctor Who)|The Lodger]]\". In the 2013 episode \"The Time of the Doctor,\" the Eleventh Doctor clarified he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration. The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied \"Fall of the Eleventh\" which had been trailed throughout the series.\n\nDuring the Seventh Doctor's era, it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord. In the [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|1996 television film]], the Eighth Doctor describes himself as being \"half human\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml|title=Doctor Who: the TV movie|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227174852/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/tvmovie/detail.shtml|archive-date=27 February 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> The BBC's FAQ for the programme notes that \"purists tend to disregard this\",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|title=Doctor Who&nbsp;\u2014 FAQ&nbsp;\u2014 Plot and Continuity|publisher=BBC|date=28 March 2008|accessdate=30 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126134638/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/faq/plot_continuity.shtml|archive-date=26 January 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> instead focusing on his Gallifreyan heritage.\n\nThe programme's first serial, ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'', shows that the Doctor has a granddaughter, [[Susan Foreman]]. In the 1967 serial, ''[[Tomb of the Cybermen]]'', when [[Victoria Waterfield]] doubts the Doctor can remember his family because of, \"being so ancient\", the Doctor says that he can when he really wants to\u2014\"The rest of the time they sleep in my mind\". The 2005 series reveals that the Ninth Doctor thought he was the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed; in \"[[The Empty Child]]\" (2005), Dr. Constantine states that, \"Before the war even began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I am neither.\" The Doctor remarks in response, \"Yeah, I know the feeling.\" In \"[[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]]\" (2007), when asked if he had a brother, he replied, \"No, not any more.\" In both \"[[Fear Her]]\" (2006) and \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\" (2008), he states that he had, in the past, been a father.\n\nIn \"[[The Wedding of River Song]]\" (2011), it is implied that the Doctor's true name is a secret that must never be revealed; this is explored further in \"[[The Name of the Doctor]]\" (2013), when River Song speaking his name allows the [[Great Intelligence]] to enter his tomb, and in \"The Time of the Doctor\" (2013) where speaking his true name becomes the signal by which the Time Lords would know they can safely return to the universe.\n\n===Companions===\n{{Main|Companion (Doctor Who)}}\nThe companion figure&nbsp;\u2013 generally a human&nbsp;\u2013 has been a constant feature in ''Doctor Who'' since the programme's inception in 1963.

These characters were intended to act as [[audience surrogates]], through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure.<ref name=Overview/> The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] ([[Mary Tamm]] and [[Lalla Ward]]), a [[Time Lord|Time Lady]]; [[Sarah Jane Smith]] ([[Elisabeth Sladen]]); and [[Jo Grant]] ([[Katy Manning]]). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes&nbsp;\u2014 or loves&nbsp;\u2014 on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.\n\nSince the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role. Steven Moffat described the companion as the main character of the show, as the story begins anew with each companion and she undergoes more change than the Doctor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-19/steven-moffat-the-companion-is-the-main-character-in-doctor-who-not-the-doctor|title=Steven Moffat: the companion is the main character in Doctor Who, not the Doctor|work=Radio Times|publisher=[[BBC Magazines]]|last=Jones|first=Paul|date=19 April 2012|accessdate=28 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203120410/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-04-19/steven-moffat-the-companion-is-the-main-character-in-doctor-who-not-the-doctor|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/03/doctor-who-returns-steven-moffat-talks-new-companion-clara-and-jenna-louise-coleman.html|title='Doctor Who' returns: Steven Moffat talks new companion Clara and Jenna-Louise Coleman|publisher=[[Zap2it]]|last=Berkshire|first=Geoff|date=27 March 2013|accessdate=28 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002317/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/03/doctor-who-returns-steven-moffat-talks-new-companion-clara-and-jenna-louise-coleman.html|archivedate=3 December 2013}}</ref> The primary companions of the [[Companion (Doctor Who)#Ninth Doctor|Ninth]] and [[Companion (Doctor Who)#Tenth Doctor|Tenth]] Doctors were [[Rose Tyler]] ([[Billie Piper]]), [[Martha Jones]] ([[Freema Agyeman]]), and [[Donna Noble]] ([[Catherine Tate]]) with [[Mickey Smith]] ([[Noel Clarke]]) and [[Jack Harkness]] ([[John Barrowman]]) recurring as secondary companion figures.<ref name=AbsentPostcolonial>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Commonwealth Literature|doi=10.1177/0021989410366891|url=http://jcl.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/45/2/207|title=\"Sociopathetic Abscess\" or \"Yawning Chasm\"?

Their main weakness is their eyestalk;  attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad.

The original theme was composed by [[Ron Grainer]] and realised by [[Delia Derbyshire]] of the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]], with assistance from [[Dick Mills]] and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964.   The various parts were built up using [[musique concr\u00e8te]] techniques, by creating [[tape loop]]s of an individually struck piano string and individual test [[oscillation|oscillators]] and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of [[Doctor Who (season 17)|season 17]] (1979\u201380). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of [[Magnetic tape sound recording|analogue tape]] containing recordings of a single plucked string, [[white noise]], and the simple [[harmonic]] waveforms of [[Tone generator|test-tone oscillators]], intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines. On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, \"Jeez, Delia, did I write that?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/36b860f1-b3d5-4fcc-acdc-c2e95fb99176|title=Surprising Facts about BBC Theme Tunes You've Heard Hundreds of Times|first=Phil|last=Hebblethwaite|date=29 June 2016|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=12 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725043928/https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/articles/36b860f1-b3d5-4fcc-acdc-c2e95fb99176|archive-date=25 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Although Grainer was willing to give Derbyshire the co-composer credit, it was against BBC policy at the time.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pidd|first1=Helen|title=Doctor Who theme's co-creator honoured with posthumous PhD|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/20/delia-derbyshire-doctor-who-theme-co-creator-posthumous-phd|website=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=31 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228115219/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/20/delia-derbyshire-doctor-who-theme-co-creator-posthumous-phd|archive-date=28 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Ben|title=Doctor Who theme co-composer honoured with posthumous PhD|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2017-11-21/doctor-who-theme-co-composer-honoured-delia-derbyshire-honorary-phd/|website=Radio Times|publisher=Immediate Media Company Ltd|accessdate=31 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101030501/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2017-11-21/doctor-who-theme-co-composer-honoured-delia-derbyshire-honorary-phd/|archive-date=1 January 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA different arrangement was recorded by [[Peter Howell (musician)|Peter Howell]] for [[Doctor Who (season 18)|season 18]] (1980), which was in turn replaced by [[Dominic Glynn]]'s arrangement for the season-long serial ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'' in [[Doctor Who (season 23)|season 23]] (1986).

Other composers in this early period included [[Richard Rodney Bennett]], [[Carey Blyton]] and [[Geoffrey Burgon]].\n\nThe most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was [[Dudley Simpson]], who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for ''[[Blake's 7]]'', and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of ''[[The Tomorrow People]]''. Simpson's first ''Doctor Who'' score was ''[[Planet of Giants]]'' (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]'' (1979). He also made a [[cameo appearance]] in ''The Talons of Weng-Chiang'' (as a [[Music hall]] conductor).\n\nIn 1980 starting with the serial ''[[The Leisure Hive]]'' the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop.

An affectionate [[parody]] of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with [[cliffhanger]]s, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased (the version released on video was split into only two episodes). In the story, the Doctor ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) encounters both [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) and the [[Dalek]]s.

Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on [[LP record]]; ''[[Doctor Who and the Pescatons]]'' featuring the Fourth Doctor.  The first commercially available audiobook was an abridged reading of the Fourth Doctor story ''[[State of Decay]]'' in 1981.

The earliest of these featured the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors, with Paul McGann's Eight Doctor joining the line in 2001.  Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor began appearing for Big Finish in 2012.  Along with the main range, adventures of the First, Second and Third Doctors have been produced in both limited cast and full cast formats, as well as audiobooks.  The 2013 series ''[[Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctor|Destiny of the Doctor]]'', produced as part of the series' 50th Anniversary celebrations, marked the first time Big Finish created stories (in this case audiobooks) featuring the Doctors from the revived show. Along with this, in May 2016 the Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, appeared alongside Catherine Tate in a collection of three audio adventures.\n\nIn addition to these main lines, both the BBC and Big Finish have produced original audio dramas and audiobooks based on spin-off material, such as ''Torchwood'' and ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' series.\n\n===Books===\n{{See also|List of Doctor Who novelists}}\n\n''Doctor Who'' books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day.

Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels have been published by [[BBC Books]].

In a manner analogous to the finale of [[Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 4 (Mahler)|Fourth Symphony]], the setting is a childlike [[medieval]] [[Latin]] [[lullaby]].<ref>MacDonald, Calum (2010) Liner notes to ''Luigi Dallapiccola Orchestral Works 2'', Chandos Records.</ref>\n\nThe work was premiered at the [[Teatro Comunale di Firenze]] on the 22nd of January 1933 by the theatre orchestra under [[Vittorio Gui]], with [[Laura Pasini]] as soloist. It had to wait over seventy years for its recorded premiere, however, given by the [[BBC Philharmonic]] under [[Gianandrea Noseda]] in 2010, with [[Gillian Keith]] as soloist. The recording was released on [[Chandos Records]].\n\n==Movements==\n#Passacaglia. Molto solenne -\n#Burlesca.

The franchise encompasses a series of [[science fiction action film]]s, comics, novels, and additional media, concerning battles between [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]]'s [[synthetic intelligence|synthetic intelligent]] machine network and [[John Connor]]'s Resistance forces with the rest of the [[human|human race]]. Skynet's most famous products in its genocidal goals are [[Terminator (character concept)|the various terminator models]], such as the [[Terminator (character)|T-800]], who was portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] from the [[The Terminator|original ''Terminator'' film]] in 1984. By 2010, the franchise had generated $3 billion in revenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100217005514/en/Pacificor-Names-Latham-Watkins-Field-Terminator-Inquiries|title=Pacificor Names Latham & Watkins to Field Terminator Inquiries|website=[[Business Wire]]|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]|date=February 17, 2010|accessdate=March 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\n[[File:Terminator(Future War).png|thumb|left|250px|Concept art illustrating the conflicts between Skynet and the Resistance in a post-apocalyptic, futuristic setting, envisioned by creator James Cameron for the 1984 film ''[[The Terminator]]'']]\nThe central theme of the franchise is the battle for survival between the nearly-extinct human race and the world-spanning [[synthetic intelligence]] that is [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]]. Skynet is positioned in the [[The Terminator|first film]] as a U.S. strategic \"Global Digital Defense Network\" computer system by [[Cyberdyne Systems]] which becomes self-aware. Shortly after activation, Skynet perceives all humans as a threat to its existence and formulates a plan to systematically wipe out humanity itself. The system initiates a nuclear [[first strike]] against Russia, thereby ensuring a devastating [[second strike]] and a [[nuclear holocaust]] which wipes out much of humanity in the resulting [[nuclear war]]. In the post-apocalyptic aftermath, Skynet later builds up its own autonomous machine-based military capability which includes the [[Terminator (character concept)|Terminators]] used against individual human targets and therefore proceeds to wage a persistent [[total war]] against the surviving elements of humanity, some of whom have militarily organized themselves into a Resistance. At some point in this future, Skynet develops the ability of [[time travel]], and both it and the Resistance seek to use this technology in order to win the war; either by altering or accelerating past events, or by preventing the apocalyptic timeline.\n\n===Judgment Day===\n<!-- Please do not change this section title, it has an incoming link from Judgment Day (disambiguation). -->\n[[File:Terminator Franchise Continuity.jpg|thumb|An infographic illustrating the continuity between the various timelines in the ''Terminator'' franchise.]] \nIn the franchise, Judgment Day (a reference to the biblical [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgment]]) is referred to as the date on which Skynet becomes self-aware, decides to exterminate humanity, and launches a nuclear attack on Russia to provoke a nuclear counter-strike against the United States. Due to time travel and the consequent ability to change the future, several differing dates are given for Judgment Day. In ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]] states that Judgment Day will occur on August 29, 1997. However, this date is delayed following the attack on Cyberdyne Systems in the second film.\n\nJudgment Day has various different dates in the retroactively erased timelines of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth films, as well as the television series, creating a set of multiverse. In ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' (2003) and ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' (2009), Judgment Day was postponed to July 2003.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hagberg |first=David |title=Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines |date=2003 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=9780765347411 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DU-hnoszGTMC |accessdate=September 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite video game |title=[[Terminator 3: The Redemption]] |developer=Paradigm Entertainment |publisher=Atari |date=2004 |level=  }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Cox |first=Greg |title=Terminator Salvation: Cold War |date=2010 |publisher=Titan Books |isbn=9781848569348 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGY4CgAAQBAJ&pg=PT229#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=September 6, 2019}}</ref> In ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]'' (2008\u20132009), the attack on Cyberdyne Systems in the second film delayed Judgment Day to April 21, 2011.

Sarah and [[Kyle Reese]] travel through time to the year 2017 and seemingly defeat Skynet but the system core, contained inside a subterranean blast shelter, survives unknown to them, thus further delaying, rather than preventing, Judgment Day.

It is the first work in the ''Terminator'' franchise. In the film, machines take over the world in the near future, directed by the artificial intelligence Skynet. With its sole mission to completely annihilate humanity, it develops [[android (robot)|android]] assassins called Terminators that outwardly appear human. A man named [[John Connor]] starts the Tech-Com resistance to fight the machines, defeat Skynet and free humanity. With a human victory imminent, the machines' only choice is to send a Terminator back in time to kill John's mother, [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]], and prevent the boy's birth, thereby handicapping the resistance from ever being founded in the first place.

After machines fail to prevent John Connor from being born, they try again in 1995, this time attemptinhdhehhdg to terminate him as a child by using a more advanced Terminator, the [[T-1000]]. As before, John sends back a protector for his younger self, a reprogrammed Terminator, who is a doppelg\u00e4nger to [[Terminator (character)|the one from the previous film]]. After years of preparing for the future war, Sarah decides to use the same tactics the machines used on her: preventing Skynet from being invented by destroying Cyberdyne Systems before they create it. It was released on July 3, 1991, to critical acclaim and grossed $523.7 million worldwide. It also won several [[Academy Awards]], one most notably for its then-cutting-edge computer animation.

In an attempt to ensure a victory by the machines, a new Terminator, the [[T-X]], is sent back to terminate the lives of as many of John Connor's future lieutenants as is possible, including his future wife Kate Brewster, and also John himself. Kate's father, General Robert Brewster ([[David Andrews (actor)|David Andrews]]), who is supervising Skynet's development, is also targeted for termination by the T-X.

Prior to this alteration, on the verge of winning the war against Skynet, John Connor ([[Jason Clarke (actor)|Jason Clarke]]) sends his trusted right-hand officer Kyle Reese ([[Jai Courtney]]) back through time to save his mother's life and ensure his own existence. However, Kyle arrives at an alternate timeline where Skynet had never launched its initial attack in 1997, and, therefore, Sarah Connor ([[Emilia Clarke]]) was brought up by a reprogrammed Terminator (Schwarzenegger), sent by an unknown party to be her guardian ever since childhood. Now Sarah, Kyle and the Guardian need to escape the T-800 Model 101 (Brett Azar with CG-rendered likeness of Schwarzenegger from the first film), the T-1000 ([[Lee Byung-hun]]) and Skynet's [[T-3000]], in an attempt to stop Judgment Day from ever happening; while trying to uncover the secrets behind Cyberdyne Systems' new [[application software]]: ''Genisys''.

The franchise encompasses a series of [[science fiction action film]]s, comics, novels, and additional media, concerning battles between [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]]'s [[synthetic intelligence|synthetic intelligent]] machine network and [[John Connor]]'s Resistance forces with the rest of the [[human|human race]]. Skynet's most famous products in its genocidal goals are [[Terminator (character concept)|the various terminator models]], such as the [[Terminator (character)|T-800]], who was portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] from the [[The Terminator|original ''Terminator'' film]] in 1984. By 2010, the franchise had generated $3 billion in revenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100217005514/en/Pacificor-Names-Latham-Watkins-Field-Terminator-Inquiries|title=Pacificor Names Latham & Watkins to Field Terminator Inquiries|website=[[Business Wire]]|publisher=[[Berkshire Hathaway]]|date=February 17, 2010|accessdate=March 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Setting==\n[[File:Terminator(Future War).png|thumb|left|250px|Concept art illustrating the conflicts between Skynet and the Resistance in a post-apocalyptic, futuristic setting, envisioned by creator James Cameron for the 1984 film ''[[The Terminator]]'']]\nThe central theme of the franchise is the battle for survival between the nearly-extinct human race and the world-spanning [[synthetic intelligence]] that is [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]]. Skynet is positioned in the [[The Terminator|first film]] as a U.S. strategic \"Global Digital Defense Network\" computer system by [[Cyberdyne Systems]] which becomes self-aware. Shortly after activation, Skynet perceives all humans as a threat to its existence and formulates a plan to systematically wipe out humanity itself. The system initiates a nuclear [[first strike]] against Russia, thereby ensuring a devastating [[second strike]] and a [[nuclear holocaust]] which wipes out much of humanity in the resulting [[nuclear war]]. In the post-apocalyptic aftermath, Skynet later builds up its own autonomous machine-based military capability which includes the [[Terminator (character concept)|Terminators]] used against individual human targets and therefore proceeds to wage a persistent [[total war]] against the surviving elements of humanity, some of whom have militarily organized themselves into a Resistance. At some point in this future, Skynet develops the ability of [[time travel]], and both it and the Resistance seek to use this technology in order to win the war; either by altering or accelerating past events, or by preventing the apocalyptic timeline.\n\n===Judgment Day===\n<!-- Please do not change this section title, it has an incoming link from Judgment Day (disambiguation). -->\n[[File:Terminator Franchise Continuity.jpg|thumb|An infographic illustrating the continuity between the various timelines in the ''Terminator'' franchise.]] \nIn the franchise, Judgment Day (a reference to the biblical [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgment]]) is referred to as the date on which Skynet becomes self-aware, decides to exterminate humanity, and launches a nuclear attack on Russia to provoke a nuclear counter-strike against the United States. Due to time travel and the consequent ability to change the future, several differing dates are given for Judgment Day. In ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]] states that Judgment Day will occur on August 29, 1997. However, this date is delayed following the attack on Cyberdyne Systems in the second film.\n\nJudgment Day has various different dates in the retroactively erased timelines of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth films, as well as the television series, creating a set of multiverse. In ''[[Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines]]'' (2003) and ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'' (2009), Judgment Day was postponed to July 2003.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hagberg |first=David |title=Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines |date=2003 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=9780765347411 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DU-hnoszGTMC |accessdate=September 6, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite video game |title=[[Terminator 3: The Redemption]] |developer=Paradigm Entertainment |publisher=Atari |date=2004 |level=  }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Cox |first=Greg |title=Terminator Salvation: Cold War |date=2010 |publisher=Titan Books |isbn=9781848569348 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGY4CgAAQBAJ&pg=PT229#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=September 6, 2019}}</ref> In ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]'' (2008\u20132009), the attack on Cyberdyne Systems in the second film delayed Judgment Day to April 21, 2011.

It is the first work in the ''Terminator'' franchise. In the film, machines take over the world in the near future, directed by the artificial intelligence Skynet. With its sole mission to completely annihilate humanity, it develops [[android (robot)|android]] assassins called Terminators that outwardly appear human. A man named [[John Connor]] starts the Tech-Com resistance to fight the machines, defeat Skynet and free humanity. With a human victory imminent, the machines' only choice is to send a Terminator back in time to kill John's mother, [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]], and prevent the boy's birth, thereby handicapping the resistance from ever being founded in the first place. With the fate of humanity at stake, John sends soldier [[Kyle Reese]] back to protect Sarah Connor, and thus ensure his own existence.

It was co-written, directed, and produced by James Cameron and stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, [[Edward Furlong]], [[Robert Patrick]], and [[Joe Morton]]. After machines fail to prevent John Connor from being born, they try again in 1995, this time attempting to terminate him as a child by using a more advanced Terminator, the [[T-1000]]. As before, John sends back a protector for his younger self, a reprogrammed Terminator, who is a doppelg\u00e4nger to [[Terminator (character)|the one from the previous film]]. After years of preparing for the future war, Sarah decides to use the same tactics the machines used on her: preventing Skynet from being invented by destroying Cyberdyne Systems before they create it. It was released on July 3, 1991, to critical acclaim and grossed $523.7 million worldwide. It also won several [[Academy Awards]], one most notably for its then-cutting-edge computer animation.

As a result of the destruction of Cyberdyne at the end of ''Terminator 2'', the Skynet takeover has been postponed, not averted. In an attempt to ensure a victory by the machines, a new Terminator, the [[T-X]], is sent back to terminate the lives of as many of John Connor's future lieutenants as is possible, including his future wife Kate Brewster, and also John himself. Kate's father, General Robert Brewster ([[David Andrews (actor)|David Andrews]]), who is supervising Skynet's development, is also targeted for termination by the T-X. After Connor's future self is terminated by a doppelg\u00e4nger of his previous protector, Kate reprograms it and sends it back to save them both from the T-X.

The story takes place in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] resulting from a chain of events related to Skynet's ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) actions throughout a previous timeline. Prior to this alteration, on the verge of winning the war against Skynet, John Connor ([[Jason Clarke (actor)|Jason Clarke]]) sends his trusted right-hand officer Kyle Reese ([[Jai Courtney]]) back through time to save his mother's life and ensure his own existence. However, Kyle arrives at an alternate timeline where Skynet had never launched its initial attack in 1997, and, therefore, Sarah Connor ([[Emilia Clarke]]) was brought up by a reprogrammed Terminator (Schwarzenegger), sent by an unknown party to be her guardian ever since childhood. Now Sarah, Kyle and the Guardian need to escape the T-800 Model 101 (Brett Azar with CG-rendered likeness of Schwarzenegger from the first film), the T-1000 ([[Lee Byung-hun]]) and Skynet's [[T-3000]], in an attempt to stop Judgment Day from ever happening; while trying to uncover the secrets behind Cyberdyne Systems' new [[application software]]: ''Genisys''.
