The film is both a [[stand-alone sequel]] to and [[remake]] of the [[Flatliners|1990 film of the same name]], and stars [[Ellen Page]], [[Diego Luna]], [[Nina Dobrev]], [[James Norton (actor)|James Norton]], and [[Kiersey Clemons]]. It follows five medical students who attempt to conduct experiments that produce [[near-death experience]]s.\n\n[[Sony Pictures]] released the film in the United States on September 29, 2017. It was negatively reviewed by critics, who generally remarked that it repeated the problems of the original in failing to do justice to its interesting premise, but it was a moderate box office success, grossing $45 million worldwide on a $19 million budget.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- 400 to 700 words only in this section. -->\nA medical student, Courtney, is obsessed with the idea of the afterlife. She invites fellow students Jamie and Sophia to join her in an experiment, in an unused hospital room: using defibrillation to stop her heart for sixty seconds while recording her brain. She assures them they would not be held responsible for any accidents. Sophia is against this, but Jamie does it anyway. After sixty seconds, they are unable to revive her. Fellow student Ray helps them resuscitate her. Marlo, a rival of Ray, arrives and learns of the experiment.\n\nCourtney begins to recall memories of past events such as her grandmother's recipe for bread. Courtney experiences increased intelligence and euphoria, being suddenly able to play the piano after 12 years and answer questions in class perfectly. Envious, Jamie flatlines, but has a disturbing [[near-death experience]] as he meets his ex-girlfriend. Marlo and Sophia follow suit and flatline, for an increasing number of minutes. During Sophia\u2019s turn they are nearly caught and flee the hospital and arrive at a party. Courtney and Jamie start seeing visions of past mistakes, but do not tell the others.\n\nThose who flatlined experience visions: Courtney is haunted by her sister Tessa, who died in a car crash she caused because she was using her phone. Jamie is haunted by the baby of his ex-girlfriend who he got pregnant and begged to get an abortion. Marlo is haunted by a man named Cyrus who died when she accidentally mixed up his medication, and Sophia is haunted by a girl named Irina whose life she ruined out of jealousy by hacking her phone and sending out her nudes. This allowed Sophia to become [[valedictorian]].\n\nCourtney, traumatised by her visions, records a message apologising for the consequences and admitting that her interest in flatlining was due to the death of her sister, not for scientific discovery. She falls to her death from the fire escape of her apartment building after her sister's ghost pushes her off. The others are devastated when they learn of Courtney\u2019s death, and realize they may be implicated if anyone discovers their experiments. After attempting to remove all notes and evidence from Courtney\u2019s apartment, Marlo is sent to the morgue to find Courtney\u2019s phone. She is once again haunted by visions. On his boat, Jamie again hears the cries of a baby and a woman weeping. He falls out of his boat and swims to the dock where a figure stabs him in his hand.\n\nThe group watches Courtney's recording and find out that she had encountered similar hauntings. They come clean to the mistakes they made and come to the conclusion that the hauntings they're experiencing are hallucinations because of guilt from their sins, not paranormal beings. The only one who didn't flatline, Ray, initially disbelieves what's happening.\n\nThe group takes action to stop the hallucinations by fixing their past mistakes. Sophia visits Irina to apologize, which Irina accepts. Jamie visits his ex-girlfriend and discovers she didn't get an abortion, but kept the baby; he apologizes and promises to provide for his son. Ray and Marlo get into a fight when Ray finds out Marlo covered up the real reason Cyrus died and she refuses to come clean. Marlo hallucinates being suffocated while driving and crashes her car. Tired of being haunted by her hallucinations, Marlo flatlines on her own in the hope of asking forgiveness of Cyrus. Ray, Sophia and Jamie rush to stop her. They resuscitate Marlo after she sees an apparition of Courtney, who tells Marlo that she needs to forgive herself. Marlo, Ray, Sophia and Jamie reminisce about Courtney and celebrate their friendships in the little restaurant they hang out at, where there is a performance of the piano piece that Courtney played. Jamie proposes a toast, honoring Courtney.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ellen Page]] as Courtney Holmes<ref name=\"dobrev instagram\">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BI_EoPXgSai/|title=Instagram post

After attempting to remove all notes and evidence from Courtney\u2019s apartment, Marlo is sent to the morgue to find Courtney\u2019s phone. She is once again haunted by visions. On his boat, Jamie again hears the cries of a baby and a woman weeping. He falls out of his boat and swims to the dock where a figure stabs him in his hand.\n\nThe group watches Courtney's recording and find out that she had encountered similar hauntings. They come clean to the mistakes they made and come to the conclusion that the hauntings they're experiencing are hallucinations because of guilt from their sins, not paranormal beings. The only one who didn't flatline, Ray, initially disbelieves what's happening.\n\nThe group takes action to stop the hallucinations by fixing their past mistakes. Sophia visits Irina to apologize, which Irina accepts. Jamie visits his ex-girlfriend and discovers she didn't get an abortion, but kept the baby; he apologizes and promises to provide for his son. Ray and Marlo get into a fight when Ray finds out Marlo covered up the real reason Cyrus died and she refuses to come clean. Marlo hallucinates being suffocated while driving and crashes her car. Tired of being haunted by her hallucinations, Marlo flatlines on her own in the hope of asking forgiveness of Cyrus. Ray, Sophia and Jamie rush to stop her. They resuscitate Marlo after she sees an apparition of Courtney, who tells Marlo that she needs to forgive herself. Marlo, Ray, Sophia and Jamie reminisce about Courtney and celebrate their friendships in the little restaurant they hang out at, where there is a performance of the piano piece that Courtney played. Jamie proposes a toast, honoring Courtney.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ellen Page]] as Courtney Holmes<ref name=\"dobrev instagram\">{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BI_EoPXgSai/|title=Instagram post

It required that [[Charles II of England]] would convert to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and assist [[Louis XIV]] with 60 warships to help and 4000 soldiers in France's war of conquest against the [[Dutch Republic]]. In exchange, Charles would secretly receive a yearly pension of \u00a3230,000, as well as an extra sum of money when Charles informed the English people of his conversion, and France would send 6,000 French troops if there was ever a rebellion against Charles in England.   The secret treaty was signed by Arlington, Arundell, Clifford and Bellings for England and Colbert de Croissy for France.  Both kings exchanged letters of ratification and kept secret the existence of the treaty.<ref>G.M.D. Howat, ''Stuart and Cromwellian Foreign Policy'' (1974) pp 126\u201332.</ref>  A public treaty of Dover was also negotiated, but it was a fake designed for propaganda and to hide the religious dimension of the secret treaty.

Louis was first cousin to Charles (through their grandfather [[Henry IV of France]]).  Henrietta was also Louis's sister-in-law through her marriage to his only brother [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Phillippe, ''duc d'Orl\u00e9ans'']].<ref>David Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' (2nd ed. 1936) vol 1 p 342-44.</ref>\n\nCharles' motives for entering into secret negotiations with France while England was part of the Triple Alliance opposed to France have been the subject of considerable discussion. His suggested motives include a desire to to have Europe's strongest state as an ally, to make himself politically and financially independent of parliament, to ensure that England received a share of the [[Spanish Empire]] if and when it broke up, to use Catholics, and possibly also Protestant dissenters, as a dependable group of supporters to strengthen his monarchy or to revenge himself on the Dutch and particularly its republican government. However, as Charles initially attempted to form an alliance with France without abandoning the Triple Alliance, he was not as consistent in opposing the Dutch republican government as Louis was.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp. 297, 300-301.</ref> Since the provisions of the 1659 [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] included the marriage of Louis to [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]], eldest daughter of [[Philip IV of Spain]], and despite Maria Theresa renouncing her inheritance rights, Louis consistently manoeuvred to acquire Spanish territory adjacent to France and to promote his wife's claim to the Spanish throne.<ref>Gijs Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)'', pp 28, 34.</ref>  \n \nBy the secret treaty Charles was to abandon the Triple Alliance with Sweden and the [[Dutch Republic]] in favour of assisting Louis in conquering the Dutch Republic.  Provided that the conquest was successfully completed, England was promised several very profitable ports along one of the major rivers that run through the Dutch Republic.<ref>Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' vol 1 pp 344-46.</ref>  The main components of the treaty can be paraphrased:\n\n{{quote |The King of England will make a public profession of the Catholic faith, and will receive the sum of two millions of crowns, to aid him in this project, from the Most Christian King, in the course of the next six months.  The date of this declaration is left absolutely to his own pleasure.  The King of France will faithfully observe the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], as regards Spain, and the King of England will maintain the Treaty of the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] in a similar manner.  If new rights to the Spanish monarchy revert to the King of France, the King of England will aid him in maintaining these rights.  The two Kings will declare war against the United Provinces.  The King of France will attack them by land, and will receive the help of 6000 men from England.  The King of England will send 50 men-of-war to sea, and the King of France 30; the combined fleets will be under the [[James II of England|Duke of York]]'s command.  His Britannic Majesty will be content to receive [[Walcheren]], the mouth of the [[Scheldt]], and the isle of [[Cadzand]], as his share of the conquered provinces.  Separate articles will provide for the interests of the [[William III of England|Prince of Orange]].  The Treaty of Commerce, which has already begun, shall be concluded as promptly as possible.<ref>Andrew Browning, ed. ''English Historical Documents: 1660-1714'' (Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1953), pp 863-67 for text; paraphrase by [[Fran\u00e7ois Mignet]] from Julia Ady, ''Madame'' (1894) pp. 332\u201333.</ref>}}\n\nThe secret treaty did not in fact become public until 1771 after the historian Sir [[Sir John Dalrymple, 4th Baronet|John Dalrymple]] published its contents in his ''Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland''.<ref>J. P. Kenyon, ''The History Men. The Historical Profession in England since the Renaissance. Second Edition'' (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1993), pp. 67-68.</ref> Had it been published in Charles II's lifetime, the results might have been drastic; considering the enormous effect of [[Titus Oates]]' highly unreliable assertions of a [[Popish Plot]], an even greater backlash might have followed had the English public learned that the King actually obliged himself to turn Catholic and that he was willing to rely on French troops to impose that conversion on his own subjects.\n\n==The \"cover\" treaty==\nThe [[secret treaty]] was signed and sealed in June 1670.  The [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] was then appointed to negotiate a treaty with the King of France.  He was amazed by how smoothly it went.  This treaty closely followed the secret treaty just concluded, but the clause by which King Charles was to declare himself a Roman Catholic as soon as the affairs of his kingdom permitted did not appear; neither, therefore, did the stipulation that the attack on the Netherlands would follow his declaration.  This treaty was signed by all five members of the [[Cabal Ministry]] on 21 December 1670 and was made known to the public. However King Charles and the French knew it was a meaningless fake.<ref>Antonia Fraser, ''Royal Charles: Charles II and the Restoration'' (1979), pp. 275&ndash;276</ref><ref>Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' vol 1 pp 346-48.</ref><ref>Tim Harris, ''Restoration: Charles II and his kingdoms, 1660-1685'' (2006) p 71.</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}<!--2 paragraphs without citations-->\nMilitary preparations took some time.  Louis declared war on the Dutch on 6 April 1672, and Charles followed suit the next day.  The [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] failed to go off as originally planned.  The costs of deploying the English fleet were much greater than expected, and the money sent by Louis to offset the costs did not come close to enough.  Furthermore, the Dutch, led by [[William III of England|Captain-General William of Orange]] put up a much better fight than expected. Desperate for funds, Charles was forced to call Parliament into session for the first time in over two years. He had hoped to keep it [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogued]] in order to wage the war without its oversight.

It required that [[Charles II of England]] would convert to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and assist [[Louis XIV]] with 60 warships to help and 4000 soldiers in France's war of conquest against the [[Dutch Republic]]. In exchange, Charles would secretly receive a yearly pension of \u00a3230,000, as well as an extra sum of money when Charles informed the English people of his conversion, and France would send 6,000 French troops if there was ever a rebellion against Charles in England.   The secret treaty was signed by Arlington, Arundell, Clifford and Bellings for England and Colbert de Croissy for France.

Although the two nations had secretly discussed forming a closer relationship after [[The Restoration]], and Charles suggested an Anglo-French treaty.<ref>Gijs Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)'', pp 29-30.</ref> Charles' assumption that Louis would prefer such a treaty to one with the Dutch was mistaken, as an English treaty was not necessary for Louis' objectives in the [[Spanish Netherlands]], but one with the Dutch Republic was,<ref>Gijs Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)'' (2004) pp 65,109.</ref> After the signature of a Franco-Dutch defensive treaty in 1662, relations between England and France continued to deteriorate until a French declaration of war against England in January 1666.<ref>Gijs Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)'', p 151.</ref>    \n \nDuring the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], mutual suspicion grew between the Dutch and Louis, and following its end and the start of the [[War of Devolution]], both in 1667, a [[Triple Alliance (1668)]] was former between the Dutch Republic, England and Sweden was formed in 1668 to counter French aggression in the Spanish Netherlands.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp 299-300.</ref> During 1669, friction between the members of the Triple Alliance convinced Louis that he could detach either England or the Dutch Republic from it and, following an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate with the Dutch, he was approached by Charles, who used his sister as point of contact, to form an alliance.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp 300-301.</ref> The only participants in the talks to begin with were [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] of France, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] of England, and Charles's sister [[Princess Henrietta of England|Henrietta]], ''[[duchesse d'Orl\u00e9ans]]''. Louis was first cousin to Charles (through their grandfather [[Henry IV of France]]).  Henrietta was also Louis's sister-in-law through her marriage to his only brother [[Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Phillippe, ''duc d'Orl\u00e9ans'']].<ref>David Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' (2nd ed. 1936) vol 1 p 342-44.</ref>\n\nCharles' motives for entering into secret negotiations with France while England was part of the Triple Alliance opposed to France have been the subject of considerable discussion. His suggested motives include a desire to to have Europe's strongest state as an ally, to make himself politically and financially independent of parliament, to ensure that England received a share of the [[Spanish Empire]] if and when it broke up, to use Catholics, and possibly also Protestant dissenters, as a dependable group of supporters to strengthen his monarchy or to revenge himself on the Dutch and particularly its republican government. However, as Charles initially attempted to form an alliance with France without abandoning the the Triple Alliance, he was not as consistent in opposing the Dutch republican government as Louis was.<ref>Ronald Hutton, \"The Making of the Secret Treaty of Dover, 1668\u20131670.\" pp. 297, 300-301.</ref> Since the provisions of the 1659 [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]] included the marriage of Louis to [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]], eldest daughter of [[Philip IV of Spain]], and despite Maria Theresa renouncing her inheritance rights, Louis consistently manoeuvred to acquire Spanish territory adjacent to France and to promote his wife's claim to the Spanish throne.<ref>Gijs Rommelse, ''The Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665-1667)'', pp 28, 34.</ref>  \n \nBy the secret treaty Charles was to abandon the Triple Alliance with Sweden and the [[Dutch Republic]] in favour of assisting Louis in conquering the Dutch Republic.  Provided that the conquest was successfully completed, England was promised several very profitable ports along one of the major rivers that run through the Dutch Republic.<ref>Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' vol 1 pp 344-46.</ref>  The main components of the treaty can be paraphrased:\n\n{{quote |The King of England will make a public profession of the Catholic faith, and will receive the sum of two millions of crowns, to aid him in this project, from the Most Christian King, in the course of the next six months.  The date of this declaration is left absolutely to his own pleasure.  The King of France will faithfully observe the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], as regards Spain, and the King of England will maintain the Treaty of the [[Triple Alliance (1668)|Triple Alliance]] in a similar manner.  If new rights to the Spanish monarchy revert to the King of France, the King of England will aid him in maintaining these rights.  The two Kings will declare war against the United Provinces.  The King of France will attack them by land, and will receive the help of 6000 men from England.  The King of England will send 50 men-of-war to sea, and the King of France 30; the combined fleets will be under the [[James II of England|Duke of York]]'s command.  His Britannic Majesty will be content to receive [[Walcheren]], the mouth of the [[Scheldt]], and the isle of [[Cadzand]], as his share of the conquered provinces.  Separate articles will provide for the interests of the [[William III of England|Prince of Orange]].  The Treaty of Commerce, which has already begun, shall be concluded as promptly as possible.<ref>Andrew Browning, ed. ''English Historical Documents: 1660-1714'' (Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1953), pp 863-67 for text; paraphrase by [[Fran\u00e7ois Mignet]] from Julia Ady, ''Madame'' (1894) pp. 332\u201333.</ref>}}\n\nThe secret treaty did not in fact become public until 1771 after the historian Sir [[Sir John Dalrymple, 4th Baronet|John Dalrymple]] published its contents in his ''Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland''.<ref>J. P. Kenyon, ''The History Men. The Historical Profession in England since the Renaissance. Second Edition'' (Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1993), pp. 67-68.</ref> Had it been published in Charles II's lifetime, the results might have been drastic; considering the enormous effect of [[Titus Oates]]' highly unreliable assertions of a [[Popish Plot]], an even greater backlash might have followed had the English public learned that the King actually obliged himself to turn Catholic and that he was willing to rely on French troops to impose that conversion on his own subjects.\n\n==The \"cover\" treaty==\nThe [[secret treaty]] was signed and sealed in June 1670.  The [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]] was then appointed to negotiate a treaty with the King of France.  He was amazed by how smoothly it went.  This treaty closely followed the secret treaty just concluded, but the clause by which King Charles was to declare himself a Roman Catholic as soon as the affairs of his kingdom permitted did not appear; neither, therefore, did the stipulation that the attack on the Netherlands would follow his declaration.  This treaty was signed by all five members of the [[Cabal Ministry]] on 21 December 1670 and was made known to the public. However King Charles and the French knew it was a meaningless fake.<ref>Antonia Fraser, ''Royal Charles: Charles II and the Restoration'' (1979), pp. 275&ndash;276</ref><ref>Ogg, ''England in the Reign of Charles II'' vol 1 pp 346-48.</ref><ref>Tim Harris, ''Restoration: Charles II and his kingdoms, 1660-1685'' (2006) p 71.</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2018}}<!--2 paragraphs without citations-->\nMilitary preparations took some time.  Louis declared war on the Dutch on 6 April 1672, and Charles followed suit the next day.  The [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]] failed to go off as originally planned.  The costs of deploying the English fleet were much greater than expected, and the money sent by Louis to offset the costs did not come close to enough.  Furthermore, the Dutch, led by [[William III of England|Captain-General William of Orange]] put up a much better fight than expected. Desperate for funds, Charles was forced to call Parliament into session for the first time in over two years. He had hoped to keep it [[legislative session#Procedure in Commonwealth realms|prorogued]] in order to wage the war without its oversight.  In 1674, largely because of pressure put upon Charles by Parliament, England signed the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] ending their involvement in the third Anglo-Dutch War.
