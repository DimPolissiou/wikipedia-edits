Urquidez is also known for once holding the rare achievement of six world titles in five different weight divisions, and remained largely undefeated in his 27-year career. His only loss came in a [[Muay Thai]] match which was shrouded in controversy, as Urquidez had only agreed to a no-decision exhibition, a clause which was ignored when the fight had ended.<ref>{{cite news|title= Urquidez Jets Way to Victory, Netting 6th Kickboxing Crown |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1993-12-05|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-12-05/sports/sp-64230_1_urquidez-jets |accessdate=2010-12-21|first=Don|last=Weiner}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1974 and 1993, he amassed a documented professional record of 49\u20131\u20131 (win-loss-draw) with 35 knockouts and two controversial no-contests, although he is also supposed to have an additional record of 10\u20130\u20131 (10 KOs) in undocumented professional fights, making a total of 59\u20131\u20132\u20132 (45 KOs).<ref>{{cite news |title=BENNY 'THE JET' URQUIDEZ |publisher=[[STAR System World Kickboxing Ratings|S.T.A.R.]] |url=http://starsystemkickboxing.net/BennyUrquidez.aspx |accessdate=2011-07-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827220741/http://starsystemkickboxing.net/BennyUrquidez.aspx |archivedate=2011-08-27 }}</ref>  However, sources vary with ''Ratings'' listing Urquidez as 63\u20130\u20131, (57 knockouts) and on his own official webpage, Urquidez lists his fight record as 200\u20130, and says he was 63\u20130, with 57 knockouts in title defenses.

His parentage is Spanish and Mexican with some [[Blackfoot]] [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]]s ancestry. Urquidez and his wife are part of the Blackfoot tribe.\n\nBenny began competing in 1958, at the age of five, in \"peewee\" boxing and wrestling in Los Angeles. His martial arts instruction started when he was seven years old; his first formal teacher was [[Bill Ryusaki]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.kenponet.com/flame/whoswho/whoswho/bill_ryusaki.html | title= Bill Ryusaki| website= kenponet.com| access-date= 2011-06-04}}</ref> Urquidez received his [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] at the age of 14, a highly unusual feat in the 1960s.

In the 1973 [[Long Beach International Karate Championships|Internationals]], he fought John Natividad in what is considered one of the greatest non-contact bouts in history.{{citation needed|date= February 2017}} In an unprecedented 25-point overtime match, Natividad won the match 13\u201312, receiving the Grand Title and the $2,500 purse. In May 1974, at the [[PAWAK]] Tournament, Urquidez lost a 4\u20131 decision to [[Joe Lewis (martial arts)|Joe Lewis]]. He also competed in England and Belgium as a member of [[Ed Parker]]'s 1974 US team. Also in 1974, he began his move away from the non-contact style by entering and winning the [[World Series of Martial Arts]] Championship, effectively a tough-man contest with few rules. Over the next two decades, he fought under various kickboxing organizations (NKL, WPKO, [[Professional Karate Association]] (PKA), [[World Kickboxing Association]] (WKA), AJKBA, Shin-Kakutojutsu Federation, NJPW and MTN) to amass a record of 58 wins with no losses.  This undefeated record, though official, is controversial and highly disputed.\n\nIn 1977, Urquidez traveled to Japan and fought under the WKA's compromise US\u2013Japan rules which included leg kicks and knees to the body.<ref name=\"STAR record Urquidez\"/> He defeated [[Katsuyuki Suzuki]] by KO in the 6th round (August 1977) as part of the professional wrestling event in which [[Antonio Inoki]] fought Everett Eddy in what was said to be a wrestler/karate fighter mixed match but was a pre-determined [[pro wrestling]] match.  The Suzuki fight materialized because the newly formed WKA organization could not compete against the PKA in the US.<ref>{{vcite news |title=The Dave Cater Interview |author=BAB Japan |date=August 1, 1987 |work=\u683c\u95d8\u6280\u901a\u4fe1No.9 Kakutougi Tsuushin (\"Martial Arts Network No. 9\")| location= Japan}}</ref> At the same time, Japanese professional wrestler [[Antonio Inoki]], who gained the worldwide fame by fighting [[Muhammad Ali]] in the controversial 1976 boxer/wrestler mixed-match in Japan, had been looking for new opponents for what he called the world martial arts championship series. Eventually, promoter Ron Holmes discovered Everett Eddy for Inoki.  By that time, Eddy had been coached by Arnold Urquidez, and lost in a knockout in the 1st round to PKA world heavyweight champion Ross Scott in the previous year.  In the same event, Benny Urquidez knocked out [[Howard Jackson (kickboxer)|Howard Jackson]], but soon his lightweight title was stripped by the PKA, and so both Eddy and Urquidez had no action in the US, and had to look for fights overseas. Even though the Inoki/Eddy bout was successful, it was the fight between Urquidez and Suzuki, which shocked Japan, where Japanese kickboxing had been very popular. Though never tested for or achieved any rank in Japanese karate, Urquidez has decided to bestow upon himself{{citation needed|date= February 2017}} the rank of ''[[sensei]]'', a Japanese honorific term which at the most shallowest term, would mean \"guide\".\n\nThe All-Japan Kickboxing Association, for which Suzuki had been rated as No. 2, became interested in the American sport of full-contact karate, decided to promote series of mixed-rules bouts between the American full-contact karate fighters and Japanese kickboxers.  On November 14, 1977, the AJKF held the first of such event which featured Benny Urquidez, his brother-in-law Blinky Rodriguez, Marc Costello, Brendan Leddy, Tony Lopez, Leonard Galiza and Freddy Avila.  Only Benny Urquidez and Costello came out as the winners for the American team.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=INQDAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=black+belt+magazine+1978&hl=en&ei=-NcDTpPSJ8Xe0QH3nZWGCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=black%20belt%20magazine%201978&f=false | title= Urquidez Retains Title with Knockout Over Okao| date= April 1978| work= [[Black Belt (magazine)|Black Belt]]| publisher= online at Google Books| page= 10| access-date= 3 November 2010}}</ref> Urquidez's victory over Kunimitsu Okao convinced the Japanese fight fans, and eventually began to be featured as the central figure for what was supposed to be the documentary comic book, ''The Square Ring'', until he declined to avenge his loss against the [[Thai people|Thai]] opponent [[Prayout Sittiboonlert]]. Urquidez's second loss came in August 1980 in Florida. American [[Billye Jackson]] dominated seven rounds including knocking Urquidez down. Urquidez protested the decision and petitioned the WKA's Howard Hansen to classify it as a [[non-contest]].\n\nAfter 1980, Urquidez' ring appearances became less frequent. Between 1981 and 1984 he fought only sporadically. In 1984, he fought [[Ivan Sprang]] in [[Amsterdam]] under modified [[Muay Thai]] rules (no elbows), winning by 6th-round TKO. His ring career largely came to a halt after 1985, and he retired after facing [[Yoshihisa Tagami]] at the age of 41. Subsequently, Urquidez became devoted to [[acting]], teaching kickboxing and [[Stage combat|martial arts choreography]]. Urquidez's late brother Reuben was also a competitive martial artist and actor; they appeared together in a 1982 training video, ''World Of Martial Arts'', along with [[Steve Sanders (karate)]], [[Chuck Norris]] and [[John Saxon]]. [[Van Halen]] lead singer [[David Lee Roth]] dedicated the band's hit 1984 song \"[[Jump (Van Halen song)|Jump]]\" to Urquidez, of whom Roth was a student.<ref name=\"Christe2009\">{{cite book|last=Christe|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Christe|title=Everybody Wants Some: The Van Halen Saga|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qyhHmGh_9fEC&pg=PA97|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-53618-6|page=97}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Urquidez and [[Emil Farkas]] founded the Los Angeles Film Fighting Institute, which was one of the first schools of its kind in the United States to teach martial artists the intricacies of stunt work.\n\nUrquidez has had training in nine styles: ''[[Judo]]'', ''[[Kajukenbo]]'', ''[[Shotokan]]'', ''[[Taekwondo]]'', ''[[Lima Lama]]'', ''[[White Crane Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Jujutsu]]'', ''[[Aikido]]'' and ''[[American Kenpo]]''.

Consequently, he fought in several unorthodox match-ups and hotly disputed bouts. In late 1974, in the grand finale of an early [[mixed martial arts]]-style tough man contest in Honolulu, Hawaii, a 5-foot 6-inch 145-pound Urquidez decisioned a 6-foot 1-inch 230-pound Dana Goodson after scoring a takedown and pin against Goodson in the third and final round.<ref>\"Inter-Art Melee Earns Urquidez $5,000 Prize\" (March 1975). ''Professional Karate'' magazine, pp. 8-9.</ref>\n\nA year later, in Detroit, Urquidez was disqualified for knocking out his opponent with a fourth punch under the subsequently-discontinued three-punch rule. The disqualifying referee was the opponent's own karate instructor. The bout was excoriated on network television, prompting state athletic commissions across the United States to become interested in regulating the sport. Chuck Norris' short-lived International Karate League (IKL) and later the [[STAR System World Kickboxing Ratings|STAR System world ratings]] reversed this outcome.<ref name=\"STAR record Urquidez\">\"STAR Authenticated Kickboxing Record: Benny Urquidez\" (4 December 1993).

Retrieved on 19 June 2011.</ref>\n\nAnother three bouts were eventually ruled no-contests (NC). The first, in Los Angeles on March 12, 1977, was a nine-round NC (WKA) against Thai boxer Narongnoi Kiatbandit as part of the inaugural WKA world title event.<ref>Marlow, Chris (November 1981). \"The WKA: The First Worldwide Sanctioning Body for Full-Contact Karate\", ''Karate Monthly'' magazine, pp. 60-70.</ref> Urquidez scored flash-knockdowns against Narongnoi in rounds three and six as well as five legal throws over three other rounds. Narongnoi was warned for illegal knee kicks and groin attacks on four occasions before being assessed with a point deduction in round nine. However, the point deduction came shortly after Narongnoi had scored his sole flash-knockdown which, in turn, provoked a riot among Muay Thai fans in the audience. The audience invaded the ring moments before the final bell. Scores were never collected for round nine. The California State Athletic Commission declared the no-contest.<ref name=\"STAR record Urquidez\"/>\n\nNext, on April 29, 1978, Urquidez faced his fourth Japanese opponent Shinobu Onuki in Tokyo; the event was co-promoted by the AJKBA and Shin-Kakutojutsu Federation.  Eventually, Urquidez executed a throw that dislocated Onuki's shoulder.  Initially, because of the throw, Urquidez was given a TKO loss, however, the promoters acknowledged that Urquidez used the throw without knowing it was illegal under Japanese rules; the bout was then scored as a no-contest.<ref>Benny Urquidez (1982). \u683c\u95d8\u6280\u306b\u751f\u304d\u308b Living On The Martial Arts. Japan: Sports Life Publications, Inc. Japan. pp. 185.</ref> Following this unsatisfactory result, the two faced each other again in Las Vegas on January 2, 1980.  The fight was aired by NBC, and this time Urquidez knocked out Onuki with a left hook to the body. Later, in October 1981, when the AJKBA merged with the WKA, the WKA transmuted the original Onuki no-contest to a TKO victory for Urquidez because, in fact, Urquidez's fight contract had permitted throws.<ref name=\"STAR record Urquidez\"/>\n\nThird, Urquidez fought to a seven-round NC (WKA) against Billye Jackson in West Palm Beach, Florida, on August 8, 1980. This non-title fight was first reported as a seven-round decision for Jackson; then was changed to a seven-round technical draw, and then to a no-contest. The WKA waited until March 1986 to unambiguously transmute this outcome owing to uneven glove assignments and a coerced last-minute rule change that unfairly affected Urquidez's performance in an otherwise close bout. Despite multiple attempts to reschedule a rematch to settle the dispute Urquidez refused to fight Jackson.<ref name=\"STAR record Urquidez\"/> The no-contest status of these fights has been corroborated in print by Paul Maslak (Chief Administrator of the [[STAR System World Kickboxing Ratings|STAR System world ratings]]).<ref name=\"Benny Urquidez 1995 p. 318\">Benny Urquidez, ''King of The Ring''.

The rules for the bout included six two-minute rounds, one-minute intervals, and no elbow contact as per agreement with Urquidez.

He claimed to have backed down from the fight, considering it to be just a promotional stunt, due to Rorion demanding to fight for free after having negotiated for a fight purse.<ref name=Kess/> In response, in November of the same year, Rorion's brother [[Royce Gracie]] challenged Urquidez himself,<ref>''Letters'', Black Belt magazine, February 1995</ref> which Benny rejected on the grounds of being retired.<ref name=Roy/>\n\nMonths later, Royce claimed that Rorion had already dominated Urquidez in a training at his Jet Center gym in 1978, taking him down multiple times without being touched, and accused Urquidez of not having helped the Gracies to establish themselves as he had promised.<ref name=Roy>Royce Gracie, ''The Ultimate Fighter'', Black Belt magazine, March 1995</ref> He also claimed Urquidez only wanted to fight under [[kickboxing]] rules, without risking to being defeated.<ref name=Roy/>\n\n==Movie roles==\n\n{{BLP sources section|date=July 2011}}\nUrquidez has played a number of roles in various [[martial arts movies]].

He trained [[Patrick Swayze]] in his own fighting techniques for the film.

Urquidez is also known for once holding the rare achievement of six world titles in five different weight divisions, and remained largely undefeated in his 27-year career. His only loss came in a [[Muay Thai]] match which was shrouded in controversy, as Urquidez had only agreed to a no-decision exhibition, a clause which was ignored when the fight had ended.<ref>{{cite news|title= Urquidez Jets Way to Victory, Netting 6th Kickboxing Crown |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=1993-12-05|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-12-05/sports/sp-64230_1_urquidez-jets |accessdate=2010-12-21|first=Don|last=Weiner}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1974 and 1993, he amassed a documented professional record of 49\u20131\u20131 (win-loss-draw) with 35 knockouts and two controversial no-contests, although he is also supposed to have an additional record of 10\u20130\u20131 (10 KOs) in undocumented professional fights, making a total of 59\u20131\u20132\u20132 (45 KOs).<ref>{{cite news |title=BENNY 'THE JET' URQUIDEZ |publisher=[[STAR System World Kickboxing Ratings|S.T.A.R.]] |url=http://starsystemkickboxing.net/BennyUrquidez.aspx |accessdate=2011-07-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827220741/http://starsystemkickboxing.net/BennyUrquidez.aspx |archivedate=2011-08-27 }}</ref>  However, sources vary with ''Ratings'' listing Urquidez as 63\u20130\u20131, (57 knockouts) and on his own official webpage, Urquidez lists his fight record as 200\u20130, and says he was 63\u20130, with 57 knockouts in title defenses. Also, he claims to have been undefeated in the \"Adult Black Belt Division\" prior to entering full-contact karate. ''[[Black Belt (magazine)|Black Belt]]'' magazine voted Urquidez \"Competitor of the Year\" in 1978.<ref>{{cite news|title=Black Belt Hall of Fame |work=Black Belt Magazine |url=http://www.blackbeltmag.com/archives/719 |accessdate=2010-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309234705/http://www.blackbeltmag.com/archives/719 |archivedate=2009-03-09 }}</ref>\n\nHe has also appeared in occasional acting roles, mostly in action films during the 1980s and 1990s, notably the [[Jackie Chan]] movies ''[[Wheels on Meals]]'' (1984) and ''[[Dragons Forever]]'' (1988).\n\n==Early life, family and education==\n{{expand section| date= February 2017}}\nUrquidez was born in [[Los Angeles County, California]], the son of a [[wrestling]] mother and a [[boxing]] father. His parentage is Spanish and Mexican with some [[Blackfoot]] [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]]s ancestry. Urquidez and his wife are part of the Blackfoot tribe.\n\nBenny began competing in 1958, at the age of five, in \"peewee\" boxing and wrestling in Los Angeles. His martial arts instruction started when he was seven years old; his first formal teacher was [[Bill Ryusaki]].<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.kenponet.com/flame/whoswho/whoswho/bill_ryusaki.html | title= Bill Ryusaki| website= kenponet.com| access-date= 2011-06-04}}</ref> Urquidez received his [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] at the age of 14, a highly unusual feat in the 1960s.

In the 1973 [[Long Beach International Karate Championships|Internationals]], he fought John Natividad in what is considered one of the greatest non-contact bouts in history.{{citation needed|date= February 2017}} In an unprecedented 25-point overtime match, Natividad won the match 13\u201312, receiving the Grand Title and the $2,500 purse. In May 1974, at the [[PAWAK]] Tournament, Urquidez lost a 4\u20131 decision to [[Joe Lewis (martial arts)|Joe Lewis]]. He also competed in England and Belgium as a member of [[Ed Parker]]'s 1974 US team. Also in 1974, he began his move away from the non-contact style by entering and winning the [[World Series of Martial Arts]] Championship, effectively a tough-man contest with few rules. Over the next two decades, he fought under various kickboxing organizations (NKL, WPKO, [[Professional Karate Association]] (PKA), [[World Kickboxing Association]] (WKA), AJKBA, Shin-Kakutojutsu Federation, NJPW and MTN) to amass a record of 58 wins with no losses.  This undefeated record, though official, is controversial and highly disputed.\n\nIn 1977, Urquidez traveled to Japan and fought under the WKA's compromise US\u2013Japan rules which included leg kicks and knees to the body.<ref name=\"STAR record Urquidez\"/> He defeated [[Katsuyuki Suzuki]] by KO in the 6th round (August 1977) as part of the professional wrestling event in which [[Antonio Inoki]] fought Everett Eddy in what was said to be a wrestler/karate fighter mixed match but was a pre-determined [[pro wrestling]] match.  The Suzuki fight materialized because the newly formed WKA organization could not compete against the PKA in the US.<ref>{{vcite news |title=The Dave Cater Interview |author=BAB Japan |date=August 1, 1987 |work=\u683c\u95d8\u6280\u901a\u4fe1No.9 Kakutougi Tsuushin (\"Martial Arts Network No. 9\")| location= Japan}}</ref> At the same time, Japanese professional wrestler [[Antonio Inoki]], who gained the worldwide fame by fighting [[Muhammad Ali]] in the controversial 1976 boxer/wrestler mixed-match in Japan, had been looking for new opponents for what he called the world martial arts championship series. Eventually, promoter Ron Holmes discovered Everett Eddy for Inoki.  By that time, Eddy had been coached by Arnold Urquidez, and lost in a knockout in the 1st round to PKA world heavyweight champion Ross Scott in the previous year.  In the same event, Benny Urquidez knocked out [[Howard Jackson (kickboxer)|Howard Jackson]], but soon his lightweight title was stripped by the PKA, and so both Eddy and Urquidez had no action in the US, and had to look for fights overseas. Even though the Inoki/Eddy bout was successful, it was the fight between Urquidez and Suzuki, which shocked Japan, where Japanese kickboxing had been very popular. Though never tested for or achieved any rank in Japanese karate, Urquidez has decided to bestow upon himself{{citation needed|date= February 2017}} the rank of ''[[sensei]]'', a Japanese honorific term which at the most shallowest term, would mean \"guide\".\n\nThe All-Japan Kickboxing Association, for which Suzuki had been rated as No. 2, became interested in the American sport of full-contact karate, decided to promote series of mixed-rules bouts between the American full-contact karate fighters and Japanese kickboxers.  On November 14, 1977, the AJKF held the first of such event which featured Benny Urquidez, his brother-in-law Blinky Rodriguez, Marc Costello, Brendan Leddy, Tony Lopez, Leonard Galiza and Freddy Avila.  Only Benny Urquidez and Costello came out as the winners for the American team.<ref>{{cite news| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=INQDAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=black+belt+magazine+1978&hl=en&ei=-NcDTpPSJ8Xe0QH3nZWGCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=black%20belt%20magazine%201978&f=false | title= Urquidez Retains Title with Knockout Over Okao| date= April 1978| work= [[Black Belt (magazine)|Black Belt]]| publisher= online at Google Books| page= 10| access-date= 3 November 2010}}</ref> Urquidez's victory over Kunimitsu Okao convinced the Japanese fight fans, and eventually began to be featured as the central figure for what was supposed to be the documentary comic book, ''The Square Ring'', until he declined to avenge his loss against the [[Thai people|Thai]] opponent [[Prayout Sittiboonlert]]. Urquidez's second loss came in August 1980 in Florida. American [[Billye Jackson]] dominated seven rounds including knocking Urquidez down. Urquidez protested the decision and petitioned the WKA's Howard Hansen to classify it as a [[non-contest]].\n\nAfter 1980, Urquidez' ring appearances became less frequent. Between 1981 and 1984 he fought only sporadically. In 1984, he fought [[Ivan Sprang]] in [[Amsterdam]] under modified [[Muay Thai]] rules (no elbows), winning by 6th-round TKO. His ring career largely came to a halt after 1985, and he retired after facing [[Yoshihisa Tagami]] at the age of 41. Subsequently, Urquidez became devoted to [[acting]], teaching kickboxing and [[Stage combat|martial arts choreography]]. Urquidez's late brother Reuben was also a competitive martial artist and actor; they appeared together in a 1982 training video, ''World Of Martial Arts'', along with [[Steve Sanders (karate)]], [[Chuck Norris]] and [[John Saxon]]. [[Van Halen]] lead singer [[David Lee Roth]] dedicated the band's hit 1984 song \"[[Jump (Van Halen song)|Jump]]\" to Urquidez, of whom Roth was a student.<ref name=\"Christe2009\">{{cite book|last=Christe|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Christe|title=Everybody Wants Some: The Van Halen Saga|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qyhHmGh_9fEC&pg=PA97|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-53618-6|page=97}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Urquidez and [[Emil Farkas]] founded the Los Angeles Film Fighting Institute, which was one of the first schools of its kind in the United States to teach martial artists the intricacies of stunt work.\n\nUrquidez has had training in nine styles: ''[[Judo]]'', ''[[Kajukenbo]]'', ''[[Shotokan]]'', ''[[Taekwondo]]'', ''[[Lima Lama]]'', ''[[White Crane Kung Fu]]'', ''[[Jujutsu]]'', ''[[Aikido]]'' and ''[[American Kenpo]]''.

Consequently, he fought in several unorthodox match-ups and hotly disputed bouts. In late 1974, in the grand finale of an early [[mixed martial arts]]-style tough man contest in Honolulu, Hawaii, a 5-foot 6-inch 145-pound Urquidez decisioned a 6-foot 1-inch 230-pound Dana Goodson after scoring a takedown and pin against Goodson in the third and final round.<ref>\"Inter-Art Melee Earns Urquidez $5,000 Prize\" (March 1975). ''Professional Karate'' magazine, pp. 8-9.</ref>\n\nA year later, in Detroit, Urquidez was disqualified for knocking out his opponent with a fourth punch under the subsequently-discontinued three-punch rule. The disqualifying referee was the opponent's own karate instructor. The bout was excoriated on network television, prompting state athletic commissions across the United States to become interested in regulating the sport. Chuck Norris' short-lived International Karate League (IKL) and later the [[STAR System World Kickboxing Ratings|STAR System world ratings]] reversed this outcome.<ref name=\"STAR record Urquidez\">\"STAR Authenticated Kickboxing Record: Benny Urquidez\" (4 December 1993).

The first, in Los Angeles on March 12, 1977, was a nine-round NC (WKA) against Thai boxer Narongnoi Kiatbandit as part of the inaugural WKA world title event.<ref>Marlow, Chris (November 1981). \"The WKA: The First Worldwide Sanctioning Body for Full-Contact Karate\", ''Karate Monthly'' magazine, pp. 60-70.</ref> Urquidez scored flash-knockdowns against Narongnoi in rounds three and six as well as five legal throws over three other rounds. Narongnoi was warned for illegal knee kicks and groin attacks on four occasions before being assessed with a point deduction in round nine. However, the point deduction came shortly after Narongnoi had scored his sole flash-knockdown which, in turn, provoked a riot among Muay Thai fans in the audience. The audience invaded the ring moments before the final bell. Scores were never collected for round nine. The California State Athletic Commission declared the no-contest.<ref name=\"STAR record Urquidez\"/>\n\nNext, on April 29, 1978, Urquidez faced his fourth Japanese opponent Shinobu Onuki in Tokyo; the event was co-promoted by the AJKBA and Shin-Kakutojutsu Federation.  Eventually, Urquidez executed a throw that dislocated Onuki's shoulder.  Initially, because of the throw, Urquidez was given a TKO loss, however, the promoters acknowledged that Urquidez used the throw without knowing it was illegal under Japanese rules; the bout was then scored as a no-contest.<ref>Benny Urquidez (1982). \u683c\u95d8\u6280\u306b\u751f\u304d\u308b Living On The Martial Arts. Japan: Sports Life Publications, Inc. Japan. pp. 185.</ref> Following this unsatisfactory result, the two faced each other again in Las Vegas on January 2, 1980.  The fight was aired by NBC, and this time Urquidez knocked out Onuki with a left hook to the body. Later, in October 1981, when the AJKBA merged with the WKA, the WKA transmuted the original Onuki no-contest to a TKO victory for Urquidez because, in fact, Urquidez's fight contract had permitted throws.<ref name=\"STAR record Urquidez\"/>\n\nThird, Urquidez fought to a seven-round NC (WKA) against Billye Jackson in West Palm Beach, Florida, on August 8, 1980. This non-title fight was first reported as a seven-round decision for Jackson; then was changed to a seven-round technical draw, and then to a no-contest. The WKA waited until March 1986 to unambiguously transmute this outcome owing to uneven glove assignments and a coerced last-minute rule change that unfairly affected Urquidez's performance in an otherwise close bout.Despite multiple attempts to reschedule a rematch to settle the dispute Urquidez refused to fight Jackson.<ref name=\"STAR record Urquidez\"/> The no-contest status of these fights has been corroborated in print by Paul Maslak (Chief Administrator of the [[STAR System World Kickboxing Ratings|STAR System world ratings]]).<ref name=\"Benny Urquidez 1995 p. 318\">Benny Urquidez, ''King of The Ring''.

The rules for the bout included six two-minute rounds, one-minute intervals, and no elbow contact as per agreement with Urquidez.
