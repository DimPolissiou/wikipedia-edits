The male's call includes sometimes soft warbles of 'jeew' or 'chir-wi' or the melodious song 'chiti WEEW wewidoo'.<ref name=Sibley/>\n\n==Food==\nAbout two thirds of an adult bluebird's diet consists of insects and other invertebrates. The remainder is made up of wild fruits or berries. The bluebird's preferred insect prey include grasshoppers, crickets, katydids, and beetles. Other prey include earthworms, spiders, millipedes, centipedes, sow bugs, and snails.\n[[File:7Z1E5531.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Male]]\nBluebirds feed by perching on a high point, such as a branch or fence post, and swooping down to catch insects on or near the ground. The availability of a winter food source will often determine whether or not a bird will migrate. If bluebirds do remain in a region for the winter, they group and seek cover in heavy thickets, orchards, or other areas in which adequate food and cover resources are available.\n\n==Life history==\n[[File:Eastern bluebird of Huntley Meadows 2016.jpg|alt=Bluebird sitting on a branch in the woods|left|thumb|Eastern bluebird in [[Huntley Meadows Park]] in Virginia]]\nEastern bluebirds are very social birds. At times, they gather in flocks of a hundred or more. However, they are territorial during the breeding season and may continue to defend a feeding area throughout the winter. Mating occurs in the spring and summer. A mature female typically raises two broods each season. Nests are constructed in trees within abandoned woodpecker holes or other cavities that provide adequate protection (usually several feet above ground). Construction of the nest is done primarily by the female and takes around 10 days to complete. These nests are small, cup-like structures lined with grass, feathers, stems, and hairs. Each female lays three to seven light-blue or, rarely, white eggs. The female incubates the eggs, which hatch after 13 to 16 days. The young cannot care for themselves upon hatching. The female broods the chicks for up to seven days after hatching. Fledglings then leave the nest 15 to 20 days after hatching.<ref name=Michigan/>\n\nBoth parents cooperate in raising the young, which they feed a diet consisting almost entirely of insects. Some young stay around the nest to help raise another brood. Fledglings are grayish in color, with speckled breasts. The blue color becomes much more prominent and the speckles on their breasts disappear as they mature. Bluebirds may begin breeding the summer after they are hatched.<ref name=Michigan/>\n\nEastern bluebirds can live for 6 to 10 years. The longest recorded lifespan for a bluebird is 10 years and five months.<ref name=\"Eastern Bluebird, Life History\"/> However, most bluebirds die within their first year of life. Starvation and freezing are a danger to the young, but most threats come from other animals, including humans. Natural predators of eggs and nestlings can include [[eastern chipmunk]]s, [[flying squirrel]]s, [[American black bear]]s, [[fire ant]]s, and [[raccoon]]s. Bluebirds of all ages (including adults) are threatened by [[rat snake]]s, [[Colubridae|racers]], [[American kestrel]]s, and domestic cats. Introduced species such as [[European starling]]s and [[house sparrow]]s are competitors for nesting sites. Non-nesting adults face predation by all native species of [[falcon]]s, [[owl]]s, and most varieties of hawks, particularly those in the genus ''[[Accipiter]]''. When approached by a predator, the male makes a song-like warning cry. If no male is present, a threatened female will begin to sing, hoping to attract a protective male back to the territory. Both males and females also flick their wings and warble when predators are nearby.<ref name=Michigan/>\n\n==Habitat==\n[[File:Bluebird eggs.png|right|thumb|Eggs]]\nEastern bluebirds tend to live in open country around trees, but with little understory and sparse ground cover. Original habitats probably included open, frequently burned pine savannas, beaver ponds, mature but open woods, and forest openings. Today, they're most common along pastures, agricultural fields, suburban parks, backyards, and even golf courses. This bird also occurs across eastern North America and south as far as Nicaragua. Birds that live farther north and in the west of the range tend to lay more eggs than eastern and southern birds.<ref name=\"Eastern Bluebird, Life History\"/>\n\n==Similar species==\n* [[Western bluebird]] (''Sialia mexicana'')\n* [[Mountain bluebird]] (''Sialia currucoides'')\n\n==References==\n<!-- WilsonBull18:47 (compare to current Ohio checklist http://www.ohiobirds.org/publications/OBRClist.pdf) -->\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=AAB>{{Cite AllAboutBirds|Eastern Bluebird}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Eastern Bluebird, Life History\">{{cite web |title=Eastern Bluebird, Life History |url=http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Eastern_Bluebird/lifehistory |website=All About Birds |publisher=The Cornell Lab of Ornithology |accessdate=6 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Michigan>{{cite web |url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Sialia_sialis.html |title=''Sialia sialis'' |website=Animal Diversity Web (ADW)}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=moga>{{cite web |url=http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/01000000101.html |title=Missouri Revised Statutes, Section 10.010.1 - Official State Bird |publisher=Missouri General Assembly}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Sibley>{{cite book |last=Sibley |first=David Allen |authorlink=David Allen Sibley |date=2000 |title=The Sibley Guide to Birds |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |page=[https://archive.org/details/sibleyguidetobir00sibl_0/page/401 401] |isbn=0-679-45122-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/sibleyguidetobir00sibl_0/page/401 }}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Sialia sialis}}\n{{Wikispecies|Sialia sialis}}\n* [http://www.nabluebirdsociety.org/ North American Bluebird Society]\n* [http://birdsbybent.com/ch21-30/bluebird.html Life Histories of Familiar North American Birds: Eastern Bluebird]\n* {{BirdLife|22708550|Sialia sialis}}\n* [http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Eastern_Bluebird.html Eastern Bluebird Species Account] \u2013 Cornell Lab of Ornithology\n* [http://www.bluebirdnews.com/bluebird-species.htm Eastern Bluebird Species Information] from Bluebird Information and Awareness\n* [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/06/0612_020612_birds.html National Geographic News article] Covers N.A.

The references are both general to the entire parent series, as well as to the series finale in particular. In one scene in the Young Sheldon Episode, Sheldon promises his father that when he wins the Nobel Prize, Sheldon will mention his father in his acceptance speech. In the parent series finale, Sheldon wins the Nobel Prize. In another scene in the Young Sheldon episode, Nobel Prize winners are announced out over a montage showing the main characters from the parent series [[Leonard Hofstadter|Leonard]], [[Penny (The Big Bang Theory)|Penny]], [[Rajesh Koothrappali|Raj]], [[Howard Wolowitz|Howard]], [[Bernadette Rostenkowski|Bernadette]] and [[Amy Farrah Fowler|Amy]] as children. Following the montage, adult Sheldon says that he was wrong about feeling at the moment of the Nobel prize announcement that he would be all alone for the rest of his life.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/17/entertainment/young-sheldon-big-bang-theory/index.html|title='Young Sheldon' paid sweet tribute to 'The Big Bang Theory'|first=Sandra|last=Gonzalez|date=May 17, 2019|publisher=[[CNN]]|access-date=October 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191016012516/https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/17/entertainment/young-sheldon-big-bang-theory/index.html|archive-date=October 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Title sequence ==\nThe show's [[title sequence]] is played to the song \"Mighty Little Man\" by [[Steve Burns]].

The series is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] prequel to ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' and begins with the character [[Sheldon Cooper]] at the age of nine, living with his family in [[East Texas]] and going to high school. [[Iain Armitage]] stars as young Sheldon, alongside [[Zoe Perry]], [[Lance Barber]], [[Montana Jordan]], [[Raegan Revord]], and [[Annie Potts]]. [[Jim Parsons]], who portrays the adult Sheldon Cooper on ''The Big Bang Theory'', narrates the series and serves as an [[executive producer]].\n\nDevelopment of the prequel series began in November 2016, from an initial idea that Parsons passed along to ''The Big Bang Theory'' producers. The following March, Armitage and Perry were cast, and the series was ordered by CBS. The series premiered as a special preview on September 25, 2017, and two days later, CBS picked up the series for a full season of 22 episodes. From November 2, 2017, new episodes began airing weekly. In January 2018, CBS renewed the series for a second season which premiered on September 24, 2018, and in February 2019, for a third and fourth season, with the third season having premiered on September 26, 2019.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\nThe series takes place in the late 1980s and early 1990s; and follows [[Sheldon Cooper]] as a young boy attending high school in the fictional town of Medford, [[Texas]], aged nine in the first season<ref name=\"YoungSheldonOrdered\" /> as he tries to fit into the world around him while his family and friends attempt to deal with his unique intellectual capabilities and social challenges.<ref name=\"YoungSheldonOrdered\" /><ref name=\"PremiereDate\" />\n\nIn the series premiere, adult Sheldon states that \"nobody I knew in [[East Texas]] in 1989 cared about [[Newtonian physics]]\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/young-sheldon-is-the-anti-big-bang-theory-thats-why-its-great|title=\u2018Young Sheldon\u2019 Is the Anti-\u2018Big Bang Theory.\u2019 That\u2019s Why It\u2019s Great.|first=Kevin|last=Fallon|date=September 25, 2017|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|access-date=October 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130112352/https://www.thedailybeast.com/young-sheldon-is-the-anti-big-bang-theory-thats-why-its-great|archive-date=November 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>{{efn|Dr. Sturgis and Dr. Linkletter, two college physics professors who teach the classes in which Sheldon enrolls, are not introduced until Season 1 Episode 19 and Season 2 Episode 13 respectively.}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Iain Armitage]] as [[Sheldon Cooper]], a [[child prodigy]] with a \"once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science\".

The references are both general to the entire parent series, as well as to the series finale in particular. In one scene in the Young Sheldon Episode, Sheldon promises his father that when he wins the Nobel Prize, Sheldon will mention his father in his acceptance speech. In the parent series finale, Sheldon wins the Nobel Prize. In another scene in the Young Sheldon episode, Nobel Prize winners are announced out over a montage showing the main characters from the parent series [[Leonard Hofstadter|Leonard]], [[Penny (The Big Bang Theory)|Penny]], [[Rajesh Koothrappali|Raj]], [[Howard Wolowitz|Howard]], [[Bernadette Rostenkowski|Bernadette]] and [[Amy Farrah Fowler|Amy]] as children.

The song features vocals from Canadian rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]. It was written by Mosley, [[Jerome Harmon]], Graham, Timothy Clayton and John Maultsby. The production was helmed by Mosley under his stage-name Timbaland while Harmon served as the assistant producer, under the stage-name Jroc. The song was tailored to Drake's sound and when the rapper wrote to it, he contacted the producer about the lyrics. Despite the verses feeling more like Graham's record, Mosley gave his blessing and went the product. The song was solicited to digital retailers on November 3, 2009 in the United States as the album's second single.\n\n\"Say Something\" is an [[electro (music)|electro-rap]] song with a slow moving beat and feel. Lyrically, it portrays an interaction between Graham and a woman and the awkward feel to it, that is influenced by past events that occurred between them. \"Say Something\" garnered generally mixed reviews from music critics; many of them praised it as a \"radio hit\" but felt it fared worse than Drake's previous works and believed it highlighted Timbaland's weaknesses as a vocalist. Since its domestic release, the song has reached number twenty-three on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]], standing as the second highest charting single from ''Shock Value II'' in the United States. The music video for the song was directed by [[Paul \"Coy\" Allen]] features appearances from [[Sebastian (rapper)|Sebastian]], D.O.E., Attitude and DJ Freestyle Steve.\n\n==Background and composition==\n[[File:Jay-Z 2011.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Timbaland cites Jay-Z as a reason to why the collaboration with Drake came to fruition.]]\"Say Something\" was written by Timothy Mosley, [[Jerome Harmon]], [[Drake (rapper)|Aubrey Graham]], Timothy Clayton and John Maultsby. The production of the song was helmed by Mosley under his stage-name Timbaland and by Harmon under his stage-name Jroc; the latter is credited as the co-producer. The pairing of Timbaland and Drake came about through a discussion between Mosley and [[Jay-Z]]. In an interview with Shaheem Reed of [[MTV News]], Mosley quoted him saying \"'Yo, man, you gonna wanna get in the studio with this guy named Drake. I'm telling you.

The song features vocals from Canadian rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]]. It was written by Mosley, [[Jerome Harmon]], Graham, Timothy Clayton and John Maultsby. The production was helmed by Mosley under his stage-name Timbaland while Harmon served as the assistant producer, under the stage-name Jroc. The song was tailored to Drake's sound and when the rapper wrote to it, he contacted the producer about the lyrics. Despite the verses feeling more like Graham's record, Mosley gave his blessing and went the product. The song was solicited to digital retailers on November 3, 2009 in the United States as the album's second single.\n\n\"Say Something\" is an [[electro (music)|electro-rap]] song with a slow moving beat and feel. Lyrically, it portrays an interaction between Graham and a woman and the awkward feel to it, that is influenced by past events that occurred between them. \"Say Something\" garnered generally mixed reviews from music critics; many of them praised it as a \"radio hit\" but felt it fared worse than Drake's previous works and believed it highlighted Timbaland's weaknesses as a vocalist. Since its domestic release, the song has reached number twenty-three on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]], standing as the second highest charting single from ''Shock Value II'' in the United States. The music video for the song was directed by [[Paul \"Coy\" Allen]] features appearances from [[Sebastian (rapper)|Sebastian]], D.O.E., Attitude and DJ Freestyle Steve.\n\n==Background and composition==\n[[File:Jay-Z 2011.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Timbaland cites Jay-Z as a reason to why the collaboration with Drake came to fruition.]]\"Say Something\" was written by Timothy Mosley, [[Jerome Harmon]], [[Drake (rapper)|Aubrey Graham]], Timothy Clayton and John Maultsby. The production of the song was helmed by Mosley under his stage-name Timbaland and by Harmon under his stage-name Jroc; the latter is credited as the co-producer. The pairing of Timbaland and Drake came about through a discussion between Mosley and [[Jay-Z]]. In an interview with Shaheem Reed of [[MTV News]], Mosley quoted him saying \"'Yo, man, you gonna wanna get in the studio with this guy named Drake. I'm telling you. He's the next cat.'\"<ref name=reed>{{cite web|last=Reed|first=Shaheem|title=Timbaland Says Jay-Z Put Him Up On Drake|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1630176/timbaland-jay-z-put-him-up-on-drake.jhtml|work=[[MTV]]|publisher=[[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] International Inc.|accessdate=11 May 2012|date=January 21, 2010}}</ref> Mosley, Graham, and Harmon have collaborated on \"Off That\", featured on Jay-Z's eleventh studio album ''[[The Blueprint 3]]'' (2009).<ref name=reed /> Timbaland stated that he was attracted to Drake because of his tone, saying \"His tone is ridiculous right now.

They may have treated me a way in the past, and it's like, 'Damn. I shouldn't have done that.' It's so many things running through my head. 'How do I approach this person now?'\".<ref name=reed /> He later expressed his satisfaction with record, stating: \" It's an interesting concept. I'm glad that record is picking up.

In 2007, in order to adopt the new common map like the rest of the Eurozone countries, Austria changed the common side of its coins.\n\nBefore adopting the Euro in 2002 Austria had maintained use of the [[Austrian schilling]] which was first established in December 1924. The Schilling was abolished in the wake of the [[Anschluss]] in 1938 and has been reintroduced after the end of the [[World War II]] in November 1945.\n\nAustria has one of the richest collection of collectors' coins in the Eurozone, with face value ranging from 10 to 100 euro (although a 100,000 euro coin was exceptionally minted in 2004). These coins are a legacy of an old national practice of minting of silver and gold coins. Unlike normal issues, these coins are not [[legal tender]] in all the eurozone. For instance, a \u20ac5 Austrian commemorative coin cannot be used in any other country.\n\n==Privatisation, state participation and labour movements==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}\nMany of the country's largest firms were nationalised in the early post-war period to protect them from [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] takeover as [[war reparations]]. For many years, the government and its state-owned industries conglomerate played a very important role in the Austrian economy. However, starting in the early 1990s, the group was broken apart, state-owned firms started to operate largely as private businesses, and a great number of these firms were wholly or partially privatised. Although the government's privatisation work in past years has been very successful, it still operates some firms, state monopolies, utilities, and services. The new government has presented an ambitious privatisation programme, which, if implemented, will considerably reduce government participation in the economy. Austria enjoys well-developed industry, banking, transportation, services, and commercial facilities.\n\nAustria has a strong [[labour movement]]. The [[Austrian Trade Union Federation]] (\u00d6GB) comprises constituent unions with a total membership of about 1.5 million\u2014more than half the country's wage and salary earners. Since 1945, the \u00d6GB has pursued a moderate, consensus-oriented wage policy, cooperating with industry, agriculture, and the government on a broad range of social and economic issues in what is known as Austria's \"[[social partnership]]\". The \u00d6GB has often opposed the [[Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel|Sch\u00fcssel]] government's programme for budget consolidation, social reform, and improving the business climate, and indications are rising that Austria's peaceful social climate could become more confrontational.\n\n==Agriculture, industry and services==\n{{Main|Agriculture in Austria|Tourism in Austria}}\n[[File:Schneeberg - cows-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cow]]s near top of mountain [[Schneeberg (Alps)|Schneeberg]]]]\n\nAustrian farms, like those of other west European mountainous countries, are small and fragmented, and production is relatively expensive. Since Austria's becoming a member of the EU in 1995, the Austrian agricultural sector has been undergoing substantial reform under the EU's [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP). Although Austrian farmers provide about 80% of domestic food requirements, the agricultural contribution to [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) has declined since 1950 to less than 3%.\n\nAlthough some industries are global competitors, such as several iron and steel works, chemical plants and oil corporations that are large industrial enterprises employing thousands of people, most industrial and commercial enterprises in Austria are relatively small on an international scale.\n[[File:Kitzb\u00fchel by night.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Kitzb\u00fchel]], one of Austria's famous winter tourist cities]]\nMost important for Austria is the service sector generating the vast majority of Austria's GDP. Vienna has grown into a finance and consulting metropole and has established itself as the door to the East within the last decades. Viennese law firms and banks are among the leading corporations in business with the new EU member states. [[Tourism]] is very important for Austria's economy, accounting for around 10 percent of Austria's GDP.<ref>{{cite web | title = Trade and Industry in Austria, Exports, Tourism | url = http://www.austria.info/xxl/_site/uk/_area/417080/_subArea/417098/home.html | publisher = austria.info | year = 2007 | accessdate =20 December 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071127125951/http://www.austria.info/xxl/_site/uk/_area/417080/_subArea/417098/home.html |archivedate = 27 November 2007}}</ref> In 2001, Austria was the tenth most visited country in the world with over 18.2 million tourists. Previously, dependency on German guests made this sector of the Austrian economy very dependent on German economy. However recent developments have brought a change, especially since winter ski resorts such as [[Arlberg]] or [[Kitzb\u00fchel]] are now more and more frequented by Eastern Europeans, Russians and Americans.\n\n== Health care services ==\n{{main|Healthcare in Austria}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2010}}\n\n[[File:Health care cost rise.svg|thumb|right|400px|Austrian health care spending for 1970 to 2007 compared with other nations]]\n\nAustria's health care system was developed alongside other [[Welfare state|social welfare programmes]] by the social democrats in [[Red Vienna|Vienna]] initially.<ref name=health>[http://www.saglik.gov.tr/EN/dosya/2-1008/h/austria.pdf Austria]. European Observatory on Health Care Systems</ref>\n\n==Trade position==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}\n\nTrade with other EU countries accounts for almost 66% of Austrian imports and exports. Expanding trade and investment in the emerging markets of central and eastern Europe is a major element of Austrian economic activity. Trade with these countries accounts for almost 14% of Austrian imports and exports, and Austrian firms have sizable investments in and continue to move labour-intensive, low-tech production to these countries. Although the big investment boom has waned, Austria still has the potential to attract [[European Union|EU]] firms seeking convenient access to these developing markets.\n\n== Mergers and acquisitions ==\n{{See also|List of largest Austrian companies}}\nCompanies and investors from Austria are active in [[mergers and acquisitions]] (M&A). Since 1991, more than 7,183 mergers & acquisitions transactions have been announced with a known total value of 261.6 bil. EUR. In 2017, over 245 deals with a total value of over 12.9 bil.

[[Privatization|privatisation]] has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies. [[Labour movement]]s are particularly strong in Austria and have large influence on labour politics. Next to a highly developed industry, international tourism is the most important part of the national economy.\n\n[[Germany]] has historically been the main trading partner of Austria, making it vulnerable to rapid changes in the [[German economy]]. However, since Austria became a member state of the [[European Union]] it has gained closer ties to other [[European Union]] economies, reducing its economic dependence on Germany. In addition, membership in the EU has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria's access to the single European market and proximity to the aspiring economies of the European Union.

In the soaring 1950s, the rebuilding efforts for Austria lead to an average annual growth rate of more than 5% in real terms and averaged about four-point five percent through most of the 1960s. Following moderate real GDP growth of 1.7%, 2% and 1.2%, respectively, in 1995, 1996, and 1997, the economy rebounded and with real GDP expansion of 2.9 percent in 1998 and 2.2% in 1999.\n\nAustria became a member of the EU on [[1995 enlargement of the European Union|1 January 1995]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austria.org/austria-in-the-eu/|title=Austria in the EU|website=Austrian Embassy Washington|access-date=8 October 2018}}</ref> Membership brought economic benefits and challenges and has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria's access to the single European market. Austria also has made progress in generally increasing its international competitiveness. As a member of the economic and monetary union of the European Union (EMU), Austria's economy is closely integrated with other EU member countries, especially with Germany. On 1 January 1999, Austria introduced the new Euro currency for accounting purposes. In January 2002, Euro notes and coins were introduced, replacing those of the [[Austrian schilling]].\n\n==Currency==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}\n{{Main|Austrian euro coins}}\n{{See also|Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)}}\n[[File:Euro banknotes 2002.png|thumb|In 1999, Austria introduced the single European currency, the [[euro]]. With 18 other EU member states it forms the [[Eurozone]].]]\n\nIn Austria, Euros appear as 1999, however all Austrian euro coins introduced in 2002 have this year on it; unlike other countries of the [[Eurozone]] where mint year is minted in the coin. Eight different designs, one per face value, were selected for the Austrian coins. In 2007, in order to adopt the new common map like the rest of the Eurozone countries, Austria changed the common side of its coins.\n\nBefore adopting the Euro in 2002 Austria had maintained use of the [[Austrian schilling]] which was first established in December 1924. The Schilling was abolished in the wake of the [[Anschluss]] in 1938 and has been reintroduced after the end of the [[World War II]] in November 1945.\n\nAustria has one of the richest collection of collectors' coins in the Eurozone, with face value ranging from 10 to 100 euro (although a 100,000 euro coin was exceptionally minted in 2004). These coins are a legacy of an old national practice of minting of silver and gold coins. Unlike normal issues, these coins are not [[legal tender]] in all the eurozone. For instance, a \u20ac5 Austrian commemorative coin cannot be used in any other country.\n\n==Privatisation, state participation and labour movements==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}\nMany of the country's largest firms were nationalised in the early post-war period to protect them from [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] takeover as [[war reparations]]. For many years, the government and its state-owned industries conglomerate played a very important role in the Austrian economy. However, starting in the early 1990s, the group was broken apart, state-owned firms started to operate largely as private businesses, and a great number of these firms were wholly or partially privatised. Although the government's privatisation work in past years has been very successful, it still operates some firms, state monopolies, utilities, and services. The new government has presented an ambitious privatisation programme, which, if implemented, will considerably reduce government participation in the economy. Austria enjoys well-developed industry, banking, transportation, services, and commercial facilities.\n\nAustria has a strong [[labour movement]]. The [[Austrian Trade Union Federation]] (\u00d6GB) comprises constituent unions with a total membership of about 1.5 million\u2014more than half the country's wage and salary earners. Since 1945, the \u00d6GB has pursued a moderate, consensus-oriented wage policy, cooperating with industry, agriculture, and the government on a broad range of social and economic issues in what is known as Austria's \"[[social partnership]]\". The \u00d6GB has often opposed the [[Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel|Sch\u00fcssel]] government's programme for budget consolidation, social reform, and improving the business climate, and indications are rising that Austria's peaceful social climate could become more confrontational.\n\n==Agriculture, industry and services==\n{{Main|Agriculture in Austria|Tourism in Austria}}\n[[File:Schneeberg - cows-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cow]]s near top of mountain [[Schneeberg (Alps)|Schneeberg]]]]\n\nAustrian farms, like those of other west European mountainous countries, are small and fragmented, and production is relatively expensive. Since Austria's becoming a member of the EU in 1995, the Austrian agricultural sector has been undergoing substantial reform under the EU's [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP). Although Austrian farmers provide about 80% of domestic food requirements, the agricultural contribution to [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) has declined since 1950 to less than 3%.\n\nAlthough some industries are global competitors, such as several iron and steel works, chemical plants and oil corporations that are large industrial enterprises employing thousands of people, most industrial and commercial enterprises in Austria are relatively small on an international scale.\n[[File:Kitzb\u00fchel by night.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Kitzb\u00fchel]], one of Austria's famous winter tourist cities]]\nMost important for Austria is the service sector generating the vast majority of Austria's GDP. Vienna has grown into a finance and consulting metropole and has established itself as the door to the East within the last decades. Viennese law firms and banks are among the leading corporations in business with the new EU member states. [[Tourism]] is very important for Austria's economy, accounting for around 10 percent of Austria's GDP.<ref>{{cite web | title = Trade and Industry in Austria, Exports, Tourism | url = http://www.austria.info/xxl/_site/uk/_area/417080/_subArea/417098/home.html | publisher = austria.info | year = 2007 | accessdate =20 December 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071127125951/http://www.austria.info/xxl/_site/uk/_area/417080/_subArea/417098/home.html |archivedate = 27 November 2007}}</ref> In 2001, Austria was the tenth most visited country in the world with over 18.2 million tourists. Previously, dependency on German guests made this sector of the Austrian economy very dependent on German economy. However recent developments have brought a change, especially since winter ski resorts such as [[Arlberg]] or [[Kitzb\u00fchel]] are now more and more frequented by Eastern Europeans, Russians and Americans.\n\n== Health care services ==\n{{main|Healthcare in Austria}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2010}}\n\n[[File:Health care cost rise.svg|thumb|right|400px|Austrian health care spending for 1970 to 2007 compared with other nations]]\n\nAustria's health care system was developed alongside other [[Welfare state|social welfare programmes]] by the social democrats in [[Red Vienna|Vienna]] initially.<ref name=health>[http://www.saglik.gov.tr/EN/dosya/2-1008/h/austria.pdf Austria]. European Observatory on Health Care Systems</ref>\n\n==Trade position==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}\n\nTrade with other EU countries accounts for almost 66% of Austrian imports and exports. Expanding trade and investment in the emerging markets of central and eastern Europe is a major element of Austrian economic activity. Trade with these countries accounts for almost 14% of Austrian imports and exports, and Austrian firms have sizable investments in and continue to move labour-intensive, low-tech production to these countries. Although the big investment boom has waned, Austria still has the potential to attract [[European Union|EU]] firms seeking convenient access to these developing markets.\n\n== Mergers and acquisitions ==\n{{See also|List of largest Austrian companies}}\nCompanies and investors from Austria are active in [[mergers and acquisitions]] (M&A). Since 1991, more than 7,183 mergers & acquisitions transactions have been announced with a known total value of 261.6 bil. EUR. In 2017, over 245 deals with a total value of over 12.9 bil.

From the fifth century BCE and onwards Mongoloid peoples settled in the area and soon began to blend with the prior populations. The region was then conquered or became within the sphere of influence of the [[Xiongnu]], the [[Rouran Khaganate]], the [[Turkic Khaganate|Turkic Khanganate]], the [[Uyghur Empire]], and the [[Yenisei Kyrgyz Khaganate|Yensei Kyrgyz]]. During these time periods the area's local people became Turkicized culturally and linguistically.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the World's Minorities|last=|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=1-57958-468-3|editor-last=Skutsch|editor-first=Carl|volume=1|location=New York|pages=82}}</ref>\n\nFrom the thirteenth to eighteenth century the Altai people were dominated politically and culturally by the Mongols. The origin of the southern Altaians can be traced during this period from the result of the mixing of [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]] and Mongol tribes. Meanwhile, the northern Altaians were a result of the fusion of Turkic tribes with [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyeds]], [[Ket people|Kets]], and other Siberian groups.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Altaians were annexed by the [[Four Oirat]] of Western Mongols in the 16th century.

This represented 34.5% of the total population of the republic, compared with 56.6% with a Russian background, Altaian families are the majority only in certain villages. However, Altaian culture is still the local culture between people and communities.\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Traditional lifestyle ===\nThe Southern Altaians were mostly nomadic or semi-nomadic livestock holders. They raised horses, goats, sheep, and cattle. The Northern Altaians mainly engaged in hunting as their primary form of subsistence. Their main prey were animals from the [[taiga]] (boreal forests). However, some Altaians also engaged in small-scale agriculture, gathering, and fishing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Dwellings ===\nMost of the Southern Altaians traditionally lived in yurts. Many Northern Altaians mainly built polygonal yurts with conic roofs made out of logs and bark. Some Altai-Kizhi also lived in mud huts with birch bark gable roofs and log or plank walling. The Teleuts and a few Northern Altaians lived in conic homes made out of perches or bark. With the influx of Russians near the homeland of the Altaians, there was an increase of the construction of large huts with two to four slope roofs in consequence of Russian influence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDespite the many social and political changes the Altaians have endured, many modern and settled families still keep a yurt in their yards. These yurts are usually used as a summertime kitchen or extra room.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Clothing ===\nThe traditional clothing of Southern Altaian men and women are very similar with little differences between the two. Average clothing consisted of long shirts with wide breeches, oriental robes, and sleeves. Other apparel often included fur hats, high boots, and sheepskin coats. Northern Altaians and some Teleuts traditionally wore short breeches, linen shirts, and single-breasted oriental robes. Despite the fact that most Altaians today wear modern clothes, traditional wear still remains in use.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Encyclopedia of the World's Minorities|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=1-57958-468-3|editor-last=Skutsch|editor-first=Carl|location=New York|pages=81-83}}</ref>\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nAltaian cuisine consists of soups of horseflesh or mutton.

Popular drinks include ''aryki'' (milk vodka).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Religion ==\n\n=== History ===\nTraditional Altaian shamanism is rich with mythology and supernatural beings. Popular deities included Yerlik, the god of the underworld and Oyrot-Khan, a sagely and heroic figure who is a composite blend taken from historical Zungarian (Oirat) Khans and ancient legendary heroes. However, with many migrations, settlement changes, and the presence of the Russians and their eventual union with the [[Russian Empire]], the Altaians encountered three world religions: Islam, Buddhism, and Christianity. At first, the Altaians were indifferent and at times even hostile to these faiths and their expansion. In 1829, a Orthodox mission was founded in the region (modern Altai Republic) as part of it being a protectorate of the Russian Empire.<ref name=\":1\" /> Many Altaians were forcefully converted to Christianity.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oZCOAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA11&dq=aynu+people&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=3#v=onepage&q=aynu%20people&f=false|title=Ethnic Groups of North, East, and Central Asia: An Encyclopedia|last=Minahan|first=James B.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2014|isbn=9781610690188|location=|pages=11-13}}</ref>\n\nThe mission and its missionaries were initially culturally sensitive and tolerant to the Altaians and their customs. However, the rise of Russian nationalism during the late nineteenth century caused the Russification of Orthodox Christianity and the mostly Russian clergy in Siberia also took up the ideology. This created intolerant views of the natives of Siberia (including the Altaians) and of their culture. This led to the rejection of Christianity by many Altaians who saw it as a foreign Russian religion. However, Russian rule continued to grow increasingly strict both politically and religiously.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAround 1904, the development of [[Burkhanism]] among the Altaians was underway. [[Burkhanism]] is a monotheistic religion named after Ak-Burkhan, a deity who is believed and recognized by adherents to have been the sole god. Burkhanism was opposed to both the Russians and the traditional shamans. The hostility towards the shamans was so great that the shamans had to seek protection from Russian authorities. The rise of the [[Bolsheviks]] in the first quarter of the twentieth century also led to the brutal repression of all religions which included the faiths in the Altai region. For the next few decades, most religions basically vanished with only shamanistic and ancient polytheistic beliefs surviving the chaos. This was believed to have occurred because ancient religious beliefs could be easily orally transmitted from generation to another. It's also likely that no Burkhanist texts survived the repression and main sources for the beliefs of the religion come from Russian missionaries, travellers, and scholars.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Modern spirituality ===\nRecently, Burkhanism and shamanism has seen a revival in the Altai region which is especially popular among Altaian youth. At present, the majority of Kumandins, Tubalars, Teleuts, and Chelkans are Russian Orthodox although there is a significant minority that practice shamanism. Shamanism is practiced by many Telengits though there is a large amount that also profess Orthodox Christianity.
