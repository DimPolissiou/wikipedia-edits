Animation, [[Sam Register]] (creator of ''[[Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi]]''), along with [[Peter Browngardt|Pete Browngardt]] (the creator of ''[[Secret Mountain Fort Awesome]]'' and ''[[Uncle Grandpa]]''), serve as executive producers for the series.<ref name=\"Annecy\">{{cite web|url=https://www.annecy.org/news:a2481|title=Annecy > News|first=|last=|website=Annecy.org|accessdate=April 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/06/looney-tunes-short-form-revival-warner-bros-animation-1202407762/|title='Looney Tunes' Getting Short-Form Revival At WB Animation|first=Patrick|last=Hipes|date=June 11, 2018|website=Deadline Hollywood|access-date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> The shorts will bring all of the ''Looney Tunes'' together under one roof, including more obscure members like [[Pete Puma]], [[Beaky Buzzard]], [[Hubie and Bertie]], [[Petunia Pig]] and Cicero Pig.<ref name=\"oneofus\">{{cite web|url=https://oneofus.net/2019/06/infestation-annecy-animation-festival-2019-the-new-looney-tunes-cartoons/|title=Infestation: Annecy Animation Festival 2019: The New Looney Tunes Cartoons|first=Maciej|last=Kur|work=One of Us|date=June 25, 2019|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Voice cast==\n===Main characters===\n* [[Eric Bauza]] \u2013 [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]], [[Tweety Bird]], [[Pep\u00e9 Le Pew|Pep\u00e9 le Pew]]<ref name=\"polygon.com\">https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/12/18663327/looney-tunes-cartoons-shorts-series-annecy</ref>\n* [[Jeff Bergman]] \u2013 [[Sylvester Cat|Sylvester Pussycat]], [[Elmer Fudd]], [[Foghorn Leghorn]]<ref name=\"polygon.com\"/><ref name=\"bergen\"/>\n* [[Bob Bergen]] \u2013 [[Porky Pig]]<ref name=\"bergen\"/>\n* [[Fred Tatasciore]] \u2013 [[Yosemite Sam]],<ref name=\"bergen\"/> [[Tasmanian Devil (Looney Tunes)|Taz Devil]]<ref>{{Citation|title=WB Studio Tour group meets Looney Tunes Voice Actors|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uXiin5iXmo|language=en|access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref>\n* Michael Ruocco \u2013 [[Beaky Buzzard]]<ref>https://mobile.twitter.com/AGuyWhoDraws/status/1139288880409190402</ref>\n\n===Supporting Characters===\n* Eric Bauza \u2013 [[Marvin the Martian]]<ref name=\"bergen\">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BobBergen/status/1053439590957105152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1053439590957105152&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fs9e.github.io%2Fiframe%2F2%2Ftwitter.min.html%231053439590957105152|title=Bob Bergen confirming voice actors|first=Bob|last=Bergen|work=Twitter|date=October 19, 2018|accessdate=July 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Characters whose voice actors have not been announced===\n* TBA \u2013 [[Cecil Turtle]]<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AGuyWhoDraws/status/1115368869793681408?s=20|title=Our crew shirts came in! #looneytunescartoonspic.twitter.com/wStYMr03dZ|last=Ruocco|first=Michael|date=2019-04-08|website=@AGuyWhoDraws|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n* TBA \u2013 [[Hubie and Bertie|Hubie]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* TBA \u2013 [[Hubie and Bertie|Bertie]]<ref name=\":0\" />\n* TBA \u2013 The Gremlin<ref name=\":0\" />\n* TBA \u2013 [[Wile E.

McMahon returned for a guest appearance in the show's seventh season, for its 150th episode. ''Charmed'' is a series which focuses on three good witches, the prophesied \"Charmed Ones\", sisters who battle the forces of evil. Cole is an adversary-turned-ally of the sisters introduced in the third season and a love interest of main character [[Phoebe Halliwell]], portrayed by [[Alyssa Milano]]. Like the show's main characters, Cole also possessed a number of magical abilities; the most commonly used were the power to teleport and the power to throw projective energy balls which could stun or kill.\n\nWithin the series' narrative, Cole is a Cambion, half-human and half-demon by birth and blood, and better known to the demonic world for over a hundred years as the legendary demonic assassin '''Belthazor'''. Cole is dispatched by [[The Source (Charmed)|the Source of all Evil]] to kill the Charmed Ones only to fall in love with then-youngest sister Phoebe Halliwell, renounce evil and become a close ally of the Charmed Ones. Though Cole eventually completely rids himself of his demonic nature, and marries Phoebe in the fourth season, he never gains the trust of new youngest sister [[Paige Matthews|Paige]] ([[Rose McGowan]]).\n\nAs part of his storyline, the character later returns to evil after unwillingly becoming the new Source. As the Source, Cole is eventually vanquished by the Charmed Ones, only to come back from death itself in his attempts to win Phoebe back. By this point, he is one of the most powerful beings to ever exist. Driven insane, Cole is, through his own doing, once again killed by the sisters in the fifth season. When the character returns for a guest appearance in the seventh season, it is unclear what kind of being he is, but he states that he is caught somewhere between life and death, atoning for his sins.\n\n==Character arc==\n===Season three (2000\u201301)===\nCole Turner makes his first appearance in the [[Charmed (season 3)|third-season]] (2000\u201301) premiere episode, \"The Honeymoon's Over\". Charmed Ones [[Phoebe Halliwell|Phoebe]] ([[Alyssa Milano]]) and [[Prue Halliwell|Prue]] ([[Shannen Doherty]]) run into Assistant [[District Attorney]] Cole Turner at the site where they killed a demon, and cover their tracks. Over the course of the episode, it becomes apparent to the audience that Cole is himself a very powerful demon, pursuing Phoebe romantically and deceiving the sisters as to his true nature in order to finally kill them.\n\nIn \"Power Outage\", Cole's superiors, the demonic [[Triad (Charmed)|Triad]], learn that he may have developed genuine romantic feelings for Phoebe; Cole responds by killing them, forcing him into hiding. Meanwhile, the sisters acquire a target in the red-and-black-skinned demon [[Belthazor]] ([[Michael Bailey Smith]]).  In \"Sleuthing with the Enemy\", the Charmed Ones discovers Cole and Belthazor are one and the same, but when Cole convinces Phoebe that he, being half human, truly loves her, she fakes his death so that her sisters [[Piper Halliwell|Piper]] ([[Holly Marie Combs]]) and Prue will not hunt for him.\n\nWhen Cole re-emerges, causing a rift between Phoebe and her sisters, he attempts to re-ingratiate himself with his demonic peers, the Brotherhood of the Thorn, as the sisters' [[double agent]]. When Prue and Piper are both killed following a successful mission by the Source's assassin [[Shax (Charmed)|Shax]] (Michael Bailey Smith) in the season finale \"All Hell Breaks Loose\", Cole begs the Source (again, Michael Bailey Smith) to turn back time and prevent the exposure of magic. The Source agrees on the condition that Phoebe remain in the Underworld under his command, though he secretly orders her to be killed. Shax attacks the Halliwell Manor once more after time is reversed, but this time [[Leo Wyatt|Leo]] ([[Brian Krause]]), Piper's husband who is also the sisters' guardian angel ([[whitelighter]]) is not available to heal either Piper or Prue, who lie gravely wounded. Phones and Cole had lots of sex. By that being said they conceived a child but the child turn evil.\n\n===Season four (2001\u201302)===\nThe [[Charmed (season 4)|season four]] premiere \"Charmed Again\" reveals Leo arrived in time to heal Piper, but Prue died of her injuries, reflecting Doherty's departure from the series. Leo assisted Phoebe to escape the Underworld, absconding on the Source's deal. With Prue dead, the sisters are no longer the Charmed Ones, and Cole does what he can to assist Phoebe and Piper from Shax's continued attacks. Piper and Phoebe regain their full abilities&mdash;becoming Charmed Ones once again&mdash;when they discover their younger half-sister, [[Paige Matthews]] ([[Rose McGowan]]), alongside whom they finally destroy Shax.\n\nIn \"Black as Cole\", Cole proposes to Phoebe whilst they vanquish a low level demon. Later they find that Sykes has been mimicking Belthazor and in a bid to vanquish him Cole takes on his demonic form but has Phoebe create a potion to kill his demonic half if he can not change back. Before he can change back, a woman looking to revenge his killing of her love picks up the potion and throws it at him, causing Belthazor to die.  In \"Lost and Bound\", Paige gets Cole a job as a legal aid lawyer. However he can't control his emotions and soon quits but not before the landlord who he was arguing with agrees to put the heating back on.\n\nIn \"Charmed and Dangerous\", the Source ([[Peter Woodward]]) breaks an aged old agreement and consumes the hollow. The Seer ([[Debbi Morgan]]) tricks Cole into consuming the hollow which allows him to assist the Charmed Ones in vanquishing the physical version of the Source. It is revealed that the Seer tricked Cole into absorbing the old Source's power, eventually causing him to become the new Source of Evil in \"The Three Faces of Phoebe\". An older version of Phoebe has turned bitter because of what he has done and warns her to save herself and states that they never got married but she can't help but think what might have been. Present-day Phoebe asks him if he is hiding anything; he says he is not.\n\nThe Source takes over Cole completely in \"Marry-Go-Round\".  The Seer warns him that marrying Phoebe would be the worst thing possible as they would have a son, the most powerful magical creature ever, who would be on the side of good, following the Charmed Ones' destiny. She tells him the only way the child will grow up evil is if Cole marries Phoebe in a dark ceremony. As the Source, he puts a spell on the Charmed Ones which makes Phoebe spotty and Piper and Paige over sleep. Paige and Phoebe argue as the latter suspects the former of trying to disrupt the wedding, having already made a mistake with the dress. When Paige tries to make an amends with Phoebe's spots it causes her to become invisible.\n\nSuspecting evil magic to be involved, the sisters try and reverse it without success but pass the invisibility on to Paige. Cole asks the Seer to send a Lazarus demon (who she summoned to lure Phoebe to a cemetery for the purposes of a dark ceremony) to attack at the wedding which causes Phoebe to call it off, thus reversing the magic on her, which had been switched to Paige. When the Charmed Ones question the demon, he accuses Cole of betraying him and tells them that he sent him to attack them. But before he can out Cole as the Source, Cole vanquishes him and pretends to be the Seer before teleporting and pretending to be unconscious after she attacked him. Cole marries Phoebe in a dark wedding at the end of the episode, without her suspecting drinking her blood when a throne pricks her with the ceremony held at night with a dark priest.\n\nCole pretends to be the perfect husband by sending Leo and Piper on honeymoon to Hawaii and buying expensive gifts such as a new car in \"The Fifth Halliwheel\". Paige begins to suspect that Cole is a demon again especially when she catches Cole using powers on an innocent but is not sure of what she has seen. Cole as Leo calms Paige's fears before sending the power broker demon who had already gone after the innocent after her. The Seer also puts in a plan to make Phoebe pregnant using the full moon and a tonic. The Seer and Cole create a tonic which will ensure that the child is evil. From taking the tonic, the child will take over Phoebe's body and ensure that she remains by his side when she finds out that he is the Source. Phoebe eventually takes the tonic laced with chocolate to make the plan work.\n\nIn \"Bite Me\" different factions have tried to become ruler of the Underworld so Cole tries to make them all work together to beat good. However one of the leaders encourages a group of vampires to rise up and rebel, which they do so after Cole refuses to listen to them. He almost gets exposed by Paige when she orbs in his home but he quickly covers this up by saying he has a migraine, hence why the blinds were down. The vampires try to turn Paige into one to get the other sisters and then overthrow the Source and become the new leaders. To keep himself on top, Cole kills the Queen after Phoebe and Piper inadvertently tell him what to do. Phoebe later discovers that she is pregnant before informing him in \"We're Off to See the Wizard.\"\n\nCole tries to give up the Source to the Wizard after his human side becomes strong and Phoebe learns through a premonition that he is a demon again.  But before the ritual is complete, the Seer, who has manipulated Phoebe, interrupts and vanquishes the Wizard. Cole is crowned the new Source with Phoebe as his Queen. Cole faces a coup in \"Long Live the Queen\" when Phoebe stops the killing of an innocent. Cole demands she make a choice.  Phoebe later learns from the Seer and Cole  that the tonic they were giving her was turning her evil. Phoebe eventually sides with her sisters and before Cole can destroy them she traps him in a crystal cage which allows the Charmed Ones to vanquish him.\n\nIn the season finale \"Witch Way Now?\", Phoebe discovers Cole is able to linger in the Demonic Wasteland, where vanquished demons go, because of his human soul. Phoebe visits him there, insisting to him that he move on to his afterlife. After she leaves, he accidentally discovers he can acquire the powers of other demons vanquished there. He becomes powerful enough to kill the beast that consumes the essence of those vanquished there and, finally, to escape. Once back in the real world, he saves the sisters' lives from a witch hunter.\n\n===Season five (2002\u201303) and other appearances===\nIn the [[Charmed (season 5)|season-five]] premiere \"A Witch's Tail\", Cole returns with numerous new abilities, making him more powerful than ever. Though he still loves Phoebe, she wants to move on from him and is frustrated by his attempts to win her back. In \"Siren Song,\" he saves the life of a young future whitelighter named Melissa in a failed attempt to impress Phoebe. When he tries to confront the demonic Siren the sisters are pursuing, the Siren puts him under her control. Under this influence, he tries to strangle Phoebe to death before the Siren is ultimately vanquished, and Phoebe nearly dies. As a result, Cole finally understands the threat he poses to Phoebe and promises to stop using his powers, but succumbs to temptation and kills again when confronted by a sleazy landlord.\n\nIn \"Sympathy for the Demon\", Cole is taunted by the spirit of the demon [[Barbas (Charmed)|Barbas]] ([[Billy Drago]]), who convinces him to use a power-stripping potion, inadvertently granting Barbas his powers and a corporeal form. To stop the threat of Barbas or anyone else possessing Cole's powers, Paige strips Barbas of Cole's powers and Cole takes them back. The sisters, however, fear that these abilities will make him evil again. In \"Sam, I Am\", Cole misuses his abilities and incinerates two robbers/murderers, and is later visited by two mysterious beings who identify themselves as [[Avatars (Charmed)|Avatars]]. Neither good or evil, the Avatars offer Cole the opportunity to join their ranks and enjoy their powers; he refuses.\n\nInstead, Cole tries to [[death by cop|provoke the sisters to kill him]] by sending an assassin after them, knowing that they will be able to recover thanks to their recent contact with Paige's father, whitelighter Sam Wilder ([[Scott Jaeck]]). He is distraught to learn he cannot be killed, and is pushed over the edge into insanity. Cole reverts to malevolent means of winning Phoebe back, striking at the Charmed Ones in various underhand ways over several episodes.  In ''Charmed''{{'}}s 100th episode \"Centennial Charmed\", Cole accepts the Avatars' offer and uses their powers to create an alternate reality where Piper and Phoebe never met Paige, who was instead killed by the Source before the Elders discovered her. In the new reality, Cole is once again Belthazor and no longer indestructible. He acts as the right-hand man of the Source and owns Halliwell Manor with Phoebe, but they are unhappy together. Paige however is accidentally brought along from the real world and teams up with Piper and Leo to destroy Cole. After convincing Phoebe to join their side, the Charmed Ones vanquish Cole for good.\n\nCole makes a guest appearance in the 150th episode, \"The Seven Year Witch\", in [[Charmed (season 7)|season seven]]; Piper's disembodied spirit receives advice from Cole, who claims to be in limbo atoning for his sins. However, it is later revealed that Cole, watching over the sisters, orchestrated Piper's illness and sent Phoebe's short-lived boyfriend Drake ([[Billy Zane]]) to her, all so that Phoebe could learn to believe in love again. However he also did this to get Piper and Leo back together so that they could be a beacon for Phoebe not to give up on love and turn into the bitter old woman as seen in \"The Three Faces of Phoebe\". In 2010, Cole returned in the ''[[Charmed (comics)|Charmed Season 9]]'' comic book series. This time he has a minor role and only supporting in the spirit realm with Prue.\n\n==Analysis==\nAs a lawyer and a demon, one writer notes that Cole is part of the same \"corporate\" metaphor as the [[List of Angel characters#Wolfram & Hart|Wolfram & Hart]] firm in the television series ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Vampires: myths and metaphors of enduring evil|last=Day|first=Peter|chapter=Piercing the corporate veil|year=2006|publisher=Editions Rodopi B.V.|isbn=978-90-420-1669-9}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nThe erotic romance novels and novellas of Jennifer Dunne feature a heroine \"obsessed\" with Julian McMahon's portrayal of Cole in her book Dancing in the Dark.<ref>{{cite book|title=Totally Charmed: Demons, Whitelighters and the Power of Three|chapter=Will the Real Phoebe Please Stand up|last=Dunne|editor=Jennifer Crusie|first=Jennifer|year=2005|isbn=978-1-932100-60-0|publisher=BenBella Books}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Charmed}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Turner, Cole}}\n[[Category:Charmed (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\n[[Category:Fictional avatars]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can teleport]]\n[[Category:Fictional half-demons]]\n[[Category:Fictional lawyers]]\n[[Category:Fictional shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 2000]]\n[[Category:Fictional attempted suicides]]\n\n[[da:Phoebes K\u00e6rester#Cole Turner]]\n[[ru:\u0421\u043f\u0438\u0441\u043e\u043a \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0436\u0435\u0439 \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u00ab\u0417\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435\u00bb#\u041a\u043e\u0443\u043b \u0422\u0451\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0440]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=July 2019}}\n{{Infobox character\n| name        = Cole Turner\n| alias       = Belthazor and The Source of All Evil\n| occupation = Lawyer\n| series      = Charmed\n| color       = #3F2100\n| image       = [[File:Cole turner.jpg|200px|alt=An upper body shot of a handsome man with dark, curly hair wearing red shirt open at the top, black jacket with no tie]]\n| caption     = [[Julian McMahon]] as Cole Turner\n| first       = \"[[The Honeymoon's Over (Charmed)|The Honeymoon's Over]]\" (3.01)<br>October 5, 2000<br>\n| last        = \"[[Centennial Charmed]]\" (5.12)<br>January 13, 2003<br>(as series regular)<br>\"[[The Seven Year Witch]]\" (7.16)<br>April 10, 2005<br>(as guest star)\n| creator     = Brad Kern\n| portrayer   = [[Julian McMahon]] (human form)<br>[[Michael Bailey Smith]] (demon form)\n| species     = [[Cambion]]; half-Human, half-Demon\n| spouse       = [[Phoebe Halliwell]]<br> (ex-wife)\n| family      = Benjamin Coleridge Turner <br />(father; deceased)<br />Elizabeth Turner <br />(mother; deceased)<br />[[Penny Halliwell|Penny 'Grams' Halliwell]]<br>(ex-grandmother-in-law; deceased)<br>Allen Halliwell<br>(ex-grandfather-in-law; deceased)<br>[[Patricia Halliwell|Patricia 'Patty' Halliwell]] <br> (ex-mother-in-law; deceased)<br>[[Victor Bennett]]<br> (ex-father-in-law)<br> [[Prue Halliwell]]<br> (ex-sister-in-law; deceased)<br>[[Piper Halliwell]]<br> (ex-sister-in-law)<br>[[Paige Matthews]] <br> (ex-sister-in-law)<br>[[Leo Wyatt]]<br> (ex-brother-in-law)\n}}\n'''Cole Turner''' is a [[fictional character]] on the [[The WB Television Network|WB]] [[Television program|television series]] ''[[Charmed]]'', portrayed by series regular [[Julian McMahon]] between seasons three and five. McMahon returned for a guest appearance in the show's seventh season, for its 150th episode. ''Charmed'' is a series which focuses on three good witches, the prophesied \"Charmed Ones\", sisters who battle the forces of evil. Cole is an adversary-turned-ally of the sisters introduced in the third season and a love interest of main character [[Phoebe Halliwell]], portrayed by [[Alyssa Milano]]. Like the show's main characters, Cole also possessed a number of magical abilities; the most commonly used were the power to teleport and the power to throw projective energy balls which could stun or kill.\n\nWithin the series' narrative, Cole is a Cambion, half-human and half-demon by birth and blood, and better known to the demonic world for over a hundred years as the legendary demonic assassin '''Belthazor'''. Cole is dispatched by [[The Source (Charmed)|the Source of all Evil]] to kill the Charmed Ones only to fall in love with then-youngest sister Phoebe Halliwell, renounce evil and become a close ally of the Charmed Ones. Though Cole eventually completely rids himself of his demonic nature, and marries Phoebe in the fourth season, he never gains the trust of new youngest sister [[Paige Matthews|Paige]] ([[Rose McGowan]]).\n\nAs part of his storyline, the character later returns to evil after unwillingly becoming the new Source. As the Source, Cole is eventually vanquished by the Charmed Ones, only to come back from death itself in his attempts to win Phoebe back. By this point, he is one of the most powerful beings to ever exist. Driven insane, Cole is, through his own doing, once again killed by the sisters in the fifth season. When the character returns for a guest appearance in the seventh season, it is unclear what kind of being he is, but he states that he is caught somewhere between life and death, atoning for his sins.\n\n==Character arc==\n===Season three (2000\u201301)===\nCole Turner makes his first appearance in the [[Charmed (season 3)|third-season]] (2000\u201301) premiere episode, \"The Honeymoon's Over\". Charmed Ones [[Phoebe Halliwell|Phoebe]] ([[Alyssa Milano]]) and [[Prue Halliwell|Prue]] ([[Shannen Doherty]]) run into Assistant [[District Attorney]] Cole Turner at the site where they killed a demon, and cover their tracks. Over the course of the episode, it becomes apparent to the audience that Cole is himself a very powerful demon, pursuing Phoebe romantically and deceiving the sisters as to his true nature in order to finally kill them.\n\nIn \"Power Outage\", Cole's superiors, the demonic [[Triad (Charmed)|Triad]], learn that he may have developed genuine romantic feelings for Phoebe; Cole responds by killing them, forcing him into hiding. Meanwhile, the sisters acquire a target in the red-and-black-skinned demon [[Belthazor]] ([[Michael Bailey Smith]]).  In \"Sleuthing with the Enemy\", the Charmed Ones discovers Cole and Belthazor are one and the same, but when Cole convinces Phoebe that he, being half human, truly loves her, she fakes his death so that her sisters [[Piper Halliwell|Piper]] ([[Holly Marie Combs]]) and Prue will not hunt for him.\n\nWhen Cole re-emerges, causing a rift between Phoebe and her sisters, he attempts to re-ingratiate himself with his demonic peers, the Brotherhood of the Thorn, as the sisters' [[double agent]]. When Prue and Piper are both killed following a successful mission by the Source's assassin [[Shax (Charmed)|Shax]] (Michael Bailey Smith) in the season finale \"All Hell Breaks Loose\", Cole begs the Source (again, Michael Bailey Smith) to turn back time and prevent the exposure of magic. The Source agrees on the condition that Phoebe remain in the Underworld under his command, though he secretly orders her to be killed. Shax attacks the Halliwell Manor once more after time is reversed, but this time [[Leo Wyatt|Leo]] ([[Brian Krause]]), Piper's husband who is also the sisters' guardian angel ([[whitelighter]]) is not available to heal either Piper or Prue, who lie gravely wounded.\n\n===Season four (2001\u201302)===\nThe [[Charmed (season 4)|season four]] premiere \"Charmed Again\" reveals Leo arrived in time to heal Piper, but Prue died of her injuries, reflecting Doherty's departure from the series. Leo assisted Phoebe to escape the Underworld, absconding on the Source's deal. With Prue dead, the sisters are no longer the Charmed Ones, and Cole does what he can to assist Phoebe and Piper from Shax's continued attacks. Piper and Phoebe regain their full abilities&mdash;becoming Charmed Ones once again&mdash;when they discover their younger half-sister, [[Paige Matthews]] ([[Rose McGowan]]), alongside whom they finally destroy Shax.\n\nIn \"Black as Cole\", Cole proposes to Phoebe whilst they vanquish a low level demon. Later they find that Sykes has been mimicking Belthazor and in a bid to vanquish him Cole takes on his demonic form but has Phoebe create a potion to kill his demonic half if he can not change back. Before he can change back, a woman looking to revenge his killing of her love picks up the potion and throws it at him, causing Belthazor to die.  In \"Lost and Bound\", Paige gets Cole a job as a legal aid lawyer. However he can't control his emotions and soon quits but not before the landlord who he was arguing with agrees to put the heating back on.\n\nIn \"Charmed and Dangerous\", the Source ([[Peter Woodward]]) breaks an aged old agreement and consumes the hollow. The Seer ([[Debbi Morgan]]) tricks Cole into consuming the hollow which allows him to assist the Charmed Ones in vanquishing the physical version of the Source. It is revealed that the Seer tricked Cole into absorbing the old Source's power, eventually causing him to become the new Source of Evil in \"The Three Faces of Phoebe\". An older version of Phoebe has turned bitter because of what he has done and warns her to save herself and states that they never got married but she can't help but think what might have been. Present-day Phoebe asks him if he is hiding anything; he says he is not.\n\nThe Source takes over Cole completely in \"Marry-Go-Round\".  The Seer warns him that marrying Phoebe would be the worst thing possible as they would have a son, the most powerful magical creature ever, who would be on the side of good, following the Charmed Ones' destiny. She tells him the only way the child will grow up evil is if Cole marries Phoebe in a dark ceremony. As the Source, he puts a spell on the Charmed Ones which makes Phoebe spotty and Piper and Paige over sleep. Paige and Phoebe argue as the latter suspects the former of trying to disrupt the wedding, having already made a mistake with the dress. When Paige tries to make an amends with Phoebe's spots it causes her to become invisible.\n\nSuspecting evil magic to be involved, the sisters try and reverse it without success but pass the invisibility on to Paige. Cole asks the Seer to send a Lazarus demon (who she summoned to lure Phoebe to a cemetery for the purposes of a dark ceremony) to attack at the wedding which causes Phoebe to call it off, thus reversing the magic on her, which had been switched to Paige. When the Charmed Ones question the demon, he accuses Cole of betraying him and tells them that he sent him to attack them. But before he can out Cole as the Source, Cole vanquishes him and pretends to be the Seer before teleporting and pretending to be unconscious after she attacked him. Cole marries Phoebe in a dark wedding at the end of the episode, without her suspecting drinking her blood when a throne pricks her with the ceremony held at night with a dark priest.\n\nCole pretends to be the perfect husband by sending Leo and Piper on honeymoon to Hawaii and buying expensive gifts such as a new car in \"The Fifth Halliwheel\". Paige begins to suspect that Cole is a demon again especially when she catches Cole using powers on an innocent but is not sure of what she has seen. Cole as Leo calms Paige's fears before sending the power broker demon who had already gone after the innocent after her. The Seer also puts in a plan to make Phoebe pregnant using the full moon and a tonic. The Seer and Cole create a tonic which will ensure that the child is evil. From taking the tonic, the child will take over Phoebe's body and ensure that she remains by his side when she finds out that he is the Source. Phoebe eventually takes the tonic laced with chocolate to make the plan work.\n\nIn \"Bite Me\" different factions have tried to become ruler of the Underworld so Cole tries to make them all work together to beat good. However one of the leaders encourages a group of vampires to rise up and rebel, which they do so after Cole refuses to listen to them. He almost gets exposed by Paige when she orbs in his home but he quickly covers this up by saying he has a migraine, hence why the blinds were down. The vampires try to turn Paige into one to get the other sisters and then overthrow the Source and become the new leaders. To keep himself on top, Cole kills the Queen after Phoebe and Piper inadvertently tell him what to do. Phoebe later discovers that she is pregnant before informing him in \"We're Off to See the Wizard.\"\n\nCole tries to give up the Source to the Wizard after his human side becomes strong and Phoebe learns through a premonition that he is a demon again.  But before the ritual is complete, the Seer, who has manipulated Phoebe, interrupts and vanquishes the Wizard. Cole is crowned the new Source with Phoebe as his Queen. Cole faces a coup in \"Long Live the Queen\" when Phoebe stops the killing of an innocent. Cole demands she make a choice.  Phoebe later learns from the Seer and Cole  that the tonic they were giving her was turning her evil. Phoebe eventually sides with her sisters and before Cole can destroy them she traps him in a crystal cage which allows the Charmed Ones to vanquish him.\n\nIn the season finale \"Witch Way Now?\", Phoebe discovers Cole is able to linger in the Demonic Wasteland, where vanquished demons go, because of his human soul.

Though he still loves Phoebe, she wants to move on from him and is frustrated by his attempts to win her back.

Investment in the stock market is most often done via [[stockbroker]]ages and [[electronic trading platform]]s. Investment is usually made with an [[investment strategy]] in mind.\n\nStocks can be categorized by the country where the company is domiciled. For example, [[Nestl\u00e9]] and [[Novartis]] are domiciled in Switzerland and traded on the [[SIX Swiss Exchange]], so they may be considered as part of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] stock market, although the stocks may also be traded on exchanges in other countries, for example, as [[American depository receipt]]s (ADRs) on U.S. stock markets.\n\n==Size of the markets==\nThe total [[market capitalization]] of equity backed securities worldwide rose from $2.5 trillion in 1980 to $68.65 trillion at the end of 2018.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Market capitalization of listed domestic companies (current US$) | url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD | publisher=[[The World Bank]]}}</ref> As of December 31, 2019, the total [[market capitalization]] of all stocks worldwide was approximately US$70.75 trillion.<ref>{{cite web | title=Market capitalization of listed domestic companies (current US$) | url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/cm.mkt.lcap.cd | publisher=[[The World Bank]]}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2016|}}, there are 60 stock exchanges in the world.

Until the early 1600s, a bourse was not exactly a stock exchange in its modern sense. With the founding of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) in 1602 and the rise of Dutch [[capital market]]s in the early 17th century, the 'old' bourse (a place to trade [[Commodity market|commodities]], [[government bond|government]] and [[municipal bond]]s) found a new purpose \u2013 a formal exchange that specialize in creating and sustaining [[secondary market]]s in the [[Security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[corporate bond|bond]]s and [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]]) issued by [[corporation]]s \u2013 or a stock exchange as we know it today.<ref>Neal, Larry (2005). \"Venture Shares of the Dutch East India Company\", in Goetzmann & Rouwenhorst (eds.), Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 165\u2013175</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101773977 |title=Is Asia the next financial center of the world? |publisher=[[CNBC.com]] |last=Murphy |first=Richard McGill |date=1 Jul 2014 |accessdate=11 Mar 2017}}</ref>|group=\"note\"}} where [[stockbroker]]s and [[stock trader|traders]] can buy and sell [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]], [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and other [[security (finance)|securities]]. Many large companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This makes the stock more liquid and thus more attractive to many investors. The exchange may also act as a guarantor of settlement. Other stocks may be traded \"over the counter\" (OTC), that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their stock listed on more than one exchange in different countries, so as to attract international investors.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ibm.com/investor/faq/item/stock-exchanges.wss | title=IBM Investor relations - FAQ &#124; On what stock exchanges is IBM listed ? |publisher=[[IBM]]}}</ref>\n\nStock exchanges may also cover other types of securities, such as fixed interest securities (bonds) or (less frequently) derivatives which are more likely to be traded OTC.\n\nTrade in stock markets means the transfer (in exchange for money) of a stock or security from a seller to a buyer. This requires these two parties to agree on a price. [[Equity (finance)|Equities]] (stocks or shares) confer an ownership interest in a particular company.\n\nParticipants in the stock market range from small individual [[stock investors]] to larger investors, who can be based anywhere in the world, and may include [[bank]]s, [[insurance]] companies, [[pension fund]]s and [[hedge fund]]s. Their buy or sell orders may be executed on their behalf by a stock exchange [[trader (finance)|trader]].\n\nSome exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out on a trading floor, by a method known as [[open outcry]]. This method is used in some stock exchanges and [[commodities exchange]]s, and involves traders shouting bid and offer prices. The other type of stock exchange has a network of computers where trades are made electronically. An example of such an exchange is the [[NASDAQ]].\n\nA potential buyer ''bids'' a specific price for a stock, and a potential seller ''asks'' a specific price for the same stock. Buying or selling ''at the market'' means you will accept ''any'' ask price or bid price for the stock. When the bid and ask prices match, a sale takes place, on a first-come, first-served basis if there are multiple bidders at a given price.\n\nThe purpose of a stock exchange is to facilitate the exchange of securities between buyers and sellers, thus providing a [[marketplace]]. The exchanges provide real-time trading information on the listed securities, facilitating [[price discovery]].\n\nThe [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) is a physical exchange, with a [[hybrid market]] for placing orders electronically from any location as well as on the [[trading floor]]. Orders executed on the trading floor enter by way of exchange members and flow down to a [[floor broker]], who submits the order electronically to the floor trading post for the Designated [[market maker]] (\"DMM\") for that stock to trade the order. The DMM's job is to maintain a two-sided market, making orders to buy and sell the security when there are no other buyers or sellers. If a [[bid\u2013ask spread]] exists, no trade immediately takes place \u2013 in this case the DMM may use their own resources (money or stock) to close the difference. Once a trade has been made, the details are reported on the \"tape\" and sent back to the brokerage firm, which then notifies the investor who placed the order. Computers play an important role, especially for [[program trading]].\n\nThe [[NASDAQ]] is an electronic exchange, where all of the trading is done over a computer network. The process is similar to the New York Stock Exchange. One or more NASDAQ [[market maker]]s will always provide a bid and ask price at which they will always purchase or sell 'their' stock.\n\nThe [[Paris Bourse]], now part of [[Euronext]], is an order-driven, electronic stock exchange. It was automated in the late 1980s. Prior to the 1980s, it consisted of an open outcry exchange. [[Stockbroker]]s met on the trading floor of the Palais Brongniart. In 1986, the [[CATS (trading system)|CATS trading system]] was introduced, and the [[order matching system]] was fully automated.\n\nPeople trading stock will prefer to trade on the most popular exchange since this gives the largest number of potential counter parties (buyers for a seller, sellers for a buyer) and probably the best price. However, there have always been alternatives such as brokers trying to bring parties together to trade outside the exchange. Some third markets that were popular are [[Instinet]], and later Island and Archipelago (the latter two have since been acquired by Nasdaq and NYSE, respectively). One advantage is that this avoids the [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] of the exchange. However, it also has problems such as [[adverse selection]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ubs-goldman-wean-away-trade-from-nyse-nasdaq/articleshow/726712.cms | title=UBS, Goldman wean away trade from NYSE, Nasdaq | work=[[The Economic Times]] | date=December 6, 2006}}</ref> Financial regulators have probed [[dark pool]]s.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-12/off-exchange-stock-trading-reaches-two-year-high-in-u-s- | title=Dark Pools Take Larger Share of Trades Amid SEC Scrutiny|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]] | first=Sam | last=Mamudi | date=June 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.ft.com/content/50428000-220d-11e4-9d4a-00144feabdc0 | title=Financial regulators probe dark pools | work=[[Financial Times]] | date=September 15, 2014 | url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\n==Market participant==\n[[Market participant]]s include individual retail investors, [[institutional investor]]s (e.g., [[pension fund]]s, [[insurance companies]], [[mutual fund]]s, [[index fund]]s, [[exchange-traded fund]]s, [[hedge fund]]s, investor groups, banks and various other [[financial institution]]s), and also publicly traded corporations trading in their own shares.

Conversely, the money used to directly purchase stock is subject to taxation as are any dividends or capital gains they generate for the holder. In this way the current tax code incentivizes individuals to invest indirectly.<ref>{{Cite journal | title=Government Policy and Ownership of Financial Assets | date=2013-01-01 | first = Kristian | last=Rydqvist | first2=Joshua | last2=Spizman | first3=Ilya A. | last3=Strebulaev | ssrn=1428442}}</ref>\n\n==== Participation by income and wealth strata ====\nRates of participation and the value of holdings differs significantly across strata of income.

Indirect participation in the form of 401k ownership shows a similar pattern with a national participation rate of 42.1%, a rate of 46.4% for white households, 31.7% for black households, and 25.8% for Hispanic households.

Various explanations for such large and apparently non-random price movements have been promulgated. For instance, some research has shown that changes in estimated risk, and the use of certain strategies, such as stop-loss limits and [[value at risk]] limits, ''theoretically could'' cause financial markets to overreact.

Psychological research has demonstrated that people are predisposed to 'seeing' patterns, and often will perceive a pattern in what is, in fact, just ''noise'', e.g. seeing familiar shapes in clouds or ink blots. In the present context this means that a succession of good news items about a company may lead investors to overreact positively, driving the price up.

In other words, capital markets facilitate funds movement between the above-mentioned units. This process leads to the enhancement of available financial resources which in turn affects the economic growth positively. Moreover, both economic and financial theories argue that stock prices are affected by macroeconomic trends.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nMany different academic researchers have stated that companies with low P/E ratios and smaller-sized companies have a tendency to outperform the market. Research has shown that mid-sized companies outperform large cap companies, and smaller companies have higher returns historically.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Irrational behavior ===\nSometimes, the market seems to react irrationally to economic or financial news, even if that news is likely to have no real effect on the fundamental value of securities itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/2006211-why-the-market-doesnt-care-where-you-think-it-should-go|title=Why The Market Doesn't Care Where You Think It Should Go|author=David Fabian|date=February 9, 2014|work=Seeking Alpha|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}</ref> However, this market behaviour may be more apparent than real, since often such news was anticipated, and a counter reaction may occur if the news is better (or worse) than expected.  Therefore, the stock market may be swayed in either direction by press releases, rumors, [[euphoria]] and [[mass panic]].\n\nOver the short-term, stocks and other securities can be battered or buoyed by any number of fast market-changing events, making the stock market behavior difficult to predict. Emotions can drive prices up and down, people are generally not as rational as they think, and the reasons for buying and selling are generally accepted.\n\nBehaviorists argue that investors often behave ''irrationally'' when making investment decisions thereby incorrectly pricing securities, which causes market inefficiencies, which, in turn, are opportunities to make money.<ref>Sergey Perminov, ''Trendocracy and Stock Market Manipulations'' (2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4357-5244-3}}).</ref>  However, the whole notion of EMH is that these non-rational reactions to information cancel out, leaving the prices of stocks rationally determined.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average biggest gain in one day was 936.42 points or 11%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/27166818 |title=News Headlines |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=October 13, 2008 |accessdate=March 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Crashes===\n{{Main|Stock market crash}}\n{{further|List of stock market crashes and bear markets}}\n[[Image:IE Real SandP Prices, Earnings, and Dividends 1871-2006.png|380px|right|thumb|[[Robert Shiller]]'s plot of the S&P Composite Real Price Index, Earnings, Dividends, and Interest Rates, from ''[[Irrational Exuberance (book)|Irrational Exuberance]]'', 2d ed.<ref name=\"IE2\">{{cite book |last=Shiller |first=Robert |title=Irrational Exuberance |edition=2nd|year=2005 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-691-12335-6 |title-link=Irrational Exuberance (book) }}</ref> In the preface to this edition, Shiller warns, \"The stock market has not come down to historical levels: the price-earnings ratio as I define it in this book is still, at this writing [2005], in the mid-20s, far higher than the historical average...

In parallel with various economic factors, a reason for stock market crashes is also due to panic and investing public's loss of confidence. Often, stock market crashes end speculative [[economic bubble]]s.\n\nThere have been famous [[stock market crash]]es that have ended in the loss of billions of dollars and wealth destruction on a massive scale. An increasing number of people are involved in the stock market, especially since the [[social security]] and [[retirement plan]]s are being increasingly privatized and linked to [[stock]]s and bonds and other elements of the market. There have been a number of famous stock market crashes like the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the [[stock market crash of 1973\u20134]], the [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday of 1987]], the [[Dot-com bubble]] of 2000, and the Stock Market Crash of 2008.\n\n=== 1929 ===\nOne of the most famous stock market crashes started October 24, 1929, on Black Thursday. The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] lost 50% during this stock market crash. It was the beginning of the [[Great Depression]]. \n\n=== 1987 ===\nAnother famous crash took place on October 19, 1987 \u2013 Black Monday. The crash began in Hong Kong and quickly spread around the world.\n\nBy the end of October, stock markets in Hong Kong had fallen 45.5%, Australia 41.8%, Spain 31%, the United Kingdom 26.4%, the United States 22.68%, and Canada 22.5%. Black Monday itself was the largest one-day percentage decline in stock market history \u2013 the Dow Jones fell by 22.6% in a day. The names \"Black Monday\" and \"Black Tuesday\" are also used for October 28\u201329, 1929, which followed Terrible Thursday\u2014the starting day of the stock market crash in 1929.\n\nThe crash in 1987 raised some puzzles \u2013 main news and events did not predict the catastrophe and visible reasons for the collapse were not identified. This event raised questions about many important assumptions of modern economics, namely, the [[theory of rational conduct of human being|theory of rational human conduct]], the [[theory of market equilibrium]] and the [[efficient-market hypothesis]]. For some time after the crash, trading in stock exchanges worldwide was halted, since the exchange computers did not perform well owing to enormous quantity of trades being received at one time. This halt in trading allowed the [[Federal Reserve System]] and central banks of other countries to take measures to control the spreading of worldwide financial crisis. In the United States the SEC introduced several new measures of control into the stock market in an attempt to prevent a re-occurrence of the events of Black Monday.\n\n=== Circuit breakers ===\nSince the early 1990s, many of the largest exchanges have adopted electronic 'matching engines' to bring together buyers and sellers, replacing the open outcry system. Electronic trading now accounts for the majority of trading in many developed countries. Computer systems were upgraded in the stock exchanges to handle larger trading volumes in a more accurate and controlled manner. The SEC modified the margin requirements in an attempt to lower the volatility of common stocks, stock options and the futures market. The [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] introduced the concept of a circuit breaker. The circuit breaker halts trading if the Dow declines a prescribed number of points for a prescribed amount of time. In February 2012, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) introduced single-stock circuit breakers.<ref>[http://fixglobal.com/home/completing-the-circuit-canadian-regulation/ Completing the Circuit: Canadian Regulation], FIXGlobal, February 2012</ref>\n* New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) circuit breakers<ref>\n{{cite web | url=https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/trading-info | title=Trading Information | publisher=[[New York Stock Exchange]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/content/Funds/FundsToolsCircuitBreakersJSP.jsp | title=Market volatility regulations | publisher=[[The Vanguard Group]]}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! % drop in [[S&P 500 Index]]\n! trading halt\n\n|-\n| 7%\n| Trading will halt for 15 minutes only if drop occurs before 3:25 p.m\n|-\n| 13%\n| Trading will halt for 15 minutes only if drop occurs before 3:25 p.m.\n|-\n| 20%\n| Trading will stop for the day\n|}\n\n==Stock market index==\n{{Main|Stock market index}}\n\nThe movements of the prices in global, regional or local markets are captured in price indices called stock market indices, of which there are many, e.g. the [[Standard & Poor's|S&P]], the [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE]] and the [[Euronext]] indices. Such indices are usually [[market capitalization]] weighted, with the weights reflecting the contribution of the stock to the index. The constituents of the index are reviewed frequently to include/exclude stocks in order to reflect the changing business environment.\n\n==Derivative instruments==\n{{Main|Derivative (finance)}}\n\nFinancial innovation has brought many new financial instruments whose pay-offs or values depend on the prices of stocks. Some examples are [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs), [[stock index]] and [[stock option]]s, [[equity swap]]s, [[single-stock futures]], and stock index [[futures contract|futures]]. These last two may be traded on [[futures exchange]]s (which are distinct from stock exchanges\u2014their history traces back to [[commodity]] futures exchanges), or traded [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]]. As all of these products are only ''[[Derivative (finance)|derived]]'' from stocks, they are sometimes considered to be traded in a (hypothetical) [[derivatives market]], rather than the (hypothetical) stock market.\n\n==Leveraged strategies==\nStock that a trader does not actually own may be traded using [[short selling]]; [[margin buying]] may be used to purchase stock with borrowed funds; or, ''[[derivative (finance)|derivatives]]'' may be used to control large blocks of stocks for a much smaller amount of money than would be required by outright purchase or sales.\n\n===Short selling===\n{{Main|Short selling}}\nIn short selling, the trader borrows stock (usually from his brokerage which holds its clients' shares or its own shares on account to lend to short sellers) then sells it on the market, betting that the price will fall. The trader eventually buys back the stock, making money if the price fell in the meantime and losing money if it rose. Exiting a short position by buying back the stock is called \"covering\". This strategy may also be used by unscrupulous traders in illiquid or thinly traded markets to artificially lower the price of a stock. Hence most markets either prevent short selling or place restrictions on when and how a short sale can occur. The practice of [[naked shorting]] is illegal in most (but not all) stock markets.\n\n===Margin buying===\n{{Main|margin (finance)#Margin buying|l1=margin buying}}\nIn margin buying, the trader borrows money (at interest) to buy a stock and hopes for it to rise. Most industrialized countries have regulations that require that if the borrowing is based on collateral from other stocks the trader owns outright, it can be a maximum of a certain percentage of those other stocks' value. In the United States, the margin requirements have been 50% for many years (that is, if you want to make a $1000 investment, you need to put up $500, and there is often a maintenance margin below the $500).\n\nA margin call is made if the total value of the investor's account cannot support the loss of the trade. (Upon a decline in the value of the margined securities additional funds may be required to maintain the account's equity, and with or without notice the margined security or any others within the account may be sold by the brokerage to protect its loan position. The investor is responsible for any shortfall following such forced sales.)\n\nRegulation of margin requirements (by the [[Federal Reserve]]) was implemented after the [[Crash of 1929]]. Before that, speculators typically only needed to put up as little as 10 percent (or even less) of the total [[investment]] represented by the stocks purchased. Other rules may include the prohibition of ''free-riding:'' putting in an order to buy stocks without paying initially (there is normally a three-day grace period for delivery of the stock), but then selling them (before the three-days are up) and using part of the proceeds to make the original payment (assuming that the value of the stocks has not declined in the interim).\n\n==New issuance==\nFor statistics on equity issuances, see [[Refinitiv league tables]].\n\n==Investment strategies==\n{{Main|Investment strategy|Stock market prediction|Investment management}}\nMany strategies can be classified as either [[fundamental analysis]] or [[technical analysis]]. [[Fundamental analysis]] refers to analyzing companies by their [[financial statement]]s found in [[SEC filing]]s, business trends, and general economic conditions. [[Technical analysis]] studies price actions in markets through the use of charts and quantitative techniques to attempt to forecast price trends based on historical performance, regardless of the company's financial prospects. One example of a technical strategy is the [[Trend following]] method, used by [[John W. Henry]] and [[Ed Seykota]], which uses price patterns and is also rooted in [[risk management]] and [[diversification (finance)|diversification]].\n\nAdditionally, many choose to invest via passive [[index fund]]s. In this method, one holds a portfolio of the entire stock market or some segment of the stock market (such as the [[S&P 500 Index]] or [[Wilshire 5000]]). The principal aim of this strategy is to maximize diversification, minimize taxes from realizing gains, and ride the general trend of the stock market to rise.\n\nResponsible investment emphasizes and requires a long-term horizon on the basis of [[fundamental analysis]] only, avoiding hazards in the expected return of the investment. [[Socially responsible investing]] is another investment preference.\n\nc\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Equity crowdfunding]]\n* [[List of stock exchange trading hours]]\n* [[List of stock exchanges]]\n* [[List of stock market indices]]\n* [[Modeling and analysis of financial markets]]\n* [[Securities market participants (United States)]]\n* [[Securities regulation in the United States]]\n* [[Selling climax]]\n* [[Stock market bubble]]\n* [[Stock market cycles]]\n* [[Stock market data systems]]\n{{div col end}}\n\nc\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book | last = Hamilton | first = W.

Investment in the stock market is most often done via [[stockbroker]]ages and [[electronic trading platform]]s. Investment is usually made with an [[investment strategy]] in mind.\n\nStocks can be categorized by the country where the company is domiciled. For example, [[Nestl\u00e9]] and [[Novartis]] are domiciled in Switzerland and traded on the [[SIX Swiss Exchange]], so they may be considered as part of the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] stock market, although the stocks may also be traded on exchanges in other countries, for example, as [[American depository receipt]]s (ADRs) on U.S. stock markets.\n\n==Size of the markets==\nThe total [[market capitalization]] of equity backed securities worldwide rose from $2.5 trillion in 1980 to $68.65 trillion at the end of 2018.<ref>{{Cite web | title=Market capitalization of listed domestic companies (current US$) | url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD | publisher=[[The World Bank]]}}</ref> As of December 31, 2019, the total [[market capitalization]] of all stocks worldwide was approximately US$70.75 trillion.<ref>{{cite web | title=Market capitalization of listed domestic companies (current US$) | url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/cm.mkt.lcap.cd | publisher=[[The World Bank]]}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2016|}}, there are 60 stock exchanges in the world.

Until the early 1600s, a bourse was not exactly a stock exchange in its modern sense. With the founding of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) in 1602 and the rise of Dutch [[capital market]]s in the early 17th century, the 'old' bourse (a place to trade [[Commodity market|commodities]], [[government bond|government]] and [[municipal bond]]s) found a new purpose \u2013 a formal exchange that specialize in creating and sustaining [[secondary market]]s in the [[Security (finance)|securities]] (such as [[corporate bond|bond]]s and [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]]) issued by [[corporation]]s \u2013 or a stock exchange as we know it today.<ref>Neal, Larry (2005). \"Venture Shares of the Dutch East India Company\", in Goetzmann & Rouwenhorst (eds.), Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 165\u2013175</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101773977 |title=Is Asia the next financial center of the world? |publisher=[[CNBC.com]] |last=Murphy |first=Richard McGill |date=1 Jul 2014 |accessdate=11 Mar 2017}}</ref>|group=\"note\"}} where [[stockbroker]]s and [[stock trader|traders]] can buy and sell [[share (finance)|share]]s of [[stock]], [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], and other [[security (finance)|securities]]. Many large companies have their stocks listed on a stock exchange. This makes the stock more liquid and thus more attractive to many investors. The exchange may also act as a guarantor of settlement. Other stocks may be traded \"over the counter\" (OTC), that is, through a dealer. Some large companies will have their stock listed on more than one exchange in different countries, so as to attract international investors.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ibm.com/investor/faq/item/stock-exchanges.wss | title=IBM Investor relations - FAQ &#124; On what stock exchanges is IBM listed ? |publisher=[[IBM]]}}</ref>\n\nStock exchanges may also cover other types of securities, such as fixed interest securities (bonds) or (less frequently) derivatives which are more likely to be traded OTC.\n\nTrade in stock markets means the transfer (in exchange for money) of a stock or security from a seller to a buyer. This requires these two parties to agree on a price. [[Equity (finance)|Equities]] (stocks or shares) confer an ownership interest in a particular company.\n\nParticipants in the stock market range from small individual [[stock investors]] to larger investors, who can be based anywhere in the world, and may include [[bank]]s, [[insurance]] companies, [[pension fund]]s and [[hedge fund]]s. Their buy or sell orders may be executed on their behalf by a stock exchange [[trader (finance)|trader]].\n\nSome exchanges are physical locations where transactions are carried out on a trading floor, by a method known as [[open outcry]]. This method is used in some stock exchanges and [[commodities exchange]]s, and involves traders shouting bid and offer prices. The other type of stock exchange has a network of computers where trades are made electronically. An example of such an exchange is the [[NASDAQ]].\n\nA potential buyer ''bids'' a specific price for a stock, and a potential seller ''asks'' a specific price for the same stock. Buying or selling ''at the market'' means you will accept ''any'' ask price or bid price for the stock. When the bid and ask prices match, a sale takes place, on a first-come, first-served basis if there are multiple bidders at a given price.\n\nThe purpose of a stock exchange is to facilitate the exchange of securities between buyers and sellers, thus providing a [[marketplace]]. The exchanges provide real-time trading information on the listed securities, facilitating [[price discovery]].\n\nThe [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) is a physical exchange, with a [[hybrid market]] for placing orders electronically from any location as well as on the [[trading floor]]. Orders executed on the trading floor enter by way of exchange members and flow down to a [[floor broker]], who submits the order electronically to the floor trading post for the Designated [[market maker]] (\"DMM\") for that stock to trade the order. The DMM's job is to maintain a two-sided market, making orders to buy and sell the security when there are no other buyers or sellers. If a [[bid\u2013ask spread]] exists, no trade immediately takes place \u2013 in this case the DMM may use their own resources (money or stock) to close the difference. Once a trade has been made, the details are reported on the \"tape\" and sent back to the brokerage firm, which then notifies the investor who placed the order. Computers play an important role, especially for [[program trading]].\n\nThe [[NASDAQ]] is an electronic exchange, where all of the trading is done over a computer network. The process is similar to the New York Stock Exchange. One or more NASDAQ [[market maker]]s will always provide a bid and ask price at which they will always purchase or sell 'their' stock.\n\nThe [[Paris Bourse]], now part of [[Euronext]], is an order-driven, electronic stock exchange. It was automated in the late 1980s. Prior to the 1980s, it consisted of an open outcry exchange. [[Stockbroker]]s met on the trading floor of the Palais Brongniart. In 1986, the [[CATS (trading system)|CATS trading system]] was introduced, and the [[order matching system]] was fully automated.\n\nPeople trading stock will prefer to trade on the most popular exchange since this gives the largest number of potential counter parties (buyers for a seller, sellers for a buyer) and probably the best price. However, there have always been alternatives such as brokers trying to bring parties together to trade outside the exchange. Some third markets that were popular are [[Instinet]], and later Island and Archipelago (the latter two have since been acquired by Nasdaq and NYSE, respectively).

Conversely, the money used to directly purchase stock is subject to taxation as are any dividends or capital gains they generate for the holder.

A common misbelief {{Citation needed|reason=|date=March 2017}} is that, in late 13th-century [[Bruges]], commodity traders gathered inside the house of a man called ''Van der Beurze'', and in 1409 they became the \"Brugse Beurse\", institutionalizing what had been, until then, an informal meeting, but actually, the family Van der Beurze had a building in [[Antwerp]] where those gatherings occurred;<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.belgiumview.com/belgiumview/tl1/view0002205.php4 | title=16de eeuwse traditionele bak- en zandsteenarchitectuur Oude Beurs Antwerpen 1 (centrum) / Antwerp foto | publisher=Belgiumview.com}}</ref>  the Van der Beurze had Antwerp, as most of the merchants of that period, as their primary place for trading.

In 1351 the Venetian government outlawed spreading rumors intended to lower the price of government funds. Bankers in [[Pisa]], [[Verona]], [[Genoa]] and [[Florence]] also began trading in government securities during the 14th century. This was only possible because these were independent city-states not ruled by a duke but a council of influential citizens. Italian companies were also the first to issue shares. Companies in England and the Low Countries followed in the 16th century.

(Note that such events are predicted to occur strictly by [[randomness]], although very rarely.) It seems also to be true more generally that many price movements (beyond those which are predicted to occur 'randomly') are ''not'' occasioned by new information; a study of the fifty largest one-day share price movements in the United States in the post-war period seems to confirm this.<ref name=\"Cutler, D. Poterba, J. & Summers, L. 1991 520\u2013546\"/>\n\nA 'soft' EMH has emerged which does not require that prices remain at or near equilibrium, but only that market participants cannot ''systematically'' profit from any momentary '[[market anomaly]]'. Moreover, while EMH predicts that all price movement (in the absence of change in fundamental information) is random (i.e. non-trending){{dubious|date=November 2019}}, many studies have shown a marked tendency for the stock market to trend over time periods of weeks or longer. Various explanations for such large and apparently non-random price movements have been promulgated. For instance, some research has shown that changes in estimated risk, and the use of certain strategies, such as stop-loss limits and [[value at risk]] limits, ''theoretically could'' cause financial markets to overreact. But the best explanation seems to be that the distribution of stock market prices is non-Gaussian<ref>{{cite web|title=OpenStax CNX|url=http://cnx.org/contents/9UMcK-Dv@2/Non-Gaussian-Observations|website=cnx.org|publisher=Rice University|accessdate=22 February 2017}}</ref> (in which case EMH, in any of its current forms, would not be strictly applicable).<ref>{{cite book | year = 2006 |author1=Mandelbrot, Benoit  |author2=Hudson, Richard L.   |lastauthoramp=yes | title = The Misbehavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence |edition=annot.| publisher = Basic Books | isbn = 978-0-465-04357-6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | year = 2008 | author = Taleb, Nassim Nicholas | title = Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets | edition = 2nd | publisher = Random House | isbn = 978-1-4000-6793-0 | url = https://archive.org/details/fooledbyrandomne00tale }}</ref>\n\nOther research has shown that psychological factors may result in ''exaggerated'' (statistically anomalous) stock price movements (contrary to EMH which assumes such behaviors 'cancel out'). Psychological research has demonstrated that people are predisposed to 'seeing' patterns, and often will perceive a pattern in what is, in fact, just ''noise'', e.g. seeing familiar shapes in clouds or ink blots. In the present context this means that a succession of good news items about a company may lead investors to overreact positively, driving the price up. A period of good returns also boosts the investors' self-confidence, reducing their (psychological) risk threshold.<ref>{{cite journal | year = 1974|author1=Tversky, A.  |author2=Kahneman, D.  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal = Science | volume = 185 | pages = 1124\u20131131| title = Judgement under uncertainty: heuristics and biases | doi = 10.1126/science.185.4157.1124 | pmid = 17835457 | issue = 4157}}</ref>\n\nAnother phenomenon\u2014also from psychology\u2014that works against an [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] assessment is ''[[Groupthink|group thinking]]''. As social animals, it is not easy to stick to an opinion that differs markedly from that of a majority of the group. An example with which one may be familiar is the reluctance to enter a restaurant that is empty; people generally prefer to have their opinion validated by those of others in the group.\n\nIn one paper the authors draw an analogy with [[gambling]].<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=Stephen Morris (game theorist) |first=Stephen |last=Morris |first2=Hyun Song |last2=Shin |title=Risk management with interdependent choice |journal=Oxford Review of Economic Policy |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=52\u201362 |year=1999 |doi=10.1093/oxrep/15.3.52 |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~smorris/Published/paper_21_Risk_Management.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.381.3080 }}</ref> In normal times the market behaves like a game of [[roulette]]; the probabilities are known and largely independent of the investment decisions of the different players. In times of market stress, however, the game becomes more like poker (herding behavior takes over). The players now must give heavy weight to the psychology of other investors and how they are likely to react psychologically.\n\nIn the period running up to the 1987 crash, less than 1 percent{{fact|date=November 2019}} of the analysts' recommendations had been to sell (and even during the 2000\u20132002 [[Bear Market|bear market]], the average did not rise above 5%). In the run-up to 2000, the media amplified the general euphoria, with reports of rapidly rising share prices and the notion that large sums of money could be quickly earned in the so-called [[new economy]] stock market.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nStock markets play an essential role in growing industries that ultimately affect the economy through transferring available funds from units that have excess funds (savings) to those who are suffering from funds deficit (borrowings) (Padhi and Naik, 2012). In other words, capital markets facilitate funds movement between the above-mentioned units. This process leads to the enhancement of available financial resources which in turn affects the economic growth positively. Moreover, both economic and financial theories argue that stock prices are affected by macroeconomic trends.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nMany different academic researchers have stated that companies with low P/E ratios and smaller-sized companies have a tendency to outperform the market. Research has shown that mid-sized companies outperform large cap companies, and smaller companies have higher returns historically.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n=== Irrational behavior ===\nSometimes, the market seems to react irrationally to economic or financial news, even if that news is likely to have no real effect on the fundamental value of securities itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/2006211-why-the-market-doesnt-care-where-you-think-it-should-go|title=Why The Market Doesn't Care Where You Think It Should Go|author=David Fabian|date=February 9, 2014|work=Seeking Alpha|accessdate=August 14, 2015}}</ref> However, this market behaviour may be more apparent than real, since often such news was anticipated, and a counter reaction may occur if the news is better (or worse) than expected.  Therefore, the stock market may be swayed in either direction by press releases, rumors, [[euphoria]] and [[mass panic]].\n\nOver the short-term, stocks and other securities can be battered or buoyed by any number of fast market-changing events, making the stock market behavior difficult to predict. Emotions can drive prices up and down, people are generally not as rational as they think, and the reasons for buying and selling are generally accepted.\n\nBehaviorists argue that investors often behave ''irrationally'' when making investment decisions thereby incorrectly pricing securities, which causes market inefficiencies, which, in turn, are opportunities to make money.<ref>Sergey Perminov, ''Trendocracy and Stock Market Manipulations'' (2008, {{ISBN|978-1-4357-5244-3}}).</ref>  However, the whole notion of EMH is that these non-rational reactions to information cancel out, leaving the prices of stocks rationally determined.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average biggest gain in one day was 936.42 points or 11%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/27166818 |title=News Headlines |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=October 13, 2008 |accessdate=March 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Crashes===\n{{Main|Stock market crash}}\n{{further|List of stock market crashes and bear markets}}\n[[Image:IE Real SandP Prices, Earnings, and Dividends 1871-2006.png|380px|right|thumb|[[Robert Shiller]]'s plot of the S&P Composite Real Price Index, Earnings, Dividends, and Interest Rates, from ''[[Irrational Exuberance (book)|Irrational Exuberance]]'', 2d ed.<ref name=\"IE2\">{{cite book |last=Shiller |first=Robert |title=Irrational Exuberance |edition=2nd|year=2005 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-691-12335-6 |title-link=Irrational Exuberance (book) }}</ref> In the preface to this edition, Shiller warns, \"The stock market has not come down to historical levels: the price-earnings ratio as I define it in this book is still, at this writing [2005], in the mid-20s, far higher than the historical average...

In parallel with various economic factors, a reason for stock market crashes is also due to panic and investing public's loss of confidence. Often, stock market crashes end speculative [[economic bubble]]s.\n\nThere have been famous [[stock market crash]]es that have ended in the loss of billions of dollars and wealth destruction on a massive scale. An increasing number of people are involved in the stock market, especially since the [[social security]] and [[retirement plan]]s are being increasingly privatized and linked to [[stock]]s and bonds and other elements of the market. There have been a number of famous stock market crashes like the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], the [[stock market crash of 1973\u20134]], the [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday of 1987]], the [[Dot-com bubble]] of 2000, and the Stock Market Crash of 2008.\n\n=== 1929 ===\nOne of the most famous stock market crashes started October 24, 1929, on Black Thursday. The [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] lost 50% during this stock market crash. It was the beginning of the [[Great Depression]]. \n\n=== 1987 ===\nAnother famous crash took place on October 19, 1987 \u2013 Black Monday. The crash began in Hong Kong and quickly spread around the world.\n\nBy the end of October, stock markets in Hong Kong had fallen 45.5%, Australia 41.8%, Spain 31%, the United Kingdom 26.4%, the United States 22.68%, and Canada 22.5%. Black Monday itself was the largest one-day percentage decline in stock market history \u2013 the Dow Jones fell by 22.6% in a day. The names \"Black Monday\" and \"Black Tuesday\" are also used for October 28\u201329, 1929, which followed Terrible Thursday\u2014the starting day of the stock market crash in 1929.\n\nThe crash in 1987 raised some puzzles \u2013 main news and events did not predict the catastrophe and visible reasons for the collapse were not identified. This event raised questions about many important assumptions of modern economics, namely, the [[theory of rational conduct of human being|theory of rational human conduct]], the [[theory of market equilibrium]] and the [[efficient-market hypothesis]]. For some time after the crash, trading in stock exchanges worldwide was halted, since the exchange computers did not perform well owing to enormous quantity of trades being received at one time. This halt in trading allowed the [[Federal Reserve System]] and central banks of other countries to take measures to control the spreading of worldwide financial crisis. In the United States the SEC introduced several new measures of control into the stock market in an attempt to prevent a re-occurrence of the events of Black Monday.\n\n=== Circuit breakers ===\nSince the early 1990s, many of the largest exchanges have adopted electronic 'matching engines' to bring together buyers and sellers, replacing the open outcry system. Electronic trading now accounts for the majority of trading in many developed countries. Computer systems were upgraded in the stock exchanges to handle larger trading volumes in a more accurate and controlled manner. The SEC modified the margin requirements in an attempt to lower the volatility of common stocks, stock options and the futures market. The [[New York Stock Exchange]] and the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] introduced the concept of a circuit breaker. The circuit breaker halts trading if the Dow declines a prescribed number of points for a prescribed amount of time. In February 2012, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) introduced single-stock circuit breakers.<ref>[http://fixglobal.com/home/completing-the-circuit-canadian-regulation/ Completing the Circuit: Canadian Regulation], FIXGlobal, February 2012</ref>\n* New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) circuit breakers<ref>\n{{cite web | url=https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse/trading-info | title=Trading Information | publisher=[[New York Stock Exchange]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://personal.vanguard.com/us/content/Funds/FundsToolsCircuitBreakersJSP.jsp | title=Market volatility regulations | publisher=[[The Vanguard Group]]}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! % drop in [[S&P 500 Index]]\n! trading halt\n\n|-\n| 7%\n| Trading will halt for 15 minutes only if drop occurs before 3:25 p.m\n|-\n| 13%\n| Trading will halt for 15 minutes only if drop occurs before 3:25 p.m.\n|-\n| 20%\n| Trading will stop for the day\n|}\n\n==Stock market index==\n{{Main|Stock market index}}\n\nThe movements of the prices in global, regional or local markets are captured in price indices called stock market indices, of which there are many, e.g. the [[Standard & Poor's|S&P]], the [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE]] and the [[Euronext]] indices. Such indices are usually [[market capitalization]] weighted, with the weights reflecting the contribution of the stock to the index. The constituents of the index are reviewed frequently to include/exclude stocks in order to reflect the changing business environment.\n\n==Derivative instruments==\n{{Main|Derivative (finance)}}\n\nFinancial innovation has brought many new financial instruments whose pay-offs or values depend on the prices of stocks. Some examples are [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs), [[stock index]] and [[stock option]]s, [[equity swap]]s, [[single-stock futures]], and stock index [[futures contract|futures]]. These last two may be traded on [[futures exchange]]s (which are distinct from stock exchanges\u2014their history traces back to [[commodity]] futures exchanges), or traded [[Over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]]. As all of these products are only ''[[Derivative (finance)|derived]]'' from stocks, they are sometimes considered to be traded in a (hypothetical) [[derivatives market]], rather than the (hypothetical) stock market.\n\n==Leveraged strategies==\nStock that a trader does not actually own may be traded using [[short selling]]; [[margin buying]] may be used to purchase stock with borrowed funds; or, ''[[derivative (finance)|derivatives]]'' may be used to control large blocks of stocks for a much smaller amount of money than would be required by outright purchase or sales.\n\n===Short selling===\n{{Main|Short selling}}\nIn short selling, the trader borrows stock (usually from his brokerage which holds its clients' shares or its own shares on account to lend to short sellers) then sells it on the market, betting that the price will fall. The trader eventually buys back the stock, making money if the price fell in the meantime and losing money if it rose. Exiting a short position by buying back the stock is called \"covering\". This strategy may also be used by unscrupulous traders in illiquid or thinly traded markets to artificially lower the price of a stock. Hence most markets either prevent short selling or place restrictions on when and how a short sale can occur. The practice of [[naked shorting]] is illegal in most (but not all) stock markets.\n\n===Margin buying===\n{{Main|margin (finance)#Margin buying|l1=margin buying}}\nIn margin buying, the trader borrows money (at interest) to buy a stock and hopes for it to rise. Most industrialized countries have regulations that require that if the borrowing is based on collateral from other stocks the trader owns outright, it can be a maximum of a certain percentage of those other stocks' value. In the United States, the margin requirements have been 50% for many years (that is, if you want to make a $1000 investment, you need to put up $500, and there is often a maintenance margin below the $500).\n\nA margin call is made if the total value of the investor's account cannot support the loss of the trade. (Upon a decline in the value of the margined securities additional funds may be required to maintain the account's equity, and with or without notice the margined security or any others within the account may be sold by the brokerage to protect its loan position. The investor is responsible for any shortfall following such forced sales.)\n\nRegulation of margin requirements (by the [[Federal Reserve]]) was implemented after the [[Crash of 1929]]. Before that, speculators typically only needed to put up as little as 10 percent (or even less) of the total [[investment]] represented by the stocks purchased. Other rules may include the prohibition of ''free-riding:'' putting in an order to buy stocks without paying initially (there is normally a three-day grace period for delivery of the stock), but then selling them (before the three-days are up) and using part of the proceeds to make the original payment (assuming that the value of the stocks has not declined in the interim).\n\n==New issuance==\nFor statistics on equity issuances, see [[Refinitiv league tables]].\n\n==Investment strategies==\n{{Main|Investment strategy|Stock market prediction|Investment management}}\nMany strategies can be classified as either [[fundamental analysis]] or [[technical analysis]]. [[Fundamental analysis]] refers to analyzing companies by their [[financial statement]]s found in [[SEC filing]]s, business trends, and general economic conditions. [[Technical analysis]] studies price actions in markets through the use of charts and quantitative techniques to attempt to forecast price trends based on historical performance, regardless of the company's financial prospects. One example of a technical strategy is the [[Trend following]] method, used by [[John W. Henry]] and [[Ed Seykota]], which uses price patterns and is also rooted in [[risk management]] and [[diversification (finance)|diversification]].\n\nAdditionally, many choose to invest via passive [[index fund]]s. In this method, one holds a portfolio of the entire stock market or some segment of the stock market (such as the [[S&P 500 Index]] or [[Wilshire 5000]]). The principal aim of this strategy is to maximize diversification, minimize taxes from realizing gains, and ride the general trend of the stock market to rise.\n\nResponsible investment emphasizes and requires a long-term horizon on the basis of [[fundamental analysis]] only, avoiding hazards in the expected return of the investment. [[Socially responsible investing]] is another investment preference.\n\n==Taxation==\nTaxation is a consideration of all investment strategies; profit from owning stocks, including dividends received, is subject to different tax rates depending on the type of security and the holding period. Most profit from stock investing is taxed via a [[capital gains tax]]. In many countries, the corporations pay taxes to the government and the shareholders once again pay taxes when they profit from owning the stock, known as \"double taxation\".\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Equity crowdfunding]]\n* [[List of stock exchange trading hours]]\n* [[List of stock exchanges]]\n* [[List of stock market indices]]\n* [[Modeling and analysis of financial markets]]\n* [[Securities market participants (United States)]]\n* [[Securities regulation in the United States]]\n* [[Selling climax]]\n* [[Stock market bubble]]\n* [[Stock market cycles]]\n* [[Stock market data systems]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book | last = Hamilton | first = W.

This [[amide]] has two [[amidogen|\u2013NH<sub>2</sub>]] groups joined by a [[carbonyl]] (C=O) [[functional group]].\n\nUrea serves an important role in the [[metabolism]] of [[nitrogen]]-containing compounds by animals and is the main nitrogen-containing substance in the [[urine]] of [[mammal]]s. It is a colorless, odorless solid, highly soluble in water, and practically non-toxic ({{LD50}} is 15 g/kg for rats).<ref>{{cite web |title=Urea - Registration Dossier - ECHA |url=https://echa.europa.eu/registration-dossier/-/registered-dossier/16152/7/1 |website=echa.europa.eu}}</ref>  Dissolved in water, it is neither [[acidic]] nor [[base (chemistry)|alkaline]].  The body uses it in many processes, most notably [[metabolic waste#Nitrogen wastes|nitrogen excretion]]. The [[liver]] forms it by combining two [[ammonia]] molecules (NH<sub>3</sub>) with a [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) molecule in the [[urea cycle]]. Urea is widely used in [[fertilizer]]s as a source of nitrogen (N) and is an important [[raw material]] for the [[chemical industry]].\n\n[[Friedrich W\u00f6hler]]'s [[W\u00f6hler synthesis|discovery]], in 1828, that urea can be produced from inorganic starting materials, was an important conceptual milestone in chemistry. It showed, for the first time, that a substance, previously known only as a byproduct of life, could be synthesized in the laboratory, without biological starting materials, thereby contradicting the widely held doctrine [[vitalism]], which stated that only living things could produce the chemicals of life.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Agriculture===\n[[File:Urea process plant UFFL 01.jpg|left|thumb|A process plant in [[Bangladesh]] that commercially produces urea as fertilizer by using [[methane]] as the main raw material.]]\nMore than 90% of world industrial production of urea is destined for use as a nitrogen-release fertilizer.<ref name=Ullmann>{{ Ullmann | vauthors = Meessen JH, Petersen H | year=2010|title = Urea | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a27_333 }}</ref> Urea has the highest nitrogen content of all solid nitrogenous fertilizers in common use. Therefore, it has the lowest transportation costs per unit of nitrogen [[nutrient]].\n\nMany [[soil]] bacteria possess the enzyme [[urease]], which [[catalysis|catalyzes]] conversion of urea to [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>) or [[ammonium]] ion (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) and bicarbonate ion (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup>). Thus urea fertilizers rapidly transform to the ammonium form in soils. Among the soil bacteria known to carry urease, some ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), such as species of ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'', can also assimilate the carbon dioxide the reaction releases to make biomass via the [[Calvin cycle]], and harvest energy by oxidizing ammonia (the other product of urease) to [[nitrite]], a process termed nitrification.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00374-005-0004-2|title= Availability of urea to autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria as related to the fate of <sup>14</sup>C- and <sup>15</sup>N-labeled urea added to soil|journal= Biology and Fertility of Soils|volume= 42|issue= 2|pages= 137\u2013145|year= 2005| vauthors = Marsh KL, Sims GK, Mulvaney RL |url= https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c538409aebbba6caa3f3a9841f2186601283704}}</ref>  Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, especially ''[[Nitrobacter]]'', oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which is extremely mobile in soils because of its negative charge and is a major cause of water pollution from agriculture.  Ammonium and nitrate are readily absorbed by plants, and are the dominant sources of nitrogen for plant growth.  Urea is also used in many multi-component solid fertilizer formulations.  Urea is highly soluble in water and is therefore also very suitable for use in fertilizer solutions (in combination with ammonium nitrate: UAN), e.g., in 'foliar feed' fertilizers. For fertilizer use, granules are preferred over prills because of their narrower particle size distribution, which is an advantage for mechanical application.\n\nThe most common impurity of synthetic urea is [[biuret]], which impairs plant growth.\n\nUrea is usually spread at rates of between 40 and 300&nbsp;kg/ha (35 to 270 lbs/acre) but rates vary. Smaller applications incur lower losses due to leaching. During summer, urea is often spread just before or during rain to minimize losses from [[ammonia volatilization from urea|volatilization]] (a process wherein nitrogen is lost to the atmosphere as ammonia gas).\n\nBecause of the high nitrogen concentration in urea, it is very important to achieve an even spread. The application equipment must be correctly calibrated and properly used. Drilling must not occur on contact with or close to seed, due to the risk of germination damage. Urea dissolves in water for application as a spray or through irrigation systems.\n\nIn grain and cotton crops, urea is often applied at the time of the last cultivation before planting. In high rainfall areas and on sandy soils (where nitrogen can be lost through leaching) and where good in-season rainfall is expected, urea can be side- or top-dressed during the growing season. Top-dressing is also popular on pasture and forage crops. In cultivating sugarcane, urea is side-dressed after planting, and applied to each [[ratooning|ratoon]] crop.\n\nUrea absorbs moisture from the atmosphere and therefore is typically stored either in closed or sealed bags on pallets or, if stored in bulk, under cover with a tarpaulin. As with most solid fertilizers, storage in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area is recommended.\n\nOverdose or placing urea near seed is harmful.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Biuret in Urea Fertilizers|url=http://forum.ipni.net/ppiweb/bcrops.nsf/$webindex/AFE7446D8AF92F988525732D0038FDCE/$file/07-3p06.pdf|pages=6\u20137|journal=Better Crops|volume=91|year=2007|issue=3|author=Mikkelsen, R.L.|access-date=2015-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222132413/http://forum.ipni.net/ppiweb/bcrops.nsf/$webindex/AFE7446D8AF92F988525732D0038FDCE/$file/07-3p06.pdf|archive-date=2015-12-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Chemical industry===\nUrea is a raw material for the manufacture of two main classes of materials: [[urea-formaldehyde resin]]s and urea-melamine-formaldehyde used in marine [[plywood]].\n\n===Explosives===\nUrea can be used to make [[urea nitrate]], a [[Explosive material#High explosives|high explosive]] that is used industrially and as part of some [[improvised explosive device]]s.  It is a stabilizer in [[nitrocellulose]] [[Explosive material|explosives]].\n\n===Automobile systems===\nUrea is used in [[selective non-catalytic reduction|SNCR]] and [[selective catalytic reduction|SCR]] reactions to reduce the [[nitrogen oxide|NO<sub>x</sub>]] [[pollutant]]s in [[exhaust gas]]es from [[combustion]] from [[Diesel fuel|Diesel]], dual fuel, and lean-burn [[natural gas]] engines. The [[BlueTec]] system, for example, injects a water-based urea solution into the exhaust system. The ammonia produced by the [[hydrolysis]] of the urea reacts with the nitrogen oxide emissions and is converted into nitrogen and water within the catalytic converter. Trucks and cars using these catalytic converters need to carry a supply of [[diesel exhaust fluid]], a solution of urea in water.\n\n===Laboratory uses===\nUrea in concentrations up to 10 [[molar concentration#Units|M]] is a powerful [[protein]] [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturant]] as it disrupts the noncovalent bonds in the proteins. This property can be exploited to increase the solubility of some proteins.\nA mixture of urea and [[choline chloride]] is used as a [[deep eutectic solvent]] (DES), a substance similar to [[ionic liquid]]. When used in a deep eutectic solvent, urea does not denature the proteins that are solubilized.<ref>E. Durand, J. Lecomte, B. Bar\u00e9a, G. Piombo, E. Dubreucq, P.

Urea present in urine/wastewater can be used directly (though bacteria normally quickly degrade urea.)

Ammonia is smaller, more volatile and more mobile than urea.  If allowed to accumulate, ammonia would raise the [[pH]] in cells to toxic levels. Therefore, many organisms convert ammonia to urea, even though this synthesis has a net energy cost.  Being practically neutral and highly soluble in water, urea is a safe vehicle for the body to transport and excrete excess nitrogen.\n\nUrea is synthesized in the body of many organisms as part of the [[urea cycle]], either from the oxidation of [[amino acid]]s or from [[ammonia]].  In this cycle, [[amino]] groups donated by ammonia and L-[[aspartate]] are converted to urea, while L-[[ornithine]], [[citrulline]], L-[[argininosuccinate]], and L-[[arginine]] act as intermediates.  Urea production occurs in the [[liver]] and is regulated by [[N-acetylglutamate]].  Urea is then dissolved into the blood (in the [[reference ranges for blood tests|reference range]] of 2.5 to 6.7&nbsp;mmol/liter) and further transported and excreted by the kidney as a component of [[urine]]. In addition, a small amount of urea is excreted (along with [[sodium chloride]] and water) in [[sweat]].\n\nIn water, the amine groups undergo slow displacement by water molecules, producing ammonia, [[ammonium ion]], and [[bicarbonate ion]].

Various commercial urea processes are characterized by the conditions under which urea forms and the way that unconverted reactants are further processed.  The process consists of two main [[equilibrium reaction]]s, with incomplete conversion of the reactants.  The first is '''carbamate formation''': the fast [[exothermic]] reaction of liquid ammonia with gaseous carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) at high temperature and pressure to form [[ammonium carbamate]] (H<sub>2</sub>N-COONH<sub>4</sub>):<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hillakomem.com/tag/ammonium-carbamate |title=Inorganic Chemicals \u00bb Ammonium Carbamate |publisher=Hillakomem.com |date=2008-10-02 |access-date=2010-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405135532/http://www.hillakomem.com/tag/ammonium-carbamate |archive-date=2011-04-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n:2 NH<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>2</sub>N-COONH<sub>4</sub> (\u0394H= -117kJ/mol at 110 atm and 160\u00b0C) <ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/8373516|title=Thermodynamics of the Urea Process|first=dadas|last=dadas|access-date=5 August 2018}}</ref>\nThe second is '''urea conversion''': the slower [[endothermic]] decomposition of ammonium carbamate into urea and water:\n:H<sub>2</sub>N-COONH<sub>4</sub> {{eqm}} (NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO + H<sub>2</sub>O (\u0394H= +15.5 kJ/mol at 160-180\u00b0C) <ref name=\"auto\"/>\nThe overall conversion of NH<sub>3</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> to urea is exothermic,<ref name=Ullmann/> the reaction heat from the first reaction driving the second. Like all chemical equilibria, these reactions behave according to [[Le Chatelier's principle]], and the conditions that most favour carbamate formation have an unfavourable effect on the urea conversion equilibrium. The process conditions are, therefore, a compromise: the ill-effect on the first reaction of the high temperature (around 190&nbsp;\u00b0C) needed for the second is compensated for by conducting the process under high pressure (140\u2013175 bar), which favours the first reaction. Although it is necessary to compress gaseous carbon dioxide to this pressure, the ammonia is available from the ammonia plant in liquid form, which can be pumped into the system much more economically. To allow the slow urea formation reaction time to reach equilibrium a large reaction space is needed, so the synthesis reactor in a large urea plant tends to be a massive pressure vessel.\n\nBecause the urea conversion is incomplete, the product must be separated from unchanged ammonium carbamate. In early \"straight-through\" urea plants this was done by letting down the system pressure to atmospheric to let the carbamate decompose back to ammonia and carbon dioxide. Originally, because it was not economic to recompress the ammonia and carbon dioxide for recycle, the ammonia at least would be used for the manufacture of other products, for example [[ammonium nitrate]] or [[sulfate]]. (The carbon dioxide was usually wasted.) Later process schemes made recycling unused ammonia and carbon dioxide practical. This was accomplished by depressurizing the reaction solution in stages (first to 18\u201325 bar and then to 2\u20135 bar) and passing it at each stage through a steam-heated ''carbamate decomposer'', then recombining the resultant carbon dioxide and ammonia in a falling-film ''carbamate condenser'' and pumping the carbamate solution into the previous stage.\n\n===== Stripping concept =====\n\nThe \"total recycle\" concept has two main disadvantages. The first is the complexity of the flow scheme and, consequently, the amount of process equipment needed. The second is the amount of water recycled in the carbamate solution, which has an adverse effect on the equilibrium in the urea conversion reaction and thus on overall plant efficiency. The stripping concept, developed in the early 1960s by [[Stamicarbon]] in The Netherlands, addressed both problems. It also improved heat recovery and reuse in the process.\n\nThe position of the equilibrium in the carbamate formation/decomposition depends on the product of the [[partial pressure]]s of the reactants. In the total recycle processes, carbamate decomposition is promoted by reducing the overall pressure, which reduces the partial pressure of both ammonia and carbon dioxide. It is possible, however, to achieve a similar effect without lowering the overall pressure\u2014by suppressing the partial pressure of just one of the reactants. Instead of feeding carbon dioxide gas directly to the reactor with the ammonia, as in the total recycle process, the stripping process first routes the carbon dioxide through a stripper (a carbamate decomposer that operates under full system pressure and is configured to provide maximum gas-liquid contact). This flushes out free ammonia, reducing its partial pressure over the liquid surface and carrying it directly to a carbamate condenser (also under full system pressure). From there, reconstituted ammonium carbamate liquor passes directly to the reactor. That eliminates the medium-pressure stage of the total recycle process altogether.\n\nThe stripping concept was such a major advance that competitors such as [[Snamprogetti]]\u2014now Saipem\u2014(Italy), the former [[Montedison]] (Italy), [[Toyo Engineering Corporation]] (Japan), and [[Urea Casale]] (Switzerland) all developed versions of it. Today, effectively all new urea plants use the principle, and many total recycle urea plants have converted to a stripping process. No one has proposed a radical alternative to the approach. The main thrust of technological development today, in response to industry demands for ever larger individual plants, is directed at re-configuring and re-orientating major items in the plant to reduce size and overall height of the plant, and at meeting challenging environmental performance targets.<ref>{{cite conference | vauthors = Gevers B, Mennen J, Meessen J | year = 2009 | title = Avancore \u2013 Stamicarbon's New Urea Plant Concept | conference = Nitrogen+Syngas International Conference | location = Rome | pages = 113\u2013125}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.bcinsight.com/sitemap_issue_articles.asp?issueID=229|title=World Class Urea Plants|journal=Nitrogen+Syngas|volume=294|pages= 29\u201338 |year=2008}}</ref>\n\n===== Side reactions =====\nIt is fortunate that the urea conversion reaction is slow.  If it were not it would go into reverse in the stripper. As it is, succeeding stages of the process must be designed to minimize residence times, at least until the temperature reduces to the point where the reversion reaction is very slow.\n\nTwo reactions produce impurities. [[Biuret]] is formed when two molecules of urea combine with the loss of a molecule of ammonia.\n:2 NH<sub>2</sub>CONH<sub>2</sub> \u2192 H<sub>2</sub>NCONHCONH<sub>2</sub> + NH<sub>3</sub>\nNormally this reaction is suppressed in the synthesis reactor by maintaining an excess of ammonia, but after the stripper, it occurs until the temperature is reduced. Biuret is undesirable in fertilizer urea because it is toxic to crop plants, although to what extent depends on the nature of the crop and the method of application of the urea.<ref>James, G.R.; Oomen, C.J.: \"An Update on the Biuret Myth\". ''Nitrogen 2001'' International Conference, Tampa.</ref> (Biuret is actually welcome in urea when is used as a cattle feed supplement).\n\n'''[[Isocyanic acid]]''' results from the thermal decomposition of [[ammonium cyanate]], which is in [[chemical equilibrium]] with urea:\n:NH<sub>2</sub>CONH<sub>2</sub> \u2192 NH<sub>4</sub>NCO \u2192 HNCO + NH<sub>3</sub>\nThis reaction is at its worst when the urea solution is heated at low pressure, which happens when the solution is concentrated for prilling or granulation (see below). The reaction products mostly volatilize into the overhead vapours, and recombine when these condense to form urea again, which contaminates the process condensate.\n\n===== Corrosion =====\n\n[[Ammonium carbamate]] solutions are notoriously corrosive to metallic construction materials, even more resistant forms of stainless steel\u2014especially in the hottest parts of the plant such as the stripper. Historically corrosion has been minimized (although not eliminated) by continuous injection of a small amount of oxygen (as air) into the plant to establish and maintain a passive oxide layer on exposed stainless steel surfaces. Because the carbon dioxide feed is recovered from ammonia synthesis gas, it contains traces of hydrogen that can mingle with passivation air to form an explosive mixture if allowed to accumulate.\n\nIn the mid 1990s two duplex (ferritic-austenitic) stainless steels were introduced (DP28W, jointly developed by [[Toyo Engineering]] and [[Sumitomo Metals Industries]]<ref>{{cite journal|author=Nagashima, E. |year=2010|title=Use of DP28W Reduces Passivation Air in Urea Plants|journal=Nitrogen+Syngas |volume=304|pages=193\u2013200|url=http://www.bcinsight.com/sitemap_issue_articles.asp?issueID=264}}</ref> and Safurex, jointly developed by [[Stamicarbon]] and [[Sandvik|Sandvik Materials Technology]] (Sweden).<ref>Kangas, P.; Walden, B.; Berglund, G.; Nicholls, M.

The advantage of prills is that, in general, they can be produced more cheaply than granules and that the technique was firmly established in industrial practice long before a satisfactory urea granulation process was commercialized.  However, on account of the limited size of particles that can be produced with the desired degree of sphericity and their low crushing and impact strength, the performance of prills during bulk storage, handling and use is generally (with some exceptions<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.bcinsight.com/sitemap_issue_articles.asp?issueID=220|title=Prills or granules?|journal=Nitrogen+Syngas|volume=292|pages= 23\u201327 |year=2008}}</ref>) considered inferior to that of granules.\n\nHigh-quality compound fertilizers containing nitrogen co-granulated with other components such as phosphates have been produced routinely since the beginnings of the modern fertilizer industry, but on account of the low melting point and hygroscopic nature of urea it took courage to apply the same kind of technology to granulate urea on its own.<ref>\"Ferrara refines its granulation process\".

The resulting dense and energetically favourable hydrogen-bond network is probably established at the cost of efficient molecular packing: The structure is quite open, the ribbons forming tunnels with square cross-section.  The carbon in urea is described as sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized, the C-N bonds have significant double bond character, and the carbonyl oxygen is basic compared to, say, [[formaldehyde]]. Urea's high aqueous solubility reflects its ability to engage in extensive hydrogen bonding with water.\n\nBy virtue of its tendency to form porous frameworks, urea has the ability to trap many organic compounds.  In these so-called [[clathrate]]s, the organic \"guest\" molecules are held in channels formed by interpenetrating helices composed of [[hydrogen bond|hydrogen-bonded]] urea molecules. This behaviour can be used to separate mixtures, e.g., in the production of [[aviation fuel]] and [[lubricating oil]]s, and in the separation of [[hydrocarbon]]s.\n\nAs the helices are interconnected, all helices in a crystal must have the same [[stereoisomerism|molecular handedness]].

At room temperature, water solutions of urea are prone to same decomposition reaction in the presence of [[urease]].

Thus urea fertilizers rapidly transform to the ammonium form in soils. Among the soil bacteria known to carry urease, some ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), such as species of ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'', can also assimilate the carbon dioxide the reaction releases to make biomass via the [[Calvin cycle]], and harvest energy by oxidizing ammonia (the other product of urease) to [[nitrite]], a process termed nitrification.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00374-005-0004-2|title= Availability of urea to autotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria as related to the fate of <sup>14</sup>C- and <sup>15</sup>N-labeled urea added to soil|journal= Biology and Fertility of Soils|volume= 42|issue= 2|pages= 137\u2013145|year= 2005| vauthors = Marsh KL, Sims GK, Mulvaney RL |url= https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6c538409aebbba6caa3f3a9841f2186601283704}}</ref>  Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, especially ''[[Nitrobacter]]'', oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which is extremely mobile in soils because of its negative charge and is a major cause of water pollution from agriculture.  Ammonium and nitrate are readily absorbed by plants, and are the dominant sources of nitrogen for plant growth.  Urea is also used in many multi-component solid fertilizer formulations.  Urea is highly soluble in water and is therefore also very suitable for use in fertilizer solutions (in combination with ammonium nitrate: UAN), e.g., in 'foliar feed' fertilizers. For fertilizer use, granules are preferred over prills because of their narrower particle size distribution, which is an advantage for mechanical application.\n\nThe most common impurity of synthetic urea is [[biuret]], which impairs plant growth.\n\nUrea is usually spread at rates of between 40 and 300&nbsp;kg/ha (35 to 270 lbs/acre) but rates vary. Smaller applications incur lower losses due to leaching. During summer, urea is often spread just before or during rain to minimize losses from [[ammonia volatilization from urea|volatilization]] (a process wherein nitrogen is lost to the atmosphere as ammonia gas).\n\nBecause of the high nitrogen concentration in urea, it is very important to achieve an even spread. The application equipment must be correctly calibrated and properly used. Drilling must not occur on contact with or close to seed, due to the risk of germination damage. Urea dissolves in water for application as a spray or through irrigation systems.\n\nIn grain and cotton crops, urea is often applied at the time of the last cultivation before planting. In high rainfall areas and on sandy soils (where nitrogen can be lost through leaching) and where good in-season rainfall is expected, urea can be side- or top-dressed during the growing season. Top-dressing is also popular on pasture and forage crops. In cultivating sugarcane, urea is side-dressed after planting, and applied to each [[ratooning|ratoon]] crop.\n\nUrea absorbs moisture from the atmosphere and therefore is typically stored either in closed or sealed bags on pallets or, if stored in bulk, under cover with a tarpaulin. As with most solid fertilizers, storage in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area is recommended.\n\nOverdose or placing urea near seed is harmful.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Biuret in Urea Fertilizers|url=http://forum.ipni.net/ppiweb/bcrops.nsf/$webindex/AFE7446D8AF92F988525732D0038FDCE/$file/07-3p06.pdf|pages=6\u20137|journal=Better Crops|volume=91|year=2007|issue=3|author=Mikkelsen, R.L.|access-date=2015-05-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222132413/http://forum.ipni.net/ppiweb/bcrops.nsf/$webindex/AFE7446D8AF92F988525732D0038FDCE/$file/07-3p06.pdf|archive-date=2015-12-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Chemical industry===\nUrea is a raw material for the manufacture of two main classes of materials: [[urea-formaldehyde resin]]s and urea-melamine-formaldehyde used in marine [[plywood]].\n\n===Explosives===\nUrea can be used to make [[urea nitrate]], a [[Explosive material#High explosives|high explosive]] that is used industrially and as part of some [[improvised explosive device]]s.  It is a stabilizer in [[nitrocellulose]] [[Explosive material|explosives]].\n\n===Automobile systems===\nUrea is used in [[selective non-catalytic reduction|SNCR]] and [[selective catalytic reduction|SCR]] reactions to reduce the [[nitrogen oxide|NO<sub>x</sub>]] [[pollutant]]s in [[exhaust gas]]es from [[combustion]] from [[Diesel fuel|Diesel]], dual fuel, and lean-burn [[natural gas]] engines. The [[BlueTec]] system, for example, injects a water-based urea solution into the exhaust system. The ammonia produced by the [[hydrolysis]] of the urea reacts with the nitrogen oxide emissions and is converted into nitrogen and water within the catalytic converter. Trucks and cars using these catalytic converters need to carry a supply of [[diesel exhaust fluid]], a solution of urea in water.\n\n===Laboratory uses===\nUrea in concentrations up to 10 [[molar concentration#Units|M]] is a powerful [[protein]] [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturant]] as it disrupts the noncovalent bonds in the proteins. This property can be exploited to increase the solubility of some proteins.\nA mixture of urea and [[choline chloride]] is used as a [[deep eutectic solvent]] (DES), a substance similar to [[ionic liquid]]. When used in a deep eutectic solvent, urea does not denature the proteins that are solubilized.<ref>E. Durand, J. Lecomte, B. Bar\u00e9a, G. Piombo, E. Dubreucq, P.

Ammonia is smaller, more volatile and more mobile than urea.  If allowed to accumulate, ammonia would raise the [[pH]] in cells to toxic levels. Therefore, many organisms convert ammonia to urea, even though this synthesis has a net energy cost.  Being practically neutral and highly soluble in water, urea is a safe vehicle for the body to transport and excrete excess nitrogen.\n\nUrea is synthesized in the body of many organisms as part of the [[urea cycle]], either from the oxidation of [[amino acid]]s or from [[ammonia]].  In this cycle, [[amino]] groups donated by ammonia and L-[[aspartate]] are converted to urea, while L-[[ornithine]], [[citrulline]], L-[[argininosuccinate]], and L-[[arginine]] act as intermediates.  Urea production occurs in the [[liver]] and is regulated by [[N-acetylglutamate]].  Urea is then dissolved into the blood (in the [[reference ranges for blood tests|reference range]] of 2.5 to 6.7&nbsp;mmol/liter) and further transported and excreted by the kidney as a component of [[urine]]. In addition, a small amount of urea is excreted (along with [[sodium chloride]] and water) in [[sweat]].\n\nIn water, the amine groups undergo slow displacement by water molecules, producing ammonia, [[ammonium ion]], and [[bicarbonate ion]].  For this reason, old, stale urine has a stronger odor than fresh urine.\n\n===Humans===\nThe [[renal urea handling|cycling of and excretion of urea by the kidneys]] is a vital part of mammalian metabolism. Besides its role as carrier of waste nitrogen, urea also plays a role in the [[countercurrent exchange system]] of the [[nephrons]], that allows for re-absorption of water and critical ions from the excreted [[urine]].

In situations such as [[muscle wasting]], 1&nbsp;mmol of excessive urea in the urine (as measured by urine volume in litres multiplied by urea concentration in mmol/l) roughly corresponds to a muscle loss of 0.67&nbsp;gram.\n\n===Other species===\nIn [[marine biology|aquatic]] organisms the most common form of nitrogen waste is ammonia, whereas land-dwelling organisms convert the toxic ammonia to either urea or [[uric acid]].  Urea is found in the urine of [[mammal]]s and [[amphibian]]s, as well as some fish.

As large quantities of carbon dioxide are produced during the ammonia manufacturing process as a byproduct from [[hydrocarbons]] (predominantly natural gas, less often petroleum derivatives), or occasionally from coal (steam shift reaction), urea production plants are almost always located adjacent to the site where the ammonia is manufactured. Although natural gas is both the most economical and the most widely available ammonia plant feedstock, plants using it do not produce quite as much carbon dioxide from the process as is needed to convert their entire ammonia output into urea. In recent years new technologies such as the KM-CDR process<ref>{{cite conference | vauthors = Kishimoto S, Shimura R, Kamijo T | year = 2008 | title = MHI Proprietary Process for Reducing CO<sub>2</sub> Emission and Increasing Urea Production | conference = Nitrogen + Syngas 2008 International Conference and Exhibition | location = Moscow }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Al-Ansari | first1 = F | year = 2008 | title = Carbon Dioxide Recovery at GPIC | journal = Nitrogen+Syngas | volume = 293 | issue = | pages = 36\u201338 |url=http://www.bcinsight.com/sitemap_issue_articles.asp?issueID=219}}</ref> have been developed to recover supplementary carbon dioxide from the combustion exhaust gases produced in the fired reforming furnace of the ammonia synthesis gas plant, allowing operators of stand-alone nitrogen fertilizer complexes to avoid the need to handle and market ammonia as a separate product and also to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere.\n\n==== Synthesis ====\n[[File:THC 2003.902.071 Urea Plant.tif|thumb|right | Urea plant using ammonium carbamate briquettes, Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, ca. 1930]]\nThe basic process, developed in 1922, is also called the Bosch\u2013Meiser urea process after its discoverers. Various commercial urea processes are characterized by the conditions under which urea forms and the way that unconverted reactants are further processed.  The process consists of two main [[equilibrium reaction]]s, with incomplete conversion of the reactants.  The first is '''carbamate formation''': the fast [[exothermic]] reaction of liquid ammonia with gaseous carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) at high temperature and pressure to form [[ammonium carbamate]] (H<sub>2</sub>N-COONH<sub>4</sub>):<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hillakomem.com/tag/ammonium-carbamate |title=Inorganic Chemicals \u00bb Ammonium Carbamate |publisher=Hillakomem.com |date=2008-10-02 |access-date=2010-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405135532/http://www.hillakomem.com/tag/ammonium-carbamate |archive-date=2011-04-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n:2 NH<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>2</sub>N-COONH<sub>4</sub> (\u0394H= -117kJ/mol at 110 atm and 160\u00b0C) <ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/8373516|title=Thermodynamics of the Urea Process|first=dadas|last=dadas|access-date=5 August 2018}}</ref>\nThe second is '''urea conversion''': the slower [[endothermic]] decomposition of ammonium carbamate into urea and water:\n:H<sub>2</sub>N-COONH<sub>4</sub> {{eqm}} (NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO + H<sub>2</sub>O (\u0394H= +15.5 kJ/mol at 160-180\u00b0C) <ref name=\"auto\"/>\nThe overall conversion of NH<sub>3</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> to urea is exothermic,<ref name=Ullmann/> the reaction heat from the first reaction driving the second. Like all chemical equilibria, these reactions behave according to [[Le Chatelier's principle]], and the conditions that most favour carbamate formation have an unfavourable effect on the urea conversion equilibrium. The process conditions are, therefore, a compromise: the ill-effect on the first reaction of the high temperature (around 190&nbsp;\u00b0C) needed for the second is compensated for by conducting the process under high pressure (140\u2013175 bar), which favours the first reaction. Although it is necessary to compress gaseous carbon dioxide to this pressure, the ammonia is available from the ammonia plant in liquid form, which can be pumped into the system much more economically. To allow the slow urea formation reaction time to reach equilibrium a large reaction space is needed, so the synthesis reactor in a large urea plant tends to be a massive pressure vessel.\n\nBecause the urea conversion is incomplete, the product must be separated from unchanged ammonium carbamate. In early \"straight-through\" urea plants this was done by letting down the system pressure to atmospheric to let the carbamate decompose back to ammonia and carbon dioxide. Originally, because it was not economic to recompress the ammonia and carbon dioxide for recycle, the ammonia at least would be used for the manufacture of other products, for example [[ammonium nitrate]] or [[sulfate]]. (The carbon dioxide was usually wasted.) Later process schemes made recycling unused ammonia and carbon dioxide practical. This was accomplished by depressurizing the reaction solution in stages (first to 18\u201325 bar and then to 2\u20135 bar) and passing it at each stage through a steam-heated ''carbamate decomposer'', then recombining the resultant carbon dioxide and ammonia in a falling-film ''carbamate condenser'' and pumping the carbamate solution into the previous stage.\n\n===== Stripping concept =====\n\nThe \"total recycle\" concept has two main disadvantages. The first is the complexity of the flow scheme and, consequently, the amount of process equipment needed. The second is the amount of water recycled in the carbamate solution, which has an adverse effect on the equilibrium in the urea conversion reaction and thus on overall plant efficiency. The stripping concept, developed in the early 1960s by [[Stamicarbon]] in The Netherlands, addressed both problems. It also improved heat recovery and reuse in the process.\n\nThe position of the equilibrium in the carbamate formation/decomposition depends on the product of the [[partial pressure]]s of the reactants. In the total recycle processes, carbamate decomposition is promoted by reducing the overall pressure, which reduces the partial pressure of both ammonia and carbon dioxide. It is possible, however, to achieve a similar effect without lowering the overall pressure\u2014by suppressing the partial pressure of just one of the reactants. Instead of feeding carbon dioxide gas directly to the reactor with the ammonia, as in the total recycle process, the stripping process first routes the carbon dioxide through a stripper (a carbamate decomposer that operates under full system pressure and is configured to provide maximum gas-liquid contact). This flushes out free ammonia, reducing its partial pressure over the liquid surface and carrying it directly to a carbamate condenser (also under full system pressure). From there, reconstituted ammonium carbamate liquor passes directly to the reactor. That eliminates the medium-pressure stage of the total recycle process altogether.\n\nThe stripping concept was such a major advance that competitors such as [[Snamprogetti]]\u2014now Saipem\u2014(Italy), the former [[Montedison]] (Italy), [[Toyo Engineering Corporation]] (Japan), and [[Urea Casale]] (Switzerland) all developed versions of it. Today, effectively all new urea plants use the principle, and many total recycle urea plants have converted to a stripping process. No one has proposed a radical alternative to the approach. The main thrust of technological development today, in response to industry demands for ever larger individual plants, is directed at re-configuring and re-orientating major items in the plant to reduce size and overall height of the plant, and at meeting challenging environmental performance targets.<ref>{{cite conference | vauthors = Gevers B, Mennen J, Meessen J | year = 2009 | title = Avancore \u2013 Stamicarbon's New Urea Plant Concept | conference = Nitrogen+Syngas International Conference | location = Rome | pages = 113\u2013125}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.bcinsight.com/sitemap_issue_articles.asp?issueID=229|title=World Class Urea Plants|journal=Nitrogen+Syngas|volume=294|pages= 29\u201338 |year=2008}}</ref>\n\n===== Side reactions =====\nIt is fortunate that the urea conversion reaction is slow.  If it were not it would go into reverse in the stripper. As it is, succeeding stages of the process must be designed to minimize residence times, at least until the temperature reduces to the point where the reversion reaction is very slow.\n\nTwo reactions produce impurities. [[Biuret]] is formed when two molecules of urea combine with the loss of a molecule of ammonia.\n:2 NH<sub>2</sub>CONH<sub>2</sub> \u2192 H<sub>2</sub>NCONHCONH<sub>2</sub> + NH<sub>3</sub>\nNormally this reaction is suppressed in the synthesis reactor by maintaining an excess of ammonia, but after the stripper, it occurs until the temperature is reduced. Biuret is undesirable in fertilizer urea because it is toxic to crop plants, although to what extent depends on the nature of the crop and the method of application of the urea.<ref>James, G.R.; Oomen, C.J.: \"An Update on the Biuret Myth\". ''Nitrogen 2001'' International Conference, Tampa.</ref> (Biuret is actually welcome in urea when is used as a cattle feed supplement).\n\n'''[[Isocyanic acid]]''' results from the thermal decomposition of [[ammonium cyanate]], which is in [[chemical equilibrium]] with urea:\n:NH<sub>2</sub>CONH<sub>2</sub> \u2192 NH<sub>4</sub>NCO \u2192 HNCO + NH<sub>3</sub>\nThis reaction is at its worst when the urea solution is heated at low pressure, which happens when the solution is concentrated for prilling or granulation (see below). The reaction products mostly volatilize into the overhead vapours, and recombine when these condense to form urea again, which contaminates the process condensate.\n\n===== Corrosion =====\n\n[[Ammonium carbamate]] solutions are notoriously corrosive to metallic construction materials, even more resistant forms of stainless steel\u2014especially in the hottest parts of the plant such as the stripper. Historically corrosion has been minimized (although not eliminated) by continuous injection of a small amount of oxygen (as air) into the plant to establish and maintain a passive oxide layer on exposed stainless steel surfaces. Because the carbon dioxide feed is recovered from ammonia synthesis gas, it contains traces of hydrogen that can mingle with passivation air to form an explosive mixture if allowed to accumulate.\n\nIn the mid 1990s two duplex (ferritic-austenitic) stainless steels were introduced (DP28W, jointly developed by [[Toyo Engineering]] and [[Sumitomo Metals Industries]]<ref>{{cite journal|author=Nagashima, E. |year=2010|title=Use of DP28W Reduces Passivation Air in Urea Plants|journal=Nitrogen+Syngas |volume=304|pages=193\u2013200|url=http://www.bcinsight.com/sitemap_issue_articles.asp?issueID=264}}</ref> and Safurex, jointly developed by [[Stamicarbon]] and [[Sandvik|Sandvik Materials Technology]] (Sweden).<ref>Kangas, P.; Walden, B.; Berglund, G.; Nicholls, M.

In theory, they could operate with no oxygen.\n\n[[Saipem]] now uses either zirconium stripper tubes, or bimetallic tubes with a titanium body (cheaper but less erosion-resistant) and a metallurgically bonded internal zirconium lining. These tubes are fabricated by [[ATI Wah Chang]] (USA) using its Omegabond technique.<ref>Allegheny Technologies, Inc.

The advantage of prills is that, in general, they can be produced more cheaply than granules and that the technique was firmly established in industrial practice long before a satisfactory urea granulation process was commercialized.  However, on account of the limited size of particles that can be produced with the desired degree of sphericity and their low crushing and impact strength, the performance of prills during bulk storage, handling and use is generally (with some exceptions<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.bcinsight.com/sitemap_issue_articles.asp?issueID=220|title=Prills or granules?|journal=Nitrogen+Syngas|volume=292|pages= 23\u201327 |year=2008}}</ref>) considered inferior to that of granules.\n\nHigh-quality compound fertilizers containing nitrogen co-granulated with other components such as phosphates have been produced routinely since the beginnings of the modern fertilizer industry, but on account of the low melting point and hygroscopic nature of urea it took courage to apply the same kind of technology to granulate urea on its own.<ref>\"Ferrara refines its granulation process\". Nitrogen 219, 51\u201356 (1996)</ref> But at the end of the 1970s three companies began to develop [[fluidized-bed]] granulation. The first in the field was Nederlandse Stikstof Maatschappij, which later became part of Hydro Agri (now [[Yara International]]).<ref>{{cite conference | vauthors = Bruynseels JP | year = 1981 | title = NSM's Fluidized-Bed Urea Granulation Process ''Fertilizer Nitrogen'' | conference = International Conference | location = London | pages = 277\u2013288 }}</ref> Yara eventually sold this technology to [[Uhde GmbH]], whose [[Uhde Fertilizer Technology]] subsidiary now markets it.

(2007) \"The Toyo Urea Granulation Technology\". 20th Arab Fertilizer International Annual Technical Conference, Tunisia.</ref> [[Stamicarbon]] also undertook development work on its own fluidized-bed granulation system, using film sprays rather than atomizing sprays to introduce the urea melt, but shelved it until the 1990s, when there was for a time considerable doubt about the commercial future of the Hydro (Uhde) process.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.bcinsight.com/sitemap_issue_articles.asp?issueID=24|title=Fair Wind for FB Technology|journal=Nitrogen+Syngas|volume= 282|pages=40\u201347}}</ref> As a result, the Stamicarbon technology is now commercialized and highly successful. More recently, Urea Casale introduced a different fluidized-bed granulation system: the urea is sprayed in laterally from the side walls of the granulator instead of from the bottom. This organizes the bed into two cylindrical masses contrarotating on parallel longitudinal axes. The raw product is uniform enough not to require screens.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.bcinsight.com/sitemap_issue_articles.asp?issueID=333|title=Better product quality|journal=Nitrogen+Syngas|volume= 319|pages=52\u201361 |year=2012}}</ref>\n\nSurprisingly, perhaps, considering the product particles are not spherical, pastillation using a Rotoform steel-belt pastillator is gaining ground as a urea particle-forming process as a result of development work by [[Stamicarbon]] in collaboration with [[Sandvik|Sandvik Process Systems]] (Germany). Single-machine capacity is limited to 175 t/d, but the machines are simple and need little maintenance, specific power consumption is much lower than for granulation, and the product is very uniform. The robustness of the product appears to make up for its non-spherical shape.<ref>van der Werf, J.W.; Brouwer, M.J.

Given the ongoing safety and security concerns surrounding fertilizer-grade solid ammonium nitrate, UAN provides a considerably safer alternative without entirely sacrificing the agronomic properties that make ammonium nitrate more attractive than urea as a fertilizer in areas with short growing seasons. It is also more convenient to store and handle than a solid product and easier to apply accurately to the land by mechanical means.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.bcinsight.com/sitemap_issue_articles.asp?issueID=11|title=Is UAN the Solution?|journal=Nitrogen+Syngas|year= 2007|volume= 287|pages= 28\u201330}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Welch | first1 = I | year = 2007 | title = Urea vs UAN | url = http://www.bcinsight.com/sitemap_issue_articles.asp?issueID=67| journal = Nitrogen+Syngas | volume = 289 | issue = | pages = 26\u201327 }}</ref>\n\n===Laboratory preparation===\nUreas in the more general sense can be accessed in the laboratory by reaction of [[phosgene]] with primary or secondary [[amine]]s, proceeding through an [[isocyanate]] intermediate.
