Indra accepted the gift and placed it on the trunk of the elephant as a test to prove that he was not an egoistic deva. The elephant, knowing that Indra had no control over his own ego, threw the garland on the ground. This enraged the sage as the garland was a dwelling of ''Sri'' (fortune) and was to be treated as a ''[[prasada]]'' or religious offering. Durvasa cursed Indra and all devas to be bereft of all strength, energy, and fortune.<ref>[http://www.mahakumbhfestival.com/2012/02/history-maha-kumbh-mela/ Story of Maha Kumbh Mela from Srimad Bhagvatam]</ref>\n\nIn battles following the incident, the Devas were defeated and the [[Asura]]s, led by [[Mahabali|Bali]], gained control over [[the universe]]. The Devas sought [[Vishnu]]'s help, who advised them to treat the Asuras in a diplomatic manner. The Devas formed an alliance with the Asuras to jointly churn the ocean for the [[amrita|nectar of immortality]] and to share it among themselves. However, Vishnu told the Devas that he would arrange for them alone to obtain the nectar.\n\nThe churning of the [[Ocean of Milk]] was an elaborate process: [[Mount Mandara]] was used as the churning rod, and [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]], a [[Nagaraja|n\u0101gar\u0101ja]] who abides on Shiva's neck, became the churning rope.\n\nIn some versions, Vishnu knew that Vasuki would vomit poisonous flames when twisted and pulled, and therefore advised the Devas to hold the tail end of the snake, without telling them the reason. First, the Devas held the head end of the snake, while the Asuras held the tail end. The Asuras were enraged by this, as the lower part of an animal is impure, or less pure, than the part that contains the head. They insisted on holding the head side of the snake. Vishnu had an inkling that his reverse psychology would work. \n\nThe Asuras demanded to hold the head of the snake, while the Devas, taking advice from Vishnu, agreed to hold its tail. When the mountain was placed in the ocean, it began to sink. Vishnu, in the form of [[Kurma]] (lit. ''turtle''), came to their rescue and supported the mountain on his shell. The Asuras were poisoned by fumes emitted by Vasuki. Despite this, the Devas and the Asuras pulled back and forth on the snake's body alternately, causing the mountain to rotate, which in turn churned the ocean. \n\nThe Samudra Manthana process released a number of things from the Ocean of Milk. One of them was the lethal poison known as ''[[Halahala]]''. However, in some versions of the story, the poison escaped from the mouth of the serpent king as the demons and gods churned. This terrified the gods and demons because the poison was so powerful that it could destroy all of creation. The Devas then approached [[Shiva]] for protection. Shiva consumed the poison to protect the three worlds and which in the process gave a blue hue to his throat.\n\nIn some versions as Shiva drank the poison, he was suffering intense pain, but could not die, as seen by [[Parvati]], his consort. She immediately places a hand on his throat, stopping the poison to flow any further, and by her ''Maya'' stopped it forever. \n\nAs a result, his throat turned blue and he was henceforth called ''Neelakantha'' (the blue-throated one; \"neela\" = \"blue\", \"kantha\" = \"throat\" in [[Sanskrit]]).\n\n===Ratnas===\n\n[[File:Sagar Manthan.jpg|thumb|Sagar Manthana]]\nAll kinds of herbs were cast into the ocean and fourteen [[wikt:ratna|Ratna]]s (gems or treasures) were produced from it and were divided between the Asuras and the Devas.

Fierce fighting ensued between the Devas and the Asuras for it. To protect it from the Asuras, [[Garuda]] took the pot and flew away from the battlefield.\n\nThe Devas appealed to Vishnu, who took the form of [[Mohini]] and, as a beautiful and enchanting damsel, distracted the Asuras; then, she took the am\u1e5bta and distributed it among the Devas, who drank it. An Asura named [[Svarbhanu]] disguised himself as a deva and drank some nectar. Due to their luminous nature, the Sun god [[Surya]] and the moon god [[Chandra]] noticed this disguise. They informed [[Mohini]] who before the nectar could pass the Asura's throat, cut off his head with her discus, the [[Sudarshana Chakra]]. From that day, his head was called [[Rahu]] and his body [[Ketu (mythology)|Ketu]], which both later became planets. The story ends with the rejuvenated Devas defeating the Asuras and that's why the eclipse mode of the moon means Rahu swallows moon as his revenge. Although, rahu only has a head and no body.

If the signature is valid, and the software examining the certificate trusts the issuer, then it can use that key to communicate securely with the certificate's subject. In [[email encryption]], [[code signing]], and [[Electronic signature|e-signature]] systems, a certificate's subject is typically a person or organization. However, in [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS) a certificate's subject is typically a computer or other device, though TLS certificates may identify organizations or individuals in addition to their core role in identifying devices. TLS, sometimes called by its older name Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is notable for being a part of [[HTTPS]], a [[Communications protocol|protocol]] for securely browsing the [[World Wide Web|web]].\n\nIn a typical [[public-key infrastructure]] (PKI) scheme, the certificate issuer is a [[certificate authority]] (CA), usually a company that charges customers to issue certificates for them. By contrast, in a [[web of trust]] scheme, individuals sign each other's keys directly, in a format that performs a similar function to a public key certificate.\n\nThe most common format for public key certificates is defined by [[X.509]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ssltrust.com.au/help/setup-guides/client-certificate-authentication|title=Using Client-Certificate based authentication with NGINX on Ubuntu - SSLTrust|website=SSLTrust|accessdate=26 March 2019}}</ref> Because X.509 is very general, the format is further constrained by profiles defined for certain use cases, such as [[PKIX|Public Key Infrastructure (X.509)]] as defined in <nowiki>RFC 5280</nowiki>.\n\n== Types of certificate ==\n[[File:Chain_of_trust.svg|lang=en|thumb|400px|The roles of root certificate, intermediate certificate and end-entity certificate as in the [[chain of trust]].]]\n\n=== TLS/SSL server certificate ===\nIn TLS (an updated replacement for SSL), a [[Client\u2013server model|server]]  is required to present a certificate as part of the initial connection setup. A [[Client\u2013server model|client]] connecting to that server will perform the [[certification path validation algorithm]]:\n# The subject of the certificate matches the [[hostname]] (i.e. domain name) to which the client is trying to connect;\n# The certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority.\n\nThe primary hostname ([[domain name]] of the website) is listed as the '''Common Name''' in the '''Subject''' field of the certificate. A certificate may be valid for multiple hostnames (multiple websites). Such certificates are commonly called '''Subject Alternative Name (SAN) certificates''' or '''Unified Communications Certificates (UCC)'''. These certificates contain the field [[Subject Alternative Name]], though many CAs will also put them into the '''Subject Common Name''' field for backward compatibility. If some of the hostnames contain an asterisk (*), a certificate may also be called a [[wildcard certificate]].\n\nA TLS server may be configured with a self-signed certificate. When that is the case, clients will generally be unable to verify the certificate, and will terminate the connection unless certificate checking is disabled.\n\nAs per the applications, SSL Certificates can be classified into three types:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comparecheapssl.com/types-of-ssl-certificate/|title=Types of SSL Certificate|website=comparecheapssl.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-20}}</ref>\n\n* Domain Validation SSL;\n* Organization Validation SSL;\n* Extended Validation SSL.\n\n=== TLS/SSL client certificate ===\nClient certificates are less common than server certificates, and are used to authenticate the client connecting to a TLS service, for instance to provide access control. Because most services provide access to individuals, rather than devices, most client certificates contain an email address or personal name rather than a hostname. Also, because authentication is usually managed by the service provider, client certificates are not usually issued by a public CA that provides server certificates. Instead, the operator of a service that requires client certificates will usually operate their own internal CA to issue them. Client certificates are supported by many web browsers, but most services use passwords and cookies to authenticate users, instead of client certificates.\n\nClient certificates are more common in [[Remote procedure call|RPC]] systems, where they are used to authenticate devices to ensure that only authorized devices can make certain RPC calls.\n\n=== Email certificate ===\nIn the [[S/MIME]] protocol for secure email, senders need to discover which public key to use for any given recipient. They get this information from an email certificate. Some publicly trusted certificate authorities provide email certificates, but more commonly S/MIME is used when communicating within a given organization, and that organization runs its own CA, which is trusted by participants in that email system.\n\n=== EMV certificate ===\n[[EMV|EMV]] payment cards are preloaded with EMV Certificate, Card Issuer Certificate, signed by EMV Certificate Authority<ref name=\"Certs\u201d>{{cite web | url= https://emvca.com/index.html#EMV-CA |title=EMV CA|date=2 December 2010 |publisher=EMV Certificate Authority Worldwide |accessdate=January 20, 2020}}</ref>  to validate authenticity of the payment card during the payment transaction. EMV CA Certificate public key is loaded on [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] or [[Point_of_sale|POS]] and used for validating Card Issuer Certificate.\n\n=== Code signing certificate ===\n{{Main|Code signing}}\nCertificates can also be used to validate signatures on programs to ensure they were not tampered with during delivery.\n\n=== Qualified certificate ===\n{{Main|Qualified digital certificate}}\nA certificate identifying an individual, typically for [[electronic signature]] purposes. These are most commonly used in Europe, where the [[eIDAS]] regulation standardizes them and requires their recognition.\n\n=== Root certificate ===\n{{Main|Root certificate}}\nA self-signed certificate used to sign other certificates. Also sometimes called a '''trust anchor'''.\n\n=== Intermediate certificate ===\nA certificate used to sign other certificates. An intermediate certificate must be signed by another intermediate certificate, or a root certificate.\n\n=== End-entity or leaf certificate ===\nAny certificate that cannot be used to sign other certificates. For instance, TLS/SSL server and client certificates, email certificates, code signing certificates, and qualified certificates are all end-entity certificates.\n\n=== Self-signed certificate ===\n{{Main|Self-signed certificate}}\nA certificate with a subject that matches its issuer, and a signature that can be verified by its own public key. Most types of certificate can be self-signed. Self-signed certificates are also often called '''[[Snake oil (cryptography)|snake oil]] certificates''' to emphasize their untrustworthiness.\n\n==Common fields==\n{{see also|X.509#Structure of a certificate}}These are some of the most common fields in certificates. Most certificates contain a number of fields not listed here. Note that in terms of a certificate's X.509 representation, a certificate is not \"flat\" but contains these fields nested in various structures within the certificate.\n* '''Serial Number''': Used to uniquely identify the certificate within a CA's systems. In particular this is used to track revocation information.\n* '''Subject''': The entity a certificate belongs to: a machine, an individual, or an organization.\n* '''Issuer''': The entity that verified the information and signed the certificate.\n* '''Not Before''': The earliest time and date on which the certificate is valid. Usually set to a few hours or days prior to the moment the certificate was issued, to avoid [[Clock skew#On a network|clock skew]] problems.\n* '''Not After''': The time and date past which the certificate is no longer valid.\n* '''Key Usage''': The valid cryptographic uses of the certificate's public key. Common values include digital signature validation, key encipherment, and certificate signing.\n* '''Extended Key Usage''': The applications in which the certificate may be used. Common values include TLS server authentication, email protection, and code signing.\n* '''Public Key''': A public key belonging to the certificate subject.\n* '''Signature Algorithm''': The algorithm used to [[Digital signature|sign]] the public key certificate.\n* '''Signature''': A signature of the certificate body by the issuer's private key.\n\n==Sample certificate==\nThis is an example of a decoded SSL/TLS certificate retrieved from SSL.com's website. The issuer's common name (CN) is shown as <code>SSL.com EV SSL Intermediate CA RSA R3</code>, identifying this as an [[Extended Validation Certificate|Extended Validation]] (EV) certificate. Validated information about the website's owner (SSL Corp) is located in the <code>Subject</code> field. The <code>X509v3 Subject Alternative Name</code> field contains a list of domain names covered by the certificate. The <code>X509v3 Extended Key Usage</code> and <code>X509v3 Key Usage</code> fields show all appropriate uses.\n<pre>\nCertificate:\n    Data:\n        Version: 3 (0x2)\n        Serial Number:\n            72:14:11:d3:d7:e0:fd:02:aa:b0:4e:90:09:d4:db:31\n        Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption\n        Issuer: C=US, ST=Texas, L=Houston, O=SSL Corp, CN=SSL.com EV SSL Intermediate CA RSA R3\n        Validity\n            Not Before: Apr 18 22:15:06 2019 GMT\n            Not After : Apr 17 22:15:06 2021 GMT\n        Subject: C=US, ST=Texas, L=Houston, O=SSL Corp/serialNumber=NV20081614243, CN=www.ssl.com/postalCode=77098/businessCategory=Private Organization/street=3100 Richmond Ave/jurisdictionST=Nevada/jurisdictionC=US\n        Subject Public Key Info:\n            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption\n                RSA Public-Key: (2048 bit)\n                Modulus:\n                    00:ad:0f:ef:c1:97:5a:9b:d8:1e ...\n                Exponent: 65537 (0x10001)\n        X509v3 extensions:\n            X509v3 Authority Key Identifier: \n                keyid:BF:C1:5A:87:FF:28:FA:41:3D:FD:B7:4F:E4:1D:AF:A0:61:58:29:BD\n\n            Authority Information Access: \n                CA Issuers - URI:http://www.ssl.com/repository/SSLcom-SubCA-EV-SSL-RSA-4096-R3.crt\n                OCSP - URI:http://ocsps.ssl.com\n\n            X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: \n                DNS:www.ssl.com, DNS:answers.ssl.com, DNS:faq.ssl.com, DNS:info.ssl.com, DNS:links.ssl.com, DNS:reseller.ssl.com, DNS:secure.ssl.com, DNS:ssl.com, DNS:support.ssl.com, DNS:sws.ssl.com, DNS:tools.ssl.com\n            X509v3 Certificate Policies: \n                Policy: 2.23.140.1.1\n                Policy: 1.2.616.1.113527.2.5.1.1\n                Policy: 1.3.6.1.4.1.38064.1.1.1.5\n                  CPS: https://www.ssl.com/repository\n\n            X509v3 Extended Key Usage: \n                TLS Web Client Authentication, TLS Web Server Authentication\n            X509v3 CRL Distribution Points: \n\n                Full Name:\n                  URI:http://crls.ssl.com/SSLcom-SubCA-EV-SSL-RSA-4096-R3.crl\n\n            X509v3 Subject Key Identifier: \n                E7:37:48:DE:7D:C2:E1:9D:D0:11:25:21:B8:00:33:63:06:27:C1:5B\n            X509v3 Key Usage: critical\n                Digital Signature, Key Encipherment\n            CT Precertificate SCTs: \n                Signed Certificate Timestamp:\n                    Version   : v1 (0x0)\n                    Log ID    : 87:75:BF:E7:59:7C:F8:8C:43:99 ...\n                    Timestamp : Apr 18 22:25:08.574 2019 GMT\n                    Extensions: none\n                    Signature : ecdsa-with-SHA256\n                                30:44:02:20:40:51:53:90:C6:A2 ...\n                Signed Certificate Timestamp:\n                    Version   : v1 (0x0)\n                    Log ID    : A4:B9:09:90:B4:18:58:14:87:BB ...\n                    Timestamp : Apr 18 22:25:08.461 2019 GMT\n                    Extensions: none\n                    Signature : ecdsa-with-SHA256\n                                30:45:02:20:43:80:9E:19:90:FD ...\n                Signed Certificate Timestamp:\n                    Version   : v1 (0x0)\n                    Log ID    : 55:81:D4:C2:16:90:36:01:4A:EA ...\n                    Timestamp : Apr 18 22:25:08.769 2019 GMT\n                    Extensions: none\n                    Signature : ecdsa-with-SHA256\n                                30:45:02:21:00:C1:3E:9F:F0:40 ...\n    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption\n         36:07:e7:3b:b7:45:97:ca:4d:6c ...\n</pre>\n\n==Usage in the European Union==\nIn the European Union, [[electronic signature]]s on legal documents are commonly performed using [[digital signature]]s with accompanying identity certificates. This is largely because such signatures are granted the same enforceability as handwritten signatures under [[eIDAS]], an [[Regulation (European Union)|EU regulation]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Certificate authorities==\n{{Main|Certificate authority}}\n[[File:PublicKeyCertificateDiagram It.svg|lang=en|550px|thumb|right|The procedure of obtaining a Public key certificate]]\nIn the [[X.509]] trust model, a certificate authority (CA) is responsible for signing certificates. These certificates act as an introduction between two parties, which means that a CA acts as a trusted third party. A CA processes requests from people or organizations requesting certificates (called subscribers), verifies the information, and potentially signs an end-entity certificate based on that information. To perform this role effectively, a CA needs to have one or more broadly trusted root certificates or intermediate certificates and the corresponding private keys. CAs may achieve this broad trust by having their root certificates included in popular software, or by obtaining a cross-signature from another CA delegating trust. Other CAs are trusted within a relatively small community, like a business, and are distributed by other mechanisms like Windows [[Group Policy]].\n\nCertificate authorities are also responsible for maintaining up-to-date revocation information about certificates they have issued, indicating whether certificates are still valid. They provide this information through [[Online Certificate Status Protocol]] (OCSP) and/or Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).\n\n== Root programs ==\nSome major software contain a list of certificate authorities that are trusted by default. This makes it easier for end-users to validate certificates, and easier for people or organizations that request certificates to know which certificate authorities can issue a certificate that will be broadly trusted. This is particularly important in HTTPS, where a web site operator generally wants to get a certificate that is trusted by nearly all potential visitors to their web site.\n\nThe policies and processes a provider uses to decide which certificate authorities their software should trust are called root programs. The most influential root programs are:\n* [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc751157.aspx Microsoft Root Program]\n* [https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/ca_program.html Apple Root Program]\n* [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/policy/ Mozilla Root Program]\n* [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/javasecarootcertsprogram-1876540.html Oracle Java root program]\n* Adobe [https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/approved-trust-list2.html AATL] Adobe Approved Trust List and [https://blogs.adobe.com/documentcloud/eu-trusted-list-now-available-in-adobe-acrobat/ EUTL] root programs (used for document signing)\n\nBrowsers other than Firefox generally use the operating system's facilities to decide which certificate authorities are trusted. So, for instance, Chrome on Windows trusts the certificate authorities included in the Microsoft Root Program, while on macOS or iOS, Chrome trusts the certificate authorities in the Apple Root Program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy|title=Root Certificate Policy \u2013 The Chromium Projects|website=www.chromium.org|access-date=2017-03-19}}</ref> Edge and Safari use their respective operating system trust stores as well, but each is only available on a single OS. Firefox uses the Mozilla Root Program trust store on all platforms.\n\nThe Mozilla Root Program is operated publicly, and its certificate list is part of the [[Open-source software|open source]] Firefox web browser, so it is broadly used outside Firefox. For instance, while there is no common Linux Root Program, many Linux distributions, like Debian,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://launchpad.net/ca-certificates|title=ca-certificates in Launchpad|website=launchpad.net|language=en|access-date=2017-03-19}}</ref> include a package that periodically copies the contents of the Firefox trust list, which is then used by applications.\n\nRoot programs generally provide a set of valid purposes with the certificates they include. For instance, some CAs may be considered trusted for issuing TLS server certificates, but not for code signing certificates. This is indicated with a set of trust bits in a root certificate storage system.\n\n==Certificates and website security==\n\nThe most common use of certificates is for [[HTTPS]]-based web sites. A [[web browser]] validates that an HTTPS [[web server]] is authentic, so that the user can feel secure that his/her interaction with the [[web site]] has no eavesdroppers and that the web site is who it claims to be. This security is important for [[electronic commerce]]. In practice, a web site operator obtains a certificate by applying to a certificate authority with a [[certificate signing request]]. The certificate request is an electronic document that contains the web site name, company information and the public key. The certificate provider signs the request, thus producing a public certificate. During web browsing, this public certificate is served to any web browser that connects to the web site and proves to the web browser that the provider believes it has issued a certificate to the owner of the web site.\n\nAs an example, when a user connects to <code><nowiki>https://www.example.com/</nowiki></code> with their browser, if the browser does not  give any certificate warning message, then the user can be theoretically sure that interacting with <code><nowiki>https://www.example.com/</nowiki></code> is equivalent to interacting with the entity in contact with the email address listed in the public registrar under \"example.com\", even though that email address may not be displayed anywhere on the web site. No other surety of any kind is implied. Further, the relationship between the purchaser of the certificate, the operator of the web site, and the generator of the web site content may be tenuous and is not guaranteed. At best, the certificate guarantees uniqueness of the web site, provided that the web site itself has not been compromised (hacked) or the certificate issuing process subverted.\n\nA certificate provider can opt to issue three types of certificates, each requiring its own degree of vetting rigor.  In order of increasing rigor (and naturally, cost) they are: Domain Validation, Organization Validation and Extended Validation.  These rigors are loosely agreed upon by voluntary participants in the [[CA/Browser Forum]].\n\n=== Validation levels ===\n\n====Domain validation====\n{{Main|Domain-validated certificate}}\nA certificate provider will issue a Domain Validation (DV) class certificate to a purchaser if the purchaser can demonstrate one vetting criterion:  the right to administratively manage a domain name.\n\n====Organization validation====\n\nA certificate provider will issue an Organization Validation (OV) class certificate to a purchaser if the purchaser can meet two criteria:  the right to administratively manage the domain name in question, and perhaps, the organization's actual existence as a legal entity.  A certificate provider publishes its OV vetting criteria through its [[Certificate Policy]].\n\n====Extended validation====\n{{Main|Extended Validation Certificate}}\nTo acquire an [[Extended Validation Certificate|Extended Validation]] (EV) certificate, the purchaser must persuade the certificate provider of its legal identity, including manual verification checks by a human. As with OV certificates, a certificate provider publishes its EV vetting criteria through its [[Certificate Policy]].\n\nBrowsers will generally offer users a visual indication of the legal identity when a site presents an EV certificate.  Most browsers show the legal name before the domain, and use a bright green color to highlight the change.  In this way, the user can see the legal identity of the owner has been verified.\n\n===Weaknesses===\n\nA [[web browser]] will give no warning to the user if a web site suddenly presents a different certificate, even if that certificate has a lower number of key bits, even if it has a different provider, and even if the previous certificate had an expiry date far into the future.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} However a change from an EV certificate to a non-EV certificate will be apparent as the green bar will no longer be displayed. Where certificate providers are under the jurisdiction of governments, those governments may have the freedom to order the provider to generate any certificate, such as for the purposes of law enforcement. Subsidiary wholesale certificate providers also have the freedom to generate any certificate.\n\nAll web browsers come with an extensive built-in list of trusted [[root certificate]]s, many of which are controlled by organizations that may be unfamiliar to the user.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=List of certificates included by Mozilla|url=https://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/included/|publisher=Mozilla.org|accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>  Each of these organizations is free to issue any certificate for any web site and have the guarantee that web browsers that include its root certificates will accept it as genuine. In this instance, end users must rely on the developer of the browser software to manage its built-in list of certificates and on the certificate providers to behave correctly and to inform the browser developer of problematic certificates. While uncommon, there have been incidents in which fraudulent certificates have been issued: in some cases, the browsers have detected the fraud; in others, some time passed before browser developers removed these certificates from their software.<ref>{{cite web|title=DigiNotar removal by Mozilla|url=https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2011/09/02/diginotar-removal-follow-up/|publisher=Mozilla.org|accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=DigitNotar removal by Google|url=http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2011/08/update-on-attempted-man-in-middle.html|publisher=Google.com|accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe list of built-in certificates is also not limited to those provided by the browser developer: users (and to a degree applications) are free to extend the list for special purposes such as for company intranets.<ref>{{cite web|title=Using certificates article at Mozilla.org|url=https://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/psm/help_21/using_certs_help.html|publisher=Mozilla.org|accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>  This means that if someone gains access to a machine and can install a new root certificate in the browser, that browser will recognize websites that use the inserted certificate as legitimate.\n\nFor [[provable security]], this reliance on something external to the system has the consequence that any public key certification scheme has to rely on some special setup assumption, such as the existence of a [[certificate authority]].<ref>Ran Canetti: Universally Composable Signature, Certification, and Authentication. CSFW 2004, http://eprint.iacr.org/2003/239</ref>\n\n===Usefulness versus unsecured web sites===\n\nIn spite of the limitations described above, certificate-authenticated TLS is considered mandatory by all security guidelines whenever a web site hosts confidential information or performs material transactions. This is because, in practice, in spite of the [[#Weaknesses|weaknesses]] described above, web sites secured by public key certificates are still more secure than unsecured [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|http://]] web sites.<ref>{{cite journal |author=[[Ben Laurie]], [[Ian Goldberg]] |date={{date|2014-01-18}} |title=Replacing passwords on the Internet AKA post-Snowden Opportunistic Encryption |conference=W3C STRINT Workshop 2014 |url=https://www.w3.org/2014/strint/papers/46.pdf }}</ref>\n\n== Standards ==\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology([[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]) Computer Security Division<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html|title=NIST Computer Security Publications \u2013 NIST Special Publications (SPs)|website=csrc.nist.gov|access-date=2016-06-19}}</ref> provides guidance documents for Public Key Certificates:\n* SP 800-32 Introduction to Public Key Technology and the Federal PKI Infrastructure<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-32.pdf|title=SP 800-32 Introduction to Public Key Technology and the Federal PKI Infrastructure|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n* SP 800-25 Federal Agency Use of Public Key Technology for Digital Signatures and Authentication<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-25.pdf|title=SP 800-25 Federal Agency Use of Public Key Technology for Digital Signatures and Authentication[1]|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Authorization certificate]]\n*[[Pretty Good Privacy]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n{{SSL/TLS}}\n\n[[Category:Public-key cryptography]]\n[[Category:Key management]]\n[[Category:Public key infrastructure]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Identity certificate}}\n{{short description|Electronic document used to prove the ownership of a public key}}\n[[File:Client and Server Certificate.png|thumb|right|350px|Client and server certificate of *.wikipedia.org]]\nIn [[cryptography]], a '''public key certificate,''' also known as a '''digital certificate''' or '''identity certificate,''' is an electronic document used to prove the ownership of a [[Key authentication|public key]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The certificate includes information about the key, information about the identity of its owner (called the subject), and the [[digital signature]] of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents (called the issuer). If the signature is valid, and the software examining the certificate trusts the issuer, then it can use that key to communicate securely with the certificate's subject. In [[email encryption]], [[code signing]], and [[Electronic signature|e-signature]] systems, a certificate's subject is typically a person or organization. However, in [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS) a certificate's subject is typically a computer or other device, though TLS certificates may identify organizations or individuals in addition to their core role in identifying devices. TLS, sometimes called by its older name Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), is notable for being a part of [[HTTPS]], a [[Communications protocol|protocol]] for securely browsing the [[World Wide Web|web]].\n\nIn a typical [[public-key infrastructure]] (PKI) scheme, the certificate issuer is a [[certificate authority]] (CA), usually a company that charges customers to issue certificates for them. By contrast, in a [[web of trust]] scheme, individuals sign each other's keys directly, in a format that performs a similar function to a public key certificate.\n\nThe most common format for public key certificates is defined by [[X.509]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ssltrust.com.au/help/setup-guides/client-certificate-authentication|title=Using Client-Certificate based authentication with NGINX on Ubuntu - SSLTrust|website=SSLTrust|accessdate=26 March 2019}}</ref> Because X.509 is very general, the format is further constrained by profiles defined for certain use cases, such as [[PKIX|Public Key Infrastructure (X.509)]] as defined in <nowiki>RFC 5280</nowiki>.\n\n== Types of certificate ==\n[[File:Chain_of_trust.svg|lang=en|thumb|400px|The roles of root certificate, intermediate certificate and end-entity certificate as in the [[chain of trust]].]]\n\n=== TLS/SSL server certificate ===\nIn TLS (an updated replacement for SSL), a [[Client\u2013server model|server]]  is required to present a certificate as part of the initial connection setup. A [[Client\u2013server model|client]] connecting to that server will perform the [[certification path validation algorithm]]:\n# The subject of the certificate matches the [[hostname]] (i.e. domain name) to which the client is trying to connect;\n# The certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority.\n\nThe primary hostname ([[domain name]] of the website) is listed as the '''Common Name''' in the '''Subject''' field of the certificate. A certificate may be valid for multiple hostnames (multiple websites). Such certificates are commonly called '''Subject Alternative Name (SAN) certificates''' or '''Unified Communications Certificates (UCC)'''. These certificates contain the field [[Subject Alternative Name]], though many CAs will also put them into the '''Subject Common Name''' field for backward compatibility. If some of the hostnames contain an asterisk (*), a certificate may also be called a [[wildcard certificate]].\n\nA TLS server may be configured with a self-signed certificate. When that is the case, clients will generally be unable to verify the certificate, and will terminate the connection unless certificate checking is disabled.\n\nAs per the applications, SSL Certificates can be classified into three types:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://comparecheapssl.com/types-of-ssl-certificate/|title=Types of SSL Certificate|website=comparecheapssl.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-20}}</ref>\n\n* Domain Validation SSL;\n* Organization Validation SSL;\n* Extended Validation SSL.\n\n=== TLS/SSL client certificate ===\nClient certificates are less common than server certificates, and are used to authenticate the client connecting to a TLS service, for instance to provide access control. Because most services provide access to individuals, rather than devices, most client certificates contain an email address or personal name rather than a hostname. Also, because authentication is usually managed by the service provider, client certificates are not usually issued by a public CA that provides server certificates. Instead, the operator of a service that requires client certificates will usually operate their own internal CA to issue them. Client certificates are supported by many web browsers, but most services use passwords and cookies to authenticate users, instead of client certificates.\n\nClient certificates are more common in [[Remote procedure call|RPC]] systems, where they are used to authenticate devices to ensure that only authorized devices can make certain RPC calls.\n\n=== Email certificate ===\nIn the [[S/MIME]] protocol for secure email, senders need to discover which public key to use for any given recipient. They get this information from an email certificate. Some publicly trusted certificate authorities provide email certificates, but more commonly S/MIME is used when communicating within a given organization, and that organization runs its own CA, which is trusted by participants in that email system.\n\n=== EMV certificate ===\n[[EMV|EMV]] payment cards are preloaded with EMV Certificate, Card Issuer Certificate, signed by EMV Certificate Authority<ref name=\"Certs\u201d>{{cite web | url= https://emvca.com/index.html#EMV-CA |title=EMV CA|date=2 December 2010 |publisher=EMV Certificate Authority Worldwide |accessdate=January 20, 2020}}</ref>  to validate authenticity of the payment card during the payment transaction.

Self-signed certificates are also often called '''[[Snake oil (cryptography)|snake oil]] certificates''' to emphasize their untrustworthiness.\n\n==Common fields==\n{{see also|X.509#Structure of a certificate}}These are some of the most common fields in certificates. Most certificates contain a number of fields not listed here. Note that in terms of a certificate's X.509 representation, a certificate is not \"flat\" but contains these fields nested in various structures within the certificate.\n* '''Serial Number''': Used to uniquely identify the certificate within a CA's systems. In particular this is used to track revocation information.\n* '''Subject''': The entity a certificate belongs to: a machine, an individual, or an organization.\n* '''Issuer''': The entity that verified the information and signed the certificate.\n* '''Not Before''': The earliest time and date on which the certificate is valid. Usually set to a few hours or days prior to the moment the certificate was issued, to avoid [[Clock skew#On a network|clock skew]] problems.\n* '''Not After''': The time and date past which the certificate is no longer valid.\n* '''Key Usage''': The valid cryptographic uses of the certificate's public key. Common values include digital signature validation, key encipherment, and certificate signing.\n* '''Extended Key Usage''': The applications in which the certificate may be used. Common values include TLS server authentication, email protection, and code signing.\n* '''Public Key''': A public key belonging to the certificate subject.\n* '''Signature Algorithm''': The algorithm used to [[Digital signature|sign]] the public key certificate.\n* '''Signature''': A signature of the certificate body by the issuer's private key.\n\n==Sample certificate==\nThis is an example of a decoded SSL/TLS certificate retrieved from SSL.com's website. The issuer's common name (CN) is shown as <code>SSL.com EV SSL Intermediate CA RSA R3</code>, identifying this as an [[Extended Validation Certificate|Extended Validation]] (EV) certificate. Validated information about the website's owner (SSL Corp) is located in the <code>Subject</code> field. The <code>X509v3 Subject Alternative Name</code> field contains a list of domain names covered by the certificate. The <code>X509v3 Extended Key Usage</code> and <code>X509v3 Key Usage</code> fields show all appropriate uses.\n<pre>\nCertificate:\n    Data:\n        Version: 3 (0x2)\n        Serial Number:\n            72:14:11:d3:d7:e0:fd:02:aa:b0:4e:90:09:d4:db:31\n        Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption\n        Issuer: C=US, ST=Texas, L=Houston, O=SSL Corp, CN=SSL.com EV SSL Intermediate CA RSA R3\n        Validity\n            Not Before: Apr 18 22:15:06 2019 GMT\n            Not After : Apr 17 22:15:06 2021 GMT\n        Subject: C=US, ST=Texas, L=Houston, O=SSL Corp/serialNumber=NV20081614243, CN=www.ssl.com/postalCode=77098/businessCategory=Private Organization/street=3100 Richmond Ave/jurisdictionST=Nevada/jurisdictionC=US\n        Subject Public Key Info:\n            Public Key Algorithm: rsaEncryption\n                RSA Public-Key: (2048 bit)\n                Modulus:\n                    00:ad:0f:ef:c1:97:5a:9b:d8:1e ...\n                Exponent: 65537 (0x10001)\n        X509v3 extensions:\n            X509v3 Authority Key Identifier: \n                keyid:BF:C1:5A:87:FF:28:FA:41:3D:FD:B7:4F:E4:1D:AF:A0:61:58:29:BD\n\n            Authority Information Access: \n                CA Issuers - URI:http://www.ssl.com/repository/SSLcom-SubCA-EV-SSL-RSA-4096-R3.crt\n                OCSP - URI:http://ocsps.ssl.com\n\n            X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: \n                DNS:www.ssl.com, DNS:answers.ssl.com, DNS:faq.ssl.com, DNS:info.ssl.com, DNS:links.ssl.com, DNS:reseller.ssl.com, DNS:secure.ssl.com, DNS:ssl.com, DNS:support.ssl.com, DNS:sws.ssl.com, DNS:tools.ssl.com\n            X509v3 Certificate Policies: \n                Policy: 2.23.140.1.1\n                Policy: 1.2.616.1.113527.2.5.1.1\n                Policy: 1.3.6.1.4.1.38064.1.1.1.5\n                  CPS: https://www.ssl.com/repository\n\n            X509v3 Extended Key Usage: \n                TLS Web Client Authentication, TLS Web Server Authentication\n            X509v3 CRL Distribution Points: \n\n                Full Name:\n                  URI:http://crls.ssl.com/SSLcom-SubCA-EV-SSL-RSA-4096-R3.crl\n\n            X509v3 Subject Key Identifier: \n                E7:37:48:DE:7D:C2:E1:9D:D0:11:25:21:B8:00:33:63:06:27:C1:5B\n            X509v3 Key Usage: critical\n                Digital Signature, Key Encipherment\n            CT Precertificate SCTs: \n                Signed Certificate Timestamp:\n                    Version   : v1 (0x0)\n                    Log ID    : 87:75:BF:E7:59:7C:F8:8C:43:99 ...\n                    Timestamp : Apr 18 22:25:08.574 2019 GMT\n                    Extensions: none\n                    Signature : ecdsa-with-SHA256\n                                30:44:02:20:40:51:53:90:C6:A2 ...\n                Signed Certificate Timestamp:\n                    Version   : v1 (0x0)\n                    Log ID    : A4:B9:09:90:B4:18:58:14:87:BB ...\n                    Timestamp : Apr 18 22:25:08.461 2019 GMT\n                    Extensions: none\n                    Signature : ecdsa-with-SHA256\n                                30:45:02:20:43:80:9E:19:90:FD ...\n                Signed Certificate Timestamp:\n                    Version   : v1 (0x0)\n                    Log ID    : 55:81:D4:C2:16:90:36:01:4A:EA ...\n                    Timestamp : Apr 18 22:25:08.769 2019 GMT\n                    Extensions: none\n                    Signature : ecdsa-with-SHA256\n                                30:45:02:21:00:C1:3E:9F:F0:40 ...\n    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption\n         36:07:e7:3b:b7:45:97:ca:4d:6c ...\n</pre>\n\n==Usage in the European Union==\nIn the European Union, [[electronic signature]]s on legal documents are commonly performed using [[digital signature]]s with accompanying identity certificates. This is largely because such signatures are granted the same enforceability as handwritten signatures under [[eIDAS]], an [[Regulation (European Union)|EU regulation]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Certificate authorities==\n{{Main|Certificate authority}}\n[[File:PublicKeyCertificateDiagram It.svg|lang=en|550px|thumb|right|The procedure of obtaining a Public key certificate]]\nIn the [[X.509]] trust model, a certificate authority (CA) is responsible for signing certificates. These certificates act as an introduction between two parties, which means that a CA acts as a trusted third party. A CA processes requests from people or organizations requesting certificates (called subscribers), verifies the information, and potentially signs an end-entity certificate based on that information. To perform this role effectively, a CA needs to have one or more broadly trusted root certificates or intermediate certificates and the corresponding private keys. CAs may achieve this broad trust by having their root certificates included in popular software, or by obtaining a cross-signature from another CA delegating trust. Other CAs are trusted within a relatively small community, like a business, and are distributed by other mechanisms like Windows [[Group Policy]].\n\nCertificate authorities are also responsible for maintaining up-to-date revocation information about certificates they have issued, indicating whether certificates are still valid. They provide this information through [[Online Certificate Status Protocol]] (OCSP) and/or Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).\n\n== Root programs ==\nSome major software contain a list of certificate authorities that are trusted by default. This makes it easier for end-users to validate certificates, and easier for people or organizations that request certificates to know which certificate authorities can issue a certificate that will be broadly trusted. This is particularly important in HTTPS, where a web site operator generally wants to get a certificate that is trusted by nearly all potential visitors to their web site.\n\nThe policies and processes a provider uses to decide which certificate authorities their software should trust are called root programs. The most influential root programs are:\n* [https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc751157.aspx Microsoft Root Program]\n* [https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/ca_program.html Apple Root Program]\n* [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/policy/ Mozilla Root Program]\n* [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/javasecarootcertsprogram-1876540.html Oracle Java root program]\n* Adobe [https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/approved-trust-list2.html AATL] Adobe Approved Trust List and [https://blogs.adobe.com/documentcloud/eu-trusted-list-now-available-in-adobe-acrobat/ EUTL] root programs (used for document signing)\n\nBrowsers other than Firefox generally use the operating system's facilities to decide which certificate authorities are trusted. So, for instance, Chrome on Windows trusts the certificate authorities included in the Microsoft Root Program, while on macOS or iOS, Chrome trusts the certificate authorities in the Apple Root Program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy|title=Root Certificate Policy \u2013 The Chromium Projects|website=www.chromium.org|access-date=2017-03-19}}</ref> Edge and Safari use their respective operating system trust stores as well, but each is only available on a single OS. Firefox uses the Mozilla Root Program trust store on all platforms.\n\nThe Mozilla Root Program is operated publicly, and its certificate list is part of the [[Open-source software|open source]] Firefox web browser, so it is broadly used outside Firefox. For instance, while there is no common Linux Root Program, many Linux distributions, like Debian,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://launchpad.net/ca-certificates|title=ca-certificates in Launchpad|website=launchpad.net|language=en|access-date=2017-03-19}}</ref> include a package that periodically copies the contents of the Firefox trust list, which is then used by applications.\n\nRoot programs generally provide a set of valid purposes with the certificates they include. For instance, some CAs may be considered trusted for issuing TLS server certificates, but not for code signing certificates. This is indicated with a set of trust bits in a root certificate storage system.\n\n==Certificates and website security==\n\nThe most common use of certificates is for [[HTTPS]]-based web sites. A [[web browser]] validates that an HTTPS [[web server]] is authentic, so that the user can feel secure that his/her interaction with the [[web site]] has no eavesdroppers and that the web site is who it claims to be. This security is important for [[electronic commerce]]. In practice, a web site operator obtains a certificate by applying to a certificate authority with a [[certificate signing request]]. The certificate request is an electronic document that contains the web site name, company information and the public key. The certificate provider signs the request, thus producing a public certificate. During web browsing, this public certificate is served to any web browser that connects to the web site and proves to the web browser that the provider believes it has issued a certificate to the owner of the web site.\n\nAs an example, when a user connects to <code><nowiki>https://www.example.com/</nowiki></code> with their browser, if the browser does not  give any certificate warning message, then the user can be theoretically sure that interacting with <code><nowiki>https://www.example.com/</nowiki></code> is equivalent to interacting with the entity in contact with the email address listed in the public registrar under \"example.com\", even though that email address may not be displayed anywhere on the web site. No other surety of any kind is implied. Further, the relationship between the purchaser of the certificate, the operator of the web site, and the generator of the web site content may be tenuous and is not guaranteed. At best, the certificate guarantees uniqueness of the web site, provided that the web site itself has not been compromised (hacked) or the certificate issuing process subverted.\n\nA certificate provider can opt to issue three types of certificates, each requiring its own degree of vetting rigor.  In order of increasing rigor (and naturally, cost) they are: Domain Validation, Organization Validation and Extended Validation.  These rigors are loosely agreed upon by voluntary participants in the [[CA/Browser Forum]].\n\n=== Validation levels ===\n\n====Domain validation====\n{{Main|Domain-validated certificate}}\nA certificate provider will issue a Domain Validation (DV) class certificate to a purchaser if the purchaser can demonstrate one vetting criterion:  the right to administratively manage a domain name.\n\n====Organization validation====\n\nA certificate provider will issue an Organization Validation (OV) class certificate to a purchaser if the purchaser can meet two criteria:  the right to administratively manage the domain name in question, and perhaps, the organization's actual existence as a legal entity.  A certificate provider publishes its OV vetting criteria through its [[Certificate Policy]].\n\n====Extended validation====\n{{Main|Extended Validation Certificate}}\nTo acquire an [[Extended Validation Certificate|Extended Validation]] (EV) certificate, the purchaser must persuade the certificate provider of its legal identity, including manual verification checks by a human. As with OV certificates, a certificate provider publishes its EV vetting criteria through its [[Certificate Policy]].\n\nBrowsers will generally offer users a visual indication of the legal identity when a site presents an EV certificate.  Most browsers show the legal name before the domain, and use a bright green color to highlight the change.  In this way, the user can see the legal identity of the owner has been verified.\n\n===Weaknesses===\n\nA [[web browser]] will give no warning to the user if a web site suddenly presents a different certificate, even if that certificate has a lower number of key bits, even if it has a different provider, and even if the previous certificate had an expiry date far into the future.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} However a change from an EV certificate to a non-EV certificate will be apparent as the green bar will no longer be displayed. Where certificate providers are under the jurisdiction of governments, those governments may have the freedom to order the provider to generate any certificate, such as for the purposes of law enforcement. Subsidiary wholesale certificate providers also have the freedom to generate any certificate.\n\nAll web browsers come with an extensive built-in list of trusted [[root certificate]]s, many of which are controlled by organizations that may be unfamiliar to the user.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|title=List of certificates included by Mozilla|url=https://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/included/|publisher=Mozilla.org|accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>  Each of these organizations is free to issue any certificate for any web site and have the guarantee that web browsers that include its root certificates will accept it as genuine. In this instance, end users must rely on the developer of the browser software to manage its built-in list of certificates and on the certificate providers to behave correctly and to inform the browser developer of problematic certificates. While uncommon, there have been incidents in which fraudulent certificates have been issued: in some cases, the browsers have detected the fraud; in others, some time passed before browser developers removed these certificates from their software.<ref>{{cite web|title=DigiNotar removal by Mozilla|url=https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2011/09/02/diginotar-removal-follow-up/|publisher=Mozilla.org|accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=DigitNotar removal by Google|url=http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2011/08/update-on-attempted-man-in-middle.html|publisher=Google.com|accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe list of built-in certificates is also not limited to those provided by the browser developer: users (and to a degree applications) are free to extend the list for special purposes such as for company intranets.<ref>{{cite web|title=Using certificates article at Mozilla.org|url=https://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/psm/help_21/using_certs_help.html|publisher=Mozilla.org|accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref>  This means that if someone gains access to a machine and can install a new root certificate in the browser, that browser will recognize websites that use the inserted certificate as legitimate.\n\nFor [[provable security]], this reliance on something external to the system has the consequence that any public key certification scheme has to rely on some special setup assumption, such as the existence of a [[certificate authority]].<ref>Ran Canetti: Universally Composable Signature, Certification, and Authentication. CSFW 2004, http://eprint.iacr.org/2003/239</ref>\n\n===Usefulness versus unsecured web sites===\n\nIn spite of the limitations described above, certificate-authenticated TLS is considered mandatory by all security guidelines whenever a web site hosts confidential information or performs material transactions.
