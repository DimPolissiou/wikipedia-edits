The 4th Canadian Division was a part of the [[Canadian Corps]] in the [[Battle of Vimy Ridge]], which attacked and defeated the Germans, driving them from the ridge. As a result, the Canadians became known as masters of offensive warfare and an elite fighting force.<ref>Honey, K., (9 April 2002).

However, when they attempted to capture the hill, they were hampered by fire from the \"Pimple\", which was the other prominent height at Vimy Ridge. To capture Hill 145, forces which were supposed to attack the Pimple were redeployed and captured Hill 145.\n\n===Infantry units===\n'''10th Canadian Brigade:'''\n*[[44th Battalion (Manitoba), CEF|44th (Manitoba) Battalion Canadian Infantry]].

During the Battle of Falaise, Normandy, between 18\u201320 August 1944, Currie was in command of a small mixed force of tanks, self-propelled anti-tank guns and infantry which had been ordered to cut off one of the Germans' main escape routes.\n\nAfter Currie led the attack on the village of St. Lambert-sur-Dives and consolidated a position halfway inside it, he repulsed repeated enemy attacks over the next day and a half. Despite heavy casualties, Major Currie's command destroyed seven enemy tanks, twelve [[88 mm gun]]s and 40 vehicles, which led to the deaths of 300 German soldiers, 500 wounded and 1,100 captured. The remnants of two German armies were denied an escape route.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:Flamethrowerscheldt.jpg|Members of the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division demonstrating the use of [[flame thrower]]s across a canal, [[Maldegem]], October 1944.\nImage:Armoured cars in the Belgian-Dutch border town of Putte.jpg|Armoured cars in the Belgian-Dutch border town of Putte \u2013 11 October 1944\nImage:Major david currie vc.jpg|Major [[David Vivian Currie|David V.

However, when they attempted to capture the hill, they were hampered by fire from the \"Pimple\", which was the other prominent height at Vimy Ridge.

This was the only Victoria Cross awarded to a [[Canadians|Canadian]] soldier during the [[Operation Overlord|Normandy campaign]] (from 6 June 1944 to the end of August 1944), and the only VC ever awarded to a member of the [[Royal Canadian Armoured Corps]].\n\nThe then 32-year-old Currie was a Major in The South Alberta Regiment. During the Battle of Falaise, Normandy, between 18\u201320 August 1944, Currie was in command of a small mixed force of tanks, self-propelled anti-tank guns and infantry which had been ordered to cut off one of the Germans' main escape routes.\n\nAfter Currie led the attack on the village of St. Lambert-sur-Dives and consolidated a position halfway inside it, he repulsed repeated enemy attacks over the next day and a half. Despite heavy casualties, Major Currie's command destroyed seven enemy tanks, twelve [[88 mm gun]]s and 40 vehicles, which led to the deaths of 300 German soldiers, 500 wounded and 1,100 captured. The remnants of two German armies were denied an escape route.\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:Flamethrowerscheldt.jpg|Members of the 4th Canadian (Armoured) Division demonstrating the use of [[flame thrower]]s across a canal, [[Maldegem]], October 1944.\nImage:Armoured cars in the Belgian-Dutch border town of Putte.jpg|Armoured cars in the Belgian-Dutch border town of Putte \u2013 11 October 1944\nImage:Major david currie vc.jpg|Major [[David Vivian Currie|David V.

At that point in time, the six subordinate militia districts were reorganized into four: Northern Ontario District, London District, Toronto District, and Ottawa District each one garrisoned by a brigade of militia troops and a small number of regular support staff.<ref name=\"Domestic Military Organization 1900-1999\">{{cite web |title=Domestic Military Organization 1900\u20131999 |publisher=Canadian Soldiers.com |date=22 February 2013 |url=http://www.canadiansoldiers.com/organization/districts.htm}}</ref> Later that decade, in 1997, the four reserve force districts were again reorganized into three brigade groups.\n\nAt the time of its creation in the early-1990s, it was housed on the grounds of the former base and subsequently moved ca 1993 to the Place Nouveau office tower at [[Yonge Street]] north of [[Finch Avenue]]; this was controversial as the offices of the area commander, Major-General Brian Vernon, were lavishly renovated, attracting political criticism and attention from the [[Auditor General of Canada]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nIn 2013, the LFCA was renamed the \"4th Canadian Division\".
