It tells the story of [[Temple Drake]], a reckless woman in the [[Southern United States|American South]] who falls into the hands of a brutal gangster and rapist. It was adapted from the highly controversial novel ''[[Sanctuary (Faulkner novel)|Sanctuary]]'' by [[William Faulkner]]. Though some of the more salacious elements of the source novel were not included, the film was still considered so indecent that it helped give rise to the introduction of the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays Code]].\n\nThe original novel was partly the basis of [[Sanctuary (1961 film)|another film adaptation in 1961]], this time under the book's original title, directed by [[Tony Richardson]], starring [[Lee Remick]] as Temple Drake, [[Yves Montand]] as Candy (an amalgamation of Popeye and two other characters)<!--See article for source info-->, [[Bradford Dillman]], [[Harry Townes]], and [[Odetta]] in a rare film appearance.\n\nLong unseen except in bootleg 16mm prints, ''The Story of Temple Drake'' was restored by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and re-premiered in 2011 at the [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM Classic Film Festival]]. [[The Criterion Collection]] announced that it they will be bringing the film to Blu-ray and DVD in December 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nTemple Drake, the reckless daughter of a prominent judge in a small [[Mississippi]] town, refuses to marry her lawyer boyfriend, Stephen Benbow. This earns her a reputation in the town as a seductress. On the night of a town dance, Temple declines Stephen's proposal for a second time, and instead goes out with one of her suitors, Toddy Gowan. Toddy, who has been drinking, crashes their car near a dilapidated [[plantation]] home occupied by a [[speakeasy]] run by a man named Lee Goodwin. Trigger, a gangster and [[Rum-running|bootlegger]] at the speakeasy, forces Temple and Toddy into the house. Toddy, drunk and injured, attempts to fight Trigger, but Trigger knocks him unconscious. Temple tries to flee, but Trigger insists she spend the night. Lee's wife, Ruby, suggests that Temple sleep in the barn, and arranges for a young man named Tommy to stand watch.\n\nAt dawn, Trigger shoots Tommy to death before raping Temple in the barn. Trigger proceeds to kidnap Temple, making her his [[gun moll]], and brings her to a [[brothel]] in the city run by a woman named Reba. Meanwhile, Toddy awakens in a warehouse and skips town. Newspapers erroneously report that the missing Temple has traveled to Pennsylvania to visit family. At the speakeasy, Lee is arrested for Tommy's murder, and Stephen is appointed as his lawyer. Fearing for his life, Lee refuses to implicate Trigger in Tommy's murder. Ruby, however, directs Stephen to search for Trigger at Reba's home.\n\nStephen tracks down Trigger to Reba's address, and finds Temple there, dressed in a negligee. Fearing that Trigger will kill Stephen, Temple falsely assures Stephen that she willingly went with him. Stephen believes her, and serves them summons for Tommy's murder trial. After Stephen leaves, Temple tries to escape, only to be attacked by Trigger. In the melee, Temple wrests his gun and shoots him to death.\n\nTemple returns to her hometown, and near the conclusion of the trial, she begs Stephen to dismiss her from testifying. He denies her wish, and forces her to take the stand in court, but, out of his love for her, he is unable to question her about Trigger. Despite his lack of questioning, Temple openly confesses everything that happened, including her witnessing Tommy's murder, her rape, and her murder of Trigger. At the end of her confession, she loses consciousness, and Stephen carries her out of the courtroom.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n*[[Miriam Hopkins]] as [[Temple Drake]]\n*[[Jack La Rue]] as [[Popeye (Faulkner character)|Trigger]]\n*[[William Gargan]] as Stephen Benbow\n*[[William Collier Jr.]] as Toddy Gowan\n*[[Irving Pichel]] as Lee Goodwin\n*[[Jobyna Howland]] as Miss Reba\n*[[Guy Standing]] as Judge Drake, Temple's grandfather\n*[[Elizabeth Patterson (actress)|Elizabeth Patterson]] as Aunt Jennie\n*[[Florence Eldridge]] as Ruby Lemarr<!--From credits: https://immortalephemera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/61-cast-554x408.jpg which is in https://immortalephemera.com/67940/the-story-of-temple-drake-1933/ -->\n*James Eagles as Tommy\n*Harlan Knight as Pap\n*[[James Mason (American actor)|James Mason]] as Van\n*[[Louise Beavers]] as Minnie\n*Arthur Belasco as Wharton\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:William Faulkner 1954 (3) (photo by Carl van Vechten).jpg|thumb|left|upright=.8|The film is based on the novel ''Sanctuary'', by [[William Faulkner]] (pictured)]]\nIn 1932, [[Paramount Pictures]] acquired the rights to the film's basis, the controversial novel ''[[Sanctuary (Faulkner novel)|Sanctuary]]'' (1931) by [[William Faulkner]], for $6,000.{{sfn|Ellenberger|2017|p=79}} Faulkner's novel dealt with a young Southern [[debutante]] held captive by a gang member and rapist.{{sfn|Sabini|2017|p=219}} As the public felt the novel had a racy reputation, the film received a new title as the plot had been made more mild and to avoid associating it with the source work.<ref name=afi/> Despite this, even before filming had begun, it was publicly condemned by U.S. women's leagues, an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', as well as the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Sabini|2017|p=220}}\n\nThe credits only stated that Faulkner wrote the original novel. Robert Litell, who wrote a review of the film published in ''The New Republic'' on June 14, 1933, stated that the film producers also consulted Faulkner; statements about this are not present in the credits.{{sfn|Degenfelder|1976|p=552}}\n\n====Deviations from novel====\nSeveral alterations were made to the screenplay that deviated from the source material: For example, in the novel, the judge is Temple's father; Phillips stated that \"presumably\" to make it more believable that he is \"ineffectual\" with her, he was changed into being her grandfather.{{sfn|Phillips|1973|p=265}} For a short period before the film went into production, it was tentatively titled ''The Shame of Temple Drake''.<ref name=afi/>\n\nThe relatively upbeat ending of the film is in marked contrast to the ending of Faulkner's novel ''Sanctuary'', in which Temple perjures herself in court, resulting in the lynching of an innocent man. E. Pauline Degenfelder of [[Worcester Public Schools]] wrote that the characterization of Temple differs from that of the novel version,{{sfn|Degenfelder|1976|p=548}} and that the film gives her a \"dual nature\" of a dark nature and a light nature.{{sfn|Degenfelder|1976|p=549}} Gene D. Phillips of [[Loyola University of Chicago]] wrote that she is \"better\" morally than the novel character.{{sfn|Phillips|1973|p=267}} According to Pre-Code scholar Thomas Doherty, the film implies that the deeds done to Temple are in recompense for her immorality in falling into a relationship with the gangster instead of fleeing him.{{sfn|Doherty|1999|pages=117-118}}\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Miriam Hopkins Argentinean Magazine AD.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Miriam Hopkins was cast as the titular Temple Drake]]\n[[George Raft]] was initially cast as the male lead of Trigger,<ref>{{cite news|title=Projection jottings|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City, New York|p=X5|date=February 19, 1933}}</ref> but dropped out of the production, which resulted in him being temporarily suspended by Paramount.<ref name=afi/> Raft felt taking the role would be \"screen suicide\" as the character had no redeemable qualities,{{sfn|Sabini|2017|p=221}} and also demanded a salary of $2 million.{{sfn|Ellenberger|2017|p=81}} He was ultimately replaced by Jack La Rue, then a [[bit part|bit player]] for Paramount{{sfn|Sabini|2017|p=221}} who had garnered some notice for his performance in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''[[Diamond Lil (play)|Diamond Lil]]'' opposite [[Mae West]].{{sfn|Ellenberger|2017|p=81}}\n\nAccording to ''Filmink'' the fact the film ultimately \"did little for La Rue\u2019s career... served to give Raft a false idea of the quality of his instincts when it came to script selection. \"<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Filmink|url=https://www.filmink.com.au/stars-stop-stars-george-raft/|first=Stephen|last=Vagg|title=Why Stars Stop Being Stars: George Raft|date=February 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nMiriam Hopkins, who was cast in the titular role of Temple Drake, was a newcomer at the time of filming, and had only begun establishing herself in two [[Ernst Lubitsch]] films: ''[[The Smiling Lieutenant]]'' (1931) and ''[[Trouble in Paradise (1932 film)|Trouble in Paradise]]'' (1932).{{sfn|Sabini|2017|p=221}} Hopkins' mother was reportedly upset that her daughter was portraying a rape victim.{{sfn|Ellenberger|2017|p=82}} Hopkins herself would continually cite the role as one of her personal favorites due to its emotional complexity: \"That Temple Drake, now, there was a thing.

It tells the story of [[Temple Drake]], a reckless woman in the [[Southern United States|American South]] who falls into the hands of a brutal gangster and rapist. It was adapted from the highly controversial novel ''[[Sanctuary (Faulkner novel)|Sanctuary]]'' by [[William Faulkner]]. Though some of the more salacious elements of the source novel were not included, the film was still considered so indecent that it helped give rise to the introduction of the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays Code]].\n\nThe original novel was partly the basis of [[Sanctuary (1961 film)|another film adaptation in 1961]], this time under the book's original title, directed by [[Tony Richardson]], starring [[Lee Remick]] as Temple Drake, [[Yves Montand]] as Candy (an amalgamation of Popeye and two other characters)<!--See article for source info-->, [[Bradford Dillman]], [[Harry Townes]], and [[Odetta]] in a rare film appearance.\n\nLong unseen except in bootleg 16mm prints, ''The Story of Temple Drake'' was restored by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and re-premiered in 2011 at the [[Turner Classic Movies|TCM Classic Film Festival]]. [[The Criterion Collection]] announced that it they will be bringing the film to Blu-ray and DVD in December 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nTemple Drake, the reckless daughter of a prominent judge in a small [[Mississippi]] town, refuses to marry her lawyer boyfriend, Stephen Benbow. This earns her a reputation in the town as a seductress. On the night of a town dance, Temple declines Stephen's proposal for a second time, and instead goes out with one of her suitors, Toddy Gowan. Toddy, who has been drinking, crashes their car near a dilapidated [[plantation]] home occupied by a [[speakeasy]] run by a man named Lee Goodwin. Trigger, a gangster and [[Rum-running|bootlegger]] at the speakeasy, forces Temple and Toddy into the house. Toddy, drunk and injured, attempts to fight Trigger, but Trigger knocks him unconscious. Temple tries to flee, but Trigger insists she spend the night. Lee's wife, Ruby, suggests that Temple sleep in the barn, and arranges for a young man named Tommy to stand watch.\n\nAt dawn, Trigger shoots Tommy to death before raping Temple in the barn. Trigger proceeds to kidnap Temple, making her his [[gun moll]], and brings her to a [[brothel]] in the city run by a woman named Reba. Meanwhile, Toddy awakens in a warehouse and skips town. Newspapers erroneously report that the missing Temple has traveled to Pennsylvania to visit family. At the speakeasy, Lee is arrested for Tommy's murder, and Stephen is appointed as his lawyer. Fearing for his life, Lee refuses to implicate Trigger in Tommy's murder. Ruby, however, directs Stephen to search for Trigger at Reba's home.\n\nStephen tracks down Trigger to Reba's address, and finds Temple there, dressed in a negligee. Fearing that Trigger will kill Stephen, Temple falsely assures Stephen that she willingly went with him. Stephen believes her, and serves them summons for Tommy's murder trial. After Stephen leaves, Temple tries to escape, only to be attacked by Trigger. In the melee, Temple wrests his gun and shoots him to death.\n\nTemple returns to her hometown, and near the conclusion of the trial, she begs Stephen to dismiss her from testifying. He denies her wish, and forces her to take the stand in court, but, out of his love for her, he is unable to question her about Trigger. Despite his lack of questioning, Temple openly confesses everything that happened, including her witnessing Tommy's murder, her rape, and her murder of Trigger. At the end of her confession, she loses consciousness, and Stephen carries her out of the courtroom.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast list|\n*[[Miriam Hopkins]] as [[Temple Drake]]\n*[[Jack La Rue]] as [[Popeye (Faulkner character)|Trigger]]\n*[[William Gargan]] as Stephen Benbow\n*[[William Collier Jr.]] as Toddy Gowan\n*[[Irving Pichel]] as Lee Goodwin\n*[[Jobyna Howland]] as Miss Reba\n*[[Guy Standing]] as Judge Drake, Temple's grandfather\n*[[Elizabeth Patterson (actress)|Elizabeth Patterson]] as Aunt Jennie\n*[[Florence Eldridge]] as Ruby Lemarr<!--From credits: https://immortalephemera.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/61-cast-554x408.jpg which is in https://immortalephemera.com/67940/the-story-of-temple-drake-1933/ -->\n*James Eagles as Tommy\n*Harlan Knight as Pap\n*[[James Mason (American actor)|James Mason]] as Van\n*[[Louise Beavers]] as Minnie\n*Arthur Belasco as Wharton\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[File:William Faulkner 1954 (3) (photo by Carl van Vechten).jpg|thumb|left|upright=.8|The film is based on the novel ''Sanctuary'', by [[William Faulkner]] (pictured)]]\nIn 1932, [[Paramount Pictures]] acquired the rights to the film's basis, the controversial novel ''[[Sanctuary (Faulkner novel)|Sanctuary]]'' (1931) by [[William Faulkner]], for $6,000.{{sfn|Ellenberger|2017|p=79}} Faulkner's novel dealt with a young Southern [[debutante]] held captive by a gang member and rapist.{{sfn|Sabini|2017|p=219}} As the public felt the novel had a racy reputation, the film received a new title as the plot had been made more mild and to avoid associating it with the source work.<ref name=afi/> Despite this, even before filming had begun, it was publicly condemned by U.S. women's leagues, an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', as well as the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].{{sfn|Sabini|2017|p=220}}\n\nThe credits only stated that Faulkner wrote the original novel. Robert Litell, who wrote a review of the film published in ''The New Republic'' on June 14, 1933, stated that the film producers also consulted Faulkner; statements about this are not present in the credits.{{sfn|Degenfelder|1976|p=552}}\n\n====Deviations from novel====\nSeveral alterations were made to the screenplay that deviated from the source material: For example, in the novel, the judge is Temple's father; Phillips stated that \"presumably\" to make it more believable that he is \"ineffectual\" with her, he was changed into being her grandfather.{{sfn|Phillips|1973|p=265}} For a short period before the film went into production, it was tentatively titled ''The Shame of Temple Drake''.<ref name=afi/>\n\nThe relatively upbeat ending of the film is in marked contrast to the ending of Faulkner's novel ''Sanctuary'', in which Temple perjures herself in court, resulting in the lynching of an innocent man. E. Pauline Degenfelder of [[Worcester Public Schools]] wrote that the characterization of Temple differs from that of the novel version,{{sfn|Degenfelder|1976|p=548}} and that the film gives her a \"dual nature\" of a dark nature and a light nature.{{sfn|Degenfelder|1976|p=549}} Gene D. Phillips of [[Loyola University of Chicago]] wrote that she is \"better\" morally than the novel character.{{sfn|Phillips|1973|p=267}} According to Pre-Code scholar Thomas Doherty, the film implies that the deeds done to Temple are in recompense for her immorality in falling into a relationship with the gangster instead of fleeing him.{{sfn|Doherty|1999|pages=117-118}}\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Miriam Hopkins Argentinean Magazine AD.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Miriam Hopkins was cast as the titular Temple Drake]]\n[[George Raft]] was initially cast as the male lead of Trigger,<ref>{{cite news|title=Projection jottings|work=[[The New York Times]]|location=New York City, New York|p=X5|date=February 19, 1933}}</ref> but dropped out of the production, which resulted in him being temporarily suspended by Paramount.<ref name=afi/> Raft felt taking the role would be \"screen suicide\" as the character had no redeemable qualities,{{sfn|Sabini|2017|p=221}} and also demanded a salary of $2 million.{{sfn|Ellenberger|2017|p=81}} He was ultimately replaced by Jack La Rue, then a [[bit part|bit player]] for Paramount{{sfn|Sabini|2017|p=221}} who had garnered some notice for his performance in a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''[[Diamond Lil (play)|Diamond Lil]]'' opposite [[Mae West]].{{sfn|Ellenberger|2017|p=81}}\n\nAccording to ''Filmink'' the fact the film ultimately \"did little for La Rue\u2019s career... served to give Raft a false idea of the quality of his instincts when it came to script selection. \"<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Filmink|url=https://www.filmink.com.au/stars-stop-stars-george-raft/|first=Stephen|last=Vagg|title=Why Stars Stop Being Stars: George Raft|date=February 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nMiriam Hopkins, who was cast in the titular role of Temple Drake, was a newcomer at the time of filming, and had only begun establishing herself in two [[Ernst Lubitsch]] films: ''[[The Smiling Lieutenant]]'' (1931) and ''[[Trouble in Paradise (1932 film)|Trouble in Paradise]]'' (1932).{{sfn|Sabini|2017|p=221}} Hopkins' mother was reportedly upset that her daughter was portraying a rape victim.{{sfn|Ellenberger|2017|p=82}} Hopkins herself would continually cite the role as one of her personal favorites due to its emotional complexity: \"That Temple Drake, now, there was a thing.

Trump was acquitted by the Republican-controlled [[United States Senate|Senate]] on these two counts of impeachment on February 5, 2020.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/2020/02/05/801429948/not-guilty-trump-acquitted-on-2-articles-of-impeachment-as-historic-trial-closes 'Not Guilty': Trump Acquitted On 2 Articles Of Impeachment As Historic Trial Closes] by Philip Ewing, [[NPR]], February 5, 2020, 4:33 PM ET</ref>\n\n[[Donald Trump|Trump]]'s impeachment came after [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump|a formal House inquiry]] alleged that he had solicited [[Foreign interference in the 2020 United States elections|foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election]] to help his [[Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign|re-election bid]], and then obstructed the inquiry itself by telling his administration officials to ignore subpoenas for documents and testimony. The inquiry reported that Trump withheld military aid{{efn|Intended to help Ukraine in its [[War in Donbass|war against Russian-backed separatist forces in Donbass]]<ref name=\"Zelensky bowed until luck\" />}} and an invitation to the White House to [[Ukrainian president]] [[Volodymyr Zelensky]] in order [[Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal|to influence Ukraine]] to announce an investigation into one of Trump's political opponents, [[Joe Biden]], and to promote [[Conspiracy theories related to the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal#CrowdStrike|a discredited conspiracy theory]] that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interference in the 2016 presidential election]].\n\nThe inquiry stage of Trump's impeachment lasted from September to November 2019, in the wake of an [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump#Withholding of military aid and July 25 phone call|August 2019 whistleblower complaint]] alleging Trump's abuse of power. In October, three congressional committees ([[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence]], [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform|Oversight]], and [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Foreign Affairs]]) deposed witnesses. In November, the [[House Intelligence Committee]] held a number of public hearings in which witnesses testified publicly; on December 3, the committee voted 13\u20139 along party lines to adopt a final report. A set of impeachment hearings before the [[House Judiciary Committee]] began on December 4; on December 13, it voted 23\u201317 along party lines to recommend two articles of impeachment, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The committee released a lengthy report on the impeachment articles on December 16. Two days later, the full House approved both articles in a near-party-line vote, with all Republicans opposing along with three Democrats. This made Trump the third U.S. president in history to be impeached and marked the first fully partisan impeachment where a U.S. president was impeached without support from the President's own party (though [[independent politician|independent]] representative [[Justin Amash]], who voted in favor of impeachment on both articles, had previously been a Republican until July 2019).\n\nThe articles were submitted to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on January 16, 2020, initiating [[Impeachment trial of Donald Trump|the trial]]. The trial saw no witnesses or documents being subpoenaed, as Republican senators rejected attempts to introduce subpoenas on January 21 while arranging for trial procedures, and then on January 31 after a debate. On February 5, Trump was acquitted on both counts by the Senate as neither count received 67 votes to convict. On Article I, abuse of power, 48 senators voted for conviction, while 52 senators voted for acquittal. On Article II, obstruction of Congress, 47 senators voted for conviction, while 53 senators voted to acquit.

The inquiry reported that Trump withheld military aid{{efn|Intended to help Ukraine in its [[War in Donbass|war against Russian-backed separatist forces in Donbass]]<ref name=\"Zelensky bowed until luck\" />}} and an invitation to the White House to [[Ukrainian president]] [[Volodymyr Zelensky]] in order [[Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal|to influence Ukraine]] to announce an investigation into one of Trump's political opponents, [[Joe Biden]], and to promote [[Conspiracy theories related to the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal#CrowdStrike|a discredited conspiracy theory]] that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interference in the 2016 presidential election]].\n\nThe inquiry stage of Trump's impeachment lasted from September to November 2019, in the wake of an [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump#Withholding of military aid and July 25 phone call|August 2019 whistleblower complaint]] alleging Trump's abuse of power. In October, three congressional committees ([[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence]], [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform|Oversight]], and [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Foreign Affairs]]) deposed witnesses. In November, the [[House Intelligence Committee]] held a number of public hearings in which witnesses testified publicly; on December 3, the committee voted 13\u20139 along party lines to adopt a final report. A set of impeachment hearings before the [[House Judiciary Committee]] began on December 4; on December 13, it voted 23\u201317 along party lines to recommend two articles of impeachment, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The committee released a lengthy report on the impeachment articles on December 16. Two days later, the full House approved both articles in a near-party-line vote, with all Republicans opposing along with three Democrats. This made Trump the third U.S. president in history to be impeached and marked the first fully partisan impeachment where a U.S. president was impeached without support from the President's own party (though [[independent politician|independent]] representative [[Justin Amash]], who voted in favor of impeachment on both articles, had previously been a Republican until July 2019).\n\nThe articles were submitted to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on January 16, 2020, initiating [[Impeachment trial of Donald Trump|the trial]]. The trial saw no witnesses or documents being subpoenaed, as Republican senators rejected attempts to introduce subpoenas on January 21 while arranging for trial procedures, and then on January 31 after a debate. On February 5, Trump was acquitted on both counts by the Senate as neither count received 67 votes to convict. On Article I, abuse of power, 48 senators voted for conviction, while 52 senators voted for acquittal. On Article II, obstruction of Congress, 47 senators voted for conviction, while 53 senators voted to acquit. Republican [[Mitt Romney]], the only senator to break party lines, became the first U.S senator to vote to convict a president of his own party in an impeachment trial, as he voted for conviction on abuse of power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/05/no-senator-ever-voted-remove-president-his-party-office-until-mitt-romney/|title=No senator ever voted to remove a president of his own party from office.

For the next 80 or 90 years succeeding the banishment of the apostle John to Patmos covering the successive reigns of the emperors [[Nerva]], [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]] and the two Antonines ([[Antoninus Pius]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]]), a golden age of prosperity, union, civil liberty and good government unstained with civil blood unfolded. The agents of this prosperity personified by the rider of the white horse are these five emperors wearing crowns that reigned with absolute authority and power under the guidance of virtue and wisdom, the armies being restrained by their firm and gentle hands.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|129\u2013131,134}}\n\nThis interpretation points out that the bow was preeminently a weapon of the inhabitants of the island of [[Crete]] and not of the Roman Empire in general. The Cretans were renowned for their archery skills. The significance of the rider of the white horse holding a bow indicates the place of origin of the line of emperors ruling during this time. This group of emperors can be classed together under one and the same head and family whose origins were from Crete.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|140,142\u2013144}}\n\nAccording to this interpretation, this period in Roman history, remarkable, both at its commencement and at its close, illustrated the glory of the empire where its limits were extended, though not without occasional wars, which were always uniformly triumphant and successful on the frontiers. The triumphs of the Emperor Trajan, a Roman Alexander, added to the empire [[Dacia]], [[Armenia]], [[Mesopotamia]] and other provinces during the course of the first 20 years of the period, which deepened the impression on the minds of the barbarians of the invincibility of the Roman Empire. Roman war progressed triumphantly into the invader's own territory, and the Parthian war was successfully ended by the total overthrow of those people. Roman conquest is demonstrated even in the most mighty of these wars, the Marcomannic succession of victories under the second Antonine unleashed on the German barbarians, driven into their forests and reduced to Roman submission.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|131\u2013133}}\n\n===As war===\n\nIn some commentaries to Bibles, the white Horseman is said to symbolize (ordinary) War, which may possibly be exercised on righteous grounds in decent manner, hence the white color, but still is devastating. The red Horseman (see below) then rather more specifically symbolizes civil war.<ref>''Herder'' German Bible, Freiburg im Breisgau 2007, p. 1348, annotation to Apc 6,7: \"The four Horsemen of the Apocalypse symbolize various plagues: [1.] War, [2.] Civil War, [3.] famine and inflation, [4.] pestilence and death.\" (translated from German)</ref>\n\n===As infectious disease===\nUnder another interpretation, the first Horseman is called [[Infection|Pestilence]], and is associated with infectious disease and plague. It appears at least as early as 1906, when it is mentioned in the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]].<ref name=Singer>{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Isidore|title=The Jewish Encyclopedia: A Descriptive Record of the History, Religion, Literature, and Customs of the Jewish People from the Earliest Times to the Present Day, Volume 10|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_YLw5AQAAMAAJ|year=1916|publisher=Funk and Wagnalls|page=392|author2=Adler, Cyrus|quote=\"...and sees a white horse appear, with a rider holding a bow (representing, probably, Pestilence).\"}}</ref> This particular interpretation is common [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in popular culture|in popular culture references]] to the Four Horsemen.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stableford|first1=Brian|title=The A to Z of Fantasy Literature|date=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=0810868296|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHc3XTdJBxQC&pg=PA18|accessdate=18 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe origin of this interpretation is unclear. Some translations of the Bible mention \"[[plague (disease)|plague]]\" (e.g. the [[New International Version|NIV]]) or \"pestilence\" (e.g. the [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]]) in connection with the riders in the passage following the introduction of the fourth rider; cf. \"They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine, plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.\" ({{bibleverse|Revelation|6:7\u20138|NASB}} NASB). However, it is a matter of debate as to whether this passage refers to the first rider, or to the four riders as a whole.<ref name=flegg/>\n\n[[Vicente Blasco Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez]], in his 1916 novel ''[[The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (Spanish novel)|The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]'' (filmed [[The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (film)|in 1921]] and [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (film)|in 1962]]), provides an early example of this interpretation, writing \"The horseman on the white horse was clad in a showy and barbarous attire. ... While his horse continued galloping, he was bending his bow in order to spread pestilence abroad.

The sword was a natural, universal badge among the Romans, of the military profession. The apocalyptic figure indicated by the great sword indicated an undue authority and unnatural use of it.

During his reign, he crushed every part of the empire under the weight of his iron scepter. Old as well as new taxes were at the same time levied in the provinces. In the course of this history, the land tax, the taxes for services and the heavy contributions of corn, wine, oil and meat were exacted from the provinces for the use of the court, army and capital.

That furious plague (the [[Plague of Cyprian]]), which raged from the year 250 to the year 265, continued without interruption in every province, city and almost every family in the empire. During a portion of this time, 5000 people died daily in Rome; and many towns that escaped the attacks of barbarians were entirely depopulated.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|193}}\n\nFor a time in the late 260s, the strength of [[Aurelian]] crushed the enemies of Rome, yet after his assassination certain of them revived.<ref name=GibbonV1 />{{rp|246}} While the Goths had been destroyed for almost a century and the Empire reunited, the Sassanid Persians were uncowed in the East and during the following year hosts of central Asian Alani spread themselves over Pontus, Cappadocia, Cilicia and Galatia, etching their course by the flames of cities and villages they pillaged.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|197}}\n\nAs for the wild beasts of the earth, according to Elliott, it is a well-known law of nature that they quickly occupy the scenes of waste and depopulation\u2014where the reign of man fails and the reign of beasts begins.

For the next 80 or 90 years succeeding the banishment of the apostle John to Patmos covering the successive reigns of the emperors [[Nerva]], [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]] and the two Antonines ([[Antoninus Pius]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]]), a golden age of prosperity, union, civil liberty and good government unstained with civil blood unfolded. The agents of this prosperity personified by the rider of the white horse are these five emperors wearing crowns that reigned with absolute authority and power under the guidance of virtue and wisdom, the armies being restrained by their firm and gentle hands.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|129\u2013131,134}}\n\nThis interpretation points out that the bow was preeminently a weapon of the inhabitants of the island of [[Crete]] and not of the Roman Empire in general. The Cretans were renowned for their archery skills. The significance of the rider of the white horse holding a bow indicates the place of origin of the line of emperors ruling during this time. This group of emperors can be classed together under one and the same head and family whose origins were from Crete.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|140,142\u2013144}}\n\nAccording to this interpretation, this period in Roman history, remarkable, both at its commencement and at its close, illustrated the glory of the empire where its limits were extended, though not without occasional wars, which were always uniformly triumphant and successful on the frontiers. The triumphs of the Emperor Trajan, a Roman Alexander, added to the empire [[Dacia]], [[Armenia]], [[Mesopotamia]] and other provinces during the course of the first 20 years of the period, which deepened the impression on the minds of the barbarians of the invincibility of the Roman Empire. Roman war progressed triumphantly into the invader's own territory, and the Parthian war was successfully ended by the total overthrow of those people. Roman conquest is demonstrated even in the most mighty of these wars, the Marcomannic succession of victories under the second Antonine unleashed on the German barbarians, driven into their forests and reduced to Roman submission.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|131\u2013133}}\n\n===As war===\n\nIn some commentaries to Bibles, the white Horseman is said to symbolize (ordinary) War, which may possibly be exercised on righteous grounds in decent manner, hence the white color, but still is devastating. The red Horseman (see below) then rather more specifically symbolizes civil war.<ref>''Herder'' German Bible, Freiburg im Breisgau 2007, p. 1348, annotation to Apc 6,7: \"The four Horsemen of the Apocalypse symbolize various plagues: [1.] War, [2.] Civil War, [3.] famine and inflation, [4.] pestilence and death.\" (translated from German)</ref>\n\n===As infectious disease===\nUnder another interpretation, the first Horseman is called [[Infection|Pestilence]], and is associated with infectious disease and plague. It appears at least as early as 1906, when it is mentioned in the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]].<ref name=Singer>{{cite book|last=Singer|first=Isidore|title=The Jewish Encyclopedia: A Descriptive Record of the History, Religion, Literature, and Customs of the Jewish People from the Earliest Times to the Present Day, Volume 10|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_YLw5AQAAMAAJ|year=1916|publisher=Funk and Wagnalls|page=392|author2=Adler, Cyrus|quote=\"...and sees a white horse appear, with a rider holding a bow (representing, probably, Pestilence).\"}}</ref> This particular interpretation is common [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in popular culture|in popular culture references]] to the Four Horsemen.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stableford|first1=Brian|title=The A to Z of Fantasy Literature|date=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=0810868296|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHc3XTdJBxQC&pg=PA18|accessdate=18 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe origin of this interpretation is unclear. Some translations of the Bible mention \"[[plague (disease)|plague]]\" (e.g. the [[New International Version|NIV]]) or \"pestilence\" (e.g. the [[Revised Standard Version|RSV]]) in connection with the riders in the passage following the introduction of the fourth rider; cf. \"They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine, plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.\" ({{bibleverse|Revelation|6:7\u20138|NASB}} NASB).

The sword was a natural, universal badge among the Romans, of the military profession. The apocalyptic figure indicated by the great sword indicated an undue authority and unnatural use of it. Military men in power, whose vocation was war and weapon the sword, rose by it and also fell.

John hears a voice, unidentified but coming from among [[Chronology of Revelation#Vision of Heaven|the four living creatures]], that speaks of the prices of wheat and barley, also saying \"and see thou hurt not the [[olive oil|oil]] and the [[wine]]\". This suggests that the black horse's famine is to drive up the price of grain but leave oil and wine supplies unaffected (though out of reach of the ordinary worker).

The balance during the time of the apostle John's exile in Patmos was commonly a symbol of justice since it was used to weigh out the grains for a set price.

During the reign of Emperor [[Caracalla]], whose sentiments were very different from the [[Antonines]] being inattentive, or rather averse, to the welfare of the people, he found himself under the necessity of gratifying the greed and excessive lifestyle which he had excited in the Army. During his reign, he crushed every part of the empire under the weight of his iron scepter. Old as well as new taxes were at the same time levied in the provinces. In the course of this history, the land tax, the taxes for services and the heavy contributions of corn, wine, oil and meat were exacted from the provinces for the use of the court, army and capital. This noxious weed not totally eradicated again sprang up with the most luxurious growth and going forward darkened the Roman world with its deadly shade.<ref name=\"GibbonV1\" />{{rp|138\u2013139}}\n\nIn reality, the rise to power of the Emperor [[Maximinus Thrax|Maximin]], whose cruelty was derived from a different source being raised as a barbarian from the district of Thrace, expanded the distress on the empire beyond the confines of the illustrious senators or bold adventurers who in the court or army exposed themselves to the whims of fortune.

That furious plague (the [[Plague of Cyprian]]), which raged from the year 250 to the year 265, continued without interruption in every province, city and almost every family in the empire. During a portion of this time, 5000 people died daily in Rome; and many towns that escaped the attacks of barbarians were entirely depopulated.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|193}}\n\nFor a time in the late 260s, the strength of [[Aurelian]] crushed the enemies of Rome, yet after his assassination certain of them revived.<ref name=GibbonV1 />{{rp|246}} While the Goths had been destroyed for almost a century and the Empire reunited, the Sassanid Persians were uncowed in the East and during the following year hosts of central Asian Alani spread themselves over Pontus, Cappadocia, Cilicia and Galatia, etching their course by the flames of cities and villages they pillaged.<ref name=ElliottV1 />{{rp|197}}\n\nAs for the wild beasts of the earth, according to Elliott, it is a well-known law of nature that they quickly occupy the scenes of waste and depopulation\u2014where the reign of man fails and the reign of beasts begins.

The three areas had connections to San Francisco and Oakland via [[Caltrain]] and the Amtrak ''[[San Joaquin (train)|San Joaquin]]'' (and later [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] and ''[[Capitol Corridor]]'' trains), but commuting from the Central Valley and Tri-Valley to Silicon Valley required using a car or limited bus service. In 1989, the San Joaquin Council of Governments, Stockton Chamber of Commerce, and the Building Industry Association of the Delta started work on a 20-year transportation plan for their section of the Central Valley. In November 1990, [[San Joaquin County]] voters passed Measure K, a half-cent sales tax to fund a variety of transportation improvements.<ref name=bra>{{cite web |url=http://www.bayrailalliance.org/altamont_commuter_express_ace |title=Altamont Corridor Express (ACE) |publisher=BayRail Alliance}}</ref><ref name=measureK>{{cite web |url=http://www.sjcog.org/index.aspx?NID=97 |title=Measure K |publisher=San Joaquin Council of Governments |access-date=August 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902112639/http://www.sjcog.org/index.aspx?nid=97 |archive-date=September 2, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The highest-priority project was the establishment of passenger rail service to San Jose.<ref name=acehistory>{{cite web |url=http://www.acerail.com/About/History-of-ACE |title=History of ACE |publisher=San Joaquin Joint Powers Authority}}</ref>\n[[File:Altamont Commuter Rail MPI F40PH-3C 3106 with ACE Train 4 at San Jose Diridon Station, July 16th, 2012.jpg|thumb|left|ACE Train #4, the 3:35 eastbound, at [[Diridon Station|San Jose Diridon station]] with F40PH-3C #3106]]\nIn 1995, San Joaquin County and seven cities along the route formed the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission (SJRRC) to oversee the creation of the service.<ref name=acehistory /> In May 1997, the Altamont Commuter Express Joint Powers Authority (ACE JPA) was formed by the SJRRC, [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority]] (VTA), and Alameda Congestion Management Agency (ACMA).

The three areas had connections to San Francisco and Oakland via [[Caltrain]] and the Amtrak ''[[San Joaquin (train)|San Joaquin]]'' (and later [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] and ''[[Capitol Corridor]]'' trains), but commuting from the Central Valley and Tri-Valley to Silicon Valley required using a car or limited bus service. In 1989, the San Joaquin Council of Governments, Stockton Chamber of Commerce, and the Building Industry Association of the Delta started work on a 20-year transportation plan for their section of the Central Valley. In November 1990, [[San Joaquin County]] voters passed Measure K, a half-cent sales tax to fund a variety of transportation improvements.<ref name=bra>{{cite web |url=http://www.bayrailalliance.org/altamont_commuter_express_ace |title=Altamont Corridor Express (ACE) |publisher=BayRail Alliance}}</ref><ref name=measureK>{{cite web |url=http://www.sjcog.org/index.aspx?NID=97 |title=Measure K |publisher=San Joaquin Council of Governments |access-date=August 29, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902112639/http://www.sjcog.org/index.aspx?nid=97 |archive-date=September 2, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The highest-priority project was the establishment of passenger rail service to San Jose.<ref name=acehistory>{{cite web |url=http://www.acerail.com/About/History-of-ACE |title=History of ACE |publisher=San Joaquin Joint Powers Authority}}</ref>\n[[File:Altamont Commuter Rail MPI F40PH-3C 3106 with ACE Train 4 at San Jose Diridon Station, July 16th, 2012.jpg|thumb|left|ACE Train #4, the 3:35 eastbound, at [[Diridon Station|San Jose Diridon station]] with F40PH-3C #3106]]\nIn 1995, San Joaquin County and seven cities along the route formed the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission (SJRRC) to oversee the creation of the service.<ref name=acehistory /> In May 1997, the Altamont Commuter Express Joint Powers Authority (ACE JPA) was formed by the SJRRC, [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority]] (VTA), and Alameda Congestion Management Agency (ACMA).
