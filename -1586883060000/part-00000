Together with an ostentatious crew led by Tayaji ([[Satish Kaushik]]) and cousin Jassi ([[Suhail Nayyar]]), he indulges in uncontrolled consumption of [[cocaine]]. Tommy is popular for his energetic songs with lyrics that often glorify violence and [[drug addiction]]. However, his addiction costs him his music contract and lands him in jail. In prison, he meets two of his die-hard fans who remark how Tommy's lifestyle had 'inspired' theirs, leading them to commit the murder of their own mother. Realizing that his songs have negatively affected teenagers, Tommy decides to change his ways upon release. A few days later, he engages in an altercation with Tayaji and accidentally shoots him, injuring his ear. Tayaji sends Tommy and his crew away to a farmhouse so that he can prepare for an upcoming concert.\n\nWorking on the farm is a [[Bihari people|Bihari]] migrant worker named Bauria ([[Alia Bhatt]]). Bauria's dreams of playing national-level hockey for the country were shattered, so she came to [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] to work as a laborer. She works for a local landlord who uses agriculture as a front for drug-peddling. One night, she finds a suspicious packet on the farm and realizes that it is some kind of drug. She resolves to sell it but her search for a potential buyer lands her in trouble as she unwittingly contacts the original owners of the [[heroin]]. She is captured by the gang of drug peddlers but not before she discards it into a well. As a compensation for their lost drugs, the peddlers forcibly keep her at their house, where she is sexually and physically abused, given drugs, and prostituted to men. Some weeks later, she manages to escape.\n\nIn the neighboring town lives Preet Sahni ([[Kareena Kapoor]]), a doctor and activist who runs a [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] center. Sartaj Singh ([[Diljit Dosanjh]]) is a junior policeman who knows about the drug smuggling his seniors are allowing. But when it affects his family, as his brother, Balli, overdoses and is brought to Preet's clinic, he realizes the grave situation. Preet and Sartaj decide to find the root cause of the problem together. Balli is admitted into her drug rehabilitation centre against his will.\n\nAt his concert, instead of singing, Tommy starts preaching. Infuriated by his speech about how one should lead one's life, his fans start throwing bottles at him. Tommy gets angry and urinates in front of the crowd before fleeing. He hides in an old structure and meets Bauria, also hiding. The two share their stories and bond. However, Bauria is recaptured by the same gang. Tommy learns the next day that an arrest warrant has been issued for him because of the public ruckus at the concert. He sets out to find Bauria after realising he is in love with her.\n\nPreet and Sartaj find that the driving force behind the drug problem in Punjab is an elderly man called Virender Singh, who has flourished with the support of [[Member of parliament|MP]] Maninder Brar. The two go to extreme measures to collect evidence against the politician and put together a report to be sent to the state's Election Commission to thwart Brar's campaign for another term in power. Sartaj and Preet fall in love; however, one night, Preet sees a manic Balli trying to escape from her rehab center. On trying to stop him, she is accidentally stabbed by him. The policemen who investigate her homicide, including senior officer Jhujar Singh, come across the report made by her and Sartaj. Since he is Sartaj's close friend, Jhujar decides to protect Balli by sending him underground. However, he is infuriated when he sees that he too has been named in the drug racket and calls Sartaj.\n\nIn the presence of the local drug mafia at their farmhouse (where Bauria is confined), a bruised and beaten Sartaj is questioned by Jhujar, who is a key member in the drug racket. Sartaj says whatever he did was for the sake of Punjab. At the same time, Tommy enters the house. Sartaj grabs Jhujar's pistol and shoots the whole gang before freeing Balli. Tommy helps Bauria escape from her captors. Balli kneels and cries in front of his brother, whose face is expressionless.\n\nIt is shown that the government issued an inquiry into Maninder Brar's activities and there has been a huge crackdown on the drug menace. In [[Goa]], amidst his crew members, Tommy calls Bauria to ask for her real name. Sitting by the beach, she catches sight of a foreigner having fun. Inspired, she utters \"Mary Jane\".{{efn|According to the director, \"Mary Jane\", as the name of Bhatt's character, is an allusion to the drug [[marijuana]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/%E2%80%9CI-want-to-make-mainstream-movies-but-not-by-losing-myself-in-the-process%E2%80%9D/article14395252.ece |title=\u201cI want to make mainstream movies but not by losing myself in the process\u201d |last=Ghosh |first=Sankhayan |date=2016-06-22 |work=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=2018-07-26}}</ref>}}\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Shahid Kapoor]] as Tejinder \"Tommy\" Singh a.k.a.

Produced by [[Shobha Kapoor]] and [[Ekta Kapoor]] under their banner [[Balaji Motion Pictures]], in association with [[Anurag Kashyap]]'s production house [[Phantom Films]], it features an ensemble cast consisting of [[Shahid Kapoor]], [[Alia Bhatt]], [[Kareena Kapoor]] and [[Diljit Dosanjh]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Balaji Motion Pictures acquires Udta Punjab|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/news/5101275/Balaji-Motion-Pictures-acquires-Udta-Punjab|accessdate=10 March 2015|date=10 March 2015|publisher=[[Bollywood Hungama]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=I was the first to suggest that Kareena was perfect for Udta Punjab': Shahid Kapoor|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/i-was-the-first-to-suggest-that-kareena-was-perfect-for-udta-punjab-shahid-kapoor/|last=Gera|first=Sonal|work=[[The Indian Express]]|date=9 February 2015|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 4 June 2016, the [[Central Board of Film Certification]] sought a stay on the film's release citing that the themes dealt with in the film were too vulgar for the general audience.

Together with an ostentatious crew led by Tayaji ([[Satish Kaushik]]) and cousin Jassi ([[Suhail Nayyar]]), he indulges in uncontrolled consumption of [[cocaine]]. Tommy is popular for his energetic songs with lyrics that often glorify violence and [[drug addiction]]. However, his addiction costs him his music contract and lands him in jail. In prison, he meets two of his die-hard fans who remark how Tommy's lifestyle had 'inspired' theirs, leading them to commit the murder of their own mother. Realizing that his songs have negatively affected teenagers, Tommy decides to change his ways upon release. A few days later, he engages in an altercation with Tayaji and accidentally shoots him, injuring his ear. Tayaji sends Tommy and his crew away to a farmhouse so that he can prepare for an upcoming concert.\n\nWorking on the farm is a [[Bihari people|Bihari]] migrant worker named Bauria ([[Alia Bhatt]]). Bauria's dreams of playing national-level hockey for the country were shattered, so she came to [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] to work as a laborer. She works for a local landlord who uses agriculture as a front for drug-peddling. One night, she finds a suspicious packet on the farm and realizes that it is some kind of drug. She resolves to sell it but her search for a potential buyer lands her in trouble as she unwittingly contacts the original owners of the [[heroin]]. She is captured by the gang of drug peddlers but not before she discards it into a well. As a compensation for their lost drugs, the peddlers forcibly keep her at their house, where she is sexually and physically abused, given drugs, and prostituted to men. Some weeks later, she manages to escape.\n\nIn the neighboring town lives Preet Sahni ([[Kareena Kapoor]]), a doctor and activist who runs a [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] center. Sartaj Singh ([[Diljit Dosanjh]]) is a junior policeman who knows about the drug smuggling his seniors are allowing. But when it affects his family, as his brother, Balli, overdoses and is brought to Preet's clinic, he realizes the grave situation. Preet and Sartaj decide to find the root cause of the problem together. Balli is admitted into her drug rehabilitation centre against his will.\n\nAt his concert, instead of singing, Tommy starts preaching. Infuriated by his speech about how one should lead one's life, his fans start throwing bottles at him. Tommy gets angry and urinates in front of the crowd before fleeing. He hides in an old structure and meets Bauria, also hiding. The two share their stories and bond. However, Bauria is recaptured by the same gang. Tommy learns the next day that an arrest warrant has been issued for him because of the public ruckus at the concert. He sets out to find Bauria after realising he is in love with her.\n\nPreet and Sartaj find that the driving force behind the drug problem in Punjab is an elderly man called Virender Singh, who has flourished with the support of [[Member of parliament|MP]] Maninder Brar. The two go to extreme measures to collect evidence against the politician and put together a report to be sent to the state's Election Commission to thwart Brar's campaign for another term in power. Sartaj and Preet fall in love; however, one night, Preet sees a manic Balli trying to escape from her rehab center. On trying to stop him, she is accidentally stabbed by him. The policemen who investigate her homicide, including senior officer Jhujar Singh, come across the report made by her and Sartaj. Since he is Sartaj's close friend, Jhujar decides to protect Balli by sending him underground. However, he is infuriated when he sees that he too has been named in the drug racket and calls Sartaj.\n\nIn the presence of the local drug mafia at their farmhouse (where Bauria is confined), a bruised and beaten Sartaj is questioned by Jhujar, who is a key member in the drug racket. Sartaj says whatever he did was for the sake of Punjab. At the same time, Tommy enters the house. Sartaj grabs Jhujar's pistol and shoots the whole gang before freeing Balli. Tommy helps Bauria escape from her captors. Balli kneels and cries in front of his brother, whose face is expressionless.\n\nIt is shown that the government issued an inquiry into Maninder Brar's activities and there has been a huge crackdown on the drug menace. In [[Goa]], amidst his crew members, Tommy calls Bauria to ask for her real name. Sitting by the beach, she catches sight of a foreigner having fun. Inspired, she utters \"Mary Jane\".{{efn|According to the director, \"Mary Jane\", as the name of Bhatt's character, is an allusion to the drug [[marijuana]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/%E2%80%9CI-want-to-make-mainstream-movies-but-not-by-losing-myself-in-the-process%E2%80%9D/article14395252.ece |title=\u201cI want to make mainstream movies but not by losing myself in the process\u201d |last=Ghosh |first=Sankhayan |date=2016-06-22 |work=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=2018-07-26}}</ref>}}\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Shahid Kapoor]] as Tejinder \"Tommy\" Singh a.k.a.

The [[Warsaw Confederation]] (1573) guaranteed religious freedom for the Polish nobility ''(szlachta)'' and townsfolk ''(mieszczanie)''. However, the [[peasant]]s ''(ch\u0142opi)'' were still subject to severe limitations imposed on them by the nobility.<ref name=\"Dembkowski/Lublin\" /> The establishment of the Commonwealth coincided with a period of stability and prosperity in Poland, with the union thereafter becoming a European power and a major cultural entity, occupying approximately one million square kilometers of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as an agent for the dissemination of [[Western culture]] through [[Polonization]] into areas of modern-day Lithuania, Latvia, Ukraine, Belarus and western Russia.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] suffered from a number of dynastic crises during the reigns of the [[House of Vasa|Vasa]] kings [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]] and [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa|W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV]] and found itself engaged in major conflicts with [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]], Sweden and the Ottoman Empire, as well as a series of minor [[Cossacks|Cossack]] uprisings.<ref name=\"gierowski\" /> In 1610, a Polish army under command [[Hetman]] [[Stanis\u0142aw \u017b\u00f3\u0142kiewski]] seized Moscow after winning the [[Battle of Klushino]].

Starting in 1648, the [[Cossack]] [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] engulfed the south and east, eventually leaving Ukraine divided, with the eastern part, lost by the Commonwealth, becoming a dependency of the Tsardom of Russia. This was followed by the [[Deluge (history)|'Deluge']], a Swedish invasion of Poland, which marched through the Polish heartlands and ruined the country's population, culture and infrastructure\u2014around four million of Poland's eleven million inhabitants died in famines and epidemics throughout the 17th century.<ref name=\"britannica1\" /> However, under [[John III Sobieski]] the Commonwealth's military prowess was re-established, and in 1683 Polish forces played a major role in the [[Battle of Vienna]] against the [[Ottoman Army (15th-19th centuries)|Ottoman Army]], commanded by [[Kara Mustafa Pasha|Kara Mustafa]], the Grand Vizier of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\n[[File:Jan III Schultz.jpg|thumb|left|upright|King [[John III Sobieski]] defeated the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] at the [[Battle of Vienna]] on 12 September 1683.]]\n\nSobieski's reign marked the end of the nation's golden era. Finding itself subjected to almost constant warfare and suffering enormous population losses as well as massive damage to its economy, the Commonwealth fell into decline. The government became ineffective as a result of large-scale internal conflicts (e.g. [[Lubomirski Rebellion]] against [[John II Casimir Vasa|John II Casimir]] and rebellious [[confederation (Poland)|confederations]]) and corrupted legislative processes. The nobility fell under the control of a handful of ''[[magnat (Poland)|magnats]]'', and this, compounded with two relatively weak kings of the [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxon]] [[House of Wettin|Wettin dynasty]], [[Augustus II the Strong|Augustus II]] and [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]], as well as the rise of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Prussia]] after the [[Great Northern War]] only served to worsen the Commonwealth's plight.

The most populous capital city of Warsaw replaced [[Gda\u0144sk]] (Danzig) as the leading centre of commerce, and the role of the more prosperous townsmen increased.\n\n=== Partitions ===\n{{Main|History of Poland (1795\u20131918)|Partitions of Poland|}}\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw II August Poniatowski in coronation clothes.PNG|thumb|upright|[[Stanis\u0142aw II Augustus]], the last [[King of Poland]], ascended to the throne in 1764 and reigned until his abdication on 25 November 1795.]]\n\nThe [[Royal elections in Poland|royal election]] of 1764 resulted in the elevation of [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanis\u0142aw II August]] (a Polish aristocrat connected to the [[Czartoryski family]] faction of [[magnates]]) to the monarchy. However, as a one-time personal admirer of Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]], the new king spent much of his reign torn between his desire to implement reforms necessary to save his nation, and his perceived necessity to remain in a political relationship with his Russian sponsor. This led to the formation of the 1768 [[Bar Confederation]], a ''szlachta'' rebellion directed against the Polish king and his Russian sponsors, which aimed to preserve Poland's independence and the szlachta's traditional privileges.\nAttempts at reform provoked the union's neighbours, and in 1772 the [[First Partition of Poland|First Partition of the Commonwealth]] by Prussia, Russia and Austria took place; an act which the \"[[Partition Sejm]]\", under considerable duress, eventually \"ratified\" ''fait accompli''.<ref name=\"wydawnictwo\" /> Disregarding this loss, in 1773 the king established the [[Commission of National Education]], the first government education authority in Europe.

However, this document, accused by detractors of harbouring revolutionary sympathies, generated strong opposition from the Commonwealth's nobles and conservatives as well as from Catherine II, who, determined to prevent the rebirth of a strong Commonwealth set about planning the final dismemberment of the Polish-Lithuanian state. Russia was aided in achieving its goal when the [[Targowica Confederation]], an organisation of Polish nobles, appealed to the Empress for help. In May 1792, Russian forces crossed the Commonwealth's frontier, thus beginning the [[Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792|Polish-Russian War]].\n\nThe defensive war fought by the Poles ended prematurely when the King, convinced of the futility of resistance, capitulated and joined the Targowica Confederation. The Confederation then took over the government. Russia and Prussia, fearing the mere existence of a Polish state, arranged for, and in 1793 executed, the [[Second Partition of Poland|Second Partition of the Commonwealth]], which left the country deprived of so much territory that it was practically incapable of independent existence.

The event is often referred to as the \"Miracle at the Vistula\".<ref name=\"G\u0142os\" />\n\n[[File:RzeczpospolitaII.png|thumb|Map of Poland during the [[Interwar period]], 1921\u201339]]\n\nDuring this period, Poland successfully managed to fuse the territories of the three former partitioning powers into a cohesive nation state. Railways were restructured to direct traffic towards [[Warsaw]] instead of the former imperial capitals, a new network of national roads was gradually built up and a [[Gdynia|major seaport]] was opened on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] Coast, so as to allow Polish exports and imports to bypass the politically charged [[Free City of Danzig]].\n\nThe inter-war period heralded in a new era of Polish politics. Whilst Polish political activists had faced heavy censorship in the decades up until the First World War, the country now found itself trying to establish a new political tradition. For this reason, many exiled Polish activists, such as [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]] (who would later become prime minister) returned home to help; a significant number of them then went on to take key positions in the newly formed political and governmental structures. Tragedy struck in 1922 when [[Gabriel Narutowicz]], inaugural holder of the presidency, was assassinated at the [[Zach\u0119ta]] Gallery in Warsaw by painter and right-wing nationalist [[Eligiusz Niewiadomski]].<ref name=\"bitter\" />\n\nIn 1926, a [[May Coup (Poland)|May coup]], led by the hero of the Polish independence campaign Marshal [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], turned rule of the Second Polish Republic over to the nonpartisan [[Sanacja]] (''Healing'') movement in an effort to prevent radical political organizations on both the left and the right from destabilizing the country.{{efn|1=The Polish word \"sanacja\" is defined identically as \"\u0142[aci\u0144ski]: ''uzdrowienie'' (''L[atin]'':  healing) in ''S\u0142ownik wyraz\u00f3w obcych'' [''Dictionary of Foreign Expressions''], 1918 (8 years before Pi\u0142sudski's  May Coup);<ref>''S\u0142ownik wyraz\u00f3w obcych'' [''Dictionary of Foreign Expressions''], New York, Polish Book Importing Co., 1918, p. 701.</ref> and in ''M.

This action angered many Poles who considered it a [[Yalta betrayal|betrayal]] by the Allies. In 1944, Stalin had made guarantees to [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] that he would maintain Poland's sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place. However, upon achieving victory in 1945, the elections organized by the occupying Soviet authorities were falsified and were used to provide a veneer of legitimacy for Soviet hegemony over Polish affairs. The Soviet Union instituted a new [[communist state|communist]] government in Poland, analogous to much of the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. [[Anti-Communism in the Communist Bloc|As elsewhere in Communist Europe]], the Soviet influence over Poland was met with [[Cursed soldiers|armed resistance]] from the outset which continued into the 1950s.\n\nDespite widespread objections, the new Polish government accepted the Soviet annexation of the pre-war eastern regions of Poland<ref name=\"indianapolis\" /> (in particular the cities of [[Wilno]] and [[Lw\u00f3w]]) and agreed to the permanent garrisoning of [[Red Army]] units on Poland's territory. Military alignment within the [[Warsaw Pact]] throughout the [[Cold War]] came about as a direct result of this change in Poland's political culture. In the European scene, it came to characterize the full-fledged integration of Poland into the brotherhood of communist nations.\n\nThe new communist government took control with the adoption of the [[Small Constitution of 1947|Small Constitution]] on 19 February 1947. The [[Polish People's Republic]] (''Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa'') [[Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland|was officially proclaimed in 1952]]. In 1956, after the death of [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]], the r\u00e9gime of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] became temporarily more liberal, freeing many people from prison and expanding some personal freedoms. [[Collectivization in the Polish People's Republic]] failed. A similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under [[Edward Gierek]], but most of the time persecution of [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland|anti-communist opposition]] groups persisted.

In the north-west is the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seacoast, which extends from the [[Bay of Pomerania]] to the [[Gda\u0144sk Bay|Gulf of Gda\u0144sk]]. This coast is marked by several [[spit (landform)|spits]], coastal lakes (former bays that have been cut off from the sea), and dunes. The largely straight coastline is indented by the [[Szczecin Lagoon]], the [[Bay of Puck]], and the [[Vistula Lagoon]].\n\nThe centre and parts of the north of the country lie within the [[North European Plain]]. Rising above these lowlands is a geographical region comprising four hilly districts of [[moraine]]s and [[moraine-dammed lake]]s formed during and after the [[Quaternary glaciation|Pleistocene ice age]]. These lake districts are the [[Pomerania]]n Lake District, the Greater Polish Lake District, the [[Kashubia]]n Lake District, and the [[Masurian Lake District]]. The Masurian Lake District is the largest of the four and covers much of north-eastern Poland. The lake districts form part of the Baltic Ridge, a series of moraine belts along the southern shore of the [[Baltic Sea]].\n\nSouth of the Northern European Plain are the regions of [[Lusatia]], [[Silesia]] and [[Masovia]], which are marked by broad ice-age river valleys. Farther south is a mountainous region, including the [[Sudetes]], the [[Krak\u00f3w-Cz\u0119stochowa Upland]]s, the [[\u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Mountains]], and the [[Carpathian Mountains]], including the [[Beskids]]. The highest part of the Carpathians is the [[Tatra Mountains]], along Poland's southern border.\n\n=== Geology ===\n[[File:Brama Krakowska, Dolina Pr\u0105dnika.jpg|thumb|left|[[Krak\u00f3w-Cz\u0119stochowa Upland]]s in the [[Lesser Poland]] region]]\n\nThe geological structure of Poland has been shaped by the [[continental collision]] of Europe and Africa over the past 60&nbsp;million years and, more recently, by the [[Quaternary]] glaciations of northern Europe. Both processes shaped the [[Sudetes]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The moraine landscape of northern Poland contains soils made up mostly of sand or [[loam]], while the ice age river valleys of the south often contain [[loess]]. The [[Polish Jura]], the [[Pieniny]], and the [[Western Tatras]] consist of [[limestone]], while the [[High Tatras]], the [[Beskids]], and the [[Karkonosze]] are made up mainly of [[granite]] and [[basalt]]s. The [[Polish Jura Chain]] has some of the oldest rock formation on the continent of Europe.\n\n[[File:Morskie Oko o poranku.jpg|thumb|[[Morskie Oko]] at the foothill of [[Tatra Mountains]] in southern Poland which average 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) in elevation]]\n\nPoland has 70 mountains over {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} in elevation, all in the [[Tatras]]. The Polish Tatras, which consist of the High Tatras and the Western Tatras, is the highest mountain group of Poland and of the entire Carpathian range. In the High Tatras lies Poland's highest point, the north-western summit of [[Rysy]], {{convert|2499|m|ft|0}} in elevation. At its foot lie the mountain lakes of [[Czarny Staw pod Rysami]] (Black Lake below Mount Rysy) and [[Morskie Oko]] (the Eye of the Sea), both naturally-made [[tarn (lake)|tarns]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ciaworldfactbook.us/europe/poland.html|title=Poland \u2013 CIA World Factbook |website=www.ciaworldfactbook.us}}</ref>\n\nThe second highest mountain group in Poland is the [[Beskids]], whose highest peak is [[Babia G\u00f3ra]], at {{convert|1725|m|ft|0}}.

Historically, the most famous Polish legal act is the [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]]. Historian [[Norman Davies]] describes it as the first of its kind in Europe.<ref name=\"Davies 699\" /> The Constitution was instituted as a [[Government Act]] ({{lang-pl|Ustawa rz\u0105dowa}}) and then adopted on 3 May 1791 by the [[Sejm]] of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Primarily, it was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the [[federation|federative]] Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and its [[Golden Liberty]]. Previously only the [[Henrician Articles]] (1573) signed by each of Poland's elected kings could perform the function of a set of basic laws.\n\n[[File:Manuscript of the Constitution of the 3rd May 1791.PNG|thumb|upright|left|The [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|''Constitution of 3 May'']] adopted in 1791 was the first modern constitution in Europe.<ref name=\"Davies 699\" />]]\n\nThe new Constitution introduced political equality between [[townspeople]] and the [[nobility]] (''[[szlachta]]''), and placed the [[peasant]]s under the protection of the government. The Constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the ''[[liberum veto]]'', which at one time had placed the Sejm at the mercy of any deputy who might choose, or be [[bribery|bribed]] by an interest or foreign power, to have rescinded all the legislation that had been passed by that Sejm. The 3 May Constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy fostered by some of the country's [[reactionary]] [[magnate]]s, with a more [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and democratic [[constitutional monarchy]].

Poland's precursor of feminism was [[Narcyza \u017bmichowska]], also known by her pen name ''Gabryella'', who founded a group of [[Suffragettes]] in 1842. Prior to the [[Third Partition of Poland|last Partition]] in 1795, tax-paying females were allowed to take part in political life. Since 1918, following the return to independence, all women could vote. Poland was the 15th (12th sovereign) country to introduce universal women's suffrage.

It guarantees a multi-party state, the freedoms of religion, speech and assembly, and specifically casts off many Communist ideals to create a '[[free market]] [[economic system]]'. It requires public officials to pursue ecologically sound public policy and acknowledges the inviolability of the home, the right to form trade unions, and to strike, whilst at the same time prohibiting the practices of forced medical experimentation, torture and corporal punishment.\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Poland|List of diplomatic missions of Poland}}\nIn recent years, Poland has extended its responsibilities and position in European and international affairs, supporting and establishing friendly relations with other European nations and many 'developing' countries.\n\nPoland is a member of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], the [[United Nations|UN]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), [[European Economic Area]], [[International Energy Agency]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], [[European Space Agency]], [[G6 (EU)|G6]], [[Council of the Baltic Sea States]], [[Visegr\u00e1d Group]], [[Weimar Triangle]] and [[Schengen Agreement]].\n\nIn 1994, Poland became an associate member of the European Union (EU) and its defensive arm, the [[Western European Union]] (WEU), having submitted preliminary documentation for full membership in 1996, it formally joined the European Union in May 2004, along with the other members of the [[Visegr\u00e1d group]]. In 1996, Poland achieved full [[OECD]] membership, and at the 1997 Madrid Summit was invited to join the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) in the first wave of [[Enlargement of NATO|policy enlargement]] finally becoming a full member of NATO in March 1999.\n\n[[File:Ministerstwo Spraw Zagraniczych al. Szucha 23.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], located in [[Warsaw]]]]\n\nAs changes since the fall of Communism in 1989 have redrawn the map of Europe, Poland has tried to forge strong and mutually beneficial relationships with its seven new neighbours, this has notably included signing 'friendship treaties' to replace links severed by the collapse of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Poland has forged a special relationships with [[Ukraine]],<ref name=\"grushenko\" /> with whom it co-hosted the UEFA [[Euro 2012]] football tournament, in an effort to firmly anchor the country within the Western world and provide it with an alternative to aligning itself with the [[Russian Federation]]. Despite many positive developments in the region, Poland has found itself in a position where it must seek to defend the rights of ethnic Poles living in the [[former Soviet Union]]; this is particularly true of [[Belarus]], where in 2005 the [[Lukashenko]] regime launched a campaign against the Polish ethnic minority.<ref name=\"Bordering on madness: Belarus mistreats its Polish minority\" />\n\nPoland is the [[List of European Union member states by population|fifth most populous member state]] of the European Union and has a grand total of 51 representatives in the [[European Parliament]]. Ever since joining the union in 2004, successive Polish governments have pursued policies to increase the country's role in European and regional affairs.\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n{{Main|Administrative divisions of Poland}}\n\nPoland's current [[Voivodeships of Poland|voivodeships]] (provinces) are largely based on the country's historic regions, whereas those of the past two decades (to 1998) had been centred on and named for individual cities. The new units range in area from less than {{convert|10000|km2|sqmi}} for Opole Voivodeship to more than {{convert|35000|km2|sqmi}} for Masovian Voivodeship. Administrative authority at voivodeship level is shared between a government-appointed [[voivode]] (governor), an elected regional assembly (''[[Voivodeship sejmik|sejmik]]'') and a voivodeship marshal, an executive elected by that assembly.\n\nThe voivodeships are subdivided into ''[[powiat]]s'' (often referred to in English as counties), and these are further divided into ''[[gmina]]s'' (also known as communes or municipalities). Major cities normally have the status of both ''gmina'' and ''powiat''. Poland has 16 voivodeships, 380 powiats (including 66 cities with ''powiat'' status), and 2,478 ''gminas''.\n\n{| style=\"background:none;\"\n|-\n|\n{{Image label begin|image=Poland location map.svg|width=400|float=left|padding=15px}} <!--\n===== Polish Regions =====\n-->{{Image label small|x=0.37|y=0.161|scale=400|text ={{flagicon|Pomeranian Voivodeship}}<br />[[Pomeranian Voivodeship|Pomeranian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.13|y=0.25|scale=400| text= {{flagicon|West Pomeranian Voivodeship}}<br />[[West Pomeranian Voivodeship|West<br /> Pomeranian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.61|y=0.22|scale=400|text={{flagicon|Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship}}<br />[[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship|Warmian-Masurian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.83|y=0.32|scale=400| text={{flagicon|Podlaskie Voivodeship}}<br />[[Podlaskie Voivodeship|Podlaskie]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.668|y=0.43|scale=400|text={{flagicon|Masovian Voivodeship}}<br />[[Masovian Voivodeship|Masovian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.41|y=0.33|scale=400|text={{flagicon|Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship}}<br />[[Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Kuyavian-<br />Pomeranian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.28|y=0.47|scale=400|text ={{flagicon|Greater Poland Voivodeship}}<br />[[Greater Poland Voivodeship|Greater Poland]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.15|y=0.48|scale=400|text ={{flagicon|Lubusz Voivodeship}}<br />[[Lubusz Voivodeship|Lubusz]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.20|y=0.62|scale=400|text ={{flagicon|Lower Silesian Voivodeship}}<br />[[Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Lower Silesian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.55|y=0.562|scale=400|text={{flagicon|\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship}}<br />[[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship|\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.40|y=0.70|scale=400|text ={{flagicon|Opole Voivodeship}}<br />[[Opole Voivodeship|Opole]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.86|y=0.60|scale=400|text={{flagicon|Lublin Voivodeship}}<br />[[Lublin Voivodeship|Lublin]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.62|y=0.82| scale=400|text={{flagicon|Lesser Poland Voivodeship}}<br />[[Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Lesser<br />Poland]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.75|y=0.80| scale=400|text={{flagicon|Podkarpackie Voivodeship}}<br />[[Subcarpathian Voivodeship|Subcarpathian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.64|y=0.69| scale=400|text={{flagicon|\u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Voivodeship}}<br />[[\u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Voivodeship|Holy Cross]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.48|y=0.75| scale=400|text={{flagicon|Silesian Voivodeship}}<br />[[Silesian Voivodeship|Silesian]]}}<!--\n\n===== Other countries =====\n-->{{Image label small|x=0.69| y=0.11|scale=400| text=[[Kaliningrad Oblast|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5\">Kaliningrad<br />(Russia)</i>]] }}\n{{Image label small|x=0.915|y=0.100|scale=400| text=[[Lithuania|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5\">Lithuania</i>]] }}\n{{Image label small|x=0.94|y=0.47|scale=400| text=[[Belarus|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5\">Belarus</i>]] }}\n{{Image label small|x=0.93|y=0.88|scale=400| text=[[Ukraine|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5\">Ukraine</i>]] }}\n{{Image label small|x=0.52| y=0.975|scale=400| text=[[Slovakia|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5;\">Slovakia</i>]] }}\n{{Image label small|x=0.12| y=0.86|scale=400| text=[[Czech Republic|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5;\">Czech Republic</i>]] }}\n{{Image label small|x=0.05| y=0.57|scale=400| text=[[Germany|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5;\">Germany</i>]] }}<!--\n===== Seas \u2013 Oceans \u2013 Etc =====\n-->{{Image label small|x=0.20|y=0.10|scale=400| text=[[Baltic Sea|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5\">Baltic Sea</i>]] }}\n{{Image label end}}\n\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"| [[Voivodeship]] !!rowspan=\"2\"| [[List of cities and towns in Poland|Capital city or cities]]\n|-\n!

The current position of the Polish Air Force is much the same; it has routinely taken part in [[Baltic Air Policing]] assignments, but otherwise, with the exception of a number of units serving in [[Afghanistan]], has seen no active combat. In 2003, the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16C]] Block 52 was chosen as the new general multi-role fighter for the air force, the first deliveries taking place in November 2006.\n\n[[File:Ex STEADFAST JAZZ (10710349373).jpg|thumb|left|Crew of a [[KTO Rosomak]] [[Armoured personnel carrier|armored personnel carrier]] during a [[NATO]] exercise at the Military Training Area near [[Drawsko Pomorskie]]]]\n\nThe most important mission of the armed forces is the defence of Polish territorial integrity and Polish interests abroad.<ref name=\"mil\" /> Poland's national security goal is to further integrate with [[NATO]] and European defence, economic, and political institutions through the modernisation and reorganisation of its military.<ref name=\"mil\" /> The armed forces are being re-organised according to NATO standards, and since 2010, the transition to an entirely contract-based military has been completed.

Many power plants nationwide use Poland's position as a major European exporter of coal to their advantage by continuing to use coal as the primary raw material in production of their energy. In 2013, Poland scored 48 out of 129 states in the Energy Sustainability Index.<ref name=\"Energy Sustainability Index\" /> The three largest Polish coal mining firms ([[W\u0119glokoks]], [[Kompania W\u0119glowa]] and [[Jastrz\u0119bska Sp\u00f3\u0142ka W\u0119glowa|JSW]]) extract around 100 million tonnes of coal annually.

This is to be achieved mainly through the construction of [[wind farm]]s and a number of [[hydroelectric]] stations.\n\nPoland has around 164,800,000,000 m<sup>3</sup> of proven natural gas reserves and around 96,380,000 barrels of proven oil reserves. These reserves are exploited by energy supply companies such as [[PKN Orlen]] (\"the only Polish company listed in the [[Fortune Global 500]]\"), [[PGNiG]]. However, the small amounts of fossil fuels naturally occurring in Poland is insufficient to satisfy the full energy consumption needs of the population. Therefore, the country is a net importer of oil and natural gas.\n\nThe 5 largest companies supplying Poland electricity are [[Polska Grupa Energetyczna|PGE]], [[Tauron Group|Tauron]], [[Enea SA|Enea]], [[:pl:Energa|Energa]] and [[Innogy|Innogy Poland]].\n\n=== Transport ===\n{{Main|Transport in Poland|List of airports in Poland|Highways in Poland}}\n[[File:Wezelsosnicafromthesky.JPG|thumb|[[A1 autostrada (Poland)|A1]], [[A4 autostrada (Poland)|A4]] motorways and [[National roads in Poland|express road 44]] junction near [[Gliwice]]]]\nTransport in Poland is provided by means of [[Rail transport in Poland|rail]], [[Roads and expressways in Poland|road]], [[Polish Merchant Navy|marine shipping]] and [[List of airports in Poland|air travel]].

In 1264, the [[Statute of Kalisz]], also known as a Charter of Jewish Liberties, granted [[Jews]] living in the Polish lands unprecedented legal rights not found anywhere in Europe. In 1424, the Polish king was pressed by the Bishops to issue the [[Edict of Wielu\u0144]], outlawing early Protestant [[Hussite|Hussitism]]. Then in 1573, the [[Warsaw Confederation]] marked the formal beginning of extensive religious freedoms granted to all faiths in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The act was not imposed by a king or consequence of war, but rather resulted from the actions of members of the Polish-Lithuanian society. It was also influenced by the events of the 1572 French [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], which prompted the Polish-Lithuanian nobility to see that no monarch would ever be able to carry out such reprehensible atrocities in Poland.

It is compulsory that children participate in one year of formal education before entering the 1st class at no later than 7 years of age. Corporal punishment of children in schools is officially prohibited since 1783 (before the partitions) and criminalised since 2010 (in schools as well as at home).\n\nAt the end of the 6th class when students are 13, students take a compulsory exam that will determine their acceptance and transition into a specific lower secondary school (''gimnazjum''\u2014middle school or junior high). They will attend this school for three years during classes 7, 8, and 9. Students then take another compulsory exam to determine the upper secondary level school they will attend. There are several alternatives, the most common being the three years in a ''liceum'' or four years in a [[Technikum (Polish education)|technikum]]. Both end with a maturity examination ([[matura]]\u2014similar to French [[baccalaur\u00e9at]]), and may be followed by several forms of higher education, leading to [[licencjat]] or in\u017cynier (the Polish [[Bologna Process]] first cycle qualification), [[magister (degree)|magister]] (second cycle qualification) and eventually doktor (third cycle qualification).<ref name=\"The impact of the 1999 education reform in Poland\" />\n\nIn Poland, there are 500 university-level institutions for the pursuit of higher education.<ref>Central Statistical Office: [http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/PUBL_E_szkoly_wyzsze_2008.pdf Studenci szk\u00f3\u0142 wy\u017cszych (\u0142\u0105cznie z cudzoziemcami) na dzie\u0144 30 XI 2008.] Number of students at Poland's institutions of higher education, as of 30 November 2008.

Other early compositions, such as the melody of ''[[Bogurodzica]]'' and ''[[God Is Born]]'' (a coronation [[Polonaise (dance)|polonaise]] for Polish kings by an unknown composer), may also date back to this period, however, the first known notable composer, [[Miko\u0142aj z Radomia|Nicholas of Radom]], lived in the 15th century. During the 16th century, two main musical groups \u2013 both based in [[Krak\u00f3w]] and belonging to the King and Archbishop of [[Wawel]] \u2013 led to the rapid development of Polish renaissance music. [[Diomedes Cato]], a native-born Italian who lived in Krak\u00f3w from about the age of five, became a renowned lutenist at the court of Sigismund III, and not only imported some of the musical styles from southern Europe, but blended them with native folk music.<ref name=\"The Music Courts of the Polish Vasas\" />\n\n{{Listen\n| header      = '''[[Fryderyk Chopin]]'''\n| filename    = Frederic Chopin - mazurka no. 4 in a minor, op. 17.ogg\n| title       = Mazurka no. 4 in a minor, op. 17\n| description = [[Mazurka]] ({{lang-pl|mazurek}}), stylized [[folk dance]] in [[triple meter]] (1832), commemorating the [[November Uprising]]\n| help        = no\n| pos         = left\n}}\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, Polish baroque composers mostly wrote either [[liturgical music]] or secular compositions such as [[concerto]]s and [[sonata]]s for voices or instruments.

Also, [[Wojciech Bogus\u0142awski]]'s ''[[:pl:Krakowiacy i G\u00f3rale|Krakowiacy i G\u00f3rale]]'', which premiered in 1794, is regarded as the first Polish national [[opera]].\n\n{{Listen\n| header      = '''[[Ballades (Chopin)|Ballade form]] invented by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]]'''.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chopinmusic.net/works/ballades/ | title=Ballades (Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin) | work=Chopin Music | date=2004\u201313 | accessdate=7 January 2013 | author=Nico Paul | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116214304/http://www.chopinmusic.net/works/ballades/ | archive-date=16 January 2013 | url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| filename    = Frederic Chopin - ballade no. 3 in a flat major, op. 47.ogg\n| title       = Ballade no. 3 in a-flat major, op. 47\n| description = Inspired by poems of [[Adam Mickiewicz]]\n| help        = no\n| pos         = right\n}}\n\nTraditional Polish folk music has had a major effect on the works of many well-known Polish composers, and no more so than on Fryderyk Chopin, a widely recognised national hero of the arts. All of Chopin's [[List of compositions by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|works]] involve the piano and are technically demanding, emphasising nuance and expressive depth. As a great composer, Chopin invented the [[musical form]] known as the [[ballade (classical music)#Instrumental ballades|instrumental ballade]] and made major innovations to the [[piano sonata]], [[mazurka]], [[waltz]], [[nocturne]], [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]], [[\u00e9tude]], [[impromptu]] and [[prelude (music)|pr\u00e9lude]], he was also the composer of a number of polonaises which borrowed heavily from traditional Polish folk music. It is largely thanks to him that such pieces gained great popularity throughout Europe during the 19th century. Nowadays the most distinctive folk music can be heard in the towns and villages of the mountainous south, particularly in the region surrounding the winter resort town of [[Zakopane]].\n\nToday Poland has an active music scene, with the jazz and metal genres being particularly popular among the contemporary populace. Polish jazz musicians such as [[Krzysztof Komeda]] created a unique style, which was most famous in the 1960s and 1970s and continues to be popular to this day. Since the fall of communism throughout Europe, Poland has become a major venue for large-scale music festivals, chief among which are the [[Open'er Festival]], [[Opole Festival]] and [[Sopot Festival]].\n\n=== Art ===\n{{Main|Art in Poland|Young Poland|List of Polish artists}}\n[[File:The Lady with an Ermine.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' (1490) by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

The architectural style of [[Wroc\u0142aw]] is mainly representative of German architecture, since it was for centuries located within the Holy Roman Empire. The centres of [[Kazimierz Dolny]] and [[Sandomierz]] on the [[Vistula]] are good examples of well-preserved medieval towns. Poland's ancient capital, [[Krak\u00f3w]], ranks among the best-preserved [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and Renaissance urban complexes in Europe.\n\nThe second half of the 17th century is marked by [[baroque]] architecture. Side towers, such as those of [[Branicki Palace, Bia\u0142ystok|Branicki Palace]] in Bia\u0142ystok, are typical for the Polish baroque. The classical [[Silesian architecture|Silesian baroque]] is represented by the University in Wroc\u0142aw.

Over decades, Poland has produced outstanding directors, film producers, cartoonists and actors that achieved world fame, especially in [[Hollywood]]. Moreover, Polish inventors played an important role in the development of world cinematography and modern-day television. Among the most famous directors and producers, who worked in Poland as well as abroad are [[Roman Pola\u0144ski]], [[Andrzej Wajda]], [[Samuel Goldwyn]], the [[Warner Brothers|Warner brothers]] ([[Harry Warner|Harry]], [[Albert Warner|Albert]],  [[Sam Warner|Sam]], and [[Jack L.

In 1894, Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski was successful in creating a [[Pleograph]], one of the first cameras in the world. The invention, which took photographs and projected pictures, was built before the [[Lumi\u00e8re brothers]] lodged their patent.<ref name=\"culture.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://culture.pl/en/article/a-foreigners-guide-to-polish-cinema|title=A Foreigner's Guide to Polish Cinema |publisher=Culture.pl|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref> He also patented an [[Aeroscope]], the first successful hand-held operated film camera. In 1897, [[Jan Szczepanik]], obtained a British patent for his [[Telectroscope]]. This prototype of television could easily transmit image and sound, thus allowing a live remote view. Following the invention of appropriate apparatus and technological development in the upcoming years, his then-impossible concept became reality.<ref name=\"culture.pl\" />\n\nPolish cinema developed rapidly in the [[interwar period]]. The most renowned star of the [[silent film]] era was Polish actress [[Pola Negri]]. During this time, the [[Yiddish cinema]] also evolved in Poland. Films in the [[Yiddish language]] with Jewish themes, such as ''[[The Dybbuk (film)|The Dybbuk]]'' (1937), played an important part in pre-war Polish cinematography. In 1945 the government established '[[Film Polski]]', a state-run film production and distribution organization, with director [[Aleksander Ford]] as the head of the company. Ford's ''[[Knights of the Teutonic Order (film)|Knights of the Teutonic Order]]'' (1960) was viewed by millions of people in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and France.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.phil.muni.cz/dedur/?lang=1&id=964|title=Film Culture: Brno 1945\u20131970.

The [[Warsaw Confederation]] (1573) guaranteed religious freedom for the Polish nobility ''(szlachta)'' and townsfolk ''(mieszczanie)''.

Finding itself subjected to almost constant warfare and suffering enormous population losses as well as massive damage to its economy, the Commonwealth fell into decline. The government became ineffective as a result of large-scale internal conflicts (e.g. [[Lubomirski Rebellion]] against [[John II Casimir Vasa|John II Casimir]] and rebellious [[confederation (Poland)|confederations]]) and corrupted legislative processes. The nobility fell under the control of a handful of ''[[magnat (Poland)|magnats]]'', and this, compounded with two relatively weak kings of the [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxon]] [[House of Wettin|Wettin dynasty]], [[Augustus II the Strong|Augustus II]] and [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]], as well as the rise of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Prussia]] after the [[Great Northern War]] only served to worsen the Commonwealth's plight.

The most populous capital city of Warsaw replaced [[Gda\u0144sk]] (Danzig) as the leading centre of commerce, and the role of the more prosperous townsmen increased.\n\n=== Partitions ===\n{{Main|History of Poland (1795\u20131918)|Partitions of Poland|}}\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw II August Poniatowski in coronation clothes.PNG|thumb|upright|[[Stanis\u0142aw II Augustus]], the last [[King of Poland]], ascended to the throne in 1764 and reigned until his abdication on 25 November 1795.]]\n\nThe [[Royal elections in Poland|royal election]] of 1764 resulted in the elevation of [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanis\u0142aw II August]] (a Polish aristocrat connected to the [[Czartoryski family]] faction of [[magnates]]) to the monarchy. However, as a one-time personal admirer of Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]], the new king spent much of his reign torn between his desire to implement reforms necessary to save his nation, and his perceived necessity to remain in a political relationship with his Russian sponsor. This led to the formation of the 1768 [[Bar Confederation]], a ''szlachta'' rebellion directed against the Polish king and his Russian sponsors, which aimed to preserve Poland's independence and the szlachta's traditional privileges.\nAttempts at reform provoked the union's neighbours, and in 1772 the [[First Partition of Poland|First Partition of the Commonwealth]] by Prussia, Russia and Austria took place; an act which the \"[[Partition Sejm]]\", under considerable duress, eventually \"ratified\" ''fait accompli''.<ref name=\"wydawnictwo\" /> Disregarding this loss, in 1773 the king established the [[Commission of National Education]], the first government education authority in Europe.

Russia was aided in achieving its goal when the [[Targowica Confederation]], an organisation of Polish nobles, appealed to the Empress for help. In May 1792, Russian forces crossed the Commonwealth's frontier, thus beginning the [[Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792|Polish-Russian War]].\n\nThe defensive war fought by the Poles ended prematurely when the King, convinced of the futility of resistance, capitulated and joined the Targowica Confederation. The Confederation then took over the government.

They were joined by large segments of Polish society, and together forced Warsaw's Russian garrison to withdraw north of the city.\n\n[[File:MWP 1830 Arsenal.jpg|thumb|Capture of the [[Warsaw Arsenal]] by the Polish Army during the [[November Uprising]] against [[Tsarist autocracy]], 29 November 1830]]\n\nOver the course of the next seven months, Polish forces successfully defeated the Russian armies of Field Marshal [[Hans Karl von Diebitsch]] and a number of other Russian commanders; however, finding themselves in a position unsupported by any other foreign powers, save distant France and the newborn United States, and with Prussia and Austria refusing to allow the import of military supplies through their territories, the Poles accepted that the uprising was doomed to failure. Upon the surrender of Warsaw to General [[Ivan Paskievich]], many Polish troops, feeling they could not go on, withdrew into Prussia and there laid down their arms. After the defeat, the semi-independent Congress Poland lost its constitution, army and legislative assembly, and was integrated more closely with the Russian Empire.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JZ9eBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA249&dq=congress+poland+integration+paskevich#v=onepage&q=congress+poland+integration+paskevich&f=false|title=The Russian Empire: A Multi-ethnic History|first=Andreas|last=Kappeler|date=27 August 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317568100|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Spring of Nations]] (a series of revolutions which swept across Europe), Poles took up arms in the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|Greater Poland Uprising of 1848]] to resist Prussian rule. Initially, the uprising manifested itself in the form of civil disobedience, but eventually turned into an armed struggle when the Prussian military was sent in to pacify the region. Eventually, after several battles the uprising was suppressed by the Prussians, and the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]] was more completely incorporated into Prussia.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8YUuGSKXsFUC&pg=PA140&dq=1848+prussia+uprising+posen#v=onepage&q=1848+prussia+uprising+posen&f=false|title=Paths of Integration: Migrants in Western Europe (1880\u20132004)|first1=Leo|last1=Lucassen|first2=David|last2=Feldman|first3=Jochen|last3=Oltmer|date=6 September 2006|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=9789053568835|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nIn 1863, a new Polish uprising against Russian rule began. The [[January Uprising]] started out as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against [[conscription]] into the Imperial Russian Army. However, the insurrectionists, despite being joined by high-ranking Polish-Lithuanian officers and numerous politicians, were still severely outnumbered and lacking in foreign support. They were forced to resort to guerrilla warfare tactics and failed to win any major military victories. Afterwards no major uprising was witnessed in the Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and Poles resorted instead to fostering economic and cultural self-improvement. Congress Poland was rapidly industrialised towards the end of the 19th century, and successively transformed into the Empire's wealthiest and most developed subject.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kKR8DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA181&dq=january+uprising+economic#v=onepage&q=january+uprising+economic&f=false|title=Poland From Partitions to EU Accession: A Modern Economic History, 1772\u20132004|first=Piotr|last=Kory\u015b|date=29 November 2018|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319971261|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=op5AAQAAIAAJ&q=congress+poland+richest+part&dq=congress+poland+richest+part|title=Zionism|first=Getzel|last=Kressel|date=6 September 1973|publisher=Keter Books|isbn=9780706513264|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nDespite the political unrest experienced during the partitions, Poland did benefit from large-scale industrialisation and modernisation programs, instituted by the occupying powers, which helped it develop into a more economically coherent and viable entity.

A total of 2 million Polish troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers, and 450,000 died. Shortly after the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice with Germany in November 1918]], Poland regained its independence as the [[Second Polish Republic]] (''II Rzeczpospolita Polska''). It reaffirmed its independence after [[List of wars involving Poland|a series of military conflicts]], the most notable being the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] (1919\u201321) when Poland inflicted a crushing defeat on the [[Red Army]] at the [[battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]], an event which is considered to have halted the advance of Communism into Europe and forced [[Vladimir Lenin]] to rethink his objective of achieving global socialism.

Railways were restructured to direct traffic towards [[Warsaw]] instead of the former imperial capitals, a new network of national roads was gradually built up and a [[Gdynia|major seaport]] was opened on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] Coast, so as to allow Polish exports and imports to bypass the politically charged [[Free City of Danzig]].\n\nThe inter-war period heralded in a new era of Polish politics. Whilst Polish political activists had faced heavy censorship in the decades up until the First World War, the country now found itself trying to establish a new political tradition. For this reason, many exiled Polish activists, such as [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]] (who would later become prime minister) returned home to help; a significant number of them then went on to take key positions in the newly formed political and governmental structures. Tragedy struck in 1922 when [[Gabriel Narutowicz]], inaugural holder of the presidency, was assassinated at the [[Zach\u0119ta]] Gallery in Warsaw by painter and right-wing nationalist [[Eligiusz Niewiadomski]].<ref name=\"bitter\" />\n\nIn 1926, a [[May Coup (Poland)|May coup]], led by the hero of the Polish independence campaign Marshal [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], turned rule of the Second Polish Republic over to the nonpartisan [[Sanacja]] (''Healing'') movement in an effort to prevent radical political organizations on both the left and the right from destabilizing the country.{{efn|1=The Polish word \"sanacja\" is defined identically as \"\u0142[aci\u0144ski]: ''uzdrowienie'' (''L[atin]'':  healing) in ''S\u0142ownik wyraz\u00f3w obcych'' [''Dictionary of Foreign Expressions''], 1918 (8 years before Pi\u0142sudski's  May Coup);<ref>''S\u0142ownik wyraz\u00f3w obcych'' [''Dictionary of Foreign Expressions''], New York, Polish Book Importing Co., 1918, p. 701.</ref> and in ''M.

This action angered many Poles who considered it a [[Yalta betrayal|betrayal]] by the Allies. In 1944, Stalin had made guarantees to [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] that he would maintain Poland's sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place. However, upon achieving victory in 1945, the elections organized by the occupying Soviet authorities were falsified and were used to provide a veneer of legitimacy for Soviet hegemony over Polish affairs. The Soviet Union instituted a new [[communist state|communist]] government in Poland, analogous to much of the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. [[Anti-Communism in the Communist Bloc|As elsewhere in Communist Europe]], the Soviet influence over Poland was met with [[Cursed soldiers|armed resistance]] from the outset which continued into the 1950s.\n\nDespite widespread objections, the new Polish government accepted the Soviet annexation of the pre-war eastern regions of Poland<ref name=\"indianapolis\" /> (in particular the cities of [[Wilno]] and [[Lw\u00f3w]]) and agreed to the permanent garrisoning of [[Red Army]] units on Poland's territory. Military alignment within the [[Warsaw Pact]] throughout the [[Cold War]] came about as a direct result of this change in Poland's political culture. In the European scene, it came to characterize the full-fledged integration of Poland into the brotherhood of communist nations.\n\nThe new communist government took control with the adoption of the [[Small Constitution of 1947|Small Constitution]] on 19 February 1947. The [[Polish People's Republic]] (''Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa'') [[Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland|was officially proclaimed in 1952]]. In 1956, after the death of [[Boles\u0142aw Bierut]], the r\u00e9gime of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]] became temporarily more liberal, freeing many people from prison and expanding some personal freedoms. [[Collectivization in the Polish People's Republic]] failed. A similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under [[Edward Gierek]], but most of the time persecution of [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland|anti-communist opposition]] groups persisted. Despite this, Poland was at the time considered to be one of the least oppressive states of the Eastern Bloc.<ref name=\"PWN_historia\" />\n\nLabour turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent trade union \"[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]\" (\"''Solidarno\u015b\u0107''\"), which over time became a political force. Despite persecution and imposition of [[Martial law in Poland|martial law in 1981]], it eroded the dominance of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] and by 1989 had triumphed in Poland's first [[Contract Sejm|partially free and democratic parliamentary elections]] since the end of the Second World War.

Also, in east Poland, it formed the [[Lithuanian\u2013Polish\u2013Ukrainian Brigade|LITPOLUKRBRIG]] battle groups with Lithuania and Ukraine.

In the north-west is the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seacoast, which extends from the [[Bay of Pomerania]] to the [[Gda\u0144sk Bay|Gulf of Gda\u0144sk]]. This coast is marked by several [[spit (landform)|spits]], coastal lakes (former bays that have been cut off from the sea), and dunes. The largely straight coastline is indented by the [[Szczecin Lagoon]], the [[Bay of Puck]], and the [[Vistula Lagoon]].\n\nThe centre and parts of the north of the country lie within the [[North European Plain]]. Rising above these lowlands is a geographical region comprising four hilly districts of [[moraine]]s and [[moraine-dammed lake]]s formed during and after the [[Quaternary glaciation|Pleistocene ice age]]. These lake districts are the [[Pomerania]]n Lake District, the Greater Polish Lake District, the [[Kashubia]]n Lake District, and the [[Masurian Lake District]]. The Masurian Lake District is the largest of the four and covers much of north-eastern Poland. The lake districts form part of the Baltic Ridge, a series of moraine belts along the southern shore of the [[Baltic Sea]].\n\nSouth of the Northern European Plain are the regions of [[Lusatia]], [[Silesia]] and [[Masovia]], which are marked by broad ice-age river valleys. Farther south is a mountainous region, including the [[Sudetes]], the [[Krak\u00f3w-Cz\u0119stochowa Upland]]s, the [[\u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Mountains]], and the [[Carpathian Mountains]], including the [[Beskids]]. The highest part of the Carpathians is the [[Tatra Mountains]], along Poland's southern border.\n\n=== Geology ===\n[[File:Brama Krakowska, Dolina Pr\u0105dnika.jpg|thumb|left|[[Krak\u00f3w-Cz\u0119stochowa Upland]]s in the [[Lesser Poland]] region]]\n\nThe geological structure of Poland has been shaped by the [[continental collision]] of Europe and Africa over the past 60&nbsp;million years and, more recently, by the [[Quaternary]] glaciations of northern Europe. Both processes shaped the [[Sudetes]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The moraine landscape of northern Poland contains soils made up mostly of sand or [[loam]], while the ice age river valleys of the south often contain [[loess]]. The [[Polish Jura]], the [[Pieniny]], and the [[Western Tatras]] consist of [[limestone]], while the [[High Tatras]], the [[Beskids]], and the [[Karkonosze]] are made up mainly of [[granite]] and [[basalt]]s. The [[Polish Jura Chain]] has some of the oldest rock formation on the continent of Europe.\n\n[[File:Morskie Oko o poranku.jpg|thumb|[[Morskie Oko]] at the foothill of [[Tatra Mountains]] in southern Poland which average 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) in elevation]]\n\nPoland has 70 mountains over {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} in elevation, all in the [[Tatras]]. The Polish Tatras, which consist of the High Tatras and the Western Tatras, is the highest mountain group of Poland and of the entire Carpathian range. In the High Tatras lies Poland's highest point, the north-western summit of [[Rysy]], {{convert|2499|m|ft|0}} in elevation. At its foot lie the mountain lakes of [[Czarny Staw pod Rysami]] (Black Lake below Mount Rysy) and [[Morskie Oko]] (the Eye of the Sea), both naturally-made [[tarn (lake)|tarns]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ciaworldfactbook.us/europe/poland.html|title=Poland \u2013 CIA World Factbook |website=www.ciaworldfactbook.us}}</ref>\n\nThe second highest mountain group in Poland is the [[Beskids]], whose highest peak is [[Babia G\u00f3ra]], at {{convert|1725|m|ft|0}}.

It covers an area of {{convert|32|km2|sqmi|0}}. It is not a natural desert but results from human activity from the [[Middle Ages]] onwards.\n\nThe Baltic Sea activity in [[S\u0142owi\u0144ski National Park]] created [[sand dunes]] which in the course of time separated the bay from the sea creating two lakes. As waves and wind carry sand inland the dunes slowly move, at a rate of {{convert|3|to|10|m|ft|1}} per year. Some dunes reach the height of up to {{convert|30|m|ft|0}}.

Primarily, it was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the [[federation|federative]] Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and its [[Golden Liberty]].

The Constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the ''[[liberum veto]]'', which at one time had placed the Sejm at the mercy of any deputy who might choose, or be [[bribery|bribed]] by an interest or foreign power, to have rescinded all the legislation that had been passed by that Sejm. The 3 May Constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy fostered by some of the country's [[reactionary]] [[magnate]]s, with a more [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and democratic [[constitutional monarchy]].

In 1996, Poland achieved full [[OECD]] membership, and at the 1997 Madrid Summit was invited to join the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) in the first wave of [[Enlargement of NATO|policy enlargement]] finally becoming a full member of NATO in March 1999.\n\n[[File:Ministerstwo Spraw Zagraniczych al.

Despite many positive developments in the region, Poland has found itself in a position where it must seek to defend the rights of ethnic Poles living in the [[former Soviet Union]]; this is particularly true of [[Belarus]], where in 2005 the [[Lukashenko]] regime launched a campaign against the Polish ethnic minority.<ref name=\"Bordering on madness: Belarus mistreats its Polish minority\" />\n\nPoland is the [[List of European Union member states by population|fifth most populous member state]] of the European Union and has a grand total of 51 representatives in the [[European Parliament]].

The new units range in area from less than {{convert|10000|km2|sqmi}} for Opole Voivodeship to more than {{convert|35000|km2|sqmi}} for Masovian Voivodeship. Administrative authority at voivodeship level is shared between a government-appointed [[voivode]] (governor), an elected regional assembly (''[[Voivodeship sejmik|sejmik]]'') and a voivodeship marshal, an executive elected by that assembly.\n\nThe voivodeships are subdivided into ''[[powiat]]s'' (often referred to in English as counties), and these are further divided into ''[[gmina]]s'' (also known as communes or municipalities). Major cities normally have the status of both ''gmina'' and ''powiat''. Poland has 16 voivodeships, 380 powiats (including 66 cities with ''powiat'' status), and 2,478 ''gminas''.\n\n{| style=\"background:none;\"\n|-\n|\n{{Image label begin|image=Poland location map.svg|width=400|float=left|padding=15px}} <!--\n===== Polish Regions =====\n-->{{Image label small|x=0.37|y=0.161|scale=400|text ={{flagicon|Pomeranian Voivodeship}}<br />[[Pomeranian Voivodeship|Pomeranian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.13|y=0.25|scale=400| text= {{flagicon|West Pomeranian Voivodeship}}<br />[[West Pomeranian Voivodeship|West<br /> Pomeranian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.61|y=0.22|scale=400|text={{flagicon|Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship}}<br />[[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship|Warmian-Masurian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.83|y=0.32|scale=400| text={{flagicon|Podlaskie Voivodeship}}<br />[[Podlaskie Voivodeship|Podlaskie]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.668|y=0.43|scale=400|text={{flagicon|Masovian Voivodeship}}<br />[[Masovian Voivodeship|Masovian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.41|y=0.33|scale=400|text={{flagicon|Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship}}<br />[[Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Kuyavian-<br />Pomeranian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.28|y=0.47|scale=400|text ={{flagicon|Greater Poland Voivodeship}}<br />[[Greater Poland Voivodeship|Greater Poland]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.15|y=0.48|scale=400|text ={{flagicon|Lubusz Voivodeship}}<br />[[Lubusz Voivodeship|Lubusz]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.20|y=0.62|scale=400|text ={{flagicon|Lower Silesian Voivodeship}}<br />[[Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Lower Silesian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.55|y=0.562|scale=400|text={{flagicon|\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship}}<br />[[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship|\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.40|y=0.70|scale=400|text ={{flagicon|Opole Voivodeship}}<br />[[Opole Voivodeship|Opole]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.86|y=0.60|scale=400|text={{flagicon|Lublin Voivodeship}}<br />[[Lublin Voivodeship|Lublin]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.62|y=0.82| scale=400|text={{flagicon|Lesser Poland Voivodeship}}<br />[[Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Lesser<br />Poland]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.75|y=0.80| scale=400|text={{flagicon|Podkarpackie Voivodeship}}<br />[[Subcarpathian Voivodeship|Subcarpathian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.64|y=0.69| scale=400|text={{flagicon|\u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Voivodeship}}<br />[[\u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Voivodeship|Holy Cross]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.48|y=0.75| scale=400|text={{flagicon|Silesian Voivodeship}}<br />[[Silesian Voivodeship|Silesian]]}}<!--\n\n===== Other countries =====\n-->{{Image label small|x=0.69| y=0.11|scale=400| text=[[Kaliningrad Oblast|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5\">Kaliningrad<br />(Russia)</i>]] }}\n{{Image label small|x=0.915|y=0.100|scale=400| text=[[Lithuania|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5\">Lithuania</i>]] }}\n{{Image label small|x=0.94|y=0.47|scale=400| text=[[Belarus|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5\">Belarus</i>]] }}\n{{Image label small|x=0.93|y=0.88|scale=400| text=[[Ukraine|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5\">Ukraine</i>]] }}\n{{Image label small|x=0.52| y=0.975|scale=400| text=[[Slovakia|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5;\">Slovakia</i>]] }}\n{{Image label small|x=0.12| y=0.86|scale=400| text=[[Czech Republic|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5;\">Czech Republic</i>]] }}\n{{Image label small|x=0.05| y=0.57|scale=400| text=[[Germany|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5;\">Germany</i>]] }}<!--\n===== Seas \u2013 Oceans \u2013 Etc =====\n-->{{Image label small|x=0.20|y=0.10|scale=400| text=[[Baltic Sea|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5\">Baltic Sea</i>]] }}\n{{Image label end}}\n\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"| [[Voivodeship]] !!rowspan=\"2\"| [[List of cities and towns in Poland|Capital city or cities]]\n|-\n!

However, its commander-in-chief is the President of the Republic.\n\nThe Polish army's size is estimated at around 101,500 soldiers (2016). The Polish Navy primarily operates in the Baltic Sea and conducts operations such as maritime patrol, search and rescue for the section of the Baltic under Polish sovereignty, as well as hydrographic measurements and research. Also, the Polish Navy played a more international role as part of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], providing logistical support for the [[United States Navy]]. The current position of the Polish Air Force is much the same; it has routinely taken part in [[Baltic Air Policing]] assignments, but otherwise, with the exception of a number of units serving in [[Afghanistan]], has seen no active combat. In 2003, the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16C]] Block 52 was chosen as the new general multi-role fighter for the air force, the first deliveries taking place in November 2006.\n\n[[File:Ex STEADFAST JAZZ (10710349373).jpg|thumb|left|Crew of a [[KTO Rosomak]] [[Armoured personnel carrier|armored personnel carrier]] during a [[NATO]] exercise at the Military Training Area near [[Drawsko Pomorskie]]]]\n\nThe most important mission of the armed forces is the defence of Polish territorial integrity and Polish interests abroad.<ref name=\"mil\" /> Poland's national security goal is to further integrate with [[NATO]] and European defence, economic, and political institutions through the modernisation and reorganisation of its military.<ref name=\"mil\" /> The armed forces are being re-organised according to NATO standards, and since 2010, the transition to an entirely contract-based military has been completed.

Many power plants nationwide use Poland's position as a major European exporter of coal to their advantage by continuing to use coal as the primary raw material in production of their energy. In 2013, Poland scored 48 out of 129 states in the Energy Sustainability Index.<ref name=\"Energy Sustainability Index\" /> The three largest Polish coal mining firms ([[W\u0119glokoks]], [[Kompania W\u0119glowa]] and [[Jastrz\u0119bska Sp\u00f3\u0142ka W\u0119glowa|JSW]]) extract around 100 million tonnes of coal annually. All three of these companies are key constituents of the [[Warsaw Stock Exchange]]'s lead economic indexes.\n\n[[Renewable energy|Renewable forms of energy]] account for a smaller proportion of Poland's full energy generation capacity.<ref name=\"EU Commission \u2013 Energy factsheet P74\" /> However, the national government has set targets for the development of renewable energy sources in Poland which should see the portion of power produced by renewable resources climb to 15% in 2020 (in 2017 it was 10.9%). This is to be achieved mainly through the construction of [[wind farm]]s and a number of [[hydroelectric]] stations.\n\nPoland has around 164,800,000,000 m<sup>3</sup> of proven natural gas reserves and around 96,380,000 barrels of proven oil reserves. These reserves are exploited by energy supply companies such as [[PKN Orlen]] (\"the only Polish company listed in the [[Fortune Global 500]]\"), [[PGNiG]]. However, the small amounts of fossil fuels naturally occurring in Poland is insufficient to satisfy the full energy consumption needs of the population. Therefore, the country is a net importer of oil and natural gas.\n\nThe 5 largest companies supplying Poland electricity are [[Polska Grupa Energetyczna|PGE]], [[Tauron Group|Tauron]], [[Enea SA|Enea]], [[:pl:Energa|Energa]] and [[Innogy|Innogy Poland]].\n\n=== Transport ===\n{{Main|Transport in Poland|List of airports in Poland|Highways in Poland}}\n[[File:Wezelsosnicafromthesky.JPG|thumb|[[A1 autostrada (Poland)|A1]], [[A4 autostrada (Poland)|A4]] motorways and [[National roads in Poland|express road 44]] junction near [[Gliwice]]]]\nTransport in Poland is provided by means of [[Rail transport in Poland|rail]], [[Roads and expressways in Poland|road]], [[Polish Merchant Navy|marine shipping]] and [[List of airports in Poland|air travel]].

In 1264, the [[Statute of Kalisz]], also known as a Charter of Jewish Liberties, granted [[Jews]] living in the Polish lands unprecedented legal rights not found anywhere in Europe. In 1424, the Polish king was pressed by the Bishops to issue the [[Edict of Wielu\u0144]], outlawing early Protestant [[Hussite|Hussitism]]. Then in 1573, the [[Warsaw Confederation]] marked the formal beginning of extensive religious freedoms granted to all faiths in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

It is compulsory that children participate in one year of formal education before entering the 1st class at no later than 7 years of age. Corporal punishment of children in schools is officially prohibited since 1783 (before the partitions) and criminalised since 2010 (in schools as well as at home).\n\nAt the end of the 6th class when students are 13, students take a compulsory exam that will determine their acceptance and transition into a specific lower secondary school (''gimnazjum''\u2014middle school or junior high). They will attend this school for three years during classes 7, 8, and 9. Students then take another compulsory exam to determine the upper secondary level school they will attend. There are several alternatives, the most common being the three years in a ''liceum'' or four years in a [[Technikum (Polish education)|technikum]]. Both end with a maturity examination ([[matura]]\u2014similar to French [[baccalaur\u00e9at]]), and may be followed by several forms of higher education, leading to [[licencjat]] or in\u017cynier (the Polish [[Bologna Process]] first cycle qualification), [[magister (degree)|magister]] (second cycle qualification) and eventually doktor (third cycle qualification).<ref name=\"The impact of the 1999 education reform in Poland\" />\n\nIn Poland, there are 500 university-level institutions for the pursuit of higher education.<ref>Central Statistical Office: [http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/PUBL_E_szkoly_wyzsze_2008.pdf Studenci szk\u00f3\u0142 wy\u017cszych (\u0142\u0105cznie z cudzoziemcami) na dzie\u0144 30 XI 2008.] Number of students at Poland's institutions of higher education, as of 30 November 2008.

Other early compositions, such as the melody of ''[[Bogurodzica]]'' and ''[[God Is Born]]'' (a coronation [[Polonaise (dance)|polonaise]] for Polish kings by an unknown composer), may also date back to this period, however, the first known notable composer, [[Miko\u0142aj z Radomia|Nicholas of Radom]], lived in the 15th century. During the 16th century, two main musical groups \u2013 both based in [[Krak\u00f3w]] and belonging to the King and Archbishop of [[Wawel]] \u2013 led to the rapid development of Polish renaissance music. [[Diomedes Cato]], a native-born Italian who lived in Krak\u00f3w from about the age of five, became a renowned lutenist at the court of Sigismund III, and not only imported some of the musical styles from southern Europe, but blended them with native folk music.<ref name=\"The Music Courts of the Polish Vasas\" />\n\n{{Listen\n| header      = '''[[Fryderyk Chopin]]'''\n| filename    = Frederic Chopin - mazurka no. 4 in a minor, op. 17.ogg\n| title       = Mazurka no. 4 in a minor, op. 17\n| description = [[Mazurka]] ({{lang-pl|mazurek}}), stylized [[folk dance]] in [[triple meter]] (1832), commemorating the [[November Uprising]]\n| help        = no\n| pos         = left\n}}\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, Polish baroque composers mostly wrote either [[liturgical music]] or secular compositions such as [[concerto]]s and [[sonata]]s for voices or instruments.

All of Chopin's [[List of compositions by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|works]] involve the piano and are technically demanding, emphasising nuance and expressive depth. As a great composer, Chopin invented the [[musical form]] known as the [[ballade (classical music)#Instrumental ballades|instrumental ballade]] and made major innovations to the [[piano sonata]], [[mazurka]], [[waltz]], [[nocturne]], [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]], [[\u00e9tude]], [[impromptu]] and [[prelude (music)|pr\u00e9lude]], he was also the composer of a number of polonaises which borrowed heavily from traditional Polish folk music. It is largely thanks to him that such pieces gained great popularity throughout Europe during the 19th century. Nowadays the most distinctive folk music can be heard in the towns and villages of the mountainous south, particularly in the region surrounding the winter resort town of [[Zakopane]].\n\nToday Poland has an active music scene, with the jazz and metal genres being particularly popular among the contemporary populace. Polish jazz musicians such as [[Krzysztof Komeda]] created a unique style, which was most famous in the 1960s and 1970s and continues to be popular to this day. Since the fall of communism throughout Europe, Poland has become a major venue for large-scale music festivals, chief among which are the [[Open'er Festival]], [[Opole Festival]] and [[Sopot Festival]].\n\n=== Art ===\n{{Main|Art in Poland|Young Poland|List of Polish artists}}\n[[File:The Lady with an Ermine.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' (1490) by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

Some of them have been painstakingly restored, like [[Wawel Castle]], or completely reconstructed, including the [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]] and [[Royal Castle in Warsaw|Royal Castle]] of Warsaw and the Old Town of [[Gda\u0144sk]].\n\nThe architecture of Gda\u0144sk is mostly of the Hanseatic variety, a Gothic style common among the former trading cities along the Baltic sea and in the northern part of Central Europe. The architectural style of [[Wroc\u0142aw]] is mainly representative of German architecture, since it was for centuries located within the Holy Roman Empire. The centres of [[Kazimierz Dolny]] and [[Sandomierz]] on the [[Vistula]] are good examples of well-preserved medieval towns. Poland's ancient capital, [[Krak\u00f3w]], ranks among the best-preserved [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and Renaissance urban complexes in Europe.\n\nThe second half of the 17th century is marked by [[baroque]] architecture. Side towers, such as those of [[Branicki Palace, Bia\u0142ystok|Branicki Palace]] in Bia\u0142ystok, are typical for the Polish baroque.

Over decades, Poland has produced outstanding directors, film producers, cartoonists and actors that achieved world fame, especially in [[Hollywood]].

In 1897, [[Jan Szczepanik]], obtained a British patent for his [[Telectroscope]]. This prototype of television could easily transmit image and sound, thus allowing a live remote view. Following the invention of appropriate apparatus and technological development in the upcoming years, his then-impossible concept became reality.<ref name=\"culture.pl\" />\n\nPolish cinema developed rapidly in the [[interwar period]]. The most renowned star of the [[silent film]] era was Polish actress [[Pola Negri]]. During this time, the [[Yiddish cinema]] also evolved in Poland. Films in the [[Yiddish language]] with Jewish themes, such as ''[[The Dybbuk (film)|The Dybbuk]]'' (1937), played an important part in pre-war Polish cinematography. In 1945 the government established '[[Film Polski]]', a state-run film production and distribution organization, with director [[Aleksander Ford]] as the head of the company.

It is said that Scholar Kachiyappa Sivachariyar wrote ''Vinayakapuranam'' in the Purasawalkam house of Kanthappaiyar. Unlike the title \"Aiyar\" in their names suggest, the Kanthappaiyar family were not [[Brahmins]] but [[Veerashaiva|Veera Saivites]].

The expulsion was brought about the break out of wars in the former [[Yugoslavia]] under which Serbia and Montenegro participated for the last time in 1992.  Unfortunately the EBU stated that too many countries wanted to enter in that year and so some would be forced to withdraw. Serbia and Montenegro (who participated as one country at the time) was one of them.  As a result, [[Serbia and Montenegro]] entered the following year instead.\n\nOriginally the festival was supposed to commence in 2004 and was to be the country's selection for Eurovision however later [[Radio Television of Montenegro]] expressed the wish for a united festival in determining the country's contender at the European event. It was decided that Beovizija would be Serbia's semi final while [[Montevizija]] (held in [[Podgorica]]) would be Montenegro's semi final. The best from the two would compete in a united final show contest under the name [[Evropesma|Evrop(j)esma]].\n[[Image:Beovizija-SC MIR 01-8476734101-2.jpg|thumb|270px|2008 Beovizija stage]]\n[[File:Beovizija.jpg|thumb|right|Beovizija logo used from 2003 to 2009.]]\nThe first Beovizija was held a year before Serbia and Montenegro entered Eurovision and was more of an awards night for the Serbian music industry. In [[Beovizija 2003|2003]] and [[Beovizija 2004|2004]] 28 songs competed while 25 were allowed to compete in [[Beovizija 2005|2005]] and [[Beovizija 2006|2006]]. From 2004 - 2006 there were 8 jury members, from [[Beovizija 2007|2007]] there have been only 3 members of the jury for both the semi-final and final night, while since 2018, 5 jurors vote in every show. In 2004-2006, each juror awarded a set of 12,10,8,7...1 points, with the televote awarding the 9th set of points. From 2007 till today, votes of all jurors are converted into a single set of points, with the televoting awarding another set of points, making it a 50% jury 50% televoting system.\n\nIn 2006 Serbia and Montenegro peacefully split after a referendum. Serbia became an independent country and thus Beovizija became the national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest. The country debuted for the first time independently in 2007. [[Marija \u0160erifovi\u0107]] - Serbia's representative won Eurovision that year.\n\nBeovizija was held over two nights in February. The semi-final consisted of 20 songs. The public's and jury's vote was combined to determine the 10 best songs to proceed to the final. Similarly, the winner of Beovizija was determined. The Serbian music industry awards were handed out on the final night of Beovizija. In 2018, only one show was hosted. Since 2019, Beovizija is held over 3 nights (2 semi finals and a final), with 12 acts performing each night. 6 acts qualify from each semi final, amounting in 12 finalists.\n\nIn 2008 the semi-final were to be held on February 19, 2008 while the final a day later.<ref name=\"rtskonkurs\">[http://ww1.rts.co.rs/euro/jedna_vest.asp?source=komentar&IDNews=626 \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0458\u0430 2008. &mdash; \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d \u0434\u043e 1. \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0435\u043c\u0431\u0440\u0430.]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0441\u043c\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043e-\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0435, 14. \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043c\u0431\u0430\u0440 2007.

In December 2009, RTS announced that it is changing the way it will select its Eurovision competitor and has thus cancelled Beovizija.<ref name=\"\u201eBeovizija ukinuta\">[http://www.blic.rs/Zabava/Vesti/170627/Beovizija-ukinuta \u201eBeovizija\u201c ukinuta] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106032051/http://www.blic.rs/Zabava/Vesti/170627/Beovizija-ukinuta |date=January 6, 2014 }}</ref> However, on January 19, 2018, RTS confirmed the return of Beovizija as a national selection for the [[Serbia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018|Serbian]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018]]<ref name=\"beovizija_return\">{{cite web|title=RTS |url=https://twitter.com/SerbiaESC/status/954403084524048384|website=Twitter|publisher=Official Twitter account of the RTS|accessdate=19 January 2018}}</ref>, and has been used since.\n\n==History==\n[[Serbia and Montenegro]] were originally due  to enter the Eurovision Song Contest for the first time in 2003 since an 11-year expulsion. The expulsion was brought about the break out of wars in the former [[Yugoslavia]] under which Serbia and Montenegro participated for the last time in 1992.  Unfortunately the EBU stated that too many countries wanted to enter in that year and so some would be forced to withdraw. Serbia and Montenegro (who participated as one country at the time) was one of them.  As a result, [[Serbia and Montenegro]] entered the following year instead.\n\nOriginally the festival was supposed to commence in 2004 and was to be the country's selection for Eurovision however later [[Radio Television of Montenegro]] expressed the wish for a united festival in determining the country's contender at the European event. It was decided that Beovizija would be Serbia's semi final while [[Montevizija]] (held in [[Podgorica]]) would be Montenegro's semi final. The best from the two would compete in a united final show contest under the name [[Evropesma|Evrop(j)esma]].\n[[Image:Beovizija-SC MIR 01-8476734101-2.jpg|thumb|270px|2008 Beovizija stage]]\n[[File:Beovizija.jpg|thumb|right|Beovizija logo used from 2003 to 2009.]]\nThe first Beovizija was held a year before Serbia and Montenegro entered Eurovision and was more of an awards night for the Serbian music industry. In [[Beovizija 2003|2003]] and [[Beovizija 2004|2004]] 28 songs competed while 25 were allowed to compete in [[Beovizija 2005|2005]] and [[Beovizija 2006|2006]]. From 2004 - 2006 there were 8 jury members, from [[Beovizija 2007|2007]] there have been only 3 members of the jury for both the semi-final and final night, while since 2018, 5 jurors vote in every show. In 2004-2006, each juror awarded a set of 12,10,8,7...1 points, with the televote awarding the 9th set of points. From 2007 till today, votes of all jurors are converted into a single set of points, with the televoting awarding another set of points, making it a 50% jury 50% televoting system.\n\nIn 2006 Serbia and Montenegro peacefully split after a referendum. Serbia became an independent country and thus Beovizija became the national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest. The country debuted for the first time independently in 2007. [[Marija \u0160erifovi\u0107]] - Serbia's representative won Eurovision that year.\n\nBeovizija was held over two nights in February. The semi-final consisted of 20 songs. The public's and jury's vote was combined to determine the 10 best songs to proceed to the final. Similarly, the winner of Beovizija was determined. The Serbian music industry awards were handed out on the final night of Beovizija. In 2018, only one show was hosted. Since 2019, Beovizija is held over 3 nights (2 semi finals and a final), with 12 acts performing each night. 6 acts qualify from each semi final, amounting in 12 finalists.\n\nIn 2008 the semi-final were to be held on February 19, 2008 while the final a day later.<ref name=\"rtskonkurs\">[http://ww1.rts.co.rs/euro/jedna_vest.asp?source=komentar&IDNews=626 \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0458\u0430 2008. &mdash; \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0443\u0440\u0441 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d \u0434\u043e 1. \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0435\u043c\u0431\u0440\u0430.]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0441\u043c\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u0420\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043e-\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0437\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0435, 14. \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043c\u0431\u0430\u0440 2007.

She taught at [[Cambridge]] and [[King's College London]] after 1963, and became a lecturer at [[Goldsmiths' College]] in 1972. In 1975 she was appointed professor at [[Brandeis University]] and in 1981 at [[Princeton University]], and served as department chair in both. Bent was president of the [[American Musicological Society]] (1984\u20131986), of which she is now a Corresponding Member. She returned to England in 1992 as Senior Research Fellow at [[All Souls College]], [[Oxford University]], where she is now an Emeritus Fellow.<!--removing \"first female Senior Research Fellow\" which I have heard many times but for which I cannot find a cite.  First (non-sr.) female fellow wasn't until the 80s, so it is very conceivable -->\n\n== Research ==\nBent's research centers on English, French and Italian music of the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries and includes work on the medieval [[motet]]. Her study of the [[Old Hall Manuscript]] (both her 1969 dissertation and the edition, co-edited with Andrew Hughes, published in the [[Corpus Mensurabilis Musicae]], 1969\u201373) ), was a key work in scholarship on early English music. Her studies of [[John Dunstaple]], [[Philippe de Vitry]], [[Guillaume de Machaut]], the [[Roman de Fauvel]], ''[[musica ficta]]'' and music and manuscripts in the Veneto, have all been highly influential; she was a pioneer in musical [[paleography]] and source studies. She co-founded and co-directed the Digital Image Archive of Medieval Music<ref>[http://www.diamm.ac.uk/ diamm.ac.uk]</ref> serves on many editorial boards of journals and publication series and contributed articles to the [[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]. Her publications address technical matters of music theory, techniques of counterpoint, analysis, musica ficta, text-setting, and other issues that bridge notation and performance in early music, descriptions of new sources, aspects of musical transmission, stemmatics, and manuscript studies, interfaces with literary, historical and biographical questions.\n\n== Awards and Fellowships ==\nHer awards include the Royal Musical Association's [[E.

She taught at [[Cambridge]] and [[King's College London]] after 1963, and became a lecturer at [[Goldsmiths' College]] in 1972. In 1975 she was appointed professor at [[Brandeis University]] and in 1981 at [[Princeton University]], and served as department chair in both. Bent was president of the [[American Musicological Society]] (1984\u20131986), of which she is now a Corresponding Member. She returned to England in 1992 as Senior Research Fellow at [[All Souls College]], [[Oxford University]], where she is now an Emeritus Fellow.<!--removing \"first female Senior Research Fellow\" which I have heard many times but for which I cannot find a cite.  First (non-sr.) female fellow wasn't until the 80s, so it is very conceivable -->\n\n== Research ==\nBent's research centers on English, French and Italian music of the fourteenth to sixteenth centuries and includes work on the medieval [[motet]]. Her study of the [[Old Hall Manuscript]] (both her 1969 dissertation and the edition, co-edited with Andrew Hughes, published in the [[Corpus Mensurabilis Musicae]], 1969\u201373) ), was a key work in scholarship on early English music. Her studies of [[John Dunstaple]], [[Philippe de Vitry]], [[Guillaume de Machaut]], the [[Roman de Fauvel]], ''[[musica ficta]]'' and music and manuscripts in the Veneto, have all been highly influential; she was a pioneer in musical [[paleography]] and source studies. She co-founded and co-directed the Digital Image Archive of Medieval Music<ref>[http://www.diamm.ac.uk/ diamm.ac.uk]</ref> serves on many editorial boards of journals and publication series and contributed articles to the [[New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]. Her publications address technical matters of music theory, techniques of counterpoint, analysis, musica ficta, text-setting, and other issues that bridge notation and performance in early music, descriptions of new sources, aspects of musical transmission, stemmatics, and manuscript studies, interfaces with literary, historical and biographical questions.\n\n== Awards and Fellowships ==\nHer awards include the Royal Musical Association's [[E. J. Dent|Dent]] Medal, a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Leverhulme Emeritus Fellowship, the [[Frank Llewellyn Harrison]] Medal of the Society for Musicology in Ireland,<ref>[http://www.musicologyireland.com/?q=harrison-medal Frank Llewellyn Harrison Medal of the Society for Musicology], musicologyireland.com; accessed 22 July 2015.</ref> the [[Claude V.

She hates the fact that Tyler feels everything has to go his way and that good things always seem to happen to him, such as in \"[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep1|Stan of the House]]\" when Tyler books the living room as an excuse to have the school cheerleading squad come over. Avery is very straightforward in following the rules and reluctantly goes along with what Tyler does. She is very smart, an overachiever, and knows what she wants. She wants everything to be handled in an orderly fashion, such as posting sign-up sheets for the living room and bathroom. Avery is socially responsible and despises boys like Tyler, though the two do have brother-sister heart-to-heart discussions showing that, at the end of the day, no matter how much Tyler annoys her, they love each other. She did not always love to take risks, but this changes when she steals a large pig in one episode. Avery is a very good problem solver and is the school's class president.\n* {{visible anchor|Tyler James}} ([[Blake Michael]]) is the popular brother of Chloe and step-brother of Avery. He seems to get by using his good looks, adding to Avery's jealousy, often causing the two to fight. Manipulative and occasionally a little vain, good things always seem to happen to him; he can get any pretty girl to go out with him and is extremely charismatic. Tyler is a math genius, found out later in the first season, and although he is very smart, Tyler slacks off in school due to laziness. In the episode \"Stan of the House\", he learns he needs to act more like a brother toward Avery and begins, on some occasions, to show his soft, serious, and mature side. Although he can sometimes be perceived as carefree and too laid back, Tyler will rush to a person's aid when they need help, showing that he cares about other people and is not at all judgmental or a bad person, as seen in \"Stan of the House\" when he comforts Avery after she breaks down crying over losing Stan. He can also be shown to be a little air-headed, but he has a quick wit and, like Avery, he knows what he wants and he will not stop at anything to get it.\n* {{visible anchor|Chloe James}} ([[Francesca Capaldi]]) is the younger sister of Tyler and step-sister of Avery. A running gag in the show is that the family will go somewhere and forget to bring Chloe home, and when they realize their error, they scream her name at the same time. Chloe is known to love candy, though her parents do not allow her to eat much. She secretly hides sweets around the house in places like pillowcases and TV remote battery compartments. She has a very active imagination, making up new names for various body parts and enjoys scaring Tyler while he sleeps.\n* {{anchor|Stan}} The Voice of \"Stan\" ([[Stephen Full]]) is the James-Jennings family's new dog who blogs and talks. He keeps his talking secret from Ellen and Bennett, and the only people who know that Stan can talk are Avery, Tyler, Chloe, Karl, and Grandma James. Stan hates noisy [[Pomeranian (dog)|pomeranians]] and has a deep love of [[poodles]]. It is shown that Avery is his favorite child, which is reinforced by the fact that Stan talks to Avery the most of the three kids. As shown in \"[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#5|World of Woofcraft]]\", he likes the game \"Realm of the Tower\". Although at times he seems almost human, he is still a dog and has many normal dog qualities and is very sensitive about it. While Stan does not like to admit it, he is also part cat and blames the fact that his dog ancestor \"married\" his one cat ancestor because it was the 1970s. Stan has a beloved toy monkey named Robert who is his companion. Grandma James found Robert while cleaning the family room and announced that the toy was so disgustingly filthy, it was going straight to the trash. Stan panicked and shouted Robert's name right in front of her, exposing his secret and making Grandma James faint. Stan is also very sensitive about being called \"just a dog\", which Avery called him in the episode \"[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#33|Stan Runs Away]]\". After a year of secretly writing a blog about his experiences with the family, Avery, Chloe, and Tyler discover Stan's blog in \"[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#46|The Kids Find Out Stan Blogs]]\".\n* {{visible anchor|Bennett James}} ([[Regan Burns]]) is Tyler and Chloe's father and Avery's step-father. He is a child psychologist who often acts immature and childish himself and is the author of several books in which he uses his family as examples, only changing the names. He always tries to think of ways to get his children to come together. He is also shown to be quite conceited. Sometimes his wife thinks he got his psychology degree online as his attempts at practicing psychology do not seem to go well. In \"Stan of the House\", he introduces Stan to the blended family in hopes that the dog will help his children bond.\n* {{visible anchor|Ellen Jennings}} ([[Beth Littleford]]) is Avery's mother and Tyler and Chloe's step-mother. She does not like dogs and makes it known that she does not like Stan; however, by the end of ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep25|Howloween]]'', she and Stan start to get along. It is later revealed that she dislikes Stan due to an incident with a dog she adored who suddenly left her. This is the cause of her reluctance to bond with Stan. She loves making jokes, often followed by her catchphrase, \"Good one, Ellen!\" She has been married to Bennett long enough to adopt some of his habits, including being scatterbrained. This could well account for their constant forgetting about Chloe. In ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep37|Who's Training Who?]]'' Ellen hires a master dog trainer to keep Stan off the couch. Ignoring the trainer by daydreaming, Stan ends up outside until the children convince him that he's one of them, and he gives in and accepts the new dog bed Ellen bought him.\n\n=== Recurring ===\n* Lindsay ([[Kayla Maisonet]]) is Avery's best friend. Lindsay's unique quality is that she always wears a hat, even when it is inappropriate. Lindsay often talks fast when she panics, often leading Avery to also talk fast. Except for her lack of intelligence, she has much in common with Avery. They love the same books and movies and often say the same things at the same time involuntarily, and she also dislikes Karl just like Avery. However, Avery dislikes Karl more than she does. In ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep31|Avery B. Jealous]]'', Wes, Avery's crush, asks Lindsay out on a date. Lindsay promises Avery that she will call off the date, but when they get in a fight, she decides to go out with Wes. Lindsay admits that she has always had a crush on Wes. In ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep35|Avery-body Dance Now]]'', she and Max confront Wes when he turns Avery down on an invite to the school dance after Karl tells Wes he is going with Avery.\n* Nikki Ortiz ([[Denyse Tontz]]) is Avery's friend and Tyler's current girlfriend. She has a dog named Evita, who Stan despises because she yaps too much. Nikki moved from [[El Salvador]] and is sweet and talented. In ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep4|Wingstan]]'', she is shown to be great at whistling and art. In ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep15|Avery's First Crush]]'', Nikki accidentally reveals her confusing and mysterious secret: \"My brother didn't fall. He was pushed.\" In ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep32|Love Ty-Angle]]'', she becomes jealous of Tyler's girlfriend and is confused about it. Nikki asks Tyler to dump Emily for her, but since he can't trust his dream girl, he chooses Emily; however, she learns about Nikki's pursuit of Tyler. This leads to Tyler being broken up with by Emily and, despite never being picked second for anything, Nikki accepts when Tyler chooses her.\n* Karl Fink (LJ Benet) is Avery's frenemy. He and Avery are the smartest children in school; however, in contrast to Avery, Karl is a shameless jerk. Being very nosy, he often barges into the Jennings\u2013James house without knocking. He also tries to find out Stan's secret in ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep8|The Bone Identity]]''. He despises Avery because when they were much younger, she stole his graham crackers at a science camp. He often has tea and snacks with Ellen, much to the discomfort of others, though they both claim that it is not weird. He once admits that he likes to send Ellen flowers under the alias of Walter Perkins. Karl has mentioned several times that his father is up on the [[International Space Station]] and talks often about his obsessive bodybuilding mother, who he says is the strongest woman in the world, though she has never been seen on the show. In ''Avery-body Dance Now'', he teaches Avery how to dance for the school dance with Wes; however, he tells Wes that he is going to the school dance with Avery. In ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep45|Karl Finds Out Stan's Secret]]'', it is revealed that Karl has been spying on Stan and the children for a while. Now he knows that Stan can talk, but keeps it a secret.\n* Max (Danielle Soibelman) is one of Avery and Lindsay's best friends, as shown in the second season. She is shown to be a very negative, but overall nice, person despite sporting dark clothing. She likes to act tough and says she hates everything, but she also dances with Karl at the school dance.\n* Wes ([[Peyton Meyer]]) is Avery's crush in the second season. In ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep30|Lost in Stanslation]]'', Avery acts as his Spanish tutor; at the end, he asks her if it would be inappropriate to ask her out on a date in Spanish, but since she does not actually know the language, she answers yes in Spanish. He is very upset as he had said he wanted to ask her that even before she was his tutor. In ''Avery B. Jealous'', Wes asks Lindsay out after being rejected by Avery, but in the end he says that he is glad that he isn't going with Lindsay as he wanted to go with Avery all along. In ''Avery-body Dance Now'', he asks Avery to go to the school dance with him; however, when Avery seeks dance lessons from Karl, Wes becomes jealous of Karl, and when Karl tells Wes he is going with Avery, Wes goes by himself. After Lindsay and Max witness Wes' anger at Avery and Avery running out of the dance in tears, they learn of Karl's deception. Wes goes to Avery's house, where he tells her he likes her, and they return to the dance together. In ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep36|The Green Eyed Monster]]'', Stan accidentally captures a photo of Wes with another girl in the park, and Avery confronts him, which causes a temporary problem between her and Wes as he tells her he can't date a girl who doesn't trust him, but Tyler and Stan get together to convince Wes it wasn't Avery's fault and that she just has strange relatives. In ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep38|Love, Lose and a Beanbag Toss]]'', Avery notices that Wes is ignoring her; after several confrontations he finally tells her that his family is moving to another city. They both agree on a long distance relationship through the Internet, but soon notice that it is not going to work out well. They then decide to end their relationship and try to move on.\n* Mason (Griffin Kunitz) is Chloe's current boyfriend. According to Chloe in ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep44|Stan Gets Schooled]]'', Chloe and Mason started their relationship because Chloe came up to him, said \"You're my boyfriend!\" and gave him a tongue click. It is shown in ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep61|Stan Has Puppies]]'' that he has twin brother named Jason.\n* Heather Collins (Brighid Fleming) is Princess' owner and the Jennings\u2013James' next-door neighbor who moved in with her family in ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep50|Stan Falls in Love]]''. She is shown to be spoiled, ridiculously snobby, and stuck up. She also seems to have a liking to Karl.\n\n== Production ==\nThe series was co-created by Michael B.

The series stars [[G Hannelius]], [[Blake Michael]], [[Francesca Capaldi]], [[Regan Burns]], and [[Beth Littleford]], and also features the voice of [[Stephen Full]].\n\n== Premise ==\nSet in [[Pasadena, California]], Avery Jennings' mother, Ellen, had just married Tyler and Chloe James' father, Bennett, so now the new family needs to make some adjustments on living together. They face an even bigger adjustment when they discover that their new dog, Stan, can talk. Only Avery, Tyler, and Chloe know this. Unbeknownst to the family, Stan also has a blog where he discusses happenings in the Jennings-James household. The children learn of Stan's talking ability in the first episode and agree to keep it a secret from their parents, fearing if the world finds out that Stan can talk, he will be taken away for experimentation.\n\n== Episodes ==\n{{main|List of Dog with a Blog episodes}}\n{{:List of Dog with a Blog episodes}}\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main ===\n<imagemap>\nFile:Dog_with_a_Blog_Cast.jpg|thumb|right|The main characters, from left to right: Avery, Bennett, Chloe, Ellen, Stan, and Tyler.\n\ncircle 87 57 19 [[#Avery Jennings|Avery]]\ncircle 125 25 22 [[#Bennett James|Bennett]]\ncircle 140 112 20 [[#Chloe James|Chloe]]\ncircle 173 32 25 [[#Ellen Jennings|Ellen]]\nrect 167 84 206 174 [[#Stan|Stan]]\ncircle 226 71 27 [[#Tyler James|Tyler]]\n\ndesc none\n</imagemap>\n\n* {{visible anchor|Avery Jennings}} ([[G Hannelius]]) is the highly intelligent, hard-working step-sister of Tyler and Chloe. She hates the fact that Tyler feels everything has to go his way and that good things always seem to happen to him, such as in \"[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep1|Stan of the House]]\" when Tyler books the living room as an excuse to have the school cheerleading squad come over. Avery is very straightforward in following the rules and reluctantly goes along with what Tyler does. She is very smart, an overachiever, and knows what she wants. She wants everything to be handled in an orderly fashion, such as posting sign-up sheets for the living room and bathroom. Avery is socially responsible and despises boys like Tyler, though the two do have brother-sister heart-to-heart discussions showing that, at the end of the day, no matter how much Tyler annoys her, they love each other. She did not always love to take risks, but this changes when she steals a large pig in one episode. Avery is a very good problem solver and is the school's class president.\n* {{visible anchor|Tyler James}} ([[Blake Michael]]) is the popular brother of Chloe and step-brother of Avery. He seems to get by using his good looks, adding to Avery's jealousy, often causing the two to fight. Manipulative and occasionally a little vain, good things always seem to happen to him; he can get any pretty girl to go out with him and is extremely charismatic. Tyler is a math genius, found out later in the first season, and although he is very smart, Tyler slacks off in school due to laziness. In the episode \"Stan of the House\", he learns he needs to act more like a brother toward Avery and begins, on some occasions, to show his soft, serious, and mature side. Although he can sometimes be perceived as carefree and too laid back, Tyler will rush to a person's aid when they need help, showing that he cares about other people and is not at all judgmental or a bad person, as seen in \"Stan of the House\" when he comforts Avery after she breaks down crying over losing Stan. He can also be shown to be a little air-headed, but he has a quick wit and, like Avery, he knows what he wants and he will not stop at anything to get it.\n* {{visible anchor|Chloe James}} ([[Francesca Capaldi]]) is the younger sister of Tyler and step-sister of Avery. A running gag in the show is that the family will go somewhere and forget to bring Chloe home, and when they realize their error, they scream her name at the same time. Chloe is known to love candy, though her parents do not allow her to eat much. She secretly hides sweets around the house in places like pillowcases and TV remote battery compartments. She has a very active imagination, making up new names for various body parts and enjoys scaring Tyler while he sleeps.\n* {{anchor|Stan}} The Voice of \"Stan\" ([[Stephen Full]]) is the James-Jennings family's new dog who blogs and talks. He keeps his talking secret from Ellen and Bennett, and the only people who know that Stan can talk are Avery, Tyler, Chloe, Karl, and Grandma James. Stan hates noisy [[Pomeranian (dog)|pomeranians]] and has a deep love of [[poodles]]. It is shown that Avery is his favorite child, which is reinforced by the fact that Stan talks to Avery the most of the three kids. As shown in \"[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#5|World of Woofcraft]]\", he likes the game \"Realm of the Tower\". Although at times he seems almost human, he is still a dog and has many normal dog qualities and is very sensitive about it. While Stan does not like to admit it, he is also part cat and blames the fact that his dog ancestor \"married\" his one cat ancestor because it was the 1970s. Stan has a beloved toy monkey named Robert who is his companion. Grandma James found Robert while cleaning the family room and announced that the toy was so disgustingly filthy, it was going straight to the trash. Stan panicked and shouted Robert's name right in front of her, exposing his secret and making Grandma James faint. Stan is also very sensitive about being called \"just a dog\", which Avery called him in the episode \"[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#33|Stan Runs Away]]\". After a year of secretly writing a blog about his experiences with the family, Avery, Chloe, and Tyler discover Stan's blog in \"[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#46|The Kids Find Out Stan Blogs]]\".\n* {{visible anchor|Bennett James}} ([[Regan Burns]]) is Tyler and Chloe's father and Avery's step-father. He is a child psychologist who often acts immature and childish himself and is the author of several books in which he uses his family as examples, only changing the names. He always tries to think of ways to get his children to come together. He is also shown to be quite conceited. Sometimes his wife thinks he got his psychology degree online as his attempts at practicing psychology do not seem to go well. In \"Stan of the House\", he introduces Stan to the blended family in hopes that the dog will help his children bond.\n* {{visible anchor|Ellen Jennings}} ([[Beth Littleford]]) is Avery's mother and Tyler and Chloe's step-mother. She does not like dogs and makes it known that she does not like Stan; however, by the end of ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep25|Howloween]]'', she and Stan start to get along. It is later revealed that she dislikes Stan due to an incident with a dog she adored who suddenly left her. This is the cause of her reluctance to bond with Stan. She loves making jokes, often followed by her catchphrase, \"Good one, Ellen!\" She has been married to Bennett long enough to adopt some of his habits, including being scatterbrained. This could well account for their constant forgetting about Chloe. In ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep37|Who's Training Who?]]'' Ellen hires a master dog trainer to keep Stan off the couch. Ignoring the trainer by daydreaming, Stan ends up outside until the children convince him that he's one of them, and he gives in and accepts the new dog bed Ellen bought him.\n\n=== Recurring ===\n* Lindsay ([[Kayla Maisonet]]) is Avery's best friend. Lindsay's unique quality is that she always wears a hat, even when it is inappropriate. Lindsay often talks fast when she panics, often leading Avery to also talk fast. Except for her lack of intelligence, she has much in common with Avery. They love the same books and movies and often say the same things at the same time involuntarily, and she also dislikes Karl just like Avery. However, Avery dislikes Karl more than she does. In ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep31|Avery B. Jealous]]'', Wes, Avery's crush, asks Lindsay out on a date. Lindsay promises Avery that she will call off the date, but when they get in a fight, she decides to go out with Wes. Lindsay admits that she has always had a crush on Wes. In ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep35|Avery-body Dance Now]]'', she and Max confront Wes when he turns Avery down on an invite to the school dance after Karl tells Wes he is going with Avery.\n* Nikki Ortiz ([[Denyse Tontz]]) is Avery's friend and Tyler's current girlfriend. She has a dog named Evita, who Stan despises because she yaps too much. Nikki moved from [[El Salvador]] and is sweet and talented. In ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep4|Wingstan]]'', she is shown to be great at whistling and art. In ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep15|Avery's First Crush]]'', Nikki accidentally reveals her confusing and mysterious secret: \"My brother didn't fall. He was pushed.\" In ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep32|Love Ty-Angle]]'', she becomes jealous of Tyler's girlfriend and is confused about it. Nikki asks Tyler to dump Emily for her, but since he can't trust his dream girl, he chooses Emily; however, she learns about Nikki's pursuit of Tyler. This leads to Tyler being broken up with by Emily and, despite never being picked second for anything, Nikki accepts when Tyler chooses her.\n* Karl Fink (LJ Benet) is Avery's frenemy. He and Avery are the smartest children in school; however, in contrast to Avery, Karl is a shameless jerk. Being very nosy, he often barges into the Jennings\u2013James house without knocking. He also tries to find out Stan's secret in ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep8|The Bone Identity]]''. He despises Avery because when they were much younger, she stole his graham crackers at a science camp. He often has tea and snacks with Ellen, much to the discomfort of others, though they both claim that it is not weird. He once admits that he likes to send Ellen flowers under the alias of Walter Perkins. Karl has mentioned several times that his father is up on the [[International Space Station]] and talks often about his obsessive bodybuilding mother, who he says is the strongest woman in the world, though she has never been seen on the show. In ''Avery-body Dance Now'', he teaches Avery how to dance for the school dance with Wes; however, he tells Wes that he is going to the school dance with Avery. In ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep45|Karl Finds Out Stan's Secret]]'', it is revealed that Karl has been spying on Stan and the children for a while. Now he knows that Stan can talk, but keeps it a secret.\n* Max (Danielle Soibelman) is one of Avery and Lindsay's best friends, as shown in the second season. She is shown to be a very negative, but overall nice, person despite sporting dark clothing. She likes to act tough and says she hates everything, but she also dances with Karl at the school dance.\n* Wes ([[Peyton Meyer]]) is Avery's crush in the second season. In ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep30|Lost in Stanslation]]'', Avery acts as his Spanish tutor; at the end, he asks her if it would be inappropriate to ask her out on a date in Spanish, but since she does not actually know the language, she answers yes in Spanish. He is very upset as he had said he wanted to ask her that even before she was his tutor. In ''Avery B. Jealous'', Wes asks Lindsay out after being rejected by Avery, but in the end he says that he is glad that he isn't going with Lindsay as he wanted to go with Avery all along. In ''Avery-body Dance Now'', he asks Avery to go to the school dance with him; however, when Avery seeks dance lessons from Karl, Wes becomes jealous of Karl, and when Karl tells Wes he is going with Avery, Wes goes by himself. After Lindsay and Max witness Wes' anger at Avery and Avery running out of the dance in tears, they learn of Karl's deception. Wes goes to Avery's house, where he tells her he likes her, and they return to the dance together. In ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep36|The Green Eyed Monster]]'', Stan accidentally captures a photo of Wes with another girl in the park, and Avery confronts him, which causes a temporary problem between her and Wes as he tells her he can't date a girl who doesn't trust him, but Tyler and Stan get together to convince Wes it wasn't Avery's fault and that she just has strange relatives. In ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep38|Love, Lose and a Beanbag Toss]]'', Avery notices that Wes is ignoring her; after several confrontations he finally tells her that his family is moving to another city. They both agree on a long distance relationship through the Internet, but soon notice that it is not going to work out well. They then decide to end their relationship and try to move on.\n* Mason (Griffin Kunitz) is Chloe's current boyfriend. According to Chloe in ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep44|Stan Gets Schooled]]'', Chloe and Mason started their relationship because Chloe came up to him, said \"You're my boyfriend!\" and gave him a tongue click. It is shown in ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep61|Stan Has Puppies]]'' that he has twin brother named Jason.\n* Heather Collins (Brighid Fleming) is Princess' owner and the Jennings\u2013James' next-door neighbor who moved in with her family in ''[[List of Dog with a Blog episodes#ep50|Stan Falls in Love]]''. She is shown to be spoiled, ridiculously snobby, and stuck up. She also seems to have a liking to Karl.\n\n== Production ==\nThe series was co-created by Michael B.

To this day dela Cruz starring role in ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) is the most successful film export of the [[Philippines]], making him their first international celebrity. Only 83&nbsp;cm (2 feet, 9&nbsp;inches) tall, dela Cruz is the first short person to be listed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the shortest adult in a leading role,  and to get international recognition with a streak of films. Born in abject poverty suffering from [[Primordial dwarfism]] and underdeveloped intellectual capacities, dela Cruz started exercising with everything he could find, and went on to study martial arts at a nearby dojo. In the mid 1970s, dela Cruz was noticed by producers and couple Peter and Cora Caballes. With their production company Liliw Productions, received his billing name Weng Weng and played supporting roles in their films. In 1978, dela Cruz shared the top billing with [[Ramon Zamora]] in ''Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa''. By the late 1970s to the early 1980s, Dela Cruz started to collaborate with [[Dolphy]], a major local comic, and appeared in three of his films. Between all this dela Cruz started playing of the role of Agent OO as the lead in the film ''Agent OO'' (1981). \n\nIt was the sequel of ''Agent OO,'' ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981), that launched him to brief but international stardom. A film festival was organised by first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] in the hope to present Filipino films for the rest of the world. Major entertainment figures were present including [[Priscilla Presley]], [[Franco Nero]], [[Brooke Shields]], [[Jeremy Irons]], among many other. It is written that dela Cruz stole the spotlight from all the regular action stars, and Art House film directors, who are usually front and center in these kind of events. Dela Cruz hyped as a new superstar, was the talk of the town and ''For Your Height Only'' outsold every other films on foreign sales. The film was a success worldwide, establishing dela Cruz under the pseudonym Weng Weng as the first small person with leading roles in films to reach a peak of success. Finally, dela Cruz is still the only small person who made a name for himself in the action genre performing all of his stunts.\n\nFollowing his success dela Cruz appeared in three more film ''D'Wild Wild Weng'' (1982), ''[[The Impossible Kid (film)|The Impossible Kid]]''  (1982), his final performance as Agent OO, and ''The Cute... The Sexy n' The Tiny'' alongside [[Berting Labra]] and [[Pia Moran]]. The first two were distributed internationally without the same success as ''For Your Height Only'', and shortly after the Caballes had a professional change of heart. Dela Cruz never worked again in the media industry and spent the rest of his living in poverty in with his family in [[Baclaran, Para\u00f1aque|Baclaran]]. During his last two year dela Cruz was paralyzed and bed stricken because of a stroke and passed away at the age of 34 in 1992.\n\nDela Cruz became a cult film icon with the passing of time, and with the arrival of the internet dela Cruz became an online sensation, with people from all over the world looking at the mark he left behind. At that time a lot of information published about dela Cruz was hyperbolic mythos, while mostly false some of it was true. Research about his life led to the making of two successful widely release documentaries [[Mark Hartley]]'s ''[[Machete Maidens Unleashed!]]'' (2010), and Andrew Leavold's ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' (2013).\n\n== Early life ==\nDela Cruz was born to Felicito Jose dela Cruz an electrician (1914-1968) and Rita DeGuzman dela Cruz a laundry women (1919-1989), the youngest of five brothers, on the seventh of September 1957. As described by dela Cruz's brother Celing, dela Cruz's early life went as followed. When his mother was pregnant she didn't know until the doctor told her so, and when gave birth, his size was \u201cno bigger than a small coke bottle\u201d. This forced dela Cruz\u2019s parents to place him in a shoe box under a light feeding him with drops. With a medical condition known as [[primordial dwarfism]], it caused dela Cruz to grow to a height of 2 feet and 9 inches (0.83 meter) tall. Being devoted Catholics, dela Cruz's mother showed their devotion to their faith by dressing and parading a young dela Cruz as [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa|Santo Ni\u00f1o]] each year for the annual Baclaran parade. Dela Cruz became popular in the neighborhood and his mother Rita felt he should become an actor. By 1968, dela Cruz's father passed away due to falling down a ladder at work<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/145619/weng-weng-lives/|title=Weng Weng Lives!|date=2014-01-04|website=Inquirer Lifestyle|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/arts-and-entertainment/weng-weng-a1707-20170425-lfrm|title=The Larger-Than-Life Story of Weng Weng|work=Esquiremag.ph|access-date=2018-08-25}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite AV media |last= Leavold|first= Andrew|date= |title= ''The Search for Weng Weng''| |language= English|type=DVD |location= USA|publisher= Wild Eye Releasing|id= 760137943594}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Celing, as a child dela Cruz was fascinated with action films and started to study them. Neighbours of the dela Cruz started to notice him climbing on clothing lines doing acrobacies and pull ups. Dela Cruz joined [[Karate]] classes, where he learnt quickly, and impressed his instructor. So much so that the instructor would have demonstrations with dela Cruz to promote the school. During one of these demonstration dela Cruz was noticed by producer and actor Peter Caballes of Liliw Productions. Dela Cruz's mother who had a hard time raising five boys, accepted that Peter his wife Cora Ridon Caballes would take dela Cruz under their helm for a film career.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== 1975 to 1981: Early roles and breakthrough ===\nDela Cruz started to work almost exclusively with Liliw Productions, starting with an uncredited role, ''Silakbo'', released October 17, 1975.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=229}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, dela Cruz billed as Weng Weng, which would be his pseudonym for the rest of his career, acted in ''Silang Matatapang'' and ''Sila...Sa Bawat Bangketa.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=229}}</ref>''\n\nIn 1978, dela Cruz shared the top billing with actor [[Ramon Zamora]] in ''Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=230-231}}</ref>\n\nAccording to local comic star Rodolfo Vera Quizon Sr. better known as [[Dolphy]], he was introduced to Dela Cruz through his friend Peter Caballes, who found him hilarious.

As well as taking care of dela Cruz's training for the rest of his career, Nicart also expanded his training in karate and acting.

They said that they adopted dela Cruz ten years prior to the release of ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) to help him. Contemporary action film star [[Rez Cortez]], Franco Guerrero, and Nelson Anderson, who are critical of the couple, have asserted that with the Caballes dela Cruz was provided shelter, received a per diem that was higher than most salaries considering where dela Cruz from and travelled the world. Countries visited by dela Cruz includes [[France]], and [[United States]]. Film editor Edgardo \"Boy\" Vinarao, said that from his point of view dela Cruz was treated like a little prince.<ref name=\":0\" /> Aside from Vinarao's account, those of Cortez, Guerrero, Anderson, as well as [[Roland Dantes]], Busty Santos, and director Eddie Nicard found the financial treatment of dela Cruz's by the Caballes appalling. According to the filmmakers of the documentary ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]],'' by the time they tracked down the couple down to be interviewed that Peter had passed away in 2007, while Cora said they would have to travel [[California]] to conduct one.

Celing added that dela Cruz was abandoned by the Caballes when they had a career change, became completely absent when dela Cruz became paralyzed after his first stroke and the only thing that was provided beyond this point was dela Cruz's casket paid by Peter, while Cora paid for the service once visited by another of their brother, and that [[Lotis Key]] was the only celebrity to attend.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=201-202|chapter=The death of the Pinoy action king}}</ref>\n\nOn dela Cruz's work conditions, Celing said he was never fully paid what he was owed as according to him the Caballes promised their mother that they buy them a house. Nicart went on to say that the Caballes treated dela Cruz like a dog, would ask him to leave the room in any business meeting, and that gave him the equivalent of $ 500 per film, while they were wealthy owning several mansions. On that matter Anderson felt that dela Cruz was treated like puppet by everyone and the Caballes too possessive. Cortez said, while working on the first film where dela Cruz received the top billing and considering the fact that the dela Cruz's producers took care of his basic needs, Cortez suspected that at the time he wasn't well compensated. Cortez said he saw dela Cruz arrive on set not in his private car but utility vehicle, he went on to say that it is unacceptable to do so with a leading man. While feeling dela Cruz deserved a better compensation, Cortez concluded that he was probably happy, considering where he came from and to get a great deal of life experiences.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOn dela Cruz's work ethic, director Nicart, who was a former actor and stuntman for a company named SOS Daredevils, had doubt due to dela Cruz's limitations and went on to say that dela Cruz didn't know how to read a script. Prior the shoot of their first film ''Agent OO'' (1981) for the rest of his career dela Cruz received his training by Nicart who trained his the same way he was. Nicart also worked to polish dela Cruz's acting, advanced Karate lessons for fight choreography, as well as stunts. Nicart said and praised his footwork, and his fearlessness when it came to stunts. Nicart, also said that he originally had doubt on dela Cruz leading a film, but found him to be so collaborative and fearless, having never refused any stunt, that soon enough he sensed that dela Cruz would become famous. On dela Cruz's talent, [[Dolphy]] praised his comic timing and martial arts skills, while Guerrero thinks highly of his acting abilities.\n\nCeling and Nicart said while dela Cruz had a good grasp of what was going around him, but was mentally slow. Guerrero described that dela Cruz had the mind of a ten-year-old and said that dela Cruz believed anything he said, whether it was real or imaginary. Rez Cortez who acted in two film with dela Cruz said that he had trouble getting in touch with his emotions in order to express them. Cortez recalls once asking dela Cruz if he was lonely for which he replied yes I cried. Cortez and Roland Dantes also asserted that dela Cruz had his own sense of reality. Catral said she never noticed dela Cruz's childlike personality. She felt he had a good grip of what was going on and she had adult conversations with dela Cruz. She said he had an odd sense of humor, and maybe that was what others felt.<ref name=\":5\" />  Anderson described him as complex adult, with an unexplored side.\n\nDela Cruz's has several friendships throughout his career. Guerrero describes that the first time he met dela Cruz children were around and did not know what to make him, and when he spoke the little girls got scared. From that point on they became friends. When they shared company, dela Cruz would always make him laugh. A fond memory he holds, is that dela Cruz often taunted him to go sparring, where he would pretend to be way too scared to go along.<ref name=\":0\" /> Anderson's account of the of his friendship with dela Cruz was at time when both were under contract with Liliw Production. Which he describes as being polluted by the possessive attitude of producers Peter and Cora Caballes. When he started socializing with dela Cruz, he noticed the his potential and felt he was put down by others. Anderson found dela Cruz brave, while wanting to be prudent with him de la Cruz was upset at the idea of wearing a belt and helmet while riding with him on his motorcycle. According to him, a man once provoked dela Cruz by tapping his hand on his head and dela Cruz was ready to fight and wasn't afraid of his size, and Anderson had to separate them. He also recalls bringing dela Cruz at an [[Art film|Art house]] cinema named Mabini to introduce him to [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist]] films. Dela Cruz was enthralled by them. Together they watched [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s ''[[Los Olvidados]]'' (1950), [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Strada]]'' (1954), and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959). Dela Cruz was particularly fond of [[Vittorio De Sica]]'s ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'' (1948), according to Anderson, on his first viewing dela Cruz cried. They agreed to make an action comedy remake with a human touch. As soon as Anderson started voicing his concerns regarding both dangerous working conditions and mispayments to the Caballes, the Caballes separated them. They would tell him that dela Cruz was absent when he wasn't. Anderson parted ways with the company, never to see him again.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australia|pages=180-181}}</ref> Catral stated she had some affection for dela Cruz, would prefer to hang with him instead of other crew member, and when she stopped acting to go to law school she made sure to say goodbye to only two actors, dela Cruz and [[Dolphy]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nDela Cruz became friends with president [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand Marco]] and his [[Marcos family|family]], and on several occasions he joined their company. President Marcos gave dela Cruz several honors during his career. According to director Dante Pangilinan it was due to Cora Caballes being the niece of General Prospero Olivas. They brought him to the Marcos palace where according to Marcos' daughter [[Imee Marcos|Imee]] the whole family fell in love with him because of dela Cruz's personal sense of humor was infectious. She went on to say that it was with her brother [[Bongbong Marcos|Bongbong]] with whom dela Cruz was the closest. Former first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] said the following about dela Cruz: The appearance of Weng Weng showed the great Filipino spirit. They can make a hero of a disabled, distorted guy. So everybody had a chance. They have such a democratic attitude. The Filipino have no prejudice. He entertained us. He was distorted but he could make us laugh and make us happy.

To this day dela Cruz starring role in ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981) is the most successful film export of the [[Philippines]], making him their first international celebrity. Only 83&nbsp;cm (2 feet, 9&nbsp;inches) tall, dela Cruz is the first short person to be listed in the [[Guinness World Records]] as the shortest adult in a leading role,  and to get international recognition with a streak of films. Born in abject poverty suffering from [[Primordial dwarfism]] and underdeveloped intellectual capacities, dela Cruz started exercising with everything he could find, and went on to study martial arts at a nearby dojo. In the mid 1970s, dela Cruz was noticed by producers and couple Peter and Cora Caballes. With their production company Liliw Productions, received his billing name Weng Weng and played supporting roles in their films. In 1978, dela Cruz shared the top billing with [[Ramon Zamora]] in ''Chopsuey Meets Big Time Papa''. By the late 1970s to the early 1980s, Dela Cruz started to collaborate with [[Dolphy]], a major local comic, and appeared in three of his films. Between all this dela Cruz started playing of the role of Agent OO as the lead in the film ''Agent OO'' (1981). \n\nIt was the sequel of ''Agent OO,'' ''[[For Your Height Only]]'' (1981), that launched him to brief but international stardom. A film festival was organised by first lady [[Imelda Marcos]] in the hope to present Filipino films for the rest of the world. Major entertainment figures were present including [[Priscilla Presley]], [[Franco Nero]], [[Brooke Shields]], [[Jeremy Irons]], among many other. It is written that dela Cruz stole the spotlight from all the regular action stars, and Art House film directors, who are usually front and center in these kind of events. Dela Cruz hyped as a new superstar, was the talk of the town and ''For Your Height Only'' outsold every other films on foreign sales. The film was a success worldwide, establishing dela Cruz under the pseudonym Weng Weng as the first small person with leading roles in films to reach a peak of success. Finally, dela Cruz is still the only small person who made a name for himself in the action genre performing all of his stunts.\n\nFollowing his success dela Cruz appeared in three more film ''D'Wild Wild Weng'' (1982), ''[[The Impossible Kid (film)|The Impossible Kid]]''  (1982), his final performance as Agent OO, and ''The Cute... The Sexy n' The Tiny'' alongside [[Berting Labra]] and [[Pia Moran]]. The first two were distributed internationally without the same success as ''For Your Height Only'', and shortly after the Caballes had a professional change of heart. Dela Cruz never worked again in the media industry and spent the rest of his living in poverty in with his family in [[Baclaran, Para\u00f1aque|Baclaran]].

Cortez recalls once asking dela Cruz if he was lonely for which he replied yes I cried. Cortez and Roland Dantes also asserted that dela Cruz had his own sense of reality.

He also recalls bringing dela Cruz at an [[Art film|Art house]] cinema named Mabini to introduce him to [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist]] films. Dela Cruz was enthralled by them. Together they watched [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s ''[[Los Olvidados]]'' (1950), [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Strada]]'' (1954), and [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]]'s ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (1959).

The basis of the first film was the 2007 rough cut of Andrew Leavolds's ''[[The Search for Weng Weng]]'' released in 2013, about discovering dela Cruz's life.\n\nDela Cruz's real voice as rarely been heard outside of Philippines, since the original dubs of his films have never been available outside of his home country.\n\nDela Cruz is the first Filipino actor to have a documentary and a book written about him published in western countries.\n\nAcademic Dr. [[Tilman Baumg\u00e4rtel]] expressed discomfort watching Weng Weng films saying they are pre-modern, reminding him of the Medieval times where royalties would have a handicap, a dwarf act as a jester, and would be already funny based on that.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDela Cruz's image is very controversial within Philippines' local film industry, with some auteur cineaste an academic feeling that it is an uncomfortable image of the country, especially at a time where they had no international figures. However directors [[Bobby A. Suarez]] and [[Tikoy Aguiluz]] felt that dela Cruz's success was glorious and couldn't be happier since according them it left the right people upset. Aguiluz went on to say he is our middle finger to [[Hollywood]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn is home town of [[Baclaran, Para\u00f1aque]], dela Cruz success bring the people a lot of pride but also a lot sadness due to his poor treatment. <ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|title=The Search for Weng Weng|publisher=The LedaTape Organisation|year=2017|isbn=9780994411235|location=Australi|pages=42|chapter=The patron saint of Balaclaran}}</ref>\n\n== Martial arts, stunt work, and fitness ==\nDela Cruz started training on his own at a young age, doing push ups, pull ups (sometime on people's arm), and climbing on clothing lines to do acrobacies.

When dela Cruz trained with him with the stuntmen's organisation SOS Daredevils, like everyone else he had to start back in Karate from white belt and gradually go to black, while teaching dela Cruz how to jump and perform stunts from tall heights. Nicart said that dela Cruz was cooperative and while being mentally slow he learnt quick because of this. He concluded that dela Cruz became a real black belt in [[Karate]] with them and a first rate stuntmen who performed all of his own stunts fearlessly.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Mythos, mythicism, and religion. ==\nWhile dela Cruz's life was barely documented many rumors surrounded him while some was true others were debunked.\n\nDela Cruz was falsely rumored to have been a comedian, a [[dentistry]] student, [[customs officer]], to have live bestselling bootleg recording of him singing [[Frank Sinatra]]'s \"My Way\" with former first lady [[Imelda Marcos]], and real life secret agent.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nDela Cruz was official made an official secret agent by President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].

Since a young age people living in [[Baclaran, Para\u00f1aque]] would request dela Cruz to dress up as [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa]] for their yearly parade, some believing he was a resurrection of the saint. It said that dela Cruz was a healer and neighbors would visit him when sick or wounded and ask to him pray for their recovery. Both his common collaborator actor [[Dolphy]], and director Dante Pangilinan said that casting dela Cruz would bring luck to a film project. Pangilinan, whose early films have dela Cruz in the cast, said that he believes that it was dela Cruz's touch of good fortune that allowed him to have a bigger break as a director, gave him luck, and personal growth.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}<br />\n\n== Work cited ==\n\n*{{Cite AV media|url=|title=Machete Maidens Unleashed!|date=|last=Hartley|first=Mark|type=DVD|language=English|publisher=Umbrella Entertainment}}\n*{{Cite AV media|url=|title=The Search for Weng Weng|date=|last=Leavold|first=Andrew|type=DVD|language=English|publisher=Wild Eye Releasing|trans-title=|doi=}}\n* Leavold, Andrew.

A sequence of such edges may be called a [[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]].\n\nA [[bioinformatics workflow management system]] is a specialized scientific workflow system focused on [[bioinformatics]].\n\n==Scientific workflows==\nThe simplest computerized scientific workflows are scripts that call in data, programs, and other inputs and produce outputs that might include visualizations and analytical results.  These may be implemented in programs such as [[R (programming language)|R]] or [[MATLAB]], using a scripting language such as [[Python (programming language)|Python]] or [[Perl]] with a [[command-line interface]], or more recently using open-source web applications such as [[Jupyter Notebook]].\n\nThere are many motives for differentiating scientific workflows from traditional business process workflows. These include:\n* providing an easy-to-use environment for individual application scientists themselves to create their own workflows.\n* providing interactive tools for the scientists enabling them to execute their workflows and view their results in real-time.\n* simplifying the process of sharing and reusing workflows between the scientists. \n* enabling scientists to track the [[provenance]] of the workflow execution results and the workflow creation steps.\n\nBy focusing on the scientists, the focus of designing scientific workflow system shifts away from the workflow [[scheduling]] activities, typically considered by [[grid computing]] environments for optimizing the execution of complex computations on predefined resources, to a domain-specific view of what data types, tools and distributed resources should be made available to the scientists and how can one make them easily accessible and with specific Quality of Service requirements  <ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.future.2007.07.009 | volume=24 | issue=6 | title=An innovative workflow mapping mechanism for Grids in the frame of Quality of Service | journal=Future Generation Computer Systems | pages=498\u2013511| year=2008 | last1=Kyriazis | first1=Dimosthenis | last2=Tserpes | first2=Konstantinos | last3=Menychtas | first3=Andreas | last4=Litke | first4=Antonis | last5=Varvarigou | first5=Theodora }}</ref>\n\nScientific workflows are now recognized{{by whom|date=January 2014}} as a crucial element of the [[cyberinfrastructure]], facilitating e-Science.

Powerful workflow systems make it easy for non-programmers to first sketch out workflow steps using simple flowcharting tools, and then hook in various data acquisition, analysis, and reporting tools.

An example of a theoretical formal analysis framework for the verification and profiling of the control-flow aspects of scientific workflows and their data flow aspects for the [[Discovery Net]] system is described in the paper, \"The design and implementation of a workflow analysis tool\" by Curcin et al.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Curcin | first1 = V. | last2 = Ghanem | first2 = M. | last3 = Guo | first3 = Y. | doi = 10.1098/rsta.2010.0157 | title = The design and implementation of a workflow analysis tool | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences | volume = 368 | issue = 1926 | pages = 4193\u20134208 | year = 2010 | pmid =  20679131| pmc = |bibcode = 2010RSPTA.368.4193C | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nThe authors note that introducing program analysis and verification into the [[workflow]] world requires detailed understanding of execution semantics of workflow language, including execution properties of nodes and arcs in the workflow graph, understanding functional equivalencies between workflow patterns,  and many other issues.
