These tremors instead seem to be a temporary worsening of a small tremor that is present in every human being. These tremors generally go away with time.<ref name=Health />\n\nMore persistent intention tremors are often caused by damage to certain regions of the brain. The most common cause of intention tremors is damage and/or degeneration in the [[cerebellum]]. The cerebellum is a part of the brain responsible for motor coordination, posture and balance. It is responsible for fine motor movements. When the cerebellum is damaged, a person may have difficulty executing a fine motor movement, such as attempting to touch one's nose with one's finger. One common way for the cerebellum to become damaged is through the development of cerebellar [[lesion]]s.<ref name=\"Neuro Book\">[http://www.sinauer.com/neuroscience4e/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503025940/http://www.sinauer.com/neuroscience4e/ |date=2011-05-03 }} Purves, Dale et al. ''Neuroscience''. Fourth Edition. 2008. Sinauer Associates, Inc.</ref> The most common site for cerebellar lesions that lead to intention tremors has been reported to be the [[superior cerebellar peduncle]], through which all fibers carrying information to the midbrain pass, and the [[dentate nucleus]], which is also responsible for linking the cerebellum to the rest of the brain.<ref name=review /> Alcohol abuse is one typical cause of this damage to the cerebellum. The alcohol abuse causes degeneration of the anterior [[cerebellar vermis|vermis]] of the cerebellum. This leads to an inability to process fine motor movements in the individual and the development of intention tremors. In Multiple Sclerosis, damage occurs due to [[demyelinating disease|demyelination]] and [[neuron]] death, which again produces cerebellar lesions and an inability for those neurons to transmit signals.<ref name=\"Neuro Book\" /> Because of this tight association with damage to the cerebellum, intention tremors are often referred to as cerebellar tremors.<ref name=seeberger />\n\nIntention tremors can also be caused as a result of damage to the [[brainstem]] or [[thalamus]]. Both of these structures are involved in the transmission of information between the cerebellum and the [[cerebral cortex]], as well as between the cerebellum and the [[spinal cord]], and then on to the [[motor neurons]]. When these become damaged, the relay system between the cerebellum and the [[muscle]] which it is trying to act upon is compromised, resulting in the development of a tremor.<ref name=\"Neuro Book\" />\n\n==Diagnosis==\nA working diagnosis is made from a [[neurological examination]] and evaluation.  Parts of a complete examination include a physical examination, [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], patient history, and [[electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] and [[accelerometer|accelerometric]] studies. A diagnosis of solely intention tremor can only be made if the tremor is of low frequency (below 5&nbsp;Hz) and without the presence of any resting tremors.<ref name=seeberger/> Electrophysiological studies can be useful in determining frequency of the tremor, and accelerometric studies quantify tremor amplitude. MRI is used to locate damage to and degradation of the cerebellum that may be causing the intention tremor. Focal lesions such as [[neoplasm]]s, [[tumor]]s, [[bleeding|hemorrhages]], [[demyelinating disease|demyelination]], or other damage may be causing dysfunction of the cerebellum and correspondingly the intention tremor.<ref name=chou>{{cite journal |last=Chou |first1=Kelvin L. |title=Diagnosis and management of the individual with tremor |pmid=15250610 |year=2004 |pages=135\u20138 |issue=5 |volume=87 |journal=Medicine and Health, Rhode Island |url=http://med.brown.edu/neurology/articles/kc13504.pdf}}</ref>\n\nPhysical tests are an easy way to determine the severity of the intention tremor and impairment of physical activity.  Common tests that are used to assess intention tremor are the finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin tests. In a finger-to-nose test, a physician has the individual touch their nose with their finger while monitoring for irregularity in timing and control of the movement. An individual with intention tremors will have coarse side-to-side movements that increase in severity as the finger approaches the nose. Similarly, the heel-to-shin test evaluates intention tremors of the lower extremities. In such a test, the individual, in a supine position, places one heel on top of the opposite knee and is then instructed to slide the heel down the shin to the ankle while being monitored for coarse and irregular side-to-side movement as the heel approaches the ankle.\nImportant historical elements to the diagnosis of intention tremor are:\n# age at onset\n# mode of onset (sudden or gradual)\n# anatomical affected sites\n# rate of progression\n# exacerbating and remitting factors\n# alcohol abuse\n# family history of tremor<ref>{{cite book |author=Walker, H.

This situation is addressed with a different treatment. First, individuals will be asked if they use any of the drugs known to cause tremors. If so, they are asked to stop taking the medication and then evaluated after some time to determine if the medication was related to the onset of the tremor. If the tremor persists, treatment that follows may include drug therapy, lifestyle changes, and more invasive forms of treatment, such as surgery and thalamic [[deep brain stimulation]].<ref name=chou />\n\nIntention tremors are known to be very difficult to treat with [[pharmacotherapy]] and [[drug]]s. Although there is no established pharmacological treatment for an intention tremor, several drugs have been found to have positive effects on intention tremors and are used as treatment by many health professionals. [[Isoniazid]], [[buspirone hydrochloride]], [[glutethimide]], [[carbamazepine]], [[clonazepam]], [[topiramate]], [[zofran]], [[propranolol]] and [[primidone]] have all seen moderate results in treating intention tremor and can be prescribed treatments. [[Isoniazid]] inhibits \u03b3-aminobutyric [[acid]]-[[aminotransferase]], which the first step in enzymatic breakdown of [[GABA]], thus increasing GABA, the major inhibitory [[neurotransmitter]] in the central nervous system. This causes a reduction in cerebellar [[ataxia]]s. Another neurotransmitter targeted by drugs that has been found to alleviate intention tremors is [[serotonin]]. The agonist [[buspirone hydrochloride]], which decreases serotonin's function in the central nervous system, has been viewed as an effective treatment of intention tremors.<ref name=seeberger />\n\n[[Physical therapy]] has had great results in reducing tremors but usually does not cure them. Relaxation techniques, such as [[meditation]], [[yoga]], [[hypnosis]], and [[biofeedback]], have seen some results with tremors. Wearing wrist weights which weigh down one's hands as they make movements, masking much of the tremor, is a proven home remedy. This is not a treatment, since wearing the weights does not have any lasting effects when they are not on. However, they do help the individual cope with the tremor immediately.<ref name=\"Tremor Review\" />\n\nA more radical treatment that is used in individuals who do not respond to drug therapy, physical therapy, or any other treatment listed above, with moderate to severe intention tremors, is surgical intervention. [[Deep brain stimulation]] and surgical lesioning of the [[thalamic nuclei]] has been found to be an effective long-term treatment with intention tremors.\n\nDeep brain stimulation treats intention tremors but does not help related diseases or disorders such as dyssynergia and [[dysmetria]].<ref name=\"chronic DBS in MS\">{{cite journal |last1=Wishart |first1=H A |title=Chronic deep brain stimulation for the treatment of tremor in multiple sclerosis: review and case reports |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry |volume=74 |issue=10 |pages=1392\u20137 |year=2003 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.74.10.1392|pmid=14570832 |pmc=1757382 }}</ref> Deep brain stimulation involves the implantation of a device called a [[neurostimulator]], sometimes called a 'brain pacemaker'. It sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain, changing brain activity in a controlled manner. In the case of an intention tremor, the thalamic nuclei is the region targeted for treatment. This form of treatment causes reversible changes and does not cause any permanent lesions. Since it is reversible, deep brain stimulation is considered fairly safe: Reduction in tremor amplitude is almost guaranteed and sometimes resolved. Some individuals with multiple sclerosis have seen sustained benefits in MS progress.<ref name=\"thalamic DBS in MS\">{{cite journal |title=Thalamic deep brain stimulation for tremor among multiple sclerosis patients |journal=Neurologia I Neurochirurgia Polska |volume= 44|issue=6 |pmid=21225515 |vauthors=Mandat T, Koziara H, Tutaj M, Rola R, Bonicki W, Nauman P|pages=542\u20135 |doi=10.1016/s0028-3843(14)60150-x|year=2010 |url=https://journals.viamedica.pl/neurologia_neurochirurgia_polska/article/view/60655 }}</ref>\n\n[[Thalamotomy]] is another surgical treatment where lesions of the thalamus nucleus are created to disrupt the tremor circuit. Thalamotomy has been used to treat many forms of tremors, including those that arise from trauma, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and those whose cause it unknown. This is a very invasive, high-risk treatment with many negative effects, such as multiple sclerosis worsening, cognitive dysfunction, worsening of [[dysarthria]], and [[dysphagia]].

These tremors instead seem to be a temporary worsening of a small tremor that is present in every human being. These tremors generally go away with time.<ref name=Health />\n\nMore persistent intention tremors are often caused by damage to certain regions of the brain. The most common cause of intention tremors is damage and/or degeneration in the [[cerebellum]]. The cerebellum is a part of the brain responsible for motor coordination, posture and balance. It is responsible for fine motor movements. When the cerebellum is damaged, a person may have difficulty executing a fine motor movement, such as attempting to touch one's nose with one's finger. One common way for the cerebellum to become damaged is through the development of cerebellar [[lesion]]s.<ref name=\"Neuro Book\">[http://www.sinauer.com/neuroscience4e/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503025940/http://www.sinauer.com/neuroscience4e/ |date=2011-05-03 }} Purves, Dale et al. ''Neuroscience''. Fourth Edition. 2008. Sinauer Associates, Inc.</ref> The most common site for cerebellar lesions that lead to intention tremors has been reported to be the [[superior cerebellar peduncle]], through which all fibers carrying information to the midbrain pass, and the [[dentate nucleus]], which is also responsible for linking the cerebellum to the rest of the brain.<ref name=review /> Alcohol abuse is one typical cause of this damage to the cerebellum. The alcohol abuse causes degeneration of the anterior [[cerebellar vermis|vermis]] of the cerebellum. This leads to an inability to process fine motor movements in the individual and the development of intention tremors. In Multiple Sclerosis, damage occurs due to [[demyelinating disease|demyelination]] and [[neuron]] death, which again produces cerebellar lesions and an inability for those neurons to transmit signals.<ref name=\"Neuro Book\" /> Because of this tight association with damage to the cerebellum, intention tremors are often referred to as cerebellar tremors.<ref name=seeberger />\n\nIntention tremors can also be caused as a result of damage to the [[brainstem]] or [[thalamus]]. Both of these structures are involved in the transmission of information between the cerebellum and the [[cerebral cortex]], as well as between the cerebellum and the [[spinal cord]], and then on to the [[motor neurons]]. When these become damaged, the relay system between the cerebellum and the [[muscle]] which it is trying to act upon is compromised, resulting in the development of a tremor.<ref name=\"Neuro Book\" />\n\n==Diagnosis==\nA working diagnosis is made from a [[neurological examination]] and evaluation.  Parts of a complete examination include a physical examination, [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]], patient history, and [[electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] and [[accelerometer|accelerometric]] studies. A diagnosis of solely intention tremor can only be made if the tremor is of low frequency (below 5&nbsp;Hz) and without the presence of any resting tremors.<ref name=seeberger/> Electrophysiological studies can be useful in determining frequency of the tremor, and accelerometric studies quantify tremor amplitude. MRI is used to locate damage to and degradation of the cerebellum that may be causing the intention tremor. Focal lesions such as [[neoplasm]]s, [[tumor]]s, [[bleeding|hemorrhages]], [[demyelinating disease|demyelination]], or other damage may be causing dysfunction of the cerebellum and correspondingly the intention tremor.<ref name=chou>{{cite journal |last=Chou |first1=Kelvin L. |title=Diagnosis and management of the individual with tremor |pmid=15250610 |year=2004 |pages=135\u20138 |issue=5 |volume=87 |journal=Medicine and Health, Rhode Island |url=http://med.brown.edu/neurology/articles/kc13504.pdf}}</ref>\n\nPhysical tests are an easy way to determine the severity of the intention tremor and impairment of physical activity.  Common tests that are used to assess intention tremor are the finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin tests. In a finger-to-nose test, a physician has the individual touch their nose with their finger while monitoring for irregularity in timing and control of the movement. An individual with intention tremors will have coarse side-to-side movements that increase in severity as the finger approaches the nose. Similarly, the heel-to-shin test evaluates intention tremors of the lower extremities. In such a test, the individual, in a supine position, places one heel on top of the opposite knee and is then instructed to slide the heel down the shin to the ankle while being monitored for coarse and irregular side-to-side movement as the heel approaches the ankle.\nImportant historical elements to the diagnosis of intention tremor are:\n# age at onset\n# mode of onset (sudden or gradual)\n# anatomical affected sites\n# rate of progression\n# exacerbating and remitting factors\n# alcohol abuse\n# family history of tremor<ref>{{cite book |author=Walker, H.

This situation is addressed with a different treatment. First, individuals will be asked if they use any of the drugs known to cause tremors. If so, they are asked to stop taking the medication and then evaluated after some time to determine if the medication was related to the onset of the tremor. If the tremor persists, treatment that follows may include drug therapy, lifestyle changes, and more invasive forms of treatment, such as surgery and thalamic [[deep brain stimulation]].<ref name=chou />\n\nIntention tremors are known to be very difficult to treat with [[pharmacotherapy]] and [[drug]]s. Although there is no established pharmacological treatment for an intention tremor, several drugs have been found to have positive effects on intention tremors and are used as treatment by many health professionals. [[Isoniazid]], [[buspirone hydrochloride]], [[glutethimide]], [[carbamazepine]], [[clonazepam]], [[topiramate]], [[zofran]], [[propranolol]] and [[primidone]] have all seen moderate results in treating intention tremor and can be prescribed treatments. [[Isoniazid]] inhibits \u03b3-aminobutyric [[acid]]-[[aminotransferase]], which the first step in enzymatic breakdown of [[GABA]], thus increasing GABA, the major inhibitory [[neurotransmitter]] in the central nervous system. This causes a reduction in cerebellar [[ataxia]]s. Another neurotransmitter targeted by drugs that has been found to alleviate intention tremors is [[serotonin]]. The agonist [[buspirone hydrochloride]], which decreases serotonin's function in the central nervous system, has been viewed as an effective treatment of intention tremors.<ref name=seeberger />\n\n[[Physical therapy]] has had great results in reducing tremors but usually does not cure them. Relaxation techniques, such as [[meditation]], [[yoga]], [[hypnosis]], and [[biofeedback]], have seen some results with tremors. Wearing wrist weights which weigh down one's hands as they make movements, masking much of the tremor, is a proven home remedy. This is not a treatment, since wearing the weights does not have any lasting effects when they are not on. However, they do help the individual cope with the tremor immediately.<ref name=\"Tremor Review\" />\n\nA more radical treatment that is used in individuals who do not respond to drug therapy, physical therapy, or any other treatment listed above, with moderate to severe intention tremors, is surgical intervention. [[Deep brain stimulation]] and surgical lesioning of the [[thalamic nuclei]] has been found to be an effective long-term treatment with intention tremors.\n\nDeep brain stimulation treats intention tremors but does not help related diseases or disorders such as dyssynergia and [[dysmetria]].<ref name=\"chronic DBS in MS\">{{cite journal |last1=Wishart |first1=H A |title=Chronic deep brain stimulation for the treatment of tremor in multiple sclerosis: review and case reports |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry |volume=74 |issue=10 |pages=1392\u20137 |year=2003 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.74.10.1392|pmid=14570832 |pmc=1757382 }}</ref> Deep brain stimulation involves the implantation of a device called a [[neurostimulator]], sometimes called a 'brain pacemaker'. It sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain, changing brain activity in a controlled manner. In the case of an intention tremor, the thalamic nuclei is the region targeted for treatment. This form of treatment causes reversible changes and does not cause any permanent lesions. Since it is reversible, deep brain stimulation is considered fairly safe: Reduction in tremor amplitude is almost guaranteed and sometimes resolved.

Of those, 145 were female shamans, and the remaining three were transvestite male shamans, thus highlighting the statistical imbalance between the female-to-male ratio of indigenous shamans. The anonymously-written \"Manila Manuscript\" also emphasized the auxiliary role of gender non-conforming male shamans in relation to the female shamans. These evidences, together with the fact that there were no written accounts of female sex/male gender identification amongst the women who exercised authority within the spiritual sphere, prove that spiritual potency was not dependent upon the identification with a neuter \"third\" sex/gender space, but rather on the identification with the feminine \u2013 whether the biological sex was female or male. While Brewer (1999) agreed that it is na\u00efve to dismiss the existence of a principal male shaman during the precolonial era, she also argued that such cases were unusual rather than the norm, and that the statistical imbalance in favour of principal male shamans occurred as a result of the influence of the male-centered Hispano-Catholic culture, such that in the late nineteenth century and in the early years of the twentieth century, in some areas like Negros, all the ''babaylan'' were male.<ref name=\"brewer99\"/><ref group=note>For the previous statement regarding the Bolinao Manuscript, see paragraph 29.

The first are the environmental or nature spirits \"bound\" to a particular location or natural phenomenon (similar to [[genii loci]]). They \"own\" places and concepts like agricultural fields, forests, cliffs, seas, winds, lightning, or realms in the spirit world. Some were also \"keepers\" or [[totem]]s of various animals and plants. They have inhuman and abstract qualities, reflecting their particular dominions. They do not normally appear in human form and are usually gender-less or androgynous. They rarely concern themselves with human affairs. Rituals involving these spirits are almost always conducted outdoors.<ref name=\"buenconsejo2002\"/><ref name=\"novellino\">{{cite book|first1=Dario|last1= Novellino|editor1-first =David G. |editor1-last=Anderson |editor2-first= Eeva |editor2-last=Berglund|title =   Ethnographies of Conservation: Environmentalism and the Distribution of Privilege|chapter =Contrasting Landscapes, Conflicting Ontologies: Assessing Environmental Conservation on Palawan Island (The Philippines)|publisher =Berghahn Books|year =2003|pages=171\u2013188|isbn =9780857456748|chapter-url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=R1WwBWFEljQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe second type of spirits are the \"unbound\" spirits that have independent existence. They appear in animal (usually as birds) or human-like forms,<ref group=\"note\">Spirits in human form are believed to be distinguishable from humans because they do not have a [[philtrum]]. (Buenconsejo, 2002)</ref> have gender differentiation, and have personal names.<ref group=\"note\">Names of spirits are generally not spoken aloud outside of a shamanic ritual, as it is believed that it may provoke them. They are instead referred to in euphemistic terms like ''\"dili ingon nato\"'' or ''\"hindi kagaya natin\"'', literally meaning \"those unlike us\". (Buenconsejo, 2002; Tan, 2008)</ref> They are most similar to the [[Fairy|fairies]] of European folklore.<ref group=\"note\">With strong parallels to human-like beings like [[Elf|elves]] and ''[[aos s\u00ed]]'', as well as diminutive human-like beings like [[Brownie (folklore)|brownies]] and [[pixie]]s. (Buenconsejo, 2002)</ref> These are the most common types of spirits to become ''abyan'', as they are the most \"sociable\" and can take interest in human activities. These spirits are usually referred to as ''engkanto'' (from Spanish ''encanto'') in modern Filipino folklore. Unlike the \"bound\" spirits, these spirits can be invited into human households, and their rituals can take place both outdoors and indoors.<ref name=\"buenconsejo2002\"/>\n\nThese categories are not static, however. A bound spirit can become unbound, and vice versa. Some shamans have spirit guides which are originally nature spirits that have become unbound.<ref name=\"buenconsejo2002\"/>\n\nNot all shamanic rituals result in [[spirit possession]]. Unbound spirits always possess shamans during rituals. Either voluntarily or involuntarily. In contrast, bound spirits, as a rule, do not possess shamans. Instead, they are simply spoken to by the shaman. Bound spirits that inadvertently \"stick\" to humans are considered dangerous, and are the causes of spiritual illnesses, ranging from confusion, strange food cravings, lust, to unreasoning anger. Sometimes in order to speak to certain bound spirits, the shaman may need the intercession of their ''abyan'', who in turn will possess the shaman. Bound spirits can also be interacted with by non-shamans, like when offering sacrifices to the spirit of the forest before a hunt.<ref name=\"buenconsejo2002\"/>\n\n===Healing===\n{{See also|Mananambal|Soul dualism}}\nHealing was the most important role for shamans in their communities. Shamans distinguished between two kinds of illnesses, the natural (or non-spiritual) illnesses, and the spiritual illnesses.

A person is believed to be composed of at least two souls\u2014the breath of life (''ginhawa'' or ''hininga'', which stays with the living body) and the [[Astral body|astral soul]] (the ''kalag'' or ''kaluluwa'', which can travel to the spirit world).<ref group=\"note\">Other names for the astral soul include ''kaluha'', ''dungan'' (Visayan); ''kalag'' ([[Bicolano people|Bicol]]); ''linnawa'' ([[Igorot people|Igorot]]), ''kaduwa'' ([[Isneg people|Isneg]]), ''ab-abiik'' ([[Kankanaey people|Kankanaey]]), ''karurua'' ([[Ilocano people|Ilocano]]), ''ikaruruwa'' ([[Ibanag people|Ibanag]]), ''karaduwa'' ([[Mangyan people|Mangyan]]), ''kiyaraluwa'' ([[Tagbanwa people|Tagbanwa]]), ''makatu'' ([[Bukidnon people|Bukidnon]]), and ''kadengan-dengan'' or ''gimokud'' ([[Manobo people|Manobo]]). (Scott, 1994; Tan, 2008; Mercado, 1991) Most of the terms for the astral soul literally translate to \"twin\" or \"double\", from PAN *duSa, \"two\". (Yu, 2000; Blust, 2010)</ref> The ''ginhawa'' is believed to reside in the pit of the stomach (usually the [[liver]]), while the ''kalag'' resides in the head. The ''ginhawa'' represents the person's body and bodily urges; while the ''kalag'' represents the person's identity, mind, and strength of will. Both are required in a living person.<ref name=\"salazar\"/><ref name=\"yu2000\">{{cite book|first1=Jose Vidamor B. |last1=Yu|title =Inculturation of Filipino-Chinese Culture Mentality|volume=Volume 3|publisher =Editrice Pontifica Universita Gregoriana|series =Interreligious and Intercultural Investigations|year =2000|pages=148, 149|isbn =9788876528484|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=c4WqAOKb5c8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"duSa\">{{cite web |first1==Robert |last1=Blust|first2=Stephen |last2=Trussel|title=Austronesian Comparative Dictionary: *du |url=http://www.trussel2.com/acd/acd-s_d.htm#30339 |website=Austronesian Comparative Dictionary |accessdate=7 July 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"pacete\"/>\n\nNatural illnesses are the result of damage to the ''ginhawa''. While they do not require a shaman, they are still important, as the death of the ''ginhawa'' will also mean the death of the body. They can range from wounds, broken bones, poisoning, and snakebites. These can be treated by skilled shamans, but were more often relegated to apprentices or assistants specializing in healing or herbalism.<ref name=\"salazar\"/><ref name=\"yu2000\"/><ref name=\"pacete\"/>\n\nSpiritual illnesses, on the other hand, are believed to be caused by the separation of the ''kalag'' from the ''ginhawa'' (referred to as \"soul loss\" in [[Anthropology|anthropological]] literature). This separation happens normally during sleep, where the ''kalag'' detaches to travel through the spirit world, resulting in dreams. However, when this separation happens when the person is awake, it results in spiritual illnesses. The causes of the separation can include the ''kalag'' getting lost in the spirit world; the ''kalag'' being captured, attacked, or seduced by another spirit; or simply the refusal of the ''kalag'' to return to the ''ginhawa''. While it is not immediately lethal, the loss of the ''kalag'' can result in the loss of the person's mind and identity\u2014thus insanity. Spiritual illnesses also include delirium, depression, trauma, fainting spells, and other mental illnesses. Evil or undesirable behavior may also be blamed on disharmony between the ''kalag'' and the ''ginhawa''.<ref name=\"salazar\"/><ref name=\"yu2000\"/><ref name=\"pacete\"/><ref name=\"mercado1991\">{{cite journal|first1=Leonardo N.|last1= Mercado|year=1991|title=Soul and Spirit in Filipino Thought |journal=Philippine Studies|volume=39|issue=3|pages=287\u2013302|jstor=42633258 }}</ref>\n\nShamans may also perform rituals to heal and strengthen the ''kalag'' of a person. These include the ritual of ''batak dungan'' or ''batakan'' among Visayan shamans. It strengthens and empowers the ''kalag'' of a person to prepare them for challenges, problems and obstacles.

It can be done by the shamans or by specialized apprentices with the necessary skill. Various paraphernalia and rituals are used to diagnose illnesses, examples include seashells, ginger, [[quartz]] or [[alum]] [[crystal]]s (''tawas''), and chicken entrails. Diviners have names that indicate their preferred methods. For example, a diviner using alum crystals is known as a ''magtatawas'', while a diviner that prefers to conduct a ritual known as ''luop'' is known as a ''mangluluop''.<ref name=\"Labastida\"/>\n\nDiviners are also able to foretell the future and perform [[geomancy]] rituals. A key mythological creature used in ''babaylan'' geomancy in the Visayas is the ''[[bakunawa]]'' (or ''naga''), usually depicted as a gigantic serpent or dragon with a looped tail. The movements of the ''bakunawa'' affected the physical world, from the phases of the moon, to eclipses, the weather, floods, and earthquakes. The ''bakunawa'' was central to a sixteen-point [[compass rose]]. It faces a different [[cardinal direction]] every three months; facing north (''aminhan''), west (''katungdan''), south (''bagatnan''), and east (''sidlangan'') in a given twelve-month [[Lunar calendar|lunar year]]. The mouth of the ''bakunawa'' is believed to bring misfortune and evil, and various points in the compass all had different aspects depending on where the mouth was facing. These were consulted when making future plans like travel, trade, or marriage. When building houses, shamans were also often consulted to determine the most propitious placement of the foundations to avoid the ill luck brought by the ''bakunawa''.<ref name=\"mccoy\"/><ref group=\"note\">Similar beliefs exist throughout [[Southeast Asia]].

Shamans deal with the spirit world and supernatural beings but do not have magical powers of their own; while sorcerers were regarded as human beings with powers gained from magical spells or objects. Illnesses believed to be caused by sorcery are treated differently from illnesses caused by spirits. The former are treated with counter-spells, simple antidotes, and physical healing; while the latter requires the intervention or dialogue with the spirits and thus a shaman ritual.<ref name=\"buenconsejo2002\"/>\n\nIn contrast, in Visayan societies, the most powerful shamans were sorcerers known as ''dalagangan'' (also ''dalongdongan'' or ''busalian''). They could purportedly command the elements through magic spells and the strength of their ''kalag'' (or ''dungan'') which was equated with \"[spiritual] power\".<ref group=\"note\">People with strong ''dungan'' are known as ''dunganon''. They are described as being charismatic, very intelligent, confident, and strong-willed. They have a tendency to dominate others, and can do so without consciously being aware of it. They are natural leaders and are often respected ranking members of the community and thus tend to become sorcerers, shamans, chieftains, master craftsmen, or renowned warrior-heroes (known variously as ''bayani'', ''bagani'', or ''banwar'' in various Filipino ethnic groups). The concept of ''dungan'' is comparable to the term ''[[mana]]'' in [[Pacific Islander]] culture as well as similar \"men of prowess\" concepts in other [[Austronesian people|Austronesian]] cultures. (Aguilar, 1998)</ref> Their alleged powers include conjuring fire or water, flight, shape-shifting, invisibility, invulnerability, and the ability to call down disasters. The ''[[Pulahan|dios-dios]]'' leaders of the Visayan peasant revolts in the late 19th century often claimed to possess these kinds of powers.<ref name=\"mccoy\"/><ref name=\"salazar\"/><ref name=\"feleo\">{{cite book|first1=Anita B.|last1= Feleo|title =Iloilo: A Rich and Noble Land|publisher =Lopez Group Foundation|year =2007|page=65|isbn =9789719390404}}</ref> A more common use of the power to command elements is [[Rainmaking (ritual)|rainmaking]].

King Awilawil o Ndaw of the kingdom of Kaibat a Kadaan for example, has a ''tonong'' named Salindagaw Masingir that can take the aspect of typhoons, floods, and pillars of fire; while King Dalondong a Mimbantas of the kingdom of Gindolongan Marogong has a ''tonong'' named Mabokelod a Romba which took the form of a giant crocodile.<ref name=\"v1\">{{cite book |last1=Coronel |first1=Maria Delia |last2=Cali |first2=Hadji Lawa |title=Darangen: In Original Maranao Verse, with English Translation |date=1986 |publisher=Folklore Division, University Research Center, Mindanao State University |location=Marawi |isbn=9789711110338 |url=http://filameducation.com/wp-content/uploads/Darangen.pdf|volume=Volume 1}}</ref><ref name=\"Miura\">{{cite journal |last1=Miura |first1=Taro |title=Darangen: In Original Maranao Verses, with English Translation, Vo. 5 |journal=Asian Folklore Studies |date=1993 |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=319\u2013322 |url=https://asianethnology.org/downloads/ae/pdf/a756.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"Saber\">{{cite journal |last1=Saber |first1=Mamitua |title=Darangen: The Epic of the Maranaws |journal=Philippine Sociological Review |date=1961 |volume=9 |issue=1/2 |pages=42\u201346 |jstor=43498156 }}</ref>\n\n====Talismans and potions====\n{{Expand section|date=November 2018}}\n\n====Black magic====\n{{Main|Barang (magic)}}\nSorcerers are also believed to have powers that [[Black magic|cause harm to other people]] covertly.

Their targets are usually \"wrongdoers\" like thieves, adulterous spouses, or [[land grabbing|land grabbers]]. There are also \"true\" sorcerers who are said to have hereditary sorcerous powers. Unlike healers, they do not consider the justice of their actions.

This is known by various names like ''kulam'', ''gaway'' (Tagalog); ''barang'', ''hiwit'', ''l\u00e1g\u00e0'' (Visayan); ''tanem'', ''tamay'' (Ilocano); and ''pantak'' ([[Moro people|Moro]]). Despite the differences in terminology, the methods are almost identical across the Philippine islands (and indeed, across Southeast Asia). This type of sorcery uses [[beetle]]s, [[Effigy|effigies]], [[poppet]]s, a boiling pot or some other type of representation of the target victim.<ref group=\"note\">The term ''barang'' refers to a type of beetle in Visayan. ''[[wikt:laga|L\u00e1g\u00e0]]'' (sometimes written as ''la-ga'' or ''la-aga'') means to brew or to boil [in a pot]. (McClenon, 1985)</ref> These are usually \"linked\" by including bodily [[exuviae]] like hair or nail clippings. These are activated by chants, spells, or symbols (sometimes syncretized with Christian or Muslim rituals). The sorcerer then either harms the effigy to cause corresponding harm to the victim, or physically \"sends\" objects into the victim's body (which can range from insects, stones, to pins).<ref name=\"mccoy\"/><ref name=\"tan\"/> In some instances, the ingredients of the ritual themselves determine the effects. For example, adding seawater to a boiling pot \"linked\" to a victim is said to cause the victim's belly to swell and ache in time with the [[tide]]s.<ref name=\"gaabucayan71\"/> This type of sorcery was documented as early as the 17th century by [[Francisco Comb\u00e9s]].<ref name=\"mccoy\"/><ref name=\"tan\">{{cite book|first1=Michael L. |last1=Tan|title =Revisiting Usog, Pasma, Kulam|publisher =University of the Philippines Press|year =2008|isbn =9789715425704|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=EktzHrfup1UC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nOther malevolent powers are more direct. These include the ability to kill another person instantly with magic spells, the ability to cast [[curse]]s or the [[evil eye]], the ability to \"abduct\" a person's soul, or the ability to send evil spirits or [[Familiar spirit|familiar animals]] to possess or harm the victim.<ref name=\"buenconsejo2002\"/><ref name=\"tan\"/>\n\nSome of these purportedly sorcerous powers may be explained by the use of poisons (''hilo'' or ''lason'') and [[sleight of hand]]. In most cases however, accusations of this type of black magic are often borne out of [[paranoia]], [[moral panic]], or [[Mass psychogenic illness|mass hysteria]] against disliked or mistrusted members of the community, similar to the European [[witch-hunt]]s. People accused of black magic were often subject to ostracization and in many cases, violence. This was especially true during the Spanish colonial period, where in one instance in the mid-19th century, a Filipino [[curate]] ordered the assassination of 57 people he suspected were sorcerers casting evil spells on his sick mother.<ref name=\"tan\"/>\n\nSorcerous \"attacks\" are most commonly treated with ''sumbalik'' (counter-spells or antidotes), which are themselves, a form of sorcery and do not usually require interaction with the spirits. They purportedly deflect the effects of the curse and return it to the caster. In extreme cases, ''sumbalik'' can kill the caster. Other healing rituals against sorcery do not harm the caster, but instead supposedly moves them to pity and thus revoke the curse.<ref name=\"gaabucayan71\"/><ref name=\"tomada\"/><ref name=\"manyfaces\">{{cite web|url=https://www.aswangproject.com/many-faces-filipino-folk-healers/|title=The Many Faces of Filipino Folk Healers|first1=Daniel |last1=De Guzman|publisher=The Aswang Project|accessdate=14 July 2018|date=2017-09-27}}</ref>\n\n==Persecution, decline, and syncretization==\nThe [[History of the Philippines (1521\u20131898)|Spanish colonization of the Philippines]] and the introduction of Catholic Christianity resulted in the extinction of most native shamanistic practices. Christianity was initially seen by native Filipinos as another type of ''[[anito]]''. The Spanish missionaries exploited this misconception in their successful conversion and occupation of most of the islands with minimal military support. Spanish [[friar]]s were seen as \"shamans\" whose souls and spirit guides were apparently more powerful than the native ones. They desecrated religious objects, sacred trees, and sacred areas with impunity, earning the awe of the natives. They could also cure various diseases that the native shamans could not.<ref name=\"aguilar98\"/>\n\nBy the late 16th century, Christian symbols and paraphernalia (like [[Rosary|rosaries]], [[crucifix]]es, and [[holy water]]) became [[Fetishism|fetish]] objects, and [[Latin]] prayers and verses became part of the shaman's repertoire of magical chants and spells. ''Anito'' images (''taotao'') were replaced by Catholic idols and their rituals [[syncretism|syncretized]], including attributing ''anito''-like powers to them like miraculous healing from touching them or an ability to [[spirit possession|possess]] people.<ref group=\"note\">Examples include the festivals of the [[Black Nazarene]] and the [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa]] (McCoy, 1982)</ref> These flourished as they were tolerated by the Spanish clergy as \"[[white magic]]\". Nature spirits (''[[diwata]]'') during this period were also syncretized with the friars themselves, they became known as ''engkanto'' and began to be described as having European features with a propensity for deceiving, seducing, and playing tricks on people.<ref name=\"mccoy\"/><ref name=\"demetrio73\"/><ref name=\"aguilar98\"/>\n\nThe previously high status of the ''babaylan'' was lost. The role of women and the relative [[Gender equality|gender egalitarianism]] of Philippine animistic cultures, in general, became more subdued under the [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] culture of the Spanish. Most ''babaylan'' were stigmatized by the Catholic clergy as [[Witchcraft|witches]], [[Satanism|satanists]], or mentally unstable.  The Spanish burned down everything they associated as connected to the native people's indigenous religions (including shrines such as the ''[[dambana]]''), even forcefully ordering native children to defecate on their own god's idols.<ref name=esquiremag/><ref name=\"liturgy\"/><ref name=\"peletz2009\"/>\n\n[[File:Babaylan.jpg|thumb|Performers depicting babaylans]]\nA few shamans, however, were assimilated by the church and syncretized their roles into [[mysticism]] in the Christian context, becoming [[Faith healing|faith healers]] and miracle workers.<ref name=\"liturgy\"/><ref name=\"peletz2009\">{{cite book|first1=Michael G. |last1=Peletz =|title =Gender Pluralism: Southeast Asia Since Early Modern Times|chapter =|publisher =Routledge|series =|year =2009|page=84|isbn = 9781135954895|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=HGOTAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> These include the ''beata'' movement in the 17th and 18th centuries, the [[Messianism|messianic]] (and usually [[Rebellion|revolutionary]]) ''[[Pulahan|dios-dios]]'' movement of the late 19th century, and the ''espiritista'' (or ''spiritista'') movement of the 20th century.<ref name=\"salazar\"/><ref name=\"mallari2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/the-filipina-as-ritualist-and-warrior/81079/|title=The Filipina as ritualist and warrior|first1=Perry Gil S.|last1= Mallari|date=8 March 2014|publisher=The Manila Times|accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"marco2001\">{{cite journal|first1=Sophia |last1=Marco|year=2001|title=Dios-Dios in the Visayas|journal=Philippine Studies|volume=49|issue=1|pages=42\u201377|url=http://www.philippinestudies.net/files/journals/1/articles/8474/public/8474-8828-1-PB.pdf}}</ref> However, their methods of worship remain basically the same.

During the 17th to 18th centuries, Spanish administrators in the Philippines burned people convicted of homosexual relations at the stake and confiscated their possessions, in accordance to a decree by the president of the [[Real Audiencia]], Pedro Hurtado Desquibel.

In ''Historia de las Islas de Mindanao, Iolo, y sus adyacentes'' (1667), the Spanish priest [[Francisco Comb\u00e9s]] records that their \"unnatural crime\" was punished by the Muslim peoples in Mindanao with death by burning or drowning, and that their houses and property were also burned as they believed that it was contagious.<ref name=\"garcia2008\"/>\n\n== Resistance against colonial rule==\nA few followers of the native shamanism resisted Spanish rule and conversion, especially in areas difficult to reach for Spanish missionaries, like the highlands of [[Luzon]] and the interiors of [[Mindanao]]. In Spanish-controlled areas (especially in the [[Visayas]]), entire villages would defy the policies of ''[[Reductions|reducci\u00f3nes]]'' (resettlement) and move deeper into the island interiors at the instigation of their ''babaylan''. Shamanistic rituals also continued to be performed secretly in some areas, though these were punished by the Spanish clergy when discovered.<ref name=\"aguilar98\"/>\n\nOpen revolts led by shamans were common during Spanish rule. Aside from the early revolts in the 17th century, most of these were led by religious leaders who practiced [[Folk Catholicism]] rather than true shamanism.<ref name=\"marco2001\"/>\n\n===17th century===\nThe first recorded armed revolt led by a ''babaylan'' was the [[Tamblot uprising]] of [[Bohol]] in 1621\u20131622. It was led by a male shaman named [[Tamblot]] who saw the spread of Catholicism as a threat. He rallied around two thousand followers in an effort to \"return to the old ways\", but his rebellion was crushed by the Spanish authorities with the help of converted native auxiliaries.<ref name=\"woods2006\">{{cite book|first1=Damon L. |last1=Woods|title =The Philippines: A Global Studies Handbook|publisher =ABC-CLIO|year =2006|isbn =9781851096756|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=2Z-n_kDTxf0C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nTamblot's revolt inspired another rebellion in neighboring [[Carigara, Leyte]] in the same time period.

Tapar syncretized native shamanism with Catholic terminology and declared himself \"God Almighty\" of a new religion. He also emulated the ancient ''asog'' by dressing up in women's clothing. He and his followers killed a Spanish priest and burned the town church before escaping to the mountains. Tapar and other leaders of his movement were captured and executed by Spanish and Filipino soldiers.<ref name=\"woods2006\"/><ref name=\"duka\"/>\n\n===18th century===\nA religious uprising in 1785 in Ituy (modern [[Aritao]]), [[Nueva Vizcaya]] was led by a healer named Lagutao.

It was suppressed by neighboring Christian townsmen led by [[Dominican Order|Dominican friars]].<ref name=\"marco2001\"/>\n\n===19th century===\nThe 19th century saw the rise of the ''dios-dios'' \"shamans\". ''Dios-dios'' (literally \"[[False prophet|god pretender]]\" or \"false god\", from Spanish ''dios'') were religious leaders so named because of their penchant for identifying themselves with Christian religious figures. They led [[cult]]-like religious movements, promising prosperity, supernatural powers, or healing to their followers. Most were mere [[charlatan]]s selling amulets and magical pieces of paper. Their members were mostly from the illiterate rural poor who had little knowledge of formal Catholic teachings and were living in extreme poverty under colonial rule.<ref name=\"marco2001\"/>\n[[File:\"Papa Isio\" (Dionisio Magbuelas) (1907).jpg|thumb|[[Papa Isio]] with two ''babaylanes'' followers in a prison in [[Bacolod]] after his surrender to American authorities in 1907.

These movements were usually suppressed by the Spanish by imprisoning their leaders or exiling them.<ref name=\"marco2001\"/>\n\nThe ''dios-dios'' movement was initially purely religious, only reacting defensively to Spanish persecution. However, by the 1880s, some ''dios-dios'' groups became more violently anti-colonial. The first such group was the one led by Ponciano Elofre, a ''[[Cabeza de Barangay|cabeza de barangay]]'' of a ''[[sitio]]'' of [[Zamboanguita]], [[Negros Oriental]]. He took the name \"[[Dios Buhawi]]\" (\"Whirlwind God\") and proclaimed himself the savior of the people. He declared that they would stop paying taxes to the Spanish government. He formed a community of around two thousand followers (whom the Spanish authorities called the ''babaylanes'') and would regularly attack Spanish-controlled towns. Emulating the ancient ''asog'' shamans, he dressed in women's clothing and assumed feminine mannerisms even though he was married to a woman. He claimed supernatural powers much like the ancient ''dalagangan''. He was killed while attacking the town of [[Siaton]] in 1887. His wife and relatives attempted to continue the movement, but they were eventually captured and exiled by Spanish authorities. The remnants of the group either descended to banditry or joined other later ''dios-dios'' movements.<ref name=\"mccoy\"/><ref name=\"aguilar98\"/><ref name=\"marco2001\"/>\n\nAnother ''dios-dios'' uprising was led by a shaman named [[Gregorio Lampinio]] (better known as \"Gregorio Dios\", and also known as \"Hilario Pablo\" or \"Papa\") in [[Antique (province)|Antique]] from 1888. The uprising was formed near [[Mount Balabago]], a sacred pilgrimage site for shamans. Lampinio led a force of around 400 people. They collected ''contribuciones babaylanes'' (a [[revolutionary tax]]), disseminated anti-colonial ideas, and launched attacks on towns in Antique and Iloilo. The group was eventually suppressed by the [[Civil Guard (Philippines)|Guardia Civil]] by 1890.<ref name=\"marco2001\"/>\n\nThe last significant ''dios-dios'' rebellion in the 19th century was led by Dionisio Magbuelas, better known as [[Papa Isio]] (\"Pope Isio\"). He was a former member of the Dios Buhawi group. He organized his own ''babaylanes'' group from remnants of Elofre's followers and led an uprising in [[Negros Occidental]] in 1896 against Spanish rule. After the Philippines was ceded to the United States after the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], he was initially made \"military chief\" of [[La Castellana, Negros Occidental]] under the [[United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands|American government]]. However, he picked up armed resistance again in 1899 in the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. He surrendered in August 6, 1907 to American authorities and was sentenced to death.

Of those, 145 were female shamans, and the remaining three were transvestite male shamans, thus highlighting the statistical imbalance between the female-to-male ratio of indigenous shamans. The anonymously-written \"Manila Manuscript\" also emphasized the auxiliary role of gender non-conforming male shamans in relation to the female shamans. These evidences, together with the fact that there were no written accounts of female sex/male gender identification amongst the women who exercised authority within the spiritual sphere, prove that spiritual potency was not dependent upon the identification with a neuter \"third\" sex/gender space, but rather on the identification with the feminine \u2013 whether the biological sex was female or male. While Brewer (1999) agreed that it is na\u00efve to dismiss the existence of a principal male shaman during the precolonial era, she also argued that such cases were unusual rather than the norm, and that the statistical imbalance in favour of principal male shamans occurred as a result of the influence of the male-centered Hispano-Catholic culture, such that in the late nineteenth century and in the early years of the twentieth century, in some areas like Negros, all the ''babaylan'' were male.<ref name=\"brewer99\"/><ref group=note>For the previous statement regarding the Bolinao Manuscript, see paragraph 29.

The first are the environmental or nature spirits \"bound\" to a particular location or natural phenomenon (similar to [[genii loci]]). They \"own\" places and concepts like agricultural fields, forests, cliffs, seas, winds, lightning, or realms in the spirit world. Some were also \"keepers\" or [[totem]]s of various animals and plants. They have inhuman and abstract qualities, reflecting their particular dominions. They do not normally appear in human form and are usually gender-less or androgynous. They rarely concern themselves with human affairs. Rituals involving these spirits are almost always conducted outdoors.<ref name=\"buenconsejo2002\"/><ref name=\"novellino\">{{cite book|first1=Dario|last1= Novellino|editor1-first =David G. |editor1-last=Anderson |editor2-first= Eeva |editor2-last=Berglund|title =   Ethnographies of Conservation: Environmentalism and the Distribution of Privilege|chapter =Contrasting Landscapes, Conflicting Ontologies: Assessing Environmental Conservation on Palawan Island (The Philippines)|publisher =Berghahn Books|year =2003|pages=171\u2013188|isbn =9780857456748|chapter-url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=R1WwBWFEljQC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nThe second type of spirits are the \"unbound\" spirits that have independent existence. They appear in animal (usually as birds) or human-like forms,<ref group=\"note\">Spirits in human form are believed to be distinguishable from humans because they do not have a [[philtrum]]. (Buenconsejo, 2002)</ref> have gender differentiation, and have personal names.<ref group=\"note\">Names of spirits are generally not spoken aloud outside of a shamanic ritual, as it is believed that it may provoke them. They are instead referred to in euphemistic terms like ''\"dili ingon nato\"'' or ''\"hindi kagaya natin\"'', literally meaning \"those unlike us\". (Buenconsejo, 2002; Tan, 2008)</ref> They are most similar to the [[Fairy|fairies]] of European folklore.<ref group=\"note\">With strong parallels to human-like beings like [[Elf|elves]] and ''[[aos s\u00ed]]'', as well as diminutive human-like beings like [[Brownie (folklore)|brownies]] and [[pixie]]s. (Buenconsejo, 2002)</ref> These are the most common types of spirits to become ''abyan'', as they are the most \"sociable\" and can take interest in human activities. These spirits are usually referred to as ''engkanto'' (from Spanish ''encanto'') in modern Filipino folklore. Unlike the \"bound\" spirits, these spirits can be invited into human households, and their rituals can take place both outdoors and indoors.<ref name=\"buenconsejo2002\"/>\n\nThese categories are not static, however. A bound spirit can become unbound, and vice versa. Some shamans have spirit guides which are originally nature spirits that have become unbound.<ref name=\"buenconsejo2002\"/>\n\nNot all shamanic rituals result in [[spirit possession]]. Unbound spirits always possess shamans during rituals. Either voluntarily or involuntarily. In contrast, bound spirits, as a rule, do not possess shamans. Instead, they are simply spoken to by the shaman. Bound spirits that inadvertently \"stick\" to humans are considered dangerous, and are the causes of spiritual illnesses, ranging from confusion, strange food cravings, lust, to unreasoning anger. Sometimes in order to speak to certain bound spirits, the shaman may need the intercession of their ''abyan'', who in turn will possess the shaman. Bound spirits can also be interacted with by non-shamans, like when offering sacrifices to the spirit of the forest before a hunt.<ref name=\"buenconsejo2002\"/>\n\n===Healing===\n{{See also|Mananambal|Soul dualism}}\nHealing was the most important role for shamans in their communities. Shamans distinguished between two kinds of illnesses, the natural (or non-spiritual) illnesses, and the spiritual illnesses.

A person is believed to be composed of at least two souls\u2014the breath of life (''ginhawa'' or ''hininga'', which stays with the living body) and the [[Astral body|astral soul]] (the ''kalag'' or ''kaluluwa'', which can travel to the spirit world).<ref group=\"note\">Other names for the astral soul include ''kaluha'', ''dungan'' (Visayan); ''kalag'' ([[Bicolano people|Bicol]]); ''linnawa'' ([[Igorot people|Igorot]]), ''kaduwa'' ([[Isneg people|Isneg]]), ''ab-abiik'' ([[Kankanaey people|Kankanaey]]), ''karurua'' ([[Ilocano people|Ilocano]]), ''ikaruruwa'' ([[Ibanag people|Ibanag]]), ''karaduwa'' ([[Mangyan people|Mangyan]]), ''kiyaraluwa'' ([[Tagbanwa people|Tagbanwa]]), ''makatu'' ([[Bukidnon people|Bukidnon]]), and ''kadengan-dengan'' or ''gimokud'' ([[Manobo people|Manobo]]). (Scott, 1994; Tan, 2008; Mercado, 1991) Most of the terms for the astral soul literally translate to \"twin\" or \"double\", from PAN *duSa, \"two\". (Yu, 2000; Blust, 2010)</ref> The ''ginhawa'' is believed to reside in the pit of the stomach (usually the [[liver]]), while the ''kalag'' resides in the head. The ''ginhawa'' represents the person's body and bodily urges; while the ''kalag'' represents the person's identity, mind, and strength of will. Both are required in a living person.<ref name=\"salazar\"/><ref name=\"yu2000\">{{cite book|first1=Jose Vidamor B. |last1=Yu|title =Inculturation of Filipino-Chinese Culture Mentality|volume=Volume 3|publisher =Editrice Pontifica Universita Gregoriana|series =Interreligious and Intercultural Investigations|year =2000|pages=148, 149|isbn =9788876528484|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=c4WqAOKb5c8C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref><ref name=\"duSa\">{{cite web |first1==Robert |last1=Blust|first2=Stephen |last2=Trussel|title=Austronesian Comparative Dictionary: *du |url=http://www.trussel2.com/acd/acd-s_d.htm#30339 |website=Austronesian Comparative Dictionary |accessdate=7 July 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"pacete\"/>\n\nNatural illnesses are the result of damage to the ''ginhawa''. While they do not require a shaman, they are still important, as the death of the ''ginhawa'' will also mean the death of the body. They can range from wounds, broken bones, poisoning, and snakebites. These can be treated by skilled shamans, but were more often relegated to apprentices or assistants specializing in healing or herbalism.<ref name=\"salazar\"/><ref name=\"yu2000\"/><ref name=\"pacete\"/>\n\nSpiritual illnesses, on the other hand, are believed to be caused by the separation of the ''kalag'' from the ''ginhawa'' (referred to as \"soul loss\" in [[Anthropology|anthropological]] literature). This separation happens normally during sleep, where the ''kalag'' detaches to travel through the spirit world, resulting in dreams. However, when this separation happens when the person is awake, it results in spiritual illnesses. The causes of the separation can include the ''kalag'' getting lost in the spirit world; the ''kalag'' being captured, attacked, or seduced by another spirit; or simply the refusal of the ''kalag'' to return to the ''ginhawa''. While it is not immediately lethal, the loss of the ''kalag'' can result in the loss of the person's mind and identity\u2014thus insanity. Spiritual illnesses also include delirium, depression, trauma, fainting spells, and other mental illnesses. Evil or undesirable behavior may also be blamed on disharmony between the ''kalag'' and the ''ginhawa''.<ref name=\"salazar\"/><ref name=\"yu2000\"/><ref name=\"pacete\"/><ref name=\"mercado1991\">{{cite journal|first1=Leonardo N.|last1= Mercado|year=1991|title=Soul and Spirit in Filipino Thought |journal=Philippine Studies|volume=39|issue=3|pages=287\u2013302|jstor=42633258 }}</ref>\n\nShamans may also perform rituals to heal and strengthen the ''kalag'' of a person. These include the ritual of ''batak dungan'' or ''batakan'' among Visayan shamans. It strengthens and empowers the ''kalag'' of a person to prepare them for challenges, problems and obstacles.

It can be done by the shamans or by specialized apprentices with the necessary skill. Various paraphernalia and rituals are used to diagnose illnesses, examples include seashells, ginger, [[quartz]] or [[alum]] [[crystal]]s (''tawas''), and chicken entrails. Diviners have names that indicate their preferred methods. For example, a diviner using alum crystals is known as a ''magtatawas'', while a diviner that prefers to conduct a ritual known as ''luop'' is known as a ''mangluluop''.<ref name=\"Labastida\"/>\n\nDiviners are also able to foretell the future and perform [[geomancy]] rituals. A key mythological creature used in ''babaylan'' geomancy in the Visayas is the ''[[bakunawa]]'' (or ''naga''), usually depicted as a gigantic serpent or dragon with a looped tail. The movements of the ''bakunawa'' affected the physical world, from the phases of the moon, to eclipses, the weather, floods, and earthquakes. The ''bakunawa'' was central to a sixteen-point [[compass rose]]. It faces a different [[cardinal direction]] every three months; facing north (''aminhan''), west (''katungdan''), south (''bagatnan''), and east (''sidlangan'') in a given twelve-month [[Lunar calendar|lunar year]]. The mouth of the ''bakunawa'' is believed to bring misfortune and evil, and various points in the compass all had different aspects depending on where the mouth was facing. These were consulted when making future plans like travel, trade, or marriage. When building houses, shamans were also often consulted to determine the most propitious placement of the foundations to avoid the ill luck brought by the ''bakunawa''.<ref name=\"mccoy\"/><ref group=\"note\">Similar beliefs exist throughout [[Southeast Asia]]. These include the [[Cambodia]]n ''nak'', [[Burma|Burmese]] ''naga'', and [[Thailand|Thai]] ''naag''.

Shamans deal with the spirit world and supernatural beings but do not have magical powers of their own; while sorcerers were regarded as human beings with powers gained from magical spells or objects. Illnesses believed to be caused by sorcery are treated differently from illnesses caused by spirits. The former are treated with counter-spells, simple antidotes, and physical healing; while the latter requires the intervention or dialogue with the spirits and thus a shaman ritual.<ref name=\"buenconsejo2002\"/>\n\nIn contrast, in Visayan societies, the most powerful shamans were sorcerers known as ''dalagangan'' (also ''dalongdongan'' or ''busalian''). They could purportedly command the elements through magic spells and the strength of their ''kalag'' (or ''dungan'') which was equated with \"[spiritual] power\".<ref group=\"note\">People with strong ''dungan'' are known as ''dunganon''. They are described as being charismatic, very intelligent, confident, and strong-willed. They have a tendency to dominate others, and can do so without consciously being aware of it. They are natural leaders and are often respected ranking members of the community and thus tend to become sorcerers, shamans, chieftains, master craftsmen, or renowned warrior-heroes (known variously as ''bayani'', ''bagani'', or ''banwar'' in various Filipino ethnic groups).

King Awilawil o Ndaw of the kingdom of Kaibat a Kadaan for example, has a ''tonong'' named Salindagaw Masingir that can take the aspect of typhoons, floods, and pillars of fire; while King Dalondong a Mimbantas of the kingdom of Gindolongan Marogong has a ''tonong'' named Mabokelod a Romba which took the form of a giant crocodile.<ref name=\"v1\">{{cite book |last1=Coronel |first1=Maria Delia |last2=Cali |first2=Hadji Lawa |title=Darangen: In Original Maranao Verse, with English Translation |date=1986 |publisher=Folklore Division, University Research Center, Mindanao State University |location=Marawi |isbn=9789711110338 |url=http://filameducation.com/wp-content/uploads/Darangen.pdf|volume=Volume 1}}</ref><ref name=\"Miura\">{{cite journal |last1=Miura |first1=Taro |title=Darangen: In Original Maranao Verses, with English Translation, Vo. 5 |journal=Asian Folklore Studies |date=1993 |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=319\u2013322 |url=https://asianethnology.org/downloads/ae/pdf/a756.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"Saber\">{{cite journal |last1=Saber |first1=Mamitua |title=Darangen: The Epic of the Maranaws |journal=Philippine Sociological Review |date=1961 |volume=9 |issue=1/2 |pages=42\u201346 |jstor=43498156 }}</ref>\n\n====Talismans and potions====\n{{Expand section|date=November 2018}}\n\n====Black magic====\n{{Main|Barang (magic)}}\nSorcerers are also believed to have powers that [[Black magic|cause harm to other people]] covertly. Healer-sorcerers who practice this kind of sorcery usually justify it as a form of criminal punishment, as a widespread belief is that [[black magic]] does not work on people who are innocent. Their targets are usually \"wrongdoers\" like thieves, adulterous spouses, or [[land grabbing|land grabbers]]. There are also \"true\" sorcerers who are said to have hereditary sorcerous powers. Unlike healers, they do not consider the justice of their actions. The latter type of sorcerers are often conflated with the evil supernatural beings capable of appearing human, like ''[[aswang]]'' and ''[[manananggal]]''.<ref name=\"buenconsejo2002\"/><ref name=\"mcclenon\"/><ref name=\"tan\"/>\n\nOne of the most common kinds of black magic is a malevolent use of [[sympathetic magic]]. This is known by various names like ''kulam'', ''gaway'' (Tagalog); ''barang'', ''hiwit'', ''l\u00e1g\u00e0'' (Visayan); ''tanem'', ''tamay'' (Ilocano); and ''pantak'' ([[Moro people|Moro]]). Despite the differences in terminology, the methods are almost identical across the Philippine islands (and indeed, across Southeast Asia). This type of sorcery uses [[beetle]]s, [[Effigy|effigies]], [[poppet]]s, a boiling pot or some other type of representation of the target victim.<ref group=\"note\">The term ''barang'' refers to a type of beetle in Visayan. ''[[wikt:laga|L\u00e1g\u00e0]]'' (sometimes written as ''la-ga'' or ''la-aga'') means to brew or to boil [in a pot]. (McClenon, 1985)</ref> These are usually \"linked\" by including bodily [[exuviae]] like hair or nail clippings. These are activated by chants, spells, or symbols (sometimes syncretized with Christian or Muslim rituals). The sorcerer then either harms the effigy to cause corresponding harm to the victim, or physically \"sends\" objects into the victim's body (which can range from insects, stones, to pins).<ref name=\"mccoy\"/><ref name=\"tan\"/> In some instances, the ingredients of the ritual themselves determine the effects. For example, adding seawater to a boiling pot \"linked\" to a victim is said to cause the victim's belly to swell and ache in time with the [[tide]]s.<ref name=\"gaabucayan71\"/> This type of sorcery was documented as early as the 17th century by [[Francisco Comb\u00e9s]].<ref name=\"mccoy\"/><ref name=\"tan\">{{cite book|first1=Michael L. |last1=Tan|title =Revisiting Usog, Pasma, Kulam|publisher =University of the Philippines Press|year =2008|isbn =9789715425704|url =https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=EktzHrfup1UC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nOther malevolent powers are more direct. These include the ability to kill another person instantly with magic spells, the ability to cast [[curse]]s or the [[evil eye]], the ability to \"abduct\" a person's soul, or the ability to send evil spirits or [[Familiar spirit|familiar animals]] to possess or harm the victim.<ref name=\"buenconsejo2002\"/><ref name=\"tan\"/>\n\nSome of these purportedly sorcerous powers may be explained by the use of poisons (''hilo'' or ''lason'') and [[sleight of hand]]. In most cases however, accusations of this type of black magic are often borne out of [[paranoia]], [[moral panic]], or [[Mass psychogenic illness|mass hysteria]] against disliked or mistrusted members of the community, similar to the European [[witch-hunt]]s. People accused of black magic were often subject to ostracization and in many cases, violence. This was especially true during the Spanish colonial period, where in one instance in the mid-19th century, a Filipino [[curate]] ordered the assassination of 57 people he suspected were sorcerers casting evil spells on his sick mother.<ref name=\"tan\"/>\n\nSorcerous \"attacks\" are most commonly treated with ''sumbalik'' (counter-spells or antidotes), which are themselves, a form of sorcery and do not usually require interaction with the spirits. They purportedly deflect the effects of the curse and return it to the caster. In extreme cases, ''sumbalik'' can kill the caster. Other healing rituals against sorcery do not harm the caster, but instead supposedly moves them to pity and thus revoke the curse.<ref name=\"gaabucayan71\"/><ref name=\"tomada\"/><ref name=\"manyfaces\">{{cite web|url=https://www.aswangproject.com/many-faces-filipino-folk-healers/|title=The Many Faces of Filipino Folk Healers|first1=Daniel |last1=De Guzman|publisher=The Aswang Project|accessdate=14 July 2018|date=2017-09-27}}</ref>\n\n==Persecution, decline, and syncretization==\nThe [[History of the Philippines (1521\u20131898)|Spanish colonization of the Philippines]] and the introduction of Catholic Christianity resulted in the extinction of most native shamanistic practices. Christianity was initially seen by native Filipinos as another type of ''[[anito]]''. The Spanish missionaries exploited this misconception in their successful conversion and occupation of most of the islands with minimal military support. Spanish [[friar]]s were seen as \"shamans\" whose souls and spirit guides were apparently more powerful than the native ones. They desecrated religious objects, sacred trees, and sacred areas with impunity, earning the awe of the natives. They could also cure various diseases that the native shamans could not.<ref name=\"aguilar98\"/>\n\nBy the late 16th century, Christian symbols and paraphernalia (like [[Rosary|rosaries]], [[crucifix]]es, and [[holy water]]) became [[Fetishism|fetish]] objects, and [[Latin]] prayers and verses became part of the shaman's repertoire of magical chants and spells. ''Anito'' images (''taotao'') were replaced by Catholic idols and their rituals [[syncretism|syncretized]], including attributing ''anito''-like powers to them like miraculous healing from touching them or an ability to [[spirit possession|possess]] people.<ref group=\"note\">Examples include the festivals of the [[Black Nazarene]] and the [[Santo Ni\u00f1o de Ceb\u00fa]] (McCoy, 1982)</ref> These flourished as they were tolerated by the Spanish clergy as \"[[white magic]]\".

The role of women and the relative [[Gender equality|gender egalitarianism]] of Philippine animistic cultures, in general, became more subdued under the [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] culture of the Spanish. Most ''babaylan'' were stigmatized by the Catholic clergy as [[Witchcraft|witches]], [[Satanism|satanists]], or mentally unstable.

In Spanish-controlled areas (especially in the [[Visayas]]), entire villages would defy the policies of ''[[Reductions|reducci\u00f3nes]]'' (resettlement) and move deeper into the island interiors at the instigation of their ''babaylan''.

''Dios-dios'' (literally \"[[False prophet|god pretender]]\" or \"false god\", from Spanish ''dios'') were religious leaders so named because of their penchant for identifying themselves with Christian religious figures. They led [[cult]]-like religious movements, promising prosperity, supernatural powers, or healing to their followers. Most were mere [[charlatan]]s selling amulets and magical pieces of paper. Their members were mostly from the illiterate rural poor who had little knowledge of formal Catholic teachings and were living in extreme poverty under colonial rule.<ref name=\"marco2001\"/>\n[[File:\"Papa Isio\" (Dionisio Magbuelas) (1907).jpg|thumb|[[Papa Isio]] with two ''babaylanes'' followers in a prison in [[Bacolod]] after his surrender to American authorities in 1907.

These movements were usually suppressed by the Spanish by imprisoning their leaders or exiling them.<ref name=\"marco2001\"/>\n\nThe ''dios-dios'' movement was initially purely religious, only reacting defensively to Spanish persecution. However, by the 1880s, some ''dios-dios'' groups became more violently anti-colonial. The first such group was the one led by Ponciano Elofre, a ''[[Cabeza de Barangay|cabeza de barangay]]'' of a ''[[sitio]]'' of [[Zamboanguita]], [[Negros Oriental]]. He took the name \"[[Dios Buhawi]]\" (\"Whirlwind God\") and proclaimed himself the savior of the people. He declared that they would stop paying taxes to the Spanish government. He formed a community of around two thousand followers (whom the Spanish authorities called the ''babaylanes'') and would regularly attack Spanish-controlled towns. Emulating the ancient ''asog'' shamans, he dressed in women's clothing and assumed feminine mannerisms even though he was married to a woman. He claimed supernatural powers much like the ancient ''dalagangan''. He was killed while attacking the town of [[Siaton]] in 1887. His wife and relatives attempted to continue the movement, but they were eventually captured and exiled by Spanish authorities. The remnants of the group either descended to banditry or joined other later ''dios-dios'' movements.<ref name=\"mccoy\"/><ref name=\"aguilar98\"/><ref name=\"marco2001\"/>\n\nAnother ''dios-dios'' uprising was led by a shaman named [[Gregorio Lampinio]] (better known as \"Gregorio Dios\", and also known as \"Hilario Pablo\" or \"Papa\") in [[Antique (province)|Antique]] from 1888. The uprising was formed near [[Mount Balabago]], a sacred pilgrimage site for shamans. Lampinio led a force of around 400 people. They collected ''contribuciones babaylanes'' (a [[revolutionary tax]]), disseminated anti-colonial ideas, and launched attacks on towns in Antique and Iloilo. The group was eventually suppressed by the [[Civil Guard (Philippines)|Guardia Civil]] by 1890.<ref name=\"marco2001\"/>\n\nThe last significant ''dios-dios'' rebellion in the 19th century was led by Dionisio Magbuelas, better known as [[Papa Isio]] (\"Pope Isio\"). He was a former member of the Dios Buhawi group. He organized his own ''babaylanes'' group from remnants of Elofre's followers and led an uprising in [[Negros Occidental]] in 1896 against Spanish rule. After the Philippines was ceded to the United States after the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], he was initially made \"military chief\" of [[La Castellana, Negros Occidental]] under the [[United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands|American government]]. However, he picked up armed resistance again in 1899 in the [[Philippine\u2013American War]]. He surrendered in August 6, 1907 to American authorities and was sentenced to death.

The evenings include events such as awards ceremonies, the annual Masquerade costume contest, and the Comic-Con International Independent Film Festival, which showcases shorts and feature-length movies that do not have distribution or distribution deals.\n\nTraditional events include an eclectic film program, screening rooms devoted to [[Japanese animation]], gaming, programs such as cartoonist [[Scott Shaw (artist)|Scott Shaw!]]'s \"Oddball Comics\" slide show, Quick Draw! hosted by [[Mark Evanier]] with Shaw!, [[Sergio Aragones]] and a guest cartoonist responding to improvisational prompts and games (a la ''[[Whose Line Is It Anyway?]]'') and animation expert [[Jerry Beck]]'s program featuring TV's \"worst cartoons ever\", as well as over 350 hours of other programming on all aspects of comic books and pop culture.\n\nLike most comic book conventions, Comic-Con features a large floorspace for exhibitors. These include media companies such as [[movie studio]]s and TV networks, as well as comic-book dealers and [[collectibles]] merchants. And like most comics conventions, Comic-Con includes an autograph area, as well as the Artists' Alley where comics artists can sign autographs and sell or do free sketches. Despite the name, artists' alleys can include writers and even models.\n\nAcademics and comic industry professionals annually hold the [[Comics Arts Conference]] at Comic-Con, presenting scholarly studies on comics as a medium.\n\nIn recent years, the number of television shows that are promoted far outnumber films.

Inside the convention center, which requires a badge to visit during the convention, includes artists alley and the main exhibitor hall. Artist Alley is for up and coming artists who are new to the pop culture world by selling their new books, comics, toys, and or services. They range from local companies and businesses in Southern California to international ones, but are mainly private endeavors. Artist Alley is usually located in Hall G of the convention center. Spaces for these exhibitors are highly sought after and are on a lottery and need-based system.<ref>https://www.comic-con.org/cci/2018/exhibitors</ref>\n\nThe main exhibit hall, which includes larger well-recognized companies, takes up halls F through A. These companies sell or promote new and up comping movies, television shows, and video games as well as featuring toys and exclusives with many selling for hundreds or even thousands on the secondary markets outside the convention. Some notable recurring companies include [[Lego]], [[Hasbro]], [[Funko]], [[Hallmark Cards]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Cartoon Network]], [[The Walt Disney Company]], and [[Blizzard Entertainment]].\n\n===Off site===\nThe other type of exhibitors include offsite exhibitors, booths and events which are located outside the convention center. These locations are usually within walking distance of the convention center but have been moving into nearby parks in recent years. Some notable examples include [[Gaslamp Quarter, San Diego]], [[Petco Park]], and [[Children's Park (San Diego)]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Carr |first=Stephanie |date=July 23, 2018 |title=Get an inside look at some of Comic-Con's lesser-known activities |url=https://www.kshb.com/entertainment/get-an-inside-look-at-some-of-comic-cons-lesser-known-activities |work=KSHB |location=Kansas City |access-date=July 26, 2018 }}<br/>{{cite news |last=Alvarez |first=Elizabeth |date=July 21, 2018 |title=Comic-Con Day 3: A look at the fans and events outside the convention center |url=https://www.kusi.com/comic-con-day-3-a-look-at-the-fans-and-events-outside-the-convention-center/ |work=KUSI |location=San Diego |access-date=July 26, 2018 }}</ref> In recent years, these offsite events have no connection to SDCC.<ref>{{cite news |last=Batcha |first=Sarah |date=July 17, 2018 |title=18 San Diego Comic-Con 2018 events you can enjoy without buying a badge |url=https://www.ocregister.com/2018/06/28/18-san-diego-comic-con-2018-events-you-can-enjoy-without-buying-a-badge/ |work= Orange County Register |access-date=July 26, 2018 }}</ref> In the past, most sites have not required a Comic-Con badge.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gaslamp.org/2018/07/no-badge-required-comic-con-events-specials-gaslamp-quarter/ |title=No Badge Required Comic-Con Events and Specials in the Gaslmap Quarter! |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=July 2018 |website=Gaslamp.org |publisher=Gaslamp Quarter Association |access-date=August 4, 2018}}<br/>{{cite magazine |last=Scheinbaum |first=Chase |date=July 14, 2018 |title=4 Fun Things to Do at Comic-Con 2018, No Badge Required |url=http://www.sandiegomagazine.com/Blogs/Cityfiles/Summer-2018/4-Fun-Things-to-Do-at-Comic-Con-2018-No-Badge-Required/ |magazine=San Diego Magazine |publisher= |access-date=August 4, 2018 }}</ref> In 2017, one example was a virtual reality and immersive set based on the movie ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Yamato |first=Jen |date=July 20, 2017 |title=Are you a replicant?

Nevertheless, the 2007 show went on to sell out Saturday, as well as Friday and Sunday for the first time. Additionally, both the four-day and three-day memberships sold out for the first time.

Inside the convention center, which requires a badge to visit during the convention, includes artists alley and the main exhibitor hall. Artist Alley is for up and coming artists who are new to the pop culture world by selling their new books, comics, toys, and or services. They range from local companies and businesses in Southern California to international ones, but are mainly private endeavors. Artist Alley is usually located in Hall G of the convention center. Spaces for these exhibitors are highly sought after and are on a lottery and need-based system.<ref>https://www.comic-con.org/cci/2018/exhibitors</ref>\n\nThe main exhibit hall, which includes larger well-recognized companies, takes up halls F through A. These companies sell or promote new and up comping movies, television shows, and video games as well as featuring toys and exclusives with many selling for hundreds or even thousands on the secondary markets outside the convention. Some notable recurring companies include [[Lego]], [[Hasbro]], [[Funko]], [[Hallmark Cards]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Cartoon Network]], [[The Walt Disney Company]], and [[Blizzard Entertainment]].\n\n===Off site===\nThe other type of exhibitors include offsite exhibitors, booths and events which are located outside the convention center. These locations are usually within walking distance of the convention center but have been moving into nearby parks in recent years. Some notable examples include [[Gaslamp Quarter, San Diego]], [[Petco Park]], and [[Children's Park (San Diego)]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Carr |first=Stephanie |date=July 23, 2018 |title=Get an inside look at some of Comic-Con's lesser-known activities |url=https://www.kshb.com/entertainment/get-an-inside-look-at-some-of-comic-cons-lesser-known-activities |work=KSHB |location=Kansas City |access-date=July 26, 2018 }}<br/>{{cite news |last=Alvarez |first=Elizabeth |date=July 21, 2018 |title=Comic-Con Day 3: A look at the fans and events outside the convention center |url=https://www.kusi.com/comic-con-day-3-a-look-at-the-fans-and-events-outside-the-convention-center/ |work=KUSI |location=San Diego |access-date=July 26, 2018 }}</ref> In recent years, these offsite events have no connection to SDCC.<ref>{{cite news |last=Batcha |first=Sarah |date=July 17, 2018 |title=18 San Diego Comic-Con 2018 events you can enjoy without buying a badge |url=https://www.ocregister.com/2018/06/28/18-san-diego-comic-con-2018-events-you-can-enjoy-without-buying-a-badge/ |work= Orange County Register |access-date=July 26, 2018 }}</ref> In the past, most sites have not required a Comic-Con badge.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gaslamp.org/2018/07/no-badge-required-comic-con-events-specials-gaslamp-quarter/ |title=No Badge Required Comic-Con Events and Specials in the Gaslmap Quarter! |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=July 2018 |website=Gaslamp.org |publisher=Gaslamp Quarter Association |access-date=August 4, 2018}}<br/>{{cite magazine |last=Scheinbaum |first=Chase |date=July 14, 2018 |title=4 Fun Things to Do at Comic-Con 2018, No Badge Required |url=http://www.sandiegomagazine.com/Blogs/Cityfiles/Summer-2018/4-Fun-Things-to-Do-at-Comic-Con-2018-No-Badge-Required/ |magazine=San Diego Magazine |publisher= |access-date=August 4, 2018 }}</ref> In 2017, one example was a virtual reality and immersive set based on the movie ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Yamato |first=Jen |date=July 20, 2017 |title=Are you a replicant?

This season was announced in its entirety on radio by Ted Darling, and for seven games on television by then-unknown [[Dave Hodge]], who the next year left to become the host of ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]''.\n\nJeanneret worked alongside [[Jim Lorentz]] for over 20 years before Lorentz retired.

The game was said to have taken place at [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium]], classic Sabres audio clips were played during intermission, and WNSA purposely held out any regular game staff from the commentary who had actually played on the 1974\u201375 team so as to make it seem as if they were actually playing the game.

Jeanneret called 47 games in 2014\u201315 and called 41 games in 2015\u201316; as of 2014, he still intended on retiring in 2016 but did not entirely rule out changing his mind.<ref>http://www.buffalonews.com/columns/alan-pergament/rick-jeanneret-on-cancer-criticism-and-why-you-never-heard-him-talk-about-tanking-20150424</ref> Indeed, Jeanneret would sign an agreement to call another half-season of games in 2016\u201317.<ref>http://talkintv.buffalonews.com/2015/09/25/jeanneret-to-return-for-2016-17-season-as-sabres-change-retirement-plans/</ref>\n\nOn July 1, 2014, Jeanneret was diagnosed with stage 3 throat cancer, which required Jeanneret to miss part of the [[2014-15 NHL season]]. Although he initially sought treatment in his native Canada due to [[Medicare (Canada)|Canada's universal single-payer health care system]], he later sought American treatment (coincidentally, from the same doctor that also treated Buffalo Bills quarterback [[Jim Kelly]]) due to his stronger personal attachment with the United States after four decades of work in the country.<ref name=perg10514/> On November 7, 2014 Jeanneret announced that following a CAT scan he was clear of cancer.<ref>http://video.sabres.nhl.com/videocenter/console?id=665399</ref> He returned to broadcasting Sabres games eight days later on Saturday, November 15, calling the first period of the game against the Maple Leafs.<ref>{{citeweb| url=http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/news/sabres-rick-jeanneret-to-return-to-broadcast-booth-after-beating-cancer/ | title=Sabres' Rick Jeanneret to Return to Broadcast Booth After Beating Cancer | publisher=CBS Sports | date = November 14, 2014 | accessdate = June 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2018, Jeanneret said that he was leaning toward returning for the 2018-19 season, but he was not certain because of his age and possible health complications (in addition to the cancer battle, he also had a pacemaker installed).<ref>{{cite news|first=Alan|last=Pergament|title=Jeanneret, Dunleavy weighing broadcasting futures with Sabres|url=http://buffalonews.com/2018/04/04/jeanneret-dunleavy-weighing-broadcasting-futures-with-sabres/|work=The Buffalo News|date=April 4, 2018|accessdate=April 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nJeanneret appeared in a commercial for [[Molson Canadian]], giving a call for a pick-up pond hockey game.\n\nJeanneret is the play-by-play announcer for ICE's [[Super Chexx]] arcade machines.\n\nOn December 22, 2018, during the third period in a home game against the [[Anaheim Ducks]], Jeanneret suffered an acute medical emergency and abruptly cut out of the broadcast, leaving color commentator [[Rob Ray]] and on-site studio host Brian Duff to call play-by-play for the remainder of the game.  Almost immediately, fans watching the broadcast or listening to the game took to the Sabres' Twitter page, expressing worry and concern for Jeanneret and asking for updates. Eyewitnesses noticed Jeanneret being escorted out of the arena on a stretcher.  [[Buffalo News]] sports commentator Mike Harrington, who was at the game, tweeted about seeing the situation unfold, prompting hundreds of further tweets from fans at the Sabres' page. Jeanneret had shown no signs of illness immediately prior to the game.<ref>[https://www.wgrz.com/article/sports/rick-jeanneret-leaves-sabres-broadcast-unannounced/71-65d488ee-1f10-4685-962c-c7ca4e893420 Rick Jeanneret leaves Sabres broadcast unannounced].

The game was said to have taken place at [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium]], classic Sabres audio clips were played during intermission, and WNSA purposely held out any regular game staff from the commentary who had actually played on the 1974\u201375 team so as to make it seem as if they were actually playing the game. (For instance, color commentator [[Jim Lorentz]] was replaced by [[Mike Robitaille]], who played for the Sabres in 1974\u201375 but had been traded before the playoffs, and WNSA hosts filled in other positions.) The 1975 team won the game thanks to [[Gilbert Perreault]]'s game winning shootout goal.[http://www.staffannouncer.com/airchecks.htm]\n\nIn all actuality, many of the members of the 1974\u201375 squad are still together, working for the Sabres organization and playing occasionally for the [[Buffalo Sabres Alumni Hockey Team]].\n\n==Awards and accolades==\nJeanneret, along with former Sabre [[Dale Hawerchuk]] were inducted into the Buffalo Sabres Hall of Fame on November 8, 2011.<ref>http://sabres.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=587544&navid=DL|BUF|home</ref>\n\nOn June 6, 2012, the Sabres announced that Jeanneret would be inducted into the Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame.<ref>http://sabres.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=633992</ref>\n\nOn June 8, 2012, the Sabres announced that Jeanneret would be given the [[Foster Hewitt Memorial Award]] and thus be inducted into the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]].
