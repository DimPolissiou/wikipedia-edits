{"title_page": "Banjjogi", "text_new": "''Banjjogi'' is a [[Korean]] [[Folklore genre|folk tale]] that tells the story of the eponymous protagonist who is born with only half a body, but goes on to overcome his disability, using his strength and cunning to defeat a tiger and a greedy man, marry the greedy man\u2019s daughter, and prosper. Various names for the protagonist include ''banjjogi'', ''oejjogi'' and ''oejjagi''.\n\n== History and Transmission ==\nThis tale is not found in documentary records of stories pre-dating Korea\u2019s late-19th-century Enlightenment Period. Today, the earliest known [[Woodblock printing#Early printed books in China and Korea|woodblock-printed]] edition of the story is ''Banjjok saram'' (\ubc18\ucabd \uc0ac\ub78c The Half Person), which appears in [[Sim Ui-rin]]\u2019s 1926 work ''Joseon donghwa daejip'' (\uc870\uc120\ub3d9\ud654\ub300\uc9d1 Grand Collection of Korean Children\u2019s Stories).

One day, a monk came and the wife made a donation to him. The monk gave her three cucumbers, saying that if she ate them she would have three sons. She ate two of the cucumbers, then shared the third one with her husband. The wife later gave birth to three children, but the youngest was born with only half a body. Their father, who was a hunter, was killed by a tiger while hunting. At this, the three boys went out to hunt the tiger and avenge their father, despite their mother\u2019s protests. Banjjogi tried to go with his older brothers, but they tied him to a tree and left him behind.\n\nBanjjogi pulled up the tree to which he was tied, took it home, and told his mother that his brothers had told him to do so. Next time, his brothers tied him to a rock. But Banjjogi carried the rock home, too. Eventually, all three brothers went off hunting together. When they reached the beginning of the gorge where the tiger lived, they stopped for the night at the home of an old woman known as Patjuk. Patjuk told them that the tiger caught and ate hunters by transforming into a woman. She also told the boys how they could catch the tiger. Banjjogi did as she had instructed, catching the tiger, recovering his father\u2019s remains and bringing them back along with the tiger\u2019s skin. Then, the old woman told him that his mother was going to be eaten by a tiger, so he packed his belongs and set off again. He caught the tiger and saved his mother\u2019s life.\n\nMeanwhile, the tiger skin caught the eye of the rich man who lived down the road. He made a bet with Banjjogi: If Banjjogi could make off with the rich man\u2019s daughter, the rich man would let him marry her. If he failed, he would have to give the rich man the tiger skin. The rich man then rounded up all the villagers and made them guard his house. But Banjjogi stole his way into the rich man\u2019s house, hung the man guarding the house to the doorframe by his topknot, painted sulfur on the rich man\u2019s beard, and put a drumstick in the man\u2019s wife\u2019s hand. Then he put the man\u2019s daughter on his back and set off again, shouting. Everyone was taken by surprise and chaos ensued. The rich man\u2019s beard caught fire. Banjjogi married the rich man\u2019s daughter and went on to prosper.\n\n=== Variations ===\nThe key elements of ''Banjjogi'' are the protagonist\u2019s extraordinary birth, the bullying he suffers from his brothers, the extermination of tigers, his bet with the rich man, and his marriage. Some versions of the story omit birth-related motifs or tiger extermination. In some cases, Banjjogi kills tigers by way of a bet; in others, his main achievement is not killing tigers but saving his brothers. Some versions of the story end with Banjjogi becoming a rich man by hunting tigers, while others end with him getting married. The food eaten by Banjjogi\u2019s mother in order to conceive her children varies from version to version, with examples including daikon radishes, cucumbers, fish, peaches and nuts.\n\n== Features and Significance ==\nThe core element in the tale of Banjjogi is the strange birth of its protagonist with the physical characteristic of having only half a body. And the way he eliminates obstacles through his own strength and cunning, in spite of his physical limitations and the unkindness and scorn of those around him makes Banjjogi a typical folktale character. Meanwhile, his extraordinary birth and superhuman abilities are both transcendental, extraordinary qualities that allow Banjjogi to be understood as a mythical character.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/en/topic/detail/5823|title=Halfie|last=\uad6d\ub9bd\ubbfc\uc18d\ubc15\ubb3c\uad00|website=Encyclopedia of Korean Folk Culture|language=ko|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> Some interpret Banjjogi\u2019s incomplete body as a caricature of the abilities of a divine being, making it a modification of the motif of his extraordinary birth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?cid=46643&docId=3559178&categoryId=46643|title=\ubc18\ucabd\uc774\uc124\ud654|website=terms.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>\n\nThe tale of Banjjogi generally proceeds through four narrative stages. First, Banjjogi\u2019s mother eats food that makes her conceive him, then gives birth to him. In the second stage, Banjjogi is bullied by his brothers because of his physical deficiencies. In stage three, he uses his own strength to overcome his brothers\u2019 scorn, hunt the tiger, and prospers. In the fourth and final stage, Banjjogi wins the bet about making off with the rich man\u2019s daughter, and marries her. Various versions show differences in narrative composition. Some include illustrations of formidable archery skills, similar to elements found in ''Kkul gangaji'' (\uafc0 \uac15\uc544\uc9c0 Honey Dog), ''Agi jangsu seolhwa'' (\uc544\uae30\uc7a5\uc218\uc124\ud654 The Tale of the Young General), and the stories of [[Jumong]] and [[King Yuri]].

On the night of their marriage, Scheherazade begins to tell the king a tale, but does not end it. The king, curious about how the story ends, is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins another one, and the king, eager to hear the conclusion of that tale as well, postpones her execution once again. This goes on for one thousand and one nights, hence the name.\n\nThe tales vary widely: they include historical tales, love stories, tragedies, comedies, poems, [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesques]], and various forms of [[erotica]]. Numerous stories depict [[jinn]]s, [[ghoul]]s, [[ape]]s,<ref>[http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/arabian/bl-arabian-3sindbad.htm The Third Voyage of Sindbad the Seaman \u2013 The Arabian Nights \u2013 The Thousand and One Nights \u2013 Sir Richard Burton translator].

Common [[protagonist]]s include the historical [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]], his [[Grand Vizier]], [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Jafar al-Barmaki]], and the famous poet [[Abu Nuwas]], despite the fact that these figures lived some 200 years after the fall of the [[Sassanid Empire]], in which the frame tale of Scheherazade is set. Sometimes a character in Scheherazade's tale will begin telling other characters a story of his own, and that story may have another one told within it, resulting in a richly layered narrative texture.\n\nThe different versions have different individually detailed endings (in some Scheherazade asks for a pardon, in some the king sees their children and decides not to execute his wife, in some other things happen that make the king distracted) but they all end with the king giving his wife a pardon and sparing her life.\n\nThe narrator's standards for what constitutes a [[cliffhanger]] seem broader than in modern literature. While in many cases a story is cut off with the hero in danger of losing his life or another kind of deep trouble, in some parts of the full text Scheherazade stops her narration in the middle of an exposition of abstract philosophical principles or complex points of [[Islamic philosophy]], and in one case during a detailed description of [[Medicine in medieval Islam#Human anatomy and physiology|human anatomy]] according to [[Galen]]\u2014and in all of these cases she turns out to be justified in her belief that the king's curiosity about the sequel would buy her another day of life.\n\n==History: versions and translations==\nThe history of the ''Nights'' is extremely complex and modern scholars have made many attempts to untangle the story of how the collection as it currently exists came about. [[Robert Irwin (writer)|Robert Irwin]] summarises their findings:\n\n{{quote|In the 1880s and 1890s a lot of work was done on the ''Nights'' by [[Hermann Zotenberg|Zotenberg]] and others, in the course of which a consensus view of the history of the text emerged. Most scholars agreed that the Nights was a composite work and that the earliest tales in it came from [[India]] and [[Persia]]. At some time, probably in the early 8th century, these tales were translated into Arabic under the title ''Alf Layla'', or 'The Thousand Nights'. This collection then formed the basis of ''The Thousand and One Nights''. The original core of stories was quite small. Then, in Iraq in the 9th or 10th century, this original core had Arab stories added to it\u2014among them some tales about the [[Caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]]. Also, perhaps from the 10th century onwards, previously independent sagas and story cycles were added to the compilation [...] Then, from the 13th century onwards, a further layer of stories was added in Syria and Egypt, many of these showing a preoccupation with sex, magic or low life. In the early modern period yet more stories were added to the Egyptian collections so as to swell the bulk of the text sufficiently to bring its length up to the full 1,001 nights of storytelling promised by the book's title.<ref>Irwin p. 48</ref>}}\n\n===Possible Indian influence===\nDevices found in Sanskrit literature such as frame stories and animal fables are seen by some scholars as lying at the root of the conception of the ''Nights''.<ref name=\"Reynolds p.271\">Reynolds p. 271</ref> The motif of the wise young woman who delays and finally removes an impending danger by telling stories has been traced back to Indian sources.<ref name=EI2/> Indian folklore is represented in the ''Nights'' by certain animal stories, which reflect influence from ancient [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit fables]].

One such cycle of Arabic tales centres around a small group of historical figures from 9th-century Baghdad, including the caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] (died 809), his vizier [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Jafar al-Barmaki]] (d. 803) and the licentious poet [[Abu Nuwas]] (d. c. 813). Another cluster is a body of stories from late medieval Cairo in which are mentioned persons and places that date to as late as the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.<ref name=\"Reynolds p.270\">Reynolds p. 270</ref>}}\n\nTwo main Arabic manuscript traditions of the Nights are known: the Syrian and the Egyptian. The Syrian tradition is primarily represented by the earliest extensive manuscript of the ''Nights'', a fourteenth- or fifteenth-century Syrian manuscript now known as the [[Galland Manuscript]]. It and surviving copies of it are much shorter and include fewer tales than the Egyptian tradition. It is represented in print by the so-called ''Calcutta I'' (1814\u20131818) and most notably by the 'Leiden edition' (1984).<ref name=beaustyle>Beaumont, Daniel.

It is debated which of the Arabic recensions is more \"authentic\" and closer to the original: the Egyptian ones have been modified more extensively and more recently, and scholars such as [[Muhsin Mahdi]] have suspected that this may have been caused in part by European demand for a \"complete version\"; but it appears that this type of modification has been common throughout the history of the collection, and independent tales have always been added to it.<ref name=\"sallis\" /><ref>Pinault, David.

It contained an Egyptian version of ''The Nights'' known as \"ZER\" ([[Hermann Zotenberg|Zotenberg]]'s Egyptian [[Recension]]) and 200 tales. No copy of this edition survives, but it was the basis for an 1835 edition by Bulaq, published by the Egyptian government.\n\nThe ''Nights'' were next printed in Arabic in two volumes in Calcutta by the [[British East India Company]] in 1814\u201318. Each volume contained one hundred tales.\n\nSoon after, the Prussian scholar Christian Maximilian Habicht collaborated with the Tunisian Mordecai ibn al-Najjar to create an edition containing 1001 nights both in the original Arabic and in German translation, initially in a series of eight volumes published in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau]] in 1825\u20131838. A further four volumes followed in 1842\u20131843. In addition to the Galland manuscript, Habicht and al-Najjar used what they believed to be a Tunisian manuscript, which was later revealed as a forgery by al-Najjar.<ref name=\"Marzolph, Ulrich 2017\" />\n\nBoth the ZER printing and Habicht and al-Najjar's edition influenced the next printing, a four-volume edition also from Calcutta (known as the ''Macnaghten'' or ''Calcutta II'' edition). This claimed to be based on an older Egyptian manuscript (which has never been found).\n\nA major recent edition, which reverts to the [[Syria]]n recension, is a critical edition based on the fourteenth- or fifteenth-century [[Syria]]n manuscript in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]] originally used by Galland. This edition, known as the Leiden text, was compiled in Arabic by [[Muhsin Mahdi]] (1984-1994).<ref>''The Thousand and One Nights (Alf layla wa-layla), from the Earliest Known Sources'', ed. by Muhsin Mahdi, 3 vols (Leiden: Brill, 1984-1994), {{ISBN|9004074287}}.</ref> Mahdi argued that this version is the earliest extant one (a view that is largely accepted today) and that it reflects most closely a \"definitive\" coherent text ancestral to all others that he believed to have existed during the [[Mamluk]] period (a view that remains contentious).<ref name=\"sallis\" /><ref>Madeleine Dobie, 2009.

This 12-volume work, ''[[Les mille et une nuits|Les Mille et une nuits, contes arabes traduits en fran\u00e7ais]]'' (\"The Thousand and one nights, Arab stories translated into French\"), included stories that were not in the original Arabic manuscript. \"Aladdin's Lamp\", and \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\" (as well as several other lesser-known tales) appeared first in Galland's translation and cannot be found in any of the original manuscripts. He wrote that he heard them from a [[Christianity in Syria|Syrian Christian]] storyteller from [[Aleppo]], a [[Maronite]] scholar whom he called [[Hanna Diyab|\n\"Hanna Diab.\"]] Galland's version of the ''Nights'' was immensely popular throughout Europe, and later versions were issued by Galland's publisher using Galland's name without his consent.\n\nAs scholars were looking for the presumed \"complete\" and \"original\" form of the Nights, they naturally turned to the more voluminous texts of the Egyptian recension, which soon came to be viewed as the \"standard version\". The first translations of this kind, such as that of [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]] (1840, 1859), were [[bowdlerized]]. Unabridged and unexpurgated translations were made, first by [[John Payne (poet)|John Payne]], under the title ''The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night'' (1882, nine volumes), and then by [[Sir Richard Francis Burton]], entitled ''[[The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night]]'' (1885, ten volumes)&nbsp;\u2013 the latter was, according to some assessments, partially based on the former, leading to charges of [[plagiarism]].<ref name=sallis2/><ref name=encyclo>Marzolph, Ulrich and Richard van Leeuwen. 2004.

Burton's original 10 volumes were followed by a further six (seven in the Baghdad Edition and perhaps others) entitled ''The Supplemental Nights to the Thousand Nights and a Night'', which were printed between 1886 and 1888.  It has, however, been criticized for its \"archaic language and extravagant idiom\" and \"obsessive focus on sexuality\" (and has even been called an \"eccentric [[wikt:ego-trip|ego-trip]]\" and a \"highly personal reworking of the text\").<ref name=encyclo/>\n\nLater versions of the ''Nights'' include that of the [[French people|French]] doctor [[J. C. Mardrus]], issued from 1898 to 1904. It was translated into English by [[Powys Mathers]], and issued in 1923. Like Payne's and Burton's texts, it is based on the Egyptian recension and retains the erotic material, indeed expanding on it, but it has been criticized for inaccuracy.<ref name=sallis2>Sallis, Eva. 1999.

It contains, in addition to the standard text of 1001 Nights, the so-called \"orphan stories\" of ''[[Aladdin]]'' and ''[[Ali Baba]]'' as well as an alternative ending to ''The seventh journey of [[Sindbad]]'' from [[Antoine Galland]]'s original French. As the translator himself notes in his preface to the three volumes, \"[N]o attempt has been made to superimpose on the translation changes that would be needed to 'rectify' ... accretions, ... repetitions, non sequiturs and confusions that mark the present text,\" and the work is a \"representation of what is primarily oral literature, appealing to the ear rather than the eye\".<ref>[http://www.pen.org/blog/?p=4056 PEN American Center].

Many of Scheherazade's tales are themselves frame stories, such as the ''[[Sinbad the Sailor|Tale of Sinbad the Seaman and Sinbad the Landsman]]'', which is a collection of adventures related by Sinbad the Seaman to Sinbad the Landsman.\n\n===Embedded narrative===\nAn early example of the \"[[story within a story]]\" technique can be found in the ''One Thousand and One Nights'', which can be traced back to earlier Persian and Indian storytelling traditions, most notably the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' of ancient [[Sanskrit literature]]. The ''Nights'', however, improved on the ''Panchatantra'' in several ways, particularly in the way a story is introduced. In the ''Panchatantra'', stories are introduced as [[Didacticism|didactic]] analogies, with the frame story referring to these stories with variants of the phrase \"If you're not careful, that which happened to the louse and the flea will happen to you.\" In the ''Nights'', this didactic framework is the least common way of introducing the story, but instead, a story is most commonly introduced through subtle means, particularly as an answer to questions raised in a previous tale.<ref>{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|pages=3\u20134}}</ref>\n\nThe general story is narrated by an unknown narrator, and in this narration the stories are told by [[Scheherazade]]. In most of Scheherazade's narrations there are also stories narrated, and even in some of these, there are some other stories.<ref>{{Citation\n | last=Burton\n | first=Richard\n | authorlink=Richard Francis Burton\n | title=The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night, Volume 1\n | publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]\n |date=September 2003\n | location=\n | pages=\n | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/11001108.txt\n | doi=\n | id=}}</ref> This is particularly the case for the \"[[Sinbad the Sailor]]\" story narrated by Scheherazade in the ''One Thousand and One Nights''. Within the \"Sinbad the Sailor\" story itself, the protagonist Sinbad the Sailor narrates the stories of his seven voyages to Sinbad the Porter. The device is also used to great effect in stories such as \"[[The Three Apples]]\" and \"[[#Unreliable narrator|The Seven Viziers]]\". In yet another tale Scheherazade narrates, \"[[The Fisherman and the Jinni]]\", the \"Tale of the Wazir and the Sage [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Duban|Duban]]\" is narrated within it, and within that there are three more tales narrated.\n\n===Dramatic visualization===\nDramatic visualization is \"the representing of an object or character with an abundance of descriptive detail, or the mimetic rendering of gestures and dialogue in such a way as to make a given scene 'visual' or imaginatively present to an audience\". This technique is used in several tales of the ''One Thousand and One Nights''.<ref name=Heath-360/> An example of this is the tale of \"The Three Apples\" (see [[#Crime fiction elements|Crime fiction elements]] below).\n\n===Fate and destiny===\nA common [[Theme (literature)|theme]] in many ''Arabian Nights'' tales is [[wikt:fate|fate]] and [[destiny]]. The [[Italian people|Italian]] filmmaker [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] observed:<ref>{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B.

So a chain of anomalies is set up. And the more logical, tightly knit, essential this chain is, the more beautiful the tale. By 'beautiful' I mean vital, absorbing and exhilarating. The chain of anomalies always tends to lead back to normality. The end of every tale in ''The One Thousand and One Nights'' consists of a 'disappearance' of destiny, which sinks back to the [[somnolence]] of daily life ... The protagonist of the stories is in fact destiny itself.}}\n\nThough invisible, fate may be considered a leading character in the ''One Thousand and One Nights''.<ref>{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B.

This technique is also found in ''One Thousand and One Nights''.<ref name=Heath-360/>\n\nAnother form of foreshadowing is the [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], which dates back to the story of [[Krishna]] in ancient [[Sanskrit literature]], and [[Oedipus]] or the death of [[Heracles]] in the plays of [[Sophocles]]. A variation of this device is the self-fulfilling dream, which can be found in [[Arabic literature]] (or the dreams of Joseph and his conflicts with his brothers, in the [[Book of Genesis|Hebrew Bible]]). Several tales in the ''One Thousand and One Nights'' use this device to foreshadow what is going to happen, as a special form of literary [[Foreshadowing|prolepsis]]. A notable example is \"The Ruined Man who Became Rich Again through a Dream\", in which a man is told in his dream to leave his native city of [[Baghdad]] and travel to [[Cairo]], where he will discover the whereabouts of some hidden treasure. The man travels there and experiences misfortune, ending up in jail, where he tells his dream to a police officer. The officer mocks the idea of foreboding dreams and tells the protagonist that he himself had a dream about a house with a courtyard and fountain in Baghdad where treasure is buried under the fountain. The man recognizes the place as his own house and, after he is released from jail, he returns home and digs up the treasure. In other words, the foreboding dream not only predicted the future, but the dream was the cause of its prediction coming true. A variant of this story later appears in [[English folklore]] as the \"[[Pedlar of Swaffham]]\" and [[Paulo Coelho]]'s \"[[The Alchemist (novel)|The Alchemist]]\"; [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' collection of short stories ''[[A Universal History of Infamy]]'' featured his translation of this particular story into Spanish, as \"The Story Of The Two Dreamers.\"<ref>{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Palang-faacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|pages=193\u201394}}</ref>\n\nAnother variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy can be seen in \"The Tale of Attaf\", where [[Harun al-Rashid]] consults his library (the [[House of Wisdom]]), reads a random book, \"falls to laughing and weeping and dismisses the faithful ''[[vizier]]'' [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] from sight. Ja'afar, \"disturbed and upset flees Baghdad and plunges into a series of adventures in [[Damascus]], involving Attaf and the woman whom Attaf eventually marries.\" After returning to Baghdad, Ja'afar reads the same book that caused Harun to laugh and weep, and discovers that it describes his own adventures with Attaf. In other words, it was Harun's reading of the book that provoked the adventures described in the book to take place.

In one tale, \"The Seven Viziers\" (also known as \"Craft and Malice of Women or The Tale of the King, His Son, His Concubine and the Seven Wazirs\"), a [[courtesan]] accuses a king's son of having assaulted her, when in reality she had failed to seduce him (inspired by the [[Qur'an]]ic/[[Bible|Biblical]] story of [[Islamic view of Joseph|Yusuf]]/[[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]). Seven [[vizier]]s attempt to save his life by narrating seven stories to prove the unreliability of women, and the courtesan responds by narrating a story to prove the unreliability of viziers.<ref>{{citation|title=Story-telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|page=59}}</ref> The unreliable narrator device is also used to generate [[suspense]] in \"The Three Apples\" and [[humor]] in \"The Hunchback's Tale\" (see [[#Crime fiction elements|Crime fiction elements]] below).\n\n===Crime fiction elements===\n[[File:Godefroy Durand - Morgiane.jpg|thumb|Illustration depicting [[Morgiana (character)|Morgiana]] and the thieves from ''[[Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]''.]]\nAn example of the [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]]<ref>{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240\u201342}}</ref> and [[Thriller (genre)|suspense thriller]] genres in the collection, with multiple [[plot twist]]s<ref>{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=Brill|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=93, 95, 97}}</ref> and [[detective fiction]] elements<ref>{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=91, 93}}</ref> was \"[[The Three Apples]]\", also known as ''Hikayat al-sabiyya 'l-maqtula'' (\"The Tale of the Murdered Young Woman\").<ref>{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|page=240}}</ref>\n\nIn this tale, [[Harun al-Rashid]] comes to possess a chest, which, when opened, contains the body of a young woman. Harun gives his vizier, [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Ja'far]], three days to find the culprit or be executed. At the end of three days, when Ja'far is about to be executed for his failure, two men come forward, both claiming to be the murderer. As they tell their story it transpires that, although the younger of them, the woman's husband, was responsible for her death, some of the blame attaches to a slave, who had taken one of the apples mentioned in the title and caused the woman's murder.\n\nHarun then gives Ja'far three more days to find the guilty slave. When he yet again fails to find the culprit, and bids his family goodbye before his execution, he discovers by chance his daughter has the apple, which she obtained from Ja'far's own slave, Rayhan.  Thus the mystery is solved.\n\nAnother ''Nights'' tale with [[crime fiction]] elements was \"The Hunchback's Tale\" story cycle which, unlike \"The Three Apples\", was more of a [[suspense]]ful [[comedy]] and [[Legal drama|courtroom drama]] rather than a murder mystery or detective fiction. The story is set in a fictional China and begins with a hunchback, the emperor's favourite [[comedian]], being invited to dinner by a [[tailor]] couple. The hunchback accidentally chokes on his food from laughing too hard and the couple, fearful that the emperor will be furious, take his body to a [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Jewish doctor]]'s [[Bimaristan|clinic]] and leave him there. This leads to the next tale in the cycle, the \"Tale of the Jewish Doctor\", where the doctor accidentally trips over the hunchback's body, falls down the stairs with him, and finds him dead, leading him to believe that the fall had killed him. The doctor then dumps his body down a chimney, and this leads to yet another tale in the cycle, which continues with twelve tales in total, leading to all the people involved in this incident finding themselves in a [[courtroom]], all making [[Unreliable narrator|different claims]] over how the hunchback had died.<ref>{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|pages=2\u20134}}</ref> Crime fiction elements are also present near the end of \"The Tale of Attaf\" (see [[#Foreshadowing|Foreshadowing]] above).\n\n===Horror fiction elements===\n[[Haunting]] is used as a [[plot device]] in [[gothic fiction]] and [[horror fiction]], as well as modern [[paranormal fiction]]. Legends about [[haunted house]]s have long appeared in literature. In particular, the ''Arabian Nights'' tale of \"Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad\" revolves around a house haunted by [[Genie|jinns]].<ref>{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights and Orientalism: Perspectives from East & West|last=Yuriko Yamanaka|first=Tetsuo Nishio|publisher=[[I.B.

A prime example is the story ''The History of Gherib and His Brother Agib'' (from ''Nights'' vol. 6), in which Gherib, an outcast prince, fights off a family of ravenous Ghouls and then enslaves them and converts them to [[Islam]].<ref>{{cite web|title=''The Story of Gherib and his Brother Agib''|work=Thousand Nights and One Night|author=Al-Hakawati|accessdate=October 2, 2008|url=http://www.al-hakawati.net/english/Stories_Tales/laila170.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221142538/http://www.al-hakawati.net/english/Stories_Tales/laila170.asp|archive-date=December 21, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nHorror fiction elements are also found in \"The City of Brass\" tale, which revolves around a [[ghost town]].<ref name=Hamori>{{citation|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00141540|title=An Allegory from the Arabian Nights: The City of Brass|first=Andras|last=Hamori|journal=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies]]|volume=34|issue=1|year=1971|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=9\u201319 [10]}} The hero of the tale is an historical person, [[Musa bin Nusayr]].</ref>\n\nThe horrific nature of [[Scheherazade]]'s situation is magnified in [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]'', in which the protagonist is forced to write a novel to keep his captor from torturing and killing him. The influence of the ''Nights'' on modern horror fiction is certainly discernible in the work of [[H. P. Lovecraft]].

It is often deployed by stories' narrators to provide detailed descriptions, usually of the beauty of characters. Characters also occasionally quote or speak in verse in certain settings. The uses include but are not limited to:\n* Giving advice, warning, and solutions.\n* Praising God, royalties and those in power.\n* Pleading for mercy and forgiveness.\n* Lamenting wrong decisions or bad luck.\n* Providing riddles, laying questions, challenges.\n* Criticizing elements of life, wondering.\n* Expressing feelings to others or one's self: happiness, sadness, anxiety, surprise, anger.\n\nIn a typical example, expressing feelings of happiness to oneself from Night 203, Prince Qamar Al-Zaman, standing outside the castle, wants to inform Queen Bodour of his arrival.<ref>[http://www.mythfolklore.net/1001nights/burton/kamar.htm Burton Nights].

Part of its popularity may have sprung from improved standards of historical and geographical knowledge. The marvelous beings and events typical of fairy tales seem less incredible if they are set further \"long ago\" or farther \"far away\"; this process culminates in the [[fantasy world]] having little connection, if any, to actual times and places. Several elements from [[Arabian mythology]] are now common in modern [[fantasy]], such as [[genie]]s, [[bahamut]]s, [[magic carpet]]s, magic lamps, etc. When [[L. Frank Baum]] proposed writing a modern fairy tale that banished stereotypical elements, he included the genie as well as the dwarf and the fairy as stereotypes to go.<ref>James Thurber, \"The Wizard of Chitenango\", p. 64 ''Fantasists on Fantasy'' edited by Robert H.

It is rarely mentioned in lists of popular literature and few pre-18th-century manuscripts of the collection exist.<ref>Reynolds p. 272</ref> Fiction had a low cultural status among Medieval Arabs compared with poetry, and the tales were dismissed as ''khurafa'' (improbable fantasies fit only for entertaining women and children).

Its stories are regularly denounced as vulgar, improbable, childish and, above all, badly written.\"<ref>Irwin pp. 81\u201382</ref> \n\nNevertheless, the ''Nights'' have proved an inspiration to some modern Egyptian writers, such as [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]] (author of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] play ''Shahrazad'', 1934), [[Taha Hussein]] (''Scheherazade's Dreams'', 1943)<ref name=\"Encyclopaedia Iranica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/alf-layla-wa-layla |title=Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}</ref> and [[Naguib Mahfouz]] (''[[Arabian Nights and Days]]'', 1981). [[Idries Shah]] finds the  [[abjad numerals|Abjad]] numerical equivalent of the Arabic title, ''alf layla wa layla'', in the Arabic phrase ''umm el quissa'', meaning \"mother of records\".

Christian writers in Medieval Spain translated many works from Arabic, mainly philosophy and mathematics, but also Arab fiction, as is evidenced by [[Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena|Juan Manuel]]'s story collection ''[[El Conde Lucanor]]'' and [[Ram\u00f3n Llull]]'s ''The Book of Beasts''.<ref>Irwin pp. 92\u201394</ref> Knowledge of the work, direct or indirect, apparently spread beyond Spain. Themes and motifs with parallels in the ''Nights'' are found in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' (in ''[[The Squire's Tale]]'' the hero travels on a flying brass horse) and [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]]''. Echoes in [[Giovanni Sercambi]]'s ''Novelle'' and [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' suggest that the story of Shahriyar and Shahzaman was also known.<ref>Irwin pp. 96\u201399</ref> Evidence also appears to show that the stories had spread to the [[Balkans]] and a translation of the ''Nights'' into [[Romanian language|Romanian]] existed by the 17th century, itself based on a Greek version of the collection.<ref>Irwin pp. 61\u201362</ref>\n\n===Western literature from the 18th century onwards===\n[[File:CC No 08 Arabian Nights.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Classic Comics]]'' issue #8]]\n\nThe modern fame of the ''Nights'' derives from the first known European translation by Antoine Galland, which appeared in 1704. According to [[Robert Irwin (writer)|Robert Irwin]], Galland \"played so large a part in discovering the tales, in popularizing them in Europe and in shaping what would come to be regarded as the canonical collection that, at some risk of hyperbole and paradox, he has been called the real author of the ''Nights''.\"<ref>Irwin p. 14</ref>  The immediate success of Galland's version with the French public may have been because it coincided with the vogue for ''contes de f\u00e9es'' (\"fairy stories\"). This fashion began with the publication of [[Madame d'Aulnoy]]'s ''Histoire d'Hypolite'' in 1690. D'Aulnoy's book has a remarkably similar structure to the ''Nights'', with the tales told by a female narrator. The success of the ''Nights'' spread across Europe and by the end of the century there were translations of Galland into English, German, Italian, Dutch, Danish, Russian, Flemish and Yiddish.<ref>Reynolds pp. 279\u201381</ref> Galland's version provoked a spate of pseudo-Oriental imitations. At the same time, some French writers began to parody the style and concoct far-fetched stories in superficially Oriental settings. These tongue-in-cheek pastiches include [[Antoine Hamilton|Anthony Hamilton]]'s ''Les quatre Facardins'' (1730), [[Claude Prosper Jolyot de Cr\u00e9billon|Cr\u00e9billon]]'s ''[[The Sofa: A Moral Tale|Le sopha]]'' (1742) and [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]'s ''[[The Indiscreet Jewels|Les bijoux indiscrets]]'' (1748). They often contained veiled allusions to contemporary French society. The most famous example is [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Zadig]]'' (1748), an attack on religious bigotry set against a vague pre-Islamic Middle Eastern background.<ref>Irwin pp. 238\u201341</ref> The English versions of the \"Oriental Tale\" generally contained a heavy moralising element,<ref>Irwin p.242</ref> with the notable exception of [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]]'s fantasy ''[[Vathek]]'' (1786), which had a decisive influence on the development of the [[Gothic novel]]. The Polish nobleman [[Jan Potocki]]'s novel ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa|Saragossa Manuscript]]'' (begun 1797) owes a deep debt to the ''Nights'' with its Oriental flavour and labyrinthine series of embedded tales.<ref>Irwin pp. 245\u201360</ref>\n\nThe work was included on a price-list of books on theology, history, and cartography, which was sent by the Scottish bookseller [[Andrew Millar]] (when an apprentice) to a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister. This is illustrative of the title's widespread popularity and availability in the 1720s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/manuscripts/html_output/6.html|title=The manuscripts, Letter from Andrew Millar to Robert Wodrow, 5 August, 1725.

According to [[A. S. Byatt]], \"In British Romantic poetry the Arabian Nights stood for the wonderful against the mundane, the imaginative against the prosaically and reductively rational.\"<ref>A. S. Byatt ''On Histories and Stories'' (Harvard University Press, 2001) p. 167</ref> In their autobiographical writings, both [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] and [[Thomas de Quincey|de Quincey]] refer to nightmares the book had caused them when young. [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] and [[Alfred Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] also wrote about their childhood reading of the tales in their poetry.<ref>Wordsworth in Book Five of ''[[The Prelude]]''; Tennyson in his poem \"Recollections of the ''Arabian Nights''\". (Irwin, pp. 266\u201369)</ref> [[Charles Dickens]] was another enthusiast and the atmosphere of the ''Nights'' pervades the opening of his last novel ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'' (1870).<ref>Irwin p. 270</ref>\n\nSeveral writers have attempted to add a thousand and second tale,<ref name=\"Byatt p.168\">Byatt p. 168</ref> including [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]] (''La mille deuxi\u00e8me nuit'', 1842)<ref name=\"Encyclopaedia Iranica\"/> and [[Joseph Roth]] (''Die Geschichte von der 1002. Nacht'', 1939).<ref name=\"Byatt p.168\"/> [[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote  \"[[The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Scheherazade]]\" (1845). It depicts the eighth and final voyage of [[Sinbad the Sailor]], along with the various mysteries Sinbad and his crew encounter; the anomalies are then described as footnotes to the story. While the king is uncertain\u2014except in the case of the elephants carrying the world on the back of the turtle\u2014that these mysteries are real, they are actual modern events that occurred in various places during, or before, Poe's lifetime. The story ends with the king in such disgust at the tale Scheherazade has just woven, that he has her executed the very next day.\n\nAnother important literary figure, the [[Ireland|Irish]] poet [[W. B. Yeats]] was also fascinated by the Arabian Nights, when he wrote in his prose book, [[A Vision]] an autobiographical poem, titled The Gift of [[Harun Al-Rashid]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/exhibition/readingeurope/content/ire/NatLibIre_01.pdf|title=The Cat and the Moon and Certain Poems by William Butler Yeats}}</ref> in relation to his joint experiments with his wife [[Georgie Hyde-Lees]], with [[Automatic writing]]. The automatic writing, is a technique used by many occultists in order to discern messages from the subconscious mind or from other spiritual beings, when the hand moves a pencil or a pen, writing only on a simple sheet of paper and when the person's eyes are shut. Also, the gifted and talented wife, is playing in Yeats's poem as \"a gift\" herself, given only allegedly by the caliph to the Christian and Byzantine philosopher [[Qusta ibn Luqa|Qusta Ibn Luqa]], who acts in the poem as a personification of W. B. Yeats. In July 1934 he was asked by Louis Lambert, while in a tour in the United States, which six books satisfied him most. The list that he gave placed the Arabian Nights, secondary only to William Shakespeare's works.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y5GuCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA291&lpg=PA291&dq=Yeats+ethel+mannin+arabian+nights#v=onepage&q=Yeats+ethel+mannin+arabian+nights&f=false|title=In Excited Reverie: Centenary Tribute to W.B.

On the night of their marriage, Scheherazade begins to tell the king a tale, but does not end it. The king, curious about how the story ends, is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins another one, and the king, eager to hear the conclusion of that tale as well, postpones her execution once again. This goes on for one thousand and one nights, hence the name.\n\nThe tales vary widely: they include historical tales, love stories, tragedies, comedies, poems, [[Burlesque (literature)|burlesques]], and various forms of [[erotica]].

Common [[protagonist]]s include the historical [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]], his [[Grand Vizier]], [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Jafar al-Barmaki]], and the famous poet [[Abu Nuwas]], despite the fact that these figures lived some 200 years after the fall of the [[Sassanid Empire]], in which the frame tale of Scheherazade is set. Sometimes a character in Scheherazade's tale will begin telling other characters a story of his own, and that story may have another one told within it, resulting in a richly layered narrative texture.\n\nThe different versions have different individually detailed endings (in some Scheherazade asks for a pardon, in some the king sees their children and decides not to execute his wife, in some other things happen that make the king distracted) but they all end with the king giving his wife a pardon and sparing her life.\n\nThe narrator's standards for what constitutes a [[cliffhanger]] seem broader than in modern literature. While in many cases a story is cut off with the hero in danger of losing his life or another kind of deep trouble, in some parts of the full text Scheherazade stops her narration in the middle of an exposition of abstract philosophical principles or complex points of [[Islamic philosophy]], and in one case during a detailed description of [[Medicine in medieval Islam#Human anatomy and physiology|human anatomy]] according to [[Galen]]\u2014and in all of these cases she turns out to be justified in her belief that the king's curiosity about the sequel would buy her another day of life.\n\n==History: versions and translations==\nThe history of the ''Nights'' is extremely complex and modern scholars have made many attempts to untangle the story of how the collection as it currently exists came about. [[Robert Irwin (writer)|Robert Irwin]] summarises their findings:\n\n{{quote|In the 1880s and 1890s a lot of work was done on the ''Nights'' by [[Hermann Zotenberg|Zotenberg]] and others, in the course of which a consensus view of the history of the text emerged. Most scholars agreed that the Nights was a composite work and that the earliest tales in it came from [[India]] and [[Persia]]. At some time, probably in the early 8th century, these tales were translated into Arabic under the title ''Alf Layla'', or 'The Thousand Nights'. This collection then formed the basis of ''The Thousand and One Nights''. The original core of stories was quite small. Then, in Iraq in the 9th or 10th century, this original core had Arab stories added to it\u2014among them some tales about the [[Caliph]] [[Harun al-Rashid]]. Also, perhaps from the 10th century onwards, previously independent sagas and story cycles were added to the compilation [...] Then, from the 13th century onwards, a further layer of stories was added in Syria and Egypt, many of these showing a preoccupation with sex, magic or low life. In the early modern period yet more stories were added to the Egyptian collections so as to swell the bulk of the text sufficiently to bring its length up to the full 1,001 nights of storytelling promised by the book's title.<ref>Irwin p. 48</ref>}}\n\n===Possible Indian influence===\nDevices found in Sanskrit literature such as frame stories and animal fables are seen by some scholars as lying at the root of the conception of the ''Nights''.<ref name=\"Reynolds p.271\">Reynolds p. 271</ref> The motif of the wise young woman who delays and finally removes an impending danger by telling stories has been traced back to Indian sources.<ref name=EI2/> Indian folklore is represented in the ''Nights'' by certain animal stories, which reflect influence from ancient [[Sanskrit literature|Sanskrit fables]].

One such cycle of Arabic tales centres around a small group of historical figures from 9th-century Baghdad, including the caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] (died 809), his vizier [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Jafar al-Barmaki]] (d. 803) and the licentious poet [[Abu Nuwas]] (d. c. 813). Another cluster is a body of stories from late medieval Cairo in which are mentioned persons and places that date to as late as the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.<ref name=\"Reynolds p.270\">Reynolds p. 270</ref>}}\n\nTwo main Arabic manuscript traditions of the Nights are known: the Syrian and the Egyptian. The Syrian tradition is primarily represented by the earliest extensive manuscript of the ''Nights'', a fourteenth- or fifteenth-century Syrian manuscript now known as the [[Galland Manuscript]]. It and surviving copies of it are much shorter and include fewer tales than the Egyptian tradition.

Each volume contained one hundred tales.\n\nSoon after, the Prussian scholar Christian Maximilian Habicht collaborated with the Tunisian Mordecai ibn al-Najjar to create an edition containing 1001 nights both in the original Arabic and in German translation, initially in a series of eight volumes published in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau]] in 1825\u20131838. A further four volumes followed in 1842\u20131843. In addition to the Galland manuscript, Habicht and al-Najjar used what they believed to be a Tunisian manuscript, which was later revealed as a forgery by al-Najjar.<ref name=\"Marzolph, Ulrich 2017\" />\n\nBoth the ZER printing and Habicht and al-Najjar's edition influenced the next printing, a four-volume edition also from Calcutta (known as the ''Macnaghten'' or ''Calcutta II'' edition). This claimed to be based on an older Egyptian manuscript (which has never been found).\n\nA major recent edition, which reverts to the [[Syria]]n recension, is a critical edition based on the fourteenth- or fifteenth-century [[Syria]]n manuscript in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]] originally used by Galland. This edition, known as the Leiden text, was compiled in Arabic by [[Muhsin Mahdi]] (1984-1994).<ref>''The Thousand and One Nights (Alf layla wa-layla), from the Earliest Known Sources'', ed. by Muhsin Mahdi, 3 vols (Leiden: Brill, 1984-1994), {{ISBN|9004074287}}.</ref> Mahdi argued that this version is the earliest extant one (a view that is largely accepted today) and that it reflects most closely a \"definitive\" coherent text ancestral to all others that he believed to have existed during the [[Mamluk]] period (a view that remains contentious).<ref name=\"sallis\" /><ref>Madeleine Dobie, 2009.

This 12-volume work, ''[[Les mille et une nuits|Les Mille et une nuits, contes arabes traduits en fran\u00e7ais]]'' (\"The Thousand and one nights, Arab stories translated into French\"), included stories that were not in the original Arabic manuscript. \"Aladdin's Lamp\", and \"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves\" (as well as several other lesser-known tales) appeared first in Galland's translation and cannot be found in any of the original manuscripts. He wrote that he heard them from a [[Christianity in Syria|Syrian Christian]] storyteller from [[Aleppo]], a [[Maronite]] scholar whom he called [[Hanna Diyab|\n\"Hanna Diab.\"]] Galland's version of the ''Nights'' was immensely popular throughout Europe, and later versions were issued by Galland's publisher using Galland's name without his consent.\n\nAs scholars were looking for the presumed \"complete\" and \"original\" form of the Nights, they naturally turned to the more voluminous texts of the Egyptian recension, which soon came to be viewed as the \"standard version\". The first translations of this kind, such as that of [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]] (1840, 1859), were [[bowdlerized]]. Unabridged and unexpurgated translations were made, first by [[John Payne (poet)|John Payne]], under the title ''The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night'' (1882, nine volumes), and then by [[Sir Richard Francis Burton]], entitled ''[[The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night]]'' (1885, ten volumes)&nbsp;\u2013 the latter was, according to some assessments, partially based on the former, leading to charges of [[plagiarism]].<ref name=sallis2/><ref name=encyclo>Marzolph, Ulrich and Richard van Leeuwen. 2004.

Burton's original 10 volumes were followed by a further six (seven in the Baghdad Edition and perhaps others) entitled ''The Supplemental Nights to the Thousand Nights and a Night'', which were printed between 1886 and 1888.  It has, however, been criticized for its \"archaic language and extravagant idiom\" and \"obsessive focus on sexuality\" (and has even been called an \"eccentric [[wikt:ego-trip|ego-trip]]\" and a \"highly personal reworking of the text\").<ref name=encyclo/>\n\nLater versions of the ''Nights'' include that of the [[French people|French]] doctor [[J.

As the translator himself notes in his preface to the three volumes, \"[N]o attempt has been made to superimpose on the translation changes that would be needed to 'rectify' ... accretions, ... repetitions, non sequiturs and confusions that mark the present text,\" and the work is a \"representation of what is primarily oral literature, appealing to the ear rather than the eye\".<ref>[http://www.pen.org/blog/?p=4056 PEN American Center].

Many of Scheherazade's tales are themselves frame stories, such as the ''[[Sinbad the Sailor|Tale of Sinbad the Seaman and Sinbad the Landsman]]'', which is a collection of adventures related by Sinbad the Seaman to Sinbad the Landsman.\n\n===Embedded narrative===\nAn early example of the \"[[story within a story]]\" technique can be found in the ''One Thousand and One Nights'', which can be traced back to earlier Persian and Indian storytelling traditions, most notably the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' of ancient [[Sanskrit literature]]. The ''Nights'', however, improved on the ''Panchatantra'' in several ways, particularly in the way a story is introduced. In the ''Panchatantra'', stories are introduced as [[Didacticism|didactic]] analogies, with the frame story referring to these stories with variants of the phrase \"If you're not careful, that which happened to the louse and the flea will happen to you.\" In the ''Nights'', this didactic framework is the least common way of introducing the story, but instead, a story is most commonly introduced through subtle means, particularly as an answer to questions raised in a previous tale.<ref>{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|pages=3\u20134}}</ref>\n\nThe general story is narrated by an unknown narrator, and in this narration the stories are told by [[Scheherazade]]. In most of Scheherazade's narrations there are also stories narrated, and even in some of these, there are some other stories.<ref>{{Citation\n | last=Burton\n | first=Richard\n | authorlink=Richard Francis Burton\n | title=The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night, Volume 1\n | publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]]\n |date=September 2003\n | location=\n | pages=\n | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/11001108.txt\n | doi=\n | id=}}</ref> This is particularly the case for the \"[[Sinbad the Sailor]]\" story narrated by Scheherazade in the ''One Thousand and One Nights''. Within the \"Sinbad the Sailor\" story itself, the protagonist Sinbad the Sailor narrates the stories of his seven voyages to Sinbad the Porter. The device is also used to great effect in stories such as \"[[The Three Apples]]\" and \"[[#Unreliable narrator|The Seven Viziers]]\". In yet another tale Scheherazade narrates, \"[[The Fisherman and the Jinni]]\", the \"Tale of the Wazir and the Sage [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Duban|Duban]]\" is narrated within it, and within that there are three more tales narrated.\n\n===Dramatic visualization===\nDramatic visualization is \"the representing of an object or character with an abundance of descriptive detail, or the mimetic rendering of gestures and dialogue in such a way as to make a given scene 'visual' or imaginatively present to an audience\". This technique is used in several tales of the ''One Thousand and One Nights''.<ref name=Heath-360/> An example of this is the tale of \"The Three Apples\" (see [[#Crime fiction elements|Crime fiction elements]] below).\n\n===Fate and destiny===\nA common [[Theme (literature)|theme]] in many ''Arabian Nights'' tales is [[wikt:fate|fate]] and [[destiny]]. The [[Italian people|Italian]] filmmaker [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] observed:<ref>{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B.

The chain of anomalies always tends to lead back to normality.

This technique is also found in ''One Thousand and One Nights''.<ref name=Heath-360/>\n\nAnother form of foreshadowing is the [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], which dates back to the story of [[Krishna]] in ancient [[Sanskrit literature]], and [[Oedipus]] or the death of [[Heracles]] in the plays of [[Sophocles]]. A variation of this device is the self-fulfilling dream, which can be found in [[Arabic literature]] (or the dreams of Joseph and his conflicts with his brothers, in the [[Book of Genesis|Hebrew Bible]]). Several tales in the ''One Thousand and One Nights'' use this device to foreshadow what is going to happen, as a special form of literary [[Foreshadowing|prolepsis]]. A notable example is \"The Ruined Man who Became Rich Again through a Dream\", in which a man is told in his dream to leave his native city of [[Baghdad]] and travel to [[Cairo]], where he will discover the whereabouts of some hidden treasure. The man travels there and experiences misfortune, ending up in jail, where he tells his dream to a police officer. The officer mocks the idea of foreboding dreams and tells the protagonist that he himself had a dream about a house with a courtyard and fountain in Baghdad where treasure is buried under the fountain. The man recognizes the place as his own house and, after he is released from jail, he returns home and digs up the treasure. In other words, the foreboding dream not only predicted the future, but the dream was the cause of its prediction coming true. A variant of this story later appears in [[English folklore]] as the \"[[Pedlar of Swaffham]]\" and [[Paulo Coelho]]'s \"[[The Alchemist (novel)|The Alchemist]]\"; [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' collection of short stories ''[[A Universal History of Infamy]]'' featured his translation of this particular story into Spanish, as \"The Story Of The Two Dreamers.\"<ref>{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B.

Ja'afar, \"disturbed and upset flees Baghdad and plunges into a series of adventures in [[Damascus]], involving Attaf and the woman whom Attaf eventually marries.\" After returning to Baghdad, Ja'afar reads the same book that caused Harun to laugh and weep, and discovers that it describes his own adventures with Attaf. In other words, it was Harun's reading of the book that provoked the adventures described in the book to take place.

In some of these, the siblings are female, while in others they are male. One of the tales, \"Judar and His Brethren\", departs from the [[happy ending]]s of previous variants and reworks the plot to give it a [[Tragedy|tragic]] ending instead, with the younger brother being poisoned by his elder brothers.<ref>{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|page=4}}</ref>\n\n===Sexual humour===\nThe ''Nights'' contain many examples of sexual humour.

In one tale, \"The Seven Viziers\" (also known as \"Craft and Malice of Women or The Tale of the King, His Son, His Concubine and the Seven Wazirs\"), a [[courtesan]] accuses a king's son of having assaulted her, when in reality she had failed to seduce him (inspired by the [[Qur'an]]ic/[[Bible|Biblical]] story of [[Islamic view of Joseph|Yusuf]]/[[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]). Seven [[vizier]]s attempt to save his life by narrating seven stories to prove the unreliability of women, and the courtesan responds by narrating a story to prove the unreliability of viziers.<ref>{{citation|title=Story-telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|page=59}}</ref> The unreliable narrator device is also used to generate [[suspense]] in \"The Three Apples\" and [[humor]] in \"The Hunchback's Tale\" (see [[#Crime fiction elements|Crime fiction elements]] below).\n\n===Crime fiction elements===\n[[File:Godefroy Durand - Morgiane.jpg|thumb|Illustration depicting [[Morgiana (character)|Morgiana]] and the thieves from ''[[Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves]]''.]]\nAn example of the [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]]<ref>{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240\u201342}}</ref> and [[Thriller (genre)|suspense thriller]] genres in the collection, with multiple [[plot twist]]s<ref>{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=Brill|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=93, 95, 97}}</ref> and [[detective fiction]] elements<ref>{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=91, 93}}</ref> was \"[[The Three Apples]]\", also known as ''Hikayat al-sabiyya 'l-maqtula'' (\"The Tale of the Murdered Young Woman\").<ref>{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|page=240}}</ref>\n\nIn this tale, [[Harun al-Rashid]] comes to possess a chest, which, when opened, contains the body of a young woman. Harun gives his vizier, [[Ja'far ibn Yahya|Ja'far]], three days to find the culprit or be executed. At the end of three days, when Ja'far is about to be executed for his failure, two men come forward, both claiming to be the murderer. As they tell their story it transpires that, although the younger of them, the woman's husband, was responsible for her death, some of the blame attaches to a slave, who had taken one of the apples mentioned in the title and caused the woman's murder.\n\nHarun then gives Ja'far three more days to find the guilty slave. When he yet again fails to find the culprit, and bids his family goodbye before his execution, he discovers by chance his daughter has the apple, which she obtained from Ja'far's own slave, Rayhan.  Thus the mystery is solved.\n\nAnother ''Nights'' tale with [[crime fiction]] elements was \"The Hunchback's Tale\" story cycle which, unlike \"The Three Apples\", was more of a [[suspense]]ful [[comedy]] and [[Legal drama|courtroom drama]] rather than a murder mystery or detective fiction. The story is set in a fictional China and begins with a hunchback, the emperor's favourite [[comedian]], being invited to dinner by a [[tailor]] couple. The hunchback accidentally chokes on his food from laughing too hard and the couple, fearful that the emperor will be furious, take his body to a [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Jewish doctor]]'s [[Bimaristan|clinic]] and leave him there. This leads to the next tale in the cycle, the \"Tale of the Jewish Doctor\", where the doctor accidentally trips over the hunchback's body, falls down the stairs with him, and finds him dead, leading him to believe that the fall had killed him. The doctor then dumps his body down a chimney, and this leads to yet another tale in the cycle, which continues with twelve tales in total, leading to all the people involved in this incident finding themselves in a [[courtroom]], all making [[Unreliable narrator|different claims]] over how the hunchback had died.<ref>{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|pages=2\u20134}}</ref> Crime fiction elements are also present near the end of \"The Tale of Attaf\" (see [[#Foreshadowing|Foreshadowing]] above).\n\n===Horror fiction elements===\n[[Haunting]] is used as a [[plot device]] in [[gothic fiction]] and [[horror fiction]], as well as modern [[paranormal fiction]]. Legends about [[haunted house]]s have long appeared in literature. In particular, the ''Arabian Nights'' tale of \"Ali the Cairene and the Haunted House in Baghdad\" revolves around a house haunted by [[Genie|jinns]].<ref>{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights and Orientalism: Perspectives from East & West|last=Yuriko Yamanaka|first=Tetsuo Nishio|publisher=[[I.B.

A prime example is the story ''The History of Gherib and His Brother Agib'' (from ''Nights'' vol. 6), in which Gherib, an outcast prince, fights off a family of ravenous Ghouls and then enslaves them and converts them to [[Islam]].<ref>{{cite web|title=''The Story of Gherib and his Brother Agib''|work=Thousand Nights and One Night|author=Al-Hakawati|accessdate=October 2, 2008|url=http://www.al-hakawati.net/english/Stories_Tales/laila170.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221142538/http://www.al-hakawati.net/english/Stories_Tales/laila170.asp|archive-date=December 21, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nHorror fiction elements are also found in \"The City of Brass\" tale, which revolves around a [[ghost town]].<ref name=Hamori>{{citation|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00141540|title=An Allegory from the Arabian Nights: The City of Brass|first=Andras|last=Hamori|journal=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies]]|volume=34|issue=1|year=1971|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=9\u201319 [10]}} The hero of the tale is an historical person, [[Musa bin Nusayr]].</ref>\n\nThe horrific nature of [[Scheherazade]]'s situation is magnified in [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]'', in which the protagonist is forced to write a novel to keep his captor from torturing and killing him.

It is often deployed by stories' narrators to provide detailed descriptions, usually of the beauty of characters. Characters also occasionally quote or speak in verse in certain settings. The uses include but are not limited to:\n* Giving advice, warning, and solutions.\n* Praising God, royalties and those in power.\n* Pleading for mercy and forgiveness.\n* Lamenting wrong decisions or bad luck.\n* Providing riddles, laying questions, challenges.\n* Criticizing elements of life, wondering.\n* Expressing feelings to others or one's self: happiness, sadness, anxiety, surprise, anger.\n\nIn a typical example, expressing feelings of happiness to oneself from Night 203, Prince Qamar Al-Zaman, standing outside the castle, wants to inform Queen Bodour of his arrival.<ref>[http://www.mythfolklore.net/1001nights/burton/kamar.htm Burton Nights].

Its stories are regularly denounced as vulgar, improbable, childish and, above all, badly written.\"<ref>Irwin pp. 81\u201382</ref> \n\nNevertheless, the ''Nights'' have proved an inspiration to some modern Egyptian writers, such as [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]] (author of the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] play ''Shahrazad'', 1934), [[Taha Hussein]] (''Scheherazade's Dreams'', 1943)<ref name=\"Encyclopaedia Iranica\">{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/alf-layla-wa-layla |title=Encyclopaedia Iranica |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-18}}</ref> and [[Naguib Mahfouz]] (''[[Arabian Nights and Days]]'', 1981). [[Idries Shah]] finds the  [[abjad numerals|Abjad]] numerical equivalent of the Arabic title, ''alf layla wa layla'', in the Arabic phrase ''umm el quissa'', meaning \"mother of records\". He goes on to state that many of the stories \"are encoded [[Sufi]] [[teaching stories]], descriptions of psychological processes, or enciphered lore of one kind or another.\" <ref name=\"Sufis\">{{cite book|last=Shah|first=Idries|title=The Sufis|publisher=Octagon Press|origyear=1964|year=1977|location=London, UK|page=174-175|isbn=0-86304-020-9}}</ref>\n\nOn a more popular level, film and TV adaptations based on stories like Sinbad and Aladdin enjoyed long lasting popularity in Arabic speaking countries.\n\n===Possible early influence on European literature===\nAlthough the first known translation into a European language only appeared in 1704, it is possible that the ''Nights'' began exerting its influence on Western culture much earlier. Christian writers in Medieval Spain translated many works from Arabic, mainly philosophy and mathematics, but also Arab fiction, as is evidenced by [[Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena|Juan Manuel]]'s story collection ''[[El Conde Lucanor]]'' and [[Ram\u00f3n Llull]]'s ''The Book of Beasts''.<ref>Irwin pp. 92\u201394</ref> Knowledge of the work, direct or indirect, apparently spread beyond Spain. Themes and motifs with parallels in the ''Nights'' are found in [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' (in ''[[The Squire's Tale]]'' the hero travels on a flying brass horse) and [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]]'s ''[[Decameron]]''. Echoes in [[Giovanni Sercambi]]'s ''Novelle'' and [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'' suggest that the story of Shahriyar and Shahzaman was also known.<ref>Irwin pp. 96\u201399</ref> Evidence also appears to show that the stories had spread to the [[Balkans]] and a translation of the ''Nights'' into [[Romanian language|Romanian]] existed by the 17th century, itself based on a Greek version of the collection.<ref>Irwin pp. 61\u201362</ref>\n\n===Western literature from the 18th century onwards===\n[[File:CC No 08 Arabian Nights.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Classic Comics]]'' issue #8]]\n\nThe modern fame of the ''Nights'' derives from the first known European translation by Antoine Galland, which appeared in 1704. According to [[Robert Irwin (writer)|Robert Irwin]], Galland \"played so large a part in discovering the tales, in popularizing them in Europe and in shaping what would come to be regarded as the canonical collection that, at some risk of hyperbole and paradox, he has been called the real author of the ''Nights''.\"<ref>Irwin p. 14</ref>  The immediate success of Galland's version with the French public may have been because it coincided with the vogue for ''contes de f\u00e9es'' (\"fairy stories\"). This fashion began with the publication of [[Madame d'Aulnoy]]'s ''Histoire d'Hypolite'' in 1690. D'Aulnoy's book has a remarkably similar structure to the ''Nights'', with the tales told by a female narrator. The success of the ''Nights'' spread across Europe and by the end of the century there were translations of Galland into English, German, Italian, Dutch, Danish, Russian, Flemish and Yiddish.<ref>Reynolds pp. 279\u201381</ref> Galland's version provoked a spate of pseudo-Oriental imitations. At the same time, some French writers began to parody the style and concoct far-fetched stories in superficially Oriental settings. These tongue-in-cheek pastiches include [[Antoine Hamilton|Anthony Hamilton]]'s ''Les quatre Facardins'' (1730), [[Claude Prosper Jolyot de Cr\u00e9billon|Cr\u00e9billon]]'s ''[[The Sofa: A Moral Tale|Le sopha]]'' (1742) and [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]'s ''[[The Indiscreet Jewels|Les bijoux indiscrets]]'' (1748). They often contained veiled allusions to contemporary French society. The most famous example is [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Zadig]]'' (1748), an attack on religious bigotry set against a vague pre-Islamic Middle Eastern background.<ref>Irwin pp. 238\u201341</ref> The English versions of the \"Oriental Tale\" generally contained a heavy moralising element,<ref>Irwin p.242</ref> with the notable exception of [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]]'s fantasy ''[[Vathek]]'' (1786), which had a decisive influence on the development of the [[Gothic novel]]. The Polish nobleman [[Jan Potocki]]'s novel ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa|Saragossa Manuscript]]'' (begun 1797) owes a deep debt to the ''Nights'' with its Oriental flavour and labyrinthine series of embedded tales.<ref>Irwin pp. 245\u201360</ref>\n\nThe work was included on a price-list of books on theology, history, and cartography, which was sent by the Scottish bookseller [[Andrew Millar]] (when an apprentice) to a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister. This is illustrative of the title's widespread popularity and availability in the 1720s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.millar-project.ed.ac.uk/manuscripts/html_output/6.html|title=The manuscripts, Letter from Andrew Millar to Robert Wodrow, 5 August, 1725.

According to [[A. S. Byatt]], \"In British Romantic poetry the Arabian Nights stood for the wonderful against the mundane, the imaginative against the prosaically and reductively rational.\"<ref>A. S. Byatt ''On Histories and Stories'' (Harvard University Press, 2001) p. 167</ref> In their autobiographical writings, both [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] and [[Thomas de Quincey|de Quincey]] refer to nightmares the book had caused them when young. [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]] and [[Alfred Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] also wrote about their childhood reading of the tales in their poetry.<ref>Wordsworth in Book Five of ''[[The Prelude]]''; Tennyson in his poem \"Recollections of the ''Arabian Nights''\". (Irwin, pp. 266\u201369)</ref> [[Charles Dickens]] was another enthusiast and the atmosphere of the ''Nights'' pervades the opening of his last novel ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'' (1870).<ref>Irwin p. 270</ref>\n\nSeveral writers have attempted to add a thousand and second tale,<ref name=\"Byatt p.168\">Byatt p. 168</ref> including [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]] (''La mille deuxi\u00e8me nuit'', 1842)<ref name=\"Encyclopaedia Iranica\"/> and [[Joseph Roth]] (''Die Geschichte von der 1002. Nacht'', 1939).<ref name=\"Byatt p.168\"/> [[Edgar Allan Poe]] wrote  \"[[The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Scheherazade]]\" (1845). It depicts the eighth and final voyage of [[Sinbad the Sailor]], along with the various mysteries Sinbad and his crew encounter; the anomalies are then described as footnotes to the story. While the king is uncertain\u2014except in the case of the elephants carrying the world on the back of the turtle\u2014that these mysteries are real, they are actual modern events that occurred in various places during, or before, Poe's lifetime. The story ends with the king in such disgust at the tale Scheherazade has just woven, that he has her executed the very next day.\n\nAnother important literary figure, the [[Ireland|Irish]] poet [[W. B. Yeats]] was also fascinated by the Arabian Nights, when he wrote in his prose book, [[A Vision]] an autobiographical poem, titled The Gift of [[Harun Al-Rashid]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/exhibition/readingeurope/content/ire/NatLibIre_01.pdf|title=The Cat and the Moon and Certain Poems by William Butler Yeats}}</ref> in relation to his joint experiments with his wife [[Georgie Hyde-Lees]], with [[Automatic writing]]. The automatic writing, is a technique used by many occultists in order to discern messages from the subconscious mind or from other spiritual beings, when the hand moves a pencil or a pen, writing only on a simple sheet of paper and when the person's eyes are shut. Also, the gifted and talented wife, is playing in Yeats's poem as \"a gift\" herself, given only allegedly by the caliph to the Christian and Byzantine philosopher [[Qusta ibn Luqa|Qusta Ibn Luqa]], who acts in the poem as a personification of W. B. Yeats. In July 1934 he was asked by Louis Lambert, while in a tour in the United States, which six books satisfied him most. The list that he gave placed the Arabian Nights, secondary only to William Shakespeare's works.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=y5GuCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA291&lpg=PA291&dq=Yeats+ethel+mannin+arabian+nights#v=onepage&q=Yeats+ethel+mannin+arabian+nights&f=false|title=In Excited Reverie: Centenary Tribute to W.B.

The first eight helicopters were built by [[Boeing Integrated Defense Systems|Boeing]]; the remaining 59 were assembled by [[Westland Helicopters]] (now part of [[Leonardo S.p.A.|Leonardo]]) at [[Yeovil]], [[Somerset]] in England from Boeing-supplied kits. Changes from the AH-64D include [[Rolls-Royce Turbomeca]] [[Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322|RTM322 engines]], a new electronic defensive aids suite and a folding blade mechanism allowing the British version to operate from ships. The helicopter was initially designated '''WAH-64''' by Westland Helicopters and was later [[British military aircraft designation systems|given the designation]] '''Apache AH Mk 1''' (also written as \"Apache AH1\") by the [[Ministry of Defence (UK)|Ministry of Defence]].\n\nThe Apache was a valued form of [[close air support]] in the conflict in [[Afghanistan]], being deployed to the region in 2006. Naval trials and temporary deployments at sea have proven the aircraft as an able platform to operate from the decks of ships, which is a unique application of the Apache amongst its operators. British Apaches have also served in the NATO [[2011 military intervention in Libya]] operating from [[Royal Navy]] ships.\n\n==Development==\nThe requirement for a new attack helicopter was identified by the British government in the early 1990s. In 1993, invitations to bid were issued. Bids received included the [[Eurocopter Tiger]], a modernised [[Bell AH-1 SuperCobra]], the [[Boeing AH-64 Apache|AH-64 Apache]], the [[Boeing/Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche]], and the [[Agusta A129 Mangusta]].<ref name= 'NYT 1995'>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/13/business/worldbusiness/13iht-chop.html?pagewanted=1 |title= U.K. Must Choose 1 of 3 Attack Copters : Pitched Battle Near Done |first= Erik |last= Ipsen |work= The New York Times |date= 13 July 1995}}</ref> Both the Tiger and Cobra variant were derided for requiring development, and thus risk, while the Apache was combat proven, though its performance in the [[First Gulf War]] was criticised by competitors.<ref name= 'NYT 1995'/> Westland and the Apache was selected in July 1995, and a contract for 67 helicopters was signed in 1996.<ref name= 'Agusta 2'>AgustaWestland 2011, p. 2.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6339513_ITM |title= High Noon For Tiger And Apache |publisher= Interavia Business & Technology |first= Nick |last= Cook |date= 1 May 1995}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box|align=right|width=25%|quote=\"I have no doubt whatsoever that the Attack Helicopter will represent the biggest single enhancement to the Army's capability for many years.

The first eight helicopters were built by [[Boeing Integrated Defense Systems|Boeing]]; the remaining 59 were assembled by [[Westland Helicopters]] (now part of [[Leonardo S.p.A.|Leonardo]]) at [[Yeovil]], [[Somerset]] in England from Boeing-supplied kits. Changes from the AH-64D include [[Rolls-Royce Turbomeca]] [[Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322|RTM322 engines]], a new electronic defensive aids suite and a folding blade mechanism allowing the British version to operate from ships. The helicopter was initially designated '''WAH-64''' by Westland Helicopters and was later [[British military aircraft designation systems|given the designation]] '''Apache AH Mk 1''' (also written as \"Apache AH1\") by the [[Ministry of Defence (UK)|Ministry of Defence]].\n\nThe Apache was a valued form of [[close air support]] in the conflict in [[Afghanistan]], being deployed to the region in 2006. Naval trials and temporary deployments at sea have proven the aircraft as an able platform to operate from the decks of ships, which is a unique application of the Apache amongst its operators. British Apaches have also served in the NATO [[2011 military intervention in Libya]] operating from [[Royal Navy]] ships.\n\n==Development==\nThe requirement for a new attack helicopter was identified by the British government in the early 1990s. In 1993, invitations to bid were issued. Bids received included the [[Eurocopter Tiger]], a modernised [[Bell AH-1 SuperCobra]], the [[Boeing AH-64 Apache|AH-64 Apache]], the [[Boeing/Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche]], and the [[Agusta A129 Mangusta]].<ref name= 'NYT 1995'>{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/13/business/worldbusiness/13iht-chop.html?pagewanted=1 |title= U.K. Must Choose 1 of 3 Attack Copters : Pitched Battle Near Done |first= Erik |last= Ipsen |work= The New York Times |date= 13 July 1995}}</ref> Both the Tiger and Cobra variant were derided for requiring development, and thus risk, while the Apache was combat proven, though its performance in the [[First Gulf War]] was criticised by competitors.<ref name= 'NYT 1995'/> Westland and the Apache was selected in July 1995, and a contract for 67 helicopters was signed in 1996.<ref name= 'Agusta 2'>AgustaWestland 2011, p. 2.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6339513_ITM |title= High Noon For Tiger And Apache |publisher= Interavia Business & Technology |first= Nick |last= Cook |date= 1 May 1995}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box|align=right|width=25%|quote=\"I have no doubt whatsoever that the Attack Helicopter will represent the biggest single enhancement to the Army's capability for many years.

He was then raised by his elder sister in the village of [[Fatfield]].\n\nAfter leaving school at fifteen, he started worked at North Biddick Colliery, earning seven shillings and sixpence a week. He would supplement his income by playing the [[harmonica]] around local [[working men's club]]s and competing in [[domino]] tournaments. His first stand-up performance took place at the Gem Cinema in Penshaw as a young boy.\n\nThompson was married three times. His second wife, Phyllis, died on 25 April 1967. He announced his engagement to Mary Douglass, 62, of [[Annfield Plain]] a few years later, but the engagement was called off. In 1980, Thompson married his housekeeper, Eleanor Cicely Palmer, more commonly known as Cissy Ward (n\u00e9e Wake). Thompson was her third husband and she was famous for being taller than him.\n\n==Career==\nFamous for his broad [[Pitmatic]] ([[County Durham]] pit village) accent (often mistaken for [[Geordie]]), self-deprecating humour and mastery of the mother-in-law joke, Thompson was affectionately known as ''The Little Waster'' due to his short stature, which he often played on during his act, describing himself as 'Little Bobby'. His most famous outfit was a worn out stripey jumper (Wooly gansey) and [[flat cap]]. His ever-present [[Woodbine (cigarette)|Woodbine]] [[cigarette]] stub, hanging from the corner of his mouth, was also an integral part of his on-stage persona.\n\nHis attempts to move beyond [[North East England]] were limited by his accent and the regional bias of his humour, although he did enjoy some success with the [[BBC]] show, ''Wot Cheor Geordie''.\n\nHe was also renowned for his problems with the tax man, stemming from the fact that he never seemed to pay any. This was an unfortunate fact that he turned to humour in his stage act.\n\nBobby made recordings of three comedy songs written for him by local composer [[Eric Boswell (songwriter)|Eric Boswell]]: ''You Little Waster'', ''The Golden Voice of Bobby'' and ''When I Was A Lad''. The songs incorporated jokes from Bobby's act and ''When I Was A Lad'' was even released as a single locally.\n\nProblems with drink, finances and his health affected his career in the 1970s, but he remained a North East favourite, particularly on the club scene, until shortly before his death.\n\n==Quotes==\n*\"The dole is my shepherd, I shall not work.\"\n*\"She shouts from upstairs, Bobby can yer fix the string on wa carrier . . . why am nae.\"\n*\"I'll give ya a bottle o' Brandy if you can tell us you pay the 'lectric bill before you get the red tooth.\"\n*\"A man come to ou door.

He was then raised by his elder sister in the village of [[Fatfield]].\n\nAfter leaving school at fifteen, he started worked at North Biddick Colliery, earning seven shillings and sixpence a week. He would supplement his income by playing the [[harmonica]] around local [[working men's club]]s and competing in [[domino]] tournaments. His first stand-up performance took place at the Gem Cinema in Penshaw as a young boy.\n\nThompson was married three times. His second wife, Phyllis, died on 25 April 1967. He announced his engagement to Mary Douglass, 62, of [[Annfield Plain]] a few years later, but the engagement was called off. In 1980, Thompson married his housekeeper, Eleanor Cicely Palmer, more commonly known as Cissy Ward (n\u00e9e Wake). Thompson was her third husband and she was famous for being taller than him.\n\n==Career==\nFamous for his broad [[Pitmatic]] ([[County Durham]] pit village) accent (often mistaken for [[Geordie]]), self-deprecating humour and mastery of the mother-in-law joke, Thompson was affectionately known as ''The Little Waster'' due to his short stature, which he often played on during his act, describing himself as 'Little Bobby'. His most famous outfit was a worn out stripey jumper (Wooly gansey) and [[flat cap]]. His ever-present [[Woodbine (cigarette)|Woodbine]] [[cigarette]] stub, hanging from the corner of his mouth, was also an integral part of his on-stage persona.\n\nHis attempts to move beyond [[North East England]] were limited by his accent and the regional bias of his humour, although he did enjoy some success with the [[BBC]] show, ''Wot Cheor Geordie''.\n\nHe was also renowned for his problems with the tax man, stemming from the fact that he never seemed to pay any. This was an unfortunate fact that he turned to humour in his stage act.\n\nBobby made recordings of three comedy songs written for him by local composer [[Eric Boswell (songwriter)|Eric Boswell]]: ''You Little Waster'', ''The Golden Voice of Bobby'' and ''When I Was A Lad''. The songs incorporated jokes from Bobby's act and ''When I Was A Lad'' was even released as a single locally.\n\nProblems with drink, finances and his health affected his career in the 1970s, but he remained a North East favourite, particularly on the club scene, until shortly before his death.\n\n==Quotes==\n*\"The dole is my shepherd, I shall not work.\"\n*\"She shouts from upstairs, Bobby can yer fix the string on wa carrier . . . why am nae.\"\n*\"I'll give ya a bottle o' Brandy if you can tell us you pay the 'lectric bill before you get the red tooth.\"\n*\"A man come to ou door.
