This earlier version was initially recorded as a demo in 1975. The song had a slower, funkier sound with a basic [[disco]] beat.

Harry said that \"'Heart of Glass' was one of the first songs Blondie wrote, but it was years before we recorded it properly. We'd tried it as a ballad, as reggae, but it never quite worked\", and that \"the lyrics weren't about anyone. They were just a plaintive moan about lost love.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\"/> It was only when the band met with producer [[Mike Chapman]] to start work on ''Parallel Lines'' that Harry recalled Chapman \"asked us to play all the songs we had. At the end, he said: 'Have you got anything else?' We sheepishly said: 'Well, there is this old one.' He liked it \u2013 he thought it was fascinating and started to pull it into focus.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\"/>\n\nExactly who decided to give the song a more pronounced disco vibe is subject to differing recollections. On some occasions, the producer Mike Chapman has stated that he convinced Harry and Stein to give the song a disco twist. On other occasions, Chapman has credited Harry with the idea.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Douglas |last= Wolk |title= The Greatest Songs Ever! \u2013 'Heart of Glass' |magazine= [[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] |location= London, England |date= March 2006}}</ref> As a band, Blondie had experimented with disco before, both in the predecessors to \"Heart of Glass\" and in live cover songs that the band played at shows. Bassist [[Gary Lachman|Gary Valentine]] noted that the set list for early Blondie shows often included disco hits such as \"Honey Bee\" or \"My Imagination\".<ref>{{cite book|first= Gary |last= Valentine |title= New York Rocker: My Life in the Blank Generation |year= 2002 |page= 73 |publisher= [[Perseus Books Group#Former imprints|Thunder's Mouth Press]] |isbn= 1-56025-944-2}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview published in the February 4, 1978 edition of ''[[NME]]'', Debbie Harry expressed her affinity for the [[Euro disco]] music of [[Giorgio Moroder]], stating that \"It's commercial, but it's good, it says something... that's the kind of stuff that I want to do\".<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Tony |last= Parsons |title= Gentlemen Prefer Blondies... |magazine= [[NME]] |location= London, England |date= February 4, 1978}}</ref> A notable example of this type of musical experimentation occurred when Blondie covered [[Donna Summer]]'s \"[[I Feel Love]]\" at the Blitz Benefit on May 7, 1978.<ref>{{cite book|first1= Debbie |last1= Harry |first2= Chris |last2= Stein |first3= Victor |last3= Bockris |title= Making Tracks: The Rise of Blondie |pages= 129\u201330 |publisher= Horizon Book Promotions |year= 1982 |isbn= 0-440-55150-1}}</ref> In his history of CBGB, music writer Roman Kozak described this event: \"When Blondie played for the [[Johnny Blitz]] benefit in May, 1978, they surprised everyone with a rendition of Donna Summer's 'I Feel Love'. It was arguably the first time in New York, in the middle of the great rock versus disco split, that a rock band had played a disco song. Blondie went on to record 'Heart of Glass,' other groups recorded other danceable songs, and dance rock was born.\"<ref>{{cite book|first= Roman |last= Kozak |title= This Ain't No Disco: The Story of CBGB |url= https://archive.org/details/thisaintnodiscos00roma |url-access= registration |publisher= [[Faber and Faber]] |location= London, England |year= 1988 |page= [https://archive.org/details/thisaintnodiscos00roma/page/n135 110] |isbn= 0-571-12956-0}}</ref>\n\nThe song was ultimately given the disco orientation that made the song one of the best-known Blondie recordings. For the single release the track was remixed by Chapman, with the double-tracked bass drum even more accentuated.\n\nIn reflecting on the development of \"Heart of Glass\" from its earliest incarnations until the recorded version on ''Parallel Lines'', Chris Stein noted that the earliest versions had a basic conventional disco beat, but that the recorded version incorporated the [[Electronic music|electronic sound]] of Euro disco, stating that \"The original arrangement of 'Heart of Glass'\u2014as on the [1975] Betrock demos\u2014had doubles on the high-hat cymbals, a more straight-ahead disco beat. When we recorded it for ''Parallel Lines'' we were really into [[Kraftwerk]], and we wanted to make it more electronic. We weren't thinking disco as we were doing it; we thought it was more electro-European.\"<ref name=\"Green\"/>\n\nThe ''Parallel Lines'' version (as well as most others) contained some rhythmic features that were very unusual for the disco context, which typically follows a strict [[duple and quadruple meter|four-beats-per-measure]] pattern for maximum danceability. The instrumental interludes in \"Heart of Glass\", in contrast, consist of [[septuple meter|{{music|time|7|4}}]] (seven-beat) [[phrase (music theory)|phrases]], with exception to the last phrase and subsequent [[reprise]]s of each interlude, which resolve back to [[duple and quadruple meter|eight beats per phrase]].\n\nA 5:50 version of \"Heart of Glass\" was first released as a [[12-inch single]] in December 1978.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Top Single Picks |magazine= Billboard |date= December 16, 1978 |page= 80 |url= http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/70s/1978/Billboard%201978-12-16.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"uncensored\"/> Some radio stations in the US were reluctant to play the song because of the \"pain in the ass\" lyric, so an edited 7-inch single was released in January 1979.<ref name=\"uncensored\">{{cite magazine|title= An Uncensored 'Glass' Cut On Blondie Album |magazine= Billboard |date= March 24, 1979 |page= 101 |url= http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/70s/1979/Billboard%201979-03-24.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first= Philip |last= Dodd |authorlink= Philip Dodd (author) |first2= Paul |last2= Du Noyer |authorlink2= Paul Du Noyer |year= 1999 |title= The Encyclopedia of Singles |publisher= Paragon |page= 82 |isbn= 0752533371}}</ref> The original album version was released as a single in the UK where the [[BBC]] [[bleep censor|bleeped]] out the offending word. Debbie Harry told ''[[The Guardian]]'', \"At first, the song kept saying: 'Once I had a love, it was a gas. Soon turned out, it was a pain in the ass.' We couldn't keep saying that, so we came up with: 'Soon turned out, had a heart of glass.'

As explained in the program, the production of \"Heart of Glass\" was built around the use of a [[Roland CR-78]] [[drum machine]]. The CR-78 was first introduced in 1978, the same year that ''Parallel Lines'' was recorded, and the use of this device on \"Heart of Glass\" was, according to the program, among the earliest uses of this device in popular music. As the program explained, it was also very unusual to use a drum machine in the context of a rock band.\n\nIn deciding to use the CR-78 for \"Heart of Glass\", the choice was made to combine the sound of the drum machine with the sound of actual drumming. This reflected the hybrid nature of the song, the combination of a drum machine that was typically used in the context of dance music with the actual drum sound that was a traditional aspect of rock recordings. In combining these elements, the sound of the drum machine was first recorded on an individual track. To synchronize the actual drum play with the drum machine, the drums were also recorded on separate tracks, with the bass drum recorded separately from the rest of the drums.\n\nHaving combined the drums with the drum machine, another important feature of the CR-78 was that it could be used to send a trigger pulse to the early [[polyphonic synthesizer]]s. This trigger pulse feature was also used on \"Heart of Glass\". The trigger pulse created by the CR-78 became a distinctive electronic/synth element of the song. The additional [[synthesizer]] portions of the song were played separately.\n\nOther [[electronic musical instrument]]s used in the track include the [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[Roland SH-3A|SH-5]] and [[Minimoog]] synthesizers. Due to the lack of [[music sequencer]]s, they recorded three different parts using the SH-5 and Minimoog.<ref name=\"Myers\"/>\n\nFor the guitars, each guitar part was again recorded on separate tracks. For the vocals, a single track and a double track of Debbie Harry's voice were combined into a single vocal recording.\n\nIn an interview in the magazine that is part of the collector's edition for the ninth Blondie studio album ''[[Panic of Girls]]'', Debbie Harry explained that band members Chris Stein and [[Jimmy Destri]] had purchased the CR-78 from a music store on 47th Street in Manhattan, and that this is how the device had become part of the production of \"Heart of Glass\": \"Chris and Jimmy were always going over to 47th Street where all the music stores were, and one day they came back with this little rhythm box, which went 'tikka tikka tikka'... And the rest is history!\" Stein also credited Destri with influencing the song's sound, saying he \"had a lot to do with how the record sounds... It was Jimmy who brought in the drum machine and a synthesiser. Synchronising them was a big deal at the time. It all had to be done manually, with every note and beat played in real time rather than looped over.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\"/>\n\n==Controversy==\nAt the time, Blondie was one of the bands at the forefront of New York's growing [[new wave music]] scene and were accused of \"[[selling out]]\" for releasing a disco song. According to Harry, \"Heart of Glass\" made the band pariahs in the eyes of many of their fellow musicians in the New York music scene. The band was accused of [[Pandering (politics)|pandering]] to the mainstream that many punk/new wave bands at the time were actively rebelling against.<ref>{{cite news|first1= Ann |last1= Bardach |first2= Susan |last2= Lydon |title= A Cool Blonde and a Hot Band |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |publisher= [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr.]] |location= New York City, USA |page= 191 |date= August 26, 1979}}</ref> She also said, \"People got nervous and angry about us bringing different influences into rock. Although we'd covered '[[Lady Marmalade]]' and '[[I Feel Love]]' at gigs, lots of people were mad at us for 'going disco' with 'Heart of Glass'... [[Clem Burke]], our drummer, refused to play the song live at first. When it became a hit, he said: 'I guess I'll have to.'\" Chris Stein was unrepentant about the song's disco sound, saying, \"As far as I was concerned, disco was part of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], which I'd always liked.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\"/>\n\nDespite the controversy, the song was a huge hit and helped propel Blondie from cult group to mainstream icons. The band itself has acknowledged the success of the song in helping their careers and has downplayed criticism of the song, pointing out that they always experimented with different styles of music and that \"Heart of Glass\" was their take on disco. The band itself has jokingly taken to referring to the song as \"The Disco Song\" in interviews. The band also credits the TV sitcom about a radio station, ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', which played the song on one of their episodes and gave it critical exposure. In gratitude, the band gave the series' producers a [[Music recording certification#Certification thresholds|Gold record]] for the song and it can be seen in the bullpen scenes from the second season to the series' conclusion.<ref>{{cite web|first= Michaelangelo |last= Matos |title= WKRP in Perpetuity |publisher= [[NPR]] |date= December 6, 2014 |accessdate= April 20, 2018 |url= https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2014/12/06/367971595/wkrp-in-perpetuity}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe \"Heart of Glass\" promotional video was directed by [[Stanley Dorfman]]. Contrary to popular belief, it was not filmed at the [[Studio 54]] nightclub; Chris Stein said that \"in the video, there's a shot of the legendary Studio 54, so everyone thought we shot the video there, but it was actually in a short-lived club called the Copa or something\".<ref name=\"Simpson\"/> The video begins with footage of [[New York City]] at night before joining Blondie on stage. Then, the video alternates between close-ups of Debbie Harry's face as she lip-syncs and mid-distance shots of the entire band. Harry said, \"For the video, I wanted to dance around but they told us to remain static, while the cameras moved around. God only knows why.

The [[Marilyn Monroe|Marilyn]] do has artfully fallen over, and she's in the funkiest of dresses: one strap across her shoulder, swirling silks around about her.

Harry said that \"'Heart of Glass' was one of the first songs Blondie wrote, but it was years before we recorded it properly. We'd tried it as a ballad, as reggae, but it never quite worked\", and that \"the lyrics weren't about anyone. They were just a plaintive moan about lost love.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\"/> It was only when the band met with producer [[Mike Chapman]] to start work on ''Parallel Lines'' that Harry recalled Chapman \"asked us to play all the songs we had. At the end, he said: 'Have you got anything else?' We sheepishly said: 'Well, there is this old one.' He liked it \u2013 he thought it was fascinating and started to pull it into focus.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\"/>\n\nExactly who decided to give the song a more pronounced disco vibe is subject to differing recollections.

It was arguably the first time in New York, in the middle of the great rock versus disco split, that a rock band had played a disco song. Blondie went on to record 'Heart of Glass,' other groups recorded other danceable songs, and dance rock was born.\"<ref>{{cite book|first= Roman |last= Kozak |title= This Ain't No Disco: The Story of CBGB |url= https://archive.org/details/thisaintnodiscos00roma |url-access= registration |publisher= [[Faber and Faber]] |location= London, England |year= 1988 |page= [https://archive.org/details/thisaintnodiscos00roma/page/n135 110] |isbn= 0-571-12956-0}}</ref>\n\nThe song was ultimately given the disco orientation that made the song one of the best-known Blondie recordings. For the single release the track was remixed by Chapman, with the double-tracked bass drum even more accentuated.\n\nIn reflecting on the development of \"Heart of Glass\" from its earliest incarnations until the recorded version on ''Parallel Lines'', Chris Stein noted that the earliest versions had a basic conventional disco beat, but that the recorded version incorporated the [[Electronic music|electronic sound]] of Euro disco, stating that \"The original arrangement of 'Heart of Glass'\u2014as on the [1975] Betrock demos\u2014had doubles on the high-hat cymbals, a more straight-ahead disco beat. When we recorded it for ''Parallel Lines'' we were really into [[Kraftwerk]], and we wanted to make it more electronic. We weren't thinking disco as we were doing it; we thought it was more electro-European.\"<ref name=\"Green\"/>\n\nThe ''Parallel Lines'' version (as well as most others) contained some rhythmic features that were very unusual for the disco context, which typically follows a strict [[duple and quadruple meter|four-beats-per-measure]] pattern for maximum danceability. The instrumental interludes in \"Heart of Glass\", in contrast, consist of [[septuple meter|{{music|time|7|4}}]] (seven-beat) [[phrase (music theory)|phrases]], with exception to the last phrase and subsequent [[reprise]]s of each interlude, which resolve back to [[duple and quadruple meter|eight beats per phrase]].\n\nA 5:50 version of \"Heart of Glass\" was first released as a [[12-inch single]] in December 1978.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Top Single Picks |magazine= Billboard |date= December 16, 1978 |page= 80 |url= http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/70s/1978/Billboard%201978-12-16.pdf}}</ref><ref name=\"uncensored\"/> Some radio stations in the US were reluctant to play the song because of the \"pain in the ass\" lyric, so an edited 7-inch single was released in January 1979.<ref name=\"uncensored\">{{cite magazine|title= An Uncensored 'Glass' Cut On Blondie Album |magazine= Billboard |date= March 24, 1979 |page= 101 |url= http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/70s/1979/Billboard%201979-03-24.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first= Philip |last= Dodd |authorlink= Philip Dodd (author) |first2= Paul |last2= Du Noyer |authorlink2= Paul Du Noyer |year= 1999 |title= The Encyclopedia of Singles |publisher= Paragon |page= 82 |isbn= 0752533371}}</ref> The original album version was released as a single in the UK where the [[BBC]] [[bleep censor|bleeped]] out the offending word.

As explained in the program, the production of \"Heart of Glass\" was built around the use of a [[Roland CR-78]] [[drum machine]]. The CR-78 was first introduced in 1978, the same year that ''Parallel Lines'' was recorded, and the use of this device on \"Heart of Glass\" was, according to the program, among the earliest uses of this device in popular music. As the program explained, it was also very unusual to use a drum machine in the context of a rock band.\n\nIn deciding to use the CR-78 for \"Heart of Glass\", the choice was made to combine the sound of the drum machine with the sound of actual drumming. This reflected the hybrid nature of the song, the combination of a drum machine that was typically used in the context of dance music with the actual drum sound that was a traditional aspect of rock recordings. In combining these elements, the sound of the drum machine was first recorded on an individual track. To synchronize the actual drum play with the drum machine, the drums were also recorded on separate tracks, with the bass drum recorded separately from the rest of the drums.\n\nHaving combined the drums with the drum machine, another important feature of the CR-78 was that it could be used to send a trigger pulse to the early [[polyphonic synthesizer]]s. This trigger pulse feature was also used on \"Heart of Glass\". The trigger pulse created by the CR-78 became a distinctive electronic/synth element of the song. The additional [[synthesizer]] portions of the song were played separately.\n\nOther [[electronic musical instrument]]s used in the track include the [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[Roland SH-3A|SH-5]] and [[Minimoog]] synthesizers. Due to the lack of [[music sequencer]]s, they recorded three different parts using the SH-5 and Minimoog.<ref name=\"Myers\"/>\n\nFor the guitars, each guitar part was again recorded on separate tracks. For the vocals, a single track and a double track of Debbie Harry's voice were combined into a single vocal recording.\n\nIn an interview in the magazine that is part of the collector's edition for the ninth Blondie studio album ''[[Panic of Girls]]'', Debbie Harry explained that band members Chris Stein and [[Jimmy Destri]] had purchased the CR-78 from a music store on 47th Street in Manhattan, and that this is how the device had become part of the production of \"Heart of Glass\": \"Chris and Jimmy were always going over to 47th Street where all the music stores were, and one day they came back with this little rhythm box, which went 'tikka tikka tikka'... And the rest is history!\" Stein also credited Destri with influencing the song's sound, saying he \"had a lot to do with how the record sounds... It was Jimmy who brought in the drum machine and a synthesiser. Synchronising them was a big deal at the time. It all had to be done manually, with every note and beat played in real time rather than looped over.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\"/>\n\n==Controversy==\nAt the time, Blondie was one of the bands at the forefront of New York's growing [[new wave music]] scene and were accused of \"[[selling out]]\" for releasing a disco song. According to Harry, \"Heart of Glass\" made the band pariahs in the eyes of many of their fellow musicians in the New York music scene. The band was accused of [[Pandering (politics)|pandering]] to the mainstream that many punk/new wave bands at the time were actively rebelling against.<ref>{{cite news|first1= Ann |last1= Bardach |first2= Susan |last2= Lydon |title= A Cool Blonde and a Hot Band |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |publisher= [[Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr.]] |location= New York City, USA |page= 191 |date= August 26, 1979}}</ref> She also said, \"People got nervous and angry about us bringing different influences into rock. Although we'd covered '[[Lady Marmalade]]' and '[[I Feel Love]]' at gigs, lots of people were mad at us for 'going disco' with 'Heart of Glass'... [[Clem Burke]], our drummer, refused to play the song live at first. When it became a hit, he said: 'I guess I'll have to.'\" Chris Stein was unrepentant about the song's disco sound, saying, \"As far as I was concerned, disco was part of [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], which I'd always liked.\"<ref name=\"Simpson\"/>\n\nDespite the controversy, the song was a huge hit and helped propel Blondie from cult group to mainstream icons. The band itself has acknowledged the success of the song in helping their careers and has downplayed criticism of the song, pointing out that they always experimented with different styles of music and that \"Heart of Glass\" was their take on disco. The band itself has jokingly taken to referring to the song as \"The Disco Song\" in interviews. The band also credits the TV sitcom about a radio station, ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', which played the song on one of their episodes and gave it critical exposure. In gratitude, the band gave the series' producers a [[Music recording certification#Certification thresholds|Gold record]] for the song and it can be seen in the bullpen scenes from the second season to the series' conclusion.<ref>{{cite web|first= Michaelangelo |last= Matos |title= WKRP in Perpetuity |publisher= [[NPR]] |date= December 6, 2014 |accessdate= April 20, 2018 |url= https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2014/12/06/367971595/wkrp-in-perpetuity}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe \"Heart of Glass\" promotional video was directed by [[Stanley Dorfman]]. Contrary to popular belief, it was not filmed at the [[Studio 54]] nightclub; Chris Stein said that \"in the video, there's a shot of the legendary Studio 54, so everyone thought we shot the video there, but it was actually in a short-lived club called the Copa or something\".<ref name=\"Simpson\"/> The video begins with footage of [[New York City]] at night before joining Blondie on stage. Then, the video alternates between close-ups of Debbie Harry's face as she lip-syncs and mid-distance shots of the entire band. Harry said, \"For the video, I wanted to dance around but they told us to remain static, while the cameras moved around. God only knows why.

Many tribes in the area have continued to use the area's resources while encountering non-Native hunters, fishers, and recreation users.<ref>{{Cite book|title=American Indians and National Forests|last=Catton|first=Theodore|publisher=University of Arizona Press|year=2017|isbn=9780816536511|location=Tucson, AZ|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIt was later renamed the Gifford Pinchot National Forest on June 15, 1949 in honor of [[Gifford Pinchot]], one of the leading figures in the creation of the national forest system of the United States.<ref>{{citation|title=National Forests of the United States|date=September 29, 2005|url=http://www.foresthistory.org/ASPNET/Places/National%20Forests%20of%20the%20U.S.pdf|author=Davis, Richard C.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028014355/http://www.foresthistory.org/ASPNET/Places/National%20Forests%20of%20the%20U.S.pdf|url-status=dead|publisher=The [[Forest History Society]]|archivedate=October 28, 2012}}</ref> In 1985 the non-profit Gifford Pinchot Task Force formed to promote conservation of the forest. \n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Gpnf vicinity.png|right|thumb|Map of Gifford Pinchot National Forest]]\n[[File:Lower Falls Lewis River.jpg|thumbnail|right|Lower Falls of the Lewis River]]\n[[File:Mount Adams Early Morning Reflection at Takhlakh Lake.png|thumbnail|right|[[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]] early morning reflection at [[Takhlakh Lake]]]]\n[[File:Olallie Lake, Washington 01.JPG|thumbnail|right|[[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]] above [[Olallie Lake (Washington)|Olallie Lake]]]]\n[[File:Horseshoe Lake Shore.JPG|thumbnail|right|[[Horseshoe Lake (Washington)|Horseshoe Lake]]]]\n\nGifford Pinchot National Forest is located in a mountainous region approximately between [[Mount St. Helens]] to the west, [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]] to the east, Mount Rainier National Park to the north, and the [[Columbia River]] to the south.

A lawyer, he became one of the first black [[precinct captain]]s in the city, and a [[Methodist]] minister.<ref>''Hamlish Levinsohn, p. 246'', relates that Washington identified himself with his grandfather and father Roy's Methodist background. ''Rivlin, p. 42'', notes that at age 4, Harold and his brother, 6, were sent to a private [[Benedictine]] school in Wisconsin. The arrangement lasted one week before they ran away from the school and hitchhiked home. After three more years and thirteen escapes, Roy placed Harold in Chicago city public schools.</ref> In 1918, daughter Geneva was born and second son Edward was born in 1920. Bertha left the family, possibly to seek her fortune as a singer, and the couple divorced in 1928.  Bertha remarried and had seven more children including Ramon Price, who was an artist and eventually became chief curator of [[The DuSable Museum of African American History]]. Harold Washington grew up in [[Douglas, Chicago#Bronzeville|Bronzeville]], a Chicago neighborhood that was the center of black culture for the entire Midwest in the early and middle 20th century. Edward and Harold stayed with their father while Roy Jr and Geneva were cared by grandparents. After attending St Benedict the Moor Boarding School in Milwaukee from 1928 to 1932, Washington attended [[DuSable High School]], then a newly established [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]] public high school, and was a member of its first graduating class. In a 1939 citywide track meet, Washington placed first in the 110-meter high hurdles event, and second in the 220-meter low hurdles event. Between his junior and senior year of high school, Washington dropped out, claiming that he no longer felt challenged by the coursework. He worked at a meatpacking plant for a time before his father helped him get a job at the [[U.S. Treasury]] branch in the city. There he met Nancy Dorothy Finch, whom he married soon after; Washington was 19 years old and Dorothy was 17 years old. Seven months later, the U.S. was drawn into [[World War II]] with the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]] by the Japanese on Sunday, December 7, 1941.\n\n===Military service===\nIn 1942, Washington was drafted into the [[United States Army]] for the war effort and after basic training, sent overseas as part of a [[African-American discrimination in the U.S. Military|racially segregated unit]] of the [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]] unit of [[Military engineer|Engineers]]. After the American invasion of the [[Philippines]] in 1944, on [[Leyte Island]] and later the main [[Luzon]] island, Washington was part of a unit building runways for bombers, protective fighter aircraft, refueling planes, and returning damaged aircraft. Eventually, Washington rose to the rank of [[First Sergeant]] in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] (later in the war renamed the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]]).\n\n===Roosevelt College===\nIn the summer of 1946, Washington, aged 24 and a war veteran, enrolled at [[Roosevelt University|Roosevelt College]] (now Roosevelt University).<ref name=\"levinsohn_42-43\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 42\u201343.</ref> Washington joined other groups of students not permitted to enroll in other local colleges. Local estimates placed the student population of Roosevelt College at about 1/8&nbsp;black and 1/2&nbsp;Jewish. A full 75% of the students had enrolled because of the \"nondiscriminatory progressive principles.\"<ref name=\"levinsohn_42-43\" /> He chaired a fund-raising drive by students, and then was named to a committee that supported citywide efforts to outlaw  \"[[restrictive covenants]]\" in housing, the legal means by which minorities (especially blacks (\"negroes\") and, to a lesser extent, Jews) were prohibited from purchasing real estate in predominantly white neighborhoods of the city.<ref name=\"levinsohn_44\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), p. 44.</ref>\n\nIn 1948, after the college had moved to the [[Auditorium Building]], Washington was elected the third president of Roosevelt's student council. Under his leadership, the student council successfully petitioned the college to have student representation on Roosevelt's faculty committees. At the first regional meeting of the newly founded [[National Student Association]] in the spring of 1948, Washington and nine other delegates proposed student representation on college faculties, and a \"Bill of Rights\" for students; both measures were roundly defeated.<ref name=\"levinsohn_51-53\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 51\u201353.</ref> The next year, Washington went to the state capital at [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to protest [[Illinois State Legislature|Illinois legislators']] coming probe of \"subversives\". The probe of investigation would outlaw the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] and require \"loyalty oaths\" for teachers. He led students' opposition to the bills, although they would pass later in 1949.<ref name=\"levinsohn_51-53\" />\n\nDuring his Roosevelt College years, Washington came to be known for his stability. His friends said that he had a \"remarkable ability to keep cool\", reason carefully and walk a middle line. Washington intentionally avoided extremist activities, including street actions and sit-ins against racially segregated restaurants and businesses. Overall, Washington and other radical activists ended up sharing a mutual respect for each other, acknowledging both Washington's pragmatism and the activists' idealism. With the opportunities found only at Roosevelt College in the late 1940s, Washington's time at the Roosevelt College proved to be pivotal.<ref name=\"levinsohn_54-55,59,62\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 54\u201355, 59, 62.</ref> Washington graduated in August 1949, with a [[Bachelor of Arts|Bachelor of Arts (B.A.)]] degree. In addition to his activities at Roosevelt, he was a member of [[Phi Beta Sigma]] fraternity.<ref name=\"congbio\" /><ref name=\"levinsohn_63\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), p. 63.</ref>\n\n===Northwestern University School of Law===\nWashington then applied and was admitted to study law at the [[Northwestern University School of Law]] in Chicago. During this time, Washington was divorced from Dorothy Finch. By some accounts, Harold and Dorothy had simply grown apart after Washington was sent overseas during the war during the first year of his marriage. Others saw both as young and headstrong, the relationship doomed from the beginning. Another friend of Washington's deemed Harold \"not the marrying kind.\" He would not marry again, but continued to have relationships with other women; his longtime secretary is said to have said, \"If every woman Harold slept with stood at one end of [[Chicago City Hall|City Hall]], the building would sink five inches into [[LaSalle Street]]!\".<ref name=\"rivlin_53\">Rivlin (1992), p. 53.</ref>\n\nAt Northwestern Law School, Washington was the only black student in his class (there were six women in the class, one of them being [[Dawn Clark Netsch]]). As at Roosevelt, he entered school politics. In 1951, his last year, he was elected treasurer of the [[Student Bar Association|Junior Bar Association]] (JBA). The election was largely symbolic, however, and Washington's attempts to give the JBA more authority at Northwestern were largely unsuccessful.<ref name=\"levinsohn_66\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), p. 66.</ref> On campus, Washington joined the Nu Beta Epsilon fraternity, largely because he and the other minorities which constituted the fraternity were blatantly excluded from the other fraternities on campus. Overall, Washington stayed away from the activism that defined his years at Roosevelt. During the evenings and weekends, he worked to supplement his [[GI Bill]] income. He received his [[Juris Doctor|JD]] in 1952.<ref name=\"levinsohn_68-70\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 68\u201370.</ref>\n\n== Legislative political career ==\n\n=== Working for Metcalfe (1951\u20131965)===\nFrom 1951 until he was first slated for election in 1965, Washington worked in the offices of the 3rd Ward Alderman, former Olympic athlete [[Ralph Metcalfe]]. [[Richard J. Daley]] was elected party chairman in 1952. Daley replaced C.C. Wimbush, an ally of [[William L. Dawson (politician)|William Dawson]], on the party committee with Metcalfe. Under Metcalfe, the 3rd Ward was a critical factor in Mayor Daley's 1955 mayoral election victory and ranked first in the city in the size of its Democratic plurality in 1961.<ref name=\"levinsohn_75\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), p. 75.</ref> While working under Metcalfe, Washington began to organize the 3rd Ward's [[Young Democrats of America|Young Democrats]] (YD) organization. At YD conventions, the 3rd Ward would push for numerous resolutions in the interest of blacks. Eventually, other black YD organizations would come to the 3rd Ward headquarters for advice on how to run their own organizations. Like he had at Roosevelt College, Washington avoided radicalism and preferred to work through the party to engender change.<ref name=\"levinsohn_86-90\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 86\u201390.</ref>\n\nWhile working with the Young Democrats, Washington met Mary Ella Smith.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-11-27/features/8802190754_1_mary-ella-smith-mayor-harold-washington-late-mayor |title=Mary Ella Smith Still Keeps The Flame |accessdate=May 26, 2018}}</ref> They dated for the next 20 years, and in 1983 Washington proposed to Smith. In an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, Smith said that she never pressed Washington for marriage because she knew Washington's first love was politics, saying, \"He was a political animal. He thrived on it, and I knew any thoughts of marriage would have to wait. I wasn't concerned about that. I just knew the day would come.\"<ref name=\"kup_19871227\">{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB36DA09871C50C&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Kup on Sunday |author=Kup |date=December 27, 1987 |accessdate=February 15, 2008 |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref>\n\nIn 1959 Al Janney, Gus Savage, Lemuel Bentley, Bennett Johnson, Luster Jackson and others founded the Chicago League of Negro Voters, one of the first African-American political organizations in the city. In its first election, Bentley drew 60,000 votes for city clerk. The endorsement of the League was deciding factor in the re-election of Leon DesPres who was an independent voice in the City Council. Washington was a close friend of the founders of the League and worked with them from time to time. The League was key in electing Anna Langford, William Cousins and A. A. \"Sammy\" Rayner who were not part of the Daley machine. In 1963 the group moved to racially integrate and formed Protest at the Polls at a citywide conference which Washington independent candidates had gained traction within the black community, winning several aldermanic seats. In 1983, Protest at the Polls was instrumental in Washington's run for mayor. By then, the YDs were losing to \nindependent candidates.<ref name=\"levinsohn_91-92,97\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 91\u201392, 97.</ref>\n\n=== Illinois House (1965\u20131976) ===\nAfter the state legislature failed to reapportion districts as required by the census every ten years, an [[at-large]] election was held in January 1965 to elect 177 [[Illinois House of Representatives|representatives]]. With the Republicans and Democrats combining to slate only 118 candidates, independent voting groups seized the opportunity to slate candidates. The League of Negro Voters created a \"Third Slate\" of 59 candidates, announcing the slate on June 27, 1964. Shortly afterwards, Daley put together a slate including [[Adlai Stevenson III]] and Washington. The Third Slate was then thrown out by the Illinois Election Board because of \"insufficient signatures\" on the nominating petitions. In the election, Washington received the second-largest amount of ballots, behind Stevenson.<ref name=\"levinsohn_98-99\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 98\u201399.</ref> Washington's years in the Illinois House were marked by tension with Democratic Party leadership. In 1967, he was ranked by the [[Independent Voters of Illinois-Independent Precinct Organization|Independent Voters of Illinois]] (IVI) as the fourth-most independent legislator in the Illinois House and named Best Legislator of the Year. His defiance of the \"idiot card\", a sheet of paper that directed legislators' votes on every issue, attracted the attention of party leaders, who moved to remove Washington from his legislative position.<ref name=\"levinsohn_100-106\" /> Daley often told Metcalfe to dump Washington as a candidate, but Metcalfe did not want to risk losing the 3rd Ward's Young Democrats, who were mostly aligned with Washington.<ref name=\"rivlin_50-52\">Rivlin (1992), pp. 50\u201352.</ref>\n\nWashington backed [[Renault Robinson]], a black police officer and one of the founders of the [[Afro-American Patrolmen's League]] (AAPL). The aim of the AAPL was to fight racism directed against minority officers by the rest of the predominantly white department. Soon after the creation of the group, Robinson was written up for minor infractions, suspended, reinstated, and then placed on the graveyard shift to a single block behind central police headquarters. Robinson approached Washington to fashion a bill creating a civilian review board, consisting of both patrolmen and officers, to monitor police brutality. Both black independent and white liberal legislators refused to back the bill, afraid to challenge Daley's grip on the police force.<ref name=\"rivlin_50-52\" />\n\nAfter Washington announced he would support the AAPL, Metcalfe refused to protect him from Daley. Washington believed he had the support of [[John Touhy]], [[Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] and a former party chair. Instead, Touhy criticized Washington and then allayed Daley's anger. In exchange for the party's backing, Washington would serve on the Chicago Crime Commission, the group Daley formed to investigate the AAPL's charges. The commission promptly found the AAPL's charges \"unwarranted\". An angry and humiliated Washington admitted that on the commission, he felt like Daley's \"showcase ni***r\".<ref name=\"rivlin_50-52\" /> In 1969, Daley removed Washington's name from the slate; only by the intervention of [[Cecil Partee]], a party loyalist, was Washington reinstated. The Democratic Party supported Jim Taylor, a former professional boxer, Streets and Sanitation worker, over Washington. With Partee and his own ward's support, Washington defeated Taylor.<ref name=\"levinsohn_100-106\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 100\u2013106.</ref> His years in the House of Representatives were focused on becoming an advocate for black rights. He continued work on the Fair Housing Act, and worked to strengthen the state's Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC). In addition, he worked on a state Civil Rights Act, which would strengthen employment and housing provisions in the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. In his first session, all of his bills were sent to committee or tabled. Like his time in Roosevelt College, Washington relied on parliamentary tactics (e.g., writing amendments guaranteed to fail in a vote) to enable him to bargain for more concessions.<ref name=\"levinsohn_107-108\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 107\u2013108.</ref>\n\nWashington was accused of failure to file a tax return, even though the tax was paid.  He was found guilty and sentenced to 36 days in jail.

He passed a resolution honoring Metcalfe, his mentor. He also passed a resolution honoring [[James J. Reeb]], a Unitarian minister who was beaten to death in [[Selma, Alabama]] by a segregationist mob. After the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], he introduced a series of bills aimed at making King's birthday a state holiday.<ref>Travis, \"Harold,\" The Peoples Mayor, 81\u201382 ).</ref> The first was tabled and later vetoed.

He only received votes from himself and from [[Lewis A. H. Caldwell]].<ref name=\"levinsohn_a\"/> However, with a divided Democratic caucus, this was enough to help deny Daley-backed [[Clyde Choate]] the nomination, helping to throw it to [[William A.

Legislators rewrote all of the human rights laws in the state, restricting discrimination based on \"race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, physical or mental disability, military status, sexual orientation, or unfavorable discharge from military service in connection with employment, real estate transactions, access to financial credit, and the availability of public accommodations.\"<ref name='ilcs'>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs5.asp?ActID=2266&ChapAct=775%26nbsp%3BILCS%26nbsp%3B5%2F&ChapterID=64&ChapterName=HUMAN+RIGHTS&ActName=Illinois+Human+Rights+Act. |year=1970 |accessdate=April 21, 2008 |author=Illinois General Assembly |title=(775 ILCS 5/) Illinois Human Rights Act.}}</ref> The bill's origins began in 1970 with the rewriting of the [[Illinois Constitution]]. The new constitution required all governmental agencies and departments to be reorganized for efficiency. Republican governor [[James R. Thompson]] reorganized low-profile departments before his re-election in 1978. In 1979, during the early stages of his second term and immediately in the aftermath of the largest vote for a gubernatorial candidate in the state's history, Thompson called for human rights reorganization.<ref name=\"levinsohn_130-131\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 130\u2013131.</ref> The bill would consolidate and remove some agencies, eliminating a number of political jobs. Some Democratic legislators would oppose any measure backed by Washington, Thompson and Republican legislators.\n\nFor many years, human rights had been a campaign issue brought up and backed by Democrats. Thompson's staffers brought the bill to Washington and other black legislators before it was presented to the legislature. Washington made adjustments in anticipation of some legislators' concerns regarding the bill, before speaking for it in April 1979. On May 24, 1979, the bill passed the Senate by a vote of 59 to 1, with two voting present and six absent. The victory in the Senate was attributed by a Thompson staffer to Washington's \"calm noncombative presentation\".<ref name=\"levinsohn_132-134\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 132\u2013134.</ref> However, the bill stalled in the House. State Representative [[Susan Catania]] insisted on attaching an amendment to allow women guarantees in the use of credit cards. This effort was assisted by [[Carol Moseley Braun]], a representative from [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] who would later go on to serve as a U.S. Senator. State Representatives Jim Taylor and Larry Bullock introduced over one hundred amendments, including the text of the first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution, to try to stall the bill. With Catania's amendment, the bill passed the House, but the Senate refused to accept the amendment. On June 30, 1979, the legislature adjourned.<ref name=\"levinsohn_132-134\" />\n\n===U.S. House (1981\u20131983)===\nIn 1980, Washington was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in [[Illinois's 1st congressional district]].

Washington missed many House votes, an issue that would come up in his campaign for mayor in 1983.<ref name=\"levinsohn_166-172\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 166\u2013172.</ref> Washington's major congressional accomplishment involved legislation to extend the [[Voting Rights Act]], legislation that opponents had argued was only necessary in an emergency. Others, including Congressman [[Henry Hyde]], had submitted amendments designed to seriously weaken the power of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nAlthough he had been called \"crazy\" for railing in the House of Representatives against deep cuts to social programs, [[Associated Press]] political reporter Mike Robinson noted that Washington worked \"quietly and thoughtfully\" as the time came to pass the act. During hearings in the South regarding the Voting Rights Act, Washington asked questions that shed light on tactics used to prevent African Americans from voting (among them, closing registration early, literacy tests, and gerrymandering). After the amendments were submitted on the floor, Washington spoke from prepared speeches that avoided rhetoric and addressed the issues.  As a result, the amendments were defeated, and Congress passed the Voting Rights Act Extension.<ref name=\"levinsohn_172\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), p.172.</ref> By the time Washington faced re-election in 1982, he had cemented his popularity in the 1st Congressional District. Jane Byrne could not find one serious candidate to run against Washington for his re-election campaign. He had collected 250,000 signatures to get on the ballot, although only 610 signatures (0.5% of the voters in the previous election) were required. With his re-election to Congress locked up, Washington turned his attention to the next Chicago mayoral election.<ref name=\"levinsohn_176\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), p.176.</ref>\n\n==Mayor of Chicago (1983\u20131987)==\n[[File:Harold Washington (2592).jpg|thumb|right|Washington holds a press conference for his 1983 campaign at the [[Hyatt Regency Chicago]] on December 13, 1982.]]\n[[File:Harold Washington at the commissioning of USS Chicago (SSN-721) cropped.jpg|thumb|Harold Washington speaking at the commissioning of [[USS Chicago (SSN-721)|USS ''Chicago'' (SSN-721)]], September 1986.]]\n\n===1983 election ===\n<nowiki> </nowiki>In the February 22, 1983, Democratic mayoral primary, more than 100,000 new voters registered to vote led by a coalition that included the Latino reformed gang [[Young Lords]] led by [[Jose Cha Cha Jimenez]]. On the North and Northwest Sides, the incumbent mayor [[Jane Byrne]] led and future mayor [[Richard M. Daley]], son of the late Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]], finished a close second. Harold Washington had massive majorities on the South and West Sides.  Southwest Side voters overwhelmingly supported Daley. Washington won with 37% of the vote, versus 33% for Byrne and 30% for Daley. Although winning the Democratic primary was normally considered [[tantamount to election]] in heavily Democratic Chicago, after his primary victory Washington found that his [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opponent, former state legislator [[Bernard Epton]] (earlier considered a nominal stand-in), was supported by many high-ranking Democrats and their ward organizations, including the chairman of the [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] Democratic Party, Alderman [[Edward Vrdolyak]].<ref name=\"davis_19830412\">{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-chicagodays-haroldwashington-story,0,1660876.story |title=The election of Harold Washington the first black mayor of Chicago |author=Davis, Robert |date=April 12, 1983 |accessdate=February 16, 2008 |newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}</ref>\n\nEpton's campaign referred to, among other things, Washington's conviction for failure to file [[income tax]] returns (he had paid the taxes, but had not filed a return). Washington, on the other hand, stressed reforming the Chicago patronage system and the need for a jobs program in a tight economy. In the April 12, 1983, mayoral general election, Washington defeated Epton by 3.7%, 51.7% to 48.0%, to become mayor of Chicago. Washington was sworn in as mayor on April 29, 1983, and resigned his Congressional seat the following day.\n\n=== First term and Council Wars ===\nDuring his tenure as mayor, Washington lived at the [[Hampton House (Chicago, Illinois)|Hampton House]] apartments in the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] neighborhood of Chicago. He created the city's first environmental-affairs department under the management of longtime Great Lakes environmentalist [[Lee Botts]]. Washington's first term in office was characterized by conflict with the city council dubbed \"[[Council Wars]]\", referring to the then-recent ''[[Star Wars]]'' films and caused Chicago to be nicknamed \"[[Beirut]] on the [[Lake Michigan|Lake]]\". A 29-alderman City Council majority refused to enact Washington's legislation and prevented him from appointing nominees to boards and commissions. First-term challenges included city population loss and a massive decrease in ridership on the [[Chicago Transit Authority]] (CTA).{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Assertions that the overall crime rate increased were incorrect.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/84/harold|title=Harold|work=This American Life|access-date=November 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe 29, also known as the \"Vrdolyak 29\", were led by Vrdolyak (who was an Alderman in addition to Cook County Democratic Party chairman) and Finance Chair, Alderman [[Edward M. Burke|Edward Burke]]. Parks superintendent Edmund Kelly also opposed the mayor. The three were known as \"the Eddies\" and were supported by the younger Daley (now State's Attorney), U.S. Congressmen [[Dan Rostenkowski]] and [[William Lipinski]], and much of the Democratic Party. During his first city council meeting, Washington and the 21 supportive aldermen walked out of the meeting after a quorum had been established. Vrdolyak and the other 28 then chose committee chairmen and assigned aldermen to the various committees. Later lawsuits submitted by Washington and others were dismissed because it was determined that the appointments were legally made. Washington ruled by veto. The 29 lacked the 30th vote they needed to override Washington's veto; female and African American aldermen supported Washington despite pressure from the Eddies. Meanwhile, in the courts, Washington kept the pressure on to reverse the redistricting of city council wards that the city council had created during the Byrne years. During special elections in 1986, victorious Washington-backed candidates in the first round ensured at least 24 supporters in the city council.  Six weeks later, when [[Marlene Carter]] and [[Luis Guti\u00e9rrez|Lu\u00eds Guti\u00e9rrez]] won run-off elections, Washington had the 25 aldermen he needed. His vote as president of the City Council enabled him to break 25\u201325 tie-votes and enact his programs.\n\n===1987 election===\nWashington defeated former mayor [[Jane Byrne]] in the February 24, 1987 Democratic mayoral primary by 7.2%, 53.5% to 46.3%, and in the April 7, 1987 mayoral general election defeated Vrdolyak (Illinois [[Solidarity Party (Illinois)|Solidarity Party]]) by 11.8%, 53.8% to 42.8%, with Northwestern University business professor Donald Haider (Republican) getting 4.3%, to win reelection to a second term as mayor. Cook County Assessor [[Thomas Hynes]] (Chicago First Party), a Daley ally, dropped out of the race 36 hours before the mayoral general election. During Washington's short second term, the Eddies lost much of their power: Vrdolyak became a Republican, Kelly was removed from his powerful parks post, and Burke lost his Finance Committee chairmanship.\n\n===Political Education Project (PEP)===\nFrom March 1984 to 1987, the Political Education Project (PEP)<ref>[http://www.chicagohistory.org/static_media/pdf/historyfair/washington_harold_and_the_machine.pdf Chicago History \u2013 PEP Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624032054/http://www.chicagohistory.org/static_media/pdf/historyfair/washington_harold_and_the_machine.pdf |date=June 24, 2016 }}</ref> served as Washington's political arm, organizing both Washington's campaigns and the campaigns of his political allies.

After failing to respond to numerous summons and subpoenas, the commission recommend a five-year suspension on March 18, 1968. A formal response to the charges did not occur until July 10, 1969. In his reply, Washington said that \"sometimes personal problems are enlarged out of proportion to the entire life picture at the time and the more important things are abandoned.\" In 1970, the Board of Managers of the [[Chicago Bar Association]] ruled that Washington's license be suspended for only one year, not the five recommended; the total amount in question between all six clients was $205.<ref name=\"levinsohn_146-152\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 146\u2013152.</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Washington was charged with failure to file tax returns for four years, although the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) claimed to have evidence for nineteen years. Judge [[Joseph Sam Perry|Sam Perry]] noted that he was \"disturbed that this case ever made it to my courtroom\" \u2014 while Washington had paid his taxes, he ended up owing the government a total of $508 as a result of not filing his returns. Typically, the IRS handled such cases in civil court, or within its bureaucracy.

Reverend I.M.D. Washington died in 1953.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brasfield |first1=Curtis |title=The Ancestry of Mayor Harold Washington |date=1993 |publisher=Heritage Books, Inc. |location=Bowie, Maryland |isbn=1-55613-750-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ancestryofmayorh00bras/page/14 14\u201322] |edition=First |url=https://archive.org/details/ancestryofmayorh00bras/page/14 }}</ref>\n===Early life and education===\nHarold Lee Washington was born on April 15, 1922 at [[Cook County Hospital]] in Chicago, Illinois,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBqmMkHK8BIC&pg=PA1|title=Harold Washington: Political Pioneer|first=Carole|last=Marsh|date=September 30, 2002|publisher=Gallopade International|accessdate=May 26, 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref> to Roy and Bertha Washington.

A lawyer, he became one of the first black [[precinct captain]]s in the city, and a [[Methodist]] minister.<ref>''Hamlish Levinsohn, p. 246'', relates that Washington identified himself with his grandfather and father Roy's Methodist background. ''Rivlin, p. 42'', notes that at age 4, Harold and his brother, 6, were sent to a private [[Benedictine]] school in Wisconsin. The arrangement lasted one week before they ran away from the school and hitchhiked home. After three more years and thirteen escapes, Roy placed Harold in Chicago city public schools.</ref> In 1918, daughter Geneva was born and second son Edward was born in 1920. Bertha left the family, possibly to seek her fortune as a singer, and the couple divorced in 1928.  Bertha remarried and had seven more children including Ramon Price, who was an artist and eventually became chief curator of [[The DuSable Museum of African American History]]. Harold Washington grew up in [[Douglas, Chicago#Bronzeville|Bronzeville]], a Chicago neighborhood that was the center of black culture for the entire Midwest in the early and middle 20th century. Edward and Harold stayed with their father while Roy Jr and Geneva were cared by grandparents. After attending St Benedict the Moor Boarding School in Milwaukee from 1928 to 1932, Washington attended [[DuSable High School]], then a newly established [[Racial segregation in the United States|racially segregated]] public high school, and was a member of its first graduating class. In a 1939 citywide track meet, Washington placed first in the 110-meter high hurdles event, and second in the 220-meter low hurdles event. Between his junior and senior year of high school, Washington dropped out, claiming that he no longer felt challenged by the coursework. He worked at a meatpacking plant for a time before his father helped him get a job at the [[U.S. Treasury]] branch in the city. There he met Nancy Dorothy Finch, whom he married soon after; Washington was 19 years old and Dorothy was 17 years old. Seven months later, the U.S. was drawn into [[World War II]] with the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]] by the Japanese on Sunday, December 7, 1941.\n\n===Military service===\nIn 1942, Washington was drafted into the [[United States Army]] for the war effort and after basic training, sent overseas as part of a [[African-American discrimination in the U.S. Military|racially segregated unit]] of the [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]] unit of [[Military engineer|Engineers]]. After the American invasion of the [[Philippines]] in 1944, on [[Leyte Island]] and later the main [[Luzon]] island, Washington was part of a unit building runways for bombers, protective fighter aircraft, refueling planes, and returning damaged aircraft. Eventually, Washington rose to the rank of [[First Sergeant]] in the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] (later in the war renamed the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]]).\n\n===Roosevelt College===\nIn the summer of 1946, Washington, aged 24 and a war veteran, enrolled at [[Roosevelt University|Roosevelt College]] (now Roosevelt University).<ref name=\"levinsohn_42-43\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 42\u201343.</ref> Washington joined other groups of students not permitted to enroll in other local colleges. Local estimates placed the student population of Roosevelt College at about 1/8&nbsp;black and 1/2&nbsp;Jewish. A full 75% of the students had enrolled because of the \"nondiscriminatory progressive principles.\"<ref name=\"levinsohn_42-43\" /> He chaired a fund-raising drive by students, and then was named to a committee that supported citywide efforts to outlaw  \"[[restrictive covenants]]\" in housing, the legal means by which minorities (especially blacks (\"negroes\") and, to a lesser extent, Jews) were prohibited from purchasing real estate in predominantly white neighborhoods of the city.<ref name=\"levinsohn_44\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), p. 44.</ref>\n\nIn 1948, after the college had moved to the [[Auditorium Building]], Washington was elected the third president of Roosevelt's student council. Under his leadership, the student council successfully petitioned the college to have student representation on Roosevelt's faculty committees. At the first regional meeting of the newly founded [[National Student Association]] in the spring of 1948, Washington and nine other delegates proposed student representation on college faculties, and a \"Bill of Rights\" for students; both measures were roundly defeated.<ref name=\"levinsohn_51-53\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 51\u201353.</ref> The next year, Washington went to the state capital at [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to protest [[Illinois State Legislature|Illinois legislators']] coming probe of \"subversives\". The probe of investigation would outlaw the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] and require \"loyalty oaths\" for teachers. He led students' opposition to the bills, although they would pass later in 1949.<ref name=\"levinsohn_51-53\" />\n\nDuring his Roosevelt College years, Washington came to be known for his stability. His friends said that he had a \"remarkable ability to keep cool\", reason carefully and walk a middle line. Washington intentionally avoided extremist activities, including street actions and sit-ins against racially segregated restaurants and businesses. Overall, Washington and other radical activists ended up sharing a mutual respect for each other, acknowledging both Washington's pragmatism and the activists' idealism. With the opportunities found only at Roosevelt College in the late 1940s, Washington's time at the Roosevelt College proved to be pivotal.<ref name=\"levinsohn_54-55,59,62\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 54\u201355, 59, 62.</ref> Washington graduated in August 1949, with a [[Bachelor of Arts|Bachelor of Arts (B.A.)]] degree. In addition to his activities at Roosevelt, he was a member of [[Phi Beta Sigma]] fraternity.<ref name=\"congbio\" /><ref name=\"levinsohn_63\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), p. 63.</ref>\n\n===Northwestern University School of Law===\nWashington then applied and was admitted to study law at the [[Northwestern University School of Law]] in Chicago. During this time, Washington was divorced from Dorothy Finch. By some accounts, Harold and Dorothy had simply grown apart after Washington was sent overseas during the war during the first year of his marriage. Others saw both as young and headstrong, the relationship doomed from the beginning. Another friend of Washington's deemed Harold \"not the marrying kind.\" He would not marry again, but continued to have relationships with other women; his longtime secretary is said to have said, \"If every woman Harold slept with stood at one end of [[Chicago City Hall|City Hall]], the building would sink five inches into [[LaSalle Street]]!\".<ref name=\"rivlin_53\">Rivlin (1992), p. 53.</ref>\n\nAt Northwestern Law School, Washington was the only black student in his class (there were six women in the class, one of them being [[Dawn Clark Netsch]]). As at Roosevelt, he entered school politics. In 1951, his last year, he was elected treasurer of the [[Student Bar Association|Junior Bar Association]] (JBA). The election was largely symbolic, however, and Washington's attempts to give the JBA more authority at Northwestern were largely unsuccessful.<ref name=\"levinsohn_66\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), p. 66.</ref> On campus, Washington joined the Nu Beta Epsilon fraternity, largely because he and the other minorities which constituted the fraternity were blatantly excluded from the other fraternities on campus. Overall, Washington stayed away from the activism that defined his years at Roosevelt. During the evenings and weekends, he worked to supplement his [[GI Bill]] income. He received his [[Juris Doctor|JD]] in 1952.<ref name=\"levinsohn_68-70\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 68\u201370.</ref>\n\n== Legislative political career ==\n\n=== Working for Metcalfe (1951\u20131965)===\nFrom 1951 until he was first slated for election in 1965, Washington worked in the offices of the 3rd Ward Alderman, former Olympic athlete [[Ralph Metcalfe]]. [[Richard J. Daley]] was elected party chairman in 1952. Daley replaced C.C. Wimbush, an ally of [[William L. Dawson (politician)|William Dawson]], on the party committee with Metcalfe. Under Metcalfe, the 3rd Ward was a critical factor in Mayor Daley's 1955 mayoral election victory and ranked first in the city in the size of its Democratic plurality in 1961.<ref name=\"levinsohn_75\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), p. 75.</ref> While working under Metcalfe, Washington began to organize the 3rd Ward's [[Young Democrats of America|Young Democrats]] (YD) organization. At YD conventions, the 3rd Ward would push for numerous resolutions in the interest of blacks. Eventually, other black YD organizations would come to the 3rd Ward headquarters for advice on how to run their own organizations. Like he had at Roosevelt College, Washington avoided radicalism and preferred to work through the party to engender change.<ref name=\"levinsohn_86-90\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 86\u201390.</ref>\n\nWhile working with the Young Democrats, Washington met Mary Ella Smith.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-11-27/features/8802190754_1_mary-ella-smith-mayor-harold-washington-late-mayor |title=Mary Ella Smith Still Keeps The Flame |accessdate=May 26, 2018}}</ref> They dated for the next 20 years, and in 1983 Washington proposed to Smith. In an interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, Smith said that she never pressed Washington for marriage because she knew Washington's first love was politics, saying, \"He was a political animal. He thrived on it, and I knew any thoughts of marriage would have to wait. I wasn't concerned about that. I just knew the day would come.\"<ref name=\"kup_19871227\">{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB36DA09871C50C&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |title=Kup on Sunday |author=Kup |date=December 27, 1987 |accessdate=February 15, 2008 |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref>\n\nIn 1959 Al Janney, Gus Savage, Lemuel Bentley, Bennett Johnson, Luster Jackson and others founded the Chicago League of Negro Voters, one of the first African-American political organizations in the city. In its first election, Bentley drew 60,000 votes for city clerk. The endorsement of the League was deciding factor in the re-election of Leon DesPres who was an independent voice in the City Council. Washington was a close friend of the founders of the League and worked with them from time to time. The League was key in electing Anna Langford, William Cousins and A. A. \"Sammy\" Rayner who were not part of the Daley machine. In 1963 the group moved to racially integrate and formed Protest at the Polls at a citywide conference which Washington independent candidates had gained traction within the black community, winning several aldermanic seats. In 1983, Protest at the Polls was instrumental in Washington's run for mayor. By then, the YDs were losing to \nindependent candidates.<ref name=\"levinsohn_91-92,97\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 91\u201392, 97.</ref>\n\n=== Illinois House (1965\u20131976) ===\nAfter the state legislature failed to reapportion districts as required by the census every ten years, an [[at-large]] election was held in January 1965 to elect 177 [[Illinois House of Representatives|representatives]]. With the Republicans and Democrats combining to slate only 118 candidates, independent voting groups seized the opportunity to slate candidates. The League of Negro Voters created a \"Third Slate\" of 59 candidates, announcing the slate on June 27, 1964. Shortly afterwards, Daley put together a slate including [[Adlai Stevenson III]] and Washington. The Third Slate was then thrown out by the Illinois Election Board because of \"insufficient signatures\" on the nominating petitions. In the election, Washington received the second-largest amount of ballots, behind Stevenson.<ref name=\"levinsohn_98-99\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 98\u201399.</ref> Washington's years in the Illinois House were marked by tension with Democratic Party leadership. In 1967, he was ranked by the [[Independent Voters of Illinois-Independent Precinct Organization|Independent Voters of Illinois]] (IVI) as the fourth-most independent legislator in the Illinois House and named Best Legislator of the Year. His defiance of the \"idiot card\", a sheet of paper that directed legislators' votes on every issue, attracted the attention of party leaders, who moved to remove Washington from his legislative position.<ref name=\"levinsohn_100-106\" /> Daley often told Metcalfe to dump Washington as a candidate, but Metcalfe did not want to risk losing the 3rd Ward's Young Democrats, who were mostly aligned with Washington.<ref name=\"rivlin_50-52\">Rivlin (1992), pp. 50\u201352.</ref>\n\nWashington backed [[Renault Robinson]], a black police officer and one of the founders of the [[Afro-American Patrolmen's League]] (AAPL). The aim of the AAPL was to fight racism directed against minority officers by the rest of the predominantly white department. Soon after the creation of the group, Robinson was written up for minor infractions, suspended, reinstated, and then placed on the graveyard shift to a single block behind central police headquarters. Robinson approached Washington to fashion a bill creating a civilian review board, consisting of both patrolmen and officers, to monitor police brutality. Both black independent and white liberal legislators refused to back the bill, afraid to challenge Daley's grip on the police force.<ref name=\"rivlin_50-52\" />\n\nAfter Washington announced he would support the AAPL, Metcalfe refused to protect him from Daley. Washington believed he had the support of [[John Touhy]], [[Speaker of the Illinois House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] and a former party chair. Instead, Touhy criticized Washington and then allayed Daley's anger. In exchange for the party's backing, Washington would serve on the Chicago Crime Commission, the group Daley formed to investigate the AAPL's charges. The commission promptly found the AAPL's charges \"unwarranted\". An angry and humiliated Washington admitted that on the commission, he felt like Daley's \"showcase ni***r\".<ref name=\"rivlin_50-52\" /> In 1969, Daley removed Washington's name from the slate; only by the intervention of [[Cecil Partee]], a party loyalist, was Washington reinstated. The Democratic Party supported Jim Taylor, a former professional boxer, Streets and Sanitation worker, over Washington. With Partee and his own ward's support, Washington defeated Taylor.<ref name=\"levinsohn_100-106\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 100\u2013106.</ref> His years in the House of Representatives were focused on becoming an advocate for black rights. He continued work on the Fair Housing Act, and worked to strengthen the state's Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC). In addition, he worked on a state Civil Rights Act, which would strengthen employment and housing provisions in the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. In his first session, all of his bills were sent to committee or tabled. Like his time in Roosevelt College, Washington relied on parliamentary tactics (e.g., writing amendments guaranteed to fail in a vote) to enable him to bargain for more concessions.<ref name=\"levinsohn_107-108\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 107\u2013108.</ref>\n\nWashington was accused of failure to file a tax return, even though the tax was paid.  He was found guilty and sentenced to 36 days in jail.

He passed a resolution honoring Metcalfe, his mentor. He also passed a resolution honoring [[James J. Reeb]], a Unitarian minister who was beaten to death in [[Selma, Alabama]] by a segregationist mob. After the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], he introduced a series of bills aimed at making King's birthday a state holiday.<ref>Travis, \"Harold,\" The Peoples Mayor, 81\u201382 ).</ref> The first was tabled and later vetoed. The third bill he introduced, which was passed and signed Gov. Richard Ogilvie, made Dr. King's birthday a commemorative day observed by Illinois public schools.<ref>Travis, \"Harold,\" The Peoples Mayor, 81\u201382.</ref> It was not until 1973 that Washington was able, with Partee's help in the Senate, to have the bill enacted and signed by the governor.<ref name=\"levinsohn_109-110\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 109\u2013110.</ref>\n\n====1975 speakership campaign====\nWashington ran a largely symbolic campaign for Speaker. He only received votes from himself and from [[Lewis A. H. Caldwell]].<ref name=\"levinsohn_a\"/> However, with a divided Democratic caucus, this was enough to help deny Daley-backed [[Clyde Choate]] the nomination, helping to throw it to [[William A. Redmond]] after 92 rounds of voting.<ref name=\"levinsohn_a\"/>\n\nRedmond had Washington appointed as chairman of the Judiciary Committee.<ref name=\"levinsohn_a\"/>\n\n===Illinois Senate (1976\u20131980)===\n====Campaign for Illinois Senate====\nIn 1975, Partee, now [[President of the Illinois Senate|President of the Senate]] and eligible for his pension, decided to retire from the Senate. Although Daley and Taylor declined at first, at Partee's insistence, Washington was ultimately slated for the seat and received the party's support.<ref name=\"levinsohn_121-122\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 121\u2013122.</ref> Daley had been displeased with Washington for having run a symbolic challenge in 1975 to Daley-backed [[Clyde Choate]] for Illinois Speaker of the House (Washington had only received two votes).<ref name=\"levinsohn_121-122\"/> He had also helped ultimately push the vote towards Redmond as a compromise candidate.<ref name=\"levinsohn_a\"/> The [[United Automobile Workers]] union, whose backing Washington obtained, were critical in persuading Daley to relent to back his candidacy.<ref name=\"levinsohn_a\"/>\n\nWashington defeated [[Anna Langford]] by nearly 2,000 votes in the Democratic primary.<ref name=\"levinsohn_a\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983)</ref> He went on to win the general election.\n\n====Human Rights Act of 1980====\nIn the [[Illinois Senate]], Washington's main focus worked to pass 1980's Illinois Human Rights Act. Legislators rewrote all of the human rights laws in the state, restricting discrimination based on \"race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, physical or mental disability, military status, sexual orientation, or unfavorable discharge from military service in connection with employment, real estate transactions, access to financial credit, and the availability of public accommodations.\"<ref name='ilcs'>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/ilcs5.asp?ActID=2266&ChapAct=775%26nbsp%3BILCS%26nbsp%3B5%2F&ChapterID=64&ChapterName=HUMAN+RIGHTS&ActName=Illinois+Human+Rights+Act. |year=1970 |accessdate=April 21, 2008 |author=Illinois General Assembly |title=(775 ILCS 5/) Illinois Human Rights Act.}}</ref> The bill's origins began in 1970 with the rewriting of the [[Illinois Constitution]]. The new constitution required all governmental agencies and departments to be reorganized for efficiency. Republican governor [[James R. Thompson]] reorganized low-profile departments before his re-election in 1978. In 1979, during the early stages of his second term and immediately in the aftermath of the largest vote for a gubernatorial candidate in the state's history, Thompson called for human rights reorganization.<ref name=\"levinsohn_130-131\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 130\u2013131.</ref> The bill would consolidate and remove some agencies, eliminating a number of political jobs. Some Democratic legislators would oppose any measure backed by Washington, Thompson and Republican legislators.\n\nFor many years, human rights had been a campaign issue brought up and backed by Democrats. Thompson's staffers brought the bill to Washington and other black legislators before it was presented to the legislature. Washington made adjustments in anticipation of some legislators' concerns regarding the bill, before speaking for it in April 1979. On May 24, 1979, the bill passed the Senate by a vote of 59 to 1, with two voting present and six absent. The victory in the Senate was attributed by a Thompson staffer to Washington's \"calm noncombative presentation\".<ref name=\"levinsohn_132-134\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 132\u2013134.</ref> However, the bill stalled in the House. State Representative [[Susan Catania]] insisted on attaching an amendment to allow women guarantees in the use of credit cards. This effort was assisted by [[Carol Moseley Braun]], a representative from [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] who would later go on to serve as a U.S. Senator. State Representatives Jim Taylor and Larry Bullock introduced over one hundred amendments, including the text of the first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution, to try to stall the bill. With Catania's amendment, the bill passed the House, but the Senate refused to accept the amendment. On June 30, 1979, the legislature adjourned.<ref name=\"levinsohn_132-134\" />\n\n===U.S. House (1981\u20131983)===\nIn 1980, Washington was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] in [[Illinois's 1st congressional district]].

Washington missed many House votes, an issue that would come up in his campaign for mayor in 1983.<ref name=\"levinsohn_166-172\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 166\u2013172.</ref> Washington's major congressional accomplishment involved legislation to extend the [[Voting Rights Act]], legislation that opponents had argued was only necessary in an emergency. Others, including Congressman [[Henry Hyde]], had submitted amendments designed to seriously weaken the power of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nAlthough he had been called \"crazy\" for railing in the House of Representatives against deep cuts to social programs, [[Associated Press]] political reporter Mike Robinson noted that Washington worked \"quietly and thoughtfully\" as the time came to pass the act. During hearings in the South regarding the Voting Rights Act, Washington asked questions that shed light on tactics used to prevent African Americans from voting (among them, closing registration early, literacy tests, and gerrymandering). After the amendments were submitted on the floor, Washington spoke from prepared speeches that avoided rhetoric and addressed the issues.  As a result, the amendments were defeated, and Congress passed the Voting Rights Act Extension.<ref name=\"levinsohn_172\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), p.172.</ref> By the time Washington faced re-election in 1982, he had cemented his popularity in the 1st Congressional District. Jane Byrne could not find one serious candidate to run against Washington for his re-election campaign. He had collected 250,000 signatures to get on the ballot, although only 610 signatures (0.5% of the voters in the previous election) were required. With his re-election to Congress locked up, Washington turned his attention to the next Chicago mayoral election.<ref name=\"levinsohn_176\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), p.176.</ref>\n\n==Mayor of Chicago (1983\u20131987)==\n[[File:Harold Washington (2592).jpg|thumb|right|Washington holds a press conference for his 1983 campaign at the [[Hyatt Regency Chicago]] on December 13, 1982.]]\n[[File:Harold Washington at the commissioning of USS Chicago (SSN-721) cropped.jpg|thumb|Harold Washington speaking at the commissioning of [[USS Chicago (SSN-721)|USS ''Chicago'' (SSN-721)]], September 1986.]]\n\n===1983 election ===\n<nowiki> </nowiki>In the February 22, 1983, Democratic mayoral primary, more than 100,000 new voters registered to vote led by a coalition that included the Latino reformed gang [[Young Lords]] led by [[Jose Cha Cha Jimenez]].

Harold Washington had massive majorities on the South and West Sides.  Southwest Side voters overwhelmingly supported Daley. Washington won with 37% of the vote, versus 33% for Byrne and 30% for Daley. Although winning the Democratic primary was normally considered [[tantamount to election]] in heavily Democratic Chicago, after his primary victory Washington found that his [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opponent, former state legislator [[Bernard Epton]] (earlier considered a nominal stand-in), was supported by many high-ranking Democrats and their ward organizations, including the chairman of the [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] Democratic Party, Alderman [[Edward Vrdolyak]].<ref name=\"davis_19830412\">{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-chicagodays-haroldwashington-story,0,1660876.story |title=The election of Harold Washington the first black mayor of Chicago |author=Davis, Robert |date=April 12, 1983 |accessdate=February 16, 2008 |newspaper=Chicago Tribune}}</ref>\n\nEpton's campaign referred to, among other things, Washington's conviction for failure to file [[income tax]] returns (he had paid the taxes, but had not filed a return). Washington, on the other hand, stressed reforming the Chicago patronage system and the need for a jobs program in a tight economy. In the April 12, 1983, mayoral general election, Washington defeated Epton by 3.7%, 51.7% to 48.0%, to become mayor of Chicago. Washington was sworn in as mayor on April 29, 1983, and resigned his Congressional seat the following day.\n\n=== First term and Council Wars ===\nDuring his tenure as mayor, Washington lived at the [[Hampton House (Chicago, Illinois)|Hampton House]] apartments in the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] neighborhood of Chicago. He created the city's first environmental-affairs department under the management of longtime Great Lakes environmentalist [[Lee Botts]]. Washington's first term in office was characterized by conflict with the city council dubbed \"[[Council Wars]]\", referring to the then-recent ''[[Star Wars]]'' films and caused Chicago to be nicknamed \"[[Beirut]] on the [[Lake Michigan|Lake]]\". A 29-alderman City Council majority refused to enact Washington's legislation and prevented him from appointing nominees to boards and commissions. First-term challenges included city population loss and a massive decrease in ridership on the [[Chicago Transit Authority]] (CTA).{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Assertions that the overall crime rate increased were incorrect.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/84/harold|title=Harold|work=This American Life|access-date=November 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe 29, also known as the \"Vrdolyak 29\", were led by Vrdolyak (who was an Alderman in addition to Cook County Democratic Party chairman) and Finance Chair, Alderman [[Edward M.

The three were known as \"the Eddies\" and were supported by the younger Daley (now State's Attorney), U.S. Congressmen [[Dan Rostenkowski]] and [[William Lipinski]], and much of the Democratic Party. During his first city council meeting, Washington and the 21 supportive aldermen walked out of the meeting after a quorum had been established. Vrdolyak and the other 28 then chose committee chairmen and assigned aldermen to the various committees. Later lawsuits submitted by Washington and others were dismissed because it was determined that the appointments were legally made. Washington ruled by veto. The 29 lacked the 30th vote they needed to override Washington's veto; female and African American aldermen supported Washington despite pressure from the Eddies. Meanwhile, in the courts, Washington kept the pressure on to reverse the redistricting of city council wards that the city council had created during the Byrne years. During special elections in 1986, victorious Washington-backed candidates in the first round ensured at least 24 supporters in the city council.  Six weeks later, when [[Marlene Carter]] and [[Luis Guti\u00e9rrez|Lu\u00eds Guti\u00e9rrez]] won run-off elections, Washington had the 25 aldermen he needed. His vote as president of the City Council enabled him to break 25\u201325 tie-votes and enact his programs.\n\n===1987 election===\nWashington defeated former mayor [[Jane Byrne]] in the February 24, 1987 Democratic mayoral primary by 7.2%, 53.5% to 46.3%, and in the April 7, 1987 mayoral general election defeated Vrdolyak (Illinois [[Solidarity Party (Illinois)|Solidarity Party]]) by 11.8%, 53.8% to 42.8%, with Northwestern University business professor Donald Haider (Republican) getting 4.3%, to win reelection to a second term as mayor. Cook County Assessor [[Thomas Hynes]] (Chicago First Party), a Daley ally, dropped out of the race 36 hours before the mayoral general election. During Washington's short second term, the Eddies lost much of their power: Vrdolyak became a Republican, Kelly was removed from his powerful parks post, and Burke lost his Finance Committee chairmanship.\n\n===Political Education Project (PEP)===\nFrom March 1984 to 1987, the Political Education Project (PEP)<ref>[http://www.chicagohistory.org/static_media/pdf/historyfair/washington_harold_and_the_machine.pdf Chicago History \u2013 PEP Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624032054/http://www.chicagohistory.org/static_media/pdf/historyfair/washington_harold_and_the_machine.pdf |date=June 24, 2016 }}</ref> served as Washington's political arm, organizing both Washington's campaigns and the campaigns of his political allies.

In her biography, Levinsohn questions whether the timing of Washington's legal troubles was politically motivated. In November 1966, Washington was re-elected to the House over Daley's strong objections; the first complaint was filed in 1964; the second was filed by January 1967.<ref name=levinsohn_143-144>Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 143\u2013144.</ref> A letter asking Washington to explain the matter was sent on January 5, 1967. After failing to respond to numerous summons and subpoenas, the commission recommend a five-year suspension on March 18, 1968. A formal response to the charges did not occur until July 10, 1969. In his reply, Washington said that \"sometimes personal problems are enlarged out of proportion to the entire life picture at the time and the more important things are abandoned.\" In 1970, the Board of Managers of the [[Chicago Bar Association]] ruled that Washington's license be suspended for only one year, not the five recommended; the total amount in question between all six clients was $205.<ref name=\"levinsohn_146-152\">Hamlish Levinsohn (1983), pp. 146\u2013152.</ref>\n\nIn 1971, Washington was charged with failure to file tax returns for four years, although the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) claimed to have evidence for nineteen years. Judge [[Joseph Sam Perry|Sam Perry]] noted that he was \"disturbed that this case ever made it to my courtroom\" \u2014 while Washington had paid his taxes, he ended up owing the government a total of $508 as a result of not filing his returns. Typically, the IRS handled such cases in civil court, or within its bureaucracy.
