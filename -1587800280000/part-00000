[[User:GreenC_bot/Job_18]]}}</ref>\n\nHealthCorps believes that through [[service learning]], the students share some of the messaging with their friends and parents\u2014thus increasing the reach of HealthCorps' message.\n\nOutside of schools, HealthCorps engages in several community events such as health fairs, Martin Luther King Day of Service, Mealtime Blessings and the National Night of Conversation.\n\n== History ==\nHealthCorps was designed in 2003 as a 10-month pilot in partnership with Columbia Presbyterian Hospital as a response to \u201cHealthy People 2010\u201d \u2013 an initiative of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to advance a nationwide disease prevention agenda that included fighting childhood obesity. As a result, cardiothoracic surgeon Mehmet Oz and his wife, Lisa, founded the educational program based upon the pilot under the auspices of the Foundation for Advanced Cardiac Therapies (\u201cFACT\u201d), a Palm Beach, Florida-based 501c3 organization.\n\nIn 2004, HealthCorps launched a lunchtime workshop at George Washington Educational Campus in Washington Heights, New York, led by \u201cHealthCorps Coordinators\u201d \u2013 recent college graduates with an interest in health careers who serve as peer-mentors. These Coordinators were trained and supervised by staff from the Touro College Children's Health Education Foundation. A second school, [[Cathedral High School (New York City)|Cathedral High School]] in Manhattan, was added to the pilot in 2005. By 2006, the HealthCorps network grew to six schools in New York City as well as the [[Academy of the New Church Secondary Schools|Academy of the New Church]] in [[Pennsylvania]], and two schools in [[New Jersey]] Cliffside Park High School and North Bergen High School.\n\nHealthCorps chose youth as its major focus in order to maximize the impact of its programming. Teenagers are often: significant family purchase influencers, family caregivers and autonomous buyers with some expendable income. They also have great capacity to influence a large network of peers.<sup>[<nowiki/>[[wikipedia:Citation needed|''citation needed'']]]</sup>\n\n===Original Programming and First Written Curriculum===\nIn 2007, HealthCorps embarked on a national roll-out, extending its health education and mentoring program to 36 schools, including 29 in New York City, two in New Jersey, one in Florida, and one in Pennsylvania. In the same year, the organization incorporated as a 501(c)3 in New York under its own name \u201cHealthCorps, Inc.\u201d and closed out the Florida-based 501(c)3, FACT. By this time all Coordinators were expected to serve full-time, five days a week during the school year teaching both in and out of the classroom. HealthCorps realized that along with delivering curriculum, the program and its network of schools serve as a unique opportunity for discovery of how best to communicate with and understand teens, identify best practices for behavioral change and identify effective regional, state and federal school policy; thus, the name \u201cLiving Labs\u201d.\n\nTo meet the demands of a thriving program, HealthCorps staff and Board members developed the first written curriculum - combining lessons created by the original nine Coordinators with content from the YOU\u2122 book series authored by HealthCorps Chairman Dr. Mehmet Oz and Advisory Board Member Dr. Michael Roizen of the Cleveland Clinic.<sup>[<nowiki/>[[wikipedia:Citation needed|''citation needed'']]]`</sup>\n\n===Curriculum Enhancements===\nSince 2008, as HealthCorps continued to expand into more schools across the US, the curriculum has been regularly enhanced and updated. HealthCorps staff, board members, and Coordinators are vital to curriculum creation and have edited lessons based on their expertise or practical experiences in the classroom. In order to further enhance the curriculum components, HealthCorps has partnered with evidence-based programs such as Atkins Nutritionals, Alliance for a Healthier Generation, Sahaja Meditation, Share our Strength/Cooking Matters, Baptiste Foundation, Smarter Lunchrooms, the Chickasaw Nation, and Recover Circle.\n\nThrough the HealthCorps curriculum evolution, emphasis is increasingly placed on students developing knowledge as well as skills. Research has demonstrated that developing skills is key to supporting behavioral changes for all ages.\n\nThe HealthCorps curriculum aims to enable students to not only better care for their own physical and mental health but also improve wellness in their communities. It focuses on three pillars of health: mental resilience, nutrition and fitness. In addition, the curriculum includes lessons that cover a wide range of other health issues, such as bullying, family meal times, and diabetes.\n\nChapters in the current curriculum include:\n\n# About HealthCorps: This chapter relays the history and evolution of the HealthCorps curriculum. It also introduces readers to the structure of the curriculum to better enable them to navigate the FlexBook.\n# Healthy Me Journey: This chapter discusses the Healthy Me Journey that encourages readers to make healthier choices and form healthy habits aligned with HealthCorps\u2019 Wellness Guidelines, adapted from the USDA Dietary Guidelines. \n# Eat Good Food: This chapter teaches skills that can be used to identify, access, and choose nutritious foods. \n# Build My Body: This chapter teaches the importance of physical activity and the skills that would enable readers to become more physically active.\n# Make My Mind Strong: This chapter teaches skills that can be used to help readers become more mental resilient in hopes of helping readers re-position life challenges as opportunities for growth.\n# Live My Healthy Live: This chapter teaches the skills that readers can use to improve and maintain their general wellness, such as practicing better self-care, better understanding substance abuse, and preventing or coping with chronic illnesses.\n# Make My World Well: This chapter teaches the life-saving skills readers can use to improve the health of their communities, such as the importance of organ donation.\n# Cafe O Yea<sup>TM</sup>: Cafe O' Yea is a fun skill-building activity with measurable outcomes that facilitators may employ to complement the in-classroom education to impact more students, staff and community members. These activities allow facilitators to share skills that they have learned about the Wellness Guidelines in high-trafficked areas of the school during lunch, special events and recreational time.\n\nIn classrooms, Coordinators lead lessons from the curriculum that introduce students to health topics though interactive activities and discussions that are not only informative but also engaging.\n\nOn the individual level, the curriculum and activities are intended to build resilience and leadership skills as well as raise awareness of healthy behaviors and foster positive change. On the school and community level, HealthCorps programs are intended to promote positive changes to the policies, systems and environments\u2013 and to ultimately be absorbed into the culture of the community.<sup>[<nowiki/>[[wikipedia:Citation needed|''citation needed'']]]</sup>\n\n===Extracurricular Activities===\nIn addition to teaching in classrooms, coordinators encourage learning by other activities. Coordinators plan and participate in school-wide and community extracurricular activities such as health fairs, walking contests, staff development seminars, gardening, food demonstrations, service projects and after school clubs (e.g. cooking, fitness and youth empowerment). HealthCorps activities challenge students to share the knowledge and skills they have learned with their friends, families and communities and to change their world for the better. School and community-wide activities are interspersed throughout the school year as a part of the HealthCorps experience to enhance lessons taught in the classroom.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js9cQJaEfBY&list=PLY05JxZoSB3svcLTXVu_VQHiKwR8GFRW8&index=20|title=HealthCorps: George Washington Educational Campus Health Fair (2011)|last=HealthCorps|date=January 19, 2011|publisher=|access-date=April 30, 2017|via=YouTube}} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/858500281 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/858497729 cite #7 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template. [[User:GreenC_bot/Job_18]]}}</ref>\n\n===Programming Enhancements===\nIn fall 2012, in response to requests from educators for training in the curriculum, HealthCorps piloted a staff training program called \u201cHealthCorps University\u201d in California with the Sacramento Unified School District. The program was chosen as one of twelve to receive pro bono consulting services to affirm its efficacy as a part of the Morgan Stanley Strategy Challenge.\n\nEach HealthCorps Living Lab also partners with mission-aligned organizations on a local level such as MD Anderson Cancer Institute\u2019s ASPIRE Program (Houston, Texas, 2013\u20132016) and The Sacramento Food Bank (Sacramento, CA, 2010).<sup>[<nowiki/>[[wikipedia:Citation needed|''citation needed'']]]</sup>\n\n===Scale===\nSince its inception in 2003, through all of its programs (HealthCorps University and the Living Labs Regional and Single School/Site models) HealthCorps has impacted approximately 2.3 million students. To date, 400 young people have served as Coordinators, the majority of whom have gone on to medical school. Also, almost 200 middle or high schools in 20 states across America have served as Living Labs.<sup>[<nowiki/>[[wikipedia:Citation needed|''citation needed'']]]</sup>\n\n=== Current Curriculum ===\nThis 5th edition of the HealthCorps curriculum was significantly enhanced as the result of a research partnership begun in 2013 in partnership with the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Family Cook Productions. The project was funded by the National Institutes of Health (\u201cNIH\u201d) through the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (\u201cNIDKK\u201d). One of the key project objectives is to disseminate the USDA Dietary Guidelines for adolescents and utilize student leaders to share skill-based strategies for adhering to them to make these healthy behaviors more socially desirable among youth. This was accomplished in part by designing anonline health behavior survey that produces a personalized assessment,\u201cHealthy Me Snapshot\u201d (HMS), for each participant. The HMS identifies which Dietary Guideline(s) a given participant should prioritize to improve and supports students to target this behavior by setting specific, measurable, actionable, realistic and timely (\u201cSMART\u201d) goals. This assessment and goal-setting system has now been incorporated into this edition of the HealthCorps curriculum and eight of the core lessons focus on Dietary Guidelines.\n\nCoordinators in Living Lab schools around the country deliver Healthy Me Journey (see Chapter 2 under \u201cCurriculum Enhancements\u201d above) and administer the Healthy Me Snapshot survey to students prior to administering other chapters. Students set and work towards a health SMART goal throughout the duration of the program. Coordinators administer the Healthy Me Reflection exercise to students after they have participated in the Core Curriculum Units (Chapters 2-5 as noted under \u201cCurriculum Enhancements\u201d above). Each unit of the core curriculum relies on the performance indicators of the National Health Education Standards and the Characteristics of Effective Health Education, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most students participate in the chapter units on a weekly basis over the course of a semester.\n\n=== Digital Curriculum ===\nIn 2013, HealthCorps joined forces with CK-12, a non-profit that has created a digital platform (<nowiki>http://www.ck12.org</nowiki>) providing free and customizable K-12 educational resources. HealthCorps and CK-12 envisioned their strategic partnership would increase engagement with and access to the HealthCorps free curriculum. Currently, HealthCorps\u2019 free online textbook, '''''HealthCorps - Skills For A Healthy Me''''', is hosted on the site: <nowiki>https://www.ck12.org/tebook/HealthCorps-Skills-For-A-Healthy-Me/</nowiki>.\n\n===Evaluation and Research===\nAs of 2018, research and program evaluation conducted and funded by Affinity Health Plans[1], the NIH/NIDKK/Albert Einstein School of Medicine[2, 3] have demonstrated that weekly participation in HealthCorps through the curriculum is associated with increased physical activity, self-confidence, consumption of fruit, vegetables and water and decreased consumption of soda. Research and evaluation have also shown that HealthCorps is significantly impactful working with other non-profit programming to enhance their outcomes (FamilyCook Productions [5], MD Anderson Cancer Institute [6]). Evaluating the quantitative and qualitative effects of both the HealthCorps Living Labs and HealthCorps University programs is an ongoing process aimed at ensuring greater impact into the future.\n----[1] \"Effect of HealthCorps, a High School Peer Mentoring Program, on Youth Diet and Physical Activity\", Childhood Obesity, 2011, John Cawley, PhD\n\n[2] \"Behaviors and Knowledge of HealthCorps New York City High School Students: Nutrition, Mental Health, and Physical Activity\", Journal of School Health, 2015, MoonseongHeo, PhD\n\n[3] \u201cEffective nationwide school-based participatory extramural program on adolescent body mass index, health knowledge and behaviors\u201d, BMC Pediatrics, 2018, MoonseongHeo, PhD\n\n[4] \"Impact of HealthCorps Program in the Western & Eastern Coachella Valley\", Evaluation Report for Desert HealthCare, Joanne Stevelos, MPH\n\n[5] \"Efficacy of Teen Battle Chef program to shift the Academic Performance and Health Behaviors in NYC High School Students\", Abstract, AHA Scientific Session, 2014, Hyunwoo Park, MS\n\n[6] \"The Role of a Mentor and Champion in Implementing ASPIRE (A Smoking Prevention Interactive Experience)\", Abstract, National Tobacco or Health Conference, Austin 2016, Alexander Prokhorov, MD, PhD\n\n=== Impact ===\nStudies published in ''[[BioMed Central]]'' (2018), ''[[Journal of School Health]]'' (2014), and ''[[Childhood Obesity (journal)|Childhood Obesity]]'' (2011) evaluated the effects of the HealthCorps program on health knowledge and behaviors.

[[User:GreenC_bot/Job_18]]}}</ref>\n\nHealthCorps believes that through [[service learning]], the students share some of the messaging with their friends and parents\u2014thus increasing the reach of HealthCorps' message.\n\nOutside of schools, HealthCorps engages in several community events such as health fairs, Martin Luther King Day of Service, Mealtime Blessings and the National Night of Conversation.\n\n== History ==\nHealthCorps was designed in 2003 as a 10-month pilot in partnership with Columbia Presbyterian Hospital as a response to \u201cHealthy People 2010\u201d \u2013 an initiative of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to advance a nationwide disease prevention agenda that included fighting childhood obesity. As a result, cardiothoracic surgeon Mehmet Oz and his wife, Lisa, founded the educational program based upon the pilot under the auspices of the Foundation for Advanced Cardiac Therapies (\u201cFACT\u201d), a Palm Beach, Florida-based 501c3 organization.\n\nIn 2004, HealthCorps launched a lunchtime workshop at George Washington Educational Campus in Washington Heights, New York, led by \u201cHealthCorps Coordinators\u201d \u2013 recent college graduates with an interest in health careers who serve as peer-mentors. These Coordinators were trained and supervised by staff from the Touro College Children's Health Education Foundation. A second school, [[Cathedral High School (New York City)|Cathedral High School]] in Manhattan, was added to the pilot in 2005. By 2006, the HealthCorps network grew to six schools in New York City as well as the [[Academy of the New Church Secondary Schools|Academy of the New Church]] in [[Pennsylvania]], and two schools in [[New Jersey]] Cliffside Park High School and North Bergen High School.\n\nHealthCorps chose youth as its major focus in order to maximize the impact of its programming. Teenagers are often: significant family purchase influencers, family caregivers and autonomous buyers with some expendable income. They also have great capacity to influence a large network of peers.<sup>[<nowiki/>[[wikipedia:Citation needed|''citation needed'']]]</sup>\n\n===Original Programming and First Written Curriculum===\nIn 2007, HealthCorps embarked on a national roll-out, extending its health education and mentoring program to 36 schools, including 29 in New York City, two in New Jersey, one in Florida, and one in Pennsylvania. In the same year, the organization incorporated as a 501(c)3 in New York under its own name \u201cHealthCorps, Inc.\u201d and closed out the Florida-based 501(c)3, FACT. By this time all Coordinators were expected to serve full-time, five days a week during the school year teaching both in and out of the classroom. HealthCorps realized that along with delivering curriculum, the program and its network of schools serve as a unique opportunity for discovery of how best to communicate with and understand teens, identify best practices for behavioral change and identify effective regional, state and federal school policy; thus, the name \u201cLiving Labs\u201d.\n\nTo meet the demands of a thriving program, HealthCorps staff and Board members developed the first written curriculum - combining lessons created by the original nine Coordinators with content from the YOU\u2122 book series authored by HealthCorps Chairman Dr. Mehmet Oz and Advisory Board Member Dr. Michael Roizen of the Cleveland Clinic.<sup>[<nowiki/>[[wikipedia:Citation needed|''citation needed'']]]`</sup>\n\n===Curriculum Enhancements===\nSince 2008, as HealthCorps continued to expand into more schools across the US, the curriculum has been regularly enhanced and updated. HealthCorps staff, board members, and Coordinators are vital to curriculum creation and have edited lessons based on their expertise or practical experiences in the classroom. In order to further enhance the curriculum components, HealthCorps has partnered with evidence-based programs such as Atkins Nutritionals, Alliance for a Healthier Generation, Sahaja Meditation, Share our Strength/Cooking Matters, Baptiste Foundation, Smarter Lunchrooms, the Chickasaw Nation, and Recover Circle.\n\nThrough the HealthCorps curriculum evolution, emphasis is increasingly placed on students developing knowledge as well as skills. Research has demonstrated that developing skills is key to supporting behavioral changes for all ages.\n\nThe HealthCorps curriculum aims to enable students to not only better care for their own physical and mental health but also improve wellness in their communities. It focuses on three pillars of health: mental resilience, nutrition and fitness. In addition, the curriculum includes lessons that cover a wide range of other health issues, such as bullying, family meal times, and diabetes.\n\nChapters in the current curriculum include:\n\n# About HealthCorps: This chapter relays the history and evolution of the HealthCorps curriculum. It also introduces readers to the structure of the curriculum to better enable them to navigate the FlexBook.\n# Healthy Me Journey: This chapter discusses the Healthy Me Journey that encourages readers to make healthier choices and form healthy habits aligned with HealthCorps\u2019 Wellness Guidelines, adapted from the USDA Dietary Guidelines. \n# Eat Good Food: This chapter teaches skills that can be used to identify, access, and choose nutritious foods. \n# Build My Body: This chapter teaches the importance of physical activity and the skills that would enable readers to become more physically active.\n# Make My Mind Strong: This chapter teaches skills that can be used to help readers become more mental resilient in hopes of helping readers re-position life challenges as opportunities for growth.\n# Live My Healthy Live: This chapter teaches the skills that readers can use to improve and maintain their general wellness, such as practicing better self-care, better understanding substance abuse, and preventing or coping with chronic illnesses.\n# Make My World Well: This chapter teaches the life-saving skills readers can use to improve the health of their communities, such as the importance of organ donation.\n# Cafe O Yea<sup>TM</sup>: Cafe O' Yea is a fun skill-building activity with measurable outcomes that facilitators may employ to complement the in-classroom education to impact more students, staff and community members. These activities allow facilitators to share skills that they have learned about the Wellness Guidelines in high-trafficked areas of the school during lunch, special events and recreational time.\n\nIn classrooms, Coordinators lead lessons from the curriculum that introduce students to health topics though interactive activities and discussions that are not only informative but also engaging.\n\nOn the individual level, the curriculum and activities are intended to build resilience and leadership skills as well as raise awareness of healthy behaviors and foster positive change. On the school and community level, HealthCorps programs are intended to promote positive changes to the policies, systems and environments\u2013 and to ultimately be absorbed into the culture of the community.<sup>[<nowiki/>[[wikipedia:Citation needed|''citation needed'']]]</sup>\n\n===Extracurricular Activities===\nIn addition to teaching in classrooms, coordinators encourage learning by other activities. Coordinators plan and participate in school-wide and community extracurricular activities such as health fairs, walking contests, staff development seminars, gardening, food demonstrations, service projects and after school clubs (e.g. cooking, fitness and youth empowerment). HealthCorps activities challenge students to share the knowledge and skills they have learned with their friends, families and communities and to change their world for the better. School and community-wide activities are interspersed throughout the school year as a part of the HealthCorps experience to enhance lessons taught in the classroom.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js9cQJaEfBY&list=PLY05JxZoSB3svcLTXVu_VQHiKwR8GFRW8&index=20|title=HealthCorps: George Washington Educational Campus Health Fair (2011)|last=HealthCorps|date=January 19, 2011|publisher=|access-date=April 30, 2017|via=YouTube}} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/858500281 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/858497729 cite #7 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template. [[User:GreenC_bot/Job_18]]}}</ref>\n\n===Programming Enhancements===\nIn fall 2012, in response to requests from educators for training in the curriculum, HealthCorps piloted a staff training program called \u201cHealthCorps University\u201d in California with the Sacramento Unified School District. The program was chosen as one of twelve to receive pro bono consulting services to affirm its efficacy as a part of the Morgan Stanley Strategy Challenge.\n\nEach HealthCorps Living Lab also partners with mission-aligned organizations on a local level such as MD Anderson Cancer Institute\u2019s ASPIRE Program (Houston, Texas, 2013\u20132016) and The Sacramento Food Bank (Sacramento, CA, 2010).<sup>[<nowiki/>[[wikipedia:Citation needed|''citation needed'']]]</sup>\n\n===Scale===\nSince its inception in 2003, through all of its programs (HealthCorps University and the Living Labs Regional and Single School/Site models) HealthCorps has impacted approximately 2.3 million students. To date, 400 young people have served as Coordinators, the majority of whom have gone on to medical school. Also, almost 200 middle or high schools in 20 states across America have served as Living Labs.<sup>[<nowiki/>[[wikipedia:Citation needed|''citation needed'']]]</sup>\n\n=== Current Curriculum ===\nThis 5th edition of the HealthCorps curriculum was significantly enhanced as the result of a research partnership begun in 2013 in partnership with the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Family Cook Productions. The project was funded by the National Institutes of Health (\u201cNIH\u201d) through the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (\u201cNIDKK\u201d). One of the key project objectives is to disseminate the USDA Dietary Guidelines for adolescents and utilize student leaders to share skill-based strategies for adhering to them to make these healthy behaviors more socially desirable among youth. This was accomplished in part by designing anonline health behavior survey that produces a personalized assessment,\u201cHealthy Me Snapshot\u201d (HMS), for each participant. The HMS identifies which Dietary Guideline(s) a given participant should prioritize to improve and supports students to target this behavior by setting specific, measurable, actionable, realistic and timely (\u201cSMART\u201d) goals. This assessment and goal-setting system has now been incorporated into this edition of the HealthCorps curriculum and eight of the core lessons focus on Dietary Guidelines.\n\nCoordinators in Living Lab schools around the country deliver Healthy Me Journey (see Chapter 2 under \u201cCurriculum Enhancements\u201d above) and administer the Healthy Me Snapshot survey to students prior to administering other chapters. Students set and work towards a health SMART goal throughout the duration of the program. Coordinators administer the Healthy Me Reflection exercise to students after they have participated in the Core Curriculum Units (Chapters 2-5 as noted under \u201cCurriculum Enhancements\u201d above). Each unit of the core curriculum relies on the performance indicators of the National Health Education Standards and the Characteristics of Effective Health Education, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most students participate in the chapter units on a weekly basis over the course of a semester.\n\n=== Digital Curriculum ===\nIn 2013, HealthCorps joined forces with CK-12, a non-profit that has created a digital platform (<nowiki>http://www.ck12.org</nowiki>) providing free and customizable K-12 educational resources. HealthCorps and CK-12 envisioned their strategic partnership would increase engagement with and access to the HealthCorps free curriculum. Currently, HealthCorps\u2019 free online textbook, '''''HealthCorps - Skills For A Healthy Me''''', is hosted on the site: <nowiki>https://www.ck12.org/tebook/HealthCorps-Skills-For-A-Healthy-Me/</nowiki>.\n\n===Evaluation and Research===\nAs of 2018, research and program evaluation conducted and funded by Affinity Health Plans[1], the NIH/NIDKK/Albert Einstein School of Medicine[2, 3] have demonstrated that weekly participation in HealthCorps through the curriculum is associated with increased physical activity, self-confidence, consumption of fruit, vegetables and water and decreased consumption of soda. Research and evaluation have also shown that HealthCorps is significantly impactful working with other non-profit programming to enhance their outcomes (FamilyCook Productions [5], MD Anderson Cancer Institute [6]). Evaluating the quantitative and qualitative effects of both the HealthCorps Living Labs and HealthCorps University programs is an ongoing process aimed at ensuring greater impact into the future.\n----[1] \"Effect of HealthCorps, a High School Peer Mentoring Program, on Youth Diet and Physical Activity\", Childhood Obesity, 2011, John Cawley, PhD\n\n[2] \"Behaviors and Knowledge of HealthCorps New York City High School Students: Nutrition, Mental Health, and Physical Activity\", Journal of School Health, 2015, MoonseongHeo, PhD\n\n[3] \u201cEffective nationwide school-based participatory extramural program on adolescent body mass index, health knowledge and behaviors\u201d, BMC Pediatrics, 2018, MoonseongHeo, PhD\n\n[4] \"Impact of HealthCorps Program in the Western & Eastern Coachella Valley\", Evaluation Report for Desert HealthCare, Joanne Stevelos, MPH\n\n[5] \"Efficacy of Teen Battle Chef program to shift the Academic Performance and Health Behaviors in NYC High School Students\", Abstract, AHA Scientific Session, 2014, Hyunwoo Park, MS\n\n[6] \"The Role of a Mentor and Champion in Implementing ASPIRE (A Smoking Prevention Interactive Experience)\", Abstract, National Tobacco or Health Conference, Austin 2016, Alexander Prokhorov, MD, PhD\n\n=== Impact ===\nStudies published in ''[[BioMed Central]]'' (2018), ''[[Journal of School Health]]'' (2014) and ''[[Childhood Obesity]]'' (2011) evaluated the effects of the HealthCorps program on health knowledge and behaviors.

An ardent believer in British [[imperialism]] and white supremacy Rhodes and his [[British South Africa Company]] founded the southern African territory of [[Rhodesia (region)|Rhodesia]] (now Zimbabwe and Zambia), which the company named after him in 1895. South Africa's [[Rhodes University]] is also named after him. Rhodes set up the provisions of the [[Rhodes Scholarship]], which is funded by his estate. He also put much effort towards his vision of a [[Cape to Cairo Railway]] through British territory.{{sfn|R\u00f6nnb\u00e4ck|Broberg|2019|p=30}}\n\nThe son of a [[vicar]], Rhodes was born at [[Rhodes Arts Complex|Netteswell House]], [[Bishop's Stortford]], Hertfordshire. Growing up in Hertfordshire, he was a sickly child. He was sent to South Africa by his family when he was 17 years old in the hope that the climate might improve his health. He entered the diamond trade at [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] in 1871, when he was 18, and over the next two decades gained near-complete domination of the world diamond market. His [[De Beers]] diamond company, formed in 1888, retains its prominence into the 21st century. Rhodes entered the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape Parliament]] at the age of 27 in 1880, and a decade later became Prime Minister.

The land was unsuitable for cotton, and the venture failed.\n\nIn October 1871, 18-year-old Rhodes and his 26-year-old brother Herbert left the colony for the diamond fields of [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] in Northern Cape Province. Financed by [[N M Rothschild & Sons]], Rhodes succeeded over the next 17 years in buying up all the smaller diamond mining operations in the Kimberley area.\n\nHis monopoly of the world's diamond supply was sealed in 1890 through a strategic partnership with the London-based Diamond Syndicate. They agreed to control world supply to maintain high prices.{{sfn|Epstein|1982|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}{{sfn|Knowles|2005|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}} Rhodes supervised the working of his brother's claim and [[speculation|speculated]] on his behalf. Among his associates in the early days were [[John X. Merriman]] and [[Charles Rudd]], who later became his partner in the [[De Beers|De Beers Mining Company]] and the Niger Oil Company.\n\nDuring the 1880s, [[Boschendal|Cape vineyards]] had been devastated by a [[phylloxera]] epidemic. The diseased vineyards were dug up and replanted, and farmers were looking for alternatives to wine. In 1892, Rhodes financed The [[Pioneer Fruit Growing Company]] at [[Nooitgedacht, South Africa|Nooitgedacht]], a venture created by Harry Pickstone, an Englishman who had experience with fruit-growing in California.{{sfn|Boschendal|2007|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}  The shipping magnate [[Percy Molteno]] had just undertaken the first successful refrigerated export to Europe.

He was admitted to [[Oriel College, Oxford]], but stayed for only one term in 1873. He returned to South Africa and did not return for his second term at Oxford until 1876. He was greatly influenced by [[John Ruskin]]'s inaugural lecture at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], which reinforced his own attachment to the cause of British [[imperialism]].\n\nAmong his Oxford associates were [[James Rochfort Maguire]], later a fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]] and a director of the [[British South Africa Company]], and Charles Metcalfe {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}.

Before his departure for Oxford, he and C.D. Rudd had moved from the [[Big Hole|Kimberley Mine]] to invest in the more costly claims of what was known as old De Beers (''Vooruitzicht''). It was named after Johannes Nicolaas de Beer and his brother, Diederik Arnoldus, who occupied the farm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capetowndiamondmuseum.org/about-diamonds/famous-people/|title=FAMOUS PEOPLE IN THE DIAMOND INDUSTRY|publisher=Cape Town Diamond Museum|accessdate=25 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter purchasing the land in 1839 from David Danser, a [[Griqua people|Koranna]] chief in the area, David Stephanus Fourie, forebearer for Claudine Fourie-Grosvenor, had allowed the de Beers and various other Afrikaner families to cultivate the land.

They believed that diamonds would be numerous in the hard [[Kimberlite|blue ground]] that had been exposed after the softer, yellow layer near the surface had been worked out. During this time, the technical problem of clearing out the water that was flooding the mines became serious. Rhodes and Rudd obtained the contract for pumping water out of the three main mines. After Rhodes returned from his first term at Oxford, he lived with Robert Dundas Graham, who later became a mining partner with Rudd and Rhodes.{{sfn|Rotberg|1988|pp=76-}}\n\nOn 13 March 1888, Rhodes and Rudd launched [[De Beers Consolidated Mines]] after the amalgamation of a number of individual claims. With \u00a3200,000 of capital, the company, of which Rhodes was secretary, owned the largest interest in the mine (\u00a3200,000 in 1880 = \u00a312.9m in 2004 = $22.5m USD).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://measuringworth.com/calculators/ppoweruk/ |title=Purchasing Power of Pound |publisher=Measuring Worth |date=15 February 1971 |accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref> Rhodes was named the chairman of [[De Beers]] at the company's founding in 1888.

With the earlier incorporation of [[Griqualand West]] into the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] under the [[John Charles Molteno|Molteno Ministry]] in 1877, the area had obtained six seats in the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape House of Assembly]].

The Sprigg ministry had precipitated the revolt by applying its policy of disarming all native Africans to those of the [[Basotho]] nation, who resisted.\n\nIn 1890, Rhodes became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony. He introduced the [[Glen Grey Act]] to push black people from their lands and make way for industrial development. Rhodes's view was that black people needed to be driven off their land to \"stimulate them to labour\" and to change their habits.{{sfn|Martin|2009|p=}} \"It must be brought home to them\", Rhodes said, \"that in future nine-tenths of them will have to spend their lives in manual labour, and the sooner that is brought home to them the better.\"{{sfn|Martin|2009|p=}}\n\nGiven the growing number of enfranchised black people in the Cape, Rhodes raised the franchise property requirements in 1892 to counter this preponderance.

Rhodes' competitive advantage over other mineral prospecting companies was his combination of wealth and astute political instincts, also called the \"imperial factor\", as he often collaborated with the British Government. He befriended its local representatives, the British [[Commissioner]]s, and through them organised British [[protectorate]]s over the mineral concession areas via separate but related treaties. In this way he obtained both legality and security for mining operations. He could then attract more investors. Imperial expansion and capital investment went hand in hand.{{sfn|Parsons|1993|p=179\u2013181}}{{sfn|R\u00f6nnb\u00e4ck|Broberg|2019|p=30}}\n\nThe imperial factor was a double-edged sword: Rhodes did not want the [[bureaucrat]]s of the [[Colonial Office]] in London to interfere in the Empire in Africa. He wanted British settlers and local politicians and governors to run it. This put him on a collision course with many in Britain, as well as with British [[missionaries]], who favoured what they saw as the more ethical direct rule from London. Rhodes prevailed because he would pay the cost of administering the territories to the north of South Africa against his future mining profits. The Colonial Office did not have enough funding for this. Rhodes promoted his business interests as in the strategic interest of Britain: preventing the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], the [[Germany|Germans]] or the [[Boers]] from moving into south-central Africa. Rhodes's companies and agents cemented these advantages by obtaining many mining concessions, as exemplified by the Rudd and Lochner Concessions.{{sfn|Parsons|1993|p=179\u2013181}}\n\n=== Treaties, concessions and charters ===\n\nRhodes had already tried and failed to get a mining concession from [[Lobengula]], king of the [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] of [[Matabeleland]]. In 1888 he tried again. He sent [[John Smith Moffat|John Moffat]], son of the missionary [[Robert Moffat (missionary)|Robert Moffat]], who was trusted by Lobengula, to persuade the latter to sign a treaty of friendship with Britain, and to look favourably on Rhodes's proposals. His associate Charles Rudd, together with Francis Thompson and Rochfort Maguire, assured Lobengula that no more than ten white men would mine in Matabeleland. This limitation was left out of the document, known as the [[Rudd Concession]], which Lobengula signed. Furthermore, it stated that the mining companies could do anything necessary to their operations. When Lobengula discovered later the true effects of the concession, he tried to renounce it, but the British Government ignored him.{{sfn|Parsons|1993|p=179\u2013181}}\n\nDuring the Company's early days, Rhodes and his associates set themselves up to make millions (hundreds of millions in current pounds) over the coming years through what has been described as a \"''[[:wiktionary:suppressio veri|suppressio veri]]''&nbsp;... which must be regarded as one of Rhodes's least creditable actions\".{{sfn|Blake|1977|p=55}} Contrary to what the British government and the public had been allowed to think, the Rudd Concession was not vested in the British South Africa Company, but in a short-lived ancillary concern of Rhodes, Rudd and a few others called the ''Central Search Association'', which was quietly formed in London in 1889. This entity renamed itself the ''United Concessions Company'' in 1890, and soon after sold the Rudd Concession to the Chartered Company for 1,000,000 shares. When Colonial Office functionaries discovered this chicanery in 1891, they advised [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] [[Henry Holland, 1st Viscount Knutsford|Knutsford]] to consider revoking the concession, but no action was taken.{{sfn|Blake|1977|p=55}}\n\nArmed with the Rudd Concession, in 1889 Rhodes obtained a [[charter]] from the British Government for his [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC) to rule, police, and make new treaties and concessions from the [[Limpopo River]] to the great lakes of Central Africa. He obtained further concessions and treaties north of the [[Zambezi]], such as those in [[Barotseland]] (the Lochner Concession with King ''[[Lewanika]]'' in 1890, which was similar to the Rudd Concession); and in the [[Lake Mweru]] area ([[Alfred Sharpe]]'s 1890 [[Kazembe]] concession). Rhodes also sent Sharpe to get a concession over mineral-rich [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], but met his match in ruthlessness: when Sharpe was rebuffed by its ruler ''[[Msiri]]'', King [[Leopold II of Belgium]] obtained a concession over Msiri's dead body for his [[Congo Free State]].{{sfn|R\u00f6nnb\u00e4ck|Broberg|2019|p=30}}\n\nRhodes also wanted [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]] (now [[Botswana]]) incorporated in the BSAC charter. But three [[Tswana people|Tswana]] kings, including [[Khama III]], travelled to Britain and won over British public opinion for it to remain governed by the British Colonial Office in London. Rhodes commented: \"It is humiliating to be utterly beaten by these niggers.\"{{sfn|Parsons|1993|p=179\u2013181}}\n\nThe British [[Colonial Office]] also decided to administer [[British Central Africa]] ([[Malawi|Nyasaland, today's Malawi]]) owing to{{Clarify|date=December 2015}} the activism of [[David Livingstone]] trying to end the  [[Arab slave trade|East African Arab-Swahili slave trade]]. Rhodes paid much of the cost so that the British Central Africa Commissioner [[Sir Harry Johnston]], and his successor Alfred Sharpe, would assist with security for Rhodes in the BSAC's north-eastern territories. Johnston shared Rhodes's expansionist views, but he and his successors were not as pro-settler as Rhodes, and disagreed on dealings with Africans.\n\n=== Rhodesia ===\n{{main|Company rule in Rhodesia}}\n[[File:Rhodes matabele 1896.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Rhodes and the Ndebele ''izinDuna'' make peace in the [[Matopos Hills]], as depicted by [[Robert Baden-Powell]], 1896]]\nThe BSAC had its own police force, the [[British South Africa Police]], which was used to control [[Matabeleland]] and [[Mashonaland]], in present-day [[Zimbabwe]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The company had hoped to start a \"new [[Witwatersrand|Rand]]\" from the ancient gold mines of the ''[[Shona people|Shona]]''.

In May 1895, its name was officially changed to \"Rhodesia\", reflecting Rhodes's popularity among settlers who had been using the name informally since 1891. The designation [[Southern Rhodesia]] was officially adopted in 1898 for the part south of the Zambezi, which later became Zimbabwe; and the designations [[North-Western Rhodesia|North-Western]] and [[North-Eastern Rhodesia]] were used from 1895 for the territory which later became [[Northern Rhodesia]], then [[Zambia]].{{sfn|Gray|1956}}{{sfn|Gray|1954}}\n\nRhodes decreed in his will that he was to be buried in Matopos Hills (now Matobo Hills).

I contend that every acre added to our territory means the birth of more of the English race who otherwise would not be brought into existence.\"{{sfn|Rhodes|1902|p=58}} These views struck a chord with [[Adolf Hitler]], who claimed that Rhodes was the only Englishman who truly understood Anglo-Saxon ideals.<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bbc-unveils-a-victorian-hero-a-money-mad-racist-closet-gay-1330823.html</ref>\n\nRhodes wanted to make the British Empire a superpower in which all of the British-dominated countries in the empire, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Cape Colony, would be [[Imperial Federation|represented in the British Parliament]].{{sfn|Rotberg|1988|p=150}} Rhodes included American students as eligible for the Rhodes scholarships. He said that he wanted to breed an American elite of [[philosopher-kings]] who would have the United States rejoin the British Empire. As Rhodes also respected and admired the Germans and their [[Kaiser]], he allowed German students to be included in the Rhodes scholarships. He believed that eventually the United Kingdom (including Ireland), the US, and Germany together would dominate the world and ensure perpetual peace.{{sfn|Flint|2009|p=}}{{page needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nRhodes's views on race have been debated.

We must adopt a system of despotism, such as works in India, in our relations with the barbarism of South Africa\".{{sfn|Magubane|1996|p=108}} Rhodes advocated the governance of indigenous Africans living in the Cape Colony \"in a state of barbarism and communal tenure\" as \"a subject race. I do not go so far as the member for Victoria West, who would not give the black man a vote.&nbsp;... If the whites maintain their position as the supreme race, the day may come when we shall be thankful that we have the natives with us in their proper position.\"{{sfn|Magubane|1996|p=109}}\n\nHowever historian Raymond C. Mensing, notes that Rhodes has the reputation  as the most flamboyant exemplar of the British imperial spirit, and always believed that British institutions were the best. Mensing argues that Rhodes quietly developed a more nuanced concept of imperial federation in Africa and that his mature views were more balanced and realistic. According to {{harvnb|Mensing|1986|pp=99\u2013106}} and front page, \"Rhodes was not a [[Scientific racism|biological or maximal racist]]. Despite his support for what became the basis for the apartheid system, he is best seen as a [[Cultural racism|cultural or minimal racist]]\".\n\nOn domestic politics within Britain, Rhodes was a supporter of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].{{sfn|Pinney|1995|p=72}} Rhodes' only major impact was his large-scale support of the Irish nationalist party, led by [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] (1846\u20131891).{{sfn|McCracken|2003|pp=22-24}}\n\nRhodes worked well with the Afrikaners in the Cape Colony. He supported teaching Dutch as well as English in public schools. While Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, he helped to remove most of their legal disabilities. {{sfn|Flint|2009}} He was a friend of [[Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (Onze Jan)|Jan Hofmeyr]], leader of the [[Afrikaner Bond]], and it was largely because of Afrikaner support that he became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony.{{sfn|Rotberg|1988|pp=131\u2013133}} Rhodes advocated greater self-government for the Cape Colony, in line with his preference for the empire to be controlled by local settlers and politicians rather than by London.\n\nScholar and Zimbabwean author [[Peter Godwin]], whilst critical of Rhodes, writes that he needs to be viewed via the prisms and cultural and social perspective of his epoch, positing that Rhodes \"was no 19th-century Hitler. He wasn't so much a freak as a man of his time...Rhodes and the white pioneers in southern Africa did behave despicably by today's standards, but no worse than the white settlers in North America, South America, and Australia; and in some senses better, considering that the genocide of natives in Africa was less complete. For all the former African colonies are now ruled by indigenous peoples, unlike the Americas and the Antipodes, most of whose aboriginal natives were all but exterminated.\"\n\nGodwin goes on to say \"Rhodes and his cronies fit in perfectly with their surroundings and conformed to the morality (or lack of it) of the day. As is so often the case, history simply followed the gravitational pull of superior firepower.\"\n\n== Personal relationships ==\n\n=== Personal life ===\nRhodes never married, pleading, \"I have too much work on my hands\" and saying that he would not be a dutiful husband.{{sfn|Plomer|1984|p=}}{{page needed|date=December 2016}} Subsequent historians such as Robin Brown have suggested that Rhodes was a homosexual who was in love with his private secretary, Neville Pickering. Rhodes made Pickering the sole beneficiary of his will, but an accident resulted in Pickering catching [[septicaemia]], during which time Rhodes spent six weeks trying to nurse Pickering back to health. Pickering eventually died in Rhodes' arms.<ref>http://thecasualobserver.co.za/rhodes-enigma-close-male-personal-relationships/</ref><ref>https://city-press.news24.com/Voices/Rhodes-and-his-sexuality-20151106</ref><ref>Robin Brown, ''The Secret Society: Cecil John Rhodes' Plan for a New World Order'' (Penguin: 2015).</ref><ref>https://showme.co.za/lifestyle/the-secret-rhodes/</ref>\n\n=== Princess Radziwi\u0142\u0142 ===\n\nIn the last years of his life, Rhodes was [[stalking|stalked]] by Polish princess [[Catherine Radziwill|Catherine Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], born [[Rzewuski family|Rzewuska]], who had married into the [[szlachta|noble]] Polish family [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142]]. The princess falsely claimed that she was engaged to Rhodes, and that they were having an affair. She asked him to marry her, but Rhodes refused. In reaction, she accused him of loan [[fraud]].

The military felt he was more of a liability than an asset and found him intolerable. The officer commanding the garrison of Kimberley, Lieutenant Colonel [[Robert Kekewich]], experienced serious personal difficulties with Rhodes because of the latters' inability to co-operate;{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=321\u2013323}}{{sfn|Phelan|1913|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nDespite these differences, Rhodes's company was instrumental in the defence of the city, providing water, refrigeration facilities, constructing fortifications, manufacturing an [[armoured train]], shells and a one-off gun named [[Long Cecil]].{{sfn|Roberts|1976|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nRhodes used his position and influence to lobby the British government to relieve the siege of Kimberley, claiming in the press that the situation in the city was desperate. The military wanted to assemble a large force to take the Boer cities of [[Bloemfontein]] and [[Pretoria]], but they were compelled to change their plans and send three separate smaller forces to relieve the sieges of Kimberley, [[Siege of Mafeking|Mafeking]] and [[Siege of Ladysmith|Ladysmith]].{{sfn|Thompson|2007|pp=131\u2013}}\n\n== Death and legacy ==\n\n[[File:Cecil Rhodes funeral.jpg|thumb|left|Funeral of Rhodes in Adderley St, Cape Town, on 3 April 1902]]\nAlthough Rhodes remained a leading figure in the politics of southern Africa, especially during the [[Second Boer War]], he was dogged by ill health throughout his relatively short life.\n\nHe was sent to Natal aged 16 because it was believed the climate might help problems with his heart. On returning to England in 1872, his health again deteriorated with heart and lung problems, to the extent that his doctor, Sir [[Morell Mackenzie]], believed he would only survive six months. He returned to Kimberley where his health improved. From age 40 his heart condition returned with increasing severity until his death from heart failure in 1902, aged 48, at his seaside cottage in Muizenberg.{{sfn|The Times|27 March 1902}}\n\nThe government arranged an epic journey by train from the Cape to Rhodesia, with the funeral train stopping at every station to allow mourners to pay their respects. It was reported that at Kimberley, \"practically the entire population marched in procession past the funeral car\".<ref>Mr. Rhodes's Bequests,New-York Tribune, 6 April 1902, Page 4</ref> He was finally laid to rest at World's View, a hilltop located approximately {{convert|35|km|mi}} south of [[Bulawayo]], in what was then [[Rhodesia]].{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=848}} Today, his grave site is part of [[Matobo National Park]], Zimbabwe.\n\nThe continued presence of Rhodes's grave in the Matopos (now Matobos) hills has not been without controversy in contemporary Zimbabwe. In December 2010, [[Cain Mathema]], the governor of Bulawayo, branded the grave outside the country's second city an \"insult to the African ancestors\" and said he believed its presence had brought bad luck and poor weather to the region. The grave site is considered an important national and historic monument on protected land which attracts many tourist visitors every year.{{sfn|Gore|2013}}\n\nIn February 2012, Mugabe loyalists and [[ZANU-PF]] activists visited the grave site demanding permission from the local chief to exhume Rhodes's remains and return them to Britain. This was considered a nationalist political stunt in the run up to an election, rather than representing any genuine national desire to remove the grave. Local Chief Masuku and Godfrey Mahachi, one of the country's foremost archaeologists, strongly expressed their opposition to the grave being removed due to its historical significance to Zimbabwe. Then-president [[Robert Mugabe]] also opposed the move.{{sfn|Laing|2012}}\n\nIn 2004, he was voted 56th in the [[SABC 3]] television series ''[[Great South Africans (television series)|Great South Africans]]''.{{sfn|Blair|2004}}\n\nAt his death, he was considered one of the wealthiest men in the world.

Its members eventually achieve the secret of time travel and use it to restrain World War I and prevent World War II, and to perpetuate the world ascendancy of the British Empire up to the end of the Twentieth Century. The book contains a vivid description of Cecil Rhodes himself, seen through the eyes of a traveller from the future British Empire.\n* In the British film ''[[Rhodes of Africa]]'' (1936, directed by Austrian filmmaker [[Berthold Viertel]]), Rhodes was portrayed by Canadian actor [[Walter Huston]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028176/ ''Rhodes of Africa'' (1936)].</ref>\n* Rhodes was played by [[Ferdinand Marian (actor)|Ferdinand Marian]] in the Nazi propaganda film ''[[Ohm Kr\u00fcger]]'' (1941), where he \u2013 like all other British characters in the film \u2013 was presented as an outright villain.\n* In 1901, Rhodes bought [[Dalham Hall]], Suffolk.

It tells the story of Rhodes' life through a series of flashbacks of conversations between him and Princess Catherine Radziwi\u0142\u0142 and also between her and people who knew him. It also shows the story of how she stalked and eventually ruined him. In the serial, Cecil Rhodes is played by [[Martin Shaw]], the younger Cecil Rhodes is played by his son Joe Shaw, and Princess Radziwi\u0142\u0142 is played by [[Frances Barber]]. In the serial Rhodes is portrayed as ruthless and greedy. The serial also suggests that he was homosexual.{{sfn|Godwin|1998}} Countering the implication of Rhodes' homosexuality, historian and journalist [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] wrote that Rhodes had been falsely smeared by the programme, commenting: \"In nine tendentious hours, Rhodes is to be presented as a corrupt and greedy money-grabber, a racist and paedophile, whose disgusting passion was to get his hands on young boys ... the BBC has spent \u00a310m of our money putting together a farrago of exaggerations and smears about this great man.\" [[Peter Godwin]] said of the film that \"it feels like a work overwhelmingly informed by malice, consistently seizing on the very worst interpretation of the man without really attempting to get under his skin.

British businessman, statesman, imperialist, mining [[magnate]], and [[politician]] in southern Africa who served as [[Prime Minister of the Cape Colony|Prime Minister]] of the [[Cape Colony]] from 1890 to 1896. An ardent believer in British [[imperialism]], Rhodes and his [[British South Africa Company]] founded the southern African territory of [[Rhodesia (region)|Rhodesia]] (now Zimbabwe and Zambia), which the company named after him in 1895. South Africa's [[Rhodes University]] is also named after him. Rhodes set up the provisions of the [[Rhodes Scholarship]], which is funded by his estate. He also put much effort towards his vision of a [[Cape to Cairo Railway]] through British territory.{{sfn|R\u00f6nnb\u00e4ck|Broberg|2019|p=30}}\n\nThe son of a [[vicar]], Rhodes was born at [[Rhodes Arts Complex|Netteswell House]], [[Bishop's Stortford]], Hertfordshire. Growing up in Hertfordshire, he was a sickly child. He was sent to South Africa by his family when he was 17 years old in the hope that the climate might improve his health. He entered the diamond trade at [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] in 1871, when he was 18, and over the next two decades gained near-complete domination of the world diamond market. His [[De Beers]] diamond company, formed in 1888, retains its prominence into the 21st century. Rhodes entered the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape Parliament]] at the age of 27 in 1880, and a decade later became Prime Minister. After overseeing the formation of Rhodesia during the early 1890s, he was forced to resign as Prime Minister in 1896 after the disastrous [[Jameson Raid]], an unauthorised attack on [[Paul Kruger]]'s [[South African Republic]] (or Transvaal).\n\nOne of Rhodes's primary motivations in politics and business was his professed belief that the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon race]] was, to quote his [[Will and testament|will]], \"the first race in the world\".{{sfn|Rhodes|1902|p=58}} Under the reasoning that \"the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race\",{{sfn|Rhodes|1902|p=58}} he advocated vigorous [[settler colonialism]] and ultimately a reformation of the [[British Empire]] so that each component would be self-governing and [[Imperial Federation|represented in a single parliament]] in London. Ambitions such as these, juxtaposed with his policies regarding indigenous Africans in the Cape Colony\u2014describing the country's native black population as largely \"in a state of barbarism\",{{sfn|Magubane|1996|p=109}} he advocated their governance as a \"subject race\",{{sfn|Magubane|1996|p=109}} and was at the centre of actions to marginalise them politically\u2014have led recent critics to characterise him as a white supremacist and \"an architect of [[apartheid]]\".{{sfn|Castle|2016}}\n\nHistorian Richard A. McFarlane has described Rhodes \"as integral a participant in southern African and British imperial history as [[George Washington]] or [[Abraham Lincoln]] are in their respective eras in United States history.\"{{sfn|McFarlane|2007}} After Rhodes's death in 1902, at the age of 48, he was buried in the [[Matopos Hills]] in what is now Zimbabwe.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/zimbabwe/9098490/Robert-Mugabe-blocks-Cecil-John-Rhodes-exhumation.html|title=Robert Mugabe blocks Cecil John Rhodes exhumation|newspaper=Telegraph|author=Aislinn Laing}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nRhodes was born in 1853 in [[Bishop's Stortford]], Hertfordshire, England, the fifth son of the Reverend Francis William Rhodes (1807-1878) and his wife Louisa Peacock.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/people/cecil-john-rhodes|title=Cecil John Rhodes|publisher =South African History Online|accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> Francis was a [[Church of England]] [[clergyman]] who served as [[perpetual curate]] of Brentwood, Essex (1834-1843) and then as vicar of nearby Bishops Stortford (1849-1876).

Sutherland]], in [[Pietermaritzburg]], Rhodes took an interest in agriculture. He joined his brother Herbert on his cotton farm in the [[Umkomazi]] valley in Natal. The land was unsuitable for cotton, and the venture failed.\n\nIn October 1871, 18-year-old Rhodes and his 26-year-old brother Herbert left the colony for the diamond fields of [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] in Northern Cape Province. Financed by [[N M Rothschild & Sons]], Rhodes succeeded over the next 17 years in buying up all the smaller diamond mining operations in the Kimberley area.\n\nHis monopoly of the world's diamond supply was sealed in 1890 through a strategic partnership with the London-based Diamond Syndicate. They agreed to control world supply to maintain high prices.{{sfn|Epstein|1982|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}{{sfn|Knowles|2005|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}} Rhodes supervised the working of his brother's claim and [[speculation|speculated]] on his behalf. Among his associates in the early days were [[John X. Merriman]] and [[Charles Rudd]], who later became his partner in the [[De Beers|De Beers Mining Company]] and the Niger Oil Company.\n\nDuring the 1880s, [[Boschendal|Cape vineyards]] had been devastated by a [[phylloxera]] epidemic. The diseased vineyards were dug up and replanted, and farmers were looking for alternatives to wine. In 1892, Rhodes financed The [[Pioneer Fruit Growing Company]] at [[Nooitgedacht, South Africa|Nooitgedacht]], a venture created by Harry Pickstone, an Englishman who had experience with fruit-growing in California.{{sfn|Boschendal|2007|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}  The shipping magnate [[Percy Molteno]] had just undertaken the first successful refrigerated export to Europe. In 1896, after consulting with Molteno, Rhodes began to pay more attention to export fruit farming and bought farms in Groot Drakenstein, [[Wellington, Western Cape|Wellington]] and Stellenbosch. A year later, he bought Rhone and [[Boschendal]] and commissioned [[Sir Herbert Baker]] to build him a cottage there.{{sfn|Boschendal|2007|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}{{sfn|Picton-Seymour|1989|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}  The successful operation soon expanded into [[Rhodes Fruit Farms]], and formed a cornerstone of the modern-day Cape fruit industry.{{sfn| Oberholster |1987|p=91}}\n\n=== Education ===\n\n[[File:Rhodes' portrait bust.JPG|thumb|A portrait bust of Rhodes on the first floor of No. 6 [[King Edward Street]] marks the place of his residence whilst in [[Oxford]].]]\n\nIn 1873, Rhodes left his farm field in the care of his business partner, Rudd, and sailed for England to study at university. He was admitted to [[Oriel College, Oxford]], but stayed for only one term in 1873. He returned to South Africa and did not return for his second term at Oxford until 1876. He was greatly influenced by [[John Ruskin]]'s inaugural lecture at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], which reinforced his own attachment to the cause of British [[imperialism]].\n\nAmong his Oxford associates were [[James Rochfort Maguire]], later a fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]] and a director of the [[British South Africa Company]], and Charles Metcalfe {{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}. Due to his university career, Rhodes admired the Oxford \"system\". Eventually, he was inspired to develop his scholarship scheme: \"Wherever you turn your eye\u2014except in science\u2014an Oxford man is at the top of the tree\".{{sfn|Alexander|1914|p=259}}\n\nWhile attending Oriel College, Rhodes became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] in the [[Apollo University Lodge]].{{sfn|Apollo University Lodge}} Although initially he did not approve of the organisation, he continued to be a [[Freemasonry in South Africa|South African Freemason]] until his death in 1902. The shortcomings of the Freemasons, in his opinion, later caused him to envisage his own secret society with the goal of bringing the entire world under British rule.{{sfn|Thomas|1997|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}} According to [[Carroll Quigley]], he set up the [[Round Table movement]] to this end.\n\n== Diamonds and the establishment of De Beers ==\n[[File:De Beers Consolidated Mines 1902.jpg|thumb|Preference Share of the De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd., issued 1. March 1902]]\n[[File:Cecil Rhodes by Violet manners.jpg|thumb|Sketch of Rhodes by [[Violet Manners, Duchess of Rutland|Violet Manners]] ]]\n\nDuring his years at Oxford, Rhodes continued to prosper in Kimberley. Before his departure for Oxford, he and C.D. Rudd had moved from the [[Big Hole|Kimberley Mine]] to invest in the more costly claims of what was known as old De Beers (''Vooruitzicht''). It was named after Johannes Nicolaas de Beer and his brother, Diederik Arnoldus, who occupied the farm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.capetowndiamondmuseum.org/about-diamonds/famous-people/|title=FAMOUS PEOPLE IN THE DIAMOND INDUSTRY|publisher=Cape Town Diamond Museum|accessdate=25 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter purchasing the land in 1839 from David Danser, a [[Griqua people|Koranna]] chief in the area, David Stephanus Fourie, forebearer for Claudine Fourie-Grosvenor, had allowed the de Beers and various other Afrikaner families to cultivate the land. The region extended from the [[Modder River]] via the Vet River up to the [[Vaal River]].{{sfn|Rosenthal|1965|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nIn 1874 and 1875, the diamond fields were in the grip of depression, but Rhodes and Rudd were among those who stayed to consolidate their interests. They believed that diamonds would be numerous in the hard [[Kimberlite|blue ground]] that had been exposed after the softer, yellow layer near the surface had been worked out. During this time, the technical problem of clearing out the water that was flooding the mines became serious. Rhodes and Rudd obtained the contract for pumping water out of the three main mines. After Rhodes returned from his first term at Oxford, he lived with Robert Dundas Graham, who later became a mining partner with Rudd and Rhodes.{{sfn|Rotberg|1988|pp=76-}}\n\nOn 13 March 1888, Rhodes and Rudd launched [[De Beers Consolidated Mines]] after the amalgamation of a number of individual claims. With \u00a3200,000 of capital, the company, of which Rhodes was secretary, owned the largest interest in the mine (\u00a3200,000 in 1880 = \u00a312.9m in 2004 = $22.5m USD).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://measuringworth.com/calculators/ppoweruk/ |title=Purchasing Power of Pound |publisher=Measuring Worth |date=15 February 1971 |accessdate=20 August 2014}}</ref> Rhodes was named the chairman of [[De Beers]] at the company's founding in 1888. De Beers was established with funding from [[Rothschild & Co|N.M. Rothschild & Sons]] in 1887.{{efn| With the provision of funding for the creation of De Beers in 1887, Rothschild also turned to investment in the mining of precious stones, in Africa and India.

With the earlier incorporation of [[Griqualand West]] into the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] under the [[John Charles Molteno|Molteno Ministry]] in 1877, the area had obtained six seats in the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape House of Assembly]]. Rhodes chose the rural and predominately [[Boer]] constituency of [[Barkly West]], which would remain loyal to Rhodes until his death.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cecil-Rhodes|title=Cecil Rhodes {{!}} prime minister of Cape Colony|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=20 July 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhen Rhodes became a member of the [[Cape Parliament]], the chief goal of the assembly was to help decide the future of [[Basutoland]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The ministry of [[Gordon Sprigg|Sir Gordon Sprigg]] was trying to restore order after the 1880 rebellion known as the [[Gun War]]. The Sprigg ministry had precipitated the revolt by applying its policy of disarming all native Africans to those of the [[Basotho]] nation, who resisted.\n\nIn 1890, Rhodes became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony. He introduced the [[Glen Grey Act]] to push black people from their lands and make way for industrial development. Rhodes's view was that black people needed to be driven off their land to \"stimulate them to labour\" and to change their habits.{{sfn|Martin|2009|p=}} \"It must be brought home to them\", Rhodes said, \"that in future nine-tenths of them will have to spend their lives in manual labour, and the sooner that is brought home to them the better.\"{{sfn|Martin|2009|p=}}\n\nGiven the growing number of enfranchised black people in the Cape, Rhodes raised the franchise property requirements in 1892 to counter this preponderance. The change had drastic effects on the traditional [[Cape Qualified Franchise]].<ref>[http://myfundi.co.za/e/History_of_South_Africa_Timeline_%281485-1975%29 History of South Africa Timeline(1485\u20131975)]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913230535/http://myfundi.co.za/e/History_of_South_Africa_Timeline_%281485-1975%29 |date=13 September 2011 }}</ref> By simultaneously limiting the amount of land which black Africans were legally allowed to hold, while tripling the property qualifications required to vote, Rhodes succeeded in disenfranchising the black population.

It forced Cecil Rhodes to resign as Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, sent his oldest brother Col.

Burrows was severely wounded and had to have his leg amputated. His suit for \u00a33,000 in damages was successful.<ref>''Burrows v.

Rhodes' competitive advantage over other mineral prospecting companies was his combination of wealth and astute political instincts, also called the \"imperial factor\", as he often collaborated with the British Government. He befriended its local representatives, the British [[Commissioner]]s, and through them organised British [[protectorate]]s over the mineral concession areas via separate but related treaties. In this way he obtained both legality and security for mining operations. He could then attract more investors. Imperial expansion and capital investment went hand in hand.{{sfn|Parsons|1993|p=179\u2013181}}{{sfn|R\u00f6nnb\u00e4ck|Broberg|2019|p=30}}\n\nThe imperial factor was a double-edged sword: Rhodes did not want the [[bureaucrat]]s of the [[Colonial Office]] in London to interfere in the Empire in Africa. He wanted British settlers and local politicians and governors to run it. This put him on a collision course with many in Britain, as well as with British [[missionaries]], who favoured what they saw as the more ethical direct rule from London. Rhodes prevailed because he would pay the cost of administering the territories to the north of South Africa against his future mining profits. The Colonial Office did not have enough funding for this. Rhodes promoted his business interests as in the strategic interest of Britain: preventing the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], the [[Germany|Germans]] or the [[Boers]] from moving into south-central Africa. Rhodes's companies and agents cemented these advantages by obtaining many mining concessions, as exemplified by the Rudd and Lochner Concessions.{{sfn|Parsons|1993|p=179\u2013181}}\n\n=== Treaties, concessions and charters ===\n\nRhodes had already tried and failed to get a mining concession from [[Lobengula]], king of the [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] of [[Matabeleland]]. In 1888 he tried again. He sent [[John Smith Moffat|John Moffat]], son of the missionary [[Robert Moffat (missionary)|Robert Moffat]], who was trusted by Lobengula, to persuade the latter to sign a treaty of friendship with Britain, and to look favourably on Rhodes's proposals. His associate Charles Rudd, together with Francis Thompson and Rochfort Maguire, assured Lobengula that no more than ten white men would mine in Matabeleland. This limitation was left out of the document, known as the [[Rudd Concession]], which Lobengula signed. Furthermore, it stated that the mining companies could do anything necessary to their operations. When Lobengula discovered later the true effects of the concession, he tried to renounce it, but the British Government ignored him.{{sfn|Parsons|1993|p=179\u2013181}}\n\nDuring the Company's early days, Rhodes and his associates set themselves up to make millions (hundreds of millions in current pounds) over the coming years through what has been described as a \"''[[:wiktionary:suppressio veri|suppressio veri]]''&nbsp;... which must be regarded as one of Rhodes's least creditable actions\".{{sfn|Blake|1977|p=55}} Contrary to what the British government and the public had been allowed to think, the Rudd Concession was not vested in the British South Africa Company, but in a short-lived ancillary concern of Rhodes, Rudd and a few others called the ''Central Search Association'', which was quietly formed in London in 1889. This entity renamed itself the ''United Concessions Company'' in 1890, and soon after sold the Rudd Concession to the Chartered Company for 1,000,000 shares. When Colonial Office functionaries discovered this chicanery in 1891, they advised [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] [[Henry Holland, 1st Viscount Knutsford|Knutsford]] to consider revoking the concession, but no action was taken.{{sfn|Blake|1977|p=55}}\n\nArmed with the Rudd Concession, in 1889 Rhodes obtained a [[charter]] from the British Government for his [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC) to rule, police, and make new treaties and concessions from the [[Limpopo River]] to the great lakes of Central Africa. He obtained further concessions and treaties north of the [[Zambezi]], such as those in [[Barotseland]] (the Lochner Concession with King ''[[Lewanika]]'' in 1890, which was similar to the Rudd Concession); and in the [[Lake Mweru]] area ([[Alfred Sharpe]]'s 1890 [[Kazembe]] concession). Rhodes also sent Sharpe to get a concession over mineral-rich [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], but met his match in ruthlessness: when Sharpe was rebuffed by its ruler ''[[Msiri]]'', King [[Leopold II of Belgium]] obtained a concession over Msiri's dead body for his [[Congo Free State]].{{sfn|R\u00f6nnb\u00e4ck|Broberg|2019|p=30}}\n\nRhodes also wanted [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]] (now [[Botswana]]) incorporated in the BSAC charter. But three [[Tswana people|Tswana]] kings, including [[Khama III]], travelled to Britain and won over British public opinion for it to remain governed by the British Colonial Office in London. Rhodes commented: \"It is humiliating to be utterly beaten by these niggers.\"{{sfn|Parsons|1993|p=179\u2013181}}\n\nThe British [[Colonial Office]] also decided to administer [[British Central Africa]] ([[Malawi|Nyasaland, today's Malawi]]) owing to{{Clarify|date=December 2015}} the activism of [[David Livingstone]] trying to end the  [[Arab slave trade|East African Arab-Swahili slave trade]]. Rhodes paid much of the cost so that the British Central Africa Commissioner [[Sir Harry Johnston]], and his successor Alfred Sharpe, would assist with security for Rhodes in the BSAC's north-eastern territories. Johnston shared Rhodes's expansionist views, but he and his successors were not as pro-settler as Rhodes, and disagreed on dealings with Africans.\n\n=== Rhodesia ===\n{{main|Company rule in Rhodesia}}\n[[File:Rhodes matabele 1896.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Rhodes and the Ndebele ''izinDuna'' make peace in the [[Matopos Hills]], as depicted by [[Robert Baden-Powell]], 1896]]\nThe BSAC had its own police force, the [[British South Africa Police]], which was used to control [[Matabeleland]] and [[Mashonaland]], in present-day [[Zimbabwe]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The company had hoped to start a \"new [[Witwatersrand|Rand]]\" from the ancient gold mines of the ''[[Shona people|Shona]]''.

Shortly after learning of the assassination of the Ndebele spiritual leader, ''Mlimo'', by the American scout [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], Rhodes walked unarmed into the Ndebele stronghold in [[Matobo Hills]].{{sfn|Panton|2015|p=321}} He persuaded the ''[[Impi]]'' to lay down their arms, thus ending the Second Matabele War.{{sfn|Farwell|2001|pp=539\u2013}}\n\nBy the end of 1894, the territories over which the BSAC had concessions or treaties, collectively called \"Zambesia\" after the [[Zambezi River]] flowing through the middle, comprised an area of 1,143,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> between the [[Limpopo River]] and [[Lake Tanganyika]]. In May 1895, its name was officially changed to \"Rhodesia\", reflecting Rhodes's popularity among settlers who had been using the name informally since 1891. The designation [[Southern Rhodesia]] was officially adopted in 1898 for the part south of the Zambezi, which later became Zimbabwe; and the designations [[North-Western Rhodesia|North-Western]] and [[North-Eastern Rhodesia]] were used from 1895 for the territory which later became [[Northern Rhodesia]], then [[Zambia]].{{sfn|Gray|1956}}{{sfn|Gray|1954}}\n\nRhodes decreed in his will that he was to be buried in Matopos Hills (now Matobo Hills). After his death in the Cape in 1902, his body was transported by train to [[Bulawayo]]. His burial was attended by Ndebele chiefs, who asked that the firing party should not discharge their rifles as this would disturb the spirits. Then, for the first time, they gave a white man the Matabele royal salute, ''Bayete''. Rhodes is buried alongside [[Leander Starr Jameson]] and 34 British soldiers killed in the [[Shangani Patrol]].{{sfn|Domville-Fife|1900 |p=89}} Despite occasional efforts to return his body to the United Kingdom, his grave remains there still, \"part and parcel of the history of Zimbabwe\" and attracts thousands of visitors each year.{{sfn|Laing|2012}}\n\n=== \"Cape to Cairo Red Line\" ===\n\n[[File:Colonial Africa 1913 map.svg|thumb|right|upright|Map showing almost complete British control of the Cape to Cairo route, 1913<br />{{Legend|#fbc5c0|British control}}]]\n{{main|Cape to Cairo Railway|Cape to Cairo Road}}\n\nOne of Rhodes's dreams (shared by other members of the [[British Empire]]) was for a \"red line\" on the map from the Cape to Cairo (on geo-political maps, British dominions were always denoted in red or pink). Rhodes had been instrumental in securing southern African states for the Empire. He and others felt the best way to \"unify the possessions, facilitate governance, enable the military to move quickly to hot spots or conduct war, help settlement, and foster trade\" would be to build the \"[[Cape to Cairo Railway]]\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/travel/an-african-journey-from-the-cape-to-cairo.html|title=AN AFRICAN JOURNEY, FROM THE CAPE TO CAIRO|newspaper=New York Times|author=Barbara Crossette|accessdate=25 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThis enterprise was not without its problems.

In his last will and testament, Rhodes said of the English, \"I contend that we are the first race in the world, and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race. I contend that every acre added to our territory means the birth of more of the English race who otherwise would not be brought into existence.\"{{sfn|Rhodes|1902|p=58}} These views struck a chord with [[Adolf Hitler]], who claimed that Rhodes was the only Englishman who truly understood Anglo-Saxon ideals.<ref>https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/bbc-unveils-a-victorian-hero-a-money-mad-racist-closet-gay-1330823.html</ref>\n\nRhodes wanted to make the British Empire a superpower in which all of the British-dominated countries in the empire, including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Cape Colony, would be [[Imperial Federation|represented in the British Parliament]].{{sfn|Rotberg|1988|p=150}} Rhodes included American students as eligible for the Rhodes scholarships. He said that he wanted to breed an American elite of [[philosopher-kings]] who would have the United States rejoin the British Empire.

We must adopt a system of despotism, such as works in India, in our relations with the barbarism of South Africa\".{{sfn|Magubane|1996|p=108}} Rhodes advocated the governance of indigenous Africans living in the Cape Colony \"in a state of barbarism and communal tenure\" as \"a subject race. I do not go so far as the member for Victoria West, who would not give the black man a vote.&nbsp;... If the whites maintain their position as the supreme race, the day may come when we shall be thankful that we have the natives with us in their proper position.\"{{sfn|Magubane|1996|p=109}}\n\nHowever historian Raymond C. Mensing, notes that Rhodes has the reputation  as the most flamboyant exemplar of the British imperial spirit, and always believed that British institutions were the best. Mensing argues that Rhodes quietly developed a more nuanced concept of imperial federation in Africa and that his mature views were more balanced and realistic. According to {{harvnb|Mensing|1986|pp=99\u2013106}} and front page, \"Rhodes was not a [[Scientific racism|biological or maximal racist]]. Despite his support for what became the basis for the apartheid system, he is best seen as a [[Cultural racism|cultural or minimal racist]]\".\n\nOn domestic politics within Britain, Rhodes was a supporter of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].{{sfn|Pinney|1995|p=72}} Rhodes' only major impact was his large-scale support of the Irish nationalist party, led by [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] (1846\u20131891).{{sfn|McCracken|2003|pp=22-24}}\n\nRhodes worked well with the Afrikaners in the Cape Colony. He supported teaching Dutch as well as English in public schools. While Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, he helped to remove most of their legal disabilities. {{sfn|Flint|2009}} He was a friend of [[Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (Onze Jan)|Jan Hofmeyr]], leader of the [[Afrikaner Bond]], and it was largely because of Afrikaner support that he became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony.{{sfn|Rotberg|1988|pp=131\u2013133}} Rhodes advocated greater self-government for the Cape Colony, in line with his preference for the empire to be controlled by local settlers and politicians rather than by London.\n\nScholar and Zimbabwean author [[Peter Godwin]], whilst critical of Rhodes, writes that he needs to be viewed via the prisms and cultural and social perspective of his epoch, positing that Rhodes \"was no 19th-century Hitler. He wasn't so much a freak as a man of his time...Rhodes and the white pioneers in southern Africa did behave despicably by today's standards, but no worse than the white settlers in North America, South America, and Australia; and in some senses better, considering that the genocide of natives in Africa was less complete. For all the former African colonies are now ruled by indigenous peoples, unlike the Americas and the Antipodes, most of whose aboriginal natives were all but exterminated.\"\n\nGodwin goes on to say \"Rhodes and his cronies fit in perfectly with their surroundings and conformed to the morality (or lack of it) of the day. As is so often the case, history simply followed the gravitational pull of superior firepower.\"\n\n== Personal relationships ==\n\n=== Personal life ===\nRhodes never married, pleading, \"I have too much work on my hands\" and saying that he would not be a dutiful husband.{{sfn|Plomer|1984|p=}}{{page needed|date=December 2016}} Subsequent historians such as Robin Brown have suggested that Rhodes was a homosexual who was in love with his private secretary, Neville Pickering. Rhodes made Pickering the sole beneficiary of his will, but an accident resulted in Pickering catching [[septicaemia]], during which time Rhodes spent six weeks trying to nurse Pickering back to health. Pickering eventually died in Rhodes' arms.<ref>http://thecasualobserver.co.za/rhodes-enigma-close-male-personal-relationships/</ref><ref>https://city-press.news24.com/Voices/Rhodes-and-his-sexuality-20151106</ref><ref>Robin Brown, ''The Secret Society: Cecil John Rhodes' Plan for a New World Order'' (Penguin: 2015).</ref><ref>https://showme.co.za/lifestyle/the-secret-rhodes/</ref>\n\n=== Princess Radziwi\u0142\u0142 ===\n\nIn the last years of his life, Rhodes was [[stalking|stalked]] by Polish princess [[Catherine Radziwill|Catherine Radziwi\u0142\u0142]], born [[Rzewuski family|Rzewuska]], who had married into the [[szlachta|noble]] Polish family [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142]].

The military felt he was more of a liability than an asset and found him intolerable. The officer commanding the garrison of Kimberley, Lieutenant Colonel [[Robert Kekewich]], experienced serious personal difficulties with Rhodes because of the latters' inability to co-operate;{{sfn|Pakenham|1992|pp=321\u2013323}}{{sfn|Phelan|1913|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nDespite these differences, Rhodes's company was instrumental in the defence of the city, providing water, refrigeration facilities, constructing fortifications, manufacturing an [[armoured train]], shells and a one-off gun named [[Long Cecil]].{{sfn|Roberts|1976|p=}}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nRhodes used his position and influence to lobby the British government to relieve the siege of Kimberley, claiming in the press that the situation in the city was desperate.

On returning to England in 1872, his health again deteriorated with heart and lung problems, to the extent that his doctor, Sir [[Morell Mackenzie]], believed he would only survive six months. He returned to Kimberley where his health improved. From age 40 his heart condition returned with increasing severity until his death from heart failure in 1902, aged 48, at his seaside cottage in Muizenberg.{{sfn|The Times|27 March 1902}}\n\nThe government arranged an epic journey by train from the Cape to Rhodesia, with the funeral train stopping at every station to allow mourners to pay their respects. It was reported that at Kimberley, \"practically the entire population marched in procession past the funeral car\".<ref>Mr. Rhodes's Bequests,New-York Tribune, 6 April 1902, Page 4</ref> He was finally laid to rest at World's View, a hilltop located approximately {{convert|35|km|mi}} south of [[Bulawayo]], in what was then [[Rhodesia]].{{sfn|Wilson|2016|p=848}} Today, his grave site is part of [[Matobo National Park]], Zimbabwe.\n\nThe continued presence of Rhodes's grave in the Matopos (now Matobos) hills has not been without controversy in contemporary Zimbabwe. In December 2010, [[Cain Mathema]], the governor of Bulawayo, branded the grave outside the country's second city an \"insult to the African ancestors\" and said he believed its presence had brought bad luck and poor weather to the region. The grave site is considered an important national and historic monument on protected land which attracts many tourist visitors every year.{{sfn|Gore|2013}}\n\nIn February 2012, Mugabe loyalists and [[ZANU-PF]] activists visited the grave site demanding permission from the local chief to exhume Rhodes's remains and return them to Britain. This was considered a nationalist political stunt in the run up to an election, rather than representing any genuine national desire to remove the grave. Local Chief Masuku and Godfrey Mahachi, one of the country's foremost archaeologists, strongly expressed their opposition to the grave being removed due to its historical significance to Zimbabwe. Then-president [[Robert Mugabe]] also opposed the move.{{sfn|Laing|2012}}\n\nIn 2004, he was voted 56th in the [[SABC 3]] television series ''[[Great South Africans (television series)|Great South Africans]]''.{{sfn|Blair|2004}}\n\nAt his death, he was considered one of the wealthiest men in the world.

The book contains a vivid description of Cecil Rhodes himself, seen through the eyes of a traveller from the future British Empire.\n* In the British film ''[[Rhodes of Africa]]'' (1936, directed by Austrian filmmaker [[Berthold Viertel]]), Rhodes was portrayed by Canadian actor [[Walter Huston]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0028176/ ''Rhodes of Africa'' (1936)].</ref>\n* Rhodes was played by [[Ferdinand Marian (actor)|Ferdinand Marian]] in the Nazi propaganda film ''[[Ohm Kr\u00fcger]]'' (1941), where he \u2013 like all other British characters in the film \u2013 was presented as an outright villain.\n* In 1901, Rhodes bought [[Dalham Hall]], Suffolk. In 1902, Colonel [[Frank Rhodes (British Army officer)|Frank Rhodes]] erected the village hall{{sfn|Dalham}} in the village of [[Dalham]], near [[Bury St Edmunds]], to commemorate the life of his brother, who had died before taking possession of the estate.\n* Rhodes was a peripheral but influential character in the historical novel ''[[The Covenant (novel)|The Covenant]]'' by [[James Michener]].\n* His memorial at Devil's Peak also served as a temple in ''[[The Adventures of Sinbad]]'' episode \"The Return of the Ronin\".\n* The 1976 [[Hugh Masekela]] album ''[[Colonial Man]]'' has a song  titled \"Cecil Rhodes\".\n* In 1996, BBC-TV made an eight-part television drama about Rhodes called ''[[Rhodes (TV series)|Rhodes: The Life and Legend of Cecil Rhodes]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115335/ \"Rhodes\" on IMDB]</ref> It was produced by David Drury and written by Antony Thomas. It tells the story of Rhodes' life through a series of flashbacks of conversations between him and Princess Catherine Radziwi\u0142\u0142 and also between her and people who knew him. It also shows the story of how she stalked and eventually ruined him. In the serial, Cecil Rhodes is played by [[Martin Shaw]], the younger Cecil Rhodes is played by his son Joe Shaw, and Princess Radziwi\u0142\u0142 is played by [[Frances Barber]]. In the serial Rhodes is portrayed as ruthless and greedy. The serial also suggests that he was homosexual.{{sfn|Godwin|1998}} Countering the implication of Rhodes' homosexuality, historian and journalist [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] wrote that Rhodes had been falsely smeared by the programme, commenting: \"In nine tendentious hours, Rhodes is to be presented as a corrupt and greedy money-grabber, a racist and paedophile, whose disgusting passion was to get his hands on young boys ... the BBC has spent \u00a310m of our money putting together a farrago of exaggerations and smears about this great man.\" [[Peter Godwin]] said of the film that \"it feels like a work overwhelmingly informed by malice, consistently seizing on the very worst interpretation of the man without really attempting to get under his skin. Rhodes was no 19th-century Hitler. He wasn't so much a freak as a man of his time.\"\n*Rhodes features prominently in Wilbur Smith\u2019s Ballantyne series of novels, fictional stories based amongst real events in Rhodes\u2019 lifetime\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cecil John Rhodes Statue]]\n* [[Rhodesia (region)]]\n{{Portal bar|Africa|British Empire|Biography|History}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|16em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n\n=== Monographs ===\n* {{cite book|ref={{sfnref|Aldrich and Wotherspoon|2001}}|last1=Aldrich|first1=Robert |last2=Wotherspoon|first2=Garry |title=Who's who in Gay and Lesbian History: From Antiquity to World War II|url=https://archive.org/details/whoswhoingaylesb00robe|url-access=registration|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-15982-1}}\n*{{cite book|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/primatealexander00alexiala#page/258/mode/2up|editor-first= Eleanor |editor-last=Alexander |title= Primate Alexander, Archbishop of Armagh.

W. E. Johns'''. He was the creator of the fictional air-adventurer ''[[Biggles]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nJohns was born in [[Bengeo]], [[Hertford]], England, the son of Richard Eastman Johns, a fabric tailor, and Elizabeth Johns ([[Married and maiden names|n\u00e9e]] Earl), the daughter of a master butcher. A younger brother, Russell Ernest Johns, was born on 24 October 1895. Johns' early ambition was to be a soldier, and he was a crack shot with a rifle. From January 1905, he attended [[Richard Hale School|Hertford Grammar School]].<ref name=johns>{{cite web | url=http://www.wejohns.com/Biography/Biography1/ | title=A Brief Biography of Captain W. E. Johns  Part One | website=Wejohns.com | accessdate=17 October 2012}}</ref> He also attended evening classes at the local art school.\n\nJohns was not a natural scholar. He included some of his experiences at this school in his book ''Biggles Goes to School'' (1951). In the summer of 1907 he was [[Apprenticeship|apprenticed]] to a county municipal [[Surveying|surveyor]] for four years and in 1912 was appointed as a sanitary inspector in [[Swaffham]] in [[Norfolk]]. Soon afterwards, his father died of [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 47. On 6 October 1914 Johns married Maude Penelope Hunt (1882\u20131961), the daughter of the Rev. John Hunt, vicar of [[Little Dunham]], Norfolk.<ref name=johns/> Their only son, William Earl Carmichael Johns, was born in March 1916.\n\n==Military career and the First World War ==\nIn 1913, while living in [[Swaffham]], and working as a sanitary inspector, Johns enlisted in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] as a [[Trooper (rank)|trooper]] in the [[Norfolk Yeomanry|King's Own Royal Regiment (Norfolk Yeomanry)]].  The regiment was mobilised in August 1914 and was sent overseas in September 1915, embarking on [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']].  The Norfolk Yeomanry fought (as infantry) at [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] until December when they were withdrawn to [[Egypt]].  In September 1916 Johns transferred to the [[Machine Gun Corps]]. While serving on the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Macedonian front]] in [[Greece]] he was hospitalised with [[malaria]].  After recovering, he was commissioned into the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) in September 1917 as a temporary [[second lieutenant]]<ref name=\"LG 19 October 1917\">{{London Gazette |issue=30347 |date=19 October 1917 |page=10886 }}</ref>  and posted back to England for flight training.\n\nJohns undertook his initial flying training at the short-lived airfield at [[Coley Park]] in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], flying the [[Farman MF.11|Farman MF.11 Shorthorn]] aircraft. He was then posted to No.25 Flying Training School at [[Thetford]] in Norfolk, closer to where his wife Maude and son Jack were living.<ref name=cpabac>{{cite web | title = The Coley Park Aerodrome and CWS Jam Works | url = http://www.users.on.net/~kevros/coleypark/oc_aerocws.htm | publisher = Coley Park & Beyond (Kevin Rosier)|website=Users.on.net | accessdate =15 February 2008}}</ref>\n \nOn 1 April 1918, Johns was appointed flying instructor at [[Marske-by-the-Sea]] in [[Yorkshire]]. The aircraft of the time were very unreliable and he wrote off three planes in three days through engine failure \u2013 crashing into the sea, then the sand, and then through a fellow officer's back door. Later, he was caught in fog over the [[River Tees|Tees]], missed [[Hartlepool]] and narrowly escaped flying into a cliff. Shooting one's own propeller off with a forward-mounted machine-gun with malfunctioning [[synchronization gear|synchronisation]] was a fairly common accident, and it happened to Johns twice. The Commanding Officer at Marske was a Major Champion, known as 'Gimlet', a name used later by Johns for the hero of a series of stories. \n\nDuring this time Johns's probationary commission was confirmed<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30887 |date=6 September 1918 |page=10551}}</ref>. He continued to serve as a flying instructor until August 1918 when he transferred to [[No. 55 Squadron RAF]], at the time part of the [[Independent Air Force]], a section of the Royal Air Force that had been formed for the purpose of bombing targets deep inside Germany. Casualties in the Independent Air Force were high and Johns' career flying strategic bombing missions was characteristically short, lasting only six weeks. On 16 September 1918 he was piloting one of six [[Airco DH.4|DH.4]]s on their way to bomb [[Mannheim]] when his aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire and he was forced to drop out of formation. He jettisoned his single {{convert|250|lb|kg|adj=on}} bomb and turned for home, but was attacked by a number of [[Fokker D.VII]] fighters. During a lengthy but one-sided battle, Johns' observer and rear-gunner, Second Lieutenant Alfred Edward Amey, was badly wounded and the aircraft shot down. The victory was credited to [[Georg Weiner]], the commander of [[Jagdstaffel 3]].<ref name=\"Hart\" /> Johns and Amey were taken prisoner by German troops: Johns received a leg wound during the battle and was slightly injured in the crash, but Amey died of his injuries later that day.<ref name=\"Hart\">{{cite book | title=Aces Falling: War Above The Trenches, 1918 | publisher=W&N | author=Hart, Peter | year=2007 | page=278 | isbn=0297846531}}</ref><ref name=\"auction\">{{cite web | url=http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/medals-royal-flying-corps-biggles-observer-s-casu-1-c-h46sfkylnv | title=Bosleys 2005, Lot 556 | website=Invaluable.com | accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref> <ref group=\"Note\">Amey's medals were sold at auction in the United Kingdom in 2005, in a lot that included a letter to his family from Johns, describing the circumstances of his death ''(see: Bosleys 2005, Lot 556)''.

In Birmingham  he met Doris 'Dol' May Leigh<ref name=johns2 /> (1900\u20131969), daughter of Alfred Broughton Leigh. They later moved to [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] when Johns was posted there. Although he never divorced Maude Hunt, Doris Leigh was known as 'Mrs Johns' until her death. Johns continued to pay for his wife and son's upkeep and for her nursing care (she suffered from acute arthritis).<ref name=johns2 />\n\nOn 15 October 1927, he was transferred to the reserves.<ref name=\"LG 11 October 1927\">{{London Gazette |issue=33319 |date=11 October 1927 |page=6402 }}</ref> Four years later, on 15 October 1931, he relinquished his commission.<ref name=\"LG 22 December 1931\">{{London Gazette |issue=33782 |date=22 December 1931 |page=8260 }}</ref>\n\n==Writing==\n{{see also|List of works by W. E. Johns}}\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Biggles of 266 cover.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of ''Biggles of 266'']] -->\nW. E. Johns was a prolific author and editor. In his 46-year writing career (1922\u201368) he penned over 160 books, including nearly one hundred Biggles books, more than sixty other novels and factual books, and scores of magazine articles and short stories.\n\nHis first novel, ''Mossyface'',<ref group=\"Note\">Mossy Face was a name given by the Allies to [[Havrincourt|Havrincourt Wood]]: it is mentioned in some of the ''Biggles'' stories and in some pilot's memoirs of the period.</ref> was published in 1922 under the pen name \"William Earle\". After leaving the RAF, Johns became a newspaper air correspondent, as well as editing and illustrating books about flying. At the request of John Hamilton Ltd, he created the magazine ''Popular Flying'' which first appeared in March 1932. It was in the pages of ''Popular Flying'' that Biggles first appeared.\n\nThe first Biggles book, ''The Camels are Coming'' (a reference to the [[Sopwith Camel]] aeroplane), was published in August 1932 and Johns would continue to write Biggles stories until his death in 1968. At first, the Biggles stories were credited to \"William Earle\", but later Johns adopted the more familiar \"Capt. W. E. Johns\". While his apparent final RAF rank of [[flying officer]] was equivalent to an army (or RFC) lieutenant, [[captain]] is commonly used for the commander of a vessel or aircraft.\n\nJohns was also a regular contributor to ''[[The Modern Boy]]'' magazine in the late 1930s as well as editing (and writing for) both ''Popular Flying'' and ''[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]]''. From the early 1930s Johns called for the training of more pilots, for if there were not enough when war came, \"training would have to be rushed, and under-trained airmen would die in accidents or in combat against better trained German pilots.\"<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/biggles-flies-uncensored-more-whisky-less-jingoism-8944480.html Patrick Cockburn, \"Biggles flies uncensored: more whisky, less jingoism.\" ''[[The Independent]]'', Sunday 17 November 2013] Retrieved 23 November 2013.</ref>  He was removed as editor at the beginning of 1939, probably as a direct result of a scathing editorial, strongly opposed to the policy of [[Appeasement of Hitler|appeasement]] and highly critical of several [[Conservative Party (UK)#1920-1963|Conservative]] statesmen of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popularflying.com/Covers/81/ |title=POPULAR FLYING MAGAZINE \u2013 ISSUE 1 (0F 88) |website=Popularflying.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-19}}</ref> Cockburn, however, feels that the government was concerned about being so \"expertly attacked\" on the lack of trained pilots by the editor of the most widely read aviation magazines in the world, including readers \"in the RAF or connected with flying.\"<ref>Cockburn 2013.</ref>\n\nJohns' opposition to appeasement is reflected in some of his books. For example, in ''The Black Peril'' (1935) the storyline revolves around German preparations for conquest. Even more advanced in his thinking, for that time, was the story ''Biggles Air Commodore'' (1937) which alludes to Japanese preparations for conquest of British colonies in the Far East.\n\nApart from \"Biggles\", his other multi-volume fiction series were:\n\n* The 6-volume \"Steeley\" series (1936\u20131939), featuring former First World War pilot turned crime-fighter Deeley Montfort Delaroy (nicknamed \"Steeley\").\n* The 11-volume \"[[Worrals]]\" series (1941\u20131950), detailing the exploits of plucky WAAF [[Flight Officer]] Joan \"Worrals\" Worralson (who was also the subject of three short stories); these were created at the request of the [[Air Ministry]] to inspire young women to join the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]].\n* The 10-volume \"Gimlet\" series (1943\u20131954), whose hero is the dashing British [[commando]] [[Captain Lorrington \"Gimlet\" King]].\n* A 10-volume science fiction series (1954\u20131963) that follows the interplanetary adventures of retired RAF Group Captain Timothy 'Tiger' Clinton, his son Rex, scientist Professor Lucius Brane (who invents a spaceship powered by [[cosmic rays]]) and Brane's resourceful butler Judkins.\n\nJohns also wrote eight other books of juvenile fiction, twelve books of fiction for adults, and eight factual books, including several books on aviation, books on pirates and treasure hunting, and a book on gardening, ''The Passing Show''.\n\nUnusually among children's writers of the time, from 1935 Johns employed a working-class character as an equal member of the Biggles team \u2013 \"Ginger\" Habblethwaite, later Hebblethwaite, the son of a Northumberland miner. However, readers never learn his real given name, and he proclaims himself a Yorkshireman once or twice.\n\n==Personal life==\nFrom 1953  Johns resided at Park House, Hampton Court Road, at [[Hampton Court]] in [[Middlesex]].<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3279043/The-mansion-daring-adventures-Biggles-written-author-Captain-William-Earl-Johns-gone-sale-3-75-million.html \"London mansion where the Biggles' children's books were written by Capt.

W. E. Johns'''. He was the creator of the fictional air-adventurer ''[[Biggles]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nJohns was born in [[Bengeo]], [[Hertford]], England, the son of Richard Eastman Johns, a fabric tailor, and Elizabeth Johns ([[Married and maiden names|n\u00e9e]] Earl), the daughter of a master butcher. A younger brother, Russell Ernest Johns, was born on 24 October 1895. Johns' early ambition was to be a soldier, and he was a crack shot with a rifle. From January 1905, he attended [[Richard Hale School|Hertford Grammar School]].<ref name=johns>{{cite web | url=http://www.wejohns.com/Biography/Biography1/ | title=A Brief Biography of Captain W. E. Johns  Part One | website=Wejohns.com | accessdate=17 October 2012}}</ref> He also attended evening classes at the local art school.\n\nJohns was not a natural scholar. He included some of his experiences at this school in his book ''Biggles Goes to School'' (1951). In the summer of 1907 he was [[Apprenticeship|apprenticed]] to a county municipal [[Surveying|surveyor]] for four years and in 1912 was appointed as a sanitary inspector in [[Swaffham]] in [[Norfolk]]. Soon afterwards, his father died of [[tuberculosis]] at the age of 47. On 6 October 1914 Johns married Maude Penelope Hunt (1882\u20131961), the daughter of the Rev. John Hunt, vicar of [[Little Dunham]], Norfolk.<ref name=johns/> Their only son, William Earl Carmichael Johns, was born in March 1916.\n\n==Military career and the First World War ==\nIn 1913, while living in [[Swaffham]], and working as a sanitary inspector, Johns enlisted in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] as a [[Trooper (rank)|trooper]] in the [[Norfolk Yeomanry|King's Own Royal Regiment (Norfolk Yeomanry)]].  The regiment was mobilised in August 1914 and was sent overseas in September 1915, embarking on [[RMS Olympic|RMS ''Olympic'']].  The Norfolk Yeomanry fought (as infantry) at [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] until December when they were withdrawn to [[Egypt]].  In September 1916 Johns transferred to the [[Machine Gun Corps]]. While serving on the [[Macedonian front (World War I)|Macedonian front]] in [[Greece]] he was hospitalised with [[malaria]].  After recovering, he was commissioned into the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) in September 1917 as a temporary [[second lieutenant]]<ref name=\"LG 19 October 1917\">{{London Gazette |issue=30347 |date=19 October 1917 |page=10886 }}</ref>  and posted back to England for flight training.\n\nJohns undertook his initial flying training at the short-lived airfield at [[Coley Park]] in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], flying the [[Farman MF.11|Farman MF.11 Shorthorn]] aircraft. He was then posted to No.25 Flying Training School at [[Thetford]] in Norfolk, closer to where his wife Maude and son Jack were living.<ref name=cpabac>{{cite web | title = The Coley Park Aerodrome and CWS Jam Works | url = http://www.users.on.net/~kevros/coleypark/oc_aerocws.htm | publisher = Coley Park & Beyond (Kevin Rosier)|website=Users.on.net | accessdate =15 February 2008}}</ref>\n \nOn 1 April 1918, Johns was appointed flying instructor at [[Marske-by-the-Sea]] in [[Yorkshire]]. The aircraft of the time were very unreliable and he wrote off three planes in three days through engine failure \u2013 crashing into the sea, then the sand, and then through a fellow officer's back door. Later, he was caught in fog over the [[Tees]], missed [[Hartlepool]] and narrowly escaped flying into a cliff. Shooting one's own propeller off with a forward-mounted machine-gun with malfunctioning [[synchronization gear|synchronisation]] was a fairly common accident, and it happened to Johns twice. The Commanding Officer at Marske was a Major Champion, known as 'Gimlet', a name used later by Johns for the hero of a series of stories. \n\nDuring this time Johns's probationary commission was confirmed<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30887 |date=6 September 1918 |page=10551}}</ref>. He continued to serve as a flying instructor until August 1918 when he transferred to [[No. 55 Squadron RAF]], at the time part of the [[Independent Air Force]], a section of the Royal Air Force that had been formed for the purpose of bombing targets deep inside Germany. Casualties in the Independent Air Force were high and Johns' career flying strategic bombing missions was characteristically short, lasting only six weeks. On 16 September 1918 he was piloting one of six [[Airco DH.4|DH.4]]s on their way to bomb [[Mannheim]] when his aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire and he was forced to drop out of formation. He jettisoned his single {{convert|250|lb|kg|adj=on}} bomb and turned for home, but was attacked by a number of [[Fokker D.VII]] fighters. During a lengthy but one-sided battle, Johns' observer and rear-gunner, Second Lieutenant Alfred Edward Amey, was badly wounded and the aircraft shot down. The victory was credited to [[Georg Weiner]], the commander of [[Jagdstaffel 3]].<ref name=\"Hart\" /> Johns and Amey were taken prisoner by German troops: Johns received a leg wound during the battle and was slightly injured in the crash, but Amey died of his injuries later that day.<ref name=\"Hart\">{{cite book | title=Aces Falling: War Above The Trenches, 1918 | publisher=W&N | author=Hart, Peter | year=2007 | page=278 | isbn=0297846531}}</ref><ref name=\"auction\">{{cite web | url=http://www.invaluable.com/auction-lot/medals-royal-flying-corps-biggles-observer-s-casu-1-c-h46sfkylnv | title=Bosleys 2005, Lot 556 | website=Invaluable.com | accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref> <ref group=\"Note\">Amey's medals were sold at auction in the United Kingdom in 2005, in a lot that included a letter to his family from Johns, describing the circumstances of his death ''(see: Bosleys 2005, Lot 556)''.

His RAF commission had been extended a further four years and he had moved to [[Birmingham]], again working as a recruitment officer. In Birmingham  he met Doris 'Dol' May Leigh<ref name=johns2 /> (1900\u20131969), daughter of Alfred Broughton Leigh. They later moved to [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] when Johns was posted there. Although he never divorced Maude Hunt, Doris Leigh was known as 'Mrs Johns' until her death. Johns continued to pay for his wife and son's upkeep and for her nursing care (she suffered from acute arthritis).<ref name=johns2 />\n\nOn 15 October 1927, he was transferred to the reserves.<ref name=\"LG 11 October 1927\">{{London Gazette |issue=33319 |date=11 October 1927 |page=6402 }}</ref> Four years later, on 15 October 1931, he relinquished his commission.<ref name=\"LG 22 December 1931\">{{London Gazette |issue=33782 |date=22 December 1931 |page=8260 }}</ref>\n\n==Writing==\n{{see also|List of works by W. E. Johns}}\n<!-- Commented out: [[File:Biggles of 266 cover.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of ''Biggles of 266'']] -->\nW. E. Johns was a prolific author and editor. In his 46-year writing career (1922\u201368) he penned over 160 books, including nearly one hundred Biggles books, more than sixty other novels and factual books, and scores of magazine articles and short stories.\n\nHis first novel, ''Mossyface'',<ref group=\"Note\">Mossy Face was a name given by the Allies to [[Havrincourt|Havrincourt Wood]]: it is mentioned in some of the ''Biggles'' stories and in some pilot's memoirs of the period.</ref> was published in 1922 under the pen name \"William Earle\". After leaving the RAF, Johns became a newspaper air correspondent, as well as editing and illustrating books about flying. At the request of John Hamilton Ltd, he created the magazine ''Popular Flying'' which first appeared in March 1932. It was in the pages of ''Popular Flying'' that Biggles first appeared.\n\nThe first Biggles book, ''The Camels are Coming'' (a reference to the [[Sopwith Camel]] aeroplane), was published in August 1932 and Johns would continue to write Biggles stories until his death in 1968. At first, the Biggles stories were credited to \"William Earle\", but later Johns adopted the more familiar \"Capt. W. E. Johns\". While his apparent final RAF rank of [[flying officer]] was equivalent to an army (or RFC) lieutenant, [[captain]] is commonly used for the commander of a vessel or aircraft.\n\nJohns was also a regular contributor to ''[[The Modern Boy]]'' magazine in the late 1930s as well as editing (and writing for) both ''Popular Flying'' and ''[[Flying (magazine)|Flying]]''. From the early 1930s Johns called for the training of more pilots, for if there were not enough when war came, \"training would have to be rushed, and under-trained airmen would die in accidents or in combat against better trained German pilots.\"<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/biggles-flies-uncensored-more-whisky-less-jingoism-8944480.html Patrick Cockburn, \"Biggles flies uncensored: more whisky, less jingoism.\" ''[[The Independent]]'', Sunday 17 November 2013] Retrieved 23 November 2013.</ref>  He was removed as editor at the beginning of 1939, probably as a direct result of a scathing editorial, strongly opposed to the policy of [[Appeasement of Hitler|appeasement]] and highly critical of several [[Conservative Party (UK)#1920-1963|Conservative]] statesmen of the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popularflying.com/Covers/81/ |title=POPULAR FLYING MAGAZINE \u2013 ISSUE 1 (0F 88) |website=Popularflying.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-19}}</ref> Cockburn, however, feels that the government was concerned about being so \"expertly attacked\" on the lack of trained pilots by the editor of the most widely read aviation magazines in the world, including readers \"in the RAF or connected with flying.\"<ref>Cockburn 2013.</ref>\n\nJohns' opposition to appeasement is reflected in some of his books. For example, in ''The Black Peril'' (1935) the storyline revolves around German preparations for conquest. Even more advanced in his thinking, for that time, was the story ''Biggles Air Commodore'' (1937) which alludes to Japanese preparations for conquest of British colonies in the Far East.\n\nApart from \"Biggles\", his other multi-volume fiction series were:\n\n* The 6-volume \"Steeley\" series (1936\u20131939), featuring former First World War pilot turned crime-fighter Deeley Montfort Delaroy (nicknamed \"Steeley\").\n* The 11-volume \"[[Worrals]]\" series (1941\u20131950), detailing the exploits of plucky WAAF [[Flight Officer]] Joan \"Worrals\" Worralson (who was also the subject of three short stories); these were created at the request of the [[Air Ministry]] to inspire young women to join the [[Women's Auxiliary Air Force]].\n* The 10-volume \"Gimlet\" series (1943\u20131954), whose hero is the dashing British [[commando]] [[Captain Lorrington \"Gimlet\" King]].\n* A 10-volume science fiction series (1954\u20131963) that follows the interplanetary adventures of retired RAF Group Captain Timothy 'Tiger' Clinton, his son Rex, scientist Professor Lucius Brane (who invents a spaceship powered by [[cosmic rays]]) and Brane's resourceful butler Judkins.\n\nJohns also wrote eight other books of juvenile fiction, twelve books of fiction for adults, and eight factual books, including several books on aviation, books on pirates and treasure hunting, and a book on gardening, ''The Passing Show''.\n\nUnusually among children's writers of the time, from 1935 Johns employed a working-class character as an equal member of the Biggles team \u2013 \"Ginger\" Habblethwaite, later Hebblethwaite, the son of a Northumberland miner. However, readers never learn his real given name, and he proclaims himself a Yorkshireman once or twice.\n\n==Personal life==\nFrom 1953  Johns resided at Park House, Hampton Court Road, at [[Hampton Court]] in [[Middlesex]].<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3279043/The-mansion-daring-adventures-Biggles-written-author-Captain-William-Earl-Johns-gone-sale-3-75-million.html \"London mansion where the Biggles' children's books were written by Capt.

Shortly before he died he was writing the final Biggles story, entitled ''Biggles does some Homework'', which shows Biggles at last preparing to retire, and meeting his [[Multiracial|mixed-race]] replacement.
