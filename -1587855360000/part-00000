Aira has published over a hundred short books of stories, novels and essays.  In fact, at least since 1993 a hallmark of his work is a truly frenetic level of writing and publication\u2014two to five novella-length books each year.<ref>{{cite book |title=Tropical kitsch: mass media in Latin American art and literature |last=Santos |first=Lidia |year=2006 |publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers |isbn=978-1-55876-353-1 |page=162 }}</ref>  He has lectured at the [[University of Buenos Aires]], on [[Copi]] and [[Arthur Rimbaud]], and at the [[University of Rosario]] on [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]], and has translated and edited books from France, England, Italy, Brazil, Spain, Mexico, and Venezuela.<ref>[http://ndbooks.com/author/cesar-aira http://ndbooks.com/author/cesar-aira] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017230001/http://ndbooks.com/author/cesar-aira |date=17 October 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==His work==\nBesides his fiction, and the translation work he does for a living, Aira also writes literary criticism, including monographic studies of Copi, the poet [[Alejandra Pizarnik]], and the nineteenth-century British limerick and nonsense writer [[Edward Lear]].  He wrote a short book, ''Las tres fechas'' (''The Three Dates''), arguing for the central importance, when approaching some minor eccentric writers, of examining the moment of their lives about which they are writing, the date of completion of the work, and the date of publication of the work.  Aira also was the literary executor of the complete works of his friend the poet and novelist [[Osvaldo Lamborghini]] (1940\u20131985).\n\n==Style==\nAira has often spoken in interviews of elaborating an avant-garde aesthetic in which, rather than editing what he has written, he engages in a \"flight forward\" (''fuga hacia adelante'') to improvise a way out of the corners he writes himself into. Aira also seeks in his own work, and praises in the work of others (such as the Argentine-Parisian cartoonist and comic novelist [[Copi]]), the \"continuum\" (''el continuo'') of a constant momentum in the fictional narrative.  As a result, his fictions can jump radically from one genre to another, and often deploy narrative strategies from popular culture and \"subliterary\" genres like pulp science fiction and television soap operas. He frequently refuses to conform to generic expectations for how a novel ought to end, leaving many of his fictions quite open-ended.\n\nWhile his subject matter ranges from Surrealist or Dadaist quasi-nonsense to fantastic tales set in his Buenos Aires neighborhood of [[Flores, Buenos Aires|Flores]], Aira also returns frequently to Argentina\u2019s nineteenth century (two books translated into English, ''The Hare'' and ''[[An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter]]'', are examples of this; so is the best-known novel of his early years, ''Ema la cautiva'' (''Emma, the Captive'')).  He also returns regularly to play with stereotypes of an exotic East, such as in ''Una novela china'', (''A Chinese Novel''); ''El volante'' (''The Flyer''), and ''El peque\u00f1o monje budista'' (''The Little Buddhist Monk'').  Aira also enjoys mocking himself and his childhood home town, Coronel Pringles, in fictions such as ''C\u00f3mo me hice monja'' (''[[How I Became a Nun]]''), ''C\u00f3mo me re\u00ed'' (''How I Laughed''), ''El cerebro musical'' (''The Musical Brain'') and ''Las curas milagrosas del doctor Aira'' (''The Miraculous Cures of Dr. Aira'').  His novella ''La prueba'' (1992) served as the basis\u2014or point of departure, as only the first half-hour follows the novella\u2014of Diego Lerman's film ''Tan de repente'' (''Suddenly'') (2002).  His novel ''C\u00f3mo me hice monja'' (How I Became a Nun) was selected as one of the ten best publications in [[Spain]] in the year 1998.\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n* [[Konex Award]] - translation (1994)<ref name=kat>{{cite web |url=http://www.fundacionkonex.org/b2344-cesar-aira |title= C\u00e9sar Aira|publisher=[[Konex Foundation]]|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Konex Award]] - novel (2004)<ref name=kat></ref>\n* [[Prix Roger Caillois]] (2014)<ref name=prc>{{cite web |url=http://mal217.org/fr/agenda/prix-roger-caillois-2014 |title=Prix Roger Caillois 2014|publisher=Maison de l'Am\u00e9rique Latine|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]] - finalist (2014)<ref name=nipl>{{cite web |url=https://www.neustadtprize.org/2014-mia-couto/ |title=Neustadt Laureates 2014 \u2013 Mia Couto|publisher=The Neustadt Prizes|accessdate=2 May 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Man Booker International Prize]] - finalist (2015)<ref name=mbip>{{cite web |url=http://themanbookerprize.com/international/backlist/2015|title=The Man Booker International Prize 2015|publisher=The Man Booker Prize|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref>\n* America Awards (2016)<ref name=americaawards>{{cite web|url=http://www.greeninteger.com/america.cfm|title=America Awards|accessdate=28 April 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131129013735/http://www.greeninteger.com/america.cfm|archivedate=29 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* [[Manuel Rojas Ibero-American Narrative Award]] (2016)<ref name=manuelrojasprize>{{cite web|url=http://www.manuelrojas.cl/?page_id=85&lang=es|title=Manuel Rojas Award|publisher=Fundaci\u00f3n Manuel Rojas|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\nA partial bibliography:\n\n===Novels===\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* ''Moreira'' (1975).

Aira has published over a hundred short books of stories, novels and essays.  In fact, at least since 1993 a hallmark of his work is a truly frenetic level of writing and publication\u2014two to five novella-length books each year.<ref>{{cite book |title=Tropical kitsch: mass media in Latin American art and literature |last=Santos |first=Lidia |year=2006 |publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers |isbn=978-1-55876-353-1 |page=162 }}</ref>  He has lectured at the [[University of Buenos Aires]], on [[Copi]] and [[Arthur Rimbaud]], and at the [[University of Rosario]] on [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]], and has translated and edited books from France, England, Italy, Brazil, Spain, Mexico, and Venezuela.<ref>[http://ndbooks.com/author/cesar-aira http://ndbooks.com/author/cesar-aira] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017230001/http://ndbooks.com/author/cesar-aira |date=17 October 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==His work==\nBesides his fiction, and the translation work he does for a living, Aira also writes literary criticism, including monographic studies of Copi, the poet [[Alejandra Pizarnik]], and the nineteenth-century British limerick and nonsense writer [[Edward Lear]].  He wrote a short book, ''Las tres fechas'' (''The Three Dates''), arguing for the central importance, when approaching some minor eccentric writers, of examining the moment of their lives about which they are writing, the date of completion of the work, and the date of publication of the work.  Aira also was the literary executor of the complete works of his friend the poet and novelist [[Osvaldo Lamborghini]] (1940\u20131985).\n\n==Style==\nAira has often spoken in interviews of elaborating an avant-garde aesthetic in which, rather than editing what he has written, he engages in a \"flight forward\" (''fuga hacia adelante'') to improvise a way out of the corners he writes himself into. Aira also seeks in his own work, and praises in the work of others (such as the Argentine-Parisian cartoonist and comic novelist [[Copi]]), the \"continuum\" (''el continuo'') of a constant momentum in the fictional narrative.  As a result, his fictions can jump radically from one genre to another, and often deploy narrative strategies from popular culture and \"subliterary\" genres like pulp science fiction and television soap operas. He frequently refuses to conform to generic expectations for how a novel ought to end, leaving many of his fictions quite open-ended.\n\nWhile his subject matter ranges from Surrealist or Dadaist quasi-nonsense to fantastic tales set in his Buenos Aires neighborhood of [[Flores, Buenos Aires|Flores]], Aira also returns frequently to Argentina\u2019s nineteenth century (two books translated into English, ''The Hare'' and ''[[An Episode in the Life of a Landscape Painter]]'', are examples of this; so is the best-known novel of his early years, ''Ema la cautiva'' (''Emma, the Captive'')).  He also returns regularly to play with stereotypes of an exotic East, such as in ''Una novela china'', (''A Chinese Novel''); ''El volante'' (''The Flyer''), and ''El peque\u00f1o monje budista'' (''The Little Buddhist Monk'').  Aira also enjoys mocking himself and his childhood home town, Coronel Pringles, in fictions such as ''C\u00f3mo me hice monja'' (''[[How I Became a Nun]]''), ''C\u00f3mo me re\u00ed'' (''How I Laughed''), ''El cerebro musical'' (''The Musical Brain'') and ''Las curas milagrosas del doctor Aira'' (''The Miraculous Cures of Dr. Aira'').  His novella ''La prueba'' (1992) served as the basis\u2014or point of departure, as only the first half-hour follows the novella\u2014of Diego Lerman's film ''Tan de repente'' (''Suddenly'') (2002).  His novel ''C\u00f3mo me hice monja'' (How I Became a Nun) was selected as one of the ten best publications in [[Spain]] in the year 1998.\n\n== Awards and honours ==\n* [[Konex Award]] - translation (1994)<ref name=kat>{{cite web |url=http://www.fundacionkonex.org/b2344-cesar-aira |title= C\u00e9sar Aira|publisher=[[Konex Foundation]]|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Konex Award]] - novel (2004)<ref name=kat></ref>\n* [[Prix Roger Caillois]] (2014)<ref name=prc>{{cite web |url=http://mal217.org/fr/agenda/prix-roger-caillois-2014 |title=Prix Roger Caillois 2014|publisher=Maison de l'Am\u00e9rique Latine|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]] - finalist (2014)<ref name=nipl>{{cite web |url=https://www.neustadtprize.org/2014-mia-couto/ |title=Neustadt Laureates 2014 \u2013 Mia Couto|publisher=The Neustadt Prizes|accessdate=2 May 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Man Booker International Prize]] - finalist (2015)<ref name=mbip>{{cite web |url=http://themanbookerprize.com/international/backlist/2015|title=The Man Booker International Prize 2015|publisher=The Man Booker Prize|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref>\n* America Awards (2016)<ref name=americaawards>{{cite web|url=http://www.greeninteger.com/america.cfm|title=America Awards|accessdate=28 April 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131129013735/http://www.greeninteger.com/america.cfm|archivedate=29 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* [[Manuel Rojas Ibero-American Narrative Award]] (2016)<ref name=manuelrojasprize>{{cite web|url=http://www.manuelrojas.cl/?page_id=85&lang=es|title=Manuel Rojas Award|publisher=Fundaci\u00f3n Manuel Rojas|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\nA partial bibliography:\n\n===Novels===\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* ''Moreira'' (1975).
