Railroad|Petaluma & Santa Rosa Railroad Station]]]] Santa Rosa was founded in 1833 and named after [[Saint Rose of Lima]].  Before the arrival of Europeans, the Santa Rosa Plain was home to a strong and populous tribe of [[Pomo]] natives known as the Bitakomtara. The Bitakomtara controlled the area closely, barring passage to others until permission was arranged. Those who entered without permission were subject to harsh penalties. The tribe gathered at ceremonial times on Santa Rosa Creek near present-day [[Spring Lake Regional Park]]. Upon the arrival of Europeans, the Pomos were decimated by [[smallpox]] brought from Europe. By 1900 the Pomo population had decreased by 95%.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfPfAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA90 |page=90 |title=Sacred Sonoma: Sacred Sites and Alignments in Sonoma County, California |edition=Revised |first=Beth |last=Winegarner |publisher=Lulu |year=2007 |isbn=9781430320678}}</ref>\n\nThe first known permanent European settlement of Santa Rosa was the homestead of the Carrillo family, in-laws to [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]], who settled the [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] [[pueblo]] and [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]] area. In the 1830s, during the Mexican period, the family of [[Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez de Carrillo]] built an adobe house on their [[Rancho Cabeza de Santa Rosa]] land grant, just east of what later became downtown Santa Rosa. Allegedly, however, by the 1820s, before the Carrillos built their adobe in the 1830s, [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and Mexican settlers from nearby Sonoma and other settlements to the south raised [[livestock]] in the area and slaughtered animals at the fork of the [[Santa Rosa Creek]] and [[Matanzas Creek]], near the intersection of modern-day Santa Rosa Avenue and Sonoma Avenue. This is supposedly the origin of the name of Matanzas Creek as, because of its use as a slaughtering place, the confluence came to be called La Matanza.\n\n[[File:Bird's eye view of Santa Rosa, Sonoma County, Cal., 1876. LOC 76693083.jpg|thumb|Panoramic map of Santa Rosa from 1871]]\nBy the 1850s, a [[History of Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo]] post and general store were established in what is now downtown Santa Rosa. In the mid-1850s, several prominent locals, including Julio Carrillo, son of Maria Carrillo, laid out the grid street pattern for Santa Rosa with a [[public square]] in the center, a pattern which largely remains as the street pattern for downtown Santa Rosa to this day, despite changes to the central square, now called Old Courthouse Square.\n\nIn 1867, the county recognized Santa Rosa as an [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] city and in 1868 the state officially confirmed the incorporation, making it officially the third incorporated city in Sonoma County, after Petaluma, incorporated in 1858, and [[Healdsburg]], incorporated in 1867.\n\nThe [[U.S. Census]] records, among others, show that after California became a state, Santa Rosa grew steadily early on, despite initially lagging behind nearby Petaluma in the 1850s and early 1860s. According to the U.S. Census, in 1870 Santa Rosa was the eighth largest city in California, and county seat of one of the most populous counties in the state. Growth and development after that was steady but never rapid. The city continued to grow when other early population centers declined or stagnated, but by 1900 it was being overtaken by many other newer population centers in the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California. According to a 1905 article in the ''[[Press Democrat]]'' newspaper reporting on the \"Battle of the Trains\", the city had just over 10,000 people at the time.\n\nThe [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] essentially destroyed the entire downtown, but the city's population did not greatly suffer. However, after that period the population growth of Santa Rosa, as with most of the area, was very slow.\n\nFamed director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] filmed his thriller ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' in Santa Rosa in 1943; the film gives glimpses of Santa Rosa in the 1940s. Many of the downtown buildings seen in the film no longer exist due to major reconstruction following the strong earthquakes in October 1969. However, some, like the rough-stone [[Northwestern Pacific Railroad]] depot and the prominent Empire Building (built in 1910 with a gold-topped clock tower), still survive.  A scene at the bank was filmed at the corner of Fourth Street and Mendocino Avenue (at present day Old Courthouse square); the [[S. H. Kress & Co.|KRESS]] building on Fourth Street is also visible. However, the courthouse and bank are now gone. The Coen brothers' 2001 film ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]'' is set in Santa Rosa c. 1949.\n\n===Since World War II===\n[[File:Santa Rosa, Empire Building (2012).jpg|thumb|upright|Old Courthouse Square is the heart of downtown Santa Rosa. This is the Empire Building, completed in 1910 and a Sonoma County landmark. It was seen in ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' by [[Alfred Hitchcock]].]]\nSanta Rosa grew following World War II because it was the location for [[Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Santa Rosa]], the remnants of which are now located in southwest Santa Rosa. The city was a convenient location for San Francisco travelers bound for the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]].\n\nThe population increased by 2/3 between 1950 and 1970, an average of 1,000 new residents a year over the 20 years. Some of the increase was from immigration, and some from annexation of portions of the surrounding area.\n\nIn 1958 the United States Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization designated Santa Rosa as one of its eight regional headquarters, with jurisdiction over Region 7, which included [[American Samoa]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Guam]], [[Hawaii]], [[Nevada]], and [[Utah]]. Santa Rosa continued as a major center for [[United States civil defense|civil defense]] activity (under the Office of Emergency Planning and the Office of Emergency Preparedness) until 1979 when the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) was created in its place, ending the civil defense's 69-year history.<ref name=\"OEP\">{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/396.html|title=Records of the office of Emergency Preparedness|accessdate=2008-08-30}}</ref>\n\nWhen the City Council adopted the city's first modern General Plan in 1991, the population was about 113,000. In the 21 years following 1970, Santa Rosa grew by about 3,000 residents a year\u2014triple the average growth during the previous twenty years.\n\n''Santa Rosa 2010'', the 1991 General Plan, called for a population of 175,000 in 2010. The Council expanded the city's urban boundary to include all the land then planned for future annexation, and declared it would be Santa Rosa's \"ultimate\" boundary. The rapid growth that was being criticized as [[urban sprawl]] became routine [[infill]] development.\n\nAt the first five-year update of the plan, in 1996, the Council extended the planning period by ten years, renaming it ''Vision 2020'' (updated to ''Santa Rosa 2020'', and then again to ''Santa Rosa 2030 Vision''), and added more land and population. Now the City projects a population of 195,000 in 2020.\n\nSanta Rosa [[annexation|annexed]] the community of [[Roseland, California|Roseland]] in November 2017.<ref name=\"annex\">{{cite web|url=https://www.srcity.org/371/Roseland-Area-Annexation|title=Roseland Area Annexation|accessdate=2018-03-14}}</ref>\n\n===2017 firestorm===\n[[File:Fountaingrove_Round_Barn.jpg|thumb|upright|The former [[Nagasawa Kanaye#Fountaingrove|historic Fountaingrove Round Barn]], previously found at the southwestern base of Fountaingrove, was lost to fire.]]\n{{main|October 2017 Northern California wildfires|Tubbs Fire}}\nBeginning on the night of October 8, 2017, five percent of the city's homes were destroyed in the [[Tubbs Fire]], a 45,000-acre [[wildfire]] that claimed the lives of at least 19 people in Sonoma County.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sudek|first1=Julia Prodis|title=Santa Rosa fire: How a sudden firestorm devastated a city|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/09/santa-rosa-fire-how-a-sudden-firestorm-obliterated-a-city/|accessdate=October 9, 2017|work=The Mercury News|publisher=Digital First Media|date=October 9, 2017}}</ref> Named after its origin near Tubbs Lane and Highway 128 in nearby Napa County, the fire became a major section of the most destructive and third deadliest firestorm in California history.<ref name=\"calfire-top20\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fire.ca.gov/communications/downloads/fact_sheets/Top20_Destruction.pdf|title=Top 20 Most Destructive California Wildfires|website=CAL FIRE|accessdate=October 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kansaspublicradio.org/npr-news/firefighters-gain-ground-california-wildfires|title=Firefighters Gain Ground On California Wildfires|date=2017-10-16|work=Kansas Public Radio|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Tubbs-Fire-could-be-worst-in-California-history-12276628.php|title=It's now the deadliest wildfire disaster in California history|work=SFGate|access-date=2017-10-16}}</ref> Most homes in the Coffey Park, [[Larkfield-Wikiup, California|Larkfield-Wikiup]], and [[Fountain Grove, California|Fountain Grove]] neighborhoods were destroyed.\n\nA notable exception to the destruction in the area was the protection of more than 1000 animals at the renowned [[Safari West]] Wildlife Preserve northeast of Santa Rosa.

Other water bodies within the city include [[Fountaingrove Lake]], [[Lake Ralphine]], and [[Santa Rosa Creek Reservoir]].\n\nThe prominent visual features east of the city include [[Bennett Mountain|Bennett Peak]], [[Mount Hood (California)|Mount Hood]], and [[Sonoma Mountain|Sonoma]] and [[Taylor Mountain (Sonoma County, California)|Taylor Mountain]]s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Transactions of the California State Agricultural Society During the year 1901|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GNw0AQAAMAAJ|year=1903|author=California State Agricultural Society|page=421}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nSanta Rosa has a [[Mediterranean climate#Warm-summer Mediterranean climate|warm-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Csb'') with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. In the summer, fog and low overcast often move in from the Pacific Ocean during the evenings and mornings. They usually clear up to warm, sunny weather by late morning or noon before returning in the later evening but will occasionally linger all day. Average annual rainfall is {{convert|32.20|in|mm}}, falling on 74 days annually. The wettest year was 1983 with {{convert|63.07|in|mm}} and the driest year was 1976 with {{convert|11.38|in|mm}}. The most rainfall in one month was {{convert|19.42|in|mm}} in February 1998 and the most rainfall in 24 hours was {{convert|5.23|in|mm}} on December 19, 1981. Measurable snowfall is rare in the lowlands, but light amounts sometimes fall in the nearby mountains.\n\nThere are an average of 28.9 days with highs of {{convert|90|\u00b0F|0}} or more and an average of 30.2 days with lows reaching the freezing mark.

They were the strongest quakes to affect the city since 1906. The epicenters were about two miles (3&nbsp;km) north of Santa Rosa.\n\n===Nature and wildlife===\nDue to its population, much of Santa Rosa's remaining undisturbed area is on its urban fringe. However, the principal wildlife corridors of [[Santa Rosa Creek]] and its tributaries flow right through the heart of the town. [[Great blue herons]], [[great egret]]s, [[snowy egret]]s and [[black-crowned night heron|black-crowned herons]] nest in the trees of the median strip on West Ninth Street as well as along Santa Rosa Creek and downtown. [[Deer]] often are spotted roaming the neighborhoods nearer the eastern hills, as deep into town as Franklin Avenue and the McDonald area; rafters of [[wild turkeys]] are relatively common in some areas; and [[cougar|mountain lions]] are occasionally observed within city limits. [[Raccoon]]s and [[Virginia opossum|opossum]]s are a common sight throughout the city, while [[fox]]es, and [[rabbit]]s may be regularly seen in the more rural areas. In addition, the city borders and then wraps around the northern end of Trione Annadel State Park, which itself extends into the Sonoma Mountains and Sonoma Valley. [[Trione Annadel State Park]] also adjoins Spring Lake County Park and Howarth Park, forming one contiguous park system that enables visitors to venture into wild native habitats.\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n[[File:Rrsqrazorback.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Restaurants and other retail stores occupy several historic buildings in Santa Rosa's Railroad Square district in the downtown area, including these along Fourth Street.]]\nSanta Rosa can be seen as divided into four quadrants: Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest. [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]] runs roughly north\u2013south through the city, and divides it into east and west sides.

Although most of Santa Rosa's commercial buildings were destroyed in the 1906 earthquake, almost all of its numerous houses survived and most have survived to this day. As a result, Santa Rosa has a number of old neighborhoods in and around downtown, several historically designated. These contain numerous old homes, including many [[Victorians]]. Most of these are on quiet, often tree-lined streets.

It is a 65-member all-volunteer orchestra that has presented hundreds of free and low-cost concerts throughout Sonoma County over the past 15 years. The orchestra is made up of professional-level local musicians who volunteer their time.\n\nSummer Repertory Theater (SRT) is a complete and extensive practicum in all aspects of stage production. The program combines professional directing, design, and production staff with outstanding students in acting, design, technical theater, dance, music, and management. The ensemble mounts five productions, which are performed in full rotating Repertory six days a week beginning in mid-June. Company members put theory to the test and learn to work in a professional system.\n\nThe 92-year-old [[Santa Rosa Symphony]], an award-winning regional orchestra, performs at the Green Music Center in [[Rohnert Park]], a new venue with traditional \"shoebox\" acoustics. The Symphony's Institute for Music Education supports four youth ensembles and provides classical music education to students across Sonoma County, serving 30,000 elementary students per year.

Railroad|Petaluma & Santa Rosa Railroad Station]]]] Santa Rosa was founded in 1833 and named after [[Saint Rose of Lima]].  Before the arrival of Europeans, the Santa Rosa Plain was home to a strong and populous tribe of [[Pomo]] natives known as the Bitakomtara. The Bitakomtara controlled the area closely, barring passage to others until permission was arranged. Those who entered without permission were subject to harsh penalties. The tribe gathered at ceremonial times on Santa Rosa Creek near present-day [[Spring Lake Regional Park]]. Upon the arrival of Europeans, the Pomos were decimated by [[smallpox]] brought from Europe. By 1900 the Pomo population had decreased by 95%.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lfPfAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA90 |page=90 |title=Sacred Sonoma: Sacred Sites and Alignments in Sonoma County, California |edition=Revised |first=Beth |last=Winegarner |publisher=Lulu |year=2007 |isbn=9781430320678}}</ref>\n\nThe first known permanent European settlement of Santa Rosa was the homestead of the Carrillo family, in-laws to [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]], who settled the [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] [[pueblo]] and [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]] area. In the 1830s, during the Mexican period, the family of [[Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez de Carrillo]] built an adobe house on their [[Rancho Cabeza de Santa Rosa]] land grant, just east of what later became downtown Santa Rosa. Allegedly, however, by the 1820s, before the Carrillos built their adobe in the 1830s, [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and Mexican settlers from nearby Sonoma and other settlements to the south raised [[livestock]] in the area and slaughtered animals at the fork of the [[Santa Rosa Creek]] and [[Matanzas Creek]], near the intersection of modern-day Santa Rosa Avenue and Sonoma Avenue. This is supposedly the origin of the name of Matanzas Creek as, because of its use as a slaughtering place, the confluence came to be called La Matanza.\n\n[[File:Bird's eye view of Santa Rosa, Sonoma County, Cal., 1876. LOC 76693083.jpg|thumb|Panoramic map of Santa Rosa from 1871]]\nBy the 1850s, a [[History of Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo]] post and general store were established in what is now downtown Santa Rosa. In the mid-1850s, several prominent locals, including Julio Carrillo, son of Maria Carrillo, laid out the grid street pattern for Santa Rosa with a [[public square]] in the center, a pattern which largely remains as the street pattern for downtown Santa Rosa to this day, despite changes to the central square, now called Old Courthouse Square.\n\nIn 1867, the county recognized Santa Rosa as an [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] city and in 1868 the state officially confirmed the incorporation, making it officially the third incorporated city in Sonoma County, after Petaluma, incorporated in 1858, and [[Healdsburg]], incorporated in 1867.\n\nThe [[U.S. Census]] records, among others, show that after California became a state, Santa Rosa grew steadily early on, despite initially lagging behind nearby Petaluma in the 1850s and early 1860s. According to the U.S. Census, in 1870 Santa Rosa was the eighth largest city in California, and county seat of one of the most populous counties in the state. Growth and development after that was steady but never rapid. The city continued to grow when other early population centers declined or stagnated, but by 1900 it was being overtaken by many other newer population centers in the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California. According to a 1905 article in the ''[[Press Democrat]]'' newspaper reporting on the \"Battle of the Trains\", the city had just over 10,000 people at the time.\n\nThe [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] essentially destroyed the entire downtown, but the city's population did not greatly suffer. However, after that period the population growth of Santa Rosa, as with most of the area, was very slow.\n\nFamed director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] filmed his thriller ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' in Santa Rosa in 1943; the film gives glimpses of Santa Rosa in the 1940s. Many of the downtown buildings seen in the film no longer exist due to major reconstruction following the strong earthquakes in October 1969. However, some, like the rough-stone [[Northwestern Pacific Railroad]] depot and the prominent Empire Building (built in 1910 with a gold-topped clock tower), still survive.  A scene at the bank was filmed at the corner of Fourth Street and Mendocino Avenue (at present day Old Courthouse square); the [[S. H. Kress & Co.|KRESS]] building on Fourth Street is also visible. However, the courthouse and bank are now gone. The Coen brothers' 2001 film ''[[The Man Who Wasn't There (2001 film)|The Man Who Wasn't There]]'' is set in Santa Rosa c. 1949.\n\n===Since World War II===\n[[File:Santa Rosa, Empire Building (2012).jpg|thumb|upright|Old Courthouse Square is the heart of downtown Santa Rosa. This is the Empire Building, completed in 1910 and a Sonoma County landmark. It was seen in ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' by [[Alfred Hitchcock]].]]\nSanta Rosa grew following World War II because it was the location for [[Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Santa Rosa]], the remnants of which are now located in southwest Santa Rosa. The city was a convenient location for San Francisco travelers bound for the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]].\n\nThe population increased by 2/3 between 1950 and 1970, an average of 1,000 new residents a year over the 20 years. Some of the increase was from immigration, and some from annexation of portions of the surrounding area.\n\nIn 1958 the United States Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization designated Santa Rosa as one of its eight regional headquarters, with jurisdiction over Region 7, which included [[American Samoa]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Guam]], [[Hawaii]], [[Nevada]], and [[Utah]]. Santa Rosa continued as a major center for [[United States civil defense|civil defense]] activity (under the Office of Emergency Planning and the Office of Emergency Preparedness) until 1979 when the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) was created in its place, ending the civil defense's 69-year history.<ref name=\"OEP\">{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/396.html|title=Records of the office of Emergency Preparedness|accessdate=2008-08-30}}</ref>\n\nWhen the City Council adopted the city's first modern General Plan in 1991, the population was about 113,000. In the 21 years following 1970, Santa Rosa grew by about 3,000 residents a year\u2014triple the average growth during the previous twenty years.\n\n''Santa Rosa 2010'', the 1991 General Plan, called for a population of 175,000 in 2010. The Council expanded the city's urban boundary to include all the land then planned for future annexation, and declared it would be Santa Rosa's \"ultimate\" boundary.

The epicenters were about two miles (3&nbsp;km) north of Santa Rosa.\n\n===Nature and wildlife===\nDue to its population, much of Santa Rosa's remaining undisturbed area is on its urban fringe. However, the principal wildlife corridors of [[Santa Rosa Creek]] and its tributaries flow right through the heart of the town. [[Great blue herons]], [[great egret]]s, [[snowy egret]]s and [[black-crowned night heron|black-crowned herons]] nest in the trees of the median strip on West Ninth Street as well as along Santa Rosa Creek and downtown. [[Deer]] often are spotted roaming the neighborhoods nearer the eastern hills, as deep into town as Franklin Avenue and the McDonald area; rafters of [[wild turkeys]] are relatively common in some areas; and [[cougar|mountain lions]] are occasionally observed within city limits. [[Raccoon]]s and [[Virginia opossum|opossum]]s are a common sight throughout the city, while [[fox]]es, and [[rabbit]]s may be regularly seen in the more rural areas. In addition, the city borders and then wraps around the northern end of Trione Annadel State Park, which itself extends into the Sonoma Mountains and Sonoma Valley. [[Trione Annadel State Park]] also adjoins Spring Lake County Park and Howarth Park, forming one contiguous park system that enables visitors to venture into wild native habitats.\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n[[File:Rrsqrazorback.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Restaurants and other retail stores occupy several historic buildings in Santa Rosa's Railroad Square district in the downtown area, including these along Fourth Street.]]\nSanta Rosa can be seen as divided into four quadrants: Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest.

Although most of Santa Rosa's commercial buildings were destroyed in the 1906 earthquake, almost all of its numerous houses survived and most have survived to this day. As a result, Santa Rosa has a number of old neighborhoods in and around downtown, several historically designated. These contain numerous old homes, including many [[Victorians]].

It is a 65-member all-volunteer orchestra that has presented hundreds of free and low-cost concerts throughout Sonoma County over the past 15 years. The orchestra is made up of professional-level local musicians who volunteer their time.\n\nSummer Repertory Theater (SRT) is a complete and extensive practicum in all aspects of stage production. The program combines professional directing, design, and production staff with outstanding students in acting, design, technical theater, dance, music, and management. The ensemble mounts five productions, which are performed in full rotating Repertory six days a week beginning in mid-June. Company members put theory to the test and learn to work in a professional system.\n\nThe 92-year-old [[Santa Rosa Symphony]], an award-winning regional orchestra, performs at the Green Music Center in [[Rohnert Park]], a new venue with traditional \"shoebox\" acoustics. The Symphony's Institute for Music Education supports four youth ensembles and provides classical music education to students across Sonoma County, serving 30,000 elementary students per year.

When one of them, the cabin boy Richard Parker, fell into a coma, Dudley and Stephens decided to kill him for food.\n\n==Facts==\nThe English [[yacht]] ''Mignonette'' was a 19.43 [[tonnage|net tonnage]], {{convert|52|ft|m|adj=on}} cruiser built in 1867.<ref name=\"Simpson 1984 p.18\">{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=18}}.</ref> It was an [[inshore]] boat, not made for long voyages.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Ultimate Taboo|url = https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/04/16/reviews/000416.16rawsont.html|date = April 16, 2000|website = The New York Times|first1=Claude|last1=Rawson}}</ref> In 1883, she was purchased as a leisure vessel by Australian lawyer [[John Henry Want]].<ref name=\"Simpson 1984 p.18\"/> The yacht could only reasonably be transported to Australia by sailing, but she was a small vessel and the prospect of a 15,000-mile (24,000-km) voyage hampered Want's initial attempts to find a suitable crew. She finally set sail for [[Sydney]] from [[Southampton]] on 19 May 1884 with a crew of four: Tom Dudley (1853\u20131900),<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=296}}.</ref> the captain; Edwin Stephens (1847\u20131914);<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=290}}.</ref> Edmund Brooks (1846\u20131919);<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=289}}.</ref> and Richard Parker, the cabin boy. Parker was 17 years old, orphaned and an inexperienced seaman.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=37\u201340}}.</ref>\n\nOn 5 July, the yacht was running before a [[gale]], around {{convert|1600|mi|km}} northwest of the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Though the weather was by no means extreme and the vessel was not in any difficulties, Dudley gave the order to [[Heaving to|heave to]] so that the crew could enjoy a good night's sleep. As the manoeuvre was completed, and Parker was sent below to prepare tea, a wave struck the yacht and washed away the lee [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bulwark]].\n\nDudley instantly realized that the yacht was doomed and ordered the single {{convert|13|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] to be lowered. The lifeboat was of flimsy construction, with boards only {{convert|0.25|in|mm|0}} thick and was holed in the haste to get it away. ''Mignonette'' sank within five minutes of being struck and the crew abandoned ship for the lifeboat, managing only to salvage vital navigational instruments along with two tins of turnips and no fresh water.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=46\u201349}}.</ref> There have been various theories about the [[naval architecture|structural]] inadequacies of the yacht that led to such a catastrophic failure in routine weather.<ref name=\"S1\">{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=50\u201353}}.</ref>\n\nDudley managed to improvise a [[sea anchor]] to keep the lifeboat headed into the waves and maintain her stability. Over the first night, the crew had to fight off a shark with their oars. They were around {{convert|700|mi|km}} from the nearest land, being either [[Saint Helena]] or [[Tristan da Cunha]].<ref name=\"S1\"/> Dudley kept the first tin of turnips until 7 July when its five pieces were shared among the men to last two days. On or around 9 July, Brooks spotted a turtle which Stephens dragged on board. The crew were resolutely avoiding [[Seawater#Human consumption|drinking seawater]] as it was then universally held to be fatal and, though they devoured the turtle, they forwent drinking its blood when it became contaminated with seawater. The turtle yielded about three pounds (1.4&nbsp;kg) of meat each, though the crew ate even the bones, and, along with the second tin of turnips lasted until 15 or 17 July. The crew consistently failed to catch any rainwater and by 13 July, with no other source of fluid, they began to [[Urophagia|drink their own urine]]. It was probably on 20 July that Parker became ill through drinking seawater. Stephens was also unwell, possibly having experimented with seawater.<ref name=\"Simpson 1984 pp57-60\">{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=57\u201360}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mignonette lifeboat.jpg|thumb|Photograph of the lifeboat exhibited at [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in 1884.]]\n[[Sortition|Drawing lots]] to choose a sacrificial victim who would die to feed the others was possibly first discussed on 16 or 17 July, and debate seems to have intensified on 21 July but without resolution. On 23 or 24 July, with Parker probably in a coma, Dudley told the others that it was better that one of them die so that the others survive and that they should draw lots. Brooks refused. That night, Dudley again raised the matter with Stephens pointing out that Parker was probably dying and that he and Stephens had wives and families. They agreed to leave the matter until the morning.\n\nThe following day, with no prospect of rescue in sight, Dudley and Stephens silently signalled to each other that Parker would be killed. Killing Parker before his natural death would better preserve his blood to drink. Brooks, who had not been party to the earlier discussion, claimed to have signalled neither assent nor protest. Dudley always insisted that Brooks had assented. Dudley said a prayer and, with Stephens standing by to hold the youth's legs if he struggled, pushed his [[penknife]] into Parker's [[jugular vein]], killing him.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=57\u201360}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:RichardParkerTombstone.jpg|thumb|Memorial stone to Richard Parker in [[Peartree Green]], [[Southampton]].]]\nIn some of the varying and confused later accounts of the killing, Parker murmured, \"What me?\" as he was slain.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=67}}.</ref> The three fed on Parker's body, with Dudley and Brooks consuming the most and Stephens very little. The crew even finally managed to catch some rainwater. Dudley later described the scene, \"I can assure you I shall never forget the sight of my two unfortunate companions over that ghastly meal. We all was like mad wolfs who should get the most, and for men\u2014fathers of children\u2014to commit such a deed, we could not have our right reason.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=68}}.</ref> The crew sighted a sail on 29 July.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=69}}.</ref>\n\n==Rescue and arraignment==\nDudley, Stephens and Brooks were picked up by the German sailing [[barque]] ''Montezuma'' which returned the men to [[Falmouth, Cornwall]] on Saturday 6 September ''en route'' to its destination in [[Hamburg]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=69\u201370}}.</ref> On arrival in Falmouth, the survivors attended the customs house and Dudley and Stephens entered statutory statements under the [[Merchant Shipping Act]]s, required in the event of a shipping loss. All three were candid, Dudley and Stephens believing themselves to be protected by a [[custom of the sea]].\n\nPolice Sergeant James Laverty of the [[Falmouth Docks Police|Falmouth Harbour Police]] was in the vicinity of the [[deposition (law)|depositions]] and overhearing the statement given to the Customs officer later questioned Dudley about the means by which he had killed Parker, taking custody of the knife and promising to return it. The depositions were [[telegraph]]ed to the [[Board of Trade]] and to the [[Registrar General of Shipping]] in [[Basinghall Street]] in London. While the survivors were making arrangements to rejoin their families, Basinghall Street advised that the men should be detained in Falmouth.\n\nThe Board of Trade gave conflicting advice to take no action but informed the [[Home Office]]. The Home Office was closed for the weekend. Meanwhile, Laverty was seeking [[arrest warrant|warrants]] for the men's arrest for murder on the high seas, warrants he obtained later that day from mayor of Falmouth, Henry Liddicoat.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=3\u201311}}.</ref>\n\nThe three men were held in the borough police station until they could appear before the [[magistrate]]s on the morning of Monday, 8 September. Dudley appears to have been confident that the magistrates would dismiss the charges and Liddicoat visited the men to apologise for their inconvenience but all magistrates had recently been instructed to seek advice of the [[Treasury Solicitor]] in all murder cases and the clerk probably prompted Laverty to ask for a [[remand (detention)|remand in custody]] and [[adjournment]] while advice was sought. Local solicitor Harry Tilly appeared for the men and requested bail but after the magistrates, including Liddicoat, had consulted, they were returned to the police cells until 11 September.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=73\u201376}}.</ref>\n\nThe civil service had now returned from the weekend break and by Wednesday the file was passed to [[Home Secretary]] Sir [[William Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]].

Harcourt took the decision to prosecute, the lost opportunity to clarify the law through James Archer (see [[#James Archer|below]]) no doubt alive in his mind.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=77}}.</ref>\n\nBy the time of their appearance in front of the magistrates on 11 September, public opinion in Falmouth had swung firmly behind the [[defendant]]s, especially after Parker's brother Daniel, also a seaman, appeared in court and shook hands with the three. The case was again adjourned until 18 September, though this time Tilly succeeded in obtaining bail, the Home Office having hinted to the court that this would be appropriate.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=78\u201380}}.</ref> The three men returned to their homes while the case began to appear across the British and world press. It soon became clear that public opinion was with the three survivors.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=81\u201383}}.</ref> Harcourt was revolted by the public's sentiment and became even more intent on a conviction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=89}}.</ref>\n\n[[William Otto Adolph Julius Danckwerts]], a barrister of only six years' [[call to the bar|call]] but with considerable experience in wreck inquiries, was briefed for the prosecution but soon realised that public sentiment and the lack of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] posed formidable difficulties. The only [[witness]]es were the three defendants themselves and their [[right to silence]] would impede any formal proceedings. A [[confession (law)|confession]] was only admissible against the person making it, not his co-defendants and the contents of the depositions was probably inadequate to convict.\n\nWhen the case was heard by the magistrates on 18 September, Danckwerts told the court that he intended to offer no evidence against Brooks and requested that he be discharged so that he could be called as a witness for the prosecution. There is no evidence that Brooks had been canvassed about this and the magistrates agreed. Danckwerts opened the prosecution case and called as witnesses those who had heard the survivors' stories and Brooks. The magistrates committed Dudley and Stephens for trial at the winter Cornwall and [[Devon]] [[assizes (England and Wales)|assizes]] in [[Exeter]] but extended their bail.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=89\u201392}}.</ref>\n\n==Legal background and theory==\nThe [[morality]], [[ethics]], and [[law|legality]] of the taking of another's life to increase one's own chances of survival have been discussed in [[thought experiment]]s from the [[Plank of Carneades]] to [[The Case of the Speluncean Explorers]], but there have been few legal cases where the question has been tested.\n\n===Saint Christopher case===\nIn the early 17th century, seven Englishmen in the [[Caribbean]] embarked on an overnight voyage from [[Saint Kitts|Saint Christopher Island]], but were blown out to sea and lost for 17 days. During this time, starving, they cast lots to see who would sacrifice his own life for the others. The lot fell to the man who had suggested the scheme, and he consented to his subsequent killing. His body sustained the rest until they made their way to [[Saint Martin]]. They were returned to Saint Christopher where they were put on trial for [[homicide]]. The judge [[pardon]]ed them, their crime being \"washed away\" by \"inevitable necessity\". Though this case was cited in defence of Dudley and Stephens, it was reported only anecdotally some years later in a medical work and not in the [[law report]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=122\u2013123}}.</ref>\n\n===''U.S. v. Holmes''===\nIn 1841, the U.S. ship ''[[William Brown (ship)|William Brown]]'' sank after hitting an iceberg. Crewmen, including Alexander William Holmes, believed that their overloaded lifeboat was in danger of itself sinking and put 14 or 16 passengers overboard to their inevitable deaths in the frigid water. On his return to [[Philadelphia]], Holmes was arrested and charged with murder. The [[grand jury]] rejected the indictment and substituted [[manslaughter]].<ref>''[[United States v. Holmes (1842)|United States v. Holmes]]'' (1842) 1 Wallace Junior 1, 26 Fed. Cas. 360</ref> The judge in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]] instructed the jury that necessity might be a complete defence but that \"before the protection of the law of necessity can be invoked, a case of necessity must exist, the slayer must be faultless, he must owe no duty to the victim.\" The jury convicted Holmes and the principle of necessity was not tested by any higher court. He was sentenced to six months in jail and a $20 fine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/2482/Alexander-Holmes-Trial-1842.html |title=Alexander Holmes Trial: 1842 - Holmes Tried For Manslaughter |publisher=Law Library - American Law and Legal Information |accessdate=March 8, 2009}}</ref> This case was also cited in defence of Dudley and Stephens.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=162\u2013175}}.</ref>\n\n===James Archer===\n[[File:The Euxine.jpg|thumb|The ''Euxine'']]\nOn 9 August 1874, the collier ''Euxine'' was lost, and its second mate James Archer took charge of one of the lifeboats with seven other survivors. Archer and four survivors were picked up on 31 August, and Archer was candid that he and August Muller had killed and butchered Francis Shufus, selected by drawing lots. They were ultimately landed at [[Batavia Road]] where the acting British consul, William J. Fraser took their surprisingly honest depositions.\n\nThe men were then shipped to Singapore along with Fraser's depositions and put into the hands of shipping master Henry Ellis, a character fictionalised in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novella ''[[The Shadow Line]]''. Ellis consulted [[Attorney General of Singapore]] [[Thomas Braddell]] but then wrote to the Board of Trade in London that no further action was necessary and the men were free to find another ship to serve. Singapore Governor Sir [[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer, born 1824)|Andrew Clarke]] had ordered the men arrested and when he informed the [[Colonial Office]], they insisted that he hold a judicial enquiry. Prosecution was started in Singapore but ultimately dropped after extended procedural wrangles as to whether Singapore or England was the most appropriate jurisdiction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=176\u2013194}}.</ref>\n\n===Law commission===\nThe Criminal Law [[Law commission|commissioners]], who were attempting to define an [[English Criminal Code]], considered the matter several times:<ref name=\"S235\">{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=235}}.</ref>\n* 1839, Fourth report, Digest of Law (Art.39) included necessity as a defence to homicide;\n* 1843, Seventh report (Art.29) also included the defence;\n* 1846, Second report favoured leaving questions of necessity to the [[royal prerogative]] of [[clemency]] (Art.19);\n* 1878\u20131879, declined to codify the defence as it was \"better to leave such questions to be dealt with when, if ever, they arise in practice by applying the principles of law to the circumstance of the particular case.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=201}}.</ref>\nIn 1874, [[James Fitzjames Stephen]] introduced a Homicide Law Amendment [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] that included a defence of necessity. The Bill was lost and Stephen had changed his mind by 1884.<ref name=\"S235\"/>\n\n==Trial==\nThe trial of Dudley and Stephens opened in Exeter on 3 November before [[John Walter Huddleston|Baron Huddleston]]. Arthur Charles [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] led for the prosecution and Arthur J. H. Collins QC for the defence, paid for out of a defence fund that had been established by public subscription. Huddleston was well aware of the passion of the local jury, probably aware of the case of the ''Euxine'' and the failed prosecution of James Archer. Charles was determined that the case would not collapse and that the issue of necessity be settled. Sir [[William Robert Grove]] had initially been listed to take the [[assizes]] that session and there has been speculation that Huddleston was substituted to ensure a \"safe pair of hands\". Huddleston had a reputation as a judge able to direct a jury.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=195\u2013198}}</ref>\n\nThe jury was [[Juries in England and Wales#Empanelling and challenging jurors|empanelled]] and sworn, being composed of almost the same jurors as had sat with Huddleston the previous day in a murder case that had resulted in the [[death penalty]]. Dudley and Stephens pleaded not guilty; Charles opened for the prosecution, outlining the legal arguments and dismissing the defence of necessity. He also dismissed the [[insanity defence]]; it was clear from the depositions and Dudley's prayer that they were aware of the quality of their actions. Charles did not suppress the dreadful conditions on the boat and suggested an ultimate appeal to clemency.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=205\u2013206}}.</ref>\n\nA discussion now took place between Huddleston and Collins which showed that Huddleston had made up his mind on the law and was not interested in hearing any submissions from the defence. In fact, Huddleston had already planned how he would ensure a guilty verdict and settle the law on necessity once and for all. He would invite, in robust terms, the jury to return a [[special verdict]], stating only the facts of the case as they found them but giving no opinion on guilt or otherwise. It would then be for the judge to decide whether the facts found amounted to guilt. Though special verdicts had once been common, none had been returned since 1785 and the jury in any case retained the right to return a general verdict.\n\nHuddleston was further determined that the legal question would be settled by a bench of several judges to lend it authority. Hence, he planned to adjourn the trial after the special verdict and reconvene with fellow judges to pronounce guilt. Collins would have his opportunity to argue the law in front of the expanded bench.<ref name=\"Simpson 1984 pp206-210\">{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=206\u2013210}}.</ref>\n\nThe prosecution produced the various accounts and depositions written by the defendants and the evidence that the ''Mignonette'' was registered in Britain, necessary to establish the court's [[jurisdiction]] under s.267 of the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1854]]. Charles then called evidence from the various people who had spoken to the defendants on their arrival in Falmouth before calling Brooks. Brooks provided a compelling account of Dudley and Stephens' actions and his own non-involvement. In [[cross-examination]], Collins did not challenge his account, but made him confirm the appalling conditions on the boat, Brooks' own cannibalism, their inevitable death without recourse to Parker's body and the belief that Parker would have died first.<ref name=\"Simpson 1984 pp206-210\"/>\n\nThough Collins addressed the jury on necessity in his closing speech, Huddleston presented them with a stark alternative: accept his direction to find the men guilty of murder or return a special verdict. Without waiting for the jury's decision, Huddleston produced a special verdict that he had written the night before and invited the jury to indicate their assent to each paragraph as he read it out. Silence was sufficient. Though the jury finally tried to add some facts to the verdict, Huddleston insisted, perhaps not entirely truthfully, that their observations were already incorporated. The final words of the verdict were, \"But whether upon the whole matter, the prisoners were and are guilty of murder the jury are ignorant and refer to the Court.\" Huddleston then renewed the defendants' bail and adjourned the assizes to his rooms in the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in London for 25 November.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=212\u2013217}}.</ref>\n\n==Huddleston's blunders==\n[[File:SirJohnWalterHuddleston.jpg|thumb|[[John Walter Huddleston|Baron Huddleston]]]]\n\nAt some point after the trial, but before the special verdict was copied for the London review, Huddleston realised that he had made a potentially serious error. In his original draft, he had described the ''Mignonette'' as an \"English Merchant vessel\" but had altered this to read \"yacht\". Further, he had described the lifeboat as \"an open boat\" and not asserted its provenance on the ''Mignonette''. He now realised that he had omitted the critical finding necessary to give the court jurisdiction over Dudley and Stephens. Huddleston's solution was simply to alter his record of the verdict.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=218}}.</ref>\n\nOn 25 November, the Cornwall and Devon winter assizes reconvened at No. 2 Court, the Royal Courts of Justice in London. Attorney General Sir Henry James appeared for the prosecution and immediately pointed out a problem. The [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|Divisional Court]] of the [[Queen's Bench]] had an established authority to decide a matter of law with a panel of judges after referral from an inferior court. [[Statute]] only permitted this following a conviction, and there had been no conviction in Exeter. James suggested that an alternative was to hear the case at the Cornwall and Devon assizes, albeit at an unusual venue, but to add further judges to the bench as all [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] judges had authority to hear assize cases. Huddleston expressed his scepticism that judges could be added to a trial once it had begun. Moreover, he had been looking for affirmation from a superior court. By this time Collins had become suspicious of Huddleston's tampering with the record of the trial and requested the [[shorthand]] notes of the hearing. With the proceedings now in shambles, the case was listed for 4 December, and the defendants were ordered to attend in London, though on what authority is unclear.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=218\u2013221}}.</ref>\n\nAt a further hearing on 2 December, James withdrew his suggestion of an augmented assize court and gave the opinion that the court should sit as the Queen's Bench Divisional Court; this should only have allowed two or three judges, not the five who eventually sat. Collins seems not to have taken the opportunity to challenge the jurisdiction or constitution of the court, possibly because of some agreement with the prosecution and promise of clemency.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=221\u2013223}}.</ref>\n\n==Judgment==\n[[File:johncoleridge.jpg|thumb|[[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Lord Coleridge]]]]\n\nThe Queen's Bench Division sat on 4 December under [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] [[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Lord Coleridge]]. James appeared for the prosecution, leading Charles and Danckwerts. At the beginning of the hearing, the report of the Exeter trial was read out, at some length, in its entirety. This allowed Collins to submit that the special verdict had been altered. As much was ultimately admitted and it was eventually agreed that it was best that the special verdict be restored to the version agreed by the jury. Collins's attempt to challenge the jurisdiction of the court was rejected by the judges. Collins then submitted that the court was not competent to return a verdict as the Exeter jury had not given a conditional verdict asserting that the jury would find in accordance with the judge's ruling. Though this troubled the judges, especially Grove, the point was eventually dismissed as one of form only.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=225\u2013228}}.</ref>\n\nJames submitted that there was no common law authority to support the proposition that necessity was a defence to murder. The Saint Christopher case was rejected as a precedent because it had not been formally recorded in the law reports. Before Collins started his submissions, Lord Coleridge instructed him to confine his remarks to murder, thereby dismissing the plausible alternative that necessity was a [[partial defence]] leading to a conviction for manslaughter by analogy with the partial defence of [[Provocation (legal)|provocation]]. Collins responded by citing ''United States v. Holmes'' (1842) and discussing the various theoretical and ethical arguments in favour of the necessity defence. At the conclusion of Collins' submissions, the judges withdrew. They returned after a few moments and Lord Coleridge declared, \"We are all of the opinion that the conviction should be affirmed but we will put our reasons in writing and give them on Saturday next.\" After some technical legal discussion, Lord Coleridge committed Dudley and Stephens to [[Holloway Prison]], which then held both men and women, until Tuesday, 9 December, when the court would deliver its reasons and its [[sentence (law)|sentence]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=229\u2013237}}.</ref>\n\nThe panel of judges found that there was no common law defence of necessity to a charge of murder, either on the basis of legal precedent or the basis of ethics and morality.<ref name=\"report\">''R v.

By 11 December, there was still no announcement and it seemed that, their having been convicted, public opinion was moving against the men. Any exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy would be exercised by [[Queen Victoria]] on the advice of the Home Secretary Harcourt.\n\nThough Harcourt was personally in favour of abolition of the death penalty, he was conscientious in his official duties. He took the judgment of the court seriously, that the men were guilty of murder and feared that [[commutation (law)|commuting]] the sentence to anything other than [[life imprisonment]] would mock the law. The Attorney General felt that a life sentence would not resist the attack of public opinion. He noted that the court had withheld a finding of manslaughter from the jury but that had it been available it would have been the jury's verdict and \"no judge would have inflicted more than three months' [[imprisonment]]\". Solicitor General Sir Farrer Herschell concurred. Based on James's and Herschell's advice, on 12 December, Harcourt decided on six months' imprisonment. Dudley and Stephens were advised the next day but were somewhat disappointed at so long in custody. Dudley never accepted the justice of his conviction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=239\u2013247}}.</ref> The two men were released around 7:00&nbsp;a.m. on 20 May 1885.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Mignonette Case|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000159/18850520/025/0004|accessdate=21 August 2014|work=North-Eastern Daily Gazette|date=20 May 1885|page=4|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n==Cultural impact==\nThe case is familiar among lawyers in common law jurisdictions\u2014that is, England and many, though not all, former British territories\u2014and is universally studied by law students in such jurisdictions.

Parker was 17 years old, orphaned and an inexperienced seaman.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=37\u201340}}.</ref>\n\nOn 5 July, the yacht was running before a [[gale]], around {{convert|1600|mi|km}} northwest of the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. Though the weather was by no means extreme and the vessel was not in any difficulties, Dudley gave the order to [[Heaving to|heave to]] so that the crew could enjoy a good night's sleep. As the manoeuvre was completed, and Parker was sent below to prepare tea, a wave struck the yacht and washed away the lee [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bulwark]].\n\nDudley instantly realized that the yacht was doomed and ordered the single {{convert|13|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] to be lowered. The lifeboat was of flimsy construction, with boards only {{convert|0.25|in|mm|0}} thick and was holed in the haste to get it away. ''Mignonette'' sank within five minutes of being struck and the crew abandoned ship for the lifeboat, managing only to salvage vital navigational instruments along with two tins of turnips and no fresh water.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=46\u201349}}.</ref> There have been various theories about the [[naval architecture|structural]] inadequacies of the yacht that led to such a catastrophic failure in routine weather.<ref name=\"S1\">{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=50\u201353}}.</ref>\n\nDudley managed to improvise a [[sea anchor]] to keep the lifeboat headed into the waves and maintain her stability. Over the first night, the crew had to fight off a shark with their oars. They were around {{convert|700|mi|km}} from the nearest land, being either [[Saint Helena]] or [[Tristan da Cunha]].<ref name=\"S1\"/> Dudley kept the first tin of turnips until 7 July when its five pieces were shared among the men to last two days. On or around 9 July, Brooks spotted a turtle which Stephens dragged on board. The crew were resolutely avoiding [[Seawater#Human consumption|drinking seawater]] as it was then universally held to be fatal and, though they devoured the turtle, they forwent drinking its blood when it became contaminated with seawater. The turtle yielded about three pounds (1.4&nbsp;kg) of meat each, though the crew ate even the bones, and, along with the second tin of turnips lasted until 15 or 17 July. The crew consistently failed to catch any rainwater and by 13 July, with no other source of fluid, they began to [[Urophagia|drink their own urine]]. It was probably on 20 July that Parker became ill through drinking seawater. Stephens was also unwell, possibly having experimented with seawater.<ref name=\"Simpson 1984 pp57-60\">{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=57\u201360}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mignonette lifeboat.jpg|thumb|Photograph of the lifeboat exhibited at [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in 1884.]]\n[[Sortition|Drawing lots]] to choose a sacrificial victim who would die to feed the others was possibly first discussed on 16 or 17 July, and debate seems to have intensified on 21 July but without resolution. On 23 or 24 July, with Parker probably in a coma, Dudley told the others that it was better that one of them die so that the others survive and that they should draw lots. Brooks refused. That night, Dudley again raised the matter with Stephens pointing out that Parker was probably dying and that he and Stephens had wives and families. They agreed to leave the matter until the morning.\n\nThe following day, with no prospect of rescue in sight, Dudley and Stephens silently signalled to each other that Parker would be killed. Killing Parker before his natural death would better preserve his blood to drink. Brooks, who had not been party to the earlier discussion, claimed to have signalled neither assent nor protest. Dudley always insisted that Brooks had assented. Dudley said a prayer and, with Stephens standing by to hold the youth's legs if he struggled, pushed his [[penknife]] into Parker's [[jugular vein]], killing him.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=57\u201360}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:RichardParkerTombstone.jpg|thumb|Memorial stone to Richard Parker in [[Peartree Green]], [[Southampton]].]]\nIn some of the varying and confused later accounts of the killing, Parker murmured, \"What me?\" as he was slain.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=67}}.</ref> The three fed on Parker's body, with Dudley and Brooks consuming the most and Stephens very little. The crew even finally managed to catch some rainwater. Dudley later described the scene, \"I can assure you I shall never forget the sight of my two unfortunate companions over that ghastly meal.

All three were candid, Dudley and Stephens believing themselves to be protected by a [[custom of the sea]].\n\nPolice Sergeant James Laverty of the [[Falmouth Docks Police|Falmouth Harbour Police]] was in the vicinity of the [[deposition (law)|depositions]] and overhearing the statement given to the Customs officer later questioned Dudley about the means by which he had killed Parker, taking custody of the knife and promising to return it. The depositions were [[telegraph]]ed to the [[Board of Trade]] and to the [[Registrar General of Shipping]] in [[Basinghall Street]] in London. While the survivors were making arrangements to rejoin their families, Basinghall Street advised that the men should be detained in Falmouth.\n\nThe Board of Trade gave conflicting advice to take no action but informed the [[Home Office]]. The Home Office was closed for the weekend. Meanwhile, Laverty was seeking [[arrest warrant|warrants]] for the men's arrest for murder on the high seas, warrants he obtained later that day from mayor of Falmouth, Henry Liddicoat.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=3\u201311}}.</ref>\n\nThe three men were held in the borough police station until they could appear before the [[magistrate]]s on the morning of Monday, 8 September. Dudley appears to have been confident that the magistrates would dismiss the charges and Liddicoat visited the men to apologise for their inconvenience but all magistrates had recently been instructed to seek advice of the [[Treasury Solicitor]] in all murder cases and the clerk probably prompted Laverty to ask for a [[remand (detention)|remand in custody]] and [[adjournment]] while advice was sought. Local solicitor Harry Tilly appeared for the men and requested bail but after the magistrates, including Liddicoat, had consulted, they were returned to the police cells until 11 September.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=73\u201376}}.</ref>\n\nThe civil service had now returned from the weekend break and by Wednesday the file was passed to [[Home Secretary]] Sir [[William Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]]. That day Harcourt consulted with [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] Sir [[Henry James, 1st Baron James of Hereford|Henry James]] and [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] Sir [[Farrer Herschell, 1st Baron Herschell|Farrer Herschell]]. Harcourt took the decision to prosecute, the lost opportunity to clarify the law through James Archer (see [[#James Archer|below]]) no doubt alive in his mind.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=77}}.</ref>\n\nBy the time of their appearance in front of the magistrates on 11 September, public opinion in Falmouth had swung firmly behind the [[defendant]]s, especially after Parker's brother Daniel, also a seaman, appeared in court and shook hands with the three. The case was again adjourned until 18 September, though this time Tilly succeeded in obtaining bail, the Home Office having hinted to the court that this would be appropriate.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=78\u201380}}.</ref> The three men returned to their homes while the case began to appear across the British and world press. It soon became clear that public opinion was with the three survivors.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=81\u201383}}.</ref> Harcourt was revolted by the public's sentiment and became even more intent on a conviction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=89}}.</ref>\n\n[[William Otto Adolph Julius Danckwerts]], a barrister of only six years' [[call to the bar|call]] but with considerable experience in wreck inquiries, was briefed for the prosecution but soon realised that public sentiment and the lack of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] posed formidable difficulties. The only [[witness]]es were the three defendants themselves and their [[right to silence]] would impede any formal proceedings. A [[confession (law)|confession]] was only admissible against the person making it, not his co-defendants and the contents of the depositions was probably inadequate to convict.\n\nWhen the case was heard by the magistrates on 18 September, Danckwerts told the court that he intended to offer no evidence against Brooks and requested that he be discharged so that he could be called as a witness for the prosecution. There is no evidence that Brooks had been canvassed about this and the magistrates agreed. Danckwerts opened the prosecution case and called as witnesses those who had heard the survivors' stories and Brooks. The magistrates committed Dudley and Stephens for trial at the winter Cornwall and [[Devon]] [[assizes (England and Wales)|assizes]] in [[Exeter]] but extended their bail.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=89\u201392}}.</ref>\n\n==Legal background and theory==\nThe [[morality]], [[ethics]], and [[law|legality]] of the taking of another's life to increase one's own chances of survival have been discussed in [[thought experiment]]s from the [[Plank of Carneades]] to [[The Case of the Speluncean Explorers]], but there have been few legal cases where the question has been tested.\n\n===Saint Christopher case===\nIn the early 17th century, seven Englishmen in the [[Caribbean]] embarked on an overnight voyage from [[Saint Kitts|Saint Christopher Island]], but were blown out to sea and lost for 17 days. During this time, starving, they cast lots to see who would sacrifice his own life for the others. The lot fell to the man who had suggested the scheme, and he consented to his subsequent killing. His body sustained the rest until they made their way to [[Saint Martin]]. They were returned to Saint Christopher where they were put on trial for [[homicide]]. The judge [[pardon]]ed them, their crime being \"washed away\" by \"inevitable necessity\". Though this case was cited in defence of Dudley and Stephens, it was reported only anecdotally some years later in a medical work and not in the [[law report]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=122\u2013123}}.</ref>\n\n===''U.S. v. Holmes''===\nIn 1841, the U.S. ship ''[[William Brown (ship)|William Brown]]'' sank after hitting an iceberg. Crewmen, including Alexander William Holmes, believed that their overloaded lifeboat was in danger of itself sinking and put 14 or 16 passengers overboard to their inevitable deaths in the frigid water. On his return to [[Philadelphia]], Holmes was arrested and charged with murder. The [[grand jury]] rejected the indictment and substituted [[manslaughter]].<ref>''[[United States v. Holmes (1842)|United States v. Holmes]]'' (1842) 1 Wallace Junior 1, 26 Fed.

Archer and four survivors were picked up on 31 August, and Archer was candid that he and August Muller had killed and butchered Francis Shufus, selected by drawing lots. They were ultimately landed at [[Batavia Road]] where the acting British consul, William J. Fraser took their surprisingly honest depositions.\n\nThe men were then shipped to Singapore along with Fraser's depositions and put into the hands of shipping master Henry Ellis, a character fictionalised in [[Joseph Conrad]]'s novella ''[[The Shadow Line]]''. Ellis consulted [[Attorney General of Singapore]] [[Thomas Braddell]] but then wrote to the Board of Trade in London that no further action was necessary and the men were free to find another ship to serve. Singapore Governor Sir [[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer)|Andrew Clarke]] had ordered the men arrested and when he informed the [[Colonial Office]], they insisted that he hold a judicial enquiry. Prosecution was started in Singapore but ultimately dropped after extended procedural wrangles as to whether Singapore or England was the most appropriate jurisdiction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=176\u2013194}}.</ref>\n\n===Law commission===\nThe Criminal Law [[Law commission|commissioners]], who were attempting to define an [[English Criminal Code]], considered the matter several times:<ref name=\"S235\">{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=235}}.</ref>\n* 1839, Fourth report, Digest of Law (Art.39) included necessity as a defence to homicide;\n* 1843, Seventh report (Art.29) also included the defence;\n* 1846, Second report favoured leaving questions of necessity to the [[royal prerogative]] of [[clemency]] (Art.19);\n* 1878\u20131879, declined to codify the defence as it was \"better to leave such questions to be dealt with when, if ever, they arise in practice by applying the principles of law to the circumstance of the particular case.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=201}}.</ref>\nIn 1874, [[James Fitzjames Stephen]] introduced a Homicide Law Amendment [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] that included a defence of necessity. The Bill was lost and Stephen had changed his mind by 1884.<ref name=\"S235\"/>\n\n==Trial==\nThe trial of Dudley and Stephens opened in Exeter on 3 November before [[John Walter Huddleston|Baron Huddleston]]. Arthur Charles [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] led for the prosecution and Arthur J. H. Collins QC for the defence, paid for out of a defence fund that had been established by public subscription. Huddleston was well aware of the passion of the local jury, probably aware of the case of the ''Euxine'' and the failed prosecution of James Archer. Charles was determined that the case would not collapse and that the issue of necessity be settled. Sir [[William Robert Grove]] had initially been listed to take the [[assizes]] that session and there has been speculation that Huddleston was substituted to ensure a \"safe pair of hands\". Huddleston had a reputation as a judge able to direct a jury.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=195\u2013198}}</ref>\n\nThe jury was [[Juries in England and Wales#Empanelling and challenging jurors|empanelled]] and sworn, being composed of almost the same jurors as had sat with Huddleston the previous day in a murder case that had resulted in the [[death penalty]]. Dudley and Stephens pleaded not guilty; Charles opened for the prosecution, outlining the legal arguments and dismissing the defence of necessity. He also dismissed the [[insanity defence]]; it was clear from the depositions and Dudley's prayer that they were aware of the quality of their actions. Charles did not suppress the dreadful conditions on the boat and suggested an ultimate appeal to clemency.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=205\u2013206}}.</ref>\n\nA discussion now took place between Huddleston and Collins which showed that Huddleston had made up his mind on the law and was not interested in hearing any submissions from the defence. In fact, Huddleston had already planned how he would ensure a guilty verdict and settle the law on necessity once and for all. He would invite, in robust terms, the jury to return a [[special verdict]], stating only the facts of the case as they found them but giving no opinion on guilt or otherwise. It would then be for the judge to decide whether the facts found amounted to guilt. Though special verdicts had once been common, none had been returned since 1785 and the jury in any case retained the right to return a general verdict.\n\nHuddleston was further determined that the legal question would be settled by a bench of several judges to lend it authority. Hence, he planned to adjourn the trial after the special verdict and reconvene with fellow judges to pronounce guilt. Collins would have his opportunity to argue the law in front of the expanded bench.<ref name=\"Simpson 1984 pp206-210\">{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=206\u2013210}}.</ref>\n\nThe prosecution produced the various accounts and depositions written by the defendants and the evidence that the ''Mignonette'' was registered in Britain, necessary to establish the court's [[jurisdiction]] under s.267 of the [[Merchant Shipping Act 1854]]. Charles then called evidence from the various people who had spoken to the defendants on their arrival in Falmouth before calling Brooks. Brooks provided a compelling account of Dudley and Stephens' actions and his own non-involvement. In [[cross-examination]], Collins did not challenge his account, but made him confirm the appalling conditions on the boat, Brooks' own cannibalism, their inevitable death without recourse to Parker's body and the belief that Parker would have died first.<ref name=\"Simpson 1984 pp206-210\"/>\n\nThough Collins addressed the jury on necessity in his closing speech, Huddleston presented them with a stark alternative: accept his direction to find the men guilty of murder or return a special verdict. Without waiting for the jury's decision, Huddleston produced a special verdict that he had written the night before and invited the jury to indicate their assent to each paragraph as he read it out. Silence was sufficient. Though the jury finally tried to add some facts to the verdict, Huddleston insisted, perhaps not entirely truthfully, that their observations were already incorporated. The final words of the verdict were, \"But whether upon the whole matter, the prisoners were and are guilty of murder the jury are ignorant and refer to the Court.\" Huddleston then renewed the defendants' bail and adjourned the assizes to his rooms in the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in London for 25 November.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=212\u2013217}}.</ref>\n\n==Huddleston's blunders==\n[[File:SirJohnWalterHuddleston.jpg|thumb|[[John Walter Huddleston|Baron Huddleston]]]]\n\nAt some point after the trial, but before the special verdict was copied for the London review, Huddleston realised that he had made a potentially serious error. In his original draft, he had described the ''Mignonette'' as an \"English Merchant vessel\" but had altered this to read \"yacht\". Further, he had described the lifeboat as \"an open boat\" and not asserted its provenance on the ''Mignonette''. He now realised that he had omitted the critical finding necessary to give the court jurisdiction over Dudley and Stephens. Huddleston's solution was simply to alter his record of the verdict.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|p=218}}.</ref>\n\nOn 25 November, the Cornwall and Devon winter assizes reconvened at No. 2 Court, the Royal Courts of Justice in London. Attorney General Sir Henry James appeared for the prosecution and immediately pointed out a problem. The [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|Divisional Court]] of the [[Queen's Bench]] had an established authority to decide a matter of law with a panel of judges after referral from an inferior court. [[Statute]] only permitted this following a conviction, and there had been no conviction in Exeter. James suggested that an alternative was to hear the case at the Cornwall and Devon assizes, albeit at an unusual venue, but to add further judges to the bench as all [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] judges had authority to hear assize cases. Huddleston expressed his scepticism that judges could be added to a trial once it had begun. Moreover, he had been looking for affirmation from a superior court. By this time Collins had become suspicious of Huddleston's tampering with the record of the trial and requested the [[shorthand]] notes of the hearing. With the proceedings now in shambles, the case was listed for 4 December, and the defendants were ordered to attend in London, though on what authority is unclear.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=218\u2013221}}.</ref>\n\nAt a further hearing on 2 December, James withdrew his suggestion of an augmented assize court and gave the opinion that the court should sit as the Queen's Bench Divisional Court; this should only have allowed two or three judges, not the five who eventually sat. Collins seems not to have taken the opportunity to challenge the jurisdiction or constitution of the court, possibly because of some agreement with the prosecution and promise of clemency.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=221\u2013223}}.</ref>\n\n==Judgment==\n[[File:johncoleridge.jpg|thumb|[[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Lord Coleridge]]]]\n\nThe Queen's Bench Division sat on 4 December under [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] [[John Coleridge, 1st Baron Coleridge|Lord Coleridge]]. James appeared for the prosecution, leading Charles and Danckwerts. At the beginning of the hearing, the report of the Exeter trial was read out, at some length, in its entirety. This allowed Collins to submit that the special verdict had been altered. As much was ultimately admitted and it was eventually agreed that it was best that the special verdict be restored to the version agreed by the jury. Collins's attempt to challenge the jurisdiction of the court was rejected by the judges. Collins then submitted that the court was not competent to return a verdict as the Exeter jury had not given a conditional verdict asserting that the jury would find in accordance with the judge's ruling. Though this troubled the judges, especially Grove, the point was eventually dismissed as one of form only.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=225\u2013228}}.</ref>\n\nJames submitted that there was no common law authority to support the proposition that necessity was a defence to murder. The Saint Christopher case was rejected as a precedent because it had not been formally recorded in the law reports. Before Collins started his submissions, Lord Coleridge instructed him to confine his remarks to murder, thereby dismissing the plausible alternative that necessity was a [[partial defence]] leading to a conviction for manslaughter by analogy with the partial defence of [[Provocation (legal)|provocation]]. Collins responded by citing ''United States v. Holmes'' (1842) and discussing the various theoretical and ethical arguments in favour of the necessity defence. At the conclusion of Collins' submissions, the judges withdrew. They returned after a few moments and Lord Coleridge declared, \"We are all of the opinion that the conviction should be affirmed but we will put our reasons in writing and give them on Saturday next.\" After some technical legal discussion, Lord Coleridge committed Dudley and Stephens to [[Holloway Prison]], which then held both men and women, until Tuesday, 9 December, when the court would deliver its reasons and its [[sentence (law)|sentence]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=229\u2013237}}.</ref>\n\nThe panel of judges found that there was no common law defence of necessity to a charge of murder, either on the basis of legal precedent or the basis of ethics and morality.<ref name=\"report\">''R v.

By 11 December, there was still no announcement and it seemed that, their having been convicted, public opinion was moving against the men. Any exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy would be exercised by [[Queen Victoria]] on the advice of the Home Secretary Harcourt.\n\nThough Harcourt was personally in favour of abolition of the death penalty, he was conscientious in his official duties. He took the judgment of the court seriously, that the men were guilty of murder and feared that [[commutation (law)|commuting]] the sentence to anything other than [[life imprisonment]] would mock the law. The Attorney General felt that a life sentence would not resist the attack of public opinion. He noted that the court had withheld a finding of manslaughter from the jury but that had it been available it would have been the jury's verdict and \"no judge would have inflicted more than three months' [[imprisonment]]\". Solicitor General Sir Farrer Herschell concurred. Based on James's and Herschell's advice, on 12 December, Harcourt decided on six months' imprisonment. Dudley and Stephens were advised the next day but were somewhat disappointed at so long in custody. Dudley never accepted the justice of his conviction.<ref>{{Harvnb|Simpson|1984|pp=239\u2013247}}.</ref> The two men were released around 7:00&nbsp;a.m. on 20 May 1885.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Mignonette Case|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000159/18850520/025/0004|accessdate=21 August 2014|work=North-Eastern Daily Gazette|date=20 May 1885|page=4|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n==Cultural impact==\nThe case is familiar among lawyers in common law jurisdictions\u2014that is, England and many, though not all, former British territories\u2014and is universally studied by law students in such jurisdictions.

[[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s only novel, ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]]'', published in 1838, features a character named Richard Parker, who, after a shipwreck, becomes a victim of cannibalism by the ship's remaining survivors. Writer [[Yann Martel]] in his 2001 novel ''[[Life of Pi]]'' picked up on these occurrences, and named the book's shipwrecked Bengal tiger [[Richard Parker (Life of Pi)|Richard Parker]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Books/story?id=124838&page=1|title=Q and A With 'Life of Pi' Author|date=2006-01-06|website=ABC News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131110744/http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Books/story?id=124838&page=1|archive-date=2011-01-31|url-status=dead|access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref>\n\nThe case was also the basis for a famous [[Monty Python]] [[Sketch comedy|sketch]], titled \"[[Lifeboat sketch|Lifeboat (Cannibalism)/Still no Sign of Land]]\".<ref>[http://orangecow.org/pythonet/sketches/lifeboat.htm orangecow.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908023935/http://orangecow.org/pythonet/sketches/lifeboat.htm |date=2009-09-08 }}</ref> In that sketch, five sailors are on a lifeboat after a shipwreck, and the only way they can survive is through cannibalism. Once they decide whom to eat \u2014 and which body parts \u2014 a waitress is called over to take their orders, complete with vegetables. In ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', this is followed by the controversial \"[[Undertakers sketch]]\", which also features cannibalism.\n\nIn 2004, [[The Avett Brothers]] named their album ''[[Mignonette (album)|Mignonette]]'' after the ship on which the incident occurred.\n\nIn 2017, Canadian author Peter Staadecker published ''The Twelve Man Bilbo Choir'',<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Twelve Man Bilbo Choir|last=Staadecker|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=978-0-9959251-0-6|location=Toronto|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The Twelve Man Bilbo Choir|last=Staadecker|first=Peter|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=978-0-9959251-1-3|location=Toronto|pages=}}</ref> a novel inspired in part by the ''Mignonette'' incident.\n\n[[The Case of the Speluncean Explorers]] is a famous hypothetical case created in 1949 by legal theorist [[Lon L. Fuller]] to illustrate divergent theories of law and morality in the context of facts heavily based around those in ''Dudley and Stephens''.\n\nA plaque commemorating Richard Parker can be found in the churchyard of Jesus Chapel on [[Peartree Green]] in Southampton, near to the site of [[Itchen Ferry village]] whence he came.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cospatrick (ship)|''Cospatrick'' (ship)]]\n* [[Necessity in English law]]\n* [[Necessity in Canadian law]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n==Other References==\n* {{citation |last=Clarke |first=R.

of Malaysia|state]] of [[Malaysia]] on the west coast of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Perak has land borders with the Malaysian states of [[Kedah]] to the north, [[Penang]] to the northwest, [[Kelantan]] and [[Pahang]] to the east, and [[Selangor]] to the south. [[Thailand]]'s [[Yala Province|Yala]] and [[Narathiwat Province|Narathiwat]] provinces both lie to the northeast.  Perak's capital city, [[Ipoh]], was known historically for its [[tin]]-mining activities until the price of the metal dropped, severely affecting the state's economy. The royal capital remains [[Kuala Kangsar]], where the palace of the [[Sultan of Perak]] is located. As of 2018, the state's population was 2,500,000. Perak has [[biodiversity|diverse]] tropical [[rainforest]]s and an [[equatorial climate]]. The state's [[mountain range]]s belong to the [[Titiwangsa Range]], which is part of the larger [[Tenasserim Hills|Tenasserim Range]] connecting [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]] and Malaysia. Perak's [[Mount Korbu]] is the highest point of the range.\n\nThe discovery of an ancient skeleton in Perak supplied missing information on the migration of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' from mainland [[Asia]] through [[Southeast Asia]] to the [[Australia (continent)|Australian]] continent. Known as Perak Man, the skeleton is dated at around 10,000 years old. An early [[Hinduism|Hindu]] or [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] kingdom, followed by several other minor kingdoms, existed before the [[Islam in Southeast Asia|arrival of Islam]]. By 1528, a Muslim sultanate began to emerge in Perak, out of the remnants of the [[Malaccan Sultanate]]. Although able to resist Siamese occupation for more than two hundred years, the Sultanate was partly controlled by the [[Sumatra]]-based [[Aceh Sultanate]]. This was particularly the case after the Aceh lineage took over the royal succession. With the arrival of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), and the VOC's increasing conflicts with Aceh, Perak began to distance itself from Acehnese control. The presence of the English [[East India Company]] (EIC) in the nearby [[Straits Settlements]] of Penang provided additional protection for the state, with further Siamese attempts to conquer Perak thwarted by British expeditionary forces.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] was signed to prevent further conflict between the British and the Dutch. It enabled the British to expand their control in the Malay Peninsula without interference from other foreign powers. The [[Pangkor Treaty of 1874|1874 Pangkor Treaty]] provided for direct British intervention, with Perak appointing a British [[Resident (title)|Resident]]. Following Perak's subsequent absorption into the [[Federated Malay States]] (FMS), the British reformed administration of the sultanate through a new style of government, actively promoting a [[market-driven economy]] and maintaining law and order while combatting the [[slavery]] widely practised across Perak at the time. The three-year [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|Japanese occupation]] in [[World War II]] halted further progress. After the war, Perak became part of the temporary [[Malayan Union]], before being absorbed into the [[Federation of Malaya]]. It gained full independence through the Federation, which subsequently became Malaysia on 16 September 1963.\n\nPerak is ethnically, culturally and linguistically diverse. The state is known for several traditional dances: ''bubu'', ''dabus'', and ''labu sayong'', the latter name also referring to Perak's unique traditional [[pottery]]. The head of state is the Sultan of Perak, and the head of government is the ''[[List of Menteris Besar of Perak|Menteri Besar]]''. Government is closely modelled on the [[Westminster system|Westminster parliamentary system]], with the state administration divided into administrative districts. Islam is the [[state religion]], and other religions may be practised freely. [[Malaysian language|Malay]] and [[English language|English]] are recognised as the official languages of Perak. The economy is mainly based on [[Tertiary sector of the economy|services]] and [[Secondary sector of the economy|manufacturing]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are many theories about the origin of the name Perak.<ref name=\"etymology\">{{cite web|url=http://says.com/my/lifestyle/the-origins-of-state-names-in-malaysia|title=The Stories And Facts Behind How The 13 States Of Malaysia Got Their Names|author=Tang Ruxyn|publisher=Says.com|date=26 April 2017|accessdate=8 September 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113091221/http://says.com/my/lifestyle/the-origins-of-state-names-in-malaysia|archivedate=13 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"varous theories\">{{cite web|url=http://mygeoname.mygeoportal.gov.my/exportpdf00.jsp?kodnegeri=08|title=Dokumen Gazetir (Perak Darul Ridzuan \u2013 Sejarah)|trans-title=Gazette Document (Perak Darul Ridzuan - History)|language=Malay|publisher=Geographical Names Database of Malaysia|accessdate=9 September 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909074614/http://mygeoname.mygeoportal.gov.my/exportpdf00.jsp?kodnegeri=08|archivedate=9 September 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Although not used until after 1529, the most popular etymology is \"[[silver (colour)|silver]]\" (in [[Malay language|Malay]]: ''perak'').

of Malaysia|state]] of [[Malaysia]] on the west coast of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Perak has land borders with the Malaysian states of [[Kedah]] to the north, [[Penang]] to the northwest, [[Kelantan]] and [[Pahang]] to the east, and [[Selangor]] to the south. [[Thailand]]'s [[Yala Province|Yala]] and [[Narathiwat Province|Narathiwat]] provinces both lie to the northeast.  Perak's capital city, [[Ipoh]], was known historically for its [[tin]]-mining activities until the price of the metal dropped, severely affecting the state's economy. The royal capital remains [[Kuala Kangsar]], where the palace of the [[Sultan of Perak]] is located. As of 2018, the state's population was 2,500,000. Perak has [[biodiversity|diverse]] tropical [[rainforest]]s and an [[equatorial climate]]. The state's [[mountain range]]s belong to the [[Titiwangsa Range]], which is part of the larger [[Tenasserim Hills|Tenasserim Range]] connecting [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]] and Malaysia. Perak's [[Mount Korbu]] is the highest point of the range.\n\nThe discovery of an ancient skeleton in Perak supplied missing information on the migration of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' from mainland [[Asia]] through [[Southeast Asia]] to the [[Australia (continent)|Australian]] continent. Known as Perak Man, the skeleton is dated at around 10,000 years old. An early [[Hinduism|Hindu]] or [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] kingdom, followed by several other minor kingdoms, existed before the [[Islam in Southeast Asia|arrival of Islam]]. By 1528, a Muslim sultanate began to emerge in Perak, out of the remnants of the [[Malaccan Sultanate]]. Although able to resist Siamese occupation for more than two hundred years, the Sultanate was partly controlled by the [[Sumatra]]-based [[Aceh Sultanate]]. This was particularly the case after the Aceh lineage took over the royal succession. With the arrival of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), and the VOC's increasing conflicts with Aceh, Perak began to distance itself from Acehnese control. The presence of the English [[East India Company]] (EIC) in the nearby [[Straits Settlements]] of Penang provided additional protection for the state, with further Siamese attempts to conquer Perak thwarted by British expeditionary forces.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] was signed to prevent further conflict between the British and the Dutch. It enabled the British to expand their control in the Malay Peninsula without interference from other foreign powers. The [[Pangkor Treaty of 1874|1874 Pangkor Treaty]] provided for direct British intervention, with Perak appointing a British [[Resident (title)|Resident]]. Following Perak's subsequent absorption into the [[Federated Malay States]] (FMS), the British reformed administration of the sultanate through a new style of government, actively promoting a [[market-driven economy]] and maintaining law and order while combatting the [[slavery]] widely practised across Perak at the time. The three-year [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|Japanese occupation]] in [[World War II]] halted further progress. After the war, Perak became part of the temporary [[Malayan Union]], before being absorbed into the [[Federation of Malaya]]. It gained full independence through the Federation, which subsequently became Malaysia on 16 September 1963.\n\nPerak is ethnically, culturally and linguistically diverse. The state is known for several traditional dances: ''bubu'', ''dabus'', and ''labu sayong'', the latter name also referring to Perak's unique traditional [[pottery]]. The head of state is the Sultan of Perak, and the head of government is the ''[[List of Menteris Besar of Perak|Menteri Besar]]''. Government is closely modelled on the [[Westminster system|Westminster parliamentary system]], with the state administration divided into administrative districts. Islam is the [[state religion]], and other religions may be practised freely. [[Malaysian language|Malay]] and [[English language|English]] are recognised as the official languages of Perak. The economy is mainly based on [[Tertiary sector of the economy|services]] and [[Secondary sector of the economy|manufacturing]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThere are many theories about the origin of the name Perak.<ref name=\"etymology\">{{cite web|url=http://says.com/my/lifestyle/the-origins-of-state-names-in-malaysia|title=The Stories And Facts Behind How The 13 States Of Malaysia Got Their Names|author=Tang Ruxyn|publisher=Says.com|date=26 April 2017|accessdate=8 September 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113091221/http://says.com/my/lifestyle/the-origins-of-state-names-in-malaysia|archivedate=13 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=\"varous theories\">{{cite web|url=http://mygeoname.mygeoportal.gov.my/exportpdf00.jsp?kodnegeri=08|title=Dokumen Gazetir (Perak Darul Ridzuan \u2013 Sejarah)|trans-title=Gazette Document (Perak Darul Ridzuan - History)|language=Malay|publisher=Geographical Names Database of Malaysia|accessdate=9 September 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909074614/http://mygeoname.mygeoportal.gov.my/exportpdf00.jsp?kodnegeri=08|archivedate=9 September 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Although not used until after 1529, the most popular etymology is \"[[silver (colour)|silver]]\" (in [[Malay language|Malay]]: ''perak'').

The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague Terentiy Maltsev, who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow deeply into the soil (1 to 2 [[Chi (unit))|chi]]). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deeply would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pests Campaign ====\n{{Main Article|Four Pests Campaign}}\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\nBeginning in 1957, the [[Communist Party of China]] began to report excessive production of grains because of pressure from above to succeed. However, the actual production of grains throughout China was decreasing from 1957\u20131961. For examples,  \n\n* In [[Sichuan Province]], even though the collected grain was decreasing from 1958\u20131961, the numbers reported to the central government kept increasing.<ref name=\"Jisheng2012\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=240}}</ref>\n* In [[Gansu]], the grain yield declined by 4,273,000 [[Tonne|tonnes]] from 1957 to 1961.<ref name=\":15\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958-1962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=126}}</ref>\n\nThis series of events resulted in an \"illusion of superabundance (\u6d6e\u5938\u98ce)\", and the Party believed that they had an excess amount of grains. On the contrary, the crop yields were in fact lower than average. For instance, Beijing believed that \"in 1960 state granaries would have 50 billion ''[[Chinese units of measurement|jin]]'' of grain,\" when they actually contained 12.7 billion ''jin.''<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|author2=Felix Wemheuer|author3=Gao Hua|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=177|chapter=Food Augmentation Methods and Food Substitutes during the Great Famine}}</ref> The effects of the illusion of superabundance were significant, leaving some historians to argue that it being the major cause of much of the starvation throughout China. Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref name=\"Yang\">{{cite book|author=Dali L. Yang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmLuoAkMKrkC|title=Calamity and Reform in China: State, Rural Society, and Institutional Change Since the Great Leap Famine|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8047-3470-7|page=65}}</ref> <blockquote>First, it led to planners to shift lands from grain to economic crops, such as cotton, sugarcane, and beets, and divert huge numbers agricultural laborers into industrial sectors, fueling state demand for procured grain from the countryside. Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== More policies from the central government ===\nEconomists Xin Meng, [[Nancy Qian]] and Pierre Yared showed that, much like Nobel laureate [[Amartya Sen]]'s earlier claims, aggregate production was sufficient for avoiding famine and that the famine was caused by over-procurement and poor distribution within the country. They show that unlike most other famines, there was surprisingly more deaths in places that produced more food per capita and argue that the inflexibility in the centrally planned food procurement system explains at least half of the famine mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meng|first=Xin|last2=Qian|first2=Nancy|last3=Yared|first3=Pierre|date=2015-10-01|title=The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959\u20131961|url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/82/4/1568/2607347|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1568\u20131611|doi=10.1093/restud/rdv016|issn=0034-6527}}</ref> Economic historians James Kung and Shuo Chen show that there was more over procurement in places where politicians faced more competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kung|first=James Kai-Sing|last2=Chen|first2=Shuo|date=February 2011|title=The Tragedy of the Nomenklatura: Career Incentives and Political Radicalism during China's Great Leap Famine|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=105|issue=1|pages=27\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0003055410000626|issn=1537-5943}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, policies from the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) and the central government that were implemented, particularly the [[Three Red Banners]] and the [[Socialist Education Movement]] (SEM), proved to be ideologically detrimental to the aggrevating famine. The Three Red Banners of the CCP \"sparked the fanaticism of 1958\"  and the implementation of the [[Mass line|Mass Line]], one of the three banners which told people to, \"go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, better, and more economical results\" directly links to the pressures officials felt when reporting a superabundance of grain.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=87}}</ref> The SEM, established in 1957, also led to the severity of the famine in various ways, including causing the \"illusion of superabundance (\u6d6e\u5938\u98ce)\".

As the Great Leap Forward progressed, many provincial leaders began to extend their reach by working closely with Mao and higher Party leaders; which, in turn resulted in these provincial leaders abusing power that they did not actually have.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L.

This hatred led to peasants becoming unable to openly speak on collectivization and state grain purchase. By enforcing such passivity at a local level while there already was passivity at an official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=110|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi. Anhui, having a radical pro-Mao government, was led by [[Zeng Xisheng]] who was \"dictatorial\" with ties to Mao.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=212\u2013213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref> Zeng firmly believed in the Great Leap Forward and tried to hold relationships with higher officials rather than keep close local ties. Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded that much of the severity of the famine came down to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating

Moreover, according to [[Yang Jisheng (journalist)|Yang Jisheng]] who was a senior journalist from [[Xinhua News Agency]], [[Xue Muqiao]], then head of the [[National Bureau of Statistics of China|National Statistics Bureau of China]], said in 1958 that \u201cwe give whatever figures the upper-level wants\u201d to overstate natural disasters and relieve official responsibility for deaths due to starvation.<ref name=\":7\" /> Yang claimed that he investigated other sources including a non-government archive of meteorological data from 350 weather stations across China, and the droughts, floods, and temperatures during 1958-1961 were within the typical patterns for China.<ref name=\":7\" /> Western scholars have also pointed out that:<blockquote>Many foreign observers felt that these reports of weather-related crop failures were designed to cover up political factors that had led to poor agricultural performance. They also suspected that local officials tended to exaggerate such reports to obtain more state assistance or tax relief. Clearly, the weather contributed to the appalling drop in output, but it is impossible to assess to what extent. <ref name=\":11\">{{Cite journal|last=Ashton|first=Basil|last2=Hill|first2=Kenneth|last3=Piazza|first3=Alan|last4=Zeitz|first4=Robin|date=1984|title=Famine in China, 1958-61|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1973284.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Ac9eb43504cd6326446fcc77dbbdfd856|journal=Population and Development Review|volume=10|pages=613-645|via=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Aftermath ==\n\n=== Initial cover-ups ===\nLocal party leaders, for their part, conspired to cover up shortfalls and reassign blame in order to protect their own lives and positions.{{citation needed|reason=They did cover up shortfalls and invent numbers, but the second part of this needs a citation.|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn visits to [[Henan province]] in 1958, Mao observed what local officials claimed was increases in crop yield of one thousand to three thousand percent achieved, supposedly, in massive 24-hour pushes organized by the officials which they called \"sputnik launches\".  But the numbers were faked, and so were the fields that Mao observed, which had been carefully prepared in advance of Mao's visit by local officials, who removed shoots of grain from various fields and carefully transplanted them into a field prepared especially for Mao, which appeared to be a bumper crop.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nThe local officials became trapped by these sham demonstrations to Mao, and exhorted the peasants to reach unattainable goals, by \"deep ploughing and close planting\", and other techniques. This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields. No one was in a position to challenge Mao's ideas as incorrect, so peasants pulled out their bedding and coats into the fields, added seeds and water, and after they sprouted, buried the materials under the soil once the seedlings were high enough.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nIn a similar manner to the massive Soviet-created famine in Ukraine (the [[Holodomor]]), doctors were prohibited from listing \"starvation\" as a cause of death on death certificates. This kind of deception was far from uncommon; a famous [[propaganda]] picture from the famine shows Chinese children from [[Shandong]] province ostensibly standing atop a field of wheat, so densely grown that it could apparently support their weight. In reality, they were standing on a bench concealed beneath the plants, and the \"field\" was again entirely composed of individually transplanted stalks.<ref>{{cite

The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague Terentiy Maltsev, who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow deeply into the soil (1 to 2 [[Chi (unit))|chi]]). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deeply would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pests Campaign ====\n{{Main Article|Four Pests Campaign}}\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\nBeginning in 1957, the [[Communist Party of China]] began to report excessive production of grains because of pressure from above to succeed. However, the actual production of grains throughout China was decreasing from 1957\u20131961. For examples,  \n\n* In [[Sichuan Province]], even though the collected grain was decreasing from 1958\u20131961, the numbers reported to the central government kept increasing.<ref name=\"Jisheng2012\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=240}}</ref>\n* In [[Gansu]], the grain yield declined by 4,273,000 [[Tonne|tonnes]] from 1957 to 1961.<ref name=\":15\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958-1962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=126}}</ref>\n\nThis series of events resulted in an \"illusion of superabundance (\u6d6e\u5938\u98ce)\", and the Party believed that they had an excess amount of grains. On the contrary, the crop yields were in fact lower than average. For instance, Beijing believed that \"in 1960 state granaries would have 50 billion ''[[Chinese units of measurement|jin]]'' of grain,\" when they actually contained 12.7 billion ''jin.''<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|author2=Felix Wemheuer|author3=Gao Hua|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=177|chapter=Food Augmentation Methods and Food Substitutes during the Great Famine}}</ref> The effects of the illusion of superabundance were significant, leaving some historians to argue that it being the major cause of much of the starvation throughout China. Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref name=\"Yang\">{{cite book|author=Dali L. Yang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmLuoAkMKrkC|title=Calamity and Reform in China: State, Rural Society, and Institutional Change Since the Great Leap Famine|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8047-3470-7|page=65}}</ref> <blockquote>First, it led to planners to shift lands from grain to economic crops, such as cotton, sugarcane, and beets, and divert huge numbers agricultural laborers into industrial sectors, fueling state demand for procured grain from the countryside. Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== More policies from the central government ===\nEconomists Xin Meng, [[Nancy Qian]] and Pierre Yared showed that, much like Nobel laureate [[Amartya Sen]]'s earlier claims, aggregate production was sufficient for avoiding famine and that the famine was caused by over-procurement and poor distribution within the country. They show that unlike most other famines, there was surprisingly more deaths in places that produced more food per capita and argue that the inflexibility in the centrally planned food procurement system explains at least half of the famine mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meng|first=Xin|last2=Qian|first2=Nancy|last3=Yared|first3=Pierre|date=2015-10-01|title=The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959\u20131961|url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/82/4/1568/2607347|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1568\u20131611|doi=10.1093/restud/rdv016|issn=0034-6527}}</ref> Economic historians James Kung and Shuo Chen show that there was more over procurement in places where politicians faced more competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kung|first=James Kai-Sing|last2=Chen|first2=Shuo|date=February 2011|title=The Tragedy of the Nomenklatura: Career Incentives and Political Radicalism during China's Great Leap Famine|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=105|issue=1|pages=27\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0003055410000626|issn=1537-5943}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, policies from the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) and the central government that were implemented, particularly the [[Three Red Banners]] and the [[Socialist Education Movement]] (SEM), proved to be ideologically detrimental to the aggrevating famine. The Three Red Banners of the CCP \"sparked the fanaticism of 1958\"  and the implementation of the [[Mass line|Mass Line]], one of the three banners which told people to, \"go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, better, and more economical results\" directly links to the pressures officials felt when reporting a superabundance of grain.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=87}}</ref> The SEM, established in 1957, also led to the severity of the famine in various ways, including causing the \"illusion of superabundance (\u6d6e\u5938\u98ce)\".

As the Great Leap Forward progressed, many provincial leaders began to extend their reach by working closely with Mao and higher Party leaders; which, in turn resulted in these provincial leaders abusing power that they did not actually have.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L.

This hatred led to peasants becoming unable to openly speak on collectivization and state grain purchase. By enforcing such passivity at a local level while there already was passivity at an official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=110|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi. Anhui, having a radical pro-Mao government, was led by [[Zeng Xisheng]] who was \"dictatorial\" with ties to Mao.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=212\u2013213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref> Zeng firmly believed in the Great Leap Forward and tried to hold relationships with higher officials rather than keep close local ties. Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded that much of the severity of the famine came down to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating

droughts, floods, and temperatures during 1958-1961 were within the typical patterns for China.<ref name=\":7\" /> Western scholars have also pointed out that:<blockquote>Many foreign observers felt that these reports of weather-related crop failures were designed to cover up political factors that had led to poor agricultural performance. They also suspected that local officials tended to exaggerate such reports to obtain more state assistance or tax relief. Clearly, the weather contributed to the appalling drop in output, but it is impossible to assess to what extent. <ref name=\":11\">{{Cite journal|last=Ashton|first=Basil|last2=Hill|first2=Kenneth|last3=Piazza|first3=Alan|last4=Zeitz|first4=Robin|date=1984|title=Famine in China, 1958-61|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1973284.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3Ac9eb43504cd6326446fcc77dbbdfd856|journal=Population and Development Review|volume=10|pages=613-645|via=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Aftermath ==\n\n=== Initial cover-ups ===\nLocal party leaders, for their part, conspired to cover up shortfalls and reassign blame in order to protect their own lives and positions.{{citation needed|reason=They did cover up shortfalls and invent numbers, but the second part of this needs a citation.|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn visits to [[Henan province]] in 1958, Mao observed what local officials claimed was increases in crop yield of one thousand to three thousand percent achieved, supposedly, in massive 24-hour pushes organized by the officials which they called \"sputnik launches\".  But the numbers were faked, and so were the fields that Mao observed, which had been carefully prepared in advance of Mao's visit by local officials, who removed shoots of grain from various fields and carefully transplanted them into a field prepared especially for Mao, which appeared to be a bumper crop.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nThe local officials became trapped by these sham demonstrations to Mao, and exhorted the peasants to reach unattainable goals, by \"deep ploughing and close planting\", and other techniques. This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields. No one was in a position to challenge Mao's ideas as incorrect, so peasants pulled out their bedding and coats into the fields, added seeds and water, and after they sprouted, buried the materials under the soil once the seedlings were high enough.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nIn a similar manner to the massive Soviet-created famine in Ukraine (the [[Holodomor]]), doctors were prohibited from listing \"starvation\" as a cause of death on death certificates. This kind of deception was far from uncommon; a famous [[propaganda]] picture from the famine shows Chinese children from [[Shandong]] province ostensibly standing atop a field of wheat, so densely grown that it could apparently support their weight. In reality, they were standing on a bench concealed beneath the plants, and the \"field\" was again entirely composed of individually transplanted stalks.<ref>{{cite

My grandmother used to sit me on her knee and sing songs like ''Danny Boy'' from as early as I can remember. A singer herself in her earlier years, she has always been a never-ending source of songs. It's this legacy of music that she's been passing down to me since my childhood, and it's many of these beautiful old songs that I've explored here on my album.\"</blockquote>\n\nOn the day before [[St. Patrick's Day]] 2007, she performed as part of Celtic Woman for President [[George W.
