Then and subsequently the population have been [[Ism'aili]] [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] [[Muslim]]s.\n\nHaraz is as famous for its fortified villages which cling to nearly inaccessible rocky peaks. Their imposing architecture meets two needs: defending the villagers, while leaving plenty of space for crops. Each town is built like a castle; the houses, themselves, form the wall, equipped with one or two easily defensible doors. Constructed from sandstone and basalt, the buildings are integrated into the landscape and it is difficult to tell where the rock and the village begins or ends. The mountain is divided into terraces of a few acres or more, separated by walls sometimes several meters high. On these terraced fields grow alfalfa for livestock, millet, lentils, large areas for coffee and [[Khat|qat]].\n\nWithin a day's journey are [[Bani Murrah]] and other villages located on the ridge overlooking [[Manakhah]]. Manakhah is the heart of mountain range, a large town whose market attracts villagers from the entire neighbourhood. [[Al Hajjara]], to the west of Manakhah, is a walled village whose citadel was founded in the 12th century by the Sulayhids. From there, other villages are accessible, such as [[Bayt al-Qamus]]  and [[Bayt Shimran]]. The village of [[Hutaib]] is built on a platform of red sandstone, facing a view of terraced hills which host a score of villages.

The mandate of a central bank typically includes either one of the three following objectives or a combination of them, in varying order of preference, according to the country or the region: Price stability, i.e. inflation-targeting; the facilitation of maximum employment in the economy; the assurance of moderate, long term, interest rates.<ref name=fedmon/>\n\nThe central bank is the banker of the government<ref group=note>Formally, the Treasury's banker, or the banker of the respective competent authority, depending on the country, e.g. of the Ministry of Finance</ref> and provides to the government a range of services at the operational level, such as managing the Treasury's single account, and also acting as its fiscal agent (e.g. by running [[auction]]s), its settlement agent, and its bond registrar.<ref name=pessoa>Pessoa (2012)</ref> A central bank cannot become insolvent in its own currency. However, a central bank can become insolvent in liabilities on [[foreign currency]].<ref name=buiter>Buiter (2008)</ref>\n\nCentral banks operate in practically every nation in the world, with few exceptions.<ref>[[List of central banks]]</ref> There are some groups of countries, for which, through agreement, a single entity acts as their central bank, such as the  organization of states of Central Africa, <ref group=note>Established by [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]], [[Republic of Congo]], [[Equatorial Guinea]] and [[Gabon]]</ref> which all have a common central bank, the [[Bank of Central African States]], or monetary unions, such as the [[Eurozone]], whereby nations retain their respective central bank yet submit to the policies of the central entity, the [[European Central Bank|ECB]]. Central banking institutions are generally independent of the government [[Executive (government)|executive]].<ref name=benoit>C\u0153ur\u00e9 (2017)</ref>\n\nThe central bank's activities directly affect interest rates, through controlling the [[Federal funds rate|base rate]], and indirectly affect stock prices, the economy's wealth, and the [[national currency]]'s exchange rate.<ref name=fedmon/> [[Monetarist]]s and some [[Austrian School|Austrians]]<ref group=note>\"The chief cause of inflation, [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] wrote, is governmental control of the money supply.\" Spencer (1975)</ref> argue that the central bank should control the money supply, through its monetary operations.<ref group=note>\"Empirical studies of relations between the monetary base and the total money supply establish a strong basis for believing that central banks can control the money supply.\" Meigs (1971)</ref><ref>Jahan (2014)</ref> Critics of the mainstream view maintain that central-bank operations can affect but not control the money supply.<ref group=note>\"Another common misconception is that the central bank determines the quantity of loans and deposits in the economy by controlling the quantity of central bank money. ... Rather than controlling the quantity of reserves, central banks today typically implement monetary policy by setting the price of reserves \u2014 that is, interest rates.\" McLeay (2014)</ref>\n\n===Open-market operations===\nOpen-market operations (OMOs) concern the purchase and sale of securities in the open market by a central bank. OMOs essentially swap one type of [[financial asset]]s for another; when the central bank buys bonds held by the banks or the private sector, bank reserves  increase while bonds held by the banks or the public decrease. Temporary operations are typically used to address reserve needs that are deemed to be transitory in nature, while permanent operations accommodate the longer-term factors driving the expansion of the central bank's [[balance sheet]]; such a primary factor is typically the trend of the money-supply growth in the economy. Among the temporary, open-market operations are [[repurchase agreement]]s (repos) or reverse repos, while permanent ones involve outright purchases or sales of securities.<ref name=omo>[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_openmarketops.htm Open-market operations], FRS</ref> Each open-market operation by the central bank affects its balance sheet.<ref name=omo/>\n\n===Monetary policy===\n{{main|Monetary policy}}\nMonetary policy is the process by which the monetary authority of a country, typically the central bank (or the [[currency board]]), manages the level of short-term [[interest rate]]s<ref group=note>It has been argued that the central bank of a fiscally and monetarily sovereign nation can actually affect, if not dictate, the whole interest spectrum \u2013 above which, of course, as it is argued, adjustments are made for their actual conduct of business by commercial banks and the private sector, in accordance to their assessments, objectives, and preferences. E.g.: \"Monetary policy \u2013 and there we are increasingly certain \u2013 cannot only influence the expectations component, but also the term premium. ... Central banks can lower long-term rates by removing duration risk from the market.\" C\u0153ur\u00e9 (2017). Also:  \"There is no evidence that the central bank has any meaningful control over the...spread between the short-term and the long-term rate of interest [but] it is quite clear that the central bank has full control over the long-term rate of interest. Pilkington (2014)</ref> and influences the availability and the cost of credit in the economy,<ref name=fedmon>[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy.htm Monetary policy], FRS</ref> as well as overall economic activity.<ref name=imfmon>IMF (2017)</ref>\n\n[[Central bank]]s conduct monetary policy usually through [[open market operations]]. The purchase of debt, and the resulting increase in bank reserves, is called \"[[monetary easing]].\" An extraordinary process of monetary easing is denoted as \"[[quantitative easing]]\", whose intent is to stimulate the economy by increasing liquidity and promoting bank lending.\n\n==Money creation by government spending==\nState spending is part of the state's [[fiscal policy|fiscal]] policy. [[Deficit spending]] involves the state spending into the economy more than it receives (in taxes and other payments) within a certain period of time, typically the budget year.<ref>Cacy (1975)</ref>\n\nDeficit spending increases the money supply.<ref name=mankiw2014/> The extent and the timing of budget deficits is disputed among schools of economic analysis. The mainstream view is that net spending by  the public sector is [[inflation]]ary in so far as it is \"financed\" by the banking system, including the central bank, and not by the sale of state debt to the public.<ref>Hein (1981)</ref>\n\nThe existence itself of budget deficits is generally considered inflationary by mainstream economics,<ref name=mankiw2014/> so policies are prescribed for the lowering of the deficit,<ref group=note>And of state debt</ref> while  [[Heterodox economics|heterodox economists]] such as [[Post-Keynesians]] treat deficit spending as \"simply\" a fiscal policy option.<ref name=mitch>Mitchell (2008)</ref>\n\n== Fractional reserve theory of money creation ==\n{{Main|Money multiplier}}\nWhen commercial banks lend out money, they are expanding the amount of bank deposits.<ref name=mcleay>McLeay, Radia, and Thomas, 2014</ref> \nThe modern banking system can expand the money supply of a country beyond the amount created or targeted by the central bank, creating most of the [[broad money]] in the system through [[fractional-reserve banking]].<ref name=mcleay/>\n\nBanks are limited in the total amount they can loan by their [[capital adequacy ratio]]s, and their [[required reserve ratio]]s. The required-reserves ratio obliges the bank to keep a minimum, predetermined, percentage of their deposits at an account at the central bank.<ref group=note>Many countries in the world, including major economic powers, such as Canada or New Zealand, do not impose minimum reserves on banks. This does not allow banks to give out loans without limit, since there is always, aside from other considerations, the [[capital adequacy ratio]].</ref> \nThe theory holds that, in a system of [[fractional-reserve banking]], where banks ordinarily keep only a fraction of their deposits in reserves, an initial bank loan creates more money than is initially lent out.\n\nThe maximum ratio of loans to deposits is the required-reserve ratio <math>\\mathit{RRR}</math>, which is determined by the central bank, as\n\n: <math>\\mathit{RRR}=\\frac{R}{D}</math>\n\nwhere <math>R</math> are reserves and <math>D</math> are deposits.\n\nIn practice, if the central bank imposes a [[required reserve ratio]] (<math>\\mathit{RRR}</math>) of 0.10, then each commercial bank is obliged to keep at least 10% of its total deposits as reserves, i.e. in the account it has at the central bank.\n\nThe process of money creation can be illustrated with the following example in the [[United States]]: Corporation A deposits $100,000 into [[Bank of America]]. Bank of America keeps $10,000 as reserves at the [[Federal Reserve]]. To make a profit, Bank of America loans the remaining $90,000 to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. The government spends the $90,000 by buying something from corporation B. B deposits the $90,000 into its account with [[Wells Fargo]]. Wells Fargo keeps $9,000 as reserves at the Federal Reserve, and then lends the remaining $81,000 to the government. If this chain continues indefinitely then, in the end, an amount approximating $1,000,000 has gone into circulation and has therefore become part of the total money supply.<ref name=\"mitch=2009\">Mitchell (2009)</ref> Furthermore, the Federal Reserve itself can and does lend money to banks as well as to the federal government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/contact-savings-bonds.htm|title=Federal Reserve Board}}</ref> There is currently neither an explanation on where the money comes from to pay the interest on all these loans, nor is there an explanation as to how the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] manages default on said loans (see [[Lehman Brothers bankruptcy|Lehman Brothers]]). A [[Supply shock|negative supply]] of money is predicted to occur in the event that all loans are repaid at the same time.\n\nThe ratio of the total money added to the money supply (in this case, $1,000,000) to the total money added originally in the monetary base (in this case, $100,000) is the [[money multiplier]].<ref group=note>The origin of the notion of a money multiplier is discussed i.a. in Hegeland (1970)</ref>  \nIn this context, the money multiplier relates changes in the [[monetary base]],<ref \ngroup=note>Also known as High-Powered Money, HPM</ref> \nwhich is the sum of [[bank reserves]] and issued currency, to changes in the [[money supply]].<ref name=mankiw2014 />\n\nIf changes in the monetary base cause a change in the money supply, then\n\n: <math>M_1=\\mathit{MB}\\cdot m \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>M_1</math> is the new money supply, <math>\\mathit{MB}</math> is the monetary base, and <math>m \\,</math> is the money multiplier. Therefore, the money multiplier is<ref name=mankiw2014>Mankiw, 2014</ref>\n\n: <math>m = \\frac{M_1}{\\mathit{MB}} \\leq \\frac{1}{\\mathit{RRR}}</math>\n\nThe central bank can control the money supply, according to this theory, by controlling the monetary base as long as the money multiplier is limited by the required reserve ratio.\n\n== Credit theory of money ==\n{{main|Credit theory of money}}\n\nThe [[fractional-reserve banking|fractional reserve]] theory where the [[money supply]] is limited by the [[money multiplier]] has come under increased criticism since the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]]. It has been observed that the [[bank reserves]] are not a limiting factor because the [[central bank]]s supply more reserves than necessary<ref name=\"SP2013\">Standard & Poors, 2013</ref> and because banks have been able to build up additional reserves when they were needed.<ref name=werner2016>Werner, 2016</ref> Many economists and bankers now believe that the amount of money in circulation is limited only by the demand for loans, not by reserve requirements.<ref>Benes and Kumhof, 2012; Kumhof and Jakab, 2016; McLeay, Radia, and Thomas, 2014</ref>\n\nWhen a bank issues a loan of $1000 to a customer, they debit the customer's loan account with $1000 and at the same time they credit the customer's deposit account with $1000, ready for using. The bank now has a new asset of $1000 and a new liability of $1000. The bank's accounts are still in balance because the assets and liabilities are increased by the same amount. The bank's balance sheet is simply expanded with the amount of $1000. The bank does not take the $1000 out of its reserves. The $1000 are new circulating money that did not exist prior to the transaction.<ref>Kumhof and Jakab, 2016</ref>\n\nA study of banking software demonstrates that the bank does nothing else than adding an amount to the two accounts when they issue a loan.<ref name=werner2016 /> The observation that there appears to be no limit to the amount of credit money that banks can bring into circulation in this way has given rise to the often-heard expression that ''\"Banks are creating money out of thin air\"''.<ref name=\"SP2013\" />\n\nThe amount of money that is created in this way when a loan is issued is equal to the [[Bond (finance)#Principal|principal]] of the loan, but the money needed for paying the [[compound interest]] of the loan has not been created. As a consequence of this process, the amount of [[debt]] in the world exceeds the total money supply. Critics of the current banking system are calling for [[monetary reform]] for this reason.\n\nThe [[credit theory of money]], initiated by [[Joseph Schumpeter]], asserts the central role of banks as creators and allocators of the money supply, and distinguishes between \"productive credit creation\" (allowing non-inflationary [[economic growth]] even at [[full employment]], in the presence of [[technological progress]]) and \"unproductive credit creation\" (resulting in [[inflation]] of either the [[consumer price inflation|consumer-]] or [[asset price inflation|asset-price]] variety).<ref>Schumpeter (1996)</ref>\n\nThe model of bank lending stimulated through central-bank operations (such as \"monetary easing\") has been rejected by [[Neo-Keynesian economics|Neo-Keynesian]]<ref group=note>\"By increasing the volume of their government securities and loans and by lowering Member Bank legal reserve requirements, the Reserve Banks can encourage an increase in the supply of money and bank deposits. Without taking drastic action, [[pushing on a string|they can encourage but they cannot compel]]. For in the middle of a deep depression just when we want Reserve policy to be most effective, the Member Banks are likely to be timid about buying new investments or making loans. If the Reserve authorities buy government bonds in the open market and thereby swell bank reserves, the banks will not put these funds to work but will simply hold reserves.\" Samuelson (1997)</ref>\nand [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian]] analysis<ref name=kelton>Kelton (1998)</ref><ref name=\"mitch=2009\" /> as well as central banks.<ref>Tucker (2007)</ref><ref name=Disyatat>Disyatat (2010)</ref><ref group=note>\"In reality, neither are [bank] reserves a binding constraint on lending, nor does the central bank fix the amount of reserves that are available. ... Banks first decide how much to lend depending on the profitable lending opportunities available to them \u2014 which will, crucially, depend on the interest rate set by the [central bank].\" McLeay et al. (2014)</ref>\nThe major argument offered by dissident analysis is that any bank balance-sheet expansion (e.g. through a new loan) that leaves the bank short of the required reserves may affect the return it can expect on the loan, because of the extra cost the bank will undertake to return within the ratios limits \u2013 but this does not and  \"will never impede the bank's capacity to give the loan in the first place.\" Banks first lend and ''then'' cover their reserve ratios: The decision whether or not to lend is generally independent of their  reserves with the central bank or their deposits from customers; banks are not lending out deposits or reserves, anyway. Banks lend on the basis of lending criteria, such as the status of the customer's business, the loan's prospects, and/or the overall economic situation.<ref>Wray (2000)</ref>\n\n==Physical currency==\nThe central bank, or other competent, state authorities (such as the Treasury), are typically empowered to create new, physical currency, i.e. paper notes and coins, in order to meet the needs of commercial banks for cash withdrawals, and to replace worn and/or destroyed currency.<ref name=mankiw2012>Mankiw (2012)</ref> The process does not increase the money supply, as such; the term \"printing [new] money\" is considered a misnomer.<ref name=\"what\" />\n\nIn modern economies, relatively little of the supply of [[broad money]] is in physical currency. <ref group=note>For example, in December 2010, in the United States, of the $8.853 trillion broad money supply (M2, table 1), only about 10% (or $915.7 billion, table 3) consisted of coins and paper money. See [http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/20110127/ Statistic], FRS</ref>\n\n==Monetary financing ==\n{{main|Debt monetization}}\n\n===Policy===\n\"Monetary financing\", also \"debt monetization\", occurs when the country's central bank purchases government debt.<ref>Mishkin (2011)</ref> It is considered by mainstream analysis to cause [[inflation]], and often [[hyperinflation]].<ref>Elmendorf (1998)</ref> IMF's former chief economist [[Olivier Blanchard]] states that <blockquote>governments do not create money; the central bank does. But with the central bank's cooperation, the government can in effect finance itself by money creation. It can issue bonds and ask the central bank to buy them. The central bank then pays the government with money it creates, and the government in turn uses that money to finance the deficit. This process is called debt monetization.<ref>Blanchard (2012)</ref></blockquote> The description of the process differs in [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] analysis. Modern [[Chartalism|chartalists]] state: <blockquote>the central bank does not have the option to monetize any of the outstanding government debt or newly issued government debt...[A]s long as the central bank has a mandate to maintain a short-term interest rate target, the size of its purchases and sales of government debt are not discretionary. The central bank's lack of control over the quantity of reserves underscores the impossibility of debt monetization. The central bank is unable to monetize the government debt by purchasing government securities at will because to do so would cause the short-term target rate to fall to zero or to any support rate that it might have in place for excess reserves.<ref name=mitch/></blockquote>\n\n===Restrictions===\nMonetary financing used to be standard monetary policy in many countries, such as Canada or France,<ref name=ryan2015>Ryan-Collins (2015)</ref> while in others it was and still is prohibited. In the [[Eurozone]], Article 123 of the [[Lisbon Treaty]] explicitly prohibits the [[European Central Bank]] from financing public institutions and state governments.<ref>[https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/eaec/fiscal/html/index.en.html Fiscal policies], ECB</ref> In Japan, the nation's [[Bank of Japan|central bank]] \"routinely\" purchases approximately 70% of state debt issued each month,<ref>Evans-Pritchard (2013)</ref> and owns, as of Oct 2018, approximately 440 [[trillion (short scale)|trillion]] [[Yen|JP\u00a5]] (approx. $4trillion)<ref group=note>At a $1=\u00a50.0094 conversion rate</ref> or over 40% of all outstanding government bonds.<ref>[https://www.boj.or.jp/en/statistics/boj/other/mei/index.htm/ Gov't Bonds], [[Bank of Japan]]</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the 1913 [[Federal Reserve Act]] allowed [[Federal Reserve System|federal]] banks to purchase short-term securities directly from the Treasury, in order to facilitate its [[cash]]-management operations. The [[Banking Act of 1935]] prohibited the central bank from directly purchasing Treasury securities, and permitted their purchase and sale only \"in the open market\". In 1942, during [[United States home front during World War II|wartime]], Congress amended the Banking Act's provisions to allow purchases of government debt by the federal banks, with the total amount they'd hold \"not [to] exceed $5 billion.\" After the war, the exemption was renewed, with time limitations, until it was allowed to expire in June 1981.<ref name=garbade>Garbade (2014)</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Money}}\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[Commodity money]]\n* [[Fiat money]]\n* [[Fiscal policy]]\n* [[Functional finance]]\n* [[Gold standard]]\n* [[History of banking]]\n* [[History of money]]\n* [[Monetary economics]]\n* [[Monetary reform]]\n* [[Seigniorage]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|group=note|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|15em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite web |url= https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2012/09/pdf/basics.pdf|title=What Is Money?|last= Asmundson|first= Irena |author-link=|last2= Oner|first2= Ceyda|author-link2=|author-link3= |date= September 2012|website= Finance & Development|publisher= [[IMF]]|access-date=8 March 2018 |quote= }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Benes |first1=Jaromir |last2=Kumhof |first2=Michael |title=The Chicago Plan Revisited |journal=IMF Working Paper |date=2012 |volume=202 |url=https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2016/12/31/The-Chicago-Plan-Revisited-26178}}\n*{{cite book |last= Blanchard|first= Olivier|author-link= Olivier Blanchard |last2=David R.

The mandate of a central bank typically includes either one of the three following objectives or a combination of them, in varying order of preference, according to the country or the region: Price stability, i.e. inflation-targeting; the facilitation of maximum employment in the economy; the assurance of moderate, long term, interest rates.<ref name=fedmon/>\n\nThe central bank is the banker of the government<ref group=note>Formally, the Treasury's banker, or the banker of the respective competent authority, depending on the country, e.g. of the Ministry of Finance</ref> and provides to the government a range of services at the operational level, such as managing the Treasury's single account, and also acting as its fiscal agent (e.g. by running [[auction]]s), its settlement agent, and its bond registrar.<ref name=pessoa>Pessoa (2012)</ref> A central bank cannot become insolvent in its own currency. However, a central bank can become insolvent in liabilities on [[foreign currency]].<ref name=buiter>Buiter (2008)</ref>\n\nCentral banks operate in practically every nation in the world, with few exceptions.<ref>[[List of central banks]]</ref> There are some groups of countries, for which, through agreement, a single entity acts as their central bank, such as the  organization of states of Central Africa, <ref group=note>Established by [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]], [[Republic of Congo]], [[Equatorial Guinea]] and [[Gabon]]</ref> which all have a common central bank, the [[Bank of Central African States]], or monetary unions, such as the [[Eurozone]], whereby nations retain their respective central bank yet submit to the policies of the central entity, the [[European Central Bank|ECB]]. Central banking institutions are generally independent of the government [[Executive (government)|executive]].<ref name=benoit>C\u0153ur\u00e9 (2017)</ref>\n\nThe central bank's activities directly affect interest rates, through controlling the [[Federal funds rate|base rate]], and indirectly affect stock prices, the economy's wealth, and the [[national currency]]'s exchange rate.<ref name=fedmon/> [[Monetarist]]s and some [[Austrian School|Austrians]]<ref group=note>\"The chief cause of inflation, [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] wrote, is governmental control of the money supply.\" Spencer (1975)</ref> argue that the central bank should control the money supply, through its monetary operations.<ref group=note>\"Empirical studies of relations between the monetary base and the total money supply establish a strong basis for believing that central banks can control the money supply.\" Meigs (1971)</ref><ref>Jahan (2014)</ref> Critics of the mainstream view maintain that central-bank operations can affect but not control the money supply.<ref group=note>\"Another common misconception is that the central bank determines the quantity of loans and deposits in the economy by controlling the quantity of central bank money. ... Rather than controlling the quantity of reserves, central banks today typically implement monetary policy by setting the price of reserves \u2014 that is, interest rates.\" McLeay (2014)</ref>\n\n===Open-market operations===\nOpen-market operations (OMOs) concern the purchase and sale of securities in the open market by a central bank. OMOs essentially swap one type of [[financial asset]]s for another; when the central bank buys bonds held by the banks or the private sector, bank reserves  increase while bonds held by the banks or the public decrease. Temporary operations are typically used to address reserve needs that are deemed to be transitory in nature, while permanent operations accommodate the longer-term factors driving the expansion of the central bank's [[balance sheet]]; such a primary factor is typically the trend of the money-supply growth in the economy. Among the temporary, open-market operations are [[repurchase agreement]]s (repos) or reverse repos, while permanent ones involve outright purchases or sales of securities.<ref name=omo>[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_openmarketops.htm Open-market operations], FRS</ref> Each open-market operation by the central bank affects its balance sheet.<ref name=omo/>\n\n===Monetary policy===\n{{main|Monetary policy}}\nMonetary policy is the process by which the monetary authority of a country, typically the central bank (or the [[currency board]]), manages the level of short-term [[interest rate]]s<ref group=note>It has been argued that the central bank of a fiscally and monetarily sovereign nation can actually affect, if not dictate, the whole interest spectrum \u2013 above which, of course, as it is argued, adjustments are made for their actual conduct of business by commercial banks and the private sector, in accordance to their assessments, objectives, and preferences. E.g.: \"Monetary policy \u2013 and there we are increasingly certain \u2013 cannot only influence the expectations component, but also the term premium. ... Central banks can lower long-term rates by removing duration risk from the market.\" C\u0153ur\u00e9 (2017). Also:  \"There is no evidence that the central bank has any meaningful control over the...spread between the short-term and the long-term rate of interest [but] it is quite clear that the central bank has full control over the long-term rate of interest. Pilkington (2014)</ref> and influences the availability and the cost of credit in the economy,<ref name=fedmon>[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy.htm Monetary policy], FRS</ref> as well as overall economic activity.<ref name=imfmon>IMF (2017)</ref>\n\n[[Central bank]]s conduct monetary policy usually through [[open market operations]]. The purchase of debt, and the resulting increase in bank reserves, is called \"[[monetary easing]].\" An extraordinary process of monetary easing is denoted as \"[[quantitative easing]]\", whose intent is to stimulate the economy by increasing liquidity and promoting bank lending.\n\n==Money creation by government spending==\nState spending is part of the state's [[fiscal policy|fiscal]] policy. [[Deficit spending]] involves the state spending into the economy more than it receives (in taxes and other payments) within a certain period of time, typically the budget year.<ref>Cacy (1975)</ref>\n\nDeficit spending increases the money supply.<ref name=mankiw2014/> The extent and the timing of budget deficits is disputed among schools of economic analysis. The mainstream view is that net spending by  the public sector is [[inflation]]ary in so far as it is \"financed\" by the banking system, including the central bank, and not by the sale of state debt to the public.<ref>Hein (1981)</ref>\n\nThe existence itself of budget deficits is generally considered inflationary by mainstream economics,<ref name=mankiw2014/> so policies are prescribed for the lowering of the deficit,<ref group=note>And of state debt</ref> while  [[Heterodox economics|heterodox economists]] such as [[Post-Keynesians]] treat deficit spending as \"simply\" a fiscal policy option.<ref name=mitch>Mitchell (2008)</ref>\n\n== Fractional reserve theory of money creation ==\n{{Main|Money multiplier}}\nWhen commercial banks lend out money, they are expanding the amount of bank deposits.<ref name=mcleay>McLeay, Radia, and Thomas, 2014</ref> \nThe modern banking system can expand the money supply of a country beyond the amount created or targeted by the central bank, creating most of the [[broad money]] in the system through [[fractional-reserve banking]].<ref name=mcleay/>\n\nBanks are limited in the total amount they can loan by their [[capital adequacy ratio]]s, and their [[required reserve ratio]]s. The required-reserves ratio obliges the bank to keep a minimum, predetermined, percentage of their deposits at an account at the central bank.<ref group=note>Many countries in the world, including major economic powers, such as Canada or New Zealand, do not impose minimum reserves on banks. This does not allow banks to give out loans without limit, since there is always, aside from other considerations, the [[capital adequacy ratio]].</ref> \nThe theory holds that, in a system of [[fractional-reserve banking]], where banks ordinarily keep only a fraction of their deposits in reserves, an initial bank loan creates more money than is initially lent out.\n\nThe maximum ratio of loans to deposits is the required-reserve ratio <math>\\mathit{RRR}</math>, which is determined by the central bank, as\n\n: <math>\\mathit{RRR}=\\frac{R}{D}</math>\n\nwhere <math>R</math> are reserves and <math>D</math> are deposits.\n\nIn practice, if the central bank imposes a [[required reserve ratio]] (<math>\\mathit{RRR}</math>) of 0.10, then each commercial bank is obliged to keep at least 10% of its total deposits as reserves, i.e. in the account it has at the central bank.\n\nThe process of money creation can be illustrated with the following example in the [[United States]]: Corporation A deposits $100,000 into [[Bank of America]]. Bank of America keeps $10,000 as reserves at the [[Federal Reserve]]. To make a profit, Bank of America loans the remaining $90,000 to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]]. The government spends the $90,000 by buying something from corporation B. B deposits the $90,000 into its account with [[Wells Fargo]]. Wells Fargo keeps $9,000 as reserves at the Federal Reserve, and then lends the remaining $81,000 to the government. If this chain continues indefinitely then, in the end, an amount approximating $1,000,000 has gone into circulation and has therefore become part of the total money supply.<ref name=\"mitch=2009\">Mitchell (2009)</ref> Furthermore, the Federal Reserve itself can and does lend money to banks as well as to the federal government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/contact-savings-bonds.htm|title=Federal Reserve Board}}</ref> There is currently neither an explanation on where the money comes from to pay the interest on all these loans, nor is there an explanation as to how the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] manages default on said loans (see [[Lehman Brothers bankruptcy|Lehman Brothers]]). A [[Supply shock|negative supply]] of money is predicted to occur in the event that all loans are repaid at the same time.\n\nThe ratio of the total money added to the money supply (in this case, $1,000,000) to the total money added originally in the monetary base (in this case, $100,000) is the [[money multiplier]].<ref group=note>The origin of the notion of a money multiplier is discussed i.a. in Hegeland (1970)</ref>  \nIn this context, the money multiplier relates changes in the [[monetary base]],<ref \ngroup=note>Also known as High-Powered Money, HPM</ref> \nwhich is the sum of [[bank reserves]] and issued currency, to changes in the [[money supply]].<ref name=mankiw2014 />\n\nIf changes in the monetary base cause a change in the money supply, then\n\n: <math>M_1=\\mathit{MB}\\cdot m \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>M_1</math> is the new money supply, <math>\\mathit{MB}</math> is the monetary base, and <math>m \\,</math> is the money multiplier. Therefore, the money multiplier is<ref name=mankiw2014>Mankiw, 2014</ref>\n\n: <math>m = \\frac{M_1}{\\mathit{MB}} \\leq \\frac{1}{\\mathit{RRR}}</math>\n\nThe central bank can control the money supply, according to this theory, by controlling the monetary base as long as the money multiplier is limited by the required reserve ratio.\n\n== Credit theory of money ==\n{{main|Credit theory of money}}\n\nThe [[fractional-reserve banking|fractional reserve]] theory where the [[money supply]] is limited by the [[money multiplier]] has come under increased criticism since the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]]. It has been observed that the [[bank reserves]] are not a limiting factor because the [[central bank]]s supply more reserves than necessary<ref name=\"SP2013\">Standard & Poors, 2013</ref> and because banks have been able to build up additional reserves when they were needed.<ref name=werner2016>Werner, 2016</ref> Many economists and bankers now realize that the amount of money in circulation is limited only by the demand for loans, not by reserve requirements.<ref>Benes and Kumhof, 2012; Kumhof and Jakab, 2016; McLeay, Radia, and Thomas, 2014</ref>\n\nWhen a bank issues a loan of $1000 to a customer, they debit the customer's loan account with $1000 and at the same time they credit the customer's deposit account with $1000, ready for using. The bank now has a new asset of $1000 and a new liability of $1000. The bank's accounts are still in balance because the assets and liabilities are increased by the same amount. The bank's balance sheet is simply expanded with the amount of $1000. The bank does not take the $1000 out of its reserves. The $1000 are new circulating money that did not exist prior to the transaction.<ref>Kumhof and Jakab, 2016</ref>\n\nA study of banking software demonstrates that the bank does nothing else than adding an amount to the two accounts when they issue a loan.<ref name=werner2016 /> The observation that there appears to be no limit to the amount of credit money that banks can bring into circulation in this way has given rise to the often-heard expression that ''\"Banks are creating money out of thin air\"''.<ref name=\"SP2013\" />\n\nThe amount of money that is created in this way when a loan is issued is equal to the [[Bond (finance)#Principal|principal]] of the loan, but the money needed for paying the [[compound interest]] of the loan has not been created. As a consequence of this process, the amount of [[debt]] in the world exceeds the total money supply. Critics of the current banking system are calling for [[monetary reform]] for this reason.\n\nThe [[credit theory of money]], initiated by [[Joseph Schumpeter]], asserts the central role of banks as creators and allocators of the money supply, and distinguishes between \"productive credit creation\" (allowing non-inflationary [[economic growth]] even at [[full employment]], in the presence of [[technological progress]]) and \"unproductive credit creation\" (resulting in [[inflation]] of either the [[consumer price inflation|consumer-]] or [[asset price inflation|asset-price]] variety).<ref>Schumpeter (1996)</ref>\n\nThe model of bank lending stimulated through central-bank operations (such as \"monetary easing\") has been rejected by [[Neo-Keynesian economics|Neo-Keynesian]]<ref group=note>\"By increasing the volume of their government securities and loans and by lowering Member Bank legal reserve requirements, the Reserve Banks can encourage an increase in the supply of money and bank deposits. Without taking drastic action, [[pushing on a string|they can encourage but they cannot compel]]. For in the middle of a deep depression just when we want Reserve policy to be most effective, the Member Banks are likely to be timid about buying new investments or making loans. If the Reserve authorities buy government bonds in the open market and thereby swell bank reserves, the banks will not put these funds to work but will simply hold reserves.\" Samuelson (1997)</ref>\nand [[Post-Keynesian economics|Post-Keynesian]] analysis<ref name=kelton>Kelton (1998)</ref><ref name=\"mitch=2009\" /> as well as central banks.<ref>Tucker (2007)</ref><ref name=Disyatat>Disyatat (2010)</ref><ref group=note>\"In reality, neither are [bank] reserves a binding constraint on lending, nor does the central bank fix the amount of reserves that are available. ... Banks first decide how much to lend depending on the profitable lending opportunities available to them \u2014 which will, crucially, depend on the interest rate set by the [central bank].\" McLeay et al. (2014)</ref>\nThe major argument offered by dissident analysis is that any bank balance-sheet expansion (e.g. through a new loan) that leaves the bank short of the required reserves may affect the return it can expect on the loan, because of the extra cost the bank will undertake to return within the ratios limits \u2013 but this does not and  \"will never impede the bank's capacity to give the loan in the first place.\" Banks first lend and ''then'' cover their reserve ratios: The decision whether or not to lend is generally independent of their  reserves with the central bank or their deposits from customers; banks are not lending out deposits or reserves, anyway. Banks lend on the basis of lending criteria, such as the status of the customer's business, the loan's prospects, and/or the overall economic situation.<ref>Wray (2000)</ref>\n\n==Physical currency==\nThe central bank, or other competent, state authorities (such as the Treasury), are typically empowered to create new, physical currency, i.e. paper notes and coins, in order to meet the needs of commercial banks for cash withdrawals, and to replace worn and/or destroyed currency.<ref name=mankiw2012>Mankiw (2012)</ref> The process does not increase the money supply, as such; the term \"printing [new] money\" is considered a misnomer.<ref name=\"what\" />\n\nIn modern economies, relatively little of the supply of [[broad money]] is in physical currency. <ref group=note>For example, in December 2010, in the United States, of the $8.853 trillion broad money supply (M2, table 1), only about 10% (or $915.7 billion, table 3) consisted of coins and paper money. See [http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/20110127/ Statistic], FRS</ref>\n\n==Monetary financing ==\n{{main|Debt monetization}}\n\n===Policy===\n\"Monetary financing\", also \"debt monetization\", occurs when the country's central bank purchases government debt.<ref>Mishkin (2011)</ref> It is considered by mainstream analysis to cause [[inflation]], and often [[hyperinflation]].<ref>Elmendorf (1998)</ref> IMF's former chief economist [[Olivier Blanchard]] states that <blockquote>governments do not create money; the central bank does. But with the central bank's cooperation, the government can in effect finance itself by money creation. It can issue bonds and ask the central bank to buy them. The central bank then pays the government with money it creates, and the government in turn uses that money to finance the deficit. This process is called debt monetization.<ref>Blanchard (2012)</ref></blockquote> The description of the process differs in [[heterodox economics|heterodox]] analysis. Modern [[Chartalism|chartalists]] state: <blockquote>the central bank does not have the option to monetize any of the outstanding government debt or newly issued government debt...[A]s long as the central bank has a mandate to maintain a short-term interest rate target, the size of its purchases and sales of government debt are not discretionary. The central bank's lack of control over the quantity of reserves underscores the impossibility of debt monetization. The central bank is unable to monetize the government debt by purchasing government securities at will because to do so would cause the short-term target rate to fall to zero or to any support rate that it might have in place for excess reserves.<ref name=mitch/></blockquote>\n\n===Restrictions===\nMonetary financing used to be standard monetary policy in many countries, such as Canada or France,<ref name=ryan2015>Ryan-Collins (2015)</ref> while in others it was and still is prohibited. In the [[Eurozone]], Article 123 of the [[Lisbon Treaty]] explicitly prohibits the [[European Central Bank]] from financing public institutions and state governments.<ref>[https://www.ecb.europa.eu/mopo/eaec/fiscal/html/index.en.html Fiscal policies], ECB</ref> In Japan, the nation's [[Bank of Japan|central bank]] \"routinely\" purchases approximately 70% of state debt issued each month,<ref>Evans-Pritchard (2013)</ref> and owns, as of Oct 2018, approximately 440 [[trillion (short scale)|trillion]] [[Yen|JP\u00a5]] (approx. $4trillion)<ref group=note>At a $1=\u00a50.0094 conversion rate</ref> or over 40% of all outstanding government bonds.<ref>[https://www.boj.or.jp/en/statistics/boj/other/mei/index.htm/ Gov't Bonds], [[Bank of Japan]]</ref>\n\nIn the United States, the 1913 [[Federal Reserve Act]] allowed [[Federal Reserve System|federal]] banks to purchase short-term securities directly from the Treasury, in order to facilitate its [[cash]]-management operations. The [[Banking Act of 1935]] prohibited the central bank from directly purchasing Treasury securities, and permitted their purchase and sale only \"in the open market\". In 1942, during [[United States home front during World War II|wartime]], Congress amended the Banking Act's provisions to allow purchases of government debt by the federal banks, with the total amount they'd hold \"not [to] exceed $5 billion.\" After the war, the exemption was renewed, with time limitations, until it was allowed to expire in June 1981.<ref name=garbade>Garbade (2014)</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Money}}\n{{cols|colwidth=21em}}\n* [[Commodity money]]\n* [[Fiat money]]\n* [[Fiscal policy]]\n* [[Functional finance]]\n* [[Gold standard]]\n* [[History of banking]]\n* [[History of money]]\n* [[Monetary economics]]\n* [[Monetary reform]]\n* [[Seigniorage]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|group=note|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|15em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite web |url= https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2012/09/pdf/basics.pdf|title=What Is Money?|last= Asmundson|first= Irena |author-link=|last2= Oner|first2= Ceyda|author-link2=|author-link3= |date= September 2012|website= Finance & Development|publisher= [[IMF]]|access-date=8 March 2018 |quote= }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Benes |first1=Jaromir |last2=Kumhof |first2=Michael |title=The Chicago Plan Revisited |journal=IMF Working Paper |date=2012 |volume=202 |url=https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2016/12/31/The-Chicago-Plan-Revisited-26178}}\n*{{cite book |last= Blanchard|first= Olivier|author-link= Olivier Blanchard |last2=David R.
