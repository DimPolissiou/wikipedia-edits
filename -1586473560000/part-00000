It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof and clapboarded exterior.  Its main facade is five bays wide, with a central entrance flanked by pilasters and topped by a transom and gabled pediment.  Windows are topped by shallow projecting cornices on the ground floor, and butt against the eave on the second floor.

The elder Gilman lived in the nearby [[Gilman Garrison House]], in which his son was born.  It is one of only three gambrel-roofed houses to survive in the town from the Georgian period, and it is the least-altered of those.  The Gilmans, both father and son, were prominent in the local militia and town affairs.  Later residents included Thomas Odiorne, son-in-law of the younger Gilman, who was a successful merchant and manufacturer of equipment and parts for sailing ships.<ref name=NRHP/>\n\nMajor John Gilman held an enslaved African boy of fourteen years old, Caesar Nero Paul, in this house as a house-boy. Caesar later accompanied him to the French and Indian Wars, was captured, then returned to Exeter in 1771 and lived as a free man. Caesar married Lovey Rollins and was the father of noted Baptist minister Rev. [[Thomas Paul]] and two other ministers. His daughter Rhoda married noted black Revolutionary soldier [[Jude Hall]], and another daughter, Nancy, was the mother of black Abolitionist poet [[James Monroe Whitfield]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dixon|first=David T|date=Spring 2007|title=Freedom Earned, Equality Denied|url=|journal=Historical New Hampshire|publisher=NH Historical Society|volume=61|pages=28-47|via=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Rockingham County, New Hampshire]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gilman, John, Maj., House}}\n[[Category:Houses completed in 1738]]\n[[Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in New Hampshire]]\n[[Category:Georgian architecture in New Hampshire]]\n[[Category:Exeter, New Hampshire]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Rockingham County, New Hampshire]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox NRHP\n  | name = Maj.

{"title_page": "Alexander Home, 1st Earl of Home", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2018}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2018}}\n'''Alexander Home, 1st Earl of Home''' and 6th Lord Home (c. 1566{{snd}}5 April 1619) was a Scottish nobleman and [[Lord Warden of the Marches|Lord Warden-general of all the March]].\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early life===\nBorn about 1566, he was son of [[Alexander Home, 5th Lord Home]], by his second wife. On the death of his father in 1575 he was placed under the guardianship of Andrew Home, [[commendator of Jedburgh]]. The custody of the [[Hume Castle|castle of Home]] had been committed by the [[Regent Morton]] to the widow of the fifth baron, and on 30 November 1578 she and her husband complained that the commendator refused to deliver it up. He was ordered to do so, but in December 1579 it was arranged that the castle should be retained by Lord Home and the commendator, his tutor, in his name. In 1581 Alexander Hume of Manderston and others were ordered to restore to Home certain lands. In July of the following year Home, as warden of the east marches, received a special commission to hold justiciary courts in his district.<ref name=\"DNB\">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Home, Alexander (1566?-1619)|volume=27}}</ref>\n\nHome and his family were often opposed to the Hepburns, a rival border family whose head was the [[Earl of Bothwell]]; the feud between the Homes and the Hepburns was an old one, and it may have been the main reason why Home's father sided with the enemies of Mary during the period of her intimacy with Bothwell.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Home, Earls of|volume=13|page=625}}</ref> This enmity led to several quarrels between Home and Bothwell.\n\n===Ruthven raider===\nHome was one of those who signed the agreement which resulted in the [[Raid of Ruthven]]. In November 1583 a violent brawl occurred between him and [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell]], in the streets of Edinburgh. Both were ordered into ward, and Home was not released till 20 January 1585. For a time he was a prisoner in [[Tantallon Castle]], but in December was transferred to [[Edinburgh Castle]] by way of the Nether Bow, so that he might see exposed there the head of one of his dependents, David Hume, captain of [[Stirling Castle]].<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Opposition to the Earl of Arran===\nDespite hereditary jealousy of Bothwell, and his earlier violent quarrel with him, Home, soon after obtaining his liberty, co-operated with him in the scheme for the restoration of the banished lords and the overthrow of [[Regent Arran]]. Along with Bothwell, he fortified [[Kelso Castle]], which became the rendezvous of the insurgents. He was one of those received into favour by the king after Arran's fall. In the complaint of the kirk's commissioners to the king in 1587, he is mentioned as one of the \"Papists and idolators\" who had been promoted by the king. At the meeting of parliament in this year a quarrel occurred between Home and Lord Fleming on account of the latter being allowed by the council to vote before the other lords. Home challenged Fleming to a duel, but the combat was prevented by the citizens of Edinburgh, and the king subsequently reconciled them.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Rivalry with Bothwell===\nAfter the fall of Arran the old jealousy between Home and Bothwell broke out anew. When the king in 1589 sailed to Denmark to convoy the [[Anne of Denmark|Princess Anne]] to Scotland, they were specially charged to keep the peace towards each other. Home, however, for a time befriended Bothwell when that nobleman fell into disgrace with the king. On 7 January 1591, Home helped the [[Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox|Duke of Lennox]] attack [[John Wemyss of Logie]], on Edinburgh High Street. He was banished from court for a short period.<ref>Thomas Thomson ed., ''History of the Kirk of Scotland by David Calderwood'', vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), pp. 116-7</ref> After Bothwell, on 22 June 1591, broke ward out of Edinburgh Castle, he dined the same evening with Home in [[Leith]]; and on account of his having openly joined Bothwell, proclamation was, on 2 August, made for his pursuit. Soon afterward he went to [[Blackness Castle]], and was reported to have turned an enemy of Bothwell.<ref name=\"DNB\"/> In November 1592 Home offered his support against Bothwell and was rewarded with Priory of [[Coldingham Priory|Coldingham]]. However, he quarrelled with [[Robert Ker, 1st Earl of Roxburghe|Sir Robert Carr]] who had been given property in Kelso for showing similar support.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10, (Edinburgh, 1936), 741.</ref>\n\n===A Catholic & the Kirk===\nOn 17 November 1592 a convention of ministers sent a request to the king that he should remove Home, a professed papist, out of his company. The king consented to the appointment of a commission to inquire into such matters. On more stringent measures being threatened against the Catholics, Home, on 23 January 1593, appeared before the presbytery of Edinburgh, and, professing himself a Catholic, desired a conference. In June 1593 he assisted James Gray, brother of Patrick, master of Gray, in forcibly carrying off a young heiress, guarding the High Street with his retainers till the deed was accomplished. After Bothwell's interview with King James in [[Holyrood Palace]] in July of this year, the king, regarding himself as practically a prisoner, entered into communications with Home to aid him to escape to [[Falkland Palace]], but the king's plan was discovered, and frustrated by Bothwell. Home was made captain of the king's bodyguard, and openly expressed his contempt for Bothwell.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nMeantime, having failed to satisfy the demands of the kirk, Home was on 25 September excommunicated by the synod of Fife. He remained in close company with the king, with whom he journeyed in October to Jedburgh. On 22 December he subscribed the confession of faith at the special instance of the ministers of Edinburgh; and in May 1594 he was, on promising to adhere to Protestantism, absolved from excommunication.<ref name=\"DNB\"/> In August 1594 he wore a Turkish costume and rode in a tournament [[Masque at the baptism of Prince Henry|celebrating the baptism]] of [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Prince Henry]] at [[Stirling Castle]].\n\n===Pursuit of Bothwell===\nOn 27 March 1594 Home had received a commission to pursue Bothwell. A skirmish took place with Bothwell's men near [[Arthur's Seat]], but Home was driven back by Bothwell's infantry. At the opening of the parliament in May he accompanied the king to the [[Tolbooth]], riding on his left hand. At this parliament he was chosen a lord of the articles. After the banishment of Bothwell, his estates were divided chiefly among Home, Kerr of Cessford, and Scott of Buccleugh, Home obtaining [[Coldingham Priory]]. In May 1596 an English paper listing reasons to suspect James VI of being himself a Roman Catholic, included the appointment of known Catholics to household offices, noting [[William Schaw]] the architect, Schaw's friend [[Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline|Alexander Seton]] as President of Council, and Home as the King's body guard.<ref>''CSP. Scotland'', vol. 12, (HMSO, Edinburgh, 1952), pp.227-8</ref> Home was one of the noblemen appointed in November 1596 to assist the lords of exchequer, and he was present with the king when he was besieged in the Tolbooth during the tumult of 18 December.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n===Last years===\nIn April 1599 Home went abroad, and resigned the office of warden of the east marches, which was bestowed on Sir Alexander Home of Manderston. He and others were summoned to appear on 11 August 1600 at Falkland Palace on pain of rebellion. Home obeyed the summons. In the following year he and other nobles who had previously been Catholics were subjected to more stringent superintendence by the authorities of the kirk; but the commissioner appointed to wait on Home reported that he was out of the country. Home was one of the retinue who in 1603 accompanied King James to England on his accession to the English throne, the king on his way staying for a night at Home's castle of [[Dunglass]]. On 7 July the king constituted him lieutenant and justiciary over the three marches. He was also sworn a privy councillor of England, and on 4 March 1605 was created Earl of Home and Lord Dunglass.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nSuspected again of Roman Catholicism, Home was ordered in 1606 to confine himself in Edinburgh.

The early chemical industry in this region, however, was primarily Tyneside based and associated with the manufacture of soap and glass. The most important chemical activity in the 18th and 19th centuries was the manufacture of alkali to make soap, which was when mixed with lime and sand and used to make glass.<ref name=\"Simpson\">{{cite web|first=David|last=Simpson|publisher=David Simpson|title=Chemicals and Glass 1800AD \u2013 1900AD|url=http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/ChemicalsandGlass.html|accessdate=15 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313232948/http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/ChemicalsandGlass.html|archive-date=13 March 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>  The effects of the industrial revolution could be seen through an economy dominated by iron and steel, coal mining and shipbuilding.\n\n===Alkali manufacturing===\n[[File:Friars Goose Alkali Works Engraving.png|thumb|Friars Goose Alkali Works had the highest chimney in England to disperse hydrochloric acid fumes]]\nBefore the industrial revolution alkali was mostly used to aid the bleaching process of cloth. As the [[industrial revolution]] took hold, increasing demand for alkali came from higher production of dyestuffs, and bleach. In 1798 John Losh and the Earl of Dundonald took out a lease for a rich supply of brine pumped from a nearby coal mine, the Walker pit, becoming the supplier of raw material for The [[Losh, Wilson & Bell]] Alkali works. The works were established at Walker-on-Tyne in 1807 and bleaching powder manufacture began there in 1830, Losh Brothers soon manufactured half the soda in England. By 1814 the [[Leblanc process]] of making alkali from common salt was introduced to Britain. Alkali works using this process opened at [[Tyne Dock]] 1822, Felling shore [[Tyneside]] 1826, Friars Goose [[Gateshead]] 1828 and again on Felling Shore in 1834. Such works also produced soda, alum and Epsom salts. \nThe river frontage at South Shore of the [[River Tyne]] at Gateshead was one of the main locations for the chemical industry such that in the 19th century, which led to a cluster of iron, soap and alkali manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=ISee Gateshead|title=Chemical Works Friars Goose 1851|url=\nhttp://isee.gateshead.gov.uk/detail.php?type=related&kv=2522&t=objects|accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref> By 1828 the alkali works had a large problem controlling emissions of [[hydrochloric acid]] fumes which devastated the neighbouring countryside. One solution was to build tall chimneys to drive the fumes further away and in 1833 the tallest chimney in England was built at the Friars Goose Alkali Works.<ref name=\"Simpson\"/><ref>{{cite paper|first=I.

In 1859 [[rock salt]] deposits were discovered in Middlesbrough by [[Henry Bolckow]] and Vaughan while boring for water and led to the move  of the heavy chemical industry to Teesside. In 1860 William James established an alkali company at Cargo Fleet and in 1869 [[Samuel Sadler]] also set up a factory nearby. Sadler's works produced synthetic aniline and alzarine dyestuffs and distilled tar. The introduction of the [[Solvay Process]] to make alkali in 1872 made the Tyneside alkali industry uneconomic but it was a real boost to Teesside industry which was invigorated by the discovery of further salt deposits at Port Clarence near Seal Sands by Bell Brothers in 1874.<ref name=\"Simpson\"/> Salt extraction for human consumption had taken place at [[Seal Sands]] since Roman times through the use of panning. This continued throughout the 20th century and left caverns which are now used as liquid/gas strorage facilities for the process industry.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=Health & Safety Executive|title=Salt cavity natural gas storage \u2013 Consent and operational issues|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/gas/supply/saltcavity.htm|accessdate=5 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211150121/http://www.hse.gov.uk/gas/supply/saltcavity.htm|archive-date=11 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===The Brunner Mond Company===\nBy 1882 a number of salt works were established at Haverton Hill in 1882 by the Bell Brothers. The company became the first firm to begin large scale salt production in Teesside, and necessitated that workers were brought in from Cheshire. The salt-making interests of Bell Brothers were bought by [[Brunner Mond]] & Co of Cheshire in 1890. Brunner Mond became a giant of Teesside chemical-making in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Meanwhile, rationalization of chemical firms in 1891 left only four works on Tyneside.<ref name=\"Simpson\"/>\n\n===Chemicals at Billingham===\nThe [[Chemical Industry]] was established at [[Billingham]] in 1918 by the Government for the production of synthetic [[ammonia]], with its intended use being the manufacture of munitions during the [[Great War]].<ref>{{cite book|first= W J|last=Reader|publisher =Oxford University Press|title=Imperial Chemical industries A History Volume 1 The Forerunners 1870\u20131926|year=1970}}</ref> The 700 acre Grange Farm at Billingham was chosen for the site. However, by the time the plant opened the war was over and its manufacturing techniques outdated. It was taken over by Brunner Mond in 1920 and manufactured synthetic ammonia and fertilisers. Brunner Mond merged with other large scale chemical manufacturers in 1926 to form [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI).

Nylon 66 manufacture ceased on Teesside in 2008 with the closure of the [[Invista]] manufacturing unit.\n\n===Petrochemical production===\n[[Coke ovens]] used in the production of chemicals at Billingham were replaced in 1962 by plants using the steam [[naphtha]] process, which enabled the use of crude oil as feedstock for the process known as cracking. This proved to be a much cheaper way to produce [[ethylene]], [[Aromatic chemical compound|aromatics]], petroleum derivatives and other chemicals such as [[ammonia]]. From 1964 to 1969 four large oil refineries were erected at the mouth of the Tees, two by Phillips Petroleum and one each by ICI and Shell. Their main purpose was to supply the Billingham chemical industry.<ref name=\"Simpson\"/> A {{convert|138|mi|adj=on}} pipeline was built in 1968 for the transport of ethylene and linked chemical works on Teesside with chemical plants at Runcorn.<ref>{{cite paper|publisher=United Kingdom Onshore Pipeline Association|title=UK Ethylene System|url=http://www.ukopa.co.uk/pdfs/UKOPA-09-0016.pdf|accessdate=17 August 2013|journal=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030004705/http://www.ukopa.co.uk/pdfs/UKOPA-09-0016.pdf|archive-date=30 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Today the remaining oil refinery is operated by ConocoPhillips and two biorefineries which produce [[biodiesel]] and [[bioethanol]] as transport fuels, are operated by Ensus and Harvest Energy.

This could explain the name Se-coles Lane in London.<ref name=\"Mining in Northeast England\" /> It also led to the colloquial phrase \"[[taking coals to Newcastle]]\", meaning why take something to a place that already has an excess of it.\n\nImprovements in technology meant equipment could be built to go deeper than ever before. One example was the High Main seam at Walker Colliery on Tyneside, which became one of the deepest coal mines in the world, thanks to large engine cylinders which helped drain the mine.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Access to Mineral Heritage|title=Minerals and the Industrial Revolution:Coke to iron to mine pumps to railways|url=http://mininghistory.thehumanjourney.net/edu/IndustrialRevolution.shtml|accessdate=18 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220170833/http://mininghistory.thehumanjourney.net/edu/IndustrialRevolution.shtml|archive-date=20 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Other mining developments from this region include water level and ventilation techniques introduced by John Buddle who also helped to introduce the [[miner's safety lamp]] which was invented here by [[George Stephenson|Stephenson]] and [[Humphry Davy|Davy]].\n\n[[File:Wearmouth Colliery, miners in cage.jpg|thumb|150px|Miners in the cage ready for their descent, Monkwearmouth Colliery, 1993.]]\nSir Humphry Davy, after contemplating a communication he had received from Reverend Dr [[Robert Gray (bishop of Bristol)|Robert Gray]] Rector of [[Bishopwearmouth]] (later Bishop of Bristol) regarding the problem of gas in mines, took up the challenge of solving the problem of providing light in \"[[Firedamp|fire-damp]]\" ridden collieries. He started the work with several days of discussions with John Buddle, the overseer at Wallsend Colliery, other colliery owners and finally the Reverend John Hodgson, Vicar of Jarrow. Davy also collected samples of \"fire-damp\" before returning to his laboratory in London. Two designs of his lamps emerged and were tested at the most hazardous pits in the country, then at Newcastle-upon- Tyne and [[Whitehaven]] in [[Cumberland]], and were a resounding success. He later published his paper on \"The safety lamp for coal mines and some researches on flame\" in 1818, which made underground coal mines much more safe. George Stephenson a colliery engineer at Killingworth Main Colliery also invented a safety lamp which was successfully tested on 21 October 1815. This became known as the \"Geordie\" lamp. As a result, some in the Northeast then tried to challenge the delivery of some Ceremonial Plate to Davy but the Davy Lamper's won the day and on 25 September 1817 a dinner service as presented to Davy from the coal owners at the Queen's Head in Newcastle. Davy declined to take out a patent on his lamp design effectively giving it to the nation and the world's coal miners.<ref>{{cite book|first=Raymond|last=Lamont-Brow|publisher=Sutton|title=Humphry Davy Life Beyond the Lamp|isbn=0750932317|pages=125\u2013136|year=2004}}</ref>\n\nThe moment when the new safety lamp was first tested was recorded by John Buddle in a report from the Select Committee on Accidents in Mines on 4 September 1835 \"I first tried the lamp in an explosive mixture on the surface; and then took it to the mine; it is impossible for me to express my feelings at the time when I first suspended the lamp in the mine and saw it red hot.

The ore was discovered by geologist [[John Marley (geologist)|John Marley]] and first utilised by John Vaughan, the principal [[ironmaster]] of Middlesbrough who along with his German business partner Henry Bolckow had already established a small iron foundry and rolling mill using iron stone from Durham and the Yorkshire coast, with the new discovery prompting them to build Teesside's first blast furnace in 1851.<ref name=\"This is Middlesbrough\"/> Many more iron works followed, such as those built in the region by [[Losh, Wilson and Bell]] (see Sir Issac [[Lowthian Bell]]) who in 1853 were operating 5 furnaces in the region.[[File:Bell Ironworks at Port Clarence Teesside watercolour by John Bell (1814-1886).jpg|thumb|150px|Watercolour painting of the Bell Ironworks under construction at [[Port Clarence]], by John Bell, c. 1853]]\n\nThe success of John Vaughan and Henry Bolckow's first blast furnace meant that by 1873 Middlesbrough was producing 2 million tonnes of pig iron a year. Iron was in big demand in Britain in the late 19th century, particularly for the rapid expansion of the railways.

By 1840 there were 65 shipyards such that over 150 wooden vessels were built at Sunderland in 1850. At this time 2,025 shipwrights worked in the town and some 2,000 others were employed in related industries. Sunderland's first iron ships were built from 1852 and wooden shipbuilding ceased here in 1876. Sunderland shipbuilders included Austin and Son, William Pickersgill  and William Doxford.<ref name=\"Shipbuilding 1790 to 1899\"/>\n\nIt was between 1790 and 1805 that Thomas Haw of Stockton began building ships for the [[Napoleonic wars]].

It was the first ever seagoing screw collier and was built for John Bowes of Barnard Castle for shipping coal to London. Palmer was also famed for building the first rolled armour plates for [[warship]]s in 1854. William Smith and Co launched the 1,600-ton ''Blenheim'' in 1848. W. G. Armstrong, the famous northern engineer, acquired an interest in the Tyneside shipbuilding firm of Mitchells in 1882, and the company of [[W.G. Armstrong|W. G. Armstrong]], Mitchell and Co was formed. The yard built [[battleship]]s as well as a ship called ''Gluckauf'', which was arguably the world's first oil tanker. It was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] by the yard in 1886. Scotsman Charles Mitchell started building ships at Walker-on-Tyne in 1852 and purchased a {{convert|6.5|acre|adj=on}} site at [[Wallsend]] in 1873 to soak up excess orders from his Walker shipyard. The new yard failed financially and was handed to his brother-in-law Charles Swan. Charles and his brother Henry were directors of the Wallsend Slipway Company, a repair yard established by Mitchell in 1871. In 1878 Charles arranged a partnership with Sunderland shipbuilder George Hunter, but in 1879 Charles died after falling overboard from a channel steamer whilst returning from the Continent with his wife. Hunter went into temporary partnership with Swan's wife before becoming Managing Director in 1880. [[Swan Hunter Shipyard|Swan Hunters]] built their first steel ship at Wallsend in 1884 and their first oil tanker in 1889.\n\nMost early ships built at the Swan Hunter yard were smaller, like colliers and barges, but in 1898 it built its first [[ocean liner]], ''Ultonia,'' with a further 21 liners being built between 1898\u20131903. The most famous ship ever launched there was undoubtedly {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|2}}, a transatlantic ocean liner that launched on 20 September 1906. The ship was {{convert|790|ft|m|adj=on}} long, with a [[Beam (nautical)]] of 88&nbsp;ft (27 m) and a [[gross register tonnage]] of 31,938 tons.

West Auckland won the competition against some of Europe's biggest sides; they defeated the mighty [[Juventus]] 2-0 in the final. They even successfully defended the title the following year. The first world cup trophy played for in these tournaments, [[Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy]], has an interesting history of its own. In January 1994 the trophy, which was being held in West Auckland Working Men's Club, was stolen and never recovered. An exact replica of the original trophy was commissioned and is now held by West Auckland FC. The story of West Auckland's success was made into a film called \"A Captain's Tale\", starring actor [[Dennis Waterman]] as club captain Jones.\n\nPlayers from some of the region's minor league teams have gone on to influence football on the world stage. [[Jack Greenwell]] (John Richard Greenwell), an ex-coal miner who played non-league football for [[Crook Town A.F.C.]] from 1901 to 1912, went to Spain and played 88 games for Barcelona before becoming their manager in 1917. Mr Greenwell's achievements at Barcelona include winning five Catalan championships and two [[Copa del Rey|Copas del Rey]]. He also managed Espanyol, Mallorca and Valencia. On the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he moved to South America to manage the Peruvian and Colombian national teams; he died in 1942 in [[Bogot\u00e1]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Duncan|last=Leatherdale|newspaper=Northern Echo|title=Barcelona Jack's granddaughter returns to her roots in Crook|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/10719118.Barcelona_Jack_s_granddaughter_returns_to_her_roots_in_Crook/|date=5 October 2013|accessdate=8 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114142502/http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/10719118.Barcelona_Jack_s_granddaughter_returns_to_her_roots_in_Crook/|archive-date=14 January 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Notable footballers associated with the region====\nThere are many notable footballers from the Northeast of England.

It takes many years for areas to become deprived, suggesting that the underlying causes of area-based deprivation are long-term such as:\n\n* Major changes in the employment base, which has changed the nature and spatial distribution of jobs in the UK and within specific regions and localities.\n* The \u2018residential sorting' effects of the public and private housing markets.\nIndustrial restructuring has disproportionately affected some communities and groups. In particular:\n* Job losses in manufacturing and coalmining were most severely felt in the north of England, Scotland and Wales \u2013 and particular communities within these areas.\n* As a result of the types of jobs that were lost, some demographic groups \u2013 particularly older working age males in skilled manual work \u2013 were more likely to be affected than others.\n\nThe region's most deprived council districts, as measured by the LSOA data<ref>Communities and Local Government. ''[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/communities/pdf/576659.pdf The English Indices of deprivation 2007]''</ref> before County Durham and Northumberland became unitary authorities in 2007, are in descending order [[Easington (district)|Easington]] (7th in England), Middlesbrough (9th), Hartlepool (23rd), [[Wear Valley]] (33rd), Sunderland (35th), Newcastle upon Tyne (37th), South Tyneside (38th), Wansbeck (46th), Redcar and Cleveland (50th), Gateshead (52nd), [[Sedgefield (borough)|Sedgefield]] (54th), [[Derwentside]] (73rd), [[Blyth Valley]] (80th), and Stockton on Tees (98th).\n\nThe least deprived council districts in 2007 were, in descending order, Tynedale, [[Castle Morpeth]], [[Teesdale (district)|Teesdale]], then [[Alnwick (district)|Alnwick]].

[[York]]-based [[London North Eastern Railway]] serves the full length of the ECML and operates most of the stations on the route. [[Grand Central (train operating company)|Grand Central]] has linked Sunderland, and Teesside with London since December 2007, and is non-stop from York onwards. It does not have electric trains, and uses the [[Northallerton\u2013Eaglescliffe Line]] and Durham Coast Line. Local services along these and most other local routes in the North East are provided by [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]], based in Manchester. [[TransPennine Express]], also based in Manchester, have long-distance services from Newcastle, Scarborough and Middlesbrough to Manchester, via [[West Yorkshire]].\n\nThe [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] is a light rail network which serves the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. It has stations in Newcastle and Sunderland city centres and other towns and suburbs in the county, as well as at [[Newcastle International Airport|Newcastle Airport]] and attractions such as the [[St James' Park]], the [[Stadium of Light]], and [[Gateshead International Stadium]].\n\n=== Road ===\nThe North East's main arterial carriageway is the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 road]], which mirrors the East Coast Main Line's course.  In County Durham this road is of [[motorway]] standard and is known as the [[A1(M) motorway|A1(M)]], and in March 2018 a section of A1(M) was opened between [[Barton, North Yorkshire|Barton]] and [[Leeming Bar]] in [[North Yorkshire]] providing a continuous link to the motorway network in the rest of England. However, the A1 is still an all-purpose road in Tyne and Wear and Northumberland, and is controversially still single carriageway north of [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]], despite being the main trunk route connecting [[Edinburgh]] and Newcastle upon Tyne and having a terrible safety record.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nA second north-south dual carriageway link is provided by the [[A19 road|A19]] which heads north from [[Thirsk]] (accessed via the A168 from the A1(M) at Dishforth), serving [[Teesside]], [[Peterlee]] and [[Sunderland]] before heading through the [[Tyne Tunnel]] to meet the A1 at [[Seaton Burn]]. The Tyne Tunnel was opened as a single-carriageway in 1967, and an adjoining new tunnel was opened in February 2011.\n\nThe [[A1 (Newcastle upon Tyne)|course of the A1 through Tyne and Wear]] has changed twice during the late 20th century. Originally it passed through the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne, but in 1977 it was re-routed to the east of the city through the Tyne Tunnel. In 1993 it was rerouted again along the newly-completed Newcastle Western Bypass to the west of the city. Each of these moved resulted in many Tyneside roads being renumbered, as the A1 [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|forms the boundary]] between roads beginning with 1 and roads beginning with 6.\n\nThe [[A66 road|A66]] connects Teesside with Darlington, County Durham. The [[A68 road|A68]] takes a cross-country central route over the [[North Pennines]] and [[Cheviot Hills]] to Scotland, often following the [[Roman road]] [[Dere Street]], while the [[A69 road|A69]] heads west from Newcastle along the Tyne Valley to Hexham and then on to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] in [[Cumbria]].\n\n=== Sea ===\n[[File:Queen of Scandinavia at Newcastle.jpg|thumb|right|[[MS Princess Maria|Queen of Scandinavia]] berthed at North Shields]]\n\nThe ferry terminal at [[North Shields]] is accessed via the A187 from the Tyne Tunnel.

Middlesbrough has the region's highest rate with 7.2% persistent truants, which is the second highest rate in England after Manchester (7.3%). Next is Newcastle upon Tyne, with 6.4%, then the former district of [[Wansbeck]], with 6.3%\n\nAt [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) level, the region's performance is similar to that of other largely urban areas, although its results are generally below the national average. Middlesbrough tends to perform the worst, and to produce results well below the national average. [[Local education authority|Local education authorities]] (LEAs) in the North East have improved at GCSE in recent years. North Tyneside performed the best in 2011, followed by Gateshead, Northumberland, and Darlington. No LEA in the North-East was above the 2011 national GCSE average. South Tyneside was the lowest for the [[English Baccalaureate]], followed by Middlesbrough and Hartlepool. Gateshead and North Tyneside were the highest, and Gateshead was the only LEA above the national average for this measure.\n\nThe region's [[parochial school]]s tend to perform better at GCSE. These include [[St Thomas More Catholic School, Blaydon|St Thomas More Catholic School]] in [[Blaydon]], the selective independent state school [[Emmanuel City Technology College]] in Gateshead, [[All Saints C of E School]] in [[Ingleby Barwick]], [[English Martyrs School and Sixth Form College]] in Hartlepool, [[St Bede's Catholic School and Sixth Form College]] in [[Lanchester, County Durham]], and the [[Carmel RC Technology College]] in Darlington. Other regional schools that perform well include [[Whitley Bay High School]], Marden High School in Cullercoats, the [[Macmillan Academy]] in Middlesbrough, [[Park View School (Chester-le-Street)|Park View School]] in Chester-le Street, and the [[Hurworth School]] near Darlington. Many area schools do not have a sixth form, especially in Teesside, Sunderland and South Tyneside, but all Northumberland schools have a sixth-form along with a [[Three-tier education|three-tier system]] of education. Middlesbrough and Newcastle have the most students who pass no GCSEs.\n\n[[File:QESFC.jpg|thumb|left|[[Queen Elizabeth Sixth Form College|QE Sixth Form College]] in Darlington]]\nNorth East LEAs at A-level are improving, but produce results below those of other areas of England. Sunderland performed the best in 2011, with consistently good results, followed by Hartlepool and Darlington, which are above the national average, and unrepresentative of most areas in the North East. Darlington's [[Queen Elizabeth Sixth Form College]] is one of the highest-rated colleges in England. The area's [[Catholic school]]s all do reasonably well at A level. Stockton-on-Tees, Redcar, and Cleveland and Newcastle were also above England's average. Newcastle does significantly better at A-level than at GCSE, with consistent improvement, while Gateshead does much worse at A-level than GCSE, and produced the second lowest A-level results in the region in 2009. The worst results at A-level were from Middlesbrough, Durham, South Tyneside and Gateshead. South Tyneside had in previous years been consistently the region's worst performing LEA at A-level.\n\n[[Dame Allan's Schools]], [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle|Royal Grammar School]] (NRGS), [[Barnard Castle School]] and [[Durham School]] are all members of [[The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]]. The [[Central Newcastle High School]] and the Royal Grammar School were named as among the nation's top 100 independent schools in 2006. Durham School is considered to be one of the oldest schools in the UK, and its Old Boys were the founding members of the original [[Newcastle Falcons]] Rugby club. [[Mowden Hall School]], a selective day and boarding [[Preparatory school (UK)|prep school]] in Northumberland, is another independent school. In the region, school children from Northumberland are most likely to attend university, followed by Stockton on Tees and North Tyneside.\n\n===Further education===\nThere are sixteen further education colleges in the region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skillsnortheast.co.uk |title=North East Skills \u2013 The Skills, Trades and Expertise from Leeds to Newcastle |publisher=Skillsnortheast.co.uk |date= |accessdate=7 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525210844/http://skillsnortheast.co.uk/ |archive-date=25 May 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The main such colleges are [[East Durham College]], [[Newcastle College]], [[New College Durham]], [[Darlington College]], [[Gateshead College]], [[Bishop Auckland College]], [[Stockton Riverside College]], [[Queen Elizabeth Sixth Form College]], [[Hartlepool College of Further Education]], [[Middlesbrough College]], Cleveland College of Art and Design and [[Sunderland College]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n[[File:Old Quad, Newcastle University, 5 September 2013.jpg|alt=|thumb|Newcastle University]]\n\n===Tertiary education===\nAt the [[higher education]] level the North East contains a number of universities.

At first degree level, around 55% are from the North of England, and about 30% are from the North East. More students come from elsewhere than leave the North East for other regions. Of students native to the region, 80% study in the North of England, with [[Yorkshire and the Humber]] more popular than the [[North West England|North West]], and around 55% study in the North East. The region has a higher proportion of students from so-called low participation neighbourhoods, as compared to elsewhere in England. Durham University has the least from these neighbourhoods. Northumbria University has the most students, followed by Teesside University.\n\nAlmost 60% of graduates stay in the region, while 10% go to Yorkshire and another 10% go to London. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence}} Both areas are accessible via the [[East Coast Main Line]].\n\n==Local media==\n\n[[File:BBC Newcastle.jpg|thumb|right|[[BBC North East and Cumbria|BBC]] building in north Newcastle]]\n\nLocal media include:\n\nRegional television is provided by the [[BBC North East and Cumbria]], which broadcasts the regional evening ''[[BBC Look North (North East and Cumbria)|Look North]]'' programme from [[Spital Tongues]] in Newcastle.

These companies are members of the [[Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster]] (NEPIC). The early chemical industry in this region, however, was primarily Tyneside based and associated with the manufacture of soap and glass. The most important chemical activity in the 18th and 19th centuries was the manufacture of alkali to make soap, which was when mixed with lime and sand and used to make glass.<ref name=\"Simpson\">{{cite web|first=David|last=Simpson|publisher=David Simpson|title=Chemicals and Glass 1800AD \u2013 1900AD|url=http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/ChemicalsandGlass.html|accessdate=15 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313232948/http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/ChemicalsandGlass.html|archive-date=13 March 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>  The effects of the industrial revolution could be seen through an economy dominated by iron and steel, coal mining and shipbuilding.\n\n===Alkali manufacturing===\n[[File:Friars Goose Alkali Works Engraving.png|thumb|Friars Goose Alkali Works had the highest chimney in England to disperse hydrochloric acid fumes]]\nBefore the industrial revolution alkali was mostly used to aid the bleaching process of cloth. As the [[industrial revolution]] took hold, increasing demand for alkali came from higher production of dyestuffs, and bleach. In 1798 John Losh and the Earl of Dundonald took out a lease for a rich supply of brine pumped from a nearby coal mine, the Walker pit, becoming the supplier of raw material for The [[Losh, Wilson & Bell]] Alkali works. The works were established at Walker-on-Tyne in 1807 and bleaching powder manufacture began there in 1830, Losh Brothers soon manufactured half the soda in England. By 1814 the [[Leblanc process]] of making alkali from common salt was introduced to Britain. Alkali works using this process opened at [[Tyne Dock]] 1822, Felling shore [[Tyneside]] 1826, Friars Goose [[Gateshead]] 1828 and again on Felling Shore in 1834. Such works also produced soda, alum and Epsom salts. \nThe river frontage at South Shore of the [[River Tyne]] at Gateshead was one of the main locations for the chemical industry such that in the 19th century, which led to a cluster of iron, soap and alkali manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=ISee Gateshead|title=Chemical Works Friars Goose 1851|url=\nhttp://isee.gateshead.gov.uk/detail.php?type=related&kv=2522&t=objects|accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref> By 1828 the alkali works had a large problem controlling emissions of [[hydrochloric acid]] fumes which devastated the neighbouring countryside. One solution was to build tall chimneys to drive the fumes further away and in 1833 the tallest chimney in England was built at the Friars Goose Alkali Works.<ref name=\"Simpson\"/><ref>{{cite paper|first=I.

In 1859 [[rock salt]] deposits were discovered in Middlesbrough by [[Henry Bolckow]] and Vaughan while boring for water and led to the move  of the heavy chemical industry to Teesside. In 1860 William James established an alkali company at Cargo Fleet and in 1869 [[Samuel Sadler]] also set up a factory nearby. Sadler's works produced synthetic aniline and alzarine dyestuffs and distilled tar. The introduction of the [[Solvay Process]] to make alkali in 1872 made the Tyneside alkali industry uneconomic but it was a real boost to Teesside industry which was invigorated by the discovery of further salt deposits at Port Clarence near Seal Sands by Bell Brothers in 1874.<ref name=\"Simpson\"/> Salt extraction for human consumption had taken place at [[Seal Sands]] since Roman times through the use of panning. This continued throughout the 20th century and left caverns which are now used as liquid/gas strorage facilities for the process industry.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher=Health & Safety Executive|title=Salt cavity natural gas storage \u2013 Consent and operational issues|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/gas/supply/saltcavity.htm|accessdate=5 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211150121/http://www.hse.gov.uk/gas/supply/saltcavity.htm|archive-date=11 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===The Brunner Mond Company===\nBy 1882 a number of salt works were established at Haverton Hill in 1882 by the Bell Brothers. The company became the first firm to begin large scale salt production in Teesside, and necessitated that workers were brought in from Cheshire. The salt-making interests of Bell Brothers were bought by [[Brunner Mond]] & Co of Cheshire in 1890. Brunner Mond became a giant of Teesside chemical-making in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Meanwhile, rationalization of chemical firms in 1891 left only four works on Tyneside.<ref name=\"Simpson\"/>\n\n===Chemicals at Billingham===\nThe [[Chemical Industry]] was established at [[Billingham]] in 1918 by the Government for the production of synthetic [[ammonia]], with its intended use being the manufacture of munitions during the [[Great War]].<ref>{{cite book|first= W J|last=Reader|publisher =Oxford University Press|title=Imperial Chemical industries A History Volume 1 The Forerunners 1870\u20131926|year=1970}}</ref> The 700 acre Grange Farm at Billingham was chosen for the site. However, by the time the plant opened the war was over and its manufacturing techniques outdated. It was taken over by Brunner Mond in 1920 and manufactured synthetic ammonia and fertilisers. Brunner Mond merged with other large scale chemical manufacturers in 1926 to form [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI). In 1928 anhydrite was mined from below Billingham for use in the making of [[sulphuric acid]], a necessary component for the manufacture of [[detergents]] and [[fertilizers]].<ref name=\"Simpson\"/>\n\n===Plastics and nylon manufacture===\n\nManufacturing of plastics commenced at Billingham in 1934.<ref>{{cite book|first= W J|last=Reader|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Imperial Chemical industries A History Volume 2 The First Quarter Century 1926\u20131952|isbn=0192159445|year=1975}}</ref> This was one of the earliest sites in the world where large-scale manufacture of these materials took place. Another [[chemical plant]] was established the following year to make oil and [[petrol]] from [[creosote]] and [[coal]] by a process called [[hydrogenation]].

Further lands were purchased by ICI in 1962 at Seal Sands, where land had been reclaimed from the sea, becoming the third large-scale chemical manufacturing site on Teesside.<ref name=\"Simpson\"/> Today all three Teesside chemical sites at Billingham, Wilton, and Seal Sands remain in use for large-scale chemical manufacture by the members of the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC), and plastics and polymers continue to be manufactured there by [http://www.lottechemical.co.uk Lotte Chemicals]([[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]]), [[SABIC]]([[Polyethylene|HDPE]]), [[Victrex]]([[PEEK]]) and [[Lucite|Lucite International]]([[Perspex]]). Nylon 66 manufacture ceased on Teesside in 2008 with the closure of the [[Invista]] manufacturing unit.\n\n===Petrochemical production===\n[[Coke ovens]] used in the production of chemicals at Billingham were replaced in 1962 by plants using the steam [[naphtha]] process, which enabled the use of crude oil as feedstock for the process known as cracking. This proved to be a much cheaper way to produce [[ethylene]], [[Aromatic chemical compound|aromatics]], petroleum derivatives and other chemicals such as [[ammonia]]. From 1964 to 1969 four large oil refineries were erected at the mouth of the Tees, two by Phillips Petroleum and one each by ICI and Shell. Their main purpose was to supply the Billingham chemical industry.<ref name=\"Simpson\"/> A {{convert|138|mi|adj=on}} pipeline was built in 1968 for the transport of ethylene and linked chemical works on Teesside with chemical plants at Runcorn.<ref>{{cite paper|publisher=United Kingdom Onshore Pipeline Association|title=UK Ethylene System|url=http://www.ukopa.co.uk/pdfs/UKOPA-09-0016.pdf|accessdate=17 August 2013|journal=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030004705/http://www.ukopa.co.uk/pdfs/UKOPA-09-0016.pdf|archive-date=30 October 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Today the remaining oil refinery is operated by ConocoPhillips and two biorefineries which produce [[biodiesel]] and [[bioethanol]] as transport fuels, are operated by Ensus and Harvest Energy.

The ore was discovered by geologist [[John Marley (geologist)|John Marley]] and first utilised by John Vaughan, the principal [[ironmaster]] of Middlesbrough who along with his German business partner Henry Bolckow had already established a small iron foundry and rolling mill using iron stone from Durham and the Yorkshire coast, with the new discovery prompting them to build Teesside's first blast furnace in 1851.<ref name=\"This is Middlesbrough\"/> Many more iron works followed, such as those built in the region by [[Losh, Wilson and Bell]] (see Sir Issac [[Lowthian Bell]]) who in 1853 were operating 5 furnaces in the region.[[File:Bell Ironworks at Port Clarence Teesside watercolour by John Bell (1814-1886).jpg|thumb|150px|Watercolour painting of the Bell Ironworks under construction at [[Port Clarence]], by John Bell, c. 1853]]\n\nThe success of John Vaughan and Henry Bolckow's first blast furnace meant that by 1873 Middlesbrough was producing 2 million tonnes of pig iron a year. Iron was in big demand in Britain in the late 19th century, particularly for the rapid expansion of the railways.

Ships were built across the region, especially along [[Tyneside]] in Jarrow and [[Wearside]] in Sunderland and also in smaller ports like Blyth, [[Whitby]] and Hartlepool. Sunderland's early development was due to coal but it later transitioned to become the largest shipbuilding town in the world<ref>{{cite book|last=Brett & Clark|publisher=Black Cat Publications|title=Sunderland-the biggest shipbuilding town in the world|isbn=1899560971|date=3 November 2009}}</ref> giving the town its fame.

By 1840 there were 65 shipyards such that over 150 wooden vessels were built at Sunderland in 1850. At this time 2,025 shipwrights worked in the town and some 2,000 others were employed in related industries. Sunderland's first iron ships were built from 1852 and wooden shipbuilding ceased here in 1876. Sunderland shipbuilders included Austin and Son, William Pickersgill  and William Doxford.<ref name=\"Shipbuilding 1790 to 1899\"/>\n\nIt was between 1790 and 1805 that Thomas Haw of Stockton began building ships for the [[Napoleonic wars]]. Shipbuilding did not begin in Middlesbrough until 1833 when a wooden sailing ship called ''The Middlesbro''' was built. Teesside's first iron ship was built in Thorneby in 1854, it was a screw steamer called ''The Advance'', and Teesside's first steel ship was ''Little Lucy'' built in 1858. One famous Teesside-built ship was the {{convert|377|ft|m|adj=on}} long ''Talpore'', built by Pearse and Co of Stockton in 1860.

It was the first ever seagoing screw collier and was built for John Bowes of Barnard Castle for shipping coal to London. Palmer was also famed for building the first rolled armour plates for [[warship]]s in 1854. William Smith and Co launched the 1,600-ton ''Blenheim'' in 1848. W. G. Armstrong, the famous northern engineer, acquired an interest in the Tyneside shipbuilding firm of Mitchells in 1882, and the company of [[W.G. Armstrong|W. G. Armstrong]], Mitchell and Co was formed. The yard built [[battleship]]s as well as a ship called ''Gluckauf'', which was arguably the world's first oil tanker. It was [[Ceremonial ship launching|launched]] by the yard in 1886. Scotsman Charles Mitchell started building ships at Walker-on-Tyne in 1852 and purchased a {{convert|6.5|acre|adj=on}} site at [[Wallsend]] in 1873 to soak up excess orders from his Walker shipyard. The new yard failed financially and was handed to his brother-in-law Charles Swan. Charles and his brother Henry were directors of the Wallsend Slipway Company, a repair yard established by Mitchell in 1871. In 1878 Charles arranged a partnership with Sunderland shipbuilder George Hunter, but in 1879 Charles died after falling overboard from a channel steamer whilst returning from the Continent with his wife. Hunter went into temporary partnership with Swan's wife before becoming Managing Director in 1880. [[Swan Hunter Shipyard|Swan Hunters]] built their first steel ship at Wallsend in 1884 and their first oil tanker in 1889.\n\nMost early ships built at the Swan Hunter yard were smaller, like colliers and barges, but in 1898 it built its first [[ocean liner]], ''Ultonia,'' with a further 21 liners being built between 1898\u20131903. The most famous ship ever launched there was undoubtedly {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|2}}, a transatlantic ocean liner that launched on 20 September 1906. The ship was {{convert|790|ft|m|adj=on}} long, with a [[Beam (nautical)]] of 88&nbsp;ft (27 m) and a [[gross register tonnage]] of 31,938 tons. It carried 2,000 passengers on its [[maiden voyage]] on 16 November 1907 and won the [[Blue Riband]] for the fastest crossing of the Atlantic, a record held for 22 years.<ref name=\"Shipbuilding 1790 to 1899\"/>\n\n====Maritime innovation====\nA major pioneering innovation in marine engineering was the steam turbine, invented by [[Charles Algernon Parsons]]. He patented the first steam turbine on Tyneside in 1884. Parsons, born in Ireland in 1854, was the youngest son of the [[Earl of Rosse]] and a keen inventor, who was a junior partner in the Tyneside engineering firm of Clarke Chapman.

Early closures included Smiths Dock at [[North Shields]] in 1909, which became a ship repair yard, Armstrongs of Elswick in 1921, Richardson Duck of Stockton (1925), Priestman's of Sunderland (1933) and Palmers of Jarrow and [[Hebburn]] (1933). There were 28 North East closures in this period of which 14 were on the Tyne, 7 on the Wear, 6 on the Tees and 1 at Hartlepool. Six shipyards closed in the 1960s including W.Gray of Hartlepool (1961), Short Brothers of Sunderland (1964) and The Blyth Shipbuiding Company (1966).

Sunderland won the league championship three times in the 1890s and Newcastle United were first division champions three times in the early 1900s, reaching the FA Cup Final three times before winning it at the fourth attempt in 1910.<ref>{{cite web|first=David|last=Simpson|title=Sport in the North East 1700 to 1999|url=http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/Sport.html|accessdate=21 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209010448/http://www.englandsnortheast.co.uk/Sport.html|archive-date=9 February 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\nToday top quality professional football remains in the northeast of England. In 2017 - 18 season Newcastle United is a [[Premier League]] team, whilst Middlesbrough and Sunderland are in the [[Football League Championship]], Hartlepool and [[Gateshead FC]] compete in the [[National League (division)|National League]].  [[St James' Park]] in Newcastle, the [[Stadium of Light]] in Sunderland and [[Riverside Stadium|The Riverside Stadium]] in Middlesbrough are all first class football venues often used for international games at all levels.\n\n====First \"world cup\" winners and influential amateurs====\nAmateur and semi-professional football clubs like [[Bishop Auckland F.C.|Bishop Auckland]] and [[Blyth Spartans A.F.C.]] have had success and public attention through [[FA Cup|Football Association Cup]] runs, but the most famous achievement was by [[West Auckland Town FC]] in 1910: they were invited to take part in a competition in Italy to compete for what was then labelled the soccer World Cup. West Auckland won the competition against some of Europe's biggest sides; they defeated the mighty [[Juventus]] 2-0 in the final. They even successfully defended the title the following year. The first world cup trophy played for in these tournaments, [[Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy]], has an interesting history of its own. In January 1994 the trophy, which was being held in West Auckland Working Men's Club, was stolen and never recovered. An exact replica of the original trophy was commissioned and is now held by West Auckland FC. The story of West Auckland's success was made into a film called \"A Captain's Tale\", starring actor [[Dennis Waterman]] as club captain Jones.\n\nPlayers from some of the region's minor league teams have gone on to influence football on the world stage. [[Jack Greenwell]] (John Richard Greenwell), an ex-coal miner who played non-league football for [[Crook Town A.F.C.]] from 1901 to 1912, went to Spain and played 88 games for Barcelona before becoming their manager in 1917. Mr Greenwell's achievements at Barcelona include winning five Catalan championships and two [[Copa del Rey|Copas del Rey]]. He also managed Espanyol, Mallorca and Valencia. On the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he moved to South America to manage the Peruvian and Colombian national teams; he died in 1942 in [[Bogot\u00e1]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Duncan|last=Leatherdale|newspaper=Northern Echo|title=Barcelona Jack's granddaughter returns to her roots in Crook|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/10719118.Barcelona_Jack_s_granddaughter_returns_to_her_roots_in_Crook/|date=5 October 2013|accessdate=8 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114142502/http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/10719118.Barcelona_Jack_s_granddaughter_returns_to_her_roots_in_Crook/|archive-date=14 January 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Notable footballers associated with the region====\nThere are many notable footballers from the Northeast of England.

In May 2018 the UK Government announced that the line was to be re-nationalized for the second time since privatisation in 1997.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44142258|title=State takeover for failed rail franchise|date=16 May 2018|work=BBC News|accessdate=2 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180521153215/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44142258|archive-date=21 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Durham Coast Line]] connects Sunderland, Hartlepool and Middlesbrough with the main line. [[York]]-based [[London North Eastern Railway]] serves the full length of the ECML and operates most of the stations on the route. [[Grand Central (train operating company)|Grand Central]] has linked Sunderland, and Teesside with London since December 2007, and is non-stop from York onwards. It does not have electric trains, and uses the [[Northallerton\u2013Eaglescliffe Line]] and Durham Coast Line. Local services along these and most other local routes in the North East are provided by [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]], based in Manchester. [[TransPennine Express]], also based in Manchester, have long-distance services from Newcastle, Scarborough and Middlesbrough to Manchester, via [[West Yorkshire]].\n\nThe [[Tyne and Wear Metro]] is a light rail network which serves the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. It has stations in Newcastle and Sunderland city centres and other towns and suburbs in the county, as well as at [[Newcastle International Airport|Newcastle Airport]] and attractions such as the [[St James' Park]], the [[Stadium of Light]], and [[Gateshead International Stadium]].\n\n=== Road ===\nThe North East's main arterial carriageway is the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1 road]], which mirrors the East Coast Main Line's course.  In County Durham this road is of [[motorway]] standard and is known as the [[A1(M) motorway|A1(M)]], and in March 2018 a section of A1(M) was opened between [[Barton, North Yorkshire|Barton]] and [[Leeming Bar]] in [[North Yorkshire]] providing a continuous link to the motorway network in the rest of England. However, the A1 is still an all-purpose road in Tyne and Wear and Northumberland, and is controversially still single carriageway north of [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]], despite being the main trunk route connecting [[Edinburgh]] and Newcastle upon Tyne and having a terrible safety record.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nA second north-south dual carriageway link is provided by the [[A19 road|A19]] which heads north from [[Thirsk]] (accessed via the A168 from the A1(M) at Dishforth), serving [[Teesside]], [[Peterlee]] and [[Sunderland]] before heading through the [[Tyne Tunnel]] to meet the A1 at [[Seaton Burn]]. The Tyne Tunnel was opened as a single-carriageway in 1967, and an adjoining new tunnel was opened in February 2011.\n\nThe [[A1 (Newcastle upon Tyne)|course of the A1 through Tyne and Wear]] has changed twice during the late 20th century. Originally it passed through the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne, but in 1977 it was re-routed to the east of the city through the Tyne Tunnel. In 1993 it was rerouted again along the newly-completed Newcastle Western Bypass to the west of the city. Each of these moved resulted in many Tyneside roads being renumbered, as the A1 [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|forms the boundary]] between roads beginning with 1 and roads beginning with 6.\n\nThe [[A66 road|A66]] connects Teesside with Darlington, County Durham. The [[A68 road|A68]] takes a cross-country central route over the [[North Pennines]] and [[Cheviot Hills]] to Scotland, often following the [[Roman road]] [[Dere Street]], while the [[A69 road|A69]] heads west from Newcastle along the Tyne Valley to Hexham and then on to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] in [[Cumbria]].\n\n=== Sea ===\n[[File:Queen of Scandinavia at Newcastle.jpg|thumb|right|[[MS Princess Maria|Queen of Scandinavia]] berthed at North Shields]]\n\nThe ferry terminal at [[North Shields]] is accessed via the A187 from the Tyne Tunnel.

[[Truancy]] at its schools is a mixed picture. It has the second highest overall rate for urban areas, after [[Yorkshire and the Humber]], but the lowest rate in England in its rural areas. Middlesbrough has the region's highest rate with 7.2% persistent truants, which is the second highest rate in England after Manchester (7.3%). Next is Newcastle upon Tyne, with 6.4%, then the former district of [[Wansbeck]], with 6.3%\n\nAt [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] (GCSE) level, the region's performance is similar to that of other largely urban areas, although its results are generally below the national average. Middlesbrough tends to perform the worst, and to produce results well below the national average. [[Local education authority|Local education authorities]] (LEAs) in the North East have improved at GCSE in recent years. North Tyneside performed the best in 2011, followed by Gateshead, Northumberland, and Darlington. No LEA in the North-East was above the 2011 national GCSE average. South Tyneside was the lowest for the [[English Baccalaureate]], followed by Middlesbrough and Hartlepool. Gateshead and North Tyneside were the highest, and Gateshead was the only LEA above the national average for this measure.\n\nThe region's [[parochial school]]s tend to perform better at GCSE. These include [[St Thomas More Catholic School, Blaydon|St Thomas More Catholic School]] in [[Blaydon]], the selective independent state school [[Emmanuel City Technology College]] in Gateshead, [[All Saints C of E School]] in [[Ingleby Barwick]], [[English Martyrs School and Sixth Form College]] in Hartlepool, [[St Bede's Catholic School and Sixth Form College]] in [[Lanchester, County Durham]], and the [[Carmel RC Technology College]] in Darlington. Other regional schools that perform well include [[Whitley Bay High School]], Marden High School in Cullercoats, the [[Macmillan Academy]] in Middlesbrough, [[Park View School (Chester-le-Street)|Park View School]] in Chester-le Street, and the [[Hurworth School]] near Darlington. Many area schools do not have a sixth form, especially in Teesside, Sunderland and South Tyneside, but all Northumberland schools have a sixth-form along with a [[Three-tier education|three-tier system]] of education. Middlesbrough and Newcastle have the most students who pass no GCSEs.\n\n[[File:QESFC.jpg|thumb|left|[[Queen Elizabeth Sixth Form College|QE Sixth Form College]] in Darlington]]\nNorth East LEAs at A-level are improving, but produce results below those of other areas of England. Sunderland performed the best in 2011, with consistently good results, followed by Hartlepool and Darlington, which are above the national average, and unrepresentative of most areas in the North East. Darlington's [[Queen Elizabeth Sixth Form College]] is one of the highest-rated colleges in England. The area's [[Catholic school]]s all do reasonably well at A level. Stockton-on-Tees, Redcar, and Cleveland and Newcastle were also above England's average. Newcastle does significantly better at A-level than at GCSE, with consistent improvement, while Gateshead does much worse at A-level than GCSE, and produced the second lowest A-level results in the region in 2009. The worst results at A-level were from Middlesbrough, Durham, South Tyneside and Gateshead. South Tyneside had in previous years been consistently the region's worst performing LEA at A-level.\n\n[[Dame Allan's Schools]], [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle|Royal Grammar School]] (NRGS), [[Barnard Castle School]] and [[Durham School]] are all members of [[The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]].
