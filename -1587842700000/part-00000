{"title_page": "Yankee", "text_new": "{{about|the term}}\nThe term \"'''Yankee'''\" and its contracted form \"'''Yank'''\" have several interrelated meanings, all referring to people from the united States of America; its various senses depend on the context. Outside the united States of America, \"Yank\" is used informally to refer to any American, including Southerners. Within the [[Southern United States|Southern united States of America]] \"Yankee\" is a derisive term which refers to all Northerners, or specifically to those from the region of [[New England]]. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', it is \"a nickname for a native or inhabitant of New England, or, more widely, of the northern States generally\"; during the [[American Civil War]], it was \"applied by the Confederates to the soldiers of the Federal army\".\n\nElsewhere in the united States of America it largely refers to people from the Northeastern states, but especially those with [[New England]] cultural ties, such as descendants of [[colonial New England]] settlers, wherever they live.<ref name=\"ruth\">{{cite journal|year=1963|title=Swamp Yankee|journal=American Speech|volume=38|issue=2|pages=121\u2013123|doi=10.2307/453288|jstor=453288|author=Ruth Schell}}</ref> Its sense is sometimes more cultural than geographical, emphasizing the Calvinist Puritan Christian beliefs and traditions of the Congregationalists who brought their culture when they settled outside New England.

It is especially popular among Britons, Irish, and Australians and sometimes carries pejorative overtones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/yank_2#yank_2__3 |title=Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary Online |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>\n\n== Origin and history of the word ==\n[[File:Boston1775.jpg|thumb|350px|Loyalist newspaper cartoon from Boston ridicules \"Yankie Doodles\" militia who have encircled the British forces inside the city]]\n\n===Early usage===\nBritish General [[James Wolfe]] made the earliest recorded use of the word \"Yankee\" in 1758 when he referred to the New England soldiers under his command. \"I can afford you two companies of Yankees, and the more because they are better for ranging and scouting than either work or vigilance\".<ref name=\"Mathews\">Mathews (1951) p 1896</ref> Later British use of the word often was derogatory, as in a cartoon of 1775 ridiculing Yankee soldiers.<ref name=\"Mathews\" /> New Englanders themselves employed the word in a neutral sense; the \"[[Pennamite\u2013Yankee War]]\", for example, was a series of clashes in 1769 over land titles in Pennsylvania between settlers from [[Connecticut Colony]] and \"Pennamite\" settlers from [[History of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]].\n\nThe meaning of ''Yankee'' has varied over time. In the 18th century, it referred to residents of New England descended from the original English settlers of the region. [[Mark Twain]] used the word in this sense the following century in his novel ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'', published in 1889. As early as the 1770s, British people applied the term to any person from the United States. In the 19th century, Americans in the southern United States employed the word in reference to Americans from the northern United States, though not to recent immigrants from Europe. Thus, a visitor to [[Richmond, Virginia]] commented in 1818, \"The enterprising people are mostly strangers; Scots, Irish, and especially New England men, or Yankees, as they are called\".<ref>See Mathews, (1951) pp. 1896\u201398 and [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50288716 ''Oxford English Dictionary'', quoting M. Birkbeck]</ref>\n\n===Rejected etymologies===\nMany etymologies have been suggested for the word ''Yankee'', but modern linguists generally reject theories which suggest that it originated in any Indian languages.<ref name=\"MW\"/> This includes a theory purported by a British officer in 1789, who said that it was derived from the [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] word ''eankke'' (\"coward\")\u2014despite the fact that no such word existed in the Cherokee language.<ref name=\"MW\">''The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories'' (1991) pp. 516\u2013517.</ref> Another theory surmised that the word was borrowed from the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]]<ref>The Wyandot people were called Hurons by the French.</ref> pronunciation of the French ''l'anglais'', meaning \"the Englishman\" or \"the English language\", which was sounded as ''Y'an-gee''.<ref name=\"MW\"/><ref>Mathews (1951) p.&nbsp;1896.</ref>\n\nAmerican musicologist [[Oscar Sonneck]] debunked a romanticized false etymology in his 1909 work ''Report on \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", \"Hail Columbia\", \"America\", \"Yankee Doodle\"''. He cited a popular theory which claimed that the word came from a tribe who called themselves ''Yankoos'', said to mean \"invincible\". The story claimed that New Englanders had defeated this tribe after a bloody battle, and the remaining ''Yankoo'' Indians transferred their name to the victors\u2014who were \"agreeable to the Indian custom\". Sonneck notes that multiple American writers since 1775 had repeated this story as if it were fact, despite what he perceived to be holes in it. It had never been the tradition of any Indian tribe to transfer their name to other peoples, according to Sonneck, nor had any settlers ever adopted an Indian name to describe themselves.<ref>This is not to be confused with adopting an Indian name for a geographical location.</ref> Sonneck concludes by pointing out that there was never a tribe called the ''Yankoos''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Sonneck | first = O.

Quinion and Hanks posit that it was \"used as a nickname for a Dutch-speaking American in colonial times\" and could have grown to include non-Dutch colonists, as well.<ref name=posh/> Alternatively, the Dutch given names ''Jan'' ({{IPA-nl|j\u0251n|lang}}) and ''Kees'' ({{IPA-nl|ke\u02d0s|lang}}) have long been common, and the two are sometimes combined into a single name (e.g., [[Jan Kees de Jager]]). Its Anglicized spelling ''Yankee'' could, in this way, have been used to mock Dutch colonists. The chosen name ''Jan Kees'' may have been partly inspired by a dialectal rendition of ''Jan Kaas'' (\"John Cheese\"), the generic nickname that Southern Dutch used for Dutch people living in the North.<ref name=yanky>Harper, Douglas. ''Online Etymology Dictionary'': \"[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=yankee Yankee]\". 2013. Accessed 13 Jul 2013.</ref>\n\nThe [[Online Etymology Dictionary]] gives its origin as around 1683, when English colonists used it insultingly in reference to Dutch colonists (especially freebooters). Linguist [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] notes that there was mention of a pirate named ''[[Yankey Willems|Dutch Yanky]]'' in the 17th century.<ref>{{cite book | last = de Vries | first = Jan | year = 1971 | title = Nederlands Etymologisch Woordenboek | language = Dutch | at = Headword: yankee}}</ref> ''[[The Life and Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves]]'' (1760) contains the passage, \"Haul forward thy chair again, take thy berth, and proceed with thy story in a direct course, without yawing like a Dutch yanky.\"<ref>''The Life and Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves'', [[Tobias Smollett]]'', chapter 3</ref> According to this theory, Dutch settlers of [[New Amsterdam]] started using the term against the English colonists of neighboring Connecticut.<ref name=yanky />\n\n== Historic uses ==\n\n===Canadian usage===\nAn early use of the term outside the United States was in the creation of [[Sam Slick]] the \"Yankee Clockmaker\" in a newspaper column in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] in 1835. The character was a plain-speaking American who becomes an example for Nova Scotians to follow in his industry and practicality; and his uncouth manners and vanity were the epitome of qualities that his creator detested. The character was developed by [[Thomas Chandler Haliburton]], and it grew between 1836 and 1844 in a series of publications.<ref name = DCB>Cogswell, F.

Former Rhode Island Governor [[Bruce Sundlun]] was a pilot in World War II, and he named his [[Boeing B-17|B-17F]] bomber ''Damn Yankee'' because a crewman from North Carolina nicknamed him with that epithet.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.americanairmuseum.com/aircraft/464|title=41-24557 B-17 FLYING FORTRESS|publisher=American Air Museum in Britain|accessdate=21 Feb 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmilitariaforum.com/forums/index.php?/topic/128810-my-68th-anniversary-tribute-to-b17-f-damn-yankee|title=My 68th Anniversary Tribute to B17-F Damn Yankee|author=Johann Willaert|publisher=The US Militaria Forum|accessdate=21 Feb 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Yankee Doodle==\n{{main|Yankee Doodle}}\nA pervasive influence on the use of the term throughout the years has been the [[Yankee Doodle|song \"Yankee Doodle\"]] which was popular during the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u201383).

The original Yankees diffused widely across the northern United States, leaving their imprints in New York, the [[Upper Midwest]], and places as far away as [[Seattle]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Honolulu]].<ref>Mathews (1909), Holbrook (1950)</ref> Yankees typically lived in villages consisting of clusters of separate farms.  Often they were merchants, bankers, teachers, or professionals.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kenneth J. Winkle|title=The Young Eagle: The Rise of Abraham Lincoln|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcEVAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA78|year=2001|publisher=Taylor |page=78|isbn=9781461734369}}</ref> Village life fostered local democracy, best exemplified by the open [[town meeting]] form of government which still exists today in New England. Village life also stimulated mutual oversight of moral behavior and emphasized civic virtue. From the New England seaports of [[Boston]], [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], and [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], among others, the Yankees built international trade routes, stretching to China by 1800. Much of the profit from trading was reinvested in the textile and machine tools industries.<ref>Knights (1991)</ref>\n\n===Stereotypes===\n[[Yankee ingenuity]] was a worldwide stereotype of inventiveness, technical solutions to practical problems, \"know-how,\" self-reliance, and individual enterprise.<ref>Eugene S. Ferguson, \"On the Origin and Development of American Mechanical 'know-how'\", ''American Studies'' 3.2 (1962): 3\u201316. [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/amerstud/article/viewFile/2075/2034 online]</ref> The stereotype first appeared in the 19th century. As Mitchell Wilson notes, \"Yankee ingenuity and Yankee git-up-and-go did not exist in colonial days.\"<ref>quoted in Reynold M. Wik, \"Some interpretations of the mechanization of agriculture in the Far West.\" ''Agricultural History'' (1975): 73\u201383. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3742110 in JSTOR]</ref> The great majority of Yankees gravitated toward the burgeoning cities of the northeast, while wealthy New Englanders also sent ambassadors to frontier communities where they became influential bankers and newspaper printers. They introduced the term \"Universal Yankee Nation\" to proselytize their hopes for national and global influence.<ref>Susan E. Gray, ''The Yankee West: community life on the Michigan frontier'' (1996) p. 3</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nIn religion, New England Yankees originally followed the [[Puritan]] tradition, as expressed in [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational churches]]. Beginning in the late colonial period, many became Presbyterians, [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[American Baptist Churches USA|Baptists]], or, later, [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]]. Strait-laced 17th-century moralism as derided by novelist [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] faded in the 18th century. The [[First Great Awakening]] (under [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] and others) in the mid-18th century and the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the early 19th century (under [[Charles Grandison Finney]], among others) emphasized personal piety, revivals, and devotion to civic duty. Theologically, [[Arminianism]] replaced the original [[Calvinism]]. [[Horace Bushnell]] introduced the idea of Christian nurture, through which children would be brought to religion without revivals.\n\n===Politics and reform===\nAfter 1800, Yankees spearheaded most reform movements, including those for abolition of slavery, temperance in use of alcohol, increase in women's political rights, and improvement in women's education. [[Emma Willard]] and [[Mary Lyon]] pioneered in the higher education of women, while Yankees comprised most of the reformers who went South during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] in the late 1860s to educate the [[Freedman|Freedmen]].<ref>Taylor (1979)</ref>\n\nHistorian John Buenker has examined the worldview of the Yankee settlers in the Midwest:<blockquote>Because they arrived first and had a strong sense of community and mission, Yankees were able to transplant New England institutions, values, and mores, altered only by the conditions of frontier life.  They established a public culture that emphasized the work ethic, the sanctity of private property, individual responsibility, faith in residential and social mobility, practicality, piety, public order and decorum, reverence for public education, activists, honest, and frugal government, town meeting democracy, and he believed that there was a public interest that transcends particular and stock ambitions.  Regarding themselves as the elect and just in a world rife with sin and corruption, they felt a strong moral obligation to define and enforce standards of community and personal behavior\u2026.  This pietistic worldview was substantially shared by British, Scandinavian, Swiss, English-Canadian and Dutch Reformed immigrants, as well as by German Protestants and many of the Forty-Eighters.<ref>John Buenker, \"Wisconsin\" in {{cite book|last=James H. Madison, ed. |title=Heartland: Comparative Histories of the Midwestern States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMUCo0UXCjoC&pg=PA72|year=1988|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=72\u201373|isbn=0253314232}}</ref></blockquote>Yankees dominated New England, much of [[upstate New York]], and much of the upper Midwest, and were the strongest supporters of the new Republican party in the 1860s. This was especially true for the [[Congregationalists]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]s, and (after 1860) the Methodists among them. A study of 65 predominantly Yankee counties showed that they voted only 40% for the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] in 1848 and 1852, but became 61\u201365% [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in presidential elections of 1856 through 1864.<ref>Kleppner p 55</ref>\n\n[[Ivy League]] universities remained bastions of old Yankee culture until well after [[World War II]], particularly [[History of Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Yale University|Yale]], as well as \"[[Little Ivies|Little Ivy]]\" [[liberal arts]] colleges.\n\n===Yankee stereotypes===\nPresident [[Calvin Coolidge]] exemplified the modern Yankee stereotype. Coolidge moved from rural [[Vermont]] to urban [[Massachusetts]] and was educated at elite [[Amherst College]]. Yet his flint-faced, unprepossessing ways and terse rural speech proved politically attractive. \"That Yankee twang will be worth a hundred thousand votes\", explained one Republican leader.<ref>William Allen White, ''A Puritan in Babylon: The Story of Calvin Coolidge'' (1938) p. 122.</ref> Coolidge's laconic ways and dry humor were characteristic of stereotypical rural \"Yankee humor\" at the turn of the 20th century.<ref>Arthur George Crandall, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AhXdAf0lBqwC&pg=PA13&dq=%22new+england+joke+lore%22 ''New England Joke Lore: The Tonic of Yankee Humor''], (F.A. Davis Company, 1922).</ref>\n\n==Contemporary uses==\n\n===In the United States===\nThe term ''Yankee'' can have many different meanings within the United States that are contextually and geographically dependent. Traditionally, ''Yankee'' was most often used to refer to a New Englander descended from the original settlers of the region, thus often suggesting Puritanism and thrifty values.<ref>Bushman, (1967)</ref> By the mid-20th century, some speakers applied the word to any American inhabiting the area north of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon Line]], though usually with a specific focus still on New England.

Alabama lawyer and author Daniel Robinson Hundley in his book ''Social Relations in Our Southern States'' describes the Yankee as such: <blockquote>Yankee with all these is looked upon usually as a term of reproach --signifying a shrewd, sharp, chaffering, oily-tongued, soft-sawdering, inquisitive, money-making, money-saving, and money-worshipping individual, who hails from Down East, and who is presumed to have no where else on the Globe a permanent local habitation, however ubiquitous he may be in his travels and pursuits.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hundley|first=Daniel|url=https://docsouth.unc.edu/southlit/hundley/hundley.html|title=Social Relations in Our Southern States|publisher=|year=1860|isbn=|location=|pages=130}}</ref></blockquote>Senator [[J.

In the 18th century, it referred to residents of New England descended from the original English settlers of the region. [[Mark Twain]] used the word in this sense the following century in his novel ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'', published in 1889. As early as the 1770s, British people applied the term to any person from the United States. In the 19th century, Americans in the southern United States employed the word in reference to Americans from the northern United States, though not to recent immigrants from Europe. Thus, a visitor to [[Richmond, Virginia]] commented in 1818, \"The enterprising people are mostly strangers; Scots, Irish, and especially New England men, or Yankees, as they are called\".<ref>See Mathews, (1951) pp. 1896\u201398 and [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50288716 ''Oxford English Dictionary'', quoting M. Birkbeck]</ref>\n\n===Rejected etymologies===\nMany etymologies have been suggested for the word ''Yankee'', but modern linguists generally reject theories which suggest that it originated in any Indian languages.<ref name=\"MW\"/> This includes a theory purported by a British officer in 1789, who said that it was derived from the [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] word ''eankke'' (\"coward\")\u2014despite the fact that no such word existed in the Cherokee language.<ref name=\"MW\">''The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories'' (1991) pp. 516\u2013517.</ref> Another theory surmised that the word was borrowed from the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]]<ref>The Wyandot people were called Hurons by the French.</ref> pronunciation of the French ''l'anglais'', meaning \"the Englishman\" or \"the English language\", which was sounded as ''Y'an-gee''.<ref name=\"MW\"/><ref>Mathews (1951) p.&nbsp;1896.</ref>\n\nAmerican musicologist [[Oscar Sonneck]] debunked a romanticized false etymology in his 1909 work ''Report on \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", \"Hail Columbia\", \"America\", \"Yankee Doodle\"''. He cited a popular theory which claimed that the word came from a tribe who called themselves ''Yankoos'', said to mean \"invincible\". The story claimed that New Englanders had defeated this tribe after a bloody battle, and the remaining ''Yankoo'' Indians transferred their name to the victors\u2014who were \"agreeable to the Indian custom\". Sonneck notes that multiple American writers since 1775 had repeated this story as if it were fact, despite what he perceived to be holes in it. It had never been the tradition of any Indian tribe to transfer their name to other peoples, according to Sonneck, nor had any settlers ever adopted an Indian name to describe themselves.<ref>This is not to be confused with adopting an Indian name for a geographical location.</ref> Sonneck concludes by pointing out that there was never a tribe called the ''Yankoos''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Sonneck | first = O.

Quinion and Hanks posit that it was \"used as a nickname for a Dutch-speaking American in colonial times\" and could have grown to include non-Dutch colonists, as well.<ref name=posh/> Alternatively, the Dutch given names ''Jan'' ({{IPA-nl|j\u0251n|lang}}) and ''Kees'' ({{IPA-nl|ke\u02d0s|lang}}) have long been common, and the two are sometimes combined into a single name (e.g., [[Jan Kees de Jager]]). Its Anglicized spelling ''Yankee'' could, in this way, have been used to mock Dutch colonists. The chosen name ''Jan Kees'' may have been partly inspired by a dialectal rendition of ''Jan Kaas'' (\"John Cheese\"), the generic nickname that Southern Dutch used for Dutch people living in the North.<ref name=yanky>Harper, Douglas.

The original Yankees diffused widely across the northern United States, leaving their imprints in New York, the [[Upper Midwest]], and places as far away as [[Seattle]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Honolulu]].<ref>Mathews (1909), Holbrook (1950)</ref> Yankees typically lived in villages consisting of clusters of separate farms.  Often they were merchants, bankers, teachers, or professionals.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kenneth J. Winkle|title=The Young Eagle: The Rise of Abraham Lincoln|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcEVAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA78|year=2001|publisher=Taylor |page=78|isbn=9781461734369}}</ref> Village life fostered local democracy, best exemplified by the open [[town meeting]] form of government which still exists today in New England. Village life also stimulated mutual oversight of moral behavior and emphasized civic virtue. From the New England seaports of [[Boston]], [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], and [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], among others, the Yankees built international trade routes, stretching to China by 1800. Much of the profit from trading was reinvested in the textile and machine tools industries.<ref>Knights (1991)</ref>\n\n===Stereotypes===\n[[Yankee ingenuity]] was a worldwide stereotype of inventiveness, technical solutions to practical problems, \"know-how,\" self-reliance, and individual enterprise.<ref>Eugene S. Ferguson, \"On the Origin and Development of American Mechanical 'know-how'\", ''American Studies'' 3.2 (1962): 3\u201316. [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/amerstud/article/viewFile/2075/2034 online]</ref> The stereotype first appeared in the 19th century. As Mitchell Wilson notes, \"Yankee ingenuity and Yankee git-up-and-go did not exist in colonial days.\"<ref>quoted in Reynold M. Wik, \"Some interpretations of the mechanization of agriculture in the Far West.\" ''Agricultural History'' (1975): 73\u201383. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3742110 in JSTOR]</ref> The great majority of Yankees gravitated toward the burgeoning cities of the northeast, while wealthy New Englanders also sent ambassadors to frontier communities where they became influential bankers and newspaper printers. They introduced the term \"Universal Yankee Nation\" to proselytize their hopes for national and global influence.<ref>Susan E. Gray, ''The Yankee West: community life on the Michigan frontier'' (1996) p. 3</ref>\n\n===Religion===\nIn religion, New England Yankees originally followed the [[Puritan]] tradition, as expressed in [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational churches]]. Beginning in the late colonial period, many became Presbyterians, [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[American Baptist Churches USA|Baptists]], or, later, [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]]. Strait-laced 17th-century moralism as derided by novelist [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] faded in the 18th century. The [[First Great Awakening]] (under [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] and others) in the mid-18th century and the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the early 19th century (under [[Charles Grandison Finney]], among others) emphasized personal piety, revivals, and devotion to civic duty. Theologically, [[Arminianism]] replaced the original [[Calvinism]]. [[Horace Bushnell]] introduced the idea of Christian nurture, through which children would be brought to religion without revivals.\n\n===Politics and reform===\nAfter 1800, Yankees spearheaded most reform movements, including those for abolition of slavery, temperance in use of alcohol, increase in women's political rights, and improvement in women's education. [[Emma Willard]] and [[Mary Lyon]] pioneered in the higher education of women, while Yankees comprised most of the reformers who went South during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] in the late 1860s to educate the [[Freedman|Freedmen]].<ref>Taylor (1979)</ref>\n\nHistorian John Buenker has examined the worldview of the Yankee settlers in the Midwest:<blockquote>Because they arrived first and had a strong sense of community and mission, Yankees were able to transplant New England institutions, values, and mores, altered only by the conditions of frontier life.  They established a public culture that emphasized the work ethic, the sanctity of private property, individual responsibility, faith in residential and social mobility, practicality, piety, public order and decorum, reverence for public education, activists, honest, and frugal government, town meeting democracy, and he believed that there was a public interest that transcends particular and stock ambitions.  Regarding themselves as the elect and just in a world rife with sin and corruption, they felt a strong moral obligation to define and enforce standards of community and personal behavior\u2026.  This pietistic worldview was substantially shared by British, Scandinavian, Swiss, English-Canadian and Dutch Reformed immigrants, as well as by German Protestants and many of the Forty-Eighters.<ref>John Buenker, \"Wisconsin\" in {{cite book|last=James H. Madison, ed. |title=Heartland: Comparative Histories of the Midwestern States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMUCo0UXCjoC&pg=PA72|year=1988|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=72\u201373|isbn=0253314232}}</ref></blockquote>Yankees dominated New England, much of [[upstate New York]], and much of the upper Midwest, and were the strongest supporters of the new Republican party in the 1860s. This was especially true for the [[Congregationalists]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]s, and (after 1860) the Methodists among them. A study of 65 predominantly Yankee counties showed that they voted only 40% for the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] in 1848 and 1852, but became 61\u201365% [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in presidential elections of 1856 through 1864.<ref>Kleppner p 55</ref>\n\n[[Ivy League]] universities remained bastions of old Yankee culture until well after [[World War II]], particularly [[History of Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Yale University|Yale]], as well as \"[[Little Ivies|Little Ivy]]\" [[liberal arts]] colleges.\n\n===Yankee stereotypes===\nPresident [[Calvin Coolidge]] exemplified the modern Yankee stereotype. Coolidge moved from rural [[Vermont]] to urban [[Massachusetts]] and was educated at elite [[Amherst College]]. Yet his flint-faced, unprepossessing ways and terse rural speech proved politically attractive. \"That Yankee twang will be worth a hundred thousand votes\", explained one Republican leader.<ref>William Allen White, ''A Puritan in Babylon: The Story of Calvin Coolidge'' (1938) p. 122.</ref> Coolidge's laconic ways and dry humor were characteristic of stereotypical rural \"Yankee humor\" at the turn of the 20th century.<ref>Arthur George Crandall, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AhXdAf0lBqwC&pg=PA13&dq=%22new+england+joke+lore%22 ''New England Joke Lore: The Tonic of Yankee Humor''], (F.A. Davis Company, 1922).</ref>\n\n==Contemporary uses==\n\n===In the United States===\nThe term ''Yankee'' can have many different meanings within the United States that are contextually and geographically dependent. Traditionally, ''Yankee'' was most often used to refer to a New Englander descended from the original settlers of the region, thus often suggesting Puritanism and thrifty values.<ref>Bushman, (1967)</ref> By the mid-20th century, some speakers applied the word to any American inhabiting the area north of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon Line]], though usually with a specific focus still on New England. ''New England Yankee'' might be used to differentiate.<ref>David Lauderdale [https://web.archive.org/web/20101226172934/http://www.islandpacket.com/2010/12/23/1489118/a-white-christmas-so-close-but.html A white Christmas \u2013 so close, but yet so far]. islandpacket.com (2010-12-23)</ref> However, within New England itself, the term still refers more specifically to old-stock New Englanders of English descent.

Alabama lawyer and author Daniel Robinson Hundley in his book ''Social Relations in Our Southern States'' describes the Yankee as such: <blockquote>Yankee with all these is looked upon usually as a term of reproach --signifying a shrewd, sharp, chaffering, oily-tongued, soft-sawdering, inquisitive, money-making, money-saving, and money-worshipping individual, who hails from Down East, and who is presumed to have no where else on the Globe a permanent local habitation, however ubiquitous he may be in his travels and pursuits.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hundley|first=Daniel|url=https://docsouth.unc.edu/southlit/hundley/hundley.html|title=Social Relations in Our Southern States|publisher=|year=1860|isbn=|location=|pages=130}}</ref></blockquote>Senator [[J.

William Fulbright, The Vietnam War and the American South,\" ''The Journal of Southern History,'' vol. 60, no. 3 (Aug., 1994), p. 548.</ref> [[Ambrose Bierce]] defines the term in ''[[The Devil's Dictionary]]'' as: \"In Europe, an American. In the Northern States of our Union, a New Englander. In the Southern States the word is unknown. (See DAMNYANK.)\"\n\n[[E. B. White]] humorously draws his own distinctions:\n\n{{poemquote|To foreigners, a Yankee is an American.\nTo Americans, a Yankee is a Northerner.\nTo Northerners, a Yankee is an Easterner.\nTo Easterners, a Yankee is a New Englander.\nTo New Englanders, a Yankee is a Vermonter.\nAnd in Vermont, a Yankee is somebody who eats pie for breakfast.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/yankee/|title=Yankee|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2012-11-19|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}</ref>}}\n\nMajor League Baseball's [[New York Yankees]] acquired the name from journalists after the team moved from Baltimore in 1903, though they were officially known as the Highlanders until 1913.
