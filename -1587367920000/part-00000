The XPT is based on the [[British Rail]] designed [[InterCity 125|High Speed Train]] and entered service in April 1982.\n\n==History==\n===Development===\nImproving [[public transport]] was a major issue in the [[1976 New South Wales state election|1976 State Election]] in [[New South Wales]] and one of the commitments of the incoming [[Wran ministry (1976\u201378)|Wran Government]] was to buy new rolling stock for country rail services.\n\nIn January 1978 the [[Public Transport Commission]] invited tenders for 25 high-speed [[railcar]]s similar to the [[WAGR WCA/WCE class|Prospector railcars]] delivered by [[Commonwealth Engineering|Comeng]] to the [[Western Australian Government Railways]] in 1971. The tender allowed bidders to suggest alternative types of high-speed train. Comeng submitted a tender for a train based on the [[British Rail]] designed [[InterCity 125|High Speed Train]] which had entered service in the United Kingdom in October 1976. In August 1979, Comeng was announced as the successful bidder and although the tender had called for 100 vehicles, by the time the contract was signed in March 1980, the order was only for 30, 10 power cars and 20 carriages, enough to form four five-carriage trains with two spare power cars.<ref>\"New Trains for Country Services\" ''[[Network (periodical)|Network]]'' March 1979 page 16</ref><ref>\"NSW gives country passengers a break\" ''[[Railway Gazette International]]'' March 1979 page 210</ref><ref>\"HST begets XPT\" ''Railway Gazette International'' June 1980 pages 511/512</ref><ref name=Railmotors&XPTs>{{Cite book |last1=Cooke |first=David |title= Railmotors and XPTs |publisher=Australian Railway Historical Society NSW Division |year=1984 |isbn=0 909650 23 3}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Marsden|first1=Colin|title=HST Silver Jubilee|publisher=Ian Allan Publishing|year=2001|isbn=0 711028 47 8}}</ref><ref>\"XPT Australia's train of tomorrow\" ''[[Rail Magazine|Rail Enthusiast]]'' September 1982 pages 40-42</ref>\n\nThe High Speed Train design was significantly modified, with the power cars being {{convert|50|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} shorter, the [[Paxman Valenta]] engine downrated from {{convert|2,250|to|2,000|bhp|kW|abbr=on}}, gearing lowered for a top operating speed of {{convert|160|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, suspension modified to operate on inferior track, and air filters and the cooling system modified to cater for hotter and dustier Australian conditions.

This pattern has led to the XPT being one of the most utilised train fleets worldwide with only three significant periods of downtime in the cycle. This includes one overnight stabling in Grafton, between days 2 and 3, and two overnight stablings in Sydney, between days 4 and 5, and days 7 and 1.\n\n===Formations===\nInitially all services operated with five carriage sets.

The tender allowed bidders to suggest alternative types of high-speed train. Comeng submitted a tender for a train based on the [[British Rail]] designed [[InterCity 125|High Speed Train]] which had entered service in the United Kingdom in October 1976. In August 1979, Comeng was announced as the successful bidder and although the tender had called for 100 vehicles, by the time the contract was signed in March 1980, the order was only for 30, 10 power cars and 20 carriages, enough to form four five-carriage trains with two spare power cars.<ref>\"New Trains for Country Services\" ''[[Network (periodical)|Network]]'' March 1979 page 16</ref><ref>\"NSW gives country passengers a break\" ''[[Railway Gazette International]]'' March 1979 page 210</ref><ref>\"HST begets XPT\" ''Railway Gazette International'' June 1980 pages 511/512</ref><ref name=Railmotors&XPTs>{{Cite book |last1=Cooke |first=David |title= Railmotors and XPTs |publisher=Australian Railway Historical Society NSW Division |year=1984 |isbn=0 909650 23 3}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Marsden|first1=Colin|title=HST Silver Jubilee|publisher=Ian Allan Publishing|year=2001|isbn=0 711028 47 8}}</ref><ref>\"XPT Australia's train of tomorrow\" ''[[Rail Magazine|Rail Enthusiast]]'' September 1982 pages 40-42</ref>\n\nThe High Speed Train design was significantly modified, with the power cars being {{convert|50|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} shorter, the [[Paxman Valenta]] engine downrated from {{convert|2,250|to|2,000|bhp|kW|abbr=on}}, gearing lowered for a top operating speed of {{convert|160|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, suspension modified to operate on inferior track, and air filters and the cooling system modified to cater for hotter and dustier Australian conditions.

The other seven sets rotate on a seven-day repeating cycle as follows:<ref>\"Xtra Precise Timing: Secrets of the XPT roster\" ''Railway Digest'' April 2002 pages 20/21</ref>\n*Day 1: 07:42 Sydney to Melbourne arrives 18:30, forms 19:50 Melbourne to Sydney\n*Day 2: arrives Sydney 06:58, forms 11:41 Sydney to Grafton arrives 22:15\n*Day 3: 05:15 Grafton to Sydney arrives 15:45, forms 20:42 to Melbourne\n*Day 4: arrives in Melbourne 07:30, forms 08:30 to Sydney arrives 19:59\n*Day 5: 07:08 Sydney to Casino arrives 18:41, forms 19:30 Casino to Sydney\n*Day 6: arrives Sydney 07:01, forms 14:41 Sydney to Brisbane\n*Day 7: arrives Brisbane 04:53, forms 05:55 Brisbane to Sydney arrives 20:10\n\nBetween each duty in Sydney, trains are serviced at the [[XPT Service Centre]] south of [[Sydenham railway station, Sydney|Sydenham station]]. This pattern has led to the XPT being one of the most utilised train fleets worldwide with only three significant periods of downtime in the cycle. This includes one overnight stabling in Grafton, between days 2 and 3, and two overnight stablings in Sydney, between days 4 and 5, and days 7 and 1.\n\n===Formations===\nInitially all services operated with five carriage sets. Following the purchase of extra carriages, this was increased to seven. In 1998 each set was reduced to six carriages.<ref>\"Asian Downturn Hits CountryLink \u2013 XPTs Shed Cars\" ''Railway Digest'' June 1998 page 9</ref> In 2001 all were reduced to five carriages outside of school holiday periods.<ref>\"Countrylink News \u2013 XPTs cut to five cars & Xplorers to Broken Hill?\" ''Railway Digest'' June 2001 page 7</ref><ref>\"Here & There\" ''Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin'' issue 765 July 2001 page 273</ref> Today XPTs operate with four carriages to Dubbo (formed from the country end as XL, XBR, XF and XFH), and five (formed from the country end as XAM, XL, XBR, XF and XFH) on the North Coast and Melbourne services, with six during peak times when an extra XF is added. The Dubbo set can operate with one power car if required, with the power car turned at its destination.\n\n==Fleet==\nThe XPT fleet consists of:\n*19 XP Power cars\n*8 XAM Sleeping cars\n*9 XL First class saloon cars\n*9 XBR First class saloon/buffet cars\n*25 XF Economy class saloon cars\n*9 XFH Economy class saloon/luggage cars\n\n===Power cars===\nXPT power cars originally powered by a [[Paxman Valenta]] 12RP200L engine with a single turbocharger. These were replaced from June 2000 by [[Paxman (engines)|Paxman]] VP185 12-cylinder, diesel engines with four low-pressure turbochargers and two high-pressure turbochargers boasting {{convert|1,492|kW|hp|disp=or|abbr=in}} that had been successfully used by some [[British Rail]] [[InterCity 125|High Speed Trains]] since 1994.<ref>\"MTU looks at IC125 power\" ''[[Rail Business Intelligence]]'' issue 118 20 January 2000 page 6</ref><ref>\"Market\" ''Railway Gazette International'' April 2000 page 210</ref> Traction equipment was manufactured in England by [[Brush Traction]] of [[Loughborough]].\n\nPower cars comprise five main compartments at the platform level. At the front is the drivers' cab, followed by the clean air compartment, engine room, cooling group, and compressor room at the rear of the locomotive.\n\nThe [[State Rail Authority]] named the XP power cars after destinations that the XPT served.

In 27 August 2018, he was elected the leader of the [[centrism|centrist]] liberal [[Democratic Party of Korea]].\n\nHe was the former [[Prime Minister of South Korea]].<ref name=\"People\">{{cite web |url=http://people.nate.com/people/info/le/eh/leehaechan/ |script-title=ko:\uc774\ud574\ucc2c |publisher=[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] people |language=Korean |accessdate=22 January 2010 |title=Archived copy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222074051/http://people.nate.com/people/info/le/eh/leehaechan/ |archive-date=22 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was nominated by president [[Roh Moo-hyun]] on 8 June 2004, confirmed by the [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly]] on 29 June, and took office on 30 June. On 14 March 2006, he resigned amidst the so-called golf game scandal.\n\nHe also served as the minister of education under former president [[Kim Dae-jung]] from 1998 to 1999, presiding over controversial education reforms including revamping the college entrance process and lowering the retirement age of teachers. The first reform in particular, which at the time was summed up in the slogan that being good at one thing was enough to get into college, was criticised for allegedly lowering dramatically the scholastic competence of the so-called \"Lee Hae-chan generation\" of then-high school students.\n\nHis nomination as prime minister met some resistance due to his record as minister of education, which many consider a failure. Since taking office, however, Lee has proved an able prime minister, being described by some as the most powerful prime minister South Korea has seen.\n\nOn 1 March 2006, the Korean Railroad Workers Union and Seoul Subway Union entered a strike together.

On March 14, 2006, he resigned amidst the so-called golf game scandal.\n\nHe also served as the minister of education under former president [[Kim Dae-jung]] from 1998 to 1999, presiding over controversial education reforms including revamping the college entrance process and lowering the retirement age of teachers. The first reform in particular, which at the time was summed up in the slogan that being good at one thing was enough to get into college, was criticised for allegedly lowering dramatically the scholastic competence of the so-called \"Lee Hae-chan generation\" of then-high school students.\n\nHis nomination as prime minister met some resistance due to his record as minister of education, which many consider a failure. Since taking office, however, Lee has proved an able prime minister, being described by some as the most powerful prime minister South Korea has seen.\n\nOn March 1, 2006, the Korean Railroad Workers Union and Seoul Subway Union entered a strike together. The strike of railroad and subway at the same time proved to be a fatal blow at the nation's economic activity, especially [[Seoul]] area, where traffic heavily depend on subway, which is controlled by these two unions. Prime Minister Lee was supposed to command the situation and mediate the strike; however, he was playing golf at [[Busan]] area with local businessmen, and this caused massive distaste among Korean people against Lee for not taking care of the government and people.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Politics of South Korea]]\n*[[Roh Moo-hyun]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-par|kr}}\n{{s-bef|before=Yim Churl-soon<br>Kim Soo-han|as=Members of the Assembly<br>for Gwanak-gu}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member of the Assembly for [[Gwanak-gu|Gwanak-eul]]|years=1988\u20132008}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Kim Hui-chul]]}}\n|-\n{{s-new|constituency}}\n{{s-ttl|title=Member of the Assembly for [[Sejong City|Sejong]]|years=2012\u2013present}}\n{{s-inc}}\n|-\n{{s-off}}\n{{Succession box\n|before=[[Goh Kun]]\n|after=[[Han Myung-Sook]]\n|title=[[Prime Minister of South Korea]]\n|years=2004\u20132006\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n{{Prime Ministers of South Korea}}\n\n{{2007 South Korean presidential candidates}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lee, Hae Chan}}\n[[Category:1952 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Minjoo Party of Korea politicians]]\n[[Category:Uri Party politicians]]\n[[Category:United New Democratic Party politicians]]\n[[Category:Members of the National Assembly (South Korea)]]\n[[Category:Yi clan of Jeonju]]\n[[Category:Seoul National University alumni]]\n[[Category:People from South Chungcheong Province]]\n\n\n{{SouthKorea-politician-stub}}\n", "name_user": "GiantSnowman", "label": "safe", "comment": "date formats perMOS:DATEFORMATbyscript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Hae-chan"}

Plastic gauges have markings on the inner cylinder down to 0.25&nbsp;mm (0.0098&nbsp;in) resolution, while metal gauges require use of a stick designed with the appropriate 0.25&nbsp;mm (0.0098&nbsp;in) markings.
