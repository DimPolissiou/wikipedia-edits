While specific tax treaties exist for the region, there are still problems with administrating them.  People commuting to work over the border ({{Lang-da|gr\u00e6nseg\u00e6nger}}, {{Lang-sv|gr\u00e4nsarbetare}}) had a problem receiving information of rules affecting them and sometimes risked paying double taxes. They also risked losing the right to unemployment benefits because foreign employment did not contribute to entitlements in their home state, losing the right to kindergarten for their small children for the same reason etc. Some of these problems have been solved after the recent years of political coordination between the countries, but the local tax authorities have difficulties implementing the complex rules for cross-border taxation.<ref name=\"RP11/03\" />\n\nAn imbalance in the [[municipal]] budgets is also a problem, since the flow of commuters move mostly in one direction: from the residential side in Sweden to the labor market side in Denmark. Rules of taxation have left the Scanian municipalities with increased costs not covered by increased tax revenues from the growing commuter population mainly taxed in the country of employment.<ref name=\"RP11/03\" />\n\nA fourth problem is voting privileges; Danes living in the Swedish of the \u00d8resund Region, but working in the Danish part, lose their right to vote in general elections in Denmark even if they work in Denmark.<ref>Roijer, Frida.

Retrieved 22 November 2007.</ref> In 1997, an EU-funded EURORES project was launched in the region in order to promote a common labor market.\n\n==Problems==\nOne deterrent to closer economic integration is the lack of a single currency, as both Sweden and Denmark maintain their own currencies, the [[Danish krone]] and [[Swedish krona]], although both are accepted in some areas of the other country.\n\nAnother problem has been a lack of transparency of the rules for taxes, [[social security]], pension and [[unemployment benefits]]. While specific tax treaties exist for the region, there are still problems with administrating them.  People commuting to work over the border ({{Lang-da|gr\u00e6nseg\u00e6nger}}, {{Lang-sv|gr\u00e4nsarbetare}}) had a problem receiving information of rules affecting them and sometimes risked paying double taxes. They also risked losing the right to unemployment benefits because foreign employment did not contribute to entitlements in their home state, losing the right to kindergarten for their small children for the same reason etc. Some of these problems have been solved after the recent years of political coordination between the countries, but the local tax authorities have difficulties implementing the complex rules for cross-border taxation.<ref name=\"RP11/03\" />\n\nAn imbalance in the [[municipal]] budgets is also a problem, since the flow of commuters move mostly in one direction: from the residential side in Sweden to the labor market side in Denmark. Rules of taxation have left the Scanian municipalities with increased costs not covered by increased tax revenues from the growing commuter population mainly taxed in the country of employment.<ref name=\"RP11/03\" />\n\nA fourth problem is voting privileges; Danes living in the Swedish of the \u00d8resund Region, but working in the Danish part, lose their right to vote in general elections in Denmark even if they work in Denmark.<ref>Roijer, Frida.

A thermal generating station, the Point Aconi Generating Station is owned and operated by [[Nova Scotia Power|Nova Scotia Power Corporation]].  It opened on August 13, 1994 following four years of construction.\n\nThe Point Aconi Generating Station is situated on the shores of the [[Cabot Strait]] at the northeastern tip of [[Boularderie Island]], located approximately {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of the headland named Point Aconi and {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the headland named Table Head. Its civic address is 1800 Prince Mine Rd, Point Aconi, NS. The facility is located at the northern terminus of [[Nova Scotia Highway 162|Prince Mine Rd - Highway 162]].\n\nUnlike the nearby [[Lingan Generating Station]] which has four generating units, Point Aconi has only one.  The Point Aconi unit, however, is the largest producing unit in Nova Scotia and is also the province\u2019s newest. The facility is able to produce 165 MW and, unlike the vast majority of Canadian coal-fired power plants, uses [[Circulating Fluidized Bed]] (CFB) to reduce emissions<ref name=\"CERI Review\">{{cite book |last1=Kralovic |first1=Paul |title=North America natural gas market dynamics : global LNG, a review |date=March 2011 |publisher=Canadian Energy Research Institute |location=Calgary AL |isbn=1-896091-97-0 |page=28 |url=https://ceri.ca/assets/files/Study_123_III_Full_Report.pdf |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> of [[NOx|NO<sub>x</sub>]] and [[Sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]].\n\nPoint Aconi was the world\u2019s largest CFB plant\u2014and the first to enter commercial service in North America\u2014when it came on-line in 1993. Tokyo-based Mitsui & Co., Ltd. was the turnkey contractor for Point Aconi; Sargent & Lundy was the project\u2019s architect/engineer.\n\n==Operation==\nThe Point Aconi Generating Station has one 165 MW unit (name plate capacity 186 MW). Its boiler was supplied by Finland\u2019s Ahlstrom Pyropower. The plant burns bituminous [[coal]] and [[petroleum coke]] in a variety of blends, which is transported to the facility using [[semi-trailer truck]]s from a bulk ship unloading pier in [[Sydney Harbour (Nova Scotia)|Sydney Harbour]] near the community of [[Whitney Pier]]. The unit is a fluidized bed combustor built for NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>, control. The station has a fabric filter [[baghouse]] for particulate control. Point Aconi station is the only Nova Scotia Power Thermal plant without activated carbon injection system to control mercury emissions as it is an inherently lower emitter due to the injection of limestone into the process.<ref name=\"ESR2016\">{{cite web |title=Improving Air Quality |url=http://emerasustainability.com/2016/environment/improving-air-quality/ |website=2016 Emera Sustainability Report |publisher=Emera Inc. |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> [[Fly ash]] and [[bottom ash]] is handled dry and land-filled.<ref name=\"TECL\">{{cite book |title=Control of Mercury Emission-to-Air |date=June 2010 |publisher=Triton Environmental Consultants Ltd. for Environment Canada |page=17 |url=http://www.mercuryconvention.org/Portals/11/documents/meetings/EG1/Assessment_control_electricity_Part1b.pdf |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> The unit has one chimney {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground.<ref name=\"NPRI Detail\">{{cite web |title=Company/Facility information: Nova Scotia Power Incorporated/Point Aconi Generating Station (2017) |url=https://pollution-waste.canada.ca/national-release-inventory/archives/index.cfm?do=facility_information&lang=En&opt_npri_id=0000004000&opt_report_year=2017 |website=NPRI Data Search - Detailed Facility Information |publisher=Environment and Climate Change Canada |accessdate=10 April 2020 |date=13 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe drum-type reheat CFB boiler was designed to produce 1,207,150 lb/hr of steam (maximum continuous rating) at 1,800 psi and 1,000 F. Toshiba Corp. supplied the multicylinder, tandem-compound steam turbine-generator. The 3,600-rpm generator is totally enclosed and has a cylindrical rotor whose winding is directly cooled by hydrogen at 30 psi. The generator is rated at 217 MVA and has a power factor of 0.85.\n\nPoint Aconi\u2019s coal-handling system comprises an active 27,500-ton storage pile; an inactive storage pile of identical size; receiving hoppers, conveyors, crushing equipment; and four in-plant storage bunkers. The conveying system can handle 440 tons of coal per hour or about 550,000 tons per year. The limestone-handling system consists of receiving hoppers and conveyors common to the coal system, crushers, dryers, storage silos, and a pneumatic conveyor leading to two in-plant storage bunkers. Limestone also arrives by truck, at the rate of about 165,000 tons per year.\n\nThe in-plant ash-handling system conveys fly ash from hoppers under the baghouse, economizer, and air heater, as well as bottom ash from the combustor, to either of two silos located outside the powerhouse. Once in the silos, the ash is conditioned with water, loaded into trucks, and transported to a disposal site located next to the plant.\n\nPoint Aconi uses a once-through circulating seawater system. Seawater is drawn from {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} offshore at a depth of {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=on}} through a velocity cap intake structure. A tunnel {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the seabed connects the offshore velocity cap to the onshore pump house. The two-pass, surface-type deaerating condenser operates at 1 inch HgA.<ref name=\"Rock of Reliability\"/>\n\nThe Point Aconi Generating Station consumes 189,000 tonnes of coal and 213,000 tonnes of petroleum coke per year and currently generates approximately 6.8% of the province's electricity and produces roughly 10.07% of the province's air pollution, including [[hydrochloric acid]], [[sulphuric acid]], [[hexachlorobenzene]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]].<ref>[http://www.pollutionwatch.org/pressroom/releases/20030923.jsp \"Dirty Air from Power Plants Fuels Health Problems in Nova Scotia\" Pollution Watch]</ref> In 2007, it created 1.465 million tonnes of [[greenhouse gases]].<ref>[http://www.ec.gc.ca/pdb/ghg/onlinedata/FacilityAndGHG_e.cfm?facil=1191&year=2007 Facility and Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Environment Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20130627101320/http://www.ec.gc.ca/pdb/ghg/onlinedata/FacilityAndGHG_e.cfm?facil=1191&year=2007 |date=2013-06-27 }}</ref> In 2017 it reported 1,188,377 tonnes [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] under Nova Scotia's Cap-and Trade regulations.<ref name=\"2017gge\">{{cite book |last1=Department of Environment |title=2019 Summary of 2017 Greenhouse Gas Emissions |date=February 2019 |publisher=Province of Nova Scotia |isbn=978-1-55457-930-3 |url=https://climatechange.novascotia.ca/sites/default/files/GreenhouseGasReport_LOWRES.PDF |accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Seaboard Generating Station]] opened in [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]] in 1931 by [[Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation]] and was the sole supplier of electricity for the [[Industrial Cape Breton]] region until its purchase by Nova Scotia Power in 1966 as part of DOSCO's ongoing asset liquidation. Nova Scotia Power opened the province's largest generating station, the [[Lingan Generating Station]], at the height of the [[1979 energy crisis]] to take advantage of relatively cheap Cape Breton coal being produced by the [[Cape Breton Development Corporation]] (DEVCO).\n\nThe idea of replacing the aging Seaboard Generating Station was discussed during the 1980s and was an important promise by the incumbent [[Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia|Progressive Conservative Party]] led by Premier [[John Buchanan]] during the [[1988 Nova Scotia general election|1988 provincial election]]. After Buchanan's government was returned to power, Nova Scotia Power issued a call for proposals in October 1988 to construct a 150 megawatt CFB ([[Circulating Fluidized Bed]]) coal-fired electrical generating station in Point Aconi.\n\nSignificant controversy dogged Buchanan's election promise to build a new generating station as the [[Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board|Public Utility Board]] had authority to decide on all applications by Nova Scotia Power to construct new generating stations as well as associated rate increases. The PUB began to conduct hearings into the project in spring 1989 and stated that an economic analysis of Buchanan's election promise (the $500 million Point Aconi Generating Station) was not required as the province's generating needs were met by current sources. Coincidentally, Nova Scotia Power had also promised to purchase 30 megawatts annually from small independent power producers in the province beginning in 1990, however this agreement was abolished after the Small Private Power Association of Nova Scotia intervened at the PUB hearings to block the proposed Point Aconi Generating Station. On April 27, 1989, Buchanan introduced a controversial amendment to the ''Public Utilities Act'', which would remove the requirement for Nova Scotia Power to submit proposals for new generating station to the PUB. Hearings into the Point Aconi project were cancelled after the amendment to the ''Public Utilities Act'' receiving [[Royal Assent]] in early June 1989.<ref>\"Buchanan short-circuits N.S. utilities board with power plant bill.\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Thursday, April 27, 1989</ref>\n\n====Request for Proposals====\nIn early January 1990, Nova Scotia Power announced that the [[Japan]]ese industrial conglomerate [[Mitsui]] had won the Request for Proposals (RFP) that had been issued in fall 1988 and a contract was signed on behalf of the Government of Nova Scotia. The proposal detailed a [[turnkey]] project designed by Mitsui with the CFB steam boiler supplied by Pyro-Power through Kamtech Services (a subsidiary of [[Lauren Engineers & Constructors]] of Abilene, Texas), project management and engineering by Chicago-based [[Sargent & Lundy LLC]], and construction of the plant itself by Jones Power Corporation.\n\n====Public hearings====\nTwo weeks later, the provincial government announced that its Environmental Control Council would conduct a one-day hearing into the project on January 18, 1990 in place of the PUB hearings conducted the previous spring which were aborted as a result of the amendment to the ''Public Utilities Act''. The hearing received submissions from citizens and organizations that were strongly opposed to the Point Aconi Generating Station, pointing out the environmental impact, that its generating capacity wasn't required, and that it was a political mega-project that would add to the financial debt of the publicly owned Nova Scotia Power Corporation.\n\nOther submissions from citizens and organizations were supportive of the project, which they claimed would create an estimated 500 construction and operating jobs, as well as theoretically guarantee work in Cape Breton's coal mines; the [[United Mine Workers of America]] Local 26 had lobbied hard for the power plant. [[Richie Mann]], the environment critic for the official opposition [[Nova Scotia Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] asked at the one-day hearing, \"Can you give us some evidence that this process is not an exercise in public relations, a sham?\"<ref>Kevin Cox \"Panel asked to show evidence power plant hearing not 'sham'.\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Friday, January 19, 1990</ref>\n\nOn Friday, March 9, 1990 the provincial government announced its approval of the estimated $436 million project, even though it had already signed a contract with Mitsui two months earlier. Nova Scotia's Environment Minister [[John Leefe]] defended the projected 1.5 million tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]] emissions, stating \"[The project will be] absolutely inconsequential in terms of global carbon dioxide production.\"<ref>Kevin Cox \"Nova Scotia to construct a coal-fired power plant\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]] Saturday, March 10, 1990</ref>\n\nNova Scotia Power pointed out the environmental benefits of the Point Aconi project, stating that the use of CFB technology whereby [[limestone]] would be used to filter out [[sulphur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) and [[nitrogen oxide]] (NO<sub>x</sub>) which were major contributors to [[acid rain]]. Minister Leefe stated that Nova Scotia Power intended to reduce SO<sub>2</sub> emissions from its generating stations to 100,000 tonnes a year by 2010 from the 1990 level of 160,000 tonnes. Minister Leefe also noted that while the use of CFB technology would reduce acid rain, it would also result in a comparatively massive increase in [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions which was a [[greenhouse gas]]; Leefe told reporters that Nova Scotia's coal-fired plants contributed 32 per cent of the 18 million tonnes per year of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by the province (as of 1990).\n\nThe projected increase in Nova Scotia's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as a result of the Point Aconi Generating Station (an estimated additional 1.5 million tonnes per year) went against a recent (1990) decision by federal and provincial energy ministers to reduce emissions of the gas by at least 20 per cent by 2005.<ref>Kevin Cox \"Nova Scotia to construct a coal-fired power plant\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]] Saturday, March 10, 1990</ref>\n\nThe debate over construction of the Point Aconi Generating Station took place in the shadow of a much larger global debate over [[acid rain]] and its contributing factors, such as fossil fueled generating stations. The acid rain controversy resulted in the ''Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement'' which was signed by both countries on March 13, 1991 and stipulated that both countries would agree to reduce emissions of [[sulphur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) and [[nitrogen oxide]] (NO<sub>x</sub>).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/cleanair-airpur/default.asp?lang=En&n=83930AC3-1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.bac-lac.gc.ca:8080/wayback/20071214101007/http://www.ec.gc.ca/cleanair-airpur/default.asp?lang=en&n=83930ac3-1 |archivedate=2007-12-14 }} Canada-United States Clean Air Agreement - Environment Canada</ref>\n\n====Full Federal Environmental Review rejected====\nOn September 20, 1990, federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans [[Bernard Valcourt]] rejected a full environmental review of the project, arguing that any problems to the environment would be relatively minor. Valcourt justified this decision by referring to a scientific report on the project conducted by the [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada|Department of Fisheries and Oceans]] which stated that use of CFB technology could be mitigated. It noted, however, the widespread concern of local residents over the effect of the generating station's draw on [[ground water]] supplies (CFB requires large amounts of fresh water) as well as ash discharge and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The DFO scientists noted widespread mistrust of the provincial government's decision and that the controversial one-day hearing in January left the impression \"of a cooked-up deal between the province and federal government to slip this project by without a fair assessment of its potential dangers. In fact, problems are relatively minor... Point Aconi is in some respects a model.\"<ref>Kevin Cox \"Ottawa rejects full review of power station's effects.\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]] Friday, September 21, 1990</ref>\n\nOn December 13, 1990, lawyers for Greenpeace, the [[Ecology Action Centre]] and six property owners who live near Point Aconi argued in the [[Federal Court of Canada]] that Valcourt had made a legal error in rejecting a public environmental review panel and that federal Environmental Assessment Review Panel guidelines should be followed to institute a formal review of the $436 million project. Mr. Justice Andrew MacKay ruled against the application on Friday, January 18, 1991 by stating that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans acted in accordance with the law in deciding not to order a full environmental assessment of the project. MacKay noted that the project has resulted in substantial testing of ground water around the plant. He also noted that because there are no standards for CO<sub>2</sub>, it was impossible to say that the plant would create a pollution problem with its massive CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.<ref>Special to the Globe and Mail \"Lawyer contends minister erred in coal plant ruling\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]] Friday, December 13, 1990</ref>\n\nA citizens liaison committee was established by Nova Scotia Power to review the project. Current (2010) Member of Parliament for [[Sydney\u2014Victoria]], [[Mark Eyking]] whose family operated several farms on [[Boularderie Island]] near Point Aconi was a member of this committee at that time and had questions about how emissions from the plant or ground water withdrawn for it would affect his crops or how losses would be compensated, stating, \"We see all these little mistakes happening and we know we're going to get dumped on. But when we ask for a neutral party to look at this, Nova Scotia power brings in its big shooters and they knock us down like pegs. Now it's almost too late but people won't sit down and take this any more.\"<ref>Kevin Cox \"Power but no glory in Point Aconi\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]] Saturday, March 16, 1991</ref>\n\nIn addition to the estimated $436 million cost for the generating station, the project also included construction of a $150 million transmission line running for {{convert|435|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Point Aconi to [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]]. Several property owners along the proposed route rejected offers by Nova Scotia Power to purchase their land, citing the physiological effects of the [[electromagnetic field]] from transmission lines. Additional controversy occurred when it was determined that the proposed route would disturb a [[great blue heron]] colony, which brought angry responses from members of the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq Nation]].<ref>Kevin Cox \"Power plant ruffles more than feathers\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]] Saturday, July 6, 1991</ref>\n\nMitsui formed Mitsui & Co. (Point Aconi) Ltd. as an extraprovincial corporation in another province on December 1, 1989 as a result of its RFP submission. Mitsui & Co. (Point Aconi) Ltd. was registered in Nova Scotia on February 12, 1990 after the contract was signed with Nova Scotia Power in early January.\n\n[[File:Point Aconi Generating Station 4.jpg|thumb|Point Aconi Generating Station seen from the waters of the Cabot Strait|left|450px]]\n==Construction==\nConstruction of the Point Aconi Generating Station began in early 1990 after Mitsui & Co. (Point Aconi) Ltd. contracted with Jones Power Corporation to act as construction manager and carry out construction work for the Point Aconi Generating Station project. Jones Power Corporation's obligations were guaranteed by its subsidiary [[J.A. Jones Construction]].<ref>https://rjsc.gov.ns.ca Nova Scotia Registry of Joint Stock</ref>\n\nThe Point Aconi Generating Station project ran into delays as a result of cost overruns, resulting in a series of prolonged contractual disputes that arose between 1991 and 1992. Jones Power Corporation claimed millions of dollars in additional compensation and a July 28, 1992 memorandum of understanding between Mitsui & Co. (Point Aconi) Ltd. and Jones Power Co. fixed compensation for Jones Power Corporation at $118 million. The companies agreed to complete the project on November 5, 1992 and leave the contractual dispute after the project's conclusion.

The Prince Colliery was owned by the federal Crown corporation [[Cape Breton Development Corporation]] (DEVCO) which was beset with production problems at its three remaining collieries during the mid-late 1990s as a result of flooding, roof collapses and labour difficulties. The instability of locally mined coal forced Nova Scotia Power to import coal from the [[United States]] and [[South America]] beginning in 1998 to supplement the supply from DEVCO.<ref>[http://www.littletechshoppe.com/ns1625/nshist40.html \"NSP to Import More U.S. Coal: Coal Shortage Shuts Down Generating Plant\" ''Cape Breton Post'' October 23, 1998, taken from ''History of Nova Scotia with special attention given to Communications and Transportation'', Chapter 40, September-October 1998]</ref>\n\n==Imported coal==\nFrom 1998 to 2000, Nova Scotia Power brought imported coal into Nova Scotia at the [[Martin Marietta|Martin Marietta Materials]] aggregate loading facility in [[Auld's Cove, Nova Scotia|Auld's Cove]] on the [[Strait of Canso]].

A thermal generating station, the Point Aconi Generating Station is owned and operated by [[Nova Scotia Power|Nova Scotia Power Corporation]].  It opened on August 13, 1994 following four years of construction.\n\nThe Point Aconi Generating Station is situated on the shores of the [[Cabot Strait]] at the northeastern tip of [[Boularderie Island]], located approximately {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of the headland named Point Aconi and {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the headland named Table Head. Its civic address is 1800 Prince Mine Rd, Point Aconi, NS. The facility is located at the northern terminus of [[Nova Scotia Highway 162|Prince Mine Rd - Highway 162]].\n\nUnlike the nearby [[Lingan Generating Station]] which has four generating units, Point Aconi has only one.  The Point Aconi unit, however, is the largest producing unit in Nova Scotia and is also the province\u2019s newest. The facility is able to produce 165 MW and, unlike the vast majority of Canadian coal-fired power plants, uses [[Circulating Fluidized Bed]] (CFB) to reduce emissions<ref name=\"CERI Review\">{{cite book |last1=Kralovic |first1=Paul |title=North America natural gas market dynamics : global LNG, a review |date=March 2011 |publisher=Canadian Energy Research Institute |location=Calgary AL |isbn=1-896091-97-0 |page=28 |url=https://ceri.ca/assets/files/Study_123_III_Full_Report.pdf |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> of [[NOx|NO<sub>x</sub>]] and [[Sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]].\n\nPoint Aconi was the world\u2019s largest CFB plant\u2014and the first to enter commercial service in North America\u2014when it came on-line in 1993.

Its boiler was supplied by Finland\u2019s Ahlstrom Pyropower. The plant burns bituminous [[coal]] and [[petroleum coke]] in a variety of blends, which is transported to the facility using [[semi-trailer truck]]s from a bulk ship unloading pier in [[Sydney Harbour (Nova Scotia)|Sydney Harbour]] near the community of [[Whitney Pier]]. The unit is a fluidized bed combustor built for NO<sub>x</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>, control. The station has a fabric filter [[baghouse]] for particulate control. Point Aconi station is the only Nova Scotia Power Thermal plant without activated carbon injection system to control mercury emissions as it is an inherently lower emitter due to the injection of limestone into the process.<ref name=\"ESR2016\">{{cite web |title=Improving Air Quality |url=http://emerasustainability.com/2016/environment/improving-air-quality/ |website=2016 Emera Sustainability Report |publisher=Emera Inc. |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> [[Fly ash]] and [[bottom ash]] is handled dry and land-filled.<ref name=\"TECL\">{{cite book |title=Control of Mercury Emission-to-Air |date=June 2010 |publisher=Triton Environmental Consultants Ltd. for Environment Canada |page=17 |url=http://www.mercuryconvention.org/Portals/11/documents/meetings/EG1/Assessment_control_electricity_Part1b.pdf |accessdate=9 April 2020}}</ref> The unit has one chimney {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} above ground.<ref name=\"NPRI Detail\">{{cite web |title=Company/Facility information: Nova Scotia Power Incorporated/Point Aconi Generating Station (2017) |url=https://pollution-waste.canada.ca/national-release-inventory/archives/index.cfm?do=facility_information&lang=En&opt_npri_id=0000004000&opt_report_year=2017 |website=NPRI Data Search - Detailed Facility Information |publisher=Environment and Climate Change Canada |accessdate=10 April 2020 |date=13 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe drum-type reheat CFB boiler was designed to produce 1,207,150 lb/hr of steam (maximum continuous rating) at 1,800 psi and 1,000 F. Toshiba Corp. supplied the multicylinder, tandem-compound steam turbine-generator. The 3,600-rpm generator is totally enclosed and has a cylindrical rotor whose winding is directly cooled by hydrogen at 30 psi. The generator is rated at 217 MVA and has a power factor of 0.85.\n\nPoint Aconi\u2019s coal-handling system comprises an active 27,500-ton storage pile; an inactive storage pile of identical size; receiving hoppers, conveyors, crushing equipment; and four in-plant storage bunkers. The conveying system can handle 440 tons of coal per hour or about 550,000 tons per year. The limestone-handling system consists of receiving hoppers and conveyors common to the coal system, crushers, dryers, storage silos, and a pneumatic conveyor leading to two in-plant storage bunkers. Limestone also arrives by truck, at the rate of about 165,000 tons per year.\n\nThe in-plant ash-handling system conveys fly ash from hoppers under the baghouse, economizer, and air heater, as well as bottom ash from the combustor, to either of two silos located outside the powerhouse. Once in the silos, the ash is conditioned with water, loaded into trucks, and transported to a disposal site located next to the plant.\n\nPoint Aconi uses a once-through circulating seawater system. Seawater is drawn from {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} offshore at a depth of {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=on}} through a velocity cap intake structure. A tunnel {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the seabed connects the offshore velocity cap to the onshore pump house.

Nova Scotia Power opened the province's largest generating station, the [[Lingan Generating Station]], at the height of the [[1979 energy crisis]] to take advantage of relatively cheap Cape Breton coal being produced by the [[Cape Breton Development Corporation]] (DEVCO).\n\nThe idea of replacing the aging Seaboard Generating Station was discussed during the 1980s and was an important promise by the incumbent [[Progressive Conservative Association of Nova Scotia|Progressive Conservative Party]] led by Premier [[John Buchanan]] during the [[1988 Nova Scotia general election|1988 provincial election]]. After Buchanan's government was returned to power, Nova Scotia Power issued a call for proposals in October 1988 to construct a 150 megawatt CFB ([[Circulating Fluidized Bed]]) coal-fired electrical generating station in Point Aconi.\n\nSignificant controversy dogged Buchanan's election promise to build a new generating station as the [[Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board|Public Utility Board]] had authority to decide on all applications by Nova Scotia Power to construct new generating stations as well as associated rate increases. The PUB began to conduct hearings into the project in spring 1989 and stated that an economic analysis of Buchanan's election promise (the $500 million Point Aconi Generating Station) was not required as the province's generating needs were met by current sources. Coincidentally, Nova Scotia Power had also promised to purchase 30 megawatts annually from small independent power producers in the province beginning in 1990, however this agreement was abolished after the Small Private Power Association of Nova Scotia intervened at the PUB hearings to block the proposed Point Aconi Generating Station. On April 27, 1989, Buchanan introduced a controversial amendment to the ''Public Utilities Act'', which would remove the requirement for Nova Scotia Power to submit proposals for new generating station to the PUB. Hearings into the Point Aconi project were cancelled after the amendment to the ''Public Utilities Act'' receiving [[Royal Assent]] in early June 1989.<ref>\"Buchanan short-circuits N.S. utilities board with power plant bill.\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Thursday, April 27, 1989</ref>\n\n====Request for Proposals====\nIn early January 1990, Nova Scotia Power announced that the [[Japan]]ese industrial conglomerate [[Mitsui]] had won the Request for Proposals (RFP) that had been issued in fall 1988 and a contract was signed on behalf of the Government of Nova Scotia. The proposal detailed a [[turnkey]] project designed by Mitsui with the CFB steam boiler supplied by Pyro-Power through Kamtech Services (a subsidiary of [[Lauren Engineers & Constructors]] of Abilene, Texas), project management and engineering by Chicago-based [[Sargent & Lundy LLC]], and construction of the plant itself by Jones Power Corporation.\n\n====Public hearings====\nTwo weeks later, the provincial government announced that its Environmental Control Council would conduct a one-day hearing into the project on January 18, 1990 in place of the PUB hearings conducted the previous spring which were aborted as a result of the amendment to the ''Public Utilities Act''. The hearing received submissions from citizens and organizations that were strongly opposed to the Point Aconi Generating Station, pointing out the environmental impact, that its generating capacity wasn't required, and that it was a political mega-project that would add to the financial debt of the publicly owned Nova Scotia Power Corporation.\n\nOther submissions from citizens and organizations were supportive of the project, which they claimed would create an estimated 500 construction and operating jobs, as well as theoretically guarantee work in Cape Breton's coal mines; the [[United Mine Workers of America]] Local 26 had lobbied hard for the power plant. [[Richie Mann]], the environment critic for the official opposition [[Nova Scotia Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] asked at the one-day hearing, \"Can you give us some evidence that this process is not an exercise in public relations, a sham?\"<ref>Kevin Cox \"Panel asked to show evidence power plant hearing not 'sham'.\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Friday, January 19, 1990</ref>\n\nOn Friday, March 9, 1990 the provincial government announced its approval of the estimated $436 million project, even though it had already signed a contract with Mitsui two months earlier. Nova Scotia's Environment Minister [[John Leefe]] defended the projected 1.5 million tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]] emissions, stating \"[The project will be] absolutely inconsequential in terms of global carbon dioxide production.\"<ref>Kevin Cox \"Nova Scotia to construct a coal-fired power plant\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]] Saturday, March 10, 1990</ref>\n\nNova Scotia Power pointed out the environmental benefits of the Point Aconi project, stating that the use of CFB technology whereby [[limestone]] would be used to filter out [[sulphur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) and [[nitrogen oxide]] (NO<sub>x</sub>) which were major contributors to [[acid rain]]. Minister Leefe stated that Nova Scotia Power intended to reduce SO<sub>2</sub> emissions from its generating stations to 100,000 tonnes a year by 2010 from the 1990 level of 160,000 tonnes. Minister Leefe also noted that while the use of CFB technology would reduce acid rain, it would also result in a comparatively massive increase in [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions which was a [[greenhouse gas]]; Leefe told reporters that Nova Scotia's coal-fired plants contributed 32 per cent of the 18 million tonnes per year of CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by the province (as of 1990).\n\nThe projected increase in Nova Scotia's CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as a result of the Point Aconi Generating Station (an estimated additional 1.5 million tonnes per year) went against a recent (1990) decision by federal and provincial energy ministers to reduce emissions of the gas by at least 20 per cent by 2005.<ref>Kevin Cox \"Nova Scotia to construct a coal-fired power plant\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]] Saturday, March 10, 1990</ref>\n\nThe debate over construction of the Point Aconi Generating Station took place in the shadow of a much larger global debate over [[acid rain]] and its contributing factors, such as fossil fueled generating stations. The acid rain controversy resulted in the ''Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement'' which was signed by both countries on March 13, 1991 and stipulated that both countries would agree to reduce emissions of [[sulphur dioxide]] (SO<sub>2</sub>) and [[nitrogen oxide]] (NO<sub>x</sub>).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/cleanair-airpur/default.asp?lang=En&n=83930AC3-1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.bac-lac.gc.ca:8080/wayback/20071214101007/http://www.ec.gc.ca/cleanair-airpur/default.asp?lang=en&n=83930ac3-1 |archivedate=2007-12-14 }} Canada-United States Clean Air Agreement - Environment Canada</ref>\n\n====Full Federal Environmental Review rejected====\nOn September 20, 1990, federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans [[Bernard Valcourt]] rejected a full environmental review of the project, arguing that any problems to the environment would be relatively minor. Valcourt justified this decision by referring to a scientific report on the project conducted by the [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada|Department of Fisheries and Oceans]] which stated that use of CFB technology could be mitigated. It noted, however, the widespread concern of local residents over the effect of the generating station's draw on [[ground water]] supplies (CFB requires large amounts of fresh water) as well as ash discharge and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The DFO scientists noted widespread mistrust of the provincial government's decision and that the controversial one-day hearing in January left the impression \"of a cooked-up deal between the province and federal government to slip this project by without a fair assessment of its potential dangers. In fact, problems are relatively minor... Point Aconi is in some respects a model.\"<ref>Kevin Cox \"Ottawa rejects full review of power station's effects.\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]] Friday, September 21, 1990</ref>\n\nOn December 13, 1990, lawyers for Greenpeace, the [[Ecology Action Centre]] and six property owners who live near Point Aconi argued in the [[Federal Court of Canada]] that Valcourt had made a legal error in rejecting a public environmental review panel and that federal Environmental Assessment Review Panel guidelines should be followed to institute a formal review of the $436 million project. Mr. Justice Andrew MacKay ruled against the application on Friday, January 18, 1991 by stating that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans acted in accordance with the law in deciding not to order a full environmental assessment of the project. MacKay noted that the project has resulted in substantial testing of ground water around the plant. He also noted that because there are no standards for CO<sub>2</sub>, it was impossible to say that the plant would create a pollution problem with its massive CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.<ref>Special to the Globe and Mail \"Lawyer contends minister erred in coal plant ruling\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]] Friday, December 13, 1990</ref>\n\nA citizens liaison committee was established by Nova Scotia Power to review the project. Current (2010) Member of Parliament for [[Sydney\u2014Victoria]], [[Mark Eyking]] whose family operated several farms on [[Boularderie Island]] near Point Aconi was a member of this committee at that time and had questions about how emissions from the plant or ground water withdrawn for it would affect his crops or how losses would be compensated, stating, \"We see all these little mistakes happening and we know we're going to get dumped on. But when we ask for a neutral party to look at this, Nova Scotia power brings in its big shooters and they knock us down like pegs. Now it's almost too late but people won't sit down and take this any more.\"<ref>Kevin Cox \"Power but no glory in Point Aconi\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]] Saturday, March 16, 1991</ref>\n\nIn addition to the estimated $436 million cost for the generating station, the project also included construction of a $150 million transmission line running for {{convert|435|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Point Aconi to [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]]. Several property owners along the proposed route rejected offers by Nova Scotia Power to purchase their land, citing the physiological effects of the [[electromagnetic field]] from transmission lines. Additional controversy occurred when it was determined that the proposed route would disturb a [[great blue heron]] colony, which brought angry responses from members of the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq Nation]].<ref>Kevin Cox \"Power plant ruffles more than feathers\" ''[[The Globe and Mail]] Saturday, July 6, 1991</ref>\n\nMitsui formed Mitsui & Co.

The Ahlstrom Pyropower circulating fluidized-bed (CFB) combustion system was designed to achieve a 90% reduction in SO<sub>2</sub> emissions and a 65% to 75% reduction in NO<sub>x</sub> emissions\u2014very respectable numbers in 1994, when the plant began operation.<ref name=\"Rock of Reliability\">{{cite news |title=Nova Scotia Power\u2019s Point Aconi plant overcomes CFB design problems to become rock of reliability |url=https://www.powermag.com/nova-scotia-powers-point-aconi-plant-overcomes-cfb-design-problems-to-become-rock-of-reliability/ |accessdate=10 April 2020 |work=POWER magazine |publisher=Access Intelligence, LLC |date=14 September 2006}}</ref>\n\nAfter initial production issues at the Point Aconi facility were resolved, Nova Scotia Power Corporation closed and decommissioned the 65-year-old [[Seaboard Generating Station]] in 1997.<ref>[http://ns1758.ca/electric/electricpwr12.html \"Seaboard Power Corporation\" taken from ''History of Electric Power Companies in Nova Scotia'']</ref>\n\n==Prince Colliery coal==\nThe Point Aconi Generating Station was originally designed to burn high sulphur coal mined in the Sydney Coal Field, which it sits atop. The primary source of coal was to be from the Prince Colliery, located {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the generating station property. The Prince Colliery was owned by the federal Crown corporation [[Cape Breton Development Corporation]] (DEVCO) which was beset with production problems at its three remaining collieries during the mid-late 1990s as a result of flooding, roof collapses and labour difficulties. The instability of locally mined coal forced Nova Scotia Power to import coal from the [[United States]] and [[South America]] beginning in 1998 to supplement the supply from DEVCO.<ref>[http://www.littletechshoppe.com/ns1625/nshist40.html \"NSP to Import More U.S. Coal: Coal Shortage Shuts Down Generating Plant\" ''Cape Breton Post'' October 23, 1998, taken from ''History of Nova Scotia with special attention given to Communications and Transportation'', Chapter 40, September-October 1998]</ref>\n\n==Imported coal==\nFrom 1998 to 2000, Nova Scotia Power brought imported coal into Nova Scotia at the [[Martin Marietta|Martin Marietta Materials]] aggregate loading facility in [[Auld's Cove, Nova Scotia|Auld's Cove]] on the [[Strait of Canso]]. That required coal ordered for the Point Aconi Generating Station and [[Lingan Generating Station]] to be transported by the [[Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway]] to the DEVCO coal washing plant at [[Victoria Junction, Nova Scotia|Victoria Junction]], and the coal destined for the Point Aconi Generating Station was trucked the final distance to the plant. DEVCO closed the Prince Colliery, its last operating coal mine, on November 23, 2001; ironically, the original reason for constructing the Point Aconi Generating Station had been to secure the long-term viability of the Prince Colliery.<ref>[http://www.littletechshoppe.com/ns1625/nshist42.html \"Pennsylvania Coal Unloaded at Sydney,\" ''Cape Breton Post'' October 23, 1998, taken from ''History of Nova Scotia with special attention given to Communications and Transportation'', Chapter 40, September-October 1998]</ref>\n\nAfter Nova Scotia Power purchased the surface assets of DEVCO in late 2001, all coal for its two remaining thermal generating stations in [[Industrial Cape Breton]] was imported through the International Coal Pier on Sydney Harbour which was formerly owned and operated for coal export by DEVCO.<ref>http://www.littletechshoppe.com/ns1625/nshist50.html  \"NSPI Fuel Supplies at Dangerously Low Levels\"  ''Nova Scotia Power'' (http://www.nspower.ca/AboutUs/WhatsNew/detail1568.html)</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Commons category}}\n\n{{Portal|Canada|Energy}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality]]\n[[Category:Coal-fired power stations in Nova Scotia]]\n[[Category:Nova Scotia Power]]\n", "name_user": "Ken Heaton", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added 'See Also'", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Aconi_Generating_Station"}
