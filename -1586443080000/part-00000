She soon began taking the top prize at junior tournaments with regularity, going on to win the European Championships 12s and 18s in 1982.\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nGraf played in her first professional tournament in October 1982 at [[1982 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix|Filderstadt]], Germany. She lost her first round match 6\u20134, 6\u20130 to [[Tracy Austin]], a two-time US Open champion and former world No. 1 player. (Twelve years later, Graf defeated Austin 6\u20130, 6\u20130 during a second round match at the [[Indian Wells Masters|Evert Cup]] in [[Indian Wells, California]], which was their second and last match against each other.)\n\nAt the start of her first full professional year in 1983, Graf was 13 years old and ranked world No. 124. She won no titles during the next three years, but her ranking climbed steadily to world No. 98 in 1983, No. 22 in 1984, and No. 6 in 1985. In 1984, she first gained international attention when she almost upset the tenth seed, [[Jo Durie]] of the United Kingdom, in a fourth round [[Centre Court]] match at Wimbledon. In August as a 15-year-old (and youngest entrant) representing West Germany, she won the tennis demonstration event at the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympic Games]] in Los Angeles. No medals were awarded as this was not an official Olympic event.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/athletes/profiles/bio_uk.asp?PAR_I_ID=64473 |title=Steffi Graf: The Golden Slam |publisher=Olympic.org |date= |accessdate=4 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616133142/http://www.olympic.org/uk/athletes/profiles/bio_uk.asp?PAR_I_ID=64473 |archive-date=16 June 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nGraf's schedule was closely controlled by her father, who limited her play so that she would not burn out.<ref name=\"latimes1987\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-13/sports/sp-7824_1_peter-graf |title=Both on and Off Court, Graf Has Come a Long Way in Past Year |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=13 September 1987 |first=John |last=Feinstein |accessdate=18 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150829210451/http://articles.latimes.com/1987-09-13/sports/sp-7824_1_peter-graf |archive-date=29 August 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 1985, for instance, she played only ten events leading up to the US Open, whereas another up-and-coming star, [[Gabriela Sabatini]] of Argentina, who was a year younger than Graf, played 21. Peter also kept a tight rein on Graf's personal life. Social invitations on the tour were often declined as Graf's focus was kept on practicing and match play. Working with her father and then-coach [[Pavel Slo\u017eil]], Graf typically practiced for up to four hours a day, often heading straight from airports to practice courts. This narrow focus meant that Graf, already shy and retiring by nature,<ref name=\"latimes1987\"/> made few friends on the tour in her early years, but it led to a steady improvement in her play.\n\nIn 1985 and early 1986, Graf emerged as the top challenger to the dominance of [[Martina Navratilova]] and [[Chris Evert]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-08/sports/sp-9730_1_peter-graf |title=Graf, 16, Can Handle Pressure |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=8 June 1986 |first=John |last=Feinstein |accessdate=18 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016223012/http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-08/sports/sp-9730_1_peter-graf |archive-date=16 October 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During that period, she lost six times to Evert and three times to Navratilova, all in straight sets. She did not win a tournament but consistently reached tournament finals, semifinals and quarterfinals, with the highlight being her semifinal loss to Navratilova at the US Open.\n\nOn 13 April 1986, Graf won her first WTA tournament and beat Evert for the first time in the final of the [[Family Circle Cup]] in [[Hilton Head, South Carolina]]. (She never lost to Evert again, beating her six more times over the next three and a half years.) Graf then won her next three tournaments at [[Bausch & Lomb Championships|Amelia Island]], Charleston, and [[Qatar Telecom German Open|Berlin]], culminating in a 6\u20132, 6\u20133 defeat of Navratilova in the final of the latter.

She returned to win a small tournament at [[Mahwah, New Jersey|Mahwah]] just before the US Open where, in one of the most anticipated matches of the year, she encountered Navratilova in a semifinal. The match was played over two days with Navratilova finally winning after saving three match points 6\u20131, 6\u20137, 7\u20136. Graf then won three consecutive indoor titles at [[Toray Pan Pacific Open|Tokyo]], [[Zurich Open|Zurich]], and [[Brighton]], before once again contending with Navratilova at the season-ending [[1986 Virginia Slims Championships|Virginia Slims Championships]] in New York. This time, Navratilova beat Graf 7\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20132.\n\n===Breakthrough year: 1987===\nGraf's Grand Slam tournament breakthrough came in 1987. She started the year strongly, with six tournament victories heading into the French Open, with the highlight being at the tournament in [[Miami Masters|Miami]], where she defeated Martina Navratilova in a semifinal and Chris Evert in the final and lost only 20 games in the seven rounds of the tournament. In the French Open final, Graf defeated Navratilova, who was the world No. 1, 6\u20134, 4\u20136, 8\u20136 after beating Sabatini in a three-set semifinal.\n\nGraf then lost to Navratilova 7\u20135, 6\u20133 in the Wimbledon final, her first loss of the year. However, in the [[Fed Cup|Federation Cup]] final in [[Vancouver, Canada]], three weeks later, she defeated Evert easily 6\u20132, 6\u20131. The US Open ended anti-climactically as Navratilova defeated Graf in the final 7\u20136, 6\u20131.\n\nGraf had a win-loss record of 75-2 for a 97.4 winning percentage in 1987, both losses coming to Navratilova as they split the four matches they played during the year. On 17 August, after defeating Evert in a straight set final in the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles, Graf overtook Navratilova for the world No. 1 ranking for the first time in her career, a ranking she would hold for the next 186 consecutive weeks, a record (it was tied by Serena Williams in 2016).

The difficulty of answering questions about the matter came to a head at a Wimbledon press conference, where Graf broke down in tears. Wimbledon authorities then threatened to immediately shut down any subsequent press conferences where questions about the issue were asked. Whether this scandal affected Graf's form is open to debate. In an interview with ''Stern'' magazine in July 1990, Graf stated, \"I could not fight as usual.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DE163BF930A25754C0A966958260 |title=Tennis; Graf's Toughest Foe: the Press |work=The New York Times |date=13 July 1990 |accessdate=17 May 2011 |first=Ferdinand |last=Protzman}}</ref>\n\nGraf again lost to Monica Seles in the final of the French Open 7\u20136, 6\u20134. Seles was behind 2\u20136 in the first-set tiebreaker, but then came back to win six points in a row and take the set. At Wimbledon, Graf lost in the semifinals to [[Zina Garrison]], who with this victory broke Graf's string of 13 consecutive Major finals. This was a major upset as Garrison had to save a match point to defeat Monica Seles in the quarterfinal, and was expected to easily fall to Graf, whom she had not beaten in 4 years.  After victories in [[Canada Masters|Montreal]] and [[Acura Classic|San Diego]], Graf reached the US Open final, where she lost in straight sets to Sabatini. Graf won four indoor tournaments after the US Open, including a pair of straight set wins over Sabatini in the finals of [[Zurich Open|Z\u00fcrich]] and [[Virginia Slims of New England|Worcester]]. Although Sabatini got the best of Graf in the semifinals of the season-ending [[WTA Tour Championships|Virginia Slims Championships]], Graf still finished the year as the top-ranked player.\n\n====1991====\nA mixture of injury problems, personal difficulties, and loss of form made 1991 a tough year for Graf. Seles established herself as the new dominant player on the women's tour, winning the Australian Open, French Open, and US Open and, in March, ending Graf's record 186 consecutive-weeks hold on the World No. 1 ranking.<ref name=\"wta_spotlight\"/> Graf briefly regained the top ranking after winning at Wimbledon but lost it again after her loss to Navratilova at the US Open.\n\nGraf lost an [[1991 Australian Open|Australian Open]] quarterfinal to [[Jana Novotn\u00e1]], the first time she did not reach the semifinals of a Grand Slam singles tournament since the 1986 French Open. She then lost to Sabatini in her next three tournaments before winning the U.S. Hardcourt Championships in [[San Antonio]], beating Monica Seles in the final. After losing a fifth straight time to Sabatini in [[Bausch & Lomb Championships|Amelia Island, Florida]], Graf again defeated Seles in the [[Hamburg Masters|Hamburg]] final. Following her tournament victory in [[WTA German Open|German Open]] in Berlin, Graf suffered one of the worst defeats of her career in a [[1991 French Open|French Open]] semifinal where she won only two games against S\u00e1nchez Vicario and lost her first 6\u20130 set since 1984. At [[1991 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], however, Graf captured her third women's crown, this time at Sabatini's expense. Sabatini served for the match twice, and was two points away from her first Wimbledon title. After breaking Sabatini's serve to even the third set at 6\u20136, Graf defeated Sabatini by winning the next two games to take the match 6\u20134, 3\u20136, 8\u20136. Martina Navratilova then defeated Graf 7\u20136, 6\u20137, 6\u20134 in a [[1991 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] semifinal, the first time she had beaten Graf in four years. Graf then won in Leipzig, with her 500th career victory coming in a quarterfinal against [[Judith Wiesner]]. After winning two more indoor tournaments at Zurich and [[Brighton International|Brighton]], she failed once again in the Virginia Slims Championships, losing her quarterfinal to Novotn\u00e1. Soon after, she split with her long-time coach, Pavel Slo\u017eil.\n\n====1992====\nA bout of [[rubella]] forced Graf to miss the first major event of 1992, the [[1992 Australian Open|Australian Open]]. Her year continued indifferently with losses in three of her first four tournaments, including a semifinal loss to [[Jana Novotn\u00e1]] in [[Virginia Slims of Chicago|Chicago]]. It was Graf's second consecutive loss to Novotna, and dating back to their 1991 Australian Open quarterfinal match, Jana had won three of their last five meetings.  It would also be the last loss Graf would ever have to Novotna in a match she completed (she did have a loss after withdrawing with injury after the first set of a late 1996 match).  Chicago was notable, however, for being the first tournament Graf played with her new coach, former Swiss player [[Heinz G\u00fcnthardt]].

She lost twice to Sabatini in the early spring at the Lipton International and the Bausch & Lomb Championships, which now brought her to 7 losses in her last 8 matches against Sabatini; however, the Bausch & Lomb loss would be Graf's final loss to Sabatini, winning her next, and last, eight matches against Sabatini.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/headtohead/steffi-graf_2255881_2718/0,,12781~2718~7184,00.html |title=WTA &#124; Players &#124; Head to Head &#124; Steffi Graf |publisher=Wtatennis.com |date= |accessdate=1 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017092649/http://www.wtatennis.com/headtohead/steffi-graf_2255881_2718/0,,12781~2718~7184,00.html |archive-date=17 October 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nVictories at [[Hamburg Masters|Hamburg]] and [[WTA German Open|Berlin]] (beating S\u00e1nchez Vicario in the finals of both) prepared her for the French Open, where she defeated S\u00e1nchez Vicario in the semifinals after losing the first set 6\u20130. Graf then lost a closely contested final to Monica Seles, 6\u20132, 3\u20136, 10\u20138. Seles won the match on her 5th match point; Graf came within two points of winning the match a few games earlier. At Wimbledon, after struggling through early-round three-setters against [[Mariaan de Swardt]] and [[Patty Fendick]], she easily defeated Natasha Zvereva in the quarterfinal, Sabatini in the semifinal, and Seles in the final 6\u20132, 6\u20131, with Seles playing in almost complete silence because of widespread media and player criticism of her [[grunting (tennis)|grunting]]. Graf then won all five of her [[Fed Cup]] matches, helping Germany defeat Spain in the final by defeating Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario 6\u20134, 6\u20132. At the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Graf lost to [[Jennifer Capriati]] in the final and claimed the silver medal. At the US Open, Graf was upset in the quarterfinal by S\u00e1nchez Vicario 7\u20136, 6\u20133. Four consecutive indoor tournament victories in the autumn helped improve her season, but for the third consecutive year, she failed to win the Virginia Slims Championships, where she lost in the first round to [[Lori McNeil]].\n\n===Second period of dominance===\n====1993====\nGraf began 1993 with four losses in her first six tournaments of the year: two to S\u00e1nchez Vicario and one each to Seles and the 36-year-old Martina Navratilova. She struggled at the [[Qatar Telecom German Open|tournament in Berlin]] where she lost a 6\u20130 set to the unheralded [[Sabine Hack]] before defeating [[Mary Joe Fern\u00e1ndez]] and Sabatini in three-set matches to claim her seventh title there in eight years.\n\nDuring a quarterfinal match between Seles and [[Magdalena Maleeva]] in Hamburg, Seles was stabbed between the shoulder blades by a mentally ill German fan of Graf, G\u00fcnter Parche. He claimed that he committed the attack to help Graf reclaim the world No. 1 ranking. More than two years elapsed before Seles competed again.

Graf's game were her powerful inside-out forehand drive (which earned her the moniker ''Fr\u00e4ulein Forehand'') and her intricate footwork.<ref>{{cite news |

often positioned herself in her backhand corner and although this left her forehand wide open and vulnerable to attack, her court speed meant that only the most accurate shots wide to her forehand caused any trouble.\nGraf's technique on the forehand was unique and instantly recognizable: generating considerable racquet head speed with her swing, she reached the point of contact late and typically out of the air. As a result, she hit her forehand with exceptional pace and accuracy. According to her coaches Pavel Slo\u017eil and Heinz G\u00fcnthardt, Graf's superior sense of timing was the key behind the success of her forehand.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/><ref>{{cite news |author=Simon O&#039;Hagan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/wimbledon-95-graf-on-a-new-curve-1588167.html |title=WIMBLEDON '95: Graf on a new curve |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date= |accessdate=2017-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811233548/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/wimbledon-95-graf-on-a-new-curve-1588167.html |archive-date=11 August 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nGraf also had a powerful backhand drive but over the course of her career tended to use it less frequently, opting more often for an effective backhand slice. Starting in the early 1990s, she used the slice almost exclusively in baseline rallies and mostly limited the topspin backhand to passing shots. Her accuracy with the slice, both cross-court and down the line and her ability to skid the ball and keep it low, enabled her to use it as an offensive weapon to set the ball up for her forehand put-aways. However, Graf admitted in 1995 that she would have preferred having a two-handed backhand in retrospect.<ref name=\"asapsports1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=19251 |title=ASAP Sports Transcripts - Tennis - 1995 - WTA TOUR CHAMPIONSHIPS - November 18 - Steffi Graf |website=Asapsports.com |date=1995-11-18 |accessdate=2017-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313124523/http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=19251 |archive-date=13 March 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nShe built her powerful and accurate serve up to {{convert|174|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, making it one of the fastest serves in women's tennis and was a capable volleyer.<ref name=\"bleacherreport1\"/><ref name=\"grantland1\"/>\n\nAn exceptionally versatile competitor, Graf remains the only player, male or female, to have won the calendar-year Grand Slam on three surfaces or to have won each Grand Slam at least four times. Eighteen-time Grand Slam champion and former rival [[Chris Evert]] opined, \"Steffi Graf is the best all-around player. Martina [Navratilova] won more on fast courts and I won more on slow courts, but Steffi came along and won more titles on both surfaces.\"<ref name=\"youtube1\"/> Her endurance and superior footwork allowed her to excel on clay courts, where, in addition to six French Open titles, she won 26 regular tour events, including a record eight titles at the [[German Open (WTA)|German Open]].

In 1984, she first gained international attention when she almost upset the tenth seed, [[Jo Durie]] of the United Kingdom, in a fourth round [[Centre Court]] match at Wimbledon.

Working with her father and then-coach [[Pavel Slo\u017eil]], Graf typically practiced for up to four hours a day, often heading straight from airports to practice courts. This narrow focus meant that Graf, already shy and retiring by nature,<ref name=\"latimes1987\"/> made few friends on the tour in her early years, but it led to a steady improvement in her play.\n\nIn 1985 and early 1986, Graf emerged as the top challenger to the dominance of [[Martina Navratilova]] and [[Chris Evert]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-08/sports/sp-9730_1_peter-graf |title=Graf, 16, Can Handle Pressure |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=8 June 1986 |first=John |last=Feinstein |accessdate=18 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016223012/http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-08/sports/sp-9730_1_peter-graf |archive-date=16 October 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During that period, she lost six times to Evert and three times to Navratilova, all in straight sets.

The match was played over two days with Navratilova finally winning after saving three match points 6\u20131, 6\u20137, 7\u20136.

This time, Navratilova beat Graf 7\u20136, 6\u20133, 6\u20132.\n\n===Breakthrough year: 1987===\nGraf's Grand Slam tournament breakthrough came in 1987. She started the year strongly, with six tournament victories heading into the French Open, with the highlight being at the tournament in [[Miami Masters|Miami]], where she defeated Martina Navratilova in a semifinal and Chris Evert in the final and lost only 20 games in the seven rounds of the tournament. In the French Open final, Graf defeated Navratilova, who was the world No. 1, 6\u20134, 4\u20136, 8\u20136 after beating Sabatini in a three-set semifinal.\n\nGraf then lost to Navratilova 7\u20135, 6\u20133 in the Wimbledon final, her first loss of the year. However, in the [[Fed Cup|Federation Cup]] final in [[Vancouver, Canada]], three weeks later, she defeated Evert easily 6\u20132, 6\u20131. The US Open ended anti-climactically as Navratilova defeated Graf in the final 7\u20136, 6\u20131.\n\nGraf had a win-loss record of 75-2 for a 97.4 winning percentage in 1987, both losses coming to Navratilova as they split the four matches they played during the year. On 17 August, after defeating Evert in a straight set final in the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles, Graf overtook Navratilova for the world No. 1 ranking for the first time in her career, a ranking she would hold for the next 186 consecutive weeks, a record (it was tied by Serena Williams in 2016).

The difficulty of answering questions about the matter came to a head at a Wimbledon press conference, where Graf broke down in tears. Wimbledon authorities then threatened to immediately shut down any subsequent press conferences where questions about the issue were asked. Whether this scandal affected Graf's form is open to debate. In an interview with ''Stern'' magazine in July 1990, Graf stated, \"I could not fight as usual.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE7DE163BF930A25754C0A966958260 |title=Tennis; Graf's Toughest Foe: the Press |work=The New York Times |date=13 July 1990 |accessdate=17 May 2011 |first=Ferdinand |last=Protzman}}</ref>\n\nGraf again lost to Monica Seles in the final of the French Open 7\u20136, 6\u20134. Seles was behind 2\u20136 in the first-set tiebreaker, but then came back to win six points in a row and take the set. At Wimbledon, Graf lost in the semifinals to [[Zina Garrison]], who with this victory broke Graf's string of 13 consecutive Major finals. This was a major upset as Garrison had to save a match point to defeat Monica Seles in the quarterfinal, and was expected to easily fall to Graf, whom she had not beaten in 4 years.  After victories in [[Canada Masters|Montreal]] and [[Acura Classic|San Diego]], Graf reached the US Open final, where she lost in straight sets to Sabatini. Graf won four indoor tournaments after the US Open, including a pair of straight set wins over Sabatini in the finals of [[Zurich Open|Z\u00fcrich]] and [[Virginia Slims of New England|Worcester]]. Although Sabatini got the best of Graf in the semifinals of the season-ending [[WTA Tour Championships|Virginia Slims Championships]], Graf still finished the year as the top-ranked player.\n\n====1991====\nA mixture of injury problems, personal difficulties, and loss of form made 1991 a tough year for Graf. Seles established herself as the new dominant player on the women's tour, winning the Australian Open, French Open, and US Open and, in March, ending Graf's record 186 consecutive-weeks hold on the World No. 1 ranking.<ref name=\"wta_spotlight\"/> Graf briefly regained the top ranking after winning at Wimbledon but lost it again after her loss to Navratilova at the US Open.\n\nGraf lost an [[1991 Australian Open|Australian Open]] quarterfinal to [[Jana Novotn\u00e1]], the first time she did not reach the semifinals of a Grand Slam singles tournament since the 1986 French Open. She then lost to Sabatini in her next three tournaments before winning the U.S. Hardcourt Championships in [[San Antonio]], beating Monica Seles in the final. After losing a fifth straight time to Sabatini in [[Bausch & Lomb Championships|Amelia Island, Florida]], Graf again defeated Seles in the [[Hamburg Masters|Hamburg]] final. Following her tournament victory in [[WTA German Open|German Open]] in Berlin, Graf suffered one of the worst defeats of her career in a [[1991 French Open|French Open]] semifinal where she won only two games against S\u00e1nchez Vicario and lost her first 6\u20130 set since 1984. At [[1991 Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]], however, Graf captured her third women's crown, this time at Sabatini's expense. Sabatini served for the match twice, and was two points away from her first Wimbledon title. After breaking Sabatini's serve to even the third set at 6\u20136, Graf defeated Sabatini by winning the next two games to take the match 6\u20134, 3\u20136, 8\u20136. Martina Navratilova then defeated Graf 7\u20136, 6\u20137, 6\u20134 in a [[1991 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] semifinal, the first time she had beaten Graf in four years. Graf then won in Leipzig, with her 500th career victory coming in a quarterfinal against [[Judith Wiesner]]. After winning two more indoor tournaments at Zurich and [[Brighton International|Brighton]], she failed once again in the Virginia Slims Championships, losing her quarterfinal to Novotn\u00e1. Soon after, she split with her long-time coach, Pavel Slo\u017eil.\n\n====1992====\nA bout of [[rubella]] forced Graf to miss the first major event of 1992, the [[1992 Australian Open|Australian Open]]. Her year continued indifferently with losses in three of her first four tournaments, including a semifinal loss to [[Jana Novotn\u00e1]] in [[Virginia Slims of Chicago|Chicago]]. It was Graf's second consecutive loss to Novotna, and dating back to their 1991 Australian Open quarterfinal match, Jana had won three of their last five meetings.  It would also be the last loss Graf would ever have to Novotna in a match she completed (she did have a loss after withdrawing with injury after the first set of a late 1996 match).  Chicago was notable, however, for being the first tournament Graf played with her new coach, former Swiss player [[Heinz G\u00fcnthardt]]. Graf's father had approached G\u00fcnthardt during the 1991 Virginia Slims Championships.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ziehm|first1=Len|title=Steffi lives it up - New Graf steps out in style|agency=Chicago Sun Times|date=16 February 1992}}</ref> She would work with him for the remainder of her career.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/16/sports/tennis-finally-graf-gets-to-start-her-year.htm ]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}</ref> In [[Virginia Slims of Florida|Boca Raton, Florida]], Graf reached her first final of the year, where she faced [[Conchita Mart\u00ednez]] for the title.

She lost twice to Sabatini in the early spring at the Lipton International and the Bausch & Lomb Championships, which now brought her to 7 losses in her last 8 matches against Sabatini; however, the Bausch & Lomb loss would be Graf's final loss to Sabatini, winning her next, and last, eight matches against Sabatini.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wtatennis.com/headtohead/steffi-graf_2255881_2718/0,,12781~2718~7184,00.html |title=WTA &#124; Players &#124; Head to Head &#124; Steffi Graf |publisher=Wtatennis.com |date= |accessdate=1 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017092649/http://www.wtatennis.com/headtohead/steffi-graf_2255881_2718/0,,12781~2718~7184,00.html |archive-date=17 October 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nVictories at [[Hamburg Masters|Hamburg]] and [[WTA German Open|Berlin]] (beating S\u00e1nchez Vicario in the finals of both) prepared her for the French Open, where she defeated S\u00e1nchez Vicario in the semifinals after losing the first set 6\u20130. Graf then lost a closely contested final to Monica Seles, 6\u20132, 3\u20136, 10\u20138. Seles won the match on her 5th match point; Graf came within two points of winning the match a few games earlier. At Wimbledon, after struggling through early-round three-setters against [[Mariaan de Swardt]] and [[Patty Fendick]], she easily defeated Natasha Zvereva in the quarterfinal, Sabatini in the semifinal, and Seles in the final 6\u20132, 6\u20131, with Seles playing in almost complete silence because of widespread media and player criticism of her [[grunting (tennis)|grunting]]. Graf then won all five of her [[Fed Cup]] matches, helping Germany defeat Spain in the final by defeating Arantxa S\u00e1nchez Vicario 6\u20134, 6\u20132. At the Olympic Games in Barcelona, Graf lost to [[Jennifer Capriati]] in the final and claimed the silver medal. At the US Open, Graf was upset in the quarterfinal by S\u00e1nchez Vicario 7\u20136, 6\u20133. Four consecutive indoor tournament victories in the autumn helped improve her season, but for the third consecutive year, she failed to win the Virginia Slims Championships, where she lost in the first round to [[Lori McNeil]].\n\n===Second period of dominance===\n====1993====\nGraf began 1993 with four losses in her first six tournaments of the year: two to S\u00e1nchez Vicario and one each to Seles and the 36-year-old Martina Navratilova. She struggled at the [[Qatar Telecom German Open|tournament in Berlin]] where she lost a 6\u20130 set to the unheralded [[Sabine Hack]] before defeating [[Mary Joe Fern\u00e1ndez]] and Sabatini in three-set matches to claim her seventh title there in eight years.\n\nDuring a quarterfinal match between Seles and [[Magdalena Maleeva]] in Hamburg, Seles was stabbed between the shoulder blades by a mentally ill German fan of Graf, G\u00fcnter Parche. He claimed that he committed the attack to help Graf reclaim the world No. 1 ranking. More than two years elapsed before Seles competed again. Shortly after the stabbing, during a players meeting at the [[1993 Italian Open (tennis)|Italian Open]] in Rome, 17 of the world's top 25 WTA members voted against preserving Seles' world No. 1 ranking while she was sidelined.

Graf's game were her powerful inside-out forehand drive (which earned her the moniker ''Fr\u00e4ulein Forehand'') and her intricate footwork.<ref>{{cite news |

often positioned herself in her backhand corner and although this left her forehand wide open and vulnerable to attack, her court speed meant that only the most accurate shots wide to her forehand caused any trouble.\nGraf's technique on the forehand was unique and instantly recognizable: generating considerable racquet head speed with her swing, she reached the point of contact late and typically out of the air. As a result, she hit her forehand with exceptional pace and accuracy. According to her coaches Pavel Slo\u017eil and Heinz G\u00fcnthardt, Graf's superior sense of timing was the key behind the success of her forehand.<ref name=\"youtube1\"/><ref>{{cite news |author=Simon O&#039;Hagan |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/wimbledon-95-graf-on-a-new-curve-1588167.html |title=WIMBLEDON '95: Graf on a new curve |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date= |accessdate=2017-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811233548/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/wimbledon-95-graf-on-a-new-curve-1588167.html |archive-date=11 August 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nGraf also had a powerful backhand drive but over the course of her career tended to use it less frequently, opting more often for an effective backhand slice. Starting in the early 1990s, she used the slice almost exclusively in baseline rallies and mostly limited the topspin backhand to passing shots. Her accuracy with the slice, both cross-court and down the line and her ability to skid the ball and keep it low, enabled her to use it as an offensive weapon to set the ball up for her forehand put-aways. However, Graf admitted in 1995 that she would have preferred having a two-handed backhand in retrospect.<ref name=\"asapsports1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=19251 |title=ASAP Sports Transcripts - Tennis - 1995 - WTA TOUR CHAMPIONSHIPS - November 18 - Steffi Graf |website=Asapsports.com |date=1995-11-18 |accessdate=2017-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313124523/http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=19251 |archive-date=13 March 2017 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nShe built her powerful and accurate serve up to {{convert|174|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, making it one of the fastest serves in women's tennis and was a capable volleyer.<ref name=\"bleacherreport1\"/><ref name=\"grantland1\"/>\n\nAn exceptionally versatile competitor, Graf remains the only player, male or female, to have won the calendar-year Grand Slam on three surfaces or to have won each Grand Slam at least four times. Eighteen-time Grand Slam champion and former rival [[Chris Evert]] opined, \"Steffi Graf is the best all-around player.

policy===\n==== Kashmir ====\nIn September 2008, Swamy stridently retorted against the contentions of some Indian columnists who voiced their opinions in favor of \"peacefully\" surrendering Kashmir to Pakistan. He said,\n\n:\"I would say that the silent suffering majority of India wants none of this. The 'Kashmir issue,' in fact, can no more be solved by dialogue either with the Pakistanis or the Hurriyat, leave alone the constitutional impossibility of allowing it to secede. [...]Kashmir, in fact, is now our [[History of Kashmir|defining identity]]. It is a touchstone for our resolve to preserve our national integrity. The population of that State may be majority Muslim but the land and its history is predominantly Hindu. For our commitment to the survival of the ancient civilisation of India and the composite culture that secularists talk of, we have not only to win that coming inevitable war but also resolve never to part with Kashmir. [...]\n\n:Pakistanis often cite the United Nations resolutions on Kashmir to argue for a plebiscite. This obfuscates the fact of accession of the State to India. The legality of the Instrument of Accession signed in favour of India by the then Maharaja of J&K, Hari Singh, on 26 October 1947 has to prevail anyway.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/article1345324.ece |location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu |title=Kashmir defines Indian identity |date=25 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n==== Tamil Nadu politics ====\nSwamy is well known for his critical views against the \"Aryan versus Dravidian\" politics of [[Periyar E.

policy===\n==== Kashmir ====\nIn September 2008, Swamy stridently retorted against the contentions of some Indian columnists who voiced their opinions in favor of \"peacefully\" surrendering Kashmir to Pakistan. He said,\n\n:\"I would say that the silent suffering majority of India wants none of this. The 'Kashmir issue,' in fact, can no more be solved by dialogue either with the Pakistanis or the Hurriyat, leave alone the constitutional impossibility of allowing it to secede. [...]Kashmir, in fact, is now our [[History of Kashmir|defining identity]]. It is a touchstone for our resolve to preserve our national integrity. The population of that State may be majority Muslim but the land and its history is predominantly Hindu. For our commitment to the survival of the ancient civilisation of India and the composite culture that secularists talk of, we have not only to win that coming inevitable war but also resolve never to part with Kashmir. [...]\n\n:Pakistanis often cite the United Nations resolutions on Kashmir to argue for a plebiscite. This obfuscates the fact of accession of the State to India. The legality of the Instrument of Accession signed in favour of India by the then Maharaja of J&K, Hari Singh, on 26 October 1947 has to prevail anyway.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/article1345324.ece |location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu |title=Kashmir defines Indian identity |date=25 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n==== Tamil Nadu politics ====\nSwamy is well known for his critical views against the \"Aryan versus Dravidian\" politics of [[Periyar E.
