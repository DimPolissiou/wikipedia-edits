In 2004, he made a documentary film '[[Crossing the Lines]]: Kashmir, Pakistan, India' along with Dr. [[Zia Mian]].<ref>CGPACS (2006) [http://www.socsci.uci.edu/files/socsci/announcements/060512_hoodbhoy/crossingthelines.htm Crossing the Lines: Kashmir, Pakistan, India]</ref> These documentaries carry heavy emphasis on the issues of education, public health and scientific revolution in Pakistan.\n\nIn his documentaries, Dr. Hoodbhoy has heavily criticised Pakistan and India's nuclear weapons program. He also pointed out the seriousness of the Talibanization in Pakistan and its immediate effects on South Asia. His documentaries also point out that American and [[NATO]] forces in Afghanistan didn't help the Afghan people's life and there was no reform in Afghanistan's social and public sector and, instead, the insurgency and corruption grew, which also destabilised Pakistan's western front.<ref name=\"Fulbright Program\"/>\n* ''Crossing the Lines: Kashmir, Pakistan, India'' (2004)\n* ''The Bell Tolls for Planet Earth'' (2003)\n* ''Pakistan and India Under the Nuclear Shadow'' (2001)\n\n==Publications==\n\n===Books===\n* ''Education and the State: Fifty Years Of Pakistan'' [[Oxford University Press]], 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-19-577825-0}}\n* ''Islam and Science: Religious Orthodoxy and the Battle for Rationality'' Zed Books, London, 1992. {{ISBN|978-1-85649-025-2}}, (Translations in [[Arabic]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Malay language|Malaysian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], Japanese, and [[Urdu]])\n* (Co-Edited with A.
