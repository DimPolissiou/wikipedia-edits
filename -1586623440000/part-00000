It also bordered the three sectors occupied by the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] known collectively as West Berlin.

Ritter]] (2002) has argued that the East German state was defined by two dominant forces{{snd}}Soviet Communism on the one hand, and German traditions filtered through the interwar experiences of German Communists on the other. It always was constrained by the powerful example of the increasingly prosperous West, to which East Germans compared their nation. The changes wrought by the Communists were most apparent in ending capitalism and transforming industry and agriculture, in the militarization of society, and in the political thrust of the educational system and the media. On the other hand, there was relatively little change made in the historically independent domains of the sciences, the engineering professions, the Protestant churches, and in many bourgeois lifestyles. Social policy, says Ritter, became a critical legitimization tool in the last decades and mixed socialist and traditional elements about equally.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Gerhard A. |last=Ritter |authorlink=Gerhard A.

In eastern Germany, the Soviet Occupation Zone (SBZ{{snd}}''Sowjetische Besatzungszone'') comprised the five states (''L\u00e4nder'') of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Brandenburg]], [[Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], and [[Thuringia]]{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. Disagreements over the policies to be followed in the occupied zones quickly led to a breakdown in cooperation between the four powers, and the Soviets administered their zone without regard to the policies implemented in the other zones. The Soviets withdrew from the ACC in 1948; subsequently as the other three zones were increasingly unified and granted self-government, the Soviet administration instituted a separate socialist government in its zone {{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\n[[File:Deutschland Bundeslaender 1949.png|thumb|left|upright|West Germany (blue) comprised the Western Allies' zones, excluding the [[Saar (protectorate)|Saarland]] (purple); the Soviet zone, East Germany (red) surrounded West Berlin (yellow).]]\n\nYet, seven years after the Allies' [[Potsdam Agreement]] to a unified Germany, the USSR via the [[Stalin Note]] (10 March 1952) proposed [[German reunification]] and [[superpower disengagement]] from Central Europe, which the three Western Allies (the [[United States]], [[France]], the [[United Kingdom]]) rejected. Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]], a Communist proponent of reunification, died in early March 1953. Similarly, [[Lavrenty Beria]], the First Deputy Prime Minister of the USSR, pursued German reunification, but he was removed from power that same year before he could act on the matter. His successor, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], rejected reunification as equivalent to returning East Germany for annexation to the West; hence reunification went unconsidered until 1989. {{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n[[File:Deutschland Besatzungszonen 1945.svg|thumb|upright|Post-war occupied Germany: British (green), Soviet (red), American (orange), and French (blue) occupation zones]]\n\n[[File:West and East Berlin.svg|thumb|<center>West and East Berlin with the Berlin Wall {{nowrap|([[ShareMap:public/West and East Berlin|interactive map]])}}</center>]]\nEast Germany considered East Berlin to be its capital, and the Soviet Union and the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]] diplomatically recognized East Berlin as the capital.

West Germany, in contrast, maintained that it was the only legitimate government of Germany. From 1949 to the early 1970s, West Germany maintained that East Germany was an illegally constituted state.

The Federal Republic continued to maintain that it could not within its own structures recognize the GDR ''de jure'' as a sovereign state under international law; but it fully acknowledged that, within the structures of international law, the GDR was an independent sovereign state.

By a two-thirds vote in the ''[[Volkskammer]]'' on 23 August 1990, the German Democratic Republic declared its accession to the Federal Republic of Germany.

However, the parties did have representation in the Volkskammer and received some posts in the government.\n\nThe Volkskammer also included representatives from the ''[[mass movement|mass organisations]]'' like the [[Free German Youth]] (''Freie Deutsche Jugend'' or ''FDJ''), or the [[Free German Trade Union Federation]]. There was also a [[Democratic Women's Federation of Germany]], with seats in the Volkskammer.\n\nImportant non-parliamentary mass organisations in East German society included the German Gymnastics and Sports Association (''Deutscher Turn- und Sportbund'' or ''[[DTSB]]''), and [[People's Solidarity]] (''Volkssolidarit\u00e4t''), an organisation for the elderly. Another society of note was the [[Society for German-Soviet Friendship]].\n\nAfter the fall of Communism, the SED was renamed the \"[[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]]\" (PDS) which continued for a decade after reunification before merging with the West German [[Labour and Social Justice \u2013 The Electoral Alternative|WASG]] to form the [[Left Party (Germany)|Left Party]] (''Die Linke'').

East Germany}}\n\nUntil 1952, East Germany comprised the capital, [[East Berlin]] (though legally it was not fully part of the GDR's territory), and the five [[States of Germany|German states]] of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] (in 1947 renamed Mecklenburg), [[Brandenburg]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Thuringia]], and [[Saxony]], their post-war territorial demarcations approximating the pre-war German demarcations of the [[Middle Germany|Middle German]] ''L\u00e4nder'' (states) and ''Provinzen'' ([[provinces of Prussia]]). The western parts of two provinces, [[Pomerania Province (1815-1945)|Pomerania]] and [[Lower Silesia]], the remainder of which were annexed by Poland, remained in the GDR and were attached to Mecklenburg and Saxony, respectively.\n\nThe [[East German Administrative Reform of 1952]] established 14 ''Bezirke'' (districts) and ''de facto'' disestablished the five ''L\u00e4nder''. The new ''Bezirke'', named after their district centres, were as follows: (i) [[Rostock]], (ii) [[Neubrandenburg]], and (iii) [[Schwerin]] created from the ''Land'' (state) of Mecklenburg; (iv) [[Potsdam]], (v) [[Frankfurt (Oder)]], and (vii) [[Cottbus]] from Brandenburg; (vi) [[Magdeburg]] and (viii) [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] from Saxony-Anhalt; (ix) [[Leipzig]], (xi) [[Dresden]], and (xii) [[Karl-Marx-Stadt]] (Chemnitz until 1953 and again from 1990) from Saxony; and (x) [[Erfurt]], (xiii) [[Gera]], and (xiv) [[Suhl]] from Thuringia.\n\nEast Berlin was made the country's 15th ''Bezirk'' in 1961 but retained special legal status until 1968, when the residents approved the new (draft) constitution. Despite the city as a whole being legally under the control of the [[Allied Control Council]], and diplomatic objections of the Allied governments, the GDR administered the ''Bezirk'' of Berlin as part of its territory.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-0816-002, Leipzig, Karl-Marx-Platz, Brunnen.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|[[City-Hochhaus Leipzig|Uni-Riese]] (''University Giant'') in 1982.

Chief among these was the Ministry of National Defence. Because of East Germany's proximity to the West during the [[Cold War]] (1945\u201392), its military forces were among the most advanced of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Defining what was a military force and what was not is a matter of some dispute.\n\n=== National People's Army ===\n{{Main|National People's Army}}\nThe Nationale Volksarmee (NVA) was the largest military organisation in East Germany. It was formed in 1956 from the [[Kasernierte Volkspolizei]] (Barracked People's Police), the military units of the regular police ([[Volkspolizei]]), when East Germany joined the Warsaw Pact. From its creation, it was controlled by the [[Ministry of National Defence (East Germany)]].

It was controlled by the Ministry of the Interior. Following the remilitarisation of East Germany in 1956, the Deutsche Grenzpolizei was transformed into a military force in 1961, modeled after the [[Soviet Border Troops]], and transferred to the Ministry of National Defense, as part of the National People's Army. In 1973, it was separated from the NVA, but it remained under the same ministry. At its peak, it numbered approximately 47,000 men.\n\n=== Volkspolizei ===\n{{Main|Bereitschaftspolizei#In the former German Democratic Republic}}\n\nAfter the NVA was separated from the Volkspolizei in 1956, the Ministry of the Interior maintained its own public order barracked reserve, known as the Volkspolizei-Bereitschaften (VPB). These units were, like the Kasernierte Volkspolizei, equipped as motorised infantry, and they numbered between 12,000 and 15,000 men.\n\n=== Stasi ===\n{{main|Stasi}}\nThe Ministry of State Security (Stasi) included the [[Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment]], which was mainly involved with facilities security and plain clothes events security. They were the only part of the feared Stasi that was visible to the public, and so were very unpopular within the population. The Stasi numbered around 90,000 men, the Guards Regiment around 11,000-12,000 men.\n\n=== Combat groups of the working class ===\nThe ''[[Kampfgruppen der Arbeiterklasse]]'' (combat groups of the working class) numbered around 400,000 for much of their existence, and were organised around factories. The KdA was the political-military instrument of the SED; it was essentially a \"party Army\". All KdA directives and decisions were made by the ZK's ''[[Politburo|Politb\u00fcro]]''. They received their training from the Volkspolizei and the Ministry of the Interior. Membership was voluntary, but SED members were required to join as part of their membership obligation.\n\n=== Conscientious objection ===\n{{Main|Conscientious objection in East Germany}}\n\nEvery man was required to serve eighteen months of [[conscription|compulsory military service]]; for the medically unqualified and [[conscientious objector]], there were the ''[[Baueinheiten]]'' (construction units), established in 1964, two years after the introduction of conscription, in response to political pressure by the national [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Protestant Church upon the GDR's government.

Popular reaction to these measures was mixed, and Western media penetrated the country both through cross-border television and radio broadcasts from West Germany and from the U.S. propaganda network [[Radio Free Europe]]. Dissidents, particularly professionals, sometimes fled to West Germany, which was relatively easy before the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-vPuoKrNRp8C&pg=PA618 |last=Schnoor |first=Rainer |chapter=The Good and the Bad America: Perceptions of the United States in the GDR |pages=618\u201326 |title=The United States and Germany in the Era of the Cold War, 1945-1990: A Handbook |volume=1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Adam|title=Germany and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History; a Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&pg=PA1067 |year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=1067|isbn=9781851096282|access-date=14 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506042703/https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&pg=PA1067|archive-date=6 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Support of Third World socialist countries ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-Z1014-018, Berlin, Staatsoberhaupt Angolas an der Grenze.jpg|thumb|right|Angola's [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]] during his visit in East Berlin]]\n\nAfter receiving wider international diplomatic recognition in 1972\u201373, the GDR began active cooperation with Third World socialist governments and [[Wars of national liberation|national liberation movements]].

The [[Red Army]] dismantled and transported to Russia the infrastructure and industrial plants of the Soviet Zone of Occupation. By the early 1950s, the reparations were paid in agricultural and industrial products; and [[Lower Silesia]], with its coal mines and [[Szczecin]], an important natural port, were given to Poland by the decision of Stalin and in accordance with [[Potsdam Agreement]].<ref name=\"Norman M. Naimark 1949, pp. 167-9\"/>\n\nThe socialist [[centrally planned economy]] of the German Democratic Republic was like that of the USSR. In 1950, the GDR joined the [[COMECON]] trade bloc. In 1985, [[collective]] (state) enterprises earned 96.7% of the net national income. To ensure stable prices for goods and services, the state paid 80% of basic supply costs. The estimated 1984 per capita income was $9,800 ($22,600 in 2015 dollars). In 1976, the average annual growth of the GDP was approximately five percent.

East Germans with friends or relatives in the West (or with any access to a [[hard currency]]) and the necessary [[Staatsbank]] [[foreign currency account]] could afford Western products and export-quality East German products via [[Intershop]]. Consumer goods also were available, by post, from the Danish [[Jauerfood]], and Genex companies.\n\nThe government used money and prices as political devices, providing highly subsidised prices for a wide range of basic goods and services, in what was known as \"the second pay packet\".<ref>Boroch, Wilfried (1996), \"Social policy as an institutional transformation problem\", ''Transition Economies'', Volume 31, Number 3, pp. 139-146.</ref>  At the production level, artificial prices made for a system of semi-barter and resource hoarding. For the consumer, it led to the substitution of GDR money with time, barter, and hard currencies. The socialist economy became steadily more dependent on financial infusions from hard-currency loans from West Germany. East Germans, meanwhile, came to see their soft currency as worthless relative to the Deutsche Mark (DM).<ref>Jonathan R.

University chairs and departments devoted to the study of scientific atheism were founded and much literature (scholarly and popular) on the subject was produced.{{by whom|date=September 2015}} This activity subsided in the late 1960s amid perceptions that it had started to become counterproductive. Official and scholarly attention to atheism renewed beginning in 1973, though this time with more emphasis on scholarship and on the training of cadres than on propaganda. Throughout, the attention paid to atheism in East Germany was never intended to jeopardise the cooperation that was desired from those East Germans who were religious.<ref>Fulbrook, \"The Limits Of Totalitarianism: God, State and Society in the GDR\"</ref>\n\n=== Protestantism ===\n{{Main|de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|l1=Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W0613-039, Sitzung des Martin-Luther-Komitees.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|right|A 1980 meeting between representatives of the BEK and Erich Honecker]]\n\nEast Germany, historically, was majority [[Protestant]] (primarily [[Lutheran]]) from the early stages of the [[Protestant Reformation]] onwards.

In June 1991, following the [[German reunification]], the BEK churches again merged with the EKD ones.\n\nBetween 1956 and 1971 the [[leadership]] of the East German Lutheran churches gradually changed its relations with the state from hostility to cooperation.<ref>Martin Onnasch, \"Konflikt und Kompromiss: Die Haltung der evangelischen Kirchen zu den gesellschaftlichen Ver\u00e4nderungen in der DDR am Anfang der f\u00fcnfziger Jahre,\" [\"Conflict and compromise: the position of the Protestant churches with regard to social changes in the GDR at the beginning of the 1950s\"], ''Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte / Halbjahresschrift f\u00fcr Theologie und Geschichtswisseschaft,'' 1990, Vol. 3 Issue 1, pp.&nbsp;152\u2013165.</ref> From the founding of the GDR in 1949, the Socialist Unity Party sought to weaken the influence of the church on the rising generation. The church adopted an attitude of confrontation and distance toward the state. Around 1956 this began to develop into a more neutral stance accommodating conditional loyalty. The government was no longer regarded as illegitimate; instead, the church leaders started viewing the authorities as installed by God and, therefore, deserving of obedience by Christians. But on matters where the state demanded something which the churches felt was not in accordance with the will of God, the churches reserved their right to say no. There were both structural and intentional causes behind this development. Structural causes included the hardening of Cold War tensions in Europe in the mid-1950s, which made it clear that the East German state was not temporary. The loss of church members also made it clear to the leaders of the church that they had to come into some kind of dialogue with the state. The intentions behind the change of attitude varied from a traditional liberal Lutheran acceptance of secular power to a positive attitude toward socialist ideas.<ref name=\"Stephen R.

He won the regional elections for the Brandenburg state assembly at the head of the SPD list in 1990. Stolpe remained in the Brandenburg government until he joined the federal government in 2002.\n\nApart from the Protestant state churches ({{lang-de|link=no|[[Landeskirche]]n}}) united in the EKD/BEK and the [[Catholic Church]] there was a number of smaller Protestant bodies, including Protestant Free Churches ({{lang-de|link=no|[[:de:Freikirche|Evangelische Freikirchen]]}}) united in the [[:de:Bund Evangelisch-Freikirchlicher Gemeinden in der DDR|Federation of the Free Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic]] and the [[:de:Bund Freier evangelischer Gemeinden in Deutschland|Federation of the Free Protestant Churches in Germany]], as well as [[:de:Evangelisch-Lutherische Freikirche|the Free Lutheran Church]], [[:de:Evangelisch-lutherische (altlutherische) Kirche|the Old Lutheran Church]] and [[:de:Kirchenbund Evangelisch-Reformierter Gemeinden in der DDR|Federation of the Reformed Churches in the German Democratic Republic]].

Bowers 1982, pp 73-86\"/>\n\nAfter 1945 the Church did fairly well in integrating Catholic exiles from lands to the east (which mostly became part of Poland) and in adjusting its institutional structures to meet the needs of a church within an officially atheist society. This meant an increasingly hierarchical church structure, whereas in the area of religious education, press, and youth organisations, a system of temporary staff was developed, one that took into account the special situation of [[Caritas International|Caritas]], a Catholic charity organisation. By 1950, therefore, there existed a Catholic subsociety that was well adjusted to prevailing specific conditions and capable of maintaining Catholic identity.<ref>{{cite book|author= Bernd Schaefer|title= The East German State and the Catholic Church, 1945-1989|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=96QzpCRH2agC|year= 2010|publisher= Berghahn Books|isbn= 9781845458522|access-date= 14 October 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160603062014/https://books.google.com/books?id=96QzpCRH2agC|archive-date= 3 June 2016|url-status= live}} ch 1</ref>{{Page needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nWith a generational change in the episcopacy taking place in the early 1980s, the state hoped for better relations with the new bishops, but the new bishops instead began holding unauthorised mass meetings, promoting international ties in discussions with theologians abroad, and hosting ecumenical conferences. The new bishops became less politically oriented and more involved in pastoral care and attention to spiritual concerns. The government responded by limiting international contacts for bishops.<ref>{{cite book|author= Adrian Webb|title= Routledge Companion to Central and Eastern Europe since 1919|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=omjBEYM3IK4C&pg=PA185|year= 2008|publisher= Taylor & Francis|page= 185|isbn= 9780203928172|access-date= 14 October 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160427110838/https://books.google.com/books?id=omjBEYM3IK4C&pg=PA185|archive-date= 27 April 2016|url-status= live}}</ref>{{qn|date=September 2015}}\n\nList of apostolic administrators:\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Erfurt|Erfurt-Meiningen]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of G\u00f6rlitz|G\u00f6rlitz]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Magdeburg|Magdeburg]]\n* [[Apostolic administration of Schwerin|Schwerin]]\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main|Culture of East Germany}}\n\n{{More citations needed section|date = June 2015}}\n\nEast Germany's culture was strongly influenced by communist thought and was marked by an attempt to define itself in opposition to the west, particularly West Germany and the United States.

There were approximately 3.6&nbsp;million telephones in usage (21.8 for every 100 inhabitants), and 16,476 [[Teletypewriter message|Telex]] stations. Both of these networks were run by the [[Deutsche Post der DDR]] (East German Post Office). East Germany was assigned telephone country code [[+37]]; in 1991, several months after reunification, East German telephone exchanges were incorporated into country code +49.\n\nAn unusual feature of the telephone network was that, in most cases, [[direct distance dialing]] for [[long-distance call]]s was not possible. Although [[area codes]] were assigned to all major towns and cities, they were only used for switching international calls. Instead, each location had its own list of dialing codes with shorter codes for [[local call]]s and longer codes for long-distance calls. After unification, the existing network was largely replaced, and area codes and dialing became standardised.\n\nIn 1976 East Germany inaugurated the operation of a ground-based radio station at [[F\u00fcrstenwalde]] for the purpose of relaying and receiving communications from Soviet satellites and to serve as a participant in the international telecommunications organization established by the Soviet government, [[Intersputnik]].\n\n== Official and public holidays ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It always was constrained by the powerful example of the increasingly prosperous West, to which East Germans compared their nation. The changes wrought by the Communists were most apparent in ending capitalism and transforming industry and agriculture, in the militarization of society, and in the political thrust of the educational system and the media. On the other hand, there was relatively little change made in the historically independent domains of the sciences, the engineering professions, the Protestant churches, and in many bourgeois lifestyles.

Both countries were admitted into the United Nations on 18 September 1973. This also increased the number of countries recognizing East Germany to 55, including the US, UK and France, though these three still refused to recognize East Berlin as the capital, and insisted on a specific provision in the UN resolution accepting the two Germanys into the UN to that effect.<ref name=\"time\"/>  Following the Ostpolitik the West German view was that East Germany was a ''de facto'' government within a single German nation and a ''de jure'' state organisation of parts of Germany outside the Federal Republic. The Federal Republic continued to maintain that it could not within its own structures recognize the GDR ''de jure'' as a sovereign state under international law; but it fully acknowledged that, within the structures of international law, the GDR was an independent sovereign state. By distinction, West Germany then viewed itself as being within its own boundaries, not only the ''de facto'' and ''de jure'' government, but also the sole ''de jure'' legitimate representative of a dormant \"Germany as whole\".<ref>{{citation |first=Peter E. |last=Quint |title=The Imperfect Union; Constitutional Structures for German Unification |year = 1991 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=14 }}</ref>  The two Germanys relinquished any claim to represent the other internationally; which they acknowledged as necessarily implying a mutual recognition of each other as both capable of representing their own populations ''de jure'' in participating in international bodies and agreements, such as the [[United Nations]] and the [[Helsinki Accords|Helsinki Final Act]].\n\nThis assessment of the Basic Treaty was confirmed in a decision of the [[Federal Constitutional Court]] in 1973;<ref>{{citation |first=Donald P. |last=Kommers |title=The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |year=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press |page= 308 }}</ref>\n{{quote|the German Democratic Republic is in the international-law sense a State and as such a subject of international law. This finding is independent of recognition in international law of the German Democratic Republic by the Federal Republic of Germany.

If the conduct of the Federal Republic of Germany towards the German Democratic Republic is assessed in the light of its d\u00e9tente policy, in particular the conclusion of the Treaty as de facto recognition, then it can only be understood as de facto recognition of a special kind. The special feature of this Treaty is that while it is a bilateral Treaty between two States, to which the rules of international law apply and which like any other international treaty possesses validity, it is between two States that are parts of a still existing, albeit incapable of action as not being reorganized, comprehensive State of the Whole of Germany with a single body politic.<ref>{{citation|url=https://law.utexas.edu/transnational/foreign-law-translations/german/case.php?id=589|title=Texas Law: Foreign Law Translations 1973|publisher=[[University of Texas]]|accessdate=7 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220152049/https://law.utexas.edu/transnational/foreign-law-translations/german/case.php?id=589|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n\nTravel between the GDR and Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary became visa-free from 1972.<ref>{{cite book |author=Eric G.

Instead the SED focused on the progressive heritage of German history, including [[Thomas M\u00fcntzer]]'s role in the [[German Peasants' War]] and the role played by the heroes of the class struggle during Prussia's industrialization.\n\nEspecially after the Ninth Party Congress in 1976, East Germany upheld historical reformers such as [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Karl Freiherr vom Stein]], [[Karl August von Hardenberg]], [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], and [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst]] as examples and role models.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[File:Volkspolizei at the official opening of the Brandenburg Gate.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Police cadets of the East German [[Volkspolizei]] waiting for the official opening of the [[Brandenburg Gate]] on 22 December 1989]]\n\n===''Die Wende'' (German Reunification)===\n{{Main|Die Wende|German reunification}}\n\nIn May 1989, following widespread public anger over the faking of results of local government elections, many citizens applied for exit visas or left the country contrary to GDR laws. The impetus for this exodus of East Germans was the removal of the electrified fence along [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]]'s border with [[Austria]] on 2 May. Although formally the Hungarian frontier was still closed, many East Germans took the opportunity to enter the country via [[Czechoslovakia]], and then make the illegal crossing from Hungary into Austria and West Germany beyond.<ref name=\"Judt\" /> By July, 25,000 East Germans had crossed into Hungary,<ref>[https://archive.is/20050419213613/http://www.germannotes.com/hist_east_wall.shtml The Berlin Wall (1961\u201389)] German Notes.

The major turning point in the exodus came on 10 September, when the Hungarian Foreign Minister [[Gyula Horn]] announced that his country would no longer restrict movement from Hungary into Austria. Within two days 22,000 East Germans crossed into Austria, with tens of thousands following in the coming weeks.<ref name=\"Judt\">{{cite book |title = Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945 |first = Tony |last = Judt |year = 2005 |page = 612 }}</ref>\n\nMany others [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|demonstrated against the ruling party]], especially in the city of [[Leipzig]].

To try to stem the outward flow of the population, the SED proposed a concessionary law loosening restrictions on travel. When this was rejected in the ''Volkskammer'' on 5 November, the Cabinet and the [[Politburo]] of the GDR resigned.<ref name=\"Postwar 614\" /> It left only one avenue open for Krenz and the SED, that of completely abolishing travel restrictions between East and West.\n\nOn 9 November 1989, a few sections of the Berlin Wall were opened, resulting in thousands of East Germans crossing freely into West Berlin and West Germany for the first time in nearly 30 years. Krenz resigned a few days later, and the SED opened negotiations with the leaders of the incipient Democratic movement, [[Neues Forum]], to schedule free elections and begin the process of democratization. As part of this, the SED eliminated the clause in the East German constitution guaranteeing the Communists leadership of the state. This was approved in the ''Volkskammer'' on 1 December 1989 by a vote of 420 to 0.<ref name=\"Postwar\">{{cite book |title = Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945 |first = Tony |last = Judt |year = 2005 |page = 615 }}</ref>\n\nEast Germany held [[East German general election, 1990|its last elections in March 1990]]. The winner was a coalition headed by the East German branch of West Germany's [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], which advocated speedy reunification. Negotiations ([[Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany|2+4]] Talks) were held involving the two German states and the former [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] which led to agreement on the conditions for German unification. By a two-thirds vote in the ''[[Volkskammer]]'' on 23 August 1990, the German Democratic Republic declared its accession to the Federal Republic of Germany. The five original [[New states of Germany|East German states]] that had been abolished in the 1952 redistricting were restored.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> On 3 October 1990, the five states officially joined the Federal Republic of Germany, while East and West Berlin united as a third city-state (in the same manner as [[Bremen]] and [[Hamburg]]). On 1 July a currency union preceded the political union: the \"Ostmark\" was abolished, and the Western German \"Deutsche Mark\" became common currency.\n\nAlthough the Volkskammer's declaration of accession to the Federal Republic had initiated the process of reunification; the act of reunification itself (with its many specific terms, conditions and qualifications; some of which involved amendments to the West German Basic Law) was achieved constitutionally by the subsequent Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990; that is through a binding agreement between the former Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic now recognising each other as separate sovereign states in international law.<ref>{{citation|first=Donald P. |last=Kommers|title=The Constitutional Jursiprudence of the Federal Republic of Germany |date=2012 |publisher=Duke University Press|pages= 309}}</ref> This treaty was then voted into effect prior to the agreed date for Unification by both the Volkskammer and the [[Bundestag]] by the constitutionally required two-thirds majorities; effecting on the one hand, the extinction of the GDR, and on the other, the agreed amendments to the Basic Law of the Federal Republic.\n\nThe great economic and socio-political inequalities between the former Germanies required government subsidy for the full integration of the German Democratic Republic into the Federal Republic of Germany. Because of the resulting [[deindustrialization]] in the former East Germany, the causes of the failure of this integration continue to be debated. Some western commentators claim that the depressed eastern economy is a natural aftereffect of a demonstrably inefficient [[command economy]]. But many East German critics contend that the [[Shock therapy (economics)|shock-therapy]] style of [[privatization]], the artificially high [[rate of exchange]] offered for the [[East German mark|Ostmark]], and the speed with which the entire process was implemented did not leave room for East German enterprises to adapt.<ref>For example, the economist J\u00f6rg Roesler{{snd}}see: J\u00f6rg Roesler: Ein Anderes Deutschland war m\u00f6glich.

It was created in 1946 through the Soviet-directed merger of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) in the Soviet controlled zone. However, the SED quickly transformed into a full-fledged Communist party as the more independent-minded Social Democrats were pushed out.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Eric D.

As in other Soviet-bloc countries, [[Bloc party (politics)|non-communist political parties]] were allowed. Nevertheless, every political party in the GDR was forced to join the [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front of Democratic Germany]], a broad coalition of parties and mass political organisations, including:\n* ''Christlich-Demokratische Union Deutschlands'' ([[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|Christian Democratic Union of Germany]], CDU), which merged with the West German [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] after reunification.\n* ''Demokratische Bauernpartei Deutschlands'' ([[Democratic Farmers' Party of Germany]], DBD).

Another society of note was the [[Society for German-Soviet Friendship]].\n\nAfter the fall of Communism, the SED was renamed the \"[[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]]\" (PDS) which continued for a decade after reunification before merging with the West German [[Labour and Social Justice \u2013 The Electoral Alternative|WASG]] to form the [[Left Party (Germany)|Left Party]] (''Die Linke'').

Verwaltungsbezirke farbig.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Districts of the German Democratic Republic in 1952]]\n{{Main|Administrative divisions of East Germany|List of leaders of administrative divisions of East Germany}}\n\nUntil 1952, East Germany comprised the capital, [[East Berlin]] (though legally it was not fully part of the GDR's territory), and the five [[States of Germany|German states]] of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] (in 1947 renamed Mecklenburg), [[Brandenburg]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Thuringia]], and [[Saxony]], their post-war territorial demarcations approximating the pre-war German demarcations of the [[Middle Germany|Middle German]] ''L\u00e4nder'' (states) and ''Provinzen'' ([[provinces of Prussia]]). The western parts of two provinces, [[Pomerania Province (1815-1945)|Pomerania]] and [[Lower Silesia]], the remainder of which were annexed by Poland, remained in the GDR and were attached to Mecklenburg and Saxony, respectively.\n\nThe [[East German Administrative Reform of 1952]] established 14 ''Bezirke'' (districts) and ''de facto'' disestablished the five ''L\u00e4nder''. The new ''Bezirke'', named after their district centres, were as follows: (i) [[Rostock]], (ii) [[Neubrandenburg]], and (iii) [[Schwerin]] created from the ''Land'' (state) of Mecklenburg; (iv) [[Potsdam]], (v) [[Frankfurt (Oder)]], and (vii) [[Cottbus]] from Brandenburg; (vi) [[Magdeburg]] and (viii) [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] from Saxony-Anhalt; (ix) [[Leipzig]], (xi) [[Dresden]], and (xii) [[Karl-Marx-Stadt]] (Chemnitz until 1953 and again from 1990) from Saxony; and (x) [[Erfurt]], (xiii) [[Gera]], and (xiv) [[Suhl]] from Thuringia.\n\nEast Berlin was made the country's 15th ''Bezirk'' in 1961 but retained special legal status until 1968, when the residents approved the new (draft) constitution. Despite the city as a whole being legally under the control of the [[Allied Control Council]], and diplomatic objections of the Allied governments, the GDR administered the ''Bezirk'' of Berlin as part of its territory.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-0816-002, Leipzig, Karl-Marx-Platz, Brunnen.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|[[City-Hochhaus Leipzig|Uni-Riese]] (''University Giant'') in 1982. Built in 1972, it was once part of the [[University of Leipzig|Karl-Marx-University]] and is Leipzig's tallest building.]]\n\n== Military ==\n[[File:Nva-ehrenwache.jpg|thumb|right|upright|East German ''[[National People's Army|Nationale Volksarmee]]'' changing-of-the-guard ceremony in East Berlin]]\nThe government of East Germany had control over a large number of military and paramilitary organisations through various ministries. Chief among these was the Ministry of National Defence. Because of East Germany's proximity to the West during the [[Cold War]] (1945\u201392), its military forces were among the most advanced of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Defining what was a military force and what was not is a matter of some dispute.\n\n=== National People's Army ===\n{{Main|National People's Army}}\nThe Nationale Volksarmee (NVA) was the largest military organisation in East Germany. It was formed in 1956 from the [[Kasernierte Volkspolizei]] (Barracked People's Police), the military units of the regular police ([[Volkspolizei]]), when East Germany joined the Warsaw Pact. From its creation, it was controlled by the [[Ministry of National Defence (East Germany)]]. It was an all volunteer force until an eighteen-month [[conscription]] period was introduced in 1962. {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\nIt was regarded by NATO officers as the best military in the Warsaw Pact.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/world/east-german-military-warsaw-pact-s-finest.html|title=East German Military: Warsaw Pact's Finest|first1=Bernard E.|last1=Trainor|date=8 November 1988|access-date=31 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801003742/https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/08/world/east-german-military-warsaw-pact-s-finest.html|archive-date=1 August 2018|url-status=live|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>\nThe NVA consisted of the following branches:\n* Army ''([[Landstreitkr\u00e4fte]])''\n* Navy ''([[Volksmarine]]''{{snd}}People's Navy)\n* Air Force ''([[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte der NVA|Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte/Luftverteidigung]])''\n\n=== Border troops ===\n{{Main|Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic}}\n\nThe border troops of the Eastern sector were originally organised as a police force, the Deutsche Grenzpolizei, similar to the [[Bundesgrenzschutz]] in West Germany. It was controlled by the Ministry of the Interior. Following the remilitarisation of East Germany in 1956, the Deutsche Grenzpolizei was transformed into a military force in 1961, modeled after the [[Soviet Border Troops]], and transferred to the Ministry of National Defense, as part of the National People's Army. In 1973, it was separated from the NVA, but it remained under the same ministry. At its peak, it numbered approximately 47,000 men.\n\n=== Volkspolizei ===\n{{Main|Bereitschaftspolizei#In the former German Democratic Republic}}\n\nAfter the NVA was separated from the Volkspolizei in 1956, the Ministry of the Interior maintained its own public order barracked reserve, known as the Volkspolizei-Bereitschaften (VPB). These units were, like the Kasernierte Volkspolizei, equipped as motorised infantry, and they numbered between 12,000 and 15,000 men.\n\n=== Stasi ===\n{{main|Stasi}}\nThe Ministry of State Security (Stasi) included the [[Felix Dzerzhinsky Guards Regiment]], which was mainly involved with facilities security and plain clothes events security. They were the only part of the feared Stasi that was visible to the public, and so were very unpopular within the population. The Stasi numbered around 90,000 men, the Guards Regiment around 11,000-12,000 men.\n\n=== Combat groups of the working class ===\nThe ''[[Kampfgruppen der Arbeiterklasse]]'' (combat groups of the working class) numbered around 400,000 for much of their existence, and were organised around factories. The KdA was the political-military instrument of the SED; it was essentially a \"party Army\". All KdA directives and decisions were made by the ZK's ''[[Politburo|Politb\u00fcro]]''. They received their training from the Volkspolizei and the Ministry of the Interior. Membership was voluntary, but SED members were required to join as part of their membership obligation.\n\n=== Conscientious objection ===\n{{Main|Conscientious objection in East Germany}}\n\nEvery man was required to serve eighteen months of [[conscription|compulsory military service]]; for the medically unqualified and [[conscientious objector]], there were the ''[[Baueinheiten]]'' (construction units), established in 1964, two years after the introduction of conscription, in response to political pressure by the national [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Protestant Church upon the GDR's government. In the 1970s, East German leaders acknowledged that former [[w:en:Construction soldier|construction soldiers]] were at a disadvantage when they rejoined the civilian sphere.\n\n==Foreign policy==\n=== United States as primary threat ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-48550-0036, Besuch Ho Chi Minhs bei Pionieren, bei Berlin.jpg|thumb|North Vietnamese leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] with East German [[Ernst Th\u00e4lmann Pioneer Organisation|Young Pioneers]], 1957]]\n\nThe East German state promoted an \"[[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]]\" line that was reflected in all its media and all the schools.<ref>[[Mark Allinson]], ''Politics and Popular Opinion in East Germany 1945\u20131968'' (2000) ch 1</ref>  This line followed Lenin's theory of imperialism as the highest and last stage of capitalism, and [[Georgi Dimitrov|Dimitrov]]'s theory of fascism as the dictatorship of the most reactionary elements of [[finance capitalism|financial capitalism]]. Popular reaction to these measures was mixed, and Western media penetrated the country both through cross-border television and radio broadcasts from West Germany and from the U.S. propaganda network [[Radio Free Europe]]. Dissidents, particularly professionals, sometimes fled to West Germany, which was relatively easy before the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-vPuoKrNRp8C&pg=PA618 |last=Schnoor |first=Rainer |chapter=The Good and the Bad America: Perceptions of the United States in the GDR |pages=618\u201326 |title=The United States and Germany in the Era of the Cold War, 1945-1990: A Handbook |volume=1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Thomas Adam|title=Germany and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History; a Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&pg=PA1067 |year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=1067|isbn=9781851096282|access-date=14 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506042703/https://books.google.com/books?id=8uxfTF4Lm-kC&pg=PA1067|archive-date=6 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Support of Third World socialist countries ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-Z1014-018, Berlin, Staatsoberhaupt Angolas an der Grenze.jpg|thumb|right|Angola's [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]] during his visit in East Berlin]]\n\nAfter receiving wider international diplomatic recognition in 1972\u201373, the GDR began active cooperation with Third World socialist governments and [[Wars of national liberation|national liberation movements]]. While the USSR was in control of the overall strategy and Cuban armed forces were involved in the actual combat (mostly in the [[People's Republic of Angola]] and socialist [[Derg|Ethiopia]]), the GDR provided experts for military hardware maintenance and personnel training, and oversaw creation of secret security agencies based on its own Stasi model.\n\nAlready in the 1960s contacts were established with Angola's [[MPLA]], Mozambique's [[FRELIMO]] and the [[PAIGC]] in Guinea Bissau and Cape Verde. In the 1970s official cooperation was established with other self-proclaimed socialist governments and people's republics: [[People's Republic of the Congo]], [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]], [[Somali Democratic Republic]], [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|Libya]], and the [[People's Republic of Benin]].\n\nThe first military agreement was signed in 1973 with the People's Republic of the Congo. In 1979 friendship treaties were signed with Angola, Mozambique and Ethiopia.\n\nIt was estimated that altogether, 2000\u20134000 DDR military and security experts were dispatched to Africa. In addition, representatives from African and Arab countries and liberation movements underwent military training in the GDR.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rOoyp-1UOH4C&pg=PA184 |page=184 |title=Moscow's Third World Strategy |isbn=0691023328 |last1=Rubinstein |first1=Alvin Z. |date=16 July 1990 |access-date=26 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191201040239/https://books.google.com/books?id=rOoyp-1UOH4C&pg=PA184 |archive-date=1 December 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===East Germany and the Middle East conflict===\nEast Germany pursued an [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] policy; [[Jeffrey Herf]] argues that East Germany was waging an undeclared war on [[Israel]].<ref name=\"Herf\">{{cite book |last=Herf |first=Jeffrey |author-link=Jeffrey Herf|year=2016 |title=Undeclared Wars with Israel: East Germany and the West German Far Left, 1967\u20131989 |url= |location= |publisher= Cambridge University Press |page= |isbn= 9781107089860 }}</ref> According to Herf, \"the Middle East was one of the crucial battlefields of the global Cold War between the Soviet Union and the West; it was also a region in which East Germany played a salient role in the Soviet bloc\u2019s antagonism toward Israel.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Herf |first1=Jeffrey |author-link1=Jeffrey Herf|year=2014 |title='At War with Israel': East Germany's Key Role in Soviet Policy in the Middle East |url= |journal=[[Journal of Cold War Studies]] |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages= 129\u2013163 |doi=10.1162/JCWS_a_00450}}</ref> While East Germany saw itself as an \"anti-fascist state\", it regarded [[Israel]] as a \"fascist state\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Laqueur |first=Walter |year= 1968 |title= The Road to Jerusalem: The Origins of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1967 |url=https://archive.org/details/roadtojerusalemt00laqu|url-access=registration |location= |publisher=Macmillan |page= [https://archive.org/details/roadtojerusalemt00laqu/page/215 215] |isbn= 978-0025683600 |author-link=Walter Laqueur}}</ref> and East Germany strongly supported the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] in its armed struggle against Israel.

The [[Red Army]] dismantled and transported to Russia the infrastructure and industrial plants of the Soviet Zone of Occupation. By the early 1950s, the reparations were paid in agricultural and industrial products; and [[Lower Silesia]], with its coal mines and [[Szczecin]], an important natural port, were given to Poland by the decision of Stalin and in accordance with [[Potsdam Agreement]].<ref name=\"Norman M. Naimark 1949, pp. 167-9\"/>\n\nThe socialist [[centrally planned economy]] of the German Democratic Republic was like that of the USSR. In 1950, the GDR joined the [[COMECON]] trade bloc. In 1985, [[collective]] (state) enterprises earned 96.7% of the net national income. To ensure stable prices for goods and services, the state paid 80% of basic supply costs. The estimated 1984 per capita income was $9,800 ($22,600 in 2015 dollars). In 1976, the average annual growth of the GDP was approximately five percent. This made East German economy the richest in all of the [[Soviet Bloc]] until reunification in 1990.<ref name=\"Econ stats\">{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1052/is_n4_v110/ai_7373809|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109185421/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1052/is_n4_v110/ai_7373809|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 November 2007|title=Business America.

East Germans with friends or relatives in the West (or with any access to a [[hard currency]]) and the necessary [[Staatsbank]] [[foreign currency account]] could afford Western products and export-quality East German products via [[Intershop]]. Consumer goods also were available, by post, from the Danish [[Jauerfood]], and Genex companies.\n\nThe government used money and prices as political devices, providing highly subsidised prices for a wide range of basic goods and services, in what was known as \"the second pay packet\".<ref>Boroch, Wilfried (1996), \"Social policy as an institutional transformation problem\", ''Transition Economies'', Volume 31, Number 3, pp. 139-146.</ref>  At the production level, artificial prices made for a system of semi-barter and resource hoarding. For the consumer, it led to the substitution of GDR money with time, barter, and hard currencies. The socialist economy became steadily more dependent on financial infusions from hard-currency loans from West Germany. East Germans, meanwhile, came to see their soft currency as worthless relative to the Deutsche Mark (DM).<ref>Jonathan R.

In 1961, the renowned philosophical theologian [[Paul Tillich]] claimed that the Protestant population in East Germany had the most admirable Church in Protestantism, because the Communists there had not been able to win a spiritual victory over them.<ref>Paul Tillich. Christianity and the Encounter of the World Religions (New York: Columbia University Press, 1963), p. 20.</ref> By 1989, membership in the Christian churches dropped significantly. Protestants constituted 25% of the population, Catholics 5%. The share of people who considered themselves non-religious rose from 5% in 1950 to 70% in 1989.\n\n===State atheism===\n{{Further|State atheism|Irreligion in Germany}}\n\nWhen it first came to power, the Communist party asserted the compatibility of Christianity and Marxism and sought Christian participation in the building of socialism. At first the promotion of [[Marxist-Leninist atheism]] received little official attention. In the mid-1950s, as the Cold War heated up, atheism became a topic of major interest for the state, in both domestic and foreign contexts. University chairs and departments devoted to the study of scientific atheism were founded and much literature (scholarly and popular) on the subject was produced.{{by whom|date=September 2015}} This activity subsided in the late 1960s amid perceptions that it had started to become counterproductive. Official and scholarly attention to atheism renewed beginning in 1973, though this time with more emphasis on scholarship and on the training of cadres than on propaganda. Throughout, the attention paid to atheism in East Germany was never intended to jeopardise the cooperation that was desired from those East Germans who were religious.<ref>Fulbrook, \"The Limits Of Totalitarianism: God, State and Society in the GDR\"</ref>\n\n=== Protestantism ===\n{{Main|de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|l1=Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W0613-039, Sitzung des Martin-Luther-Komitees.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|right|A 1980 meeting between representatives of the BEK and Erich Honecker]]\n\nEast Germany, historically, was majority [[Protestant]] (primarily [[Lutheran]]) from the early stages of the [[Protestant Reformation]] onwards. In 1948, freed from the influence of the [[Nazism|Nazi-oriented]] [[German Christians]], [[Lutheran]], [[Calvinism|Reformed]] and [[united and uniting churches|United churches]] from most parts of Germany came together as the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]] (EKD) at the Conference of Eisenach (''Kirchenversammlung von Eisenach'').\n\nIn 1969 the regional Protestant churches in East Germany and [[East Berlin]]{{NoteTag|The Eastern churches were the [[Evangelical Church of Anhalt]], [[Evangelical Church in Berlin, Brandenburg and Silesian Upper Lusatia#Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg]] (EKiBB, East Ambit, for East Berlin and Brandenburg), [[Evangelical Church of Silesia|Evangelical Church of the G\u00f6rlitz Ecclesiastical Region]], [[Pomeranian Evangelical Church#Evangelical Church in Greifswald|Evangelical Church in Greifswald]], [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg]], [[Evangelical-Lutheran Church of Saxony]], [[Evangelical Church of the Church Province of Saxony]] (KPS), [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Thuringia]] and [[Evangelical Church of the Union]] (East Region, for EKiBB-East Ambit, G\u00f6rlitz, Greifswald and KPS, and since 1970 for Anhalt too).}} broke away from the EKD and formed the ''Federation of Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic'' ({{lang-de|link=no|[[:de:Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR|Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR]]}}, BEK), in 1970 also joined by the [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] ''Herrnhuter Br\u00fcdergemeine''. In June 1991, following the [[German reunification]], the BEK churches again merged with the EKD ones.\n\nBetween 1956 and 1971 the [[leadership]] of the East German Lutheran churches gradually changed its relations with the state from hostility to cooperation.<ref>Martin Onnasch, \"Konflikt und Kompromiss: Die Haltung der evangelischen Kirchen zu den gesellschaftlichen Ver\u00e4nderungen in der DDR am Anfang der f\u00fcnfziger Jahre,\" [\"Conflict and compromise: the position of the Protestant churches with regard to social changes in the GDR at the beginning of the 1950s\"], ''Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte / Halbjahresschrift f\u00fcr Theologie und Geschichtswisseschaft,'' 1990, Vol. 3 Issue 1, pp.&nbsp;152\u2013165.</ref> From the founding of the GDR in 1949, the Socialist Unity Party sought to weaken the influence of the church on the rising generation. The church adopted an attitude of confrontation and distance toward the state. Around 1956 this began to develop into a more neutral stance accommodating conditional loyalty. The government was no longer regarded as illegitimate; instead, the church leaders started viewing the authorities as installed by God and, therefore, deserving of obedience by Christians. But on matters where the state demanded something which the churches felt was not in accordance with the will of God, the churches reserved their right to say no. There were both structural and intentional causes behind this development. Structural causes included the hardening of Cold War tensions in Europe in the mid-1950s, which made it clear that the East German state was not temporary. The loss of church members also made it clear to the leaders of the church that they had to come into some kind of dialogue with the state. The intentions behind the change of attitude varied from a traditional liberal Lutheran acceptance of secular power to a positive attitude toward socialist ideas.<ref name=\"Stephen R. Bowers 1982, pp 73-86\">Stephen R.

In 1969 he helped found the ''Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR'' (BEK), where he negotiated with the government while at the same time working within the institutions of this Protestant body. He won the regional elections for the Brandenburg state assembly at the head of the SPD list in 1990. Stolpe remained in the Brandenburg government until he joined the federal government in 2002.\n\nApart from the Protestant state churches ({{lang-de|link=no|[[Landeskirche]]n}}) united in the EKD/BEK and the [[Catholic Church]] there was a number of smaller Protestant bodies, including Protestant Free Churches ({{lang-de|link=no|[[:de:Freikirche|Evangelische Freikirchen]]}}) united in the [[:de:Bund Evangelisch-Freikirchlicher Gemeinden in der DDR|Federation of the Free Protestant Churches in the German Democratic Republic]] and the [[:de:Bund Freier evangelischer Gemeinden in Deutschland|Federation of the Free Protestant Churches in Germany]], as well as [[:de:Evangelisch-Lutherische Freikirche|the Free Lutheran Church]], [[:de:Evangelisch-lutherische (altlutherische) Kirche|the Old Lutheran Church]] and [[:de:Kirchenbund Evangelisch-Reformierter Gemeinden in der DDR|Federation of the Reformed Churches in the German Democratic Republic]]. The [[Moravian Church]] also had its presence as the ''Herrnhuter Br\u00fcdergemeine''.

During the early postwar years, tensions were high. The Catholic Church as a whole (and particularly the bishops) resisted both the East German state and Marxist ideology. The state allowed the bishops to lodge protests, which they did on issues such as abortion.<ref name=\"Stephen R. Bowers 1982, pp 73-86\"/>\n\nAfter 1945 the Church did fairly well in integrating Catholic exiles from lands to the east (which mostly became part of Poland) and in adjusting its institutional structures to meet the needs of a church within an officially atheist society. This meant an increasingly hierarchical church structure, whereas in the area of religious education, press, and youth organisations, a system of temporary staff was developed, one that took into account the special situation of [[Caritas International|Caritas]], a Catholic charity organisation. By 1950, therefore, there existed a Catholic subsociety that was well adjusted to prevailing specific conditions and capable of maintaining Catholic identity.<ref>{{cite book|author= Bernd Schaefer|title= The East German State and the Catholic Church, 1945-1989|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=96QzpCRH2agC|year= 2010|publisher= Berghahn Books|isbn= 9781845458522|access-date= 14 October 2015|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160603062014/https://books.google.com/books?id=96QzpCRH2agC|archive-date= 3 June 2016|url-status= live}} ch 1</ref>{{Page needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nWith a generational change in the episcopacy taking place in the early 1980s, the state hoped for better relations with the new bishops, but the new bishops instead began holding unauthorised mass meetings, promoting international ties in discussions with theologians abroad, and hosting ecumenical conferences. The new bishops became less politically oriented and more involved in pastoral care and attention to spiritual concerns.

However, Pence and Betts argue, the majority of East Germans over time increasingly regarded the state's ideals to be hollow, though there was also a substantial number of East Germans who regarded their culture as having a healthier, more authentic mentality than that of West Germany.<ref>Pence and Betts, ''Socialist modern: East German everyday culture and politics''. page 37 for Maaz, 58.</ref>\n\nGDR culture and politics were limited by the harsh [[Censorship in East Germany|censorship]].<ref name=\"ed\">{{cite web|url=http://www.blogs.hss.ed.ac.uk/whos-watching-who/tales-archive/secrets-of-east-german-censorship/|website=blogs.hss.ed.ac.uk|title=The Secret of East German Censorship \u2014 Who's Watching Who?|accessdate=15 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216091214/http://www.blogs.hss.ed.ac.uk/whos-watching-who/tales-archive/secrets-of-east-german-censorship/|archive-date=16 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-F0321-0204-001, Berlin, Volksb\u00fchne, Oktoberklub, Hartmut K\u00f6nig.jpg|thumb|The ''Oktoberklub'' in 1967]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-W0115-047, Berlin, Frank Sch\u00f6bel bei Autogrammstunde.jpg|thumb|Pop singer [[Frank Sch\u00f6bel]] (center) giving autographs in 1980]]\n\nThe [[Puhdys]] and [[Karat (band)|Karat]] were some of the most popular mainstream bands in East Germany.

There were approximately 3.6&nbsp;million telephones in usage (21.8 for every 100 inhabitants), and 16,476 [[Teletypewriter message|Telex]] stations. Both of these networks were run by the [[Deutsche Post der DDR]] (East German Post Office). East Germany was assigned telephone country code [[+37]]; in 1991, several months after reunification, East German telephone exchanges were incorporated into country code +49.\n\nAn unusual feature of the telephone network was that, in most cases, [[direct distance dialing]] for [[long-distance call]]s was not possible. Although [[area codes]] were assigned to all major towns and cities, they were only used for switching international calls. Instead, each location had its own list of dialing codes with shorter codes for [[local call]]s and longer codes for long-distance calls. After unification, the existing network was largely replaced, and area codes and dialing became standardised.\n\nIn 1976 East Germany inaugurated the operation of a ground-based radio station at [[F\u00fcrstenwalde]] for the purpose of relaying and receiving communications from Soviet satellites and to serve as a participant in the international telecommunications organization established by the Soviet government, [[Intersputnik]].\n\n== Official and public holidays ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Jiangxi is also alternately called ''Ganpo Dadi'' ({{lang|zh|\u8d1b\u9131\u5927\u5730}}) which literally means the \"Great Land of Gan and [[Poyang Lake|Po]]\".\n\nAfter the fall of the Qing dynasty, Jiangxi became one of the earliest bases for the [[Communists]] and many peasants were recruited to join the growing people's revolution. The [[Nanchang Uprising]] took place in Jiangxi on August 1, 1927, during the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Later the Communist leadership hid in the mountains of southern and western Jiangxi, hiding from the Kuomintang's attempts to eradicate them. In 1931, the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]]'s government was established in [[Ruijin]], which is sometimes called the \"Former Red Capital\" ({{lang|zh-hans|\u7ea2\u8272\u6545\u90fd}}, Gan: F\u016bng-set K\u016b-tu), or just the \"Red Capital\". In 1935, after complete encirclement by the Nationalist forces, the Communists broke through and began the [[Long March]] to [[Yan'an]].\n\nThe southern half of Jiangxi is hilly and mountainous, with ranges and valleys interspersed; notable mountains and mountains ranges include [[Mount Lu]], the [[Jinggang Mountains]] and [[Mount Sanqing]]. The northern half is comparatively lower in altitude. The [[Gan River]] flows through the province.\n\nAlthough the majority of Jiangxi's population is [[Han Chinese]], Jiangxi is linguistically diverse. It is considered the center of [[Gan Chinese]]; [[Hakka Chinese]], a close variety of Gan, is also spoken to some degree. Jiangxi is rich in mineral resources, leading the provinces of China in deposits of [[copper]], [[tungsten]], [[gold]], [[silver]], [[uranium]], [[thorium]], [[tantalum]], [[niobium]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Jiangxi}}\nJiangxi is centered on the [[Gan River]] valley, which historically provided the main north-south transport route of south China. The corridor along the Gan River is one of the few easily traveled routes through the otherwise mountainous and rugged terrain of the south-eastern mountains. This open corridor was the primary route for trade and communication between the [[North China Plain]] and the [[Yangtze River]] valley in the north and the territory of modern [[Guangdong]] province in the south. As a result, Jiangxi has been strategically important throughout much of China's history.\n\nJiangxi was outside the sphere of influence of early Chinese civilization during the [[Shang dynasty]] (16th to 11th centuries BC). It is likely that peoples collectively known as the [[Baiyue]] inhabited the region. During the [[Spring and Autumn period]], the northern part of modern Jiangxi formed the western frontier of the state of [[Wu (state)|Wu]]. After Wu was conquered by the [[Yue (state)|state of Yue]] (a power based in modern northern [[Zhejiang]]) in 473 BC, the state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] (based in modern [[Hubei]]) took over northern Jiangxi and there may have been some Yue influence in the south. Chu subjugated Yue in 333 BC. In 223 BC, when [[Qin (state)|Qin]] conquered Chu, a majority of the Jiangxi area was recorded to be put under Jiujiang Commandary situated in [[Shou County|Shouchun]] ({{lang|zh-hant|\u58fd\u6625}}).<ref>http://218.65.88.149:8080/was40/detail?record=1&primarykeyvalue=%E9%A2%98%E5%90%8D%3D%E8%B1%AB%E7%AB%A0%E6%95%85%E9%83%A1&channelid=7274{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> However the commandary was ineffective and ended shortly when Qin falls.\n\n[[Yuzhang Commandery]] ({{lang|zh|\u8c6b\u7ae0}}, Gan: \u00cc-zong) was established in Jiangxi at the beginning of the [[Han dynasty]], possibly before the death of [[Xiang Yu]] in 202 BC, and it's also the very first commandery set up by Chinese dynasty in Jiangxi. It was named after the Yuzhang River ({{lang|zh|\u8c6b\u7ae0\u6c5f}}, Gan: \u00cc-zong Kong), the original name of Gan River. \"Gan\" has become the abbreviation of the province. In 201, eight counties were added to the original seven of Qin,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} and three more were established in later years. Throughout most of the Han dynasty the commandery's eighteen counties covered most of the modern province of Jiangxi. The county seats of Nanchang, Gan, Yudu, Luling among others were located at the sites of modern major cities. Other counties, however, have been moved or abolished in later centuries.\n\nUnder the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] of the [[Han dynasty]], Yuzhang Commandery was assigned to [[Yangzhou Province]], as part of a trend to establish provinces (''[[zhou (political division)|zhou]]'') all across China. In 291 AD, during the [[Western Jin dynasty]], Jiangxi became its own ''Zhou'' called Jiangzhou ({{lang|zh|\u6c5f\u5dde}}, Gan: Kong-chiu). During the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], Jiangxi was under the control of the southern dynasties, and the number of ''zhou'' slowly grew.\n\nDuring the [[Sui dynasty]], there were seven [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]] and twenty-four counties in Jiangxi. During the [[Tang dynasty]], another commandery and fourteen counties were added. Commanderies were then abolished, becoming ''zhou'' (henceforth translated as \"prefectures\" rather than \"provinces\").\n\n[[Circuit (administrative division)|Circuits]] were established during the [[Tang dynasty]] as a new top-level administrative division. At first Jiangxi was part of the [[Jiangnan Circuit]] (lit. \"Circuit south of the Yangtze\"). In 733, this circuit was divided into western and eastern halves. Jiangxi was found in the western half, which was called [[Jiangnanxi Circuit]] (lit. \"Western circuits south of the Yangtze\"). This is the source of the modern name \"Jiangxi\".\n\nThe [[Tang dynasty]] collapsed in 907, heralding the division of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] period. Jiangxi first belonged to [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu]] ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5433}}, Gan: Ng), then to [[Southern Tang]] ({{lang|zh|\u5357\u5510}}, Gan: N\u0101m-th\u00f3ng). Both states were based in modern-day [[Nanjing]], further down the [[Yangtze River]].\n\nDuring the [[Song dynasty]], Jiangnanxi Circuit was reestablished with nine prefectures and four army districts (with sixty-eight districts).\n\nDuring the [[Yuan dynasty]], the circuit was divided into thirteen different circuits, and Jiangxi Province was established for the first time. This province also included the majority of modern [[Guangdong]]. Jiangxi acquired (more or less) its modern borders during the [[Ming dynasty]] after [[Guangdong]] was separated out. There has been little change to the borders of Jiangxi since.\n\nAfter the fall of the Qing dynasty, Jiangxi became one of the earliest bases for the [[Communists]] and many peasants were recruited to join the growing people's revolution. The [[Nanchang Uprising]] took place in Jiangxi on August 1, 1927, during the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Later the Communist leadership hid in the mountains of southern and western Jiangxi, hiding from the Kuomintang's attempts to eradicate them. In 1931, the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]]'s government was established in [[Ruijin]], which is sometimes called the \"Former Red Capital\" ({{lang|zh-hans|\u7ea2\u8272\u6545\u90fd}}, Gan: F\u016bng-set K\u016b-tu), or just the \"Red Capital\". In 1935, after complete encirclement by the Nationalist forces, the Communists broke through and began the [[Long March]] to [[Yan'an]].\n\nFrom 1930 to 1934, the National Government carried out five military campaigns against the Jiangxi Soviet area. Its brutal two-party battles and cleansing (including the internal cleansing of the Red Army and the cleaning of the post-war government) caused a large number of deaths or escapes, causing the population of Jiangxi to drop by 40%, until only 13.8 million people were left in 1936.\n\nIn 1936, after the opening of the [[Guangzhou\u2013Hankou railway|Yuehan Railway]] in Hunan, Jiangxi lost its important position regarding north-south traffic. In 1937, the east-west Zhegan Railway was opened to traffic, which changed the original traffic patterns in Jiangxi to a large extent. The Jiujiang Port (\u4e5d\u6c5f\u6e2f) began to decline in importance.\n\nFollowing the [[Doolittle Raid]] during [[World War II]], most of the B-25 American crews that came down in China eventually made it to safety with the help of Chinese civilians and soldiers. The Chinese people who helped them, however, paid dearly for sheltering the Americans.

There are also [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]], and [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] dialects spoken along the northern border.\n\n[[Ganju (Jiangxi Opera)|Ganju]] (Jiangxi opera) is the type of [[Chinese opera]] performed in Jiangxi.\n\nAlthough little known outside of the province, [[Jiangxi cuisine]] is rich and distinctive. Flavors are some of the strongest in China, with heavy use of [[chili pepper]]s and especially [[pickling|pickled]] and [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] products.\n\n[[Jingdezhen]] is widely regarded as the producer of the best [[porcelain]] in China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caixinglobal.com/2017-09-15/jingdezhen-where-emperors-got-their-porcelain-101145647.html|title=Jingdezhen: Where Emperors Got Their Porcelain - Caixin Global|website=www.caixinglobal.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi also was a historical center of [[Chan Buddhism]].\n\nProminent examples of [[Hakka architecture]] can be found in Jiangxi.\n\n==Transportation==\nAs of January 2015, Jiangxi had two [[Yangtze River bridges and tunnels|Yangtze River crossings]], both in Jiujiang.\n\n===Rail===\nThe [[Beijing\u2013Kowloon Railway]] and [[Shanghai\u2013Kunming Railway]] crisscross the province and intersect at Nanchang, which also has a [[Nanchang\u2013Jiujiang Intercity Railway|high-speed rail link to Jiujiang]]. In addition, Jiangxi is connected by rail to Anhui Province via the [[Anhui\u2013Jiangxi Railway|Anhui\u2013Jiangxi]] and [[Tongling\u2013Jiujiang Railway]]s; to Hubei via the [[Wuhan\u2013Jiujiang Railway]]; and to Fujian via the [[Yingtan\u2013Xiamen Railway|Yingtan\u2013Xiamen]], [[Hengfeng\u2013Nanping Railway|Hengfeng\u2013Nanping]], [[Ganzhou\u2013Longyan Railway|Ganzhou\u2013Longyan]] and [[Xiangtang\u2013Putian Railway]]s.\n\n==Tourism==\n[[Image:Mount Lushan - fog.JPG|right|thumb|The mountain peaks of Lushan National Park.]] \nThere are several famous mountains in Jiangxi Province, including Mount Lu in Jiujiang city, Mount jinggang at the boarder of jiangxi province and Hunan province, Mount Sanqing in Yushan county...\n\nNear the northern port city of [[Jiujiang]] lies the well-known resort area of [[Mount Lu]].

The region has many temples, cave complexes, mountains and villages.\n\nThe [[Lushan National Park]] has been a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] since 1996.\n\nIn 2007, Jiangxi (specifically the [[Zhelin Reservoir]], about {{Convert|40|km|mi}} from Nanchang) was the filming location for the fifteenth series of the American TV show ''[[Survivor: China|Survivor]]''.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nThe mountainous terrain and large forest coverage of Jiangxi has made it historically one of the more wild places of central China. [[South China tiger]]s have been seen as recently as fifteen or twenty years ago and projects are underway to document evidence of existing tigers, if there are any. Several mountain areas along the northern border with Hunan and Hubei are potential sites for \"wilderness\" preserves specifically for protecting or even reintroducing tigers.\n\nOther wildlife, though not plentiful, are more numerous in Jiangxi than in many other developed areas of China. Numerous species of birds are common, especially around the marshes of Lake Poyang in the north. Though protected, mammals such as [[muntjac]], wild boar, civet cats, and [[pangolin]]s, are still common enough that they'll even occasionally be seen in markets for sale as game meat, or possibly even in a forest.\n\nThe late [[Paleocene]] [[mesonychid]], ''[[Jiangxia chaotoensis]]'' was found in the province, and named after it.\n\n==Education==\n\n===Colleges and universities===\n{{main|List

Jiangxi is also alternately called ''Ganpo Dadi'' ({{lang|zh|\u8d1b\u9131\u5927\u5730}}) which literally means the \"Great Land of Gan and [[Poyang Lake|Po]]\".\n\nAfter the fall of the Qing dynasty, Jiangxi became one of the earliest bases for the [[Communists]] and many peasants were recruited to join the growing people's revolution. The [[Nanchang Uprising]] took place in Jiangxi on August 1, 1927, during the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Later the Communist leadership hid in the mountains of southern and western Jiangxi, hiding from the Kuomintang's attempts to eradicate them. In 1931, the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]]'s government was established in [[Ruijin]], which is sometimes called the \"Former Red Capital\" ({{lang|zh-hans|\u7ea2\u8272\u6545\u90fd}}, Gan: F\u016bng-set K\u016b-tu), or just the \"Red Capital\". In 1935, after complete encirclement by the Nationalist forces, the Communists broke through and began the [[Long March]] to [[Yan'an]].\n\nThe southern half of Jiangxi is hilly and mountainous, with ranges and valleys interspersed; notable mountains and mountains ranges include [[Mount Lu]], the [[Jinggang Mountains]] and [[Mount Sanqing]]. The northern half is comparatively lower in altitude. The [[Gan River]] flows through the province.\n\nAlthough the majority of Jiangxi's population is [[Han Chinese]], Jiangxi is linguistically diverse. It is considered the center of [[Gan Chinese]]; [[Hakka Chinese]], a close variety of Gan, is also spoken to some degree. Jiangxi is rich in mineral resources, leading the provinces of China in deposits of [[copper]], [[tungsten]], [[gold]], [[silver]], [[uranium]], [[thorium]], [[tantalum]], [[niobium]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Jiangxi}}\nJiangxi is centered on the [[Gan River]] valley, which historically provided the main north-south transport route of south China. The corridor along the Gan River is one of the few easily traveled routes through the otherwise mountainous and rugged terrain of the south-eastern mountains. This open corridor was the primary route for trade and communication between the [[North China Plain]] and the [[Yangtze River]] valley in the north and the territory of modern [[Guangdong]] province in the south. As a result, Jiangxi has been strategically important throughout much of China's history.\n\nJiangxi was outside the sphere of influence of early Chinese civilization during the [[Shang dynasty]] (16th to 11th centuries BC). It is likely that peoples collectively known as the [[Baiyue]] inhabited the region. During the [[Spring and Autumn period]], the northern part of modern Jiangxi formed the western frontier of the state of [[Wu (state)|Wu]]. After Wu was conquered by the [[Yue (state)|state of Yue]] (a power based in modern northern [[Zhejiang]]) in 473 BC, the state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] (based in modern [[Hubei]]) took over northern Jiangxi and there may have been some Yue influence in the south. Chu subjugated Yue in 333 BC. In 223 BC, when [[Qin (state)|Qin]] conquered Chu, a majority of the Jiangxi area was recorded to be put under Jiujiang Commandary situated in [[Shou County|Shouchun]] ({{lang|zh-hant|\u58fd\u6625}}).<ref>http://218.65.88.149:8080/was40/detail?record=1&primarykeyvalue=%E9%A2%98%E5%90%8D%3D%E8%B1%AB%E7%AB%A0%E6%95%85%E9%83%A1&channelid=7274{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> However the commandary was ineffective and ended shortly when Qin falls.\n\n[[Yuzhang Commandery]] ({{lang|zh|\u8c6b\u7ae0}}, Gan: \u00cc-zong) was established in Jiangxi at the beginning of the [[Han dynasty]], possibly before the death of [[Xiang Yu]] in 202 BC, and it's also the very first commandery set up by Chinese dynasty in Jiangxi. It was named after the Yuzhang River ({{lang|zh|\u8c6b\u7ae0\u6c5f}}, Gan: \u00cc-zong Kong), the original name of Gan River. \"Gan\" has become the abbreviation of the province. In 201, eight counties were added to the original seven of Qin,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} and three more were established in later years. Throughout most of the Han dynasty the commandery's eighteen counties covered most of the modern province of Jiangxi. The county seats of Nanchang, Gan, Yudu, Luling among others were located at the sites of modern major cities. Other counties, however, have been moved or abolished in later centuries.\n\nUnder the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] of the [[Han dynasty]], Yuzhang Commandery was assigned to [[Yangzhou Province]], as part of a trend to establish provinces (''[[zhou (political division)|zhou]]'') all across China. In 291 AD, during the [[Western Jin dynasty]], Jiangxi became its own ''Zhou'' called Jiangzhou ({{lang|zh|\u6c5f\u5dde}}, Gan: Kong-chiu). During the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]], Jiangxi was under the control of the southern dynasties, and the number of ''zhou'' slowly grew.\n\nDuring the [[Sui dynasty]], there were seven [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]] and twenty-four counties in Jiangxi. During the [[Tang dynasty]], another commandery and fourteen counties were added. Commanderies were then abolished, becoming ''zhou'' (henceforth translated as \"prefectures\" rather than \"provinces\").\n\n[[Circuit (administrative division)|Circuits]] were established during the [[Tang dynasty]] as a new top-level administrative division. At first Jiangxi was part of the [[Jiangnan Circuit]] (lit. \"Circuit south of the Yangtze\"). In 733, this circuit was divided into western and eastern halves. Jiangxi was found in the western half, which was called [[Jiangnanxi Circuit]] (lit. \"Western circuits south of the Yangtze\"). This is the source of the modern name \"Jiangxi\".\n\nThe [[Tang dynasty]] collapsed in 907, heralding the division of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] period. Jiangxi first belonged to [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|Wu]] ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5433}}, Gan: Ng), then to [[Southern Tang]] ({{lang|zh|\u5357\u5510}}, Gan: N\u0101m-th\u00f3ng). Both states were based in modern-day [[Nanjing]], further down the [[Yangtze River]].\n\nDuring the [[Song dynasty]], Jiangnanxi Circuit was reestablished with nine prefectures and four army districts (with sixty-eight districts).\n\nDuring the [[Yuan dynasty]], the circuit was divided into thirteen different circuits, and Jiangxi Province was established for the first time. This province also included the majority of modern [[Guangdong]]. Jiangxi acquired (more or less) its modern borders during the [[Ming dynasty]] after [[Guangdong]] was separated out. There has been little change to the borders of Jiangxi since.\n\nAfter the fall of the Qing dynasty, Jiangxi became one of the earliest bases for the [[Communists]] and many peasants were recruited to join the growing people's revolution. The [[Nanchang Uprising]] took place in Jiangxi on August 1, 1927, during the [[Chinese Civil War]]. Later the Communist leadership hid in the mountains of southern and western Jiangxi, hiding from the Kuomintang's attempts to eradicate them. In 1931, the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]]'s government was established in [[Ruijin]], which is sometimes called the \"Former Red Capital\" ({{lang|zh-hans|\u7ea2\u8272\u6545\u90fd}}, Gan: F\u016bng-set K\u016b-tu), or just the \"Red Capital\". In 1935, after complete encirclement by the Nationalist forces, the Communists broke through and began the [[Long March]] to [[Yan'an]].\n\nFrom 1930 to 1934, the National Government carried out five military campaigns against the Jiangxi Soviet area. Its brutal two-party battles and cleansing (including the internal cleansing of the Red Army and the cleaning of the post-war government) caused a large number of deaths or escapes, causing the population of Jiangxi to drop by 40%, until only 13.8 million people were left in 1936.\n\nIn 1936, after the opening of the [[Guangzhou\u2013Hankou railway|Yuehan Railway]] in Hunan, Jiangxi lost its important position regarding north-south traffic. In 1937, the east-west Zhegan Railway was opened to traffic, which changed the original traffic patterns in Jiangxi to a large extent. The Jiujiang Port (\u4e5d\u6c5f\u6e2f) began to decline in importance.\n\nFollowing the [[Doolittle Raid]] during [[World War II]], most of the B-25 American crews that came down in China eventually made it to safety with the help of Chinese civilians and soldiers. The Chinese people who helped them, however, paid dearly for sheltering the Americans. The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] began the [[Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign]] to intimidate the Chinese from helping downed American airmen. The Japanese killed an estimated 250,000 civilians while searching for Doolittle\u2019s men.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/perilousfight/ PBS Perilous Flight] {{verify source |date=August 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted ([[Special:Diff/901528271]]) by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite at [[Special:Permalink/860479489]] cite #5 - please verify the cite's accuracy and remove this {verify source} template.

It has an altitude of {{convert|2157|m}}.\n\nThe [[Gan River]] dominates the province, flowing through the entire length of the province from south to north. It enters [[Lake Poyang]] in the north, the largest freshwater lake of China; that lake in turn empties into the [[Yangtze River]], which forms part of the northern border of Jiangxi. Important [[Reservoir (water)|reservoirs]] include the [[Xiushui Tuolin Reservoir]] in the northwest of the province on the [[Xiushui River]], and the [[:zh:\u4e07\u5b89\u6c34\u5e93|Wan'an Reservoir(zh)]] in the upper section of the Gan.\n\nJiangxi has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'' under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]), with short, cool, damp winters, and very hot, humid summers. Average temperatures are about {{convert|3|to|9|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in January and {{convert|27|to|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in July. Annual precipitation is {{convert|1200|to|1900|mm|in}}, much of it falling in the heavy rains occurring in late spring and summer.\n\n[[Nanchang]], the provincial capital and the most densely populated city, is one of the largest Chinese [[metropolis]]es.

[[South China tiger]]s have been seen as recently as fifteen or twenty years ago and projects are underway to document evidence of existing tigers, if there are any. Several mountain areas along the northern border with Hunan and Hubei are potential sites for \"wilderness\" preserves specifically for protecting or even reintroducing tigers.\n\nOther wildlife, though not plentiful, are more numerous in Jiangxi than in many other developed areas of China. Numerous species of birds are common, especially around the marshes of Lake Poyang in the north. Though protected, mammals such as [[muntjac]], wild boar, civet cats, and [[pangolin]]s, are still common enough that they'll even occasionally be seen in markets for sale as game meat, or possibly even in a forest.\n\nThe late [[Paleocene]] [[mesonychid]], ''[[Jiangxia chaotoensis]]'' was found in the province, and named after it.\n\n==Education==\n\n===Colleges and universities===\n{{main|List of universities and colleges in Jiangxi}}\n*[[Jiangxi College Of Foreign Studies]]\n* [[East China Institute of Technology]]\n* [[East China Jiaotong University]]\n* [[Jiangxi Agricultural University]]\n* [[Jiangxi Institute of Education]]\n* [[Jiangxi Normal University]]\n* [[Jiangxi Science and Technology Normal University]]\n* [[Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics]]\n* [[Jingdezhen Ceramic Institute]]\n* [[Jinggangshan University]]\n* [[Jiujiang Financial and Economic College]]\n* [[Jiujiang Medical College]]\n* [[Jiujiang Teachers College]]\n* [[Nanchang Institute of Technology]]\n* [[Nanchang Hangkong University]]\n* [[Nanchang University]]\n*[[Yichun University]]\n\n==Sister Provinces==\n*{{flagdeco|JPN}} [[Okayama Prefecture]], Japan\n*{{flagdeco|PHL}} [[Bohol]], Philippines\n*{{flagdeco|DEU}} [[Hesse]], Germany\n*{{flagdeco|US}} [[Kentucky]], United States\n*{{flagdeco|BRA}} [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], Brazil<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.noticias.ms.gov.br/index.php?templat=vis&site=136&id_comp=1068&id_reg=85352&voltar=home&site_reg=136&id_comp_orig=1068 |title=:: Not\u00edcias MS |publisher=Noticias.ms.gov.br |date=2009-10-23 |accessdate=2012-12-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228221504/http://www.noticias.ms.gov.br/index.php?templat=vis&site=136&id_comp=1068&id_reg=85352&voltar=home&site_reg=136&id_comp_orig=1068 |archive-date=2012-02-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n*{{flagdeco|MYS}} [[Sabah]], Malaysia<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/04/21/sabah-and-china-jiangxi-look-to-become-sister-provinces-says-shafie/|title=Sabah and China's Jiangxi look to become 'sister provinces', says Shafie|author=Muguntan Vanar|work=The Star|date=21 April 2019|accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theborneopost.com/2019/04/22/sabah-jiangxi-sign-friendship-pact/|title=Sabah, Jiangxi sign friendship pact|publisher=The Borneo Post|date=22 April 2019|accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|China}}\n* [[Major national historical and cultural sites (Jiangxi)|Major national historical and cultural sites in Jiangxi]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note|1}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons|Jiangxi}}\n{{EB1911 Poster|Kiang-Si}}\n* {{Wikivoyage-inline}}\n* {{in lang|zh}} [http://www.jiangxi.gov.cn Jiangxi Government website]\n* [http://www.wdl.org/en/item/3049 \"Map of Jiangxi Province with Explanations\"] from 1573 CE - 1620 CE\n* [http://info.hktdc.com/mktprof/china/jiangxi.htm Economic profile for Jiangxi] at [[Hong Kong Trade Development Council|HKTDC]]\n\n{{Geographic location\n|Centre    = Jiangxi\n|North     = [[Anhui]]\n|Northeast = [[Zhejiang]]\n|East      = [[Fujian]]\n|Southeast = \n|South     = [[Guangdong]]\n|Southwest = \n|West      = [[Hunan]]\n|Northwest = [[Hubei]]\n}}\n\n{{Jiangxi topics}}\n{{Jiangxi}}\n{{Province-level divisions of the People's Republic of China}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Jiangxi| ]]\n[[Category:Provinces of the People's Republic of China]]\n[[Category:East China]]\n", "name_user": "Bellowhead678", "label": "safe", "comment": "inclduing->including -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangxi"}

Conceived with a silver spoon in her mouth, Natasha has every one of the enhancements one could wish for in their life yet the one thing she wishes the most for - an existence of bliss and love with her parents which is absent as they are regularly inconsistent with each other. Natasha venerates her companion Sumbal's parents Farooq Sahib and Shahnaz Begum, who are an impeccable photo of a glad couple and who have made their home a shelter of affection, care and mutual respect.

The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Jessica Chastain]], [[Viola Davis]], [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], [[Allison Janney]], [[Octavia Spencer]] and [[Emma Stone]]. The film and novel recount the story of a young white woman and aspiring journalist Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan.<ref>{{cite web |title=Viola Davis on making 'The Help' work |url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/viola-davis-on-making-the-help-work-1.3075367 |publisher=JOHN ANDERSON}}</ref> The story focuses on her relationship with two black maids, Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson, during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in 1963 [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. In an attempt to become a legitimate journalist and writer, Skeeter decides to write a book from the point of view of the maids, exposing the [[racism in the United States|racism]] they are faced with as they work for white families. [[Domestic worker#Black domestic workers in the 1960 America|Black domestic workers in 1960s America]] were referred to as \"the help\", hence the title of the journalistic expose, the novel and the film.\n\n[[DreamWorks Pictures]] acquired the [[Film rights|screen rights]] to Stockett's novel in March 2010 and quickly commissioned the film with [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], [[Michael Barnathan]], and [[Brunson Green]] as producers. The film's casting began later that month, with [[principal photography]] following four months after in Mississippi. The film is an international co-production between companies based in the United States, India, and the United Arab Emirates.<ref name=\"bfi\"/>\n\n[[Touchstone Pictures]] released ''The Help'' worldwide, with a [[Wide release|general theatrical release]] in North America on August 10, 2011. The film was a critical and commercial success, receiving positive reviews and grossing $216 million in worldwide box office.<ref name=\"Box Office Mojo\" /> ''The Help'' received four [[Academy Award]] nominations including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Davis, and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for both Chastain and Spencer, with the latter winning the award. The film also won the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary must be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn 1963, Aibileen Clark is an African-American maid in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. She works for socialite Elizabeth Leefolt and cares for the Leefolts' daughter Mae Mobley, whom Elizabeth neglects. Aibileen's best friend and fellow maid Minny Jackson works for Mrs. Walters, whose daughter Hilly Holbrook leads the women's socialite group.\n\nEugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan, a recent graduate of [[University of Mississippi|Ole Miss]] and an aspiring writer, is a friend of Elizabeth. Skeeter is uncomfortable with her social circle's racist attitudes toward their maids, including Hilly's insistence on installing separate bathrooms for the help. Skeeter learns that her mother Charlotte fired Constantine, the maid who raised Skeeter, and decides to write a book of interviews with African-American maids working for white families.\n\nMinny is fired by Hilly for using the guest bathroom and is rendered unemployable, but finds a job with Celia Foote, a housewife ostracized by the other socialites. Celia treats Minny with respect and they become friends, but keep Minny's employment secret from Celia's husband Johnny, who is Hilly\u2019s former beau. Celia suffers a miscarriage, and reveals to Minny that she has had two previous miscarriages.\n\nSkeeter reaches out to Aibileen, who eventually agrees to be interviewed, as does Minny. Elaine Stein, Skeeter's editor at [[Harper (publisher)|Harper & Row]], advises her that the stories of two maids are not enough, but fear of retribution prevents other maids from coming forward. Aibileen tells Skeeter about her struggle to cope with the death of her son, and believes the book will help her find closure.\n\nHilly refuses to advance money to her replacement maid, Yule May, who is struggling to send her twin sons to college. Yule May discovers a discarded ring and pawns it, but is brutally arrested as Hilly watches. This incident and the assassination of [[Medgar Evers]] inspire more maids to tell Skeeter their stories.\n\nFollowing the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], Skeeter, Aibileen, and Minny fear the maids' stories will be recognized. Minny reveals the \"terrible awful\" she did to Hilly: after her termination, Minny brought Hilly her famous chocolate pie, but revealed that she baked her own [[excrement]] into the pie after Hilly had finished two slices. The inclusion of this incident in the book would prompt Hilly to crusade in denial that the book is about Jackson.\n\nSkeeter confronts her mother about firing Constantine, and Charlotte reveals that during a [[Daughters of America]] luncheon, Constantine's daughter Rachel disobeyed Charlotte's orders to enter through the kitchen, embarrassing her. To save face, Charlotte fired Constantine; Rachel took Constantine to Chicago, where she later died.\n \nThe book is published anonymously and is a success. Minny reveals the \"terrible awful\" to Celia, who finally sees what a manipulative bully Hilly is, and writes a cheque to one of Hilly's charity groups, made out to \"Two Slice Hilly\". Incensed, Hilly threatens Skeeter with legal proceedings, but she reminds Hilly that the incident is in chapter 12. Charlotte intervenes, letting on that she knows about the \"terrible awful\", and orders Hilly off the property. Charlotte and Skeeter reconcile when Charlotte tells her how proud she is of her courage, the book, and her job offer in New York City.\n\nJohnny reveals to Minny that he knows she has been working at his house, and how appreciative he is for her friendship with Celia, how it saved her life, and that she has permanent job security. This kindness gives Minny the courage to take her children and leave her abusive husband.\n\nSeeking revenge for helping Skeeter, Hilly pressures Elizabeth to terminate Aibileen, framing her for theft. Aibileen stands up to Hilly, who breaks down and storms out, and Elizabeth orders Aibileen to leave. Aibileen bids farewell to Mae Mobley and pleads with Elizabeth to give her daughter a chance, as Elizabeth begins to cry. Aibileen reflects on the ordeal and finds closure, looking to her own future as a writer.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main cast===\n*[[Emma Stone]] as Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan\n*[[Viola Davis]] as Aibileen Clark\n*[[Octavia Spencer]] as Minny Jackson\n*[[Bryce Dallas Howard]] as Hillary \"Hilly\" Walters Holbrook\n*[[Jessica Chastain]] as Celia Rae Foote\n*[[Allison Janney]] as Charlotte Phelan\n\n===Supporting cast===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Ahna O'Reilly]] as Elizabeth Leefolt\n*[[Sissy Spacek]] as Mrs. Walters\n*[[Chris Lowell]] as Stuart Whitworth\n*[[Mike Vogel]] as Jonathan \"Johnny\" Foote\n*[[Cicely Tyson]] as Constantine Bates\n*[[Anna Camp]] as Jolene French\n*[[Brian Kerwin]] as Robert Phelan\n*[[Aunjanue Ellis]] as Yule May Davis\n*Ted Welch as William Holbrook\n*[[Wes Chatham]] as Carlton Phelan\n*[[Shane McRae]] as Raleigh Leefolt\n*Roslyn Ruff as Pascagoula\n*Tarra Riggs as Gretchen\n*[[LaChanze]] as Rachel Bates\n*[[Mary Steenburgen]] as Elaine Stein\n*[[Leslie Jordan]] as Mr. Blackly\n*[[David Oyelowo]] as Preacher Green\n*[[Dana Ivey]] as Grace Higginbotham\n*Tiffany Brouwer as Rebecca\n*Carol Lee as Pearly\n*Carol Sutton as Cora\n*Millicent Bolton as Callie\n*[[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]] as Mary Beth Caldwell\n*[[Nelsan Ellis]] as Henry\n*Emma and Eleanor Henry as Mae Mobley Leefolt\n*Shane Pengelly as Himself\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn December 2009, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Chris Columbus, Michael Barnathan, and Mark Radcliffe would produce a film adaptation of ''The Help'', under their production company [[1492 Pictures]].

The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Jessica Chastain]], [[Viola Davis]], [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], [[Allison Janney]], [[Octavia Spencer]] and [[Emma Stone]]. The film and novel recount the story of a young white woman and aspiring journalist Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan.<ref>{{cite web |title=Viola Davis on making 'The Help' work |url=https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/viola-davis-on-making-the-help-work-1.3075367 |publisher=JOHN ANDERSON}}</ref> The story focuses on her relationship with two black maids, Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson, during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in 1963 [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. In an attempt to become a legitimate journalist and writer, Skeeter decides to write a book from the point of view of the maids, exposing the [[racism in the United States|racism]] they are faced with as they work for white families. [[Domestic worker#Black domestic workers in the 1960 America|Black domestic workers in 1960s America]] were referred to as \"the help\", hence the title of the journalistic expose, the novel and the film.\n\n[[DreamWorks Pictures]] acquired the [[Film rights|screen rights]] to Stockett's novel in March 2010 and quickly commissioned the film with [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]], [[Michael Barnathan]], and [[Brunson Green]] as producers. The film's casting began later that month, with [[principal photography]] following four months after in Mississippi. The film is an international co-production between companies based in the United States, India, and the United Arab Emirates.<ref name=\"bfi\"/>\n\n[[Touchstone Pictures]] released ''The Help'' worldwide, with a [[Wide release|general theatrical release]] in North America on August 10, 2011. The film was a critical and commercial success, receiving positive reviews and grossing $216 million in worldwide box office.<ref name=\"Box Office Mojo\" /> ''The Help'' received four [[Academy Award]] nominations including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Davis, and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for both Chastain and Spencer, with the latter winning the award. The film also won the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summary must be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nIn 1963, Aibileen Clark is an African-American maid in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. She works for socialite Elizabeth Leefolt and cares for the Leefolts' daughter Mae Mobley, whom Elizabeth neglects. Aibileen's best friend and fellow maid Minny Jackson works for Mrs. Walters, whose daughter Hilly Holbrook leads the women's socialite group.\n\nEugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan, a recent graduate of [[University of Mississippi|Ole Miss]] and an aspiring writer, is a friend of Elizabeth. Skeeter is uncomfortable with her social circle's racist attitudes toward their maids, including Hilly's insistence on installing separate bathrooms for the help. Skeeter learns that her mother Charlotte fired Constantine, the maid who raised Skeeter, and decides to write a book of interviews with African-American maids working for white families.\n\nMinny is fired by Hilly for using the guest bathroom and is rendered unemployable, but finds a job with Celia Foote, a housewife ostracized by the other socialites. Celia treats Minny with respect and they become friends, but keep Minny's employment secret from Celia's husband Johnny, who is Hilly\u2019s former beau. Celia suffers a miscarriage, and reveals to Minny that she has had two previous miscarriages.\n\nSkeeter reaches out to Aibileen, who eventually agrees to be interviewed, as does Minny. Elaine Stein, Skeeter's editor at [[Harper (publisher)|Harper & Row]], advises her that the stories of two maids are not enough, but fear of retribution prevents other maids from coming forward. Aibileen tells Skeeter about her struggle to cope with the death of her son, and believes the book will help her find closure.\n\nHilly refuses to advance money to her replacement maid, Yule May, who is struggling to send her twin sons to college. Yule May discovers a discarded ring and pawns it, but is brutally arrested as Hilly watches. This incident and the assassination of [[Medgar Evers]] inspire more maids to tell Skeeter their stories.\n\nFollowing the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], Skeeter, Aibileen, and Minny fear the maids' stories will be recognized. Minny reveals the \"terrible awful\" she did to Hilly: after her termination, Minny brought Hilly her famous chocolate pie, but revealed that she baked her own [[excrement]] into the pie after Hilly had finished two slices. The inclusion of this incident in the book would prompt Hilly to crusade in denial that the book is about Jackson.\n\nSkeeter confronts her mother about firing Constantine, and Charlotte reveals that during a [[Daughters of America]] luncheon, Constantine's daughter Rachel disobeyed Charlotte's orders to enter through the kitchen, embarrassing her. To save face, Charlotte fired Constantine; Rachel took Constantine to Chicago, where she later died.\n \nThe book is published anonymously and is a success. Minny reveals the \"terrible awful\" to Celia, who finally sees what a manipulative bully Hilly is, and writes a cheque to one of Hilly's charity groups, made out to \"Two Slice Hilly\". Incensed, Hilly threatens Skeeter with legal proceedings, but she reminds Hilly that the incident is in chapter 12. Charlotte intervenes, letting on that she knows about the \"terrible awful\", and orders Hilly off the property. Charlotte and Skeeter reconcile when Charlotte tells her how proud she is of her courage, the book, and her job offer in New York City.\n\nJohnny reveals to Minny that he knows she has been working at his house, and how appreciative he is for her friendship with Celia, how it saved her life, and that she has permanent job security. This kindness gives Minny the courage to take her children and leave her abusive husband.\n\nSeeking revenge for helping Skeeter, Hilly pressures Elizabeth to terminate Aibileen, framing her for theft. Aibileen stands up to Hilly, who breaks down and storms out, and Elizabeth orders Aibileen to leave. Aibileen bids farewell to Mae Mobley and pleads with Elizabeth to give her daughter a chance, as Elizabeth begins to cry. Aibileen reflects on the ordeal and finds closure, looking to her own future as a writer.\n\n==Cast==\n\n===Main cast===\n*[[Emma Stone]] as Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan\n*[[Viola Davis]] as Aibileen Clark\n*[[Octavia Spencer]] as Minny Jackson\n*[[Bryce Dallas Howard]] as Hillary \"Hilly\" Walters Holbrook\n*[[Jessica Chastain]] as Celia Rae Foote\n*[[Allison Janney]] as Charlotte Phelan\n\n===Supporting cast===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Ahna O'Reilly]] as Elizabeth Leefolt\n*[[Sissy Spacek]] as Mrs. Walters\n*[[Chris Lowell]] as Stuart Whitworth\n*[[Mike Vogel]] as Jonathan \"Johnny\" Foote\n*[[Cicely Tyson]] as Constantine Bates\n*[[Anna Camp]] as Jolene French\n*[[Brian Kerwin]] as Robert Phelan\n*[[Aunjanue Ellis]] as Yule May Davis\n*Ted Welch as William Holbrook\n*[[Wes Chatham]] as Carlton Phelan\n*[[Shane McRae]] as Raleigh Leefolt\n*Roslyn Ruff as Pascagoula\n*Tarra Riggs as Gretchen\n*[[LaChanze]] as Rachel Bates\n*[[Mary Steenburgen]] as Elaine Stein\n*[[Leslie Jordan]] as Mr. Blackly\n*[[David Oyelowo]] as Preacher Green\n*[[Dana Ivey]] as Grace Higginbotham\n*Tiffany Brouwer as Rebecca\n*Carol Lee as Pearly\n*Carol Sutton as Cora\n*Millicent Bolton as Callie\n*[[Ashley Johnson (actress)|Ashley Johnson]] as Mary Beth Caldwell\n*[[Nelsan Ellis]] as Henry\n*Emma and Eleanor Henry as Mae Mobley Leefolt\n*Shane Pengelly as Himself\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn December 2009, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Chris Columbus, Michael Barnathan, and Mark Radcliffe would produce a film adaptation of ''The Help'', under their production company [[1492 Pictures]].

complete, stationary or progressive, or hard or soft.  The main types of age-related cataracts are nuclear sclerosis, cortical, and posterior subcapsular.\n\nNuclear sclerosis is the most common type of cataract, and involves the central or 'nuclear' part of the lens. This eventually becomes hard, or 'sclerotic', due to condensation on the lens nucleus and the deposition of brown pigment within the lens. In its advanced stages it is called a brunescent cataract. In early stages, an increase in sclerosis may cause an increase in refractive index of the lens.<ref name=Bollinger_2008/> This causes a myopic shift (lenticular shift) that decreases hyperopia and enables presbyopic patients to see at near without reading glasses. This is only tempororary and is called second sight.\n\nCortical cataracts are due to the lens cortex (outer layer) becoming opaque. They occur when changes in the fluid contained in the periphery of the lens causes fissuring. When these cataracts are viewed through an [[ophthalmoscope]], or other magnification system, the appearance is similar to white spokes of a wheel. Symptoms often include problems with glare and light scatter at night.<ref name=Bollinger_2008>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bollinger KE, Langston RH | title = What can patients expect from cataract surgery? | journal = Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 193\u2013196, 199\u2013196 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18383928 | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4524/5b544bc4af43d1971970874fa3cc03b82e60.pdf| doi = 10.3949/ccjm.75.3.193 }}</ref>\n\nPosterior subcapsular cataracts are cloudy at the back of the lens adjacent to the capsule (or bag) in which the lens sits. Because light becomes more focused toward the back of the lens, they can cause disproportionate symptoms for their size.\n\nAn immature cataract has some transparent protein, but with a mature cataract, all the lens protein is opaque. In a hypermature or Morgagnian cataract, the lens proteins have become liquid. Congenital cataract, which may be detected in adulthood, has a different classification and includes lamellar, polar, and sutural cataracts.<ref name=spencer>{{cite journal |vauthors=Spencer RW, Andelman SY | title = Steroid cataracts.

The former also provides paralysis of the eye muscles.\n*Corneal incision \u2013 Two cuts are made at the margin of the clear cornea to allow insertion of instruments into the eye.\n*[[Capsulorhexis]] \u2013 A needle or small pair of forceps is used to create a circular hole in the capsule in which the lens sits.\n*[[Phacoemulsification]] \u2013 A handheld ultrasonic probe is used to break up and emulsify the lens into liquid using the energy of ultrasound waves.  The resulting 'emulsion' is sucked away.\n*Irrigation and aspiration \u2013 The cortex, which is the soft outer layer of the cataract, is aspirated or sucked away. Fluid removed is continually replaced with a saline solution to prevent collapse of the structure of the anterior chamber (the front part of the eye). \n*Lens insertion \u2013 A plastic, foldable lens is inserted into the capsular bag that formerly contained the natural lens.

ECCE is less frequently performed than phacoemulsification, but can be useful when dealing with very hard cataracts or other situations where emulsification is problematic. Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS) has evolved from ECCE. In MSICS, the lens is removed through a self-sealing scleral tunnel wound in the [[sclera]] which, ideally, is watertight and does not require suturing. Although \"small\", the incision is still markedly larger than the portal in phacoemulsion.

The incidence is increasing over time in a somewhat linear manner, and the risk increase lasts for at least 20 years after the procedure. Particular risk factors are younger age, male sex, longer axial length, and complications during surgery.

Growth of natural lens cells remaining after the natural lens was removed may be the cause, and the younger the patient, the greater the chance of this occurring.  Management involves cutting a small, circular area in the posterior capsule with targeted beams of energy from a laser, called [[Nd:YAG laser]] capsulotomy, after the type of laser used.  The laser can be aimed very accurately, and the small part of the capsule which is cut falls harmlessly to the bottom of the inside of the eye.

complete, stationary or progressive, or hard or soft.  The main types of age-related cataracts are nuclear sclerosis, cortical, and posterior subcapsular.\n\nNuclear sclerosis is the most common type of cataract, and involves the central or 'nuclear' part of the lens. This eventually becomes hard, or 'sclerotic', due to condensation on the lens nucleus and the deposition of brown pigment within the lens. In its advanced stages it is called a brunescent cataract. In early stages, an increase in sclerosis may cause an increase in refractive index of the lens.<ref name=Bollinger_2008/> This causes a myopic shift (lenticular shift) that decreases hyperopia and enables presbyopic patients to see at near without reading glasses. This is only tempororary and is called second sight.\n\nCortical cataracts are due to the lens cortex (outer layer) becoming opaque. They occur when changes in the fluid contained in the periphery of the lens causes fissuring. When these cataracts are viewed through an [[ophthalmoscope]], or other magnification system, the appearance is similar to white spokes of a wheel. Symptoms often include problems with glare and light scatter at night.<ref name=Bollinger_2008>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bollinger KE, Langston RH | title = What can patients expect from cataract surgery? | journal = Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = 193\u2013196, 199\u2013196 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18383928 | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4524/5b544bc4af43d1971970874fa3cc03b82e60.pdf| doi = 10.3949/ccjm.75.3.193 }}</ref>\n\nPosterior subcapsular cataracts are cloudy at the back of the lens adjacent to the capsule (or bag) in which the lens sits. Because light becomes more focused toward the back of the lens, they can cause disproportionate symptoms for their size.\n\nAn immature cataract has some transparent protein, but with a mature cataract, all the lens protein is opaque. In a hypermature or Morgagnian cataract, the lens proteins have become liquid. Congenital cataract, which may be detected in adulthood, has a different classification and includes lamellar, polar, and sutural cataracts.<ref name=spencer>{{cite journal |vauthors=Spencer RW, Andelman SY | title = Steroid cataracts.

Phacoemulsification typically comprises six steps:\n*Anaesthetic \u2013 The eye is numbed with either a subtenon injection around the eye (see: [[retrobulbar block]]) or topical anesthetic eye drops. The former also provides paralysis of the eye muscles.\n*Corneal incision \u2013 Two cuts are made at the margin of the clear cornea to allow insertion of instruments into the eye.\n*[[Capsulorhexis]] \u2013 A needle or small pair of forceps is used to create a circular hole in the capsule in which the lens sits.\n*[[Phacoemulsification]] \u2013 A handheld ultrasonic probe is used to break up and emulsify the lens into liquid using the energy of ultrasound waves.  The resulting 'emulsion' is sucked away.\n*Irrigation and aspiration \u2013 The cortex, which is the soft outer layer of the cataract, is aspirated or sucked away.

ECCE is less frequently performed than phacoemulsification, but can be useful when dealing with very hard cataracts or other situations where emulsification is problematic. Manual small incision cataract surgery (MSICS) has evolved from ECCE. In MSICS, the lens is removed through a self-sealing scleral tunnel wound in the [[sclera]] which, ideally, is watertight and does not require suturing. Although \"small\", the incision is still markedly larger than the portal in phacoemulsion. This surgery is increasingly popular in the developing world where access to phacoemulsification is still limited.\n\nIntracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) is rarely performed.<ref>{{citation |page=367 |title=The Eye in History |first=Frank |last=Goes |publisher=JP Medical |year=2013 |isbn=9789350902745}}</ref> The lens and surrounding capsule are removed in one piece through a large incision while pressure is applied to the vitreous membrane.

The patient is usually ambulatory on the day of surgery, but is advised to move cautiously and avoid straining or heavy lifting for about a month. The eye is usually patched on the day of surgery and use of an eye shield at night is often suggested for several days after surgery.<ref name=vaughan />\n\nIn all types of surgery, the cataractous lens is removed and replaced with an artificial lens, known as an [[intraocular lens]], which stays in the eye permanently. Intraocular lenses are usually monofocal, correcting for either distance or near vision. Multifocal lenses may be implanted to improve near and distance vision simultaneously, but these lenses may increase the chance of unsatisfactory vision.<ref name=\"yanoff\" />\n\n===Complications===\nSerious complications of cataract surgery include [[retinal detachment]] and [[endophthalmitis]].<ref>{{citation |page=247 |title=Applied Pathology for Ophthalmic Microsurgeons |publisher=Springer Science & Business |year=2008 |isbn=9783540683667 |chapter=Complications After Cataract Surgery |editor=Naumann |editor2=Holbach |editor3=Kruse}}</ref> In both cases, patients notice a sudden decrease in vision. In endophthalmitis, patients often describe pain. Retinal detachment frequently presents with unilateral [[visual field]] defects, blurring of vision, flashes of light, or floating spots.\n\nThe risk of retinal detachment was estimated as about 0.4% within 5.5 years, corresponding to a 2.3-fold risk increase compared to naturally expected incidence, with older studies reporting a substantially higher risk. The incidence is increasing over time in a somewhat linear manner, and the risk increase lasts for at least 20 years after the procedure. Particular risk factors are younger age, male sex, longer axial length, and complications during surgery. In the highest risk group of patients, the incidence of pseudophakic retinal detachment may be as high as 20%.<ref name=\"Olsen_2012\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Olsen T, Jeppesen P | title = The Incidence of Retinal Detachment After Cataract Surgery | journal = The Open Ophthalmology Journal | volume = 6 | pages = 79\u201382 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23002414 | pmc = 3447164 | doi = 10.2174/1874364101206010079 }}</ref><ref name=Herrmann_2011>{{cite journal |vauthors=Herrmann W, Helbig H, Heimann H | title = Pseudophakie-Ablatio | journal = Klinische Monatsbl\u00e4tter f\u00fcr Augenheilkunde | volume = 228 | issue = 3 | pages = 195\u2013200 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21374539 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1055/s-0029-1246116 }}</ref>\n\nThe risk of endophthalmitis occurring after surgery is less than one in 1000.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Behndig A, Montan P, Stenevi U, Kugelberg M, Lundstr\u00f6m M | title = One million cataract surgeries: Swedish National Cataract Register 1992\u20132009 | journal = J.

Growth of natural lens cells remaining after the natural lens was removed may be the cause, and the younger the patient, the greater the chance of this occurring.  Management involves cutting a small, circular area in the posterior capsule with targeted beams of energy from a laser, called [[Nd:YAG laser]] capsulotomy, after the type of laser used.  The laser can be aimed very accurately, and the small part of the capsule which is cut falls harmlessly to the bottom of the inside of the eye.  This procedure leaves sufficient capsule to hold the lens in place, but removes enough to allow light to pass directly through to the retina.

There are both [[Edible oil|edible]] and industrial forms produced from the seed of any of several [[cultivar]]s of the plant family [[Brassicaceae]], namely cultivars of ''Brassica napus'', ''[[Brassica rapa]]'' subsp. ''oleifera'' (syn. ''B. campestris''), or ''[[Brassica juncea]]'', which are also referred to as \"canola\". According to the Canola Council of Canada, an industry association, the official definition of canola is \"Seeds of the genus Brassica (Brassica napus, Brassica rapa, or Brassica juncea) from which the oil shall contain less than 2% erucic acid in its fatty acid profile and the solid component shall contain less than 30 micromoles of any one or any mixture of 3-butenyl glucosinolate, 4-pentenyl glucosinolate, 2-hydroxy-3 butenyl glucosinolate, and 2-hydroxy- 4-pentenyl glucosinolate per gram of air-dry, oil-free solid.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.canolacouncil.org/oil-and-meal/what-is-canola/ | title = What Is Canola? | work = Canola Council of Canada| publisher = Canola Council of Canada | accessdate = 2017-08-18 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170618102423/http://www.canolacouncil.org/oil-and-meal/what-is-canola/ | archivedate = 2017-06-18 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nConsumption of the oil has become common in [[industrialized nations]]. It is also used as a source of [[biodiesel]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Origin===\nThe name for rapeseed comes from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|rapum}} meaning turnip. [[Turnip]], [[rutabaga]], [[cabbage]], [[Brussels sprouts]], and [[mustard plant|mustard]] are related to rapeseed. Rapeseed belongs to the genus ''[[Brassica]]''. ''Brassica'' oilseed varieties are some of the oldest plants cultivated by humanity, with documentation of its use in India 4,000 years ago, and use in China and Japan 2,000 years ago.<ref name=Snowdon>Snowdon R et al. \"Oilseed Rape\".

Rapeseed oil extracts were first put on the market in 1956\u20131957 as food products, but these suffered from several unacceptable characteristics. Rapeseed oil had a distinctive taste and a disagreeable greenish color, due to the presence of [[chlorophyll]]. It also contained a high concentration of erucic acid.\n\nCanola was bred from rapeseed cultivars of ''B. napus'' and ''B. rapa'' at the [[University of Manitoba]], Canada, by [[Keith Downey (agricultural scientist)|Keith Downey]] and [[Baldur R.

Starting in the 1930s, foreigners were unable to poach giant pandas in China because of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Chinese Civil War]], but pandas remained a source of soft furs for the locals. The population boom in China after 1949 created stress on the pandas' habitat and the subsequent famines led to the increased hunting of wildlife, including pandas. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], all studies and conservation activities on the pandas were stopped. After the [[Chinese economic reform]], demand for panda skins from Hong Kong and Japan led to illegal poaching for the [[underground economy|black market]], acts generally ignored by the local officials at the time.\n\n[[File:Panda Cub from Wolong, Sichuan, China.JPG|thumb|right|Closeup of a seven-month-old panda cub]]\n\nIn 1963, the PRC government set up [[Wolong National Nature Reserve]] to save the declining panda population.<ref name=\"about\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chinawolong.com/doce/about.htm|title=About Wolong |publisher=Wolong National Natural Reserve|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201172138/https://www.chinawolong.com/doce/about.htm|archivedate=December 1, 2006 |date=May 7, 2005}}</ref> {{cns|However, few advances in the conservation of pandas were made at the time, owing to inexperience and insufficient knowledge of ecology. Many believed the best way to save the pandas was to cage them. As a result, pandas were caged at any sign of decline and suffered from terrible conditions. Because of pollution and destruction of their natural habitat, along with segregation caused by caging, reproduction of wild pandas was severely limited. In the 1990s, however, several laws (including gun control and the removal of resident humans from the reserves) helped their chances of survival.

Instead, China began to offer pandas to other nations only on 10-year loans, under terms including a fee of up to US$1,000,000 per year and a provision that any cubs born during the loan are the property of China. Since 1998, because of a [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] [[lawsuit]], the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] only allows a US [[zoo]] to import a panda if the zoo can ensure that China will channel more than half of its loan fee into [[conservation movement|conservation]] efforts for the giant panda and its habitat.\n\nIn May 2005, China offered a breeding pair to [[Taiwan]]. The issue became embroiled in [[cross-Strait relations]] \u2013 both over the underlying symbolism, and over technical issues such as whether the transfer would be considered \"domestic\" or \"international\", or whether any true conservation purpose would be served by the exchange.<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/id/45901/ China's Panda Politics].

Starting in the 1930s, foreigners were unable to poach giant pandas in China because of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Chinese Civil War]], but pandas remained a source of soft furs for the locals. The population boom in China after 1949 created stress on the pandas' habitat and the subsequent famines led to the increased hunting of wildlife, including pandas. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], all studies and conservation activities on the pandas were stopped. After the [[Chinese economic reform]], demand for panda skins from Hong Kong and Japan led to illegal poaching for the [[underground economy|black market]], acts generally ignored by the local officials at the time.\n\n[[File:Panda Cub from Wolong, Sichuan, China.JPG|thumb|right|Closeup of a seven-month-old panda cub]]\n\nIn 1963, the PRC government set up [[Wolong National Nature Reserve]] to save the declining panda population.<ref name=\"about\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chinawolong.com/doce/about.htm|title=About Wolong |publisher=Wolong National Natural Reserve|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201172138/https://www.chinawolong.com/doce/about.htm|archivedate=December 1, 2006 |date=May 7, 2005}}</ref> {{cns|However, few advances in the conservation of pandas were made at the time, owing to inexperience and insufficient knowledge of ecology. Many believed the best way to save the pandas was to cage them. As a result, pandas were caged at any sign of decline and suffered from terrible conditions. Because of pollution and destruction of their natural habitat, along with segregation caused by caging, reproduction of wild pandas was severely limited. In the 1990s, however, several laws (including gun control and the removal of resident humans from the reserves) helped their chances of survival. With these renewed efforts and improved conservation methods, wild pandas have started to increase in numbers in some areas, though they still are classified as a [[rare species]].|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 2006, scientists reported that the number of pandas living in the wild may have been underestimated at about 1,000. Previous population surveys had used conventional methods to estimate the size of the wild panda population, but using a new method that analyzes [[DNA]] from panda [[Feces|droppings]], scientists believe the wild population may be as large as 3,000.<ref name=\"Britannica Earth\"/> In 2006, there were 40 panda reserves in China, compared to just 13 reserves in 1998.<ref name=\"BBC_06-07\" /> As the species has been reclassified to \"vulnerable\" since 2016, the conservation efforts are thought to be working. Furthermore, in response to this reclassification, the [[State Forestry Administration of the People's Republic of China|State Forestry Administration of China]] announced that they would not accordingly lower the conservation level for panda, and would instead reinforce the conservation efforts.<ref>[http://www.forestry.gov.cn/main/195/content-902929.html The Panda is still endangered species, and the conservation efforts still need to be reinforced] ''State Forestry Administration of the People's Republic of China'' (in Chinese)</ref>\n\nThe giant panda is among the world's most adored and protected rare animals, and is one of the few in the world whose natural inhabitant status was able to gain a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] designation.
