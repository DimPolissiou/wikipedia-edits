The capital city is [[Lusaka]], located in the south-central part of Zambia. The population is concentrated mainly around Lusaka in the south and the [[Copperbelt Province]] to the northwest, the core economic hubs of the country.\n\nOriginally inhabited by [[Khoisan]] peoples, the region was affected by the [[Bantu expansion]] of the thirteenth century. Following [[European exploration of Africa|European explorers]] in the eighteenth century, the British colonised the region into the British protectorates of [[Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia]] and [[North-Eastern Rhodesia]] towards the end of the nineteenth century. These were merged in 1911 to form [[Northern Rhodesia]]. For most of the colonial period, Zambia was governed by an administration appointed from London with the advice of the [[British South Africa Company]].\n\nOn 24 October 1964, Zambia became independent of the United Kingdom and prime minister [[Kenneth Kaunda]] became the inaugural president. Kaunda's socialist [[United National Independence Party]] (UNIP) maintained power from 1964 until 1991. Kaunda played a key role in regional diplomacy, cooperating closely with the United States in search of solutions to conflicts in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Angola, and Namibia.<ref>Andy DeRoche, ''Kenneth Kaunda, the United States and Southern Africa'' (London: Bloomsbury, 2016).</ref> From 1972 to 1991 Zambia was a [[one-party state]] with the UNIP as the sole legal political party under the motto \"One Zambia, One Nation\". Kaunda was succeeded by [[Frederick Chiluba]] of the social-democratic [[Movement for Multi-Party Democracy]] in 1991, beginning a period of social-economic growth and government decentralisation. [[Levy Mwanawasa]], Chiluba's chosen successor, presided over Zambia from January 2002 until his death in August 2008, and is credited with campaigns to reduce corruption and increase the standard of living. After Mwanawasa's death, [[Rupiah Banda]] presided as Acting President before being elected President in 2008. Holding office for only three years, Banda stepped down after his defeat in the [[Zambian general election, 2011|2011 elections]] by [[Patriotic Front (Zambia)|Patriotic Front]] party leader [[Michael Sata]].

The most prominent of these was [[David Livingstone]], who had a vision of ending the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] through the \"3 Cs\": Christianity, Commerce and Civilisation. He was the first European to see the magnificent waterfalls on the [[Zambezi River]] in 1855, naming them the [[Victoria Falls]] after [[Queen Victoria]] of the United Kingdom. He described them thus: \"Scenes so lovely must have been gazed upon by angels in their flight\".\n\nLocally the falls are known as \"Mosi-o-Tunya\" or \"thundering smoke\" in the Lozi or Kololo dialect. The town of [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]], near the Falls, is named after him. Highly publicised accounts of his journeys motivated a wave of European visitors, missionaries and traders after his death in 1873.<ref>\"First to the Falls\" by Gervas and Gill Clay</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=October 2014}}\n\n===British South Africa Company===\nIn 1888, the [[British South Africa Company]] (BSA Company), led by [[Cecil Rhodes]], obtained mineral rights from the [[Litunga]] of the Lozi people, the Paramount Chief of the [[Lozi people|Lozi (Ba-rotse)]] for the area which later became [[Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia]].<ref name=\"livingstone\">{{cite web\n| title=Destination:Zambia&nbsp;\u2013 History and Culture\n| url=http://www.livingstonetourism.com/pages/history.htm\n| author=Livingstone Tourism Association | accessdate=29 October 2007\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012153527/http://livingstonetourism.com/pages/history.htm |archivedate = 12 October 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:CecilRhodes.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cecil Rhodes]]\nTo the east, in December 1897 a group of the [[Ngoni people|Angoni or Ngoni]] (originally from Zululand) rebelled under Tsinco, son of King [[Mpezeni]], but the rebellion was put down,<ref name=\"unam\">{{cite web\n| title=Zambia: Historical Background |author1=Human Rights  |author2=Documentation Centre  |lastauthoramp=yes | url=http://www.hrdc.unam.na/zm_history.htm\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070311093653/http://www.hrdc.unam.na/zm_history.htm\n| archivedate=11 March 2007 | accessdate=14 January 2011\n}}</ref> and [[Mpezeni]] accepted the [[Pax Britannica]].

The council passed resolutions calling for Northern Rhodesia's secession from the federation and demanding full internal self-government under a new constitution and a new [[National Assembly of Zambia|National Assembly]] based on a broader, more democratic franchise.\n\nThe federation was dissolved on 31 December 1963, and in January 1964, Kaunda won the only election for Prime Minister of Northern Rhodesia. The [[Governor of Northern Rhodesia|Colonial Governor]], Sir [[Evelyn Dennison Hone|Evelyn Hone]], was very close to Kaunda and urged him to stand for the post. Soon after, there was an uprising in the north of the country known as the [[Lumpa Church|Lumpa Uprising]] led by [[Alice Lenshina]]&nbsp;\u2013 Kaunda's first internal conflict as leader of the nation.\n\nNorthern Rhodesia became the Republic of Zambia on 24 October 1964, with [[Kenneth Kaunda]] as the first president.

In Zambia's situation, the cost of transporting the copper great distances to market was an additional strain. Zambia turned to foreign and international lenders for relief, but, as copper prices remained depressed, it became increasingly difficult to service its growing debt. By the mid-1990s, despite limited debt relief, Zambia's per capita foreign debt remained among the highest in the world.\n\n===Democratisation===\n\nIn June 1990 riots against Kaunda accelerated. Many protesters were killed by the regime in breakthrough June 1990 protests.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} In 1990 Kaunda survived an [[1990 Zambian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|attempted coup]], and in 1991 he agreed to reinstate multiparty democracy, having instituted one-party rule under the Choma Commission of 1972. Following multiparty elections, Kaunda was removed from office (see below).\n\nIn the 2000s, the economy stabilised, attaining single-digit inflation in 2006\u20132007, real GDP growth, decreasing interest rates, and increasing levels of trade. Much of its growth is due to foreign investment in mining and to higher world copper prices. All this led to Zambia being courted enthusiastically by aid donors, and saw a surge in investor confidence in the country.\n\n==Politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Zambia}}\n\n[[File:Zambia National Assembly Building.jpg|thumb|Zambia National Assembly building in [[Lusaka]]]]\n\nPolitics in Zambia take place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[List of Presidents of Zambia|President of Zambia]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] in a pluriform [[multi-party system]].

At {{convert|752614|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} it is the 39th-largest country in the world, slightly smaller than [[Chile]]. The country lies mostly between latitudes [[8th parallel south|8\u00b0]] and [[18th parallel south|18\u00b0S]], and longitudes [[22nd meridian east|22\u00b0]] and [[34th meridian east|34\u00b0E]].\n\nZambia is drained by two major river basins: the [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]]/Kafue basin in the centre, west and south covering about three-quarters of the country; and the [[Congo River|Congo]] basin in the north covering about one-quarter of the country. A very small area in the northeast forms part of the internal drainage basin of [[Lake Rukwa]] in Tanzania.\n\nIn the Zambezi basin, there are a number of major rivers flowing wholly or partially through Zambia: the [[Kabompo River|Kabompo]], [[Lungwebungu River|Lungwebungu]], [[Kafue River|Kafue]], [[Luangwa River|Luangwa]], and the Zambezi itself, which flows through the country in the west and then forms its southern border with [[Namibia]], Botswana and [[Zimbabwe]]. Its source is in Zambia but it diverts into Angola, and a number of its tributaries rise in Angola's central highlands. The edge of the [[Cuando River]] floodplain (not its main channel) forms Zambia's southwestern border, and via the [[Chobe River]] that river contributes very little water to the Zambezi because most is lost by evaporation.<ref name=\"Beilfuss\">Beilfuss, Richard and dos Santos, David (2001)  [http://files.gorongosa.net/filestore/348-patterns_hydrological_change_zambezi_delta.pdf \"Patterns of Hydrological Change in the Zambezi Delta, Mozambique\".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217180850/http://files.gorongosa.net/filestore/348-patterns_hydrological_change_zambezi_delta.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }} Working Paper No 2 Program for the Sustainable Management of Cahora Bassa Dam and The Lower Zambezi Valley.</ref>\n\nTwo of the Zambezi's longest and largest tributaries, the Kafue and the Luangwa, flow mainly in Zambia. Their confluences with the Zambezi are on the border with Zimbabwe at Chirundu and [[Luangwa, Zambia|Luangwa town]] respectively. Before its confluence, the Luangwa River forms part of Zambia's border with [[Mozambique]]. From Luangwa town, the Zambezi leaves Zambia and flows into Mozambique, and eventually into the [[Mozambique Channel]].\n\nThe Zambezi falls about {{convert|100|m|ft|0}} over the {{convert|1.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide [[Victoria Falls]], located in the south-west corner of the country, subsequently flowing into [[Lake Kariba]]. The Zambezi valley, running along the southern border, is both deep and wide. From Lake Kariba going east it is formed by [[graben]]s and like the Luangwa, Mweru-Luapula, [[Mweru-wa-Ntipa]] and Lake Tanganyika valleys, is a [[rift valley]].\n\nThe north of Zambia is very flat with broad plains. In the west the most notable being the [[Barotse Floodplain]] on the Zambezi, which floods from December to June, lagging behind the annual rainy season (typically November to April). The [[floodplain|flood]] dominates the natural environment and the lives, society and culture of the inhabitants and those of other smaller, floodplains throughout the country.\n\n[[File:Cataratas Victoria, Zambia-Zimbabue, 2018-07-27, DD 05.jpg|thumb|[[Victoria Falls]]]]\nIn Eastern Zambia the plateau which extends between the Zambezi and Lake Tanganyika valleys is tilted upwards to the north, and so rises imperceptibly from about {{convert|900|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the south to {{convert|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the centre, reaching {{convert|1800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the north near Mbala. These plateau areas of northern Zambia have been categorised by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] as a large section of the [[Central Zambezian Miombo woodlands]] [[ecoregion]].\n\nEastern Zambia shows great diversity. The Luangwa Valley splits the plateau in a curve north-east to south-west, extended west into the heart of the plateau by the deep valley of the [[Lunsemfwa River]]. Hills and mountains are found by the side of some sections of the valley, notably in its north-east the Nyika Plateau ({{convert|2200|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) on the Malawi border, which extend into Zambia as the [[Mafinga Hills]], containing the country's highest point, [[Mafinga Central]] ({{convert|2339|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.markhorrell.com/blog/2014/mafinga-south-and-mafinga-central-the-highest-peaks-in-zambia/ |title=Mafinga South and Mafinga Central: the highest peaks in Zambia |publisher=Footsteps on the Mountain blog |accessdate=16 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe Muchinga Mountains, the watershed between the Zambezi and Congo drainage basins, run parallel to the deep valley of the Luangwa River and form a sharp backdrop to its northern edge, although they are almost everywhere below {{convert|1700|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Their culminating peak Mumpu is at the western end and at {{convert|1892|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} is the highest point in Zambia away from the eastern border region. The border of the [[Congo Pedicle]] was drawn around this mountain.\n\nThe southernmost headstream of the Congo River rises in Zambia and flows west through its northern area firstly as the [[Chambeshi River|Chambeshi]] and then, after the [[Lake Bangweulu|Bangweulu Swamps]] as the [[Luapula River|Luapula]], which forms part of the border with the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The Luapula flows south then west before it turns north until it enters [[Lake Mweru]]. The lake's other major tributary is the [[Kalungwishi River]], which flows into it from the east. The [[Luvua River]] drains Lake Mweru, flowing out of the northern end to the [[Lualaba River]] (Upper Congo River).\n\n[[Lake Tanganyika]] is the other major [[hydrography|hydrographic]] feature that belongs to the Congo basin. Its south-eastern end receives water from the [[Kalambo River]], which forms part of Zambia's border with Tanzania. This river has Africa's second highest uninterrupted waterfall, the [[Kalambo Falls]].\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of Zambia}}\nZambia is located on the plateau of [[Central Africa]], between 1000 and 1600 m above sea level. The average altitude of {{convert|1200|m}} generally has a moderate climate. The climate of Zambia is tropical, modified by elevation. In the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], most of the country is classified as [[humid subtropical]] or [[tropical wet and dry climate|tropical wet and dry]], with small stretches of semi-arid [[steppe climate]] in the south-west and along the [[Zambezi valley]].\n\nThere are two main seasons, the [[rainy season]] (November to April) corresponding to summer, and the [[dry season]] (May/June to October/November), corresponding to winter. The dry season is subdivided into the cool dry season (May/June to August), and the hot dry season (September to October/November). The modifying influence of altitude gives the country pleasant [[subtropical]] weather rather than tropical conditions during the cool season of May to August.<ref>''Spectrum Guide to Zambia''.

In the Copperbelt [[Bemba language|Bemba]] is the main language and [[Nyanja]] second. [[Bemba language|Bemba]] and [[Nyanja]] are spoken in the urban areas in addition to other indigenous languages which are commonly spoken in Zambia. These include [[Lozi language|Lozi]], [[Kaonde]], [[Tonga language (Zambia and Zimbabwe)|Tonga]], [[Lunda languages|Lunda]] and [[Luvale]], which feature on the [[Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation]] (ZNBC)'s local languages section. The total number of languages spoken in Zambia is 73.\n\n{{Dominant regional languages in Zambia}}\nUrbanisation has had a dramatic effect on some of the indigenous languages, including the assimilation of words from other languages. Urban dwellers sometimes differentiate between urban and rural dialects of the same language by prefixing the rural languages with 'deep'.\n\nMost will thus speak Bemba and Nyanja in the Copperbelt; Nyanja is dominantly spoken in Lusaka and Eastern Zambia. English is used in official communications and is the language of choice at home among&nbsp;\u2013 now common&nbsp;\u2013 intertribal families. This evolution of languages has led to [[Zambian slang]] heard throughout Lusaka and other major cities. Portuguese has been introduced as a secondary language into the school curriculum due to the presence of a large Portuguese-speaking Angolan community.<ref>[http://www.afriquejet.com/news/africa-news/zambia-to-introduce-portuguese-into-school-curriculum-2009041825794.html Zambia to introduce Portuguese into school curriculum]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121208151924/http://www.afriquejet.com/news/africa-news/zambia-to-introduce-portuguese-into-school-curriculum-2009041825794.html |date=8 December 2012 }}</ref> French is commonly studied in private schools, while some secondary schools have it as an optional subject.

Initially, Zambia hoped to reach the HIPC completion point, and benefit from substantial debt forgiveness, in late 2003.\n\n[[File:GDP per capita (current), % of world average, 1960-2012; Zimbabwe, South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Mozambique.png|thumb|GDP per capita (current), compared to neighbouring countries (world average = 100)]]\nIn January 2003, the Zambian government informed the International Monetary Fund and [[World Bank]] that it wished to renegotiate some of the agreed performance criteria calling for privatisation of the Zambia National Commercial Bank and the national telephone and electricity utilities. Although agreements were reached on these issues, subsequent overspending on civil service wages delayed Zambia's final HIPC debt forgiveness from late 2003 to early 2005, at the earliest. In an effort to reach HIPC completion in 2004, the government drafted an austerity budget for 2004, freezing civil service salaries and increasing a number of taxes. The tax hike and public sector wage freeze prohibited salary increases and new hires. This sparked a nationwide strike in February 2004.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090724213759/http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/articles.aspx?id=2108 The World Bank and IMF's long shadow in Zambia's copper mines]. eurodad.org. 20 February 2008</ref>\n\nThe Zambian government is pursuing an economic diversification program to reduce the economy's reliance on the copper industry.

Output of copper had fallen to a low of 228,000 metric tons in 1998 after a 30-year decline in output due to lack of investment, low copper prices, and uncertainty over privatisation. In 2002, following privatisation of the industry, copper production rebounded to 337,000 metric tons.

One of the results of the colonial era was the growth of urbanisation. Different ethnic groups started living together in towns and cities, influencing each other as well as adopting a lot of the [[European culture]]. The original cultures have largely survived in the rural areas with some outside influence such as Christianity being widely practiced. In the urban setting there is a continuous integration and evolution of these cultures to produce what is now called \"Zambian culture\".\n\n[[File:African Art, Yombe sculpture, Louvre.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Yombe people|Yombe]] sculpture, 19th century.]]\nTraditional culture is very visible through colourful annual [[Zambian traditional ceremonies]].

Most [[Music of Zambia|Zambian traditional music]] is based on drums (and other percussion instruments) with a lot of singing and dancing. In the urban areas foreign genres of music are popular, in particular Congolese [[Soukous|rumba]], African-American music and Jamaican reggae. Several psychedelic rock artists emerged in the 1970s to create a genre known as [[Zam-rock]], including WITCH, Musi-O-Tunya, Rikki Ililonga, Amanaz, the Peace, Chrissy Zebby Tembo, Blackfoot, and the Ngozi Family.\n\n===Media===\n{{Main|Media in Zambia|Telecommunications in Zambia}}\nThe [https://web.archive.org/web/20130919070712/http://www.statehouse.gov.zm/en/ministry-of-information-and-broadcasting-services-p-o-box-50200-lusaka-zambia-tel-260-211-235410/ Ministry of Information, Broadcasting Services and Tourism In Zambia] is responsible for the [[Zambian News Agency]], while there are also numerous media outlets throughout the country which include; [[television station]]s, [[newspaper]]s, [[FM broadcasting|FM radio stations]], and [[Online journalism|Internet news websites]].\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in Zambia}}\nZambia declared its independence on the day of the closing ceremony of the [[1964 Summer Olympics]], thereby becoming the first country ever to have entered an Olympic games as one country, and left it as another.

[[Kalusha Bwalya]], Zambia's most celebrated football player and one of Africa's greatest football players in history had a hat trick in that match. However, to this day, many pundits say the greatest team Zambia has ever assembled was the one that perished on 28 April 1993 in a [[1993 Zambia national football team air disaster|plane crash]] at [[Libreville, Gabon]]. Despite this, in 1996, Zambia was ranked 15th on the official FIFA World Football Team rankings, the highest attained by any southern African team. In 2012, Zambia won the [[African Cup of Nations]] for the first time after losing in the final twice.

Its neighbours are the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the north, [[Tanzania]] to the north-east, [[Malawi]] to the east, [[Mozambique]] to the southeast, [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Botswana]] to the south, [[Namibia]] to the southwest, and [[Angola]] to the west. The capital city is [[Lusaka]], located in the south-central part of Zambia. The population is concentrated mainly around Lusaka in the south and the [[Copperbelt Province]] to the northwest, the core economic hubs of the country.\n\nOriginally inhabited by [[Khoisan]] peoples, the region was affected by the [[Bantu expansion]] of the thirteenth century. Following [[European exploration of Africa|European explorers]] in the eighteenth century, the British colonised the region into the British protectorates of [[Barotziland-North-Western Rhodesia]] and [[North-Eastern Rhodesia]] towards the end of the nineteenth century. These were merged in 1911 to form [[Northern Rhodesia]]. For most of the colonial period, Zambia was governed by an administration appointed from London with the advice of the [[British South Africa Company]].\n\nOn 24 October 1964, Zambia became independent of the United Kingdom and prime minister [[Kenneth Kaunda]] became the inaugural president. Kaunda's socialist [[United National Independence Party]] (UNIP) maintained power from 1964 until 1991. Kaunda played a key role in regional diplomacy, cooperating closely with the United States in search of solutions to conflicts in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), Angola, and Namibia.<ref>Andy DeRoche, ''Kenneth Kaunda, the United States and Southern Africa'' (London: Bloomsbury, 2016).</ref> From 1972 to 1991 Zambia was a [[one-party state]] with the UNIP as the sole legal political party under the motto \"One Zambia, One Nation\". Kaunda was succeeded by [[Frederick Chiluba]] of the social-democratic [[Movement for Multi-Party Democracy]] in 1991, beginning a period of social-economic growth and government decentralisation. [[Levy Mwanawasa]], Chiluba's chosen successor, presided over Zambia from January 2002 until his death in August 2008, and is credited with campaigns to reduce corruption and increase the standard of living. After Mwanawasa's death, [[Rupiah Banda]] presided as Acting President before being elected President in 2008. Holding office for only three years, Banda stepped down after his defeat in the [[Zambian general election, 2011|2011 elections]] by [[Patriotic Front (Zambia)|Patriotic Front]] party leader [[Michael Sata]]. Sata died on 28 October 2014, making him the second Zambian president to die in office.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29813612 Zambian President Michael Sata dies in London&nbsp;\u2013 BBC News].

The most prominent of these was [[David Livingstone]], who had a vision of ending the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] through the \"3 Cs\": Christianity, Commerce and Civilisation. He was the first European to see the magnificent waterfalls on the [[Zambezi River]] in 1855, naming them the [[Victoria Falls]] after [[Queen Victoria]] of the United Kingdom. He described them thus: \"Scenes so lovely must have been gazed upon by angels in their flight\".\n\nLocally the falls are known as \"Mosi-o-Tunya\" or \"thundering smoke\" in the Lozi or Kololo dialect. The town of [[Livingstone, Zambia|Livingstone]], near the Falls, is named after him.

The council passed resolutions calling for Northern Rhodesia's secession from the federation and demanding full internal self-government under a new constitution and a new [[National Assembly of Zambia|National Assembly]] based on a broader, more democratic franchise.\n\nThe federation was dissolved on 31 December 1963, and in January 1964, Kaunda won the only election for Prime Minister of Northern Rhodesia. The [[Governor of Northern Rhodesia|Colonial Governor]], Sir [[Evelyn Dennison Hone|Evelyn Hone]], was very close to Kaunda and urged him to stand for the post. Soon after, there was an uprising in the north of the country known as the [[Lumpa Church|Lumpa Uprising]] led by [[Alice Lenshina]]&nbsp;\u2013 Kaunda's first internal conflict as leader of the nation.\n\nNorthern Rhodesia became the Republic of Zambia on 24 October 1964, with [[Kenneth Kaunda]] as the first president.

In Zambia's situation, the cost of transporting the copper great distances to market was an additional strain. Zambia turned to foreign and international lenders for relief, but, as copper prices remained depressed, it became increasingly difficult to service its growing debt. By the mid-1990s, despite limited debt relief, Zambia's per capita foreign debt remained among the highest in the world.\n\n===Democratisation===\n\nIn June 1990 riots against Kaunda accelerated. Many protesters were killed by the regime in breakthrough June 1990 protests.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} In 1990 Kaunda survived an [[1990 Zambian coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|attempted coup]], and in 1991 he agreed to reinstate multiparty democracy, having instituted one-party rule under the Choma Commission of 1972. Following multiparty elections, Kaunda was removed from office (see below).\n\nIn the 2000s, the economy stabilised, attaining single-digit inflation in 2006\u20132007, real GDP growth, decreasing interest rates, and increasing levels of trade. Much of its growth is due to foreign investment in mining and to higher world copper prices. All this led to Zambia being courted enthusiastically by aid donors, and saw a surge in investor confidence in the country.\n\n==Politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Zambia}}\n\n[[File:Zambia National Assembly Building.jpg|thumb|Zambia National Assembly building in [[Lusaka]]]]\n\nPolitics in Zambia take place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[List of Presidents of Zambia|President of Zambia]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] in a pluriform [[multi-party system]].

At {{convert|752614|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} it is the 39th-largest country in the world, slightly smaller than [[Chile]]. The country lies mostly between latitudes [[8th parallel south|8\u00b0]] and [[18th parallel south|18\u00b0S]], and longitudes [[22nd meridian east|22\u00b0]] and [[34th meridian east|34\u00b0E]].\n\nZambia is drained by two major river basins: the [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]]/Kafue basin in the centre, west and south covering about three-quarters of the country; and the [[Congo River|Congo]] basin in the north covering about one-quarter of the country. A very small area in the northeast forms part of the internal drainage basin of [[Lake Rukwa]] in Tanzania.\n\nIn the Zambezi basin, there are a number of major rivers flowing wholly or partially through Zambia: the [[Kabompo River|Kabompo]], [[Lungwebungu River|Lungwebungu]], [[Kafue River|Kafue]], [[Luangwa River|Luangwa]], and the Zambezi itself, which flows through the country in the west and then forms its southern border with [[Namibia]], Botswana and [[Zimbabwe]]. Its source is in Zambia but it diverts into Angola, and a number of its tributaries rise in Angola's central highlands. The edge of the [[Cuando River]] floodplain (not its main channel) forms Zambia's southwestern border, and via the [[Chobe River]] that river contributes very little water to the Zambezi because most is lost by evaporation.<ref name=\"Beilfuss\">Beilfuss, Richard and dos Santos, David (2001)  [http://files.gorongosa.net/filestore/348-patterns_hydrological_change_zambezi_delta.pdf \"Patterns of Hydrological Change in the Zambezi Delta, Mozambique\".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217180850/http://files.gorongosa.net/filestore/348-patterns_hydrological_change_zambezi_delta.pdf |date=17 December 2008 }} Working Paper No 2 Program for the Sustainable Management of Cahora Bassa Dam and The Lower Zambezi Valley.</ref>\n\nTwo of the Zambezi's longest and largest tributaries, the Kafue and the Luangwa, flow mainly in Zambia. Their confluences with the Zambezi are on the border with Zimbabwe at Chirundu and [[Luangwa, Zambia|Luangwa town]] respectively. Before its confluence, the Luangwa River forms part of Zambia's border with [[Mozambique]]. From Luangwa town, the Zambezi leaves Zambia and flows into Mozambique, and eventually into the [[Mozambique Channel]].\n\nThe Zambezi falls about {{convert|100|m|ft|0}} over the {{convert|1.6|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide [[Victoria Falls]], located in the south-west corner of the country, subsequently flowing into [[Lake Kariba]]. The Zambezi valley, running along the southern border, is both deep and wide. From Lake Kariba going east it is formed by [[graben]]s and like the Luangwa, Mweru-Luapula, [[Mweru-wa-Ntipa]] and Lake Tanganyika valleys, is a [[rift valley]].\n\nThe north of Zambia is very flat with broad plains. In the west the most notable being the [[Barotse Floodplain]] on the Zambezi, which floods from December to June, lagging behind the annual rainy season (typically November to April). The [[floodplain|flood]] dominates the natural environment and the lives, society and culture of the inhabitants and those of other smaller, floodplains throughout the country.\n\n[[File:Cataratas Victoria, Zambia-Zimbabue, 2018-07-27, DD 05.jpg|thumb|[[Victoria Falls]]]]\nIn Eastern Zambia the plateau which extends between the Zambezi and Lake Tanganyika valleys is tilted upwards to the north, and so rises imperceptibly from about {{convert|900|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the south to {{convert|1200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the centre, reaching {{convert|1800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the north near Mbala.

The Luapula flows south then west before it turns north until it enters [[Lake Mweru]]. The lake's other major tributary is the [[Kalungwishi River]], which flows into it from the east. The [[Luvua River]] drains Lake Mweru, flowing out of the northern end to the [[Lualaba River]] (Upper Congo River).\n\n[[Lake Tanganyika]] is the other major [[hydrography|hydrographic]] feature that belongs to the Congo basin.

The tax hike and public sector wage freeze prohibited salary increases and new hires. This sparked a nationwide strike in February 2004.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090724213759/http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/articles.aspx?id=2108 The World Bank and IMF's long shadow in Zambia's copper mines]. eurodad.org. 20 February 2008</ref>\n\nThe Zambian government is pursuing an economic diversification program to reduce the economy's reliance on the copper industry. This initiative seeks to exploit other components of Zambia's rich resource base by promoting agriculture, tourism, gemstone mining, and hydro-power. In July 2018, Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan|Recep Tayyip Erdogan]] and Zambia's President Edgar Lungu signed 12 agreements in capital Lusaka on areas ranging from trade and investment to tourism and diplomacy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trtworld.com/africa/turkey-and-zambia-sign-agreements-to-boost-bilateral-ties-19216|title=Turkey and Zambia sign agreements to boost bilateral ties|website=Turkey and Zambia sign agreements to boost bilateral ties|language=tr-TR|access-date=2018-07-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aa.com.tr/en/africa/turkey-zambia-sign-12-deals-to-boost-bilateral-ties/1216679|title=Turkey, Zambia sign 12 deals to boost bilateral ties|access-date=2018-07-30}}</ref>\n\n===Mining===\nThe Zambian economy has historically been based on the [[copper mining]] industry. Output of copper had fallen to a low of 228,000 metric tons in 1998 after a 30-year decline in output due to lack of investment, low copper prices, and uncertainty over privatisation. In 2002, following privatisation of the industry, copper production rebounded to 337,000 metric tons. Improvements in the world copper market have magnified the effect of this volume increase on revenues and foreign exchange earnings.\n\n[[File:ZM-Nkana-headgear-Kitwe.jpg|thumb|left|The major Nkana open copper mine, [[Kitwe]].]]\nIn 2003, exports of [[nonmetal]]s increased by 25% and accounted for 38% of all export earnings, previously 35%.

One of the results of the colonial era was the growth of urbanisation. Different ethnic groups started living together in towns and cities, influencing each other as well as adopting a lot of the [[European culture]]. The original cultures have largely survived in the rural areas with some outside influence such as Christianity being widely practiced. In the urban setting there is a continuous integration and evolution of these cultures to produce what is now called \"Zambian culture\".\n\n[[File:African Art, Yombe sculpture, Louvre.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Yombe people|Yombe]] sculpture, 19th century.]]\nTraditional culture is very visible through colourful annual [[Zambian traditional ceremonies]]. Some of the more prominent are: [[Kuomboka]] and [[Kathanga]] (Western Province), [[Kazembe#Mutomboko Festival|Mutomboko]] (Luapula Province), [[Kulamba ceremony|Kulamba]] and [[Ncwala]] (Eastern Province), [[Lwiindi]] and [[Shimunenga]] (Southern Province), [[Lunda Lubanza]] (North Western), [[Likumbi Lyamize]] (North Western), [[Mbunda Lukwakwa]] (North Western Province), [[Chibwela Kumushi]] (Central Province), [[Vinkhakanimba]] (Muchinga Province), [[Ukusefya Pa Ng'wena]] (Northern Province).\n\nPopular traditional arts are mainly in pottery, basketry (such as [[Tonga baskets]]), stools, fabrics, mats, wooden carvings, ivory carvings, wire craft and copper crafts. Most [[Music of Zambia|Zambian traditional music]] is based on drums (and other percussion instruments) with a lot of singing and dancing. In the urban areas foreign genres of music are popular, in particular Congolese [[Soukous|rumba]], African-American music and Jamaican reggae. Several psychedelic rock artists emerged in the 1970s to create a genre known as [[Zam-rock]], including WITCH, Musi-O-Tunya, Rikki Ililonga, Amanaz, the Peace, Chrissy Zebby Tembo, Blackfoot, and the Ngozi Family.\n\n===Media===\n{{Main|Media in Zambia|Telecommunications in Zambia}}\nThe [https://web.archive.org/web/20130919070712/http://www.statehouse.gov.zm/en/ministry-of-information-and-broadcasting-services-p-o-box-50200-lusaka-zambia-tel-260-211-235410/ Ministry of Information, Broadcasting Services and Tourism In Zambia] is responsible for the [[Zambian News Agency]], while there are also numerous media outlets throughout the country which include; [[television station]]s, [[newspaper]]s, [[FM broadcasting|FM radio stations]], and [[Online journalism|Internet news websites]].\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in Zambia}}\nZambia declared its independence on the day of the closing ceremony of the [[1964 Summer Olympics]], thereby becoming the first country ever to have entered an Olympic games as one country, and left it as another. In 2016, Zambia participated for the thirteenth time in the Olympic games. Two medals were won. The medals were won successively in boxing and in track. In 1984 Keith Mwila won the bronze medal in the light flyweights. In 1996 Samuel Matete won the silver medal in the 400 meter hurdles. Zambia has never participated in the Winter olympics.\n\n[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Zambia, and the [[Zambia national football team]] has had its triumphant moments in football history. At the [[Seoul Olympics]] of 1988, the national team defeated the [[Italy national football team|Italian national team]] by a score of 4\u20130. [[Kalusha Bwalya]], Zambia's most celebrated football player and one of Africa's greatest football players in history had a hat trick in that match. However, to this day, many pundits say the greatest team Zambia has ever assembled was the one that perished on 28 April 1993 in a [[1993 Zambia national football team air disaster|plane crash]] at [[Libreville, Gabon]]. Despite this, in 1996, Zambia was ranked 15th on the official FIFA World Football Team rankings, the highest attained by any southern African team. In 2012, Zambia won the [[African Cup of Nations]] for the first time after losing in the final twice. They beat C\u00f4te d'Ivoire 8\u20137 in a penalty shoot-out in the final, which was played in Libreville, just a few kilometres away from the plane crash 19 years previously.<ref name=\"Africa Cup\">{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-sport/zambia-score-emotional-african-cup-win-20120213-1t0fb.html|title=Zambia score emotional African Cup win |work=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=11 February 2012|date=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Rugby Union]], [[boxing]] and [[cricket]] are also popular sports in Zambia.

Coach [[Luigi Simoni]] was fired when the side did not perform to the expected level, and the season saw a further three coaches trying to tame Inter without any success. Despite the chaos, the side managed to reach the quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Champions League]], where it lost to eventual champions [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].\n\nAnother worry was the injury problems affecting star striker [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], who only played in 19 of the 34 league matches (although in those 19 games he scored 14 goals). \n\nAfter the season, Inter signed [[Christian Vieri]] from [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] for a world-record transfer fee of \u00a332 million to help out with the goalscoring, while successful ex-[[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] coach [[Marcello Lippi]] was appointed in the hope he could end Inter's title drought.\n\n==Squad==\n:''Squad at end of season''<ref>[http://www.footballsquads.co.uk/italy/1998-1999/seriea/inter.html 1998\u201399 Inter Milan]{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n{{Fs start|nat=|pos=|other=|no=|name=}}\n{{Fs player|no=1|nat=ITA|pos=GK|name=[[Gianluca Pagliuca]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=2|nat=ITA|pos=DF|name=[[Giuseppe Bergomi]]|other=captain}}\n{{Fs player|no=3|nat=ITA|pos=DF|name=[[Francesco Colonnese]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=4|nat=ARG|pos=DF|name=[[Javier Zanetti]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=5|nat=ITA|pos=DF|name=[[Fabio Galante]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=6|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=[[Youri Djorkaeff]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=7|nat=ITA|pos=DF|name=[[Salvatore Fresi]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=8|nat=NED|pos=MF|name=[[Aron Winter]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=9|nat=BRA|pos=FW|name=[[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=ITA|pos=FW|name=[[Roberto Baggio]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=ITA|pos=FW|name=[[Nicola Ventola]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=13|nat=BRA|pos=MF|name=[[Z\u00e9 Elias]]|other=}}\n{{Fs mid|nat=|pos=|other=|no=|name=}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=ARG|pos=MF|name=[[Diego Simeone]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|nat=FRA|pos=MF|name=[[Beno\u00eet Cauet]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=16|nat=NGA|pos=DF|name=[[Taribo West]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=17|nat=ITA|pos=MF|name=[[Francesco Moriero]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=18|nat=CHI|pos=FW|name=[[Iv\u00e1n Zamorano]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=19|nat=POR|pos=MF|name=[[Paulo Sousa]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=20|nat=BRA|pos=MF|name=[[Gilberto da Silva Melo|Gilberto]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=21|nat=ITA|pos=MF|name=[[Andrea Pirlo]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=22|nat=FRA|pos=GK|name=[[Sebastien Frey]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=23|nat=CRO|pos=DF|name=[[Dario \u0160imi\u0107]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=24|nat=FRA|pos=DF|name=[[Mika\u00ebl Silvestre]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=25|nat=ITA|pos=DF|name=[[Mauro Milanese]]|other=on loan from [[Parma F.C.|Parma]]}}\n\n{{Fs end|nat=|pos=|other=|no=|name=}}\n\n=== Transfers ===\n\n<div style=\"float: left; width: 50%;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n! colspan=\"4\" | In<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.storiainter.com/Notes/Calcio%20mercato/Calciomercato%2010.htm|title=Acquisti e cessioni dell'Inter 1998/99|publisher=storiainter.com}}</ref>\n|-\n! width=3% | Pos.\n! width=33% | Name\n! width=28% | from\n! width=36% | Type\n|-\n| GK || [[S\u00e9bastien Frey]] || Cannes || ''loan ended''\n|-\n| GK || [[Giorgio Frezzolini]] || Fidelis Andria || ''loan ended''\n|-\n| DF || [[Zoumana Camara]] || Saint-Etienne || \n|-\n| DF || [[Matteo Ferrari]] || [[Genoa Cricket and Football Club|Genoa]] || ''loan ended''\n|-\n| DF || [[Mika\u00ebl Silvestre]] || Rennes || \n|-\n| MF || [[Ousmane Dabo]] || Rennes || \n|-\n| MF || [[Andrea Pirlo]] || [[Brescia Calcio|Brescia]] || \n|-\n| MF || [[Cristiano Zanetti]] || [[Reggiana]] || \n|-\n| FW || [[Roberto Baggio]] || [[Bologna F.C.|Bologna]] || \n|-\n| FW || [[Mohammed Kallon]] || [[Bologna F.C.|Bologna]] || ''loan ended''\n|-\n| FW || [[Alonso Piola]] || [[Internacional de Porto Alegre]] || ''loan ended''\n|-\n| FW || [[Gionatha Spinesi]] || Castel di Sangro || \n|-\n| FW || [[Nicola Ventola]] || Bari || \n|}\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"float: left; width: 50%;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n! colspan=\"4\" | Out\n|-\n! width=3% | Pos.\n! width=33% | Name\n! width=28% | To\n! width=36% | Type\n|-\n| GK || [[Giorgio Frezzolini]] || Cosenza/[[A.C.
