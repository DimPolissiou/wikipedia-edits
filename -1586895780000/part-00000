Several times he landed in trouble by associating with the wrong people, including his wife who tried to kill him. He served alongside [[Jacques MacDonald]] when they were both [[general of brigade|generals of brigade]] in the [[Flanders Campaign]] in 1794. Still commanding only a brigade, he served in MacDonald's army in Italy during 1799 and in Spain during 1810.\n\nIn 1784, he joined a [[dragoon]] regiment in the [[French Royal Army (1652-1830)|French Royal Army]] in 1784. He emerged as the commanding officer of the 3rd Infantry [[Demi-brigade]] in the ''[[Army of the Rhine (France)|Army of the Rhine]]'' in 1793. He led his unit at [[Battle of Haguenau (1793)|Haguenau]] and [[Second Battle of Wissembourg (1793)|Second Wissembourg]]. In 1794, he transferred to northeast France and was promoted to [[general officer]], subsequently fighting at [[Battle of Tourcoing|Tourcoing]], [[Battle of Tournay|Tournay]] and [[Siege of Ypres (1794)|Hooglede]]. After besieging and capturing the fortress of [[Grave, Netherlands|Grave]] he was on occupation duty in Belgium and Holland.\n\nSalme's friendship with the traitor [[Jean-Charles Pichegru]] caused him to be unemployed for over a year. He served in Italy in 1798 and led the army advance guard at the [[Battle of Trebbia (1799)|Trebbia]] in 1799 where he was wounded and captured by the Austrians. In 1802 he went on the [[Saint-Domingue expedition]] to [[Haiti]] but was sent home early, possibly for having a sexual liaison with [[Pauline Bonaparte]]. Then his wife tried to poison him and he was retired from the army. In 1809 he briefly led a second-line outfit in the [[Walcheren Campaign]]. The following year he was given a brigade and served in [[Catalonia]]. He was killed in action during the [[Siege of Tarragona (1811)|Siege of Tarragona]] in 1811. His surname is one of the [[names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe]], on Column 38.\n\n==Early career==\nSalme was born on 18 November 1766{{sfn|Broughton|2001}} in [[Aillianville]] to father Jean Baptiste Salme and mother Marie Jeanne Vignon. The godparents at the baptism were Nicolas Salme and Marie G\u00e9rard, the paternal grandfather and his second wife. Salme's father was a laborer and later became a timber merchant in 1784. Jean-Baptiste ''p\u00e8re'' was accused of misappropriating civic funds in 1789. The father's membership in the ''bourgeoisie'' may have aroused suspicion, causing him some trouble in May 1793, but he went on to become mayor in 1807. Jean Baptiste ''fils'' was well-educated by his uncle Gaspard who was a parish priest.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}}\n\nAgainst his parents' wishes, Salme ran off and enlisted in the Tribois company of the ''Noailles'' [[Dragoon]] Regiment on 16 April 1784. The unit's commander was [[Philippe Louis de Noailles]] and its garrison town was [[\u00c9pinal]]. The youthful dragoon was described as five feet four inches tall with light brown hair. He was round-faced and had a smallpox scar on his nose. He remained a simple private during his early military career, serving in garrison at [[Toulouse]] and [[Carcassonne]] in 1788 and [[Montauban]] in 1790. His father finally persuaded him that there was no future for him in the army and he left the service on 12 January 1791.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}}\n\n==War of the First Coalition==\n[[File:Arc de Triomphe mg 6850.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|alt=Photo of two stone panels with lists of surnames from the Arc of Triomphe.|SALM is name 6 on Column 38.]]\n\nOn 9 July 1791 a law provided for the formation of volunteer battalions and Salme joined the 1st Battalion of the ''Vosges'' [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] at [[Neufch\u00e2teau, Vosges|Neufch\u00e2teau]]. Recognizing his former service as a dragoon, the old soldier who commanded the battalion made him a [[sergeant]]. Salme so enthusiastically participated in the training of the battalion while it was cantoned at [[Saverne]] that he was promoted to [[second lieutenant|sous-lieutenant]] on 15 April 1792. He was married the next day to Jeanne Henriette Masse. War broke out on 20 April and the battalion was ordered to the front on 19 July. Salme was involved in operations around the Prussian siege of [[Longwy]], being wounded at [[R\u00fclzheim]] on 3 August 1792.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} The 1st ''Vosges'' Battalion was present at the capture of [[Speyer]] on 30 September when [[Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine]]'s 24,000-man ''[[Army of the Rhine (France)|Army of the Rhine]]'' trapped 3,600 Imperial troops in a bend of the [[Rhine]] River.{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=28}} In the spring of 1793 the 1st ''Vosges'' was in [[Jean Nicolas Houchard]]'s 1st Brigade of Joseph Victorin Nevinger's Left Wing near [[Bingen am Rhein]].{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=39}} On 14 September 1793 Salme greatly distinguished himself in an action at [[Nothweiler]] in which he was wounded.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}}\n\nOn 7 October 1793 Salme was named [[lieutenant colonel]] of the 15th ''Vosges'' Battalion, a unit of raw and undisciplined conscripts. Soon after, he was appointed to lead the 3rd Line Infantry [[Demi-brigade]]{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} as [[Chef de brigade|Chef de brigade (colonel)]] on 28 October.{{sfn|Broughton|2001}} On 30 October the 3rd Line belonged to the army's Center which was led by [[Louis Dominique Munnier]].{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=40}} During the subsequent [[Battle of Haguenau (1793)|Battle of Haguenau]], Salme seized Bettenhoffen from the Austrians on 1 December and fought at [[Berstheim]], winning commendation from army commander [[Jean-Charles Pichegru]]. On 18 December his unit fought Austrian hussars and he was wounded in the arm by a saber-cut. Nevertheless, he led his regiment in the [[Second Battle of Wissembourg (1793)|Second Battle of Wissembourg]] on 26 December 1793.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}}\n\n[[File:Pichegru.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=Black and white print of a man with a prominent widow's peak.

Salme took charge of a brigade in [[Jacques Philippe Bonnaud]]'s division which fought at the [[Battle of Tourcoing]] on 18 May and at the [[Battle of Tournay]] on 22 May.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} For the operations covering the [[Siege of Ypres (1794)|Siege of Ypres]] Salme's brigade formed part of [[\u00c9loi Laurent Despeaux]]'s division. When [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau]]'s troops invested [[Ypres]] on 1 June, the divisions of Despeaux on the right, [[Joseph Souham]] in the center and Pierre Antoine Michaud on the left provided the screening force. On 10 June the three screening divisions drove off a Coalition corps under [[Fran\u00e7ois S\u00e9bastien Charles Joseph de Croix, Count of Clerfayt]] from [[Roeselare|Roeselare (Roulers)]] after a stiff battle. At 7:00 am on the 13th Clerfayt launched a surprise attack on Despeaux's division, routing Philippe Joseph Malbrancq's brigade and pushing Salme's brigade back toward [[Menen]]. The next brigade in line, [[Jacques MacDonald]]'s of Souham's division resisted Clerfayt's attacks at [[Hooglede]] for six hours. At that time, [[Jan de Winter]]'s brigade arrived to support MacDonald's left and Salme's rallied soldiers moved forward on his right. The tired Coalition soldiers withdrew and Ypres fell on 18 June.{{sfn|Phipps|2011a|pp=312\u2013313}}\n\nSalme was seriously wounded and his horse killed under him on 13 July at [[Mechelen|Mechelen (Malines)]] while fighting along the [[Leuven]] Canal. He received credit for the seizure of the town.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} On 1 September Despeaux's 4th Division consisted of three battalions each of the 38th and 131st Line Infantry Demi-brigades, 3rd Battalion of Tirailleurs, 5th Battalion of Chasseurs, four squadrons of the 19th Cavalry and two squadrons of the 13th Chasseurs \u00e0 Cheval.{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=69}} Salme replaced Despeaux in command of the division on 20 September. He was ordered to invest the fortress of [[Grave, Netherlands|Grave]] which his division did on 17 October. Evidently siege artillery was not immediately available because cannons did not start firing at Grave's defenses until 1 December.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} Salme besieged the place with 3,000 soldiers. The 1,500 Dutch defenders were led by [[General-major]] de Bons and included the 2nd Battalion of the ''Waldeck'' Infantry Regiment, four companies of the Swiss ''May'' Regiment, the depot company of the ''Hessen-Darmstadt'' Regiment, 100 men from two [[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]] detachments and 100 gunners. Bons surrendered the 160-gun fortress on 29 December after his garrison sustained 16 casualties and eight desertions. Salme reported only 13 casualties.{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=97}}\n\nDuring the winter of 1794\u201395 Salme was involved in the invasion of the [[Dutch Republic]]. After his troops captured [[Utrecht]] on 17 January 1795, Pichegru assigned him the administration of  [[Amsterdam]]. Without unduly antagonizing the city's inhabitants, Salme was able to provide his soldiers with new uniforms and ample food. Next he was ordered to occupy [[Overijssel]] province. He helped clear the British forces out of [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] provinces, winning the approval of Souham. Later that year he seems to have served in the [[Rhine Campaign of 1795]] because he was in action at [[Altenkirchen]] and became friends with [[Jean Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber]]. Meanwhile, government agents stirred up trouble in Belgium with anticlerical activities and other abuses. In June 1796 Salme was assigned to a cavalry command in order to put down rebellions by unhappy Belgians. After running afoul of the French civil authorities of [[Brussels]] and the [[Dyle (department)|Department of the Dyle]], he was recalled by the [[French Directory]] on 12 February 1797.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} In April 1797, the commander of the ''[[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]]'', [[Lazare Hoche]] named Salme to command a dragoon brigade in [[Louis Klein]]'s division.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} When [[Michel Ney]] was captured on 21 April, Salme succeeded to command of the Hussar Division, but an armistice ended the fighting two days later.{{sfn|Phipps|2011b|p=427}}\n\n==War of the Second Coalition==\n[[File:MacDonald par Antoine Jean Gros.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|alt=Painting of a man decked out in an elaborate high-collared dark blue military uniform with lots of gold braid. His head is tilted back so his nose is slightly upturned and he has thinning gray hair.|Jacques MacDonald]]\n\nThe [[Coup of 18 Fructidor]] occurred on 4 September 1797 when the Royalist faction was overthrown by force. The treason of Pichegru came to light at this time and he was exiled from France. Because of his well-known friendship with the traitor, Salme was denounced by Hoche as \"Pichegru's vile spy\" and dismissed from the army. After over a year of forced retirement, he secured a post with the ''[[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|Army of Egypt]]'' on 9 November 1798 due to the intervention of Kl\u00e9ber. However, Salme missed the sailing at [[Ancona]] and instead joined the ''Army of Rome'' under [[Jean \u00c9tienne Championnet]].{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} At that time [[Guillaume Philibert Duhesme]]'s division of 3,000\u20134,000 men was near Ancona. In the face of an attack by the [[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitan]] army, Championnet evacuated [[Rome]] on 27 November. However, the Neapolitan army quickly unraveled and the French recaptured Rome on 15 December{{sfn|Phipps|2011c|pp=240\u2013241}} and seized [[Naples]] itself on 23 January 1799. Soon after, Championnet got into a dispute with French government agents, was removed from command on 28 February and placed under arrest. MacDonald replaced him as commander of the army.{{sfn|Phipps|2011c|pp=246\u2013248}}\n\nIn view of the French defeats in northern Italy, MacDonald was instructed to garrison central and southern Italy and come north by forced marches with the ''Army of Naples''. The order arrived on 14 April 1799 and MacDonald began his move north on 7 May.{{sfn|Phipps|2011c|pp=271\u2013272}} MacDonald named Salme to lead the 2,997-man army Advance Guard which was made up of the 15th Light (1,390 men) and 11th Line (1,440 men) Infantry Demi-brigades, 94 troopers from the 25th Chasseurs \u00e0 Cheval and 53 gunners and sappers.{{sfn|Duffy|1999|p=97}} At 8:00 am on 17 June 1799, MacDonald opened the [[Battle of Trebbia (1799)|Battle of Trebbia]] by sending 18,700 soldiers from the divisions of [[Claude Perrin Victor]], [[Jean-Baptiste Dominique Rusca]] and [[Jean Henri Dombrowski]] plus Salme's Advance Guard into action. At first the French pressed back the Austrians of [[Peter Karl Ott von B\u00e1tork\u00e9z]] but reinforcements began to arrive until the Coalition commander [[Alexander Suvorov]] had 30,656 Austrians and Russians on the field. MacDonald had been wounded at the [[Battle of Modena (1799)|Battle of Modena]] and delegated Victor to direct the assault. But Victor never took charge of the troops that day and the French fought without a guiding hand. Late in the day, Salme's Advance Guard covered the retreat of the three French divisions behind the [[Tidone]] River.{{sfn|Duffy|1999|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nSalme's troops were only Frenchmen that remained east of the [[Trebbia]] River. On 18 June MacDonald waited for his three missing divisions to arrive on the battlefield. Meanwhile, Suvorov planned to launch a powerful stroke with his right wing but was unable to get his columns moving. It was so quiet that Salme asked permission to go into [[Piacenza]]. The Coalition assault began at 4:00 pm and struck Salme first. He was ordered to retreat as soon as the enemy applied pressure but instead he stood his ground. Salme was wounded and so was his successor Jean Sarrazin. Finally [[Louis Joseph Lahure]] took command and withdrew the Advance Guard behind the Trebbia, but not without some confusion.{{sfn|Phipps|2011b|p=289}} When the ''Army of Naples'' retreated on 20 June it left behind wounded generals Salme, Rusca and Jean-Baptiste Olivier.{{sfn|Duffy|1999|p=112}} Salme was held a prisoner by the Austrians until the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] in March 1801.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}}\n\n==Saint-Domingue and career eclipse==\nSalme went on the [[Saint-Domingue expedition]] arriving in [[Hispaniola]] on 5 February 1802. He was assigned to command the 13th Brigade in [[Jean Hardy]]'s division.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} The expedition commander [[Charles Leclerc (general, born 1772)|Charles Leclerc]] immediately organized a sweep to round up Haitian forces led by [[Toussaint Louverture]]. During the operation, Hardy took Salme's brigade on an all-night march to surprise a Haitian base at Bayonnais. Much of [[Haiti]] was brought under French control but large Haitian forces escaped and Hardy's division returned to [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien|Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]].{{sfn|Hardy de Perini|1901|pp=275\u2013279}} Leclerc promoted Salme [[general of division]] on 15 May 1802 and immediately set him back to France for reasons which remain unclear. The possibilities are that he was sick, that he was harshly critical of restoring slavery in Hispaniola, that he was dealing in the black market and, finally, that he had become the lover of [[Pauline Bonaparte]], Leclerc's wife. In any case he was directed to report on the condition of the army when he got back to France.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} That year Leclerc and Hardy and most of the army perished from [[yellow fever]].{{sfn|Hardy de Perini|1901|pp=290\u2013292}}\n\nOn 16 October 1802 Salme was placed in inactive status and given an annual pension of 5,000 francs. On 26 August 1803 he was retired with a pension of 2,500 francs. He took up residence in [[Drusenheim]] on a property co-owned by his father-in-law. His wife Jeanne Henriette tried to poison him but a loyal servant warned him in time and the only fatality was his dog. He moved to the market square of Neufch\u00e2teau and went into business with another man as manufacturers of starch. Because of his association with Moreau the police had him under surveillance in June 1804. He sent many letters to the War Ministry asking to be employed but he was ignored even though he had the sympathy of [[Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville]]. Much of his time was taken up by a property dispute with his wife. On 8 August 1809 he was given command of a brigade of National Guards and served in the [[Walcheren Campaign]]. Though he performed his duties properly, he was sent home on 29 September 1809.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}}\n\n==Tarragona and death==\n[[File:TarragonaTorreScipioni.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|alt=Photo of an ancient crumbling monument that includes two standing figures.|Tower of the Scipios]]\n\nSouham was home from the [[Peninsular War]] with a wound and Salme asked that general to get him a combat posting. On 16 April 1810 he was appointed to the [[VII Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|VII Corps]] also known as the ''Army of Catalonia''.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} At that time [[Louis-Gabriel Suchet]] was getting ready to [[Siege of Tortosa (1810)|besiege Tortosa]] with his [[III Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|III Corps]]. MacDonald's VII Corps was supposed to support Suchet's operation by threatening [[Tarragona]] in August 1810.{{sfn|Oman|1996a|pp=494\u2013496}} On 14 September, the Spanish under [[Henry O'Donnell]] wiped out one of MacDonald's brigades in a successful raid at the [[Battle of La Bisbal]] well to the north. As the Spanish column, without O'Donnell who had been wounded, passed near MacDonald the French general moved against it. On 21 October 1810, an Italian brigade under Francesco Orsatelli Eugenio supported by a French brigade under Salme attacked the Spanish position at [[Cardona, Spain|Cardona]]. Eugenio's reckless initial assault was repulsed with 100 casualties and MacDonald withdrew.{{sfn|Oman|1996a|pp=498\u2013500}}\n\nEmperor [[Napoleon]] directed Suchet to capture the port city of Tarragona and promised that general that he would find his [[Marshals of France|marshal's baton]] inside its walls. Unhappy with the operations of MacDonald, the emperor boosted Suchet's army from 26,000 to 43,000 troops by transferring soldiers from MacDonald's VII Corps in March 1811.{{sfn|Oman|1996b|pp=484\u2013485}} After detaching 20 battalions as garrisons and observation forces, Suchet assembled 29 battalions for his siege force. These were grouped into infantry divisions under [[Jean Isidore Harispe]], [[Bernard-Georges-Fran\u00e7ois Fr\u00e8re]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Habert]] and 1,400 cavalry led by [[Andr\u00e9 Joseph Boussart]]. There were also 2,000 gunners and 750 engineers and sappers attached to the army. Harispe and Fr\u00e8re marched from [[Lleida|Lleida (L\u00e9rida)]] while Habert moved from [[Tortosa]] along the coast with the siege train.{{sfn|Oman|1996b|pp=486\u2013487}} Harispe's division occupied [[Montblanc, Tarragona|Montblanc]] on 29 April 1811 and [[Reus]] on 2 May. Leading the inland column, Salme's advanced guard pushed the Spanish outposts behind the [[Francol\u00ed (river)|Francol\u00ed River]] on 3 May.{{sfn|Oman|1996b|p=497}} Salme became a member of the [[L\u00e9gion d'Honneur]] on 7 May 1811.{{sfn|Broughton|2001}}\n\nNorth of Tarragona lay Monte Olivo which overlooked the lower town. Atop the feature, the Spanish defenders built the powerful Fort Olivo, protected by a ditch carved into solid rock and defended by 1,000 soldiers. Suchet and his engineers determined to start the [[Siege of Tarragona (1811)|Siege of Tarragona]] from the west side, but first they needed to capture Fort Olivo from which the Spanish could take the siege trenches under a crossfire. Suchet arranged his divisions with Habert on the right at the coast, Fr\u00e8re in the center straddling the Francol\u00ed and Harispe on the left. In Harispe's division Salme's French brigade faced Fort Olivo while the two Italian brigades reached around to touch the coast east of Tarragona.{{sfn|Oman|1996b|pp=499\u2013500}} Harispe's division included three battalions each of the 7th and 16th Line Infantry Regiments and eight Italian battalions.{{sfn|Oman|1996b|p=643}} On 13 May the French captured two small fortifications in front of Fort Olivo and beat back a three-battalion counterattack by the Spanish the next day. Because the main attack from the west was delayed, Suchet decided to concentrate a vigorous effort against Fort Olivo beginning on 23 May. Over the next few days batteries before the fort were armed with 13 cannons which began to inflict serious damage on it.{{sfn|Oman|1996b|pp=501\u2013503}} On the night of 27 May, as French soldiers dragged four [[Canon de 24 Gribeauval|24-pound cannons]] into battery, they were blasted by Spanish fire which caused numerous casualties. At this moment, the defenders mounted a sortie from Fort Olivo. Watching the proceedings carefully, Salme called out to his reserves, \"Brave 7th forward!\" He was struck in the head by a musket ball and killed instantly. The men rushed past him and repulsed the Spanish attack.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} Fort Olivo fell on the night of the 29th with heavy losses to the defenders.{{sfn|Oman|1996b|pp=504\u2013505}}\n\nSalme was buried under a nearby aqueduct, the [[Pont de les Ferreres]], and his embalmed heart was placed in the ''Tower of the Scipios'' along the road to [[Barcelona]]. After the French captured Tarragona they changed the name of Fort Olivo to Fort Salme. Since Salme had no children and was in the process of divorcing his wife, his financial assets were distributed among his brothers and sisters. Napoleon granted his father a 1,000 franc per year annuity.

In 1794, he transferred to northeast France and was promoted to [[general officer]], subsequently fighting at [[Battle of Tourcoing|Tourcoing]], [[Battle of Tournay|Tournay]] and [[Siege of Ypres (1794)|Hooglede]]. After besieging and capturing the fortress of [[Grave, Netherlands|Grave]] he was on occupation duty in Belgium and Holland.\n\nSalme's friendship with the traitor [[Jean-Charles Pichegru]] caused him to be unemployed for over a year. He served in Italy in 1798 and led the army advance guard at the [[Battle of Trebbia (1799)|Trebbia]] in 1799 where he was wounded and captured by the Austrians. In 1802 he went on the [[Saint-Domingue expedition]] to [[Haiti]] but was sent home early, possibly for having a sexual liaison with [[Pauline Bonaparte]]. Then his wife tried to poison him and he was retired from the army. In 1809 he briefly led a second-line outfit in the [[Walcheren Campaign]]. The following year he was given a brigade and served in [[Catalonia]]. He was killed in action during the [[Siege of Tarragona (1811)|Siege of Tarragona]] in 1811. His surname is one of the [[names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe]], on Column 38.\n\n==Early career==\nSalme was born on 18 November 1766{{sfn|Broughton|2001}} in [[Aillianville]] to father Jean Baptiste Salme and mother Marie Jeanne Vignon. The godparents at the baptism were Nicolas Salme and Marie G\u00e9rard, the paternal grandfather and his second wife. Salme's father was a laborer and later became a timber merchant in 1784. Jean-Baptiste ''p\u00e8re'' was accused of misappropriating civic funds in 1789. The father's membership in the ''bourgeoisie'' may have aroused suspicion, causing him some trouble in May 1793, but he went on to become mayor in 1807. Jean Baptiste ''fils'' was well-educated by his uncle Gaspard who was a parish priest.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}}\n\nAgainst his parents' wishes, Salme ran off and enlisted in the Tribois company of the ''Noailles'' [[Dragoon]] Regiment on 16 April 1784. The unit's commander was [[Philippe Louis de Noailles]] and its garrison town was [[\u00c9pinal]]. The youthful dragoon was described as five feet four inches tall with light brown hair. He was round-faced and had a smallpox scar on his nose. He remained a simple private during his early military career, serving in garrison at [[Toulouse]] and [[Carcassonne]] in 1788 and [[Montauban]] in 1790. His father finally persuaded him that there was no future for him in the army and he left the service on 12 January 1791.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}}\n\n==War of the First Coalition==\n[[File:Arc de Triomphe mg 6850.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|alt=Photo of two stone panels with lists of surnames from the Arc of Triomphe.|SALM is name 6 on Column 38.]]\n\nOn 9 July 1791 a law provided for the formation of volunteer battalions and Salme joined the 1st Battalion of the ''Vosges'' [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]] at [[Neufch\u00e2teau, Vosges|Neufch\u00e2teau]]. Recognizing his former service as a dragoon, the old soldier who commanded the battalion made him a [[sergeant]]. Salme so enthusiastically participated in the training of the battalion while it was cantoned at [[Saverne]] that he was promoted to [[second lieutenant|sous-lieutenant]] on 15 April 1792. He was married the next day to Jeanne Henriette Masse. War broke out on 20 April and the battalion was ordered to the front on 19 July. Salme was involved in operations around the Prussian siege of [[Longwy]], being wounded at [[R\u00fclzheim]] on 3 August 1792.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} The 1st ''Vosges'' Battalion was present at the capture of [[Speyer]] on 30 September when [[Adam Philippe, Comte de Custine]]'s 24,000-man ''[[Army of the Rhine (France)|Army of the Rhine]]'' trapped 3,600 Imperial troops in a bend of the [[Rhine]] River.{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=28}} In the spring of 1793 the 1st ''Vosges'' was in [[Jean Nicolas Houchard]]'s 1st Brigade of Joseph Victorin Nevinger's Left Wing near [[Bingen am Rhein]].{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=39}} On 14 September 1793 Salme greatly distinguished himself in an action at [[Nothweiler]] in which he was wounded.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}}\n\nOn 7 October 1793 Salme was named [[lieutenant colonel]] of the 15th ''Vosges'' Battalion, a unit of raw and undisciplined conscripts. Soon after, he was appointed to lead the 3rd Line Infantry [[Demi-brigade]]{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} as [[Chef de brigade|Chef de brigade (colonel)]] on 28 October.{{sfn|Broughton|2001}} On 30 October the 3rd Line belonged to the army's Center which was led by [[Louis Dominique Munnier]].{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=40}} During the subsequent [[Battle of Haguenau (1793)|Battle of Haguenau]], Salme seized Bettenhoffen from the Austrians on 1 December and fought at [[Berstheim]], winning commendation from army commander [[Jean-Charles Pichegru]]. On 18 December his unit fought Austrian hussars and he was wounded in the arm by a saber-cut. Nevertheless, he led his regiment in the [[Second Battle of Wissembourg (1793)|Second Battle of Wissembourg]] on 26 December 1793.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}}\n\n[[File:Pichegru.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=Black and white print of a man with a prominent widow's peak.

Salme took charge of a brigade in [[Jacques Philippe Bonnaud]]'s division which fought at the [[Battle of Tourcoing]] on 18 May and at the [[Battle of Tournay]] on 22 May.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} For the operations covering the [[Siege of Ypres (1794)|Siege of Ypres]] Salme's brigade formed part of [[\u00c9loi Laurent Despeaux]]'s division. When [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau]]'s troops invested [[Ypres]] on 1 June, the divisions of Despeaux on the right, [[Joseph Souham]] in the center and Pierre Antoine Michaud on the left provided the screening force. On 10 June the three screening divisions drove off a Coalition corps under [[Fran\u00e7ois S\u00e9bastien Charles Joseph de Croix, Count of Clerfayt]] from [[Roeselare|Roeselare (Roulers)]] after a stiff battle. At 7:00 am on the 13th Clerfayt launched a surprise attack on Despeaux's division, routing Philippe Joseph Malbrancq's brigade and pushing Salme's brigade back toward [[Menen]]. The next brigade in line, [[Jacques MacDonald]]'s of Souham's division resisted Clerfayt's attacks at [[Hooglede]] for six hours. At that time, [[Jan de Winter]]'s brigade arrived to support MacDonald's left and Salme's rallied soldiers moved forward on his right. The tired Coalition soldiers withdrew and Ypres fell on 18 June.{{sfn|Phipps|2011a|pp=312\u2013313}}\n\nSalme was seriously wounded and his horse killed under him on 13 July at [[Mechelen|Mechelen (Malines)]] while fighting along the [[Leuven]] Canal. He received credit for the seizure of the town.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} On 1 September Despeaux's 4th Division consisted of three battalions each of the 38th and 131st Line Infantry Demi-brigades, 3rd Battalion of Tirailleurs, 5th Battalion of Chasseurs, four squadrons of the 19th Cavalry and two squadrons of the 13th Chasseurs \u00e0 Cheval.{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=69}} Salme replaced Despeaux in command of the division on 20 September. He was ordered to invest the fortress of [[Grave, Netherlands|Grave]] which his division did on 17 October. Evidently siege artillery was not immediately available because cannons did not start firing at Grave's defenses until 1 December.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} Salme besieged the place with 3,000 soldiers. The 1,500 Dutch defenders were led by [[General-major]] de Bons and included the 2nd Battalion of the ''Waldeck'' Infantry Regiment, four companies of the Swiss ''May'' Regiment, the depot company of the ''Hessen-Darmstadt'' Regiment, 100 men from two [[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]] detachments and 100 gunners. Bons surrendered the 160-gun fortress on 29 December after his garrison sustained 16 casualties and eight desertions. Salme reported only 13 casualties.{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=97}}\n\nDuring the winter of 1794\u201395 Salme was involved in the invasion of the [[Dutch Republic]]. After his troops captured [[Utrecht]] on 17 January 1795, Pichegru assigned him the administration of  [[Amsterdam]]. Without unduly antagonizing the city's inhabitants, Salme was able to provide his soldiers with new uniforms and ample food. Next he was ordered to occupy [[Overijssel]] province. He helped clear the British forces out of [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] provinces, winning the approval of Souham. Later that year he seems to have served in the [[Rhine Campaign of 1795]] because he was in action at [[Altenkirchen]] and became friends with [[Jean Baptiste Kl\u00e9ber]]. Meanwhile, government agents stirred up trouble in Belgium with anticlerical activities and other abuses. In June 1796 Salme was assigned to a cavalry command in order to put down rebellions by unhappy Belgians. After running afoul of the French civil authorities of [[Brussels]] and the [[Dyle (department)|Department of the Dyle]], he was recalled by the [[French Directory]] on 12 February 1797.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} In April 1797, the commander of the ''[[Army of Sambre-et-Meuse]]'', [[Lazare Hoche]] named Salme to command a dragoon brigade in [[Louis Klein]]'s division.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} When [[Michel Ney]] was captured on 21 April, Salme succeeded to command of the Hussar Division, but an armistice ended the fighting two days later.{{sfn|Phipps|2011b|p=427}}\n\n==War of the Second Coalition==\n[[File:MacDonald par Antoine Jean Gros.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|alt=Painting of a man decked out in an elaborate high-collared dark blue military uniform with lots of gold braid. His head is tilted back so his nose is slightly upturned and he has thinning gray hair.|Jacques MacDonald]]\n\nThe [[Coup of 18 Fructidor]] occurred on 4 September 1797 when the Royalist faction was overthrown by force. The treason of Pichegru came to light at this time and he was exiled from France. Because of his well-known friendship with the traitor, Salme was denounced by Hoche as \"Pichegru's vile spy\" and dismissed from the army. After over a year of forced retirement, he secured a post with the ''[[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|Army of Egypt]]'' on 9 November 1798 due to the intervention of Kl\u00e9ber. However, Salme missed the sailing at [[Ancona]] and instead joined the ''Army of Rome'' under [[Jean \u00c9tienne Championnet]].{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} At that time [[Guillaume Philibert Duhesme]]'s division of 3,000\u20134,000 men was near Ancona. In the face of an attack by the [[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitan]] army, Championnet evacuated [[Rome]] on 27 November. However, the Neapolitan army quickly unraveled and the French recaptured Rome on 15 December{{sfn|Phipps|2011c|pp=240\u2013241}} and seized [[Naples]] itself on 23 January 1799. Soon after, Championnet got into a dispute with French government agents, was removed from command on 28 February and placed under arrest. MacDonald replaced him as commander of the army.{{sfn|Phipps|2011c|pp=246\u2013248}}\n\nIn view of the French defeats in northern Italy, MacDonald was instructed to garrison central and southern Italy and come north by forced marches with the ''Army of Naples''. The order arrived on 14 April 1799 and MacDonald began his move north on 7 May.{{sfn|Phipps|2011c|pp=271\u2013272}} MacDonald named Salme to lead the 2,997-man army Advance Guard which was made up of the 15th Light (1,390 men) and 11th Line (1,440 men) Infantry Demi-brigades, 94 troopers from the 25th Chasseurs \u00e0 Cheval and 53 gunners and sappers.{{sfn|Duffy|1999|p=97}} At 8:00 am on 17 June 1799, MacDonald opened the [[Battle of Trebbia (1799)|Battle of Trebbia]] by sending 18,700 soldiers from the divisions of [[Claude Perrin Victor]], [[Jean-Baptiste Dominique Rusca]] and [[Jean Henri Dombrowski]] plus Salme's Advance Guard into action. At first the French pressed back the Austrians of [[Peter Karl Ott von B\u00e1tork\u00e9z]] but reinforcements began to arrive until the Coalition commander [[Alexander Suvorov]] had 30,656 Austrians and Russians on the field. MacDonald had been wounded at the [[Battle of Modena (1799)|Battle of Modena]] and delegated Victor to direct the assault. But Victor never took charge of the troops that day and the French fought without a guiding hand. Late in the day, Salme's Advance Guard covered the retreat of the three French divisions behind the [[Tidone]] River.{{sfn|Duffy|1999|pp=94\u201395}}\n\nSalme's troops were only Frenchmen that remained east of the [[Trebbia]] River. On 18 June MacDonald waited for his three missing divisions to arrive on the battlefield. Meanwhile, Suvorov planned to launch a powerful stroke with his right wing but was unable to get his columns moving. It was so quiet that Salme asked permission to go into [[Piacenza]]. The Coalition assault began at 4:00 pm and struck Salme first. He was ordered to retreat as soon as the enemy applied pressure but instead he stood his ground. Salme was wounded and so was his successor Jean Sarrazin. Finally [[Louis Joseph Lahure]] took command and withdrew the Advance Guard behind the Trebbia, but not without some confusion.{{sfn|Phipps|2011b|p=289}} When the ''Army of Naples'' retreated on 20 June it left behind wounded generals Salme, Rusca and Jean-Baptiste Olivier.{{sfn|Duffy|1999|p=112}} Salme was held a prisoner by the Austrians until the [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] in March 1801.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}}\n\n==Saint-Domingue and career eclipse==\nSalme went on the [[Saint-Domingue expedition]] arriving in [[Hispaniola]] on 5 February 1802. He was assigned to command the 13th Brigade in [[Jean Hardy]]'s division.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} The expedition commander [[Charles Leclerc (general)|Charles Leclerc]] immediately organized a sweep to round up Haitian forces led by [[Toussaint Louverture]]. During the operation, Hardy took Salme's brigade on an all-night march to surprise a Haitian base at Bayonnais. Much of [[Haiti]] was brought under French control but large Haitian forces escaped and Hardy's division returned to [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien|Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]].{{sfn|Hardy de Perini|1901|pp=275\u2013279}} Leclerc promoted Salme [[general of division]] on 15 May 1802 and immediately set him back to France for reasons which remain unclear. The possibilities are that he was sick, that he was harshly critical of restoring slavery in Hispaniola, that he was dealing in the black market and, finally, that he had become the lover of [[Pauline Bonaparte]], Leclerc's wife. In any case he was directed to report on the condition of the army when he got back to France.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} That year Leclerc and Hardy and most of the army perished from [[yellow fever]].{{sfn|Hardy de Perini|1901|pp=290\u2013292}}\n\nOn 16 October 1802 Salme was placed in inactive status and given an annual pension of 5,000 francs. On 26 August 1803 he was retired with a pension of 2,500 francs. He took up residence in [[Drusenheim]] on a property co-owned by his father-in-law. His wife Jeanne Henriette tried to poison him but a loyal servant warned him in time and the only fatality was his dog. He moved to the market square of Neufch\u00e2teau and went into business with another man as manufacturers of starch. Because of his association with Moreau the police had him under surveillance in June 1804. He sent many letters to the War Ministry asking to be employed but he was ignored even though he had the sympathy of [[Pierre de Ruel, marquis de Beurnonville]]. Much of his time was taken up by a property dispute with his wife. On 8 August 1809 he was given command of a brigade of National Guards and served in the [[Walcheren Campaign]]. Though he performed his duties properly, he was sent home on 29 September 1809.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}}\n\n==Tarragona and death==\n[[File:TarragonaTorreScipioni.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|alt=Photo of an ancient crumbling monument that includes two standing figures.|Tower of the Scipios]]\n\nSouham was home from the [[Peninsular War]] with a wound and Salme asked that general to get him a combat posting. On 16 April 1810 he was appointed to the [[VII Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|VII Corps]] also known as the ''Army of Catalonia''.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} At that time [[Louis-Gabriel Suchet]] was getting ready to [[Siege of Tortosa (1810)|besiege Tortosa]] with his [[III Corps (Grande Arm\u00e9e)|III Corps]]. MacDonald's VII Corps was supposed to support Suchet's operation by threatening [[Tarragona]] in August 1810.{{sfn|Oman|1996a|pp=494\u2013496}} On 14 September, the Spanish under [[Henry O'Donnell]] wiped out one of MacDonald's brigades in a successful raid at the [[Battle of La Bisbal]] well to the north. As the Spanish column, without O'Donnell who had been wounded, passed near MacDonald the French general moved against it. On 21 October 1810, an Italian brigade under Francesco Orsatelli Eugenio supported by a French brigade under Salme attacked the Spanish position at [[Cardona, Spain|Cardona]]. Eugenio's reckless initial assault was repulsed with 100 casualties and MacDonald withdrew.{{sfn|Oman|1996a|pp=498\u2013500}}\n\nEmperor [[Napoleon]] directed Suchet to capture the port city of Tarragona and promised that general that he would find his [[Marshals of France|marshal's baton]] inside its walls. Unhappy with the operations of MacDonald, the emperor boosted Suchet's army from 26,000 to 43,000 troops by transferring soldiers from MacDonald's VII Corps in March 1811.{{sfn|Oman|1996b|pp=484\u2013485}} After detaching 20 battalions as garrisons and observation forces, Suchet assembled 29 battalions for his siege force. These were grouped into infantry divisions under [[Jean Isidore Harispe]], [[Bernard-Georges-Fran\u00e7ois Fr\u00e8re]] and [[Pierre-Joseph Habert]] and 1,400 cavalry led by [[Andr\u00e9 Joseph Boussart]]. There were also 2,000 gunners and 750 engineers and sappers attached to the army. Harispe and Fr\u00e8re marched from [[Lleida|Lleida (L\u00e9rida)]] while Habert moved from [[Tortosa]] along the coast with the siege train.{{sfn|Oman|1996b|pp=486\u2013487}} Harispe's division occupied [[Montblanc, Tarragona|Montblanc]] on 29 April 1811 and [[Reus]] on 2 May. Leading the inland column, Salme's advanced guard pushed the Spanish outposts behind the [[Francol\u00ed (river)|Francol\u00ed River]] on 3 May.{{sfn|Oman|1996b|p=497}} Salme became a member of the [[L\u00e9gion d'Honneur]] on 7 May 1811.{{sfn|Broughton|2001}}\n\nNorth of Tarragona lay Monte Olivo which overlooked the lower town. Atop the feature, the Spanish defenders built the powerful Fort Olivo, protected by a ditch carved into solid rock and defended by 1,000 soldiers. Suchet and his engineers determined to start the [[Siege of Tarragona (1811)|Siege of Tarragona]] from the west side, but first they needed to capture Fort Olivo from which the Spanish could take the siege trenches under a crossfire. Suchet arranged his divisions with Habert on the right at the coast, Fr\u00e8re in the center straddling the Francol\u00ed and Harispe on the left. In Harispe's division Salme's French brigade faced Fort Olivo while the two Italian brigades reached around to touch the coast east of Tarragona.{{sfn|Oman|1996b|pp=499\u2013500}} Harispe's division included three battalions each of the 7th and 16th Line Infantry Regiments and eight Italian battalions.{{sfn|Oman|1996b|p=643}} On 13 May the French captured two small fortifications in front of Fort Olivo and beat back a three-battalion counterattack by the Spanish the next day. Because the main attack from the west was delayed, Suchet decided to concentrate a vigorous effort against Fort Olivo beginning on 23 May. Over the next few days batteries before the fort were armed with 13 cannons which began to inflict serious damage on it.{{sfn|Oman|1996b|pp=501\u2013503}} On the night of 27 May, as French soldiers dragged four [[Canon de 24 Gribeauval|24-pound cannons]] into battery, they were blasted by Spanish fire which caused numerous casualties. At this moment, the defenders mounted a sortie from Fort Olivo. Watching the proceedings carefully, Salme called out to his reserves, \"Brave 7th forward!\" He was struck in the head by a musket ball and killed instantly. The men rushed past him and repulsed the Spanish attack.{{sfn|Desnouveaux|2006}} Fort Olivo fell on the night of the 29th with heavy losses to the defenders.{{sfn|Oman|1996b|pp=504\u2013505}}\n\nSalme was buried under a nearby aqueduct, the [[Pont de les Ferreres]], and his embalmed heart was placed in the ''Tower of the Scipios'' along the road to [[Barcelona]]. After the French captured Tarragona they changed the name of Fort Olivo to Fort Salme. Since Salme had no children and was in the process of divorcing his wife, his financial assets were distributed among his brothers and sisters.

He later appointed [[Cesar Virata|C\u00e9sar Virata]] as Prime Minister in 1981.\n\nThis Constitution was in effect until the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986 toppled Marcos's 21-year authoritarian regime and replaced him with [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon C. Aquino]].\n\n===Fifth Republic===\nRuling by decree during the early part of her tenure and as a president installed by revolutionary means, President Corazon Aquino issued [[Constitution of the Philippines|Proclamation No. 3]] on March 25, 1986 which abrogated many of the provisions of the then 1973 Constitution, including the provisions associated with the Marcos regime which gave the president legislative powers, as well as the unicameral legislature called the Batasang Pambansa (literally ''National Legislature'' in Filipino). Often called the \"Freedom Constitution,\" the proclamation retained only parts of the 1973 Constitution that were essential for a return to democratic rule, such as the bill of rights. This constitution was superseded on February 2, 1987 by the present constitution.\n\n=== Other issues ===\nBoth Bonifacio and Aguinaldo might be considered to have been an inaugural president of an insurgent government. Quezon was the inaugural president of a predecessor state to the current one, while Aquino, ''m\u00e8re'', was the inaugural president of the currently-constituted government.\n\nThe government considers Aguinaldo to have been the first president of the Philippines, followed by Quezon and his successors.<ref name=tucker2009p8>{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=Spencer C. |title=The encyclopedia of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars: a political, social, and military history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8V3vZxOmHssC|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-951-1|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8V3vZxOmHssC&pg=PA8 8]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=200029&Itemid=26|title=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}</ref> Despite the differences in [[Constitution of the Philippines|constitutions]] and government, the line of presidents is considered to be continuous. For instance, the current president, Rodrigo R. Duterte, is considered to be the 16th president.\n\nWhile the government may consider Aguinaldo as the first president, the First Republic fell under the United States' jurisdiction due to the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|1898 Treaty of Paris]] which ended the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]; the United States thus does not consider his tenure to have been legitimate.<ref name=tucker2009p8 /><ref>[https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/aguinaldo.html Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy], U.S. Library of Congress.</ref> [[Manuel L. Quezon]] is considered to be the first president by the United States.  He is also the first to win a popular election and a nationwide election.\n\n==== Laurel's position ====\n[[File:Jose P. Laurel giving a speech.jpg|thumb|[[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]] giving a speech after his inauguration as President of the [[Second Philippine Republic]]]]\nAs with many other [[Axis Powers|Axis]]-occupied countries in the Second World War, the Philippines had at one point two presidents heading two governments. One was Quezon and the Commonwealth [[Government in exile|government-in-exile]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the other was Manila-based Laurel heading the Japanese-sponsored Second Republic. Notably, Laurel was himself instructed to remain in Manila by President Quezon.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Laurel was not formally recognized as a president until the rule of [[Diosdado Macapagal]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=some reliable source reporting that recognition should be easy to find}} His inclusion in the official list coincided with the transfer of the official date of Independence Day from July 4 (the anniversary of the Philippines' independence from the United States) to June 12 (the anniversary of the 1898 Declaration of Independence).\n\nThe inclusion of Laurel thus causes some problems in determining the order of presidents. It is inaccurate to call Laurel the successor of Osme\u00f1a or vice versa, since Laurel's Second Republic was formally repudiated after World War II, its actions not considered legal or binding. Quezon, Osme\u00f1a, and Roxas were seen as being in a contiguous line according to the 1935 Constitution, while Laurel was the only president of the Second Republic, which had a separate charter. Thus, Laurel had neither predecessor nor successor, while Osme\u00f1a succeeded Quezon after the latter's death, and was in turn succeeded by Roxas as President of the Third Republic.\n\n==Powers and roles==\n\n===Chief Executive===\nThe president of the Philippines, being the chief executive, serves as both the head of state and head of government of the Philippines. The constitution vests the executive power with the president who consequently heads the government's executive branch, including the Cabinet and all executive departments.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 1</ref>\n\nThe president has power to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures after conviction by final judgment, except in cases of impeachment. The president can grant amnesty with the concurrence of the majority of all the members of the Congress.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 19</ref> The president has authority to contract or guarantee foreign loans on behalf of the Republic but only with the prior concurrence of the Monetary Board and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 20.</ref>\n\nThe president also exercises general supervision over local government units.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 10, sec. 4.</ref>\n\n===Commander-in-Chief===\nThe president also serves as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 18.</ref> This includes the power to suspend the [[writ of habeas corpus]] and to declare [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial law]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Power of appointment===\nWith the consent of the Commission on Appointments, the president also appoints the heads of the executive departments, board of members and its leaders from any national government-related institutions, ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, high-ranking officers of the armed forces, and other officials.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 16.</ref> The members of the Supreme Court and lower courts are also appointed by the president, but only from the list of nominees prepared by the Judicial and Bar Council. Such appointments do not need the approval of the Commission on Appointments.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 8, sec. 9.</ref>\n\n===Government agencies===\n{{main|Office of the President of the Philippines}}\nSome government agencies report to no specific department but are instead under the Office of the President. These include important agencies such as the [[National Security Council (Philippines)|National Security Council]],  Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process, [[Commission on Human Rights (Philippines)|Commission on Human Rights]], [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]], Climate Change Commission, Commission on Population, Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board, [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]], [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board]], Authority of the [[Freeport Area of Bataan]], [[Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority]], and many more.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.pcoo.gov.ph/dir-executiveoffices.htm|title = Agencies/Offices under the Office of the President|date = |accessdate = Jan 6, 2016|website = Presidential Communications Operations Office|publisher = Government of the Philippines|last = |first = }}</ref> The [[Presidential Security Group]], which is composed mostly of members from the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine National Police]], is directly under the Office of the President.\n\n== Election process ==\n\n=== Eligibility ===\nArticle 7, Section 2 of the Constitution reads:\n\"No person may be elected President unless he is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, a registered voter, able to read and write, at least forty years of age on the day of the election, and a resident of the Philippines for at least ten years immediately preceding such election.\" <ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 2</ref>\nThe Constitution also provides term limits where the president is ineligible for reelection and a person who has succeeded as President and has served as such for more than four years will be ineligible to be elected for a second term. However, with the case of [[Joseph Estrada]] who [[1998 Philippine presidential election|was elected president in 1998]], [[2001 EDSA Revolution|deposed in 2001]], and again [[2010 Philippine presidential election|ran for the presidency in 2010]], the Constitution's wording where \"[the] President shall not be eligible for any re-election\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 4</ref> remains unclear as his case was never brought to the Supreme Court. It remains unclear whether the term limit of no re-election applies only to the incumbent president or for any person who has been elected as President.\n\n=== Election ===\n{{Main|Philippine presidential election}}\n[[File:Home provinces of Philippine Presidents.PNG|thumb|Home [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] (blue and purple) of the presidents.]]\nThe president is elected by direct vote every six years, usually on the second Monday of May.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe returns of every election for President and Vice President, duly certified by the board of canvassers of each province or city, shall be transmitted to Congress, directed to the president of the Senate. Upon receipt of the certificates of canvass, the president of the Senate shall open all the certificates in the presence of a joint public session of Congress not later than 30 days after election day. Congress then canvasses the votes upon determining that the polls are authentic and were done in the manner provided by law.\n\nThe person with the highest number of votes is declared the winner, but in case two or more have the highest number of votes, the president is elected by a majority of all members of both Houses, voting separately on each.\n\n===Inauguration===\n{{Main|Philippine presidential inauguration}}\n{{Further|List of Philippine presidential inaugurations}}\n[[File:Carlos P Garcia second inauguration, 1957.jpg|thumb|[[Carlos P. Garcia]] is sworn in as the 8th president of the Philippines after winning the election of 1957]]\n[[File:Rodrigo Duterte oath taking 6.30.16.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rodrigo Duterte]] during his [[Inauguration of Rodrigo Duterte|inauguration]]]]\n\nThe president of the Philippines usually takes the Oath of Office at noon of June 30 following the presidential election\n\nTraditionally, the [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]] takes the oath first, a little before noon. This is for two reasons: first, according to protocol, no one follows the president (who is last due to his supremacy), and second, to establish a constitutionally valid successor before the president-elect accedes. During the [[Manuel L. Quezon|Quezon]] inauguration, however, the vice president and the Legislature were sworn in after the president, to symbolise a new start.\n\nAs soon as the president takes the Oath of Office, a [[21-gun salute]] is fired to salute the new head of state, and the [[honors music|Presidential Anthem]] ''Mabuhay'' is played. The president delivers his inaugural address, and then proceeds to [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]] to climb the Grand Staircase, a ritual which symbolises the formal possession of the Palace. The president then inducts the newly formed cabinet into office in one of the state rooms.\n\nCustom has enshrined three places as the traditional venue for the inauguration ceremony: [[Barasoain Church]] in [[Malolos City]], [[Bulacan]]; in front of the old Legislative Building (now part of the [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]]) in Manila; or at [[Quirino Grandstand]], where most have been held. In 2004, [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] delivered her pre-inaugural address at Quirino Grandstand, took the Oath of Office in [[Cebu City]] before Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide Jr.]], and the next day held the first cabinet meeting in [[Butuan City]]. She broke with precedent, reasoning that she wanted to celebrate her inauguration in each of the three main island groups of the Philippines: [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]]. Her first inauguration also broke precedent as she was sworn in at the [[EDSA Shrine]] on January 20, 2001, during the [[EDSA Revolution of 2001]] that removed [[Joseph Estrada]] from office.\n\nIn the past, elections were held in November and the president's inauguration was held on December 30 ([[Rizal Day]]). This ensured that when the inauguration was usually held at [[Quirino Grandstand]], the new president could see the [[Rizal Monument]] on the anniversary of his death. [[Ferdinand Marcos]] transferred the dates of both the elections and the inauguration to May and June, respectively, and it remains so to this day.\n\nThe dress code at the modern inaugural ceremony is traditional, formal Filipino clothing, which is otherwise loosely termed ''Filipiniana''. Ladies must wear [[terno]], [[baro't saya]] (the formal wear of other indigenous groups is permissible), while men don the [[Barong Tagalog]]. Non-Filipinos at the ceremony may wear their respective versions of formal dress, but foreign diplomats have often been seen donning ''Filipiniana'' as a mark of cultural respect.\n\n===Oath of Office===\nThe Constitution provides the following oath or affirmation for the president and vice president-elect which must be taken before they enter into office:<ref>[http://www.gov.ph/constitutions/1987-constitution/ Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 5]</ref>\n\n{{quotation|\"I, (name), do solemnly swear [or affirm], that I will faithfully and conscientiously fulfill my duties as President [or Vice-President or Acting President] of the Philippines.

The [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]], one of the houses of the bicameral Congress, has the exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment against the president, [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]], members of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], members of the Constitutional Commissions and the [[Philippine Ombudsman|ombudsman]].<ref>Constitution of the Philippines, art. 11, sec. 2</ref> When a third of its membership has endorsed the impeachment articles, it is then transmitted to the [[Senate of the Philippines]] which tries and decide, as impeachment tribunal, the impeachment case.<ref name=\"Article XI\">{{cite web|url= http://www.chanrobles.com/article11.htm|title= The 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines \u2013 Article XI|accessdate= July 25, 2008|author= Chan-Robles Virtual Law Library|date= }}</ref> A main difference from US proceedings however is that only a third of House members are required to approve the motion to impeach the president (as opposed to the majority required in the United States). In the Senate, selected members of the House of Representatives act as the prosecutors and the senators act as judges with the Senate president and chief justice of the Supreme Court jointly presiding over the proceedings. Like the United States, to convict the official in question requires that a minimum of two-thirds (i.e., 16 of 24 members) of the senate vote in favour of conviction. If an impeachment attempt is unsuccessful or the official is acquitted, no new cases can be filed against that impeachable official for at least one full year.\n\n=== Impeachable offenses ===\nThe Constitution enumerates the culpable violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, graft and corruption, other high crimes, and betrayal of public trust as grounds for the impeachment of the president.<ref>Constitution of the Philippines, art. 11, sec. 2.</ref> The same also applies for the vice president, the members of the Supreme Court, the members of the Constitutional Commissions, and the ombudsman.\n\n=== Impeachment attempts and proceedings ===\n\n==== Joseph Ejercito Estrada ====\nJoseph Ejercito Estrada was the first president to undergo impeachment when the House of Representatives voted to raise the impeachment proceedings to the Senate in 2000. However, the trial ended prematurely where anti-Estrada senators walked out of the impeachment sessions when Estrada's allies in the Senate voted narrowly to block the opening of an envelope which allegedly contained critical evidence on Estrada's wealth. Estrada was later ousted from office when the [[Second EDSA Revolution|2001 EDSA Revolution]] forced him out of the presidential palace and when the Supreme Court confirmed that his leaving the palace was his ''de facto'' resignation from office.\n\n==== Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo ====\nSeveral impeachment complaints were filed against Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo but none reached the required endorsement of a third of the House of Representatives.\n\n== Title ==\nThe official title of the Philippine head of state and government is \"President of the Philippines.\"<ref name=\"Const\">{{cite journal|title = 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines|publisher = Chan Robles Virtual Law Library|url = http://www.chanrobles.com/article7.htm|accessdate = January 7, 2008|ref = harv}}</ref> The title in [[Filipino language|Filipino]] is ''Pangulo'' ([[cognate]] of [[Malay language|Malay]] ''penghulu'' \"leader\", \"chieftain\").

After his defeat in the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], Aguinaldo transferred the [[Capital of the Philippines]] to different areas while he struggled in the pursuit of American Forces. When the Americans occupied the Philippines, they also used the Palace as an official residence. During the [[Japanese Occupation of the Philippines]], the governmental offices and the presidential residence transferred to Baguio, and the [[The Mansion, Baguio|Mansion House]] was used as the official residence. Meanwhile, President Quezon of the Philippine Commonwealth resided in the [[Omni Shoreham Hotel]] in Washington D.C.

On occasion, the wing has also been tasked to provide transportation for other members of government, visiting heads of state, and other state guests.\n\nThe fleet includes: 1 [[Fokker F28]], which is primarily used for the president's domestic trips and it is also called \"Kalayaan One\" when the president is on board, 4 [[Bell 412]] helicopters, 3 [[Sikorsky S-76]] helicopters, 1 [[Sikorsky S-70]]-5 Black Hawk, a number of [[Bell UH-1N]] Twin Hueys, as well as [[Fokker F-27]] ''Friendship''s. For trips outside of the Philippines, the Air Force employs a [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] [[Global Express]] or charters appropriate aircraft from the country's flag carrier, [[Philippine Airlines]]. In 1962, the Air Force chartered aircraft from [[Pan American World Airways]] as the international services of Philippine Airlines were suspended. Pan Am later went defunct in 1991. For short-haul flights, PAL used the [[Boeing 737]] until they were replaced by [[Airbus A320]] and [[Airbus A321]] aircraft. For medium to long-haul flights, the airline's [[Boeing 747-400]]'s were used until their retirement in September 2014. The [[Airbus A330-300]], [[Airbus A350-900]] and [[Boeing 777-300ER]] have since fulfilled these roles. Any PAL aircraft with the flight number '''PR/PAL 001''' and callsign '''PHILIPPINE 001''' is a special plane operated by [[Philippine Airlines]] to transport the president of the Philippines. The president sometimes charter private jets for domestic trips within the Philippines due to some airports in the Philippines having small runways.\n\nA Presidential Helicopter Bell 412 crashed on April 7, 2009, in the mountainous [[Ifugao Province]] north of Manila. On board were eight people, including two Cabinet undersecretaries and several servicemen. The flight was ''en route'' to Ifugao from [[Baguio City]] as an advance party of President Macapagal-Arroyo, when the control tower at the now-defunct [[Loakan Airport]] lost communication with the craft several minutes after takeoff.\n\nThe Arroyo administration planned to buy another aircraft worth of about 1.2&nbsp;billion pesos before her term ended in June 2010,<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/169716/Palace-shops-for-P12-B-jet-10-months-before-Arroyo-exit Palace shops for P1.2-B jet 10 months before Arroyo exit \u2013 Nation \u2013 GMANews.TV \u2013 Official Website of GMA News and Public Affairs \u2013 Latest Philippine News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but cancelled the purchase due to other issues.<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/169954/malacaang-cancels-plan-to-purchase-p12-b-jet http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/169954/news/nation/malaca-ang-cancels-plan-to-purchase-p1-2-b-jet], GMA News.</ref>\n\n=== Water transport ===\n{{Main|BRP Ang Pangulo (AT-25)}}\n'''''[[BRP Ang Pangulo (AT-25)|BRP Ang Pangulo]]''''' ('''BRP''' stands for ''Bark\u00f3 ng Rep\u00fablika ng Pilipinas'', \"Ship of the Republic of the Philippines\"; \"''Ang Pangulo''\" is Filipino for \"the president\") was commissioned by the [[Philippine Navy]] on March 7, 1959.

Quezon]] was elected the first president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]], which had been established, still under United States sovereignty, under a [[Constitution of the Philippines#Commonwealth and Third Republic (1935)|constitution]] ratified on 14 May of that year. During its first five years, the president could serve for an unrenewable six-year term. It was later amended in 1940 to limit a president to serving no more than two four-year terms. When President Quezon exiled himself to the United States after the Philippines fell to the [[Empire of Japan]] in [[World War II in the Philippines|World War II]], he appointed [[Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Chief Justice]] [[Jos\u00e9 Abad Santos]] as Acting President and as Acting Commander-in Chief of the Armed Forces. Abad Santos was subsequently executed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] on May 2, 1942.\n\n=== The Second Republic under the Japanese ===\nOn October 14, 1943, [[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]] became President under [[Constitution of the Philippines#Second Republic (1943)|a constitution imposed]] by the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]]. Laurel, an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]], had been instructed to remain in the City of Manila by President Quezon, who withdrew to [[Corregidor]] and then to the United States to establish a [[government in exile]] in the United States. The General Headquarters and Military Camp Base of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] was a military station are moved in the province.\n\nAfter the combined American and Filipino forces liberated the islands in 1945, Laurel officially dissolved the republic on August 17, 1945.\n\n=== After World War II ===\nThe 1935 Constitution was restored after the Japanese surrender ended World War II, with Vice President [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]] becoming President due to Quezon's death on August 1, 1944. It remained in effect after the United States recognized the sovereignty of the Republic of the Philippines as a separate self-governing nation on July 4, 1946.\n\n=== 1973 Constitution ===\nA new [[Constitution of the Philippines#The New Society and the Fourth Republic (1973)|Constitution]] ratified on January 17, 1973 under the rule of [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand E. Marcos]] introduced a parliamentary-style government. Marcos instituted himself as [[Prime Minister of the Philippines|Prime Minister]] while serving as President in 1978. He later appointed [[Cesar Virata|C\u00e9sar Virata]] as Prime Minister in 1981.\n\nThis Constitution was in effect until the [[People Power Revolution]] of 1986 toppled Marcos's 21-year authoritarian regime and replaced him with [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon C. Aquino]].\n\n===Fifth Republic===\nRuling by decree during the early part of her tenure and as a president installed by revolutionary means, President Corazon Aquino issued [[Constitution of the Philippines|Proclamation No. 3]] on March 25, 1986 which abrogated many of the provisions of the then 1973 Constitution, including the provisions associated with the Marcos regime which gave the president legislative powers, as well as the unicameral legislature called the Batasang Pambansa (literally ''National Legislature'' in Filipino). Often called the \"Freedom Constitution,\" the proclamation retained only parts of the 1973 Constitution that were essential for a return to democratic rule, such as the bill of rights. This constitution was superseded on February 2, 1987 by the present constitution.\n\n=== Other issues ===\nBoth Bonifacio and Aguinaldo might be considered to have been an inaugural president of an insurgent government. Quezon was the inaugural president of a predecessor state to the current one, while Aquino, ''m\u00e8re'', was the inaugural president of the currently-constituted government.\n\nThe government considers Aguinaldo to have been the first president of the Philippines, followed by Quezon and his successors.<ref name=tucker2009p8>{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=Spencer C. |title=The encyclopedia of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars: a political, social, and military history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8V3vZxOmHssC|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-951-1|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8V3vZxOmHssC&pg=PA8 8]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=200029&Itemid=26|title=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=February 13, 2015}}</ref> Despite the differences in [[Constitution of the Philippines|constitutions]] and government, the line of presidents is considered to be continuous. For instance, the current president, Rodrigo R. Duterte, is considered to be the 16th president.\n\nWhile the government may consider Aguinaldo as the first president, the First Republic fell under the United States' jurisdiction due to the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|1898 Treaty of Paris]] which ended the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]; the United States thus does not consider his tenure to have been legitimate.<ref name=tucker2009p8 /><ref>[https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/aguinaldo.html Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy], U.S. Library of Congress.</ref> [[Manuel L.

Laurel giving a speech.jpg|thumb|[[Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel]] giving a speech after his inauguration as President of the [[Second Philippine Republic]]]]\nAs with many other [[Axis Powers|Axis]]-occupied countries in the Second World War, the Philippines had at one point two presidents heading two governments. One was Quezon and the Commonwealth [[Government in exile|government-in-exile]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the other was Manila-based Laurel heading the Japanese-sponsored Second Republic. Notably, Laurel was himself instructed to remain in Manila by President Quezon.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Laurel was not formally recognized as a president until the rule of [[Diosdado Macapagal]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=some reliable source reporting that recognition should be easy to find}} His inclusion in the official list coincided with the transfer of the official date of Independence Day from July 4 (the anniversary of the Philippines' independence from the United States) to June 12 (the anniversary of the 1898 Declaration of Independence).\n\nThe inclusion of Laurel thus causes some problems in determining the order of presidents. It is inaccurate to call Laurel the successor of Osme\u00f1a or vice versa, since Laurel's Second Republic was formally repudiated after World War II, its actions not considered legal or binding. Quezon, Osme\u00f1a, and Roxas were seen as being in a contiguous line according to the 1935 Constitution, while Laurel was the only president of the Second Republic, which had a separate charter. Thus, Laurel had neither predecessor nor successor, while Osme\u00f1a succeeded Quezon after the latter's death, and was in turn succeeded by Roxas as President of the Third Republic.\n\n==Powers and roles==\n\n===Chief Executive===\nThe president of the Philippines, being the chief executive, serves as both the head of state and head of government of the Philippines. The constitution vests the executive power with the president who consequently heads the government's executive branch, including the Cabinet and all executive departments.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 1</ref>\n\nThe president has power to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures after conviction by final judgment, except in cases of impeachment. The president can grant amnesty with the concurrence of the majority of all the members of the Congress.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 19</ref> The president has authority to contract or guarantee foreign loans on behalf of the Republic but only with the prior concurrence of the Monetary Board and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 20.</ref>\n\nThe president also exercises general supervision over local government units.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 10, sec. 4.</ref>\n\n===Commander-in-Chief===\nThe president also serves as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 18.</ref> This includes the power to suspend the [[writ of habeas corpus]] and to declare [[Martial law in the Philippines|Martial law]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Power of appointment===\nWith the consent of the Commission on Appointments, the president also appoints the heads of the executive departments, board of members and its leaders from any national government-related institutions, ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, high-ranking officers of the armed forces, and other officials.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 16.</ref> The members of the Supreme Court and lower courts are also appointed by the president, but only from the list of nominees prepared by the Judicial and Bar Council. Such appointments do not need the approval of the Commission on Appointments.<ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 8, sec. 9.</ref>\n\n===Government agencies===\n{{main|Office of the President of the Philippines}}\nSome government agencies report to no specific department but are instead under the Office of the President. These include important agencies such as the [[National Security Council (Philippines)|National Security Council]],  Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process, [[Commission on Human Rights (Philippines)|Commission on Human Rights]], [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]], Climate Change Commission, Commission on Population, Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board, [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]], [[Movie and Television Review and Classification Board]], Authority of the [[Freeport Area of Bataan]], [[Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority]], and many more.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.pcoo.gov.ph/dir-executiveoffices.htm|title = Agencies/Offices under the Office of the President|date = |accessdate = Jan 6, 2016|website = Presidential Communications Operations Office|publisher = Government of the Philippines|last = |first = }}</ref> The [[Presidential Security Group]], which is composed mostly of members from the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine National Police]], is directly under the Office of the President.\n\n== Election process ==\n\n=== Eligibility ===\nArticle 7, Section 2 of the Constitution reads:\n\"No person may be elected President unless he is a natural-born citizen of the Philippines, a registered voter, able to read and write, at least forty years of age on the day of the election, and a resident of the Philippines for at least ten years immediately preceding such election.\" <ref>1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 2</ref>\nThe Constitution also provides term limits where the president is ineligible for reelection and a person who has succeeded as President and has served as such for more than four years will be ineligible to be elected for a second term. However, with the case of [[Joseph Estrada]] who [[1998 Philippine presidential election|was elected president in 1998]], [[2001 EDSA Revolution|deposed in 2001]], and again [[2010 Philippine presidential election|ran for the presidency in 2010]], the Constitution's wording where \"[the] President shall not be eligible for any re-election\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">1987 Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 4</ref> remains unclear as his case was never brought to the Supreme Court. It remains unclear whether the term limit of no re-election applies only to the incumbent president or for any person who has been elected as President.\n\n=== Election ===\n{{Main|Philippine presidential election}}\n[[File:Home provinces of Philippine Presidents.PNG|thumb|Home [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] (blue and purple) of the presidents.]]\nThe president is elected by direct vote every six years, usually on the second Monday of May.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe returns of every election for President and Vice President, duly certified by the board of canvassers of each province or city, shall be transmitted to Congress, directed to the president of the Senate. Upon receipt of the certificates of canvass, the president of the Senate shall open all the certificates in the presence of a joint public session of Congress not later than 30 days after election day. Congress then canvasses the votes upon determining that the polls are authentic and were done in the manner provided by law.\n\nThe person with the highest number of votes is declared the winner, but in case two or more have the highest number of votes, the president is elected by a majority of all members of both Houses, voting separately on each.\n\n===Inauguration===\n{{Main|Philippine presidential inauguration}}\n{{Further|List of Philippine presidential inaugurations}}\n[[File:Carlos P Garcia second inauguration, 1957.jpg|thumb|[[Carlos P. Garcia]] is sworn in as the 8th president of the Philippines after winning the election of 1957]]\n[[File:Rodrigo Duterte oath taking 6.30.16.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rodrigo Duterte]] during his [[Inauguration of Rodrigo Duterte|inauguration]]]]\n\nThe president of the Philippines usually takes the Oath of Office at noon of June 30 following the presidential election\n\nTraditionally, the [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]] takes the oath first, a little before noon. This is for two reasons: first, according to protocol, no one follows the president (who is last due to his supremacy), and second, to establish a constitutionally valid successor before the president-elect accedes. During the [[Manuel L. Quezon|Quezon]] inauguration, however, the vice president and the Legislature were sworn in after the president, to symbolise a new start.\n\nAs soon as the president takes the Oath of Office, a [[21-gun salute]] is fired to salute the new head of state, and the [[honors music|Presidential Anthem]] ''Mabuhay'' is played. The president delivers his inaugural address, and then proceeds to [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]] to climb the Grand Staircase, a ritual which symbolises the formal possession of the Palace. The president then inducts the newly formed cabinet into office in one of the state rooms.\n\nCustom has enshrined three places as the traditional venue for the inauguration ceremony: [[Barasoain Church]] in [[Malolos City]], [[Bulacan]]; in front of the old Legislative Building (now part of the [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]]) in Manila; or at [[Quirino Grandstand]], where most have been held. In 2004, [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] delivered her pre-inaugural address at Quirino Grandstand, took the Oath of Office in [[Cebu City]] before Chief Justice [[Hilario Davide Jr.]], and the next day held the first cabinet meeting in [[Butuan City]]. She broke with precedent, reasoning that she wanted to celebrate her inauguration in each of the three main island groups of the Philippines: [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]]. Her first inauguration also broke precedent as she was sworn in at the [[EDSA Shrine]] on January 20, 2001, during the [[EDSA Revolution of 2001]] that removed [[Joseph Estrada]] from office.\n\nIn the past, elections were held in November and the president's inauguration was held on December 30 ([[Rizal Day]]). This ensured that when the inauguration was usually held at [[Quirino Grandstand]], the new president could see the [[Rizal Monument]] on the anniversary of his death. [[Ferdinand Marcos]] transferred the dates of both the elections and the inauguration to May and June, respectively, and it remains so to this day.\n\nThe dress code at the modern inaugural ceremony is traditional, formal Filipino clothing, which is otherwise loosely termed ''Filipiniana''. Ladies must wear [[terno]], [[baro't saya]] (the formal wear of other indigenous groups is permissible), while men don the [[Barong Tagalog]]. Non-Filipinos at the ceremony may wear their respective versions of formal dress, but foreign diplomats have often been seen donning ''Filipiniana'' as a mark of cultural respect.\n\n===Oath of Office===\nThe Constitution provides the following oath or affirmation for the president and vice president-elect which must be taken before they enter into office:<ref>[http://www.gov.ph/constitutions/1987-constitution/ Constitution of the Philippines, art. 7, sec. 5]</ref>\n\n{{quotation|\"I, (name), do solemnly swear [or affirm], that I will faithfully and conscientiously fulfill my duties as President [or Vice-President or Acting President] of the Philippines.

The [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]], one of the houses of the bicameral Congress, has the exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment against the president, [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]], members of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], members of the Constitutional Commissions and the [[Philippine Ombudsman|ombudsman]].<ref>Constitution of the Philippines, art. 11, sec. 2</ref> When a third of its membership has endorsed the impeachment articles, it is then transmitted to the [[Senate of the Philippines]] which tries and decide, as impeachment tribunal, the impeachment case.<ref name=\"Article XI\">{{cite web|url= http://www.chanrobles.com/article11.htm|title= The 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines \u2013 Article XI|accessdate= July 25, 2008|author= Chan-Robles Virtual Law Library|date= }}</ref> A main difference from US proceedings however is that only a third of House members are required to approve the motion to impeach the president (as opposed to the majority required in the United States). In the Senate, selected members of the House of Representatives act as the prosecutors and the senators act as judges with the Senate president and chief justice of the Supreme Court jointly presiding over the proceedings. Like the United States, to convict the official in question requires that a minimum of two-thirds (i.e., 16 of 24 members) of the senate vote in favour of conviction. If an impeachment attempt is unsuccessful or the official is acquitted, no new cases can be filed against that impeachable official for at least one full year.\n\n=== Impeachable offenses ===\nThe Constitution enumerates the culpable violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, graft and corruption, other high crimes, and betrayal of public trust as grounds for the impeachment of the president.<ref>Constitution of the Philippines, art. 11, sec. 2.</ref> The same also applies for the vice president, the members of the Supreme Court, the members of the Constitutional Commissions, and the ombudsman.\n\n=== Impeachment attempts and proceedings ===\n\n==== Joseph Ejercito Estrada ====\nJoseph Ejercito Estrada was the first president to undergo impeachment when the House of Representatives voted to raise the impeachment proceedings to the Senate in 2000. However, the trial ended prematurely where anti-Estrada senators walked out of the impeachment sessions when Estrada's allies in the Senate voted narrowly to block the opening of an envelope which allegedly contained critical evidence on Estrada's wealth. Estrada was later ousted from office when the [[Second EDSA Revolution|2001 EDSA Revolution]] forced him out of the presidential palace and when the Supreme Court confirmed that his leaving the palace was his ''de facto'' resignation from office.\n\n==== Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo ====\nSeveral impeachment complaints were filed against Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo but none reached the required endorsement of a third of the House of Representatives.\n\n== Title ==\nThe official title of the Philippine head of state and government is \"President of the Philippines.\"<ref name=\"Const\">{{cite journal|title = 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines|publisher = Chan Robles Virtual Law Library|url = http://www.chanrobles.com/article7.htm|accessdate = January 7, 2008|ref = harv}}</ref> The title in [[Filipino language|Filipino]] is ''Pangulo'' ([[cognate]] of [[Malay language|Malay]] ''penghulu'' \"leader\", \"chieftain\").

In 1962, the Air Force chartered aircraft from [[Pan American World Airways]] as the international services of Philippine Airlines were suspended. Pan Am later went defunct in 1991. For short-haul flights, PAL used the [[Boeing 737]] until they were replaced by [[Airbus A320]] and [[Airbus A321]] aircraft. For medium to long-haul flights, the airline's [[Boeing 747-400]]'s were used until their retirement in September 2014. The [[Airbus A330-300]], [[Airbus A350-900]] and [[Boeing 777-300ER]] have since fulfilled these roles. Any PAL aircraft with the flight number '''PR/PAL 001''' and callsign '''PHILIPPINE 001''' is a special plane operated by [[Philippine Airlines]] to transport the president of the Philippines. The president sometimes charter private jets for domestic trips within the Philippines due to some airports in the Philippines having small runways.\n\nA Presidential Helicopter Bell 412 crashed on April 7, 2009, in the mountainous [[Ifugao Province]] north of Manila. On board were eight people, including two Cabinet undersecretaries and several servicemen. The flight was ''en route'' to Ifugao from [[Baguio City]] as an advance party of President Macapagal-Arroyo, when the control tower at the now-defunct [[Loakan Airport]] lost communication with the craft several minutes after takeoff.\n\nThe Arroyo administration planned to buy another aircraft worth of about 1.2&nbsp;billion pesos before her term ended in June 2010,<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/169716/Palace-shops-for-P12-B-jet-10-months-before-Arroyo-exit Palace shops for P1.2-B jet 10 months before Arroyo exit \u2013 Nation \u2013 GMANews.TV \u2013 Official Website of GMA News and Public Affairs \u2013 Latest Philippine News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but cancelled the purchase due to other issues.<ref>[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/169954/malacaang-cancels-plan-to-purchase-p12-b-jet http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/169954/news/nation/malaca-ang-cancels-plan-to-purchase-p1-2-b-jet], GMA News.</ref>\n\n=== Water transport ===\n{{Main|BRP Ang Pangulo (AT-25)}}\n'''''[[BRP Ang Pangulo (AT-25)|BRP Ang Pangulo]]''''' ('''BRP''' stands for ''Bark\u00f3 ng Rep\u00fablika ng Pilipinas'', \"Ship of the Republic of the Philippines\"; \"''Ang Pangulo''\" is Filipino for \"the president\") was commissioned by the [[Philippine Navy]] on March 7, 1959.

During his tenure, the [[Nacionalista Party]] urged him to run for president in 1953. He declined, working instead for the successful election of [[Ramon Magsaysay]], who subsequently appointed Laurel to head a diplomatic mission that was tasked with negotiating trade and other issues with United States officials, resulting in the [[Laurel-Langley Agreement]].
