The population was 33,351 at the 2010 census. It has one of the few harbors along the Orange County coast, and with ready access via [[California State Route 1|State Route 1]], it is a popular local destination for surfing.\n\nThe city was named after the headland of Dana Point, which was in turn named after [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]], author of ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'', which included a description of the area. Dana described the locale, including neighboring [[San Juan Capistrano, California|San Juan Capistrano]], as \"the only romantic spot on the coast\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Dana, Jr.|first=Richard Henry|title=Two Years Before the Mast|year=1912|publisher=D.

The ''Pilgrim'' is used as a classroom by the [[Ocean Institute]], which is located at the harbor. This area is designated [[California Historical Landmark]] #189.<ref name=CHL>{{cite ohp|189|Dana Point|2012-10-11}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Dana Point ca. 1925.jpg|thumb|left|The headlands and pier at Dana Point, ca. 1925, prior to construction of the harbor]]\nDana Point was a popular port for ships involved with the [[California hide trade|hide trade]] with nearby [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]]. Trading reached its peak in the 1830s and 1840s. In 1818, Argentine sailor [[Hippolyte de Bouchard]] anchored there while conducting his raid on the mission. [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.|Richard Henry Dana]] then visited the area in 1835 while serving aboard the sailing brig [[Pilgrim (brig)|''Pilgrim'']] on her voyage along the California coastline.<ref name=CHL/>\n\nIn 1923, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' publisher [[Harry Chandler]] and General M. H. Sherman, director of the [[Pacific Electric Railway Company]], created a major real estate group to develop what is known today as the [[Hollywood Hills]]. [[Sidney H. Woodruff]], already a prominent Los Angeles homebuilder, was hired to lead the project.\n\nIn 1926, Woodruff, Chandler, and Sherman created the Dana Point Syndicate. They invited other investors, company presidents, movie producers, and real estate investors to join them in purchasing {{convert|1388|acre|km2|1}} of land, some of which includes the \"Headlands\" of today. Promising tree-lined and paved streets, electricity, telephones, sidewalks, water mains, storm drains, sewers, and other amenities, Woodruff built 35 homes and a number of commercial buildings.\n\nMost of these \"Woodruff\" houses are concentrated in the Dana Point historic core, also called ''Lantern Village'' (currently about 12,000 residents). The streets are named after different colored lanterns\u2014Street of the Violet Lantern, Blue Lantern, etc.\u2014because colored lanterns were used by ships 200 years ago to advertise their fares when in the Dana Point natural harbor.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.danapointtimes.com/a-legacy-of-lanterns/|title=A Legacy of Lanterns|date=July 25, 2008|work=Dana Point Times|access-date=July 5, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} His crowning structure was to be the Dana Point Inn, a Mediterranean-like resort hotel on the cliffs overlooking the harbor. After a celebratory groundbreaking in 1930, a three-story foundation was poured and a {{convert|135|ft|m|adj=on}} shaft was dug for an elevator to transport hotel guests to and from the beach. The economic downturn of the Great Depression caused construction to halt, however. Although Woodruff continuously sought financial support through the years, this project was abandoned in 1939. Subsequently, he sold the remaining holdings of the Dana Point Syndicate. Thirty-four of the original Woodruff residences are still occupied.\n\n===Surfing===\nRichard Henry Dana (the author of \"Two Years Before the Mast\") considered the high bluffs and sheltered coves of this area of [[Southern California]] to be the most beautiful spot on the California coast. Pioneering [[surfers]] agreed as they surfed the many beach breaks along the [[coast]]. Dana Point had a notable [[Surfing#History|surfing history]], and was home to many of the first companies that produced products for [[surfing]]. [[Hobart Alter|Hobie Alter]] opened the world's first retail [[Surfing|surf]] shop in Dana Point in 1954. Many surf [[publications]] such as the ''Surfer's Journal'' and ''Surfer Magazine'' were formed and headquartered in Dana Point. [[Bruce Brown]] produced the iconic surfer film [[The Endless Summer|''Endless Summer'']] in Dana Point.\n\n\"Killer Dana\" was a legendary [[surf break]] off Dana Point. The surf break was notorious because it came out of deep water and broke close to the rocks that lined the beach. The Killer Dana wave was destroyed when the Dana Point Harbor was built in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.surfline.com/surfaz/surfaz.cfm?id=844|title=A history of Killer Dana}}</ref> A breakwater now cuts right through the heart of the once epic surf spot.

It has one of the few harbors along the Orange County coast, and with ready access via [[California State Route 1|State Route 1]], it is a popular local destination for surfing.\n\nThe city was named after the headland of Dana Point, which was in turn named after [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]], author of ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'', which included a description of the area.

Trading reached its peak in the 1830s and 1840s. In 1818, Argentine sailor [[Hippolyte de Bouchard]] anchored there while conducting his raid on the mission.

Woodruff]], already a prominent Los Angeles homebuilder, was hired to lead the project.\n\nIn 1926, Woodruff, Chandler, and Sherman created the Dana Point Syndicate. They invited other investors, company presidents, movie producers, and real estate investors to join them in purchasing {{convert|1388|acre|km2|1}} of land, some of which includes the \"Headlands\" of today. Promising tree-lined and paved streets, electricity, telephones, sidewalks, water mains, storm drains, sewers, and other amenities, Woodruff built 35 homes and a number of commercial buildings.\n\nMost of these \"Woodruff\" houses are concentrated in the Dana Point historic core, also called ''Lantern Village'' (currently about 12,000 residents). The streets are named after different colored lanterns\u2014Street of the Violet Lantern, Blue Lantern, etc.\u2014because colored lanterns were used by ships 200 years ago to advertise their fares when in the Dana Point natural harbor.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.danapointtimes.com/a-legacy-of-lanterns/|title=A Legacy of Lanterns|date=July 25, 2008|work=Dana Point Times|access-date=July 5, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} His crowning structure was to be the Dana Point Inn, a Mediterranean-like resort hotel on the cliffs overlooking the harbor. After a celebratory groundbreaking in 1930, a three-story foundation was poured and a {{convert|135|ft|m|adj=on}} shaft was dug for an elevator to transport hotel guests to and from the beach. The economic downturn of the Great Depression caused construction to halt, however. Although Woodruff continuously sought financial support through the years, this project was abandoned in 1939. Subsequently, he sold the remaining holdings of the Dana Point Syndicate. Thirty-four of the original Woodruff residences are still occupied.\n\n===Dana Point Harbor===\n[[File:Dana Point Harbor.jpg|thumb|left|View of Dana Point Harbor with the ship ''Spirit of Dana Point'' berthed at the Ocean Institute in the foreground]]\nThe harbor, built in the 1960s and dedicated on July 31, 1971,<ref name=connelly0222>{{cite news|last1=Connelly|first1=Laylan|title=Dana Point Harbor: The Bay That Never Sleeps|work=[[The Orange County Register]]|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/harbor-651993-says-dana.html |date=February 22, 2015|page=News 1, 6\u20137}}</ref> is home to a marina, shops, and restaurants, and is a point of departure for the [[Catalina Express]], a transportation service to and from the City of Avalon on Catalina Island.

The Strands parcel included the actual headlands and bluff of Dana Point as well and was one of the last large coast properties available for development along the Orange County Coast.  During the course of a ten-year approval process, the original high-density plan, which included a large multi-story hotel on the bluff top and hundreds of houses and multi-family units, was reduced in scope to just over 100 home sites.  As part of negotiations with the California Coastal Commission, the developer agreed to turn the bluff into a nature preserve and build over $11 million worth of public improvements to provide easier access to the Strands Beach.  The improvements include stairs, restrooms, a beach-front sidewalk and a [http://www.ocregister.com/articles/city-701516-funicular-car.html funicular] to transport visitors from the parking lot to the beach.  After extensive infrastructure construction, lots were offered for sale in the fall of 2006.

Strands Homeowners, through a Mello-Roos assessment, pay for the upkeep of the beach improvements.\n\n===Capistrano Beach===\n[[File:Doheny Beach surfers.jpg|thumb|left|Surfers during the summer at Doheny State Beach]]\nIn 1928, a corporate entity of the American industrial giant [[Edward Doheny]], who had built his fortune in oil production in [[Southern California]] and Mexico, purchased a number of lots in [[Capistrano Beach]]. Doheny's son, Ned, formed a development company, the Capistrano Beach Company, which included his wife's twin brothers, Clark and Warren Smith, and Luther Eldridge, a contractor, to build a community of Spanish style houses. According to Dana Point historians Baum and Burnes,* Eldridge favored two dominant characteristics in his homes, a typically Spanish roofline and the use of large ceiling beams in the main rooms of the houses. The roofline, covered with red ceramic tiles, incorporated a low-pitched gable, spreading out to one short and one long roof. The ceiling beams were decorated with stenciled artwork painted by artist Alex Meston. Eldridge was able to complete the original Doheny family house on the bluffs, four houses on the beach, and 18 other homes scattered throughout the area before tragedy struck the ambitious project. Edward Doheny was preparing for his criminal trial for bribery in the [[Teapot Dome Scandal]], and on February 16, 1929, Ned Doheny and Hugh Plunkett, his friend and secretary, who were to testify in the trial, were killed in a murder that still remains unsolved. In 1931, as a memorial to Ned, Petroleum Securities Company, Doheny's family-owned business, made a gift of {{convert|41.4|acre|m2}} to the State of California, which is now [[Doheny State Beach]]. The unimproved Capistrano Beach properties passed back to Edward Doheny, and, upon his death in 1935, to his wife and heirs. By 1944, all of the properties had been sold to private parties.\n\nThe Doheny family also funded the building of what was then called St. Edward's Chapel in Capistrano Beach. The chapel soon grew, received canonical status as a parish, and moved to its current bluff-top location in Dana Point, overlooking Doheny State Beach.\n\n===Surfing===\nRichard Henry Dana (the author of \"Two Years Before the Mast\") considered the high bluffs and sheltered coves of this area of [[Southern California]] to be the most beautiful spot on the California coast.

[[Bruce Brown]] produced the iconic surfer film [[The Endless Summer|''Endless Summer'']] in Dana Point.\n\n\"Killer Dana\" was a legendary [[surf break]] off Dana Point. The surf break was notorious because it came out of deep water and broke close to the rocks that lined the beach.

Capable of [[V/STOL|vertical or short takeoff and landing]] (V/STOL), the aircraft was designed in the late 1970s as an Anglo-American development of the British [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]], the first operational V/STOL aircraft. The aircraft is primarily employed on light attack or multi-role missions, ranging from [[close air support]] of ground troops to armed [[Reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]]. The AV-8B is used by the [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC), the [[Spanish Navy]], and the [[Italian Navy]]. A variant of the AV-8B, the [[British Aerospace Harrier II]], was developed for the British military, while another, the TAV-8B, is a dedicated two-seat [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]].\n\nThe project that eventually led to the AV-8B's creation started in the early 1970s as a cooperative effort between the United States and United Kingdom (UK), aimed at addressing the operational inadequacies of the first-generation Harrier. Early efforts centered on a larger, more powerful [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus|Pegasus engine]] to dramatically improve the capabilities of the Harrier. Due to budgetary constraints, the UK abandoned the project in 1975.\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of the UK, [[McDonnell Douglas]] extensively redesigned the earlier AV-8A Harrier to create the AV-8B. While retaining the general layout of its predecessor, the aircraft incorporates a new wing with one additional [[hardpoint]] each, an elevated cockpit, a redesigned fuselage and other structural and [[aerodynamic]] refinements. The aircraft is powered by an upgraded version of the Pegasus, which gives the aircraft its V/STOL ability. The AV-8B made its [[maiden flight]] in November 1981 and entered service with the USMC in January 1985. Later upgrades added a night-attack capability and radar, resulting in the AV-8B(NA) and AV-8B Harrier II Plus, respectively. An enlarged version named Harrier III was also studied, but not pursued. The UK, through [[British Aerospace]], re-joined the improved Harrier project as a partner in 1981, giving it a significant work-share in the project. Since corporate mergers in the 1990s, [[Boeing]] and [[BAE Systems]] have jointly supported the program. Approximately 340 aircraft were produced in a 22-year production program that ended in 2003.\n\nTypically operated from small [[aircraft carrier]]s, large [[amphibious assault ship]]s and simple [[forward operating base]]s, AV-8Bs have participated in numerous military and [[Humanitarian intervention|humanitarian operations]], proving themselves versatile assets. [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] General [[Norman Schwarzkopf]] named the USMC Harrier II as one of several important weapons in the [[Gulf War]]. It has also served in [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] in Afghanistan since 2001, the [[Iraq War]] since 2003, and was used in [[Operation Odyssey Dawn]] in Libya in 2011. Italian and Spanish Harrier IIs have taken part in overseas conflicts in conjunction with NATO coalitions. During its service history, the AV-8B has had a high accident rate, related to the percentage of time spent in critical take-off and landing phases. USMC and Italian Navy AV-8Bs are to be replaced by the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|Lockheed Martin F-35B]], with the former expected to operate its Harriers until 2025.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|first-generation Harriers]] entered service with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC), but were handicapped in range and [[payload]]. In [[STOL|short takeoff and landing]] configuration, the AV-8A (American designation for the Harrier) carried less than half the 4,000&nbsp;lb (1,800&nbsp;kg) payload of the smaller [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4 Skyhawk]], over a more limited radius.<ref>Donald and March 2004, p.&nbsp;55.</ref> To address this issue, Hawker Siddeley and McDonnell Douglas began joint development of a more capable version of the Harrier in 1973. Early efforts concentrated on an improved [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus|Pegasus engine]], designated the Pegasus 15, which was being tested by [[Bristol Siddeley]].<ref name=Wilson_p26>Wilson 2000, p.&nbsp;26.</ref> Although more powerful, the engine's diameter was too large by {{Convert|2.75|in|mm|sigfig=2|sp=us|abbr=on}} to fit into the Harrier easily.<ref name=Jenkins_p69-0>Jenkins 1998, pp.&nbsp;69\u201370.</ref>\n\nIn December 1973, a joint American and British team completed a project document defining an Advanced Harrier powered by the Pegasus 15 engine. The Advanced Harrier was intended to replace the original RAF and USMC Harriers, as well as the USMC's A-4.<ref name=Jenkins_p69-0/><ref name=Nordeen_p41>Nordeen 2006, p.&nbsp;41.</ref> The aim of the Advanced Harrier was to double the AV-8's payload and range, and was therefore unofficially named AV-16. The British government pulled out of the project in March 1975 owing to decreased defense funding, rising costs, and the  RAF's insufficient 60-aircraft requirement.<ref name=Wilson_p26/><ref name=Nordeen_p41/><ref>Eden 2004, p.&nbsp;288.</ref> With development costs estimated to be around [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]180\u2013200&nbsp;million (1974 British pounds),<ref>''Flight International'' 1974, p.&nbsp;762.</ref> the United States was unwilling to fund development by itself, and ended the project later that year.<ref>Jackson 1987, p.&nbsp;138.</ref>\n\nDespite the project's termination, the two companies continued to take different paths toward an enhanced Harrier. Hawker Siddeley focused on a new larger wing that could be retrofitted to existing operational aircraft, while McDonnell Douglas independently pursued a less ambitious, though still expensive, project catering to the needs of the US military. Using knowledge gleaned from the AV-16 effort, though dropping some items\u2014such as the larger Pegasus engine\u2014McDonnell Douglas kept the basic structure and engine for an aircraft tailored for the USMC.<ref name=Wilson_p26/><ref>Jenkins 1998, pp.&nbsp;70\u201372.</ref>\n\n===Designing and testing===\nAs the USMC wanted a substantially improved Harrier without the development of a new engine, the plan for Harrier II development was authorized by the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) in 1976.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Nordeen 2006, pp.&nbsp;42\u201344, 48\u201349.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/130/125395.pdf|title=Is The AV-8B Advanced Harrier Aircraft Ready For Full-Scale Development?|date=30 January 1979|work=General Accounting Office|publisher=General Accounting Office|location=Washington, D.C.|page=1|oclc=4711266|access-date=24 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211052027/http://www.gao.gov/assets/130/125395.pdf|archive-date=11 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The United States Navy (USN), which had traditionally procured military aircraft for the USMC, insisted that the new design be verified with flight testing.<ref>Nordeen 2006, pp.&nbsp;41\u201343.</ref> McDonnell Douglas modified two AV-8As with new wings, revised intakes, redesigned exhaust nozzles, and other aerodynamic changes; the modified forward fuselage and cockpit found on all subsequent aircraft were not incorporated on these prototypes.<ref>Jenkins 1998, pp.&nbsp;69\u201370, 72\u201373.</ref><ref name=Wilson_p28>Wilson 2000, p.&nbsp;28.</ref> Designated YAV-8B, the first converted aircraft flew on 9 November 1978, at the hands of Charles Plummer.

There had previously been conflict between the USMC and USN over budgetary issues. At the time, the USN wanted to procure A-18s for its ground attack force and, to cut costs, pressured the USMC to adopt the similarly-designed F-18 fighter instead of the AV-8B to fulfill the role of close air support (both designs were eventually amalgamated to create the multirole [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18 Hornet]]).<ref>Nordeen 2006, p.&nbsp;46.</ref> Despite these bureaucratic obstacles, in 1981, the DoD included the Harrier II in its annual budget and five-year defense plan.

In the operational evaluation (OPEVAL), lasting from 31 August 1984 to 30 March 1985, four pilots and a group of maintenance and support personnel tested the aircraft under combat conditions. The aircraft was graded for its ability to meet its mission requirements for navigating, acquiring targets, delivering weapons, and evading and surviving enemy actions, all at the specified range and payload limits. The first phase of OPEVAL, running until 1 February 1985, required the AV-8B to fly both [[deep air support|deep]] and [[close air support]] missions (deep air support missions do not require coordination with friendly ground forces) in concert with other close-support aircraft, as well as flying [[Air interdiction|battlefield interdiction]] and armed reconnaissance missions. The aircraft flew from military installations at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton]] and [[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake]] in California, [[Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake]] in Canada, and [[MCAS Yuma]] in Arizona.<ref name=Nordeen_p57-9>Nordeen 2006, pp.&nbsp;57\u201359.</ref>\n\nThe second phase of OPEVAL, which took place at MCAS Yuma from 25 February to 8 March, required the AV-8B to perform fighter escort, [[combat air patrol]], and deck-launched intercept missions. Although the evaluation identified shortfalls in the design (subsequently rectified), OPEVAL was deemed successful.<ref name=Nordeen_p58>Nordeen 2006, p 58.</ref> The AV-8B Harrier II reached [[initial operating capability]] (IOC) in January 1985 with USMC squadron [[VMA-331]].<ref>Polmar 2005, p.&nbsp;400.</ref><ref>Grossnick 1997, p.&nbsp;343.</ref>{{#tag:ref|According to Lon Nordeen, USMC squadron VMA-331 was reassigned to the AV-8B in January 1985 and achieved IOC in August 1985.<ref name=\"Nordeen_p61\"/>|group=\"N\"}}\n\n[[File:2012 MCAS Miramar AirShow 121013-M-GC438-375.jpg|thumb|An AV-8B hovering during the 2012 [[Miramar Air Show]]|alt=Front-view of gray jet aircraft executing a hover.

Twelve Harriers were split evenly between the [[24th Marine Expeditionary Unit|24th]] and [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit]]s (MEU). AV-8Bs of the 24th MEU were introduced into combat on 14 April, and over the next 14 days flew 34 combat air support missions over Kosovo.

Capable of [[V/STOL|vertical or short takeoff and landing]] (V/STOL), the aircraft was designed in the late 1970s as an Anglo-American development of the British [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]], the first operational V/STOL aircraft. The aircraft is primarily employed on light attack or multi-role missions, ranging from [[close air support]] of ground troops to armed [[Reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]]. The AV-8B is used by the [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC), the [[Spanish Navy]], and the [[Italian Navy]]. A variant of the AV-8B, the [[British Aerospace Harrier II]], was developed for the British military, while another, the TAV-8B, is a dedicated two-seat [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]].\n\nThe project that eventually led to the AV-8B's creation started in the early 1970s as a cooperative effort between the United States and United Kingdom (UK), aimed at addressing the operational inadequacies of the first-generation Harrier. Early efforts centered on a larger, more powerful [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus|Pegasus engine]] to dramatically improve the capabilities of the Harrier. Due to budgetary constraints, the UK abandoned the project in 1975.\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of the UK, [[McDonnell Douglas]] extensively redesigned the earlier AV-8A Harrier to create the AV-8B. While retaining the general layout of its predecessor, the aircraft incorporates a new wing with one additional [[hardpoint]] each, an elevated cockpit, a redesigned fuselage and other structural and [[aerodynamic]] refinements. The aircraft is powered by an upgraded version of the Pegasus, which gives the aircraft its V/STOL ability. The AV-8B made its [[maiden flight]] in November 1981 and entered service with the USMC in January 1985. Later upgrades added a night-attack capability and radar, resulting in the AV-8B(NA) and AV-8B Harrier II Plus, respectively. An enlarged version named Harrier III was also studied, but not pursued. The UK, through [[British Aerospace]], re-joined the improved Harrier project as a partner in 1981, giving it a significant work-share in the project. Since corporate mergers in the 1990s, [[Boeing]] and [[BAE Systems]] have jointly supported the program. Approximately 340 aircraft were produced in a 22-year production program that ended in 2003.\n\nTypically operated from small [[aircraft carrier]]s, large [[amphibious assault ship]]s and simple [[forward operating base]]s, AV-8Bs have participated in numerous military and [[Humanitarian intervention|humanitarian operations]], proving themselves versatile assets. [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] General [[Norman Schwarzkopf]] named the USMC Harrier II as one of several important weapons in the [[Gulf War]]. It has also served in [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] in Afghanistan since 2001, the [[Iraq War]] since 2003, and was used in [[Operation Odyssey Dawn]] in Libya in 2011. Italian and Spanish Harrier IIs have taken part in overseas conflicts in conjunction with NATO coalitions. During its service history, the AV-8B has had a high accident rate, related to the percentage of time spent in critical take-off and landing phases. USMC and Italian Navy AV-8Bs are to be replaced by the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|Lockheed Martin F-35B]], with the former expected to operate its Harriers until 2025.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|first-generation Harriers]] entered service with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC), but were handicapped in range and [[payload]]. In [[STOL|short takeoff and landing]] configuration, the AV-8A (American designation for the Harrier) carried less than half the 4,000&nbsp;lb (1,800&nbsp;kg) payload of the smaller [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4 Skyhawk]], over a more limited radius.<ref>Donald and March 2004, p.&nbsp;55.</ref> To address this issue, Hawker Siddeley and McDonnell Douglas began joint development of a more capable version of the Harrier in 1973. Early efforts concentrated on an improved [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus|Pegasus engine]], designated the Pegasus 15, which was being tested by [[Bristol Siddeley]].<ref name=Wilson_p26>Wilson 2000, p.&nbsp;26.</ref> Although more powerful, the engine's diameter was too large by {{Convert|2.75|in|mm|sigfig=2|sp=us|abbr=on}} to fit into the Harrier easily.<ref name=Jenkins_p69-0>Jenkins 1998, pp.&nbsp;69\u201370.</ref>\n\nIn December 1973, a joint American and British team completed a project document defining an Advanced Harrier powered by the Pegasus 15 engine. The Advanced Harrier was intended to replace the original RAF and USMC Harriers, as well as the USMC's A-4.<ref name=Jenkins_p69-0/><ref name=Nordeen_p41>Nordeen 2006, p.&nbsp;41.</ref> The aim of the Advanced Harrier was to double the AV-8's payload and range, and was therefore unofficially named AV-16. The British government pulled out of the project in March 1975 owing to decreased defense funding, rising costs, and the  RAF's insufficient 60-aircraft requirement.<ref name=Wilson_p26/><ref name=Nordeen_p41/><ref>Eden 2004, p.&nbsp;288.</ref> With development costs estimated to be around [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]180\u2013200&nbsp;million (1974 British pounds),<ref>''Flight International'' 1974, p.&nbsp;762.</ref> the United States was unwilling to fund development by itself, and ended the project later that year.<ref>Jackson 1987, p.&nbsp;138.</ref>\n\nDespite the project's termination, the two companies continued to take different paths toward an enhanced Harrier. Hawker Siddeley focused on a new larger wing that could be retrofitted to existing operational aircraft, while McDonnell Douglas independently pursued a less ambitious, though still expensive, project catering to the needs of the US military. Using knowledge gleaned from the AV-16 effort, though dropping some items\u2014such as the larger Pegasus engine\u2014McDonnell Douglas kept the basic structure and engine for an aircraft tailored for the USMC.<ref name=Wilson_p26/><ref>Jenkins 1998, pp.&nbsp;70\u201372.</ref>\n\n===Designing and testing===\nAs the USMC wanted a substantially improved Harrier without the development of a new engine, the plan for Harrier II development was authorized by the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) in 1976.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Nordeen 2006, pp.&nbsp;42\u201344, 48\u201349.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/130/125395.pdf|title=Is The AV-8B Advanced Harrier Aircraft Ready For Full-Scale Development?|date=30 January 1979|work=General Accounting Office|publisher=General Accounting Office|location=Washington, D.C.|page=1|oclc=4711266|access-date=24 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211052027/http://www.gao.gov/assets/130/125395.pdf|archive-date=11 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The United States Navy (USN), which had traditionally procured military aircraft for the USMC, insisted that the new design be verified with flight testing.<ref>Nordeen 2006, pp.&nbsp;41\u201343.</ref> McDonnell Douglas modified two AV-8As with new wings, revised intakes, redesigned exhaust nozzles, and other aerodynamic changes; the modified forward fuselage and cockpit found on all subsequent aircraft were not incorporated on these prototypes.<ref>Jenkins 1998, pp.&nbsp;69\u201370, 72\u201373.</ref><ref name=Wilson_p28>Wilson 2000, p.&nbsp;28.</ref> Designated YAV-8B, the first converted aircraft flew on 9 November 1978, at the hands of Charles Plummer.

There had previously been conflict between the USMC and USN over budgetary issues.

In the operational evaluation (OPEVAL), lasting from 31 August 1984 to 30 March 1985, four pilots and a group of maintenance and support personnel tested the aircraft under combat conditions. The aircraft was graded for its ability to meet its mission requirements for navigating, acquiring targets, delivering weapons, and evading and surviving enemy actions, all at the specified range and payload limits. The first phase of OPEVAL, running until 1 February 1985, required the AV-8B to fly both [[deep air support|deep]] and [[close air support]] missions (deep air support missions do not require coordination with friendly ground forces) in concert with other close-support aircraft, as well as flying [[Air interdiction|battlefield interdiction]] and armed reconnaissance missions. The aircraft flew from military installations at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton]] and [[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake]] in California, [[Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake]] in Canada, and [[MCAS Yuma]] in Arizona.<ref name=Nordeen_p57-9>Nordeen 2006, pp.&nbsp;57\u201359.</ref>\n\nThe second phase of OPEVAL, which took place at MCAS Yuma from 25 February to 8 March, required the AV-8B to perform fighter escort, [[combat air patrol]], and deck-launched intercept missions. Although the evaluation identified shortfalls in the design (subsequently rectified), OPEVAL was deemed successful.<ref name=Nordeen_p58>Nordeen 2006, p 58.</ref> The AV-8B Harrier II reached [[initial operating capability]] (IOC) in January 1985 with USMC squadron [[VMA-331]].<ref>Polmar 2005, p.&nbsp;400.</ref><ref>Grossnick 1997, p.&nbsp;343.</ref>{{#tag:ref|According to Lon Nordeen, USMC squadron VMA-331 was reassigned to the AV-8B in January 1985 and achieved IOC in August 1985.<ref name=\"Nordeen_p61\"/>|group=\"N\"}}\n\n[[File:2012 MCAS Miramar AirShow 121013-M-GC438-375.jpg|thumb|An AV-8B hovering during the 2012 [[Miramar Air Show]]|alt=Front-view of gray jet aircraft executing a hover.

Twelve Harriers were split evenly between the [[24th Marine Expeditionary Unit|24th]] and [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit]]s (MEU). AV-8Bs of the 24th MEU were introduced into combat on 14 April, and over the next 14 days flew 34 combat air support missions over Kosovo.
