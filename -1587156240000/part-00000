This is described as both extremely painful and not conducive to enlightenment.<ref>[[Johannes Bronkhorst]], ''The Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient India.'' Franz Steiner Verlag Weisbaden GmbH, pp. 1\u20135.</ref>  In some Buddhist teachings or metaphors, breathing is said to stop with the fourth [[jhana]], though this is a side-effect of the technique and does not come about as the result of purposeful effort.<ref>[[Johannes Bronkhorst]], ''The Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient India.'' Franz Steiner Verlag Weisbaden GmbH, p. 84.</ref>\n\nThe Buddha did incorporate moderate modulation of the length of breath as part of the preliminary tetrad in the [[Anapanasati Sutta]]. Its use there is preparation for concentration. According to commentarial literature, this is appropriate for beginners.<ref>Edward Conze, ''Buddhist Meditation.'' Harper & Row, 1956, p. 66.

This group held a majority over the bloc of [[Russell Hantz]], [[Parvati Shallow]], and Danielle DiLorenzo. When both the Heroes and Villains tribes had to vote someone out consecutively, Mariano directed his alliance to split their votes due to Hantz's possession of a hidden immunity idol. Hantz manipulated Apostol into disobeying Mariano's plan, and instead of forcing a tie, Apostol switched his vote to Shallow. After Hantz gave Shallow the hidden immunity idol and she played it, Apostol was eliminated by a vote of 3\u20132, with Hantz's idol negating four votes against Shallow.\n\nHad Apostol stuck to Mariano's plan, he and Hantz would have tied 3\u20133, and Hantz would presumably have been eliminated on the revote. Thus Apostol was the sixth survivor and the second Villain to be voted out of the season. His switching votes has been called \"one of the dumbest moves in Survivor history.\" His vote switch caused huge ramifications on the game as Hantz would make it all the way to the Final Tribal Council.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ross |first=Dalton |url=https://ew.com/article/2010/03/25/survivor-heroes-vs-villians-tyson-apostol-dumbest-move-ever/ |title='Survivor: Heroes vs {{sic|Villians|nolink=y}}': Ousted Villain calls his vote flip the dumbest move in 'Survivor' history |website=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 25, 2010|accessdate=February 23, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Andy|last=Dehnart |url=https://www.today.com/popculture/survivor-stupidly-votes-himself-out-game-wbna36028276|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428031142/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/36028276/ns/entertainment-reality_tv/ |archive-date=April 28, 2010 |title=\u2018Survivor\u2019 stupidly votes himself out of the game|publisher=Today |date=March 24, 2010 |accessdate=February 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===''Blood vs. Water''===\nApostol returned for ''Survivor''{{'}}s 27th season, ''[[Survivor: Blood vs. Water|Blood vs. Water]]''.

Foulger was the fourth person eliminated from the game after being the second contestant to be voted out in a Tribal Council. \n\nLater on, a tribe switch put Apostol on a tribe with fellow former Galang members [[Gervase Peterson]] and [[Aras Baskauskas]], as well as former Tadhana members [[Hayden Moss]], Ciera Eastin, and Caleb Bankston. Using the clues to the hidden immunity idol's location, given to him verbally by Moss and Bankston, Apostol found the first idol by himself and kept it a secret. He also formed an alliance with Peterson, Moss, Eastin, and Bankston. At the merge, this alliance joined with Monica Culpepper and Eastin's mother, [[Laura Morett]], to take out Baskauskas and his brother, Vytas, as well as [[Tina Wesson]]. From here, Apostol began looking further past this alliance of seven, orchestrating Morett's return to Redemption Island and voting out Bankston, who was conspiring to blindside him. In this Tribal Council, Apostol used his idol, even though no votes were cast against him and Bankston still received the majority of votes.\n\nWith the sudden revelation that he had had the idol all along, Apostol began facing rebellion within his alliance from Moss and Eastin, who continuously appealed to Culpepper to switch her vote and go with them to vote against Apostol and Peterson. However, Apostol maintained control of Peterson and Culpepper, and even found the idol a second time, utilizing the clue that Eastin was given. Apostol later won the final two immunity challenges, thus guaranteeing himself a spot in the final three.\n\nHe then decided to vote out former Survivor winner Wesson, who had just returned from Redemption Island, recognizing she was his only remaining threat for jury votes. Thus he went to the finals alongside the less-liked Peterson and Culpepper, who were both widely viewed by the jury as riding Apostol's coattails, letting him make all the decisions, and doing little to play their own games, with Culpepper especially being criticized for failing to make a big blindside move against Apostol and Peterson despite numerous opportunities to do so.  Culpepper was also razzed for her lack of social bonds with any of the other players outside of her alliance, and she broke down crying during Final Tribal Council. Though Apostol was responsible for most of the jury members' eliminations, his method of playing the game was praised, and he was voted the $1 million winner, receiving seven of the eight jury votes (with Culpepper receiving the dissenting vote, from Vytas Baskauskas).\n\n===''Winners at War''===\nTyson once again came back for the show's 40th season, ''[[Survivor: Winners at War|Winners at War]]''.

Tyson rejoined the game at the merge after winning the return challenge against the other Edge of Extinction contestants. However, he was voted off again on Day 25 and returned to the Edge of Extinction.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nApostol proposed to his girlfriend of six and half years, Rachel Foulger, during the finale of [[Marriage_Boot_Camp#Season_4_-_Marriage_Boot_Camp:_Reality_Stars_2|''Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars 2'']].

Early on, Apostol wanted to blindside fellow contestant Erinn Lobdell; however, he eventually sided with the majority and voted out the ill Jerry Sims. At the merge, Apostol won the first individual immunity by outlasting former tribemate Debbie Beebe. He went on to win immunity again with nine contestants left as well. Wade and Apostol aligned with [[Stephen Fishbach]], [[J. T. Thomas (Survivor contestant)|James \"J.T.\" Thomas, Jr.]], and Beebe, blindsiding Brendan Synnott with the cooperation of Lobdell and [[Tamara Johnson-George|Tamara \"Taj\" Johnson-George]]. Sierra Reed became the target, but Thomas, Lobdell, and Fishbach joined the other group, deciding that Apostol was a bigger threat than Reed; Apostol was voted out and became the second juror. He eventually voted for Thomas to win the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/tyson-apostol-ninth-castaway-eliminated-from-survivor-tocantins-8879.php |title=Tyson Apostol the ninth castaway eliminated from 'Survivor: Tocantins'|publisher=Reality TV World |date=April 24, 2009 |accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Jeff Probst]] stated that Apostol was one of his favorites of the season because he was maniacal and unpredictable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.survivorfever.net/s18_tyson_apostol.html |title=Survivor: Tocantins - Tyson Apostol |publisher=Survivorfever.net |date= |accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===''Heroes vs. Villains''===\nApostol accepted an offer to participate again, in the show's [[Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains|20th season]], where he was assigned to the Villains tribe. His tribe dominated the initial immunity challenges. He formed an alliance with [[Jerri Manthey]] and fellow ''Tocantins'' participant [[Benjamin \"Coach\" Wade]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Goldman, Eric |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/04/22/survivor-heroes-vs-villains-courtney-strikes-back |title=Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains - Courtney Strikes Back|publisher=IGN |date=April 21, 2010 |accessdate=February 27, 2014}}</ref> Apostol appeared to be safe after joining the alliance of [[Rob Mariano|\"Boston Rob\" Mariano]], [[Sandra Diaz-Twine]], and Courtney Yates, along with Wade and Manthey. This group held a majority over the bloc of [[Russell Hantz]], [[Parvati Shallow]], and Danielle DiLorenzo. When both the Heroes and Villains tribes had to vote someone out consecutively, Mariano directed his alliance to split their votes due to Hantz's possession of a hidden immunity idol. Hantz manipulated Apostol into disobeying Mariano's plan, and instead of forcing a tie, Apostol switched his vote to Shallow. After Hantz gave Shallow the hidden immunity idol and she played it, Apostol was eliminated by a vote of 3\u20132, with Hantz's idol negating four votes against Shallow.\n\nHad Apostol stuck to Mariano's plan, he and Hantz would have tied 3\u20133, and Hantz would presumably have been eliminated on the revote. Thus Apostol was the sixth survivor and the second Villain to be voted out of the season. His switching votes has been called \"one of the dumbest moves in Survivor history.\" His vote switch caused huge ramifications on the game as Hantz would make it all the way to the Final Tribal Council.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ross |first=Dalton |url=https://ew.com/article/2010/03/25/survivor-heroes-vs-villians-tyson-apostol-dumbest-move-ever/ |title='Survivor: Heroes vs {{sic|Villians|nolink=y}}': Ousted Villain calls his vote flip the dumbest move in 'Survivor' history |website=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 25, 2010|accessdate=February 23, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Andy|last=Dehnart |url=https://www.today.com/popculture/survivor-stupidly-votes-himself-out-game-wbna36028276|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428031142/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/36028276/ns/entertainment-reality_tv/ |archive-date=April 28, 2010 |title=\u2018Survivor\u2019 stupidly votes himself out of the game|publisher=Today |date=March 24, 2010 |accessdate=February 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===''Blood vs. Water''===\nApostol returned for ''Survivor''{{'}}s 27th season, ''[[Survivor: Blood vs. Water|Blood vs. Water]]''. This time, he and his longtime girlfriend, Rachel Foulger, were both cast as contestants.<ref>[https://ew.com/article/2013/08/21/survivor-blood-vs-water-new-cast-and-lots-of-twists-revealed/ 'Survivor: Blood vs. Water': New cast and (lots of) twists revealed!] Entertainment Weekly, Retrieved February 23, 2020</ref> He was assigned to the Galang tribe, while she went to Tadhana. Foulger was the fourth person eliminated from the game after being the second contestant to be voted out in a Tribal Council. \n\nLater on, a tribe switch put Apostol on a tribe with fellow former Galang members [[Gervase Peterson]] and [[Aras Baskauskas]], as well as former Tadhana members [[Hayden Moss]], Ciera Eastin, and Caleb Bankston. Using the clues to the hidden immunity idol's location, given to him verbally by Moss and Bankston, Apostol found the first idol by himself and kept it a secret. He also formed an alliance with Peterson, Moss, Eastin, and Bankston. At the merge, this alliance joined with Monica Culpepper and Eastin's mother, [[Laura Morett]], to take out Baskauskas and his brother, Vytas, as well as [[Tina Wesson]]. From here, Apostol began looking further past this alliance of seven, orchestrating Morett's return to Redemption Island and voting out Bankston, who was conspiring to blindside him. In this Tribal Council, Apostol used his idol, even though no votes were cast against him and Bankston still received the majority of votes.\n\nWith the sudden revelation that he had had the idol all along, Apostol began facing rebellion within his alliance from Moss and Eastin, who continuously appealed to Culpepper to switch her vote and go with them to vote against Apostol and Peterson. However, Apostol maintained control of Peterson and Culpepper, and even found the idol a second time, utilizing the clue that Eastin was given. Apostol later won the final two immunity challenges, thus guaranteeing himself a spot in the final three.\n\nHe then decided to vote out former Survivor winner Wesson, who had just returned from Redemption Island, recognizing she was his only remaining threat for jury votes. Thus he went to the finals alongside the less-liked Peterson and Culpepper, who were both widely viewed by the jury as riding Apostol's coattails, letting him make all the decisions, and doing little to play their own games, with Culpepper especially being criticized for failing to make a big blindside move against Apostol and Peterson despite numerous opportunities to do so.  Culpepper was also razzed for her lack of social bonds with any of the other players outside of her alliance, and she broke down crying during Final Tribal Council. Though Apostol was responsible for most of the jury members' eliminations, his method of playing the game was praised, and he was voted the $1 million winner, receiving seven of the eight jury votes (with Culpepper receiving the dissenting vote, from Vytas Baskauskas).\n\n===''Winners at War''===\nTyson once again came back for the show's 40th season, ''[[Survivor: Winners at War|Winners at War]]''. He was a member of the Dakal tribe. After they lost the fifth immunity challenge, Tyson became the fifth person voted off and went to the Edge of Extinction. Tyson rejoined the game at the merge after winning the return challenge against the other Edge of Extinction contestants. However, he was voted off again on day 25 and returned to the Edge of Extinction.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nApostol proposed to his girlfriend of six and half years, Rachel Foulger, during the finale of [[Marriage_Boot_Camp#Season_4_-_Marriage_Boot_Camp:_Reality_Stars_2|''Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars 2'']].

It is one of three National Parks in Wales, the others being the [[Brecon Beacons]] ''(Bannau Brycheiniog)'' and [[Snowdonia]] ''(Eryri)''.\n\n==Landscape==\n[[File:St Govans' chapel - geograph.org.uk - 876068.jpg|thumb|180px|[[St. Govan's Chapel]]]]\nThe National Park has a varied landscape of rugged [[cliff]]s, sandy [[beach]]es, wooded estuaries, wild inland hills, the moorland of the Preseli Hills and the wooded Gwaun valley. The total area is {{convert|629|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. There are four distinct sections: clockwise these are the south Pembrokeshire coast, including [[Caldey Island]]; the [[Daugleddau]] estuary; the [[St Bride's Bay]] coast, including the coastal islands; and the [[Preseli Hills]].\n\t\n[[File:Green Bridge of Wales.jpeg|thumb|180px|The Green Bridge of Wales]]\nThe [[geology]] of the area is of particular interest with many good exposures both inland and along the coast, exhibiting a variety of rock types and structural features such as [[natural arch]]es, [[stack (geology)|stacks]], [[Fold (geology)|rock folding]] and [[sea cave]]s. A stack of note is Stack Rocks (Creigiau Elegug), two large detached pillars of limestone which in the spring provide valued nesting sites for razorbills and guillemots.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/southwest/nature/thingstodo/walks/allwalks/stack_rocks_st_govans.shtml | title=Stack Rocks/St Govan's | work=BBC Wales | author= | date= | accessdate=5 February 2011}}</ref> In the north, the rocks of [[Carn Llidi]], Pen Beri and Garn Fawr, together with the extensive [[moorland]] on [[Mynydd Carningli]] and [[Mynydd Preseli]], give an exposed and mountainous feel to the landscape, cut through by the wooded valleys of the [[River Gwaun|Gwaun]] and [[Afon Nyfer|Nevern]]. In the west, the National Park is dominated by the broad sweep of [[St Bride's Bay]], bounded at its northern end by [[Ramsey Island]], near [[St David's]] peninsula, and at its southern end by [[Skomer]]. The southern coast is another contrast, with the limestone plateau and cliffs of the [[Castlemartin, Pembrokeshire|Castlemartin]] peninsula, the steep-sided wooded valleys inland from [[Amroth, Pembrokeshire|Amroth]]; the [[Bosherston]] lakes - now, like much of the coastal strip, in the care of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] - and the tourist resorts of [[Tenby]] and [[Saundersfoot]]. Between the western and southern areas of the National Park lies the [[Milford Haven]] waterway, where the tranquil Daugleddau estuary feeds into one of the finest natural deep water harbours in the world.<ref name=pcnpa>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcnpa.org.uk/PCNP/live/sitefiles/related_items/NPMP.pdf  |accessdate=April 13, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=August 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pentre Ifan burial chamber - geograph.org.uk - 384085.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Pentre Ifan]]]]\nThe National Park includes many sites (such as [[Pentre Ifan]]) of historic and archaeological importance and areas which are of national or international nature conservation significance in their own right, including 7 [[Special Areas of Conservation]], a [[Marine Nature Reserve]], 6 [[national nature reserve (United Kingdom)|national nature reserve]]s and 75 [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]].\n\nIn 2011 [[National Geographic Traveller (magazine)|National Geographic]] magazine voted Pembrokeshire the second best coastal destination in the world for sustainable tourism.<ref>[http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/article.asp?PageId=3&ArticleId=606 www.NationalTrails.co.uk - news article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628171903/http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/article.asp?PageId=3&ArticleId=606 |date=2011-06-28 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/need-to-read/2011/08/10/pembrokeshire-coast-path-walks-off-with-accolade-of-being-one-of-world-s-top-trails-91466-29209191/2/ www.WalesOnline.co.uk - Accolade of being one of world's top trails]</ref>\n\nIn January 2016 the Authority launched the \"Changing Coasts\" project to document the way the coastline has changed as a result of recent winter storms; the project invites visitors to submit photographs taken (at any time of day) from fixed points; a pilot study will be carried out at [[Abereiddy]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC|date=31 January 2016|title=Pembrokeshire Changing Coasts photography project launched|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-35440757|accessdate=1 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Pembrokeshire Coast Path==\n{{main article|Pembrokeshire Coast Path}}\nThe Pembrokeshire Coast Path is a designated [[National Trail]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/trail.asp?PageId=33 |title=Pembrokeshire Coast Path |publisher=National Trails |accessdate=14 August 2013}}</ref>  It was established in 1970, and is {{convert|186|mi}} long, much of it at cliff-top level, with a total of {{convert|35,000|ft}} of ascent and descent.\n\nThe southern end of the path is at [[Amroth, Pembrokeshire|Amroth]].

The film stars [[Edward Norton]] and [[Edward Furlong]], as two brothers from Los Angeles who are involved in the [[white supremacist]] and [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] movements. The older brother (Norton) serves three years in prison for [[voluntary manslaughter]], and during this time, he is rehabilitated, and then tries to prevent his brother from going down the same path. The supporting cast includes [[Fairuza Balk]], [[Stacy Keach]], [[Elliott Gould]], [[Avery Brooks]], [[Ethan Suplee]] and [[Beverly D'Angelo]]. \n\nThe story is fictional, but the characters are based on McKenna's childhood and experiences of growing up in San Diego. Eager to adapt it into a film, he then sold the script to [[New Line Cinema]], who were impressed by the writing. ''American History X'' was Kaye's first directorial role in a feature film. Budgeted at $20 million, filming took place in 1997. Before the film's release, Kaye and the film studio were hampered by a number of disputes about the final cut of the film. The final version was longer than Kaye intended, which resulted in him publicly disowning the film, and hurting his own career in Hollywood.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on October 30, 1998 and distributed by New Line Cinema. Despite lukewarm success at the box office, grossing only $24 million worldwide, ''American History X'' was acclaimed by critics. In particular, Norton was praised for his compelling and realistic performance, which earned him an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. The film has stayed relevant over the years, especially because of the rise of [[white nationalism]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] movements. The film has also been used for educational purposes in the United States and in other countries.\n\n==Plot==\nHigh school student Danny Vinyard antagonizes his [[Jewish]] history teacher Mr. Murray by choosing to write a civil rights essay on ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. [[African-American]] principal and [[outreach]] worker Dr. Bob Sweeney tells Danny that he will study history through [[current event]]s under Sweeney's direction or be expelled, calling their class ''American History X''. Danny's first assignment is a paper on his older brother Derek, a past student of Sweeney's and former [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] leader released from prison that day. In the bathroom, Danny finds three African-American students bullying a white student and intervenes, openly disrespecting the black students.\n\nDr. Sweeney meets with police officers being briefed on Derek's release. Years earlier, Danny and Derek's father, a [[firefighter]], was shot and killed by African-American drug dealers while putting out a fire at their home. In a television interview after his father's death, Derek erupts in a racist tirade. High-profile racist Cameron Alexander becomes Derek's [[mentor]] and they form their own violent white supremacist gang called the Disciples of Christ (D.O.C.), in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice Beach]]. A skilled basketball player, Derek is dragged into a game against several [[Crips]], winning control of the local courts. Derek leads a violent attack on a supermarket owned by a Korean man employing [[Illegal immigration from Mexico to the United States|illegal Mexican immigrants]], which Danny records on a [[camcorder]].\n\nDerek's mother Doris, invites Murray, her boyfriend, for dinner where a heated argument about [[Rodney King]] and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] occurs. Derek assaults his sister Davina, and Doris tells Derek to leave home. That night, the same group of Crips that Derek had beaten in the basketball game earlier attempt to steal his truck. Derek shoots and kills one of them and [[curb stomp]]s another. He is sentenced to three years in the [[California Institution for Men]] for [[voluntary manslaughter]].\n\nIn prison, Derek joins the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] and works in the laundry, partnered with Lamont, an African-American. Derek is initially unfriendly, but develops rapport with him over their shared interest of basketball. Derek becomes disillusioned by [[prison gang]] politics; he believes in the ideology, but disapproves of his gang's dealings with non-white gangs. Turning his back on them, he is beaten and [[prison rape|raped]] in the shower by the Aryan Brotherhood. Derek is visited in the hospital wing by Sweeney, with whom he pleads for help to get out of prison. Sweeney warns that Danny has become involved with the D.O.C. gang. Derek ignores the Aryan Brotherhood, and Lamont warns that he may be targeted by African-American gangs. An attack never comes, and Derek spends the remainder of his sentence alone, reading books from Sweeney. Upon his release, he says goodbye to Lamont, deducing he was the reason Derek was not attacked.\n\nReturning home, Derek finds Danny emulating him, sporting a D.O.C. [[tattoo]] and a [[White power skinhead|skinhead]]. Derek tries to persuade him to leave the gang, but Danny feels betrayed. Derek's best friend Seth, also a D.O.C. member, frequently disrespects Derek's mother and sister, while grooming Danny for the gang; Seth and Danny are closely controlled by Cameron. At a neo-Nazi party, Derek confronts Cameron for his manipulative behavior, and says that he and Danny will no longer be associated with the movement. Cameron, Derek's former girlfriend Stacy, and the others turn on Derek, who assaults Cameron for insisting Danny will remain under his influence. Seth holds Derek at gunpoint, but Derek disarms him and flees. \n\nAfterwards, Derek tells Danny about his experience in prison, which seems to prompt a change in Danny. The pair return home and remove hateful posters from their shared bedroom. The next morning, Danny completes his paper, reflecting on his reasons for adopting white supremacist values, and their flaws. He says that although Derek's racist views may seem to have arisen from anger over his father's death, Danny believes that the seed for his brother's views was planted years earlier; his father often delivered racist rants and [[epithet]]<nowiki/>s, and his death misdirected Derek's anger into racism. Derek walks Danny to school, stopping at a [[diner]] for breakfast.\n\nSweeney and a police officer inform Derek that Seth and Cameron are in [[intensive care unit]] after an attack. Derek reluctantly agrees to talk with the people he denounced; walking Danny to school, Derek notices a car may be following him. At school, Danny is shot dead by an African-American student from the previous day's incident. Derek runs to the school and cradles Danny's bloodied body, blaming himself for influencing Danny's views that led him to a conflict with the student. In a [[narration|voiceover]], Danny reads the final lines of his paper for Dr. Sweeney, quoting the final stanza of [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Derek Vinyard\n* [[Edward Furlong]] as Danny Vinyard\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as Doris Vinyard\n* [[Jennifer Lien]] as Davina Vinyard\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as Seth Ryan\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as Stacey\n* [[Avery Brooks]] as Dr. Bob Sweeney\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as Murray\n* [[Stacy Keach]] as Cameron Alexander\n* [[William Russ]] as Dennis Vinyard\n* [[Guy Torry]] as Lamont \n* [[Joseph Cortese]] as Rasmussen\n* Antonio David Lyons as Lawrence\n* [[Keram Malicki-S\u00e1nchez]] as Chris\n* [[Giuseppe Andrews]] as Jason\n* [[Christopher Masterson]] as Daryl Dawson\n* [[Paul Le Mat]] as McMahon\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Michael De Luca 2012.jpg|alt=Michael De Luca, former president of productions at New Line Cinema|thumb|187x187px|[[Michael De Luca]], former production president at New Line Cinema.]]\nScreenwriter [[David McKenna (writer)|David McKenna]] wrote the screenplay for ''American History X'' and sold the rights to it when he was 26.

The point I tried to make in the script is that a person is not born a racist. It is learned through environment and the people that surround you.

The film stars [[Edward Norton]] and [[Edward Furlong]], as two brothers from Los Angeles who are involved in the [[white supremacist]] and [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] movements. The older brother (Norton) serves three years in prison for [[voluntary manslaughter]], and during this time, he is rehabilitated, and then tries to prevent his brother from going down the same path. The supporting cast includes [[Fairuza Balk]], [[Stacy Keach]], [[Elliott Gould]], [[Avery Brooks]], [[Ethan Suplee]] and [[Beverly D'Angelo]]. \n\nThe story is fictional, but the characters are based on McKenna's childhood and experiences of growing up in San Diego. Eager to adapt it into a film, he then sold the script to [[New Line Cinema]], who were impressed by the writing. ''American History X'' was Kaye's first directorial role in a feature film. Budgeted at $20 million, filming took place in 1997. Before the film's release, Kaye and the film studio were hampered by a number of disputes about the final cut of the film. The final version was longer than Kaye intended, which resulted in him publicly disowning the film, and hurting his own career in Hollywood.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on October 30, 1998 and distributed by New Line Cinema. Despite lukewarm success at the box office, grossing only $24 million worldwide, ''American History X'' was acclaimed by critics. In particular, Norton was praised for his compelling and realistic performance, which earned him an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. The film has stayed relevant over the years, especially because of the rise of [[white nationalism]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] movements. The film has also been used for educational purposes in the United States and in other countries.\n\n==Plot==\nHigh school student Danny Vinyard antagonizes his [[Jewish]] history teacher Mr. Murray by choosing to write a civil rights essay on ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. [[African-American]] principal and [[outreach]] worker Dr. Bob Sweeney tells Danny that he will study history through [[current event]]s under Sweeney's direction or be expelled, calling their class ''American History X''. Danny's first assignment is a paper on his older brother Derek, a past student of Sweeney's and former [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] leader released from prison that day. In the bathroom, Danny finds three African-American students bullying a white student and intervenes, openly disrespecting the black students.\n\nDr. Sweeney meets with police officers being briefed on Derek's release. Years earlier, Danny and Derek's father, a [[firefighter]], was shot and killed by African-American drug dealers while putting out a fire at their home. In a television interview after his father's death, Derek erupts in a racist tirade. High-profile racist Cameron Alexander becomes Derek's [[mentor]] and they form their own violent white supremacist gang called the Disciples of Christ (D.O.C.), in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice Beach]]. A skilled basketball player, Derek is dragged into a game against several [[Crips]], winning control of the local courts. Derek leads a violent attack on a supermarket owned by a Korean man employing [[Illegal immigration from Mexico to the United States|illegal Mexican immigrants]], which Danny records on a [[camcorder]].\n\nDerek's mother Doris, invites Murray, her boyfriend, for dinner where a heated argument about [[Rodney King]] and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] occurs. Derek assaults his sister Davina, and Doris tells Derek to leave home. That night, the same group of Crips that Derek had beaten in the basketball game earlier attempt to steal his truck. Derek shoots and kills one of them and [[curb stomp]]s another. He is sentenced to three years in the [[California Institution for Men]] for [[voluntary manslaughter]].\n\nIn prison, Derek joins the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] and works in the laundry, partnered with Lamont, an African-American. Derek is initially unfriendly, but develops rapport with him over their shared interest of basketball. Derek becomes disillusioned by [[prison gang]] politics; he believes in the ideology, but disapproves of his gang's dealings with non-white gangs. Turning his back on them, he is beaten and [[prison rape|raped]] in the shower by the Aryan Brotherhood. Derek is visited in the hospital wing by Sweeney, with whom he pleads for help to get out of prison. Sweeney warns that Danny has become involved with the D.O.C. gang. Derek ignores the Aryan Brotherhood, and Lamont warns that he may be targeted by African-American gangs. An attack never comes, and Derek spends the remainder of his sentence alone, reading books from Sweeney. Upon his release, he says goodbye to Lamont, deducing he was the reason Derek was not attacked.\n\nReturning home, Derek finds Danny emulating him, sporting a D.O.C. [[tattoo]] and a [[White power skinhead|skinhead]]. Derek tries to persuade him to leave the gang, but Danny feels betrayed. Derek's best friend Seth, also a D.O.C. member, frequently disrespects Derek's mother and sister, while grooming Danny for the gang; Seth and Danny are closely controlled by Cameron. At a neo-Nazi party, Derek confronts Cameron for his manipulative behavior, and says that he and Danny will no longer be associated with the movement. Cameron, Derek's former girlfriend Stacy, and the others turn on Derek, who assaults Cameron for insisting Danny will remain under his influence. Seth holds Derek at gunpoint, but Derek disarms him and flees. \n\nAfterwards, Derek tells Danny about his experience in prison, which seems to prompt a change in Danny. The pair return home and remove hateful posters from their shared bedroom. The next morning, Danny completes his paper, reflecting on his reasons for adopting white supremacist values, and their flaws. He says that although Derek's racist views may seem to have arisen from anger over his father's death, Danny believes that the seed for his brother's views was planted years earlier; his father often delivered racist rants and [[epithet]]<nowiki/>s, and his death misdirected Derek's anger into racism. Derek walks Danny to school, stopping at a [[diner]] for breakfast.\n\nSweeney and a police officer inform Derek that Seth and Cameron are in [[intensive care unit]] after an attack. Derek reluctantly agrees to talk with the people he denounced; walking Danny to school, Derek notices a car may be following him. At school, Danny is shot dead by an African-American student from the previous day's incident. Derek runs to the school and cradles Danny's bloodied body, blaming himself for influencing Danny's views that led him to a conflict with the student. In a [[narration|voiceover]], Danny reads the final lines of his paper for Dr. Sweeney, quoting the final stanza of [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Derek Vinyard\n* [[Edward Furlong]] as Danny Vinyard\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as Doris Vinyard\n* [[Jennifer Lien]] as Davina Vinyard\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as Seth Ryan\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as Stacey\n* [[Avery Brooks]] as Dr. Bob Sweeney\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as Murray\n* [[Stacy Keach]] as Cameron Alexander\n* [[William Russ]] as Dennis Vinyard\n* [[Guy Torry]] as Lamont \n* [[Joseph Cortese]] as Rasmussen\n* Antonio David Lyons as Lawrence\n* [[Keram Malicki-S\u00e1nchez]] as Chris\n* [[Giuseppe Andrews]] as Jason\n* [[Christopher Masterson]] as Daryl Dawson\n* [[Paul Le Mat]] as McMahon\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Michael De Luca 2012.jpg|alt=Michael De Luca, former president of productions at New Line Cinema|thumb|187x187px|[[Michael De Luca]], former production president at New Line Cinema.]]\nScreenwriter [[David McKenna (writer)|David McKenna]] wrote the screenplay for ''American History X'' and sold the rights to it when he was 26.

It is found throughout the world and is most common in countries where [[pork]] is eaten. There are two forms. One is due to eating undercooked pork that contains the cysts and results in adult worms in the intestines. The other, known as [[cysticercosis]], is due to eating food or water contaminated with feces from someone infected by the adult worms.\n\nThe adult worm has humans as its main host and has a flat, ribbon-like body which is white and measures 2 to 3 metres long or more. Its tiny long attachment, the [[scolex]], contains duodenum wall-[[Sucker (zoology)|suckers]] and a [[Rostellum (helminth)|rostellum]] as organs of attachment. The main body, the [[Strobilation|strobila]], consists of a chain of segments known as [[proglottids]]. Each proglottid is a little more than a self-sustainable, very lightly ingestive, [[Reproductive system|reproductive unit]]; hence, the [[tapeworm]] is a [[hermaphrodite]]. It completes its [[Life cycle (biology)|life cycle]] in humans as the [[definitive host]] and often [[pigs]] as [[Host (biology)#Types of hosts|intermediate or secondary host]]. It may be transmitted to pigs through [[human faeces]] contaminating their fodder, and back to humans wherever primary hosts through uncooked or undercooked pork bearing small cysts. Pigs ingest embryonated eggs called [[morula]], which develop into larvae, then [[oncosphere]]s, and ultimately into infective larvae, [[cysticerci]]. A cysticercus grows into an adult worm in human [[small intestine]]s. Primary hosts often present [[asymptomatic|no pathological symptoms]]. Secondary human hosts, infected by faecally contaminated water or matter by definition develop its complication cysticercosis, the most harmful and chronic form of which is [[neurocysticercosis]]. The primary hosts can be easily treated with medications. Treatment of secondary hosts is more difficult but possible.\n\nHuman primary hosting is best diagnosed by microscopy of eggs in faeces, often triggered by spotting proglottids (segments). In secondary hosting, imaging techniques such as [[computed tomography]] and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] are often employed. Blood samples can also be tested using [[ELISA|antibody reaction]] of [[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]].\n\n==Description==\nAdult ''T. solium ''is a [[Triploblasty|triploblastic]] [[acoelomate]], having no body cavity. It is normally 2 to 3 m in length, but can become much larger, sometimes over 8 m long. It is white in colour and flattened into a ribbon-like body.\n\nThe anterior end is a knob-like attachment organ (sometimes mistakenly-referred to as a \"head\") called a [[scolex]], 1&nbsp;mm in diameter. The scolex bears four radially arranged [[Sucker (zoology)|suckers]] that surround the rostellum. These are the organs of adhesive attachment to the intestinal wall of the host. The rostellum is armed with two rows of [[chitinous]] spiny hooks.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Physiology of Domestic Animals|last=Sjaastad|first=Oyestein V.|last2=Hove|first2=Knut|last3=Sand|first3=Olav|publisher=Scandinavian Veterinary Press|year=2010|isbn=9788291743073|edition=2|location=Oslo|pages=}}</ref> Its 22 to 32 rostellar hooks can be differentiated into short (130-\u00b5m) and long (180-\u00b5m) types. After a short neck is the elongated body, the strobila. The entire body is covered by a covering called a [[Tegument (helminth)|tegument]], which is an absorptive layer consisting of a mat of minute specialised [[microvilli]] called [[microtriches]]. The strobila is divided into segments called proglottids, 800 to 900 in number. Body growth starts from the neck region, so the oldest proglottids are at the posterior end. Thus, the three distinct proglottids are immature proglottids towards the neck, mature proglottids in the middle, and [[Gravidity and parity#Gravidity in biology|gravid]] proglottids at the posterior end. A [[hermaphroditic]] species, each mature proglottid contains a set of male and female reproductive systems. The numerous [[testes]] and a bilobed [[ovary]] open into a common genital pore.

It passes through pigs or other animals, as intermediate hosts, into humans, as definitive hosts. In humans the infection can be relatively short or long lasting, and in the latter case if reaching the brain can last for life. From humans, the eggs are released in the environment where they await ingestion by another host. In the secondary host, the eggs develop into oncospheres which bore through the intestinal wall and migrate to other parts of the body where the cysticerci form. The cysticerci can survive for several years in the animal.<ref>Biology. (2013, January 10). Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/taeniasis/biology.html</ref>\n\n===Definitive host===\nHumans are colonised by the larval stage, the cysticercus, from undercooked pork or other meat. Each microscopic cysticercus is oval in shape, containing an inverted scolex (specifically \"protoscolex\"), which everts once the organism is inside the small intestine. This process of [[evagination]] is stimulated by [[bile juice]] and [[digestive enzymes]] (of the host). Then, the T. Solium lodges in the host\u2019s upper intestine by using its crowned hooks and 4 suckers to enter the intestinal mucosa. Then, the scolex is fixed into the intestine by having the suckers attached to the villi and hooks extended. It grows in size using nutrients from the surroundings. Its strobila lengthens as new proglottids are formed at the foot of the neck. In 10\u201312 weeks after initial colonization, it is an adult worm. As a hermaphrodite, it reproduces by [[self-fertilisation]], or [[cross-fertilisation]] if [[gametes]] are exchanged between two different proglottids. [[Spermatozoa]] fuse with the [[ovum|ova]] in the fertilisation duct, where the [[zygote]]s are produced. The zygote undergoes [[holoblastic]] and unequal [[Cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] resulting in three cell types, small, medium and large (micromeres, mesomeres, megameres). Megameres develop into a syncytial layer, the outer embryonic membrane; mesomeres into the radially striated inner embryonic membrane or embryophore; micromeres become the [[morula]]. The morula transforms into a six-hooked embryo known as an [[oncosphere]], or hexacanth (\"six hooked\") larva. A gravid proglottid can contain more than 50,000 embryonated eggs. Gravid proglottids often rupture in the intestine, liberating the oncospheres in faeces. Intact gravid proglottids are shed off in groups of four or five. The free eggs and detached proglottids are spread through the host's defecation ([[peristalsis]]). Oncospheres can survive in the environment for up to two months.<ref name=carter/><ref name=mayta>{{cite book|last=Mayta|first=Holger|title=Cloning and Characterization of Two Novel Taenia Solium Antigenic Proteins and Applicability to the Diagnosis and Control of Taeniasis/cysticercosis|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9780549938996|pages=4\u201312|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nX4SXfyv1v8C&dq|year=2009}}</ref> However, during a British military outbreak due to cysticercosis, an accurate Epidemiological data after 2 to 5 years of exposure concluded that most tapeworms would live less than 5 years inside of a definitive host.\n\n===Intermediate host===\nPigs are the most common host who ingest such eggs in traces of human faeces, mainly from vegetation contaminated with it such as from water bearing traces of it. The embryonated eggs enter intestine where they [[Hatching|hatch]] into motile oncospheres. The embryonic and basement membranes are removed by the host's digestive enzymes (particularly [[pepsin]]). Then the free oncospheres attach on the intestinal wall using their hooks. With the help of digestive enzymes from the penetration glands, they penetrate the [[intestinal mucosa]] to enter [[Blood vessel|blood]] and [[lymphatic vessels]]. They move along the general [[circulatory system]] to various organs, and large numbers are cleared in the [[liver]]. The surviving oncospheres preferentially migrate to [[Striated Muscles|striated muscles]], as well as the [[brain]], liver, and other tissues, where they settle to form [[cysts]] &mdash; cysticerci. A single cysticercus is spherical, measuring 1\u20132&nbsp;cm in diameter, and contains an invaginated protoscolex. The central space is filled with fluid like a [[bladder]], hence it is also called bladder worm. Cysticerci are usually formed within 70 days and may continue to grow for a year.<ref name=garcia>{{cite book|last=Garcia|first=Oscar H.

As in pigs, the oncospheres hatch and enter blood circulation. When they settle to form cysts, clinical symptoms of [[cysticercosis]] appear. The cysticercus is often called the metacestode.\n\n==Diseases==\n{{Main article|Cysticercosis|Taeniasis}}\n=== Signs and symptoms ===\n====Taeniasis====\nTaeniasis is infection in the intestines by the adult worms. It generally has mild or [[non-specific symptoms]]. This may include abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea and constipation. Such symptoms will arise when the tapeworm has fully developed in the intestine, this would be around eight weeks after the contraction (ingestion of meat containing cysticerci).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/taeniasis-cysticercosis|title=Taeniasis/Cysticercosis|website=www.who.int|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>\n\nThese symptoms could continue until the tapeworm dies from the course of treatment but otherwise could continue for many years, as long as the worm lives. If untreated it is common that the infections with Taenia solium tapeworms last for approximately 2\u20133 years. It is possible that infected people may show no symptoms for years.<ref name=\":0\" /> Only in severe cases, conditions of intestinal irritation, anaemia, and indigestion occur, which can lead to loss of appetite and emaciation.\n\n====Cysticercosis====\nIngestion of ''T. solium'' eggs or proglottids which rupture within the host intestines can cause [[larva]]e to migrate into host tissue to cause cysticercosis. This is the most frequent and severe disease caused by ''T. solium''. In symptomatic cases, a wide spectrum of symptoms may be expressed, including headaches, dizziness, and seizures. The leading cause of seizures worldwide is from neurocysticercosis.\n \nIn more severe cases, [[dementia]] or [[hypertension]] can occur due to perturbation of the normal circulation of [[cerebrospinal fluid]]. (Any increase in intracranial pressure will result in a corresponding increase in [[arterial blood pressure]], as the body seeks to maintain circulation to the brain.) The severity of cysticercosis depends on location, size and number of parasite larvae in tissues, as well as the host [[immune response]]. Other symptoms include sensory deficits, involuntary movements, and brain system dysfunction. In children, [[human eye|ocular]] location of cysts is more common than cystation in other locations of the body.<ref name=pawlowski/>\n\nIn many cases, cysticercosis in the brain can lead to [[epilepsy]], [[seizures]], [[lesions]] in the brain, [[blindness]], [[tumour]]-like growths, and low [[eosinophil]] levels. It is the cause of major neurological problems, such as [[hydrocephalus]], [[paraplegy]], [[meningitis]], [[convulsion]]s, and even death.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Flisser|first=A. |author2=Avila G |author3=Maravilla P |author4=Mendlovic F |author5=Le\u00f3n-Cabrera S |author6=Cruz-Rivera M |author7=Garza A |author8=G\u00f3mez B |author9=Aguilar L |author10=Ter\u00e1n N |author11=Velasco S |author12=Ben\u00edtez M |author13=Jimenez-Gonzalez DE|title=Taenia solium: current understanding of laboratory animal models of taeniosis|journal=Parasitology|volume=137|issue=3|pages=347\u201357|doi=10.1017/S0031182010000272|pmid=20188011|year=2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Diagnosis ===\n[[Stool test]]s commonly include [[Stool test#Microbiology tests|microbiology testing]] \u2013 the microscopic examination of stools after concentration aims to determine the amount of eggs.

It is found throughout the world and is most common in countries where [[pork]] is eaten. There are two forms. One is due to eating undercooked pork that contains the cysts and results in adult worms in the intestines. The other, known as [[cysticercosis]], is due to eating food or water contaminated with feces from someone infected by the adult worms.\n\nThe adult worm has humans as its main host and has a flat, ribbon-like body which is white and measures 2 to 3 metres long or more. Its tiny long attachment, the [[scolex]], contains duodenum wall-[[Sucker (zoology)|suckers]] and a [[Rostellum (helminth)|rostellum]] as organs of attachment. The main body, the [[Strobilation|strobila]], consists of a chain of segments known as [[proglottids]]. Each proglottid is a little more than a self-sustainable, very lightly ingestive, [[Reproductive system|reproductive unit]]; hence, the [[tapeworm]] is a [[hermaphrodite]]. It completes its [[Life cycle (biology)|life cycle]] in humans as the [[definitive host]] and often [[pigs]] as [[Host (biology)#Types of hosts|intermediate or secondary host]]. It may be transmitted to pigs through [[human faeces]] contaminating their fodder, and back to humans wherever primary hosts through uncooked or undercooked pork bearing small cysts. Pigs ingest embryonated eggs called [[morula]], which develop into larvae, then [[oncosphere]]s, and ultimately into infective larvae, [[cysticerci]]. A cysticercus grows into an adult worm in human [[small intestine]]s. Primary hosts often present [[asymptomatic|no pathological symptoms]]. Secondary human hosts, infected by faecally contaminated water or matter by definition develop its complication cysticercosis, the most harmful and chronic form of which is [[neurocysticercosis]]. The primary hosts can be easily treated with medications. Treatment of secondary hosts is more difficult but possible.\n\nHuman primary hosting is best diagnosed by microscopy of eggs in faeces, often triggered by spotting proglottids (segments). In secondary hosting, imaging techniques such as [[computed tomography]] and [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] are often employed. Blood samples can also be tested using [[ELISA|antibody reaction]] of [[enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]].\n\n==Description==\nAdult ''T. solium ''is a [[Triploblasty|triploblastic]] [[acoelomate]], having no body cavity. It is normally 2 to 3 m in length, but can become much larger, sometimes over 8 m long. It is white in colour and flattened into a ribbon-like body.\n\nThe anterior end is a knob-like attachment organ (sometimes mistakenly-referred to as a \"head\") called a [[scolex]], 1&nbsp;mm in diameter. The scolex bears four radially arranged [[Sucker (zoology)|suckers]] that surround the rostellum. These are the organs of adhesive attachment to the intestinal wall of the host. The rostellum is armed with two rows of [[chitinous]] spiny hooks.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Physiology of Domestic Animals|last=Sjaastad|first=Oyestein V.|last2=Hove|first2=Knut|last3=Sand|first3=Olav|publisher=Scandinavian Veterinary Press|year=2010|isbn=9788291743073|edition=2|location=Oslo|pages=}}</ref> Its 22 to 32 rostellar hooks can be differentiated into short (130-\u00b5m) and long (180-\u00b5m) types. After a short neck is the elongated body, the strobila. The entire body is covered by a covering called a [[Tegument (helminth)|tegument]], which is an absorptive layer consisting of a mat of minute specialised [[microvilli]] called [[microtriches]]. The strobila is divided into segments called proglottids, 800 to 900 in number. Body growth starts from the neck region, so the oldest proglottids are at the posterior end. Thus, the three distinct proglottids are immature proglottids towards the neck, mature proglottids in the middle, and [[Gravidity and parity#Gravidity in biology|gravid]] proglottids at the posterior end. A [[hermaphroditic]] species, each mature proglottid contains a set of male and female reproductive systems. The numerous [[testes]] and a bilobed [[ovary]] open into a common genital pore.

It passes through pigs or other animals, as intermediate hosts, into humans, as definitive hosts. In humans the infection can be relatively short or long lasting, and in the latter case if reaching the brain can last for life. From humans, the eggs are released in the environment where they await ingestion by another host. In the secondary host, the eggs develop into oncospheres which bore through the intestinal wall and migrate to other parts of the body where the cysticerci form. The cysticerci can survive for several years in the animal.<ref>Biology. (2013, January 10). Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/taeniasis/biology.html</ref>\n\n===Definitive host===\nHumans are colonised by the larval stage, the cysticercus, from undercooked pork or other meat. Each microscopic cysticercus is oval in shape, containing an inverted scolex (specifically \"protoscolex\"), which everts once the organism is inside the small intestine. This process of [[evagination]] is stimulated by [[bile juice]] and [[digestive enzymes]] (of the host). Then, the T. Solium lodges in the host\u2019s upper intestine by using its crowned hooks and 4 suckers to enter the intestinal mucosa. Then, the scolex is fixed into the intestine by having the suckers attached to the villi and hooks extended. It grows in size using nutrients from the surroundings. Its strobila lengthens as new proglottids are formed at the foot of the neck. In 10\u201312 weeks after initial colonization, it is an adult worm. As a hermaphrodite, it reproduces by [[self-fertilisation]], or [[cross-fertilisation]] if [[gametes]] are exchanged between two different proglottids. [[Spermatozoa]] fuse with the [[ovum|ova]] in the fertilisation duct, where the [[zygote]]s are produced. The zygote undergoes [[holoblastic]] and unequal [[Cleavage (embryo)|cleavage]] resulting in three cell types, small, medium and large (micromeres, mesomeres, megameres). Megameres develop into a syncytial layer, the outer embryonic membrane; mesomeres into the radially striated inner embryonic membrane or embryophore; micromeres become the [[morula]]. The morula transforms into a six-hooked embryo known as an [[oncosphere]], or hexacanth (\"six hooked\") larva. A gravid proglottid can contain more than 50,000 embryonated eggs. Gravid proglottids often rupture in the intestine, liberating the oncospheres in faeces. Intact gravid proglottids are shed off in groups of four or five. The free eggs and detached proglottids are spread through the host's defecation ([[peristalsis]]). Oncospheres can survive in the environment for up to two months.<ref name=carter/><ref name=mayta>{{cite book|last=Mayta|first=Holger|title=Cloning and Characterization of Two Novel Taenia Solium Antigenic Proteins and Applicability to the Diagnosis and Control of Taeniasis/cysticercosis|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9780549938996|pages=4\u201312|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nX4SXfyv1v8C&dq|year=2009}}</ref> However, during a British military outbreak due to cysticercosis, an accurate Epidemiological data after 2 to 5 years of exposure, concluded that most tapeworms would live less than 5 years inside of a definitive host\n\n===Intermediate host===\nPigs are the most common host who ingest such eggs in traces of human faeces, mainly from vegetation contaminated with it such as from water bearing traces of it. The embryonated eggs enter intestine where they [[Hatching|hatch]] into motile oncospheres. The embryonic and basement membranes are removed by the host's digestive enzymes (particularly [[pepsin]]). Then the free oncospheres attach on the intestinal wall using their hooks. With the help of digestive enzymes from the penetration glands, they penetrate the [[intestinal mucosa]] to enter [[Blood vessel|blood]] and [[lymphatic vessels]]. They move along the general [[circulatory system]] to various organs, and large numbers are cleared in the [[liver]]. The surviving oncospheres preferentially migrate to [[Striated Muscles|striated muscles]], as well as the [[brain]], liver, and other tissues, where they settle to form [[cysts]] &mdash; cysticerci. A single cysticercus is spherical, measuring 1\u20132&nbsp;cm in diameter, and contains an invaginated protoscolex. The central space is filled with fluid like a [[bladder]], hence it is also called bladder worm. Cysticerci are usually formed within 70 days and may continue to grow for a year.<ref name=garcia>{{cite book|last=Garcia|first=Oscar H.

As in pigs, the oncospheres hatch and enter blood circulation. When they settle to form cysts, clinical symptoms of [[cysticercosis]] appear. The cysticercus is often called the metacestode.\n\n==Diseases==\n{{Main article|Cysticercosis|Taeniasis}}\n=== Signs and symptoms ===\n====Taeniasis====\nTaeniasis is infection in the intestines by the adult worms. It generally has mild or [[non-specific symptoms]]. This may include abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea and constipation. Such symptoms will arise when the tapeworm has fully developed in the intestine, this would be around eight weeks after the contraction (ingestion of meat containing cysticerci).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/taeniasis-cysticercosis|title=Taeniasis/Cysticercosis|website=www.who.int|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>\n\nThese symptoms could continue until the tapeworm dies from the course of treatment but otherwise could continue for many years, as long as the worm lives. If untreated it is common that the infections with Taenia solium tapeworms last for approximately 2\u20133 years. It is possible that infected people may show no symptoms for years.<ref name=\":0\" /> Only in severe cases, conditions of intestinal irritation, anaemia, and indigestion occur, which can lead to loss of appetite and emaciation.\n\n====Cysticercosis====\nIngestion of ''T. solium'' eggs or proglottids which rupture within the host intestines can cause [[larva]]e to migrate into host tissue to cause cysticercosis. This is the most frequent and severe disease caused by ''T. solium''. In symptomatic cases, a wide spectrum of symptoms may be expressed, including headaches, dizziness, and seizures. The leading cause of seizures worldwide is from neurocysticercosis.\n \nIn more severe cases, [[dementia]] or [[hypertension]] can occur due to perturbation of the normal circulation of [[cerebrospinal fluid]]. (Any increase in intracranial pressure will result in a corresponding increase in [[arterial blood pressure]], as the body seeks to maintain circulation to the brain.) The severity of cysticercosis depends on location, size and number of parasite larvae in tissues, as well as the host [[immune response]]. Other symptoms include sensory deficits, involuntary movements, and brain system dysfunction. In children, [[human eye|ocular]] location of cysts is more common than cystation in other locations of the body.<ref name=pawlowski/>\n\nIn many cases, cysticercosis in the brain can lead to [[epilepsy]], [[seizures]], [[lesions]] in the brain, [[blindness]], [[tumour]]-like growths, and low [[eosinophil]] levels. It is the cause of major neurological problems, such as [[hydrocephalus]], [[paraplegy]], [[meningitis]], [[convulsion]]s, and even death.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Flisser|first=A. |author2=Avila G |author3=Maravilla P |author4=Mendlovic F |author5=Le\u00f3n-Cabrera S |author6=Cruz-Rivera M |author7=Garza A |author8=G\u00f3mez B |author9=Aguilar L |author10=Ter\u00e1n N |author11=Velasco S |author12=Ben\u00edtez M |author13=Jimenez-Gonzalez DE|title=Taenia solium: current understanding of laboratory animal models of taeniosis|journal=Parasitology|volume=137|issue=3|pages=347\u201357|doi=10.1017/S0031182010000272|pmid=20188011|year=2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Diagnosis ===\n[[Stool test]]s commonly include [[Stool test#Microbiology tests|microbiology testing]] \u2013 the microscopic examination of stools after concentration aims to determine the amount of eggs.

However, humans can also act as secondary hosts, which is a more pathological, harmful stage triggered by oral contamination.
