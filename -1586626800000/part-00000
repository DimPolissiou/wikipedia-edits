Barranquitas is spread over 6 wards and Barranquitas Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the [[San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\nBarranquitas is about one hour by winding roads from [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], the capital. It is nestled amid hills and mountains, and nearby, between Barranquitas and Aibonito, is located the \"ca\u00f1\u00f3n de San Crist\u00f3bal\" (Canyon of Saint Cristopher); one of the deepest canyons in the Indies. For years, the overlook was used as a municipal garbage; in the last decade, the refuse was removed and the site restored.\n\n==History==\n\nBarranquitas's local Taino Indian Cacique (Chief) was called [[Orocobix]] and his yucayeque or tribe was known as the [[Jatibonicu]] [[Ta\u00edno people|Taino]].\n\nThe town was founded in 1803 by Antonio Aponte Ramos.<ref name=\"PR_Ency\" />\nEarly in the 20th century, Barranquitas residents, known as ''Barranquite\u00f1os'', had a short but legendary territory war with residents of the city of [[Comerio, Puerto Rico|Comer\u00edo]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nBarranquitas is a landlocked municipality in the middle of the [[Cordillera Central (Puerto Rico)|Cordillera Central]] of Puerto Rico, which is the main mountain range that crosses the island from west to east. It is bordered by the municipalities of Corozal, Naranjito, Coamo, Aibonito, Orocovis, and Comer\u00edo. Barranquitas has a surface area of 34 square miles (88.4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>).<ref name=\"PR_Ency\">{{cite web|url=https://enciclopediapr.org/en/encyclopedia/barranquitas-municipality/|title=Barranquitas Municipality|publisher=Fundaci\u00f3n Puertorrique\u00f1a de las Humanidades (FPH)| website=enciclopediapr.org}}</ref>\n\nThe terrain is mostly mountainous.

Some also have an apparent mestizo look to them. The reason for this phenomenon is due to the migration of many Taino Indians during the Spanish colonization. Many Tainos fled to the mountainous region to escape slavery. Many poor Spanish and other European immigrants moved to this region as well and settled as coffee growers. Eventually, the Taino and European immigrants intermarried and created what is called the \"[[mestizo]]\".\n\n==Government==\n{{main|Mayoralty in Puerto Rico}}\nAll municipalities in Puerto Rico are administered by a [[mayor]], elected every four years. The current mayor of Barranquitas is [[Francisco L\u00f3pez L\u00f3pez|Francisco L\u00f3pez]], of the [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico|New Progressive Party]] (PNP).

This has made Barranquitas a popular tourist attraction among Puerto Ricans. The birthplace of Mu\u00f1oz Rivera has been turned into a museum. The mausoleum of the Mu\u00f1oz Rivera family is another place of interest. Among those buried are Mu\u00f1oz Rivera and his son and daughter-in-law, Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn, and his second wife In\u00e9s Mendoza de Mu\u00f1oz.\n\nOther known places of interest in Barranquitas are the San Crist\u00f3bal Canyon, and the ruins of Hacienda Margarita.

Some also have an apparent mestizo look to them. The reason for this phenomenon is due to the migration of many Taino Indians during the Spanish colonization.

The band was founded in 1995 by percussionist [[Shawn Crahan]], drummer [[Joey Jordison]] and bassist [[Paul Gray (American musician)|Paul Gray]]. After several lineup changes in its early years, the band settled on nine members for more than a decade: Crahan, Jordison, Gray, [[Craig Jones (musician)|Craig Jones]], [[Mick Thomson]], [[Corey Taylor]], [[Sid Wilson]], [[Chris Fehn]], and [[Jim Root]]. Gray died on May 24, 2010, and was replaced during 2011\u20132014 by guitarist [[Donnie Steele]]. Jordison was dismissed from the band on December 12, 2013. Steele left during the recording sessions for ''[[.5: The Gray Chapter]]''. The band found replacements in [[Alessandro Venturella]] on bass and [[Jay Weinberg]] on drums. After the departure of Jordison, {{as of |December 2013|alt=as of December 2013}} the only founding member in the current lineup is percussionist Crahan. Fehn was also dismissed from the band in March of 2019 prior to the writing of ''[[We Are Not Your Kind]]''.\n\nSlipknot is well known for its attention-grabbing image, aggressive style of music, and energetic and chaotic live shows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/slipknot-mn0000750742 |title=Slipknot |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=February 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Slipknot.html?id=67tBhuvwLuYC |title=Slipknot: Unmasked |publisher=Joel McIver |date=December 1, 2001|isbn=9780711986770 }}</ref> The band rapidly rose to fame following the release of their [[Slipknot (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1999. The 2001 follow-up album, ''[[Iowa (album)|Iowa]]'', although darker in tone, made the band more popular. After a brief hiatus, Slipknot returned in 2004 with ''[[Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)]]'', before going on another hiatus and returning in 2008 with its fourth album, ''[[All Hope Is Gone]]'', which debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. After another long hiatus, Slipknot released its fifth studio album, ''[[.5: The Gray Chapter]]'', in 2014.

In 1991, the biggest heavy metal band in Des Moines was Atomic Opera, with [[Jim Root]] on guitar.<ref name=McIver11>{{Harvnb|McIver|2003|p=11}}</ref> Drummer [[Joey Jordison]] founded a [[thrash metal]] band called Modifidious, playing at a club called Runway. Modifidious opened for Atomic Opera on December 1, 1991, at the Runway, after which their guitarist left for the more successful Atomic Opera. Jordison replaced him with local guitarist [[Craig Jones (musician)|Craig Jones]].<ref name=\"Arnopp31\">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|pp=31\u201334}}</ref> Drummer [[Shawn Crahan]] formed another Des Moines band called Heads on the Wall, playing [[funk metal]] [[Cover version|cover songs]] at clubs and releasing a demo tape in July 1992. A fourth Des Moines band called Vexx played [[death metal]] with [[Anders Colsefni]] on drums and later vocals, [[Paul Gray (American musician)|Paul Gray]] on bass, and [[Josh Brainard]] on guitar and vocals. During this time, Crahan often went to the Runway on Sundays when the club opened to all ages, where he met other young musicians with whom he could [[Jam session|jam]]. By March 1993, Crahan was jamming with vocalist Colsefni, bassist Gray and guitarist Pat Neuwirth, writing and playing songs in Gray's basement, discussing possible band names such as Pull My Finger, but never making a final decision. One of the songs they recorded was titled \"Slipknot\"; another was titled \"Painface\", which Colsefni later used to name his band Painface.<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|p=63}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, a new band called Inveigh Catharsis formed in Des Moines, with Gray on bass, Brainard on guitar and Colsefni on drums. Jordison jammed occasionally with this group. Brainard eventually left to join Jordison and Jones in Modifidious, participating in demo recordings at the end of '93 and early in '94. During 1994, Modifidious sometimes played the same shows as Crahan's Heads on the Wall band. Gray formed a [[death metal]] band called Body Pit, soon becoming popular in the local scene.<ref name=McIver11/> Modifidious stopped playing in the wake of death metal's increasing pull. Gray failed to get Jordison to join Body Pit, but soon after he recruited local guitar teacher [[Mick Thomson]], the band broke up.<ref name=\"Arnopp31\"/>\n\nIn September 1995, Crahan and Gray started a band named the Pale Ones.<ref name=\"Arnopp40\"/> The lineup was made up of friends who met through the local music scene, including vocalist Colsefni and guitarist [[Donnie Steele]].<ref name=\"Arnopp40\">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|pp=40\u201341}}</ref> Not long after their inception, Gray invited Jordison to a rehearsal because the band was interested in experimenting with additional drum elements. Jordison subsequently joined the band as their main drummer, moving Crahan to percussion.<ref name=\"Arnopp40\"/> Furthermore, Colsefni also took up percussion while remaining the band's vocalist. The band then decided to invite Brainard as their second guitarist, bringing their lineup to six members.<ref name=\"Arnopp42\">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|pp=42\u201343}}</ref> On December 4, the band made their live debut; playing a benefit show using the name Meld.<ref>{{Harvnb|McIver|2003|p=17}}</ref>\n\n===Demo recording and beginnings (1995\u20131998)===\nMuch of the band's early development was retrospectively attributed to late-night planning sessions between Gray, Crahan and Jordison at a [[Sinclair Oil Corporation|Sinclair]] gas station where Jordison worked nights. It was there, in late 1995, that Jordison suggested changing the band name to Slipknot after their song of the same name.<ref name=\"Arnopp42\"/> In December, Slipknot began recording material at ''SR Audio'', a studio in the band's hometown.<ref name=\"McIver19\">{{Harvnb|McIver|2003|pp=19\u201321}}</ref> As they didn't have a recording contract, the band self-financed the project, the costs of which came to an estimated $40,000.<ref name=\"Arnopp45\">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|pp=45\u201347}}</ref> In February 1996, guitarist Donnie Steele, a Christian, left Slipknot after discussions regarding the band's lyrics with the producer, Sean McMahon.

Each star point was meant to stand for each of the nine members of the original band, with at least one member, [[Chris Fehn]], possessing a nonagram tattoo. Despite popular belief, the nonagram is not a Satanist symbol and instead represents Slipknot's \"battle with the fake world.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.slipknot-metal.com/main.php?sk=nonagram|title=Slipknot Nonagram|last=www.slipknot-metal.com|website=www.slipknot-metal.com|access-date=April 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe pre-release of the 2014 album ''.5: The Gray Chapter'' also witnessed a major change in the band's logo and branding strategy.

The band was founded in 1995 by percussionist [[Shawn Crahan]], drummer [[Joey Jordison]] and bassist [[Paul Gray (American musician)|Paul Gray]]. After several lineup changes in its early years, the band settled on nine members for more than a decade: Crahan, Jordison, Gray, [[Craig Jones (musician)|Craig Jones]], [[Mick Thomson]], [[Corey Taylor]], [[Sid Wilson]], [[Chris Fehn]], and [[Jim Root]]. Gray died on May 24, 2010, and was replaced during 2011\u20132014 by guitarist [[Donnie Steele]]. Jordison was dismissed from the band on December 12, 2013. Steele left during the recording sessions for ''[[.5: The Gray Chapter]]''. The band found replacements in [[Alessandro Venturella]] on bass and [[Jay Weinberg]] on drums. After the departure of Jordison, {{as of |December 2013|alt=as of December 2013}} the only founding member in the current lineup is percussionist Crahan. Fehn was also dismissed from the band in March of 2019 prior to the writing of ''[[We Are Not Your Kind]]''. \n\nSlipknot is well known for its attention-grabbing image, aggressive style of music, and energetic and chaotic live shows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/slipknot-mn0000750742 |title=Slipknot |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=February 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Slipknot.html?id=67tBhuvwLuYC |title=Slipknot: Unmasked |publisher=Joel McIver |date=December 1, 2001|isbn=9780711986770 }}</ref> The band rapidly rose to fame following the release of their [[Slipknot (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1999. The 2001 follow-up album, ''[[Iowa (album)|Iowa]]'', although darker in tone, made the band more popular. After a brief hiatus, Slipknot returned in 2004 with ''[[Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses)]]'', before going on another hiatus and returning in 2008 with its fourth album, ''[[All Hope Is Gone]]'', which debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. After another long hiatus, Slipknot released its fifth studio album, ''[[.5: The Gray Chapter]]'', in 2014. Their sixth studio album, ''[[We Are Not Your Kind]]'', was released on August 9, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/slipknot-new-song-unsainted-music-video-835736/|title=Slipknot Preview New Album With Unsparing Headbanger 'Unsainted'|last=Blistein|first=Jon|last2=Blistein|first2=Jon|date=2019-05-16|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-20}}</ref> The band has released two live albums titled ''[[9.0: Live]]'' and ''[[Day of the Gusano: Live in Mexico]]'', a compilation album titled ''[[Antennas to Hell]]'', and five live DVDs.

In 1991, the biggest heavy metal band in Des Moines was Atomic Opera, with [[Jim Root]] on guitar.<ref name=McIver11>{{Harvnb|McIver|2003|p=11}}</ref> Drummer [[Joey Jordison]] founded a [[thrash metal]] band called Modifidious, playing at a club called Runway. Modifidious opened for Atomic Opera on December 1, 1991, at the Runway, after which their guitarist left for the more successful Atomic Opera. Jordison replaced him with local guitarist [[Craig Jones (musician)|Craig Jones]].<ref name=\"Arnopp31\">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|pp=31\u201334}}</ref> Drummer [[Shawn Crahan]] formed another Des Moines band called Heads on the Wall, playing [[funk metal]] [[Cover version|cover songs]] at clubs and releasing a demo tape in July 1992. A fourth Des Moines band called Vexx played [[death metal]] with [[Anders Colsefni]] on drums and later vocals, [[Paul Gray (American musician)|Paul Gray]] on bass, and [[Josh Brainard]] on guitar and vocals. During this time, Crahan often went to the Runway on Sundays when the club opened to all ages, where he met other young musicians with whom he could [[Jam session|jam]]. By March 1993, Crahan was jamming with vocalist Colsefni, bassist Gray and guitarist Pat Neuwirth, writing and playing songs in Gray's basement, discussing possible band names such as Pull My Finger, but never making a final decision. One of the songs they recorded was titled \"Slipknot\"; another was titled \"Painface\", which Colsefni later used to name his band Painface.<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|p=63}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, a new band called Inveigh Catharsis formed in Des Moines, with Gray on bass, Brainard on guitar and Colsefni on drums. Jordison jammed occasionally with this group. Brainard eventually left to join Jordison and Jones in Modifidious, participating in demo recordings at the end of '93 and early in '94. During 1994, Modifidious sometimes played the same shows as Crahan's Heads on the Wall band. Gray formed a [[death metal]] band called Body Pit, soon becoming popular in the local scene.<ref name=McIver11/> Modifidious stopped playing in the wake of death metal's increasing pull. Gray failed to get Jordison to join Body Pit, but soon after he recruited local guitar teacher [[Mick Thomson]], the band broke up.<ref name=\"Arnopp31\"/>\n\nIn September 1995, Crahan and Gray started a band named the Pale Ones.<ref name=\"Arnopp40\"/> The lineup was made up of friends who met through the local music scene, including vocalist Colsefni and guitarist [[Donnie Steele]].<ref name=\"Arnopp40\">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|pp=40\u201341}}</ref> Not long after their inception, Gray invited Jordison to a rehearsal because the band was interested in experimenting with additional drum elements. Jordison subsequently joined the band as their main drummer, moving Crahan to percussion.<ref name=\"Arnopp40\"/> Furthermore, Colsefni also took up percussion while remaining the band's vocalist. The band then decided to invite Brainard as their second guitarist, bringing their lineup to six members.<ref name=\"Arnopp42\">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|pp=42\u201343}}</ref> On December 4, the band made their live debut; playing a benefit show using the name Meld.<ref>{{Harvnb|McIver|2003|p=17}}</ref>\n\n===Demo recording and beginnings (1995\u20131998)===\nMuch of the band's early development was retrospectively attributed to late-night planning sessions between Gray, Crahan and Jordison at a [[Sinclair Oil Corporation|Sinclair]] gas station where Jordison worked nights. It was there, in late 1995, that Jordison suggested changing the band name to Slipknot after their song of the same name.<ref name=\"Arnopp42\"/> In December, Slipknot began recording material at ''SR Audio'', a studio in the band's hometown.<ref name=\"McIver19\">{{Harvnb|McIver|2003|pp=19\u201321}}</ref> As they didn't have a recording contract, the band self-financed the project, the costs of which came to an estimated $40,000.<ref name=\"Arnopp45\">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|pp=45\u201347}}</ref> In February 1996, guitarist Donnie Steele, a Christian, left Slipknot after discussions regarding the band's lyrics with the producer, Sean McMahon. Jordison said of Steele's departure: \"(he) was having these God talks, when we were supposed to be working...We were prepared to keep him on, but he didn't want to stay.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=0UMRdh-eb0wC&pg=PT44&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=50|author=Jasob Arnopp|publisher=Random House|date=May 2011|title= Slipknot: Inside the Sickness, Behind the Masks|isbn=9781446458341}}</ref> Steele himself has said: \"I left for a few reasons...I had a lot on my mind spiritually.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mfkr1.com/web/2010-donnie-steele-interview/|title=Donnie Steele Interview|work=mfkr1.com|date=2010|author=David Pritt}}</ref> During the [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]] stages of their project at ''SR Audio'', [[Craig Jones (musician)|Craig Jones]] was recruited as Steele's replacement on guitar.<ref name=\"Arnopp50\">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|pp=50\u201351}}</ref> However, throughout their time in the studio, the band were adding [[Sampling (music)|samples]] to their recordings but could not produce these sounds live.

Each star point was meant to stand for each of the nine members of the original band, with at least one member, [[Chris Fehn]], possessing a nonagram tattoo. Despite popular belief, the nonagram is not a Satanist symbol and instead represents Slipknot's \"battle with the fake world.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.slipknot-metal.com/main.php?sk=nonagram|title=Slipknot Nonagram|last=www.slipknot-metal.com|website=www.slipknot-metal.com|access-date=April 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe pre-release of the 2014 album ''.5: The Gray Chapter'' also witnessed a major change in the band's logo and branding strategy.
