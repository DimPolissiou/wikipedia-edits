There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the processing of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new administrative county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire. \n\nHowever, despite the numerous changes to Worcestershire's administrative boundaries; guidance from the [[Ministry_of_Housing,_Communities_and_Local_Government|Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government]] in July 2019, contained recognition by Government that [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]] (or shires) still exist and their boundaries have never altered.\n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established during the [[heptarchy]], as an administrative and defensive unit in 918.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> Its purpose was to take into account the estates held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]], and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].

This was due to the size of the general population or historic status as 'Counties Corporate'.<ref>Local Government Act 1888, Section 31</ref> The Act also ensured that Worcestershire's boundaries for what was classified as \"non-administrative purposes\" would match that of the administrative county (including the county boroughs in most cases).

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], [[London]] and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation. A second report known as the ''West Midlands General Review'' looked into the administrative authorities within the wider [[West Midlands (region)|region]], including the remainder of Worcestershire.<ref>Local Government Commission for England: Report No 2. West Midlands General Review</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Special Review Area===\nThe commission made its report in July 1961.  It recommended that the Black Country area should be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only.

There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the processing of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new administrative county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire. \n\nHowever, despite the numerous changes to Worcestershire's administrative boundaries; guidance from the [[Ministry_of_Housing,_Communities_and_Local_Government|Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government]] in July 2019, contained recognition by Government that [[Historic counties of England|historic counties]] (or shires) still exist and their boundaries have never altered.\n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established during the [[heptarchy]], as an administrative and defensive unit in 918.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> Its purpose was to take into account the estates held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]], and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], [[London]] and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 6) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation. A second report known as the ''West Midlands General Review'' looked into the administrative authorities within the wider [[West Midlands (region)|region]], including the remainder of Worcestershire.<ref>Local Government Commission for England: Report No 2. West Midlands General Review</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Special Review Area===\nThe commission made its report in July 1961.  It recommended that the Black Country area should be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 6). The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual ''West Midlands Order 1965''. Halesowen was proposed to be included within an enlarged Smethwick County Borough, but a successful campaign entitled \"Hands off Halesowen\" orchestrated by a non-partisan group called the \"Halesowen Independence Committee\" helped stop the plans.<ref>[http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk Black Country Bugle] [http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html Hands off Halesowen \u2013 Town's 1960 Campaign For Independence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814151133/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html |date=14 August 2014 }} \u2013 Retrieved 13 August 2014</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the second report into the West Midland General Review area was also delivered in July 1961 and a proposal for Worcester to lose its county borough status<ref>The British Medical Journal \u2013 Vol. 1, No. 5242, 24 June 1961 \"Local Government Commission's Reports on West Midlands\"</ref> was not implemented.<ref>\"How Local government Areas Stand Today\", The Times, 12 February 1966</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Order 1965===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 250\n| image1 = West_Midlands_Order_1965.png\n| caption1 =  Fig 7: The boundaries of South Staffordshire, West Warwickshire and North Worcestershire after the local government reorganisations of the 1960s.\n| image2 = Warley map.png\n| caption2 = The County Borough of Warley \u2013 Warley's boundaries are shown as blue.

Millions of peasants were ordered away from agricultural work to join the iron and steel production workforce.\n\nIn 2008, [[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]] would summarize the effect of the focus on production targets :\n<blockquote>In [[Xinyang]], people starved at the doors of the grain warehouses. As they died, they shouted, \"Communist Party, Chairman Mao, save us\". If the granaries of [[Henan]] and [[Hebei]] had been opened, no one need have died. As people were dying in large numbers around them, officials did not think to save them. Their only concern was how to fulfill the delivery of grain.<ref name=trans>Translation from [http://en.chinaelections.org/newsinfo.asp?newsid=18328 \"A hunger for the truth: A new book, banned on the mainland, is becoming the definitive account of the Great Famine.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210190821/http://en.chinaelections.org/newsinfo.asp?newsid=18328 |date=10 February 2012 }}, chinaelections.org, 7 July 2008 of content from [[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]], ''\u5893\u7891 \uff0d\uff0d\u4e2d\u570b\u516d\u5341\u5e74\u4ee3\u5927\u9951\u8352\u7d00\u5be6 (Mu Bei \u2013 Zhong Guo Liu Shi Nian Dai Da Ji Huang Ji Shi)'', Hong Kong: Cosmos Books (Tian Di Tu Shu), 2008, {{ISBN|9789882119093}} {{in lang|zh}}</ref></blockquote>In fact, the topic of the People's commune and the degree in which it influenced the famine holds contention in regards to its overall influence.

They show that unlike most other famines, there was surprisingly more deaths in places that produced more food per capita and argue that the inflexibility in the centrally planned food procurement system explains at least half of the famine mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meng|first=Xin|last2=Qian|first2=Nancy|last3=Yared|first3=Pierre|date=2015-10-01|title=The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959\u20131961|url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/82/4/1568/2607347|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1568\u20131611|doi=10.1093/restud/rdv016|issn=0034-6527}}</ref> Economic historians James Kung and Shuo Chen show that there was more over procurement in places where politicians faced more competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kung|first=James Kai-Sing|last2=Chen|first2=Shuo|date=February 2011|title=The Tragedy of the Nomenklatura: Career Incentives and Political Radicalism during China's Great Leap Famine|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=105|issue=1|pages=27\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0003055410000626|issn=1537-5943}}</ref>\n\n==== Agricultural techniques ====\nAlong with [[collectivization]], the central government decreed several changes in agricultural techniques that would be based on the [[Lysenkoism|ideas]] of later-discredited Russian agronomist [[Trofim Lysenko]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The People's Republic of China, 1949\u201376|edition=second|first=Michael|last=Lynch|location=London|publisher=Hodder Education|year=2008|page=57}}</ref> One of these ideas was close planting, whereby the density of seedlings was at first tripled and then doubled again. The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague [[Terentiy Maltsev]], who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow extremely deeply into the soil (1 to 2 meters). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deep would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pest Campaign ====\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n<br />\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\n{{Confusing|section|date=May 2019}}The Party began to export excessive amounts of grain from regions in 1957 under the Great Leap Forward.

Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L. Yang|title=Calamity and Reform in China: State, Rural Society, and Institutional Change Since the Great Leap Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmLuoAkMKrkC|year=1996|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-3470-7|page=65}}</ref> <blockquote>First, it led to planners to shift lands from grain to economic crops, such as cotton, sugarcane, and beets, and divert huge numbers agricultural laborers into industrial sectors, fueling state demand for procured grain from the countryside. Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== More policies from central government ===\nGovernment policies that were implemented, particularly the [[Three Red Banners]] and the [[Socialist Education Movement]] (SEM), proved to be ideologically detrimental to the increasing famine.  The Three Red Banners of the CCP \"sparked the fanaticism of 1958\"  and the implementation of the General Line, one of the three banners which told people to, \"go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, better, and more economical results\" directly links to the pressures officials felt when reporting a superabundance of grain.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=87}}</ref> The SEM, established in 1957, also led to the severity of the famine in many ways, including the illusion of superabundance. Once the exaggerations of crop yields from the [[Mass line|General Line]] were reported, \"no one dared to 'dash cold water'\" on further reports.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=99}}</ref> The SEM also led to the establishment of conspiratory thoughts in which the peasants were believed to be pretending to be hungry in order to sabotage the state grain purchase.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=127|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\n=== Power relations in local government ===\n[[File:1957 Mao Zedong on airplane.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|[[Mao Zedong]] on an airplane, 1957]]\n\nLocal governments had just as much, if not more, influence on the famine than did agriculture and higher forms of government. As the Great Leap Forward progressed, many provincial leaders began to extend their reach by working closely with Mao and higher Party leaders; which, in turn resulted in these provincial leaders abusing power that they did not actually have.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L.

This hatred led to peasants becoming unable to openly speak on collectivization and state grain purchase. By enforcing such passivity at a local level while there already was passivity at an official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=110|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi. Anhui, having a radical pro-Mao government, was led by [[Zeng Xisheng]] who was \"dictatorial\" with ties to Mao.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=212\u2013213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref> Zeng firmly believed in the Great Leap Forward and tried to hold relationships with higher officials rather than keep close local ties. Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded that much of the severity of the famine came down to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=216\u2013218|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\n=== Natural disasters ===\nIn 1960, at least some degree of drought and other bad weather affected 55% of cultivated land, while an estimated 60% of agricultural land in northern China received no rain at all.<ref name=\"Atimes\">{{cite news|last=Liu|first=Henry C K|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FD01Ad04.html|title=Part 2: The Great Leap Forward not all bad|date=1 April 2004|work=[[Asia Times]] online|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204085928/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FD01Ad04.html|archive-date=4 February 2005}}</ref> The [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] yearbooks from 1958 to 1962 also reported abnormal weather, followed by droughts and floods based on Chinese government sources.

But the numbers were faked, and so were the fields that Mao observed, which had been carefully prepared in advance of Mao's visit by local officials, who removed shoots of grain from various fields and carefully transplanted them into a field prepared especially for Mao, which appeared to be a bumper crop.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nThe local officials became trapped by these sham demonstrations to Mao, and exhorted the peasants to reach unattainable goals, by \"deep ploughing and close planting\", and other techniques. This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields. No one was in a position to challenge Mao's ideas as incorrect, so peasants pulled out their bedding and coats into the fields, added seeds and water, and after they sprouted, buried the materials under the soil once the seedlings were high enough.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nIn a similar manner to the massive Soviet-created famine in Ukraine (the [[Holodomor]]), doctors were prohibited from listing \"starvation\" as a cause of death on death certificates. This kind of deception was far from uncommon; a famous [[propaganda]] picture from the famine shows Chinese children from [[Shandong]] province ostensibly standing atop a field of wheat, so densely grown that it could apparently support their weight. In reality, they were standing on a bench concealed beneath the plants, and the \"field\" was again entirely composed of individually transplanted stalks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNEdojrsMo|title=Mao's Great Famine|last=International School History|date=21 January 2015|accessdate=19 September 2018|via=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030033514/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNEdojrsMo|archive-date=30 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>[http://www.disasterhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Standing-on-Grain-Propaganda-1959.jpg Aforementioned propaganda photo. ]\n\n=== Reflections ===\nIn 1962, [[Liu Shaoqi]], then [[President of the People's Republic of China]], concluded after 44 days of field research in villages of [[Hunan]] that the reasons for the famine were 30% natural disaster and 70% human error.<ref>[http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/64172/85037/85039/5898093.html \u5218\u5c11\u5947\"\u4e09\u5206\u5929\u707e\uff0c\u4e03\u5206\u4eba\u7978\"\u63d0\u6cd5\u7684\u7531\u6765] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214040606/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/64172/85037/85039/5898093.html |date=14 December 2012 }}, Selection of the Party History (\u515a\u53f2\u535a\u91c7), 22 June 2007, Accessed Sept 1, 2018, CPC News. {{in lang|zh-Hans}}</ref>\n\n[[Amartya Sen]] puts this famine in a global context, arguing that lack of democracy is the major culprit: \"Indeed, no substantial famine has ever occurred in a democratic country\u2014no matter how poor.\" He adds that it is \"hard to imagine that anything like this could have happened in a country that goes to the polls regularly and that has an independent press.

Failure to abide by the policies led to punishment. The social pressure imposed on the citizens in terms of farming and business, which the government controlled, led to state instability. Owing to the laws passed during the period and the [[Great Leap Forward]] during 1958\u20131962, and according to an analysis by journalist Yang Jisheng, about 36 million people died of starvation in this period.<ref>Jisheng, Yang \"Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962\".

Iron and steel production was identified as a key requirement for economic advancement. Millions of peasants were ordered away from agricultural work to join the iron and steel production workforce.\n\n[[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]] would summarize the effect of the focus on production targets in 2008:\n<blockquote>In [[Xinyang]], people starved at the doors of the grain warehouses. As they died, they shouted, \"Communist Party, Chairman Mao, save us\". If the granaries of [[Henan]] and [[Hebei]] had been opened, no one need have died. As people were dying in large numbers around them, officials did not think to save them.

They show that unlike most other famines, there was surprisingly more deaths in places that produced more food per capita and argue that the inflexibility in the centrally planned food procurement system explains at least half of the famine mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meng|first=Xin|last2=Qian|first2=Nancy|last3=Yared|first3=Pierre|date=2015-10-01|title=The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959\u20131961|url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/82/4/1568/2607347|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1568\u20131611|doi=10.1093/restud/rdv016|issn=0034-6527}}</ref> Economic historians James Kung and Shuo Chen show that there was more over procurement in places where politicians faced more competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kung|first=James Kai-Sing|last2=Chen|first2=Shuo|date=February 2011|title=The Tragedy of the Nomenklatura: Career Incentives and Political Radicalism during China's Great Leap Famine|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=105|issue=1|pages=27\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0003055410000626|issn=1537-5943}}</ref>\n\n==== Agricultural techniques ====\nAlong with [[collectivization]], the central government decreed several changes in agricultural techniques that would be based on the [[Lysenkoism|ideas]] of later-discredited Russian agronomist [[Trofim Lysenko]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The People's Republic of China, 1949\u201376|edition=second|first=Michael|last=Lynch|location=London|publisher=Hodder Education|year=2008|page=57}}</ref> One of these ideas was close planting, whereby the density of seedlings was at first tripled and then doubled again. The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague [[Terentiy Maltsev]], who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow extremely deeply into the soil (1 to 2 meters). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deep would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pest Campaign ====\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n<br />\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\n{{Confusing|section|date=May 2019}}The Party began to export excessive amounts of grain from regions in 1957 under the Great Leap Forward.

Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L. Yang|title=Calamity and Reform in China: State, Rural Society, and Institutional Change Since the Great Leap Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmLuoAkMKrkC|year=1996|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-3470-7|page=65}}</ref> <blockquote>First, it led to planners to shift lands from grain to economic crops, such as cotton, sugarcane, and beets, and divert huge numbers agricultural laborers into industrial sectors, fueling state demand for procured grain from the countryside. Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== More policies from central goverment ===\nGovernment policies that were implemented, particularly the [[Three Red Banners]] and the [[Socialist Education Movement]] (SEM), proved to be ideologically detrimental to the increasing famine.  The Three Red Banners of the CCP \"sparked the fanaticism of 1958\"  and the implementation of the General Line, one of the three banners which told people to, \"go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, better, and more economical results\" directly links to the pressures officials felt when reporting a superabundance of grain.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=87}}</ref> The SEM, established in 1957, also led to the severity of the famine in many ways, including the illusion of superabundance. Once the exaggerations of crop yields from the [[Mass line|General Line]] were reported, \"no one dared to 'dash cold water'\" on further reports.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=99}}</ref> The SEM also led to the establishment of conspiratory thoughts in which the peasants were believed to be pretending to be hungry in order to sabotage the state grain purchase.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=127|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\n=== Power relations in local government ===\n[[File:1957 Mao Zedong on airplane.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|[[Mao Zedong]] on an airplane, 1957]]\n\nLocal governments had just as much, if not more, influence on the famine than did agriculture and higher forms of government. As the Great Leap Forward progressed, many provincial leaders began to extend their reach by working closely with Mao and higher Party leaders; which, in turn resulted in these provincial leaders abusing power that they did not actually have.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L.

This hatred led to peasants becoming unable to openly speak on collectivization and state grain purchase. By enforcing such passivity at a local level while there already was passivity at an official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=110|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi. Anhui, having a radical pro-Mao government, was led by [[Zeng Xisheng]] who was \"dictatorial\" with ties to Mao.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=212\u2013213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref> Zeng firmly believed in the Great Leap Forward and tried to hold relationships with higher officials rather than keep close local ties. Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded that much of the severity of the famine came down to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=216\u2013218|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\n=== Natural disasters ===\nIn 1960, at least some degree of drought and other bad weather affected 55% of cultivated land, while an estimated 60% of agricultural land in northern China received no rain at all.<ref name=\"Atimes\">{{cite news|last=Liu|first=Henry C K|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FD01Ad04.html|title=Part 2: The Great Leap Forward not all bad|date=1 April 2004|work=[[Asia Times]] online|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204085928/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FD01Ad04.html|archive-date=4 February 2005}}</ref> The [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] yearbooks from 1958 to 1962 also reported abnormal weather, followed by droughts and floods based on Chinese government sources.

But the numbers were faked, and so were the fields that Mao observed, which had been carefully prepared in advance of Mao's visit by local officials, who removed shoots of grain from various fields and carefully transplanted them into a field prepared especially for Mao, which appeared to be a bumper crop.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nThe local officials became trapped by these sham demonstrations to Mao, and exhorted the peasants to reach unattainable goals, by \"deep ploughing and close planting\", and other techniques. This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields. No one was in a position to challenge Mao's ideas as incorrect, so peasants pulled out their bedding and coats into the fields, added seeds and water, and after they sprouted, buried the materials under the soil once the seedlings were high enough.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nIn a similar manner to the massive Soviet-created famine in Ukraine (the [[Holodomor]]), doctors were prohibited from listing \"starvation\" as a cause of death on death certificates. This kind of deception was far from uncommon; a famous [[propaganda]] picture from the famine shows Chinese children from [[Shandong]] province ostensibly standing atop a field of wheat, so densely grown that it could apparently support their weight. In reality, they were standing on a bench concealed beneath the plants, and the \"field\" was again entirely composed of individually transplanted stalks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNEdojrsMo|title=Mao's Great Famine|last=International School History|date=21 January 2015|accessdate=19 September 2018|via=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030033514/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNEdojrsMo|archive-date=30 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>[http://www.disasterhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Standing-on-Grain-Propaganda-1959.jpg Aforementioned propaganda photo. ]\n\n=== Reflections ===\nIn 1962, [[Liu Shaoqi]], then [[President of the People's Republic of China]], concluded after 44 days of field research in villages of [[Hunan]] that the reasons for the famine were 30% natural disaster and 70% human error.<ref>[http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/64172/85037/85039/5898093.html \u5218\u5c11\u5947\"\u4e09\u5206\u5929\u707e\uff0c\u4e03\u5206\u4eba\u7978\"\u63d0\u6cd5\u7684\u7531\u6765] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214040606/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/64172/85037/85039/5898093.html |date=14 December 2012 }}, Selection of the Party History (\u515a\u53f2\u535a\u91c7), 22 June 2007, Accessed Sept 1, 2018, CPC News. {{in lang|zh-Hans}}</ref>\n\n[[Amartya Sen]] puts this famine in a global context, arguing that lack of democracy is the major culprit: \"Indeed, no substantial famine has ever occurred in a democratic country\u2014no matter how poor.\" He adds that it is \"hard to imagine that anything like this could have happened in a country that goes to the polls regularly and that has an independent press.
