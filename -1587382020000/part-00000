The principal reasons behind the acquisition were to reduce Tata's dependence on the Indian commercial vehicle market (which was responsible for around 94% of its sales in the MHCV segment and around 84% in the light commercial vehicle segment) and expand its product portfolio by leveraging on Daewoo's strengths in the heavy-tonnage sector.\n\nTata Motors has jointly worked with Tata Daewoo to develop trucks such as Novus and World Truck and buses including GloBus and StarBus.

The ''Honda Clio'' dealership chain was being positioned as Honda's purveyor of luxuriously equipped vehicles like the [[Honda Legend]], the [[Honda Concerto]], and the [[Honda Accord]], and this generation City enabled ''Clio'' locations to sell economically priced vehicles normally found at ''Honda Primo''.\n\nIn this remodel, there are major changes in the appearance of the vehicle Honda called \"Crouching form\", which consisted of a low and wide design that contributed to lighter vehicle weight (basic grade 680&nbsp;kg) combined with improvements in driving performance. The styling reflects a corporate decision to enact a shared appearance with the first generation [[Honda Today]] ''[[kei car]]'', the internationally strong seller, third generation [[subcompact]] [[Honda Civic (third generation)|Honda Civic]], and the third generation [[compact (car)|compact]] [[Honda Accord#Accord AeroDeck|Honda Accord AeroDeck]]. This generation shared its exterior dimensions and engine size almost exactly with the first generation Civic. The [[Honda CR-X]] was the only three-door hatchback that adopted a fastback, sloping rear hatch, similar to the ''Honda Verno'' products during the mid-1980s.\n\nThe engine configuration introduced the Honda D series, in the form of the type D12A, a 1.2&nbsp;L SOHC straight-four 16-valve unit (1986, first as a mechanism for domestic vehicles) only available with a single carburetor, and basic level of equipment. The difference between the \"GG\" / \"EE\" / \"BB\" were just in the level of equipment. Power is {{convert|76|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,500&nbsp;rpm. A five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission were optional.<ref name=\"AR87\"/>\n\nIn October 1988 the main engine was changed to 1.3&nbsp;L I4 SOHC type D13C. At this time, in addition to the traditional single carburetor, and introduced Honda's PGM-FI fuel injection. Single carburetor specification, the 1.2&nbsp;L \"BE\" the other 1.3&nbsp;L \"CE\" / \"CG\" is set, PGM-FI, spec, \"CR-i\" / \"CZ-i\" and consists of two trim packages.\n\nThe \"CE\" grade equipment with enhanced savings \"CE Fit\", PGM-FI specification is \"CR-i\" based only high-grade \"CR-i Limited\" was introduced, the late \"CZ-i\" is defined as the minor trim package. The word \"Fit\" appears as a trim package on the base grade \"CE\".\n\nAt the end of this generation, by grade consolidation, \"Fit\"  is used for all single carburetor vehicles. The trim package \"Fit\" later became the model name of the successor of the Honda Logo which replaced this car.\n\nThe second generation was discontinued in 1993. In Japan, the name \"City\" was retired at the end of this series' conclusion of production. The replacement vehicles introduced in 1996 on the GA base were renamed \"[[Honda Logo]]\" (three-door hatchback, GA3/5 series), and the [[Honda Capa]] with five-door hatchback bodywork.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=={{Anchor|Third generation|3A2|3A3}}Third generation (1995\u20132002)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Third generation (3A2/3A3)\n| image = Honda City (third generation) (front), Kajang.jpg\n| aka = Honda City Type Z (1999)\n| production = 1996\u20132002\n| assembly = Japan: [[Suzuka, Mie|Suzuka]], [[Mie Prefecture|Mie]]<br />Thailand: [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]]<br /> Philippines: [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]]\n| designer = \n| body_style = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n| platform = 3A2/3A3\n| related = [[Honda Civic (fourth generation)]]<br />\n| engine = 1.3&nbsp;L ''[[Honda D engine#D13|D13B]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />1.5&nbsp;L ''[[Honda D engine#D15|D15B]]'' I4<br />1.5&nbsp;L ''[[Honda D engine#D15|D15B]]'' [[VTEC]] I4\n| transmission = 5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4225|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1690|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1395|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|940|-|985|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| sp = us\n}}\n\n[[File:Honda City (third generation) (rear), Kajang.jpg|thumb|left|Third generation Honda City, pre-facelift ([[Malaysia]]/Southeast Asia)]]\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 220\n| image1 = Honda City (third generation, first facelift) (front), Serdang.jpg\n| image2 = Honda City (third generation, first facelift) (rear), Serdang.jpg\n| caption2 = Third generation Honda City, post-facelift, Type-Z (Malaysia/Southeast Asia)\n}}\n\nHonda positioned the City as a subcompact four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], slotting beneath the [[Honda Civic]], for developing markets in Asia.

The fifth generation Honda City diesel cars were manufactured very few and in hundreds and were given to some selected dealers in only some states of India. The fifth generation Honda City Diesel was available on demand through the selected dealers and was launched in the starting days of January 2014, only a few days before the sixth generation Honda City launch in India.\n\nHonda Atlas (Pakistan) resumed the production of Honda City on May 1, 2012 after it was halted due to supply chain disruption caused by massive flooding in Thailand. This resumption of production is marked by Honda as it comes with the range of facelifted Honda City under the banner of Honda City Aspire. In October 2014, Honda Atlas launched the facelifted Honda City, with new features including new taillights, revamped chrome grille, blinkers on side mirrors, rear window brake light, keyless entry system and new bumpers. The interior also received some changes. The speedometer dials were changed from orange to blue optitron. This generation of Honda City still remains in production in Pakistan with minor facelifts and feature updates with no sign of launching the newer generation. There is a chance that Honda may skip the sixth generation of City in Pakistan or launch it after the launch of the seventh generation in other markets.\n\n===Production===\n[[File:Honda City, 5th Generation, Pakistan, Dec 2013.jpg|thumb|right|Interior]]\nThe Honda City is produced in a number of locations around the world including India, Pakistan, Philippines and Thailand.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manufacturing Facilities|url=http://world.honda.com/group/manufacturing-facilities/Asiaoceania/|work=Honda|accessdate=2012-03-27|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024232240/http://world.honda.com/group/manufacturing-facilities/Asiaoceania/|archivedate=2012-10-24}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2009, the City was for the first time to be built and marketed (in large numbers) outside Asia, with production commenced in Sumar\u00e9, Brazil.

The ''Honda Clio'' dealership chain was being positioned as Honda's purveyor of luxuriously equipped vehicles like the [[Honda Legend]], the [[Honda Concerto]], and the [[Honda Accord]], and this generation City enabled ''Clio'' locations to sell economically priced vehicles normally found at ''Honda Primo''.\n\nIn this remodel, there are major changes in the appearance of the vehicle Honda called \"Crouching form\", which consisted of a low and wide design that contributed to lighter vehicle weight (basic grade 680&nbsp;kg) combined with improvements in driving performance. The styling reflects a corporate decision to enact a shared appearance with the first generation [[Honda Today]] ''[[kei car]]'', the internationally strong seller, third generation [[subcompact]] [[Honda Civic (third generation)|Honda Civic]], and the third generation [[compact (car)|compact]] [[Honda Accord#Accord AeroDeck|Honda Accord AeroDeck]]. This generation shared its exterior dimensions and engine size almost exactly with the first generation Civic. The [[Honda CR-X]] was the only three-door hatchback that adopted a fastback, sloping rear hatch, similar to the ''Honda Verno'' products during the mid-1980s.\n\nThe engine configuration introduced the Honda D series, in the form of the type D12A, a 1.2&nbsp;L SOHC straight-four 16-valve unit (1986, first as a mechanism for domestic vehicles) only available with a single carburetor, and basic level of equipment. The difference between the \"GG\" / \"EE\" / \"BB\" were just in the level of equipment. Power is {{convert|76|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,500&nbsp;rpm. A five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission were optional.<ref name=\"AR87\"/>\n\nIn October 1988 the main engine was changed to 1.3&nbsp;L I4 SOHC type D13C. At this time, in addition to the traditional single carburetor, and introduced Honda's PGM-FI fuel injection. Single carburetor specification, the 1.2&nbsp;L \"BE\" the other 1.3&nbsp;L \"CE\" / \"CG\" is set, PGM-FI, spec, \"CR-i\" / \"CZ-i\" and consists of two trim packages.\n\nThe \"CE\" grade equipment with enhanced savings \"CE Fit\", PGM-FI specification is \"CR-i\" based only high-grade \"CR-i Limited\" was introduced, the late \"CZ-i\" is defined as the minor trim package. The word \"Fit\" appears as a trim package on the base grade \"CE\".\n\nAt the end of this generation, by grade consolidation, \"Fit\"  is used for all single carburetor vehicles. The trim package \"Fit\" later became the model name of the successor of the Honda Logo which replaced this car.\n\nThe second generation was discontinued in 1993. In Japan, the name \"City\" was retired at the end of this series' conclusion of production. The replacement vehicles introduced in 1996 on the GA base were renamed \"[[Honda Logo]]\" (three-door hatchback, GA3/5 series), and the [[Honda Capa]] with five-door hatchback bodywork.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=={{Anchor|Third generation|3A2|3A3}}Third generation (1995\u20132002)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Third generation (3A2/3A3)\n| image = Honda City (third generation) (front), Kajang.jpg\n| aka = Honda City Type Z (1999)\n| production = 1996\u20132002\n| assembly = Japan: [[Suzuka, Mie|Suzuka]], [[Mie Prefecture|Mie]]<br />Thailand: [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]]<br /> Philippines: [[Santa Rosa, Laguna|Santa Rosa]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]]\n| designer = \n| body_style = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| layout = [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n| platform = 3A2/3A3\n| related = [[Honda Civic (fourth generation)]]<br />\n| engine = 1.3&nbsp;L ''[[Honda D engine#D13|D13B]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]<br />1.5&nbsp;L ''[[Honda D engine#D15|D15B]]'' I4<br />1.5&nbsp;L ''[[Honda D engine#D15|D15B]]'' [[VTEC]] I4\n| transmission = 5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4225|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1690|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1395|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|940|-|985|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}\n| sp = us\n}}\n\n[[File:Honda City (third generation) (rear), Kajang.jpg|thumb|left|Third generation Honda City, pre-facelift ([[Malaysia]]/Southeast Asia)]]\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = vertical\n| width = 220\n| image1 = Honda City (third generation, first facelift) (front), Serdang.jpg\n| image2 = Honda City (third generation, first facelift) (rear), Serdang.jpg\n| caption2 = Third generation Honda City, post-facelift, Type-Z (Malaysia/Southeast Asia)\n}}\n\nHonda positioned the City as a subcompact four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]], slotting beneath the [[Honda Civic]], for developing markets in Asia.

It can be delivered through vaginal brachytherapy (VBT), which is becoming the preferred route due to its reduced toxicity, or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). [[Brachytherapy]] involves placing a radiation source in the organ affected; in the case of endometrial cancer a radiation source is placed directly in the vagina. External beam radiotherapy involves a beam of radiation aimed at the affected area from outside the body. VBT is used to treat any remaining cancer solely in the vagina, whereas EBRT can be used to treat remaining cancer elsewhere in the pelvis following surgery. However, the benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy are controversial. Though EBRT significantly reduces the rate of relapse in the pelvis, overall survival and metastasis rates are not improved.<ref name=Cochrane0412/> VBT provides a better quality of life than EBRT.<ref name=Colombo/>\n\nRadiotherapy can also be used before surgery in certain cases. When pre-operative imaging or clinical evaluation shows tumor invading the cervix, radiation can be given before a [[radical hysterectomy|total hysterectomy]] is performed.<ref name=CurrentSurgery/> Brachytherapy and EBRT can also be used, singly or in combination, when there is a contraindication for hysterectomy.<ref name=Colombo/> Both delivery methods of radiotherapy are associated with side effects, particularly in the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]].<ref name=Cochrane0412/>\n\n====Hormonal therapy====\nHormonal therapy is only beneficial in certain types of endometrial cancer. It was once thought to be beneficial in most cases.<ref name=Cochrane0412/><ref name=\"Cochrane05142\"/> If a tumor is well-differentiated and known to have progesterone and estrogen receptors, progestins may be used in treatment.<ref name=ComprehensiveGyn27/> There is no evidence to support the use of progestagen in addition to surgery for newly diagnosed endometrial cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin-Hirsch PP, Bryant A, Keep SL, Kitchener HC, Lilford R | title = Adjuvant progestagens for endometrial cancer | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 6 | pages = CD001040 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21678331 | pmc = 4238061 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd001040.pub2 }}</ref> About 25% of metastatic endometrioid cancers show a response to progestins.

It can be delivered through vaginal brachytherapy (VBT), which is becoming the preferred route due to its reduced toxicity, or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). [[Brachytherapy]] involves placing a radiation source in the organ affected; in the case of endometrial cancer a radiation source is placed directly in the vagina. External beam radiotherapy involves a beam of radiation aimed at the affected area from outside the body. VBT is used to treat any remaining cancer solely in the vagina, whereas EBRT can be used to treat remaining cancer elsewhere in the pelvis following surgery. However, the benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy are controversial. Though EBRT significantly reduces the rate of relapse in the pelvis, overall survival and metastasis rates are not improved.<ref name=Cochrane0412/> VBT provides a better quality of life than EBRT.<ref name=Colombo/>\n\nRadiotherapy can also be used before surgery in certain cases. When pre-operative imaging or clinical evaluation shows tumor invading the cervix, radiation can be given before a [[radical hysterectomy|total hysterectomy]] is performed.<ref name=CurrentSurgery/> Brachytherapy and EBRT can also be used, singly or in combination, when there is a contraindication for hysterectomy.<ref name=Colombo/> Both delivery methods of radiotherapy are associated with side effects, particularly in the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]].<ref name=Cochrane0412/>\n\n====Hormonal therapy====\nHormonal therapy is only beneficial in certain types of endometrial cancer. It was once thought to be beneficial in most cases.<ref name=Cochrane0412/><ref name=\"Cochrane05142\"/> If a tumor is well-differentiated and known to have progesterone and estrogen receptors, progestins may be used in treatment.<ref name=ComprehensiveGyn27/> There is no evidence to support the use of progestagen in addition to surgery for newly diagnosed endometrial cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin-Hirsch PP, Bryant A, Keep SL, Kitchener HC, Lilford R | title = Adjuvant progestagens for endometrial cancer | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 6 | pages = CD001040 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21678331 | pmc = 4238061 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd001040.pub2 }}</ref> About 25% of metastatic endometrioid cancers show a response to progestins.

At the $151.08 ask price point, there are 3900 shares available (2800 by the ARCA Market Maker and 1100 by the [[BATS Global Markets|BATS]] Market Maker).  This is typically represented in quote form as:  $151.07 X 300 by $151.08 X 3900).<br/>\n<br/>\nTo properly understand slippage, let's use the following example:  Say, you (as a trader) wanted to purchase 20,000 shares of SPY right now.  The problem here is that the current ASK price of $151.08 only contains 3900 shares being offered for sale, but you want to purchase 20,000 shares.  If you need to purchase those shares now, then you must use a market order and you will incur slippage by doing so.  Using a market order to purchase your 20,000 shares would yield the following executions (assuming no hidden orders in the market depth):\n\nBuy 2800 @ $151.08<br/>\nBuy 1100 @ $151.08<br/>\nBuy 3800 @ $151.09<br/>\nBuy  900 @ $151.10<br/>\nBuy 3700 @ $151.11<br/>\nBuy 1200 @ $151.12<br/>\nBuy 3700 @ $151.13<br/>\nBuy  200 @ $151.14<br/>\nBuy 1000 @ $151.15<br/>\nBuy  400 @ $151.18<br/>\nBuy  100 @ $151.22<br/>\nBuy  600 @ $151.24<br/>\nBuy  500 @ $151.25 (only 500 shares out of the 2000 being offered at this price point are executed, because this will represent our entire 20,000 share order).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe average purchase price of the above execution is:  $151.11585.  The difference between the current ASK price ($151.08) and your average purchase price ($151.11585) represents your slippage.  In this case, the cost of slippage would be calculated as follows: 20,000 X $151.08 - 20,000 X $151.11585 = $-717.00\n\n==Reverse Slippage==\nReverse slippage as described by Taleb occurs when the purchase of a large position is done at increasing prices, so that the [[mark to market]] value of the position increases. The danger occurs when the trader attempts to exit his position. If the trader manages to create a squeeze large enough then this phenomenon can be profitable.

Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 N-type calcium ion channels are linked to pain.<ref name=\":2\" /> Research in pain is important because chronic pain is a very current therapeutic issue that has poor treatment options that are not very effective and have serious harmful side effects. In order to understand the voltage gated calcium channel sub-types, Lipscombe works on various channel inhibitors that specifically target the inhibitor essential in decreasing pain. Looking into alternative splicing and how it contributed to pain in these channels was also important.\n\nLipscombe has studied [[synaptic plasticity]], which is how well or strongly the synapse is working. A [[synapse]] is where two neurons come together and have neurotransmitters passing from one to another. Through her studies, she has been able to examine how different adhesion molecules may be inhibiting or exciting the release of neurotransmitters. This can be caused by the binding of adhesion molecules to calcium channels. A particular study she worked on focused on neuromuscular junctions, which are between a neuron and muscle tissue, in nematodes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Haiwen|last2=Tang|first2=Ai-Hui|last3=Blanpied|first3=Thomas A|date=2018-08-01|title=Subsynaptic spatial organization as a regulator of synaptic strength and plasticity|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438818300369|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|series=Cellular Neuroscience|language=en|volume=51|pages=147\u2013153|doi=10.1016/j.conb.2018.05.004|issn=0959-4388|pmc=6295321|pmid=29902592}}</ref>\n\nCalcium channels are crucial to whether or not there is [[neurotransmitter]] release. The alteration of neurons and their functions have been found to lead to neurodevelopmental disorders/diseases. Lipscombe has studied the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter release through coupling methods. Coupling method occurs when two things come together to form a common intermediate that will serve another purpose. This intermediate will either inhibit a function or excite something to carry out a function. This excitatory response found in Lipscombe\u2019s studies allow calcium channels to open and neurotransmitters to be released again. The deletion of certain genes will determine whether neurotransmitters will be released.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Avazzadeh|first=Sahar|last2=McDonagh|first2=Katya|last3=Reilly|first3=Jamie|last4=Wang|first4=Yanqin|last5=Boomkamp|first5=Stephanie D.|last6=McInerney|first6=Veronica|last7=Krawczyk|first7=Janusz|last8=Fitzgerald|first8=Jacqueline|last9=Feerick|first9=Niamh|last10=O\u2019Sullivan|first10=Matthew|last11=Jalali|first11=Amirhossein|date=December 2019|title=Increased Ca2+ signaling in NRXN1\u03b1+/\u2212 neurons derived from ASD induced pluripotent stem cells|journal=Molecular Autism|volume=10|issue=1|pages=52|doi=10.1186/s13229-019-0303-3|issn=2040-2392|pmc=6937972|pmid=31893021}}</ref>\n\n== Current research ==\nCurrently, Lipscombe is also working on a project that looks at the neurodegenerative disease, [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) and its origin and underlying cellular defects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Held|first=Aaron|last2=Major|first2=Paxton|last3=Sahin|first3=Asli|last4=Reenan|first4=Robert A.|last5=Lipscombe|first5=Diane|last6=Wharton|first6=Kristi A.|date=2019-03-20|title=Circuit Dysfunction in SOD1-ALS Model First Detected in Sensory Feedback Prior to Motor Neuron Degeneration Is Alleviated by BMP Signaling|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|volume=39|issue=12|pages=2347\u20132364|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1771-18.2019|issn=0270-6474|pmc=6433758|pmid=30659087}}</ref> They used fruit flies in their lab, which is an ideal specimen for looking at this disease.

She has spent time studying [[alternative splicing]] variants of different channels, and how variants cause varied biophysical properties and expression in the tissue.<ref name=\":3\" /> An example of a biophysical property of calcium channels include if the channel is fast or slow when the channel uses voltage gated inactivation or activation.<ref>{{Citation|last=An|first=Mary T.|chapter=Voltage-Dependent Inactivation of Voltage Gated Calcium Channels|pages=194\u2013204|publisher=Springer US|isbn=978-0-306-47840-6|last2=Zamponi|first2=Gerald W.|title=Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels|series=Molecular Biology Intelligence Unit|year=2005|doi=10.1007/0-387-27526-6_12}}</ref> \n\nCa<sub>V</sub>s are made up of multiple subunits and have many genes that code for them. Dr. Lipscombe has studied the many different subunits of calcium channels, an example of one of these calcium channels is the Ca<sub>V</sub> 3.3. There are variations of these genes that she studies which are associated with patients with [[schizophrenia]].<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Andrade|first=Arturo|last2=Brennecke|first2=Ashton|last3=Mallat|first3=Shayna|last4=Brown|first4=Julian|last5=Gomez-Rivadeneira|first5=Juan|last6=Czepiel|first6=Natalie|last7=Londrigan|first7=Laura|date=2019-07-19|title=Genetic Associations between Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels and Psychiatric Disorders|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=20|issue=14|pages=3537|doi=10.3390/ijms20143537|issn=1422-0067|pmc=6679227|pmid=31331039}}</ref> Her studies show that a specific mutation called R1346H lessens the calcium current.[[File:General L-type calcium channel.jpg|thumb|L-type calcium channel]]Lipscombe is also interested in pain, and how pain is affected by Ca<sub>V</sub>s.

Lipscombe is currently researching cell mechanisms and how they affect calcium voltage channels when normal functioning is occurring, as well as when normal function is not occurring. Ca<sub>V</sub>2.2 N-type calcium ion channels are linked to pain.<ref name=\":2\" /> Research in pain is important because chronic pain is a very current therapeutic issue that has poor treatment options that are not very effective and have serious harmful side effects. In order to understand the voltage gated calcium channel sub-types, Lipscombe works on various channel inhibitors that specifically target the inhibitor essential in decreasing pain. Looking into alternative splicing and how it contributed to pain in these channels was also important.\n\nLipscombe has studied [[synaptic plasticity]], which is how well or strongly the synapse is working. A [[synapse]] is where two neurons come together and have neurotransmitters passing from one to another. Through her studies, she has been able to examine how different adhesion molecules may be inhibiting or exciting the release of neurotransmitters. This can be caused by the binding of adhesion molecules to calcium channels. A particular study she worked on focused on neuromuscular junctions, which are between a neuron and muscle tissue, in nematodes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Haiwen|last2=Tang|first2=Ai-Hui|last3=Blanpied|first3=Thomas A|date=2018-08-01|title=Subsynaptic spatial organization as a regulator of synaptic strength and plasticity|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959438818300369|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|series=Cellular Neuroscience|language=en|volume=51|pages=147\u2013153|doi=10.1016/j.conb.2018.05.004|issn=0959-4388|pmc=PMC6295321|pmid=29902592}}</ref>\n\nCalcium channels are crucial to whether or not there is [[neurotransmitter]] release. The alteration of neurons and their functions have been found to lead to neurodevelopmental disorders/diseases. Lipscombe has studied the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter release through coupling methods. Coupling method occurs when two things come together to form a common intermediate that will serve another purpose. This intermediate will either inhibit a function or excite something to carry out a function. This excitatory response found in Lipscombe\u2019s studies allow calcium channels to open and neurotransmitters to be released again. The deletion of certain genes will determine whether neurotransmitters will be released.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Avazzadeh|first=Sahar|last2=McDonagh|first2=Katya|last3=Reilly|first3=Jamie|last4=Wang|first4=Yanqin|last5=Boomkamp|first5=Stephanie D.|last6=McInerney|first6=Veronica|last7=Krawczyk|first7=Janusz|last8=Fitzgerald|first8=Jacqueline|last9=Feerick|first9=Niamh|last10=O\u2019Sullivan|first10=Matthew|last11=Jalali|first11=Amirhossein|date=December 2019|title=Increased Ca2+ signaling in NRXN1\u03b1+/\u2212 neurons derived from ASD induced pluripotent stem cells|journal=Molecular Autism|volume=10|issue=1|pages=52|doi=10.1186/s13229-019-0303-3|issn=2040-2392|pmc=6937972|pmid=31893021}}</ref>\n\n== Current research ==\nCurrently, Lipscombe is also working on a project that looks at the neurodegenerative disease, [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) and its origin and underlying cellular defects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Held|first=Aaron|last2=Major|first2=Paxton|last3=Sahin|first3=Asli|last4=Reenan|first4=Robert A.|last5=Lipscombe|first5=Diane|last6=Wharton|first6=Kristi A.|date=2019-03-20|title=Circuit Dysfunction in SOD1-ALS Model First Detected in Sensory Feedback Prior to Motor Neuron Degeneration Is Alleviated by BMP Signaling|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|volume=39|issue=12|pages=2347\u20132364|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1771-18.2019|issn=0270-6474|pmc=6433758|pmid=30659087}}</ref> They used fruit flies in their lab, which is an ideal specimen for looking at this disease.

Alison decided to keep Phoenix a secret from Chris and the two lived in America. After Alison grew sick of the American schooling system, she and Phoenix travelled to New Zealand and lived on a farm. In November 2009 Alison died on a yacht and Phoenix was taken in by her uncle [[Brian Raynor|Brian]] ([[Ian Mune]]).\n\nChris learnt in August 2010 that Phoenix was his son and, after a DNA test, he adopted him. Phoenix struggled to get on with half brother [[Harry Warner (Shortland Street)|Harry]] ([[Reid Walker]]) but befriended [[Evan Cooper (character)|Evan Cooper]] (Tyler Read). New girl [[Ula Levi]] (Frankie Adams) spread a rumour that he was gay after he rebuffed a kiss from her but the two later dated briefly in 2011. He dumped her for Evan's sister [[Jasmine Cooper|Jasmine]] (Pearl McGlashan) but cheated on Jasmine when he had a one-night stand with [[Suzy McRae|Suzy]] (Maisey McSwiney). Phoenix was shocked when Jasmine died for several minutes on his lap due to her [[Long QT syndrome]] and later struggled to cope with her newfound morbid personality causing the two to break up numerous times. Phoenix ultimately ended the relationship when he developed an unrequited crush on [[List of Shortland Street characters (2012)#Megan Reynolds|Megan]] (Lira Edwards). Phoenix was shocked when Chris was arrested for the murder of his school tutor, [[Hayley O'Neill]] (Michelle Blundell) and struggled to accept his protest of innocence. However he ended up freeing his father when Hayley's true killer [[Drew Webster (Shortland Street)|Drew]] (Joel Herbert) kidnapped him and confessed. In 2013 Phoenix began to date popular schoolgirl [[List of Shortland Street characters (2013)#Britney Buchanan|Britney Buchanan]] (Eliza McKay) but the two broke up after meddling from new girl, [[Dayna Jenkins]] (Lucy Elliott). Phoenix soon turned against his family lifestyle and took up street art to express his true beliefs. This however lead to near legal trouble and in November, Phoenix decided to leave Ferndale to study at a Berlin university for art. Only a month after his departure, Chris revealed that Phoenix had dropped out of the school and had taken to traveling the world. In 2014, Chris stated that Phoenix would not be returning for his wedding but would rather attend via video chat.\n\nPhoenix unexpectedly returned to Ferndale 6 years after his departure and shocked Chris by introducing his heavily pregnant girlfriend [[Tess Hutchison (Shortland Street)|Tess]] (Becky McEwen). Chris soon realised that Phoenix had struggled in Berlin as an artist and was owing significant amounts of money. He hired him as an office administrator much to Phoenix's angst. Tess and Phoenix newborn daughter was born on 2019 season finale they decided to name her Ameila Warner.\n\nAt the beginning of 2020, after being talked down by a returning [[Frank Warner (Shortland Street)|Frank Warner]] from leaving Amelia and Tess on the lurch, he decided to put his $10,000 gift from Chris to become an investor for an art gallery in New Zealand, in exchange for a feature exhibition spot. The money was supposed to be the payment for prams, nappies and a modest family car. Despite Franks' displeasure, he was still glad that Phoenix was trying to further his career (even when the investment is rather risky), rather than turning into crime like drugs and gangs, hence Frank didn't turn him in to Tess or Chris.\n\nIn February, after a failure with the art gallery, Phoenix takes $1,000,000 from the hospital and when he confesses to Tess, he wants to make a runner with Tess and his baby. Tess calms him and tells him to stay in Ferndale but he makes a runner and was reported to be in Santiago, Chile last\n\n==Character development==\n===Characterisation===\nPhoenix was initially portrayed as a teenager who although often landed himself in bad situations, was friendly and welcoming to all those he interacted with.<ref name=mathstutor/> He earned the title \"Mr Nice Guy\" however a storyline in 2012 that revolved around Phoenix developing a crush on his psychopathic maths tutor [[Hayley O'Neill]] (Michelle Blundell), saw the characterization of the character develop drastically differently.

There are several \u2013 often contradictory and sometimes unreliable \u2013 Janams\u0101kh\u012bs and they are not held in the same regard as other sources of scriptural knowledge.\n\n==Observances==\n[[File:InsideSikhGurdwara.jpg|thumb|The [[Darbar Sahib Hall|Darbar Sahib]] of a [[Gurdwara]]]]\nObservant Sikhs adhere to long-standing practices and traditions to strengthen and express their faith. The daily recitation of the divine name of God Vaheguru and from memory of specific passages from the Gur\u016b Granth S\u0101hib, like the ''Japu'' (or ''Japj\u012b'', literally ''chant'') hymns is recommended immediately after rising and bathing. Baptized Sikhs recite the five morning prayers, the evening and night prayer. Family customs include both reading passages from the scripture and attending the [[gurudwara|gurdwara]] (also ''gurdu\u0101r\u0101'', meaning ''the doorway to God''; sometimes transliterated as ''gurudwara''). There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, as well as in almost every nation where Sikhs reside. Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste, or race.\n\nWorship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of singing of passages from the scripture. Sikhs will commonly enter the gurdwara, touch the ground before the holy scripture with their foreheads. The recitation of the eighteenth century ''[[ard\u0101s]]'' is also customary for attending Sikhs. The ard\u0101s recalls past sufferings and glories of the community, invoking divine grace for all humanity.<ref name=\"p260\">{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|year=1971|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=United States|isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|page=260}}</ref>\n\nThe gurdwara is also the location for the historic Sikh practice of \"[[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]]\" or the community meal.

This reprisals on Sikhs were not one sided, because as Sikhs entered the Indian side, the Muslims in East Punjab experienced reprisals and they moved to West Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\"/> Before the partition, Sikhs constituted about 15% of the population in West Punjab that became a part of Pakistan, the majority being Muslims (55%).

The Muslim League rejected this approach, demanding that entire Punjab should be granted to Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}} The Sikh leaders then sought the partition instead, and Congress Working Committee passed a resolution in support of partitioning Punjab and Bengal.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}}\n[[File:Sikh Light Infantry.jpg|thumb|[[Sikh Light Infantry]] personnel march past during the Republic day parade in [[New Delhi]], India]]\n\nBetween March and August 1947, a series of riots, arson, plunder of Sikh property, assassination of Sikh leaders, and killings in Jhelum districts, Rawalpindi, Attock and other places made Tara Singh call the situation in Punjab as \"civil war\", while [[Lord Mountbatten]] stated \"civil war preparations were going on\".

The daily recitation of the divine name of God Vaheguru and from memory of specific passages from the Gur\u016b Granth S\u0101hib, like the ''Japu'' (or ''Japj\u012b'', literally ''chant'') hymns is recommended immediately after rising and bathing. Baptized Sikhs recite the five morning prayers, the evening and night prayer. Family customs include both reading passages from the scripture and attending the [[gurudwara|gurdwara]] (also ''gurdu\u0101r\u0101'', meaning ''the doorway to God''; sometimes transliterated as ''gurudwara''). There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, as well as in almost every nation where Sikhs reside. Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste, or race.\n\nWorship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of singing of passages from the scripture. Sikhs will commonly enter the gurdwara, touch the ground before the holy scripture with their foreheads. The recitation of the eighteenth century ''[[ard\u0101s]]'' is also customary for attending Sikhs. The ard\u0101s recalls past sufferings and glories of the community, invoking divine grace for all humanity.<ref name=\"p260\">{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|year=1971|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=United States|isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|page=260}}</ref>\n\nThe gurdwara is also the location for the historic Sikh practice of \"[[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]]\" or the community meal.

Ultimately when the British Empire recognized independent India, the [[partition of India|land was partitioned]] into Hindu majority India and Muslim majority Pakistan (East and West) in 1947. This event, states Banga, was a watershed event in Sikh history.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\">{{cite book|author=Giorgio Shani|title=Sikh Nationalism and Identity in a Global Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKu66SixH6AC |year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-10189-4|pages=86\u201393}}</ref> The Sikhs had historically lived in northwestern region of Indian subcontinent on both sides of the partition line (\"[[Radcliffe Line]]\"). According to Banga and other scholars, the Sikhs had strongly opposed the [[Muslim League]] demands and saw it as \"perpetuation of Muslim domination\" and anti-Sikh policies in what just a 100 years before was a part of the Sikh Empire. During the discussions with the colonial authorities, Tara Singh emerged as an important leader who campaigned to prevent the partition and for the recognition of Sikhs as the third community.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}} In 1940, a few Sikhs such as the victims of [[Komagata Maru incident|Komagata Maru in Canada]] proposed the idea of Khalistan as a buffer state between Pakistan and India.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013103}} These leaders, however, were largely ignored.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\"/> Many other Sikh leaders supported the partition along religious and demographic lines.<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\">{{cite book|author=Michael Mann|title=South Asia's Modern History: Thematic Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TBscBQAAQBAJ |year =2014|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-62446-2|pages=81\u201383}}</ref>\n\nWhen partition was announced, the newly created line divided the Sikh population into two halves. The Sikhs suffered organized violence and riots against them in West Pakistan, and Sikhs moved en masse to the Indian side leaving behind their property and the sacred places of Sikhism. This reprisals on Sikhs were not one sided, because as Sikhs entered the Indian side, the Muslims in East Punjab experienced reprisals and they moved to West Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\"/> Before the partition, Sikhs constituted about 15% of the population in West Punjab that became a part of Pakistan, the majority being Muslims (55%). The Sikhs were the economic elite and wealthiest in West Punjab, with them having the largest representation in West Punjab's aristocracy, nearly 700 Gurdwaras and 400 educational institutions that served the interests of the Sikhs.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013103}} Prior to the partition, there were a series of disputes between the majority Muslims and minority Sikhs, such as on the matters of [[jhatka]] versus [[halal]] meat, the disputed ownership of [[Shaheed Ganj Mosque|Gurdwara Sahidganj]] in Lahore which Muslims sought as a mosque and Sikhs as a Gurdwara, and the insistence of the provincial Muslim government in switching from Indian [[Gurmukhi]] script to Arabic-Persian [[Nastaliq]] script in schools.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}} During and after the [[Simla Conference]] in June 1945, headed by Lord Wavell, the Sikh leaders initially expressed their desire to be recognized as the third party, but ultimately relegated their demands and sought a United India where Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims would live together, under a Swiss style constitution. The Muslim League rejected this approach, demanding that entire Punjab should be granted to Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}} The Sikh leaders then sought the partition instead, and Congress Working Committee passed a resolution in support of partitioning Punjab and Bengal.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}}\n[[File:Sikh Light Infantry.jpg|thumb|[[Sikh Light Infantry]] personnel march past during the Republic day parade in [[New Delhi]], India]]\n\nBetween March and August 1947, a series of riots, arson, plunder of Sikh property, assassination of Sikh leaders, and killings in Jhelum districts, Rawalpindi, Attock and other places made Tara Singh call the situation in Punjab as \"civil war\", while [[Lord Mountbatten]] stated \"civil war preparations were going on\".

He worked briefly as a schoolmaster before he became a full-time writer. As a young man, he acquired many fashionable and aristocratic friends and developed a taste for [[country house]] society. He travelled extensively in the 1930s, often as a special newspaper correspondent; he reported from [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] at the time of the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|1935 Italian invasion]]. He served in the British armed forces throughout the Second World War, first in the [[Royal Marines]] and then in the [[Royal Horse Guards]]. He was a perceptive writer who used the experiences and the wide range of people whom he encountered in his works of fiction, generally to humorous effect. Waugh's detachment was such that he fictionalised his own mental breakdown which occurred in the early 1950s.\n\nWaugh converted to [[Catholicism]] in 1930 after his first marriage failed. His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church, and the changes by the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962\u201365) greatly disturbed his sensibilities, especially the introduction of the vernacular [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]]. That blow to his religious traditionalism, his dislike for the [[welfare state]] culture of the postwar world, and the decline of his health all darkened his final years, but he continued to write. He displayed to the world a mask of indifference, but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered his friends. After his death in 1966, he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial ''[[Brideshead Revisited (TV serial)|Brideshead Revisited]]'' (1981).\n\n==Family background==\n[[File:Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn|Lord Cockburn]], the Scottish judge, was one of Waugh's great-great-grandfathers.]]\nArthur Evelyn St. John Waugh was born on 28 October 1903<ref>Eade, p.

It was presumed by the family that Evelyn would follow, but in 1915, the school asked Evelyn's older brother Alec to leave after a [[homosexual]] relationship came to light. Alec departed Sherborne for military training as an [[Military officer|officer]], and, while awaiting confirmation of his [[Commission (document)|commission]], wrote ''The Loom of Youth'' (1917), a novel of school life, which alluded to homosexual friendships at a school that was recognisably Sherborne.

When Cruttwell advised him to mend his ways, Waugh responded in a manner which, he admitted later, was \"fatuously haughty\";<ref>Waugh, \"A Little Learning\", p. 175</ref> from then on, relations between the two descended into mutual hatred.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 76\u201377</ref> Waugh continued the feud long after his Oxford days by using Cruttwell's name in his early novels for a succession of ludicrous, ignominious or odious minor characters.<ref>Sykes, p. 45</ref>{{refn|\"Cruttwell\" is a brutal burglar in ''Decline and Fall'', a snobbish Member of Parliament in ''Vile Bodies'', a social parasite in ''Black Mischief'', a disreputable osteopath in ''A Handful of Dust'' and a salesman with a fake tan in ''Scoop''.

A letter written that year to a Lancing friend, [[Dudley Carew]], hints at severe emotional pressures: \"I have been living very intensely these last three weeks. For the last fortnight I have been nearly insane.... I may perhaps one day in a later time tell you some of the things that have happened\".<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 12</ref> He did just enough work to pass his final examinations in the summer of 1924 with a third-class. However, as he had begun at Hertford in the second term of the 1921\u201322 academic year, Waugh had completed only eight terms' residence when he sat his finals, rather than the nine required under the university's statutes. His poor results led to the loss of his scholarship, which made it impossible for him to return to Oxford for that final term, so he left without his degree.<ref>Hastings, p. 112</ref>\n\nBack at home,  Waugh began a novel, ''[[The Temple at Thatch]]'', and worked with some of his fellow Hypocrites on a film, ''The Scarlet Woman'', which was shot partly in the gardens at Underhill. He spent much of the rest of the summer in the company of Alastair Graham; after Graham departed for [[Kenya]], Waugh enrolled for the autumn at a London art school, [[Heatherley School of Fine Art|Heatherley's]].<ref name= S93>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 93\u201396</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n\n===Teaching and writing===\n[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], the subject of Waugh's first full-length book (1927)]]\nWaugh began at Heatherley's in late September 1924, but became bored with the routine and quickly abandoned his course.<ref>Waugh, ''A Little Learning'', pp. 210\u201312</ref> He spent weeks partying in London and Oxford before the overriding need for money led him to apply through an agency for a teaching job. Almost at once, he secured a post at Arnold House, a boys' [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]] in [[North Wales]], beginning in January 1925. He took with him the notes for his novel, ''The Temple at Thatch'', intending to work on it in his spare time. Despite the gloomy ambience of the school, Waugh did his best to fulfil the requirements of his position, but a brief return to London and Oxford during the Easter holiday only exacerbated his sense of isolation.<ref>Hastings, pp. 116\u201334</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1925, Waugh's outlook briefly improved, with the prospect of a job in [[Pisa]], Italy, as secretary to the Scottish writer [[Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff]], who was engaged on the English translations of [[Marcel Proust]]'s works. Believing that the job was his, Waugh resigned his position at Arnold House. He had meantime sent the early chapters of his novel to Acton for assessment and criticism. Acton's reply was so coolly dismissive that Waugh immediately burnt his manuscript; shortly afterwards, before he left [[North Wales]], he learned that the Moncrieff job had fallen through.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I p. 112</ref> The twin blows were sufficient for him to consider suicide. He records that he went down to a nearby beach and, leaving a note with his clothes, walked out to sea. An attack by jellyfish changed his mind, and he returned quickly to the shore.<ref>Waugh, ''A Little Learning'', pp. 228\u201330</ref>\n\nDuring the following two years Waugh taught at schools in [[Aston Clinton]] (from which he was dismissed for the attempted drunken seduction of a school matron) and [[Notting Hill]] in London.<ref>Hastings, pp. 148\u201349</ref> He considered alternative careers in printing or cabinet-making, and attended evening classes in carpentry at Holborn Polytechnic while continuing to write.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 145\u201347</ref> A short story, \"The Balance\", written in an experimental [[modernist literature|modernist]] style, became his first commercially published fiction, when it was included by Chapman and Hall in a 1926 anthology, ''Georgian Stories''.<ref>Patey, pp. 19\u201320</ref> An extended essay on the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] was printed privately by Alastair Graham, using by agreement the press of the [[Shakespeare Head Press]] in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], where he was undergoing training as a printer.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I p. 505</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Doyle |first=Paul A. |title=Some Unpublished Waugh Correspondence III |url=http://www.abbotshill.freeserve.co.uk/EWN5-1.htm |journal=Evelyn Waugh Newsletter |volume=5 |issue=1 |date=Spring 1971 |accessdate=17 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610021305/http://www.abbotshill.freeserve.co.uk/EWN5-1.htm |archivedate=10 June 2011 }}</ref> This led to a contract from the publishers [[Gerald Duckworth and Company|Duckworths]] for a full-length biography of [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], which Waugh wrote during 1927.<ref name= Sykes73>Sykes, pp. 73\u201375</ref> He also began working on a [[comic novel]]; after several temporary working titles this became ''[[Decline and Fall]]''.<ref>Waugh diaries, 3 and 4 September 1927: Davie (ed.), p. 289</ref><ref name= Hastings168>Hastings, pp. 168\u201370</ref> Having given up teaching, he had no regular employment except for a short, unsuccessful stint as a reporter on the ''[[Daily Express]]'' in April\u2013May 1927.<ref>Sykes, pp. 72\u201373</ref> That year he met (possibly through his brother [[Alec Waugh|Alec]]) and fell in love with [[Evelyn Gardner]], the daughter of [[Herbert Gardner, 1st Baron Burghclere|Lord and Lady Burghclere]].<ref>Hastings, pp. 152\u201353</ref>\n\n====\"He-Evelyn\" and \"She-Evelyn\"====\n[[File:069 Canonbury Square.jpg|thumb|upright|Canonbury Square, where Waugh and Evelyn Gardner lived during their brief marriage]]\nIn December 1927, Waugh and Evelyn Gardner became engaged, despite the opposition of Lady Burghclere, who felt that Waugh lacked moral fibre and kept unsuitable company.<ref>Hastings, pp. 164\u201365</ref> Among their friends, they quickly became known as \"He-Evelyn\" and \"She-Evelyn\".<ref name= StannardODNB/> Waugh was at this time dependent on a \u00a34-a-week allowance from his father and the small sums he could earn from book reviewing and journalism.<ref>Hastings, pp. 160\u201361</ref> The Rossetti biography was published to a generally favourable reception in April 1928: [[J. C. Squire]] in ''The Observer'' praised the book's elegance and wit; Acton gave cautious approval; and the novelist [[Rebecca West]] wrote to express how much she had enjoyed the book. Less pleasing to Waugh was the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]''{{'}}s references to him as \"Miss Waugh\".<ref name= Hastings168/>\n\nWhen ''Decline and Fall'' was completed, Duckworths objected to its \"obscenity\", but Chapman and Hall agreed to publish it.<ref>Sykes, p. 84</ref> This was sufficient for Waugh and Gardner to bring forward their wedding plans. They were married in St Paul's Church, Portman Square, on 27 June 1928, with only Acton, Alec Waugh and the bride's friend [[Lady Pansy Lamb|Pansy Pakenham]] present.<ref>Hastings, pp. 175\u201376</ref> The couple made their home in a small flat in Canonbury Square, [[Islington]].<ref>Stannard, Vol. I p. 157</ref> The first months of the marriage were overshadowed by a lack of money, and by Gardner's poor health, which persisted into the autumn.<ref>Hastings, pp. 177\u201379</ref>\n\nIn September 1928, ''Decline and Fall'' was published to almost unanimous praise. By December, the book was into its third printing, and the American publishing rights were sold for $500.<ref>Hastings, pp. 180\u201382</ref> In the afterglow of his success, Waugh was commissioned to write travel articles in return for a free [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] cruise, which he and Gardner began in February 1929, as an extended, delayed honeymoon. The trip was disrupted when Gardner contracted [[pneumonia]] and was carried ashore to the British hospital in [[Port Said]]. The couple returned home in June, after her recovery. A month later, without warning, Gardner confessed that their mutual friend, [[John Heygate]], had become her lover. After an attempted reconciliation failed, a shocked and dismayed Waugh filed for divorce on 3 September 1929. The couple apparently met again only once, during the process for the [[annulment]] of their marriage a few years later.<ref>Davie (ed.), pp. 305\u201306</ref>\n\n==Novelist and journalist==\n\n===Recognition===\nWaugh's first biographer, [[Christopher Sykes (author)|Christopher Sykes]], records that after the divorce friends \"saw, or believed they saw, a new hardness and bitterness\" in Waugh's outlook.<ref>Sykes, p. 96</ref> Nevertheless, despite a letter to Acton in which he wrote that he \"did not know it was possible to be so miserable and live\",<ref name= Amory39>Amory (ed.), p. 39</ref> he soon resumed his professional and social life. He finished his second novel, ''[[Vile Bodies]]'',<ref name= Patey33/> and wrote articles including (ironically, he thought) one for the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' on the meaning of the marriage ceremony.<ref name= Amory39/> During this period Waugh began the practice of staying at the various houses of his friends; he was to have no settled home for the next eight years.<ref name= Patey33/>\n\n''Vile Bodies'', a satire on the [[Bright Young People]] of the 1920s, was published on 19 January 1930 and was Waugh's first major commercial success. Despite its quasi-biblical title, the book is dark, bitter, \"a manifesto of disillusionment\", according to biographer Martin Stannard.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I p. 203\u201304</ref> As a best-selling author Waugh could now command larger fees for his journalism.<ref name= Patey33>Patey, pp. 33\u201334</ref> Amid regular work for ''[[The Graphic]]'', ''[[Town and Country (magazine)|Town and Country]]'' and ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', he quickly wrote ''Labels'', a detached account of his honeymoon cruise with She-Evelyn.<ref name= Patey33/>\n\n===Conversion to Catholicism===\nOn 29 September 1930, Waugh was received into the Catholic Church. This shocked his family and surprised some of his friends, but he had contemplated the step for some time.<ref name= Patey35>Patey, pp. 35\u201339</ref> He had lost his Anglicanism at Lancing and had led an irreligious life at Oxford, but there are references in his diaries from the mid-1920s to religious discussion and regular churchgoing. On 22 December 1925, Waugh wrote: \"Claud and I took Audrey to supper and sat up until 7 in the morning arguing about the Roman Church\".<ref>Waugh diaries, 22 December 1926: Davie (ed.), p. 237</ref> The entry for 20 February 1927 includes, \"I am to visit a Father Underhill about being a parson\".<ref>Waugh diaries, 20 February 1927: Davie (ed.), p. 281</ref> Throughout the period, Waugh was influenced by his friend Olivia Plunket-Greene, who had converted in 1925 and of whom Waugh later wrote, \"She bullied me into the Church\".<ref>Sykes, p. 107</ref> It was she who led him to Father [[Martin D'Arcy]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]], who persuaded Waugh \"on firm intellectual convictions but little emotion\" that \"the Christian revelation was genuine\". In 1949, Waugh explained that his conversion followed his realisation that life was \"unintelligible and unendurable without God\".<ref name= Gallagher366>\"Come Inside\", first published in ''The Road to Damascus'' (1949), ed.

He reported the event as \"an elaborate propaganda effort\" to convince the world that Abyssinia was a civilised nation which concealed the fact that the emperor had achieved power through barbarous means.<ref>Patey, p. 91</ref> A subsequent journey through the [[British East Africa]] colonies and the [[Belgian Congo]] formed the basis of two books; the travelogue ''Remote People'' (1931) and the comic novel ''[[Black Mischief]]'' (1932).<ref>Sykes, p. 109</ref> Waugh's next extended trip, in the winter of 1932\u20131933, was to [[Guyana|British Guiana]] (now Guyana) in South America, possibly taken to distract him from a long and unrequited passion for the socialite [[Teresa Jungman]].<ref>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 276, 310</ref> On arrival in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]], Waugh arranged a river trip by steam launch into the interior. He travelled on via several staging-posts to [[Boa Vista, Roraima|Boa Vista]] in Brazil, and then took a convoluted overland journey back to Georgetown.<ref>Hastings, pp. 272\u201381</ref> His various adventures and encounters found their way into two further books: his travel account ''Ninety-two Days'', and the novel ''[[A Handful of Dust]]'', both published in 1934.<ref>Hastings, pp. 296, 306</ref>\n\nBack from South America, Waugh faced accusations of obscenity and [[blasphemy]] from the Catholic journal ''[[The Tablet]]'', which objected to passages in ''Black Mischief''. He defended himself in an open letter to the [[Archbishop of Westminster]], Cardinal [[Francis Bourne]],<ref>Amory (ed.), pp. 72\u201378</ref> which remained unpublished until 1980. In the summer of 1934, he went on an expedition to [[Spitsbergen]] in the [[Arctic]], an experience he did not enjoy and of which he made minimal literary use.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 367\u201374</ref> On his return, determined to write a major Catholic biography, he selected the [[Jesuit]] martyr [[Edmund Campion]] as his subject. The book, published in 1935, caused controversy by its forthright pro-Catholic, anti-[[Protestant]] stance but brought its writer the [[Hawthornden Prize]].<ref>Patey, p. 126</ref><ref>Hastings, pp. 324\u201325</ref> He returned to Abyssinia in August 1935 to report the opening stages of the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]] for the ''Daily Mail''. Waugh, on the basis of his earlier visit, considered Abyssinia  \"a savage place which [[Mussolini]] was doing well to tame\" according to his fellow reporter, [[Bill Deedes|William Deedes]].<ref>Deedes, p. 15</ref> Waugh saw little action and was not wholly serious in his role as a war correspondent.<ref>Davie, p. 391</ref> Deedes remarks on the older writer's snobbery: \"None of us quite measured up to the company he liked to keep back at home\".<ref>Deedes, pp. 35\u201336</ref> However, in the face of imminent Italian air attacks, Deedes found Waugh's courage \"deeply reassuring\".<ref>Deedes, pp. 62\u201363</ref> Waugh wrote up his Abyssinian experiences in a book, ''Waugh in Abyssinia'' (1936), which [[Rose Macaulay]] dismissed as a \"fascist tract\", on account of its pro-Italian tone.<ref>Patey, p. 141</ref> A better-known account is his novel ''[[Scoop (novel)|Scoop]]'' (1938), in which the protagonist, William Boot, is loosely based on Deedes.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I p. 406</ref>\n\nAmong Waugh's growing circle of friends were [[Diana Mitford|Diana Guinness]] and [[Bryan Guinness, 2nd Baron Moyne|Bryan Guinness]] (dedicatees of ''[[Vile Bodies]]''), [[Lady Diana Cooper]] and her husband [[Duff Cooper]],<ref>Hastings, p. 263</ref> [[Nancy Mitford]] who was originally a friend of Evelyn Gardner's,<ref>Hastings, p. 191</ref> and the [[Earl Beauchamp|Lygon sisters]]. Waugh had known [[Hugh Patrick Lygon]] at Oxford; now he was introduced to the girls and their country house, [[Madresfield Court]], which became the closest that he had to a home during his years of wandering.<ref>Byrne, p. 155</ref> In 1933, on a Greek islands cruise, he was introduced by Father D'Arcy to Gabriel Herbert, eldest daughter of the late explorer [[Aubrey Herbert]]. When the cruise ended Waugh was invited to stay at the Herbert family's villa in [[Portofino]], where he first met Gabriel's 17-year-old sister, Laura.<ref>Hastings pp. 284\u201387</ref>\n\n===Second marriage===\nOn his conversion, Waugh had accepted that he would be unable to remarry while Evelyn Gardner was alive. However, he wanted a wife and children, and in October 1933, he began proceedings for the [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulment]] of the marriage on the grounds of \"lack of real consent\". The case was heard by an [[Ecclesiastical court|ecclesiastical tribunal]] in London, but a delay in the submission of the papers to Rome meant that the annulment was not granted until 4 July 1936.<ref>Hastings, pp. 290\u201393</ref> In the meantime, following their initial encounter in Portofino, Waugh had fallen in love with Laura Herbert.<ref>Byrne, pp. 240\u201341</ref> He proposed marriage, by letter, in spring 1936.<ref>Amory (ed.), pp. 103\u201305</ref> There were initial misgivings from the [[Herbert family|Herberts]], an aristocratic Catholic family; as a further complication, Laura Herbert was a cousin of Evelyn Gardner.<ref name= StannardODNB/> Despite some family hostility the marriage took place on 17 April 1937 at the [[Church of our Lady of the Assumption and St Gregory, Westminster|Church of the Assumption]] in Warwick Street, London.<ref>Byrne, pp. 260\u201361</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p6634.htm|title=Person Page|website=thepeerage.com|access-date=8 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs a wedding present the bride's grandmother bought the couple Piers Court, a country house near [[Stinchcombe, Gloucestershire|Stinchcombe]] in Gloucestershire.<ref>Hastings, pp. 358\u201359</ref> The couple had seven children, one of whom died in infancy. Their first child, a daughter, Maria Teresa, was born on 9 March 1938 and a son, [[Auberon Waugh|Auberon Alexander]], on 17 November 1939.<ref>Hastings, pp. 336 and 392</ref> Between these events, ''Scoop'' was published in May 1938 to wide critical acclaim.<ref>Stannard, Vol. i pp. 470\u201371</ref> In August 1938 Waugh, with Laura, made a three-month trip to [[Mexico]] after which he wrote ''[[Robbery Under Law]]'', based on his experiences there. In the book he spelled out clearly his conservative credo; he later described the book as dealing \"little with travel and much with political questions\".<ref>Sykes, p. 184</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\n\n===Royal Marine and commando===\nWaugh left Piers Court on 1 September 1939, at the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] and moved his young family to [[Pixton Park]] in [[Somerset]], the Herbert family's country seat, while he sought military employment.<ref>Hastings, pp. 384\u201386</ref> He also began writing a novel in a new style, using first-person narration,<ref>Sykes, pp. 273\u201376</ref> but abandoned work on it when he was commissioned into the [[Royal Marines]] in December and entered training at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] naval base.<ref>Hastings, pp. 391\u201392</ref> He never completed the novel: fragments were eventually published as ''Work Suspended and Other Stories'' (1943).<ref>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 490\u2013501</ref>\n\nWaugh's daily training routine left him with \"so stiff a spine that he found it painful even to pick up a pen\".<ref>Stannard, Vol. II, p. 2</ref> In April 1940, he was temporarily promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] and given command of a [[company (military unit)|company]] of marines, but he proved an unpopular officer, being haughty and curt with his men.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 9</ref> Even after the [[Battle of France|German invasion of the Low Countries]] (10 May \u2013 22 June 1940), his battalion was not called into action.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 15</ref> Waugh's inability to adapt to regimental life meant that he soon lost his command, and he became the battalion's Intelligence Officer. In that role, he finally saw action in Operation Menace as part of the British force sent to the [[Battle of Dakar]] in West Africa (23\u201325 September 1940) in August 1940 to support an attempt by the [[Free French Forces]] to overthrow the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] colonial government and install General [[Charles de Gaulle]]. Operation Menace failed, hampered by fog and misinformation about the extent of the town's defences, and the British forces withdrew on 26 September. Waugh's comment on the affair was this: \u2033Bloodshed has been avoided at the cost of honour.\u2033<ref name= Stannard16>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 16\u201320</ref><ref>Amory (ed.), p. 141</ref>\n\nIn November 1940, Waugh was posted to a [[commando]] unit, and, after further training, became a member of \"[[Layforce]]\", under Colonel (later Brigadier) [[Robert Laycock]].<ref name= Stannard16/> In February 1941, the unit sailed to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], where it participated in an unsuccessful attempt to recapture [[Bardia]], on the Libyan coast.<ref>Hastings, pp. 421\u201322</ref> In May, Layforce was required to assist in the evacuation of [[Crete]]: Waugh was shocked by the disorder and its loss of discipline and, as he saw it, the cowardice of the departing troops.<ref>Sykes, pp. 215\u201316</ref> In July, during the roundabout journey home by troop ship, he wrote ''[[Put Out More Flags]]'' (1942), a novel of the war's early months in which he returned to the literary style he had used in the 1930s.<ref>Patey, p. 171</ref> Back in Britain, more training and waiting followed until, in May 1942, he was transferred to the [[Royal Horse Guards]], on Laycock's recommendation.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 66\u201367</ref> On 10 June 1942, Laura gave birth to Margaret, the couple's fourth child.<ref>Hastings, p. 442</ref>{{refn|Earlier, Laura had borne a daughter, christened Mary, on 1 December 1940, but she lived only a few hours.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 24</ref>|group= n}}\n\n===Frustration, ''Brideshead'' and Yugoslavia===\nWaugh's elation at his transfer soon descended into disillusion as he failed to find opportunities for active service. The death of his father, on 26 June 1943, and the need to deal with family affairs prevented him from departing with his brigade for North Africa as part of [[Operation Husky]] (9 July \u2013 17 August 1943), the Allied invasion of [[Sicily]].<ref>Hastings, pp. 445\u201346</ref> Despite his undoubted courage, his unmilitary and insubordinate character were rendering him effectively unemployable as a soldier.<ref>Sykes, pp. 229\u201330</ref> After spells of idleness at the regimental depot in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], Waugh began parachute training at [[Tatton Park]], Cheshire, but landed awkwardly during an exercise and fractured a [[fibula]]. Recovering at Windsor, he applied for three months' unpaid leave to write the novel that had been forming in his mind. His request was granted and, on 31 January 1944, he departed for [[Chagford]], Devon, where he could work in seclusion. The result was ''[[Brideshead Revisited|Brideshead Revisited: The Sacred & Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder]]'' (1945),<ref>Hastings, pp. 454\u201362</ref> the first of his explicitly Catholic novels of which the biographer [[Douglas Lane Patey]] commented that it was \"the book that seemed to confirm his new sense of his writerly vocation\".<ref>Patey, p. 296</ref>\n\nWaugh managed to extend his leave until June 1944. Soon after his return to duty he was recruited by [[Randolph Churchill]] to serve in a military mission to [[Yugoslavia]], and, early in July, flew with Churchill from [[Bari]], Italy, to the Croatian island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]]. There, they met [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]], the Communist leader of the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]], who was leading the guerrilla fight against the occupying [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces with Allied support.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 113\u201314</ref> Waugh and Churchill returned to Bari before flying back to Yugoslavia to begin their mission, but their aeroplane crash-landed, both men were injured, and their mission was delayed for a month.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 116\u201321</ref>\n\nThe mission eventually arrived at [[Topusko]], where it established itself in a deserted farmhouse. The group's liaison duties, between the [[British Army]] and the Communist Partisans, were light. Waugh had little sympathy with the Communist-led Partisans and despised Tito. His chief interest became the welfare of the Catholic Church in Croatia, which, he believed, had suffered at the hands of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] and would fare worse when the Communists took control.<ref>Hastings, pp. 468\u201373</ref> He expressed those thoughts in a long report, \"Church and State in Liberated Croatia\". After spells in [[Dubrovnik]] and Rome, Waugh returned to London on 15 March 1945 to present his report, which the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] suppressed to maintain good relations with Tito, now the leader of communist Yugoslavia.<ref>Hastings, pp. 485\u201391</ref>\n\n==Postwar==\n\n===Fame and fortune===\n''Brideshead Revisited'' was published in London in May 1945.<ref name= Hastings494>Hastings, pp. 494\u201395</ref> Waugh had been convinced of the book's qualities, \"my first novel rather than my last\".<ref>Patey, p. 224</ref> It was a tremendous success, bringing its author fame, fortune and literary status.<ref name= Hastings494/> Happy though he was with this outcome, Waugh's principal concern as the war ended was the fate of the large populations of Eastern European Catholics, betrayed (as he saw it) into the hands of [[Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]] by the Allies. He now saw little difference in morality between the war's combatants and later described it as \"a sweaty tug-of-war between teams of indistinguishable louts\".<ref>Gallagher (ed.), pp. 289\u201390</ref> Although he took momentary pleasure from the defeat of [[Winston Churchill]] and his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], he saw the accession to power of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] as a triumph of barbarism and the onset of a new \"Dark Age\".<ref name= Hastings494/>\n[[File:Helena of Constantinople (Cima da Conegliano).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Helena (Empress)|St. Helena]], the subject of Waugh's 1950 novel]]\n\nIn September 1945, after he was released by the army, he returned to Piers Court with his family (another daughter, Harriet, had been born at Pixton in 1944)<ref>Hastings, pp. 462 and 494\u201397</ref> but spent much of the next seven years either in London, or travelling. In March 1946, he visited the [[Nuremberg trials]], and later that year, he was in Spain for a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the death of [[Francisco de Vitoria]], said to be the founder of [[international law]].<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 168</ref> Waugh wrote up his experiences of the frustrations of postwar European travel in a novella, ''[[Scott-King's Modern Europe]]''.<ref name= Patey251>Patey, p. 251</ref> In February 1947, he made the first of several trips to the United States, in the first instance to discuss filming of ''Brideshead''. The project collapsed, but Waugh used his time in Hollywood to visit the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn cemetery]], which provided the basis for his satire of American perspectives on death, ''[[The Loved One]]''.<ref name= StannardODNB/> In 1951 he visited the [[Holy Land]] with his future biographer, Christopher Sykes,<ref>Sykes, pp. 338\u201342</ref> and in 1953, he travelled to [[Goa]] to witness the final exhibition before burial of the remains of the 16th century Jesuit missionary-priest [[Francis Xavier]].<ref name= Hastings554>Hastings, p. 554</ref><ref>Waugh's article on the Goa visit, \"Goa, the Home of s Saint\" is reprinted in Gallager (ed.), pp. 448\u201356</ref>\n\nIn between his journeys, Waugh worked intermittently on ''[[Helena (1950 novel)|Helena]]'', a long-planned novel about the discoverer of the [[True Cross]] that was \"far the best book I have ever written or ever will write\". Its success with the public was limited, but it was, his daughter Harriet later said, \"the only one of his books that he ever cared to read aloud\".<ref>Patey, p. 289</ref>\n\nIn 1952 Waugh published ''[[Men at Arms (Evelyn Waugh)|Men at Arms]]'', the first of his semi-autobiographical war trilogy in which he depicted many of his personal experiences and encounters from the early stages of the war.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 5, 82, 340</ref> Other books published during this period included ''[[When The Going Was Good]]'' (1946),<ref name= Patey251/> an anthology of his pre-war travel writing, ''The Holy Places'' (published by the [[Ian Fleming]]-managed [[Queen Anne Press]], 1952) and ''[[Love Among the Ruins. A Romance of the Near Future|Love Among the Ruins]]'' (1953), a [[dystopia]]n tale in which Waugh displays his contempt for the modern world.<ref>Hastings, p. 553</ref> Nearing 50, Waugh was old for his years, \"selectively deaf, rheumatic, irascible\" and increasingly dependent on alcohol and on drugs to relieve his insomnia and depression.<ref name= StannardODNB/> Two more children, James (born 1946) and Septimus (born 1950), completed his family.<ref>Hastings, pp. 531 and 537</ref>\n\nFrom 1945 onwards, Waugh became an avid collector of objects, particularly Victorian paintings and furniture. He filled Piers Court with his acquisitions, often from London's [[Portobello Market]] and from house clearance sales.<ref name= P153/> His diary entry for 30 August 1946 records a visit to [[Gloucester]], where he bought \"a lion of wood, finely carved for \u00a325, also a bookcase \u00a335&nbsp;... a charming Chinese painting \u00a310, a Regency easel \u00a37\".<ref>Davie (ed.), p. 658</ref> Some of his buying was shrewd and prescient; he paid \u00a310 for Rossetti's \"Spirit of the Rainbow\" to begin a collection of Victorian paintings that eventually acquired great value.

Partly because of his dependency on drugs, his health was steadily deteriorating.<ref>Patey, p. 324</ref> Shortage of cash led him to agree in November 1953 to be interviewed on BBC radio, where the panel took an aggressive line: \"they tried to make a fool of me, and I don't think they entirely succeeded\", Waugh wrote to Nancy Mitford.<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 415</ref> [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]] in ''[[The Spectator]]'' likened the interview to \"the goading of a bull by matadors\".<ref>{{cite news|last= Brown|first= Mark|title= Waugh at the BBC: \"the most ill-natured interview ever\" on CD after 55 years\"|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/15/bbc.radio|journal= The Guardian|date= 15 April 2008|accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nEarly in 1954, Waugh's doctors, concerned by his physical deterioration, advised a change of scene. On 29 January, he took a ship bound for [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], hoping that he would be able to finish his novel. Within a few days, he was writing home complaining of \"other passengers whispering about me\" and of hearing voices, including that of his recent BBC [[interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]], Stephen Black. He left the ship in [[Egypt]] and flew on to [[Colombo]], but, he wrote to Laura, the voices followed him.<ref>Patey, p. 325</ref> Alarmed, Laura sought help from her friend, [[Frances Donaldson]], whose husband agreed to fly out to Ceylon and bring Waugh home. In fact, Waugh made his own way back, now believing that he was being possessed by devils. A brief medical examination indicated that Waugh was suffering from [[bromism|bromide poisoning]] from his drugs regimen. When his medication was changed, the voices and the other hallucinations quickly disappeared.<ref>Donaldson, pp. 56\u201361</ref> Waugh was delighted, informing all of his friends that he had been mad: \"Clean off my onion!\". The experience was  fictionalised a few years later, in ''[[The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold]]'' (1957).<ref>Patey, pp. 326, 338\u201341</ref>\n\nIn 1956, [[Edwin Newman]] made a short film about Waugh. In the course of it, Newman learned that Waugh hated the modern world and wished that he had been born two or three centuries sooner. Waugh disliked modern methods of transportation or communication, refused to drive or use the telephone, and wrote with an old-fashioned [[dip pen]]. He also expressed the views that American news reporters could not function without frequent infusions of [[whisky]], and that every American had been divorced at least once.<ref>{{cite book |first=Edwin |last=Newman |authorlink=Edwin Newman |title=Strictly Speaking: will America be the death of English? |url=https://archive.org/details/strictlyspeakin00newm |url-access=registration |location=Indianapolis |publisher=Bobbs-Merrill |year=1974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/strictlyspeakin00newm/page/134 134] }}</ref>\n\n===Late works===\n[[File:Combe Florey - near the Old Manor House - geograph.org.uk - 904793.jpg|thumb|left|[[Combe Florey]], the village in Somerset to which Waugh and his family moved in 1956]]\nRestored to health, Waugh returned to work and finished ''Officers and Gentlemen''. In June 1955 the ''[[Daily Express]]'' journalist and reviewer [[Nancy Spain]], accompanied by her friend Lord Noel-Buxton, arrived uninvited at Piers Court and demanded an interview. Waugh saw the pair off and wrote a wry account for ''The Spectator'',<ref>\"Awake, My Soul, It Is a Lord\", published in ''The Spectator'', 8 July 1955, reprinted in Gallagher, (ed.), pp. 468\u201370</ref> but he was troubled by the incident and decided to sell Piers Court: \"I felt it was polluted\", he told Nancy Mitford.<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 636</ref> Late in 1956, the family moved to the manor house in the Somerset village of [[Combe Florey]].<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 385\u201386</ref> In January 1957, Waugh avenged the Spain\u2013Noel-Buxton intrusion by winning libel damages from the ''Express'' and Spain. The paper had printed an article by Spain that suggested that the sales of Waugh's books were much lower than they were and that his worth, as a journalist, was low.<ref>Stannard, pp. 382\u201383</ref>\n\n''[[The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold|Gilbert Pinfold]]'' was published in the summer of 1957, \"my barmy book\", Waugh called it.<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 477</ref> The extent to which the story is self-mockery, rather than true autobiography, became a subject of critical debate.<ref name= Patey339>Patey, pp. 339\u201341</ref> Waugh's next major book was a biography of his longtime friend [[Ronald Knox]], the Catholic writer and theologian who had died in August 1957. Research and writing extended over two years during which Waugh did little other work, delaying the third volume of his war trilogy. In June 1958, his son Auberon was severely wounded in a shooting accident while serving with the army in [[Cyprus]]. Waugh remained detached; he neither went to Cyprus nor immediately visited Auberon on the latter's return to Britain. The critic and [[biography in literature|literary biographer]] David Wykes called Waugh's sang-froid \"astonishing\" and the family's apparent acceptance of his behaviour even more so.<ref>Wykes, p. 194</ref>\n\nAlthough most of Waugh's books had sold well, and he had been well-rewarded for his journalism, his levels of expenditure meant that money problems and tax bills were a recurrent feature in his life.<ref name= H591/> In 1950, as a means of [[tax avoidance]], he had set up a trust fund for his children (he termed it the \"Save the Children Fund\", after the [[Save the Children|well-established charity of that name]]) into which he placed the initial advance and all future royalties from the Penguin (paperback) editions of his books.<ref>Stannard, Vol II pp. 254\u201355</ref> He was able to augment his personal finances by charging household items to the trust or selling his own possessions to it.<ref name= StannardODNB/> Nonetheless, by 1960, shortage of money led him to agree to an interview on BBC Television, in the ''[[Face to Face (British TV series)|Face to Face]]'' series conducted by [[John Freeman (British politician)|John Freeman]]. The interview was broadcast on 26 June 1960; according to his biographer [[Selina Hastings (writer)|Selena Hastings]], Waugh restrained his instinctive hostility and coolly answered the questions put to him by Freeman, assuming what she describes as a \"pose of world-weary boredom\".<ref name= H591>Hastings, pp. 591\u201392</ref>\n\nIn 1960, Waugh was offered the honour of a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] but declined, believing that he should have been given the superior status of a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]].<ref>Stannard, Vol II pp. 415\u201316</ref> In September, he produced his final travel book, ''[[A Tourist in Africa]]'', based on a visit made in January\u2013March 1959. He enjoyed the trip but \"despised\" the book. The critic [[Cyril Connolly]] called it \"the thinnest piece of book-making that Mr Waugh has undertaken\".<ref>Patey, pp. 346\u201347</ref> The book done, he worked on the last of the war trilogy, which was published in 1961 as ''Unconditional Surrender''.<ref>Hastings, pp. 594\u201398</ref>\n\n===Decline and death===\n[[File:Evelyn Waugh Grave.jpg|thumb|upright|Waugh's grave in Combe Florey, adjacent to but not within the Anglican churchyard.]]\nAs he approached his sixties, Waugh was in poor health, prematurely aged, \"fat, deaf, short of breath\", according to Patey.<ref>Patey, p. 359</ref> His biographer Martin Stannard likened his appearance around this time to that of \"an exhausted rogue jollied up by drink\".<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 477</ref> In 1962 Waugh began work on his autobiography, and that same year wrote his final fiction, the long short story ''Basil Seal Rides Again''. This revival of the protagonist of ''Black Mischief'' and ''Put Out More Flags'' was published in 1963; the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' called it a \"nasty little book\".<ref>{{cite journal| last= Willett|first= John|title= A Rake Raked Up| journal= The Times Literary Supplement| date= 14 November 1963| page = 921}}</ref> When the first volume of autobiography, ''A Little Learning'', was published in 1964, Waugh's often oblique tone and discreet name changes ensured that friends avoided the embarrassments that some had feared.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 480</ref>\n\nWaugh had welcomed the accession in 1958 of [[Pope John XXIII]]<ref>Amory (ed.), pp. 514\u201315</ref> and wrote an appreciative tribute on the pope's death in 1963.<ref>\"An Appreciation of Pope John\" first published in the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', 27 July 1963, reprinted in Gallagher (ed.), pp. 614\u201318</ref> However, he became increasingly concerned by the decisions emerging from the [[Second Vatican Council]], which was convened by Pope John in October 1962 and continued under his successor, [[Pope Paul VI]] until 1965.

Waugh's agent, A.D. Peters, negotiated a settlement with the tax authorities for a manageable amount,<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 485</ref> but in his concern to generate funds, Waugh signed contracts to write several books, including a history of the papacy, an illustrated book on the Crusades and a second volume of autobiography.

Although he praised younger writers, such as [[Angus Wilson]], [[Muriel Spark]] and [[V.S. Naipaul]], he was scornful of the 1950s writers' group known as \"[[The Movement (literature)|The Movement]]\". He said that the literary world was \"sinking into black disaster\" and that literature might die within thirty years.<ref>Patey, pp. 320\u201321</ref> As a schoolboy, Waugh had praised the art of [[Cubism]] but soon abandoned his interest in artistic [[Modernism]].<ref>Gallagher (ed.), p. 5</ref> In 1945, Waugh said that [[Pablo Picasso]]'s artistic standing was the result of a \"mesmeric trick\" and that his paintings \"could not be intelligently discussed in the terms used of the civilised [[Old Masters|masters]]\".<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 214</ref> In 1953, in a radio interview, he named [[Augustus Egg]] (1816\u20131863) as a painter for whom he had particular esteem.{{refn|Excerpts from the text of the broadcast, on 16 November 1953, are given in the 1998 Penguin Books edition of ''The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold'', p. 135\u2013143|group= n}} Despite their political differences, Waugh came to admire [[George Orwell]], because of their shared patriotism and sense of [[morality]].<ref>Lebedoff, p. 161\u201362, 175\u201377</ref>\n\nThroughout his literary works, Evelyn Waugh freely expressed [[racialism|racial]] and [[anti-Semitism|anti-semitic]] prejudices, especially in the books he wrote before the [[Second World War]].

He worked briefly as a schoolmaster before he became a full-time writer. As a young man, he acquired many fashionable and aristocratic friends and developed a taste for [[country house]] society. He travelled extensively in the 1930s, often as a special newspaper correspondent; he reported from [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] at the time of the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|1935 Italian invasion]]. He served in the British armed forces throughout the Second World War, first in the [[Royal Marines]] and then in the [[Royal Horse Guards]]. He was a perceptive writer who used the experiences and the wide range of people whom he encountered in his works of fiction, generally to humorous effect. Waugh's detachment was such that he fictionalised his own mental breakdown which occurred in the early 1950s.\n\nWaugh converted to [[Catholicism]] in 1930 after his first marriage failed. His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church, and the changes by the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962\u201365) greatly disturbed his sensibilities, especially the introduction of the vernacular [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]]. That blow to his religious traditionalism, his dislike for the [[welfare state]] culture of the postwar world, and the decline of his health all darkened his final years, but he continued to write. He displayed to the world a mask of indifference, but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered his friends. After his death in 1966, he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial ''[[Brideshead Revisited (TV serial)|Brideshead Revisited]]'' (1981).\n\n==Family background==\n[[File:Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Cockburn, Lord Cockburn|Lord Cockburn]], the Scottish judge, was one of Waugh's great-great-grandfathers.]]\nArthur Evelyn St. John Waugh was born on 28 October 1903<ref>Eade, p.

Alec departed Sherborne for military training as an [[Military officer|officer]], and, while awaiting confirmation of his [[Commission (document)|commission]], wrote ''The Loom of Youth'' (1917), a novel of school life, which alluded to homosexual friendships at a school that was recognisably Sherborne.

A letter written that year to a Lancing friend, [[Dudley Carew]], hints at severe emotional pressures: \"I have been living very intensely these last three weeks.

I may perhaps one day in a later time tell you some of the things that have happened\".<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 12</ref> He did just enough work to pass his final examinations in the summer of 1924 with a third-class. However, as he had begun at Hertford in the second term of the 1921\u201322 academic year, Waugh had completed only eight terms' residence when he sat his finals, rather than the nine required under the university's statutes. His poor results led to the loss of his scholarship, which made it impossible for him to return to Oxford for that final term, so he left without his degree.<ref>Hastings, p. 112</ref>\n\nBack at home,  Waugh began a novel, ''[[The Temple at Thatch]]'', and worked with some of his fellow Hypocrites on a film, ''The Scarlet Woman'', which was shot partly in the gardens at Underhill. He spent much of the rest of the summer in the company of Alastair Graham; after Graham departed for [[Kenya]], Waugh enrolled for the autumn at a London art school, [[Heatherley School of Fine Art|Heatherley's]].<ref name= S93>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 93\u201396</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n\n===Teaching and writing===\n[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], the subject of Waugh's first full-length book (1927)]]\nWaugh began at Heatherley's in late September 1924, but became bored with the routine and quickly abandoned his course.<ref>Waugh, ''A Little Learning'', pp. 210\u201312</ref> He spent weeks partying in London and Oxford before the overriding need for money led him to apply through an agency for a teaching job. Almost at once, he secured a post at Arnold House, a boys' [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory school]] in [[North Wales]], beginning in January 1925. He took with him the notes for his novel, ''The Temple at Thatch'', intending to work on it in his spare time. Despite the gloomy ambience of the school, Waugh did his best to fulfil the requirements of his position, but a brief return to London and Oxford during the Easter holiday only exacerbated his sense of isolation.<ref>Hastings, pp. 116\u201334</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1925, Waugh's outlook briefly improved, with the prospect of a job in [[Pisa]], Italy, as secretary to the Scottish writer [[Charles Kenneth Scott Moncrieff]], who was engaged on the English translations of [[Marcel Proust]]'s works. Believing that the job was his, Waugh resigned his position at Arnold House. He had meantime sent the early chapters of his novel to Acton for assessment and criticism. Acton's reply was so coolly dismissive that Waugh immediately burnt his manuscript; shortly afterwards, before he left [[North Wales]], he learned that the Moncrieff job had fallen through.<ref>Stannard, Vol. I p. 112</ref> The twin blows were sufficient for him to consider suicide. He records that he went down to a nearby beach and, leaving a note with his clothes, walked out to sea.

By December, the book was into its third printing, and the American publishing rights were sold for $500.<ref>Hastings, pp. 180\u201382</ref> In the afterglow of his success, Waugh was commissioned to write travel articles in return for a free [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] cruise, which he and Gardner began in February 1929, as an extended, delayed honeymoon. The trip was disrupted when Gardner contracted [[pneumonia]] and was carried ashore to the British hospital in [[Port Said]]. The couple returned home in June, after her recovery. A month later, without warning, Gardner confessed that their mutual friend, [[John Heygate]], had become her lover. After an attempted reconciliation failed, a shocked and dismayed Waugh filed for divorce on 3 September 1929.

The case was heard by an [[Ecclesiastical court|ecclesiastical tribunal]] in London, but a delay in the submission of the papers to Rome meant that the annulment was not granted until 4 July 1936.<ref>Hastings, pp. 290\u201393</ref> In the meantime, following their initial encounter in Portofino, Waugh had fallen in love with Laura Herbert.<ref>Byrne, pp. 240\u201341</ref> He proposed marriage, by letter, in spring 1936.<ref>Amory (ed.), pp. 103\u201305</ref> There were initial misgivings from the [[Herbert family|Herberts]], an aristocratic Catholic family; as a further complication, Laura Herbert was a cousin of Evelyn Gardner.<ref name= StannardODNB/> Despite some family hostility the marriage took place on 17 April 1937 at the [[Church of our Lady of the Assumption and St Gregory, Westminster|Church of the Assumption]] in Warwick Street, London.<ref>Byrne, pp. 260\u201361</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p6634.htm|title=Person Page|website=thepeerage.com|access-date=8 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs a wedding present the bride's grandmother bought the couple Piers Court, a country house near [[Stinchcombe, Gloucestershire|Stinchcombe]] in Gloucestershire.<ref>Hastings, pp. 358\u201359</ref> The couple had seven children, one of whom died in infancy. Their first child, a daughter, Maria Teresa, was born on 9 March 1938 and a son, [[Auberon Waugh|Auberon Alexander]], on 17 November 1939.<ref>Hastings, pp. 336 and 392</ref> Between these events, ''Scoop'' was published in May 1938 to wide critical acclaim.<ref>Stannard, Vol. i pp. 470\u201371</ref> In August 1938 Waugh, with Laura, made a three-month trip to [[Mexico]] after which he wrote ''[[Robbery Under Law]]'', based on his experiences there. In the book he spelled out clearly his conservative credo; he later described the book as dealing \"little with travel and much with political questions\".<ref>Sykes, p. 184</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\n\n===Royal Marine and commando===\nWaugh left Piers Court on 1 September 1939, at the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] and moved his young family to [[Pixton Park]] in [[Somerset]], the Herbert family's country seat, while he sought military employment.<ref>Hastings, pp. 384\u201386</ref> He also began writing a novel in a new style, using first-person narration,<ref>Sykes, pp. 273\u201376</ref> but abandoned work on it when he was commissioned into the [[Royal Marines]] in December and entered training at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] naval base.<ref>Hastings, pp. 391\u201392</ref> He never completed the novel: fragments were eventually published as ''Work Suspended and Other Stories'' (1943).<ref>Stannard, Vol. I pp. 490\u2013501</ref>\n\nWaugh's daily training routine left him with \"so stiff a spine that he found it painful even to pick up a pen\".<ref>Stannard, Vol. II, p. 2</ref> In April 1940, he was temporarily promoted to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] and given command of a [[company (military unit)|company]] of marines, but he proved an unpopular officer, being haughty and curt with his men.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 9</ref> Even after the [[Battle of France|German invasion of the Low Countries]] (10 May \u2013 22 June 1940), his battalion was not called into action.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 15</ref> Waugh's inability to adapt to regimental life meant that he soon lost his command, and he became the battalion's Intelligence Officer. In that role, he finally saw action in Operation Menace as part of the British force sent to the [[Battle of Dakar]] in West Africa (23\u201325 September 1940) in August 1940 to support an attempt by the [[Free French Forces]] to overthrow the [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] colonial government and install General [[Charles de Gaulle]]. Operation Menace failed, hampered by fog and misinformation about the extent of the town's defences, and the British forces withdrew on 26 September. Waugh's comment on the affair was this: \u2033Bloodshed has been avoided at the cost of honour.\u2033<ref name= Stannard16>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 16\u201320</ref><ref>Amory (ed.), p. 141</ref>\n\nIn November 1940, Waugh was posted to a [[commando]] unit, and, after further training, became a member of \"[[Layforce]]\", under Colonel (later Brigadier) [[Robert Laycock]].<ref name= Stannard16/> In February 1941, the unit sailed to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], where it participated in an unsuccessful attempt to recapture [[Bardia]], on the Libyan coast.<ref>Hastings, pp. 421\u201322</ref> In May, Layforce was required to assist in the evacuation of [[Crete]]: Waugh was shocked by the disorder and its loss of discipline and, as he saw it, the cowardice of the departing troops.<ref>Sykes, pp. 215\u201316</ref> In July, during the roundabout journey home by troop ship, he wrote ''[[Put Out More Flags]]'' (1942), a novel of the war's early months in which he returned to the literary style he had used in the 1930s.<ref>Patey, p. 171</ref> Back in Britain, more training and waiting followed until, in May 1942, he was transferred to the [[Royal Horse Guards]], on Laycock's recommendation.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 66\u201367</ref> On 10 June 1942, Laura gave birth to Margaret, the couple's fourth child.<ref>Hastings, p. 442</ref>{{refn|Earlier, Laura had borne a daughter, christened Mary, on 1 December 1940, but she lived only a few hours.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 24</ref>|group= n}}\n\n===Frustration, ''Brideshead'' and Yugoslavia===\nWaugh's elation at his transfer soon descended into disillusion as he failed to find opportunities for active service. The death of his father, on 26 June 1943, and the need to deal with family affairs prevented him from departing with his brigade for North Africa as part of [[Operation Husky]] (9 July \u2013 17 August 1943), the Allied invasion of [[Sicily]].<ref>Hastings, pp. 445\u201346</ref> Despite his undoubted courage, his unmilitary and insubordinate character were rendering him effectively unemployable as a soldier.<ref>Sykes, pp. 229\u201330</ref> After spells of idleness at the regimental depot in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], Waugh began parachute training at [[Tatton Park]], Cheshire, but landed awkwardly during an exercise and fractured a [[fibula]]. Recovering at Windsor, he applied for three months' unpaid leave to write the novel that had been forming in his mind. His request was granted and, on 31 January 1944, he departed for [[Chagford]], Devon, where he could work in seclusion. The result was ''[[Brideshead Revisited|Brideshead Revisited: The Sacred & Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder]]'' (1945),<ref>Hastings, pp. 454\u201362</ref> the first of his explicitly Catholic novels of which the biographer [[Douglas Lane Patey]] commented that it was \"the book that seemed to confirm his new sense of his writerly vocation\".<ref>Patey, p. 296</ref>\n\nWaugh managed to extend his leave until June 1944. Soon after his return to duty he was recruited by [[Randolph Churchill]] to serve in a military mission to [[Yugoslavia]], and, early in July, flew with Churchill from [[Bari]], Italy, to the Croatian island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]]. There, they met [[Josip Broz Tito|Marshal Tito]], the Communist leader of the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]], who was leading the guerrilla fight against the occupying [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces with Allied support.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 113\u201314</ref> Waugh and Churchill returned to Bari before flying back to Yugoslavia to begin their mission, but their aeroplane crash-landed, both men were injured, and their mission was delayed for a month.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 116\u201321</ref>\n\nThe mission eventually arrived at [[Topusko]], where it established itself in a deserted farmhouse. The group's liaison duties, between the [[British Army]] and the Communist Partisans, were light. Waugh had little sympathy with the Communist-led Partisans and despised Tito. His chief interest became the welfare of the Catholic Church in Croatia, which, he believed, had suffered at the hands of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] and would fare worse when the Communists took control.<ref>Hastings, pp. 468\u201373</ref> He expressed those thoughts in a long report, \"Church and State in Liberated Croatia\". After spells in [[Dubrovnik]] and Rome, Waugh returned to London on 15 March 1945 to present his report, which the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] suppressed to maintain good relations with Tito, now the leader of communist Yugoslavia.<ref>Hastings, pp. 485\u201391</ref>\n\n==Postwar==\n\n===Fame and fortune===\n''Brideshead Revisited'' was published in London in May 1945.<ref name= Hastings494>Hastings, pp. 494\u201395</ref> Waugh had been convinced of the book's qualities, \"my first novel rather than my last\".<ref>Patey, p. 224</ref> It was a tremendous success, bringing its author fame, fortune and literary status.<ref name= Hastings494/> Happy though he was with this outcome, Waugh's principal concern as the war ended was the fate of the large populations of Eastern European Catholics, betrayed (as he saw it) into the hands of [[Stalin]]'s [[Soviet Union]] by the Allies. He now saw little difference in morality between the war's combatants and later described it as \"a sweaty tug-of-war between teams of indistinguishable louts\".<ref>Gallagher (ed.), pp. 289\u201390</ref> Although he took momentary pleasure from the defeat of [[Winston Churchill]] and his [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]], he saw the accession to power of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] as a triumph of barbarism and the onset of a new \"Dark Age\".<ref name= Hastings494/>\n[[File:Helena of Constantinople (Cima da Conegliano).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Helena (Empress)|St. Helena]], the subject of Waugh's 1950 novel]]\n\nIn September 1945, after he was released by the army, he returned to Piers Court with his family (another daughter, Harriet, had been born at Pixton in 1944)<ref>Hastings, pp. 462 and 494\u201397</ref> but spent much of the next seven years either in London, or travelling. In March 1946, he visited the [[Nuremberg trials]], and later that year, he was in Spain for a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the death of [[Francisco de Vitoria]], said to be the founder of [[international law]].<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 168</ref> Waugh wrote up his experiences of the frustrations of postwar European travel in a novella, ''[[Scott-King's Modern Europe]]''.<ref name= Patey251>Patey, p. 251</ref> In February 1947, he made the first of several trips to the United States, in the first instance to discuss filming of ''Brideshead''. The project collapsed, but Waugh used his time in Hollywood to visit the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn cemetery]], which provided the basis for his satire of American perspectives on death, ''[[The Loved One]]''.<ref name= StannardODNB/> In 1951 he visited the [[Holy Land]] with his future biographer, Christopher Sykes,<ref>Sykes, pp. 338\u201342</ref> and in 1953, he travelled to [[Goa]] to witness the final exhibition before burial of the remains of the 16th century Jesuit missionary-priest [[Francis Xavier]].<ref name= Hastings554>Hastings, p. 554</ref><ref>Waugh's article on the Goa visit, \"Goa, the Home of s Saint\" is reprinted in Gallager (ed.), pp. 448\u201356</ref>\n\nIn between his journeys, Waugh worked intermittently on ''[[Helena (1950 novel)|Helena]]'', a long-planned novel about the discoverer of the [[True Cross]] that was \"far the best book I have ever written or ever will write\". Its success with the public was limited, but it was, his daughter Harriet later said, \"the only one of his books that he ever cared to read aloud\".<ref>Patey, p. 289</ref>\n\nIn 1952 Waugh published ''[[Men at Arms (Evelyn Waugh)|Men at Arms]]'', the first of his semi-autobiographical war trilogy in which he depicted many of his personal experiences and encounters from the early stages of the war.<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 5, 82, 340</ref> Other books published during this period included ''[[When The Going Was Good]]'' (1946),<ref name= Patey251/> an anthology of his pre-war travel writing, ''The Holy Places'' (published by the [[Ian Fleming]]-managed [[Queen Anne Press]], 1952) and ''[[Love Among the Ruins. A Romance of the Near Future|Love Among the Ruins]]'' (1953), a [[dystopia]]n tale in which Waugh displays his contempt for the modern world.<ref>Hastings, p. 553</ref> Nearing 50, Waugh was old for his years, \"selectively deaf, rheumatic, irascible\" and increasingly dependent on alcohol and on drugs to relieve his insomnia and depression.<ref name= StannardODNB/> Two more children, James (born 1946) and Septimus (born 1950), completed his family.<ref>Hastings, pp. 531 and 537</ref>\n\nFrom 1945 onwards, Waugh became an avid collector of objects, particularly Victorian paintings and furniture. He filled Piers Court with his acquisitions, often from London's [[Portobello Market]] and from house clearance sales.<ref name= P153/> His diary entry for 30 August 1946 records a visit to [[Gloucester]], where he bought \"a lion of wood, finely carved for \u00a325, also a bookcase \u00a335&nbsp;... a charming Chinese painting \u00a310, a Regency easel \u00a37\".<ref>Davie (ed.), p. 658</ref> Some of his buying was shrewd and prescient; he paid \u00a310 for Rossetti's \"Spirit of the Rainbow\" to begin a collection of Victorian paintings that eventually acquired great value. Waugh also began, from 1949, to write knowledgeable reviews and articles on the subject of painting.<ref name= P153>Patey, pp. 153\u201354</ref>{{refn|See, for example, \"Rossetti Revisited\", 1949 (Gallagher (ed.)), pp. 377\u201379; \"Age of Unrest\", 1954 (Gallagher (ed.)), pp. 459\u201360; \"The Death of Painting\", 1956 (Gallagher (ed.)), pp. 503\u201307|group= n}}\n\n===Breakdown===\nBy 1953, Waugh's popularity as a writer was declining. He was perceived as out of step with the ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', and the large fees he demanded were no longer easily available.<ref name= Hastings554/> His money was running out and progress on the second book of his war trilogy, ''[[Officers and Gentlemen]]'', had stalled. Partly because of his dependency on drugs, his health was steadily deteriorating.<ref>Patey, p. 324</ref> Shortage of cash led him to agree in November 1953 to be interviewed on BBC radio, where the panel took an aggressive line: \"they tried to make a fool of me, and I don't think they entirely succeeded\", Waugh wrote to Nancy Mitford.<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 415</ref> [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]] in ''[[The Spectator]]'' likened the interview to \"the goading of a bull by matadors\".<ref>{{cite news|last= Brown|first= Mark|title= Waugh at the BBC: \"the most ill-natured interview ever\" on CD after 55 years\"|url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/apr/15/bbc.radio|journal= The Guardian|date= 15 April 2008|accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nEarly in 1954, Waugh's doctors, concerned by his physical deterioration, advised a change of scene. On 29 January, he took a ship bound for [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], hoping that he would be able to finish his novel. Within a few days, he was writing home complaining of \"other passengers whispering about me\" and of hearing voices, including that of his recent BBC [[interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutor]], Stephen Black. He left the ship in [[Egypt]] and flew on to [[Colombo]], but, he wrote to Laura, the voices followed him.<ref>Patey, p. 325</ref> Alarmed, Laura sought help from her friend, [[Frances Donaldson]], whose husband agreed to fly out to Ceylon and bring Waugh home. In fact, Waugh made his own way back, now believing that he was being possessed by devils. A brief medical examination indicated that Waugh was suffering from [[bromism|bromide poisoning]] from his drugs regimen. When his medication was changed, the voices and the other hallucinations quickly disappeared.<ref>Donaldson, pp. 56\u201361</ref> Waugh was delighted, informing all of his friends that he had been mad: \"Clean off my onion!\". The experience was  fictionalised a few years later, in ''[[The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold]]'' (1957).<ref>Patey, pp. 326, 338\u201341</ref>\n\nIn 1956, [[Edwin Newman]] made a short film about Waugh. In the course of it, Newman learned that Waugh hated the modern world and wished that he had been born two or three centuries sooner. Waugh disliked modern methods of transportation or communication, refused to drive or use the telephone, and wrote with an old-fashioned [[dip pen]]. He also expressed the views that American news reporters could not function without frequent infusions of [[whisky]], and that every American had been divorced at least once.<ref>{{cite book |first=Edwin |last=Newman |authorlink=Edwin Newman |title=Strictly Speaking: will America be the death of English? |url=https://archive.org/details/strictlyspeakin00newm |url-access=registration |location=Indianapolis |publisher=Bobbs-Merrill |year=1974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/strictlyspeakin00newm/page/134 134] }}</ref>\n\n===Late works===\n[[File:Combe Florey - near the Old Manor House - geograph.org.uk - 904793.jpg|thumb|left|[[Combe Florey]], the village in Somerset to which Waugh and his family moved in 1956]]\nRestored to health, Waugh returned to work and finished ''Officers and Gentlemen''. In June 1955 the ''[[Daily Express]]'' journalist and reviewer [[Nancy Spain]], accompanied by her friend Lord Noel-Buxton, arrived uninvited at Piers Court and demanded an interview. Waugh saw the pair off and wrote a wry account for ''The Spectator'',<ref>\"Awake, My Soul, It Is a Lord\", published in ''The Spectator'', 8 July 1955, reprinted in Gallagher, (ed.), pp. 468\u201370</ref> but he was troubled by the incident and decided to sell Piers Court: \"I felt it was polluted\", he told Nancy Mitford.<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 636</ref> Late in 1956, the family moved to the manor house in the Somerset village of [[Combe Florey]].<ref>Stannard, Vol. II pp. 385\u201386</ref> In January 1957, Waugh avenged the Spain\u2013Noel-Buxton intrusion by winning libel damages from the ''Express'' and Spain. The paper had printed an article by Spain that suggested that the sales of Waugh's books were much lower than they were and that his worth, as a journalist, was low.<ref>Stannard, pp. 382\u201383</ref>\n\n''[[The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold|Gilbert Pinfold]]'' was published in the summer of 1957, \"my barmy book\", Waugh called it.<ref>Amory (ed.), p. 477</ref> The extent to which the story is self-mockery, rather than true autobiography, became a subject of critical debate.<ref name= Patey339>Patey, pp. 339\u201341</ref> Waugh's next major book was a biography of his longtime friend [[Ronald Knox]], the Catholic writer and theologian who had died in August 1957. Research and writing extended over two years during which Waugh did little other work, delaying the third volume of his war trilogy. In June 1958, his son Auberon was severely wounded in a shooting accident while serving with the army in [[Cyprus]]. Waugh remained detached; he neither went to Cyprus nor immediately visited Auberon on the latter's return to Britain. The critic and [[biography in literature|literary biographer]] David Wykes called Waugh's sang-froid \"astonishing\" and the family's apparent acceptance of his behaviour even more so.<ref>Wykes, p. 194</ref>\n\nAlthough most of Waugh's books had sold well, and he had been well-rewarded for his journalism, his levels of expenditure meant that money problems and tax bills were a recurrent feature in his life.<ref name= H591/> In 1950, as a means of [[tax avoidance]], he had set up a trust fund for his children (he termed it the \"Save the Children Fund\", after the [[Save the Children|well-established charity of that name]]) into which he placed the initial advance and all future royalties from the Penguin (paperback) editions of his books.<ref>Stannard, Vol II pp. 254\u201355</ref> He was able to augment his personal finances by charging household items to the trust or selling his own possessions to it.<ref name= StannardODNB/> Nonetheless, by 1960, shortage of money led him to agree to an interview on BBC Television, in the ''[[Face to Face (British TV series)|Face to Face]]'' series conducted by [[John Freeman (British politician)|John Freeman]]. The interview was broadcast on 26 June 1960; according to his biographer [[Selina Hastings (writer)|Selena Hastings]], Waugh restrained his instinctive hostility and coolly answered the questions put to him by Freeman, assuming what she describes as a \"pose of world-weary boredom\".<ref name= H591>Hastings, pp. 591\u201392</ref>\n\nIn 1960, Waugh was offered the honour of a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] but declined, believing that he should have been given the superior status of a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]].<ref>Stannard, Vol II pp. 415\u201316</ref> In September, he produced his final travel book, ''[[A Tourist in Africa]]'', based on a visit made in January\u2013March 1959. He enjoyed the trip but \"despised\" the book. The critic [[Cyril Connolly]] called it \"the thinnest piece of book-making that Mr Waugh has undertaken\".<ref>Patey, pp. 346\u201347</ref> The book done, he worked on the last of the war trilogy, which was published in 1961 as ''Unconditional Surrender''.<ref>Hastings, pp. 594\u201398</ref>\n\n===Decline and death===\n[[File:Evelyn Waugh Grave.jpg|thumb|upright|Waugh's grave in Combe Florey, adjacent to but not within the Anglican churchyard.]]\nAs he approached his sixties, Waugh was in poor health, prematurely aged, \"fat, deaf, short of breath\", according to Patey.<ref>Patey, p. 359</ref> His biographer Martin Stannard likened his appearance around this time to that of \"an exhausted rogue jollied up by drink\".<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 477</ref> In 1962 Waugh began work on his autobiography, and that same year wrote his final fiction, the long short story ''Basil Seal Rides Again''.

Waugh's agent, A.D. Peters, negotiated a settlement with the tax authorities for a manageable amount,<ref>Stannard, Vol. II p. 485</ref> but in his concern to generate funds, Waugh signed contracts to write several books, including a history of the papacy, an illustrated book on the Crusades and a second volume of autobiography.
