Singing is often done in an [[ensemble (music)|ensemble]] of musicians, such as a [[choir]] of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in [[art song]] or some [[jazz]] styles) up to a [[symphony orchestra]] or [[big band]]. Different singing styles include [[art music]] such as [[opera]] and [[Chinese opera]], [[Hindustani classical music|Indian music]] and [[religious music]] styles such as [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[traditional music]] styles, [[world music]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[ghazal]] and popular music styles such as [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[electronic dance music]] and [[filmi]] (Indian film songs).\n\nSinging can be formal or informal, arranged or improvised. It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort or ritual, as part of [[music education]] or as a profession. Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction and regular [[practice (learning method)|practice]]. If practice is done on a regular basis then the sounds can become more clear and strong.<ref name=\"Musicguides\">\n{{cite book\n |pages=26\n |series=[[Yehudi Menuhin]] music guides\n |title=Voice\n |editor-last=Falkner |editor-first=Keith | editor-link =Keith Falkner\n |location=London\n |publisher=MacDonald Young\n |year=1983\n |isbn=978-0-356-09099-3\n |oclc=10418423\n}}</ref> Professional singers usually build their [[career]]s around one specific [[musical genre]], such as [[Classical music|classical]] or [[Rock music|rock]], although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). Professional singers usually take [[vocal pedagogy|voice training]] provided by voice teachers or [[vocal coach]]es throughout their careers.\n\n==Voices   ==\n[[File:Gray1204.png|right|upright=1.35|thumb]]\n\nIn its physical aspect, singing has a well-defined technique that depends on the use of the lungs, which act as an air supply or [[bellows]]; on the [[larynx]], which acts as a [[reed (instrument)|reed]] or [[Vibrator (mechanical)|vibrator]]; on the [[chest]], head cavities and skeleton, which have the function of an [[amplifier]], as the tube in a [[wind instrument]]; and on the [[tongue]], which together with the [[palate]], [[teeth]], and [[lip]]s articulate and impose [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s on the amplified sound. Though these four mechanisms function independently, they are nevertheless coordinated in the establishment of a [[vocal technique]] and are made to interact upon one another.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/545880/singing\n |title=Singing\n |encyclopedia=[[Britannica Online Encyclopedia]]\n}}</ref> During passive breathing, air is inhaled with the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] while exhalation occurs without any effort. Exhalation may be aided by the [[abdominal]], [[internal intercostal]] and lower pelvis/pelvic muscles. Inhalation is aided by use of [[external intercostals]], [[scalenes]], and [[sternocleidomastoid muscles]]. The [[pitch (music)|pitch]] is altered with the [[vocal cords]]. With the lips closed, this is called [[humming]].\n\nThe sound of each individual's singing voice is entirely unique not only because of the actual shape and size of an individual's [[vocal cords]], but also due to the size and shape of the rest of that person's body. Humans have vocal folds which can loosen, tighten, or change their thickness, and over which breath can be transferred at varying pressures. The shape of the [[chest]] and [[neck]], the position of the [[tongue]], and the tightness of otherwise unrelated muscles can be altered. Any one of these actions results in a change in [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], volume ([[loudness]]), [[timbre]], or tone of the sound produced. Sound also resonates within different parts of the body and an individual's size and bone structure can affect the sound produced by an individual.\n\nSingers can also learn to project sound in certain ways so that it resonates better within their vocal tract. This is known as [[vocal resonation]]. Another major influence on vocal sound and production is the function of the larynx which people can manipulate in different ways to produce different sounds. These different kinds of laryngeal function are described as different kinds of [[vocal registers]].<ref name=\"Vennard\">polka dots\n{{cite book\n |title=Singing: the mechanism and the technic\n |last=Vennard |first=William | authorlink =William Vennard\n |year=1967\n |location=New York\n |publisher=[[Carl Fischer Music]]\n |isbn=978-0-8258-0055-9\n |oclc=248006248\n}}</ref> The primary method for singers to accomplish this is through the use of the [[formant|Singer's Formant]]; which has been shown to match particularly well to the most sensitive part of the [[ear|ear's]] frequency range.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |url=http://web.ku.edu/~cmed/923/Hunter1.pdf\n |last1=Hunter |first1=Eric J |last2=Titze |first2=Ingo R | authorlink2 =Ingo Titze\n |title=Overlap of hearing and voicing ranges in singing.\n |journal=[[Journal of Singing]]\n |volume=61\n |issue=4\n |year=2004\n |pages=387\u2013392\n|pmid=19844607 }}</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Hunter |first1=Eric J |last2=\u0160vec |first2=Jan G |last3=Titze |first3=Ingo R\n |title=Comparison of the produced and perceived voice range profiles in untrained and trained classical singers\n |journal=J Voice\n |date=December 2006\n |volume=20\n |issue=4\n |pages=513\u2013526\n |pmid=16325373\n |doi=10.1016/j.jvoice.2005.08.009\n|pmc=4782147}}</ref>\n\nIt has also been shown that a more powerful voice may be achieved with a fatter and fluid-like vocal fold mucosa.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14719965.300-whats-in-a-voice.html|title = What's in a voice|last = Titze|first = I.

Within [[speech pathology]], the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the [[vocal fry register]], the [[modal register]], the [[falsetto register]], and the [[whistle register]]. This view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogues.<ref name=\"McKinney 1994\" />\n\n=== Vocal resonation ===\n{{Main|Vocal resonation}}\n[[File:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of the head and neck]]\n\n'''Vocal resonation''' is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.<ref name=\"McKinney 1994\" /> There are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the [[chest]], the [[Vertebrate trachea|tracheal tree]], the [[larynx]] itself, the [[human pharynx|pharynx]], the [[human oral cavity|oral cavity]], the [[nasal cavity]], and the [[sinuses]].<ref name=\"Greene2001\">\n\n{{cite book\n |title= The voice and its disorders\n |last1=Greene |first1=Margaret |last2=Mathieson |first2=Lesley\n |year= 2001\n |publisher= [[John Wiley & Sons]]\n |edition=6th\n |isbn=978-1-86156-196-1\n |oclc=47831173\n}}</ref>\n\n===Chest voice and head voice===\n{{Main|Chest voice|Head voice}}\n\n''Chest voice'' and ''head voice'' are terms used within [[vocal music]]. The use of these terms varies widely within vocal pedagogical circles and there is currently no one consistent opinion among vocal music professionals in regards to these terms. Chest voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the [[vocal range]] or type of [[vocal register]]; a [[vocal resonance]] area; or a specific vocal timbre.<ref name=\"McKinney 1994\"/> Head voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the [[vocal range]] or type of [[vocal register]] or a [[vocal resonance]] area.<ref name=\"McKinney 1994\"/> In Men, the head voice is commonly referred to as the falsetto.\n\n====History and development====\nThe first recorded mention of the terms chest voice and head voice was around the 13th century, when it was distinguished from the \"throat voice\" (pectoris, guttoris, capitis\u2014at this time it is likely that head voice referred to the [[falsetto register]]) by the writers [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]] and [[Jerome of Moravia]].<ref name=\"groveONE\">\n{{cite book\n |title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music & Musicians\n  |editor1-last=Grove |editor1-first=George | editor1-link =George Grove\n |editor2-last=Sadie |editor2-first=Stanley | editor2link =Stanley Sadie\n |volume=6: Edmund to Fryklunde\n |isbn=978-1-56159-174-9\n |oclc=191123244\n |publisher=Macmillan\n |year=1980\n|title-link=The New Grove Dictionary of Music & Musicians }}</ref> The terms were later adopted within [[bel canto]], the Italian opera singing method, where chest voice was identified as the lowest and head voice the highest of three vocal registers: the chest, [[passagio]], and head registers.<ref name=Stark/> This approach is still taught by some [[vocal pedagogists]] today. Another current popular approach that is based on the bel canto model is to divide both men and women's voices into three registers. Men's voices are divided into \"chest register\", \"head register\", and \"falsetto register\" and woman's voices into \"chest register\", \"middle register\", and \"head register\". Such pedagogists teach that the head register is a [[vocal]] technique used in singing to describe the resonance felt in the singer's head.<ref name=\"Headv\">\n{{cite book\n |last=Clippinger |first=David Alva\n |title=The head voice and other problems: Practical talks on singing\n |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.156980 |publisher=[[Oliver Ditson]]\n |year=1917\n |page=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.156980/page/n28 12]\n }}{{Gutenberg|no=19493|name=Singing}}</ref>\n\nHowever, as knowledge of physiology has increased over the past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production. As a result, many vocal pedagogists, such as Ralph Appelman at [[Indiana University]] and [[William Vennard]] at the [[University of Southern California]], have redefined or even abandoned the use of the terms chest voice and head voice.<ref name=Stark /> In particular, the use of the terms ''chest register'' and ''head register'' have become controversial since [[vocal registration]] is more commonly seen today as a product of [[Larynx|laryngeal]] function that is unrelated to the physiology of the chest, lungs, and head. For this reason, many vocal pedagogists argue that it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the chest or head. They argue that the vibratory sensations which are felt in these areas are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to [[vocal resonance]], not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the terms ''chest voice'' and ''head voice'' over the term register. This view believes that the problems which people identify as register problems are really problems of resonance adjustment. This view is also in alignment with the views of other academic fields that study vocal registration including [[speech pathology]], [[phonetics]], and [[linguistics]]. Although both methods are still in use, current vocal pedagogical practice tends to adopt the newer more scientific view. Also, some vocal pedagogists take ideas from both viewpoints.<ref name=\"McKinney 1994\" />\n\nThe contemporary use of the term chest voice often refers to a specific kind of vocal coloration or vocal timbre. In classical singing, its use is limited entirely to the lower part of the [[modal register]] or normal voice. Within other forms of singing, chest voice is often applied throughout the [[modal register]]. Chest timbre can add a wonderful array of sounds to a singer's vocal interpretive palette.<ref name=\"Miller\">\n{{cite book\n |title= Solutions for singers\n |last=Miller |first=Richard | authorlink =Richard Miller (singer)\n |year=2004\n |location=Oxford\n |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n |pages=286\n |isbn=978-0-19-516005-5\n |oclc=51258100\n}}</ref>\nHowever, the use of overly strong chest voice in the higher registers in an attempt to hit higher notes in the chest can lead to forcing.

[[Composers]] who write vocal music must have an understanding of the skills, talents, and vocal properties of singers. '''Voice classification''' is the process by which human singing voices are evaluated and are thereby designated into [[voice types]]. These qualities include but are not limited to [[vocal range]], [[vocal weight]], [[vocal tessitura]], vocal [[timbre]], and [[vocal transition points]] such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and [[vocal registration]].<ref name=\"Shewan\">\n{{Cite journal\n |last=Shewan |first=Robert\n |date=January\u2013February 1979\n |title=Voice classification: An examination of methodology\n |journal=The NATS Bulletin\n |volume=35\n |issue=3\n |pages=17\u201327\n |issn=0884-8106\n |oclc=16072337\n}}</ref> The science behind voice classification developed within European [[classical music]] has been slow in adapting to more modern forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within [[opera]] to associate possible roles with potential voices. There are currently several different systems in use within classical music including the German ''[[Fach]]'' system and the choral music system among many others. No system is universally applied or accepted.<ref name=\"Stark\">\n{{cite book\n |title=Bel Canto: A history of vocal pedagogy\n |last=Stark |first=James\n |year=2003\n |location=Toronto\n |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]\n |isbn=978-0-8020-8614-3\n |oclc=53795639\n}}</ref>\n\nHowever, most classical music systems acknowledge seven different major voice categories. Women are typically divided into three groups: [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], and [[contralto]]. Men are usually divided into four groups: [[countertenor]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], and [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]]. When considering voices of pre-pubescent children an eighth term, [[Boy soprano|treble]], can be applied. Within each of these major categories, there are several sub-categories that identify specific vocal qualities like [[coloratura]] facility and [[vocal weight]] to differentiate between voices.<ref name=\"McKinney 1994\" />\n\nWithin [[choral music]], singers' voices are divided solely on the basis of [[vocal range]]. Choral music most commonly divides vocal parts into high and low voices within each sex (SATB, or soprano, alto, tenor, and bass). As a result, the typical choral situation gives many opportunities for misclassification to occur.<ref name=\"McKinney 1994\" /> Since most people have medium voices, they must be assigned to a part that is either too high or too low for them; the mezzo-soprano must sing soprano or alto and the baritone must sing tenor or bass. Either option can present problems for the singer, but for most singers, there are fewer dangers in singing too low than in singing too high.<ref name=\"Smith\">\n{{cite book\n |title=Choral pedagogy\n |first1=Brenda\n |last1=Smith\n |first2=Robert\n |last2=Thayer Sataloff\n |year=2005\n |location=San Diego, CA\n |publisher=Plural Publishing\n |isbn=978-1-59756-043-6\n |oclc=64198260\n}}</ref>\n\nWithin contemporary forms of music (sometimes referred to as [[contemporary commercial music]]), singers are classified by the [[music style|style of music]] they sing, such as jazz, pop, blues, soul, country, folk, and rock styles.

There are four physical processes involved in producing vocal sound: [[Breathing|respiration]], [[phonation]], [[vocal resonation|resonation]], and [[Place of articulation|articulation]]. These processes occur in the following sequence:\n# Breath is taken\n# Sound is initiated in the [[larynx]]\n# The vocal resonators receive the sound and influence it\n# The articulators shape the sound into recognizable units\n\nAlthough these four processes are often considered separately when studied, in actual practice, they merge into one coordinated function. With an effective singer or speaker, one should rarely be reminded of the process involved as their mind and body are so coordinated that one only perceives the resulting unified function. Many vocal problems result from a lack of coordination within this process.<ref name=\"Appelman\"/>\n\nSince singing is a coordinated act, it is difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in intensively on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions that it is hard to discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.\n\nOnce the voice student has become aware of the physical processes that make up the act of singing and of how those processes function, the student begins the task of trying to coordinate them. Inevitably, students and teachers will become more concerned with one area of the technique than another. The various processes may progress at different rates, with a resulting imbalance or lack of coordination. The areas of vocal technique which seem to depend most strongly on the student's ability to coordinate various functions are:<ref name=\"McKinney 1994\" />\n:\n# Extending the [[vocal range]] to its maximum potential\n# Developing consistent vocal production with a consistent tone quality\n# Developing flexibility and agility\n# Achieving a balanced [[vibrato]]\n#A blend of chest and head voice on every note of the range<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ramseyvoice.com/singing-techniques/|title=singing with a mix|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=|date=19 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Developing the singing voice====\nSinging is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Vocal exercises have several purposes, including<ref name=\"McKinney 1994\" /> warming up the voice; extending the vocal range; \"lining up\" the voice horizontally and vertically; and acquiring vocal techniques such as legato, staccato, control of dynamics, rapid figurations, learning to sing wide intervals comfortably, singing trills, singing melismas and correcting vocal faults.\n\nVocal pedagogists instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.<ref name=\"Appelman\" />\n\nLearning to sing is an activity that benefits from the involvement of an instructor. A singer does not hear the same sounds inside his or her head that others hear outside. Therefore, having a guide who can tell a student what kinds of sounds he or she is producing guides a singer to understand which of the internal sounds correspond to the desired sounds required by the style of singing the student aims to re-create.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n=== Health benefits ===\n\n==== Physical ====\n1.

May 16, 2014, from |url=http://howikis.com/How_much_can_a_singer_sing_before_they_reach_their_limit}}</ref> of one's vocal range without any obvious or distracting changes of quality or technique. Vocal pedagogists teach that a singer can only achieve this goal when all of the physical processes involved in singing (such as laryngeal action, breath support, resonance adjustment, and articulatory movement) are effectively working together. Most vocal pedagogists believe in coordinating these processes by (1) establishing good vocal habits in the most comfortable tessitura of the voice, and then (2) slowly expanding the range.<ref name=Vennard/>\n\nThere are three factors that significantly affect the ability to sing higher or lower:\n\n# The ''energy'' factor \u2013 \"energy\" has several connotations. It refers to the total response of the body to the making of sound; to a dynamic relationship between the breathing-in muscles and the breathing-out muscles known as the breath support mechanism; to the amount of breath pressure delivered to the vocal folds and their resistance to that pressure; and to the dynamic level of the sound.\n# The ''space'' factor \u2013 \"space\" refers to the size of the inside of the mouth and the position of the palate and larynx. Generally speaking, a singer's mouth should be opened wider the higher he or she sings. The internal space or position of the soft palate and larynx can be widened by relaxing the throat. Vocal pedagogists describe this as feeling like the \"beginning of a yawn\".\n# The ''depth'' factor \u2013 \"depth\" has two connotations. It refers to the actual physical sensations of depth in the body and vocal mechanism, and to mental concepts of depth that are related to tone quality.\n\nMcKinney says, \"These three factors can be expressed in three basic rules: (1) As you sing higher, you must use more energy; as you sing lower, you must use less. (2) As you sing higher, you must use more space; as you sing lower, you must use less. (3) As you sing higher, you must use more depth; as you sing lower, you must use less.\"<ref name=\"McKinney 1994\" />\n\n===Posture===\nThe singing process functions best when certain physical conditions of the body are put in place. The ability to move air in and out of the body freely and to obtain the needed quantity of air can be seriously affected by the posture of the various parts of the breathing mechanism. A sunken chest position will limit the capacity of the lungs, and a tense abdominal wall will inhibit the downward travel of the diaphragm. Good posture allows the breathing mechanism to fulfill its basic function efficiently without any undue expenditure of energy. Good posture also makes it easier to initiate phonation and to tune the resonators as proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension in the body. Vocal pedagogists have also noted that when singers assume good posture it often provides them with a greater sense of self-assurance and poise while performing. Audiences also tend to respond better to singers with good posture. Habitual good posture also ultimately improves the overall health of the body by enabling better blood circulation and preventing fatigue and stress on the body.<ref name=\"Vennard\"/>\n\nThere are eight components of the ideal singing posture:\n\n# Feet slightly apart\n# Legs straight but knees slightly bent\n# Hips facing straight forward\n# Spine aligned\n# Abdomen flat\n# Chest comfortably forward\n# Shoulders down and back\n# Head facing straight forward\n\n===Breathing and breath support===\nNatural breathing has three stages: a breathing-in period, a breathing out period, and a resting or recovery period; these stages are not usually consciously controlled. Within singing, there are four stages of breathing: a breathing-in period (inhalation); a setting up controls period (suspension); a controlled exhalation period (phonation); and a recovery period.\n\nThese stages must be under conscious control by the singer until they become conditioned reflexes. Many singers abandon conscious controls before their reflexes are fully conditioned which ultimately leads to chronic vocal problems.<ref name=Sundberg>\n{{Cite journal\n |author=Sundberg Johan\n |date=January\u2013February 1993\n |title=Breathing behavior during singing\n |journal=The NATS Journal\n |issn=0884-8106\n |oclc=16072337\n |volume=49\n |pages=2\u20139, 49\u201351\n |url=https://www.nats.org/_Library/Kennedy_JOS_Files_2013/JOS-049-3-1993-004.pdf\n |url-status=live\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529203123/https://www.nats.org/_Library/Kennedy_JOS_Files_2013/JOS-049-3-1993-004.pdf\n |archivedate=29 May 2019\n}}</ref>\n\n===Vibrato===\n[[Vibrato]] is a technique in which a sustained note wavers very quickly and consistently between a higher and a lower pitch, giving the note a slight quaver.

Many successful artists can sing a deep, rich vibrato.\n\n===Extended vocal technique===\n[[Extended vocal technique]]s include rapping, screaming, growling, overtones, falsetto, yodeling, using a microphone and sound system, among others.\n\n==Vocal music==\n{{Main|Vocal music}}\n'''Vocal music''' is [[music]] performed by one or more singers, which are typically called [[song]]s, and which may be performed with or without [[musical instruments|instrumental]] accompaniment, in which singing provides the main focus of the piece. Vocal music is probably the oldest form of music since it does not require any instrument or equipment besides the voice. All musical [[culture]]s have some form of vocal music and there are many long-standing singing traditions throughout the world's cultures. Music which employs singing but does not feature it prominently is generally considered as instrumental music. For example, some [[blues rock]] songs may have a short, simple call-and-response chorus, but the emphasis in the song is on the instrumental melodies and improvisation. Vocal music typically features sung words called [[lyrics]], although there are notable examples of vocal music that are performed using non-linguistic syllables or noises, sometimes as musical [[onomatopoeia]]. A short piece of vocal music with lyrics is broadly termed a [[song]], although, in [[classical music]], terms such as [[aria]] are typically used.\n\n===Genres of vocal music===\n{{Main|Music genre}}\n[[File:Divine trio 2016.jpg|thumb|A trio of female singers performing at the [[Berwaldhallen|Berwald Hall]] in 2016.]]\nVocal music is written in many different forms and styles which are often labeled within a particular genre of music. These genres include [[Hindustani classical music|Indian classical music]], [[Art music]], [[popular music]], [[traditional music]], regional and national music, and [[fusion genre|fusions]] of those genres. Within these larger genres are many subgenres. For example, popular music would encompass [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[country music]], [[easy listening]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[rock music]], and several other genres. There may also be a subgenre within a subgenre such as [[vocalese]] and [[scat singing]] in jazz.\n\n====Popular and traditional music====\nIn many modern pop [[musical group]]s, a lead singer performs the primary vocals or [[melody]] of a [[song]], as opposed to a [[Backing vocalist|backing singer]] who sings backup vocals or the [[harmony]] of a song. Backing vocalists sing some, but usually not all, parts of the song often singing only in a song's refrain or [[Hum (sound)|humming]] in the background. An exception is five-part [[Gospel music|gospel]] [[a cappella]] music, where the lead is the highest of the five voices and sings a [[descant]] and not the [[melody]]. Some artists may sing both the lead and backing vocals on audio recordings by overlapping recorded vocal tracks.\n\nPopular music includes a range of vocal styles. [[Hip-hop]] uses [[rapping]], the [[rhythm]]ic delivery of [[rhyme]]s in a rhythmic speech over a [[beats (music)|beat]] or without accompaniment. Some types of rapping consist mostly or entirely of speech and chanting, like the Jamaican \"[[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]]\". In some types of rapping, the performers may interpolate short sung or half-sung passages. [[Blues]] singing is based on the use of the [[blue note]]s\u2013notes sung at a slightly lower pitch than that of the major scale for expressive purposes. In [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hardcore punk]] subgenres, vocal styles can include techniques such as [[screaming (music)|screams]], shouts, and unusual sounds such as the \"[[death growl]]\".\n\nOne difference between live performances in the popular and Classical genres is that whereas Classical performers often sing without amplification in small- to mid-size halls, in popular music, a [[microphone]] and [[PA system]] (amplifier and speakers) are used in almost all performance venues, even a small coffee house. The use of the microphone has had several impacts on popular music. For one, it facilitated the development of intimate, expressive singing styles such as \"[[crooning]]\" which would not have enough projection and volume if done without a microphone. As well, pop singers who use microphones can do a range of other vocal styles that would not project without amplification, such as making whispering sounds, humming, and mixing half-sung and sung tones. As well, some performers use the microphone's response patterns to create effects, such as bringing the mic very close to the mouth to get an enhanced bass response, or, in the case of hip-hop [[beatboxer]]s, doing plosive \"p\" and \"b\" sounds into the mic to create percussive effects. In the 2000s, controversy arose over the widespread use of electronic [[Auto-Tune]] [[pitch correction]] devices with recorded and live popular music vocals. Controversy has also arisen due to cases where pop singers have been found to be [[lip-syncing in music|lip-syncing]] to a pre-recorded recording of their vocal performance or, in the case of the controversial act [[Milli Vanilli]], lip-syncing to tracks recorded by other uncredited singers.\n\nWhile some bands use backup singers who only sing when they are onstage, it is common for backup singers in popular music to have other roles. In many [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] bands, the musicians doing backup vocals also play instruments, such as [[rhythm guitar]], electric bass, or drums. In [[Music of Latin America|Latin]] or [[Music of Cuba#African heritage|Afro-Cuban]] groups, backup singers may play percussion instruments or shakers while singing. In some pop and [[hip-hop]] groups and in [[musical theater]], the backup singers may be required to perform elaborately choreographed dance routines while they sing through headset microphones.\n\n==Careers==\n[[File:Sketches_of_women_at_audition_for_the_chorus_at_Delmar_Garden_theater_in_St._Louis,_1906.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|right|Sketches by artist [[Marguerite Martyn]] of women trying out for the chorus at the Delmar Theater in St. Louis in May 1906, with quotations from some of those pictured]]\nThe salaries and working conditions for vocalists vary a great deal. While jobs in other music fields such as music education choir conductors tend to be based on full-time, salaried positions, singing jobs tend to be based on contracts for individual shows or performances, or for a sequence of shows\n\nAspiring singers and vocalists must have musical skill, an excellent voice, the ability to work with people, and a sense of showmanship and drama.  Additionally, singers need to have the ambition and drive to continually study and improve,<ref name=\"careers\">{{cite web |url=http://www.menc.org |title=National Association for Music Education (NAfME) |website=Menc.org |date=29 June 2017 |accessdate=22 July 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420155809/http://www.menc.org/ |archivedate=20 April 2012 }}</ref>\nProfessional singers continue to seek out [[vocal coach]]ing to hone their skills, extend their range, and learn new styles. As well, aspiring singers need to gain specialized skills in the vocal techniques used to interpret songs, learn about the vocal literature from their chosen style of music, and gain skills in choral music techniques, [[sight singing]] and memorizing songs, and vocal exercises.\n\nSome singers learn other music jobs, such as the [[Composing (music)|composing]], [[Music Producer|music producing]] and [[songwriting]]. Some singers put videos on [[YouTube]] and [[Streaming media|streaming]] apps. Singers market themselves to buyers of vocal talent, by doing [[audition]]s in front of a [[music director]]. Depending on the style of vocal music that a person has trained in, the \"talent buyers\" that they seek out may be [[record company]], [[A&R]] representatives, [[music director]]s, choir directors, nightclub managers, or concert promoters. A CD or DVD with excerpts of vocal performances is used to demonstrate a singer's skills. Some singers hire an agent or manager to help them to seek out paid engagements and other performance opportunities; the agent or manager is often paid by receiving a percentage of the fees that the singer gets from performing onstage.\n\n==Singing competitions==\nThere are several television shows that showcase singing. ''[[American Idol]]'' was launched in 2002. The first singing reality show was ''[[Sa Re Ga Ma Pa]]'' launched by [[Zee TV]] in the 1995.<ref name=\"year\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scoopwhoop.com/Contestants-On-SaReGaMaPa/|title=Contestants on Saregamapa|accessdate=6 July 2017|date=10 March 2016}}</ref> At the ''[[American Idol]]'' Contestants audition in front of a panel of judges to see if they can move on to the next round in Hollywood, from then, the competition begins. The field of contestants is narrowed down week by week until a winner is chosen. To move on to the next round, the contestants' fate is determined by a vote by viewers. ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'' is another singing competition program. Similar to ''American Idol'', the contestants audition in front of a panel of judges, however, the judges' chairs are faced towards the audience during the performance. If the coaches are interested in the artist, they will press their button signifying they want to coach them. Once the auditions conclude, coaches have their team of artists and the competition begins. Coaches then mentor their artists and they compete to find the best singer. Other well-known singing competitions include ''[[The X Factor]]'', ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', ''[[Rising Star (TV series)|Rising Star]]'' and ''[[The Sing-Off]]''.\n\n==Health benefits==\nScientific studies suggest that singing can have positive effects on people's health.  A preliminary study based on self-reported data from a survey of students participating in choral singing found perceived benefits including increased lung capacity, improved mood, stress reduction, as well as perceived social and spiritual benefits.<ref name=\"Clift2001\">\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Clift |first1=SM |last2=Hancox |first2=G\n |title=The perceived benefits of singing\n |journal=The Journal of the Royal Society for the Promotion of Health\n |volume=121\n |issue=4\n |pages=248\u2013256\n |year=2001\n |doi=10.1177/146642400112100409\n |pmid=11811096\n|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/416b9cb5eba129711bcc6e1542341d4104b0dfd9 }}</ref> However, one much older study of lung capacity compared those with professional vocal training to those without, and failed to back up the claims of increased lung capacity.<ref name=\"Heller1960\">\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Heller |first1=Stanley S |last2=Hicks |first2=William R |last3=Root |first3=Walter S\n |title=Lung volumes of singers\n |journal=[[J Appl Physiol]]\n |volume=15\n |issue=1\n |pages=40\u201342\n |year=1960\n |pmid=14400875\n|doi=10.1152/jappl.1960.15.1.40 }}</ref> Singing may positively influence the [[immune system]] through the reduction of [[stress (medicine)|stress]].

When they step on stage, many singers forget their worries and focus solely on the song. Singing is becoming a more widely known method of increasing an individual's overall health and wellness, in turn helping them to battle diseases such as cancer more effectively due to decreased stress, releasing of endorphins, and increased lung capacity.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Chronicle-Herald|last=Clarke|first=Heather Laura|date=20 June 2014|id = {{ProQuest|1774037978}}}}</ref>\n\n=== Effect on the brain ===\nJohn Daniel Scott, among others, have cited that \"people who sing are more likely to be happy\". This is because \"singing elevates the levels of neurotransmitters which are associated with pleasure and well being\". Humans have a long prehistory of music, especially singing; before written language, stories were passed down through song,{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} because song is often more memorable. There is also evidence that music or singing may have evolved in humans before language. Levitin, in his ''This is Your Brain on Music'', argues that \"music may be the activity that prepared our pre-human ancestors for speech communication\" and that \"singing ... might have helped our species to refine motor skills, paving the way for the development of the exquisitely fine muscle control required for vocal ... speech\" (260).<ref name=\"brain on music\">{{Cite book|title = This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession|last = Levitin|first = Daniel J.|publisher = Plume|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0-452-28852-2|location = New York}}</ref> On the other hand, he cites Pinker, who \"argued that language is an adaptation and music is its [[Spandrel (biology)|Spandrel]] ... an evolutionary accident piggybacking on language\" (248).<ref name=\"brain on music\" />\n\nStudies have found evidence suggesting the mental, as well as physical, benefits of singing. When conducting a study with 21 members of a choir at three different points over one year, three themes suggested three areas of benefits; the social impact (connectedness with others), personal impact (positive emotions, self-perception, etc.), and functional outcomes (health benefits of being in the choir). Findings showed that a sense of wellbeing is associated with singing, by uplifting the mood of the participants and releasing endorphins in the brain. Many singers also reported that the singing helped then regulate stress and relax, allowing them to deal better with their daily lives. From a social perspective, approval from the audience, and interaction with other choir members in a positive manner is also beneficial.\n\nSinging is beneficial for pregnant mothers. By giving them another medium of communication with their newborns, mothers in one study reported feelings of love and affection when singing to their unborn children. They also reported feeling more relaxed than ever before during their stressful pregnancy. A song can have nostalgic significance by reminding a singer of the past, and momentarily transport them, allowing them to focus on singing and embrace the activity as an escape from their daily lives and problems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dingle|first=Genevieve|year=2012|title=\"To be heard\": The social and mental health benefits of choir singing for disadvantaged adults|doi=10.1177/0305735611430081|journal=Psychology of Music|volume=41|issue=4|pages=405\u2013421|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:267353/UQ267353_post_print.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Effect on body===\nA recent study by [[Tenovus Cancer Care]] found that singing in a choir for just one hour boosts levels of immune proteins in cancer patients and has a positive overall effect on the health of patients. The study explores the possibility that singing could help put patients in the best mental and physical shape to receive the treatment they need, by reducing stress hormones, and increasing quantities of cytokines- proteins of the immune system that can increase the body's ability to fight disease. \"Singing gives you physical benefits like breath control and muscle movement and enunciation, as well as the learning benefits of processing information\" says a musical director and accompanist in the study. The enunciation and speech benefits tie into the language benefits detailed below.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160404221004.htm|title=Choir singing boosts immune system activity in cancer patients and carers, study shows|last=sciencedaily|first=from ecancermedicalscience|date=4 April 2016|access-date=10 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nSome have advocated, as in an 2011 article in the ''Toronto Star'', that everyone to sing, even if they are not musically talented, because of its health benefits. Singing lowers blood pressure by releasing pent up emotions, boosting relaxation and reminding them of happy times. It also allows singers to breathe more easily. Patients with lung disease and chronic pulmonary disease experience relief from their symptoms from singing just two times a week. In addition to breathing related illness, singing also has numerous benefits for stroke victims when it comes to relearning the ability to speak and communicate by singing their thoughts. Singing activates the right side of the brain when the left side cannot function (the left side is the area of the brain responsible for speech), so it is easy to see how singing can be an excellent alternative to speech while the victim heals.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2011/04/25/you_docs_5_reasons_to_sing_even_if_you_cant_carry_a_tune.html|title=You Docs: 5 reasons to sing \u2013 even if you can't carry a tune|author1=Dr. Oz|author2=Dr. Roizen|date=25 April 2011|work=The Star|access-date=25 November 2011|via=Proquest|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328062517/https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2011/04/25/you_docs_5_reasons_to_sing_even_if_you_cant_carry_a_tune.html|archivedate=28 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Singing and language ==\nEvery natural or non-natural language has its own intrinsic musicality which affects singing by means of pitch, phrasing and accent.\n\n=== Neurological aspects ===\nMuch research has been done recently on the link between music and language, especially singing. It is becoming increasingly clear that these two processes are very much alike, and yet also different. Levitin describes how, beginning with the eardrum, sound waves are translated into pitch, or a [[Tonotopy|tonotopic map]], and then shortly thereafter \"speech and music probably diverge into separate processing circuits\" (130).<ref name=\"brain on music\" /> There is evidence that neural circuits used for music and language may start out in infants undifferentiated. There are several areas of the brain that are used for both language and music. For example, [[Brodmann area 47]], which has been implicated in the processing of [[syntax]] in oral and sign languages, as well as musical syntax and semantic aspects of language. Levitin recounts how in certain studies, \"listening to music and attending its syntactic features,\" similar to the syntactic processes in language, activated this part of the brain. In addition, \"musical syntax ... has been localized to ... areas adjacent to and overlapping with those regions that process speech syntax, such as [[Broca's area]]\" and \"the regions involved in musical semantics ..  appear to be [localized] near [[Wernicke's area]].\" Both Broca's area and Wernicke's area are important steps in language processing and production.\n\nSinging has been shown to help stroke victims recover speech. According to neurologist Gottfried Schlaug, there is a corresponding area to that of speech, which resides in the left hemisphere, on the right side of the brain.<ref>{{cite news|title = Singing 'rewires' damaged brain |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8526699.stm |work = BBC News|date = 21 February 2010|access-date = 2015-12-06 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217025939/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8526699.stm |archivedate=17 December 2018}}</ref> This is casually known as the \"singing center.\" By teaching stroke victims to sing their words, this can help train this area of the brain for speech. In support of this theory, Levitin asserts that \"regional specificity,\" such as that for speech, \"may be temporary, as the processing centers for important mental functions actually move to other regions after trauma or brain damage.\"<ref name=\"brain on music\" /> Thus in the right hemisphere of the brain, the \"singing center\" may be [[neuroplasticity|retrained]] to help produce speech.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://musicianbrain.gottfriedschlaug.org/papers/Loui_Wan_Schlaug_2010_Acoustics_Today.pdf |journal=Acoustics Today |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=28\u201336 | date=July 2010 |authors=Psyche Loui, Catherine Y.

When people sing, they generally use the accent or neutral accent that is used in the style of music they are singing in, rather than a regional accent or dialect; the style of music and the popular center/region of the style has more influence on the singing accent of a person than where they come from. For example, in the English language, British singers of rock or popular music often sing in an American accent or neutral accent instead of an English accent.<ref>{{cite web|last=Alleyne|first=Richard|title=Rock 'n' roll best sung in American accents|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/7922639/Rock-n-roll-best-sung-in-American-accents.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=2 August 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806003228/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/7922639/Rock-n-roll-best-sung-in-American-accents.html|archivedate=6 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Anderson|first=L.V.|title=Why Do British Singers Sound American?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/explainer/2012/11/skyfall_theme_song_by_adele_why_do_british_singers_sound_american.html|magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Singing animals ==\nScholars agree that singing is strongly present in many different species.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Marler | first1 = Peter | year = 1970 | title = Birdsong and speech development: Could there be parallels? | journal = American Scientist | volume = 58 | issue = 6| pages = 669\u201373 | pmid = 5480089 | jstor = 27829317}}</ref><ref>Wallin, Nils, Bjorn Merker, Steven Brown.

Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in [[art song]] or some [[jazz]] styles) up to a [[symphony orchestra]] or [[big band]]. Different singing styles include [[art music]] such as [[opera]] and [[Chinese opera]], [[Hindustani classical music|Indian music]] and [[religious music]] styles such as [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[traditional music]] styles, [[world music]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[ghazal]] and popular music styles such as [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[electronic dance music]] and [[filmi]] (Indian film songs).\n\nSinging can be formal or informal, arranged or improvised. It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort or ritual, as part of [[music education]] or as a profession.

Though these four mechanisms function independently, they are nevertheless coordinated in the establishment of a [[vocal technique]] and are made to interact upon one another.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/545880/singing\n |title=Singing\n |encyclopedia=[[Britannica Online Encyclopedia]]\n}}</ref> During passive breathing, air is inhaled with the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] while exhalation occurs without any effort. Exhalation may be aided by the [[abdominal]], [[internal intercostal]] and lower pelvis/pelvic muscles. Inhalation is aided by use of [[external intercostals]], [[scalenes]], and [[sternocleidomastoid muscles]]. The [[pitch (music)|pitch]] is altered with the [[vocal cords]]. With the lips closed, this is called [[humming]].\n\nThe sound of each individual's singing voice is entirely unique not only because of the actual shape and size of an individual's [[vocal cords]], but also due to the size and shape of the rest of that person's body. Humans have vocal folds which can loosen, tighten, or change their thickness, and over which breath can be transferred at varying pressures. The shape of the [[chest]] and [[neck]], the position of the [[tongue]], and the tightness of otherwise unrelated muscles can be altered. Any one of these actions results in a change in [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], volume ([[loudness]]), [[timbre]], or tone of the sound produced. Sound also resonates within different parts of the body and an individual's size and bone structure can affect the sound produced by an individual.\n\nSingers can also learn to project sound in certain ways so that it resonates better within their vocal tract. This is known as [[vocal resonation]]. Another major influence on vocal sound and production is the function of the larynx which people can manipulate in different ways to produce different sounds. These different kinds of laryngeal function are described as different kinds of [[vocal registers]].<ref name=\"Vennard\">polka dots\n{{cite book\n |title=Singing: the mechanism and the technic\n |last=Vennard |first=William | authorlink =William Vennard\n |year=1967\n |location=New York\n |publisher=[[Carl Fischer Music]]\n |isbn=978-0-8258-0055-9\n |oclc=248006248\n}}</ref> The primary method for singers to accomplish this is through the use of the [[formant|Singer's Formant]]; which has been shown to match particularly well to the most sensitive part of the [[ear|ear's]] frequency range.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |url=http://web.ku.edu/~cmed/923/Hunter1.pdf\n |last1=Hunter |first1=Eric J |last2=Titze |first2=Ingo R | authorlink2 =Ingo Titze\n |title=Overlap of hearing and voicing ranges in singing.\n |journal=[[Journal of Singing]]\n |volume=61\n |issue=4\n |year=2004\n |pages=387\u2013392\n|pmid=19844607 }}</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Hunter |first1=Eric J |last2=\u0160vec |first2=Jan G |last3=Titze |first3=Ingo R\n |title=Comparison of the produced and perceived voice range profiles in untrained and trained classical singers\n |journal=J Voice\n |date=December 2006\n |volume=20\n |issue=4\n |pages=513\u2013526\n |pmid=16325373\n |doi=10.1016/j.jvoice.2005.08.009\n|pmc=4782147}}</ref>\n\nIt has also been shown that a more powerful voice may be achieved with a fatter and fluid-like vocal fold mucosa.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14719965.300-whats-in-a-voice.html|title = What's in a voice|last = Titze|first = I.

A register in the voice is a particular series of tones, produced in the same vibratory pattern of the [[vocal fold]]s, and possessing the same quality. Registers originate in [[larynx|laryngeal]] function.

Within [[speech pathology]], the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the [[vocal fry register]], the [[modal register]], the [[falsetto register]], and the [[whistle register]]. This view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogues.<ref name=\"McKinney 1994\" />\n\n=== Vocal resonation ===\n{{Main|Vocal resonation}}\n[[File:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of the head and neck]]\n\n'''Vocal resonation''' is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.<ref name=\"McKinney 1994\" /> There are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the [[chest]], the [[Vertebrate trachea|tracheal tree]], the [[larynx]] itself, the [[human pharynx|pharynx]], the [[human oral cavity|oral cavity]], the [[nasal cavity]], and the [[sinuses]].<ref name=\"Greene2001\">\n\n{{cite book\n |title= The voice and its disorders\n |last1=Greene |first1=Margaret |last2=Mathieson |first2=Lesley\n |year= 2001\n |publisher= [[John Wiley & Sons]]\n |edition=6th\n |isbn=978-1-86156-196-1\n |oclc=47831173\n}}</ref>\n\n===Chest voice and head voice===\n{{Main|Chest voice|Head voice}}\n\n''Chest voice'' and ''head voice'' are terms used within [[vocal music]]. The use of these terms varies widely within vocal pedagogical circles and there is currently no one consistent opinion among vocal music professionals in regards to these terms. Chest voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the [[vocal range]] or type of [[vocal register]]; a [[vocal resonance]] area; or a specific vocal timbre.<ref name=\"McKinney 1994\"/> Head voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the [[vocal range]] or type of [[vocal register]] or a [[vocal resonance]] area.<ref name=\"McKinney 1994\"/> In Men, the head voice is commonly referred to as the falsetto.\n\n====History and development====\nThe first recorded mention of the terms chest voice and head voice was around the 13th century, when it was distinguished from the \"throat voice\" (pectoris, guttoris, capitis\u2014at this time it is likely that head voice referred to the [[falsetto register]]) by the writers [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]] and [[Jerome of Moravia]].<ref name=\"groveONE\">\n{{cite book\n |title=The New Grove Dictionary of Music & Musicians\n  |editor1-last=Grove |editor1-first=George | editor1-link =George Grove\n |editor2-last=Sadie |editor2-first=Stanley | editor2link =Stanley Sadie\n |volume=6: Edmund to Fryklunde\n |isbn=978-1-56159-174-9\n |oclc=191123244\n |publisher=Macmillan\n |year=1980\n|title-link=The New Grove Dictionary of Music & Musicians }}</ref> The terms were later adopted within [[bel canto]], the Italian opera singing method, where chest voice was identified as the lowest and head voice the highest of three vocal registers: the chest, [[passagio]], and head registers.<ref name=Stark/> This approach is still taught by some [[vocal pedagogists]] today. Another current popular approach that is based on the bel canto model is to divide both men and women's voices into three registers. Men's voices are divided into \"chest register\", \"head register\", and \"falsetto register\" and woman's voices into \"chest register\", \"middle register\", and \"head register\". Such pedagogists teach that the head register is a [[vocal]] technique used in singing to describe the resonance felt in the singer's head.<ref name=\"Headv\">\n{{cite book\n |last=Clippinger |first=David Alva\n |title=The head voice and other problems: Practical talks on singing\n |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.156980 |publisher=[[Oliver Ditson]]\n |year=1917\n |page=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.156980/page/n28 12]\n }}{{Gutenberg|no=19493|name=Singing}}</ref>\n\nHowever, as knowledge of physiology has increased over the past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production. As a result, many vocal pedagogists, such as Ralph Appelman at [[Indiana University]] and [[William Vennard]] at the [[University of Southern California]], have redefined or even abandoned the use of the terms chest voice and head voice.<ref name=Stark /> In particular, the use of the terms ''chest register'' and ''head register'' have become controversial since [[vocal registration]] is more commonly seen today as a product of [[Larynx|laryngeal]] function that is unrelated to the physiology of the chest, lungs, and head. For this reason, many vocal pedagogists argue that it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the chest or head. They argue that the vibratory sensations which are felt in these areas are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to [[vocal resonance]], not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the terms ''chest voice'' and ''head voice'' over the term register. This view believes that the problems which people identify as register problems are really problems of resonance adjustment. This view is also in alignment with the views of other academic fields that study vocal registration including [[speech pathology]], [[phonetics]], and [[linguistics]]. Although both methods are still in use, current vocal pedagogical practice tends to adopt the newer more scientific view. Also, some vocal pedagogists take ideas from both viewpoints.<ref name=\"McKinney 1994\" />\n\nThe contemporary use of the term chest voice often refers to a specific kind of vocal coloration or vocal timbre. In classical singing, its use is limited entirely to the lower part of the [[modal register]] or normal voice. Within other forms of singing, chest voice is often applied throughout the [[modal register]]. Chest timbre can add a wonderful array of sounds to a singer's vocal interpretive palette.<ref name=\"Miller\">\n{{cite book\n |title= Solutions for singers\n |last=Miller |first=Richard | authorlink =Richard Miller (singer)\n |year=2004\n |location=Oxford\n |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]\n |pages=286\n |isbn=978-0-19-516005-5\n |oclc=51258100\n}}</ref>\nHowever, the use of overly strong chest voice in the higher registers in an attempt to hit higher notes in the chest can lead to forcing.

[[Composers]] who write vocal music must have an understanding of the skills, talents, and vocal properties of singers. '''Voice classification''' is the process by which human singing voices are evaluated and are thereby designated into [[voice types]]. These qualities include but are not limited to [[vocal range]], [[vocal weight]], [[vocal tessitura]], vocal [[timbre]], and [[vocal transition points]] such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and [[vocal registration]].<ref name=\"Shewan\">\n{{Cite journal\n |last=Shewan |first=Robert\n |date=January\u2013February 1979\n |title=Voice classification: An examination of methodology\n |journal=The NATS Bulletin\n |volume=35\n |issue=3\n |pages=17\u201327\n |issn=0884-8106\n |oclc=16072337\n}}</ref> The science behind voice classification developed within European [[classical music]] has been slow in adapting to more modern forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within [[opera]] to associate possible roles with potential voices. There are currently several different systems in use within classical music including the German ''[[Fach]]'' system and the choral music system among many others. No system is universally applied or accepted.<ref name=\"Stark\">\n{{cite book\n |title=Bel Canto: A history of vocal pedagogy\n |last=Stark |first=James\n |year=2003\n |location=Toronto\n |publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]\n |isbn=978-0-8020-8614-3\n |oclc=53795639\n}}</ref>\n\nHowever, most classical music systems acknowledge seven different major voice categories. Women are typically divided into three groups: [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], and [[contralto]]. Men are usually divided into four groups: [[countertenor]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], and [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]]. When considering voices of pre-pubescent children an eighth term, [[Boy soprano|treble]], can be applied. Within each of these major categories, there are several sub-categories that identify specific vocal qualities like [[coloratura]] facility and [[vocal weight]] to differentiate between voices.<ref name=\"McKinney 1994\" />\n\nWithin [[choral music]], singers' voices are divided solely on the basis of [[vocal range]]. Choral music most commonly divides vocal parts into high and low voices within each sex (SATB, or soprano, alto, tenor, and bass). As a result, the typical choral situation gives many opportunities for misclassification to occur.<ref name=\"McKinney 1994\" /> Since most people have medium voices, they must be assigned to a part that is either too high or too low for them; the mezzo-soprano must sing soprano or alto and the baritone must sing tenor or bass.

There are four physical processes involved in producing vocal sound: [[Breathing|respiration]], [[phonation]], [[vocal resonation|resonation]], and [[Place of articulation|articulation]]. These processes occur in the following sequence:\n# Breath is taken\n# Sound is initiated in the [[larynx]]\n# The vocal resonators receive the sound and influence it\n# The articulators shape the sound into recognizable units\n\nAlthough these four processes are often considered separately when studied, in actual practice, they merge into one coordinated function. With an effective singer or speaker, one should rarely be reminded of the process involved as their mind and body are so coordinated that one only perceives the resulting unified function. Many vocal problems result from a lack of coordination within this process.<ref name=\"Appelman\"/>\n\nSince singing is a coordinated act, it is difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in intensively on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions that it is hard to discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.\n\nOnce the voice student has become aware of the physical processes that make up the act of singing and of how those processes function, the student begins the task of trying to coordinate them. Inevitably, students and teachers will become more concerned with one area of the technique than another. The various processes may progress at different rates, with a resulting imbalance or lack of coordination. The areas of vocal technique which seem to depend most strongly on the student's ability to coordinate various functions are:<ref name=\"McKinney 1994\" />\n:\n# Extending the [[vocal range]] to its maximum potential\n# Developing consistent vocal production with a consistent tone quality\n# Developing flexibility and agility\n# Achieving a balanced [[vibrato]]\n#A blend of chest and head voice on every note of the range<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ramseyvoice.com/singing-techniques/|title=singing with a mix|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=|date=19 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Developing the singing voice====\nSinging is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Vocal exercises have several purposes, including<ref name=\"McKinney 1994\" /> warming up the voice; extending the vocal range; \"lining up\" the voice horizontally and vertically; and acquiring vocal techniques such as legato, staccato, control of dynamics, rapid figurations, learning to sing wide intervals comfortably, singing trills, singing melismas and correcting vocal faults.\n\nVocal pedagogists instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.<ref name=\"Appelman\" />\n\nLearning to sing is an activity that benefits from the involvement of an instructor. A singer does not hear the same sounds inside his or her head that others hear outside. Therefore, having a guide who can tell a student what kinds of sounds he or she is producing guides a singer to understand which of the internal sounds correspond to the desired sounds required by the style of singing the student aims to re-create.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n=== Health benefits ===\n\n==== Physical ====\n1.

May 16, 2014, from |url=http://howikis.com/How_much_can_a_singer_sing_before_they_reach_their_limit}}</ref> of one's vocal range without any obvious or distracting changes of quality or technique. Vocal pedagogists teach that a singer can only achieve this goal when all of the physical processes involved in singing (such as laryngeal action, breath support, resonance adjustment, and articulatory movement) are effectively working together. Most vocal pedagogists believe in coordinating these processes by (1) establishing good vocal habits in the most comfortable tessitura of the voice, and then (2) slowly expanding the range.<ref name=Vennard/>\n\nThere are three factors that significantly affect the ability to sing higher or lower:\n\n# The ''energy'' factor \u2013 \"energy\" has several connotations. It refers to the total response of the body to the making of sound; to a dynamic relationship between the breathing-in muscles and the breathing-out muscles known as the breath support mechanism; to the amount of breath pressure delivered to the vocal folds and their resistance to that pressure; and to the dynamic level of the sound.\n# The ''space'' factor \u2013 \"space\" refers to the size of the inside of the mouth and the position of the palate and larynx. Generally speaking, a singer's mouth should be opened wider the higher he or she sings. The internal space or position of the soft palate and larynx can be widened by relaxing the throat. Vocal pedagogists describe this as feeling like the \"beginning of a yawn\".\n# The ''depth'' factor \u2013 \"depth\" has two connotations. It refers to the actual physical sensations of depth in the body and vocal mechanism, and to mental concepts of depth that are related to tone quality.\n\nMcKinney says, \"These three factors can be expressed in three basic rules: (1) As you sing higher, you must use more energy; as you sing lower, you must use less. (2) As you sing higher, you must use more space; as you sing lower, you must use less. (3) As you sing higher, you must use more depth; as you sing lower, you must use less.\"<ref name=\"McKinney 1994\" />\n\n===Posture===\nThe singing process functions best when certain physical conditions of the body are put in place. The ability to move air in and out of the body freely and to obtain the needed quantity of air can be seriously affected by the posture of the various parts of the breathing mechanism. A sunken chest position will limit the capacity of the lungs, and a tense abdominal wall will inhibit the downward travel of the diaphragm. Good posture allows the breathing mechanism to fulfill its basic function efficiently without any undue expenditure of energy. Good posture also makes it easier to initiate phonation and to tune the resonators as proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension in the body. Vocal pedagogists have also noted that when singers assume good posture it often provides them with a greater sense of self-assurance and poise while performing. Audiences also tend to respond better to singers with good posture. Habitual good posture also ultimately improves the overall health of the body by enabling better blood circulation and preventing fatigue and stress on the body.<ref name=\"Vennard\"/>\n\nThere are eight components of the ideal singing posture:\n\n# Feet slightly apart\n# Legs straight but knees slightly bent\n# Hips facing straight forward\n# Spine aligned\n# Abdomen flat\n# Chest comfortably forward\n# Shoulders down and back\n# Head facing straight forward\n\n===Breathing and breath support===\nNatural breathing has three stages: a breathing-in period, a breathing out period, and a resting or recovery period; these stages are not usually consciously controlled. Within singing, there are four stages of breathing: a breathing-in period (inhalation); a setting up controls period (suspension); a controlled exhalation period (phonation); and a recovery period.\n\nThese stages must be under conscious control by the singer until they become conditioned reflexes. Many singers abandon conscious controls before their reflexes are fully conditioned which ultimately leads to chronic vocal problems.<ref name=Sundberg>\n{{Cite journal\n |author=Sundberg Johan\n |date=January\u2013February 1993\n |title=Breathing behavior during singing\n |journal=The NATS Journal\n |issn=0884-8106\n |oclc=16072337\n |volume=49\n |pages=2\u20139, 49\u201351\n |url=https://www.nats.org/_Library/Kennedy_JOS_Files_2013/JOS-049-3-1993-004.pdf\n |url-status=live\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529203123/https://www.nats.org/_Library/Kennedy_JOS_Files_2013/JOS-049-3-1993-004.pdf\n |archivedate=29 May 2019\n}}</ref>\n\n===Vibrato===\n[[Vibrato]] is a technique in which a sustained note wavers very quickly and consistently between a higher and a lower pitch, giving the note a slight quaver.

Many successful artists can sing a deep, rich vibrato.\n\n===Extended vocal technique===\n[[Extended vocal technique]]s include rapping, screaming, growling, overtones, falsetto, yodeling, using a microphone and sound system, among others.\n\n==Vocal music==\n{{Main|Vocal music}}\n'''Vocal music''' is [[music]] performed by one or more singers, which are typically called [[song]]s, and which may be performed with or without [[musical instruments|instrumental]] accompaniment, in which singing provides the main focus of the piece. Vocal music is probably the oldest form of music since it does not require any instrument or equipment besides the voice. All musical [[culture]]s have some form of vocal music and there are many long-standing singing traditions throughout the world's cultures. Music which employs singing but does not feature it prominently is generally considered as instrumental music. For example, some [[blues rock]] songs may have a short, simple call-and-response chorus, but the emphasis in the song is on the instrumental melodies and improvisation. Vocal music typically features sung words called [[lyrics]], although there are notable examples of vocal music that are performed using non-linguistic syllables or noises, sometimes as musical [[onomatopoeia]]. A short piece of vocal music with lyrics is broadly termed a [[song]], although, in [[classical music]], terms such as [[aria]] are typically used.\n\n===Genres of vocal music===\n{{Main|Music genre}}\n[[File:Divine trio 2016.jpg|thumb|A trio of female singers performing at the [[Berwaldhallen|Berwald Hall]] in 2016.]]\nVocal music is written in many different forms and styles which are often labeled within a particular genre of music. These genres include [[Hindustani classical music|Indian classical music]], [[Art music]], [[popular music]], [[traditional music]], regional and national music, and [[fusion genre|fusions]] of those genres. Within these larger genres are many subgenres. For example, popular music would encompass [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[country music]], [[easy listening]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[rock music]], and several other genres. There may also be a subgenre within a subgenre such as [[vocalese]] and [[scat singing]] in jazz.\n\n====Popular and traditional music====\nIn many modern pop [[musical group]]s, a lead singer performs the primary vocals or [[melody]] of a [[song]], as opposed to a [[Backing vocalist|backing singer]] who sings backup vocals or the [[harmony]] of a song. Backing vocalists sing some, but usually not all, parts of the song often singing only in a song's refrain or [[Hum (sound)|humming]] in the background. An exception is five-part [[Gospel music|gospel]] [[a cappella]] music, where the lead is the highest of the five voices and sings a [[descant]] and not the [[melody]]. Some artists may sing both the lead and backing vocals on audio recordings by overlapping recorded vocal tracks.\n\nPopular music includes a range of vocal styles. [[Hip-hop]] uses [[rapping]], the [[rhythm]]ic delivery of [[rhyme]]s in a rhythmic speech over a [[beats (music)|beat]] or without accompaniment. Some types of rapping consist mostly or entirely of speech and chanting, like the Jamaican \"[[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]]\". In some types of rapping, the performers may interpolate short sung or half-sung passages. [[Blues]] singing is based on the use of the [[blue note]]s\u2013notes sung at a slightly lower pitch than that of the major scale for expressive purposes. In [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hardcore punk]] subgenres, vocal styles can include techniques such as [[screaming (music)|screams]], shouts, and unusual sounds such as the \"[[death growl]]\".\n\nOne difference between live performances in the popular and Classical genres is that whereas Classical performers often sing without amplification in small- to mid-size halls, in popular music, a [[microphone]] and [[PA system]] (amplifier and speakers) are used in almost all performance venues, even a small coffee house. The use of the microphone has had several impacts on popular music. For one, it facilitated the development of intimate, expressive singing styles such as \"[[crooning]]\" which would not have enough projection and volume if done without a microphone. As well, pop singers who use microphones can do a range of other vocal styles that would not project without amplification, such as making whispering sounds, humming, and mixing half-sung and sung tones. As well, some performers use the microphone's response patterns to create effects, such as bringing the mic very close to the mouth to get an enhanced bass response, or, in the case of hip-hop [[beatboxer]]s, doing plosive \"p\" and \"b\" sounds into the mic to create percussive effects. In the 2000s, controversy arose over the widespread use of electronic [[Auto-Tune]] [[pitch correction]] devices with recorded and live popular music vocals. Controversy has also arisen due to cases where pop singers have been found to be [[lip-syncing in music|lip-syncing]] to a pre-recorded recording of their vocal performance or, in the case of the controversial act [[Milli Vanilli]], lip-syncing to tracks recorded by other uncredited singers.\n\nWhile some bands use backup singers who only sing when they are onstage, it is common for backup singers in popular music to have other roles. In many [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] bands, the musicians doing backup vocals also play instruments, such as [[rhythm guitar]], electric bass, or drums. In [[Music of Latin America|Latin]] or [[Music of Cuba#African heritage|Afro-Cuban]] groups, backup singers may play percussion instruments or shakers while singing. In some pop and [[hip-hop]] groups and in [[musical theater]], the backup singers may be required to perform elaborately choreographed dance routines while they sing through headset microphones.\n\n==Careers==\n[[File:Sketches_of_women_at_audition_for_the_chorus_at_Delmar_Garden_theater_in_St._Louis,_1906.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|right|Sketches by artist [[Marguerite Martyn]] of women trying out for the chorus at the Delmar Theater in St. Louis in May 1906, with quotations from some of those pictured]]\nThe salaries and working conditions for vocalists vary a great deal. While jobs in other music fields such as music education choir conductors tend to be based on full-time, salaried positions, singing jobs tend to be based on contracts for individual shows or performances, or for a sequence of shows\n\nAspiring singers and vocalists must have musical skill, an excellent voice, the ability to work with people, and a sense of showmanship and drama.  Additionally, singers need to have the ambition and drive to continually study and improve,<ref name=\"careers\">{{cite web |url=http://www.menc.org |title=National Association for Music Education (NAfME) |website=Menc.org |date=29 June 2017 |accessdate=22 July 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420155809/http://www.menc.org/ |archivedate=20 April 2012 }}</ref>\nProfessional singers continue to seek out [[vocal coach]]ing to hone their skills, extend their range, and learn new styles. As well, aspiring singers need to gain specialized skills in the vocal techniques used to interpret songs, learn about the vocal literature from their chosen style of music, and gain skills in choral music techniques, [[sight singing]] and memorizing songs, and vocal exercises.\n\nSome singers learn other music jobs, such as the [[Composing (music)|composing]], [[Music Producer|music producing]] and [[songwriting]]. Some singers put videos on [[YouTube]] and [[Streaming media|streaming]] apps. Singers market themselves to buyers of vocal talent, by doing [[audition]]s in front of a [[music director]]. Depending on the style of vocal music that a person has trained in, the \"talent buyers\" that they seek out may be [[record company]], [[A&R]] representatives, [[music director]]s, choir directors, nightclub managers, or concert promoters. A CD or DVD with excerpts of vocal performances is used to demonstrate a singer's skills. Some singers hire an agent or manager to help them to seek out paid engagements and other performance opportunities; the agent or manager is often paid by receiving a percentage of the fees that the singer gets from performing onstage.\n\n==Singing competitions==\nThere are several television shows that showcase singing. ''[[American Idol]]'' was launched in 2002. The first singing reality show was ''[[Sa Re Ga Ma Pa]]'' launched by [[Zee TV]] in the 1995.<ref name=\"year\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scoopwhoop.com/Contestants-On-SaReGaMaPa/|title=Contestants on Saregamapa|accessdate=6 July 2017|date=10 March 2016}}</ref> At the ''[[American Idol]]'' Contestants audition in front of a panel of judges to see if they can move on to the next round in Hollywood, from then, the competition begins. The field of contestants is narrowed down week by week until a winner is chosen. To move on to the next round, the contestants' fate is determined by a vote by viewers. ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'' is another singing competition program. Similar to ''American Idol'', the contestants audition in front of a panel of judges, however, the judges' chairs are faced towards the audience during the performance. If the coaches are interested in the artist, they will press their button signifying they want to coach them. Once the auditions conclude, coaches have their team of artists and the competition begins. Coaches then mentor their artists and they compete to find the best singer. Other well-known singing competitions include ''[[The X Factor]]'', ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', ''[[Rising Star (TV series)|Rising Star]]'' and ''[[The Sing-Off]]''.\n\n==Health benefits==\nScientific studies suggest that singing can have positive effects on people's health.

When they step on stage, many singers forget their worries and focus solely on the song. Singing is becoming a more widely known method of increasing an individual's overall health and wellness, in turn helping them to battle diseases such as cancer more effectively due to decreased stress, releasing of endorphins, and increased lung capacity.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Chronicle-Herald|last=Clarke|first=Heather Laura|date=20 June 2014|id = {{ProQuest|1774037978}}}}</ref>\n\n=== Effect on the brain ===\nJohn Daniel Scott, among others, have cited that \"people who sing are more likely to be happy\". This is because \"singing elevates the levels of neurotransmitters which are associated with pleasure and well being\". Humans have a long prehistory of music, especially singing; before written language, stories were passed down through song,{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} because song is often more memorable. There is also evidence that music or singing may have evolved in humans before language. Levitin, in his ''This is Your Brain on Music'', argues that \"music may be the activity that prepared our pre-human ancestors for speech communication\" and that \"singing ... might have helped our species to refine motor skills, paving the way for the development of the exquisitely fine muscle control required for vocal ... speech\" (260).<ref name=\"brain on music\">{{Cite book|title = This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession|last = Levitin|first = Daniel J.|publisher = Plume|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0-452-28852-2|location = New York}}</ref> On the other hand, he cites Pinker, who \"argued that language is an adaptation and music is its [[Spandrel (biology)|Spandrel]] ... an evolutionary accident piggybacking on language\" (248).<ref name=\"brain on music\" />\n\nStudies have found evidence suggesting the mental, as well as physical, benefits of singing. When conducting a study with 21 members of a choir at three different points over one year, three themes suggested three areas of benefits; the social impact (connectedness with others), personal impact (positive emotions, self-perception, etc.), and functional outcomes (health benefits of being in the choir). Findings showed that a sense of wellbeing is associated with singing, by uplifting the mood of the participants and releasing endorphins in the brain. Many singers also reported that the singing helped then regulate stress and relax, allowing them to deal better with their daily lives. From a social perspective, approval from the audience, and interaction with other choir members in a positive manner is also beneficial.\n\nSinging is beneficial for pregnant mothers. By giving them another medium of communication with their newborns, mothers in one study reported feelings of love and affection when singing to their unborn children. They also reported feeling more relaxed than ever before during their stressful pregnancy. A song can have nostalgic significance by reminding a singer of the past, and momentarily transport them, allowing them to focus on singing and embrace the activity as an escape from their daily lives and problems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dingle|first=Genevieve|year=2012|title=\"To be heard\": The social and mental health benefits of choir singing for disadvantaged adults|doi=10.1177/0305735611430081|journal=Psychology of Music|volume=41|issue=4|pages=405\u2013421|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:267353/UQ267353_post_print.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Effect on body===\nA recent study by [[Tenovus Cancer Care]] found that singing in a choir for just one hour boosts levels of immune proteins in cancer patients and has a positive overall effect on the health of patients. The study explores the possibility that singing could help put patients in the best mental and physical shape to receive the treatment they need, by reducing stress hormones, and increasing quantities of cytokines- proteins of the immune system that can increase the body's ability to fight disease. \"Singing gives you physical benefits like breath control and muscle movement and enunciation, as well as the learning benefits of processing information\" says a musical director and accompanist in the study. The enunciation and speech benefits tie into the language benefits detailed below.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160404221004.htm|title=Choir singing boosts immune system activity in cancer patients and carers, study shows|last=sciencedaily|first=from ecancermedicalscience|date=4 April 2016|access-date=10 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nSome have advocated, as in an 2011 article in the ''Toronto Star'', that everyone to sing, even if they are not musically talented, because of its health benefits. Singing lowers blood pressure by releasing pent up emotions, boosting relaxation and reminding them of happy times. It also allows singers to breathe more easily. Patients with lung disease and chronic pulmonary disease experience relief from their symptoms from singing just two times a week. In addition to breathing related illness, singing also has numerous benefits for stroke victims when it comes to relearning the ability to speak and communicate by singing their thoughts. Singing activates the right side of the brain when the left side cannot function (the left side is the area of the brain responsible for speech), so it is easy to see how singing can be an excellent alternative to speech while the victim heals.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2011/04/25/you_docs_5_reasons_to_sing_even_if_you_cant_carry_a_tune.html|title=You Docs: 5 reasons to sing \u2013 even if you can't carry a tune|author1=Dr. Oz|author2=Dr. Roizen|date=25 April 2011|work=The Star|access-date=25 November 2011|via=Proquest|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190328062517/https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2011/04/25/you_docs_5_reasons_to_sing_even_if_you_cant_carry_a_tune.html|archivedate=28 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Singing and language ==\nEvery natural or non-natural language has its own intrinsic musicality which affects singing by means of pitch, phrasing and accent.\n\n=== Neurological aspects ===\nMuch research has been done recently on the link between music and language, especially singing. It is becoming increasingly clear that these two processes are very much alike, and yet also different. Levitin describes how, beginning with the eardrum, sound waves are translated into pitch, or a [[Tonotopy|tonotopic map]], and then shortly thereafter \"speech and music probably diverge into separate processing circuits\" (130).<ref name=\"brain on music\" /> There is evidence that neural circuits used for music and language may start out in infants undifferentiated. There are several areas of the brain that are used for both language and music. For example, [[Brodmann area 47]], which has been implicated in the processing of [[syntax]] in oral and sign languages, as well as musical syntax and semantic aspects of language. Levitin recounts how in certain studies, \"listening to music and attending its syntactic features,\" similar to the syntactic processes in language, activated this part of the brain. In addition, \"musical syntax ... has been localized to ... areas adjacent to and overlapping with those regions that process speech syntax, such as [[Broca's area]]\" and \"the regions involved in musical semantics ..  appear to be [localized] near [[Wernicke's area]].\" Both Broca's area and Wernicke's area are important steps in language processing and production.\n\nSinging has been shown to help stroke victims recover speech. According to neurologist Gottfried Schlaug, there is a corresponding area to that of speech, which resides in the left hemisphere, on the right side of the brain.<ref>{{cite news|title = Singing 'rewires' damaged brain |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8526699.stm |work = BBC News|date = 21 February 2010|access-date = 2015-12-06 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217025939/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8526699.stm |archivedate=17 December 2018}}</ref> This is casually known as the \"singing center.\" By teaching stroke victims to sing their words, this can help train this area of the brain for speech. In support of this theory, Levitin asserts that \"regional specificity,\" such as that for speech, \"may be temporary, as the processing centers for important mental functions actually move to other regions after trauma or brain damage.\"<ref name=\"brain on music\" /> Thus in the right hemisphere of the brain, the \"singing center\" may be [[neuroplasticity|retrained]] to help produce speech.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://musicianbrain.gottfriedschlaug.org/papers/Loui_Wan_Schlaug_2010_Acoustics_Today.pdf |journal=Acoustics Today |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=28\u201336 | date=July 2010 |authors=Psyche Loui, Catherine Y.

When people sing, they generally use the accent or neutral accent that is used in the style of music they are singing in, rather than a regional accent or dialect; the style of music and the popular center/region of the style has more influence on the singing accent of a person than where they come from. For example, in the English language, British singers of rock or popular music often sing in an American accent or neutral accent instead of an English accent.<ref>{{cite web|last=Alleyne|first=Richard|title=Rock 'n' roll best sung in American accents|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/7922639/Rock-n-roll-best-sung-in-American-accents.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=2 August 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806003228/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/7922639/Rock-n-roll-best-sung-in-American-accents.html|archivedate=6 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Anderson|first=L.V.|title=Why Do British Singers Sound American?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/explainer/2012/11/skyfall_theme_song_by_adele_why_do_british_singers_sound_american.html|magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Singing animals ==\nScholars agree that singing is strongly present in many different species.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Marler | first1 = Peter | year = 1970 | title = Birdsong and speech development: Could there be parallels? | journal = American Scientist | volume = 58 | issue = 6| pages = 669\u201373 | pmid = 5480089 | jstor = 27829317}}</ref><ref>Wallin, Nils, Bjorn Merker, Steven Brown.

It is now one of two places in Poland with [[wine]] grape cultivation mainly for white wines (the other being the wine growing region near the town of [[Warka]] in [[Masovia]]). The first wineries around the city were built in 1314. At Parady\u017c (''Paradise'') Abbey near Zielona G\u00f3ra, monks have been making wine since 1250. The number of vineyards at peak production is estimated at 4,000 in the region, and 2,500 in Zielona G\u00f3ra itself. During the communist era wine production was reduced, but since 1990 it has recovered. Since 1852 an annual [[Zielona G\u00f3ra Wine Fest|Wine Festival]] has taken place in the town. However, nowadays wine is no longer produced in Zielona G\u00f3ra itself (the last factory was closed in the early 1990s).\n\nVodka ''[[Luksusowa (vodka)|Luksusowa]]'' (namely: Luxury vodka), made from potatoes rather than grain, is produced in distillery in Zielona G\u00f3ra.\n\n{{wide image|WzgorzeWinne.jpg|780px|Panorama of the city from the vineyards}}\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate is [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb'') with some [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] characteristics (''Dfb'') in normals previous to 1981\u20132010.

It is now one of two places in Poland with [[wine]] grape cultivation mainly for white wines (the other being the wine growing region near the town of [[Warka]] in [[Masovia]]). The first wineries around the city were built in 1314. At Parady\u017c (''Paradise'') Abbey near Zielona G\u00f3ra, monks have been making wine since 1250. The number of vineyards at peak production is estimated at 4,000 in the region, and 2,500 in Zielona G\u00f3ra itself. During the communist era wine production was reduced, but since 1990 it has recovered. Since 1852 an annual [[Zielona G\u00f3ra Wine Fest|Wine Festival]] has taken place in the town. However, nowadays wine is no longer produced in Zielona G\u00f3ra itself (the last factory was closed in the early 1990s).\n\nVodka ''[[Luksusowa (vodka)|Luksusowa]]'' (namely: Luxury vodka), made from potatoes rather than grain, is produced in distillery in Zielona G\u00f3ra.\n\n{{wide image|WzgorzeWinne.jpg|780px|Panorama of the city from the vineyards}}\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate is [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Cfb'') with some [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] characteristics (''Dfb'') in normals previous to 1981\u20132010.

We can say that the majority of the Bosnian territory was probably occupied by Croats \u2013 or at least, by Slavs under Croat rule \u2013 in the seventh century; but that is a tribal label which has little or no meaning five centuries later. The Bosnians were generally closer to the Croats in their religious and political history; but to apply the modern notion of Croat identity (something constructed in recent centuries out of religion, history, and language) to anyone in this period would be an anachronism.

The Bosnians were generally closer to the Croats in their religious and political history; but to apply the modern notion of Croat identity (something constructed in recent centuries out of religion, history, and language) to anyone in this period would be an anachronism.

The city of Zhytomyr is not a part of Zhytomyr Raion: the city itself is designated as its own separate raion within the oblast; moreover Zhytomyr consists of two so-called \"raions in a city\": Bohunskyi Raion and Koroliovskyi Raion (named in honour of [[Sergey Korolyov]]). Zhytomyr occupies an area of {{convert|65|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}}.  Its population is 266,936.\n\nZhytomyr is a major transportation hub. The city lies on a historic route linking the city of [[Kiev]] with the west through [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]]. Today it links [[Warsaw]] with Kiev, [[Minsk]] with [[Izmail]], and several major cities of Ukraine.  Zhytomyr was also the location of [[Ozerne (air base)|Ozerne airbase]], a key [[Cold War]] strategic aircraft base {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=off}} southeast of the city.\n\nImportant economic activities of Zhytomyr include lumber milling, food processing, granite quarrying, metalworking, and the manufacture of musical instruments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/reference/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/zhytomyr|title=Zhytomyr &#124; Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref>\n\nZhytomyr Oblast is the main center of the [[Polish minority in Ukraine]], and in the city itself there is a Latin Catholic cathedral and large [[Roman Catholic]] Polish cemetery, founded in 1800. It is regarded as the third biggest Polish cemetery outside Poland, after the [[Lychakivskiy Cemetery]] in [[Lviv]] and [[Rasos Cemetery]] in [[Vilnius]].\n\n== History ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2014}}\n[[File:bfc zhitomir kiev str.jpg|thumb|Kyivska (Kiev) street looking West toward St. Michael's Cathedral.

This date, 884, is cut in the large stone of the ice age times, standing on the hill where Zhytomyr was founded. Zhytomyr was one of the prominent cities of [[Kievan Rus']]. The first records of the town date from 1240, when it was sacked by the [[Mongol]] hordes of [[Batu Khan]].\n\nIn 1320 Zhytomyr was captured by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and received [[Magdeburg rights]] in 1444. After the [[Union of Lublin]] (1569) the city was incorporated into the [[Crown of the Polish Kingdom]] and in 1667, following the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], it became the capital of the [[Kiev Voivodeship]]. In the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793 it passed to [[Imperial Russia]] and became the capital of the [[Volhynian Governorate]].\n\nFollowing the [[Union of Lublin]], Zhytomyr (known in Polish as \u017bytomierz) became an important center of local administration, seat of the [[starosta]], and capital of \u017bytomierz County. Here, [[sejmik]]s of [[Kiev Voivodeship]] took place. In 1572, the town had 142 buildings, a manor house of the starosta and a castle. Following the privilege of King [[Sigismund III Vasa]], Zhytomyr had the right for two fairs a year. The town, which enjoyed royal protection of Polish kings, prospered until the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] (1648), when it was captured by [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] and their allies, [[Crimean Tatars]]. Its residents were murdered, Zhytomyr was burned to the ground, and all government files were destroyed. In 1667, Zhytomyr became capital of Kiev Voivodeship, and in 1724, a Jesuit school and monastery were opened here. By 1765, Zhytomyr had five churches, including 3 Roman Catholic and 2 Orthodox, and 285 houses.\n\nIn 1793 Zhytomyr was annexed by the [[Russian Empire]], and in 1804 was named capital of the Volhynian Governorate. In 1798, a Roman Catholic Diocese of Zhytomyr was established. During the [[January Uprising]], the town was a stronghold of Polish rebels.\n\nDuring a brief period of [[Ukrainian independence]] in 1918 the city was for a few weeks the national capital. [[Nicolas Werth]] claims that armed units of the Ukrainian People's Republic were also responsible for rapes, looting, and massacres in Zhytomyr, in which 500\u2013700 Jews lost their lives.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} From 1920 the city was under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule. Under Soviet rule a German National District was set up in the area for the German minority, according to Soviet minorities policy before [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nDuring [[World War II]] Zhytomyr and the surrounding territory was, for two and a half years (first from [[Operation Barbarossa|July 9, 1941]] to November 12, 1943 and again from November 19, 1943 to [[Zhitomir\u2013Berdichev Offensive|December 31, 1943]]) under [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] occupation and was [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s Ukrainian headquarters. The Nazi regime in what they called the \"Zhytomyr General District\" became what historian [[Wendy Lower]] describes as<blockquote>a laboratory for\u2026 Himmler's resettlement activists\u2026 the elimination of the Jews and German colonization of the East\u2014transformed the landscape and devastated the population to an extent that was not experienced in other parts of Nazi-occupied Europe besides Poland. [While]\u2026 [u]ltimately, the exigencies of the war effort and mounting partisan warfare behind the lines prevented Nazi leaders from fully developing and realizing their colonial aims in Ukraine\u2026 In addition to the immediate destruction of all Jewish communities, Himmler insisted that the Ukrainian civilian population be brought to a 'minimum.'<ref name=Lower>Lower, 2005, introduction.</ref></blockquote>\n\nFrom 1991, the city has been part of the independent Ukraine.\n\n== Population ==\n\n=== Demographic history ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year!!Inhabitants\n|-\n|1861\n|40,564\n|-\n|1891\n|69,785\n|-\n|1897\n|65,895 (of whom (by language) 31,000 Jews, 17,000 Russians, 9,000 Ukrainians, 7,000 Poles)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97_uezd.php?reg%3D233 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 3, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304205925/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97_uezd.php?reg=233 |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>\n|-\n|1926\n|76,700 (of whom 10,500 were Russians)<ref>John Alexander Armstrong, ''Ukrainian Nationalism'', Columbia University Press, 1963.</ref>\n|-\n|1939\n|95,100<ref name=\"John Alexander Armstrong 1963\">John Alexander Armstrong 1963.</ref>\n|-\n|1941\n|40,100  (Russians along with Poles, Jews, and Germans in minority)<ref name=\"John Alexander Armstrong 1963\"/>\n|-\n|2005\n|277,900\n|-\n|2015\n|269,493<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zt.ukrstat.gov.ua/Vupuski/05_15/chicl.zip|title=Population report by State Statistics Service of Ukraine, 1 Apr 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Roman Catholics ===\nZhytomyr had been a Latin Catholic bishopric since 1321, until the see was suppressed in 1789 in favor of the [[Diocese of Lutsk and Zytomierz]], until that was split up again in 1925, when it was restored as the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Zhytomyr]]; that was formally suppressed in 1998 to establish the [[Diocese of Ky\u00efv\u2013\u017dytomyr]], but actually the city retains the episcopal see in its Cathedral of the [[Holy Wisdom]], while [[Kiev]] (although first in the title and the national capital) only has a [[co-cathedral]].<ref>http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/zyto0.htm GCatholic</ref>\n\nThe Zhytomyr cemetery was opened in 1800. At first, it served Polish nobility from [[Volhynia]], such as the Czeczel and the Woronicz families. Later, other Catholics were buried here, including Germans, Ukrainians and Russians.\n\nIn 1840, the Chapel of St. Stanislaus was built (now in ruins), and the cemetery was divided into nine districts, named after different saints. In the [[Soviet Union]], the complex was devastated, now it is under the process of renovation.\n\nAmong most famous people buried here are: \n* Bronislaw Matyjewicz-Maciejewicz, one of the first Polish air pilots\n* Karol Niedzialkowski - bishop of Lutsk and Zhytomir in the late 19th century\n* Apolinary Wnukowski - Roman Catholic archbishop and scholar\n* Juliusz Zar\u0119bski - Polish composer\n* parents of [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]]\n* the family of [[Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko]]\n\n=== Jews in Zhytomyr ===\n[[File:Zhitomir Jewish Institute.JPG|thumb|Zhytomyr Jewish Institute building]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nZhytomyr apparently had few [[Jew]]s at the time of the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] (1648), but by the time it became part of [[Russia]] in 1778, it had a large Jewish community, and was a center of the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] movement. Jews formed nearly one-third of the 1861 population (13,299 in 40,564); thirty years later, they had somewhat outpaced the general growth of the city, with 24,062 Jews in a total population of 69,785. By 1891 there were three large [[synagogue]]s and 46 smaller ''[[Beth midrash|batei midrash]]''. The proportion of Jews was much lower in the surrounding district of Zhytomyr than in the city itself; at the turn of the century (circa 1900) there were 22,636 Jews in a total population of 281,378.\n\nIn [[Imperial Russia]], Zhytomyr held the same status as the official Jewish center of southern part of the [[Pale of Settlement]] as [[Vilnius]] held in the north. The printing of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] books was permitted only in these two cities during the monopoly of Hebrew printing from 1845 to 1862, and both were chosen as the seats of the two [[rabbi]]nical schools which were established by the government in 1848 in pursuance of its plans to force secular education on the [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union|Jews of Russia]] in accordance with the program of the Teutonized Russian [[Haskalah]] movement. The rabbinical school of Zhytomyr was considered the more Jewish, or rather the less Russianized, of the two (''[[Ha-Meli\u1e93]]'', 1868, No. 40, cited in ''Jewish Encyclopedia''). Its first head master was [[Jacob Eichenbaum]], who was succeeded by [[Hayyim Selig Slonimski]] in 1862. The latter remained at the head of the school until it was closed (together with the one at Vilnius) in 1873 because of its failure to provide rabbis with a secular education who should be acceptable to the Jewish communities. [[Suchastover]], [[Gottlober]], [[Lerner]], and [[Zweifel]] were among the best-known teachers of the rabbinical school at Zhytomyr, while [[Abraham Goldfaden]], [[Salomon Mandelkern]], and [[Abraham Jacob Paperna]] were among the students who later became famous in the Jewish world.\n\nThe Jewish community of Zhytomyr suffered [[pogrom]]s:\n:1) On May 7\u20138, 1905, when the section of the city known as \"Podol\" was devastated, and 20 were killed within the city.\n:2) On January 7\u201310, 1919, 15 young Jewish neighbors were killed when they came to defend, and the [[Christianity|Christian]] student Nicholas Blinov, also attempting to defend, likewise lost his life. Ten young Jews from nearby [[Chudnov]] were also killed while on their way to aid the Jews of Zhytomyr.<ref name=\"bh.org.il\">{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Zhitomir |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/zhitomir |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}</ref>\n:3) Beginning on March 22, 1919, according to witnesses, the 317 deaths were fewer than might have been, due to both Christian sheltering efforts and the return of the [[Bolshevik]] troops within a few days.<ref>Elias Heifetz, ''The slaughter of the Jews in the Ukraine in 1919'', 1921, Thomas Selzter New York, pp. 25-40.

The community is a part of the \"Union of Jewish Communities in Ukraine\" and the city and district's rabbinate. Rabbi Shlomo Vilhelm, who came to the city as a [[Chabad emissary]] in 1994, serves as rabbi. Other Jewish institutions are also active in the city, including the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee|Joint]] and its humanitarian branch \"Chesed\" and the [[Jewish Agency]].\n\nThe community has an ancient [[synagogue]] in the city center which has a [[mikveh]]. [[Chabad]] operates in the city various educational institutions which have residence in a village next to the city.\n\n== Culture ==\nThe internationally renowned chamber choir [[OREYA]] is based in the city.\n<br/> One of the world-famous museums of cosmonautics [[Sergei Pavlovich Korolyov Museum of Cosmonautics]] is located in the city.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Panorama-2008-05-20-teteriv.jpg|thumb|Teteriv River in Zhytomyr]]\nZhytomyr lies in a unique natural setting; all sides of the city are surrounded by ancient [[forest]]s through which flow the [[Teteriv River|Teteriv]], Kamianka, Kroshenka and Putiatynka [[river]]s. The Teteriv river generally forms the southern boundary of Zhytomyr, though there are also some small areas of Zhytomyr city territory below the southern bank of the river. The city is rich in [[parks]] and [[public square]]s.\n\nZhytomyr is set out on a mostly radial type of [[street]] net with the centre at the main public square of the city, named ''Sobornyi Maidan'' (which means ''Cathedral Square''). A building containing [[court]]s and some other institutions is in the west of the square. Before 1991, this building contained Zhytomyr Oblast Committee of the [[CPSU|Communist Party]]. Just behind the building (that is to the west of Sobornyi Square) is a small quiet park, bearing the name of ''Zamkova Gora'' (''Castle Mountain'') and containing a monument-type boulder with an inscription stating that this is a place where Zhytomyr was founded. This historical centre of Zhytomyr is in the south part of the city. The old part of Zhytomyr is on three rocky hills over the river Kamianka: Okhrimova, Zamkova, and Petrovska.\n\nThe old town is surrounded by new housing estates, the names of which are often borrowed from the former suburban villages or reflect the longstanding occupations common in these places. The main streets connecting Sobornyi Maidan with the outskirts of Zhytomyr are Kyivska Street or [[Kiev]] Street (going to northeast, to the [[railway station]] and also to the main [[bus station]] of the city), Velyka [[Berdychiv]]ska Street (going to [[Cardinal direction|southeast]]), [[Lech Kaczy\u0144ski]] Street (going southwest; its further continuation is [[Chudniv]]ska Street going to [[beach]]es and a forest-type park near the river of Teteriv), and Peremohy Street (going north).\n\nThe best-known street in the central part of Zhytomyr is Mykhailivska (named after [[St. Michael]]'s [[Church (building)|Church]] at the northern end of the street). The street is about 500 [[metre]]s to the east of Sobornyi Maidan and runs approximately from north to south, connecting some points at the above-mentioned Kyivska Street and Velyka Berdychivska. Mykhailivska Street is for [[pedestrian]] traffic: [[vehicle]]s are forbidden, with the exception of some slow-moving ones. A puppet theatre is nestled in the middle of the street, while the building of the Zhytomyr City Council is at its southern end. Several small coffee houses and caf\u00e9s have sprung up here recently, frequented by locals from all walks of life and of all ages. If one crosses Velyka Berdychivska Street from the southern end of Mykhailivska Street, then one finds oneself at [[Sergey Korolyov|Korolyov]] Square containing the building of the Zhytomyr Oblast Council. Crossing Kyivska Street from the northern end of Mykhailivska Street, one can continue to go along Pokrovska Street, another important long avenue of Zhytomyr (going north).\n\nThe best-known park of Zhytomyr is named after [[Yuri Gagarin]], in the south of the city, at the left (northern) bank of the Teteriv River. It was formerly owned by the [[Baron]] de Chaudoir.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Weather box\n|location = Zhytomyr \n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 5.0\n|Feb record high C = 5.0\n|Mar record high C = 12.0\n|Apr record high C = 22.0\n|May record high C = 27.0\n|Jun record high C = 29.0\n|Jul record high C = 32.0\n|Aug record high C = 31.0\n|Sep record high C = 27.0\n|Oct record high C = 21.0\n|Nov record high C = 13.0\n|Dec record high C = 7.0\n|Jan high C = -2.8\n|Feb high C = -1.4\n|Mar high C = 3.5\n|Apr high C = 11.9\n|May high C = 19.6\n|Jun high C = 22.9\n|Jul high C = 24.9\n|Aug high C = 24.0\n|Sep high C = 19.1\n|Oct high C = 11.9\n|Nov high C = 4.1\n|Dec high C = -0.7\n|year high C = 11.4\n|Jan mean C = -5.7\n|Feb mean C = -4.9\n|Mar mean C = -0.4\n|Apr mean C = 7.0\n|May mean C = 13.9\n|Jun mean C = 17.0\n|Jul mean C = 18.9\n|Aug mean C = 17.8\n|Sep mean C = 13.1\n|Oct mean C = 7.2\n|Nov mean C = 1.3\n|Dec mean C = -3.2\n|year mean C = 6.8\n|Jan low C = -8.8\n|Feb low C = -8.3\n|Mar low C = -3.7\n|Apr low C = 2.6\n|May low C = 8.3\n|Jun low C = 11.6\n|Jul low C = 13.3\n|Aug low C = 12.4\n|Sep low C = 8.1\n|Oct low C = 3.2\n|Nov low C = -1.4\n|Dec low C = -5.6\n|year low C = 2.6\n|Jan record low C = -35.0\n|Feb record low C = -35.0\n|Mar record low C = -27.0\n|Apr record low C = -11.0\n|May record low C = -4.0\n|Jun record low C = 1.0\n|Jul record low C = 5.0\n|Aug record low C = 2.0\n|Sep record low C = -5.0\n|Oct record low C = -20.0\n|Nov record low C = -23.0\n|Dec record low C = -31.0\n|precipitation colour= green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 32\n|Feb precipitation mm = 29\n|Mar precipitation mm = 31\n|Apr precipitation mm = 38\n|May precipitation mm = 53\n|Jun precipitation mm = 66\n|Jul precipitation mm = 78\n|Aug precipitation mm = 75\n|Sep precipitation mm = 50\n|Oct precipitation mm = 41\n|Nov precipitation mm = 43\n|Dec precipitation mm = 34\n|year precipitation mm = 570\n|source 1= Sistema de Clasificaci\u00f3n Bioclim\u00e1tica Mundial<ref name = climate >[http://www.ucm.es/info/cif/station/ru-zhito.htm Rus Ukrainskaya - Zhitomir] (in Spanish).

The city of Zhytomyr is not a part of Zhytomyr Raion: the city itself is designated as its own separate raion within the oblast; moreover Zhytomyr consists of two so-called \"raions in a city\": Bohunskyi Raion and Koroliovskyi Raion (named in honour of [[Sergey Korolyov]]). Zhytomyr occupies an area of {{convert|65|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}}.  Its population is 266,936.\n\nZhytomyr is a major transportation hub. The city lies on a historic route linking the city of [[Kiev]] with the west through [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]]. Today it links [[Warsaw]] with Kiev, [[Minsk]] with [[Izmail]], and several major cities of Ukraine.  Zhytomyr was also the location of [[Ozerne (air base)|Ozerne airbase]], a key [[Cold War]] strategic aircraft base {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=off}} southeast of the city.\n\nImportant economic activities of Zhytomyr include lumber milling, food processing, granite quarrying, metalworking, and the manufacture of musical instruments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/reference/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/zhytomyr|title=Zhytomyr &#124; Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}</ref>\n\nZhytomyr Oblast is the main center of the [[Polish minority in Ukraine]], and in the city itself there is a Latin Catholic cathedral and large [[Roman Catholic]] Polish cemetery, founded in 1800. It is regarded as the third biggest Polish cemetery outside Poland, after the [[Lychakivskiy Cemetery]] in [[Lviv]] and [[Rasos Cemetery]] in [[Vilnius]].\n\n== History ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=July 2014}}\n[[File:bfc zhitomir kiev str.jpg|thumb|Kyivska (Kiev) street looking West toward St. Michael's Cathedral.

This date, 884, is cut in the large stone of the ice age times, standing on the hill where Zhytomyr was founded. Zhytomyr was one of the prominent cities of [[Kievan Rus']]. The first records of the town date from 1240, when it was sacked by the [[Mongol]] hordes of [[Batu Khan]].\n\nIn 1320 Zhytomyr was captured by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and received [[Magdeburg rights]] in 1444. After the [[Union of Lublin]] (1569) the city was incorporated into the [[Crown of the Polish Kingdom]] and in 1667, following the [[Treaty of Andrusovo]], it became the capital of the [[Kiev Voivodeship]]. In the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793 it passed to [[Imperial Russia]] and became the capital of the [[Volhynian Governorate]].\n\nFollowing the [[Union of Lublin]], Zhytomyr (known in Polish as \u017bytomierz) became an important center of local administration, seat of the [[starosta]], and capital of \u017bytomierz County. Here, [[sejmik]]s of [[Kiev Voivodeship]] took place. In 1572, the town had 142 buildings, a manor house of the starosta and a castle. Following the privilege of King [[Sigismund III Vasa]], Zhytomyr had the right for two fairs a year. The town, which enjoyed royal protection of Polish kings, prospered until the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] (1648), when it was captured by [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] and their allies, [[Crimean Tatars]]. Its residents were murdered, Zhytomyr was burned to the ground, and all government files were destroyed. In 1667, Zhytomyr became capital of Kiev Voivodeship, and in 1724, a Jesuit school and monastery were opened here. By 1765, Zhytomyr had five churches, including 3 Roman Catholic and 2 Orthodox, and 285 houses.\n\nIn 1793 Zhytomyr was annexed by the [[Russian Empire]], and in 1804 was named capital of the Volhynian Governorate. In 1798, a Roman Catholic Diocese of Zhytomyr was established. During the [[January Uprising]], the town was a stronghold of Polish rebels.\n\nDuring a brief period of [[Ukrainian independence]] in 1918 the city was for a few weeks the national capital. [[Nicolas Werth]] claims that armed units of the Ukrainian People's Republic were also responsible for rapes, looting, and massacres in Zhytomyr, in which 500\u2013700 Jews lost their lives.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} From 1920 the city was under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule. Under Soviet rule a German National District was set up in the area for the German minority, according to Soviet minorities policy before [[World War II]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nDuring [[World War II]] Zhytomyr and the surrounding territory was, for two and a half years (first from [[Operation Barbarossa|July 9, 1941]] to November 12, 1943 and again from November 19, 1943 to [[Zhitomir\u2013Berdichev Offensive|December 31, 1943]]) under [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] occupation and was [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s Ukrainian headquarters.

[While]\u2026 [u]ltimately, the exigencies of the war effort and mounting partisan warfare behind the lines prevented Nazi leaders from fully developing and realizing their colonial aims in Ukraine\u2026 In addition to the immediate destruction of all Jewish communities, Himmler insisted that the Ukrainian civilian population be brought to a 'minimum.'<ref name=Lower>Lower, 2005, introduction.</ref></blockquote>\n\nFrom 1991, the city has been part of the independent Ukraine.\n\n== Population ==\n\n=== Demographic history ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year!!Inhabitants\n|-\n|1861\n|40,564\n|-\n|1891\n|69,785\n|-\n|1897\n|65,895 (of whom (by language) 31,000 Jews, 17,000 Russians, 9,000 Ukrainians, 7,000 Poles)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97_uezd.php?reg%3D233 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 3, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304205925/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97_uezd.php?reg=233 |archivedate=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>\n|-\n|1926\n|76,700 (of whom 10,500 were Russians)<ref>John Alexander Armstrong, ''Ukrainian Nationalism'', Columbia University Press, 1963.</ref>\n|-\n|1939\n|95,100<ref name=\"John Alexander Armstrong 1963\">John Alexander Armstrong 1963.</ref>\n|-\n|1941\n|40,100  (Russians along with Poles, Jews, and Germans in minority)<ref name=\"John Alexander Armstrong 1963\"/>\n|-\n|2005\n|277,900\n|-\n|2015\n|269,493<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zt.ukrstat.gov.ua/Vupuski/05_15/chicl.zip|title=Population report by State Statistics Service of Ukraine, 1 Apr 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Roman Catholics ===\nZhytomyr had been a Latin Catholic bishopric since 1321, until the see was suppressed in 1789 in favor of the [[Diocese of Lutsk and Zytomierz]], until that was split up again in 1925, when it was restored as the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Zhytomyr]]; that was formally suppressed in 1998 to establish the [[Diocese of Ky\u00efv\u2013\u017dytomyr]], but actually the city retains the episcopal see in its Cathedral of the [[Holy Wisdom]], while [[Kiev]] (although first in the title and the national capital) only has a [[co-cathedral]].<ref>http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/zyto0.htm GCatholic</ref>\n\nThe Zhytomyr cemetery was opened in 1800. At first, it served Polish nobility from [[Volhynia]], such as the Czeczel and the Woronicz families. Later, other Catholics were buried here, including Germans, Ukrainians and Russians.\n\nIn 1840, the Chapel of St. Stanislaus was built (now in ruins), and the cemetery was divided into nine districts, named after different saints. In the [[Soviet Union]], the complex was devastated, now it is under the process of renovation.\n\nAmong most famous people buried here are: \n* Bronislaw Matyjewicz-Maciejewicz, one of the first Polish air pilots\n* Karol Niedzialkowski - bishop of Lutsk and Zhytomir in the late 19th century\n* Apolinary Wnukowski - Roman Catholic archbishop and scholar\n* Juliusz Zar\u0119bski - Polish composer\n* parents of [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]]\n* the family of [[Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko]]\n\n=== Jews in Zhytomyr ===\n[[File:Zhitomir Jewish Institute.JPG|thumb|Zhytomyr Jewish Institute building]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nZhytomyr apparently had few [[Jew]]s at the time of the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] (1648), but by the time it became part of [[Russia]] in 1778, it had a large Jewish community, and was a center of the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] movement. Jews formed nearly one-third of the 1861 population (13,299 in 40,564); thirty years later, they had somewhat outpaced the general growth of the city, with 24,062 Jews in a total population of 69,785. By 1891 there were three large [[synagogue]]s and 46 smaller ''[[Beth midrash|batei midrash]]''. The proportion of Jews was much lower in the surrounding district of Zhytomyr than in the city itself; at the turn of the century (circa 1900) there were 22,636 Jews in a total population of 281,378.\n\nIn [[Imperial Russia]], Zhytomyr held the same status as the official Jewish center of southern part of the [[Pale of Settlement]] as [[Vilnius]] held in the north. The printing of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] books was permitted only in these two cities during the monopoly of Hebrew printing from 1845 to 1862, and both were chosen as the seats of the two [[rabbi]]nical schools which were established by the government in 1848 in pursuance of its plans to force secular education on the [[History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union|Jews of Russia]] in accordance with the program of the Teutonized Russian [[Haskalah]] movement. The rabbinical school of Zhytomyr was considered the more Jewish, or rather the less Russianized, of the two (''[[Ha-Meli\u1e93]]'', 1868, No. 40, cited in ''Jewish Encyclopedia''). Its first head master was [[Jacob Eichenbaum]], who was succeeded by [[Hayyim Selig Slonimski]] in 1862. The latter remained at the head of the school until it was closed (together with the one at Vilnius) in 1873 because of its failure to provide rabbis with a secular education who should be acceptable to the Jewish communities. [[Suchastover]], [[Gottlober]], [[Lerner]], and [[Zweifel]] were among the best-known teachers of the rabbinical school at Zhytomyr, while [[Abraham Goldfaden]], [[Salomon Mandelkern]], and [[Abraham Jacob Paperna]] were among the students who later became famous in the Jewish world.\n\nThe Jewish community of Zhytomyr suffered [[pogrom]]s:\n:1) On May 7\u20138, 1905, when the section of the city known as \"Podol\" was devastated, and 20 were killed within the city.\n:2) On January 7\u201310, 1919, 15 young Jewish neighbors were killed when they came to defend, and the [[Christianity|Christian]] student Nicholas Blinov, also attempting to defend, likewise lost his life. Ten young Jews from nearby [[Chudnov]] were also killed while on their way to aid the Jews of Zhytomyr.<ref name=\"bh.org.il\">{{cite web |title=The Jewish Community of Zhitomir |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/zhitomir |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}</ref>\n:3) Beginning on March 22, 1919, according to witnesses, the 317 deaths were fewer than might have been, due to both Christian sheltering efforts and the return of the [[Bolshevik]] troops within a few days.<ref>Elias Heifetz, ''The slaughter of the Jews in the Ukraine in 1919'', 1921, Thomas Selzter New York, pp. 25-40.

The community is a part of the \"Union of Jewish Communities in Ukraine\" and the city and district's rabbinate. Rabbi Shlomo Vilhelm, who came to the city as a [[Chabad emissary]] in 1994, serves as rabbi. Other Jewish institutions are also active in the city, including the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee|Joint]] and its humanitarian branch \"Chesed\" and the [[Jewish Agency]].\n\nThe community has an ancient [[synagogue]] in the city center which has a [[mikveh]]. [[Chabad]] operates in the city various educational institutions which have residence in a village next to the city.\n\n== Culture ==\nThe internationally renowned chamber choir [[OREYA]] is based in the city.\n<br/> One of the world-famous museums of cosmonautics [[Sergei Pavlovich Korolyov Museum of Cosmonautics]] is located in the city.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Panorama-2008-05-20-teteriv.jpg|thumb|Teteriv River in Zhytomyr]]\nZhytomyr lies in a unique natural setting; all sides of the city are surrounded by ancient [[forest]]s through which flow the [[Teteriv River|Teteriv]], Kamianka, Kroshenka and Putiatynka [[river]]s. The Teteriv river generally forms the southern boundary of Zhytomyr, though there are also some small areas of Zhytomyr city territory below the southern bank of the river. The city is rich in [[parks]] and [[public square]]s.\n\nZhytomyr is set out on a mostly radial type of [[street]] net with the centre at the main public square of the city, named ''Sobornyi Maidan'' (which means ''Cathedral Square''). A building containing [[court]]s and some other institutions is in the west of the square. Before 1991, this building contained Zhytomyr Oblast Committee of the [[CPSU|Communist Party]]. Just behind the building (that is to the west of Sobornyi Square) is a small quiet park, bearing the name of ''Zamkova Gora'' (''Castle Mountain'') and containing a monument-type boulder with an inscription stating that this is a place where Zhytomyr was founded. This historical centre of Zhytomyr is in the south part of the city. The old part of Zhytomyr is on three rocky hills over the river Kamianka: Okhrimova, Zamkova, and Petrovska.\n\nThe old town is surrounded by new housing estates, the names of which are often borrowed from the former suburban villages or reflect the longstanding occupations common in these places. The main streets connecting Sobornyi Maidan with the outskirts of Zhytomyr are Kyivska Street or [[Kiev]] Street (going to northeast, to the [[railway station]] and also to the main [[bus station]] of the city), Velyka [[Berdychiv]]ska Street (going to [[Cardinal direction|southeast]]), [[Lech Kaczy\u0144ski]] Street (going southwest; its further continuation is [[Chudniv]]ska Street going to [[beach]]es and a forest-type park near the river of Teteriv), and Peremohy Street (going north).\n\nThe best-known street in the central part of Zhytomyr is Mykhailivska (named after [[St. Michael]]'s [[Church (building)|Church]] at the northern end of the street). The street is about 500 [[metre]]s to the east of Sobornyi Maidan and runs approximately from north to south, connecting some points at the above-mentioned Kyivska Street and Velyka Berdychivska. Mykhailivska Street is for [[pedestrian]] traffic: [[vehicle]]s are forbidden, with the exception of some slow-moving ones. A puppet theatre is nestled in the middle of the street, while the building of the Zhytomyr City Council is at its southern end. Several small coffee houses and caf\u00e9s have sprung up here recently, frequented by locals from all walks of life and of all ages. If one crosses Velyka Berdychivska Street from the southern end of Mykhailivska Street, then one finds oneself at [[Sergey Korolyov|Korolyov]] Square containing the building of the Zhytomyr Oblast Council. Crossing Kyivska Street from the northern end of Mykhailivska Street, one can continue to go along Pokrovska Street, another important long avenue of Zhytomyr (going north).\n\nThe best-known park of Zhytomyr is named after [[Yuri Gagarin]], in the south of the city, at the left (northern) bank of the Teteriv River. It was formerly owned by the [[Baron]] de Chaudoir.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Weather box\n|location = Zhytomyr \n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 5.0\n|Feb record high C = 5.0\n|Mar record high C = 12.0\n|Apr record high C = 22.0\n|May record high C = 27.0\n|Jun record high C = 29.0\n|Jul record high C = 32.0\n|Aug record high C = 31.0\n|Sep record high C = 27.0\n|Oct record high C = 21.0\n|Nov record high C = 13.0\n|Dec record high C = 7.0\n|Jan high C = -2.8\n|Feb high C = -1.4\n|Mar high C = 3.5\n|Apr high C = 11.9\n|May high C = 19.6\n|Jun high C = 22.9\n|Jul high C = 24.9\n|Aug high C = 24.0\n|Sep high C = 19.1\n|Oct high C = 11.9\n|Nov high C = 4.1\n|Dec high C = -0.7\n|year high C = 11.4\n|Jan mean C = -5.7\n|Feb mean C = -4.9\n|Mar mean C = -0.4\n|Apr mean C = 7.0\n|May mean C = 13.9\n|Jun mean C = 17.0\n|Jul mean C = 18.9\n|Aug mean C = 17.8\n|Sep mean C = 13.1\n|Oct mean C = 7.2\n|Nov mean C = 1.3\n|Dec mean C = -3.2\n|year mean C = 6.8\n|Jan low C = -8.8\n|Feb low C = -8.3\n|Mar low C = -3.7\n|Apr low C = 2.6\n|May low C = 8.3\n|Jun low C = 11.6\n|Jul low C = 13.3\n|Aug low C = 12.4\n|Sep low C = 8.1\n|Oct low C = 3.2\n|Nov low C = -1.4\n|Dec low C = -5.6\n|year low C = 2.6\n|Jan record low C = -35.0\n|Feb record low C = -35.0\n|Mar record low C = -27.0\n|Apr record low C = -11.0\n|May record low C = -4.0\n|Jun record low C = 1.0\n|Jul record low C = 5.0\n|Aug record low C = 2.0\n|Sep record low C = -5.0\n|Oct record low C = -20.0\n|Nov record low C = -23.0\n|Dec record low C = -31.0\n|precipitation colour= green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 32\n|Feb precipitation mm = 29\n|Mar precipitation mm = 31\n|Apr precipitation mm = 38\n|May precipitation mm = 53\n|Jun precipitation mm = 66\n|Jul precipitation mm = 78\n|Aug precipitation mm = 75\n|Sep precipitation mm = 50\n|Oct precipitation mm = 41\n|Nov precipitation mm = 43\n|Dec precipitation mm = 34\n|year precipitation mm = 570\n|source 1= Sistema de Clasificaci\u00f3n Bioclim\u00e1tica Mundial<ref name = climate >[http://www.ucm.es/info/cif/station/ru-zhito.htm Rus Ukrainskaya - Zhitomir] (in Spanish).

There are also electric [[tram]]s, but on one route only. Earlier there were several tram routes in Zhytomyr, but all excepting one were canceled during a period of domination of the opinion that a tram is a bad kind of [[transport]].\nTrams began to shuttle in Zhytomyr in 1899. Thus Zhytomyr became the 5th city with electric trams within the territory of present-day [[Ukraine]]. Trolleybuses appear in Zhytomyr in 1962.\nThe total length of Zhytomyr city electric transport routes (trolleybuses and trams) is 275&nbsp;km.

It is one of the fastest-growing settlements in Taiwan, with a population gain of 51,000 between 2010 and 2019, the highest of any township/city or district. The city has attracted migration both because of its proximity to [[Hsinchu|Hsinchu City]] and the Hsinchu Science and Technology Park, and because the Hsinchu County government has focused most of its infrastructure here.\n\nIt is governed as a [[Townships and county-administered cities|county-administered city]], and is the county seat of Hsinchu County.\n\n==History==\n\n===Empire of Japan===\n[[File:Txu-pclmaps-oclc-6550512-kyuko-2221-i.jpg|left|thumb|Map of Zhubei area (1944)]]\nIn 1920, the area of {{nihongo|Chikuhoku Station|\u7af9\u5317\u9a5b|lead=yes}} was formerly called \"[[Angmo]] Field\" ({{zh|c=\u7d05\u6bdb\u7530|poj=\u00e2ng-mn\u0302g-chh\u00e2n|l=red fur field}}).

In October 1988, Zhubei Township was promoted to a [[county-controlled city]].\n\n==Geography==\nZhubei borders [[Hsinchu|Hsinchu City]] to the southwest, Xinfeng and Hukou Townships to the north, Qionglin and Xinpu to the East, Zhudong to the southeast, and the Taiwan Strait to its west. It is the discharge point of the [[Fongshan River]] and the [[Touqian River]] into the Taiwan Strait. Zhubei has been a satellite city of Hsinchu City since Hsinchu City reformed to become a special municipality in 1982. Due to the separation of Hsinchu City from Hsinchu County and Zhubei becoming the Hsinchu County seat, as well as its proximity to the Hsinchu Science and Technology Park and the semiconductor industry, the city has acquired an increasingly large amount of capital inflow from government, as well as a rapid population increase and a resulting spike in real estate values. The city's population was estimated at 176,966 in January 2017.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =http://w3.hsinchu.gov.tw/house/print/city.aspx?y=106&m=1\n | script-title =zh:106\u5e741\u6708 \u65b0\u7af9\u7e23\u4eba\u53e3\u7d71\u8a08\u5831\u8868\n | trans-title =Table of Hsinchu County Population Statistics, January 2017\n | language =zh-hant\n | website =hsinchu.gov.tw\n | publisher =Hsinchu County Government\n | access-date =February 27, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nThe city is administered as 30 villages: Aikou, Baide, Beilun, Beixing, Chongyi, Damei, Dayi, Doulun, Fude, Lianxing, Luchang, Mayuan, Shangyi, Shixing, Taihe, Tunghai, Tungping, Tungxing, Wenhua, Xingan, Xingang, Xinguo, Xinlun, Xinshe, Xinzhuang, Xizhou, Zhongxing, Zhubei, Zhuren and Zhuyi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chupei.gov.tw/news4_list.php?menu=25&typeid=1141 |script-title=zh:\u7af9\u5317\u5e02\u5404\u91cc\u91cc\u5716|trans-title=Maps of Villages in Zhubei City| language = zh-hant|publisher=Zhubei City Office |website=chupei.gov.tw|accessdate=February 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Government institutions==\n* [[Hsinchu County Government]]\n* [[Hsinchu County Council]]\n\n==Economy==\nThe agricultural aspect of Zhubei has shifted from mainly rice paddy farming to more floral and fruit cultivation that attracts tourists; however the majority of the local economy is now fueled by the semiconductor industry, real estate speculation and the service sector.

It is the discharge point of the [[Fongshan River]] and the [[Touqian River]] into the Taiwan Strait. Zhubei has been a satellite city of Hsinchu City since Hsinchu City reformed to become a special municipality in 1982. Due to the separation of Hsinchu City from Hsinchu County and Zhubei becoming the Hsinchu County seat, as well as its proximity to the Hsinchu Science and Technology Park and the semiconductor industry, the city has acquired an increasingly large amount of capital inflow from government, as well as a rapid population increase and a resulting spike in real estate values.

[[Sun Yat-sen]] visited Zhoushan on 25 August 1916 and wrote ''Travelling to Putuo'' ({{lang|zh|\u6e38\u666e\u9640\u5fd7\u5947}}, ''You Putuo Zhiqi''). On 1 October 1942, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese ship]] ''[[Lisbon Maru]]'' was transporting 1,800 [[POW]]s to [[Tokyo]] when she was attacked by the [[USS Grouper|USS{{nbsp}}''Grouper'']] off [[Qingbing Island|Qingbing]] ({{lang|zh|\u9752\u6d5c}}) or [[Dongfushan|Dongfu]]; one torpedo hit and she sank the next day. The fishermen of nearby Dongji ({{lang|zh|\u4e1c\u6781\u4e61}}) rescued 384 of the British prisoners from the wreckage. Amid the [[Chinese Civil War]], Dinghai County lost Shengsi, which became an Archipelago Directly-controlled District ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5217\u5cf6\u76f4\u5c6c\u5340}}) of [[Jiangsu]] in 1946, then a separate county in October 1949. The same year, Dinghai County was divided into [[Dinghai District|Dinghai]] and [[Wengzhou County|Wengzhou]] ({{lang|zh|\u7fc1\u6d32}}) Counties. In November, the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communists]] [[Battle of Dengbu Island|landed on Dengbu Island]], but were repulsed by the defenders.\n\nNevertheless, Zhoushan was overrun by the Communists on 17 May 1950. Wengzhou was merged back into Dinghai County, which made up part of Ningbo Prefecture, and Shengsi made up a special area ({{lang|zh|\u7279\u533a}}) and then county of the [[Songjiang District|Songjiang]] Prefecture, then still part of Jiangsu. In March 1953, the Council of Ministers opted to establish the Zhoushan Prefecture, returning Shengsi and dividing Dinghai into [[Dinghai District|Dinghai]], [[Putuo District, Zhoushan|Putuo]], and [[Daishan]]. Ningbo's [[Xiangshan County, Zhejiang|Xiangshan County]] was also briefly incorporated into this new prefecture from 1954 to 1958. From 1958 to May 1962, Zhoushan was incorporated into Ningbo before becoming a separate prefecture again. Shengsi was temporarily assigned to [[Shanghai]] in the early 1960s. The short-lived Daqu County ({{lang|zh|\u5927\u8862\u7e23}}) was created in 1962 before being redivided between Daishan and Shengsi four years later.\n\nZhoushan was promoted to a [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level \"city\"]] on 27 January 1987, with Dinghai and Putuo Counties upgraded to districts. The municipal People's Government was established on 8 March of that year. April of the same year, the ports of Zhoushan became open to foreign ships. On 10 April 1988, it became a coastal economic open zone.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nZhoushan administers two [[District of China|districts]] and two [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]]. The city currently consists of 36 township-level divisions, including 17 [[town of China|towns]], 5 [[Township (People's Republic of China)|townships]] and 14 [[subdistrict]]s.

The transportation condition in Zhoushan has been improved largely during recent years, especially after the opening of Zhoushan Trans-Oceanic Bridges in 2009, which established a stable corridor connecting to the continent and converted Zhoushan into a peninsula per se. Due to geographical isolation, Zhoushan is the only one of the municipalities in Zhejiang Province which is not served with rail transportation.\n\n[[File:List of Zhoushan bridges detailed with names, districts and counties belonged, start and end points, total lengths and dates opened.jpg|thumb|right|250px|List of Zhoushan bridges detailed with names, districts and counties belonged, start and end points, total lengths and dates opened]]\n\n===Air transportation===\n[[File:Zhoushan Putuoshan Airport.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Zhoushan Putuoshan Airport]]\n* Albeit named after [[Putuoshan|Mt.

The construction of the airport began in March 1997 and completed in August 1997 with an investment of 410 million RMB yuan, and is rated as a 4D airport. As of 2016, Zhoushan Airport is the 86th largest civic airport in [[Mainland China]] in terms of passengers handled with a total of 800.9 thousand users.

These five bridges are Cengang Bridge (\u5c91\u6e2f\u5927\u6865), Xiangjiaomen Bridge (\u54cd\u7901\u95e8\u5927\u6865), [[Taoyaomen Bridge]] (\u6843\u592d\u95e8\u5927\u6865), [[Xihoumen Bridge]] (\u897f\u5820\u95e8\u5927\u6865) and [[Jintang Bridge]] (\u91d1\u5858\u5927\u6865). The painstaking huge project, started in 1999 and completed in 2010, is the largest bridge group in China. Xihoumen Bridge, in particular, is the world's second-longest suspension bridge in terms of the length of the central span.\n[[File:Zhoushan Bus Terminal.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Zhoushan Bus Terminal]]\n* [[China National Highway 329]], which starts from Hangzhou and ends in Zhujiajian Sub-district of Zhoushan with a current length of 292 kilometers, is the only national highway serving the city of Zhoushan. It is also the shortest national level highway that runs in the east\u2013west direction. Before reaching Zhoushan, Highway 329 passes through municipalities of [[Shaoxing]] and [[Ningbo]]. The route between the boundaries of Ningbo and Zhoushan is built in the form of [[ferry]], which is also unique in the national highway system. The ferry dock on Ningbo's side is named Baifeng, and the one on Zhoushan's side is named Yadanshan. The route of Highway 329 in Zhoushan has undergone several changes and adjustments. Initially the route went through the southern shoreline of Zhoushan Island and ended in Shenjiamen. However, with the construction of Zhujiajian Bridge, the route was extended all the way to Nansha Beach of Zhujiajian Island. Later, with the development Dinghai and Lincheng, part of Highway 329 was designated as urban roads instead of a rapid passing corridor. Therefore, Highway 329 went on to take the route of the outer ring road of Dinghai and Highway Baiquan-Shenjiamen. Recently to optimize the highway structure of Zhoushan, Highway 329 is undergoing another large modification in its route. The new route, designed with a series of tunnels and interchanges, will run at the center of Zhoushan Island to form its backbone. Seven tunnels on the new route account for a length of 11,187 meters. A total of 5 interchanges are designed along the new route. The project, projected to spend 5 billion yuan, is set to finish in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|author=document.write(getNowDate()) |url=http://www.zhoushan.cn/newscenter/zsxw/201212/t20121228_575341.htm |title=\u821f\u5c71\u7f51\u00b7\u5927\u6d77\u7f51:\u5e26\u4f60\u8ba4\u8bc6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u56fd\u9053 |publisher=Zhoushan.cn |date=2014-01-10 |accessdate=2015-12-23}}</ref>\n* Zhoushan [[Bus Rapid Transit]] (\u821f\u5c71\u5feb\u901f\u516c\u4ea4\uff09is the rapid transit system with dedicated lanes between urban agglomerations on Zhoushan Island.

During the [[Spring and Autumn period]], Zhoushan was called '''Yongdong''', referring to its location east of the [[Yong River]]. At the time, it belonged to the [[ancient Chinese states|state]] of [[Yue (state)|Yue]]. The fishermen and sailors who inhabited the islands often engaged in piracy and became recruits for uprisings against the central authorities. At the time of the [[Eastern Jin dynasty|Eastern Jin]], the Zhoushan Islands served as the base for [[Sun En]]'s rebellion. Sun En, an adherent of the [[Taoism in China|Taoist]] sect the [[Way of the Five Pecks of Rice]], launched his rebellion around the year 400 and was defeated by Jin forces in 402.<ref>Gernet 2002, pp. 182\u2013183.</ref> Today's Zhoushan was first created as {{nowrap|'''Wengshan [[county (China)|County]]'''}} in [[Ming Prefecture (Zhejiang)|Ming Prefecture]] in 738 under the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]].\n\nIn 863, the Japanese [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk Egaku ({{lang|ja|\u6167\u9537}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinesestudies.hawaii.edu/community/faculty/mccraw/lingjing.pdf |title=Magic Precincts: Five Buddhist temples and How They Grew |author=David McCraw |year=2003 |publisher=Center for Chinese Studies, [[University of Hawai\u2018i at M\u0101noa]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918002453/http://www.chinesestudies.hawaii.edu/community/faculty/mccraw/lingjing.pdf |archivedate=18 September 2009 }}</ref> and a [[Putuoshan]] local Zhang-shi ({{lang|zh|\u5f20\u6c0f}}) placed a statue of [[Guanyin]] at Chaoyin Cave ({{lang|zh|\u6f6e\u97f3\u6d1e}}) that would later become a popular tourist and pilgrim destination. In 1073, under the [[Song dynasty|Song]], it was renamed {{nowrap|'''Changguo County'''}}; this was upgraded to a [[zhou (administrative division)|prefecture]] in the early [[Yuan dynasty]].During the [[Ming dynasty]], especially between the years 1530 and 1560, Japanese and Chinese pirates used Zhoushan as one of their principal bases from which they launched attacks as far as [[Nanjing]]; \"the whole Chinese coast from northern [[Shandong]] to western [[Guangdong]] was ravaged to a distance of sixty miles inland.\"<ref>Gernet 2002, p. 422.</ref>\n\nAfter suppression of the pirates, Zhoushan became an important commercial entrep\u00f4t.

[[Sun Yat-sen]] visited Zhoushan on 25 August 1916 and wrote ''Travelling to Putuo'' ({{lang|zh|\u6e38\u666e\u9640\u5fd7\u5947}}, ''You Putuo Zhiqi''). On 1 October 1942, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese ship]] ''[[Lisbon Maru]]'' was transporting 1,800 [[POW]]s to [[Tokyo]] when she was attacked by the [[USS Grouper|USS{{nbsp}}''Grouper'']] off [[Qingbing Island|Qingbing]] ({{lang|zh|\u9752\u6d5c}}) or [[Dongfushan|Dongfu]]; one torpedo hit and she sank the next day. The fishermen of nearby Dongji ({{lang|zh|\u4e1c\u6781\u4e61}}) rescued 384 of the British prisoners from the wreckage. Amid the [[Chinese Civil War]], Dinghai County lost Shengsi, which became an Archipelago Directly-controlled District ({{lang|zh-hant|\u5217\u5cf6\u76f4\u5c6c\u5340}}) of [[Jiangsu]] in 1946, then a separate county in October 1949. The same year, Dinghai County was divided into [[Dinghai District|Dinghai]] and [[Wengzhou County|Wengzhou]] ({{lang|zh|\u7fc1\u6d32}}) Counties. In November, the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communists]] [[Battle of Dengbu Island|landed on Dengbu Island]], but were repulsed by the defenders.\n\nNevertheless, Zhoushan was overrun by the Communists on 17 May 1950. Wengzhou was merged back into Dinghai County, which made up part of Ningbo Prefecture, and Shengsi made up a special area ({{lang|zh|\u7279\u533a}}) and then county of the [[Songjiang District|Songjiang]] Prefecture, then still part of Jiangsu. In March 1953, the Council of Ministers opted to establish the Zhoushan Prefecture, returning Shengsi and dividing Dinghai into [[Dinghai District|Dinghai]], [[Putuo District, Zhoushan|Putuo]], and [[Daishan]]. Ningbo's [[Xiangshan County, Zhejiang|Xiangshan County]] was also briefly incorporated into this new prefecture from 1954 to 1958. From 1958 to May 1962, Zhoushan was incorporated into Ningbo before becoming a separate prefecture again. Shengsi was temporarily assigned to [[Shanghai]] in the early 1960s. The short-lived Daqu County ({{lang|zh|\u5927\u8862\u7e23}}) was created in 1962 before being redivided between Daishan and Shengsi four years later.\n\nZhoushan was promoted to a [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level \"city\"]] on 27 January 1987, with Dinghai and Putuo Counties upgraded to districts. The municipal People's Government was established on 8 March of that year. April of the same year, the ports of Zhoushan became open to foreign ships.

Initially the route went through the southern shoreline of Zhoushan Island and ended in Shenjiamen. However, with the construction of Zhujiajian Bridge, the route was extended all the way to Nansha Beach of Zhujiajian Island. Later, with the development Dinghai and Lincheng, part of Highway 329 was designated as urban roads instead of a rapid passing corridor. Therefore, Highway 329 went on to take the route of the outer ring road of Dinghai and Highway Baiquan-Shenjiamen. Recently to optimize the highway structure of Zhoushan, Highway 329 is undergoing another large modification in its route. The new route, designed with a series of tunnels and interchanges, will run at the center of Zhoushan Island to form its backbone. Seven tunnels on the new route account for a length of 11,187 meters. A total of 5 interchanges are designed along the new route. The project, projected to spend 5 billion yuan, is set to finish in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|author=document.write(getNowDate()) |url=http://www.zhoushan.cn/newscenter/zsxw/201212/t20121228_575341.htm |title=\u821f\u5c71\u7f51\u00b7\u5927\u6d77\u7f51:\u5e26\u4f60\u8ba4\u8bc6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u65b0\u7684\u56fd\u9053 |publisher=Zhoushan.cn |date=2014-01-10 |accessdate=2015-12-23}}</ref>\n* Zhoushan [[Bus Rapid Transit]] (\u821f\u5c71\u5feb\u901f\u516c\u4ea4\uff09is the rapid transit system with dedicated lanes between urban agglomerations on Zhoushan Island.

The scenic area, consisting of hundreds of islands outlying the [[Hangzhou Bay]], boasts multiple quality beaches, rocks, and cliffs. Although it is commonly endowed with natural seascape beauty, each island is unique. Jihu and Nanchangtu Twin Beaches, the northernmost sand beaches of Southern China (and the natural beaches closest to Shanghai), make Sijiao Island a popular tourism destination. Shengshan is one of the most important fishing ports on the East China Sea. The eastern coast of Shengshan Island features steep cliffs, an ideal place to view sunrise above the sea.

Dongsha Ancient Town was once the county seat of Daishan, that is famous for hundreds years of commercial and exchange activities associated to traditional fishing industry. Several major buildings and facilities have been well protected. Shuanghe features wonderful large-scale man-made cliffs and precipices which are the result of hundreds years of carving for granite materials for architectural purposes. Daishan has the reputation of being a county of museums. Its collection of museums include themes such as fishing culture, Zhoushan dialect, typhoon, lighthouse, salt production, etc. Besides the above-stated attractions on Daishan Island, other islands are noteworthy as well.

For a moderated subform of flagellation, described as ''bastinado'', the soles of a person's [[barefoot|bare feet]] are used as a target for beating (see [[foot whipping]]).\n\nIn some circumstances the word \"flogging\" is used loosely to include any sort of [[corporal punishment]], including [[birching]] and [[caning]]. However, in British legal terminology, a distinction was drawn (and still is, in one or two colonial territories) between \"flogging\" (with a [[cat-o'-nine-tails]]) and \"whipping\" (formerly with a whip, but since the early 19th century with a birch). In Britain these were both abolished in 1948.\n\n==Current use as punishment==\n{{main|Judicial corporal punishment}}\nOfficially abolished in most Western countries, flogging or whipping, including [[foot whipping]] in some countries, is still a common punishment in some parts of the world, particularly in [[Application of Islamic law by country|countries using Islamic law]] and in some territories formerly under British rule. Medically supervised [[caning]] is routinely ordered by the courts as a penalty for some categories of crime in [[Caning in Singapore|Singapore]], [[Caning in Brunei|Brunei]], [[Caning in Malaysia|Malaysia]], Indonesia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and elsewhere.\n\nFlogging is a form of punishment used under Islamic [[Sharia]] law. It is the prescribed punishment (''[[hudud]]'') for offences including [[fornication]], alcohol use and slander and is also widely favoured as a discretionary punishment (''[[ta'zir]]'') for many offences, such as violating gender interaction laws (''[[zina]]''). Punishment is normally carried out in public. However, some scholars maintain that this goes against the teachings of Islam.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://islamqa.info/en/ref/72338/rape |title=Ruling on the crime of rape |date=9 January 2012}}</ref>\n[[Image:Prisoners whipped.jpg|thumb|200px|Prisoners at a whipping post in a [[Delaware]] prison, circa 1907]]\n\n==Historical use as punishment ==\n[[File:Johann Moritz Rugendas in Brazil.jpg|thumb|250px|Public flogging of a slave in [[Brazil]] - work of German painter [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]] (1802\u20131858).]]\n\n===Judaism===\n{{Main|Corporal punishment (Judaism)}}\n\nAccording to the [[Torah]] (Deuteronomy 25:1-3)  and [[Rabbinic law]] lashes may be given for offenses that do not merit capital punishment, and may not exceed 40. However, in the absence of a [[Sanhedrin]], corporal punishment is not practiced in Jewish law. [[Halakha]] specifies the lashes must be given in sets of three, so the total number cannot exceed 39. Also, the person whipped is first judged whether they can withstand the punishment, if not, the number of whips is decreased. [[Halakha|Jewish law]] limited flagellation to forty strokes, and in practice delivered thirty-nine, so as to avoid any possibility of breaking this law due to a miscount.\n\n===Antiquity===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nIn [[Sparta]], young men were flogged as a test of their masculinity.\n\nIn the [[Roman Empire]], flagellation was often used as a prelude to [[crucifixion]], and in this context is sometimes referred to as '''[[Scourge|scourging]]'''. Most famously according to the gospel accounts, [[Flagellation of Christ|this occurred]] prior to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion of Jesus Christ]].\n\nWhips with small pieces of metal or bone at the tips were commonly used. Such a device could easily cause disfigurement and serious trauma, such as ripping pieces of flesh from the body or loss of an eye. In addition to causing severe pain, the victim would approach a state of [[Hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]] due to loss of blood.\n\nThe Romans reserved this treatment for non-citizens, as stated in the ''lex Porcia'' and ''lex Sempronia'', dating from 195 and 123 BC. The poet [[Horace]] refers to the ''horribile flagellum'' (horrible whip) in his ''Satires''. Typically, the one to be punished was stripped naked and bound to a low pillar so that he could bend over it, or chained to an upright pillar so as to be stretched out. Two [[lictor]]s (some reports indicate scourgings with four or six lictors) alternated blows from the bare shoulders down the body to the soles of the feet. There was no limit to the number of blows inflicted&mdash;this was left to the lictors to decide, though they were normally not supposed to kill the victim. Nonetheless, [[Livy]], [[Suetonius]] and [[Josephus]] report cases of flagellation where victims died while still bound to the post. Flagellation was referred to as \"half death\" by some authors, as many victims died shortly thereafter. [[Cicero]] reports in ''In Verrem'', ''\"{{lang|la|pro mortuo sublatus brevi postea mortuus}}\"'' (\"taken away for a dead man, shortly thereafter he was dead\").\n\n===From Middle Ages to modern times===\n[[File:Supplice du Grand Knout.jpg|thumb|Punishment with a [[knout]]. Russia, 18th century.]]\nThe Whipping Act was passed in [[England]] in 1530. Under this legislation, [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]]s were to be taken to a nearby populated area \"and there tied to the end of a cart naked and beaten with whips throughout such market town till the body shall be bloody\".<ref>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Whipping|volume=28|pages=590\u2013591}}</ref>\n\nIn England, offenders (mostly those convicted of theft) were usually sentenced to be flogged \"at a cart's tail\" along a length of public street, usually near the scene of the crime, \"until his [or her] back be bloody\". In the late seventeenth century, however, the courts occasionally ordered that the flogging should be carried out in prison or a [[house of correction]] rather than on the streets. From the 1720s courts began explicitly to differentiate between private whipping and public whipping. Over the course of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the proportion of whippings carried out in public declined, but the number of private whippings increased. The public whipping of women was abolished in 1817 (after having been in decline since the 1770s) and that of men ended in the early 1830s, though not formally abolished until 1862. Private whipping of men in prison continued and was not abolished until 1948.<ref>[http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Punishment.jsp#corporal London lives]</ref> The 1948 abolition did not affect the ability of a prison's visiting justices (in England and Wales, but not in Scotland, except at Peterhead) to order the birch or cat for prisoners committing serious assaults on prison staff. This power was not abolished until 1967, having been last used in 1962.<ref>[https://www.corpun.com/counukj.htm]</ref>\n\nWhipping occurred during the French Revolution, though not as official punishment. On 31 May 1793, the Jacobin women seized a revolutionary leader, [[Anne Josephe Theroigne de Mericourt]], stripped her naked, and flogged her on the bare bottom in the public garden of the [[Tuileries]].  After this humiliation, she refused to wear any clothes, in memory of the outrage she had suffered.<ref>Roudinesco, Elisabeth (1992). ''Madness and Revolution: The Lives and Legends of Theroigne de Mericourt'', Verso. {{ISBN|0-86091-597-2}}. p.198</ref> She went mad and ended her days in an asylum after the public whipping.\n\nIn the [[Russian Empire]], [[knout]]s were used to flog criminals and political offenders. Sentences of a hundred lashes would usually result in death. Whipping was used as a punishment for [[Serfdom in Russia|Russian serfs]].<ref>Chapman, Tim (2001).

The scars are clearly visible because of [[keloid]] formation.]]\n\nWhipping has been used as a form of discipline on slaves. It was frequently carried out during the period of [[slavery in the United States]], by slave owners and their slaves. The power was also given to slave \"patrollers,\" mostly poor whites, who had among their powers the ability to whip any slave who violated the [[slave codes]].\n\n===Flogging as military punishment===\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, European armies administered floggings to common soldiers who committed breaches of the military code.\n\n====United States====\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War]], the American Congress raised the legal limit on lashes from 39 to 100 for soldiers who were convicted by courts-martial.<ref>Martin, p 76.</ref> Generally, officers were not flogged.

This many lashes could permanently disable or kill a man. [[Charles Oman]], historian of the [[Peninsular War]], noted that the maximum sentence was inflicted \"nine or ten times by general court-martial during the whole six years of the war\" and that 1,000 lashes were administered about 50 times.<ref>Oman, p 239.</ref> Other sentences were for 900, 700, 500 and 300 lashes. One soldier was sentenced to 700 lashes for stealing a beehive.<ref>Oman, p 246.</ref> Another man was let off after only 175 of 400 lashes, but spent three weeks in the hospital.<ref>Oman, p 254.</ref> Later in the war, the more draconian punishments were abandoned and the offenders shipped to New South Wales instead, where more whippings often awaited them. (See [[Flagellation#Australian penal colonies|Australian penal colonies]] section.) Oman later wrote: {{quote|If anything was calculated to brutalize an army it was the wicked cruelty of the British military punishment code, which [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] to the end of his life supported. There is plenty of authority for the fact that the man who had once received his 500 lashes for a fault which was small, or which involved no moral guilt, was often turned thereby from a good soldier into a bad soldier, by losing his self-respect and having his sense of justice seared out. Good officers knew this well enough, and did their best to avoid the cat-of-nine-tails, and to try more rational means{{mdash}}more often than not with success.<ref>Oman, p.43.</ref>}}\n\nThe 3rd battalion's [[Royal Anglian Regiment]] nickname of \"The Steelbacks\" is taken from one of its former regiments, the [[48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot]] who earned the nickname for their stoicism when being flogged with the cat-o'-nine tails (\"Not a whimper under the lash\"), a routine method of administering punishment in the Army in the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n\n====France====\nMeanwhile, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] the French Army stopped floggings altogether. The [[King's German Legion]] (KGL), which were German units in British pay, did not flog. In one case, a British soldier on detached duty with the KGL was sentenced to be flogged, but the German commander refused to carry out the punishment. When the British 73rd Foot flogged a man in occupied France in 1814, disgusted French citizens protested against it.<ref>Rothenberg, p.179.</ref>\n\n====Singapore====\n{{Main|Caning in Singapore}}\nOne of few countries where corporal punishment is still officially used in the armed forces is [[Singapore]], where military legislation provides that errant soldiers can be sentenced by court-martial to strokes of the cane. It is also used for crimes including but not limited to rape, vandalism and molestation etc.\n\n=== Australian penal colonies ===\n[[File:FremantletPrisonWhippingPost 2005 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|[[Fremantle Prison]] whipping post.]]\n{{See also|History of Australia}}\n\nOnce common in the [[British Army]] and British [[Royal Navy]] as a means of discipline, flagellation also featured prominently in the British [[penal colony|penal colonies]] in [[early colonial Australia]]. Given that convicts in Australia were already \"imprisoned\", punishments for offenses committed there could not usually result in imprisonment and thus usually consisted of corporal punishment such as [[hard labour]] or flagellation. Unlike Roman times, British law explicitly forbade the combination of corporal and [[capital punishment]]; thus, a convict was either flogged or hanged but never both.\n\nFlagellation took place either with a single whip or, more notoriously, with the [[cat o' nine tails]]. Typically, the offender's upper half was bared and he was suspended by the wrists beneath a tripod of wooden beams (known as 'the triangle').  In many cases, the offender's feet barely touched ground, which helped to stretch the skin taut and increase the damage inflicted by the whip.  It also centered the offender's weight in his shoulders, further ensuring a painful experience.\n\nWith the prisoner thus stripped and bound, either one or two floggers administered the prescribed number of strokes, or \"lashes,\" to the victim's back. During the flogging, a doctor or other medical worker was consulted at regular intervals as to the condition of the prisoner.  In many cases, however, the physician merely observed the offender to determine whether he was conscious.  If the prisoner passed out, the physician would order a halt until the prisoner was revived, and then the whipping would continue.\n\nFemale convicts were also subject to flogging as punishment, both on the convict ships and in the penal colonies. Although they were generally given fewer lashes than males (usually limited to 40 in each flogging), there was no other difference between the manner in which males and females were flogged.\n\nFloggings of both male and female convicts were public, administered before the whole colony's company, assembled especially for the purpose.  In addition to the infliction of pain, one of the principal purposes of the flogging was to humiliate the offender in front of his mates and to demonstrate, in a forceful way, that he had been required to submit to authority.\n\nAt the conclusion of the whipping, the prisoner's lacerated back was normally rinsed with [[brine]], which served as a crude and painful disinfectant.\n\nFlogging still continued for years after independence. The last person flogged in Australia was [[William John O'Meally]] in 1958 in [[Melbourne]]'s [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]].\n\n==As a religious practice==\n\n[[File:Striding flagellant.jpg|thumb|Self-flagellation is ritually performed in the [[Philippines]] during Holy Week (on [[Good Friday]], before Easter).]]\n{{Main|Self-flagellation}}\n\n===Antiquity===\nDuring the [[Ancient Roman religion|Ancient Roman festival]] of [[Lupercalia]] young men ran through the streets with thongs cut from the hide of goats which had just been sacrificed, and women who wished to conceive put themselves in their way to receive blows, apparently mostly on the hands.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The eunuch priests of the goddess [[Cybele]], the ''[[galli]]'', flogged themselves until they bled during the annual festival called [[Dies sanguinis]].

For a moderated subform of flagellation, described as ''bastinado'', the soles of a person's [[barefoot|bare feet]] are used as a target for beating (see [[foot whipping]]).\n\nIn some circumstances the word \"flogging\" is used loosely to include any sort of [[corporal punishment]], including [[birching]] and [[caning]]. However, in British legal terminology, a distinction was drawn (and still is, in one or two colonial territories) between \"flogging\" (with a [[cat-o'-nine-tails]]) and \"whipping\" (formerly with a whip, but since the early 19th century with a birch). In Britain these were both abolished in 1948.\n\n==Current use as punishment==\n{{main|Judicial corporal punishment}}\nOfficially abolished in most Western countries, flogging or whipping, including [[foot whipping]] in some countries, is still a common punishment in some parts of the world, particularly in [[Application of Islamic law by country|countries using Islamic law]] and in some territories formerly under British rule. Medically supervised [[caning]] is routinely ordered by the courts as a penalty for some categories of crime in [[Caning in Singapore|Singapore]], [[Caning in Brunei|Brunei]], [[Caning in Malaysia|Malaysia]], Indonesia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe and elsewhere.\n\nFlogging is a form of punishment used under Islamic [[Sharia]] law. It is the prescribed punishment (''[[hudud]]'') for offences including [[fornication]], alcohol use and slander and is also widely favoured as a discretionary punishment (''[[ta'zir]]'') for many offences, such as violating gender interaction laws (''[[zina]]''). Punishment is normally carried out in public. However, some scholars maintain that this goes against the teachings of Islam.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://islamqa.info/en/ref/72338/rape |title=Ruling on the crime of rape |date=9 January 2012}}</ref>\n[[Image:Prisoners whipped.jpg|thumb|200px|Prisoners at a whipping post in a [[Delaware]] prison, circa 1907]]\n\n==Historical use as punishment ==\n[[File:Johann Moritz Rugendas in Brazil.jpg|thumb|250px|Public flogging of a slave in [[Brazil]] - work of German painter [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]] (1802\u20131858).]]\n\n===Judaism===\n{{Main|Corporal punishment (Judaism)}}\n\nAccording to the [[Torah]] (Deuteronomy 25:1-3)  and [[Rabbinic law]] lashes may be given for offenses that do not merit capital punishment, and may not exceed 40. However, in the absence of a [[Sanhedrin]], corporal punishment is not practiced in Jewish law. [[Halakha]] specifies the lashes must be given in sets of three, so the total number cannot exceed 39. Also, the person whipped is first judged whether they can withstand the punishment, if not, the number of whips is decreased. [[Halakha|Jewish law]] limited flagellation to forty strokes, and in practice delivered thirty-nine, so as to avoid any possibility of breaking this law due to a miscount.\n\n===Antiquity===\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}\nIn [[Sparta]], young men were flogged as a test of their masculinity.\n\nIn the [[Roman Empire]], flagellation was often used as a prelude to [[crucifixion]], and in this context is sometimes referred to as '''[[Scourge|scourging]]'''. Most famously according to the gospel accounts, [[Flagellation of Christ|this occurred]] prior to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion of Jesus Christ]].\n\nWhips with small pieces of metal or bone at the tips were commonly used. Such a device could easily cause disfigurement and serious trauma, such as ripping pieces of flesh from the body or loss of an eye. In addition to causing severe pain, the victim would approach a state of [[Hypovolemia|hypovolemic shock]] due to loss of blood.\n\nThe Romans reserved this treatment for non-citizens, as stated in the ''lex Porcia'' and ''lex Sempronia'', dating from 195 and 123 BC. The poet [[Horace]] refers to the ''horribile flagellum'' (horrible whip) in his ''Satires''. Typically, the one to be punished was stripped naked and bound to a low pillar so that he could bend over it, or chained to an upright pillar so as to be stretched out. Two [[lictor]]s (some reports indicate scourgings with four or six lictors) alternated blows from the bare shoulders down the body to the soles of the feet. There was no limit to the number of blows inflicted&mdash;this was left to the lictors to decide, though they were normally not supposed to kill the victim. Nonetheless, [[Livy]], [[Suetonius]] and [[Josephus]] report cases of flagellation where victims died while still bound to the post. Flagellation was referred to as \"half death\" by some authors, as many victims died shortly thereafter. [[Cicero]] reports in ''In Verrem'', ''\"{{lang|la|pro mortuo sublatus brevi postea mortuus}}\"'' (\"taken away for a dead man, shortly thereafter he was dead\").\n\n===From Middle Ages to modern times===\n[[File:Supplice du Grand Knout.jpg|thumb|Punishment with a [[knout]]. Russia, 18th century.]]\nThe Whipping Act was passed in [[England]] in 1530. Under this legislation, [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]]s were to be taken to a nearby populated area \"and there tied to the end of a cart naked and beaten with whips throughout such market town till the body shall be bloody\".<ref>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Whipping|volume=28|pages=590\u2013591}}</ref>\n\nIn England, offenders (mostly those convicted of theft) were usually sentenced to be flogged \"at a cart's tail\" along a length of public street, usually near the scene of the crime, \"until his [or her] back be bloody\". In the late seventeenth century, however, the courts occasionally ordered that the flogging should be carried out in prison or a [[house of correction]] rather than on the streets. From the 1720s courts began explicitly to differentiate between private whipping and public whipping. Over the course of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the proportion of whippings carried out in public declined, but the number of private whippings increased. The public whipping of women was abolished in 1817 (after having been in decline since the 1770s) and that of men ended in the early 1830s, though not formally abolished until 1862. Private whipping of men in prison continued and was not abolished until 1948.<ref>[http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Punishment.jsp#corporal London lives]</ref> The 1948 abolition did not affect the ability of a prison's visiting justices (in England and Wales, but not in Scotland, except at Peterhead) to order the birch or cat for prisoners committing serious assaults on prison staff. This power was not abolished until 1967, having been last used in 1962.<ref>[https://www.corpun.com/counukj.htm]</ref>\n\nWhipping occurred during the French Revolution, though not as official punishment. On 31 May 1793, the Jacobin women seized a revolutionary leader, [[Anne Josephe Theroigne de Mericourt]], stripped her naked, and flogged her on the bare bottom in the public garden of the [[Tuileries]].  After this humiliation, she refused to wear any clothes, in memory of the outrage she had suffered.<ref>Roudinesco, Elisabeth (1992). ''Madness and Revolution: The Lives and Legends of Theroigne de Mericourt'', Verso. {{ISBN|0-86091-597-2}}. p.198</ref> She went mad and ended her days in an asylum after the public whipping.\n\nIn the [[Russian Empire]], [[knout]]s were used to flog criminals and political offenders. Sentences of a hundred lashes would usually result in death. Whipping was used as a punishment for [[Serfdom in Russia|Russian serfs]].<ref>Chapman, Tim (2001).

The scars are clearly visible because of [[keloid]] formation.]]\n\nWhipping has been used as a form of discipline on slaves. It was frequently carried out during the period of [[slavery in the United States]], by slave owners and their slaves. The power was also given to slave \"patrollers,\" mostly poor whites, who had among their powers the ability to whip any slave who violated the [[slave codes]].\n\n===Flogging as military punishment===\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, European armies administered floggings to common soldiers who committed breaches of the military code.\n\n====United States====\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War]], the American Congress raised the legal limit on lashes from 39 to 100 for soldiers who were convicted by courts-martial.<ref>Martin, p 76.</ref> Generally, officers were not flogged.

[[John O'Connor Power]], the member for Mayo, asked the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] to bring the navy cat-of-nine-tails to the [[House of Commons Library|Commons Library]] so that the members might see what they were voting about.  It was the Great \"Cat\" Contention, \"Mr Speaker, since the Government has let the cat out of the bag, there is nothing to be done but to take the bull by the horns.\" [[Poet Laureate]] [[Ted Hughes]] celebrates the occasion in his poem, \"Wilfred Owen's Photographs\": \"A witty profound Irishman calls/For a 'cat' into the House, and sits to watch/The gentry fingering its stained tails./Whereupon ...Quietly, unopposed,/The motion was passed.\"<ref>Hughes, Ted, \"Wilfred Owen's Photographs\", ''Lupercal'', 1960.

This many lashes could permanently disable or kill a man. [[Charles Oman]], historian of the [[Peninsular War]], noted that the maximum sentence was inflicted \"nine or ten times by general court-martial during the whole six years of the war\" and that 1,000 lashes were administered about 50 times.<ref>Oman, p 239.</ref> Other sentences were for 900, 700, 500 and 300 lashes. One soldier was sentenced to 700 lashes for stealing a beehive.<ref>Oman, p 246.</ref> Another man was let off after only 175 of 400 lashes, but spent three weeks in the hospital.<ref>Oman, p 254.</ref> Later in the war, the more draconian punishments were abandoned and the offenders shipped to New South Wales instead, where more whippings often awaited them. (See [[Flagellation#Australian penal colonies|Australian penal colonies]] section.) Oman later wrote: {{quote|If anything was calculated to brutalize an army it was the wicked cruelty of the British military punishment code, which [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] to the end of his life supported. There is plenty of authority for the fact that the man who had once received his 500 lashes for a fault which was small, or which involved no moral guilt, was often turned thereby from a good soldier into a bad soldier, by losing his self-respect and having his sense of justice seared out. Good officers knew this well enough, and did their best to avoid the cat-of-nine-tails, and to try more rational means{{mdash}}more often than not with success.<ref>Oman, p.43.</ref>}}\n\nThe 3rd battalion's [[Royal Anglian Regiment]] nickname of \"The Steelbacks\" is taken from one of its former regiments, the [[48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot]] who earned the nickname for their stoicism when being flogged with the cat-o'-nine tails (\"Not a whimper under the lash\"), a routine method of administering punishment in the Army in the 18th and early 19th centuries.\n\n====France====\nMeanwhile, during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] the French Army stopped floggings altogether. The [[King's German Legion]] (KGL), which were German units in British pay, did not flog. In one case, a British soldier on detached duty with the KGL was sentenced to be flogged, but the German commander refused to carry out the punishment. When the British 73rd Foot flogged a man in occupied France in 1814, disgusted French citizens protested against it.<ref>Rothenberg, p.179.</ref>\n\n====Singapore====\n{{Main|Caning in Singapore}}\nOne of few countries where corporal punishment is still officially used in the armed forces is [[Singapore]], where military legislation provides that errant soldiers can be sentenced by court-martial to strokes of the cane. It is also used for crimes including but not limited to rape, vandalism and molestation etc.\n\n=== Australian penal colonies ===\n[[File:FremantletPrisonWhippingPost 2005 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|[[Fremantle Prison]] whipping post.]]\n{{See also|History of Australia}}\n\nOnce common in the [[British Army]] and British [[Royal Navy]] as a means of discipline, flagellation also featured prominently in the British [[penal colony|penal colonies]] in [[early colonial Australia]]. Given that convicts in Australia were already \"imprisoned\", punishments for offenses committed there could not usually result in imprisonment and thus usually consisted of corporal punishment such as [[hard labour]] or flagellation. Unlike Roman times, British law explicitly forbade the combination of corporal and [[capital punishment]]; thus, a convict was either flogged or hanged but never both.\n\nFlagellation took place either with a single whip or, more notoriously, with the [[cat o' nine tails]]. Typically, the offender's upper half was bared and he was suspended by the wrists beneath a tripod of wooden beams (known as 'the triangle').  In many cases, the offender's feet barely touched ground, which helped to stretch the skin taut and increase the damage inflicted by the whip.  It also centered the offender's weight in his shoulders, further ensuring a painful experience.\n\nWith the prisoner thus stripped and bound, either one or two floggers administered the prescribed number of strokes, or \"lashes,\" to the victim's back. During the flogging, a doctor or other medical worker was consulted at regular intervals as to the condition of the prisoner.  In many cases, however, the physician merely observed the offender to determine whether he was conscious.  If the prisoner passed out, the physician would order a halt until the prisoner was revived, and then the whipping would continue.\n\nFemale convicts were also subject to flogging as punishment, both on the convict ships and in the penal colonies. Although they were generally given fewer lashes than males (usually limited to 40 in each flogging), there was no other difference between the manner in which males and females were flogged.\n\nFloggings of both male and female convicts were public, administered before the whole colony's company, assembled especially for the purpose.  In addition to the infliction of pain, one of the principal purposes of the flogging was to humiliate the offender in front of his mates and to demonstrate, in a forceful way, that he had been required to submit to authority.\n\nAt the conclusion of the whipping, the prisoner's lacerated back was normally rinsed with [[brine]], which served as a crude and painful disinfectant.\n\nFlogging still continued for years after independence. The last person flogged in Australia was [[William John O'Meally]] in 1958 in [[Melbourne]]'s [[HM Prison Pentridge|Pentridge Prison]].\n\n==As a religious practice==\n\n[[File:Striding flagellant.jpg|thumb|Self-flagellation is ritually performed in the [[Philippines]] during Holy Week (on [[Good Friday]], before Easter).]]\n{{Main|Self-flagellation}}\n\n===Antiquity===\nDuring the [[Ancient Roman religion|Ancient Roman festival]] of [[Lupercalia]] young men ran through the streets with thongs cut from the hide of goats which had just been sacrificed, and women who wished to conceive put themselves in their way to receive blows, apparently mostly on the hands.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The eunuch priests of the goddess [[Cybele]], the ''[[galli]]'', flogged themselves until they bled during the annual festival called [[Dies sanguinis]].
