{"title_page": "Capcom Five", "text_new": "{{short description|Five Capcom video games for GameCube}}\n[[File:GameCube-Set.jpg|thumb|The Capcom Five, as originally announced, represented an unprecedented level of [[video game development party|third-party developer]] support for [[GameCube]].]]\nThe '''Capcom Five''' are five [[video game]]s that were unveiled by [[Capcom]] in late 2002 and published from March 2003. At a time when [[Nintendo]]'s [[GameCube]] [[video game console|console]] had failed to capture [[market share]], Capcom announced five new GameCube titles with the apparent goal of boosting hardware sales and showing off [[video game development party|third-party developer]] support. Capcom USA followed up with confirmation that they would be [[console exclusivity|exclusive]] to the GameCube. The five games were ''[[P.N.03]]'', a futuristic [[third-person shooter]]; ''[[Viewtiful Joe]]'', a [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[action game|action]]-[[platform game|platformer]]; ''Dead Phoenix'', a [[shoot 'em up]]; ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'', a [[survival horror]] third-person shooter; and ''[[Killer7]]'', an [[action-adventure game]] with [[first-person shooter]] elements. Though not directly related to each other, they were all overseen by ''[[Resident Evil]]'' director [[Shinji Mikami]] and, except ''Killer7'', developed by Capcom's Production Studio 4. Capcom USA later clarified that only ''Resident Evil 4'' was intended to be exclusive; the initial announcement was due to a miscommunication with their parent company.\n\nOf the five games, ''Dead Phoenix'' was canceled and only ''P.N.03'' remained a GameCube exclusive. It was a critical and commercial failure. Both ''Viewtiful Joe'' and ''Killer7'' sold modestly, the former despite critical acclaim and the latter owing to polarized reviews. ''Killer7'' gained a significant [[cult following]], effectively launching the career of director [[Goichi Suda|Suda51]]. ''Resident Evil 4'' was the runaway success of the five, though its GameCube sales were undercut by the announcement of a [[PlayStation 2]] [[porting|port]] to be released later in 2005. ''Viewtiful Joe'' also saw a PlayStation 2 version with expanded features, and ''Killer7'' debuted on multiple platforms simultaneously. Since the release of the [[Nintendo 64]], Nintendo has struggled to attract third-party developers like Capcom to produce games for its systems. Industry analysts see the Capcom Five case, particularly the loss of GameCube exclusivity for ''Resident Evil 4'', as a major blow to Nintendo\u2013Capcom relations and is emblematic of Nintendo's failure to attract third-party support during the GameCube era.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] (SNES) eras, [[Nintendo]] and [[Capcom]] enjoyed a close relationship, with ''[[Mega Man]]'' as one of the NES' most prominent franchises.<ref name=\"kotaku\">{{cite web|author=Plunkett, Luke |url=http://kotaku.com/5806800/remembering-capcoms-great-nintendo-promise--betrayal |title=Remembering Capcom's Great Nintendo Promise / Betrayal |publisher=Kotaku |date=2011-05-31 |accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> This closeness was partially due to Nintendo's [[monopoly]] of the [[video game console]] market, which allowed the company to compel [[video game development party|third-party developers]] to release exclusive content according to Nintendo's schedule.<ref>{{cite web |author=Orland, Kyle |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/08/the-rise-and-fall-and-rise-and-fall-of-gamings-third-party-exclusives/ |title=The rise and fall (and rise and fall) of gaming\u2019s third-party exclusives |date=2014-08-13 |accessdate=2015-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Game Over |last=Sheff |first=David |authorlink=David Sheff |year=1993 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=0-679-40469-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/gameoverhowninte00shef/page/214 214\u2013215] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/gameoverhowninte00shef/page/214 }}</ref> [[Sega]]'s rival [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] system forced Nintendo to relax some of its restrictions on third parties with respect to the SNES.

However, each successive game's release reinforced Capcom's view that the GameCube was unprofitable; they ported the games one-by-one to Sony's PlayStation 2.<ref name=\"Capcom\"/> These ports were generally inferior in quality: many reviewers noted slowdown issues and lower resolution graphics.<ref name=\"K7IGN\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Mirabella III, Fran |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/660/660397p4.html |title=Resident Evil 4 Review |publisher=IGN |date=2005-10-21 |accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> Ultimately, four games were released and only one remained exclusive to GameCube.<ref name=\"kotaku\"/> This lone GameCube exclusive was ''P.N.03'' and not ''Resident Evil 4'', as Capcom had repeatedly emphasized in press releases.

The first was to focus on multi-platform releases.<ref name=\"Capcom\"/> Second, Capcom needed to streamline development.

At a time when [[Nintendo]]'s [[GameCube]] [[video game console|console]] had failed to capture [[market share]], Capcom announced five new GameCube titles with the apparent goal of boosting hardware sales and showing off [[video game development party|third-party developer]] support. Capcom USA followed up with confirmation that they would be [[console exclusivity|exclusive]] to the GameCube. The five games were ''[[P.N.03]]'', a futuristic [[third-person shooter]]; ''[[Viewtiful Joe]]'', a [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[action game|action]]-[[platform game|platformer]]; ''Dead Phoenix'', a [[shoot 'em up]]; ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'', a [[survival horror]] third-person shooter; and ''[[Killer7]]'', an [[action-adventure game]] with [[first-person shooter]] elements. Though not directly related to each other, they were all overseen by ''[[Resident Evil]]'' director [[Shinji Mikami]] and, except ''Killer7'', developed by Capcom's Production Studio 4. Capcom USA later clarified that only ''Resident Evil 4'' was intended to be exclusive; the initial announcement was due to a miscommunication with their parent company.\n\nOf the five games, ''Dead Phoenix'' was canceled and only ''P.N.03'' remained a GameCube exclusive. It was a critical and commercial failure. Both ''Viewtiful Joe'' and ''Killer7'' sold modestly, the former despite critical acclaim and the latter owing to polarized reviews. ''Killer7'' gained a significant [[cult following]], effectively launching the career of director [[Goichi Suda|Suda51]]. ''Resident Evil 4'' was the runaway success of the five, though its GameCube sales were undercut by the announcement of a [[PlayStation 2]] [[porting|port]] to be released later in 2005. ''Viewtiful Joe'' also saw a PlayStation 2 version with expanded features, and ''Killer7'' debuted on multiple platforms simultaneously. Since the release of the [[Nintendo 64]], Nintendo has struggled to attract third-party developers like Capcom to produce games for its systems. Industry analysts see the Capcom Five case, particularly the loss of GameCube exclusivity for ''Resident Evil 4'', as a major blow to Nintendo\u2013Capcom relations and is emblematic of Nintendo's failure to attract third-party support during the GameCube era.\n\n==Background==\nDuring the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] (SNES) eras, [[Nintendo]] and [[Capcom]] enjoyed a close relationship, with ''[[Mega Man]]'' as one of the NES' most prominent franchises.<ref name=\"kotaku\">{{cite web|author=Plunkett, Luke |url=http://kotaku.com/5806800/remembering-capcoms-great-nintendo-promise--betrayal |title=Remembering Capcom's Great Nintendo Promise / Betrayal |publisher=Kotaku |date=2011-05-31 |accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> This closeness was partially due to Nintendo's [[monopoly]] of the [[video game console]] market, which allowed the company to compel [[video game development party|third-party developers]] to release exclusive content according to Nintendo's schedule.<ref>{{cite web |author=Orland, Kyle |url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/08/the-rise-and-fall-and-rise-and-fall-of-gamings-third-party-exclusives/ |title=The rise and fall (and rise and fall) of gaming\u2019s third-party exclusives |date=2014-08-13 |accessdate=2015-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Game Over |last=Sheff |first=David |authorlink=David Sheff |year=1993 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=0-679-40469-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/gameoverhowninte00shef/page/214 214\u2013215] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/gameoverhowninte00shef/page/214 }}</ref> [[Sega]]'s rival [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] system forced Nintendo to relax some of its restrictions on third parties with respect to the SNES.

As a matter of fact, the treatment consists on an injection of proteolytic enzymes to dissolve the herniated nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs.  Purified chymopapain is the main component of the injection, composed basically of 20&nbsp;mg in five millilitres.  It is provided in vials containing 10.000 units of the [[Freeze-drying|lyophilized]] agent with 0.37&nbsp;mg of disodium edetate,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/EDTA_disodium_salt#section=Top|title=Edetate disodium }}</ref> 3.5&nbsp;mg of cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate and 1.0&nbsp;mg of bisulfide. All of them work as stabilisers and activators. Sodium hydroxide is in charge of adjusting the PH of the solution. Then, the injection is rehydrated with 5 milillitres of steril water.\n\nA surgeon injects the solution directly into the herniated disc on the spine to dissolve part of it and ease the pain. This process is under fluoroscopic control. Chymopapain is responsible for catalysis, both in vivo and in vitro, a rapid reduction in the viscosity and, as a consequence, the weight of the [[nucleus pulposus]]. In fact, it is a [[depolymerization]] of the chondromuchoprotein<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/chondromucoprotein|title=Description of chondromucoprotein|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and a decrease in the ability of a disk to imbibe fluid. The dose for a single [[intervertebral disc]] is 2 to 4 nano[[katal]]s, with a maximum dose per patient of 8 nanokatals.

Chemonucleolysis in lumbar disc herniation: a meta-analysis. Clinics. 2007;62(2):175-80|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This method was a new proposal to treat primary lumbar [[intervertebral disc]] disease using a nonsurgical method. As a matter of fact, the treatment consists on an injection of proteolytic enzymes to dissolve the herniated nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs.  Purified chymopapain is the main component of the injection, composed basically of 20&nbsp;mg in five millilitres.  It is provided in vials containing 10.000 units of the [[Freeze-drying|lyophilized]] agent with 0.37&nbsp;mg of disodium edetate,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/EDTA_disodium_salt#section=Top|title=Edetate disodium }}</ref> 3.5&nbsp;mg of cysteine hydrochloride monohydrate and 1.0&nbsp;mg of bisulfide. All of them work as stabilisers and activators. Sodium hydroxide is in charge of adjusting the PH of the solution. Then, the injection is rehydrated with 5 milillitres of steril water.\n\nA surgeon injects the solution directly into the herniated disc on the spine to dissolve part of it and ease the pain. This process is under fluoroscopic control. Chymopapain is responsible for catalysis, both in vivo and in vitro, a rapid reduction in the viscosity and, as a consequence, the weight of the [[nucleus pulposus]]. In fact, it is a [[depolymerization]] of the chondromuchoprotein<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/chondromucoprotein|title=Description of chondromucoprotein|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and a decrease in the ability of a disk to imbibe fluid. The dose for a single [[intervertebral disc]] is 2 to 4 nano[[katal]]s, with a maximum dose per patient of 8 nanokatals. Chymopapain injections are normally given under local, rather than general, [[anaesthesia]].\n\nThis enzyme has been studied by important universities departments around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/237/4/1086.full.pdf|title=Study about chymopapain|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Knezevic NN, Mandalia S, Raasch J, Knezevic I, Candido KD | title = Treatment of chronic low back pain - new approaches on the horizon | language = English | journal = Journal of Pain Research | volume = 10 | pages = 1111\u20131123 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28546769 | pmc = 5436786 | doi = 10.2147/jpr.s132769 | url = https://www.dovepress.com/treatment-of-chronic-low-back-pain-new-approaches-on-the-horizon-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-JPR }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wardlaw D | title = Sciatica caused by disc herniation: Why is Chymopapain Chemonucleolysis denied to our patients? | journal = International Journal of Spine Surgery | volume = 10 | pages = 44 | year = 2016 | pmid = 28377858 | pmc = 5374990 | doi = 10.14444/3044 }}</ref> It was tested as much in animals as in humans and, very rarely, did it cause serious side effects including [[paralysis]] of the legs and [[death]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Chymopapain | url = http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/drug-information/DR600373 | publisher = The Mayo Clinic }}</ref> It could also caused [[anaphylaxis]], but it was only seen in  1% of the patients who received the medication.\n\nThe sale and distribution of chymopapain was discontinued in the United States on January 27, 2003 after the company producing it decided to stop selling it worldwide.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/drug-information/DR600373 | title=Chymopapain (Injection Route) Description and Brand Names - Mayo Clinic}}</ref><ref>[http://www.sciatica.com/physician--information/scientific-articles/file/24-the-current-status-of-chymopapain.html The Current Status of Chymopapain]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Papain]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*The [[MEROPS]] online database for peptidases and their inhibitors: [http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/merops.cgi?id=C01.002 C01.002]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140715224627/http://www.biozym.de/datasheets/papain.php Data sheet for Papain from BIOZYM]\n\n{{Cysteine proteases}}\n{{Enzymes}}\n{{Portal bar|Biology|border=no}}\n\n[[Category:Enzymes used as drugs]]\n[[Category:Drugs acting on the musculoskeletal system]]\n[[Category:EC 3.4.22]]\n", "name_user": "Fswitzer4", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added CAS", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chymopapain"}
