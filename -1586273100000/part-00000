While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric [[heat pump]] has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very high [[coefficient of performance]] of heat pumps.\n\n\nThe economics of switching the demand side from fossil fuels to electricity for heating, will depend on the price of fuels vs electricity and the relative prices of the equipment. Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]]. Since thermostatically controlled loads have inherent energy storage, electrification of heating could provide a valuable resource to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid.\n\nAlternatives to electrification, include decarbonizing pipeline gas through [[power to gas]], [[biogas]], or other [[carbon-neutral fuels]].\n\nAt the beginning of this century 70% of all electricity was generated by fossil fuels, and as carbon free sources eventually make up half of the generation mix, replacing gas or oil furnaces and water heaters with electric ones will have a climate benefit. In areas like Norway, [[Brazil]], and [[Quebec]] that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water are common.\n\n=====Heat pump=====\n{{Main|Heat pump}}\n[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|upright|Outside unit of an air-source heat pump]]\nA heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a \"heat sink\". Heat pumps are designed to move [[thermal energy]] opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.\n\nWhile [[air conditioner]]s and [[freezer]]s are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term \"heat pump\" is more general and applies to many [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic [[heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration-type cycle]] used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction\u2014releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment. In this use, heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground.<ref>[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/28037.pdf Air-source heat pumps] [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] June 2011</ref> In heating mode, heat pumps are three to four times [[efficient energy use|more efficient]] in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIt has been concluded that heat pumps are the single technology that could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other technology that is available on the market.

For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. \n\nEnergy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing [[world energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses reducing demand for a service service, for example through behavioral change, as well as encompassing energy efficiency. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter or driving less. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms. This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels.<ref>Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.</ref>\n\nReducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental [[super grid]]s costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power, there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittency, power failures and peak demands. Having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a [[smart grid]].\n\n[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.\n\n[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits.\n\n[[Demand response]] devices can receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This allows electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. [[Vehicle-to-grid]] uses a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.\n\n===Lifestyle and behavior===\n\nThe [[IPCC]] [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] emphasises that behaviour, lifestyle, and cultural change have a high mitigation potential in some sectors, particularly when complementing technological and structural change.<ref name=\"edenhofer-etal-2014\">{{cite book\n|first1= Ottmar | last1= Edenhofer\n|first2= Ram\u00f3n | last2= Pichs-Madruga\n|display-authors= etal\n|editor= IPCC\n|year= 2014\n|title= Climate change 2014: mitigation of climate change.

The main natural process is [[photosynthesis]] by plants and single-celled organisms (see [[biosequestration]]). Artificial processes vary, and concerns have been expressed about the long-term effects of some of these processes.<ref name=RoyalSociety>The Royal Society, (2009) [http://royalsociety.org/displaypagedoc.asp?id=35151 \"Geoengineering the climate: science, governance and uncertainty\"].

Personal cars are extremely inefficient at moving passengers, while [[public transport]] and bicycles are many times more efficient (as is the simplest form of human transportation, walking). All of these are encouraged by urban/community planning and are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Inefficient [[land use]] development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.\n\nAt the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These [[smart growth]] practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space. These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nApproaches such as [[New Urbanism]] and [[transit-oriented development]] seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage [[public transit]] and make [[walking]] and [[cycling]] more attractive options. This is achieved through \"medium-density\", [[mixed-use development|mixed-use planning]] and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.<!--Energy usage comparisons done in the book \"Sustainability and Cities\" by Peter Newman and Jeff Kentworthy.-->\n\nSmarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.\n\n====Building design====\n{{Main|Sustainable architecture|Green building}}\n\nEmissions from [[house|housing]] are substantial,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.est.org.uk/myhome/climatechange/stats/homeenvironment/ |title=Energy Saving Trust: Home and the environment |publisher=[[Energy Saving Trust]] |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> and government-supported energy efficiency programmes can make a difference.<ref>{{cite news\n|last= Osborne\n|first= Hilary\n|title= Energy efficiency 'saves \u00a3350m a year'\n|newspaper= Guardian Unlimited\n|date= 2005-08-02\n|url= http://money.guardian.co.uk/utilities/story/0,11992,1541051,00.html?gusrc=ticker-103704\n|location=London}}</ref>\n\nNew buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources.

For richer people, emissions tend to be associated with things such as eating [[beef]], [[car]]s, [[Frequent-flyer program|frequent flying]], and [[Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning|home heating]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theccc.org.uk/publication/behaviour-change-public-engagement-and-net-zero-imperial-college-london/|title=Behaviour change, public engagement and Net Zero (Imperial College London)|website=Committee on Climate Change|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref> The impacts of cutting emissions could therefore have different impacts on human [[welfare economics|welfare]] according to wealth.\n\n====Distributing emissions abatement costs====\nThere have been different proposals on how to allocate responsibility for cutting emissions (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;103\u2013105):<ref name=banuri/>\n*'''[[Egalitarianism]]''': this system interprets the problem as one where each person has equal rights to a global resource, i.e., polluting the atmosphere.\n*'''Basic needs''': this system would have emissions allocated according to basic needs, as defined according to a minimum level of [[consumption (economics)|consumption]]. Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.\n*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the \"polluter-pays principle\", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:\n**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;29).<ref name=goldemberg>{{cite book\n|year=1996\n|author=Goldemberg, J.\n|title=Introduction: scope of the assessment.

Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].\n**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit{{cn|date=November 2019}} from reducing their emissions.\n\n====Specific proposals====\n*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;106),<ref name=banuri/> for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.\n*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;106\u2013107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.\n*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;27).<ref name=goldemberg/> In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource. It was also recognized by the state that part of the other state's economy was dependent on that resource.\n\n==Governmental and intergovernmental action==\n{{Main|Politics of global warming}}\n{{See also|Global warming#Political response}}\n{{Reduced pull quote|1=right\n|2=Bringing down emissions of greenhouse gases asks a good deal of people, not least that they accept the science of climate change.

These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.<ref name=\"Evans\">Evans. J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon</ref>\n\n====Funding====\n{{main|Climate Finance}}\nFunding, such as the [[Green Climate Fund]], is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.<ref name=\"Evans\"/> The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which [[land degradation]] and [[persistent organic pollutant]] were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF's implementing agencies.<ref>Mee. L. D, Dublin. H.

The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.<ref name=\"IHDP\">Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat.

One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund<ref>[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit</ref> is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.\n\nAn important point of contention, however, is how [[overseas development]] assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.<ref name=ODI>Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.<ref name=ODI/> Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:<ref name=ODI/>\n# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];\n# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;\n# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and\n# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.\nThe main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref name=ODI/>\n\nHowever, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.\n\nIn an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] \"which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services\".<ref>[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&Cr=trade&Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2019 week of climate action in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] result in a declaration in which leaders says that they will act to reduce emissions in the sectors of transportation, energy, urbanism, industry, forest conservation and land use and \"sent a message of solidarity with all the people of Brazil suffering the consequences of the [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|rainforest fires in the Amazon region]], underscoring that protecting the world's forests is a collective responsibility, that forests are vital for life and that they are a critical part of the solution to climate change\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 Key Messages for the UN Climate Action Summit |url=https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/LACCW%202019%20Messages%20for%20UN%20Climate%20Action%20Summit.pdf |website=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Latin American & Caribbean Climate Week Calls for Urgent, Ambitious Action |url=https://unfccc.int/news/latin-american-caribbean-climate-week-calls-for-urgent-ambitious-action |website=United Nations Climate Change |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Non-governmental approaches==\nWhile many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.\n\n===Choices in personal actions and business operations===\nEnvironmental groups encourage [[individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]].

While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric [[heat pump]] has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very high [[coefficient of performance]] of heat pumps.\n\n\nThe economics of switching the demand side from fossil fuels to electricity for heating, will depend on the price of fuels vs electricity and the relative prices of the equipment. Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]]. Since thermostatically controlled loads have inherent energy storage, electrification of heating could provide a valuable resource to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid.\n\nAlternatives to electrification, include decarbonizing pipeline gas through [[power to gas]], [[biogas]], or other [[carbon-neutral fuels]].\n\nAt the beginning of this century 70% of all electricity was generated by fossil fuels, and as carbon free sources eventually make up half of the generation mix, replacing gas or oil furnaces and water heaters with electric ones will have a climate benefit. In areas like Norway, [[Brazil]], and [[Quebec]] that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water are common.\n\n=====Heat pump=====\n{{Main|Heat pump}}\n[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|upright|Outside unit of an air-source heat pump]]\nA heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a \"heat sink\". Heat pumps are designed to move [[thermal energy]] opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.\n\nWhile [[air conditioner]]s and [[freezer]]s are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term \"heat pump\" is more general and applies to many [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic [[heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration-type cycle]] used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction\u2014releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment. In this use, heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground.<ref>[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/28037.pdf Air-source heat pumps] [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] June 2011</ref> In heating mode, heat pumps are three to four times [[efficient energy use|more efficient]] in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIt has been concluded that heat pumps are the single technology that could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other technology that is available on the market.

For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. \n\nEnergy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing [[world energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses reducing demand for a service service, for example through behavioral change, as well as encompassing energy efficiency. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter or driving less. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms. This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels.<ref>Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.</ref>\n\nReducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[energy-efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&itemid=2929&language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>\n\n===Smart grid===\n{{Main|Smart grid}}\nExpanding intermittent electrical sources, such as [[wind power]], creates a growing problem balancing grid fluctuations. Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental [[super grid]]s costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power, there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittency, power failures and peak demands. Having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a [[smart grid]].\n\n[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.\n\n[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits.\n\n[[Demand response]] devices can receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This allows electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. [[Vehicle-to-grid]] uses a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.\n\n===Lifestyle and behavior===\n\nThe [[IPCC]] [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] emphasises that behaviour, lifestyle, and cultural change have a high mitigation potential in some sectors, particularly when complementing technological and structural change.<ref name=\"edenhofer-etal-2014\">{{cite book\n|first1= Ottmar | last1= Edenhofer\n|first2= Ram\u00f3n | last2= Pichs-Madruga\n|display-authors= etal\n|editor= IPCC\n|year= 2014\n|title= Climate change 2014: mitigation of climate change.

This is achieved through \"medium-density\", [[mixed-use development|mixed-use planning]] and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.<!--Energy usage comparisons done in the book \"Sustainability and Cities\" by Peter Newman and Jeff Kentworthy.-->\n\nSmarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.\n\n====Building design====\n{{Main|Sustainable architecture|Green building}}\n\nEmissions from [[house|housing]] are substantial,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.est.org.uk/myhome/climatechange/stats/homeenvironment/ |title=Energy Saving Trust: Home and the environment |publisher=[[Energy Saving Trust]] |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> and government-supported energy efficiency programmes can make a difference.<ref>{{cite news\n|last= Osborne\n|first= Hilary\n|title= Energy efficiency 'saves \u00a3350m a year'\n|newspaper= Guardian Unlimited\n|date= 2005-08-02\n|url= http://money.guardian.co.uk/utilities/story/0,11992,1541051,00.html?gusrc=ticker-103704\n|location=London}}</ref>\n\nNew buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources.

Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.\n*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the \"polluter-pays principle\", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:\n**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;29).<ref name=goldemberg>{{cite book\n|year=1996\n|author=Goldemberg, J.\n|title=Introduction: scope of the assessment.

Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].\n**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit{{cn|date=November 2019}} from reducing their emissions.\n\n====Specific proposals====\n*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;106),<ref name=banuri/> for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.\n*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;106\u2013107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.\n*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;27).<ref name=goldemberg/> In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource. It was also recognized by the state that part of the other state's economy was dependent on that resource.\n\n==Governmental and intergovernmental action==\n{{Main|Politics of global warming}}\n{{See also|Global warming#Political response}}\n{{Reduced pull quote|1=right\n|2=Bringing down emissions of greenhouse gases asks a good deal of people, not least that they accept the science of climate change.

The scheme was due to be developed by April 2005 but has not yet been completed.\n\n===Implementation===\nImplementation puts into effect climate change mitigation strategies and targets. These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.<ref name=\"Evans\">Evans. J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon</ref>\n\n====Funding====\n{{main|Climate Finance}}\nFunding, such as the [[Green Climate Fund]], is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.<ref name=\"Evans\"/> The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which [[land degradation]] and [[persistent organic pollutant]] were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF's implementing agencies.<ref>Mee. L. D, Dublin. H.

The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.<ref name=\"IHDP\">Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat.

One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund<ref>[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit</ref> is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.\n\nAn important point of contention, however, is how [[overseas development]] assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.<ref name=ODI>Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.<ref name=ODI/> Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:<ref name=ODI/>\n# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];\n# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;\n# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and\n# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.\nThe main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref name=ODI/>\n\nHowever, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.\n\nIn an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] \"which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services\".<ref>[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&Cr=trade&Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2019 week of climate action in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] result in a declaration in which leaders says that they will act to reduce emissions in the sectors of transportation, energy, urbanism, industry, forest conservation and land use and \"sent a message of solidarity with all the people of Brazil suffering the consequences of the [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|rainforest fires in the Amazon region]], underscoring that protecting the world's forests is a collective responsibility, that forests are vital for life and that they are a critical part of the solution to climate change\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 Key Messages for the UN Climate Action Summit |url=https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/LACCW%202019%20Messages%20for%20UN%20Climate%20Action%20Summit.pdf |website=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Latin American & Caribbean Climate Week Calls for Urgent, Ambitious Action |url=https://unfccc.int/news/latin-american-caribbean-climate-week-calls-for-urgent-ambitious-action |website=United Nations Climate Change |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Non-governmental approaches==\nWhile many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.\n\n===Choices in personal actions and business operations===\nEnvironmental groups encourage [[individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]].

In modern times, the prevailing theory of \"''Survival of the Fittest''\" tells us that the human beings are a result of gradual evolution process starting from single-cell living beings. But the \"''Chaturyuga''\" system mentions about the declining journey of human beings across the ages. In \"Satya Yuga\", the human beings were at its peak. Then it gradually came down throughout Treta and Dwapara yuga. In Kali Yuga, it is supposed to hit the lowest possible stature. If we go by the ancient scriptures, they specify that the start and end of each of the \"Yuga\" was marked by astronomical alignments. At the beginning of Treta Yuga, 5 planets resided in \"Aries\" constellation.At the end of last \"Dwapara\" yuga, the \"Saptarshi\" constellation (Ursa major), resided in \"Magha\" constellation. At the end of ongoing Kali-Yuga, Sun, Moon and Jupiter is said to reside in \"Pushya\" sector simultaneously.<sup>[''[https://legendofbharatbarsha.home.blog/2019/12/07/detailed-history-of-time/ Source]'']</sup>\n\n<br />\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar|Astronomy|History|Philosophy|Hinduism|Religion|Mythology}}\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Age of the universe]]\n*[[Hindu cosmology]]\n*[[Hindu astronomy]]\n*[[Hindu calendar]]\n*[[Indian mathematics]]\n*[[Indian science and technology]]\n*[[Indian weights and measures]]\n*[[Jyotish]]\n*[[List of numbers in Hindu scriptures]]\n*[[Universe]]\n*[[Vedanga Jyotisha]]\n*[[Vedas]]\n*[[Yojana]]\n*[[Tamil units of measurement]]\n*[[Tamil months]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n*Victor J.

In modern times, the prevailing theory of \"''Survival of the Fittest''\" tells us that the human beings are a result of gradual evolution process starting from single-cell living beings. But the \"''Chaturyuga''\" system mentions about the declining journey of human beings across the ages. In \"Satya Yuga\", the human beings were at its peak. Then it gradually came down throughout Treta and Dwapara yuga. In Kali Yuga, it is supposed to hit the lowest possible stature. If we go by the ancient scriptures, they specify that the start and end of each of the \"Yuga\" was marked by astronomical alignments. At the beginning of Treta Yuga, 5 planets resided in \"Aries\" constellation.At the end of last \"Dwapara\" yuga, the \"Saptarshi\" constellation (Ursa major), resided in \"Magha\" constellation. At the end of ongoing Kali-Yuga, Sun, Moon and Jupiter is said to reside in \"Pushya\" sector simultaneously.<sup>[''[https://legendofbharatbarsha.home.blog/2019/12/07/detailed-history-of-time/ Source]'']</sup>\n\n==Current date==\n\nCurrently, 50 years of Brahma have elapsed.

The [[castle]] was founded by [[Robert de Vieuxpont|Robert I de Vieuxpont]] in the early 13th century. The site, near the confluence of the rivers, [[River Eamont|Eamont]] and [[River Lowther|Lowther]], had been chosen by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]] for a [[Roman fort]] called [[Brocavum]]. The castle is scheduled as an [[Ancient Monument]], along with the fort, as \"Brougham Roman fort and Brougham Castle\".<ref name=\"EH\">{{NHLE | num=1007186 | desc= | accessdate=14 October 2013|mode=cs2}}</ref>\n\nIn its earliest form, the castle consisted of a stone [[keep]], with an [[Motte-and-bailey castle|enclosure protected by an earthen bank]] and a wooden [[palisade]]. When the castle was built, Robert de Vieuxpont was one of the only [[History of the British peerage#Feudal origins|lords]] in the region who were loyal to [[John, King of England|King John]]. The Vieuxponts were a powerful land-owning family in [[North West England]], who also owned the castles of [[Appleby Castle|Appleby]] and [[Brough Castle|Brough]]. In 1264, Robert de Vieuxpont's grandson, also named Robert, was declared a traitor, and his property was confiscated by [[Henry III of England|Henry&nbsp;III]]. Brougham Castle and the other estates were eventually returned to the Vieuxpont family, and stayed in their possession, until 1269, when the estates passed to the [[Baron de Clifford|Clifford family]] through marriage.\n\nWith the outbreak of the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], in 1296, Brougham became an important military base for [[Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford|Robert Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford]]. He began refortifying the castle: the wooden outer defences were replaced with stronger, more impressive stone walls, and a large stone gatehouse was added. The importance of Brougham and Robert Clifford was such that, in 1300, he hosted King [[Edward I of England]] at the castle. Robert's son, [[Roger de Clifford, 2nd Baron de Clifford|Roger Clifford]], was executed as a traitor, in 1322, and the family estates passed into the possession of King [[Edward II of England]], although they were returned once his son [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] became king. The region was often at risk from the [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scots]], and in 1388, the castle was captured and sacked.\n\nFollowing this, the Cliffords began spending more time at their other castles, particularly [[Skipton Castle]] in [[Yorkshire]]. Brougham descended through several generations of Cliffords, intermittently serving as a residence. However, by 1592, it was in a state of disrepair, as [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland]] was spending more time in southern England due to his role as [[Queen's Champion]]. The castle was briefly restored in the early 17th century, to such an extent, that King [[James VI and I|James I of England]] was entertained there in 1617.<ref>''HMC Downshire'', vol. 6 (London, 1995), p. 141.</ref> In 1643, [[Lady Anne Clifford]] inherited the estates, including the castles of Brougham, Appleby, and Brough, and set about restoring them. Brougham Castle was kept in good condition for a short time, after Lady Anne's death in 1676; however, [[Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet]], who had inherited the Clifford estates, sold the furnishings in 1714. The empty shell was left to decay, as it was too costly to maintain. As a ruin, Brougham Castle inspired a painting by [[J. M. W. Turner]], and was mentioned at the start of [[William Wordsworth]]'s poem ''[[The Prelude]]'', as well as becoming the subject of Wordsworth's ''Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle upon the Restoration of Lord Clifford, the Shepherd, to the Estates and Honours of his Ancestors''. The castle was left to the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]], in the 1930s, and is today maintained by its successor, [[English Heritage]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:RiverEamontAtBroughamCastle(SimonLedingham)Jun2004.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Brougham Castle was built in the north part of a Roman fort, near the confluence of the River Eamont and River Lowther.]]\nThe site of Brougham Castle has been fortified since the Romans erected the [[castra|fort]] of ''[[Brocavum]]'' at the intersection of three [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman roads]]. With the rivers [[River Eamont|Eamont]] and [[River Lowther|Lowther]] flowing nearby and meeting to the west, the site had natural defences and the area was fertile and easy to cultivate. A [[Vicus (Rome)|civilian settlement]] grew around the fort. When [[Angles]] arrived in the area they named the place ''Brougham'', meaning \"the village by the fort\".<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=7\u20138.}}</ref> Between the end of Roman rule in the early 5th century and the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] in the late 11th century, Cumbria was a turbulent area. Although the site was a defendable position, there is no evidence that Brougham was refortified during this time. In 1092, [[William II of England|William&nbsp;II]] (also known as William Rufus) captured Cumbria south of the [[Solway Firth]] and established a new border far north of Brougham. The site at Brougham remained unfortified. [[Carlisle Castle]] secured the border, and castles at [[Appleby Castle|Appleby]] and [[Brough Castle|Brough]], both south east of Brougham, protected the line of communication from [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] to [[Yorkshire]].<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=8.}}</ref> In 1203, the [[Barony of Westmorland]]&nbsp;\u2013 containing Appleby, Brough, and Brougham&nbsp;\u2013 was granted to [[Vieuxpont#Robert de Vieuxpont|Robert de Vieuxpont]] by King [[John of England|John]]. A favourite of John's, Vieuxpont was one of only a few lords loyal to him in northern England, whose inhabitants became so discontented with the king's rule that they eventually rebelled. Around 1214, Vieuxpont asserted control over more land, including half the [[manorialism|manor]] of Brougham. It was in this atmosphere of unrest that Brougham Castle was founded.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=8\u20139.}}</ref>\n\n==Under the Vieuxponts==\nVieuxpont was one of only a few supporters of the king in northern England, and he most likely began construction of Brougham Castle as soon as he acquired the land. At this stage, the castle would have been enclosed by an earthen bank surmounted by a timber [[palisade]]. The first three storeys of the stone keep date from this period. It was entered through the first floor via a forebuilding. To the east of this was a stone structure which was probably a hall.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=9\u201310.}}</ref> Building in stone was an expensive and time-consuming process. No records tell us how much Brougham cost to construct, but there are records for other stone construction. For example, the late-12th-century stone keep<ref>{{PastScape|mnumber=309632 |mname=Peveril Castle |accessdate=2010-02-24|mode=cs2}}</ref> at [[Peveril Castle]] in [[Derbyshire]] would have cost around \u00a3200, although something on a much larger scale, such as the vast [[Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard]], cost an estimated \u00a315,000 to \u00a320,000 and took several years to complete.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|1992|pp=41\u201342.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1216, when a Scottish army invaded the [[River Eden, Cumbria|Eden valley]] and [[Alan of Galloway]] occupied Westmorland, Brougham Castle played no part in the county's defence, probably because it was unfinished. Construction would have been suspended until Alan retreated in 1217. Vieuxpont received control over the king's revenues from Cumberland, and these helped fund the construction of the castle. Brougham Castle was constructed in the northern part of the old Roman fort, and stone from the ruins was probably used to help build the castle. When Robert de Vieuxpont died in 1228, his only son&nbsp;&ndash; John&nbsp;&ndash; was a minor, so his property was taken into the care of a warden.<ref name=\"STH 10\">{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=10.}}</ref>\n\nJohn de Vieuxpont died in 1241,<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|2004}}</ref> before he came of age. The new heir, John's son Robert, was not old enough to inherit, so the family's lands remained in [[wardship]]. During this time, the estates fell into disrepair, and this probably included Brougham Castle. When Robert de Vieuxpont came of age in around 1257 he inherited considerable debts. He was one of the northern lords that revolted in support of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] in the [[Second Barons' War]] (1264\u20131267). By June 1264, Vieuxpont was dead; as he was considered a traitor, his property was confiscated by King [[Henry III of England|Henry&nbsp;III]]. In 1266, the king pardoned Vieuxpont posthumously, and his two daughters inherited the family estates. The guardians of the two girls, who at the time were too young to marry, divided the Vieuxpont lands with the expectation that they would come into their possession through marriage. Isabel Vieuxpont was given in marriage to Roger Clifford, the son of her guardian, and with her the [[shrievalty]] of Westmorland and the castles of Brougham and Appleby transferred to the Cliffords.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=10\u201312.}}</ref>\n\n==The Clifford family==\n{{See also|Baron de Clifford}}\n[[File:East aspect of Brougham Castle.jpg|thumb|300px|The east of Brougham Castle.

In 1283, Roger predeceased his wife, who died in 1292. At 18, their son Robert was not old enough to take possession of his lands. During his three-year minority, his estates suffered from neglect and [[poaching]].<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=12.}}</ref> When the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] began in 1296, Robert Clifford played a prominent role in the conflict. As the furthest north of his castles, Brougham became Clifford's most important base, and he spent a lot of time there. It was during this period that Clifford undertook an extensive building programme. The timber palisade surrounding the site was replaced with a stone [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]]. A four-storey stone residential tower, called the Tower of League, was built in the castle's south-west corner. A fourth storey was added to the keep, and a double gatehouse attached to its northern side. The construction of a new stone hall to the south of the keep may indicate that during the war there was a larger garrison present than in peacetime, or it may have been built in anticipation of a royal visit.<ref name=\"STH 13\">{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=13.}}</ref> In July 1300, [[Edward I of England|Edward&nbsp;I]]&nbsp;\u2013 himself a renowned castle builder<ref>{{Harvnb|Cathcart King|1988|p=107.}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 visited Brougham with a large household of followers and the [[Edward II of England|Prince of Wales]]. Although it is not certain whether the king stayed at the castle, historians believe it to have been likely.<ref name=\"STH 13\"/> In 1309, Robert Clifford was granted a [[licence to crenellate]] Brougham Castle; this has been taken as an indication that by this point the rebuilding was complete.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=14.}}</ref> Licences to crenellate granted permission for a person to fortify a site. They were also proof of a relationship with or favour from the monarch, who was the one responsible for granting permission.<ref>{{harvnb|Liddiard|2005|pp=43\u201344.}}</ref>\n\nEdward&nbsp;I died in 1307, and his successor [[Edward II of England|Edward&nbsp;II]] was distracted from war with Scotland by internal quarrels, enabling the Scottish to roam further south through England. In 1310 or 1311, Robert Clifford was given Skipton Castle; it was farther from the border than Brougham and at a time when Scottish raids were ravaging Westmorland, Clifford chose to spend more time and effort building at Skipton. Clifford was killed at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314,<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=14\u201315.}}</ref> which ended the English counter-offensive into Scotland.<ref>{{harvnb|Reese|2003|p=174.}}</ref> At the time of Robert's death, his son Roger de Clifford, 2nd Baron de Clifford, was only 14 and not old enough to inherit. Therefore, the Clifford estates experienced another period of control through guardians, suffering from Scottish raids to such an extent that in 1317 the king granted Roger \u00a3200 towards the maintenance of his castles. [[Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere]] was responsible for the upkeep of Brougham Castle and some other Clifford properties including Appleby Castle. Between 1316 and 1318 he spent \u00a3363 on the garrisons at Brougham and Appleby, though was supported by the king who gave \u00a31,270 towards their upkeep.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=15.}}</ref> Funds to pay the garrison were not easily gathered from the Clifford estates, and they were accused of poaching and pillaging. In 1320, Roger Clifford was given his inheritance but probably spent more time at Skipton. He was executed as a traitor in 1322 after his capture at the [[Battle of Boroughbridge]]. Brougham Castle was amongst the Clifford lands confiscated and given to [[Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle|Andrew de Harcla]] for supporting the king against the uprising. However, by 1323 Harcla too had been executed for treason and the castle came into the possession of Edward&nbsp;II. In May 1323, a truce was signed between the Scots and English resulting in a reduction in garrison strength throughout northern England.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=16.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Brougham plan.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Plan of Brougham Castle]]\nWhen [[Edward III of England|Edward&nbsp;III]] replaced Edward&nbsp;II on the throne, [[Robert de Clifford, 3rd Baron de Clifford|Robert Clifford]], Roger's younger brother, was granted most of the lands that had been confiscated. By 1333, Robert had united under his control all the estates which had belonged to the Vieuxpont family. Hostilities between England and Scotland resumed in 1332 when [[Edward Balliol]] invaded to seize the Scottish throne for himself. He was expelled from Scotland in December 1333. On entering Westmorland, Balliol sought refuge with the Clifford family, staying at the castles of Appleby, Brougham, Brough, and [[Pendragon Castle|Pendragon]]. Robert Clifford was not heavily involved in the renewed conflict, although he did take part in battles in 1332, 1337, and 1342. When the value of his property was assessed on his death in 1344 the estates of Brougham were suffering from the war, with indications that Brougham Castle was in a state of disrepair having endured the 1340s without funds for maintenance. Two minorities followed until [[Roger de Clifford, 5th Baron de Clifford|Roger Clifford, 5th Baron Clifford]], came of age in 1354.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=17\u201318.}}</ref> Another truce between Scotland and England was signed in 1357, this time lasting until 1384. Although Roger Clifford spent much time at Appleby&nbsp;\u2013 which was Westmorland's [[county town]]&nbsp;\u2013 he was responsible for rebuilding the domestic buildings at Brougham Castle, including the hall. He was ordered by the king to maintain a force of 40&nbsp;[[man-at-arms|men-at-arms]] and 50&nbsp;mounted archers near the west end of the Scottish border region, and some were likely stationed at Brougham. The need for extra accommodation is a possible reason why Clifford began rebuilding. In August 1388, the Scottish launched an attack into England, with one force advancing east&nbsp;\u2013 and were eventually confronted at the [[Battle of Otterburn]] in [[Northumberland]]&nbsp;\u2013 and another raiding the west, reaching as far as Brough, {{convert|20|mi}} to the south-east. During this time Brougham Castle was briefly captured by Scottish forces.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=21\u201323.}}</ref>\n\nRoger Clifford died at Skipton Castle in 1389, and the Clifford family began to lose interest in Westmorland. The Cliffords preferred their properties in Yorkshire to their dilapidated castles in Westmorland, which had been ravaged by wars with Scotland.<ref name=\"STH 23\">{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=23.}}</ref> Brougham Castle is not known to have been in use as a residence again until 1421, when a man was accused of forging coins in the castle.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|1999|p=5.}}</ref> Although little is known about Brougham during this period, historians believe it likely that repairs were undertaken, and a rivalry emerged between the Clifford family and the [[House of Neville]] that would later have consequences for Brougham.<ref name=\"STH 23\"/> The familial enmity meant that the [[Earl of Salisbury]], a Neville, used his position as lord of Penrith to antagonise the Cliffords; it is likely that Brougham Castle was kept garrisoned due to its proximity to Penrith. In the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455\u20131485), the two families were on opposing sides, the Cliffords supporting the [[House of Lancaster]] and the Nevilles supporting the [[House of York]].<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=26\u201327.}}</ref> When the Yorkist [[Edward IV of England|Edward&nbsp;IV]] took the throne in 1461 the lands of [[John Clifford, 9th Baron de Clifford]] were confiscated. In 1471, Edward&nbsp;IV granted Sir [[William Parr, 1st Baron Parr of Kendal|William Parr]] Brougham Castle and other properties which had belonged to the Cliffords. A year later [[Henry Clifford, 10th Baron de Clifford|Henry Clifford]], John's son and heir, was pardoned and when the Lancastrian [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] took the throne as Henry&nbsp;VII, Henry Clifford appealed for the return of the Clifford estates. This was granted in November 1485.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=28\u201329.}}</ref>\n\nHenry Clifford lived until 1523. Under him and his son&nbsp;\u2013 also called [[Henry Clifford, 1st Earl of Cumberland|Henry]], who later became [[Earl of Cumberland]]&nbsp;\u2013 the castle was intermittently in use as a residence for the family. After Brough Castle was destroyed in a fire in 1521 it is likely that Brougham became the new administrative centre and focus of the local lordship. As Earl of Cumberland Henry controlled Penrith and Carlisle, although he was an unpopular landlord. When the north of England rose up in the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]] in 1536, Henry was one of those targeted by the rebels. He confronted the rebel leaders at [[Kirkby Stephen]] in February 1537, and after his defeat he retreated to Brougham Castle. After the Pilgrimage of Grace was suppressed, there were reforms of regional government in the north west. One of the results was that the title of Earl of Cumberland no longer gave Clifford wardenship of Penrith and Carlisle, with Brougham Castle once again becoming the Cliffords' northern-most castle.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=30\u201332.}}</ref>\n\nHenry died in 1542 and his son, [[Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland]], inherited the family estates. During the [[Rising of the North]], in which Catholic [[magnate]]s rebelled against [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth&nbsp;I]], Henry remained loyal to the Tudor dynasty despite the Cliffords being a Catholic family. He dismantled Appleby Castle to prevent it from being used against royal forces, and at the same time put Brougham at the service of the Elizabethan government, although there was no fighting at the castle. Under the second and third earls, Henry and [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland|George]], the castle was still used as a residence, with the third earl being born at Brougham Castle. However, it was under George that the building began to decay and by 1592 it was deserted. George Clifford spent much time either in southern England in his role as [[Queen's Champion]] or at Skipton.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=32\u201334.}}</ref> An inventory of the castle's contents in 1595 demonstrates that the structure was a neglected, meagrely furnished place, and what little furniture there was old and in disrepair.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|1999|p=6.}}</ref>\n\n==The Clifford Dowagers==\n[[File:Clifford Family.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A portrait of the [[Lady Anne Clifford]]'s family; she is shown in the left and right panels, aged 15 and 56 respectively.

Margaret contended with claims to the ownership of the family estates from her brother-in-law [[Francis Clifford, 4th Earl of Cumberland]], but held onto Brougham Castle. Her daughter, [[Lady Anne Clifford]] continued the restoration of the castle and other Clifford properties. The only one of Margaret's three children to survive childhood, Anne inherited the Clifford estates after her mother died in 1616.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=40\u201343.}}</ref> The inheritance was not without incident. The Earl of Cumberland again asserted his claim to the Clifford estates, however the [[privy council]] found in favour of Anne.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=43\u201344.}}</ref> The solution was only temporary, and in April 1617 the king decided that the Earl of Cumberland was the rightful heir, and the Clifford estates passed to Francis Clifford. Later the same year, [[James I of England|James&nbsp;I]] visited Scotland and on his return journey he stayed at the castles of Carlisle, Brougham, and Appleby, where expensive banquets were given in his honour.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=46\u201347.}}</ref> It is estimated that the festivities cost around \u00a31,200. After this, Brougham was almost forgotten by its owner and neglected.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=49.}}</ref>\n\nFrancis Clifford died in 1641, and the death of his son [[Henry Clifford, 5th Earl of Cumberland]] in 1643 left the line without a direct male heir. At this point, the Clifford estates reverted to Lady Anne. The [[English Civil War]] broke out in 1641. Brougham was one of several castles in the generally Royalist Cumberland and Westmorland that were garrisoned by [[Cavalier]] forces. [[Sir John Lowther, 1st Baronet, of Lowther|Sir John Lowther]], the garrison commander, stated that he took control of Brougham Castle not because it was strategically important, but to deny the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] of its use. Whilst under Royalist control, Lady Anne donated the income from her estates to the upkeep of her castles. In June 1648, Appleby endured a four-day siege before capitulating to the Parliamentarians, but lightly manned Brougham Castle succumbed easily to Colonel [[John Lambert (general)|John Lambert]]. Although many castles in Cumberland and Westmorland were [[slighting|dismantled]] so they could not be used again, Brougham was spared this fate, most likely because it was not strategically important. In 1650, Lady Anne Clifford began repairing Appleby and Brougham. Repairs were mostly complete by 1653, but continued for several years afterwards, the work costing an estimated \u00a340,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=50\u201354.}}</ref> By this time Brougham Castle was no longer a serious fortification and had become Anne's country house.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=54.}}</ref> She laid out a garden on the site of the old Roman fort, which led to the discovery of such Roman artefacts as coins and three altars.

The complex has three components: the inner and outer gatehouses and a courtyard in between. The inner gatehouse survives to a height of {{convert|12.5|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} in the east. The ground-floor passage through the building is [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] and there was a [[portcullis]] at the east end. A [[postern gate]] was hidden behind a buttress in the north side of the gatehouse and would have provided a discrete means of leaving the castle. The floors above the passageway each consisted of a single large room and were connected to the keep, allowing people to move between the two without having to go outside. In the 17th century Lady Anne Clifford converted the top floor into her bedroom.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=13, 108\u2013109.}}</ref> Like the inner gatehouse, the outer section had a square plan, and the upper floors would each have been occupied by a single room. The building survives to a height of {{convert|14.5|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} in the east. Below the outer gatehouse was a dungeon, and at ground floor level on the north side the guardroom. The large rooms in both gatehouses would have been used as residences.

Access to each floor was granted by a spiral staircase in the north-east corner, with each floor consisting of a single large room. The [[garderobe]] was located in the north-west corner. It had long been assumed that the keep was built in the last quarter of the 12th century due to its simple design; the square design, use of narrow buttresses at each corner, and entrance through a forebuilding are consistent with other keeps built in the late 12th century. By the 13th century, Brougham's keep would have been old fashioned compared to the polygonal structures introduced in the 13th century.<ref name=\"STM 89-98\"/> However, historian Henry Summerson who assessed the historic documents for the castle concluded that construction could not have begun earlier than the first quarter of the 13th century.<ref name=\"STH 10\"/> The wooden floors no longer survive, and the use of the rooms in the keep is mostly conjectural, but it is likely that the ground floor would have served as a storage room, with the first-floor being used as a hall and accommodation for the guards, and the second floor providing rooms for the lord.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|1999|pp=16\u201317.}}</ref> A final fourth storey was added in early 14th century.<ref name=\"STH 13\"/> The keep would have been entered at first-floor level, through the east side where it was abutted by a forebuilding. Despite the keep's importance to the castle structure, little survives of the building today.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=106.}}</ref>\n\nSouth east of the keep was the hall, built by Roger Clifford in the late 14th century as a replacement for an earlier hall. It provided space for the castle's garrison, swelled by the Anglo-Scottish Wars, and was a location for the lord to eat with his soldiers. The hall had large windows which may have detracted from the building's defensive capability, although it has been postulated that casements bore large wooden shutters.

The [[castle]] was founded by [[Robert de Vieuxpont|Robert I de Vieuxpont]] in the early 13th century. The site, near the confluence of the rivers, [[River Eamont|Eamont]] and [[River Lowther|Lowther]], had been chosen by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]] for a [[Roman fort]] called [[Brocavum]]. The castle is scheduled as an [[Ancient Monument]], along with the fort, as \"Brougham Roman fort and Brougham Castle\".<ref name=\"EH\">{{NHLE | num=1007186 | desc= | accessdate=14 October 2013|mode=cs2}}</ref>\n\nIn its earliest form, the castle consisted of a stone [[keep]], with an [[Motte-and-bailey castle|enclosure protected by an earthen bank]] and a wooden [[palisade]]. When the castle was built, Robert de Vieuxpont was one of the only [[History of the British peerage#Feudal origins|lords]] in the region who were loyal to [[John, King of England|King John]]. The Vieuxponts were a powerful land-owning family in [[North West England]], who also owned the castles of [[Appleby Castle|Appleby]] and [[Brough Castle|Brough]]. In 1264, Robert de Vieuxpont's grandson, also named Robert, was declared a traitor, and his property was confiscated by [[Henry III of England|Henry&nbsp;III]]. Brougham Castle and the other estates were eventually returned to the Vieuxpont family, and stayed in their possession, until 1269, when the estates passed to the [[Baron de Clifford|Clifford family]] through marriage.\n\nWith the outbreak of the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]], in 1296, Brougham became an important military base for [[Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford|Robert Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford]]. He began refortifying the castle: the wooden outer defences were replaced with stronger, more impressive stone walls, and a large stone gatehouse was added. The importance of Brougham and Robert Clifford was such that, in 1300, he hosted King [[Edward I of England]] at the castle. Robert's son, [[Roger de Clifford, 2nd Baron de Clifford|Roger Clifford]], was executed as a traitor, in 1322, and the family estates passed into the possession of King [[Edward II of England]], although they were returned once his son [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] became king. The region was often at risk from the [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scots]], and in 1388, the castle was captured and sacked.\n\nFollowing this, the Cliffords began spending more time at their other castles, particularly [[Skipton Castle]] in [[Yorkshire]]. Brougham descended through several generations of Cliffords, intermittently serving as a residence. However, by 1592, it was in a state of disrepair, as [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland]] was spending more time in southern England due to his role as [[Queen's Champion]]. The castle was briefly restored in the early 17th century, to such an extent, that King [[James VI and I|James I of England]] was entertained there in 1617.<ref>''HMC Downshire'', vol. 6 (London, 1995), p. 141.</ref> In 1643, [[Lady Anne Clifford]] inherited the estates, including the castles of Brougham, Appleby, and Brough, and set about restoring them. Brougham Castle was kept in good condition for a short time, after Lady Anne's death in 1676; however, [[Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet]], who had inherited the Clifford estates, sold the furnishings in 1714. The empty shell was left to decay, as it was too costly to maintain. As a ruin, Brougham Castle inspired a painting by [[J. M. W. Turner]], and was mentioned at the start of [[William Wordsworth]]'s poem ''[[The Prelude]]'', as well as becoming the subject of Wordsworth's ''Song at the Feast of Brougham Castle upon the Restoration of Lord Clifford, the Shepherd, to the Estates and Honours of his Ancestors''. The castle was left to the [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]], in the 1930s, and is today maintained by its successor, [[English Heritage]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:RiverEamontAtBroughamCastle(SimonLedingham)Jun2004.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Brougham Castle was built in the north part of a Roman fort, near the confluence of the River Eamont and River Lowther.]]\nThe site of Brougham Castle has been fortified since the Romans erected the [[castra|fort]] of ''[[Brocavum]]'' at the intersection of three [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman roads]]. With the rivers [[River Eamont|Eamont]] and [[River Lowther|Lowther]] flowing nearby and meeting to the west, the site had natural defences and the area was fertile and easy to cultivate. A [[Vicus (Rome)|civilian settlement]] grew around the fort. When [[Angles]] arrived in the area they named the place ''Brougham'', meaning \"the village by the fort\".<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=7\u20138.}}</ref> Between the end of Roman rule in the early 5th century and the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] in the late 11th century, Cumbria was a turbulent area. Although the site was a defendable position, there is no evidence that Brougham was refortified during this time. In 1092, [[William II of England|William&nbsp;II]] (also known as William Rufus) captured Cumbria south of the [[Solway Firth]] and established a new border far north of Brougham. The site at Brougham remained unfortified. [[Carlisle Castle]] secured the border, and castles at [[Appleby Castle|Appleby]] and [[Brough Castle|Brough]], both south east of Brougham, protected the line of communication from [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] to [[Yorkshire]].<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=8.}}</ref> In 1203, the [[Barony of Westmorland]]&nbsp;\u2013 containing Appleby, Brough, and Brougham&nbsp;\u2013 was granted to [[Vieuxpont#Robert de Vieuxpont|Robert de Vieuxpont]] by King [[John of England|John]]. A favourite of John's, Vieuxpont was one of only a few lords loyal to him in northern England, whose inhabitants became so discontented with the king's rule that they eventually rebelled. Around 1214, Vieuxpont asserted control over more land, including half the [[manorialism|manor]] of Brougham. It was in this atmosphere of unrest that Brougham Castle was founded.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=8\u20139.}}</ref>\n\n==Under the Vieuxponts==\nVieuxpont was one of only a few supporters of the king in northern England, and he most likely began construction of Brougham Castle as soon as he acquired the land. At this stage, the castle would have been enclosed by an earthen bank surmounted by a timber [[palisade]]. The first three storeys of the stone keep date from this period. It was entered through the first floor via a forebuilding. To the east of this was a stone structure which was probably a hall.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=9\u201310.}}</ref> Building in stone was an expensive and time-consuming process. No records tell us how much Brougham cost to construct, but there are records for other stone construction. For example, the late-12th-century stone keep<ref>{{PastScape|mnumber=309632 |mname=Peveril Castle |accessdate=2010-02-24|mode=cs2}}</ref> at [[Peveril Castle]] in [[Derbyshire]] would have cost around \u00a3200, although something on a much larger scale, such as the vast [[Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard]], cost an estimated \u00a315,000 to \u00a320,000 and took several years to complete.<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|1992|pp=41\u201342.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1216, when a Scottish army invaded the [[River Eden, Cumbria|Eden valley]] and [[Alan of Galloway]] occupied Westmorland, Brougham Castle played no part in the county's defence, probably because it was unfinished. Construction would have been suspended until Alan retreated in 1217. Vieuxpont received control over the king's revenues from Cumberland, and these helped fund the construction of the castle. Brougham Castle was constructed in the northern part of the old Roman fort, and stone from the ruins was probably used to help build the castle. When Robert de Vieuxpont died in 1228, his only son&nbsp;&ndash; John&nbsp;&ndash; was a minor, so his property was taken into the care of a warden.<ref name=\"STH 10\">{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=10.}}</ref>\n\nJohn de Vieuxpont died in 1241,<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|2004}}</ref> before he came of age. The new heir, John's son Robert, was not old enough to inherit, so the family's lands remained in [[wardship]]. During this time, the estates fell into disrepair, and this probably included Brougham Castle. When Robert de Vieuxpont came of age in around 1257 he inherited considerable debts. He was one of the northern lords that revolted in support of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]] in the [[Second Barons' War]] (1264\u20131267). By June 1264, Vieuxpont was dead; as he was considered a traitor, his property was confiscated by King [[Henry III of England|Henry&nbsp;III]]. In 1266, the king pardoned Vieuxpont posthumously, and his two daughters inherited the family estates. The guardians of the two girls, who at the time were too young to marry, divided the Vieuxpont lands with the expectation that they would come into their possession through marriage. Isabel Vieuxpont was given in marriage to Roger Clifford, the son of her guardian, and with her the [[shrievalty]] of Westmorland and the castles of Brougham and Appleby transferred to the Cliffords.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=10\u201312.}}</ref>\n\n==The Clifford family==\n{{See also|Baron de Clifford}}\n[[File:East aspect of Brougham Castle.jpg|thumb|300px|The east of Brougham Castle. The gatehouse (right) was built by Robert Clifford, as was the stone wall enclosing the castle. The keep next to the gatehouse is a survival from when Robert de Vieuxpont founded Brougham Castle.]]\nBy 1269, Roger Clifford had married Isabel Vieuxpont and possession of Brougham Castle&nbsp;\u2013 as well as her other property&nbsp;\u2013 descended through the Clifford family. In 1283, Roger predeceased his wife, who died in 1292. At 18, their son Robert was not old enough to take possession of his lands. During his three-year minority, his estates suffered from neglect and [[poaching]].<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=12.}}</ref> When the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] began in 1296, Robert Clifford played a prominent role in the conflict. As the furthest north of his castles, Brougham became Clifford's most important base, and he spent a lot of time there. It was during this period that Clifford undertook an extensive building programme. The timber palisade surrounding the site was replaced with a stone [[curtain wall (fortification)|curtain wall]]. A four-storey stone residential tower, called the Tower of League, was built in the castle's south-west corner. A fourth storey was added to the keep, and a double gatehouse attached to its northern side. The construction of a new stone hall to the south of the keep may indicate that during the war there was a larger garrison present than in peacetime, or it may have been built in anticipation of a royal visit.<ref name=\"STH 13\">{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=13.}}</ref> In July 1300, [[Edward I of England|Edward&nbsp;I]]&nbsp;\u2013 himself a renowned castle builder<ref>{{Harvnb|Cathcart King|1988|p=107.}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 visited Brougham with a large household of followers and the [[Edward II of England|Prince of Wales]]. Although it is not certain whether the king stayed at the castle, historians believe it to have been likely.<ref name=\"STH 13\"/> In 1309, Robert Clifford was granted a [[licence to crenellate]] Brougham Castle; this has been taken as an indication that by this point the rebuilding was complete.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=14.}}</ref> Licences to crenellate granted permission for a person to fortify a site. They were also proof of a relationship with or favour from the monarch, who was the one responsible for granting permission.<ref>{{harvnb|Liddiard|2005|pp=43\u201344.}}</ref>\n\nEdward&nbsp;I died in 1307, and his successor [[Edward II of England|Edward&nbsp;II]] was distracted from war with Scotland by internal quarrels, enabling the Scottish to roam further south through England. In 1310 or 1311, Robert Clifford was given Skipton Castle; it was farther from the border than Brougham and at a time when Scottish raids were ravaging Westmorland, Clifford chose to spend more time and effort building at Skipton. Clifford was killed at the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] in 1314,<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=14\u201315.}}</ref> which ended the English counter-offensive into Scotland.<ref>{{harvnb|Reese|2003|p=174.}}</ref> At the time of Robert's death, his son Roger de Clifford, 2nd Baron de Clifford, was only 14 and not old enough to inherit. Therefore, the Clifford estates experienced another period of control through guardians, suffering from Scottish raids to such an extent that in 1317 the king granted Roger \u00a3200 towards the maintenance of his castles. [[Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere]] was responsible for the upkeep of Brougham Castle and some other Clifford properties including Appleby Castle. Between 1316 and 1318 he spent \u00a3363 on the garrisons at Brougham and Appleby, though was supported by the king who gave \u00a31,270 towards their upkeep.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=15.}}</ref> Funds to pay the garrison were not easily gathered from the Clifford estates, and they were accused of poaching and pillaging. In 1320, Roger Clifford was given his inheritance but probably spent more time at Skipton. He was executed as a traitor in 1322 after his capture at the [[Battle of Boroughbridge]]. Brougham Castle was amongst the Clifford lands confiscated and given to [[Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle|Andrew de Harcla]] for supporting the king against the uprising. However, by 1323 Harcla too had been executed for treason and the castle came into the possession of Edward&nbsp;II. In May 1323, a truce was signed between the Scots and English resulting in a reduction in garrison strength throughout northern England.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=16.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Brougham plan.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Plan of Brougham Castle]]\nWhen [[Edward III of England|Edward&nbsp;III]] replaced Edward&nbsp;II on the throne, [[Robert de Clifford, 3rd Baron de Clifford|Robert Clifford]], Roger's younger brother, was granted most of the lands that had been confiscated. By 1333, Robert had united under his control all the estates which had belonged to the Vieuxpont family. Hostilities between England and Scotland resumed in 1332 when [[Edward Balliol]] invaded to seize the Scottish throne for himself. He was expelled from Scotland in December 1333. On entering Westmorland, Balliol sought refuge with the Clifford family, staying at the castles of Appleby, Brougham, Brough, and [[Pendragon Castle|Pendragon]]. Robert Clifford was not heavily involved in the renewed conflict, although he did take part in battles in 1332, 1337, and 1342. When the value of his property was assessed on his death in 1344 the estates of Brougham were suffering from the war, with indications that Brougham Castle was in a state of disrepair having endured the 1340s without funds for maintenance. Two minorities followed until [[Roger de Clifford, 5th Baron de Clifford|Roger Clifford, 5th Baron Clifford]], came of age in 1354.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=17\u201318.}}</ref> Another truce between Scotland and England was signed in 1357, this time lasting until 1384. Although Roger Clifford spent much time at Appleby&nbsp;\u2013 which was Westmorland's [[county town]]&nbsp;\u2013 he was responsible for rebuilding the domestic buildings at Brougham Castle, including the hall. He was ordered by the king to maintain a force of 40&nbsp;[[man-at-arms|men-at-arms]] and 50&nbsp;mounted archers near the west end of the Scottish border region, and some were likely stationed at Brougham. The need for extra accommodation is a possible reason why Clifford began rebuilding. In August 1388, the Scottish launched an attack into England, with one force advancing east&nbsp;\u2013 and were eventually confronted at the [[Battle of Otterburn]] in [[Northumberland]]&nbsp;\u2013 and another raiding the west, reaching as far as Brough, {{convert|20|mi}} to the south-east. During this time Brougham Castle was briefly captured by Scottish forces.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=21\u201323.}}</ref>\n\nRoger Clifford died at Skipton Castle in 1389, and the Clifford family began to lose interest in Westmorland. The Cliffords preferred their properties in Yorkshire to their dilapidated castles in Westmorland, which had been ravaged by wars with Scotland.<ref name=\"STH 23\">{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=23.}}</ref> Brougham Castle is not known to have been in use as a residence again until 1421, when a man was accused of forging coins in the castle.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|1999|p=5.}}</ref> Although little is known about Brougham during this period, historians believe it likely that repairs were undertaken, and a rivalry emerged between the Clifford family and the [[House of Neville]] that would later have consequences for Brougham.<ref name=\"STH 23\"/> The familial enmity meant that the [[Earl of Salisbury]], a Neville, used his position as lord of Penrith to antagonise the Cliffords; it is likely that Brougham Castle was kept garrisoned due to its proximity to Penrith. In the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455\u20131485), the two families were on opposing sides, the Cliffords supporting the [[House of Lancaster]] and the Nevilles supporting the [[House of York]].<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=26\u201327.}}</ref> When the Yorkist [[Edward IV of England|Edward&nbsp;IV]] took the throne in 1461 the lands of [[John Clifford, 9th Baron de Clifford]] were confiscated. In 1471, Edward&nbsp;IV granted Sir [[William Parr, 1st Baron Parr of Kendal|William Parr]] Brougham Castle and other properties which had belonged to the Cliffords. A year later [[Henry Clifford, 10th Baron de Clifford|Henry Clifford]], John's son and heir, was pardoned and when the Lancastrian [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] took the throne as Henry&nbsp;VII, Henry Clifford appealed for the return of the Clifford estates. This was granted in November 1485.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=28\u201329.}}</ref>\n\nHenry Clifford lived until 1523. Under him and his son&nbsp;\u2013 also called [[Henry Clifford, 1st Earl of Cumberland|Henry]], who later became [[Earl of Cumberland]]&nbsp;\u2013 the castle was intermittently in use as a residence for the family. After Brough Castle was destroyed in a fire in 1521 it is likely that Brougham became the new administrative centre and focus of the local lordship. As Earl of Cumberland Henry controlled Penrith and Carlisle, although he was an unpopular landlord. When the north of England rose up in the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]] in 1536, Henry was one of those targeted by the rebels. He confronted the rebel leaders at [[Kirkby Stephen]] in February 1537, and after his defeat he retreated to Brougham Castle. After the Pilgrimage of Grace was suppressed, there were reforms of regional government in the north west. One of the results was that the title of Earl of Cumberland no longer gave Clifford wardenship of Penrith and Carlisle, with Brougham Castle once again becoming the Cliffords' northern-most castle.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=30\u201332.}}</ref>\n\nHenry died in 1542 and his son, [[Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland]], inherited the family estates. During the [[Rising of the North]], in which Catholic [[magnate]]s rebelled against [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth&nbsp;I]], Henry remained loyal to the Tudor dynasty despite the Cliffords being a Catholic family. He dismantled Appleby Castle to prevent it from being used against royal forces, and at the same time put Brougham at the service of the Elizabethan government, although there was no fighting at the castle. Under the second and third earls, Henry and [[George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland|George]], the castle was still used as a residence, with the third earl being born at Brougham Castle. However, it was under George that the building began to decay and by 1592 it was deserted.

Margaret contended with claims to the ownership of the family estates from her brother-in-law [[Francis Clifford, 4th Earl of Cumberland]], but held onto Brougham Castle. Her daughter, [[Lady Anne Clifford]] continued the restoration of the castle and other Clifford properties. The only one of Margaret's three children to survive childhood, Anne inherited the Clifford estates after her mother died in 1616.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=40\u201343.}}</ref> The inheritance was not without incident. The Earl of Cumberland again asserted his claim to the Clifford estates, however the [[privy council]] found in favour of Anne.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=43\u201344.}}</ref> The solution was only temporary, and in April 1617 the king decided that the Earl of Cumberland was the rightful heir, and the Clifford estates passed to Francis Clifford. Later the same year, [[James I of England|James&nbsp;I]] visited Scotland and on his return journey he stayed at the castles of Carlisle, Brougham, and Appleby, where expensive banquets were given in his honour.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=46\u201347.}}</ref> It is estimated that the festivities cost around \u00a31,200. After this, Brougham was almost forgotten by its owner and neglected.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=49.}}</ref>\n\nFrancis Clifford died in 1641, and the death of his son [[Henry Clifford, 5th Earl of Cumberland]] in 1643 left the line without a direct male heir. At this point, the Clifford estates reverted to Lady Anne. The [[English Civil War]] broke out in 1641. Brougham was one of several castles in the generally Royalist Cumberland and Westmorland that were garrisoned by [[Cavalier]] forces. [[Sir John Lowther, 1st Baronet, of Lowther|Sir John Lowther]], the garrison commander, stated that he took control of Brougham Castle not because it was strategically important, but to deny the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] of its use. Whilst under Royalist control, Lady Anne donated the income from her estates to the upkeep of her castles. In June 1648, Appleby endured a four-day siege before capitulating to the Parliamentarians, but lightly manned Brougham Castle succumbed easily to Colonel [[John Lambert (general)|John Lambert]]. Although many castles in Cumberland and Westmorland were [[slighting|dismantled]] so they could not be used again, Brougham was spared this fate, most likely because it was not strategically important. In 1650, Lady Anne Clifford began repairing Appleby and Brougham. Repairs were mostly complete by 1653, but continued for several years afterwards, the work costing an estimated \u00a340,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=50\u201354.}}</ref> By this time Brougham Castle was no longer a serious fortification and had become Anne's country house.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=54.}}</ref> She laid out a garden on the site of the old Roman fort, which led to the discovery of such Roman artefacts as coins and three altars. A {{convert|10.5|ft|adj=on}} stone wall was built around the garden, enclosing an area from the gatehouse to the south end of the Roman fort.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=58.}}</ref>\n\n==Picturesque ruin==\n[[File:Brougham Castle mezzotint, J.

He died in 1679, and over the next five years possession passed through his three younger brothers. Under the youngest, [[Thomas Tufton, 6th Earl of Thanet]], Brougham Castle suffered particular neglect.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=65.}}</ref> In 1714, he decided that [[Appleby Castle]] was a sufficient residence and sold the contents of Brougham Castle for \u00a3570.

To the south, or the left of someone approaching the castle, are the earthworks of the Roman fort and the location of the 17th-century garden. The ground is terraced, and to the north the land slopes down towards the River Eamont.<ref>{{harvnb|Johnson|2002|p=48.}}</ref> A moat runs alongside the east, south, and west faces of the castle, its width varying between {{convert|10|and|15|m|order=flip}} and lying up to {{convert|3.4|m|order=flip}} deep. Although the moat is now dry it is likely that it used to be filled with water.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=80\u201381.}}</ref> The castle is an irregular polygon, measuring about {{convert|68|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} along the west side, {{convert|72|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} along the south, {{convert|48|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} wide in the east, and {{convert|54|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} on the north side.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=81.}}</ref>\n\nBrougham Castle is entered through a three-storey double-gatehouse.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|1999|pp=9\u201310.}}</ref> Originally the coat of arms of Roger Clifford and his wife was carved above the entrance to the gatehouse but in the 19th century this was replaced by the current inscription, \"Thys Made Roger\", by Henry Tufton, 11th Earl of Thanet. The inscription was originally above the entrance of the great hall built by Roger Clifford, 5th Baron Clifford.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=21, 71.}}</ref> Erected on the slope inclining down to the river, the gatehouse was constructed in the early 14th century by Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford. The complex has three components: the inner and outer gatehouses and a courtyard in between. The inner gatehouse survives to a height of {{convert|12.5|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} in the east. The ground-floor passage through the building is [[Vault (architecture)|vaulted]] and there was a [[portcullis]] at the east end. A [[postern gate]] was hidden behind a buttress in the north side of the gatehouse and would have provided a discrete means of leaving the castle. The floors above the passageway each consisted of a single large room and were connected to the keep, allowing people to move between the two without having to go outside. In the 17th century Lady Anne Clifford converted the top floor into her bedroom.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=13, 108\u2013109.}}</ref> Like the inner gatehouse, the outer section had a square plan, and the upper floors would each have been occupied by a single room. The building survives to a height of {{convert|14.5|m|order=flip|abbr=on}} in the east. Below the outer gatehouse was a dungeon, and at ground floor level on the north side the guardroom. The large rooms in both gatehouses would have been used as residences. Although the very top of the gatehouse no longer survives, it would have been crested by [[machicolation]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|pp=109\u2013111.}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Outer wall and keep at Brougham Castle.jpg|thumb|left|The outer wall of Brougham Castle.

Access to each floor was granted by a spiral staircase in the north-east corner, with each floor consisting of a single large room. The [[garderobe]] was located in the north-west corner. It had long been assumed that the keep was built in the last quarter of the 12th century due to its simple design; the square design, use of narrow buttresses at each corner, and entrance through a forebuilding are consistent with other keeps built in the late 12th century. By the 13th century, Brougham's keep would have been old fashioned compared to the polygonal structures introduced in the 13th century.<ref name=\"STM 89-98\"/> However, historian Henry Summerson who assessed the historic documents for the castle concluded that construction could not have begun earlier than the first quarter of the 13th century.<ref name=\"STH 10\"/> The wooden floors no longer survive, and the use of the rooms in the keep is mostly conjectural, but it is likely that the ground floor would have served as a storage room, with the first-floor being used as a hall and accommodation for the guards, and the second floor providing rooms for the lord.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|1999|pp=16\u201317.}}</ref> A final fourth storey was added in early 14th century.<ref name=\"STH 13\"/> The keep would have been entered at first-floor level, through the east side where it was abutted by a forebuilding. Despite the keep's importance to the castle structure, little survives of the building today.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|Trueman|Harrison|1998|p=106.}}</ref>\n\nSouth east of the keep was the hall, built by Roger Clifford in the late 14th century as a replacement for an earlier hall. It provided space for the castle's garrison, swelled by the Anglo-Scottish Wars, and was a location for the lord to eat with his soldiers. The hall had large windows which may have detracted from the building's defensive capability, although it has been postulated that casements bore large wooden shutters. The kitchen, which served the entire castle, was set in the south-east corner of the fortification.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|1999|pp=14\u201315.}}</ref> Along the south wall were arranged more lodgings, a well, and a chapel, the latter another addition by Roger Clifford.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|1999|p=13.}}</ref> In the south-west corner of the castle was the Tower of League, built around 1300 by Roger Clifford. It included further rooms for accommodation, but notably would also have allowed defenders to fire on an enemy emerging from the gatehouse. Four storeys tall and with a single room at each level, the presence of a garderobe and fireplace on each floor suggests that the tower was reserved for high-status visitors.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|1999|p=12.}}</ref> The tower's square plan is typical of such structures built in northern England at this time, as seen at castles such as [[Warkworth Castle|Warkworth]] and [[Egremont Castle|Egremont]], although it contrasts with rounded towers preferred in the south.<ref>{{harvnb|Cathcart King|1988|p=153.}}</ref>\n\n==Folklore==\nThe antiquary [[William Stukeley]] visited Brougham Castle in 1725 and recorded local beliefs<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Black's Picturesque Guide to the English Lakes |url=https://archive.org/details/blackspicturesq05firgoog |quote=1725 when Dr Stukeley.|edition=5th |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Adam and Charles Black |page=[https://archive.org/details/blackspicturesq05firgoog/page/n172 112] |date=1850 |access-date=21 May 2018 }}</ref> about certain \"monuments of stone\" south of Brougham Castle:\n\n<blockquote>They are generally by the country people said to be done by [[Michael Scot]], a noted conjuror in their opinion, who was a monk of [[Holmcultram Abbey|Holme abbey]] in Cumberland: they have a notion too that one Turquin, a giant, lived at Brougham castle; and there is a tower there, called Pagan tower; and Sir [[Lancelot]] de Lake lived at [[Mayburgh Henge|Mayborough]], and slew him.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stukeley |first1=William |year=1776 |title=Itinerarium Curiosum: or, an Account of the Antiquities, and Remarkable Curiosities in Nature or Art, Observed in Travels Through Great Britain |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_HphaAAAAYAAJ |quote=one Turquin a giant. |location=London |publisher=Baker and Leigh |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_HphaAAAAYAAJ/page/n104 45] |access-date=21 May 2018 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nTurquin, or Tarquin, is also associated in folklore with the ruins of [[Wharton, Cumbria|Lammerside Castle]] nearby.
