One major prospective study of 10,745 adult patients undergoing emergency laparotomy from 357 centres in 58 high-, middle-, and low-income countries found that mortality is three times higher in low- compared with high-[[Human Development Index|HDI]] countries even when adjusted for prognostic factors.<ref name=GlobalSurg2016>{{cite journal | title = Mortality of emergency abdominal surgery in high-, middle- and low-income countries | journal = The British Journal of Surgery | volume = 103 | issue = 8 | pages = 971\u2013988 | date = July 2016 | pmid = 27145169 | doi = 10.1002/bjs.10151 | hdl = 20.500.11820/7c4589f5-7845-4405-a384-dfb5653e2163 | author1 = GlobalSurg Collaborative | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/c3bb8b4d9a211da6a5a75cebf6c4b0006c4830cc }}</ref> In this study the overall global mortality rate was 1.6 percent at 24\u2009hours (high 1.1 percent, middle 1.9 percent, low 3.4 percent; P < 0.001), increasing to 5.4 percent by 30 days (high 4.5 percent, middle 6.0 percent, low 8.6 percent; P < 0.001). Of the 578 patients who died, 404 (69.9 percent) did so between 24\u2009h and 30 days following surgery (high 74.2 percent, middle 68.8 percent, low 60.5 percent). Patient safety factors were suggested to play an important role, with use of the [[WHO Surgical Safety Checklist]] associated with reduced mortality at 30 days.\n\nTaking a similar approach, a unique global study of 1,409 children undergoing emergency laparotomy from 253 centres in 43 countries showed that adjusted mortality in children following surgery may be as high as 7 times greater in low-HDI and middle-HDI countries compared with high-HDI countries, translating to 40 excess deaths per 1000 procedures performed in these settings. Internationally, the most common operations performed were appendectomy, small bowel resection, pyloromyotomy and correction of intussusception. After adjustment for patient and hospital risk factors, child mortality at 30 days was significantly higher in low-HDI (adjusted OR 7.14 (95% CI 2.52 to 20.23), p<0.001) and middle-HDI (4.42 (1.44 to 13.56), p=0.009) countries compared with high-HDI countries.<ref name=GlobalSurgPaeds2016>{{cite journal | title = Determinants of morbidity and mortality following emergency abdominal surgery in children in low-income and middle-income countries | journal = BMJ Global Health | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = e000091 | year = 2016 | pmid = 28588977 | pmc = 5321375 | doi = 10.1136/bmjgh-2016-000091 | author1 = GlobalSurg Collaborative }}</ref>\n\n== Related procedures ==\nA related procedure is [[laparoscopy]], where cameras and other instruments are inserted into the [[peritoneal cavity]] via small holes in the abdomen.
