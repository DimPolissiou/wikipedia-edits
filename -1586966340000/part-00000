Most political podcasts maintain a connection with an existing media source such as a newspaper or magazine. They aim to inform or entertain or advocate a cause, usually for progressive causes, although there are some conservative podcasts. They are often cost-effective to produce, requiring minimal computer technology to operate. Their audiences are generally persons in interested in current events, and programs usually have a duration of a half hour to an hour.\n\n==Background==\nWith increasing growth of the [[Internet]]  and new technologies and devices to disseminate information digitally such as [[laptop computers]] and [[smartphones]], political podcasts have become an \"emerging industry\" according to one view.<ref name=\"twsNieman1\"/> Most began as spinoffs of existing media.

Some podcasts focus on the horse-race aspects of elections, such as strategy and which candidate is doing well in the polls, while others focus on politics and issues. They typically feature reporters, politicians, academics, writers, pollsters, and others who have established credentials in the [[public sphere]]; for example, ''Start Making Sense'', hosted by historian [[Jon Wiener]], has featured discussions on [[Edward Snowden]], campaign strategy, inequality and class conflict, ''The Nation''{{'}}s yearlong investigation into abuses in the federally-run private prisons,<ref name=\"twsTheNation3\">{{cite magazine \n|author1=Start Making Sense  |author2=Jon Wiener\n| date= August 25, 2016\n| magazine= The Nation\n| url= https://www.thenation.com/article/why-wont-the-us-grant-edward-snowden-amnesty/\n| title=  Why Obama Should Pardon Edward Snowden: Seth Freed Wessler on the power of independent journalism, Amy Wilentz on Jared Kushner, and Ben Wizner on Edward Snowden\n| accessdate= September 22, 2016\n| quote=...

The WTF Podcast was broadcast from Marc Maron's garage in Los Angeles, California. The conversation between Maron and President Obama covered a range of subject, starting with the president's upbringing in Southern California and Hawaii then evolving into in a discussion about the main issues which the administration was dealing with at the time, gun laws, universal healthcare and the current political divide in America. The President cited the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], the deadest school shooting in U.S history, as an example of his frustrations with the current Senate at the time and their inability to act due to lobby groups like the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]], and the effects of the inaction on public opinion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2012/12/us/sandy-hook-timeline/index.html|title=Sandy Hook Elementary shooting: What happened?|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe President then continued to speak on the disconnect between the daily lives of average Americans and what is being shown in the U.S media and how the current political system does not create space for ordinary conversations about politics.<ref name=\":0\" />  Obama then spoke about disappointing his supporters on certain policy issues and how his administrations rectified some of the actions that they took, citing the difficulties about the implementations of public healthcare and national defence.<ref name=\":0\" />  The conversation then switched to racial relations in America, referring to the [[2015 Baltimore protests]] and the [[shooting of Michael Brown]] in Ferguson Missouri.

Most political podcasts maintain a connection with an existing media source such as a newspaper or magazine. They aim to inform or entertain or advocate a cause, usually for progressive causes, although there are some conservative podcasts. They are often cost-effective to produce, requiring minimal computer technology to operate. Their audiences are generally persons in interested in current events, and programs usually have a duration of a half hour to an hour.\n\n==Background==\nWith increasing growth of the [[Internet]]  and new technologies and devices to disseminate information digitally such as [[laptop computers]] and [[smartphones]], political podcasts have become an \"emerging industry\" according to one view.<ref name=\"twsNieman1\"/> Most began as spinoffs of existing media.

Some podcasts focus on the horse-race aspects of elections, such as strategy and which candidate is doing well in the polls, while others focus on politics and issues. They typically feature reporters, politicians, academics, writers, pollsters, and others who have established credentials in the [[public sphere]]; for example, ''Start Making Sense'', hosted by historian [[Jon Wiener]], has featured discussions on [[Edward Snowden]], campaign strategy, inequality and class conflict, ''The Nation's'' yearlong investigation into abuses in the federally-run private prisons,<ref name=\"twsTheNation3\">{{cite magazine \n|author1=Start Making Sense  |author2=Jon Wiener\n| date= August 25, 2016\n| magazine= The Nation\n| url= https://www.thenation.com/article/why-wont-the-us-grant-edward-snowden-amnesty/\n| title=  Why Obama Should Pardon Edward Snowden: Seth Freed Wessler on the power of independent journalism, Amy Wilentz on Jared Kushner, and Ben Wizner on Edward Snowden\n| accessdate= September 22, 2016\n| quote=...

The President cited the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], the deadest school shooting in U.S history, as an example of his frustrations with the current Senate at the time and their inability to act due to lobby groups like the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]], and the effects of the inaction on public opinion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2012/12/us/sandy-hook-timeline/index.html|title=Sandy Hook Elementary shooting: What happened?|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe President then continued to speak on the disconnect between the daily lives of average Americans and what is being shown in the U.S media and how the current political system does not create space for ordinary conversations about politics.<ref name=\":0\" />  Obama then spoke about disappointing his supporters on certain policy issues and how his administrations rectified some of the actions that they took, citing the difficulties about the implementations of public healthcare and national defence.<ref name=\":0\" />  The conversation then switched to racial relations in America, referring to the [[2015 Baltimore protests]] and the [[shooting of Michael Brown]] in Ferguson Missouri.
