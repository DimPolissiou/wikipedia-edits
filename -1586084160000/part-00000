Additionally, because of an increasing focus on power performance,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.cpubenchmark.net/power_performance.html | title=PassMark CPU TDP Chart - Performance / Power of available CPUs}}</ref> or [[performance per watt]], connecting old/inefficient computers to the grid will increase the total/average power required to complete the same calculations.\n\nThe [[BOINC]] client avoids slowing the computer by using a variety of limits that suspend computation when there are insufficient free resources. Unlike other BOINC projects, World Community Grid set the BOINC defaults conservatively, making the chances of computer damage extremely small. The default CPU throttle is 60%. The throttle is coarse-grained; for example, if usage is set to 60% it will work at 100% for 3 seconds, then at 0% for 2 seconds, resulting in an average decrease of processor use.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/help/viewTopic.do?shortName=cpuuse#33\n|title=CPU Usage: Why does my PC show high CPU use?\n|work=Help\n|publisher=World Community Grid\n|accessdate=2007-08-05\n}}</ref>\n\nAn add-on program for Windows computers \u2013 [http://efmer.eu/boinc/ TThrottle] \u2013 can solve the problem of overheating by directly limiting the BOINC project's use of the host computer. It does this by measuring the CPU and/or the GPU temperature and adjusts the run time accordingly. It also uses a shorter switching time of less than one second, resulting in less temperature change during switching.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Statistics and competition==\nThe contributions of each user are recorded and user contribution statistics are publicly available.<ref name=\"Global Statistics\"/> Due to the fact that the processing time of each workunit varies from computer to computer, depending on the difficulty of the workunit, the speed of the computer, and the amount of idle resources available, contributions are usually measured in terms of ''points''. Points are awarded for each workunit depending on the effort required to process it.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/help/viewTopic.do?shortName=points#27\n|title=Points: What are points?\n|work=Help\n|publisher=World Community Grid\n|accessdate=2007-07-28\n}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing a workunit, the [[BOINC]] client will request the number of points it thinks it deserves based on software [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]]s (''see [[BOINC Credit System#Cobblestones]]''). Since multiple computers process the same workunit to ensure accuracy, the World Community Grid servers can look at the points claimed by each of those computers. The WCG servers disregard statistical outliers, average the remaining values and award the resulting number of points to each computer.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/help/viewTopic.do?shortName=points#177\n|title=Points: How are points calculated for the BOINC agent?\n|work=Help\n|publisher=World Community Grid\n|accessdate=2007-08-05\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org/forums/wcg/viewthread?thread=9545\n|title=BOINC Points\n|author=knreed\n|publisher=World Community Grid\n|date=2006-11-02\n|accessdate=2007-07-28\n}}</ref>\n\nWithin the grid, users may join teams that have been created by organizations, groups, or individuals.

During fall, winter and spring, ''Coral Princess'' runs 11-day [[Panama Canal]] partial-transit cruises with stops in [[Cartagena, Colombia]], [[Colon, Panama]], either [[Ocho Rios, Jamaica]], or [[Grand Cayman]] (alternating cruises), [[Limon, Costa Rica]], and [[Oranjestad, Aruba]], with [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], as its turnaround port.\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\nOn May 2, 2013, ''Coral Princess'' suffered a fire when some flammable material in the engineering spaces accidentally ignited in the middle of the night.  It was quickly extinguished without anyone onboard being injured; however, minor amounts of smoke was detected by passengers as far up as Deck 8.\n\n''Coral Princess'' experienced an engine fire at approximately 2130 local time on 15 January 2020 while in the [[Drake Passage]] en route to [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], [[Falkland Islands]]. At the time of the fire, ''Coral Princess'' was {{convert|4|nmi}} north of [[Elephant Island]] in [[Antarctica]].

A news item on 2 April 2020 stated that \"Passengers have been confined to their rooms...when the company noticed a higher than normal number of flu-like cases on board\".  Reports then specified that that \"out of 13 passengers and crew tested for COVID-19 on board the Coral Princess, 12 were positive\". Officials in [[Broward County, Florida]] said that a plan was not yet in place to handle the situation. The ship had departed [[San Antonio, Chile]] on 5 March 2020, when the cruise line was still in full operation, and was not allowed to disembark passengers at [[Buenos Aires]] on 19 and 20 March.
