In 1952 Bentley became an informer for the U.S., as she was paid by the FBI for her frequent appearances before different committees and investigations. She exposed two networks of spies, ultimately naming more than 80 Americans who, she said, had engaged in espionage.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=100}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n  | authorlink1 = John Earl Haynes | last1 = Haynes | first1 = John Earl | authorlink2 = Harvey Klehr | last2 = Klehr | first2 = Harvey\n  | title = In Denial: Historians, Communism & Espionage\n  | publisher = Encounter Books  \n  | url = https://books.google.com/?id=YSpgAAAACAAJ&dq\n  | pages = 76, 77\n  | isbn = 1-59403-088-X\n  | date = 2005-10-25 \n}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n\nElizabeth Terrill<ref>Lauren Kessler's 2003 biography spells Bentley's middle name as 'Turrill'. {{Harvnb|Kessler|2003|p=14}}</ref> Bentley was born in [[New Milford, Connecticut]], to Charles Prentiss Bentley, a dry-goods merchant, and the former May Charlotte Turrill, a schoolteacher.<ref>{{cite news |title=Red Spy Tells Of Childhood In Connecticut Town |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/875370022.html?dids=875370022:875370022&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&date=Aug+04%2C+1948&author=&pub=The+Hartford+Courant&desc=Red+Spy+Tells+Of+Childhood+In+Connecticut+Town&pqatl=google |publisher=[[Associated Press]] in [[Hartford Courant]] |date=August 4, 1948 |accessdate=2008-05-29 }}</ref> In 1915 her parents had moved to [[Ithaca, New York]].

In 1935, she obtained a job at the Italian Library of Information in [[New York City]]; this was fascist Italy's propaganda bureau in the United States.

But Golos was one of the Soviet Union's most important intelligence agents in the United States. At the time when he and Bentley met, Golos was involved in planning the assassination of [[Leon Trotsky]], which would take place in [[Mexico]] in 1940.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=22}}</ref> Bentley and Golos soon became lovers. It was more than a year before she learned his true name, and, according to her later testimony, two years before she knew that he was working for Soviet intelligence.\n\nIn 1940, two years into their relationship, the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] forced Golos to register as an agent of the Soviet government under the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]]. This increased his risk in contacting the network of American spies he controlled, and accepting documents from them. He gradually transferred this responsibility to Bentley. Golos also needed someone to take charge of the day-to-day business of the United States Service and Shipping Corporation, a [[Comintern]] front organization for espionage activities.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kessler|2003|p=77}}</ref> Bentley took on this role as well. Although she was never directly paid for any of her espionage work, she would eventually earn $800 a month as vice president of U.S. Service and Shipping, a considerable salary for the time,<ref>{{Harvnb|Kessler|2003|p=150}}</ref> {{Inflation|US|800|1940|r=0|fmt=eq}}<!-- Based on 1940 dollars. --> (per month). As Bentley acquired an important role in Soviet intelligence, the Soviets gave her the code name ''Umnitsa'', loosely translated as \"Wise girl\". (In some literature it is less correctly translated as \"good girl\".)\n\n===Silvermaster group===\n\nMost of Bentley's contacts were in what prosecutors and historians would later call the \"[[FBI Silvermaster File|Silvermaster group]]\", a network of spies centered around [[Nathan Gregory Silvermaster]]. This network became one of the most important Soviet espionage operations in the United States.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=45}}</ref> Silvermaster worked with the [[Resettlement Administration]] and later with the [[Board of Economic Warfare]]. He did not have access to much sensitive information, but he knew several Communists and sympathizers within the government who were better placed and willing to pass such information to him. Using Elizabeth Bentley, he sent it to Moscow. At this time, the Soviet Union and the United States were allies in the [[World War II|Second World War]], and much of the information Silvermaster collected for the Soviets had to do with the war against [[Nazi Germany]]. As the Soviets were absorbing all of the burden of the ground war in Europe, at a frightful cost in terms of people and materi\u00e8l, they were interested in US intelligence: It included secret estimates of German military strength, data on U.S. munitions production, and information on the Allies' schedule for opening a [[operation Overlord|second front in Europe]]. The contacts in Golos's and Bentley's extended network ranged from dedicated [[Stalinism|Stalinists]] to, in the words of Bentley's biographer Kathryn Olmsted, \"romantic idealists\" who \"wanted to help the brave Russians beat the Nazi war machine\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|pp=50, 51}}</ref>\n\n===Conflicts with Soviet spymasters===\n\nLate in 1943, Jacob Golos suffered a fatal heart attack. After meeting with CPUSA [[General Secretary]] [[Earl Browder]], Bentley decided to continue her espionage work and accepted Golos's place. Her new contact in Soviet intelligence was [[Iskhak Akhmerov]], the leading [[NKGB]] ''[[Illegal Rezident]],'' or undercover spy chief working without a diplomatic cover. Under orders from Moscow, Akhmerov wanted to have Bentley's contacts report directly to him. Bentley, Browder and Golos had resisted this change, believing that using an American intermediary was the best way to handle their sources, and fearing that Russian agents would endanger the American spies and possibly drive them away. With Browder's support, Bentley initially ignored a series of orders that she \"hand over\" her agents to Akhmerov. She expanded her spy network when Browder gave her control over another group of agents. This was the \"[[Perlo group]]\", with contacts in the [[War Production Board]], the [[United States Senate]], and the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]].<ref>\n{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|pp=63\u201365}}</ref>\n\nBentley had been noted since her days in [[Florence]] as suffering from bouts of [[depression (mood disorder)|depression]] and having a problem with alcohol. Now, despondent and lonely after the death of Golos and under increasing pressure from Soviet intelligence, she began to drink more heavily. She missed work at U.S. Service and Shipping, and neighbors described her as drinking \"all the time\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=67}}</ref>\n\nIn early June 1944, Browder acceded to Akhmerov's demands and agreed to instruct the members of the Silvermaster group to report directly to the NKGB. Bentley later said that this was the event that turned her against Communism in the United States. \"I discovered then that Earl Browder was just a puppet, that somebody pulled the strings in Moscow,\" she would say.<ref>Grand jury testimony in ''United States of America vs. Alger Hiss'', quoted in {{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=69}}</ref> Her biographers suggest that Bentley's objections, rather than being ideological, were related more to a lifelong dislike of being given orders and a sense that the reassignments of her contacts left her with no meaningful role.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=69}}, {{Harvnb|Kessler|2003|p=100}}</ref> Late in 1944, Bentley was ordered to give up all of her remaining sources, including the Perlo group she had recently acquired. Her Soviet superior also told her that she would have to leave her position as vice president of U.S. Service and Shipping.\n\n===Break with Soviets===\n\nIn 1945 Bentley began an affair with a man whom she came to suspect to be either an FBI or a Soviet agent sent to spy on her. Her Soviet contact suggested that she should emigrate to the Soviet Union, but Bentley feared this might end with her execution there.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=78}}</ref> In August 1945, Bentley went to the FBI office in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and met with the [[agent-in-charge]]. She did not immediately defect. She seemed to be \"feeling out\" the FBI, and it was not until November that she began to tell her full story to the agency. In the meantime, her personal situation continued to worsen. In September she met with [[Anatoly Gorsky]], her latest NKGB controller, and was recorded as arriving drunk to the meeting.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=93}}</ref>  She became angry with Gorsky, berated him and his fellow Russian agents as \"gangsters\", and obliquely threatened to become an informer. She soon realized that her tirade could have put her life in danger. When Gorsky reported on this to Moscow, his recommendation was to \"get rid of her\".<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Weinstein | first1 = Allen | last2 = Vassiliev | first2 = Alexander \n | year = 2000\n | title = The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America--The Stalin Era\n | publisher = Modern Library\n | isbn = 0-375-75536-5\n | page = 102\n}}</ref>\n\nMoscow advised Gorsky to be patient with Bentley and calm her down. A few weeks later it was revealed that [[Louis Budenz]], editor of the CPUSA newspaper and one of Bentley's sources, had defected to the United States. Budenz had not yet revealed any of his knowledge of espionage activity, but he knew Elizabeth Bentley's name and knew she was a spy. Imperiled on both sides, Bentley made her final decision to defect and went back to the FBI on November 6, 1945.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Defection and after==\n\nIn a series of debriefing interviews with the FBI beginning November 7, 1945, Bentley implicated nearly 150 people in spying for the Soviet Union,<ref>Amy W. Knight, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=29Iq1f_dNekC&pg=PP1&dq=how+the+cold+war+began&sig=SQp0N87ge-jop_qbhIujSKH6Iqs#PPA93,M1 How the Cold War Began: The Igor Gouzenko Affair and the Hunt for Soviet Spies]'' (Carroll & Graf, 2006) {{ISBN|0-7867-1816-1}}, p. 93</ref> including 37 federal employees. The FBI already suspected many of those she named, and some had been named by earlier defectors [[Igor Gouzenko]] and [[Whittaker Chambers]]. This increased FBI confidence in her account and person. They gave her the code name \"Gregory,\" and [[J. Edgar Hoover]] ordered the strictest secrecy measures be taken to hide her identity and defection. \n\nHoover advised [[Sir William Stephenson]], head of [[British Intelligence|British Security Coordination]] for the Western hemisphere, of Bentley's defection, and Stephenson duly notified London. But [[Kim Philby]] was the head of the British Secret Intelligence Service's (SIS or \"MI6\") new Section IX (counter-espionage against the Soviet Union). He was a Soviet double agent who would escape to the Soviet Union in 1963. Philby promptly alerted Moscow about Bentley, and they shut down all contact with Bentley's network, just as the FBI was beginning surveillance of them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=105}}</ref> Bentley's NKGB contact Gorsky again recommended to Moscow that the American be \"liquidated\", and again Moscow rejected the idea.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Weinstein | first1 = Allen | last2 = Vassiliev | first2 = Alexander\n | year = 2000\n | title = The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America--The Stalin Era\n | publisher = Modern Library\n | pages = 106\u2013108\n | isbn = 0-375-75536-5\n}}</ref>\n\nThe breach of secrecy around Bentley's defection foiled a year-long attempt by the FBI to have her act as a [[double agent]]. Additionally, because of the shutdown of Soviet espionage activity, the FBI surveillance of the agents Bentley had named turned up no evidence that could be used to prosecute them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|pp=106\u2013107}}</ref> Some 250 FBI agents were assigned to the Bentley case, following up the leads she had provided and, through phone tap, surveillance and mail openings, investigating people she had named. The FBI, grand juries and congressional committees would eventually interview many of these alleged spies, but each of them would either invoke their [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right not to testify or maintain their innocence.\n\nFor [[J. Edgar Hoover]] and a few highly placed FBI and army intelligence personnel, the definitive corroboration of Bentley's story came some time in the late 1940s to early 1950s, when the highly secret [[Venona project]] succeeded in decrypting some wartime cables sent between Soviet intelligence agents and Moscow. In these cables, Bentley was referred to by the codename which she had told the FBI, and there were discussions of several of her known contacts and documents which she was known to have passed on to the Soviets.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kessler|2003|pp=144\u2013147}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n | last = Schrecker\n | first = Ellen\n | authorlink = Ellen Schrecker\n | year = 1998\n | title = Many Are the Crimes: McCarthyism in America\n | publisher = Little, Brown\n | pages = [https://archive.org/details/manyarecrimesmcc00schr/page/173 173, 174]\n | isbn = 0-316-77470-7\n | url = https://archive.org/details/manyarecrimesmcc00schr/page/173\n }}</ref>\n\nThe Venona project was classified and was considered so secret that the US Government was unwilling to expose it by allowing any material from it to be used as evidence in any trial. Neither presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt nor [[Harry Truman]] were aware of the Venona project by name, though they received some of its conclusions as summarized by J. Edgar Hoover in weekly intelligence reports.\n\n===Public testimony===\n\nWith the chances of successful prosecution looking unlikely, Hoover gave the names of some of Bentley's contacts to certain U.S. Congressmen, with the understanding that the accused spies would be questioned before congressional committees. He believed that the publicized suspicion and accusations would be sufficient to ruin their careers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=117}}</ref> Additionally, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Tom C. Clark]] decided to present the Bentley case to a [[grand jury]], although he thought there was little chance they would be able to return any indictments. Bentley testified before this grand jury on several occasions, lasting until April 1948. During this period, some details of her case began to leak to the press.\n\nBentley decided to reveal her full story herself, to exert more control. She met with [[Nelson Frank]] and [[Norton Mockridge]], journalists from the ''[[New York World-Telegram]]''. During four consecutive days, the newspaper published a series of front-page stories about the unnamed \"beautiful young blonde\" who had exposed a ring of spies. The articles<ref>\n{{cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=P0AhAQAAIAAJ\n| pages = \n| title = Catalog of Copyright Entries: Third Series: 1948\n| publisher = 430\n| date = 1948\n| accessdate = 2 October 2018}}</ref> were:\n* \"Red Ring Bared by Blond Queen\" (July 21, 1948)\n* \"Super-Secrecy Veiled Russia's Spy Cells Here\" (July 22, 1948)\n* \"Citizens Tricked into Spy Ring by U.S. Reds\" (July 23, 1948)\n* \"Commie Chieftains Ordered [[Louis F. Budenz|Budenz]] to Aid Red Spy Queen\" (July 26, 1948)\n\nAlmost immediately following the ''World-Telegram'' articles, Bentley was subpoenaed to testify at a public hearing of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) on July 31, 1948, (see hearing transcript<ref>\n{{cite web\n| title = Hearings before the Committee on Un-American Activities, House of Representatives, 80th Congress, 2nd Session, Public Law 601 (Section 121, Subsection Q (2)) \n| url = https://archive.org/stream/hearingsregardin1948unit/hearingsregardin1948unit_djvu.txt\n| accessdate = 11 August 2013}}</ref>).\n\nAccording to Olmsted's biography, reporters' accounts and analyses of Bentley's testimony varied with their politics. The strongly anti-communist ''[[New York Journal-American]]'' described Bentley as a \"shapely\" \"blonde and blue-eyed New Yorker\" who \"lured\" secrets from her sources, while [[A. J. Liebling]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' ridiculed her story and called her the \"Nutmeg [[Mata Hari]].\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=134}}</ref> For her part, Bentley portrayed herself as na\u00efve and innocent, corrupted by her liberal professors at Vassar and seduced into espionage by Golos.\n\nStarting on August 3, 1948, during additional HUAC hearings, Bentley received some corroboration from [[Whittaker Chambers]]. Under subpoena by HUAC, he testified that he knew at least two of Bentley's contacts, [[Victor Perlo]] and [[Charles Kramer (economist)|Charles Kramer]], as communists and members of his earlier [[Ware group|Ware Group]]. He also supported her accusation that [[Harry Dexter White]], a prominent economist who had worked in the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]], was a communist sympathizer.  Comparing their testimony, Chambers wrote in his memoir: \n<blockquote>I knew that I was simply back-stopping Miss Bentley, that hers was the current testimony. The things that I had to tell were ten years old and I had only to let the shadows, dust and cobwebs conspicuously drape them to leave the stand unscathed.<ref name=Witness>\n  {{Cite book\n |last=Chambers \n |first=Whittaker \n |authorlink = Whittaker Chambers\n |title=Witness \n |publisher=Random House \n |year=1952 \n |location=New York \n |pages=533 \n |id= \n |isbn= \n|lccn=52005149 \n }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMany reporters and commentators were skeptical about Bentley's claims. Since some of those she accused were prominent figures in two Democratic administrations, Democrats in particular were eager to have her discredited. President Truman at one point characterized her testimony as a Republican-inspired \"red herring.\" Republicans, in turn, accused Truman of \"covering up\" communist espionage. Conflicts of this nature, along with fears of Soviet communist power in Europe and the increasingly publicized hearings of HUAC, were the background to the rise of [[McCarthyism]]. The witch hunt for communists initiated by Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] (R-Wisconsin) became a central factor in domestic American politics in the 1950s.\n\n===''Meet the Press''===\n\nOn August 6, 1948, Bentley appeared on NBC Radio's ''[[Meet the Press]]'', broadcast at 10 p.m. via [[WOR (AM)|WOR]].<ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Programs on the Air: Radio\n| work=The New York Times\n| url = \n| page = 34\n| date = 6 August 1948\n}}</ref>\n\nOn Sunday, September 12, 1948, she appeared on the first-ever television broadcast  of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]],'' via [[WNBC|WNBT]], and was the first person interviewed. Journalists included: [[Nelson Frank]], [[Inez Robb]], [[Cecil Brown (journalist)|Cecil Brown]], and [[Lawrence Spivak]]. Brown asked her three times whether she would accuse [[William Remington]] of being a communist, outside of congressional protection, and she finally did so. When he was called before a Truman Loyalty Review Board, [[Joseph L. Rauh Jr.]] defended him. His attorney [[Richard G. Green (lawyer)|Richard Green]] asked on Remington's behalf for Bentley to withdraw the allegations by September 30. \n\nWhen she did not, Green filed a libel suit on October 6, 1948 against Bentley, NBC, and its television sponsor [[General Foods Corporation]], seeking $100,000 in damages. Bentley failed to appear in court in October. On December 29, 1948, Green said he had personally served a summons on her. (The same day, judges and lawyers agreed to suspend [[Alger Hiss]]'s libel suit against [[Whittaker Chambers]] because of Department of Justice indictments of Hiss on two counts of perjury two weeks before).<ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Radio and Television: 'Meet the Press' Goes on NBC Video Network Starting Sunday\n| work=The New York Times\n| url = \n| page = 46\n| date = 10 September 1948\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Radio and Television Programs: Today's Leading Events: Television\n| work=The New York Times\n| url = \n| page = X8\n| date = 12 September 1948\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Remington Makes Libel Suit Threats\n| newspaper = Washington Post\n| page = 10\n| date = 24 September 1948\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Board Doubts If Remington Was Loyal\n| newspaper = Washington Post\n| page = 3\n| date = 29 September 1948\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Fact or Libel\n| newspaper = Washington Post\n| page = 14\n| date = 30 September 1948\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Remington Files $100,000 Libel Suit: Names Miss Bentley, Who Said He Was a Communist, NBC and Television Sponsor\n| work=The New York Times\n| url = \n| page = 9\n| date = 7 October 1948\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Leonard Lyons\n| work=The New York Times\n| url = \n| page = B14\n| date = 14 October 1948\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Elizabeth Bentley Served in Libel Suit\n| newspaper = Washington Post\n| page = 10\n| date = 30 December 1948\n}}</ref>\n\n===Trials and credibility===\n\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}\nMost of the people accused by Bentley invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer her charges. A few, however, specifically denied them. Most notable of these was [[Harry Dexter White]]. He was already suffering from known heart disease; he died of a heart attack a few days after his testimony before HUAC. Others who denied Bentley's charges were [[Lauchlin Currie]], formerly President Roosevelt's economic affairs advisor; [[William Remington]] and [[William Henry Taylor]], both midlevel government economists; [[Duncan Lee]], formerly with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS); and Abe Brothman, a private-sector chemist who worked on defense projects. As noted above, in October 1948, William Remington sued Bentley and NBC for libel. In hopes of discrediting her, Remington's attorneys hired private detectives to look into her past. They produced  evidence of her alcoholism, periods of severe depression, and a suicide attempt while a student in Florence; they alleged that her master's thesis had been written by someone else, and that, by the standards of the day, she had been sexually promiscuous since her college days. Bentley declined to testify at a Remington loyalty board hearing, and NBC settled the libel case out of court for $10,000.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nBentley testified in the trials of four accused spies: The [[perjury]] trial of William Remington, a case against Abe Brothman for [[obstruction of justice]], and [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] trials on charges of conspiracy to commit espionage. Bentley was peripherally involved in the Rosenberg case.  She was used by the prosecution to develop two points: first, the actions of American Communists in becoming spies for the Soviet Union; and second, to establish, if only vaguely in the jury's mind, a connection between Julius Rosenberg and Golos. She testified that she would receive calls from a man who identified himself as Julius, after which Golos would go out to meet him.\n\nAfter defecting to US authorities, Bentley's personal life became increasingly tumultuous. She continued to drink heavily, was involved in car accidents, and had a relationship with a man who beat her severely. She avoided subpoenas on a number of occasions. These incidents, along with generally erratic behavior, resulted in her FBI handlers worrying that she was \"bordering on some mental pitfall\".<ref>\n{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=161}}</ref>\n\nBut she was invariably calm and professional on the witness stand, earning praise from the prosecutors whose cases she was supporting. As Bentley repeatedly testified before grand juries, congressional committees and jury trials, however, she refined and embellished some details of her story. Information passed to her about a process for manufacturing synthetic rubber that was originally \"vague\" and \"probably of no value\" became \"super-secret\" and \"an extremely complicated thing.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|pp=102, 163}}</ref>  She would also assert that her espionage gave her advance notice of the [[Doolittle raid]] on Japan and the [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]] invasions of France, both claims that appeared to have been exaggerated.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=195}}</ref>\n\n====William Remington====\n\nRemington's first trial began in late December 1950. [[Roy Cohn]], later to become famous as chief counsel for Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] on HUAC and already a noted anti-communist, joined the prosecution's legal team. Bentley later supplied a wealth of detail about Remington's involvement with her and the espionage conspiracy. Remington's defense was that he had never handled any classified material, hence could not have given any to Bentley. \n\nBut she remembered all the facts about the rubber-from-garbage invention: \n<blockquote>\"We had searched through the archives and discovered the files on the process. We also found the aircraft schedules, which were set up exactly as she said, and inter office memos and tables of personnel which proved Remington had access to both these items. We also discovered Remington's application for a naval commission in which he specifically pointed out that he was, in his present position with the Commerce Department, entrusted with secret military information involving airplanes, armaments, radar, and the Manhattan Project (the atomic bomb).\" <ref>Roy Cohn, ''McCarthy'' (1968) page 38</ref></blockquote>\n\nDuring the trial eleven witnesses claimed they knew Remington to be a communist. This included Bentley; ex-wife Ann Remington; Professor Howard Bridgeman of [[Tufts University]]; Kenneth McConnell, a Communist organizer in Knoxville; Rudolph Bertram and Christine Benson, who worked with him at the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]; and [[Paul Crouch (activist)|Paul Crouch]], who provided him with copies of the southern edition of the communist newspaper, ''[[The Daily Worker]].''<ref>[http://spartacus-educational.com/William_Remington.htm William Remington]</ref>\n\n==== Occupation currency plates ====\n\nBentley also testified that [[Harry Dexter White]] was responsible for passing Treasury plates for printing Allied currency in Occupied Germany to the Soviet Union, which used them to print millions of [[German mark|marks]].<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n  | last = Van Hook\n  | first = James C. \n  | author-link = \n  | author2-link = \n  | title = Review of ''Treasonable Doubt: The Harry Dexter White Spy Case''\n  | journal = Studies in Intelligence\n  | year = 2005\n  | volume = 49\n  | issue = 1\n  | edition = \n  | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol49no1/html_files/harry_dexter_8.html\n  | ref = harv\n  | postscript = <!--None-->\n  }}</ref>\nRussian soldiers exchanged these marks for goods and hard currency.

She continued occasional consultations with the FBI for the rest of her life. In 1952, she began accepting payments for times when she testified, making her a \"paid informer\" for the FBI.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|pp=179\u2013180}}</ref>\n\nThough she had been a successful executive with a profitable shipping company while she was with the Communists, she changed fields after her defection.

Reporters and historians were divided for decades as to the validity of her allegations.  In the 1990s, declassification of both Soviet documents and the U.S. codebreaking [[Venona project]] lent some credence to Bentley's allegations. After she defected, the Soviet Union temporarily suspended espionage activities in the United States. But some of Bentley's claims remain controversial due to questions about the accuracy of translations and the vague nature of identities, given that agents were identified by code names in encrypted records captured in Venona. \n\n==See also==\n* [[Jacob Golos]]\n* [[Nathan Gregory Silvermaster]]\n* [[Victor Perlo]]\n* [[Perlo group]]\n* [[Harry Dexter White]]\n* [[Whittaker Chambers]]\n* [[Ware group]]\n* [[Igor Gouzenko]]\n* [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]\n* [[Devin-Adair Publishing Company]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n\n===Biographies===\n\nCurrently, two biographies of Elizabeth Bentley have been published:\n\n*{{Cite book\n | last1=Olmsted \n | first=Kathryn S. \n | title=Red Spy Queen: A Biography of Elizabeth Bentley \n | publisher=The University of North Carolina Press\n | place= \n | year=2002\n | isbn = 0-8078-2739-8 \n | ref=harv \n | postscript=<!--None--> \n}}\n*{{Cite book |last1      = Kessler\n |first      = Lauren\n |authorlink = Lauren Kessler\n |title      = Clever Girl: Elizabeth Bentley, the Spy Who Ushered in the McCarthy Era\n |publisher  = Harper Perennial\n |place      = \n |year       = 2003\n |isbn       = 0-06-095973-8\n |ref        = harv\n |postscript = <!--None-->\n |url-access = registration\n |url        = https://archive.org/details/clevergirlelizab0000kess\n}}\n\n===Other references===\n*{{Cite book\n | last=Bentley\n | first=Elizabeth\n | url=https://books.google.com/?id=yz41AAAAIAAJ&q\n | title=Out of Bondage \n | publisher=Devin-Adair Publishing Company\n | place= \n | year=1951\n | isbn=0-8041-0164-7 \n | pages=326 \n | ref=harv}}\n*  {{Cite book\n |last=Chambers \n |first=Whittaker \n |title=Witness \n |authorlink = Whittaker Chambers\n |publisher=Random House \n |year=1952 \n |location=New York \n |pages=339 \n |id= \n |isbn=978-0-8488-0958-4 \n|lccn=52005149 \n }}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Craig\n  | first = R.

But Golos was one of the Soviet Union's most important intelligence agents in the United States. At the time when he and Bentley met, Golos was involved in planning the assassination of [[Leon Trotsky]], which would take place in [[Mexico]] in 1940.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=22}}</ref> Bentley and Golos soon became lovers. It was more than a year before she learned his true name, and, according to her later testimony, two years before she knew that he was working for Soviet intelligence.\n\nIn 1940, two years into their relationship, the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] forced Golos to register as an agent of the Soviet government under the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]]. This increased his risk in contacting the network of American spies he controlled, and accepting documents from them. He gradually transferred this responsibility to Bentley. Golos also needed someone to take charge of the day-to-day business of the United States Service and Shipping Corporation, a [[Comintern]] front organization for espionage activities.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kessler|2003|p=77}}</ref> Bentley took on this role as well. Although she was never directly paid for any of her espionage work, she would eventually earn $800 a month as vice president of U.S. Service and Shipping, a considerable salary for the time,<ref>{{Harvnb|Kessler|2003|p=150}}</ref> {{Inflation|US|800|1940|r=0|fmt=eq}}<!-- Based on 1940 dollars. --> (per month). As Bentley acquired an important role in Soviet intelligence, the Soviets gave her the code name ''Umnitsa'', loosely translated as \"Wise girl\". (In some literature it is less correctly translated as \"good girl\".)\n\n===Silvermaster group===\n\nMost of Bentley's contacts were in what prosecutors and historians would later call the \"[[FBI Silvermaster File|Silvermaster group]]\", a network of spies centered around [[Nathan Gregory Silvermaster]]. This network became one of the most important Soviet espionage operations in the United States.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=45}}</ref> Silvermaster worked with the [[Resettlement Administration]] and later with the [[Board of Economic Warfare]]. He did not have access to much sensitive information, but he knew several Communists and sympathizers within the government who were better placed and willing to pass such information to him. Using Elizabeth Bentley, he sent it to Moscow. At this time, the Soviet Union and the United States were allies in the [[World War II|Second World War]], and much of the information Silvermaster collected for the Soviets had to do with the war against [[Nazi Germany]]. As the Soviets were absorbing all of the burden of the ground war in Europe, at a frightful cost in terms of people and materi\u00e8l, they were interested in US intelligence: It included secret estimates of German military strength, data on U.S. munitions production, and information on the Allies' schedule for opening a [[operation Overlord|second front in Europe]]. The contacts in Golos's and Bentley's extended network ranged from dedicated [[Stalinism|Stalinists]] to, in the words of Bentley's biographer Kathryn Olmsted, \"romantic idealists\" who \"wanted to help the brave Russians beat the Nazi war machine\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|pp=50, 51}}</ref>\n\n===Conflicts with Soviet spymasters===\n\nLate in 1943, Jacob Golos suffered a fatal heart attack. After meeting with CPUSA [[General Secretary]] [[Earl Browder]], Bentley decided to continue her espionage work and accepted Golos's place. Her new contact in Soviet intelligence was [[Iskhak Akhmerov]], the leading [[NKGB]] ''[[Illegal Rezident]],'' or undercover spy chief working without a diplomatic cover. Under orders from Moscow, Akhmerov wanted to have Bentley's contacts report directly to him. Bentley, Browder and Golos had resisted this change, believing that using an American intermediary was the best way to handle their sources, and fearing that Russian agents would endanger the American spies and possibly drive them away. With Browder's support, Bentley initially ignored a series of orders that she \"hand over\" her agents to Akhmerov. She expanded her spy network when Browder gave her control over another group of agents. This was the \"[[Perlo group]]\", with contacts in the [[War Production Board]], the [[United States Senate]], and the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]].<ref>\n{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|pp=63\u201365}}</ref>\n\nBentley had been noted since her days in [[Florence]] as suffering from bouts of [[depression (mood disorder)|depression]] and having a problem with alcohol. Now, despondent and lonely after the death of Golos and under increasing pressure from Soviet intelligence, she began to drink more heavily. She missed work at U.S. Service and Shipping, and neighbors described her as drinking \"all the time\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=67}}</ref>\n\nIn early June 1944, Browder acceded to Akhmerov's demands and agreed to instruct the members of the Silvermaster group to report directly to the NKGB. Bentley later said that this was the event that turned her against Communism in the United States. \"I discovered then that Earl Browder was just a puppet, that somebody pulled the strings in Moscow,\" she would say.<ref>Grand jury testimony in ''United States of America vs. Alger Hiss'', quoted in {{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=69}}</ref> Her biographers suggest that Bentley's objections, rather than being ideological, were related more to a lifelong dislike of being given orders and a sense that the reassignments of her contacts left her with no meaningful role.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=69}}, {{Harvnb|Kessler|2003|p=100}}</ref> Late in 1944, Bentley was ordered to give up all of her remaining sources, including the Perlo group she had recently acquired. Her Soviet superior also told her that she would have to leave her position as vice president of U.S. Service and Shipping.\n\n===Break with Soviets===\n\nIn 1945 Bentley began an affair with a man whom she came to suspect to be either an FBI or a Soviet agent sent to spy on her. Her Soviet contact suggested that she should emigrate to the Soviet Union, but Bentley feared this might end with her execution there.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=78}}</ref> In August 1945, Bentley went to the FBI office in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and met with the [[agent-in-charge]]. She did not immediately defect. She seemed to be \"feeling out\" the FBI, and it was not until November that she began to tell her full story to the agency. In the meantime, her personal situation continued to worsen. In September she met with [[Anatoly Gorsky]], her latest NKGB controller, and was recorded as arriving drunk to the meeting.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=93}}</ref>  She became angry with Gorsky, berated him and his fellow Russian agents as \"gangsters\", and obliquely threatened to become an informer. She soon realized that her tirade could have put her life in danger. When Gorsky reported on this to Moscow, his recommendation was to \"get rid of her\".<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Weinstein | first1 = Allen | last2 = Vassiliev | first2 = Alexander \n | year = 2000\n | title = The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America--The Stalin Era\n | publisher = Modern Library\n | isbn = 0-375-75536-5\n | page = 102\n}}</ref>\n\nMoscow advised Gorsky to be patient with Bentley and calm her down. A few weeks later it was revealed that [[Louis Budenz]], editor of the CPUSA newspaper and one of Bentley's sources, had defected to the United States. Budenz had not yet revealed any of his knowledge of espionage activity, but he knew Elizabeth Bentley's name and knew she was a spy. Imperiled on both sides, Bentley made her final decision to defect and went back to the FBI on November 6, 1945.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Defection and after==\n\nIn a series of debriefing interviews with the FBI beginning November 7, 1945, Bentley implicated nearly 150 people in spying for the Soviet Union,<ref>Amy W. Knight, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=29Iq1f_dNekC&pg=PP1&dq=how+the+cold+war+began&sig=SQp0N87ge-jop_qbhIujSKH6Iqs#PPA93,M1 How the Cold War Began: The Igor Gouzenko Affair and the Hunt for Soviet Spies]'' (Carroll & Graf, 2006) {{ISBN|0-7867-1816-1}}, p. 93</ref> including 37 federal employees. The FBI already suspected many of those she named, and some had been named by earlier defectors [[Igor Gouzenko]] and [[Whittaker Chambers]]. This increased FBI confidence in her account and person. They gave her the code name \"Gregory,\" and [[J. Edgar Hoover]] ordered the strictest secrecy measures be taken to hide her identity and defection. \n\nHoover advised [[Sir William Stephenson]], head of [[British Intelligence|British Security Coordination]] for the Western hemisphere, of Bentley's defection, and Stephenson duly notified London. But [[Kim Philby]] was the head of the British Secret Intelligence Service's (SIS or \"MI6\") new Section IX (counter-espionage against the Soviet Union). He was a Soviet double agent who would escape to the Soviet Union in 1963. Philby promptly alerted Moscow about Bentley, and they shut down all contact with Bentley's network, just as the FBI was beginning surveillance of them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=105}}</ref> Bentley's NKGB contact Gorsky again recommended to Moscow that the American be \"liquidated\", and again Moscow rejected the idea.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | last1 = Weinstein | first1 = Allen | last2 = Vassiliev | first2 = Alexander\n | year = 2000\n | title = The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America--The Stalin Era\n | publisher = Modern Library\n | pages = 106\u2013108\n | isbn = 0-375-75536-5\n}}</ref>\n\nThe breach of secrecy around Bentley's defection foiled a year-long attempt by the FBI to have her act as a [[double agent]]. Additionally, because of the shutdown of Soviet espionage activity, the FBI surveillance of the agents Bentley had named turned up no evidence that could be used to prosecute them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|pp=106\u2013107}}</ref> Some 250 FBI agents were assigned to the Bentley case, following up the leads she had provided and, through phone tap, surveillance and mail openings, investigating people she had named. The FBI, grand juries and congressional committees would eventually interview many of these alleged spies, but each of them would either invoke their [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right not to testify or maintain their innocence.\n\nFor [[J. Edgar Hoover]] and a few highly placed FBI and army intelligence personnel, the definitive corroboration of Bentley's story came some time in the late 1940s to early 1950s, when the highly secret [[Venona project]] succeeded in decrypting some wartime cables sent between Soviet intelligence agents and Moscow. In these cables, Bentley was referred to by the codename which she had told the FBI, and there were discussions of several of her known contacts and documents which she was known to have passed on to the Soviets.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kessler|2003|pp=144\u2013147}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book\n | last = Schrecker\n | first = Ellen\n | authorlink = Ellen Schrecker\n | year = 1998\n | title = Many Are the Crimes: McCarthyism in America\n | publisher = Little, Brown\n | pages = [https://archive.org/details/manyarecrimesmcc00schr/page/173 173, 174]\n | isbn = 0-316-77470-7\n | url = https://archive.org/details/manyarecrimesmcc00schr/page/173\n }}</ref>\n\nThe Venona project was classified and was considered so secret that the US Government was unwilling to expose it by allowing any material from it to be used as evidence in any trial. Neither presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt nor [[Harry Truman]] were aware of the Venona project by name, though they received some of its conclusions as summarized by J. Edgar Hoover in weekly intelligence reports.\n\n===Public testimony===\n\nWith the chances of successful prosecution looking unlikely, Hoover gave the names of some of Bentley's contacts to certain U.S. Congressmen, with the understanding that the accused spies would be questioned before congressional committees. He believed that the publicized suspicion and accusations would be sufficient to ruin their careers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=117}}</ref> Additionally, [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Tom C. Clark]] decided to present the Bentley case to a [[grand jury]], although he thought there was little chance they would be able to return any indictments. Bentley testified before this grand jury on several occasions, lasting until April 1948. During this period, some details of her case began to leak to the press.\n\nBentley decided to reveal her full story herself, to exert more control. She met with [[Nelson Frank]] and [[Norton Mockridge]], journalists from the ''[[New York World-Telegram]]''. During four consecutive days, the newspaper published a series of front-page stories about the unnamed \"beautiful young blonde\" who had exposed a ring of spies. The articles<ref>\n{{cite book\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=P0AhAQAAIAAJ\n| pages = \n| title = Catalog of Copyright Entries: Third Series: 1948\n| publisher = 430\n| date = 1948\n| accessdate = 2 October 2018}}</ref> were:\n* \"Red Ring Bared by Blond Queen\" (July 21, 1948)\n* \"Super-Secrecy Veiled Russia's Spy Cells Here\" (July 22, 1948)\n* \"Citizens Tricked into Spy Ring by U.S. Reds\" (July 23, 1948)\n* \"Commie Chieftains Ordered [[Louis F. Budenz|Budenz]] to Aid Red Spy Queen\" (July 26, 1948)\n\nAlmost immediately following the ''World-Telegram'' articles, Bentley was subpoenaed to testify at a public hearing of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) on July 31, 1948, (see hearing transcript<ref>\n{{cite web\n| title = Hearings before the Committee on Un-American Activities, House of Representatives, 80th Congress, 2nd Session, Public Law 601 (Section 121, Subsection Q (2)) \n| url = https://archive.org/stream/hearingsregardin1948unit/hearingsregardin1948unit_djvu.txt\n| accessdate = 11 August 2013}}</ref>).\n\nAccording to Olmsted's biography, reporters' accounts and analyses of Bentley's testimony varied with their politics. The strongly anti-communist ''[[New York Journal-American]]'' described Bentley as a \"shapely\" \"blonde and blue-eyed New Yorker\" who \"lured\" secrets from her sources, while [[A. J. Liebling]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' ridiculed her story and called her the \"Nutmeg [[Mata Hari]].\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=134}}</ref> For her part, Bentley portrayed herself as na\u00efve and innocent, corrupted by her liberal professors at Vassar and seduced into espionage by Golos.\n\nStarting on August 3, 1948, during additional HUAC hearings, Bentley received some corroboration from [[Whittaker Chambers]]. Under subpoena by HUAC, he testified that he knew at least two of Bentley's contacts, [[Victor Perlo]] and [[Charles Kramer (economist)|Charles Kramer]], as communists and members of his earlier [[Ware group|Ware Group]]. He also supported her accusation that [[Harry Dexter White]], a prominent economist who had worked in the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]], was a communist sympathizer.  Comparing their testimony, Chambers wrote in his memoir: \n<blockquote>I knew that I was simply back-stopping Miss Bentley, that hers was the current testimony. The things that I had to tell were ten years old and I had only to let the shadows, dust and cobwebs conspicuously drape them to leave the stand unscathed.<ref name=Witness>\n  {{Cite book\n |last=Chambers \n |first=Whittaker \n |authorlink = Whittaker Chambers\n |title=Witness \n |publisher=Random House \n |year=1952 \n |location=New York \n |pages=533 \n |id= \n |isbn= \n|lccn=52005149 \n }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMany reporters and commentators were skeptical about Bentley's claims. Since some of those she accused were prominent figures in two Democratic administrations, Democrats in particular were eager to have her discredited. President Truman at one point characterized her testimony as a Republican-inspired \"red herring.\" Republicans, in turn, accused Truman of \"covering up\" communist espionage. Conflicts of this nature, along with fears of Soviet communist power in Europe and the increasingly publicized hearings of HUAC, were the background to the rise of [[McCarthyism]]. The witch hunt for communists initiated by Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] (R-Wisconsin) became a central factor in domestic American politics in the 1950s.\n\n===''Meet the Press''===\n\nOn August 6, 1948, Bentley appeared on NBC Radio's ''[[Meet the Press]]'', broadcast at 10 p.m. via [[WOR (AM)|WOR]].<ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Programs on the Air: Radio\n| work=The New York Times\n| url = \n| page = 34\n| date = 6 August 1948\n}}</ref>\n\nOn Sunday, September 12, 1948, she appeared on the first-ever television broadcast  of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]],'' via [[WNBC|WNBT]], and was the first person interviewed. Journalists included: [[Nelson Frank]], [[Inez Robb]], [[Cecil Brown (journalist)|Cecil Brown]], and [[Lawrence Spivak]]. Brown asked her three times whether she would accuse [[William Remington]] of being a communist, outside of congressional protection, and she finally did so. When he was called before a Truman Loyalty Review Board, [[Joseph L. Rauh Jr.]] defended him. His attorney [[Richard G. Green (lawyer)|Richard Green]] asked on Remington's behalf for Bentley to withdraw the allegations by September 30. \n\nWhen she did not, Green filed a libel suit on October 6, 1948 against Bentley, NBC, and its television sponsor [[General Foods Corporation]], seeking $100,000 in damages. Bentley failed to appear in court in October. On December 29, 1948, Green said he had personally served a summons on her. (The same day, judges and lawyers agreed to suspend [[Alger Hiss]]'s libel suit against [[Whittaker Chambers]] because of Department of Justice indictments of Hiss on two counts of perjury two weeks before).<ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Radio and Television: 'Meet the Press' Goes on NBC Video Network Starting Sunday\n| work=The New York Times\n| url = \n| page = 46\n| date = 10 September 1948\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Radio and Television Programs: Today's Leading Events: Television\n| work=The New York Times\n| url = \n| page = X8\n| date = 12 September 1948\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Remington Makes Libel Suit Threats\n| newspaper = Washington Post\n| page = 10\n| date = 24 September 1948\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Board Doubts If Remington Was Loyal\n| newspaper = Washington Post\n| page = 3\n| date = 29 September 1948\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Fact or Libel\n| newspaper = Washington Post\n| page = 14\n| date = 30 September 1948\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Remington Files $100,000 Libel Suit: Names Miss Bentley, Who Said He Was a Communist, NBC and Television Sponsor\n| work=The New York Times\n| url = \n| page = 9\n| date = 7 October 1948\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Leonard Lyons\n| work=The New York Times\n| url = \n| page = B14\n| date = 14 October 1948\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n| title = Elizabeth Bentley Served in Libel Suit\n| newspaper = Washington Post\n| page = 10\n| date = 30 December 1948\n}}</ref>\n\n===Trials and credibility===\n\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}\nMost of the people accused by Bentley invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer her charges. A few, however, specifically denied them. Most notable of these was [[Harry Dexter White]]. He was already suffering from known heart disease; he died of a heart attack a few days after his testimony before HUAC. Others who denied Bentley's charges were [[Lauchlin Currie]], formerly President Roosevelt's economic affairs advisor; [[William Remington]] and [[William Henry Taylor]], both midlevel government economists; [[Duncan Lee]], formerly with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS); and Abe Brothman, a private-sector chemist who worked on defense projects. As noted above, in October 1948, William Remington sued Bentley and NBC for libel. In hopes of discrediting her, Remington's attorneys hired private detectives to look into her past. They produced  evidence of her alcoholism, periods of severe depression, and a suicide attempt while a student in Florence; they alleged that her master's thesis had been written by someone else, and that, by the standards of the day, she had been sexually promiscuous since her college days. Bentley declined to testify at a Remington loyalty board hearing, and NBC settled the libel case out of court for $10,000.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nBentley testified in the trials of four accused spies: The [[perjury]] trial of William Remington, a case against Abe Brothman for [[obstruction of justice]], and [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] trials on charges of conspiracy to commit espionage. Bentley was peripherally involved in the Rosenberg case.  She was used by the prosecution to develop two points: first, the actions of American Communists in becoming spies for the Soviet Union; and second, to establish, if only vaguely in the jury's mind, a connection between Julius Rosenberg and Golos. She testified that she would receive calls from a man who identified himself as Julius, after which Golos would go out to meet him.\n\nAfter defecting to US authorities, Bentley's personal life became increasingly tumultuous. She continued to drink heavily, was involved in car accidents, and had a relationship with a man who beat her severely. She avoided subpoenas on a number of occasions. These incidents, along with generally erratic behavior, resulted in her FBI handlers worrying that she was \"bordering on some mental pitfall\".<ref>\n{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=161}}</ref>\n\nBut she was invariably calm and professional on the witness stand, earning praise from the prosecutors whose cases she was supporting. As Bentley repeatedly testified before grand juries, congressional committees and jury trials, however, she refined and embellished some details of her story. Information passed to her about a process for manufacturing synthetic rubber that was originally \"vague\" and \"probably of no value\" became \"super-secret\" and \"an extremely complicated thing.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|pp=102, 163}}</ref>  She would also assert that her espionage gave her advance notice of the [[Doolittle raid]] on Japan and the [[Normandy Landings|D-Day]] invasions of France, both claims that appeared to have been exaggerated.<ref>{{Harvnb|Olmsted|2002|p=195}}</ref>\n\n====William Remington====\n\nRemington's first trial began in late December 1950. [[Roy Cohn]], later to become famous as chief counsel for Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] on HUAC and already a noted anti-communist, joined the prosecution's legal team. Bentley later supplied a wealth of detail about Remington's involvement with her and the espionage conspiracy. Remington's defense was that he had never handled any classified material, hence could not have given any to Bentley. \n\nBut she remembered all the facts about the rubber-from-garbage invention: \n<blockquote>\"We had searched through the archives and discovered the files on the process. We also found the aircraft schedules, which were set up exactly as she said, and inter office memos and tables of personnel which proved Remington had access to both these items. We also discovered Remington's application for a naval commission in which he specifically pointed out that he was, in his present position with the Commerce Department, entrusted with secret military information involving airplanes, armaments, radar, and the Manhattan Project (the atomic bomb).\" <ref>Roy Cohn, ''McCarthy'' (1968) page 38</ref></blockquote>\n\nDuring the trial eleven witnesses claimed they knew Remington to be a communist. This included Bentley; ex-wife Ann Remington; Professor Howard Bridgeman of [[Tufts University]]; Kenneth McConnell, a Communist organizer in Knoxville; Rudolph Bertram and Christine Benson, who worked with him at the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]; and [[Paul Crouch (activist)|Paul Crouch]], who provided him with copies of the southern edition of the communist newspaper, ''[[The Daily Worker]].''<ref>[http://spartacus-educational.com/William_Remington.htm William Remington]</ref>\n\n==== Occupation currency plates ====\n\nBentley also testified that [[Harry Dexter White]] was responsible for passing Treasury plates for printing Allied currency in Occupied Germany to the Soviet Union, which used them to print millions of [[German mark|marks]].<ref>\n{{Cite journal\n  | last = Van Hook\n  | first = James C. \n  | author-link = \n  | author2-link = \n  | title = Review of ''Treasonable Doubt: The Harry Dexter White Spy Case''\n  | journal = Studies in Intelligence\n  | year = 2005\n  | volume = 49\n  | issue = 1\n  | edition = \n  | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol49no1/html_files/harry_dexter_8.html\n  | ref = harv\n  | postscript = <!--None-->\n  }}</ref>\nRussian soldiers exchanged these marks for goods and hard currency.

Reporters and historians were divided for decades as to the validity of her allegations.  In the 1990s, declassification of both Soviet documents and the U.S. codebreaking [[Venona project]] lent some credence to Bentley's allegations. After she defected, the Soviet Union temporarily suspended espionage activities in the United States. But some of Bentley's claims remain controversial due to questions about the accuracy of translations and the vague nature of identities, given that agents were identified by code names in encrypted records captured in Venona. \n\n==See also==\n* [[Jacob Golos]]\n* [[Nathan Gregory Silvermaster]]\n* [[Victor Perlo]]\n* [[Perlo group]]\n* [[Harry Dexter White]]\n* [[Whittaker Chambers]]\n* [[Ware group]]\n* [[Igor Gouzenko]]\n* [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]\n* [[Devin-Adair Publishing Company]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{refbegin}}\n\n===Biographies===\n\nCurrently, two biographies of Elizabeth Bentley have been published:\n\n*{{Cite book\n | last1=Olmsted \n | first=Kathryn S. \n | title=Red Spy Queen: A Biography of Elizabeth Bentley \n | publisher=The University of North Carolina Press\n | place= \n | year=2002\n | isbn = 0-8078-2739-8 \n | ref=harv \n | postscript=<!--None--> \n}}\n*{{Cite book |last1      = Kessler\n |first      = Lauren\n |authorlink = Lauren Kessler\n |title      = Clever Girl: Elizabeth Bentley, the Spy Who Ushered in the McCarthy Era\n |publisher  = Harper Perennial\n |place      = \n |year       = 2003\n |isbn       = 0-06-095973-8\n |ref        = harv\n |postscript = <!--None-->\n |url-access = registration\n |url        = https://archive.org/details/clevergirlelizab0000kess\n}}\n\n===Other references===\n*{{Cite book\n | last=Bentley\n | first=Elizabeth\n | url=https://books.google.com/?id=yz41AAAAIAAJ&q\n | title=Out of Bondage \n | publisher=Devin-Adair Publishing Company\n | place= \n | year=1951\n | isbn=0-8041-0164-7 \n | pages=326 \n | ref=harv}}\n*  {{Cite book\n |last=Chambers \n |first=Whittaker \n |title=Witness \n |authorlink = Whittaker Chambers\n |publisher=Random House \n |year=1952 \n |location=New York \n |pages=339 \n |id= \n |isbn=978-0-8488-0958-4 \n|lccn=52005149 \n }}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Craig\n  | first = R.

During [[World War II]] in Europe he served as personal [[adjutant]] to [[Heinrich Himmler]], the head of the SS, between September 1939 and September/October 1941, and thereafter as a [[Waffen-SS]] commander.\n\nDuring his career with Himmler Peiper witnessed the SS policies of [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[genocide]] in Eastern Europe; he persistently denied or obfuscated this fact following the war. Transferred to a combat role, Peiper served in the [[SS Division Leibstandarte]] on both the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern]] and the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]]s, commanding a battalion and then a regiment. He fought in the [[Third Battle of Kharkov]] and the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. Peiper's command became known for atrocities against civilians and prisoners of war.\n\nPeiper was convicted in the [[Malmedy massacre trial]] and sentenced to death. The sentence was commuted, with Peiper serving 12 years in prison. He was accused of committing the [[Boves massacre]] in Italy; the investigation was closed due to insufficient evidence that Peiper issued the order to kill civilians directly. After his release from prison, he worked for both [[Porsche]] and [[Volkswagen]], before moving to [[France]], where he worked as a freelance translator. Throughout, Peiper maintained frequent, albeit discreet, contact with his SS network, including [[HIAG]], a Waffen-SS lobby group. Peiper was murdered in France in July 1976, after his identity as an [[SS-man]] and war criminal had been publicized there.\n\nA daring combat leader, Peiper achieved cult status among those who [[Waffen-SS in popular culture| romanticize the Waffen-SS]].{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=111}} With his good looks and a multitude of awards, Peiper came to represent the image of the daring Panzer divisions.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=15\u201316}} The admiration continues to the 2010s, with the official Facebook account of the [[US Department of Defense]] featuring a glamorized picture of Peiper to commemorate the 2019 anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge.<ref name=Nytimes2019-12-17/><ref name=Wapo2019-12-17/><ref name=MashViral2019-12-17/> In fact, Peiper was an embodiment of the Nazi ideology and an egocentric, ruthless commander who ignored his own losses and created a culture within his unit where war crimes were not only tolerated but expected.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=13}}\n\n==Early life==\nPeiper was born on 30 January 1915 into a middle-class family from the [[Silesia]]n region of Germany. His father, Waldemar Peiper, served in the [[Imperial German Army]] and fought in the colonial campaigns in [[German East Africa]].{{sfn|Weingartner|2004|pp=21\u201322}} In 1915, he retired from active duty for health reasons. After the war, Waldemar Peiper joined the paramilitary ''[[Freikorps]]'' and took part in the [[Silesian Uprisings]].{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=15\u201316}} With the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] in Germany, he evolved into a dedicated National Socialist and an [[Antisemitism|antisemite]].{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=35}}\n\nIn 1926, Peiper followed his older brother Horst (born 1912) and joined the [[Scouting|Scouting movement]], developing an interest in a military career.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=16}} Horst joined the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and served in the [[SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde|SS concentration camp guard]]. Transferred to a combat role, Horst participated in the [[Battle of France]] with the [[SS Division Totenkopf]]. He died in June 1941 in Poland in an accident that was never officially explained. Rumor had it that Horst was gay and was forced to commit suicide by others in his unit.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=40}} His eldest brother, Hans Hasso (born 1910), suffered from mental issues and unsuccessfully attempted suicide while in high school; in a permanent vegetative state, he was placed in an institution in 1931.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=8}}\n\n==SS career pre-World War II==\nWhen Peiper turned 18, he joined the [[Hitler Youth]] with his brother Horst.{{sfn|Weingartner|2004|pp=18, 21\u201322}}  In October 1933, Peiper volunteered for the SS and joined the Cavalry SS. His first superior was [[Gustav Lombard]], a Nazi zealot, antisemite, and later a regimental commander in the notorious [[SS Cavalry Brigade]] that murdered tens of thousands of Jews in the occupied Soviet Union.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nOn 23 January 1934, Peiper received the rank of the ''[[SS-Mann]]'' under number 132.496. This made him a member of the SS even before it emerged from the shadow of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) as an independent organization within the Nazi Party in the aftermath of the SA purge known as the [[Night of the Long Knives]]. During the 1934 [[Nuremberg Rally]], Peiper was promoted to SS-''[[Sturmmann]]'' and attracted the attention of [[Heinrich Himmler]].{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=20}} For Himmler, Peiper was likely the embodiment of the [[Aryanism|SS concept of the \"Aryan race\"]]; although not as tall and muscular as other SS recruits, Peiper made up for this with handsome features and self-confidence.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nFrom January 1935 onward, Peiper was on the SS payroll and was sent to attend a leadership course of the [[Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler]] (LSSAH, Hitler's personal bodyguard unit).{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=21}} He received a favorable review from his SS instructors but only a conditional approval in the psychological evaluation conducted by German military doctors. They noted Peiper's egocentricity, negative attitude, and attempts to impress the evaluators with his connection to Himmler. The doctors concluded that Peiper might turn into a \"difficult subordinate\" or an \"arrogant superior\".{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nPeiper later attended an [[SS-Junker School]] (SS officer training camp) in [[Braunschweig]] that, under the direction of [[Paul Hausser]], prepared future SS leaders.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=25}} In addition to military training, the courses aimed to instill a proper ideological worldview, with antisemitism being the main tenet. Instructors such as [[Matthias Kleinheisterkamp]] (an army has-been and alcoholic), or future war criminals, such as {{illm|Franz Magill|de|Franz Magill}} of the notorious SS Cavalry Brigade were of questionable competence. Peiper attended from 24 April 1935 to 30 March 1936 and was then posted to the LSSAH.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=14\u201317}} On 1 March 1938, Peiper received his Nazi Party membership card with the number 5.508.134. After the war he tried to deny, or at least obfuscate, his membership in the party, as it was inconsistent with the image that he had constructed for himself as being \"merely a soldier\". {{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=35}}\n\nPeiper remained with the LSSAH until June 1938{{sfn|Weingartner|2004|pp=21\u201322}} when he was appointed an [[adjutant]] to Heinrich Himmler, a step that Himmler considered necessary in the career path of an SS leader with promising potential. At that time, [[Personal Staff Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS|Himmler's personal staff]] was under the command of [[Karl Wolff]].{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=33, 182\u2013186}} Peiper worked in Himmler's anteroom in the [[SS Main Office]] on [[Prinz-Albrecht-Stra\u00dfe]] in Berlin. He became one of Himmler's favourite adjutants; Peiper admired him in return. Although after the war people from Himmler's inner circle, including Karl Wolff, tried to minimise the role of Himmler's adjutants, the role was far from inconsequential: the longer they stayed in Himmler's service, the more they gained influence and political connections.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=37}} By 1939, Peiper was quickly becoming Himmler's closest aid and accompanied him on all official functions and assisted his every move.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=36\u201337}}\n\nIn 1938, Peiper met and began courting Sigurd Hinrichsen, a secretary on Himmler's personal staff who was friends with both [[Lina Heydrich]] ([[Reinhard Heydrich]]'s wife) and Himmler's secretary [[Hedwig Potthast]], later to be Himmler's mistress.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=28\u201329}} On 26 June 1939, he married Sigurd in an SS ceremony. Himmler was the guest of honor at the wedding and delivered a short toast.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=33\u201334}} The couple lived in Berlin until the first [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|allied air raids]] on the city, when Sigurd was sent to [[Rottach-Egern]], [[Upper Bavaria]], near Himmler's second residence.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=39}} The couple later had three children.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=185}}\n\n==Himmler's adjutant during World War II==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Weill-060-13, Metz, Heinrich Himmler.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sepp Dietrich]] (left), Himmler, and Peiper (right) at [[Metz]], September 1940]]\n\n===Invasions of Poland and France===\nOn 1 September 1939, Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]]. Peiper joined Himmler on board his special train and, on occasion, acted as his liaison to [[Adolf Hitler]], travelling with [[Erwin Rommel]] to accompany Hitler as he met with Wehrmacht generals near the front.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=40\u201341}} Peiper was with Himmler on 20 September in [[Bydgoszcz]] (Bromberg) when they witnessed the execution of 20&nbsp;Poles organized by the leader of the local [[Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz]] and SS functionary, [[Ludolf von Alvensleben]].{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=41}}{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=47}} As Peiper later told [[Ernst Sch\u00e4fer]], Hitler had ordered Himmler to eliminate \"Polish intellectuals\".{{sfn|Breitman, Goda et al. 2005|p=119}}\n\nAfter Poland was defeated, Peiper witnessed the developing SS policies of deportations and ethnic cleansing of the Polish population.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=42\u201343}} On 13 December 1939, Peiper and Himmler witnessed the gassing of residents of a psychiatric facility in [[Owi\u0144ska]] near [[Pozna\u0144]]. In post-war interrogations, Peiper described the experience in a detached, factual manner:\n<blockquote>The action [gassing] was done before a circle of invited guests. ... The insane were lead into a prepared casemate the door of which had a Plexiglas window. After the door was closed, one could see how, in the beginning, the insane still laughed and talked to each other. But, soon they sat down on the straw, obviously under the influence of the gas. ... Very soon, they no longer moved.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=46}} </blockquote>\n\nIn the winter of 1940, Peiper accompanied Himmler on a tour of [[Nazi concentration camps]], including [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]] and [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]], with a trip to Poland to meet with [[Friedrich-Wilhelm Kr\u00fcger]], [[Higher SS and Police Leader]] in occupied Poland, and his subordinate [[Odilo Globocnik]]. The latter was tasked with deporting Jews from Polish territories annexed to Germany to Warsaw and Lublin.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=46}} The tour continued in April 1940, with visits to [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] and [[Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp]]s, followed by a visit to Poland to meet with SS and Police Leader [[Wilhelm Rediess]] and the SS official [[Otto Rasch]] to discuss how further \"evacuations\" (i.e. shootings of civilian population) could be efficiently accomplished. In early May, Himmler, accompanied by Peiper, discussed with Odilo Globocnik, the SS and Police Leader in Lublin, the [[Aktion T4|mass murder of the disabled]]. Peiper also learned about Globocnik's work on the [[Lublin Reservation]].{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=54\u201356}}\n\nIn May 1940, Peiper accompanied Himmler as he followed [[Waffen-SS]] troops during the Battle of France. On 18 May, Peiper obtained permission to join a combat unit and became a platoon leader within the LSSAH. After seizing an artillery battery on the hills of Wattenberg, Peiper was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd class and promoted to SS-''[[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]]''.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=58}} For an audacious attack on 19 June, Peiper, now a company commander, received the Iron Cross 1st class.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=61}} As further remuneration, Peiper brought back a sports car from France for personal use; the car was added to the inventory of Himmler's staff on the latter's decree.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=62\u201363}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L15327, Spanien, Heinrich Himmler bei Franco.jpg|thumb|[[Karl Wolff]], Peiper and Himmler are received by [[Francisco Franco]], Spain, October 1940.]]\nPeiper returned to his duties as Himmler's adjutant on 21 June 1940.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=46}} On 7 September, Himmler addressed the LSSAH leaders to thank them for the help in expelling Jews from [[Alsace]] in eastern France. He referred to expulsions and massacres perpetrated in Poland, stating: \"We had to have the toughness\u2014this should be said and soon forgotten\u2014to shoot thousands of leading Poles\". He stressed the so-called difficulty of \"carrying out executions\", \"hauling away people\", or \"evicting crying and hysterical women\".{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=67\u201368}} Following a visit to [[Fascist Spain]] to meet its dictator [[Francisco Franco]], Peiper was officially promoted to the position of First Adjutant on 1 November.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=70}}\n\n===Invasion of the Soviet Union===\nIn February 1941, Himmler told Peiper about the German plan to invade the [[Soviet Union]], [[Operation Barbarossa]]. The following months were devoted to the preparation of the SS for this war. Thus, Himmler and his staff travelled to Norway, Austria, Poland, and Greece. The trip included a visit to the [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a ghetto]], about which Peiper wrote: \"It was a macabre image: we saw how the Jewish Ghetto police, who wore hats without rims and were armed with wooden clubs, inconsiderately made room for us\". This episode shows that Peiper was perfectly able to remember the details of the criminal process without forgetting anecdotes intended to prove that Jews were hitting other Jews which, by comparison, was supposed to reduce his own complicity.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=49\u201350}}&nbsp;\n\nFrom 11 to 15 June, Peiper was present for the SS conference where Himmler spoke of the plans to eliminate 30 million Slavic people. The event had brought together senior SS and police commanders who were to become [[SS and Police Leaders]] in the occupied Soviet Union. Also present were Karl Wolff; [[Kurt Daluege]], head of the [[Order Police]]; [[Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski]], future Higher SS and Police Leader in occupied [[Belarus]]; and Reinhard Heydrich, head of the [[Reich Security Main Office]].{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=72-73}} When the invasion began on 22 June 1941, Himmler transferred his headquarters to a special train and embarked on a tour of newly conquered territories with Peiper and other staff. Peiper accompanied Himmler on field inspections of various murder units. In [[August\u00f3w]], they were informed by the commander of the {{illm|Einsatzkommando Tilsit|de|Einsatzkommando Tilsit}} about the shooting of 200 people, while in [[Grodno]] Heydrich, in their presence, berated the local death squad leader for having shot only 96 Jews on that day.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=76-77}}&nbsp;\n\nIn July, Peiper and Himmler were in [[Bia\u0142ystok]] where they reviewed the progress achieved by the [[Order Police battalions]] and met again with Bach-Zalewski. Himmler informed him about the arrival of the units of the ''[[Kommandostab Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' (Himmler's Command Staff), half of whom would assist Bach-Zalewski in his area of command.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=78}} The recently created body supervised Waffen-SS formations set up for Himmler's racial and ideological war.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=52}} These formations included two motorized SS Infantry Brigades ([[1st SS Infantry Brigade|1st]] and [[2nd SS Infantry Brigade|2nd]]) and two SS Cavalry Regiments combined into the SS Cavalry Brigade, totalling about 25,000 Waffen-SS troops.{{sfn|Browning|2002|p=233}} The individual units were subordinated to local Higher SS and Police Leaders and used in the murder of Jews and other \"undesirables\", in addition to providing rear area security. In the former function, the units' activities were indistinguishable from the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and the Order Police battalions.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|2002|pp=92\u201393}}&nbsp;\n\nThe reports of the ''Kommandostab'' units were received daily, and it was Peiper's role to present them to Himmler every morning.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=52}} For example, the 30 July report from Gustav Lombard's SS cavalry regiment announced that 800 Jews including women and children had been shot. On 11 August, Lombard reported the total number of shot \"looters\" (a code word for the Jews) was 6,526. As the first adjutant, Peiper's job included providing Himmler with the murder statistics from the ''Einsatzgruppen'' units each morning.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=61\u201362}} The daily briefing included a review of operations; one surviving map shows a \"cleansing action\" (shooting) by the SS Cavalry Brigade. Peiper and [[Werner Grothmann]], Second Adjutant, were aware of all incoming communications; all of Himmler's orders passed through their hands.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=79, 348}}\n\nPeiper's role beside Himmler gradually came to an end beginning in the late summer of 1941.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=62}} Himmler transferred Peiper's duties as the first adjutant to his successor Werner  Grothmann. Although no longer Himmler's official First Adjutant, Peiper continued to update his appointment diary until mid-September 1941. During the transition time, Peiper likely served as Himmler's observer to LSSAH. Available records show that Peiper formally transferred to the LSSAH in early October 1941.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=62}} Peiper remained in close contact with Himmler as shown by their ongoing correspondence through to the end of the war; Himmler addressed Peiper as \"my dear Jochen\".{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=52}}\n\n==With SS Division Leibstandarte==\nWhen Peiper rejoined the LSSAH, it was engaged on the Eastern Front near the [[Black Sea]]. An injury to a unit commander soon gave him an opportunity to take command of the 11th Company.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=85, 87}} It fought at [[Mariupol]] and [[Rostov-on-Don]]. Peiper was noted for his fighting spirit, although his unit suffered high casualties as a consequence of his aggressive tactics.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=63}} During its combat action, the LSSAH was followed by ''[[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe D]]'', with which the division shared winter quarters. [[Sepp Dietrich]], LSSAH's commander, volunteered his troops to assist with the murder operations by sealing [[Taganrog]] and delivering Jews, Roma, and others to the death squads; the massacre of roughly 1,800 people took place on 29 October in the [[Gully of Petrushino]].{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=88}}&nbsp;\n\nIn May 1942, the LSSAH was transferred to France for rest and refit.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=65}} En route to France, Peiper left his unit and met with Himmler at his headquarters on 1 June. In July 1942, Peiper again met with Himmler and did not rejoin his unit until August 1942.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=66}} During its stay in France, the LSSAH was reorganised into a ''[[Panzergrenadier]]'' (mechanized infantry) division, and Peiper was promoted to command its 3rd Battalion.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=69}} Peiper continued to maintain a close relationship with Himmler, attending functions with high-ranking SS leaders. He even met with Himmler one-on-one.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=69}} \n\n===\"Blowtorch Battalion\"===\nMeanwhile, on the Eastern Front, the German situation had seriously worsened, especially in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. Peiper's battalion left France in January 1943 for the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=93}}&nbsp;During the [[Third Battle of Kharkov]], Peiper's battalion became known for an audacious rescue of the encircled 320th Infantry Division.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=94}} In a letter home, Peiper described hand-to-hand fighting with a Soviet ski battalion in an effort to lead the division, including its sick and wounded, to safety.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=74}} The rescue culminated with a fierce battle with the Soviet forces at the village of Krasnaya Polyana. Upon entering the village, Peiper's troops made a terrible discovery. All the men in his small rearguard medical detachment who had been left there had been killed and then mutilated. An SS sergeant in Peiper's ration supply company later stated that Peiper responded in kind: \"In the village, the two petrol trucks were burnt and 25 Germans killed by partisans and Soviet soldiers. As a revenge, Peiper ordered the burning down of the whole village and the shooting of its inhabitants\".{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=94}} (The testimony was obtained in November 1944 by the Western Allies.){{sfn|Parker|2014|p=356}}\n\nOn 6 May 1943, Peiper was awarded the [[German Cross in Gold]] for his achievements in February 1943 around Kharkov, where his unit gained the nickname the \"Blowtorch Battalion\". Reportedly, the nickname derived from the torching and slaughter of two Soviet villages where their inhabitants were either shot or burned.{{sfn|Arnold|1990|p=51}} Ukrainian sources, including surviving witness Ivan Kiselev, who was 14 at the time of the massacre, described the killings at the villages of Yefremovka and Semyonovka on 17 February 1943. On 12 February troops of the LSSAH occupied the two villages, where retreating Soviet forces had wounded two SS officers. In retaliation, five days later, LSSAH troops killed 872 men, women and children. Some 240 of these were burned alive in the church of Yefremovka.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=356\u2013357}} In August 1944, when an SS commander, formerly of LSSAH, was captured south of Falaise in France and interrogated by the Allies, he stated that Peiper was \"particularly eager to execute the order to burn villages\".{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=354}} Peiper wrote to Potthast in March 1943: \"Our reputation precedes us as a wave of terror and is one of our best weapons. Even old [[Genghis Khan]] would gladly have hired us as assistants.\"{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=94-95}}\n\n===In Nazi propaganda===\nOn 9 March 1943, Peiper was awarded Germany's highest decoration, the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]]. Himmler sent personal congratulations over the radio: \"Heartfelt congratulations for the Knight's Cross my dear Jochen! I am proud of you!\"{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=96}} During this period, [[Nazi propaganda]] praised Peiper as an outstanding leader. The official SS newspaper ''[[Das Schwarze Korps]]'' (\"The Black Corps\") described Peiper's actions in Kharkov in glowing terms such as \"the master of the situation in all its phases\" and extolled Peiper's \"quick decision making\", \"caring\" attitude and \"bold and unorthodox orders\". The paper emphasized that he was \"a born leader, one filled with the highest sense of responsibility for the life of every single one of his men, but who [was] also able to be hard if necessary\".{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nThe descriptions of his tactical skills propelled Peiper to become an icon of the Waffen-SS after the war, with former battalion members describing him in glowing terms.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=76}} Peiper was seen as an officer who obeyed orders without much discussion and expected the same from his men.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=74\u201377}} In July 1943, the LSSAH took part in [[Operation Citadel]] in the area of [[Kursk]], with Peiper's unit distinguishing itself in the fighting.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=80}} After the failure of the operation, the LSSAH was withdrawn from the Eastern Front and transferred to [[Northern Italy]].{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=102}}\n\n==Operations in Italy and the Boves massacre==\n{{Main|Boves massacre}}\nAfter Italian forces capitulated to the Allies, the LSSAH was moved to Italy for two months to participate in [[Operation Achse]], the disarming of the Italian military. Beginning in August, Peiper's battalion was stationed near [[Cuneo]].{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=83}} On 19 September, [[Italian partisans]] captured two of Peiper's men in the vicinity of [[Boves, Piedmont]].{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=143}} An attempt to free the German prisoners by a company of the LSSAH failed, resulting in one dead on each side and a number of German soldiers wounded. After this, Peiper and his unit were called in to free the German soldiers and took up positions in Boves, controlling access to the town. They threatened to destroy the town and its inhabitants should their demands not be met. Peiper committed to sparing the town if the German soldiers were freed.{{sfn|Schreiber|1996|pp=130}}\n\nThe [[parish priest]] of Boves, don Giuseppe Bernardi, and local industrialist Alessandro Vassallo, who had acted as negotiators between Peiper and the Italian soldiers and partisans, successfully secured the release of the prisoners and the return of the body of the killed SS trooper.{{sfn|Schreiber|1996|pp=132}} As Peiper's unit was withdrawing, violence erupted in the village. There were 24 victims; all were males, with the except for one woman who died of smoke inhalation in her home after it was set on fire by looting SS men. At least seventeen were murdered in cold blood, rather than in a battle. Most, especially those killed near the cemetery, were of non-military age and were found shot by small arms fire. LSSAH glibly reported that \"during the fights [with partisans] the villages of Boves and Costellar were burned down. In nearly all burning houses ammunition exploded. Some bandits were shot.\"{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=142}}\n\n==Return to the Eastern Front==\nBeginning in November 1943, Peiper's unit arrived on the Eastern Front, where it took part in combat in the area of [[Zhytomyr]]. Peiper was soon appointed commander of the 1st SS Panzer Regiment after its previous leader had been killed in action, yet he had no experience leading tanks.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=104}} The December fighting earned Peiper another award nomination. His personal record in support of the nomination stated that, from 5 to 7 of December, Peiper's regiment eliminated several Soviet artillery batteries, destroyed a divisional headquarters, and killed 2,280 \"Russians\", with only three taken prisoner. During the action at the village of {{illm|Pekartchina|ru|\u041f\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430}}, Peiper \"attacked with all weapons and flame-throwers from his SPW [armored fighting vehicle]\". The village was burned to the ground and \"completely destroyed\".{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=105, 359}} \n\nPeiper's command style, aggressive and without regard for casualties, reached its limits. Headlong attacks without proper recognisance lead to heavy losses in men and materiel.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=87-93}} After one month, Peiper's Panzer regiment was reduced to twelve still-operational tanks.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=92}} In late December, he was ordered to the divisional staff; with so few operational tanks, his command of the regiment was no longer needed. The remnants of the unit were taken over by another officer on 22 December. On 20 January 1944, Peiper left his unit and went to Hitler's headquarters. Hitler presented him with a new award, the Oak Leaves to be added to his Knight's Cross. Peiper was physically and mentally exhausted. A medical examination concluded that he needed rest. Peiper went on a long leave with his family in [[Bavaria]].{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=92\u201393}}\n\n==Battle of Normandy==\nIn March 1944, the LSSAH was withdrawn from the Eastern Front and sent to be reformed in Belgium. New recruits, many of whom were teenagers, had little in common with fanatical SS volunteers of years past. The recruits underwent brutal training; five were sentenced to death for shirking their duties. Peiper gave the command to the executioners and later had recruits march past the bodies. In 1956, he was investigated by German authorities in connection with this event; Peiper denied everything, and the case was closed in 1966.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=95}}\n\nAs the Allied [[Operation Overlord]] began, LSSAH was moved closer to the Channel Coast, in anticipation of the \"real\" invasion at [[Pais de Calais]]. Transportation was limited, and the Allies had near-total air superiority.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=97}} Thus, Peiper's regiment only saw action from 18 July. Peiper was rarely in the frontline command, due to the terrain and the need to maintain radio silence.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=101}} As with the other German units in the area, they fought a defensive battle, until the German front began to collapse following Allied [[Operation Cobra]]. Having gone to the front with 19,618 men, the LSSAH lost 25% of its men and all of its tanks.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=95\u2013101}}\n\nPeiper was not in command of his Panzer regiment during [[Operation Luttich]], the failed counter-attacks near [[Avranches]]. Suffering from a nervous breakdown, he was relieved of command on 2 August and dispatched to the rear. From September 1944 forward, he was in a military hospital in Upper Bavaria, not far from his family. He was discharged on 7 October.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\n==Battle of the Bulge==\nDuring the autumn, German forces had to counter the attempts of the Western Allies to cross the [[Westwall]], while Hitler was looking for an opportunity to seize the initiative on the Western Front.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=105}} The result was [[Operation Wacht am Rhein]] (Battle of the Bulge). In a desperate attempt to defeat the Allies on the Western Front, the German armies were to break through the U.S. lines in the [[Ardennes]], cross the [[River Meuse]] and take [[Antwerp]], cutting the Allied forces in two.{{sfn|MacDonald|2002|p=17ff}}\n\nThe main role in the breakthrough was devoted to the [[6th SS Panzer Army]] under the command of Sepp Dietrich. It was to pierce the American lines between [[Aachen]] and the [[Schnee Eifel]] and seize bridges on the Meuse on both sides of [[Li\u00e8ge]]. Within the 6th Panzer Army, a mobile strike role was assigned to the LSSAH, then under the command of SS-''[[Oberf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Wilhelm Mohnke]]. The division was split into four combined-arms battle groups with Peiper commanding the most substantial, which included all armored sections of the division. Peiper also received the [[501st Heavy Panzer Battalion]] with the new 70 ton [[Tiger II]] (King Tigers). His battle group was to take bridges on the Meuse between Li\u00e8ge and [[Huy]]. To address the lack of fuel, Peiper was provided with a map showing American fuel depots, to allow him to seize fuel there if needed.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\n===Advance===\n[[File:BaugnezCrossroads1.JPG|thumb|The route followed by Peiper's battle group. The crossroads of [[Baugnez]] where the [[Malmedy massacre]] occurred is marked by a black circle.]]\nPeiper's assigned route included narrow, and in many places, single-track roads which forced units of the ''Kampfgruppe'' to tail each other, creating a column of infantry and armor up to {{convert|25|km}} long. Peiper complained that the road assigned to his ''Kampfgruppe'' was suitable for bicycles, but not for tanks.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=108}} [[Fritz Kr\u00e4mer]], chief of staff for the 6th Panzer Army responded, \"I don't care how and what you do. Just make it to the Meuse.

In the early morning of 17 December, they captured Honsfeld and much-needed fuel. Peiper continued west on his assigned route until he had to deflect shortly before {{illm|Ligneuville|fr|Ligneuville}} because the assigned road was impassable. This bypass forced him towards the Baugnez crossroads near [[Malmedy]].{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=113\u2013114}}\n\n===Malmedy and other atrocities===\n<!---[[File:Bodies of U.S. officers and soldiers slained by the Nazis after capture near Malmedy, Belgium. - NARA - 196544.jpg|thumb|right|The bodies of American [[POW]]s were found on 14 January 1945.]]--->\n[[File:\"Body_of_American_soldier_is_borne_on_stretcher_from_terrain_in_vicinity_of_Malmedy,_Belgium,_where_on_or_about_17_Decem_-_NARA_-_532956.tif|thumb|Aftermath of the [[Malmedy massacre]].

The troops, mainly elements of the American [[285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion]], were quickly overcome and captured.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=114}} Along with other American POWs captured earlier, they were ordered to stand in a meadow before the Germans opened fire on them with machine guns, killing 84 soldiers, and leaving the bodies in the snow. The survivors were able to reach American lines later that day, and their story spread rapidly throughout the American front lines.{{cn|date=December 2019}}  \n\nThe atrocities continued. In [[Buttingen|Honsfeld]], Peiper's men murdered several American prisoners.{{sfn|MacDonald|2002}}{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=113}} Other murders of POWs and civilians were reported in [[B\u00fcllingen]],{{sfn|MacDonald|2002}} Ligneuville and [[Stavelot]],{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=115}} Cheneux, [[La Gleize]], and [[Stoumont]] on 17, 18, 19 and 20 December.{{cn|date=December 2019}} On 19 December 1944, in the area between Stavelot and [[Trois-Ponts]], while the Germans were trying to regain control of the bridge over the [[Ambl\u00e8ve River]], (crucial for allowing reinforcements and supplies to reach them) men of ''Kampfgruppe'' Peiper killed a number of Belgian civilians. The battle group was eventually declared responsible for the deaths of 362 prisoners of war and 111 civilians.{{sfn|MacDonald|2002}}\n\n===Stall and retreat===\nMoving ahead, Peiper crossed Ligneuville and reached the heights of Stavelot on the left bank of the Ambl\u00e8ve River at nightfall of the second day of the operation. The battle group paused for the night, allowing Americans to reorganise. After heavy fighting, Peiper's armor crossed the bridge on the Ambl\u00e8ve. The spearhead continued on, without having fully secured Stavelot. By then, the surprise factor had been lost. The U.S. forces regrouped and blew up several bridges ahead of Peiper's advance, trapping the battle group in the deep valley of the Ambl\u00e8ve, downstream from Trois-Ponts. The weather also improved, permitting the Allied air forces to operate. The U.S. airstrikes destroyed or heavily damaged numerous German vehicles. Peiper's command was in disarray: some units had lost their way among difficult terrain or in the dark, while company commanders preferred to stay with Peiper at the head of the column and thus were unable to provide guidance to their own units.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=115\u2013116}} \n\nPeiper attacked Stoumont on 19 December and took the town amid heavy fighting. He was unable to protect his rear, which enabled American troops to cut him off from the only possible supply road for ammunition and fuel at Stavelot.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=117}} Without supplies, and with no contact with other German units behind him, Peiper could advance no further. American attacks on Stoumont forced the remnants of the battle group to retreat to La Gleize. On 24 December, Peiper abandoned his vehicles and retreated with the remaining men. German wounded and American prisoners were also left behind.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=118\u2013119}} According to Peiper, 717 men returned to the German lines out of 3,000 at the beginning of the operation.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=113}} \n\nDespite the failure of Peiper's battle group and the loss of all tanks, Wilhelm Mohnke, LSSAH's commander, recommended Peiper for a further award. The events at the Baugnez crossroads were described in glowing terms:{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=111\u2013112}} \n\n<blockquote>Without regard for threats from the flanks and only inspired by the thought of a deep breakthrough, the Kampfgruppe proceeded&nbsp;... to Ligneuville and destroyed at Baugnez an enemy supply column and after annihilation of the units blocking their advance, succeeded in causing the staff of the 49th Anti-Aircraft Brigade to flee.</blockquote> \n\nRather than a stain on Peiper's honour, the killing of POWs was celebrated in official records.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=112}} In January 1945, the Swords were added to his Knight's Cross. The great fame of Peiper as a Waffen-SS commander during the [[Battle of the Bulge]] was born.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\n==End of the war==\nOn 4 February, Peiper met for the last time with Himmler at his provisional headquarters. His unit took part in [[Operation Spring Awakening]], which failed. Although Peiper's unit inflicted a large number of casualties, due to his aggressive style of command he lost many men.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=132}} On 1 May, as LSSAH was forced into Austria, the men were informed of [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler's death]]. On 8 May, the LSSAH received the order to cross the [[Enns (river)|Enns]]  and surrender to the American troops.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=133}} Instead of surrendering, Peiper chose to treck home. He was apprehended on 22 May by American troops.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=134}}\n\nThrough July 1945, Peiper was held in a POW camp in Bavaria with about 500 other German soldiers and SS men.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=130}} As an unofficial leader of the group, Peiper came to the attention of the commander of the camp,{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=132\u2013133}} and then of higher command. When asked about the plight of Poles and Jews, Peiper reportedly responded: \"All the Jews are bad and all Poles are bad. We have just cleansed our society and moved these people into camps and you let them loose!\" Peiper also lamented that the Americans refused to incorporate the SS into its army to \"prepare to fight the Russians\".{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=135\u2013136}} \n\nMeanwhile, an active investigation into the Malmedy massacre was launched at the end of June 1945 by American war crimes investigators.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=137}} Crimes during the Battle of the Bulge were attributed to ''Kampfgruppe'' Peiper, resulting in American investigative teams searching POW camps for its men.{{sfn|MacDonald|2002}} Peiper topped the list of alleged perpetrators but was difficult to locate due to an enormous number of prisoners (four million) and haphazard communications.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=138}} Peiper was finally identified as a Malmedy suspect on 21 August 1945, after a transfer to a much larger camp where his file came to the attention of its commander by chance. Peiper was immediately transferred to a military intelligence interrogation center in [[Freising]].{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=140}}\n\n==War crimes conviction==\n\n===Interrogation and trial===\nJailed in Freising, Upper Bavaria, Peiper underwent his first interrogations.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=157}} Investigators quickly found that the SS men, including Peiper, although hardened soldiers, were not trained to withstand interrogation.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=157}} Some men freely gave the requested information, while others only did so after having been allegedly subject to various forms of torture such as beatings, threats and mock executions.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=157}} Peiper took [[command responsibility]] for the actions of the men under his command. In December 1945, he was transferred to the prison at [[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]], where 1,000 former members of the LSSAH were assembled.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=157}} On 16 April 1946, approximately 300 prisoners were moved from Schw\u00e4bisch Hall to Dachau, where they were put on trial.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=157}}\n\n[[File:Malmedy 2 Joachim Peiper.jpg|thumbnail|Peiper at [[Malmedy massacre trial]]]]\nThe trial took place at Dachau from 16 May to 16 July 1946 before a [[military tribunal]]. The 74 defendants included Sepp Dietrich, commander of the [[6th Panzer Army|6th SS Panzer Army]], his chief of staff Fritz Kr\u00e4mer, [[Hermann Prie\u00df]], [[I SS Panzer Corps]] commander, and Peiper, commander of the 1st SS Panzer Regiment (the unit to which the crimes were attributed).{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=159}} The accusations were mainly based on the sworn and written statements provided by the defendants in Schw\u00e4bisch Hall. To counter the evidence given in the men's sworn statements and by prosecution witnesses, the lead defense attorney, [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lt. Colonel]] Willis M. Everett tried to show that the statements had been obtained by inappropriate methods.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=160\u2013165}}\n\nEverett called Lt. Colonel Hal McCown, commander of the 2nd Battalion, [[119th Infantry Regiment (United States)|119th Infantry Regiment]], to testify about Peiper's troops' treatment of American prisoners at La Gleize. McCown, who, along with his command, had been captured by Peiper on 21 December, testified that he had not seen any American prisoners mistreated by the SS.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=148}} It was noted by the prosecution that by the time McCown was captured on 21 December, Peiper was aware that his tactical situation had deteriorated substantially and that he and his men were in danger of becoming POWs themselves. On 17 December at Malmedy, Peiper's unit was advancing aggressively and still hoped to reach its objective, whereas by 21 December the unit found itself nearly cut off at La Gleize and out of fuel, having suffered over 80% casualties. Peiper's shifting attitude towards POWs was calculated, as he held Col. McCown and others as his unit fled La Gleize on foot, intending to use them as bargaining chips in the event of capture.{{sfn|Goldstein|1994|pp=167\u2013182}}\n\nEverett had decided to call only Peiper to testify. However, other defendants, supported by their German lawyers, wanted to testify as well. This would soon prove to be a huge mistake, for when the prosecution cross-examined the defendants, they behaved like \"a bunch of drowning rats (...) turning on each other.\"{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=160\u2013165}} According to Everett, these testimonies gave the court enough reason to sentence several of the defendants to death.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=160\u2013165}}\n\nThe military court was not convinced by Peiper's testimony about the murder of the POWs under his battle group's control.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=160\u2013165}} During the trial, several witnesses testified of at least two instances when Peiper had ordered the murder of prisoners of war.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=163}} When questioned by the prosecution, Peiper denied these allegations, stating that they were obtained from witnesses under torture.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=163\u2013164}} When questioned about the murder of Belgian civilians, Peiper said they were partisans.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=164}}\n\n===Death sentence===\nTogether with 42 other defendants, Joachim Peiper was sentenced to death by hanging on 16 July 1946. The sentences were automatically subject to review by the U.S. Army Review Board. In October 1947, the results were submitted, and many verdicts were subsequently changed. Starting in March 1948, sentences were further reviewed by General [[Lucius D. Clay]], commander-in-chief in Germany. Clay confirmed 12 death sentences, including Peiper's.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=171}} <!----commuted six more death sentences to life imprisonment. But he refused to commute the six remaining death sentences, including Peiper's, though the executions were postponed.---> \n<!----\nThe sentences generated significant controversy in some German circles, including among the clergy, leading the commander of the [[United States Army Europe|US Army in Germany]] to commute some of the death sentences to life imprisonment. In addition, the Germans' defense attorney, [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Army|US military attorney]] Lt. Col. Willis M. Everett, appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]], claiming that the defendants had been found guilty by means of \"illegal and fraudulently procured confessions\" and were subjects of mock trial.{{cn|date=December 2019}}--->\n\nThe turmoil raised by this case caused the [[Secretary of the Army]], [[Kenneth Royall]], to create a commission chaired by Judge Gordon A. Simpson of Texas to investigate. The commission was interested in the Malmedy massacre trial and in other cases judged at Dachau. The commission arrived in Europe on 30 July 1948 and issued its report on 14 September. In this report, it recommended that the twelve remaining death sentences be commuted to life imprisonment. The commission confirmed the accuracy of Everett's accusations regarding mock trials but neither disputed nor denied his charges of torture of the defendants. The commission expressed the opinion that the pre-trial investigation had not been properly conducted. Its members felt that no death sentence should be carried out where such a doubt existed.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe [[United States Senate]] launched its own investigations, which were opened in early 1950 by several Senate committees. One of them included [[Joseph McCarthy]] who prepared to launch his sensationalist career. Receiving encouragement and information from right-wing and anti-Semitic circles, McCarthy dominated the proceedings and grabbed headlines. He was probably encouraged by the right-wing judge, LeRoy van Roden, who saw the trials as a Jewish effort to take revenge on the Germans, and who had also served on the investigating commissions.{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=169}} The [[Senate Committee on Armed Services]] came to the conclusion of improper pre-trial procedures, including a mock trial, had indeed affected the trial process but not torture as sometimes stated. There was little or no doubt that some of the accused were indeed guilty of the massacre.<ref>Malmedy massacre Investigation&nbsp;\u2013 Report of the Subcommittee of Committee on armed services&nbsp;\u2013 United States Senate&nbsp;\u2013Eighty-first Congress, first session, pursuant to S. res. 42, Investigation of action of army with respect to trial of persons responsible for the massacre of American soldiers, Battle of the Bulge, near Malmedy, Belgium, December 1944, October 13, 1949</ref>\n\n===Release from prison===\n\nThe popular Wehrmacht ex-general [[Heinz Guderian]] actively campaigned for Peiper. He wrote to one of his subordinates in 1951:{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|pp=110\u2013111}}\n<blockquote>At the moment I'm negotiating with General Handy [Heidelberg] because [he] wants to hang the unfortunate Peiper. McCloy is powerless, because the Malmedy trial is being handled by Eucom, and is not subordinate to McCloy. As a result, I have decided to cable President Truman and ask him if he is familiar with this idiocy.</blockquote>\n\nUltimately, the sentences of the Malmedy defendants were commuted to life imprisonment and then to time served. Peiper's sentence was commuted to 35 years in 1954, and he was released in December 1956, the last of the Malmedy condemned to be freed.{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=169}}\n\nThe \"old boys' network\" of SS peers helped him to obtain his release from prison and secure employment. [[HIAG]], an organisation of former Waffen-SS men, had already helped Peiper's wife find a job near the [[Landsberg Prison]]. They then worked to achieve the conditional release of Peiper himself. Peiper had to prove he could obtain a job. Through an intermediary, Albert Prinzing, a former SS functionary in the [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SS security service), he got a job at the car manufacturer [[Porsche]].{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=176}}\n\n==Return to civilian life==\nFollowing his release from Landsberg Prison, Peiper was careful not to associate too closely with former Waffen-SS men and their organization, HIAG, at least publicly. Privately, however, he maintained contact with and was closely involved with many former SS members. In 1959, he attended the national meeting of the [[Association of Knight's Cross Recipients]]. Travelling with HIAG's official historian [[Walter Harzer]], he reunited with Sepp Dietrich and [[Heinz Lammerding]] at the closed-door meeting.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=212}} Peiper was often seen at the funerals of personalities such as [[Kurt Meyer]], Dietrich and Paul Hausser.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=182\u2013183}} He assisted the efforts of HIAG to rehabilitate the Waffen-SS by hiding its criminal aspects and exalting its combat achievements, claiming that the SS were just like other soldiers. Peiper once told one of his friends: \"I personally think that every attempt at rehabilitation during our lifetime is unrealistic, but one can still collect material.\"{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=182\u2013183}}\n\nOn 17 January 1957, Peiper began work at Porsche in [[Stuttgart]] in its technical division.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=176\u2013179}} As he advanced within Porsche, he was accused by Italian union workers of the [[Boves massacre]] in Italy during World War II. [[Ferry Porsche]] personally intervened and promised Peiper a senior management position, but the offer was derailed by the trade unions, who objected to convicted war criminals serving in the upper management of the company. The strong antipathy to Peiper, his association with Ferry Porsche, and the related negative effect on sales in Porsche's biggest market, the United States, forced Porsche's management to dismiss him.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=180\u2013181}} \n\nOn 30 December 1960, Peiper filed a suit against Porsche.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=180\u2013181}} In court documents, his attorney stated that Peiper was not a war criminal and that the Allies had used the trials to defame the German people. He asserted that the [[Nuremberg trial]] and the [[Malmedy massacre trial]] were merely propaganda. Citing documents published by the anti-Communist activist and [[McCarthyism|McCarthyist]], as well as controversial scholar and [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]], [[Freda Utley]], he asserted that the Malmedy massacre trial defendants had been tortured by the Americans. At the request of the court, Porsche and Peiper reached an agreement to terminate the employment contract, and Peiper received six months of wages as compensation. HIAG's official periodical, ''{{illm|Der Freiwillige|de|Der Freiwillige}}'', capitalized on the award and wrote that Peiper had been \"unfairly sentenced\" for war crimes.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=181}} Peiper became a car sales trainer for Volkswagen.{{r|Spiegel76}}\n\n===Criminal investigations in the 1960s===\nAt the beginning of the 1960s, the perception and opinion the public had of the Nazi crimes began to change. The German economic recovery did not allow SS men to hide, and holding a high position in society could raise questions that people like Peiper preferred to avoid.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=184}} The [[Adolf Eichmann trial]] and the [[Frankfurt Auschwitz trials]] in the first half of the 1960s (which had a large audience in West Germany) shone a new light on this period.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=184}} Prosecution was now initiated by the West German authorities themselves, not the Allies. The [[statute of limitations]] for the prosecution of Nazi crimes had been extended several times, which made those who had been involved in these crimes uncomfortable.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=184}}\n\nIn the early 1960s, Peiper's name came up several times in war crimes trials in Germany. He was mentioned in the proceedings against Karl Wolff, Himmler's senior adjutant, which began in early 1962 and concluded in 1964 with a 15-year sentence. Werner Grothmann, Peiper's successor as Himmler's adjutant, was also under investigation. In both of these proceedings, the court heard testimony from notorious Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, former ''[[Bandenbek\u00e4mpfung]]'' chief for occupied Europe, covering Himmler's pre-invasion designs to \"rid Russia of 30 million Slavic people\" or his  pronouncements, following the Minsk killings, that he was \"determined to eliminate the Jews\" (Peiper was with Himmler at that time but had gone to a field assignment following his brother's death).{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=214\u2013215}}\n\nIn 1964, Peiper learned that the village of Boves had installed a memorial naming his command as perpetrators of the Boves massacre. He immediately got in touch with others from his unit to coordinate a defense strategy. Mostly it consisted of blaming Italian communists for manufacturing false accusations and insisting that the destruction of the village was due to a fierce battle with partisans.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=223}} On 23 June 1964, criminal charges were filed against Peiper by the [[Central Office of the State Justice Administration for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes]] in [[Ludwigsburg]] having to do with the massacre.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=184}} The charges included statements from two former Italian partisans who recognised Peiper from a book on the Battle of the Bulge and a photograph of Peiper taken as the village burned below his position.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=224}} In 1968, the German District Court in Stuttgart concluded that Peiper's unit had set houses on fire and that \"a portion of the victims killed was from rioting that was committed by [the SS men]\".{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=145}} Nevertheless, the investigation was closed for lack of evidence that Peiper had issued a direct order to kill civilians and burn houses.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=184}} The court also somewhat naively concluded that since the testimonies of the former SS men were so consistent, no collusion between them was possible.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=145}}\n\nIn December 1964, [[Simon Wiesenthal]] made a highly damaging accusation that Peiper's unit arrested Jews in [[Borgo San Dalmazzo]]. The Borgo San Dalmazzo investigation was closed in 1969. Peiper was later called as a witness during the [[Werner Best]] trial, where he was confronted about his role of Himmler's adjutant. He did not deny having had close contact with Himmler, but he managed to avoid being directly implicated in Nazi crimes by claiming memory failure.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=184\u2013185}}\n\n===Last years and death===\nIn 1972, Peiper moved to a small village of [[Traves, Haute-Sa\u00f4ne]] in France, where he owned property. At that time he was a self-employed translator for the publisher Stuttgarter Motor-Buch Verlag. Under the pen name of \"Rainer Buschmann\", he translated books devoted to military history from English to German.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=185}}\n\nPeiper led a quiet and discreet life; however, he continued to use his name.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=185}} In 1974, he was identified by a former resistance member of the region who issued a report for the [[French Communist Party]]. In 1976, the party's history specialist, investigating the [[Gestapo]] archives, found the Peiper file.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=190}} On 21 June, flyers denouncing his presence were distributed in Traves. A day later, an article in ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'' revealed Peiper's presence in the village.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=190}} Soon media descended on Traves, with Peiper freely granting interviews and presenting himself as the victim. In one, titled \"J'ai pay\u00e9\", Peiper stated that he had paid for the Malmedy crime with 12 years in prison and that he was innocent of any crimes committed in Italy. Amid threats, Peiper accelerated his plans to move back to Germany, which had already been underway.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=192}} Sigurd, Peiper's wife, left for Germany on 12 July.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=194}}\n\nDuring the early morning hours of 14 July 1976 ([[Bastille Day]]), Peiper's home was attacked and set on fire. In the ruins, Peiper's charred corpse was found together with a .22 calibre rifle and a pistol.{{r|Spiegel76}} Investigators determined that he died of smoke inhalation apparently while trying to salvage documents, papers, and his wife's clothing. The body was charred beyond recognition.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=194\u2013195}} A group calling itself \"The Avengers\" claimed responsibility while suppositions continued as to who the culprits may have been. The circumstances of Peiper's death led to speculation that it had been faked.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=95}}\n\nPeiper's wife Sigurd (1912\u20131979) is buried alongside Peiper at Schondorf. The gravestone also bears the name of his brothers Horst (1912\u20131941) and Hasso (1910\u20131942), but it is unclear whether they are buried there. The local church community at Schondorf became aware that a Nazi war criminal was buried there in 2013 after receiving a letter from Boves. They were initially concerned that it would become a place of pilgrimage for Nazi sympathisers. A small group, the Boves circle, was formed in the village, to hold prayers on every 19th of the month, the day of the Boves massacre. In 2013 a group of citizens from Boves visited Schondorf and prayed at Peiper's grave.<ref name=\"Augsburg\" >{{cite web |last= |first= |url=https://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Nach-SS-Massaker-Nachkommen-der-Opfer-beten-am-Grab-des-Taeters-id41689996.html |title=Nach SS-Massaker: Nachkommen der Opfer beten am Grab des T\u00e4ters |publisher=[[Augsburger Allgemeine]] |date=10 June 2017 |website= |access-date=22 September 2018 |language=German |trans-title=SS-Massacre: Descendants of victims pray at the grave of the perpetrator |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925142009/https://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Nach-SS-Massaker-Nachkommen-der-Opfer-beten-am-Grab-des-Taeters-id41689996.html |archive-date=25 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Cult status==\nHistorians [[Ronald Smelser]] and [[Edward J. Davies]] note that Peiper is one of the darlings of the Americans who [[Waffen-SS in popular culture|romanticise the Waffen-SS]].{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=111}} Within the framework of the Cold War and the McCarthy era, he had emerged as a hero rather than a criminal. Peiper nearly became a folk hero in 1950s Germany with multiple groups working on his release from prison. This image then found its adherents in the United States. His behavior at trial, his physical appearance and his decorations all aided in the process. Smelser and Davies conclude: \"Here in the flesh was the perfect mythical man \u2013 both a tragic and heroic figure.\"{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\nFor some interested in World War II history, Peiper became the embodiment of German fighting spirit and a symbol of Panzer divisions daringly rushing forward. Because the Battle of the Bulge was viewed as \"decisive\" by the American public, Peiper, a relatively significant combat leader, became a sort of legendary figure \"deciding the fate of the German Reich, only to turn back due to lack of gasoline!\", wrote historian [[Jens Westemeier]].{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nThe admiration continues to this day. On December 16, 2019, an official [[US Department of Defense]] Facebook account featured a picture of Peiper as part of its celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the Facebook celebration's inclusion of Peiper triggered a \"widespread backlash on social media.\" When it was taken down, a Pentagon spokesmen defended its use by claiming that Peiper was profiled only to show the odds the Airborne Corps faced during the battle.<ref name=Nytimes2019-12-17/><ref name=Wapo2019-12-17/><ref name=MashViral2019-12-17/>\n\n''[[The Washington Post]]'' quoted challengers who described the DoD's profile of Peiper \"vile and disturbing\", and a \"{{'}}fanboy' flavored piece\".<ref name=Wapo2019-12-17/> It noted that researchers had traced the flattering, colorized version of the photo the DoD used to illustrate their post to the online work of a man whose activity there also included photos of Adolf Hitler striking American POWs, and concluded:\n\n<blockquote>It remains unclear how Pentagon and Army officials cleared an image apparently created by an artist who celebrates Nazi propaganda online to be published alongside a tribute to the American soldiers who fought and died to defeat a fascist regime 75 years ago. But the misstep is just the latest in a month of embarrassing incidents for the U.S. Army, which has been recently slammed with multiple allegations of white supremacist activity.<ref name=Wapo2019-12-17/></blockquote>\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=Spiegel76>{{cite news |date=19 July 1976 |title=Pech f\u00fcr ihn |newspaper=Der Spiegel |issue=30/1976 |language=de |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41210872.html |access-date=11 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310050336/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41210872.html |archive-date=10 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Nytimes2019-12-17>{{cite news\n |url         = https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/us/joachim-peiper-nazi-photo-apology.html\n |title       = Army Unit \u2018Regrets\u2019 Using Photo of Nazi War Criminal to Honor Battle of the Bulge\n |work        = [[The New York Times]]\n |author      = Mihir Zaveri\n |date        = 2019-12-17\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20191217145007/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/us/joachim-peiper-nazi-photo-apology.html\n |archivedate = 2019-12-17\n |accessdate  = 2019-12-17\n |url-status  = live\n |quote       = Colonel Rainsford said the post was not intended to glorify German forces or Peiper.

During [[World War II]] in Europe he served as personal [[adjutant]] to [[Heinrich Himmler]], the head of the SS, between September 1939 and September/October 1941, and thereafter as a [[Waffen-SS]] commander.\n\nDuring his career with Himmler Peiper witnessed the SS policies of [[ethnic cleansing]] and [[genocide]] in Eastern Europe; he persistently denied or obfuscated this fact following the war. Transferred to a combat role, Peiper served in the [[SS Division Leibstandarte]] on both the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern]] and the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]]s, commanding a battalion and then a regiment. He fought in the [[Third Battle of Kharkov]] and the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. Peiper's command became known for atrocities against civilians and prisoners of war.\n\nPeiper was convicted in the [[Malmedy massacre trial]] and sentenced to death. The sentence was commuted, with Peiper serving 12 years in prison. He was accused of committing the [[Boves massacre]] in Italy; the investigation was closed due to insufficient evidence that Peiper issued the order to kill civilians directly. After his release from prison, he worked for both [[Porsche]] and [[Volkswagen]], before moving to [[France]], where he worked as a freelance translator. Throughout, Peiper maintained frequent, albeit discreet, contact with his SS network, including [[HIAG]], a Waffen-SS lobby group. Peiper was murdered in France in July 1976, after his identity as an [[SS-man]] and war criminal had been publicized there.\n\nA relatively insignificant combat leader, Peiper achieved cult status among those who [[Waffen-SS in popular culture| romanticize the Waffen-SS]].{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=111}} With his good looks and a multitude of awards, Peiper came to represent the image of the daring Panzer divisions.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=15\u201316}} The admiration continues to the 2010s, with the official Facebook account of the [[US Department of Defense]] featuring a glamorized picture of Peiper to commemorate the 2019 anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge.<ref name=Nytimes2019-12-17/><ref name=Wapo2019-12-17/><ref name=MashViral2019-12-17/> In fact, Peiper was an embodiment of the Nazi ideology and an egocentric, ruthless commander who ignored his own losses and created a culture within his unit where war crimes were not only tolerated but expected.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=13}}\n\n==Early life==\nPeiper was born on 30 January 1915 into a middle-class family from the [[Silesia]]n region of Germany. His father, Waldemar Peiper, served in the [[Imperial German Army]] and fought in the colonial campaigns in [[German East Africa]].{{sfn|Weingartner|2004|pp=21\u201322}} In 1915, he retired from active duty for health reasons. After the war, Waldemar Peiper joined the paramilitary ''[[Freikorps]]'' and took part in the [[Silesian Uprisings]].{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=15\u201316}} With the rise of the [[Nazi Party]] in Germany, he evolved into a dedicated National Socialist and an [[Antisemitism|antisemite]].{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=35}}\n\nIn 1926, Peiper followed his older brother Horst (born 1912) and joined the [[Scouting|Scouting movement]], developing an interest in a military career.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=16}} Horst joined the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and served in the [[SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde|SS concentration camp guard]]. Transferred to a combat role, Horst participated in the [[Battle of France]] with the [[SS Division Totenkopf]]. He died in June 1941 in Poland in an accident that was never officially explained. Rumor had it that Horst was gay and was forced to commit suicide by others in his unit.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=40}} His eldest brother, Hans Hasso (born 1910), suffered from mental issues and unsuccessfully attempted suicide while in high school; in a permanent vegetative state, he was placed in an institution in 1931.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=8}}\n\n==SS career pre-World War II==\nWhen Peiper turned 18, he joined the [[Hitler Youth]] with his brother Horst.{{sfn|Weingartner|2004|pp=18, 21\u201322}}  In October 1933, Peiper volunteered for the SS and joined the Cavalry SS. His first superior was [[Gustav Lombard]], a Nazi zealot, antisemite, and later a regimental commander in the notorious [[SS Cavalry Brigade]] that murdered tens of thousands of Jews in the occupied Soviet Union.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=19\u201320}}\n\nOn 23 January 1934, Peiper received the rank of the ''[[SS-Mann]]'' under number 132.496. This made him a member of the SS even before it emerged from the shadow of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA) as an independent organization within the Nazi Party in the aftermath of the SA purge known as the [[Night of the Long Knives]]. During the 1934 [[Nuremberg Rally]], Peiper was promoted to SS-''[[Sturmmann]]'' and attracted the attention of [[Heinrich Himmler]].{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=20}} For Himmler, Peiper was likely the embodiment of the [[Aryanism|SS concept of the \"Aryan race\"]]; although not as tall and muscular as other SS recruits, Peiper made up for this with handsome features and self-confidence.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=11\u201312}}\n\nFrom January 1935 onward, Peiper was on the SS payroll and was sent to attend a leadership course of the [[Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler]] (LSSAH, Hitler's personal bodyguard unit).{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=21}} He received a favorable review from his SS instructors but only a conditional approval in the psychological evaluation conducted by German military doctors. They noted Peiper's egocentricity, negative attitude, and attempts to impress the evaluators with his connection to Himmler. The doctors concluded that Peiper might turn into a \"difficult subordinate\" or an \"arrogant superior\".{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=13\u201314}}\n\nPeiper later attended an [[SS-Junker School]] (SS officer training camp) in [[Braunschweig]] that, under the direction of [[Paul Hausser]], prepared future SS leaders.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=25}} In addition to military training, the courses aimed to instill a proper ideological worldview, with antisemitism being the main tenet. Instructors such as [[Matthias Kleinheisterkamp]] (an army has-been and alcoholic), or future war criminals, such as {{illm|Franz Magill|de|Franz Magill}} of the notorious SS Cavalry Brigade were of questionable competence. Peiper attended from 24 April 1935 to 30 March 1936 and was then posted to the LSSAH.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=14\u201317}} On 1 March 1938, Peiper received his Nazi Party membership card with the number 5.508.134. After the war he tried to deny, or at least obfuscate, his membership in the party, as it was inconsistent with the image that he had constructed for himself as being \"merely a soldier\". {{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=35}}\n\nPeiper remained with the LSSAH until June 1938{{sfn|Weingartner|2004|pp=21\u201322}} when he was appointed an [[adjutant]] to Heinrich Himmler, a step that Himmler considered necessary in the career path of an SS leader with promising potential. At that time, [[Personal Staff Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS|Himmler's personal staff]] was under the command of [[Karl Wolff]].{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=33, 182\u2013186}} Peiper worked in Himmler's anteroom in the [[SS Main Office]] on [[Prinz-Albrecht-Stra\u00dfe]] in Berlin. He became one of Himmler's favourite adjutants; Peiper admired him in return. Although after the war people from Himmler's inner circle, including Karl Wolff, tried to minimise the role of Himmler's adjutants, the role was far from inconsequential: the longer they stayed in Himmler's service, the more they gained influence and political connections.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=37}} By 1939, Peiper was quickly becoming Himmler's closest aid and accompanied him on all official functions and assisted his every move.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=36\u201337}}\n\nIn 1938, Peiper met and began courting Sigurd Hinrichsen, a secretary on Himmler's personal staff who was friends with both [[Lina Heydrich]] ([[Reinhard Heydrich]]'s wife) and Himmler's secretary [[Hedwig Potthast]], later to be Himmler's mistress.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=28\u201329}} On 26 June 1939, he married Sigurd in an SS ceremony. Himmler was the guest of honor at the wedding and delivered a short toast.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=33\u201334}} The couple lived in Berlin until the first [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|allied air raids]] on the city, when Sigurd was sent to [[Rottach-Egern]], [[Upper Bavaria]], near Himmler's second residence.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=39}} The couple later had three children.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=185}}\n\n==Himmler's adjutant during World War II==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Weill-060-13, Metz, Heinrich Himmler.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sepp Dietrich]] (left), Himmler, and Peiper (right) at [[Metz]], September 1940]]\n\n===Invasions of Poland and France===\nOn 1 September 1939, Germany [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]]. Peiper joined Himmler on board his special train and, on occasion, acted as his liaison to [[Adolf Hitler]], travelling with [[Erwin Rommel]] to accompany Hitler as he met with Wehrmacht generals near the front.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=40\u201341}} Peiper was with Himmler on 20 September in [[Bydgoszcz]] (Bromberg) when they witnessed the execution of 20&nbsp;Poles organized by the leader of the local [[Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz]] and SS functionary, [[Ludolf von Alvensleben]].{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=41}}{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=47}} As Peiper later told [[Ernst Sch\u00e4fer]], Hitler had ordered Himmler to eliminate \"Polish intellectuals\".{{sfn|Breitman, Goda et al. 2005|p=119}}\n\nAfter Poland was defeated, Peiper witnessed the developing SS policies of deportations and ethnic cleansing of the Polish population.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=42\u201343}} On 13 December 1939, Peiper and Himmler witnessed the gassing of residents of a psychiatric facility in [[Owi\u0144ska]] near [[Pozna\u0144]]. In post-war interrogations, Peiper described the experience in a detached, factual manner:\n<blockquote>The action [gassing] was done before a circle of invited guests. ... The insane were lead into a prepared casemate the door of which had a Plexiglas window. After the door was closed, one could see how, in the beginning, the insane still laughed and talked to each other. But, soon they sat down on the straw, obviously under the influence of the gas. ... Very soon, they no longer moved.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=46}} </blockquote>\n\nIn the winter of 1940, Peiper accompanied Himmler on a tour of [[Nazi concentration camps]], including [[Neuengamme concentration camp|Neuengamme]] and [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp|Sachsenhausen]], with a trip to Poland to meet with [[Friedrich-Wilhelm Kr\u00fcger]], [[Higher SS and Police Leader]] in occupied Poland, and his subordinate [[Odilo Globocnik]]. The latter was tasked with deporting Jews from Polish territories annexed to Germany to Warsaw and Lublin.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=46}} The tour continued in April 1940, with visits to [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] and [[Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp]]s, followed by a visit to Poland to meet with SS and Police Leader [[Wilhelm Rediess]] and the SS official [[Otto Rasch]] to discuss how further \"evacuations\" (i.e. shootings of civilian population) could be efficiently accomplished. In early May, Himmler, accompanied by Peiper, discussed with Odilo Globocnik, the SS and Police Leader in Lublin, the [[Aktion T4|mass murder of the disabled]]. Peiper also learned about Globocnik's work on the [[Lublin Reservation]].{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=54\u201356}}\n\nIn May 1940, Peiper accompanied Himmler as he followed [[Waffen-SS]] troops during the Battle of France. On 18 May, Peiper obtained permission to join a combat unit and became a platoon leader within the LSSAH. After seizing an artillery battery on the hills of Wattenberg, Peiper was awarded the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd class and promoted to SS-''[[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]]''.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=58}} For an audacious attack on 19 June, Peiper, now a company commander, received the Iron Cross 1st class.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=61}} As further remuneration, Peiper brought back a sports car from France for personal use; the car was added to the inventory of Himmler's staff on the latter's decree.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=62\u201363}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L15327, Spanien, Heinrich Himmler bei Franco.jpg|thumb|[[Karl Wolff]], Peiper and Himmler are received by [[Francisco Franco]], Spain, October 1940.]]\nPeiper returned to his duties as Himmler's adjutant on 21 June 1940.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=46}} On 7 September, Himmler addressed the LSSAH leaders to thank them for the help in expelling Jews from [[Alsace]] in eastern France. He referred to expulsions and massacres perpetrated in Poland, stating: \"We had to have the toughness\u2014this should be said and soon forgotten\u2014to shoot thousands of leading Poles\". He stressed the so-called difficulty of \"carrying out executions\", \"hauling away people\", or \"evicting crying and hysterical women\".{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=67\u201368}} Following a visit to [[Fascist Spain]] to meet its dictator [[Francisco Franco]], Peiper was officially promoted to the position of First Adjutant on 1 November.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=70}}\n\n===Invasion of the Soviet Union===\nIn February 1941, Himmler told Peiper about the German plan to invade the [[Soviet Union]], [[Operation Barbarossa]]. The following months were devoted to the preparation of the SS for this war. Thus, Himmler and his staff travelled to Norway, Austria, Poland, and Greece. The trip included a visit to the [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a ghetto]], about which Peiper wrote: \"It was a macabre image: we saw how the Jewish Ghetto police, who wore hats without rims and were armed with wooden clubs, inconsiderately made room for us\". This episode shows that Peiper was perfectly able to remember the details of the criminal process without forgetting anecdotes intended to prove that Jews were hitting other Jews which, by comparison, was supposed to reduce his own complicity.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=49\u201350}}&nbsp;\n\nFrom 11 to 15 June, Peiper was present for the SS conference where Himmler spoke of the plans to eliminate 30 million Slavic people. The event had brought together senior SS and police commanders who were to become [[SS and Police Leaders]] in the occupied Soviet Union. Also present were Karl Wolff; [[Kurt Daluege]], head of the [[Order Police]]; [[Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski]], future Higher SS and Police Leader in occupied [[Belarus]]; and Reinhard Heydrich, head of the [[Reich Security Main Office]].{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=72-73}} When the invasion began on 22 June 1941, Himmler transferred his headquarters to a special train and embarked on a tour of newly conquered territories with Peiper and other staff. Peiper accompanied Himmler on field inspections of various murder units. In [[August\u00f3w]], they were informed by the commander of the {{illm|Einsatzkommando Tilsit|de|Einsatzkommando Tilsit}} about the shooting of 200 people, while in [[Grodno]] Heydrich, in their presence, berated the local death squad leader for having shot only 96 Jews on that day.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=76-77}}&nbsp;\n\nIn July, Peiper and Himmler were in [[Bia\u0142ystok]] where they reviewed the progress achieved by the [[Order Police battalions]] and met again with Bach-Zalewski. Himmler informed him about the arrival of the units of the ''[[Kommandostab Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' (Himmler's Command Staff), half of whom would assist Bach-Zalewski in his area of command.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=78}} The recently created body supervised Waffen-SS formations set up for Himmler's racial and ideological war.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=52}} These formations included two motorized SS Infantry Brigades ([[1st SS Infantry Brigade|1st]] and [[2nd SS Infantry Brigade|2nd]]) and two SS Cavalry Regiments combined into the SS Cavalry Brigade, totalling about 25,000 Waffen-SS troops.{{sfn|Browning|2002|p=233}} The individual units were subordinated to local Higher SS and Police Leaders and used in the murder of Jews and other \"undesirables\", in addition to providing rear area security. In the former function, the units' activities were indistinguishable from the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and the Order Police battalions.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|2002|pp=92\u201393}}&nbsp;\n\nThe reports of the ''Kommandostab'' units were received daily, and it was Peiper's role to present them to Himmler every morning.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=52}} For example, the 30 July report from Gustav Lombard's SS cavalry regiment announced that 800 Jews including women and children had been shot. On 11 August, Lombard reported the total number of shot \"looters\" (a code word for the Jews) was 6,526. As the first adjutant, Peiper's job included providing Himmler with the murder statistics from the ''Einsatzgruppen'' units each morning.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=61\u201362}} The daily briefing included a review of operations; one surviving map shows a \"cleansing action\" (shooting) by the SS Cavalry Brigade. Peiper and [[Werner Grothmann]], Second Adjutant, were aware of all incoming communications; all of Himmler's orders passed through their hands.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=79, 348}}\n\nPeiper's role beside Himmler gradually came to an end beginning in the late summer of 1941.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=62}} Himmler transferred Peiper's duties as the first adjutant to his successor Werner  Grothmann. Although no longer Himmler's official First Adjutant, Peiper continued to update his appointment diary until mid-September 1941. During the transition time, Peiper likely served as Himmler's observer to LSSAH. Available records show that Peiper formally transferred to the LSSAH in early October 1941.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=62}} Peiper remained in close contact with Himmler as shown by their ongoing correspondence through to the end of the war; Himmler addressed Peiper as \"my dear Jochen\".{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=52}}\n\n==With SS Division Leibstandarte==\nWhen Peiper rejoined the LSSAH, it was engaged on the Eastern Front near the [[Black Sea]]. An injury to a unit commander soon gave him an opportunity to take command of the 11th Company.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=85, 87}} It fought at [[Mariupol]] and [[Rostov-on-Don]]. Peiper was noted for his fighting spirit, although his unit suffered high casualties as a consequence of his aggressive tactics.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=63}} During its combat action, the LSSAH was followed by ''[[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe D]]'', with which the division shared winter quarters. [[Sepp Dietrich]], LSSAH's commander, volunteered his troops to assist with the murder operations by sealing [[Taganrog]] and delivering Jews, Roma, and others to the death squads; the massacre of roughly 1,800 people took place on 29 October in the [[Gully of Petrushino]].{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=88}}&nbsp;\n\nIn May 1942, the LSSAH was transferred to France for rest and refit.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=65}} En route to France, Peiper left his unit and met with Himmler at his headquarters on 1 June. In July 1942, Peiper again met with Himmler and did not rejoin his unit until August 1942.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=66}} During its stay in France, the LSSAH was reorganised into a ''[[Panzergrenadier]]'' (mechanized infantry) division, and Peiper was promoted to command its 3rd Battalion.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=69}} Peiper continued to maintain a close relationship with Himmler, attending functions with high-ranking SS leaders. He even met with Himmler one-on-one.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=69}} \n\n===\"Blowtorch Battalion\"===\nMeanwhile, on the Eastern Front, the German situation had seriously worsened, especially in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. Peiper's battalion left France in January 1943 for the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=93}}&nbsp;During the [[Third Battle of Kharkov]], Peiper's battalion became known for an audacious rescue of the encircled 320th Infantry Division.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=94}} In a letter home, Peiper described hand-to-hand fighting with a Soviet ski battalion in an effort to lead the division, including its sick and wounded, to safety.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=74}} The rescue culminated with a fierce battle with the Soviet forces at the village of Krasnaya Polyana. Upon entering the village, Peiper's troops made a terrible discovery. All the men in his small rearguard medical detachment who had been left there had been killed and then mutilated. An SS sergeant in Peiper's ration supply company later stated that Peiper responded in kind: \"In the village, the two petrol trucks were burnt and 25 Germans killed by partisans and Soviet soldiers. As a revenge, Peiper ordered the burning down of the whole village and the shooting of its inhabitants\".{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=94}} (The testimony was obtained in November 1944 by the Western Allies.){{sfn|Parker|2014|p=356}}\n\nOn 6 May 1943, Peiper was awarded the [[German Cross in Gold]] for his achievements in February 1943 around Kharkov, where his unit gained the nickname the \"Blowtorch Battalion\". Reportedly, the nickname derived from the torching and slaughter of two Soviet villages where their inhabitants were either shot or burned.{{sfn|Arnold|1990|p=51}} Ukrainian sources, including surviving witness Ivan Kiselev, who was 14 at the time of the massacre, described the killings at the villages of Yefremovka and Semyonovka on 17 February 1943. On 12 February troops of the LSSAH occupied the two villages, where retreating Soviet forces had wounded two SS officers. In retaliation, five days later, LSSAH troops killed 872 men, women and children. Some 240 of these were burned alive in the church of Yefremovka.{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=356\u2013357}} In August 1944, when an SS commander, formerly of LSSAH, was captured south of Falaise in France and interrogated by the Allies, he stated that Peiper was \"particularly eager to execute the order to burn villages\".{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=354}} Peiper wrote to Potthast in March 1943: \"Our reputation precedes us as a wave of terror and is one of our best weapons. Even old [[Genghis Khan]] would gladly have hired us as assistants.\"{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=94-95}}\n\n===In Nazi propaganda===\nOn 9 March 1943, Peiper was awarded Germany's highest decoration, the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]]. Himmler sent personal congratulations over the radio: \"Heartfelt congratulations for the Knight's Cross my dear Jochen! I am proud of you!\"{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=96}} During this period, [[Nazi propaganda]] praised Peiper as an outstanding leader. The official SS newspaper ''[[Das Schwarze Korps]]'' (\"The Black Corps\") described Peiper's actions in Kharkov in glowing terms such as \"the master of the situation in all its phases\" and extolled Peiper's \"quick decision making\", \"caring\" attitude and \"bold and unorthodox orders\". The paper emphasized that he was \"a born leader, one filled with the highest sense of responsibility for the life of every single one of his men, but who [was] also able to be hard if necessary\".{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=75\u201376}}\n\nThe descriptions of his tactical skills propelled Peiper to become an icon of the Waffen-SS after the war, with former battalion members describing him in glowing terms.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=76}} Peiper was seen as an officer who obeyed orders without much discussion and expected the same from his men.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=74\u201377}} In July 1943, the LSSAH took part in [[Operation Citadel]] in the area of [[Kursk]], with Peiper's unit distinguishing itself in the fighting.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=80}} After the failure of the operation, the LSSAH was withdrawn from the Eastern Front and transferred to [[Northern Italy]].{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=102}}\n\n==Operations in Italy and the Boves massacre==\n{{Main|Boves massacre}}\nAfter Italian forces capitulated to the Allies, the LSSAH was moved to Italy for two months to participate in [[Operation Achse]], the disarming of the Italian military. Beginning in August, Peiper's battalion was stationed near [[Cuneo]].{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=83}} On 19 September, [[Italian partisans]] captured two of Peiper's men in the vicinity of [[Boves, Piedmont]].{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=143}} An attempt to free the German prisoners by a company of the LSSAH failed, resulting in one dead on each side and a number of German soldiers wounded. After this, Peiper and his unit were called in to free the German soldiers and took up positions in Boves, controlling access to the town. They threatened to destroy the town and its inhabitants should their demands not be met. Peiper committed to sparing the town if the German soldiers were freed.{{sfn|Schreiber|1996|pp=130}}\n\nThe [[parish priest]] of Boves, don Giuseppe Bernardi, and local industrialist Alessandro Vassallo, who had acted as negotiators between Peiper and the Italian soldiers and partisans, successfully secured the release of the prisoners and the return of the body of the killed SS trooper.{{sfn|Schreiber|1996|pp=132}} As Peiper's unit was withdrawing, violence erupted in the village. There were 24 victims; all were males, with the except for one woman who died of smoke inhalation in her home after it was set on fire by looting SS men. At least seventeen were murdered in cold blood, rather than in a battle. Most, especially those killed near the cemetery, were of non-military age and were found shot by small arms fire. LSSAH glibly reported that \"during the fights [with partisans] the villages of Boves and Costellar were burned down. In nearly all burning houses ammunition exploded. Some bandits were shot.\"{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=142}}\n\n==Return to the Eastern Front==\nBeginning in November 1943, Peiper's unit arrived on the Eastern Front, where it took part in combat in the area of [[Zhytomyr]]. Peiper was soon appointed commander of the 1st SS Panzer Regiment after its previous leader had been killed in action, yet he had no experience leading tanks.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=104}} The December fighting earned Peiper another award nomination. His personal record in support of the nomination stated that, from 5 to 7 of December, Peiper's regiment eliminated several Soviet artillery batteries, destroyed a divisional headquarters, and killed 2,280 \"Russians\", with only three taken prisoner. During the action at the village of {{illm|Pekartchina|ru|\u041f\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0449\u0438\u043d\u0430}}, Peiper \"attacked with all weapons and flame-throwers from his SPW [armored fighting vehicle]\". The village was burned to the ground and \"completely destroyed\".{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=105, 359}} \n\nPeiper's command style, aggressive and without regard for casualties, reached its limits. Headlong attacks without proper recognisance lead to heavy losses in men and materiel.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=87-93}} After one month, Peiper's Panzer regiment was reduced to twelve still-operational tanks.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=92}} In late December, he was ordered to the divisional staff; with so few operational tanks, his command of the regiment was no longer needed. The remnants of the unit were taken over by another officer on 22 December. On 20 January 1944, Peiper left his unit and went to Hitler's headquarters. Hitler presented him with a new award, the Oak Leaves to be added to his Knight's Cross. Peiper was physically and mentally exhausted. A medical examination concluded that he needed rest. Peiper went on a long leave with his family in [[Bavaria]].{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=92\u201393}}\n\n==Battle of Normandy==\nIn March 1944, the LSSAH was withdrawn from the Eastern Front and sent to be reformed in Belgium. New recruits, many of whom were teenagers, had little in common with fanatical SS volunteers of years past. The recruits underwent brutal training; five were sentenced to death for shirking their duties. Peiper gave the command to the executioners and later had recruits march past the bodies. In 1956, he was investigated by German authorities in connection with this event; Peiper denied everything, and the case was closed in 1966.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=95}}\n\nAs the Allied [[Operation Overlord]] began, LSSAH was moved closer to the Channel Coast, in anticipation of the \"real\" invasion at [[Pais de Calais]]. Transportation was limited, and the Allies had near-total air superiority.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=97}} Thus, Peiper's regiment only saw action from 18 July. Peiper was rarely in the frontline command, due to the terrain and the need to maintain radio silence.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=101}} As with the other German units in the area, they fought a defensive battle, until the German front began to collapse following Allied [[Operation Cobra]]. Having gone to the front with 19,618 men, the LSSAH lost 25% of its men and all of its tanks.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=95\u2013101}}\n\nPeiper was not in command of his Panzer regiment during [[Operation Luttich]], the failed counter-attacks near [[Avranches]]. Suffering from a nervous breakdown, he was relieved of command on 2 August and dispatched to the rear. From September 1944 forward, he was in a military hospital in Upper Bavaria, not far from his family. He was discharged on 7 October.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\n==Battle of the Bulge==\nDuring the autumn, German forces had to counter the attempts of the Western Allies to cross the [[Westwall]], while Hitler was looking for an opportunity to seize the initiative on the Western Front.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=105}} The result was [[Operation Wacht am Rhein]] (Battle of the Bulge). In a desperate attempt to defeat the Allies on the Western Front, the German armies were to break through the U.S. lines in the [[Ardennes]], cross the [[River Meuse]] and take [[Antwerp]], cutting the Allied forces in two.{{sfn|MacDonald|2002|p=17ff}}\n\nThe main role in the breakthrough was devoted to the [[6th SS Panzer Army]] under the command of Sepp Dietrich. It was to pierce the American lines between [[Aachen]] and the [[Schnee Eifel]] and seize bridges on the Meuse on both sides of [[Li\u00e8ge]]. Within the 6th Panzer Army, a mobile strike role was assigned to the LSSAH, then under the command of SS-''[[Oberf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Wilhelm Mohnke]]. The division was split into four combined-arms battle groups with Peiper commanding the most substantial, which included all armored sections of the division. Peiper also received the [[501st Heavy Panzer Battalion]] with the new 70 ton [[Tiger II]] (King Tigers). His battle group was to take bridges on the Meuse between Li\u00e8ge and [[Huy]]. To address the lack of fuel, Peiper was provided with a map showing American fuel depots, to allow him to seize fuel there if needed.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\n===Advance===\n[[File:BaugnezCrossroads1.JPG|thumb|The route followed by Peiper's battle group. The crossroads of [[Baugnez]] where the [[Malmedy massacre]] occurred is marked by a black circle.]]\nPeiper's assigned route included narrow, and in many places, single-track roads which forced units of the ''Kampfgruppe'' to tail each other, creating a column of infantry and armor up to {{convert|25|km}} long. Peiper complained that the road assigned to his ''Kampfgruppe'' was suitable for bicycles, but not for tanks.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=108}} [[Fritz Kr\u00e4mer]], chief of staff for the 6th Panzer Army responded, \"I don't care how and what you do. Just make it to the Meuse. Even if you've only one tank left when you get there.\"<ref>Whiting, Charles, ''Massacre at Malmedy'', Pen & Sword Military, 2007</ref> \n\nPeiper's mechanized column did not reach the jumping-off point until midnight, delaying his attack by almost 24 hours.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=111\u2013112}} Peiper had planned to advance through Losheimergraben, but the two infantry divisions assigned the task of opening the route for Peiper's unit failed to do so on the first day as planned. In the early morning of 17 December, they captured Honsfeld and much-needed fuel. Peiper continued west on his assigned route until he had to deflect shortly before {{illm|Ligneuville|fr|Ligneuville}} because the assigned road was impassable. This bypass forced him towards the Baugnez crossroads near [[Malmedy]].{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=113\u2013114}}\n\n===Malmedy and other atrocities===\n<!---[[File:Bodies of U.S. officers and soldiers slained by the Nazis after capture near Malmedy, Belgium. - NARA - 196544.jpg|thumb|right|The bodies of American [[POW]]s were found on 14 January 1945.]]--->\n[[File:\"Body_of_American_soldier_is_borne_on_stretcher_from_terrain_in_vicinity_of_Malmedy,_Belgium,_where_on_or_about_17_Decem_-_NARA_-_532956.tif|thumb|Aftermath of the [[Malmedy massacre]].

The troops, mainly elements of the American [[285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion]], were quickly overcome and captured.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=114}} Along with other American POWs captured earlier, they were ordered to stand in a meadow before the Germans opened fire on them with machine guns, killing 84 soldiers, and leaving the bodies in the snow. The survivors were able to reach American lines later that day, and their story spread rapidly throughout the American front lines.{{cn|date=December 2019}}  \n\nThe atrocities continued. In [[Buttingen|Honsfeld]], Peiper's men murdered several American prisoners.{{sfn|MacDonald|2002}}{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=113}} Other murders of POWs and civilians were reported in [[B\u00fcllingen]],{{sfn|MacDonald|2002}} Ligneuville and [[Stavelot]],{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=115}} Cheneux, [[La Gleize]], and [[Stoumont]] on 17, 18, 19 and 20 December.{{cn|date=December 2019}} On 19 December 1944, in the area between Stavelot and [[Trois-Ponts]], while the Germans were trying to regain control of the bridge over the [[Ambl\u00e8ve River]], (crucial for allowing reinforcements and supplies to reach them) men of ''Kampfgruppe'' Peiper killed a number of Belgian civilians. The battle group was eventually declared responsible for the deaths of 362 prisoners of war and 111 civilians.{{sfn|MacDonald|2002}}\n\n===Stall and retreat===\nMoving ahead, Peiper crossed Ligneuville and reached the heights of Stavelot on the left bank of the Ambl\u00e8ve River at nightfall of the second day of the operation. The battle group paused for the night, allowing Americans to reorganise. After heavy fighting, Peiper's armor crossed the bridge on the Ambl\u00e8ve. The spearhead continued on, without having fully secured Stavelot. By then, the surprise factor had been lost. The U.S. forces regrouped and blew up several bridges ahead of Peiper's advance, trapping the battle group in the deep valley of the Ambl\u00e8ve, downstream from Trois-Ponts. The weather also improved, permitting the Allied air forces to operate. The U.S. airstrikes destroyed or heavily damaged numerous German vehicles. Peiper's command was in disarray: some units had lost their way among difficult terrain or in the dark, while company commanders preferred to stay with Peiper at the head of the column and thus were unable to provide guidance to their own units.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=115\u2013116}} \n\nPeiper attacked Stoumont on 19 December and took the town amid heavy fighting. He was unable to protect his rear, which enabled American troops to cut him off from the only possible supply road for ammunition and fuel at Stavelot.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=117}} Without supplies, and with no contact with other German units behind him, Peiper could advance no further. American attacks on Stoumont forced the remnants of the battle group to retreat to La Gleize. On 24 December, Peiper abandoned his vehicles and retreated with the remaining men. German wounded and American prisoners were also left behind.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=118\u2013119}} According to Peiper, 717 men returned to the German lines out of 3,000 at the beginning of the operation.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=113}} \n\nDespite the failure of Peiper's battle group and the loss of all tanks, Wilhelm Mohnke, LSSAH's commander, recommended Peiper for a further award. The events at the Baugnez crossroads were described in glowing terms:{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=111\u2013112}} \n\n<blockquote>Without regard for threats from the flanks and only inspired by the thought of a deep breakthrough, the Kampfgruppe proceeded&nbsp;... to Ligneuville and destroyed at Baugnez an enemy supply column and after annihilation of the units blocking their advance, succeeded in causing the staff of the 49th Anti-Aircraft Brigade to flee.</blockquote> \n\nRather than a stain on Peiper's honour, the killing of POWs was celebrated in official records.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=112}} In January 1945, the Swords were added to his Knight's Cross. The great fame of Peiper as a Waffen-SS commander during the [[Battle of the Bulge]] was born.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\n==End of the war==\nOn 4 February, Peiper met for the last time with Himmler at his provisional headquarters. His unit took part in [[Operation Spring Awakening]], which failed. Although Peiper's unit inflicted a large number of casualties, due to his aggressive style of command he lost many men.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=132}} On 1 May, as LSSAH was forced into Austria, the men were informed of [[Death of Adolf Hitler|Hitler's death]]. On 8 May, the LSSAH received the order to cross the [[Enns (river)|Enns]]  and surrender to the American troops.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=133}} Instead of surrendering, Peiper chose to treck home. He was apprehended on 22 May by American troops.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=134}}\n\nThrough July 1945, Peiper was held in a POW camp in Bavaria with about 500 other German soldiers and SS men.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=130}} As an unofficial leader of the group, Peiper came to the attention of the commander of the camp,{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=132\u2013133}} and then of higher command. When asked about the plight of Poles and Jews, Peiper reportedly responded: \"All the Jews are bad and all Poles are bad. We have just cleansed our society and moved these people into camps and you let them loose!\" Peiper also lamented that the Americans refused to incorporate the SS into its army to \"prepare to fight the Russians\".{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=135\u2013136}} \n\nMeanwhile, an active investigation into the Malmedy massacre was launched at the end of June 1945 by American war crimes investigators.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=137}} Crimes during the Battle of the Bulge were attributed to ''Kampfgruppe'' Peiper, resulting in American investigative teams searching POW camps for its men.{{sfn|MacDonald|2002}} Peiper topped the list of alleged perpetrators but was difficult to locate due to an enormous number of prisoners (four million) and haphazard communications.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=138}} Peiper was finally identified as a Malmedy suspect on 21 August 1945, after a transfer to a much larger camp where his file came to the attention of its commander by chance. Peiper was immediately transferred to a military intelligence interrogation center in [[Freising]].{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=140}}\n\n==War crimes conviction==\n\n===Interrogation and trial===\nJailed in Freising, Upper Bavaria, Peiper underwent his first interrogations.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=157}} Investigators quickly found that the SS men, including Peiper, although hardened soldiers, were not trained to withstand interrogation.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=157}} Some men freely gave the requested information, while others only did so after having been allegedly subject to various forms of torture such as beatings, threats and mock executions.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=157}} Peiper took [[command responsibility]] for the actions of the men under his command. In December 1945, he was transferred to the prison at [[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]], where 1,000 former members of the LSSAH were assembled.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=157}} On 16 April 1946, approximately 300 prisoners were moved from Schw\u00e4bisch Hall to Dachau, where they were put on trial.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=157}}\n\n[[File:Malmedy 2 Joachim Peiper.jpg|thumbnail|Peiper at [[Malmedy massacre trial]]]]\nThe trial took place at Dachau from 16 May to 16 July 1946 before a [[military tribunal]]. The 74 defendants included Sepp Dietrich, commander of the [[6th Panzer Army|6th SS Panzer Army]], his chief of staff Fritz Kr\u00e4mer, [[Hermann Prie\u00df]], [[I SS Panzer Corps]] commander, and Peiper, commander of the 1st SS Panzer Regiment (the unit to which the crimes were attributed).{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=159}} The accusations were mainly based on the sworn and written statements provided by the defendants in Schw\u00e4bisch Hall. To counter the evidence given in the men's sworn statements and by prosecution witnesses, the lead defense attorney, [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lt. Colonel]] Willis M. Everett tried to show that the statements had been obtained by inappropriate methods.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=160\u2013165}}\n\nEverett called Lt. Colonel Hal McCown, commander of the 2nd Battalion, [[119th Infantry Regiment (United States)|119th Infantry Regiment]], to testify about Peiper's troops' treatment of American prisoners at La Gleize. McCown, who, along with his command, had been captured by Peiper on 21 December, testified that he had not seen any American prisoners mistreated by the SS.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=148}} It was noted by the prosecution that by the time McCown was captured on 21 December, Peiper was aware that his tactical situation had deteriorated substantially and that he and his men were in danger of becoming POWs themselves. On 17 December at Malmedy, Peiper's unit was advancing aggressively and still hoped to reach its objective, whereas by 21 December the unit found itself nearly cut off at La Gleize and out of fuel, having suffered over 80% casualties. Peiper's shifting attitude towards POWs was calculated, as he held Col. McCown and others as his unit fled La Gleize on foot, intending to use them as bargaining chips in the event of capture.{{sfn|Goldstein|1994|pp=167\u2013182}}\n\nEverett had decided to call only Peiper to testify. However, other defendants, supported by their German lawyers, wanted to testify as well. This would soon prove to be a huge mistake, for when the prosecution cross-examined the defendants, they behaved like \"a bunch of drowning rats (...) turning on each other.\"{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=160\u2013165}} According to Everett, these testimonies gave the court enough reason to sentence several of the defendants to death.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=160\u2013165}}\n\nThe military court was not convinced by Peiper's testimony about the murder of the POWs under his battle group's control.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=160\u2013165}} During the trial, several witnesses testified of at least two instances when Peiper had ordered the murder of prisoners of war.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=163}} When questioned by the prosecution, Peiper denied these allegations, stating that they were obtained from witnesses under torture.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=163\u2013164}} When questioned about the murder of Belgian civilians, Peiper said they were partisans.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=164}}\n\n===Death sentence===\nTogether with 42 other defendants, Joachim Peiper was sentenced to death by hanging on 16 July 1946. The sentences were automatically subject to review by the U.S. Army Review Board. In October 1947, the results were submitted, and many verdicts were subsequently changed. Starting in March 1948, sentences were further reviewed by General [[Lucius D. Clay]], commander-in-chief in Germany. Clay confirmed 12 death sentences, including Peiper's.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=171}} <!----commuted six more death sentences to life imprisonment. But he refused to commute the six remaining death sentences, including Peiper's, though the executions were postponed.---> \n<!----\nThe sentences generated significant controversy in some German circles, including among the clergy, leading the commander of the [[United States Army Europe|US Army in Germany]] to commute some of the death sentences to life imprisonment. In addition, the Germans' defense attorney, [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Army|US military attorney]] Lt. Col. Willis M. Everett, appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]], claiming that the defendants had been found guilty by means of \"illegal and fraudulently procured confessions\" and were subjects of mock trial.{{cn|date=December 2019}}--->\n\nThe turmoil raised by this case caused the [[Secretary of the Army]], [[Kenneth Royall]], to create a commission chaired by Judge Gordon A. Simpson of Texas to investigate. The commission was interested in the Malmedy massacre trial and in other cases judged at Dachau. The commission arrived in Europe on 30 July 1948 and issued its report on 14 September. In this report, it recommended that the twelve remaining death sentences be commuted to life imprisonment. The commission confirmed the accuracy of Everett's accusations regarding mock trials but neither disputed nor denied his charges of torture of the defendants. The commission expressed the opinion that the pre-trial investigation had not been properly conducted. Its members felt that no death sentence should be carried out where such a doubt existed.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe [[United States Senate]] launched its own investigations, which were opened in early 1950 by several Senate committees. One of them included [[Joseph McCarthy]] who prepared to launch his sensationalist career. Receiving encouragement and information from right-wing and anti-Semitic circles, McCarthy dominated the proceedings and grabbed headlines. He was probably encouraged by the right-wing judge, LeRoy van Roden, who saw the trials as a Jewish effort to take revenge on the Germans, and who had also served on the investigating commissions.{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=169}} The [[Senate Committee on Armed Services]] came to the conclusion of improper pre-trial procedures, including a mock trial, had indeed affected the trial process but not torture as sometimes stated. There was little or no doubt that some of the accused were indeed guilty of the massacre.<ref>Malmedy massacre Investigation&nbsp;\u2013 Report of the Subcommittee of Committee on armed services&nbsp;\u2013 United States Senate&nbsp;\u2013Eighty-first Congress, first session, pursuant to S. res. 42, Investigation of action of army with respect to trial of persons responsible for the massacre of American soldiers, Battle of the Bulge, near Malmedy, Belgium, December 1944, October 13, 1949</ref>\n\n===Release from prison===\n\nThe popular Wehrmacht ex-general [[Heinz Guderian]] actively campaigned for Peiper. He wrote to one of his subordinates in 1951:{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|pp=110\u2013111}}\n<blockquote>At the moment I'm negotiating with General Handy [Heidelberg] because [he] wants to hang the unfortunate Peiper. McCloy is powerless, because the Malmedy trial is being handled by Eucom, and is not subordinate to McCloy. As a result, I have decided to cable President Truman and ask him if he is familiar with this idiocy.</blockquote>\n\nUltimately, the sentences of the Malmedy defendants were commuted to life imprisonment and then to time served. Peiper's sentence was commuted to 35 years in 1954, and he was released in December 1956, the last of the Malmedy condemned to be freed.{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=169}}\n\nThe \"old boys' network\" of SS peers helped him to obtain his release from prison and secure employment. [[HIAG]], an organisation of former Waffen-SS men, had already helped Peiper's wife find a job near the [[Landsberg Prison]]. They then worked to achieve the conditional release of Peiper himself. Peiper had to prove he could obtain a job. Through an intermediary, Albert Prinzing, a former SS functionary in the [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SS security service), he got a job at the car manufacturer [[Porsche]].{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=176}}\n\n==Return to civilian life==\nFollowing his release from Landsberg Prison, Peiper was careful not to associate too closely with former Waffen-SS men and their organization, HIAG, at least publicly. Privately, however, he maintained contact with and was closely involved with many former SS members. In 1959, he attended the national meeting of the [[Association of Knight's Cross Recipients]]. Travelling with HIAG's official historian [[Walter Harzer]], he reunited with Sepp Dietrich and [[Heinz Lammerding]] at the closed-door meeting.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=212}} Peiper was often seen at the funerals of personalities such as [[Kurt Meyer]], Dietrich and Paul Hausser.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=182\u2013183}} He assisted the efforts of HIAG to rehabilitate the Waffen-SS by hiding its criminal aspects and exalting its combat achievements, claiming that the SS were just like other soldiers. Peiper once told one of his friends: \"I personally think that every attempt at rehabilitation during our lifetime is unrealistic, but one can still collect material.\"{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=182\u2013183}}\n\nOn 17 January 1957, Peiper began work at Porsche in [[Stuttgart]] in its technical division.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=176\u2013179}} As he advanced within Porsche, he was accused by Italian union workers of the [[Boves massacre]] in Italy during World War II. [[Ferry Porsche]] personally intervened and promised Peiper a senior management position, but the offer was derailed by the trade unions, who objected to convicted war criminals serving in the upper management of the company. The strong antipathy to Peiper, his association with Ferry Porsche, and the related negative effect on sales in Porsche's biggest market, the United States, forced Porsche's management to dismiss him.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=180\u2013181}} \n\nOn 30 December 1960, Peiper filed a suit against Porsche.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=180\u2013181}} In court documents, his attorney stated that Peiper was not a war criminal and that the Allies had used the trials to defame the German people. He asserted that the [[Nuremberg trial]] and the [[Malmedy massacre trial]] were merely propaganda. Citing documents published by the anti-Communist activist and [[McCarthyism|McCarthyist]], as well as controversial scholar and [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]], [[Freda Utley]], he asserted that the Malmedy massacre trial defendants had been tortured by the Americans. At the request of the court, Porsche and Peiper reached an agreement to terminate the employment contract, and Peiper received six months of wages as compensation. HIAG's official periodical, ''{{illm|Der Freiwillige|de|Der Freiwillige}}'', capitalized on the award and wrote that Peiper had been \"unfairly sentenced\" for war crimes.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=181}} Peiper became a car sales trainer for Volkswagen.{{r|Spiegel76}}\n\n===Criminal investigations in the 1960s===\nAt the beginning of the 1960s, the perception and opinion the public had of the Nazi crimes began to change. The German economic recovery did not allow SS men to hide, and holding a high position in society could raise questions that people like Peiper preferred to avoid.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=184}} The [[Adolf Eichmann trial]] and the [[Frankfurt Auschwitz trials]] in the first half of the 1960s (which had a large audience in West Germany) shone a new light on this period.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=184}} Prosecution was now initiated by the West German authorities themselves, not the Allies. The [[statute of limitations]] for the prosecution of Nazi crimes had been extended several times, which made those who had been involved in these crimes uncomfortable.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=184}}\n\nIn the early 1960s, Peiper's name came up several times in war crimes trials in Germany. He was mentioned in the proceedings against Karl Wolff, Himmler's senior adjutant, which began in early 1962 and concluded in 1964 with a 15-year sentence. Werner Grothmann, Peiper's successor as Himmler's adjutant, was also under investigation. In both of these proceedings, the court heard testimony from notorious Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, former ''[[Bandenbek\u00e4mpfung]]'' chief for occupied Europe, covering Himmler's pre-invasion designs to \"rid Russia of 30 million Slavic people\" or his  pronouncements, following the Minsk killings, that he was \"determined to eliminate the Jews\" (Peiper was with Himmler at that time but had gone to a field assignment following his brother's death).{{sfn|Parker|2014|pp=214\u2013215}}\n\nIn 1964, Peiper learned that the village of Boves had installed a memorial naming his command as perpetrators of the Boves massacre. He immediately got in touch with others from his unit to coordinate a defense strategy. Mostly it consisted of blaming Italian communists for manufacturing false accusations and insisting that the destruction of the village was due to a fierce battle with partisans.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=223}} On 23 June 1964, criminal charges were filed against Peiper by the [[Central Office of the State Justice Administration for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes]] in [[Ludwigsburg]] having to do with the massacre.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=184}} The charges included statements from two former Italian partisans who recognised Peiper from a book on the Battle of the Bulge and a photograph of Peiper taken as the village burned below his position.{{sfn|Parker|2014|p=224}} In 1968, the German District Court in Stuttgart concluded that Peiper's unit had set houses on fire and that \"a portion of the victims killed was from rioting that was committed by [the SS men]\".{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=145}} Nevertheless, the investigation was closed for lack of evidence that Peiper had issued a direct order to kill civilians and burn houses.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=184}} The court also somewhat naively concluded that since the testimonies of the former SS men were so consistent, no collusion between them was possible.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=145}}\n\nIn December 1964, [[Simon Wiesenthal]] made a highly damaging accusation that Peiper's unit arrested Jews in [[Borgo San Dalmazzo]]. The Borgo San Dalmazzo investigation was closed in 1969. Peiper was later called as a witness during the [[Werner Best]] trial, where he was confronted about his role of Himmler's adjutant. He did not deny having had close contact with Himmler, but he managed to avoid being directly implicated in Nazi crimes by claiming memory failure.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=184\u2013185}}\n\n===Last years and death===\nIn 1972, Peiper moved to a small village of [[Traves, Haute-Sa\u00f4ne]] in France, where he owned property. At that time he was a self-employed translator for the publisher Stuttgarter Motor-Buch Verlag. Under the pen name of \"Rainer Buschmann\", he translated books devoted to military history from English to German.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=185}}\n\nPeiper led a quiet and discreet life; however, he continued to use his name.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=185}} In 1974, he was identified by a former resistance member of the region who issued a report for the [[French Communist Party]]. In 1976, the party's history specialist, investigating the [[Gestapo]] archives, found the Peiper file.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=190}} On 21 June, flyers denouncing his presence were distributed in Traves. A day later, an article in ''[[L'Humanit\u00e9]]'' revealed Peiper's presence in the village.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=190}} Soon media descended on Traves, with Peiper freely granting interviews and presenting himself as the victim. In one, titled \"J'ai pay\u00e9\", Peiper stated that he had paid for the Malmedy crime with 12 years in prison and that he was innocent of any crimes committed in Italy. Amid threats, Peiper accelerated his plans to move back to Germany, which had already been underway.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=192}} Sigurd, Peiper's wife, left for Germany on 12 July.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=194}}\n\nDuring the early morning hours of 14 July 1976 ([[Bastille Day]]), Peiper's home was attacked and set on fire. In the ruins, Peiper's charred corpse was found together with a .22 calibre rifle and a pistol.{{r|Spiegel76}} Investigators determined that he died of smoke inhalation apparently while trying to salvage documents, papers, and his wife's clothing. The body was charred beyond recognition.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=194\u2013195}} A group calling itself \"The Avengers\" claimed responsibility while suppositions continued as to who the culprits may have been. The circumstances of Peiper's death led to speculation that it had been faked.{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|p=95}}\n\nPeiper's wife Sigurd (1912\u20131979) is buried alongside Peiper at Schondorf. The gravestone also bears the name of his brothers Horst (1912\u20131941) and Hasso (1910\u20131942), but it is unclear whether they are buried there. The local church community at Schondorf became aware that a Nazi war criminal was buried there in 2013 after receiving a letter from Boves. They were initially concerned that it would become a place of pilgrimage for Nazi sympathisers. A small group, the Boves circle, was formed in the village, to hold prayers on every 19th of the month, the day of the Boves massacre. In 2013 a group of citizens from Boves visited Schondorf and prayed at Peiper's grave.<ref name=\"Augsburg\" >{{cite web |last= |first= |url=https://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Nach-SS-Massaker-Nachkommen-der-Opfer-beten-am-Grab-des-Taeters-id41689996.html |title=Nach SS-Massaker: Nachkommen der Opfer beten am Grab des T\u00e4ters |publisher=[[Augsburger Allgemeine]] |date=10 June 2017 |website= |access-date=22 September 2018 |language=German |trans-title=SS-Massacre: Descendants of victims pray at the grave of the perpetrator |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925142009/https://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/bayern/Nach-SS-Massaker-Nachkommen-der-Opfer-beten-am-Grab-des-Taeters-id41689996.html |archive-date=25 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Cult status==\nHistorians [[Ronald Smelser]] and [[Edward J. Davies]] note that Peiper is one of the darlings of the Americans who [[Waffen-SS in popular culture|romanticise the Waffen-SS]].{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|p=111}} Within the framework of the Cold War and the McCarthy era, he had emerged as a hero rather than a criminal. Peiper nearly became a folk hero in 1950s Germany with multiple groups working on his release from prison. This image then found its adherents in the United States. His behavior at trial, his physical appearance and his decorations all aided in the process. Smelser and Davies conclude: \"Here in the flesh was the perfect mythical man \u2013 both a tragic and heroic figure.\"{{sfn|Smelser|Davies|2008|pp=169\u2013170}}\n\nFor some interested in World War II history, Peiper became the embodiment of German fighting spirit and a symbol of Panzer divisions daringly rushing forward. Because the Battle of the Bulge was viewed as \"decisive\" by the American public, Peiper, a relatively insignificant combat leader, became a sort of legendary figure \"deciding the fate of the German Reich, only to turn back due to lack of gasoline!\", wrote historian [[Jens Westemeier]].{{sfn|Westemeier|2007|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nThe admiration continues to this day. On December 16, 2019, an official [[US Department of Defense]] Facebook account featured a picture of Peiper as part of its celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', the Facebook celebration's inclusion of Peiper triggered a \"widespread backlash on social media.\" When it was taken down, a Pentagon spokesmen defended its use by claiming that Peiper was profiled only to show the odds the Airborne Corps faced during the battle.<ref name=Nytimes2019-12-17/><ref name=Wapo2019-12-17/><ref name=MashViral2019-12-17/>\n\n''[[The Washington Post]]'' quoted challengers who described the DoD's profile of Peiper \"vile and disturbing\", and a \"{{'}}fanboy' flavored piece\".<ref name=Wapo2019-12-17/> It noted that researchers had traced the flattering, colorized version of the photo the DoD used to illustrate their post to the online work of a man whose activity there also included photos of Adolf Hitler striking American POWs, and concluded:\n\n<blockquote>It remains unclear how Pentagon and Army officials cleared an image apparently created by an artist who celebrates Nazi propaganda online to be published alongside a tribute to the American soldiers who fought and died to defeat a fascist regime 75 years ago. But the misstep is just the latest in a month of embarrassing incidents for the U.S. Army, which has been recently slammed with multiple allegations of white supremacist activity.<ref name=Wapo2019-12-17/></blockquote>\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=Spiegel76>{{cite news |date=19 July 1976 |title=Pech f\u00fcr ihn |newspaper=Der Spiegel |issue=30/1976 |language=de |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41210872.html |access-date=11 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310050336/http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-41210872.html |archive-date=10 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Nytimes2019-12-17>{{cite news\n |url         = https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/us/joachim-peiper-nazi-photo-apology.html\n |title       = Army Unit \u2018Regrets\u2019 Using Photo of Nazi War Criminal to Honor Battle of the Bulge\n |work        = [[The New York Times]]\n |author      = Mihir Zaveri\n |date        = 2019-12-17\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20191217145007/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/us/joachim-peiper-nazi-photo-apology.html\n |archivedate = 2019-12-17\n |accessdate  = 2019-12-17\n |url-status  = live\n |quote       = Colonel Rainsford said the post was not intended to glorify German forces or Peiper.

In his prime, Goldsmith was six-foot-one-inch tall and weighed 195 pounds.\n\n==The Great Curveball Debate: Goldsmith or Cummings?==\nThe two strongest candidates for inventing the [[curveball]] are Fred Goldsmith and [[Candy Cummings]], Goldsmith's old rival when the two played in the [[International Association for Professional Base Ball Players]] in 1877\u201378\u2014Goldsmith with the pennant-winning [[London Tecumsehs]] and Cummings with the [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], Live Oaks. Cummings was also the first president of the International Association when he pitched for the Lynn Live Oaks.\n\nWhile it is difficult, if not impossible, to pin down definitively who did first invent or throw the first curveball, the lore is that Candy Cummings threw the first known curveball during a game in 1867 in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], with the [[Excelsior of Brooklyn|Brooklyn Excelsiors]].\n\nFred Goldsmith is credited with giving the first publicly recorded demonstration of a curveball to sportswriter-baseball historian [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]] on August 16, 1870, at the [[Capitoline Grounds]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>''Brooklyn Eagle'' newspaper, August 17, 1870.</ref>\n\n[[Sportscaster]]-American actor [[Bill Stern]] waded into the debate in 1949 with a \"favorite story\" firmly crediting Goldsmith as the inventor and with transforming baseball. (See [[Bill Stern#Bill Stern on the curveball|Bill Stern on the curveball]].)\n\nAdditionally, an article in ''[[The London Free Press]]'' (''Fred Goldsmith Invented The Curveball'') of June 21, 1939, credits Goldsmith with inventing the curveball and says that \"Just three days following Fred Goldsmith's death [on March 28, 1939], ''The Sporting News'' devoted an editorial to Goldsmith's feat of 61 years ago and asked that he be officially recognized as the inventor of the curve ball.\"\n\nFurther, an article in the August 2, 1938, ''London Free Press'' (''Nick Altrock Is Here For Today'') indicates that former Major League pitcher [[Nick Altrock]] also believed that Goldsmith invented the curveball. Altrock and Goldsmith were in London, Ontario, for an Old Boys Reunion and afternoon game at [[Labatt Park]] between a team from [[Battle Creek, Michigan]], and a London Seniors team.\n\nIronically, Cummings was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Cooperstown, New York]] in 1939\u2014the same year that Goldsmith died\u2014largely due to Cummings's supposed invention of the curveball.\n\n==Goldsmith's professional career==\nDuring his lifetime, Goldsmith pitched professionally for the [[New Haven]] New Havens (1875); the London Tecumsehs (in 1876, before the Tecumsehs joined the International Association) and after the Tecumsehs joined the fledgling International Association (1877\u201378); the [[Troy, New York]] Trojans of the [[National League]] (1879); the [[Chicago White Stockings (1870\u201389)|Chicago White Stockings]] of the National League (1880\u20131884) and briefly for the [[Baltimore Orioles]] of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] (1884).\n\nPitching for the Chicago White Stockings, Goldsmith had four seasons with 20 wins or more: 1880 (21\u20133); 1881 (24\u201313); 1882 (28\u201317); 1883 (25\u201319).\n\nGoldsmith's win\u2013loss percentage of .622 (112\u201368) does not include his games in New Haven or in [[London, Ontario]], Canada, with the International Association pennant winners, the London Tecumsehs.\n\nDuring Goldsmith's five-season stint pitching for the Chicago White Stockings, he played with first baseman [[Cap Anson]] and for team President [[A.G. Spalding]], when Chicago won several league pennants. Goldsmith's final game in the pro ranks was on September 10, 1884.\n\n==Images of Fred Goldsmith==\n<gallery>\nImage:Fred_Goldsmith_in_1876_1877_1878_London_Tecumseh_Team_London_Ontario_Canada.jpg|1.

In his prime, Goldsmith was six-foot-one-inch tall and weighed 195 pounds.\n\n==The Great Curveball Debate: Goldsmith or Cummings?==\nThe two strongest candidates for inventing the [[curveball]] are Fred Goldsmith and [[Candy Cummings]], Goldsmith's old rival when the two played in the [[International Association for Professional Base Ball Players]] in 1877\u201378\u2014Goldsmith with the pennant-winning [[London Tecumsehs]] and Cummings with the [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], Live Oaks. Cummings was also the first president of the International Association when he pitched for the Lynn Live Oaks.\n\nWhile it is difficult, if not impossible, to pin down definitively who did first invent or throw the first curveball, the lore is that Candy Cummings threw the first known curveball during a game in 1867 in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], with the [[Excelsior of Brooklyn|Brooklyn Excelsiors]].\n\nFred Goldsmith is credited with giving the first publicly recorded demonstration of a curveball to sportswriter-baseball historian [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]] on August 16, 1870, at the [[Capitoline Grounds]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref>''Brooklyn Eagle'' newspaper, August 17, 1870.</ref>\n\n[[Sportscaster]]-American actor [[Bill Stern]] waded into the debate in 1949 with a \"favorite story\" firmly crediting Goldsmith as the inventor and with transforming baseball. (See [[Bill Stern#Bill Stern on the curveball|Bill Stern on the curveball]].)\n\nAdditionally, an article in ''[[The London Free Press]]'' (''Fred Goldsmith Invented The Curveball'') of June 21, 1939, credits Goldsmith with inventing the curveball and says that \"Just three days following Fred Goldsmith's death [on March 28, 1939], ''The Sporting News'' devoted an editorial to Goldsmith's feat of 61 years ago and asked that he be officially recognized as the inventor of the curve ball.\"\n\nFurther, an article in the August 2, 1938, ''London Free Press'' (''Nick Altrock Is Here For Today'') indicates that former Major League pitcher [[Nick Altrock]] also believed that Goldsmith invented the curveball. Altrock and Goldsmith were in London, Ontario, for an Old Boys Reunion and afternoon game at [[Labatt Park]] between a team from [[Battle Creek, Michigan]], and a London Seniors team.\n\nIronically, Cummings was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Cooperstown, New York]] in 1939\u2014the same year that Goldsmith died\u2014largely due to Cummings's supposed invention of the curveball.\n\n==Goldsmith's professional career==\nDuring his lifetime, Goldsmith pitched professionally for the [[New Haven]] New Havens (1875); the London Tecumsehs (in 1876, before the Tecumsehs joined the International Association) and after the Tecumsehs joined the fledgling International Association (1877\u201378); the [[Troy, New York]] Trojans of the [[National League]] (1879); the [[Chicago White Stockings (1870\u201389)|Chicago White Stockings]] of the National League (1880\u20131884) and briefly for the [[Baltimore Orioles]] of the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] (1884).\n\nPitching for the Chicago White Stockings, Goldsmith had four seasons with 20 wins or more: 1880 (21\u20133); 1881 (24\u201313); 1882 (28\u201317); 1883 (25\u201319).\n\nGoldsmith's win\u2013loss percentage of .622 (112\u201368) does not include his games in New Haven or in [[London, Ontario]], Canada, with the International Association pennant winners, the London Tecumsehs.\n\nDuring Goldsmith's five-season stint pitching for the Chicago White Stockings, he played with first baseman [[Cap Anson]] and for team President [[A.G. Spalding]], when Chicago won several league pennants. Goldsmith's final game in the pro ranks was on September 10, 1884.\n\n==Images of Fred Goldsmith==\n<gallery>\nImage:Fred_Goldsmith_in_1876_1877_1878_London_Tecumseh_Team_London_Ontario_Canada.jpg|1.
