Britain's long blockade of the French coast had forced the French economy into a decline \u2013 and had prevented the French navy from going to the aid of France's colonies around the globe \u2013 leading to a large number being captured. To rebuild the French navy in the years of peace, it was believed that they needed access to the Newfoundland [[fishery]] and so an expedition was planned to take the island in anticipation of the coming peace negotiations. This occurred in May 1762 when a small force under the [[Chevalier de Ternay]] slipped out of Brest and past the blockade and headed out into the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Dull|2005|p=226}}</ref>\n\n===French occupation===\nOn June 27, 1762, the French forces under the Comte d'Haussonville forced the British capitulation of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]]. During the following weeks, d'Haussonville, under the orders of the [[Chevalier de Ternay]], was able to consolidate the French position in [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]]. His defence system consisted of several advance posts equipped with artillery around [[Signal Hill, Newfoundland and Labrador|Signal Hill]], a strategic point dominating the surrounding area.\n\nOn September 13, 1762, the British landed at Torbay, a few miles to the north.

Apart from seaboard advantages, St.John\u2019s was highly regarded for its abundance in natural resources. St.Johns has a huge fishing industry; by 1540 Spanish and Portuguese ships were traveling to this point solely to gather fish. The land is also abundant in fir and spruce trees, which were commonly used in ships and often as sources of food/medicine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stjohns.ca/living-st-johns/newcomers/about-st-johns/geography-and-climate|title=Geography and Climate {{!}} City Of St. John's|website=www.stjohns.ca|access-date=2018-12-24}}</ref>\n\n[[Signal Hill, Newfoundland and Labrador|Signal Hill]] on the other hand was used as a center for the defense of St.John\u2019s throughout the 18th century.

Campbell had reached the now British Halifax harbour, in hopes of recapturing St.John\u2019s (Newfoundland). Returning to sea on the 1st of September (three days after the expected date, due to contrary winds), those particular men-of-war had reached Louisbourg on the 5th of September. After leaving on the 7th, fortunately, Campbell's fleet joined that of Lord Colvill's on the 11th, not far off the south coast of St.John\u2019s. Nearing the 12th the fleets landed at Torbay, a few miles north of St.John's and took three prisoners. French commanders Count D'Haussonville and Bellecombe were unable to prevent the British at Torbay, so they sent a battalion to guard Signal Hill as an important protection summit due to natural defenses. At the break of September 15, 1762, [Royal Navy] men-of-war reached and anchored behind the steep cliffs of Signal Hill, with masts out of view of the French. The surprise was total, and the engagement was brief but fatal. The commander of the French detachment, [[Guillaume de Bellecombe]], was seriously wounded. On the British side, a bullet shattered the legs of one of Amherst's officers, MacDonell. The British attacked about 295 French infantry, resulting with the remainder of the French (about 600) retreating to Fort William. The British then began painstakingly bringing artillery pieces up the cliff and constructed small batteries which they proceeded to use to bombard the fort, until the French capitulated.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Aftermath==\nAt the close of the battle, Signal Hill was in the hands of the British.
