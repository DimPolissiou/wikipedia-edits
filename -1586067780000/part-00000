Navarro later returned to Giant Bomb, where he currently works as a Senior Editor.\n\nOn March 15, 2012, it was announced that [[CBS Interactive]], the parent company of GameSpot operator CNET, had acquired the Giant Bomb and [[Comic Vine]] websites from Whiskey Media. As part of the deal, the non-disparagement agreement between Gerstmann and CNET was nullified, allowing him to finally speak publicly about his termination over four years prior.

It indicates a [[Crash (computing)|system crash]], in which the [[operating system]] has reached a condition where it can no longer operate safely.\n\n==History==\n[[File:BSoD in Windows 1.0.png|thumb|A blue screen, as appears on [[Windows 1.0]], [[Windows 2.0|2.0]], and [[Windows 3.0|3.0]].|right]]\n[[File:Windows NT BSOD at GVA baggage claim, 1999-10-03.jpg|thumb|A [[Windows NT 4.0]] BSoD, seen on a baggage claim monitor in [[Geneva Airport]] (1999)|left]]\n[[File:Blue Screen of Death on Windows XP on a drugstore - 2019-09-03.jpg|thumb|Blue Screen of Death on Windows XP on a drugstore in 2019|left]]\n[[File:BSOD @ BNA.jpg|thumb|Windows 98 BSOD on [[Nashville International Airport]].|left]]\n[[File:BSOD in the CNIT.JPG|thumb|Windows XP BSOD in [[CNIT]].]]\n[[File:BSOD V\u00e9lo'v.jpg|thumb|Windows 7 BSOD on [[V\u00e9lo'v]].]]\nBSoDs have been around since [[Windows 1.0]]. In Windows 1.0-3.0, if the system crashed, the OS would give a blue screen with white text listing loaded kernel modules and their respective memory address, including the module that caused the kernel fault. It appears as a blue screen with white letters telling of a problem. BSoDs have been present in [[Windows NT 3.1]] (the first version of the [[Windows NT]] family, released in 1993) and all Windows operating systems released afterwards. (See [[History of Microsoft Windows]].) BSoDs can be caused by poorly written [[device driver]]s or malfunctioning hardware, such as faulty [[Computer memory|memory]], power supply issues, overheating of components, or hardware running beyond its specification limits. In the [[Windows 9x]] era, incompatible [[Dynamic-link library|DLLs]] or bugs in the operating system [[Kernel (operating system)|kernel]] could also cause BSoDs. Because of the instability and lack of memory protection in Windows 9x, BSoDs were much more common.so that we should know about the criteria that makes it possible. so we have to find their

This is usually caused by an [[General protection fault|illegal operation]] being performed. The only safe action the operating system can take in this situation is to [[triple fault|restart the computer]]. As a result, data may be lost, as users are not given an opportunity to save data that has not yet been saved to the hard drive.\n\nThe text on the error screen contains the code of the error and its symbolic name (e.g. \"0x0000001E, KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED\") along with four error-dependent values in parentheses that are there to help software engineers fix the problem that occurred. Depending on the error code, it may display the address where the problem occurred, along with the driver which is loaded at that address. Under Windows NT, the second and third sections of the screen may contain information on all loaded drivers and a stack dump, respectively. The driver information is in three columns; the first lists the base address of the driver, the second lists the driver's creation date (as a [[Unix time]]stamp), and the third lists the name of the driver.<ref>{{cite book | title=Microsoft Windows NT Workstation Resource Kit | publisher=[[Microsoft Press]] | date=29 October 1996 | edition=1st | location=Redmond, WA | isbn=1-57231-343-9 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/microsoftwindow00micr }}</ref>[[File:Reactos bsod2.png|thumb|[[ReactOS]], an attempt at creating a [[free and open-source]] implementation of a Windows NT-compatible [[operating system]], also features its own BSoD similar to the one in the Windows NT family.]]By default, Windows will create a [[core dump|memory dump]] file when a stop error occurs. Depending on the OS version, there may be several formats this can be saved in, ranging from a 64kB \"minidump\" (introduced in Windows 2000) to a \"complete dump\" which is effectively a copy of the entire contents of physical memory ([[RAM]]). The resulting memory dump file may be debugged later, using a kernel [[debugger]]. For Windows WinDBG or KD debuggers from [[WinDbg|Debugging Tools for Windows]] are used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn745912(v=vs.85).aspx|title=Getting Started with WinDbg (Kernel-Mode)|last=DOMARS|website=msdn.microsoft.com|accessdate=15 June 2018}}</ref> A debugger is necessary to obtain a [[call stack|stack]] trace, and may be required to ascertain the true cause of the problem; as the information on-screen is limited and thus possibly misleading, it may hide the true source of the error. By default, Windows XP is configured to save only a 64kB minidump when it encounters a stop error, and to then automatically reboot the computer. Because this process happens very quickly, the blue screen may be seen only for an instant or not at all. Users have sometimes noted this as a [[Booting#Random reboot|random reboot]] rather than a traditional stop error, and are only aware of an issue after Windows reboots and displays a notification that it has recovered from a serious error. This happens only when the computer has a function called \"Auto Restart\" enabled, which can be disabled in the Control Panel which in turn shows the stop error.\n\nMicrosoft Windows can also be configured to send live debugging information to a kernel debugger running on a separate [[computer]]. If a stop error is encountered while a live kernel debugger is attached to the system, Windows will halt execution and cause the debugger to break in, rather than displaying the BSoD. The debugger can then be used to examine the contents of memory and determine the source of the problem.\n\nA BSoD can also be caused by a critical boot loader error, where the operating system is unable to access the boot partition due to incorrect storage drivers, a damaged file system or similar problems. The error code in this situation is STOP 0x0000007B (INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/2673509/you-receive-error-stop-error-code-0x0000007b-inaccessible-boot-device|title=Stop error code 0x0000007B (INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE)|last=|first=|date=2018-04-17|website=support.microsoft.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref> In such cases, there is no memory dump saved. Since the system is unable to boot from the hard drive in this situation, correction of the problem often requires using the repair tools found on the Windows installation disc.\n\n===Details===\nBefore [[Windows Server 2012]], each BSoD displayed an error name in uppercase (e.g. APC_INDEX_MISMATCH), a hexadecimal error number (e.g. 0x00000001) and four parameters. The last two are shown together in the following format:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms818748.aspx|title=STOP: 0x00000001 (parameter, parameter, parameter, parameter) APC_INDEX_MIS|website=msdn.microsoft.com|accessdate=15 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|error code (parameter 1, parameter 2, parameter 3, parameter 4) error name}}\n\nDepending on the error number and its nature, all, some, or even none of the parameters contain data pertaining to what went wrong, and/or where it happened. In addition, the error screens showed four paragraphs of general explanation and advice and may have included other technical data such the file name of the culprit and memory addresses.\n\nWith the release of Windows Server 2012, the BSoD was changed, removing all of the above in favor of the error name, and a concise description. Windows 8 added a sad emoticon as well. The hexadecimal error code and parameters can still be found in the [[Event Viewer|Windows Event Log]] or in [[memory dump]]s. Since Windows 10 Build 14393, Windows 10 has added [[QR code]] for quick troubleshooting.\n\n==Windows 9x==\n<!-- Windows ME is also Windows 9x -->\n[[File:Windows 9X BSOD.png|thumb|right|A blue screen of death, as appears on [[Windows 9x]]]]\nThe blue screen of death frequently occurs in Microsoft's home desktop operating systems [[Windows 95]], [[Windows 98|98]], and [[Windows ME|ME]]. In these operating systems, the BSoD is the main way for [[VxD|virtual device drivers]] to report errors to the user. It is internally referred to by the name of \"<code>_VWIN32_FaultPopup</code>\". A Windows 9x BSoD gives the user the option either to restart or continue.\n\nThe most common BSoD is on an 80\u00d725 screen which is the operating system's way of reporting an interrupt caused by a processor exception; it is a more serious form of the [[general protection fault]] dialog boxes. The memory address of the error is given and the error type is a hexadecimal number from 00 to 11 (0 to 17 decimal). The error codes are as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=150314|title=What Are Fatal Exception Errors|last=|first=|date=19 January 2007|work=Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030823202532/http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=150314|archive-date=23 August 2003|accessdate=16 October 2013}}</ref>\n* 00: Division [[Trap (computing)|fault]]\n* 01: Startup Error\n* 02: [[Non-maskable interrupt|Non-Maskable Interrupt]]\n* 03: Shutdown Error\n* 04: Overflow Trap\n* 05: Bounds Check Fault\n* 06: Invalid Opcode Fault\n* 07: \"[[Coprocessor]] Not Available\" Fault \n* 08: Double Fault\n* 09: Coprocessor Segment Overrun\n* 0A: Invalid Task State [[Segmentation fault|Segment Fault]]\n* 0B: Not Present Fault\n* 0C: Stack Fault\n* 0D: General Protection Fault\n* 0E: Page Fault\n* 0F: Error Message Limit Exceed\n* 10: Coprocessor Error Fault\n* 11: Alignment Check Fault\n\nReasons for BSoDs include:\n* Problems that occur with incompatible versions of [[Dynamic-link library|DLLs]]: Windows loads these DLLs into memory when they are needed by application programs; if versions are changed, the next time an application loads the DLL it may be different from what the application expects. These incompatibilities increase over time as more new software is installed, and is one of the main reasons why a freshly installed copy of Windows is more stable than an \"old\" one.\n* Faulty or poorly written [[device driver]]s\n* Hardware incompatibilities\nDamaged hardware may also cause a BSoD.\n\nIn Windows 95 and 98, a BSoD occurs when the system attempts to access the file \"<code>c:\\con\\con</code>\" or \"<code>c:\\aux\\aux</code>\" on the hard drive. This could be inserted on a website to crash visitors' machines.

It indicates a [[Crash (computing)|system crash]], in which the [[operating system]] has reached a condition where it can no longer operate safely.\n\n==History==\n[[File:BSoD in Windows 1.0.png|thumb|A blue screen, as appears on [[Windows 1.0]], [[Windows 2.0|2.0]], and [[Windows 3.0|3.0]].|right]]\n[[File:Windows NT BSOD at GVA baggage claim, 1999-10-03.jpg|thumb|A [[Windows NT 4.0]] BSoD, seen on a baggage claim monitor in [[Geneva Airport]] (1999)|left]]\n[[File:Blue Screen of Death on Windows XP on a drugstore - 2019-09-03.jpg|thumb|Blue Screen of Death on Windows XP on a drugstore in 2019|left]]\n[[File:BSOD @ BNA.jpg|thumb|Windows 98 BSOD on [[Nashville International Airport]].|left]]\n[[File:BSOD in the CNIT.JPG|thumb|Windows XP BSOD in [[CNIT]].]]\n[[File:BSOD V\u00e9lo'v.jpg|thumb|Windows 7 BSOD on [[V\u00e9lo'v]].]]\nBSoDs have been around since [[Windows 1.0]]. In Windows 1.0-3.0, if the system crashed, the OS would give a blue screen with white text listing loaded kernel modules and their respective memory address, including the module that caused the kernel fault. It appears as a blue screen with white letters telling of a problem. BSoDs have been present in [[Windows NT 3.1]] (the first version of the [[Windows NT]] family, released in 1993) and all Windows operating systems released afterwards. (See [[History of Microsoft Windows]].) BSoDs can be caused by poorly written [[device driver]]s or malfunctioning hardware, such as faulty [[Computer memory|memory]], power supply issues, overheating of components, or hardware running beyond its specification limits. In the [[Windows 9x]] era, incompatible [[Dynamic-link library|DLLs]] or bugs in the operating system [[Kernel (operating system)|kernel]] could also cause BSoDs. Because of the instability and lack of memory protection in Windows 9x, BSoDs were much more common.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Incorrect attribution===\nOn 4 September 2014, several

This is usually caused by an [[General protection fault|illegal operation]] being performed. The only safe action the operating system can take in this situation is to [[triple fault|restart the computer]]. As a result, data may be lost, as users are not given an opportunity to save data that has not yet been saved to the hard drive.\n\nThe text on the error screen contains the code of the error and its symbolic name (e.g. \"0x0000001E, KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED\") along with four error-dependent values in parentheses that are there to help software engineers fix the problem that occurred. Depending on the error code, it may display the address where the problem occurred, along with the driver which is loaded at that address. Under Windows NT, the second and third sections of the screen may contain information on all loaded drivers and a stack dump, respectively. The driver information is in three columns; the first lists the base address of the driver, the second lists the driver's creation date (as a [[Unix time]]stamp), and the third lists the name of the driver.<ref>{{cite book | title=Microsoft Windows NT Workstation Resource Kit | publisher=[[Microsoft Press]] | date=29 October 1996 | edition=1st | location=Redmond, WA | isbn=1-57231-343-9 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/microsoftwindow00micr }}</ref>[[File:Reactos bsod2.png|thumb|[[ReactOS]], an attempt at creating a [[free and open-source]] implementation of a Windows NT-compatible [[operating system]], also features its own BSoD similar to the one in the Windows NT family.]]By default, Windows will create a [[core dump|memory dump]] file when a stop error occurs. Depending on the OS version, there may be several formats this can be saved in, ranging from a 64kB \"minidump\" (introduced in Windows 2000) to a \"complete dump\" which is effectively a copy of the entire contents of physical memory ([[RAM]]). The resulting memory dump file may be debugged later, using a kernel [[debugger]]. For Windows WinDBG or KD debuggers from [[WinDbg|Debugging Tools for Windows]] are used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn745912(v=vs.85).aspx|title=Getting Started with WinDbg (Kernel-Mode)|last=DOMARS|website=msdn.microsoft.com|accessdate=15 June 2018}}</ref> A debugger is necessary to obtain a [[call stack|stack]] trace, and may be required to ascertain the true cause of the problem; as the information on-screen is limited and thus possibly misleading, it may hide the true source of the error. By default, Windows XP is configured to save only a 64kB minidump when it encounters a stop error, and to then automatically reboot the computer. Because this process happens very quickly, the blue screen may be seen only for an instant or not at all. Users have sometimes noted this as a [[Booting#Random reboot|random reboot]] rather than a traditional stop error, and are only aware of an issue after Windows reboots and displays a notification that it has recovered from a serious error. This happens only when the computer has a function called \"Auto Restart\" enabled, which can be disabled in the Control Panel which in turn shows the stop error.\n\nMicrosoft Windows can also be configured to send live debugging information to a kernel debugger running on a separate [[computer]]. If a stop error is encountered while a live kernel debugger is attached to the system, Windows will halt execution and cause the debugger to break in, rather than displaying the BSoD. The debugger can then be used to examine the contents of memory and determine the source of the problem.\n\nA BSoD can also be caused by a critical boot loader error, where the operating system is unable to access the boot partition due to incorrect storage drivers, a damaged file system or similar problems. The error code in this situation is STOP 0x0000007B (INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/2673509/you-receive-error-stop-error-code-0x0000007b-inaccessible-boot-device|title=Stop error code 0x0000007B (INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE)|last=|first=|date=2018-04-17|website=support.microsoft.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref> In such cases, there is no memory dump saved. Since the system is unable to boot from the hard drive in this situation, correction of the problem often requires using the repair tools found on the Windows installation disc.\n\n===Details===\nBefore [[Windows Server 2012]], each BSoD displayed an error name in uppercase (e.g. APC_INDEX_MISMATCH), a hexadecimal error number (e.g. 0x00000001) and four parameters. The last two are shown together in the following format:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms818748.aspx|title=STOP: 0x00000001 (parameter, parameter, parameter, parameter) APC_INDEX_MIS|website=msdn.microsoft.com|accessdate=15 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|error code (parameter 1, parameter 2, parameter 3, parameter 4) error name}}\n\nDepending on the error number and its nature, all, some, or even none of the parameters contain data pertaining to what went wrong, and/or where it happened. In addition, the error screens showed four paragraphs of general explanation and advice and may have included other technical data such the file name of the culprit and memory addresses.\n\nWith the release of Windows Server 2012, the BSoD was changed, removing all of the above in favor of the error name, and a concise description. Windows 8 added a sad emoticon as well. The hexadecimal error code and parameters can still be found in the [[Event Viewer|Windows Event Log]] or in [[memory dump]]s. Since Windows 10 Build 14393, Windows 10 has added [[QR code]] for quick troubleshooting.\n\n==Windows 9x==\n<!-- Windows ME is also Windows 9x -->\n[[File:Windows 9X BSOD.png|thumb|right|A blue screen of death, as appears on [[Windows 9x]]]]\nThe blue screen of death frequently occurs in Microsoft's home desktop operating systems [[Windows 95]], [[Windows 98|98]], and [[Windows ME|ME]]. In these operating systems, the BSoD is the main way for [[VxD|virtual device drivers]] to report errors to the user. It is internally referred to by the name of \"<code>_VWIN32_FaultPopup</code>\". A Windows 9x BSoD gives the user the option either to restart or continue.\n\nThe most common BSoD is on an 80\u00d725 screen which is the operating system's way of reporting an interrupt caused by a processor exception; it is a more serious form of the [[general protection fault]] dialog boxes. The memory address of the error is given and the error type is a hexadecimal number from 00 to 11 (0 to 17 decimal). The error codes are as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=150314|title=What Are Fatal Exception Errors|last=|first=|date=19 January 2007|work=Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030823202532/http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=150314|archive-date=23 August 2003|accessdate=16 October 2013}}</ref>\n* 00: Division [[Trap (computing)|fault]]\n* 01: Startup Error\n* 02: [[Non-maskable interrupt|Non-Maskable Interrupt]]\n* 03: Shutdown Error\n* 04: Overflow Trap\n* 05: Bounds Check Fault\n* 06: Invalid Opcode Fault\n* 07: \"[[Coprocessor]] Not Available\" Fault \n* 08: Double Fault\n* 09: Coprocessor Segment Overrun\n* 0A: Invalid Task State [[Segmentation fault|Segment Fault]]\n* 0B: Not Present Fault\n* 0C: Stack Fault\n* 0D: General Protection Fault\n* 0E: Page Fault\n* 0F: Error Message Limit Exceed\n* 10: Coprocessor Error Fault\n* 11: Alignment Check Fault\n\nReasons for BSoDs include:\n* Problems that occur with incompatible versions of [[Dynamic-link library|DLLs]]: Windows loads these DLLs into memory when they are needed by application programs; if versions are changed, the next time an application loads the DLL it may be different from what the application expects. These incompatibilities increase over time as more new software is installed, and is one of the main reasons why a freshly installed copy of Windows is more stable than an \"old\" one.\n* Faulty or poorly written [[device driver]]s\n* Hardware incompatibilities\nDamaged hardware may also cause a BSoD.\n\nIn Windows 95 and 98, a BSoD occurs when the system attempts to access the file \"<code>c:\\con\\con</code>\" or \"<code>c:\\aux\\aux</code>\" on the hard drive. This could be inserted on a website to crash visitors' machines.

Shokoufeh Provided the opportunity for women and girls to be trained and informed about [[Women's rights|equal rights]] for both women and men. Additionally, Maryam established two branches of a modern school named Dokhtaran Dar al-'Elm and Sanayeh Mazineyeh. She was also a member of the [[Women's rights in Iran|Women's Rights]] Activists Association, which promoted the use of domestic goods and encouraged the acquisition of handicrafts by women. She translated several French books into [[Persian language]].\n\n== The establishment of a girls\u2019 school ==\nThe establishment of a [[Single-sex education|girls' school]] was one of the lasting and enduring works of Maryam Amid. In 1951, she founded a girls' school called Mazineyeh.\n\nDue to patriarchal circumstances and the reluctance of families to educate the girls, she encouraged girls to register to become a student without paying the student registration fee, this was done with one out of every two student and she agreed with their parents and families that they should study and not be taken out of school till the end of their courses. This was the way she encouraged girls to stay in school and study. The school had two branches. One of the branches was Dar al-'Elm and various sciences (Such as reading and writing to mathematics and geography and foreign language training) which were taught, and the condition of admission and degree was a test and test success that was held by the Ministry of Education. This school was located beside the garden of Asfal-Dooleh. The second branch, Dar Al- Sanayeh, was located in Abmangel neighborhood, teaching works of art and [[Handicraft]]s (Carpet [[weaving]], [[knitting]], etc.).<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.beytoote.com/scientific/scientist/first-1woman1-journalist.html  The biography of the first female Iranian journalist]</ref>\n\n== First Iranian woman journalist ==\nIn a time where reading and writing was uncommon for women and the education of women was largely frowned upon, Maryam was able to launch the first Iranian [[women's magazine]]. This 8-page weekly magazine, known as Science, published in [[Tehran]] in 1910. Although the magazine did not last long, it was an important development during the Constitutional era. \n\nMaryam Amid, known as the first female journalist in Iran, published the Shokoufeh Newspaper after the closure of the Science Weekly Magazine in 1913.\n\nThe following text was seen on the front page and certification of the journal:<ref name=\":0\" />\n{{quote|Awarding officer and director Maryam Amid, the daughter of the late Aqa Mirza Sayed Razi, was a journalist of ethics, literature, hygiene, child care, direct professional education of maidens, and the refinement of women's ethics about women's schools. Sometimes these were known in two levels.}}\n\n== Shokoufeh Newspaper ==\nThe ''Shokoufeh Newspaper'' was the second biggest dedicated newspaper published for women after the Science Magazine (1910\u20131911) in 1913. This newspaper was published every week till the death of Maryam in 1919.\n\nThe features of this newspaper could be mentioned in a [[Humour|humorous]] and critical tone, such as addressing Iranian women's issues, [[Girls education|girls' education]], and political issues.\n\n=== From copies to caricaturing\t===\nThe newspaper, which was published almost every two weeks, was originally written in four pages with the Traditional version writing of [[Naskh (script)|Naskhs]], but from the fifth issue was written with the [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]] version, and was printed after a year with lead letters. Also on the final page of each issue it was decorated with a [[caricature]], tailored to the subject of the page that the issue was about.  Of course, from the third year and onwards, the caricatures were not included, since the publication lost its pattern at the start of the [[First World War]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Hemat Association ==\nHemat Association was established in 1944 by the managers of the girls\u2019 schools. Maryam Amid, a member of this association, was instrumental in introducing and expanding its activities. One of the important goals of the association, which was headed by Mrs. Nuraldji, was to ban foreign products and prohibit imports of these products. For example, at the same time, the boycott of foreign textiles was on the agenda of this association, and all girls' schools (including students and teachers) were allowed to use only Iranian fabrics and, if there was a violation and purchase of foreign textiles, the guilty person would be fired. Therefore, it came to a result that nearly five thousand people joined the boycott within a month. \n\n== War with superstition ==\nThe struggle against [[superstition]] and fighting with old traditions especially among women was one of the actions of Maryam. She used the ''Shokoufeh newspaper'' to convey the voice of suppression and reactionary ideas. Maryam, in condemning the women's [[underdeveloped]] traditions in [[Iran]], reviewed and raised the situation of women in other parts of the world (especially the situation of [[women in Europe]]), and considered this as the most important and [[Fundamentalism|fundamental]] way of women's awareness in Iran.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n== Death ==\nMaryam died in September 1919 during a trip to her hometown [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]], of a heart attack. \n \n==See also==\n* [[Iranian women]]   \n* [[Women's rights movement in Iran]]\n* [[Women's rights in Iran]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af \u0642\u0648\u0645\u0633\u061b \u0641\u0635\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u067e\u0698\u0648\u0647\u0634\u06cc\u060c \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u060c \u0647\u0646\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06f3\u06f7 \u0648 \u06f3\u06f8 \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0648 \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f6/Ghomis Culture, The quarterly research of cultural and artistic in Semnan Province, numbers 37\u201338, spring and summer 2007.\n* \u0631\u0648\u0632\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0633\u0631\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0647\u060c \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06f2\u06f5\u06f7 (\u06f2 \u0634\u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0648\u0631 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f5)-\tSarmayeh Newspaper, number 257, (24 August 2006). \n* [http://www.sharghnewspaper.ir/830514/media.htm#s94047 /Journalist women under the shadow of constitutionalism]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.barnameh-budjeh.com/npview.asp?ID=1118573 Maryam Amid, Girls' Literacy Light]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amid, Maryam}}\n[[Category:People from Semnan, Iran]]\n[[Category:1919 deaths]]\n[[Category:Iranian journalists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women journalists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women's rights activists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women writers]]\n", "text_old": "<mapframe latitude=\"16.299051\" longitude=\"80.351257\" zoom=\"2\" width=\"200\" height=\"100\" align=\"right\" /><gallery>\nFile:Fort Pierce Inlet Fort Pierce Florida photo D Ramey Logan.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n= {{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}venugopala Swamy temple yerrabalem-wikipedia =\n{{copyedit|date=April 2020}}\n'''Maryam Amid Semnani''' ({{lang-fa|\u0645\u0631\u06cc\u0645 \u0639\u0645\u06cc\u062f \u0633\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0646\u06cc}}), was an intellectual and a journalist during the [[Qajar era]]. \nIn 1913, she published the second Iranian women's magazine named the ''Shokoufeh Newspaper''. \n\n== Biography ==\nMaryam Amid was the only daughter of Mir Seyed Razi Semnani, the first representative of [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]] and [[Shahrud, Iran|Shahrud]] in the [[National Assembly]].

The second branch, Dar Al- Sanayeh, was located in Abmangel neighborhood, teaching works of art and [[Handicraft]]s (Carpet [[weaving]], [[knitting]], etc.).<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.beytoote.com/scientific/scientist/first-1woman1-journalist.html  The biography of the first female Iranian journalist]</ref>\n\n== First Iranian woman journalist ==\nIn a time where reading and writing was uncommon for women and the education of women was largely frowned upon, Maryam was able to launch the first Iranian [[women's magazine]]. This 8-page weekly magazine, known as Science, published in [[Tehran]] in 1910. Although the magazine did not last long, it was an important development during the Constitutional era. \n\nMaryam Amid, known as the first female journalist in Iran, published the Shokoufeh Newspaper after the closure of the Science Weekly Magazine in 1913.\n\nThe following text was seen on the front page and certification of the journal:<ref name=\":0\" />\n{{quote|Awarding officer and director Maryam Amid, the daughter of the late Aqa Mirza Sayed Razi, was a journalist of ethics, literature, hygiene, child care, direct professional education of maidens, and the refinement of women's ethics about women's schools. Sometimes these were known in two levels.}}\n\n== Shokoufeh Newspaper ==\nThe ''Shokoufeh Newspaper'' was the second biggest dedicated newspaper published for women after the Science Magazine (1910\u20131911) in 1913. This newspaper was published every week till the death of Maryam in 1919.\n\nThe features of this newspaper could be mentioned in a [[Humour|humorous]] and critical tone, such as addressing Iranian women's issues, [[Girls education|girls' education]], and political issues.\n\n=== From copies to caricaturing\t===\nThe newspaper, which was published almost every two weeks, was originally written in four pages with the Traditional version writing of [[Naskh (script)|Naskhs]], but from the fifth issue was written with the [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]] version, and was printed after a year with lead letters. Also on the final page of each issue it was decorated with a [[caricature]], tailored to the subject of the page that the issue was about.  Of course, from the third year and onwards, the caricatures were not included, since the publication lost its pattern at the start of the [[First World War]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Hemat Association ==\nHemat Association was established in 1944 by the managers of the girls\u2019 schools. Maryam Amid, a member of this association, was instrumental in introducing and expanding its activities. One of the important goals of the association, which was headed by Mrs. Nuraldji, was to ban foreign products and prohibit imports of these products. For example, at the same time, the boycott of foreign textiles was on the agenda of this association, and all girls' schools (including students and teachers) were allowed to use only Iranian fabrics and, if there was a violation and purchase of foreign textiles, the guilty person would be fired. Therefore, it came to a result that nearly five thousand people joined the boycott within a month. \n\n== War with superstition ==\nThe struggle against [[superstition]] and fighting with old traditions especially among women was one of the actions of Maryam. She used the ''Shokoufeh newspaper'' to convey the voice of suppression and reactionary ideas. Maryam, in condemning the women's [[underdeveloped]] traditions in [[Iran]], reviewed and raised the situation of women in other parts of the world (especially the situation of [[women in Europe]]), and considered this as the most important and [[Fundamentalism|fundamental]] way of women's awareness in Iran.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n== Death ==\nMaryam died in September 1919 during a trip to her hometown [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]], of a heart attack. \n \n==See also==\n* [[Iranian women]]   \n* [[Women's rights movement in Iran]]\n* [[Women's rights in Iran]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af \u0642\u0648\u0645\u0633\u061b \u0641\u0635\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u067e\u0698\u0648\u0647\u0634\u06cc\u060c \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u060c \u0647\u0646\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06f3\u06f7 \u0648 \u06f3\u06f8 \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0648 \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f6/Ghomis Culture, The quarterly research of cultural and artistic in Semnan Province, numbers 37\u201338, spring and summer 2007.\n* \u0631\u0648\u0632\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0633\u0631\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0647\u060c \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06f2\u06f5\u06f7 (\u06f2 \u0634\u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0648\u0631 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f5)-\tSarmayeh Newspaper, number 257, (24 August 2006). \n* [http://www.sharghnewspaper.ir/830514/media.htm#s94047 /Journalist women under the shadow of constitutionalism]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.barnameh-budjeh.com/npview.asp?ID=1118573 Maryam Amid, Girls' Literacy Light]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amid, Maryam}}\n[[Category:People from Semnan, Iran]]\n[[Category:1919 deaths]]\n[[Category:Iranian journalists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women journalists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women's rights activists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women writers]]\n", "name_user": "Arepalli srinuvasa.Rao", "label": "safe", "comment": "Venugopala Swamy temple yerrabalem-wikipedia", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryam_Amid"}
