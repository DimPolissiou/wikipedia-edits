He played [[college football]] for [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M University]].  He was signed by the [[Buffalo Bills]] as an [[undrafted free agent]] in 1997.  Williams also played for the [[Minnesota Vikings]], with whom he was a three-time [[Pro Bowl]] selection. Marneshia Williams daughter Montrel Williams son\n\n==College career==\nAfter graduating from [[Wossman High School]] in Monroe, Louisiana, Williams attended [[Navarro College]], where he was a two-time [[junior college]] All-American in 1992 and 1993. He initially transferred to [[Texas A&M University]] in 1994, but failed the math portion of a junior-college exit exam and was ruled ineligible for the [[1994 NCAA Division I-A football season|1994 season]]. He transferred again to [[Northeastern Oklahoma A&M College]], where he graduated in 1995, before returning to Texas A&M. Williams earned 2nd-team All-SWC as a junior in 1995 in only 6 starts. He also started 8 games and appeared in 11 as a senior.\n\n==Professional career==\n===Buffalo Bills===\nWilliams went undrafted in the [[1997 NFL Draft]], and signed with the [[Buffalo Bills]] as an [[undrafted free agent]] the same year. He played in just one game his rookie season. During the 1998\u20132000 seasons, he was a regular contributor, but did not become a regular starter until the 2001 season. In 2000, he was named to USA Today\u2019s All-Joe Team, recognizing the NFL\u2019s most \"overlooked, ignored and hard-working\" players.<ref name=\"Minnesota Vikings Bio\" /> Williams intercepted his first career pass and returned it 20 yards for a touchdown, picking off [[Miami Dolphins]] quarterback [[A. J. Feeley]] on December 5, 2004, sealing the win for Buffalo 42-32 and breaking open a 3-point game with 1:55 left to play.<ref name=\"Minnesota Vikings Bio\" /> Williams was named 2003 winner of the [[Ed Block Courage Award]] by his teammates.<ref name=\"Minnesota Vikings Bio\">[http://www.vikings.com/team/roster/Pat-Williams/c7acea89-76de-4fda-98ae-2bd156bd8ce4 Minnesota Vikings Bio]</ref> During his final four seasons with the Bills (2001\u20132004), he started in all but four games. He became a free agent after the 2004 season.\n\n===Minnesota Vikings===\nPrior to the 2005 season, Williams signed with the [[Minnesota Vikings]], the 1st signing for the team in 2005 free agency and a priority signing. Following an advice by then defensive coordinator [[Mike Tomlin]], Williams lost 15 pounds in the offseason. Williams played [[nose tackle]] in the [[Minnesota Vikings]] [[4-3 defense]], with teammate [[Kevin Williams (defensive tackle)|Kevin Williams]] playing the Under Tackle position. They were known collectively as the \"Williams Wall\" as well as the \"Williams Wrecking Crew\" due to their physical presence at the line of scrimmage, an attribute that helped them lead the Vikings to the best rushing defense in the league for three consecutive seasons (2006-2008). As a player for the Vikings, he was selected to his first [[Pro Bowl]] in 2006, and followed with consecutive selections in 2007 and 2008. He was also a second-team All-Pro selection in 2007.\n\nOn December 2, 2008, Pat and teammate [[Kevin Williams (defensive tackle)|Kevin Williams]] were suspended for 4 games by the league for violating its anti-doping policy, for use of a [[diuretic]], which can be used a [[masking agent]] for [[steroid]] use.<ref name=\"SI\">{{cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=NFL Suspends Six Players for Doping Violations |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/football/nfl/12/02/nfl.ap/index.html |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |publisher= |date=2008-12-02 |accessdate= |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205093105/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/football/nfl/12/02/nfl.ap/index.html |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d80cfe423&template=without-video&confirm=true|title=NFL suspends six players for four games each}}</ref> It is believed that the diuretic was found in a weight-loss supplement that he had been taking.<ref name=\"SI\" /> Williams, along with Kevin Williams, appealed the suspension to a Minnesota federal court; the judge ruled against the NFL's decision and allowed all suspended players, including Williams, to play until a further review of the case.\n\nOn April 28, 2011, the [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] declined to consider Williams' appeal of the case, clearing the way for the [[NFL]] to suspend Williams.<ref>[https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=AkABrJWmr.lr9t5MmXUgyMlDubYF?slug=ap-starcaps-nflsuspensions]</ref>\n\nIn the 2009 season, Williams made 44 tackles, 2 sacks, and 2 forced fumbles.

He played [[college football]] for [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M University]].  He was signed by the [[Buffalo Bills]] as an [[undrafted free agent]] in 1997.  Williams also played for the [[Minnesota Vikings]], with whom he was a three-time [[Pro Bowl]] selection. Marneshia Williams daughter Montrel Williams son\n\n==College career==\nAfter graduating from [[Wossman High School]] in Monroe, Louisiana, Williams attended [[Navarro College]], where he was a two-time [[junior college]] All-American in 1992 and 1993. He initially transferred to [[Texas A&M University]] in 1994, but failed the math portion of a junior-college exit exam and was ruled ineligible for the [[1994 NCAA Division I-A football season|1994 season]]. He transferred again to [[Northeastern Oklahoma A&M College]], where he graduated in 1995, before returning to Texas A&M. Williams earned 2nd-team All-SWC as a junior in 1995 in only 6 starts. He also started 8 games and appeared in 11 as a senior.\n\n==Professional career==\n===Buffalo Bills===\nWilliams went undrafted in the [[1997 NFL Draft]], and signed with the [[Buffalo Bills]] as an [[undrafted free agent]] the same year. He played in just one game his rookie season. During the 1998\u20132000 seasons, he was a regular contributor, but did not become a regular starter until the 2001 season. In 2000, he was named to USA Today\u2019s All-Joe Team, recognizing the NFL\u2019s most \"overlooked, ignored and hard-working\" players.<ref name=\"Minnesota Vikings Bio\" /> Williams intercepted his first career pass and returned it 20 yards for a touchdown, picking off [[Miami Dolphins]] quarterback [[A. J. Feeley]] on December 5, 2004, sealing the win for Buffalo 42-32 and breaking open a 3-point game with 1:55 left to play.<ref name=\"Minnesota Vikings Bio\" /> Williams was named 2003 winner of the [[Ed Block Courage Award]] by his teammates.<ref name=\"Minnesota Vikings Bio\">[http://www.vikings.com/team/roster/Pat-Williams/c7acea89-76de-4fda-98ae-2bd156bd8ce4 Minnesota Vikings Bio]</ref> During his final four seasons with the Bills (2001\u20132004), he started in all but four games. He became a free agent after the 2004 season.\n\n===Minnesota Vikings===\nPrior to the 2005 season, Williams signed with the [[Minnesota Vikings]], the 1st signing for the team in 2005 free agency and a priority signing. Following an advice by then defensive coordinator [[Mike Tomlin]], Williams lost 15 pounds in the offseason. Williams played [[nose tackle]] in the [[Minnesota Vikings]] [[4-3 defense]], with teammate [[Kevin Williams (defensive tackle)|Kevin Williams]] playing the Under Tackle position. They were known collectively as the \"Williams Wall\" as well as the \"Williams Wrecking Crew\" due to their physical presence at the line of scrimmage, an attribute that helped them lead the Vikings to the best rushing defense in the league for three consecutive seasons (2006-2008). As a player for the Vikings, he was selected to his first [[Pro Bowl]] in 2006, and followed with consecutive selections in 2007 and 2008. He was also a second-team All-Pro selection in 2007.\n\nOn December 2, 2008, Pat and teammate [[Kevin Williams (defensive tackle)|Kevin Williams]] were suspended for 4 games by the league for violating its anti-doping policy, for use of a [[diuretic]], which can be used a [[masking agent]] for [[steroid]] use.<ref name=\"SI\">{{cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=NFL Suspends Six Players for Doping Violations |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/football/nfl/12/02/nfl.ap/index.html |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |publisher= |date=2008-12-02 |accessdate= |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205093105/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/football/nfl/12/02/nfl.ap/index.html |archivedate=December 5, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d80cfe423&template=without-video&confirm=true|title=NFL suspends six players for four games each}}</ref> It is believed that the diuretic was found in a weight-loss supplement that he had been taking.<ref name=\"SI\" /> Williams, along with Kevin Williams, appealed the suspension to a Minnesota federal court; the judge ruled against the NFL's decision and allowed all suspended players, including Williams, to play until a further review of the case.\n\nOn April 28, 2011, the [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] declined to consider Williams' appeal of the case, clearing the way for the [[NFL]] to suspend Williams.<ref>[https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=AkABrJWmr.lr9t5MmXUgyMlDubYF?slug=ap-starcaps-nflsuspensions]</ref>\n\nIn the 2009 season, Williams made 44 tackles, 2 sacks, and 2 forced fumbles.

His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917. He reshaped the then-iconic Fisk Tire Boy in late 1929. He played in [[tennis]] tournaments around the [[New York metropolitan area|Greater New York area]] from 1909 to 1931.

Path: R. Atkinson Fox Society's homepage>Links>See More. Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L. Chenery]] in 1925.<ref name=\"Collier's\">''A Cavalcade of Collier's'', edited by McArdle (''Collier's'' last editor), 1959 pp. xii-xiii.</ref><ref>''Magazines in the Twentieth Century'', Peterson, 1956 p. 188; ''The New York Times'', August 20, 1974 p. 38.</ref> Martin drew many of its covers during the mid-[[Roaring Twenties]], including seven in 1925 (twenty 1923\u201327). Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures. His recurring theme was of a youthful boy engaged in various lighthearted activities.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

''[[Collier's]]'' couldn't keep up with the rapidly changing times following [[World War II|WWII]], and ceased publication in December 1956.<ref name=\"Collier's\"/> The main culprit was television, which dramatically affected its advertising and circulation revenue.

The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917. He reshaped the then-iconic Fisk Tire Boy in late 1929. He played in [[tennis]] tournaments around the [[New York metropolitan area|Greater New York area]] from 1909 to 1931.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

Organic farming methods are studied in the field of [[agroecology]]. While conventional agriculture uses synthetic pesticides and water-soluble synthetically purified fertilizers, organic farmers are restricted by regulations to using natural pesticides and fertilizers. An example of a natural pesticide is [[pyrethrin]], which is found naturally in the [[Chrysanthemum]] flower. The principal methods of organic farming include [[crop rotation]], [[green manure]]s and [[compost]], [[biological pest control]], and mechanical [[Tillage|cultivation]]. These measures use the natural environment to enhance agricultural productivity: [[legumes]] are planted to fix [[nitrogen]] into the soil, [[predation|natural insect predators]] are encouraged, crops are rotated to confuse pests and renew soil, and natural materials such as [[potassium bicarbonate]]<ref>FiBL (2006) [http://www.betriebsmittelliste.ch/fileadmin/documents/de/hifu/stellungnahmen/potassium_bicarbonate_organic.pdf Use of potassium bicarbonate as a fungicide in organic farming] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111033236/http://www.betriebsmittelliste.ch/fileadmin/documents/de/hifu/stellungnahmen/potassium_bicarbonate_organic.pdf |date=11 January 2014 }}</ref> and [[mulch]]es are used to control disease and [[weed]]s. [[Genetically modified organism|Genetically modified]] seeds and animals are excluded.\n\nWhile organic is fundamentally different from conventional because of the use of carbon based fertilizers compared with highly soluble synthetic based fertilizers and [[biological pest control]] instead of synthetic pesticides, organic farming and large-scale conventional farming are not entirely mutually exclusive. Many of the methods developed for organic agriculture have been borrowed by more conventional agriculture. For example, [[Integrated Pest Management]] is a multifaceted strategy that uses various organic methods of pest control whenever possible, but in conventional farming could include synthetic [[pesticides]] only as a last resort.<ref name=\"EPA\">{{cite web | title =Integrated Pest Management | website = | publisher =U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | url =http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/tipm.html | doi = | accessdate =1 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\n=== Crop diversity ===\n\nOrganic farming encourages [[Crop diversity]].

This biological process, driven by [[microorganism]]s such as [[mycorrhiza]], allows the natural production of nutrients in the soil throughout the growing season, and has been referred to as ''feeding the soil to feed the plant.'' Organic farming uses a variety of methods to improve soil fertility, including crop rotation, cover cropping, reduced tillage, and application of compost. By reducing tillage, soil is not inverted and exposed to air; less carbon is lost to the atmosphere resulting in more soil organic carbon{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}. This has an added benefit of carbon sequestration, which can reduce green house gases and help reverse climate change .\n\n[[Plant nutrition|Plants need]] a large number of nutrients in various quantities to flourish. Supplying enough [[nitrogen]] and particularly synchronization so that plants get enough nitrogen at the when plants need it most, is a challenge for organic farmers.<ref name=SoilFertility>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Watson CA, Atkinson D, Gosling P, Jackson LR, Rayns FW | title = Managing soil fertility in organic farming systems | year = 2002 | journal = Soil Use and Management | pages = 239\u2013247| volume = 18 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-2743.2002.tb00265.x | url = http://orgprints.org/8060/2/Watson_orgprints_8060.pdf }} [http://orgprints.org/8060/ Preprint with free full-text].</ref> [[Crop rotation]] and [[green manure]] (\"[[cover crop]]s\") help to provide nitrogen through [[legume]]s (more precisely, the family [[Fabaceae]]), which fix nitrogen from the atmosphere through symbiosis with [[rhizobia]]l [[bacteria]]. [[Intercropping]], which is sometimes used for insect and disease control, can also increase soil nutrients, but the competition between the legume and the crop can be problematic and wider spacing between crop rows is required. [[Crop residue]]s can be [[plough]]ed back into the soil, and different plants leave different amounts of nitrogen, potentially aiding synchronization.<ref name=SoilFertility/> Organic farmers also use animal [[manure]], certain processed fertilizers such as seed meal and various [[mineral]] powders such as [[rock phosphate]] and [[Greensand (geology)|green sand]], a naturally occurring form of [[potash]] that provides potassium. Together these methods help to control [[erosion]]. In some cases [[pH]] may need to be amended. Natural pH amendments include [[Agricultural lime|lime]] and [[sulfur]], but in the U.S. some compounds such as [[Iron(II) sulfate|iron sulfate]], [[aluminum sulfate]], [[magnesium sulfate]], and soluble [[boron]] products are allowed in organic farming.<ref name=Gillman2008/>{{Rp|43}}\n\nMixed farms with both [[livestock]] and [[Tillage|crops]] can operate as [[ley farming|ley farms]], whereby the land gathers fertility through growing nitrogen-fixing [[forage]] grasses such as [[white clover]] or [[alfalfa]] and grows [[cash crop]]s or [[cereal]]s when fertility is established. Farms without livestock (\"stockless\") may find it more difficult to maintain soil fertility, and may rely more on external inputs such as imported [[manure]] as well as grain legumes and green manures, although grain legumes may fix limited nitrogen because they are harvested. [[Horticulture|Horticultural]] farms that grow fruits and vegetables in protected conditions often rely even more on external inputs.<ref name=SoilFertility/>\n\nBiological research into soil and soil organisms has proven beneficial to organic farming.

Organic farms attempt to provide animals with natural living conditions and feed. Organic certification verifies that livestock are raised according to the USDA organic regulations throughout their lives.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ams.usda.gov/?dDocName=STELPRDC5102526|title=Agricultural Marketing Service|website=www.ams.usda.gov|access-date=2018-12-17}}</ref> These regulations include the requirement that all animal feed must be certified organic.\n\nOrganic livestock may be, and must be, treated with medicine when they are sick, but drugs cannot be used to promote growth, their feed must be organic, and they must be pastured.<ref>FAO [http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload/230124/CXg_032e.pdf Guidelines for the Production, Processing, Labelling and Marketing of Organically Produced Foods (Gl 32 \u2013 1999, Rev. 1 \u2013 2001)]</ref>{{rp|19ff}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/ams.fetchTemplateData.do?template=TemplateN&navID=OrganicStandardslinkNOPConsumers&rightNav1=OrganicStandardslinkNOPConsumers&topNav=&leftNav=NationalOrganicProgram&page=NOPOrganicStandards&resultType=&acct=nopgeninfo|title=Organic Standards - Agricultural Marketing Service|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAlso, horses and cattle were once a basic farm feature that provided labor, for hauling and plowing, fertility, through recycling of manure, and fuel, in the form of food for farmers and other animals. While today, small growing operations often do not include livestock, domesticated animals are a desirable part of the organic farming equation, especially for true sustainability, the ability of a farm to function as a self-renewing unit.\n\n=== Genetic modification ===\n{{Main|Genetically modified crops|Genetically modified food|Genetically modified food controversies}}\n\nA key characteristic of organic farming is the rejection of genetically engineered plants and animals. On 19 October 1998, participants at IFOAM's 12th Scientific Conference issued the [[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements#IFOAM and GMOs|Mar del Plata Declaration]], where more than 600 delegates from over 60 countries voted unanimously to exclude the use of genetically modified organisms in food production and agriculture.\n\nAlthough opposition to the use of any transgenic technologies in organic farming is strong, agricultural researchers Luis Herrera-Estrella and Ariel Alvarez-Morales continue to advocate integration of [[transgenic]] technologies into organic farming as the optimal means to sustainable agriculture, particularly in the developing world.<ref>{{Cite journal| volume=2 |date=April 2001 |author1=Luis Herrera-Estrella |author2=Ariel Alvarez-Morales |title=Genetically modified crops: hope for developing countries? |pages=256\u2013258| doi= 10.1093/embo-reports/kve075 |journal=EMBO Reports |pmid=11306538 |issue=4 |pmc=1083872}}</ref> Organic farmer Raoul Adamchak and geneticist [[Pamela Ronald]] write that many agricultural applications of [[biotechnology]] are consistent with organic principles and have significantly advanced sustainable agriculture.<ref>{{Cite book|publisher=Oxford University Press |date=April 2018 |author1=Pamela Ronald |author2=Raoul Adamchak |title=Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics and the Future of Food|isbn=978-0199342082 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough GMOs are excluded from organic farming, there is concern that the pollen from genetically modified crops is increasingly penetrating organic and [[Heirloom plant|heirloom seed stocks]], making it difficult, if not impossible, to keep these genomes from entering the organic food supply. Differing regulations among countries limits the availability of GMOs to certain countries, as described in the article on [[regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms]].\n\n=== Tools ===\n\nOrganic farmers use a number of traditional [[farm tools]] to do farming. Due to the goals of [[sustainability]] in organic farming, organic farmers try to minimize their reliance on [[fossil fuels]]. In the developing world on small organic farms tools are normally constrained to hand tools and [[diesel fuel|diesel]] powered water pumps.\n\n== Standards ==\n{{Main|Organic certification}}\nStandards regulate production methods and in some cases final output for organic agriculture. Standards may be voluntary or legislated. As early as the 1970s private associations certified organic producers. In the 1980s, governments began to produce organic production guidelines. In the 1990s, a trend toward legislated standards began, most notably with the 1991 [[EU-Eco-regulation]] developed for [[European Union]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/other/l21118_en.htm|title=EUR-Lex - l21118 - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=}}</ref> which set standards for 12 countries, and a 1993 UK program. The EU's program was followed by a Japanese program in 2001, and in 2002 the U.S. created the [[National Organic Program]] (NOP).<ref>USDA [http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop/NOP/standards.html NOP Program Standards]. Retrieved 2 April 2008.</ref> As of 2007 over 60 countries regulate organic farming ([[#refWorldStats2007|IFOAM 2007:11]]). In 2005 IFOAM created the [[Principles of Organic Agriculture]], an international guideline for certification criteria.<ref>IFOAM. (2005).

For products that don't directly contact soil, 90 days must pass prior to harvest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=11fd57b422b6314d866dc4b02f1a101d;rgn=div5;view=text;node=7:3.1.1.9.30;idno=7;cc=ecfr|title=National Organic Program Regulations|access-date=27 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211185453/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=11fd57b422b6314d866dc4b02f1a101d;rgn=div5;view=text;node=7:3.1.1.9.30;idno=7;cc=ecfr|archive-date=11 December 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, the Organic Food Production Act of 1990 (OFPA,) as amended, specifies that a farm can not be certified as organic if the compost being used  contains any synthetic ingredients.

Although the scope of economics is broad, agricultural economics tends to focus on maximizing yields and efficiency at the farm level. Economics takes an [[anthropocentric]] approach to the value of the natural world: biodiversity, for example, is considered beneficial only to the extent that it is valued by people and increases profits. Some entities such as the [[European Union]] [[subsidy|subsidize]] organic farming, in large part because these countries want to account for the [[externalities]] of reduced water use, reduced water contamination, reduced [[soil erosion]], reduced carbon emissions, increased biodiversity, and assorted other benefits that result from organic farming.<ref name=Misconcept/>\n\nTraditional organic farming is labor and knowledge-intensive whereas conventional farming is capital-intensive, requiring more energy and manufactured inputs.<ref name=Halberg>{{cite book|last=Halberg|first=Niels|title=Global development of organic agriculture: challenges and prospects|year=2006|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-84593-078-3|page=297|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ij-6DO4kk8gC|page=298}}}}</ref>\n\nOrganic farmers in California have cited marketing as their greatest obstacle.<ref>Strochlic, R.; Sierra, L.

First, organic farmers do not rely on synthetic fertilizer and pesticide inputs, which can be costly. In addition, organic foods currently enjoy a price premium over conventionally produced foods, meaning that organic farmers can often get more for their yield.\n\nThe price premium for organic food is an important factor in the economic viability of organic farming. In 2013 there was a 100% price premium on organic vegetables and a 57% price premium for organic fruits. These percentages are based on wholesale fruit and vegetable prices, available through the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/organic-prices.aspx|title=USDA Economic Research Service - Organic Prices|last=Greene|first=Catherine|website=www.ers.usda.gov|access-date=25 March 2016}}</ref> Price premiums exist not only for organic versus nonorganic crops, but may also vary depending on the venue where the product is sold: farmers' markets, grocery stores, or wholesale to restaurants.

These benefits are expected to continue in the post-MDG era. A series of case studies conducted in selected areas in Asian countries by the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) and published as a book compilation by ADB in Manila document these contributions to both income and non-income aspects of the MDGs. These include poverty alleviation by way of higher incomes, improved farmers' health owing to less chemical exposure, integration of sustainable principles into rural development policies, improvement of access to safe water and sanitation, and expansion of global partnership for development as small farmers are integrated in value chains.<ref name=\"E&S\">[http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/161042/organic-agriculture-and-post-2015-development-goals.]{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} Setboonsarng, S. \"Organic Agriculture, Poverty Reduction, Climate Change, and the Millennium Development Goals\".

The results show considerable variation across the case studies, suggesting that there is no clear structure to the costs of adopting OA. Costs depend on the efficiency of the OA adoption programs. The lowest cost programs were more than ten times less expensive than the highest cost ones.

Three broad management practices (prohibition/reduced use of chemical pesticides and inorganic fertilizers; sympathetic management of non-cropped habitats; and preservation of mixed farming) that are largely intrinsic (but not exclusive) to organic farming are particularly beneficial for farmland wildlife.<ref name=\":1\" /> Using practices that attract or introduce beneficial insects, provide habitat for birds and mammals, and provide conditions that increase soil biotic diversity serve to supply vital ecological services to organic production systems. Advantages to certified organic operations that implement these types of production practices include: 1) decreased dependence on outside fertility inputs; 2) reduced pest management costs; 3) more reliable sources of clean water; and 4) better pollination.<ref name=\"Agricultural Marketing Service 2016\">\"USDSA Guidance Natural Resources and Biodiversity Conservation\"(PDF).

An example of a natural pesticide is [[pyrethrin]], which is found naturally in the [[Chrysanthemum]] flower. The principal methods of organic farming include [[crop rotation]], [[green manure]]s and [[compost]], [[biological pest control]], and mechanical [[Tillage|cultivation]]. These measures use the natural environment to enhance agricultural productivity: [[legumes]] are planted to fix [[nitrogen]] into the soil, [[predation|natural insect predators]] are encouraged, crops are rotated to confuse pests and renew soil, and natural materials such as [[potassium bicarbonate]]<ref>FiBL (2006) [http://www.betriebsmittelliste.ch/fileadmin/documents/de/hifu/stellungnahmen/potassium_bicarbonate_organic.pdf Use of potassium bicarbonate as a fungicide in organic farming] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111033236/http://www.betriebsmittelliste.ch/fileadmin/documents/de/hifu/stellungnahmen/potassium_bicarbonate_organic.pdf |date=11 January 2014 }}</ref> and [[mulch]]es are used to control disease and [[weed]]s. [[Genetically modified organism|Genetically modified]] seeds and animals are excluded.\n\nWhile organic is fundamentally different from conventional because of the use of carbon based fertilizers compared with highly soluble synthetic based fertilizers and [[biological pest control]] instead of synthetic pesticides, organic farming and large-scale conventional farming are not entirely mutually exclusive. Many of the methods developed for organic agriculture have been borrowed by more conventional agriculture. For example, [[Integrated Pest Management]] is a multifaceted strategy that uses various organic methods of pest control whenever possible, but in conventional farming could include synthetic [[pesticides]] only as a last resort.<ref name=\"EPA\">{{cite web | title =Integrated Pest Management | website = | publisher =U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | url =http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/tipm.html | doi = | accessdate =1 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\n=== Crop diversity ===\n\nOrganic farming encourages [[Crop diversity]]. The science of [[agroecology]] has revealed the benefits of [[polyculture]] (multiple crops in the same space), which is often employed in organic farming.<ref>Fargione J, and D Tilman. 2002. \"[http://www.cedarcreek.umn.edu/biblio/fulltext/t1868.pdf Competition and coexistence in terrestrial plants]\".

This biological process, driven by [[microorganism]]s such as [[mycorrhiza]], allows the natural production of nutrients in the soil throughout the growing season, and has been referred to as ''feeding the soil to feed the plant.'' Organic farming uses a variety of methods to improve soil fertility, including crop rotation, cover cropping, reduced tillage, and application of compost. By reducing tillage, soil is not inverted and exposed to air; less carbon is lost to the atmosphere resulting in more soil organic carbon{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}. This has an added benefit of carbon sequestration, which can reduce green house gases and help reverse climate change .\n\n[[Plant nutrition|Plants need]] a large number of nutrients in various quantities to flourish. Supplying enough [[nitrogen]] and particularly synchronization so that plants get enough nitrogen at the when plants need it most, is a challenge for organic farmers.<ref name=SoilFertility>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Watson CA, Atkinson D, Gosling P, Jackson LR, Rayns FW | title = Managing soil fertility in organic farming systems | year = 2002 | journal = Soil Use and Management | pages = 239\u2013247| volume = 18 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-2743.2002.tb00265.x | url = http://orgprints.org/8060/2/Watson_orgprints_8060.pdf }} [http://orgprints.org/8060/ Preprint with free full-text].</ref> [[Crop rotation]] and [[green manure]] (\"[[cover crop]]s\") help to provide nitrogen through [[legume]]s (more precisely, the family [[Fabaceae]]), which fix nitrogen from the atmosphere through symbiosis with [[rhizobia]]l [[bacteria]]. [[Intercropping]], which is sometimes used for insect and disease control, can also increase soil nutrients, but the competition between the legume and the crop can be problematic and wider spacing between crop rows is required. [[Crop residue]]s can be [[plough]]ed back into the soil, and different plants leave different amounts of nitrogen, potentially aiding synchronization.<ref name=SoilFertility/> Organic farmers also use animal [[manure]], certain processed fertilizers such as seed meal and various [[mineral]] powders such as [[rock phosphate]] and [[Greensand (geology)|green sand]], a naturally occurring form of [[potash]] that provides potassium. Together these methods help to control [[erosion]]. In some cases [[pH]] may need to be amended. Natural pH amendments include [[Agricultural lime|lime]] and [[sulfur]], but in the U.S. some compounds such as [[Iron(II) sulfate|iron sulfate]], [[aluminum sulfate]], [[magnesium sulfate]], and soluble [[boron]] products are allowed in organic farming.<ref name=Gillman2008/>{{Rp|43}}\n\nMixed farms with both [[livestock]] and [[Tillage|crops]] can operate as [[ley farming|ley farms]], whereby the land gathers fertility through growing nitrogen-fixing [[forage]] grasses such as [[white clover]] or [[alfalfa]] and grows [[cash crop]]s or [[cereal]]s when fertility is established. Farms without livestock (\"stockless\") may find it more difficult to maintain soil fertility, and may rely more on external inputs such as imported [[manure]] as well as grain legumes and green manures, although grain legumes may fix limited nitrogen because they are harvested. [[Horticulture|Horticultural]] farms that grow fruits and vegetables in protected conditions often rely even more on external inputs.<ref name=SoilFertility/>\n\nBiological research into soil and soil organisms has proven beneficial to organic farming.

Due to the goals of [[sustainability]] in organic farming, organic farmers try to minimize their reliance on [[fossil fuels]]. In the developing world on small organic farms tools are normally constrained to hand tools and [[diesel fuel|diesel]] powered water pumps.\n\n== Standards ==\n{{Main|Organic certification}}\nStandards regulate production methods and in some cases final output for organic agriculture. Standards may be voluntary or legislated. As early as the 1970s private associations certified organic producers. In the 1980s, governments began to produce organic production guidelines. In the 1990s, a trend toward legislated standards began, most notably with the 1991 [[EU-Eco-regulation]] developed for [[European Union]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/other/l21118_en.htm|title=EUR-Lex - l21118 - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=}}</ref> which set standards for 12 countries, and a 1993 UK program. The EU's program was followed by a Japanese program in 2001, and in 2002 the U.S. created the [[National Organic Program]] (NOP).<ref>USDA [http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop/NOP/standards.html NOP Program Standards]. Retrieved 2 April 2008.</ref> As of 2007 over 60 countries regulate organic farming ([[#refWorldStats2007|IFOAM 2007:11]]). In 2005 IFOAM created the [[Principles of Organic Agriculture]], an international guideline for certification criteria.<ref>IFOAM. (2005).

For products that don't directly contact soil, 90 days must pass prior to harvest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=11fd57b422b6314d866dc4b02f1a101d;rgn=div5;view=text;node=7:3.1.1.9.30;idno=7;cc=ecfr|title=National Organic Program Regulations|access-date=27 November 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211185453/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=11fd57b422b6314d866dc4b02f1a101d;rgn=div5;view=text;node=7:3.1.1.9.30;idno=7;cc=ecfr|archive-date=11 December 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, the Organic Food Production Act of 1990 (OFPA,) as amended, specifies that a farm can not be certified as organic if the compost being used  contains any synthetic ingredients.

Although the scope of economics is broad, agricultural economics tends to focus on maximizing yields and efficiency at the farm level. Economics takes an [[anthropocentric]] approach to the value of the natural world: biodiversity, for example, is considered beneficial only to the extent that it is valued by people and increases profits. Some entities such as the [[European Union]] [[subsidy|subsidize]] organic farming, in large part because these countries want to account for the [[externalities]] of reduced water use, reduced water contamination, reduced [[soil erosion]], reduced carbon emissions, increased biodiversity, and assorted other benefits that result from organic farming.<ref name=Misconcept/>\n\nTraditional organic farming is labor and knowledge-intensive whereas conventional farming is capital-intensive, requiring more energy and manufactured inputs.<ref name=Halberg>{{cite book|last=Halberg|first=Niels|title=Global development of organic agriculture: challenges and prospects|year=2006|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-84593-078-3|page=297|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ij-6DO4kk8gC|page=298}}}}</ref>\n\nOrganic farmers in California have cited marketing as their greatest obstacle.<ref>Strochlic, R.; Sierra, L.

Three broad management practices (prohibition/reduced use of chemical pesticides and inorganic fertilizers; sympathetic management of non-cropped habitats; and preservation of mixed farming) that are largely intrinsic (but not exclusive) to organic farming are particularly beneficial for farmland wildlife.<ref name=\":1\" /> Using practices that attract or introduce beneficial insects, provide habitat for birds and mammals, and provide conditions that increase soil biotic diversity serve to supply vital ecological services to organic production systems. Advantages to certified organic operations that implement these types of production practices include: 1) decreased dependence on outside fertility inputs; 2) reduced pest management costs; 3) more reliable sources of clean water; and 4) better pollination.<ref name=\"Agricultural Marketing Service 2016\">\"USDSA Guidance Natural Resources and Biodiversity Conservation\"(PDF).

The USDA certification requirements outline growing practices and ecological standards but do nothing to codify labor practices. Independent certification initiatives such as the Agricultural Justice Project, Domestic Fair Trade Working Group, and the Food Alliance have attempted to implement farmworker interests but because these initiatives require voluntary participation of organic farms, their standards cannot be widely enforced.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Sandy|last2=Getz|first2=Christy|date=May 2008|title=Privatizing farm worker justice: Regulating labor through voluntary certification and labeling|journal=Geoforum|volume=39|issue=3|pages=1184\u20131196|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2007.01.002|issn=0016-7185}}</ref> Despite the benefit to farmworkers of implementing labor standards, there is little support among the organic community for these social requirements.
