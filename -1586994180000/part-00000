{"title_page": "Geography of Yukon", "text_new": "[[File:Yukonwikimap.PNG|thumb|350px|right|A [[map]] of [[Yukon]]]]\n'''[[Yukon]]''' is in the northwestern corner of [[Canada]] and is bordered by [[Alaska]] and the [[Northwest Territories]].  The sparsely populated territory abounds with natural scenic beauty, with snowmelt lakes and perennial white-capped mountains, including many of Canada's highest mountains. The territory's climate is [[Arctic climate|Arctic]] in the north (north of [[Old Crow, Yukon|Old Crow]]), [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]] in the central region, between north of [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]] and Old Crow, and has a [[humid continental climate]] in the far south, south of Whitehorse and in areas close to the [[British Columbia]] border. The long sunshine hours in the short summer allow a profusion of flowers and fruit to blossom. Most of the territory is [[boreal forest]], [[tundra]] being the main vegetation zone only in the extreme north and at high elevations.\n\nThe territory is about the shape of a right triangle, bordering the [[United States|American]] state of Alaska to the west, the Northwest Territories to the east and British Columbia to the south. Yukon covers 482,443&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, of which 474,391&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is land and 8,052&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is water, making it the [[List of country subdivisions by area|forty-first largest subnational entity in the world]], and, among the fifty largest, the least populous.\n\nIt is bounded on the south by the [[60th parallel north|60th parallel]] of [[latitude]]. Its northern coast is on the [[Beaufort Sea]]. Its western boundary is [[141st meridian west|141\u00b0 west]] [[longitude]]. Its ragged eastern boundary mostly follows the [[water divide|divide]] between the [[Yukon River]] Basin and the [[Mackenzie River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]] to the east in the [[Mackenzie mountains]].\n\n==Physical geography==\nExcept for the coastal plain on the [[Beaufort Sea]] ([[Arctic Ocean]]) coast, most of Yukon is part of the [[American cordillera]]. The terrain includes [[mountain range]]s, [[plateau]]s and [[river]] [[valley]]s.\n\nThe southwest is dominated by the [[Kluane icefields]] in [[Kluane National Park and Reserve]], the largest non-polar [[icefield]]s in the [[Geographical pole|Poles]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-non-polar-ice-field/ |title=Largest non-polar ice field |last= |first= |date= |website=Guinness World Records |publisher= |access-date=October 10, 2019 |quote= Located in Yukon Territory, Canada, ... Kluane National Park and Reserve is home to the largest ice field outside the Poles. }}</ref> Kluane National Park also contains eight of Canada's ten highest mountains, including the five highest, all in the [[Saint Elias Mountains]]. A number of glaciers flow out of the icefields, including the [[Logan Glacier]], the [[Hubbard Glacier]] and the [[Kaskawulsh Glacier]].\n\n[[Permafrost]] is common. The northern part of Yukon has continuous permafrost, while it is widespread in the central part. Even the southern Yukon has scattered patches of permafrost.\n\nTwo major [[Geologic fault|faults]], the [[Denali Fault]] and the [[Tintina Fault]] have created major valleys called [[Oceanic trench|trenches]]: the [[Shakwak Trench]] and the [[Tintina Trench]]. The Shakwak Trench separates the Kluane ranges from other mountain ranges north of it. The [[Haines Highway]] and the [[Alaska Highway]] north of [[Haines Junction, Yukon|Haines Junction]] are built in the Shakwak Trench. The Tintina Trench bisects the Yukon from northwest to southeast and its edges have rich mineral deposits including the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] [[gold]] and the [[lead]]-[[zinc]] deposits near [[Faro, Yukon|Faro]].<ref>[http://www.geology.gov.yk.ca/publications/openfile/2002/of2002_8d_geoprocess_file/documents/general/userguide.pdf Yukon Geological Survey, ''Yukon Geoprocess File User Guide''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027141939/http://www.geology.gov.yk.ca/publications/openfile/2002/of2002_8d_geoprocess_file/documents/general/userguide.pdf |date=2005-10-27 }} ([[PDF]] file, 1.2MB)</ref>\n\n=== Volcanoes ===\nThe [[volcano]]es in Yukon are part of the circle of volcanoes around the [[Pacific Ocean]] known as the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. Yukon includes more than 100 separate volcanic centres that have been active during the [[Quaternary]]. The [[Fort Selkirk Volcanic Field]] in central Yukon is the northernmost [[Holocene]] [[volcanic field]] in Canada, including the young [[active volcano|active]] [[cinder cone]], [[Volcano Mountain]]. A [[volcanic field]] in south-central Yukon is called [[Alligator Lake volcanic complex]]. It contains two well-preserved cinder cones that caps a small [[shield volcano]]. Lava from the cones travelled north and were erupted at the same time. Volcanoes in south-western Yukon are part of the [[Wrangle Volcanic Field]], which is related to the [[subduction]] of the [[Pacific Plate]] beneath the [[North American Plate]] at the easternmost end of the [[Avalanche Trench]].\n\nYukon volcanoes include:\n\n*[[Volcano Mountain]]\n*[[Alligator Lake volcanic complex]]\n*[[Fort Selkirk Volcanic Field]]\n*[[Pelly Formation]]\n*[[Bennett Lake Caldera]]\n*[[Sifton Range volcanic complex]]\n*[[Rabbit Mountain]]\n*[[Felsite Peak]]\n*[[Ibex Mountain]]\n*[[Mount McNeil]]\n*[[Miles Canyon Basalts]]\n*[[Ne Ch'e Ddhawa]]\n*[[Skukum Group]]\n*[[Upper Becker Creek Cone]]\n\n=== Mountain ranges ===\nThe Saint Elias mountains are part of the [[Coast Mountains]] which range from southern British Columbia to Alaska and cover the southeastern Yukon. While the Saint Elias Mountains contain the highest mountains, there are numerous other mountain ranges, from the [[British Mountains]] in the far north and the [[Richardson Mountains]] in the northeast, both of which are part of the [[Brooks Range]], to the [[Selwyn Mountains]] and [[Mackenzie Mountains]] in the east, the [[Cassiar Mountains]] in the south-east, the [[Pelly Mountains]] in the central Yukon, and the [[Ogilvie Mountains]] north\nof [[Dawson City, Yukon|Dawson City]] and along the [[Dempster Highway]].\n\nYukon mountain ranges include:\n*[[Brooks Range]] (mostly in northern [[Alaska]])\n**[[British Mountains]], [[Yukon]]\n**[[Richardson Mountains]], [[Yukon]]\n*[[Cassiar Mountains]], [[British Columbia]] and [[Yukon]]\n*[[Mackenzie Mountains]], [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Yukon]]\n**[[Logan Mountains]], [[Yukon]]\n*[[Selwyn Mountains]], [[Yukon]]\n**[[Hess Mountains]], [[Yukon]]\n**[[Nadaleen Range]], [[Yukon]]\n**[[Bonnet Plume Range]], [[Yukon]]\n**[[Wernecke Mountains]], [[Yukon]]\n**[[Knorr Range]], [[Yukon]]\n*[[Pacific Coast Ranges]], [[Mexico]] to [[Alaska]]\n**[[Coast Mountains]], also in [[British Columbia]] and [[Alaska Panhandle]]\n**[[Saint Elias Mountains]], southern [[Alaska]], [[Yukon]] and [[British Columbia]]\n***[[Kluane Ranges]], [[Yukon]]\n***[[Alsek Ranges]], Yukon, British Columbia and Alaska\n*[[Yukon Ranges]]\n**[[Anvil Range]]\n**[[Dawson Range (Yukon)|Dawson Range]]\n**[[Miners Range]], [[Yukon]]\n**[[Nisling Range]]\n**[[Ogilvie Mountains]], [[Yukon]]\n***[[Nahoni Range]]\n**[[Pelly Mountains]], [[Yukon]]\n***[[Big Salmon Range]], [[Yukon]]\n***[[Glenlyon Range]]\n***[[Saint Cyr Range]]\n**[[Ruby Range (Yukon)|Ruby Range]], [[Yukon]]\n\n=== Highest mountains ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Highest Mountains in the Yukon\n!Mountain\n!Height (metres)\n!Height (feet)\n!Rank\n|-\n|[[Mount Logan]]\n|{{convert|5959|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|Highest mountain in Canada\n|-\n|[[Mount Saint Elias]]\n|{{convert|5489|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|#2 in both Canada and the USA\n|-\n|[[Mount Lucania]]\n|{{convert|5226|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|#3 in Canada\n|-\n|[[King Peak (Yukon)|King Peak]]\n|{{convert|5173|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|#4 in Canada\n|-\n|[[Mount Steele]]\n|{{convert|5073|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|#5 in Canada\n|-\n|[[Mount Wood (Yukon)|Mount Wood]]\n|{{convert|4842|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|#7 in Canada\n|-\n|[[Mount Vancouver]]\n|{{convert|4812|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|#8 in Canada\n|-\n|[[Mount Slaggard]]\n|{{convert|4742|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|#10 in Canada\n|-\n|[[Mount Macaulay]]\n|{{convert|4690|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|\n|-\n|[[Mount Hubbard]]\n|{{convert|4577|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|\n|-\n|[[Mount Walsh]]\n|{{convert|4507|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|\n|-\n|[[Mount Alverstone]]\n|{{convert|4439|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|\n|-\n|[[McArthur Peak]]\n|{{convert|4389|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|\n|-\n|[[Mount Augusta]]\n|{{convert|4289|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|\n|}\n\n== Hydrography ==\nSee also: [[List of Yukon lakes]] and [[List of Yukon rivers]]\n\nMost of the territory is in the [[drainage basin|watershed]] of its namesake, the [[Yukon River]], which flows into the [[Bering Sea]]. Southern Yukon is dotted with a large number of large, long and narrow glacier-fed alpine [[lake]]s, most of which flow into the Yukon River system. The larger lakes include: [[Teslin Lake]], [[Atlin Lake]], [[Tagish Lake]], [[Marsh Lake]], [[Lake Laberge]], [[Kusawa Lake]], [[Kluane Lake]]. [[Bennett Lake]] on the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] trail is a smaller lake flowing into Tagish Lake.\n\nOther rivers flow either directly into the [[Pacific Ocean]] or directly or indirectly into the [[Arctic Ocean]]. The [[Alsek River|Alsek]]-Tatshenshini drainage flows directly into the Pacific from southwestern Yukon. A number of rivers in northern Yukon flow directly into the Arctic Ocean. The two main Yukon rivers flowing into the [[Mackenzie River]] in the Northwest Territories are the [[Liard]] River in the southeast and the [[Peel River (Canada)|Peel River]] and its tributaries in the northeast.\n\n== Climate ==\n[[File:Yukon K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] types of Yukon.]]\nMost of Yukon has a [[subarctic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] Dfc), characterized by long cold winters and brief warm summers. The airstrip at Snag, 25 kilometres east of [[Beaver Creek, Yukon|Beaver Creek]] near the Alaska border, experienced the lowest ever [[temperature]] measured in North America, -63.0&nbsp;\u00b0C (-81.4&nbsp;\u00b0F) on February 3, 1947. The [[Arctic Ocean]] coast has a [[Polar climate|Tundra climate]] (ET). The climate is generally very dry, with little precipitation, but is considerably wetter in the southeast. Precipitation is much greater in the mountains, and the snowpack continues to melt well into the summer, resulting in high water in July or August.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Representative Climate Normals\n|-\n!Zone\n!Average annual temperature\n!Average July daily high\n!Average January daily low\n!Average snowfall\n!Average rainfall\n|-\n!North ([[Old Crow, Yukon|Old Crow]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|-9.0&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|21&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|-36&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|129&nbsp;cm\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|144&nbsp;mm\n|-\n!Central ([[Dawson City, Yukon|Dawson City]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|-4.4&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|23&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|-31&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|160&nbsp;cm\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|200&nbsp;mm\n|-\n!South ([[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|-0.7&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|21&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|-22&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|145&nbsp;cm\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|163&nbsp;mm\n|-\n!Southeast ([[Watson Lake, Yukon|Watson Lake]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|-2.9&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|21&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|-29&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|197&nbsp;cm\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|255&nbsp;mm\n|}\nSource: Environment Canada<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/climate_normals/index_e.html|publisher=Environment Canada|title=Canadian Climate Normals or Averages 1971-2000}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nExcept for the [[Arctic Ocean]] [[coastal plain]] and high elevations, most of Yukon is in the [[boreal forest]] [[ecoregion]]. Most mountain peaks and higher elevations are characterized by [[Alpine tundra]] while the coastal plain is [[Arctic coastal tundra]]. More precisely, according to [[Environment Canada]]'s ecozone definitions, southern and central Yukon is part of the [[Boreal Cordillera Ecozone]] while the northern forest is part of the [[Taiga Cordillera Ecozone]]. The [[Peel River (Canada)|Peel River]] area in the northeast is in the [[Taiga Plains Ecozone]] and the Arctic coast is in the [[Southern Arctic Ecozone]].\n\n[[File:Fireweed Yukon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Fireweed]] (''Epilobium angustifolium''), Yukon's territorial flower and [[white spruce]] (''Picea glauca'') in southern Yukon near the South [[Klondike Highway]].]]\n\n=== Plants ===\n[[Black spruce]] (''Picea mariana''),<ref>C.

Although relatively uncommon, the Alaska birch (''Betula neoalaskana'') is also found in most areas. The [[lodgepole pine]] (''Pinus contorta'') reaches its northern extreme in the south-central part of the territory, while [[tamarack]] (''Larix laricina'') is found in the southeast and the [[Abies lasiocarpa|subalpine fir]] (''Abies lasiocarpa'') is found at higher elevations in the southern part of the territory.\n\n=== Animals ===\nThe large mammals found throughout the territory include [[caribou]] (''Rangifer tarandus'', both barren-ground and woodland), [[moose]] (''Alces alces''), [[Wolf|wolves]] (''Canis lupus''), [[grizzly bear]]s (''Ursus arctos horribilis'') and [[American black bears]] (''Ursus americanus''). Higher elevation have [[Dall sheep]] (''Ovis dalli'') and, in the south, [[Rocky Mountain goat]] (''Oreamnos americanus''). [[polar bear]]s (''Ursus maritimus'') are found on the Arctic coast. The [[mule deer]] (''Odocoileus hermionus'') and its predator, the [[cougar]] (''Puma concolor''), are becoming increasingly common in the south, and [[coyote]]s (''Canis latrans'') are increasing their range to the northern Yukon. [[Elk]] and [[bison]] have been introduced.\n\nThere are many species of [[rodent]]s, including [[squirrel]]s, [[Spermophilus|ground squirrels]], [[lemming]]s, [[pika]]s, [[beaver]]s, various [[vole]]s, [[porcupine]]s, [[muskrat]]s, etc. [[Mustelid]]s are also well represented and include the [[wolverine]] (''Gulo gulo''), [[marten]] (''Martes americana''), [[Stoat|ermine]] (''Mustela erminea''), [[least weasel]] (''Mustela nivalis''), [[American mink]] (''Mustela vison''), and the [[North American river otter|river otter]] (''Lontra canadensis''). Other small carnivores present are the [[Canadian lynx|lynx]] (''Lynx canadensis''), [[red fox]] ('' Vulpes vulpes'') and [[Arctic fox]] (''Alopex lagopus'') along the northern coast.\n\nMore than 250 species of [[bird]]s have been sighted in Yukon. The [[common raven]] (''Corvus corax'') is the territorial bird and is common everywhere. Other common resident birds include [[bald eagle]]s (''Haliaeetus leucocephalus''), [[golden eagle]]s (''Aquila chrysaetos''),  [[gyrfalcon]] (''Falco rusticolus'') and [[peregrine falcon]] (''Falco peregrinus''), five species of [[grouse]] ([[spruce grouse]], [[blue grouse]], [[ruffed grouse]], [[Rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]], and [[white-tailed ptarmigan]]). Many [[migratory bird]]s breed in the Yukon, as it is at the northern end of the [[Pacific Flyway]].\n\nOther than the [[burbot]] and [[northern pike]], most of the large fish found in Yukon rivers, lakes and streams are [[Salmonidae|salmonids]]. Four species of [[Oncorhynchus|Pacific salmon]] ([[Chinook salmon|Chinook]], [[Sockeye salmon|sockeye]], [[Coho salmon|coho]] and [[Chum salmon|chum]]) breed in Yukon rivers and lakes in the [[Pacific]] and [[Yukon River]] watersheds. The Yukon River has the longest freshwater migration route of any salmon; Chinook salmon swim over 3,000 kilometres from its mouth in the Bering Sea to spawning grounds upstream of [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]]. There are also land-locked kokanee ([[sockeye salmon]]) and [[rainbow trout]]. [[Salvelinus|chars]] are represented by [[lake trout]] present in most large Yukon lakes, as well as [[Dolly Varden trout|Dolly Varden]], [[bull trout]] and [[Arctic char]]. The [[Arctic grayling]] is ubiquitous, while the lakes have various [[Coregonus|whitefish]] and [[Stenodus leucichthys|inconnu]].\n\nThere are no [[reptile]]s in Yukon, but a few [[frog]]s.\n\n== Human geography ==\nYukon is sparsely populated, with about 30,000 inhabitants in a territory almost as large as Spain or Sweden. Population density is 0.06 people per km<sup>2</sup>. Close to three quarters of the population is in the [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]] area, and the rest live in a number of other [[List of communities in Yukon|communities]]. All except [[Old Crow, Yukon|Old Crow]] are accessible by road.\n\nThe capital, Whitehorse, is also the largest city with more than two thirds of the population; the second largest is [[Dawson City, Yukon|Dawson City]], (pop. 1800) which was the capital until 1952.\n\nTraditionally, Yukon was inhabited by nomadic [[Athapaskan]]-speaking [[First Nations]] people who had established extensive trading networks with the Pacific Coast [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]. The interior people traded [[copper]], furs and meat for coastal products such as [[eulachon]] oil. About 20% of the Yukon population is of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] origin.\n\nThere is no [[Inuit]] population in Yukon, although there was a population along the [[Arctic Ocean]] coast within historic times. The Inuit were decimated by disease and disappeared in the 19th century. In 1984, the [[Government of Canada]] included the Yukon North Slope within the [[Inuvialuit Settlement Region]] under the auspices of the [[Inuvialuit]].<ref name=\"Berkes\">{{cite book|last=Berkes|first=Fikret |author2=Rob Huebert |author3=Helen Fast |author4=Alan Diduck |author5=Micheline Manseau |others=Arctic Institute of North America|title=Breaking Ice: Renewable Resource and Ocean Management in the Canadian North|publisher=University of Calgary Press|year=2005|page=95|isbn=1-55238-159-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IKt--FmDOMAC&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95&dq=%22Inuvialuit+Settlement+Region%22&source=bl&ots=BhpxGQZLZw&sig=cLLoaaYw5ECKa-CqxZQsRi_psjE&hl=en&ei=hc2-ScbbGZm0sQOp8-G1DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result}}</ref>\n\nThe following table presents the population of most [[List of communities in Yukon|Yukon communities]]. Note that the [[Canada 2001 Census|Census]] data represents those people who lived within the community boundaries, while the Yukon Bureau of Statistics (YBS) includes everyone with a postal address in the community. Typically, many people live immediately outside the community boundaries, hence the larger YBS numbers.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Population of Yukon Communities\n!Community\n!2001 <br />Census\n!1996 <br />Census\n!June 2005 <br />YBS\n|-\n|[[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]] ([[Census agglomeration|Agglomeration]])\n|23,272\n|23,272\n|23,608\n|-\n|[[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]] (City)\n|19,157\n|19,058\n|23,272\n|-\n|[[Dawson City, Yukon|Dawson City]]\n|1,251\n|1,287\n|1,826\n|-\n|[[Watson Lake, Yukon|Watson Lake]]<sup>2</sup>\n|1,138\n|1,148\n|1,522\n|-\n|&nbsp; &nbsp; Town of Watson Lake only\n|912\n|993\n|n/a\n|-\n|[[Haines Junction, Yukon|Haines Junction]]\n|531\n|574\n|817\n|-\n|[[Carmacks, Yukon|Carmacks]]\n|431\n|466\n|378\n|-\n|[[Marsh Lake, Yukon|Marsh Lake]]\u00b9\n|400\n|n/a\n|336\n|-\n|[[Mt.

Abundant [[gold]] was found in the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike region]] leading to the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] of 1898. [[Placer mining|Placer]] gold is found in many streams and rivers, and there is an active placer mining industry in the Klondike and many other parts of Yukon to this day.\n\nOther minerals that have been actively mined include [[copper]] in the [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]] area, [[lead]] and [[zinc]] in [[Faro, Yukon|Faro]], [[silver]], [[zinc]] and [[lead]] in the [[Mayo, Yukon|Mayo]]/[[Keno City, Yukon|Keno City]] area, [[asbestos]] in [[Clinton Creek, Yukon|Clinton Creek]], and copper, gold, and coal in the [[Carmacks, Yukon|Carmacks]] area. The world's largest known deposit of [[tungsten]] is in the [[Macmillan Pass]] area in the [[Mackenzie Mountains]] near the [[Northwest Territories]] border. Non-metallic minerals mined have included [[jade]] and [[barite]].\n\nThe  fur trade was very important to the Yukon [[First Nation]] economy, but low prices and the impact of [[animal rights activism|animal rights activists]] have devastated the traditional economy.\n\nThere are three [[hydroelectric]] generating stations in Yukon: one at [[Schwatka Lake]] in Whitehorse, another near Mayo and a third on [[Aishihik Lake]].\n\nWhile Yukon is mostly covered with forests, most of the trees are small and take a long time to grow and regenerate because of the dry cold climate. There is a considerable amount of small scale [[logging]], but the only area that can sustain industrial forestry is in the southeast with its wetter climate. However, distance from markets and fluctuating prices have resulted in a boom-and-bust industry.\n\nA small amount of [[natural gas]] is currently produced in the southeast, but little exploration has been done in other parts of the Yukon. It is believed that there are abundant natural gas fields in the Eagle Plains area along the [[Dempster Highway]] and possibly in the Whitehorse area, but distance from [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] has hampered exploration.\n\n== Environmental issues ==\n[[Global warming]] is affecting the north more than other parts of the world and Yukon is no exception.<ref>{{cite web |title=Executive Summary |url=https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/energy/Climate-change/pdf/CCCR_ExecSumm-EN-040419-FINAL.pdf |website=Canada's Changing Climate Report |author1=Government of Canada |accessdate=8 November 2019 |ref=ClimateChangeReportExec}}</ref> While residents might welcome warmer temperatures, the ultimate effects are not known. Higher temperatures would mean more [[evaporation]] and drying out an already dry climate, resulting in more [[forest fire]]s and reducing the biological productivity of [[boreal forest]]s, whose growth is limited more by lack of moisture than temperature. Also glaciers are likely to melt, and permafrost likely to thaw.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Government of Canada |title=Changes in Snow, Ice, and Permafrost Across Canada |url=https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/energy/Climate-change/pdf/CCCR-Chapter5-ChangesInSnowIcePermafrostAcrossCanada.pdf |website=Canada's Changing Climate Report |accessdate=8 November 2019 |ref=aClimateChangeReportIce |pages=224, 234}}</ref>\n\nYukon is also the recipient of airborne pollutants from other parts of the world, especially [[persistent organic pollutant]]s. Consumption of the liver of certain wild animals and fish is no longer recommended because of these.\n\nLocally, [[mine reclamation]] and dealing with mine [[tailings]] that cause [[acid mine drainage]] left over from [[mine closure]]s is a major problem and is likely to cost hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up.\n\nIn an effort to encourage natural resource exploration, the previous (2002\u20132011) [[Yukon Party]] government led by [[Dennis Fentie]] has suspended the application of the Protected Areas Strategy (established by a previous [[Yukon New Democratic Party]] government) and has indicated its intention of not creating additional protected areas or parks.\n\nThe [[Gwich\u02bcin]] people of [[Old Crow, Yukon|Old Crow]] are dependent on the Porcupine [[caribou]] herd for food and clothing, as are others in the Yukon. The Porcupine caribou herd migrates to the coastal plain in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] (ANWR) in [[Alaska]] to give birth. That herd may be seriously threatened by [[oil well|oil-drilling]] in the ANWR.\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Geography|Canada}}\n{{Reflist|2}}\n*A.W.F. Banfield (1974). ''The Mammals of Canada''.

The sparsely populated territory abounds with natural scenic beauty, with snowmelt lakes and perennial white-capped mountains, including many of Canada's highest mountains. The territory's climate is [[Arctic climate|Arctic]] in the north (north of [[Old Crow, Yukon|Old Crow]]), [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]] in the central region, between north of [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]] and Old Crow, and has a [[humid continental climate]] in the far south, south of Whitehorse and in areas close to the [[British Columbia]] border. The long sunshine hours in the short summer allow a profusion of flowers and fruit to blossom. Most of the territory is [[boreal forest]], [[tundra]] being the main vegetation zone only in the extreme north and at high elevations.\n\nThe territory is about the shape of a right triangle, bordering the [[United States|American]] state of Alaska to the west, the Northwest Territories to the east and British Columbia to the south. Yukon covers 482,443&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, of which 474,391&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is land and 8,052&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is water, making it the [[List of country subdivisions by area|forty-first largest subnational entity in the world]], and, among the fifty largest, the least populous.\n\nIt is bounded on the south by the [[60th parallel north|60th parallel]] of [[latitude]]. Its northern coast is on the [[Beaufort Sea]]. Its western boundary is [[141st meridian west|141\u00b0 west]] [[longitude]]. Its ragged eastern boundary mostly follows the [[water divide|divide]] between the [[Yukon River]] Basin and the [[Mackenzie River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]] to the east in the [[Mackenzie mountains]].\n\n==Physical geography==\nExcept for the coastal plain on the [[Beaufort Sea]] ([[Arctic Ocean]]) coast, most of Yukon is part of the [[American cordillera]]. The terrain includes [[mountain range]]s, [[plateau]]s and [[river]] [[valley]]s.\n\nThe southwest is dominated by the [[Kluane icefields]] in [[Kluane National Park and Reserve]], the largest non-polar [[icefield]]s in the [[Geographical pole|Poles]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-non-polar-ice-field/ |title=Largest non-polar ice field |last= |first= |date= |website=Guinness World Records |publisher= |access-date=October 10, 2019 |quote= Located in Yukon Territory, Canada, ... Kluane National Park and Reserve is home to the largest ice field outside the Poles. }}</ref> Kluane National Park also contains eight of Canada's ten highest mountains, including the five highest, all in the [[Saint Elias Mountains]]. A number of glaciers flow out of the icefields, including the [[Logan Glacier]], the [[Hubbard Glacier]] and the [[Kaskawulsh Glacier]].\n\n[[Permafrost]] is common. The northern part of Yukon has continuous permafrost, while it is widespread in the central part. Even the southern Yukon has scattered patches of permafrost.\n\nTwo major [[Geologic fault|faults]], the [[Denali Fault]] and the [[Tintina Fault]] have created major valleys called [[Oceanic trench|trenches]]: the [[Shakwak Trench]] and the [[Tintina Trench]]. The Shakwak Trench separates the Kluane ranges from other mountain ranges north of it. The [[Haines Highway]] and the [[Alaska Highway]] north of [[Haines Junction, Yukon|Haines Junction]] are built in the Shakwak Trench. The Tintina Trench bisects the Yukon from northwest to southeast and its edges have rich mineral deposits including the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] [[gold]] and the [[lead]]-[[zinc]] deposits near [[Faro, Yukon|Faro]].<ref>[http://www.geology.gov.yk.ca/publications/openfile/2002/of2002_8d_geoprocess_file/documents/general/userguide.pdf Yukon Geological Survey, ''Yukon Geoprocess File User Guide''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027141939/http://www.geology.gov.yk.ca/publications/openfile/2002/of2002_8d_geoprocess_file/documents/general/userguide.pdf |date=2005-10-27 }} ([[PDF]] file, 1.2MB)</ref>\n\n=== Volcanoes ===\nThe [[volcano]]es in Yukon are part of the circle of volcanoes around the [[Pacific Ocean]] known as the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. Yukon includes more than 100 separate volcanic centres that have been active during the [[Quaternary]]. The [[Fort Selkirk Volcanic Field]] in central Yukon is the northernmost [[Holocene]] [[volcanic field]] in Canada, including the young [[active volcano|active]] [[cinder cone]], [[Volcano Mountain]]. A [[volcanic field]] in south-central Yukon is called [[Alligator Lake volcanic complex]]. It contains two well-preserved cinder cones that caps a small [[shield volcano]]. Lava from the cones travelled north and were erupted at the same time. Volcanoes in south-western Yukon are part of the [[Wrangle Volcanic Field]], which is related to the [[subduction]] of the [[Pacific Plate]] beneath the [[North American Plate]] at the easternmost end of the [[Avalanche Trench]].\n\nYukon volcanoes include:\n\n*[[Volcano Mountain]]\n*[[Alligator Lake volcanic complex]]\n*[[Fort Selkirk Volcanic Field]]\n*[[Pelly Formation]]\n*[[Bennett Lake Caldera]]\n*[[Sifton Range volcanic complex]]\n*[[Rabbit Mountain]]\n*[[Felsite Peak]]\n*[[Ibex Mountain]]\n*[[Mount McNeil]]\n*[[Miles Canyon Basalts]]\n*[[Ne Ch'e Ddhawa]]\n*[[Skukum Group]]\n*[[Upper Becker Creek Cone]]\n\n=== Mountain ranges ===\nThe Saint Elias mountains are part of the [[Coast Mountains]] which range from southern British Columbia to Alaska and cover the southeastern Yukon. While the Saint Elias Mountains contain the highest mountains, there are numerous other mountain ranges, from the [[British Mountains]] in the far north and the [[Richardson Mountains]] in the northeast, both of which are part of the [[Brooks Range]], to the [[Selwyn Mountains]] and [[Mackenzie Mountains]] in the east, the [[Cassiar Mountains]] in the south-east, the [[Pelly Mountains]] in the central Yukon, and the [[Ogilvie Mountains]] north\nof [[Dawson City, Yukon|Dawson City]] and along the [[Dempster Highway]].\n\nYukon mountain ranges include:\n*[[Brooks Range]] (mostly in northern [[Alaska]])\n**[[British Mountains]], [[Yukon]]\n**[[Richardson Mountains]], [[Yukon]]\n*[[Cassiar Mountains]], [[British Columbia]] and [[Yukon]]\n*[[Mackenzie Mountains]], [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Yukon]]\n**[[Logan Mountains]], [[Yukon]]\n*[[Selwyn Mountains]], [[Yukon]]\n**[[Hess Mountains]], [[Yukon]]\n**[[Nadaleen Range]], [[Yukon]]\n**[[Bonnet Plume Range]], [[Yukon]]\n**[[Wernecke Mountains]], [[Yukon]]\n**[[Knorr Range]], [[Yukon]]\n*[[Pacific Coast Ranges]], [[Mexico]] to [[Alaska]]\n**[[Coast Mountains]], also in [[British Columbia]] and [[Alaska Panhandle]]\n**[[Saint Elias Mountains]], southern [[Alaska]], [[Yukon]] and [[British Columbia]]\n***[[Kluane Ranges]], [[Yukon]]\n***[[Alsek Ranges]], Yukon, British Columbia and Alaska\n*[[Yukon Ranges]]\n**[[Anvil Range]]\n**[[Dawson Range (Yukon)|Dawson Range]]\n**[[Miners Range]], [[Yukon]]\n**[[Nisling Range]]\n**[[Ogilvie Mountains]], [[Yukon]]\n***[[Nahoni Range]]\n**[[Pelly Mountains]], [[Yukon]]\n***[[Big Salmon Range]], [[Yukon]]\n***[[Glenlyon Range]]\n***[[Saint Cyr Range]]\n**[[Ruby Range (Yukon)|Ruby Range]], [[Yukon]]\n\n=== Highest mountains ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Highest Mountains in the Yukon\n!Mountain\n!Height (metres)\n!Height (feet)\n!Rank\n|-\n|[[Mount Logan]]\n|{{convert|5959|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|Highest mountain in Canada\n|-\n|[[Mount Saint Elias]]\n|{{convert|5489|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|#2 in both Canada and the USA\n|-\n|[[Mount Lucania]]\n|{{convert|5226|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|#3 in Canada\n|-\n|[[King Peak (Yukon)|King Peak]]\n|{{convert|5173|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|#4 in Canada\n|-\n|[[Mount Steele]]\n|{{convert|5073|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|#5 in Canada\n|-\n|[[Mount Wood (Yukon)|Mount Wood]]\n|{{convert|4842|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|#7 in Canada\n|-\n|[[Mount Vancouver]]\n|{{convert|4812|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|#8 in Canada\n|-\n|[[Mount Slaggard]]\n|{{convert|4742|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|#10 in Canada\n|-\n|[[Mount Macaulay]]\n|{{convert|4690|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|\n|-\n|[[Mount Hubbard]]\n|{{convert|4577|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|\n|-\n|[[Mount Walsh]]\n|{{convert|4507|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|\n|-\n|[[Mount Alverstone]]\n|{{convert|4439|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|\n|-\n|[[McArthur Peak]]\n|{{convert|4389|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|\n|-\n|[[Mount Augusta]]\n|{{convert|4289|m|ft|disp=tablecen}}\n|\n|}\n\n== Hydrography ==\nSee also: [[List of Yukon lakes]] and [[List of Yukon rivers]]\n\nMost of the territory is in the [[drainage basin|watershed]] of its namesake, the [[Yukon River]], which flows into the [[Bering Sea]]. Southern Yukon is dotted with a large number of large, long and narrow glacier-fed alpine [[lake]]s, most of which flow into the Yukon River system. The larger lakes include: [[Teslin Lake]], [[Atlin Lake]], [[Tagish Lake]], [[Marsh Lake]], [[Lake Laberge]], [[Kusawa Lake]], [[Kluane Lake]]. [[Bennett Lake]] on the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] trail is a smaller lake flowing into Tagish Lake.\n\nOther rivers flow either directly into the [[Pacific Ocean]] or directly or indirectly into the [[Arctic Ocean]]. The [[Alsek River|Alsek]]-Tatshenshini drainage flows directly into the Pacific from southwestern Yukon. A number of rivers in northern Yukon flow directly into the Arctic Ocean. The two main Yukon rivers flowing into the [[Mackenzie River]] in the Northwest Territories are the [[Liard]] River in the southeast and the [[Peel River (Canada)|Peel River]] and its tributaries in the northeast.\n\n== Climate ==\n[[File:Yukon K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] types of Yukon.]]\nMost of Yukon has a [[subarctic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] Dfc), characterized by long cold winters and brief warm summers. The airstrip at Snag, 25 kilometres east of [[Beaver Creek, Yukon|Beaver Creek]] near the Alaska border, experienced the lowest ever [[temperature]] measured in North America, -63.0&nbsp;\u00b0C (-81.4&nbsp;\u00b0F) on February 3, 1947. The [[Arctic Ocean]] coast has a [[Polar climate|Tundra climate]] (ET). The climate is generally very dry, with little precipitation, but is considerably wetter in the southeast. Precipitation is much greater in the mountains, and the snowpack continues to melt well into the summer, resulting in high water in July or August.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Representative Climate Normals\n|-\n!Zone\n!Average annual temperature\n!Average July daily high\n!Average January daily low\n!Average snowfall\n!Average rainfall\n|-\n!North ([[Old Crow, Yukon|Old Crow]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|-9.0&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|21&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|-36&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|129&nbsp;cm\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|144&nbsp;mm\n|-\n!Central ([[Dawson City, Yukon|Dawson City]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|-4.4&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|23&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|-31&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|160&nbsp;cm\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|200&nbsp;mm\n|-\n!South ([[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|-0.7&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|21&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|-22&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|145&nbsp;cm\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|163&nbsp;mm\n|-\n!Southeast ([[Watson Lake, Yukon|Watson Lake]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|-2.9&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|21&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|-29&nbsp;\u00b0C\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|197&nbsp;cm\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|255&nbsp;mm\n|}\nSource: Environment Canada<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/climate_normals/index_e.html|publisher=Environment Canada|title=Canadian Climate Normals or Averages 1971-2000}}</ref>\n\n== Ecology ==\nExcept for the [[Arctic Ocean]] [[coastal plain]] and high elevations, most of Yukon is in the [[boreal forest]] [[ecoregion]]. Most mountain peaks and higher elevations are characterized by [[Alpine tundra]] while the coastal plain is [[Arctic coastal tundra]]. More precisely, according to [[Environment Canada]]'s ecozone definitions, southern and central Yukon is part of the [[Boreal Cordillera Ecozone]] while the northern forest is part of the [[Taiga Cordillera Ecozone]]. The [[Peel River (Canada)|Peel River]] area in the northeast is in the [[Taiga Plains Ecozone]] and the Arctic coast is in the [[Southern Arctic Ecozone]].\n\n[[File:Fireweed Yukon.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Fireweed]] (''Epilobium angustifolium''), Yukon's territorial flower and [[white spruce]] (''Picea glauca'') in southern Yukon near the South [[Klondike Highway]].]]\n\n=== Plants ===\n[[Black spruce]] (''Picea mariana''),<ref>C.

Although relatively uncommon, the Alaska birch (''Betula neoalaskana'') is also found in most areas. The [[lodgepole pine]] (''Pinus contorta'') reaches its northern extreme in the south-central part of the territory, while [[tamarack]] (''Larix laricina'') is found in the southeast and the [[Abies lasiocarpa|subalpine fir]] (''Abies lasiocarpa'') is found at higher elevations in the southern part of the territory.\n\n=== Animals ===\nThe large mammals found throughout the territory include [[caribou]] (''Rangifer tarandus'', both barren-ground and woodland), [[moose]] (''Alces alces''), [[Wolf|wolves]] (''Canis lupus''), [[grizzly bear]]s (''Ursus arctos horribilis'') and [[American black bears]] (''Ursus americanus''). Higher elevation have [[Dall sheep]] (''Ovis dalli'') and, in the south, [[Rocky Mountain goat]] (''Oreamnos americanus''). [[polar bear]]s (''Ursus maritimus'') are found on the Arctic coast. The [[mule deer]] (''Odocoileus hermionus'') and its predator, the [[cougar]] (''Puma concolor''), are becoming increasingly common in the south, and [[coyote]]s (''Canis latrans'') are increasing their range to the northern Yukon. [[Elk]] and [[bison]] have been introduced.\n\nThere are many species of [[rodent]]s, including [[squirrel]]s, [[Spermophilus|ground squirrels]], [[lemming]]s, [[pika]]s, [[beaver]]s, various [[vole]]s, [[porcupine]]s, [[muskrat]]s, etc. [[Mustelid]]s are also well represented and include the [[wolverine]] (''Gulo gulo''), [[marten]] (''Martes americana''), [[Stoat|ermine]] (''Mustela erminea''), [[least weasel]] (''Mustela nivalis''), [[American mink]] (''Mustela vison''), and the [[North American river otter|river otter]] (''Lontra canadensis''). Other small carnivores present are the [[Canadian lynx|lynx]] (''Lynx canadensis''), [[red fox]] ('' Vulpes vulpes'') and [[Arctic fox]] (''Alopex lagopus'') along the northern coast.\n\nMore than 250 species of [[bird]]s have been sighted in Yukon. The [[common raven]] (''Corvus corax'') is the territorial bird and is common everywhere. Other common resident birds include [[bald eagle]]s (''Haliaeetus leucocephalus''), [[golden eagle]]s (''Aquila chrysaetos''),  [[gyrfalcon]] (''Falco rusticolus'') and [[peregrine falcon]] (''Falco peregrinus''), five species of [[grouse]] ([[spruce grouse]], [[blue grouse]], [[ruffed grouse]], [[Rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]], and [[white-tailed ptarmigan]]). Many [[migratory bird]]s breed in the Yukon, as it is at the northern end of the [[Pacific Flyway]].\n\nOther than the [[burbot]] and [[northern pike]], most of the large fish found in Yukon rivers, lakes and streams are [[Salmonidae|salmonids]]. Four species of [[Oncorhynchus|Pacific salmon]] ([[Chinook salmon|Chinook]], [[Sockeye salmon|sockeye]], [[Coho salmon|coho]] and [[Chum salmon|chum]]) breed in Yukon rivers and lakes in the [[Pacific]] and [[Yukon River]] watersheds. The Yukon River has the longest freshwater migration route of any salmon; Chinook salmon swim over 3,000 kilometres from its mouth in the Bering Sea to spawning grounds upstream of [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]]. There are also land-locked kokanee ([[sockeye salmon]]) and [[rainbow trout]]. [[Salvelinus|chars]] are represented by [[lake trout]] present in most large Yukon lakes, as well as [[Dolly Varden trout|Dolly Varden]], [[bull trout]] and [[Arctic char]]. The [[Arctic grayling]] is ubiquitous, while the lakes have various [[Coregonus|whitefish]] and [[Stenodus leucichthys|inconnu]].\n\nThere are no [[reptile]]s in Yukon, but a few [[frog]]s.\n\n== Human geography ==\nYukon is sparsely populated, with about 30,000 inhabitants in a territory almost as large as Spain or Sweden. Population density is 0.06 people per km<sup>2</sup>. Close to three quarters of the population is in the [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]] area, and the rest live in a number of other [[List of communities in Yukon|communities]]. All except [[Old Crow, Yukon|Old Crow]] are accessible by road.\n\nThe capital, Whitehorse, is also the largest city with more than two thirds of the population; the second largest is [[Dawson City, Yukon|Dawson City]], (pop. 1800) which was the capital until 1952.\n\nTraditionally, Yukon was inhabited by nomadic [[Athapaskan]]-speaking [[First Nations]] people who had established extensive trading networks with the Pacific Coast [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]]. The interior people traded [[copper]], furs and meat for coastal products such as [[eulachon]] oil. About 20% of the Yukon population is of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|aboriginal]] origin.\n\nThere is no [[Inuit]] population in Yukon, although there was a population along the [[Arctic Ocean]] coast within historic times. The Inuit were decimated by disease and disappeared in the 19th century. In 1984, the [[Government of Canada]] included the Yukon North Slope within the [[Inuvialuit Settlement Region]] under the auspices of the [[Inuvialuit]].<ref name=\"Berkes\">{{cite book|last=Berkes|first=Fikret |author2=Rob Huebert |author3=Helen Fast |author4=Alan Diduck |author5=Micheline Manseau |others=Arctic Institute of North America|title=Breaking Ice: Renewable Resource and Ocean Management in the Canadian North|publisher=University of Calgary Press|year=2005|page=95|isbn=1-55238-159-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IKt--FmDOMAC&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95&dq=%22Inuvialuit+Settlement+Region%22&source=bl&ots=BhpxGQZLZw&sig=cLLoaaYw5ECKa-CqxZQsRi_psjE&hl=en&ei=hc2-ScbbGZm0sQOp8-G1DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result}}</ref>\n\nThe following table presents the population of most [[List of communities in Yukon|Yukon communities]]. Note that the [[Canada 2001 Census|Census]] data represents those people who lived within the community boundaries, while the Yukon Bureau of Statistics (YBS) includes everyone with a postal address in the community.

Abundant [[gold]] was found in the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike region]] leading to the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] of 1898. [[Placer mining|Placer]] gold is found in many streams and rivers, and there is an active placer mining industry in the Klondike and many other parts of Yukon to this day.\n\nOther minerals that have been actively mined include [[copper]] in the [[Whitehorse, Yukon|Whitehorse]] area, [[lead]] and [[zinc]] in [[Faro, Yukon|Faro]], [[silver]], [[zinc]] and [[lead]] in the [[Mayo, Yukon|Mayo]]/[[Keno City, Yukon|Keno City]] area, [[asbestos]] in [[Clinton Creek, Yukon|Clinton Creek]], and copper, gold, and coal in the [[Carmacks, Yukon|Carmacks]] area. The world's largest known deposit of [[tungsten]] is in the [[Macmillan Pass]] area in the [[Mackenzie Mountains]] near the [[Northwest Territories]] border. Non-metallic minerals mined have included [[jade]] and [[barite]].\n\nThe  fur trade was very important to the Yukon [[First Nation]] economy, but low prices and the impact of [[animal rights activism|animal rights activists]] have devastated the traditional economy.\n\nThere are three [[hydroelectric]] generating stations in Yukon: one at [[Schwatka Lake]] in Whitehorse, another near Mayo and a third on [[Aishihik Lake]].\n\nWhile Yukon is mostly covered with forests, most of the trees are small and take a long time to grow and regenerate because of the dry cold climate. There is a considerable amount of small scale [[logging]], but the only area that can sustain industrial forestry is in the southeast with its wetter climate. However, distance from markets and fluctuating prices have resulted in a boom-and-bust industry.\n\nA small amount of [[natural gas]] is currently produced in the southeast, but little exploration has been done in other parts of the Yukon. It is believed that there are abundant natural gas fields in the Eagle Plains area along the [[Dempster Highway]] and possibly in the Whitehorse area, but distance from [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] has hampered exploration.\n\n== Environmental issues ==\n[[Global warming]] is affecting the north more than other parts of the world and Yukon is no exception<ref>{{cite web |title=Executive Summary |url=https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/energy/Climate-change/pdf/CCCR_ExecSumm-EN-040419-FINAL.pdf |website=Canada's Changing Climate Report |author1=Government of Canada |accessdate=8 November 2019 |ref=ClimateChangeReportExec}}</ref>. While residents might welcome warmer temperatures, the ultimate effects are not known. Higher temperatures would mean more [[evaporation]] and drying out an already dry climate, resulting in more [[forest fire]]s and reducing the biological productivity of [[boreal forest]]s, whose growth is limited more by lack of moisture than temperature. Also glaciers are likely to melt, and permafrost likely to thaw.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Government of Canada |title=Changes in Snow, Ice, and Permafrost Across Canada |url=https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/energy/Climate-change/pdf/CCCR-Chapter5-ChangesInSnowIcePermafrostAcrossCanada.pdf |website=Canada's Changing Climate Report |accessdate=8 November 2019 |ref=aClimateChangeReportIce |pages=224, 234}}</ref>\n\nYukon is also the recipient of airborne pollutants from other parts of the world, especially [[persistent organic pollutant]]s. Consumption of the liver of certain wild animals and fish is no longer recommended because of these.\n\nLocally, [[mine reclamation]] and dealing with mine [[tailings]] that cause [[acid mine drainage]] left over from [[mine closure]]s is a major problem and is likely to cost hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up.\n\nIn an effort to encourage natural resource exploration, the previous (2002\u20132011) [[Yukon Party]] government led by [[Dennis Fentie]] has suspended the application of the Protected Areas Strategy (established by a previous [[Yukon New Democratic Party]] government) and has indicated its intention of not creating additional protected areas or parks.\n\nThe [[Gwich\u02bcin]] people of [[Old Crow, Yukon|Old Crow]] are dependent on the Porcupine [[caribou]] herd for food and clothing, as are others in the Yukon. The Porcupine caribou herd migrates to the coastal plain in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] (ANWR) in [[Alaska]] to give birth. That herd may be seriously threatened by [[oil well|oil-drilling]] in the ANWR.\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Geography|Canada}}\n{{Reflist|2}}\n*A.W.F. Banfield (1974). ''The Mammals of Canada''.

In [[genetic epidemiology]], gene\u2013environment interactions are useful for understanding some [[diseases]]. Sometimes, sensitivity to environmental [[risk factors]] for a disease are inherited rather than the disease itself being inherited. Individuals with different genotypes are affected differently by exposure to the same environmental factors, and thus gene\u2013environment interactions can result in different disease phenotypes. For example, sunlight exposure has a stronger influence on [[skin cancer]] risk in [[Human skin color|fair-skinned humans than in individuals with darker skin]].<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Green A, Trichopoulos D | chapter = Skin cancer | title = Textbook of Cancer Epidemiology | veditors = Adami H, Hunter D, Trichopoulos D | pages = 281\u2013300 | publisher= Oxford University Press | location= Oxford | year= 2002 }}</ref>\n\nThese interactions are of particular interest to [[Genetic epidemiology|genetic epidemiologists]] for predicting disease rates and methods of prevention with respect to public health.<ref name=\"Ottman 1996 764\u2013770\"/> The term is also used amongst [[Developmental psychobiology|developmental psychobiologists]] to better understand individual and evolutionary development.<ref name=\"tabery2010\" />\n\n[[Nature versus nurture]] debates assume that variation in a trait is primarily due to either genetic differences or environmental differences. However, the current scientific opinion holds that neither genetic differences nor environmental differences are solely responsible for producing phenotypic variation, and that virtually all traits are influenced by both genetic and environmental differences.<ref>[[Matt Ridley|Ridley, M.]] (2003) ''[[Nature via Nurture: Genes, Experience, & What Makes Us Human]]''.

The first instance of debate occurred between [[Ronald Fisher]] and [[Lancelot Hogben]].\nGalat h\nFisher sought to eliminate interaction from statistical studies as it was a phenomenon that could be removed using a variation in scale. Hogben believed that the interaction should be investigated instead of eliminated as it provided information on the causation of certain elements of development.\n\nA similar argument faced multiple scientists in the 1970s. [[Arthur Jensen]] published the study \u201c[[How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?|How much can we boost IQ and scholastic achievement?]]\u201d, which amongst much criticism also faced contention by scientists [[Richard Lewontin]] and [[David Layzer]]. Lewontin and Layzer argued that in order to conclude causal mechanisms, the gene\u2013environment interaction could not be ignored in the context of the study while Jensen defended that interaction was purely a statistical phenomenon and not related to development.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tabery J | title = Debating interaction: the history, and an explanation | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 1117\u201323 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 25855719 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyv053 }}</ref>\n\nAround the same time, Kenneth J.

In contrast to previous debates, Moffitt and Caspi were now using the statistical analysis to prove that interaction existed and could be used to uncover the mechanisms of a vulnerability trait. Contention came from Zammit, Owen and Lewis who reiterated the concerns of Fisher in that the statistical effect was not related to the developmental process and would not be replicable with a difference of scale.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Definitions ==\nThere are two different conceptions of gene\u2013environment interaction today.

(2005). ''Making sense of heritability''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 48.</ref> uses the terms ''statistical'' and ''commonsense'' interaction.\n\nThe biometric (or statistical) conception has its origins in research programs that seek to measure the relative proportions of genetic and environmental contributions to phenotypic variation within populations. Biometric gene\u2013environment interaction has particular currency in [[population genetics]] and [[behavioral genetics]].<ref name=\"tabery2007\"/> Any interaction results in the breakdown of the additivity of the [[main effect]]s of heredity and environment, but whether such interaction is present in particular settings is an empirical question. Biometric interaction is relevant in the context of research on individual differences rather than in the context of the development of a particular organism.<ref name=\"tabery2010\">{{cite book | last1 = Tabery | first1 = James | last2 = Griffiths | first2 = Paul E. | year = 2010 | chapter = Historical and Philosophical Perspectives on Behavioral Genetics and Developmental Science |  veditors = Hood KE, Halpern CT, Greenberg G, Lerner RM | title = Handbook of Developmental Science, Behavior, and Genetics | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | pages = 41\u201360 }}</ref>\n\nDevelopmental gene\u2013environment interaction is a concept more commonly used by [[Developmental genetics|developmental geneticists]] and [[Developmental psychobiology|developmental psychobiologists]]. Developmental interaction is not seen merely as a statistical phenomenon. Whether statistical interaction is present or not, developmental interaction is in any case manifested in the causal interaction of genes and environments in producing an individual's phenotype.<ref name=\"tabery2010\"/>\n\n== Epidemiological models of GxE ==\nIn epidemiology, the following models can be used to group the different interactions between gene and environment.\n\nModel A describes a genotype that increases the level of expression of a risk factor but does not cause the disease itself. For example, the PKU gene results in higher levels of phenylalanine than normal which in turn causes mental retardation.\n\nThe risk factor in Model B in contrast has a direct effect on disease susceptibility which is amplified by the genetic susceptibility. Model C depicts the inverse, where the genetic susceptibility directly effects disease while the risk factor amplifies this effect. In each independent situation, the factor directly effecting the disease can cause disease by itself.\n\nModel D differs as neither factor in this situation can effect disease risk, however, when both genetic susceptibility and risk factor are present the risk is increased. For example, the G6PD deficiency gene when combined with fava bean consumption results in hemolytic anemia. This disease does not arise in individuals that eat fava beans and lack G6PD deficiency nor in G6PD-deficient people who do not eat fava beans.\n\nLastly, Model E depicts a scenario where the environmental risk factor and genetic susceptibility can individually both influence disease risk. When combined, however, the effect on disease risk differs.\n\nThe models are limited by the fact that the variables are binary and so do not consider polygenic or continuous scale variable scenarios.<ref name=\"Ottman 1996 764\u2013770\"/>\n\n== Methods of analysis ==\n\n=== Traditional genetic designs ===\n\n==== Adoption studies ====\nAdoption studies have been used to investigate how similar individuals that have been adopted are to their biological parents with whom they did not share the same environment with. Additionally, adopted individuals are compared to their adoptive family due to the difference in genes but shared environment. For example, an adoption study showed that Swedish men with disadvantaged adoptive environments and a genetic predisposition were more likely to abuse alcohol.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dick DM | title = Gene\u2013environment interaction in psychological traits and disorders | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 7 | pages = 383\u2013409 | date = 2011 | pmid = 21219196 | pmc = 3647367 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032210-104518 | url = http://journals.scholarsportal.info/details/15485943/v7inone/383_giiptad.xml }}</ref>\n\n==== Twin studies ====\nUsing [[Twin|monozygotic twins]], the effects of different environments on identical genotypes could be observed. Later studies leverage biometrical modelling techniques to include the comparisons of dizygotic twins to ultimately determine the different levels of gene expression in different environments.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Family studies ====\nFamily-based research focuses on the comparison of low-risk controls to high risk children to determine the environmental effect on subjects with different levels of genetic risk. For example, a Danish study on high-risk children with schizophrenic mothers depicted that children without a stable caregiver were associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Molecular analyses ===\n\n==== Interaction with single genes ====\nThe often used method to detect gene\u2013environment interactions is by studying the effect a single gene variation ([[candidate gene]]) has with respect to a particular environment. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) are compared with single binary exposure factors to determine any effects.\n\nCandidate studies such as these require strong biological hypotheses which are currently difficult to select given the little understanding of biological mechanisms that lead to higher risk.\n\nThese studies are also often difficult to replicate commonly due to small sample sizes which typically results in disputed results.\n\nThe [[Polygene|polygenic]] nature of complex phenotypes suggests single candidate studies could be ineffective in determining the various smaller scale effects from the large number of influencing gene variants.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Assary E, Vincent JP, Keers R, Pluess M | title = Gene\u2013environment interaction and psychiatric disorders: Review and future directions | journal = Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology | volume = 77 | pages = 133\u2013143 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29051054 | doi = 10.1016/j.semcdb.2017.10.016 | url = http://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/28312 }}</ref>\n\n==== Interaction with multiple genes ====\nSince the same environmental factor could interact with multiple genes, a polygenic approach can be taken to analyze GxE interactions.

The combined effects must either be greater for synergistic or less than for an antagonistic outcome.

(2005). ''Making sense of heritability''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 48.</ref> uses the terms ''statistical'' and ''commonsense'' interaction.\n\nThe biometric (or statistical) conception has its origins in research programs that seek to measure the relative proportions of genetic and environmental contributions to phenotypic variation within populations. Biometric gene\u2013environment interaction has particular currency in [[population genetics]] and [[behavioral genetics]].<ref name=\"tabery2007\"/> Any interaction results in the breakdown of the additivity of the [[main effect]]s of heredity and environment, but whether such interaction is present in particular settings is an empirical question. Biometric interaction is relevant in the context of research on individual differences rather than in the context of the development of a particular organism.<ref name=\"tabery2010\">{{cite book | last1 = Tabery | first1 = James | last2 = Griffiths | first2 = Paul E. | year = 2010 | chapter = Historical and Philosophical Perspectives on Behavioral Genetics and Developmental Science |  veditors = Hood KE, Halpern CT, Greenberg G, Lerner RM | title = Handbook of Developmental Science, Behavior, and Genetics | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | pages = 41\u201360 }}</ref>\n\nDevelopmental gene\u2013environment interaction is a concept more commonly used by [[Developmental genetics|developmental geneticists]] and [[Developmental psychobiology|developmental psychobiologists]]. Developmental interaction is not seen merely as a statistical phenomenon. Whether statistical interaction is present or not, developmental interaction is in any case manifested in the causal interaction of genes and environments in producing an individual's phenotype.<ref name=\"tabery2010\"/>\n\n== Epidemiological models of GxE ==\nIn epidemiology, the following models can be used to group the different interactions between gene and environment.\n\nModel A describes a genotype that increases the level of expression of a risk factor but does not cause the disease itself. For example, the PKU gene results in higher levels of phenylalanine than normal which in turn causes mental retardation.\n\nThe risk factor in Model B in contrast has a direct effect on disease susceptibility which is amplified by the genetic susceptibility. Model C depicts the inverse, where the genetic susceptibility directly effects disease while the risk factor amplifies this effect. In each independent situation, the factor directly effecting the disease can cause disease by itself.\n\nModel D differs as neither factor in this situation can effect disease risk, however, when both genetic susceptibility and risk factor are present the risk is increased. For example, the G6PD deficiency gene when combined with fava bean consumption results in hemolytic anemia. This disease does not arise in individuals that eat fava beans and lack G6PD deficiency nor in G6PD-deficient people who do not eat fava beans.\n\nLastly, Model E depicts a scenario where the environmental risk factor and genetic susceptibility can individually both influence disease risk. When combined, however, the effect on disease risk differs.\n\nThe models are limited by the fact that the variables are binary and so do not consider polygenic or continuous scale variable scenarios.<ref name=\"Ottman 1996 764\u2013770\"/>\n\n== Methods of analysis ==\n\n=== Traditional genetic designs ===\n\n==== Adoption studies ====\nAdoption studies have been used to investigate how similar individuals that have been adopted are to their biological parents with whom they did not share the same environment with. Additionally, adopted individuals are compared to their adoptive family due to the difference in genes but shared environment. For example, an adoption study showed that Swedish men with disadvantaged adoptive environments and a genetic predisposition were more likely to abuse alcohol.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Dick DM | title = Gene\u2013environment interaction in psychological traits and disorders | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 7 | pages = 383\u2013409 | date = 2011 | pmid = 21219196 | pmc = 3647367 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032210-104518 | url = http://journals.scholarsportal.info/details/15485943/v7inone/383_giiptad.xml }}</ref>\n\n==== Twin studies ====\nUsing [[Twin|monozygotic twins]], the effects of different environments on identical genotypes could be observed.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) are compared with single binary exposure factors to determine any effects.\n\nCandidate studies such as these require strong biological hypotheses which are currently difficult to select given the little understanding of biological mechanisms that lead to higher risk.\n\nThese studies are also often difficult to replicate commonly due to small sample sizes which typically results in disputed results.\n\nThe [[Polygene|polygenic]] nature of complex phenotypes suggests single candidate studies could be ineffective in determining the various smaller scale effects from the large number of influencing gene variants.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Assary E, Vincent JP, Keers R, Pluess M | title = Gene\u2013environment interaction and psychiatric disorders: Review and future directions | journal = Seminars in Cell & Developmental Biology | volume = 77 | pages = 133\u2013143 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29051054 | doi = 10.1016/j.semcdb.2017.10.016 | url = http://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/28312 }}</ref>\n\n==== Interaction with multiple genes ====\nSince the same environmental factor could interact with multiple genes, a polygenic approach can be taken to analyze GxE interactions. A [[polygenic score]] is generated using the alleles associated with a trait and their respective weights based on effect and examined in combination with environmental exposure. Though this method of research is still early, it is consistent with psychiatric disorders.  As a result of the overlap of endophenotypes amongst disorders this suggests that the outcomes of gene\u2013environment interactions are applicable across various diagnoses.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==== Genome-wide association studies and genome wide interaction studies ====\nA genome wide interaction scan (GEWIS) approach examines the interaction between the environment and a large number of independent SNP's.

There is disagreement on which scale should be used. Under these analyses, if the combined variables fit either model then there is no interaction. The combined effects must either be greater for synergistic or less than for an antagonistic outcome. The additive model measures risk differences while the multiplicative model uses ratios to measure effects. The additive model has been suggested to be a better fit for predicting disease risk in a population while a multiplicative model is more appropriate for disease etiology.<ref name=\"Ottman 1996 764\u2013770\"/>\n\nEpigenetics is an example of an underlying mechanism of gene\u2013environment effects, however, it does not conclude whether environment effects are additive, multiplicative or interactive.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n== Gene \"\u00d7\" environment \"\u00d7\" environment interactions ==\nNew studies have also revealed the interactive effect of multiple environment factors.

For all individual genotypes, average egg development time decreases with increasing temperature.

{"title_page": "Metric prefix", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019|cs1-dates=y}}\nA '''metric prefix''' is a [[unit prefix]] that precedes a basic unit of measure to indicate a [[multiple (mathematics)|multiple]] or [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] of the unit. While all metric prefixes in common use today are [[decimal|decadic]], historically there have been a number of [[binary number|binary]] metric prefixes as well.<ref name=\"fr\"/> Each prefix has a unique symbol that is prepended to the unit symbol. The prefix ''[[kilo-]]'', for example, may be added to ''gram'' to indicate ''multiplication'' by one thousand: one kilogram is equal to one thousand grams. The prefix ''[[milli-]]'', likewise, may be added to ''metre'' to indicate ''division'' by one thousand; one millimetre is equal to one thousandth of a metre.\n\nDecimal multiplicative prefixes have been a feature of all forms of the [[metric system]], with six of these dating back to the system's introduction in the 1790s. Metric prefixes have also been used with some non-metric units. The '''SI prefixes''' are metric prefixes that were standardized for use in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) in resolutions dating from 1960 to 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/si/prefixes.html |title=Four Resolutions |publisher=Bipm.org |access-date=1 March 2012}}</ref> Since 2009, they have formed part of the [[International System of Quantities]]. They are also used in the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]] (UCUM)\n\n==List of SI prefixes==\nThe BIPM specifies twenty prefixes for the International System of Units (SI).\n\n{{SI prefixes (infobox)}}\n\nEach prefix name has a symbol that is used in combination with the symbols for units of measure. For example, the symbol for ''kilo-'' is k, and is used to produce km, kg, and kW, which are the SI symbols for kilometre, kilogram, and kilowatt, respectively. Except for the early prefixes of ''kilo-'', ''hecto-'', and ''deca-'', the symbols for the multiplicative prefixes are uppercase letters, and those for the fractional prefixes are lowercase letters.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/metric-prefixes-and-si-units/all |title=Metric Prefixes and SI Units |website=learn.sparkfun.com |access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref> There is a [[Unicode]] symbol for micro ''\u00b5'' for use if the Greek letter ''\u03bc'' is unavailable. When both are unavailable, the visually similar lowercase Latin letter ''u'' is commonly used instead. SI unit symbols are never in italics.\n\nPrefixes corresponding to an integer power of one thousand are generally preferred. Hence 100&nbsp;m is preferred over 1&nbsp;hm (hectometre) or 10&nbsp;dam (decametres). The prefixes ''hecto-'', ''deca-'', ''deci-'', and ''centi-'' are commonly used for everyday purposes, and the centimetre (cm) is especially common. However, some modern building codes require that the millimetre be used in preference to the centimetre, because \"use of centimetres leads to extensive usage of decimal points and confusion\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wbdg.org/ccb/GSAMAN/mdg.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215115519/http://wbdg.org/ccb/GSAMAN/mdg.pdf |archive-date=2011-12-15 |title=METRIC DESIGN GUIDE (PBS-PQ260) |author=Public Buildings Service, U.S. General Services Administration |date=September 1995 |website=National Institute of Building Sciences |accessdate=21 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nPrefixes may not be used in combination. This also applies to [[mass]], for which the [[SI base unit]] (kilogram) already contains a prefix. For example, milligram (mg) is used instead of microkilogram (\u03bckg).\n\nIn the arithmetic of measurements having units, the units are treated as multiplicative factors to values. If they have prefixes, all but one of the prefixes must be expanded to their numeric multiplier, except when combining values with identical units. Hence:\n* {{val|5|u=mV}} \u00d7 {{val|5|u=mA}} = {{val|5|e=-3|u=V}} \u00d7 {{val|5|e=-3|u=A}} = {{val|25|e=-6|u=V\u22c5A}} = {{val|25|u=uW}}.\n* {{val|5.00|u=mV}} + {{val|10|u=uV}} = {{val|5.00|u=mV}} + {{val|0.01|u=mV}} = {{val|5.01|u=mV}}.\n\nWhen [[Exponentiation|powers]] of units occur, for example, squared or cubed, the multiplicative prefix must be considered part of the unit, and thus included in the exponentiation:\n* 1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> means one [[square kilometre]], or the [[area]] of a [[Square (geometry)|square]] of {{val|1000|u=m}} by {{val|1000|u=m}} and not {{val|1000}} [[square metre]]s.\n* 2&nbsp;Mm<sup>3</sup> means two cubic [[megametre]]s, or the [[volume]] of two [[cube]]s of {{val|1000000|u=m}} by {{val|1000000|u=m}} by {{val|1000000|u=m}} or {{val|2|e=18|u=m3}}, and not {{val|2000000}} [[cubic metre]]s ({{val|2|e=6|u=m3}}).\n\n;Examples\n* {{val|5|u=cm}} =&nbsp;{{val|5|e=-2|u=m}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|5 \u00d7 0.01 m}} =&nbsp;0.05&nbsp;m.\n* {{val|9|u=km2}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|9 \u00d7 (10<sup>3</sup> m)<sup>2</sup>}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|9 \u00d7 (10<sup>3</sup>)<sup>2</sup> \u00d7 m<sup>2</sup>}} =&nbsp;{{val|9|e=6|u=m2}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|9 \u00d7 {{val|1000000|u=m2}}}} =&nbsp;{{val|9000000|u=m2}}.\n* 3&nbsp;MW =&nbsp;{{val|3|e=6|u=W}} =&nbsp;3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;{{val|1000000|u=W}} = {{val|3000000|u=W}}.\n\n== Application to units of measurement ==\nThe use of prefixes can be traced back to the introduction of the metric system in the 1790s, long before the 1960 introduction of the SI. The prefixes, including those introduced after 1960, are used with any metric unit, whether officially included in the SI or not (e.g., millidynes and milligauss). Metric prefixes may also be used with non-metric units.\n\nThe choice of prefixes with a given unit is usually dictated by convenience of use. Unit prefixes for amounts that are much larger or smaller than those actually encountered are seldom used.\n\n=== Metric units ===\n\n==== Mass ====\nThe units [[kilogram]], [[gram]], [[milligram]], microgram, and smaller are commonly used for measurement of [[mass]]. However, megagram, gigagram, and larger are rarely used; [[tonne]]s (and kilotonnes, megatonnes, etc.) or [[scientific notation]] are used instead. Megagram and teragram are occasionally used to disambiguate the metric tonne from other units with the name \"ton\".{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe kilogram is the only base unit of the [[International System of Units]] that includes a metric prefix.\n\n====Volume====\nThe [[litre]] (equal to a cubic decimetre), millilitre (equal to a cubic centimetre), microlitre, and smaller are common. In Europe, the centilitre is often used for packaged products such as wine and the decilitre is used less frequently.\n\nLarger volumes are usually denoted in kilolitres, megalitres or gigalitres, or else in cubic metres (1 cubic metre = 1 kilolitre) or cubic kilometres (1 cubic kilometre = 1 teralitre). For scientific purposes, the cubic metre is usually used.\n\n====Length====\nThe kilometre, metre, centimetre, millimetre, and smaller are common. (However, the decimetre is rarely used.) The micrometre is often referred to by the non-SI term ''[[Micrometre#SI standardization|micron]]''. In some fields, such as [[chemistry]], the [[\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m]] (equal to 0.1&nbsp;nm) historically competed with the nanometre. The [[femtometre]], used mainly in particle physics, is sometimes called a [[fermi (unit)|fermi]]. For large scales, megametre, gigametre, and larger are rarely used. Instead, non-metric units are used, such as the [[solar radius]], [[astronomical unit]]s, [[light year]]s, and [[parsec]]s; the astronomical unit is mentioned in the SI standards as an accepted non-SI unit.\n\n====Time====\n{{see also|Metric time|Orders of magnitude (time)}}\nPrefixes for the SI standard unit [[second]] are most commonly encountered for quantities less than one second. For larger quantities, the system of [[minute]]s (60 seconds), [[hour]]s (60 minutes) and [[day]]s (24 hours) is [[Non-SI units mentioned in the SI|accepted for use with the SI]] and more commonly used. When speaking of spans of time, the length of the day is usually standardized to {{val|86,400}} seconds so as not to create issues with the irregular [[leap second]]. \n\nLarger multiples of the second such as kiloseconds and megaseconds are occasionally encountered in scientific contexts, but are seldom used in common parlance. For long-scale scientific work, particularly in [[astronomy]], the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] or ''annum'' is a standardized variant of the [[year]], equal to exactly {{val|31,557,600}} SI seconds (365 days, 6 hours). The unit is so named because it was the average length of a year in the  [[Julian calendar]]. Long time periods are then expressed by using metric prefixes with the annum, such as megaannum or gigaannum.\n\n====Angle====\nThe SI unit of angle is the [[radian]], but degrees, minutes, seconds and more rarely tierces see some scientific use.\n\n====Temperature====\nOfficial policy also varies from common practice for the degree Celsius (\u00b0C). NIST states:<ref name=\"Special Publication 811\"/> \"Prefix symbols may be used with the unit symbol \u00b0C and prefix names may be used with the unit name ''degree Celsius''. For example, 12&nbsp;m\u00b0C (12 millidegrees Celsius) is acceptable.\" In practice, it is more common for prefixes to be used with the [[kelvin]] when it is desirable to denote extremely large or small absolute temperatures or temperature differences. Thus, temperatures of star interiors may be given in units of MK (megakelvins), and molecular cooling may be described in mK (millikelvins).\n\n====Energy====\nIn use the [[joule]] and kilojoule are common, with larger multiples seen in limited contexts. In addition, the [[kilowatt hour]], a composite unit formed from the [[Watt#Kilowatt|kilowatt]] and hour, is often used for electrical energy; other multiples can be formed by modifying the prefix of watt (e.g. terawatt hour).\n\nThere exist a number of definitions for the non-SI unit, the [[calorie]]. There are gram calories and kilogram calories. One kilogram calorie, which equals one thousand gram calories, often appears capitalized and without a prefix (i.e. ''Cal'') when referring to \"[[Calorie|dietary calories]]\" in food.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/remarkablecalorie.html |title=Remarkable Calorie |last=Conn |first=Carole |author2=Len Kravitz |publisher=University of New Mexico |accessdate=22 May 2017}}</ref> It is common to apply metric prefixes to the gram calorie, but not to the kilogram calorie: thus, 1&nbsp;kcal = 1000&nbsp;cal = 1&nbsp;Cal.\n\n===Non-metric units===\nMetric prefixes are widely used outside the system of [[metric system|metric units]]. Common examples include the [[megabyte]] and the [[decibel]]. Metric prefixes rarely appear with [[imperial units|imperial]] or [[United States customary units|US]] units except in some special cases (e.g., microinch, kilofoot, [[kilopound]]). They are also used with other specialized units used in particular fields (e.g., [[megaelectronvolt]], [[gigaparsec]], [[millibarn]]). They are also occasionally used with currency units (e.g., gigadollar), mainly by people who are familiar with the prefixes from scientific usage.{{cn|date=October 2019}} In astronomy, geology, and paleontology, the [[Year#Symbols|year]], with symbol a (from the Latin ''annus''), is commonly used with metric prefixes: [[Kiloannus|ka]], Ma, and Ga.\n\nOfficial policies about the use of SI prefixes with non-SI units vary slightly between the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) and the American [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST). For instance, the NIST advises that 'to avoid confusion, prefix symbols (and prefix names) are not used with the time-related unit symbols (names) min (minute), h (hour), d (day); nor with the angle-related symbols (names) \u00b0&nbsp;(degree), \u2032&nbsp;(minute), and \u2033&nbsp;(second)',<ref name=\"Special Publication 811\">{{Citation|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec06.html|title=Special Publication 811|edition=2008|last1=Thompson|first1=Ambler|last2=Taylor|first2=Barry N.|date=March 2008|work=NIST|access-date=21 June 2018|language=en}}</ref> whereas the BIPM adds information about the use of prefixes with the symbol ''as'' for arcsecond when they state: 'However astronomers use milliarcsecond, which they denote mas, and microarcsecond, \u03bcas, which they use as units for measuring very small angles.'<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/chapter3.html |title=SI Brochure: The International System of Units (SI) |publisher= International Bureau of Weights and Measures |access-date=5 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Presentation==\n\n===Pronunciation===\nWhen a metric prefix is affixed to a root word, the prefix carries the [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], while the root drops its stress but retains a full vowel in the syllable that is stressed when the root word stands alone.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} For example, ''[[kilobyte]]'' is {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u1d7b|l|\u0252|b|a\u026a|t}}, with stress on the first syllable. However, units in common use outside the scientific community may be stressed [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncratic_property|idiosyncratically]]. In English-speaking countries, ''kilometre'' is the most conspicuous example. It is often pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|\u1d7b|\u02c8|l|\u0252|m|\u1d7b|t|\u0259r}}, with [[reduced vowel]]s on both syllables of ''metre''.

While all metric prefixes in common use today are [[decimal|decadic]], historically there have been a number of [[binary number|binary]] metric prefixes as well.<ref name=\"fr\"/> Each prefix has a unique symbol that is prepended to the unit symbol. The prefix ''[[kilo-]]'', for example, may be added to ''gram'' to indicate ''multiplication'' by one thousand: one kilogram is equal to one thousand grams. The prefix ''[[milli-]]'', likewise, may be added to ''metre'' to indicate ''division'' by one thousand; one millimetre is equal to one thousandth of a metre.\n\nDecimal multiplicative prefixes have been a feature of all forms of the [[metric system]], with six of these dating back to the system's introduction in the 1790s. Metric prefixes have also been used with some non-metric units. The '''SI prefixes''' are metric prefixes that were standardized for use in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) by the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) in resolutions dating from 1960 to 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/si/prefixes.html |title=Four Resolutions |publisher=Bipm.org |access-date=1 March 2012}}</ref> Since 2009, they have formed part of the [[International System of Quantities]]. They are also used in the [[Unified Code for Units of Measure]] (UCUM)\n\n==List of SI prefixes==\nThe BIPM specifies twenty prefixes for the International System of Units (SI).\n\n{{SI prefixes (infobox)}}\n\nEach prefix name has a symbol that is used in combination with the symbols for units of measure. For example, the symbol for ''kilo-'' is k, and is used to produce km, kg, and kW, which are the SI symbols for kilometre, kilogram, and kilowatt, respectively. Except for the early prefixes of ''kilo-'', ''hecto-'', and ''deca-'', the symbols for the multiplicative prefixes are uppercase letters, and those for the fractional prefixes are lowercase letters.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/metric-prefixes-and-si-units/all |title=Metric Prefixes and SI Units |website=learn.sparkfun.com |access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref> There is a [[Unicode]] symbol for micro ''\u00b5'' for use if the Greek letter ''\u03bc'' is unavailable. When both are unavailable, the visually similar lowercase Latin letter ''u'' is commonly used instead. SI unit symbols are never in italics.\n\nPrefixes corresponding to an integer power of one thousand are generally preferred. Hence 100&nbsp;m is preferred over 1&nbsp;hm (hectometre) or 10&nbsp;dam (decametres). The prefixes ''hecto-'', ''deca-'', ''deci-'', and ''centi-'' are commonly used for everyday purposes, and the centimetre (cm) is especially common. However, some modern building codes require that the millimetre be used in preference to the centimetre, because \"use of centimetres leads to extensive usage of decimal points and confusion\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wbdg.org/ccb/GSAMAN/mdg.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215115519/http://wbdg.org/ccb/GSAMAN/mdg.pdf |archive-date=2011-12-15 |title=METRIC DESIGN GUIDE (PBS-PQ260) |author=Public Buildings Service, U.S. General Services Administration |date=September 1995 |website=National Institute of Building Sciences |accessdate=21 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nPrefixes may not be used in combination. This also applies to [[mass]], for which the [[SI base unit]] (kilogram) already contains a prefix. For example, milligram (mg) is used instead of microkilogram (\u03bckg).\n\nIn the arithmetic of measurements having units, the units are treated as multiplicative factors to values. If they have prefixes, all but one of the prefixes must be expanded to their numeric multiplier, except when combining values with identical units. Hence:\n* {{val|5|u=mV}} \u00d7 {{val|5|u=mA}} = {{val|5|e=-3|u=V}} \u00d7 {{val|5|e=-3|u=A}} = {{val|25|e=-6|u=V\u22c5A}} = {{val|25|u=uW}}.\n* {{val|5.00|u=mV}} + {{val|10|u=uV}} = {{val|5.00|u=mV}} + {{val|0.01|u=mV}} = {{val|5.01|u=mV}}.\n\nWhen [[Exponentiation|powers]] of units occur, for example, squared or cubed, the multiplicative prefix must be considered part of the unit, and thus included in the exponentiation:\n* 1&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> means one [[square kilometre]], or the [[area]] of a [[Square (geometry)|square]] of {{val|1000|u=m}} by {{val|1000|u=m}} and not {{val|1000}} [[square metre]]s.\n* 2&nbsp;Mm<sup>3</sup> means two cubic [[megametre]]s, or the [[volume]] of two [[cube]]s of {{val|1000000|u=m}} by {{val|1000000|u=m}} by {{val|1000000|u=m}} or {{val|2|e=18|u=m3}}, and not {{val|2000000}} [[cubic metre]]s ({{val|2|e=6|u=m3}}).\n\n;Examples\n* {{val|5|u=cm}} =&nbsp;{{val|5|e=-2|u=m}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|5 \u00d7 0.01 m}} =&nbsp;0.05&nbsp;m.\n* {{val|9|u=km2}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|9 \u00d7 (10<sup>3</sup> m)<sup>2</sup>}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|9 \u00d7 (10<sup>3</sup>)<sup>2</sup> \u00d7 m<sup>2</sup>}} =&nbsp;{{val|9|e=6|u=m2}} =&nbsp;{{nowrap|9 \u00d7 {{val|1000000|u=m2}}}} =&nbsp;{{val|9000000|u=m2}}.\n* 3&nbsp;MW =&nbsp;{{val|3|e=6|u=W}} =&nbsp;3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;{{val|1000000|u=W}} = {{val|3000000|u=W}}.\n\n== Application to units of measurement ==\nThe use of prefixes can be traced back to the introduction of the metric system in the 1790s, long before the 1960 introduction of the SI. The prefixes, including those introduced after 1960, are used with any metric unit, whether officially included in the SI or not (e.g., millidynes and milligauss). Metric prefixes may also be used with non-metric units.\n\nThe choice of prefixes with a given unit is usually dictated by convenience of use. Unit prefixes for amounts that are much larger or smaller than those actually encountered are seldom used.\n\n=== Metric units ===\n\n==== Mass ====\nThe units [[kilogram]], [[gram]], [[milligram]], microgram, and smaller are commonly used for measurement of [[mass]]. However, megagram, gigagram, and larger are rarely used; [[tonne]]s (and kilotonnes, megatonnes, etc.) or [[scientific notation]] are used instead. Megagram and teragram are occasionally used to disambiguate the metric tonne from other units with the name \"ton\".{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\nThe kilogram is the only base unit of the [[International System of Units]] that includes a metric prefix.\n\n====Volume====\nThe [[litre]] (equal to a cubic decimetre), millilitre (equal to a cubic centimetre), microlitre, and smaller are common. In Europe, the centilitre is often used for packaged products such as wine and the decilitre is used less frequently.\n\nLarger volumes are usually denoted in kilolitres, megalitres or gigalitres, or else in cubic metres (1 cubic metre = 1 kilolitre) or cubic kilometres (1 cubic kilometre = 1 teralitre). For scientific purposes, the cubic metre is usually used.\n\n====Length====\nThe kilometre, metre, centimetre, millimetre, and smaller are common. (However, the decimetre is rarely used.) The micrometre is often referred to by the non-SI term ''[[Micrometre#SI standardization|micron]]''. In some fields, such as [[chemistry]], the [[\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m]] (equal to 0.1&nbsp;nm) historically competed with the nanometre. The [[femtometre]], used mainly in particle physics, is sometimes called a [[fermi (unit)|fermi]]. For large scales, megametre, gigametre, and larger are rarely used. Instead, non-metric units are used, such as the [[solar radius]], [[astronomical unit]]s, [[light year]]s, and [[parsec]]s; the astronomical unit is mentioned in the SI standards as an accepted non-SI unit.\n\n====Time====\n{{see also|Metric time|Orders of magnitude (time)}}\nPrefixes for the SI standard unit [[second]] are most commonly encountered for quantities less than one second. For larger quantities, the system of [[minute]]s (60 seconds), [[hour]]s (60 minutes) and [[day]]s (24 hours) is [[Non-SI units mentioned in the SI|accepted for use with the SI]] and more commonly used. When speaking of spans of time, the length of the day is usually standardized to {{val|86,400}} seconds so as not to create issues with the irregular [[leap second]]. \n\nLarger multiples of the second such as kiloseconds and megaseconds are occasionally encountered in scientific contexts, but are seldom used in common parlance. For long-scale scientific work, particularly in [[astronomy]], the [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian year]] or ''annum'' is a standardized variant of the [[year]], equal to exactly {{val|31,557,600}} SI seconds (365 days, 6 hours). The unit is so named because it was the average length of a year in the  [[Julian calendar]]. Long time periods are then expressed by using metric prefixes with the annum, such as megaannum or gigaannum.\n\n====Angle====\nThe SI unit of angle is the [[radian]], but degrees, minutes, seconds and more rarely tierces see some scientific use.\n\n====Temperature====\nOfficial policy also varies from common practice for the degree Celsius (\u00b0C). NIST states:<ref name=\"Special Publication 811\"/> \"Prefix symbols may be used with the unit symbol \u00b0C and prefix names may be used with the unit name ''degree Celsius''. For example, 12&nbsp;m\u00b0C (12 millidegrees Celsius) is acceptable.\" In practice, it is more common for prefixes to be used with the [[kelvin]] when it is desirable to denote extremely large or small absolute temperatures or temperature differences. Thus, temperatures of star interiors may be given in units of MK (megakelvins), and molecular cooling may be described in mK (millikelvins).\n\n====Energy====\nIn use the [[joule]] and kilojoule are common, with larger multiples seen in limited contexts. In addition, the [[kilowatt hour]], a composite unit formed from the [[Watt#Kilowatt|kilowatt]] and hour, is often used for electrical energy; other multiples can be formed by modifying the prefix of watt (e.g. terawatt hour).\n\nThere exist a number of definitions for the non-SI unit, the [[calorie]]. There are gram calories and kilogram calories. One kilogram calorie, which equals one thousand gram calories, often appears capitalized and without a prefix (i.e. ''Cal'') when referring to \"[[Calorie|dietary calories]]\" in food.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unm.edu/~lkravitz/Article%20folder/remarkablecalorie.html |title=Remarkable Calorie |last=Conn |first=Carole |author2=Len Kravitz |publisher=University of New Mexico |accessdate=22 May 2017}}</ref> It is common to apply metric prefixes to the gram calorie, but not to the kilogram calorie: thus, 1&nbsp;kcal = 1000&nbsp;cal = 1&nbsp;Cal.\n\n===Non-metric units===\nMetric prefixes are widely used outside the system of [[metric system|metric units]]. Common examples include the [[megabyte]] and the [[decibel]]. Metric prefixes rarely appear with [[imperial units|imperial]] or [[United States customary units|US]] units except in some special cases (e.g., microinch, kilofoot, [[kilopound]]). They are also used with other specialized units used in particular fields (e.g., [[megaelectronvolt]], [[gigaparsec]], [[millibarn]]). They are also occasionally used with currency units (e.g., gigadollar), mainly by people who are familiar with the prefixes from scientific usage.{{cn|date=October 2019}} In astronomy, geology, and paleontology, the [[Year#Symbols|year]], with symbol a (from the Latin ''annus''), is commonly used with metric prefixes: [[Kiloannus|ka]], Ma, and Ga.\n\nOfficial policies about the use of SI prefixes with non-SI units vary slightly between the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) and the American [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST). For instance, the NIST advises that 'to avoid confusion, prefix symbols (and prefix names) are not used with the time-related unit symbols (names) min (minute), h (hour), d (day); nor with the angle-related symbols (names) \u00b0&nbsp;(degree), \u2032&nbsp;(minute), and \u2033&nbsp;(second)',<ref name=\"Special Publication 811\">{{Citation|url=http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP811/sec06.html|title=Special Publication 811|edition=2008|last1=Thompson|first1=Ambler|last2=Taylor|first2=Barry N.|date=March 2008|work=NIST|access-date=21 June 2018|language=en}}</ref> whereas the BIPM adds information about the use of prefixes with the symbol ''as'' for arcsecond when they state: 'However astronomers use milliarcsecond, which they denote mas, and microarcsecond, \u03bcas, which they use as units for measuring very small angles.'<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/si-brochure/chapter3.html |title=SI Brochure: The International System of Units (SI) |publisher= International Bureau of Weights and Measures |access-date=5 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Presentation==\n\n===Pronunciation===\nWhen a metric prefix is affixed to a root word, the prefix carries the [[stress (linguistics)|stress]], while the root drops its stress but retains a full vowel in the syllable that is stressed when the root word stands alone.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} For example, ''[[kilobyte]]'' is {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u1d7b|l|\u0252|b|a\u026a|t}}, with stress on the first syllable. However, units in common use outside the scientific community may be stressed [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncratic_property|idiosyncratically]]. In English-speaking countries, ''kilometre'' is the most conspicuous example. It is often pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|\u1d7b|\u02c8|l|\u0252|m|\u1d7b|t|\u0259r}}, with [[reduced vowel]]s on both syllables of ''metre''. This stress is not applied to other multiples or sub-multiples of metre, or to other units prefixed with ''kilo-''.\n\nThe prefix ''giga'' is usually pronounced in English as {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0261|\u026a|\u0261|\u0259}}, with hard \u27e8g\u27e9 as in ''get'', but sometimes {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|d\u0292|\u026a|\u0261|\u0259}}, with soft \u27e8g\u27e9 as in ''gin''.\n\n===Typesetting===\nThe [[LaTeX]] typesetting system features an ''SIunitx'' package in which the units of measurement are spelled out, for example, <code>\\SI{3}{\\tera\\hertz}</code> formats as \"3&nbsp;THz\".\n\n==Non-standard prefixes==\n[[File:Myriameterstein36R\u00fcdesheimRhein.JPG|thumb|Distance marker on the [[Rhine]]: 36 (XXXVI) myriametres from [[Basel]].

For example, one may talk of a ''40K salary'' ({{gaps|40|000}}), or call the [[Year 2000 problem]] the ''Y2K problem''. In these cases, an uppercase K is often used with an implied unit (although it could then be confused with the symbol for the kelvin temperature unit if the context is unclear). This informal postfix is read or spoken as 'thousand' or 'grand', or just 'k'.\n\nThe financial and general news media mostly use m/M, b/B and t/T as abbreviations for million, billion (10<sup>9</sup>) and trillion (10<sup>12</sup>), respectively, for large quantities, typically currency<ref>{{cite news |author=The Associated Press |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/02/13/obama-budget-congress.html |title=Obama unveils $3.8T budget proposal |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=13 February 2012 |access-date=1 March 2012}}</ref> and population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/128853-More_than_65M_Flock_to_Discovery_s_Planet_Earth.php |title=More than 65M Flock to Discovery's Planet Earth |publisher=Multichannel.com |access-date=1 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Medicine|medical]] and [[Automotive industry|automotive]] fields in the United States use the abbreviations ''cc'' or ''ccm'' for cubic centimetres. 1 [[cubic centimetre]] is equivalent to 1 [[millilitre]].\n\nFor nearly a century, engineers used the abbreviation ''MCM'' to designate a 'thousand [[circular mil]]s' in specifying the cross-sectional area of large [[Electric power transmission|electrical cables]].
