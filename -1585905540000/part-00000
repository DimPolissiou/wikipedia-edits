While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric [[heat pump]] has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very high [[coefficient of performance]] of heat pumps.\n\n\nThe economics of switching the demand side from fossil fuels to electricity for heating, will depend on the price of fuels vs electricity and the relative prices of the equipment. Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]]. Since thermostatically controlled loads have inherent energy storage, electrification of heating could provide a valuable resource to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid.\n\nAlternatives to electrification, include decarbonizing pipeline gas through [[power to gas]], [[biogas]], or other [[carbon-neutral fuels]].\n\nAt the beginning of this century 70% of all electricity was generated by fossil fuels, and as carbon free sources eventually make up half of the generation mix, replacing gas or oil furnaces and water heaters with electric ones will have a climate benefit. In areas like Norway, [[Brazil]], and [[Quebec]] that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water are common.\n\n=====Heat pump=====\n{{Main|Heat pump}}\n[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|upright|Outside unit of an air-source heat pump]]\nA heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a \"heat sink\". Heat pumps are designed to move [[thermal energy]] opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.\n\nWhile [[air conditioner]]s and [[freezer]]s are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term \"heat pump\" is more general and applies to many [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic [[heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration-type cycle]] used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction\u2014releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment. In this use, heat pumps generally draw heat from the cooler external air or from the ground.<ref>[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy01osti/28037.pdf Air-source heat pumps] [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] June 2011</ref> In heating mode, heat pumps are three to four times [[efficient energy use|more efficient]] in their use of electric power than simple electrical resistance heaters.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nIt has been concluded that heat pumps are the single technology that could reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of households better than every other technology that is available on the market.

Without a high share{{quantify|date=October 2019}} of low-carbon electricity, a domestic heat pump will produce more carbon emissions than using natural gas.<ref>[http://www.energysolutionscenter.org/assets/1/Page/GHP_Position_Paper_and_apndx_031710.pdf pg 7]</ref>\n\n==Energy conservation==\n\n\n===Energy efficiency===\n{{Main|Efficient energy use|Energy conservation}}Efficient energy use, sometimes simply called \"energy efficiency\", is the goal of efforts to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services. For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. \n\nEnergy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing [[world energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses reducing demand for a service service, for example through behavioral change, as well as encompassing energy efficiency. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter or driving less. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms. This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels.<ref>Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.</ref>\n\nReducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[energy-efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&itemid=2929&language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>\n\n===Smart grid===\n{{Main|Smart grid}}\nExpanding intermittent electrical sources, such as [[wind power]], creates a growing problem balancing grid fluctuations. Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental [[super grid]]s costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power, there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittency, power failures and peak demands. Having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a [[smart grid]].\n\n[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.\n\n[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits.\n\n[[Demand response]] devices can receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This allows electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. [[Vehicle-to-grid]] uses a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.\n\n===Lifestyle and behavior===\n\nThe [[IPCC]] [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] emphasises that behaviour, lifestyle, and cultural change have a high mitigation potential in some sectors, particularly when complementing technological and structural change.<ref name=\"edenhofer-etal-2014\">{{cite book\n|first1= Ottmar | last1= Edenhofer\n|first2= Ram\u00f3n | last2= Pichs-Madruga\n|display-authors= etal\n|editor= IPCC\n|year= 2014\n|title= Climate change 2014: mitigation of climate change.

Personal cars are extremely inefficient at moving passengers, while [[public transport]] and bicycles are many times more efficient (as is the simplest form of human transportation, walking). All of these are encouraged by urban/community planning and are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Inefficient [[land use]] development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.\n\nAt the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These [[smart growth]] practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space. These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nApproaches such as [[New Urbanism]] and [[transit-oriented development]] seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage [[public transit]] and make [[walking]] and [[cycling]] more attractive options. This is achieved through \"medium-density\", [[mixed-use development|mixed-use planning]] and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.<!--Energy usage comparisons done in the book \"Sustainability and Cities\" by Peter Newman and Jeff Kentworthy.-->\n\nSmarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.\n\n====Building design====\n{{Main|Sustainable architecture|Green building}}\n\nEmissions from [[house|housing]] are substantial,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.est.org.uk/myhome/climatechange/stats/homeenvironment/ |title=Energy Saving Trust: Home and the environment |publisher=[[Energy Saving Trust]] |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> and government-supported energy efficiency programmes can make a difference.<ref>{{cite news\n|last= Osborne\n|first= Hilary\n|title= Energy efficiency 'saves \u00a3350m a year'\n|newspaper= Guardian Unlimited\n|date= 2005-08-02\n|url= http://money.guardian.co.uk/utilities/story/0,11992,1541051,00.html?gusrc=ticker-103704\n|location=London}}</ref>\n\nNew buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources.

Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.\n*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the \"polluter-pays principle\", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:\n**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;29).<ref name=goldemberg>{{cite book\n|year=1996\n|author=Goldemberg, J.\n|title=Introduction: scope of the assessment.

Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].\n**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit{{cn|date=November 2019}} from reducing their emissions.\n\n====Specific proposals====\n*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;106),<ref name=banuri/> for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.\n*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;106\u2013107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.\n*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;27).<ref name=goldemberg/> In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource.

These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.<ref name=\"Evans\">Evans. J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon</ref>\n\n====Funding====\n{{main|Climate Finance}}\nFunding, such as the [[Green Climate Fund]], is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.<ref name=\"Evans\"/> The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which [[land degradation]] and [[persistent organic pollutant]] were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF's implementing agencies.<ref>Mee. L. D, Dublin. H.

A (2008) Evaluating the Global Environment Facility: A goodwill gesture or a serious attempt to deliver global benefits?, Global Environmental Change 18, 800\u2013810</ref>\n\n====Problems====\nThere are numerous issues which result in a current perceived lack of implementation.<ref name=\"Evans\"/> It has been suggested that the main barriers to implementation are Uncertainty, Fragmentation, Institutional void, Short time horizon of policies and politicians and Missing motives and willingness to start adapting. The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.<ref name=\"IHDP\">Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat.

One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund<ref>[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit</ref> is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.\n\nAn important point of contention, however, is how [[overseas development]] assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.<ref name=ODI>Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.<ref name=ODI/> Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:<ref name=ODI/>\n# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];\n# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;\n# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and\n# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.\nThe main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref name=ODI/>\n\nHowever, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.\n\nIn an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] \"which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services\".<ref>[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&Cr=trade&Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2019 week of climate action in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] result in a declaration in which leaders says that they will act to reduce emissions in the sectors of transportation, energy, urbanism, industry, forest conservation and land use and \"sent a message of solidarity with all the people of Brazil suffering the consequences of the [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|rainforest fires in the Amazon region]], underscoring that protecting the world's forests is a collective responsibility, that forests are vital for life and that they are a critical part of the solution to climate change\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 Key Messages for the UN Climate Action Summit |url=https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/LACCW%202019%20Messages%20for%20UN%20Climate%20Action%20Summit.pdf |website=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Latin American & Caribbean Climate Week Calls for Urgent, Ambitious Action |url=https://unfccc.int/news/latin-american-caribbean-climate-week-calls-for-urgent-ambitious-action |website=United Nations Climate Change |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Non-governmental approaches==\nWhile many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.\n\n===Choices in personal actions and business operations===\nEnvironmental groups encourage [[individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]].

While the system efficiency of a gas furnace may be higher than the combination of natural gas power plant and electric heat, the combination of the same natural gas power plant and an electric [[heat pump]] has lower emissions per unit of heat delivered in all but the coldest climates. This is possible because of the very high [[coefficient of performance]] of heat pumps.\n\n\nThe economics of switching the demand side from fossil fuels to electricity for heating, will depend on the price of fuels vs electricity and the relative prices of the equipment. Electrifying heating loads may also provide a flexible resource that can participate in [[demand response]]. Since thermostatically controlled loads have inherent energy storage, electrification of heating could provide a valuable resource to integrate variable renewable resources into the grid.\n\nAlternatives to electrification, include decarbonizing pipeline gas through [[power to gas]], [[biogas]], or other [[carbon-neutral fuels]].\n\nAt the beginning of this century 70% of all electricity was generated by fossil fuels, and as carbon free sources eventually make up half of the generation mix, replacing gas or oil furnaces and water heaters with electric ones will have a climate benefit. In areas like Norway, [[Brazil]], and [[Quebec]] that have abundant hydroelectricity, electric heat and hot water are common.\n\n=====Heat pump=====\n{{Main|Heat pump}}\n[[File:Outunit of heat pump.jpg|thumb|upright|Outside unit of an air-source heat pump]]\nA heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a \"heat sink\". Heat pumps are designed to move [[thermal energy]] opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses some amount of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat sink.\n\nWhile [[air conditioner]]s and [[freezer]]s are familiar examples of heat pumps, the term \"heat pump\" is more general and applies to many [[HVAC]] (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) devices used for space heating or space cooling. When a heat pump is used for heating, it employs the same basic [[heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration-type cycle]] used by an air conditioner or a refrigerator, but in the opposite direction\u2014releasing heat into the conditioned space rather than the surrounding environment.

For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. \n\nEnergy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily growing [[world energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |date= |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in that it encompasses reducing demand for a service service, for example through behavioral change, as well as encompassing energy efficiency. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements would be heating a room less in winter or driving less. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms. This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of fossil fuels.<ref>Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.</ref>\n\nReducing energy use is seen as a key solution to the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[energy-efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&itemid=2929&language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref>\n\n===Smart grid===\n{{Main|Smart grid}}\nExpanding intermittent electrical sources, such as [[wind power]], creates a growing problem balancing grid fluctuations. Some of the plans include building pumped storage or continental [[super grid]]s costing billions of dollars. However instead of building for more power, there are a variety of ways to affect the size and timing of electricity demand on the consumer side. Designing for reduced demands on a smaller power grid is more efficient and economic than having extra generation and transmission for intermittency, power failures and peak demands. Having these abilities is one of the chief aims of a [[smart grid]].\n\n[[Net energy metering#Time of use metering|Time of use]] metering is a common way to motivate electricity users to reduce their peak load consumption. For instance, running dishwashers and laundry at night after the peak has passed, reduces electricity costs.\n\n[[Dynamic demand]] plans have devices passively shut off when stress is sensed on the electrical grid. This method may work very well with thermostats, when power on the grid sags a small amount, a low power temperature setting is automatically selected reducing the load on the grid. For instance millions of refrigerators reduce their consumption when clouds pass over solar installations. Consumers need to have a [[smart meter]] in order for the utility to calculate credits.\n\n[[Demand response]] devices can receive all sorts of messages from the grid. The message could be a request to use a low power mode similar to dynamic demand, to shut off entirely during a sudden failure on the grid, or notifications about the current and expected prices for power. This allows electric cars to recharge at the least expensive rates independent of the time of day. [[Vehicle-to-grid]] uses a car's battery or fuel cell to supply the grid temporarily.\n\n===Lifestyle and behavior===\n\nThe [[IPCC]] [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report]] emphasises that behaviour, lifestyle, and cultural change have a high mitigation potential in some sectors, particularly when complementing technological and structural change.<ref name=\"edenhofer-etal-2014\">{{cite book\n|first1= Ottmar | last1= Edenhofer\n|first2= Ram\u00f3n | last2= Pichs-Madruga\n|display-authors= etal\n|editor= IPCC\n|year= 2014\n|title= Climate change 2014: mitigation of climate change.

Several scientific studies have shown that when relatively rich people wish to reduce their carbon footprint, there are a few key actions they can take such as living [[car-free movement|car-free]] (2.4 tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>), avoiding one round-trip transatlantic flight (1.6 tonnes) and eating a [[plant-based diet]] (0.8 tonnes).<ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017>{{cite journal |title= The climate mitigation gap: education and government recommendations miss the most effective individual actions |journal= Environmental Research Letters |first1= Seth |last1= Wynes |first2= Kimberly A |last2= Nicholas |date= 12 July 2017 |volume= 12 |page= 074024 |number= 7 |doi= 10.1088/1748-9326/aa7541 |bibcode= 2017ERL....12g4024W}}</ref>\n\nThese appear to differ significantly from the popular advice for \"greening\" one's lifestyle, which seem to fall mostly into the \"low-impact\" category: Replacing a typical car with a hybrid (0.52 tonnes); Washing clothes in cold water (0.25 tonnes); Recycling (0.21 tonnes); Upgrading light bulbs (0.10 tonnes); etc. The researchers found that public discourse on reducing one's carbon footprint overwhelmingly focuses on low-impact behaviors, and that mention of the high-impact behaviors is almost non-existent in the mainstream media, government publications, school textbooks, etc.<ref name=Wynes-Nicholas-2017/><ref name=Ceballos-Ehrlich-2017-05>{{cite journal |last1=Ceballos|first1=Gerardo|last2=Ehrlich|first2=Paul P |last3=Dirzo|first3=Rodolfo|date=23 May 2017|title=Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/07/05/1704949114.full|journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]|volume=114|issue=30|pages=E6089\u2013E6096|quote=Much less frequently mentioned are, however, the ultimate drivers of those immediate causes of biotic destruction, namely, human overpopulation and continued population growth, and overconsumption, especially by the rich.

Personal cars are extremely inefficient at moving passengers, while [[public transport]] and bicycles are many times more efficient (as is the simplest form of human transportation, walking). All of these are encouraged by urban/community planning and are an effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Inefficient [[land use]] development practices have increased infrastructure costs as well as the amount of energy needed for transportation, community services, and buildings.\n\nAt the same time, a growing number of citizens and government officials have begun advocating a smarter approach to land use planning. These [[smart growth]] practices include compact community development, multiple transportation choices, mixed land uses, and practices to conserve green space. These programs offer environmental, economic, and quality-of-life benefits; and they also serve to reduce energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nApproaches such as [[New Urbanism]] and [[transit-oriented development]] seek to reduce distances travelled, especially by private vehicles, encourage [[public transit]] and make [[walking]] and [[cycling]] more attractive options. This is achieved through \"medium-density\", [[mixed-use development|mixed-use planning]] and the concentration of housing within walking distance of [[town center]]s and [[transport node]]s.<!--Energy usage comparisons done in the book \"Sustainability and Cities\" by Peter Newman and Jeff Kentworthy.-->\n\nSmarter growth land use policies have both a direct and indirect effect on energy consuming behavior. For example, transportation energy usage, the number one user of petroleum fuels, could be significantly reduced through more compact and mixed use land development patterns, which in turn could be served by a greater variety of non-automotive based transportation choices.\n\n====Building design====\n{{Main|Sustainable architecture|Green building}}\n\nEmissions from [[house|housing]] are substantial,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.est.org.uk/myhome/climatechange/stats/homeenvironment/ |title=Energy Saving Trust: Home and the environment |publisher=[[Energy Saving Trust]] |accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> and government-supported energy efficiency programmes can make a difference.<ref>{{cite news\n|last= Osborne\n|first= Hilary\n|title= Energy efficiency 'saves \u00a3350m a year'\n|newspaper= Guardian Unlimited\n|date= 2005-08-02\n|url= http://money.guardian.co.uk/utilities/story/0,11992,1541051,00.html?gusrc=ticker-103704\n|location=London}}</ref>\n\nNew buildings can be constructed using [[passive solar building design]], [[low-energy building]], or [[zero-energy building]] techniques, using [[renewable heat]] sources.

Consumption above basic needs would require countries to buy more emission rights. From this viewpoint, developing countries would need to be at least as well off under an emissions control regime as they would be outside the regime.\n*'''Proportionality and polluter-pays principle''': Proportionality reflects the ancient [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] principle that people should receive in proportion to what they put in, and pay in proportion to the damages they cause. This has a potential relationship with the \"polluter-pays principle\", which can be interpreted in a number of ways:\n**''Historical responsibilities'': this asserts that allocation of emission rights should be based on patterns of past emissions. Two-thirds of the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere at present is due to the past actions of developed countries (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;29).<ref name=goldemberg>{{cite book\n|year=1996\n|author=Goldemberg, J.\n|title=Introduction: scope of the assessment.

Ways to assess burdens include monetary costs per head of population, as well as other, more complex measures, like the [[UNDP]]'s [[Human Development Index]].\n**''[[Willingness to pay]]'': with this approach, countries take on emission reductions based on their ability to pay along with how much they benefit{{cn|date=November 2019}} from reducing their emissions.\n\n====Specific proposals====\n*'''Ad hoc''': Lashof (1992) and Cline (1992) (referred to by Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;106),<ref name=banuri/> for example, suggested that allocations based partly on [[GNP]] could be a way of sharing the burdens of emission reductions. This is because GNP and economic activity are partially tied to carbon emissions.\n*'''Equal per capita entitlements''': this is the most widely cited method of distributing abatement costs, and is derived from egalitarianism (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, pp.&nbsp;106\u2013107). This approach can be divided into two categories. In the first category, emissions are allocated according to national population. In the second category, emissions are allocated in a way that attempts to account for historical (cumulative) emissions.\n*'''Status quo''': with this approach, historical emissions are ignored, and current emission levels are taken as a status quo right to emit (Banuri ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;107). An analogy for this approach can be made with [[fishery|fisheries]], which is a common, limited resource. The analogy would be with the atmosphere, which can be viewed as an exhaustible [[natural resource]] (Goldemberg ''et al.'', 1996, p.&nbsp;27).<ref name=goldemberg/> In [[international law]], one state recognized the long-established use of another state's use of the fisheries resource.

These can be targets set by international bodies or voluntary action by individuals or institutions. This is the most important, expensive and least appealing aspect of environmental governance.<ref name=\"Evans\">Evans. J (forthcoming 2012) Environmental Governance, Routledge, Oxon</ref>\n\n====Funding====\n{{main|Climate Finance}}\nFunding, such as the [[Green Climate Fund]], is often provided by nations, groups of nations and increasingly NGO and private sources. These funds are often channelled through the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). This is an environmental funding mechanism in the World Bank which is designed to deal with global environmental issues.<ref name=\"Evans\"/> The GEF was originally designed to tackle four main areas: biological diversity, climate change, international waters and ozone layer depletion, to which [[land degradation]] and [[persistent organic pollutant]] were added. The GEF funds projects that are agreed to achieve global environmental benefits that are endorsed by governments and screened by one of the GEF's implementing agencies.<ref>Mee. L. D, Dublin. H.

The relationships between many climatic processes can cause large levels of uncertainty as they are not fully understood and can be a barrier to implementation. When information on climate change is held between the large numbers of actors involved it can be highly dispersed, context specific or difficult to access causing fragmentation to be a barrier. Institutional void is the lack of commonly accepted rules and norms for policy processes to take place, calling into question the legitimacy and efficacy of policy processes. The Short time horizon of policies and politicians often means that climate change policies are not implemented in favour of socially favoured societal issues. Statements are often posed to keep the illusion of political action to prevent or postpone decisions being made. Missing motives and willingness to start adapting is a large barrier as it prevents any implementation.<ref name=\"IHDP\">Biesbroek. G.R, Termeer. C.J.A.M, Kabat.

One of the means of achieving this is the Kyoto Protocol's [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM). The [[World Bank]]'s Prototype Carbon Fund<ref>[http://carbonfinance.org/pcf/ Prototype Carbon Fund] from the World Bank Carbon Finance Unit</ref> is a [[public private partnership]] that operates within the CDM.\n\nAn important point of contention, however, is how [[overseas development]] assistance not directly related to climate change mitigation is affected by funds provided to climate change mitigation.<ref name=ODI>Jessica Brown, Neil Bird and Liane Schalatek (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4931&title=climate-finance-additionality-definitions-implications Climate finance additionality: emerging definitions and their implications] [[Overseas Development Institute]]</ref> One of the outcomes of the UNFCC [[Copenhagen Climate Conference]] was the [[Copenhagen Accord]], in which developed countries promised to provide US$30&nbsp;million between 2010 and 2012 of new and additional resources.<ref name=ODI/> Yet it remains unclear what exactly the definition of additional is and the [[European Commission]] has requested its member states to define what they understand to be additional, and researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have found four main understandings:<ref name=ODI/>\n# Climate finance classified as aid, but additional to (over and above) the [[Millennium Development Goals#Funding commitment|'0.7%' ODA target]];\n# Increase on previous year's [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA) spent on climate change mitigation;\n# Rising ODA levels that include climate change finance but where it is limited to a specified percentage; and\n# Increase in climate finance not connected to ODA.\nThe main point being that there is a conflict between the [[OECD]] states budget deficit cuts, the need to help developing countries adapt to develop sustainably and the need to ensure that funding does not come from cutting aid to other important [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref name=ODI/>\n\nHowever, none of these initiatives suggest a quantitative cap on the emissions from developing countries. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} of mitigation often argue that, the developing countries' drive to attain a comparable living standard to the developed countries would doom the attempt at mitigation of global warming. Critics{{Who|date=May 2010}} also argue that holding down emissions would shift the human cost of global warming from a general one to one that was borne most heavily by the poorest populations on the planet.\n\nIn an attempt to provide more opportunities for developing countries to adapt clean technologies, [[UNEP]] and [[WTO]] urged the international community to reduce trade barriers and to conclude the [[Doha Development Round|Doha trade round]] \"which includes opening trade in environmental goods and services\".<ref>[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=31278&Cr=trade&Cr1=environment# Free trade can help combat global warming, finds UN report] UN News Centre, 26 June 2009</ref>\n\nIn 2019 week of climate action in [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] result in a declaration in which leaders says that they will act to reduce emissions in the sectors of transportation, energy, urbanism, industry, forest conservation and land use and \"sent a message of solidarity with all the people of Brazil suffering the consequences of the [[Deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|rainforest fires in the Amazon region]], underscoring that protecting the world's forests is a collective responsibility, that forests are vital for life and that they are a critical part of the solution to climate change\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 Key Messages for the UN Climate Action Summit |url=https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/LACCW%202019%20Messages%20for%20UN%20Climate%20Action%20Summit.pdf |website=Latin America and Caribbean Climate Week 2019 |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Latin American & Caribbean Climate Week Calls for Urgent, Ambitious Action |url=https://unfccc.int/news/latin-american-caribbean-climate-week-calls-for-urgent-ambitious-action |website=United Nations Climate Change |accessdate=25 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Non-governmental approaches==\nWhile many of the proposed methods of mitigating global warming require governmental funding, legislation and regulatory action, individuals and [[business action on climate change|businesses]] can also play a part in the mitigation effort.\n\n===Choices in personal actions and business operations===\nEnvironmental groups encourage [[individual and political action on climate change|individual action against global warming]], often aimed at the [[consumer]].

The ECW Championship became a third concurrently active world championship in the WWE.\n|ref      = <ref name=\"RVD1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/2908088 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719133744/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/2908088 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2006-07-19 |title=Rob Van Dam's first reign |publisher=WWE |accessdate=2007-03-17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2006/1150081251.shtml|title=ECW One Night Stand PPV Results \u2013 6/11/06|publisher=WrestleView|accessdate=2009-11-24|date= 2006-06-11|first=Adam|last=Martin}}</ref>\n}}{{PWtitlereign\n|sort number = 0.5\n|type = promotion\n|name = [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE): [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]]\n}}{{PWtitlereign\n|number   = 80\n|champion = {{sortname||Edge|dab=wrestler}}\n|reign    = 2\n|date     = {{dts|July 3, 2006}}\n|days     = {{age in days nts|July 3, 2006|September 17, 2006}}\n|days2    = yes\n|location = [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, PA]]\n|event    = ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]''\n|notes    = This was a [[triple threat match]] also involving [[John Cena]].<br />The title became exclusive to the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] brand due to Edge's status as a Raw wrestler.\n|ref      = <ref name=\"Edge2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/2999952 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705232057/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/2999952 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2006-07-05 |title=Edge's second reign |publisher=WWE |accessdate=2007-03-17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2006/07/04/1667256.html| title=Raw: Edge wins WWE title|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer|SLAM!

Since he was the king of Serbia during a period of great Serbian military success, he was remembered by [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[people]] as '''King Peter the Liberator''', and also known as '''Old King'''.\n\nPeter was [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e]]'s grandson and third son of [[Persida Nenadovi\u0107]] and Prince [[Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, Prince of Serbia|Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]], who was forced to abdicate. Peter lived with his family in exile. He fought with the [[France|French]] Foreign Legion in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. He joined as volunteer under the alias Peter Mrkonji\u0107 in the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875\u201377)]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nHe married [[Princess Zorka of Montenegro]], daughter of [[Nicholas of Montenegro|King Nicholas]], in 1883. She gave birth to his five children, including Prince [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]]. After the death of his father in 1885, Peter became head of the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]]. After [[May Coup (Serbia)|a military coup d'\u00e9tat]] and the murder of King [[Aleksandar Obrenovi\u0107|Alexander I Obrenovi\u0107]] in 1903, Peter became King of Serbia. As king, he advocated a constitutional setup for the country and was famous for his libertarian politics.\n\nKing Peter was the supreme commander of the Serbian army in the [[Balkan wars]]. Because of his age, on 24 June 1914, he proclaimed his son, [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]], heir-apparent to the throne, as regent. In the [[First World War]] he and his army [[Serbian army's retreat through Albania|retreated across]] the [[Principality of Albania]].\n\n==Early life==\nPeter was born in [[Belgrade]] on {{OldStyleDate|11 July|1844|29 June}}, the fifth of Prince [[Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, Prince of Serbia|Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]] and his consort [[Persida Nenadovi\u0107]]'s ten children.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=95}} He was the grandson of [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e]], the leader of the [[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804\u20131813) and the founder of the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]].{{sfn|Judah|2000|p=83}} Peter was not born in the Royal Court, which was undergoing renovations at the time, but at the home of merchant [[Mi\u0161a Anastasijevi\u0107]]. His birth was not met with much celebration because he was his parents' third son and his older brother Svetozar was the heir to the throne.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=95}} His parents' oldest son, Aleksa, had died three years prior to Peter's birth, aged five, at which point Svetozar became heir. Peter did not become heir until Svetozar's death in 1847 at the age of six.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|loc=p. 95, note 2}} Besides Belgrade, Peter spent much of his childhood in the town of [[Topola]], from where the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty originated. He received his elementary education in Belgrade.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=95}}\n\n==Exile==\n\n===Post-secondary education and Franco-Prussian War===\n[[File:Petar Karadjordjevic 1865.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Peter, {{circa|1865}}]]\nIn 1858, just as the fourteen-year-old Peter was preparing to depart for [[Geneva]] to attend high school, his father was forced to abdicate the throne. The Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty's rivals, the [[Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty]], were reinstated, and an Obrenovi\u0107 prince, [[Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107|Mihailo]], claimed the throne.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=96}} The two dynasties had been vying for power since 1817, when Kara\u0111or\u0111e was assassinated on the orders of [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107]],   the founder of the Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty.{{sfn|Judah|2000|pp=53, 56}}\n\nPeter left Geneva for Paris in 1861 and enrolled in the [[Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Barbe]], located in the heart of the city's [[Latin Quarter, Paris|Latin Quarter]]. The following year, Peter enrolled in the ''[[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]]'', France's most prestigious military academy. He graduated from the academy in 1864, and continued living in Paris for some time thereafter. During this period, he pursued interests such as photography and painting, and read works of political philosophy, learning about [[liberalism]], [[parliamentarism]] and [[democracy]]. In 1866, he entered the Higher Military School in [[Metz]], which he attended until the following year.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=96}} Two years later, his [[Serbian language|Serbian]]-language translation of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[On Liberty]]'' was published.{{sfn|Shrader|2014|p=1244}}\n\nAt the outbreak of the 1870\u201371 [[Franco-Prussian War]], Peter joined the [[French Foreign Legion]] under the pseudonym Petar Kara, together with relative Nikola Nikolajevi\u0107.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=96}} During his service, Peter held the rank of either [[lieutenant]]{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=96}} or [[second lieutenant]],{{sfn|Lepage|2008|p=57}} depending on the source, and fought with the [[1st Foreign Regiment]].{{sfn|Lepage|2008|p=57}} He participated in the [[Second Battle of Orl\u00e9ans (1870)|Second Battle of Orl\u00e9ans]] on 3\u20134 December 1870, as well as the [[Battle of Villersexel]] on 9 January 1871. He was awarded the [[Legion of Honour]] for his conduct during the two battles, but was captured by the Prussians shortly thereafter. He managed to escape captivity and returned to the front. Peter was involved in the [[Paris Commune]] in the spring of 1871, together with close friend and relative Vladimir Ljoti\u0107, though the exact nature of his involvement remains unknown.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=96}}\n\n===Guerrilla activities===\n[[File:Petar Karadjordjevic 1875.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Peter in guerrilla uniform, {{circa|1875}}]]\nWith the outbreak of the [[Great Eastern Crisis]] of 1875\u201378, which erupted after [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serb]] rebels in [[Nevesinje]] [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875\u201377)|staged a revolt]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]], Peter returned to the [[Balkans]] and fought the Ottomans in northwestern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. He adopted the ''[[nom de guerre]]'' of Petar Mrkonji\u0107, and upon reaching the regions of [[Banovina (region)|Banija]] and [[Kordun]] in [[Austria-Hungary]], took control of guerrilla unit of about 200 men.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=96}} He arrived [[Dubica, Bosnia-Herzegovina|Bosanska Dubica]] in August 1875, but received a cold welcome. He discovered that Prince [[Milan I of Serbia|Milan]] of Serbia was plotting to assassinate him fearing that Peter would attempt to wrest back the throne from the Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty. This revelation, combined with a string of battlefield defeats, compelled Peter and his followers to leave Bosnia and withdraw to Austria-Hungary. They were subsequently detained by the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] in the village of [[Bojna, Croatia|Bojna]], near [[Glina, Croatia|Glina]]. Peter escaped, returned to Bosnia and organized another band of rebels. Once again, his involvement in the fighting aroused suspicion in Belgrade, and by May 1876, his presence proved divisive. The rebels split into three separate camps: one that supported Peter, another that supported Milan and a third that advocated Austro-Hungarian arbitration. Not wishing to cause further divisions among the rebels, Peter agreed to leave Bosnia. Prior to his departure, he wrote a letter to Milan explaining why he was leaving the battlefield and offering to make peace with the Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=97}}\n\nDespite his attempts to make peace with Milan, accusations of treason continued to be levelled against Peter. He decided to travel to [[Kragujevac]], the seat of the Royal Serbian Government, and address the [[National Assembly of Serbia|National Assembly]] in an attempt to clear his name. In 1877, an anti-government uprising erupted in the [[Toplica District|Toplica]] region of southern Serbia, for which Milan blamed Peter and Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 sympathizers. Peter was accused of treachery and collaboration with the Ottomans. In the summer of 1878, he illegally crossed the border between Serbia and Austria-Hungary at [[Golubac]] via the [[Danube]]. Peter and his guide became lost in the [[Homolje mountains]] and were forced to hide from the authorities in the wilderness. Peter returned to Austria-Hungary shortly thereafter, but was arrested by the Austro-Hungarian police and interned at the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 family home in [[Bocsig|Bokszeg]]. In 1878, he was allowed to leave Bokszeg. He first went to [[Budapest]] and then to Paris. During this period, he was closely monitored by Austro-Hungarian spies, who took note of all his movements.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=97}} In January 1879, court proceedings were initiated against Peter and his closest companions in [[Smederevo]]. The plaintiff, Prince Milan, alleged that Peter and his followers had attempted to overthrow the Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty and place a Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 on the throne. Peter and his companions were charged with high treason, for which the mandatory penalty was death. As he was living in Paris at the time of the proceedings, Peter was convicted ''[[in absentia]]'' and sentenced to death by [[hanging]].{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=98}}\n\n===Move to Cetinje===\n[[File:Petar arsen zorka.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Peter ''(far left, standing)'' with his family]]\nIn 1883, Peter moved to [[Cetinje]], the capital of the second independent [[Serbs|Serb]] state, [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]], with the intention of marrying the eldest daughter of Montenegro's ruler, Prince [[Nicholas of Montenegro|Nicholas]]. Peter and [[Princess Zorka of Montenegro|Ljubica Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]] were married in Cetinje in the summer of 1883. The marriage upset the region's volatile geopolitical balance, causing great unease in the Austro-Hungarian, Russian and Serbian capitals. Belgrade perceived it as a sign of increasing closeness between the [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]] and Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasties. Relations between the two Serb states worsened, as did relations between Austria-Hungary and Russia, which had been vying for power in the Balkans for decades.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=98}}\n\nWhen his father died in the spring of 1885, Peter became the head of the House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 and took the title of prince. Serbia, previously a [[principality]], was declared a [[Realm|kingdom]] in 1882, and henceforth, the Serbian monarch used the title [[King of Serbia]]. Ljubica died during childbirth in March 1890. The couple had five children, three of whom reached adulthood: [[Princess Helen of Serbia|Helen]] (Jelena), Milena, [[George, Crown Prince of Serbia|George]] (\u0110or\u0111e), [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]] (Aleksandar), and Andrew (Andrej). Milena died in infancy and Andrew died along with his mother during childbirth.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=98}}\n\nFollowing his father's death, Peter's financial situation deteriorated and he became dependent on his father-in-law, as well as [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and his brother George, for support. Following the [[Royal Serbian Army]]'s rout in the [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]] of 1885, Peter and Nicholas devised a plan to invade Serbia and overthrow the Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty. At the last minute, Nicholas abandoned the idea. Peter felt betrayed by the Prince's decision to back out, leading to long lasting animosity. Nevertheless, he remained in Cetinje until 1894, devoting himself to his surviving children, who finished their primary education there.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=98}} In 1894, Peter moved to Geneva with his three children, where he was to remain until 1903.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=99}} In 1899, Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] invited Prince George and Prince Alexander, as well as Peter's nephew [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Paul]], to attend the ''[[Page Corps|Corps des Pages]]'' [[military academy]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] free of charge. Due to his poor financial standing, which prevented him from sending the boys to private schools in Switzerland, Peter accepted the Tsar's offer.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|pp=381\u2013382}}\n\n===May Overthrow===\n{{main article|May Coup (Serbia)}}\nIn July 1900, King [[Alexander I of Serbia|Alexander]], Milan's 23-year-old son, married [[Draga Ma\u0161in]], a widowed [[lady-in-waiting]] twelve years his senior with a reputation for [[promiscuity]]. Ma\u0161in was also believed to be infertile, raising questions as to the viability of the Obrenovi\u0107 line. The marriage sparked outrage among the officer corps and led to a plot to remove Alexander from the throne. The officers, led by [[Dragutin Dimitrijevi\u0107]] (\"Apis\"), initially sought to expel Alexander and Draga but realized that doing so would precipitate a conflict between the pro-Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 and pro-Obrenovi\u0107 camps within the country. By the autumn of 1901, the conspirators resolved to kill the King and Queen, thereby averting a possible civil war. Some officers proposed placing an English or German prince on the throne. Another suggested Prince [[Prince Mirko of Montenegro|Mirko]], the second son of Nicholas of Montenegro, and others advocated forming a [[republic]].{{sfn|Mackenzie|1989|pp=31\u201334}} Political conditions in Europe were such that the proclamation of a republic would only have increased the ire of the [[Great Powers]] towards Serbia in case Alexander was overthrown, giving Austria-Hungary a pretext to invade.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1989|p=48}}\n\nPreparations for the coup took place between 1901 and 1903. The conspirators decided to place Peter on the throne in November 1901, but Peter had little trust in them and their initial offers were rebuffed. He accepted their offers on the condition that officers he trusted would take part in the plot and insisted that he would not take any part himself. He also told the officers that he would agree to take the throne only if his ascent was approved by the National Assembly. At the time of the coup, Peter was vacationing with his children and planning visits to Russia and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], suggesting that he was not aware of what was to occur.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=99}} The officers [[May Coup (Serbia)|raided the royal palace]] late in the evening of {{OldStyleDate|10 June|1903|29 May}} and shot the King and Queen, mutilating their corpses with sabres and tossing them from a third-floor balcony.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1989|pp=46\u201347}} The murders resulted in the extinction of the Obrenovi\u0107 line and resolved the century-long feud between the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 and Obrenovi\u0107 dynasties.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1989|p=48}} Peter expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the plot, as well as regret for the bloodshed that had occurred, describing it as \"neither gentlemanly, nor worthy of the 20th century\".

Austria-Hungary declared its neutrality on the matter, but privately, policymakers in [[Vienna]] expressed hope that Peter's accession would have a placating effect. The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] demanded that the chief conspirators be severely punished, and when the Royal Serbian Government neglected to carry out this request, the British severed all diplomatic ties.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1989|pp=50\u201351}} Several other European nations followed in the United Kingdom's footsteps and severed ties as well.{{sfn|Singleton|1985|p=98}} Peter lacked the power or authority to punish the conspirators.

This is believed to the oldest surviving film recorded in Serbia.{{sfn|Norris|2008|p=110}} According to film historian Paul Smith, it is also likely the first [[newsreel]] in history.{{sfn|Smith|1976|p=101}}\n\n===Foreign affairs===\nDuring his reign the Kingdom of Serbia expanded to the south, including Sand\u017eak and Kosovo and Metohija. Serbia temporarily controlled northern parts of Albania, but had give away those parts to the newly created Albania. In November 1918, shortly before creating the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Serbia was joined by some new territories like Srem, Banat, Ba\u010dka and Montenegro and as such was later included in the new kingdom.\n\nThe most prominent prime minister during his reign was Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107. At the beginning of Peter's reign he opposed the new king, calling his ascension to the throne unlawful. However, he quickly changed his mind after seeing that the Serbian people accepted King Peter. As it turned out, the only conflict he had with Peter during his 18-year reign was the king's salary.\n\n====First Balkan War====\n\nThe war began in October 1912 and ended in May 1913. It  comprised actions of the [[Balkan League]] ([[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]]) against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The combined armies of the Balkan states overcame the numerically inferior and strategically disadvantaged Ottoman armies and achieved rapid success. As a result of the war, the allies captured and partitioned almost all remaining European territories of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn May 1912, the Albanian Hamidian revolutionaries, who wanted to reinstall Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II|Abdul Hamit II]] to power, drove the Young Turkish forces out of Skopje and pressed south towards Manastir (present day [[Bitola]]), forcing the Young Turks to grant effective autonomy over large regions in June 1912. Serbia, which had helped arm the Albanian Catholic and Hamidian rebels and sent secret agents to some of the prominent leaders, took the revolt as a pretext for war. Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, and Bulgaria had all been in talks about possible offensives against the Ottoman Empire before the Albanian revolt of 1912 broke out; a formal agreement between Serbia and Montenegro had been signed on 7 March.\n\nOn 18 October 1912, Peter I of Serbia issued a declaration, 'To the Serbian People', which appeared to support Albanians as well as Serbs:\n\n:\"The Turkish governments showed no interest in their duties towards their citizens and turned a deaf ear to all complaints and suggestions. Things got so far out of hand that no one was satisfied with the situation in Turkey in Europe. It became unbearable for the Serbs, the Greeks and for the Albanians, too. By the grace of God, I have therefore ordered my brave army to join in the Holy War to free our brethren and to ensure a better future. In Old Serbia, my army will meet not only upon Christian Serbs, but also upon Muslim Serbs, who are equally dear to us, and in addition to them, upon Christian and Muslim Albanians with whom our people have shared joy and sorrow for thirteen centuries now. To all of them we bring freedom, brotherhood and equality.\"\n\nIn a search for allies, Serbia was ready to negotiate a contract with Bulgaria.[15] The agreement provided that, in the event of victory against the Ottomans, Bulgaria would receive all of Macedonia south of the Kriva Palanka-Ohrid line. Serbia's expansion was accepted by Bulgaria as being to the north of the Shar Mountains (i.e., Kosovo). The intervening area was agreed to be \"disputed\"; it would be arbitrated by the Tsar of Russia in the event of a successful war against the Ottoman Empire.[16] During the course of the war, it became apparent that the Albanians did not consider Serbia as a liberator, as suggested by King Peter I, nor did the Serbian forces observe his declaration of amity toward Albanians.\n\nThe Serbian army was led by Peter I alongside marshals like [[Radomir Putnik]], [[Stepa Stepanovi\u0107]], [[Bo\u017eidar Jankovi\u0107]] and [[Petar Bojovi\u0107]]. Serbia sent 230,000 soldiers (out of the population of just 2,912,000 people) with about 228 guns, grouped in 10 infantry divisions.\n\n====Second Balkan War and aftermath====\n\nDissatisfied with its share of the spoils of the First Balkan War, Bulgaria attacked its former allies, Serbia and Greece, and started the [[Second Balkan War]] on 16 ([[Old Style|O.S.]])/29 June 1913. Serbian and Greek armies repulsed the Bulgarian offensive and counter-attacked, entering Bulgaria. With Bulgaria also having engaged in territorial disputes with [[Romania]], this war provoked Romanian intervention against Bulgaria. The [[Ottoman Empire]] took advantage of the situation to regain some lost territories from the previous war. When Romanian troops approached the capital Sofia, Bulgaria asked for an armistice, resulting in the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]], in which Bulgaria had to cede portions of its First Balkan War gains to Serbia, Greece and Romania. The Second Balkan War left Serbia as the most militarily powerful state south of the Danube. Years of military investment financed by French loans had borne fruit. Central [[Vardar]] and the eastern half of the [[Sanjak]] of [[Novi Pazar]] were acquired. Its territory grew in extent from 18,650 to 33,891 square miles and its population grew by more than one and a half million.\n\nBecause of his constant and heavy efforts in the Balkan Wars, Peter's health worsened. At the same time, The [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]] represented a core of military opposition to the civil assembly. Acting from within the government and the military, members of The Black Hand forced Peter to disband the government of Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107, even though the Radical Party held most of the seats in the National Assembly. Only just after Russian intervention and with the help of the French capital, the crisis was solved in Pa\u0161i\u0107's favor. King Peter had to withdraw, allegedly because of his failing health, and, on 24 June 1914, he passed his royal powers to his heir, [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]].\n\n[[File:Flag of Serbia-Royal standard McCandless.png|thumb|right|Royal Standard of the King of Serbia]]\n\n===Politics===\nThe [[Western Europe|Western]]-educated King attempted to liberalize Serbia with the goal of creating a Western-style [[constitutional monarchy]]. King Peter I became gradually very popular for his commitment to parliamentary democracy that, in spite of certain influence of military cliques in political life, functioned properly. The 1903 Constitution was a revised version of the 1888 Constitution, based on the Belgian Constitution of 1831, considered as one of the most liberal in Europe. The governments were chosen from the parliamentary majority, mostly from [[People's Radical Party]] led by Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 and [[Independent Radical Party]] led by Ljubomir Stojanovi\u0107. King Peter himself was in favor of a broader coalition government that would boost Serbian democracy and help pursue an independent course in foreign policy. In contrast to the Austrophile Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty, King Peter I was relying on Russia and France, which provoked rising hostility from expansionist-minded Austria-Hungary. King Peter I paid two solemn visits to Saint-Petersburg and Paris in 1910 and 1911 respectively, greeted as a hero of both democracy and national independence in the troublesome Balkans.\n\nThe reign of Peter I, from 1903 to 1914, is remembered as the \"Golden Age of Serbia\", due to the unrestricted political freedoms, free press, and cultural ascendancy among [[South Slavs]] who finally saw in democratic Serbia a Piedmont of South Slavs.{{sfn|Norris|2008|p=87}} King Peter I was supportive to the movement of Yugoslav unification, hosting in Belgrade various cultural gatherings. Grand School of Belgrade was upgraded into [[Belgrade University]] in 1905, with scholars of international renown such as [[Jovan Cviji\u0107]], [[Mihailo Petrovi\u0107]], [[Slobodan Jovanovi\u0107]], [[Jovan M. \u017dujovi\u0107]], [[Bogdan Popovi\u0107]], [[Jovan Skerli\u0107]], [[Sima Lozani\u0107]], [[Branislav Petronijevi\u0107]] and several others. King Peter I gained enormous popularity following the [[Balkan Wars]] in 1912 and 1913, which, from a [[Serbs|Serb]] and South Slav perspective, were a great success, heralded by the spectacular military victories over the Ottomans, followed by the liberation of \"[[Old Serbia]]\" ([[Kosovo Vilayet]]) and mostly Slavic-inhabited Macedonia ([[Manastir Vilayet]]). The territory of Serbia was doubled and her prestige among South Slavs (Croats and Slovenes in particular, and among the Serbs in Austria-Hungary, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Vojvodina, Military Frontier, Dalmatia, Slavonia, etc.) grew significantly, with Peter I as the main symbol of this both political and cultural success. After the conflict between military and civilian representatives in the spring of 1914, King Peter chose to \"retire\" due to ill health, reassigning on 11/24 June 1914 his royal prerogatives to his second son [[Heir apparent]] Crown Prince Alexander.\n \nThe King, spending most of his time in various Serbian spas, remained relatively inactive during the [[First World War]], although occasionally, when the military situation became critical, he visited trenches on the front-line to check up on morale of his troops. His visit to the firing line prior to the [[Battle of Kolubara]] in late 1914 boosted morale of the retreating Serbian forces and announced a counter-offensive and sparkling victory against numerically superior Austro-Hungarian forces. Another memorable visit in 1915 involved King Peter, by then 71, picking up a rifle and shooting at enemy soldiers. Following the invasion of Serbia by the joint forces of Germany, Austro-Hungary and Bulgaria in October 1915, King Peter I led the army and tens of thousands of civilian refugees through the high mountains of Albania to the Adriatic sea on a 'Calvary known to few peoples'.<ref>R. Wolfson \"Years of Change. European History 1890\u20131945\"</ref>\n\nAfter the dramatic retreat in harsh winter through hostile environment of Albanian highlands from Prizren to the Albanian littoral, that took more than 100,000 lives, the King and his army, exhausted by cold and famine, were eventually transported by the Allies, mostly French ships to the Greek isle of Corfu in early 1916. For the rest of World War I King Peter I, already of very poor health, remained on Corfu, which became the seat of the Serbian government in exile until December 1918.\n\nOn 1 December 1918, King Peter I was proclaimed King of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. King Peter stayed abroad until July 1919 and returned to Belgrade where he died in 1921 at the age of 77. He was solemnly buried in his endowment in Oplenac, the Church of Saint George in the vicinity of Topola in Central Serbia, where his grandfather Karageorge, the founder of the dynasty, launched a large-scale insurrection against the Ottomans in 1804.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Topola Grab Peter I.JPG|thumb|right|Tomb of King Peter I]]\n[[File:HPIM0503.jpg|thumb|right|Monument to Peter I of Serbia in [[Zrenjanin]]]]\nThree cities in interwar Yugoslavia were named after King Peter I: Mrkonji\u0107 grad in Bosnia-Herzegovina (former Varcar Vakuf), Petrovgrad in Vojvodina (Veliki Be\u010dkerek, now Zrenjanin) and Petrovac na Moru (former Ka\u0161tel Lastva) in Montenegro. Dozens of monuments erected in his honor throughout Yugoslavia were destroyed after the communist takeover in 1945. Only one monument, in Zrenjanin (former Petrovgrad) was recently restored, as well as several smaller monuments in Belgrade and the rest of Serbia. The other monuments in honor to King Peter I were restored or erected in Republika Srpska, in Bosnia-Herzegovina where his cult status as a national hero is as strong as it is in Serbia.\n\nIn [[Paris]], an avenue off the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] is named after him, [[Avenue Pierre 1er de Serbie]].<ref>[http://www.gralon.net/plan-ville/planr-av-pierre-1er-de-serbie-paris-3631.htm Avenue Pierre 1er de Serbie (see centre of map)]</ref> There is a modest monument dedicated to King Petar I of Serbia in Orl\u00e9ans, France, when he fought as a volunteer in the French army. A large monument to King Peter and his son Alexander I of Yugoslavia was also unveiled in 1936, at the Porte de la Muette in Paris. The film ''King Peter I'' was released in early December 2018 starring [[Lazar Ristovski]] as King Peter. <ref>{{Citation|title=Kralj Petar I: U slavu Srbije|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8161166/|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Serbian decorations and medals'''\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Noribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Order of St. Prince Lazar|Order of Saint Prince Lazarus]], Collar (Royal Order only)\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Order of the Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star rib.png|width=60}}\n|[[Order of Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star]], Grand Master\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=SRB Orden Belog Orla BAR.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Order of the White Eagle (Serbia)|Order of the White Eagle]], Grand Master\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Order of the White Eagle War Merit ribbon sm.png|width=60}}\n|[[Order of the White Eagle (Serbia)|Order of the White Eagle with swords]], Grand Master\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Order of the Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star with Swords rib.png|width=60}}\n|[[Order of Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star|Order of Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star with Swords]], Grand Master\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Ord.St.Sava-ribbon.jpg|width=60}}\n|[[Order of St. Sava|Order of Saint Sava]], Grand Master\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Serbian Service Medals'''\n|-\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Red Cross Medal of Merit rib.gif|width=60}}\n|Medal of the Serbian [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]]\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Military Merit medal 1883 rib.gif|width=60}}\n|Medal for Military Merit\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Conmemorative Medal of the Accesion of King Peter I.jpg|width=60}}\n| Commemorative Medal of the Election of Peter I as King of Serbia\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Commemorative Medal of the first Balkan war,1912.jpg|width=60}}\n| Commemorative Medal of the first Balkan War, 1912\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Commemorative Medal of the second Balkan War,1913 rib.png|width=60}}\n| Commemorative Medal of the second Balkan War, 1913\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Commemorative_Medal_of_the_Albanian_Campaign,1920_rib.png|width=60}}\n|[[Albanian Commemorative Medal|Commemorative Medal of the Albanian Campaign]]\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''International and Foreign Awards'''\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Order of Saint Peter of Cetinje.

June}}&nbsp;\u2013 16 August 1921) reigned as the last [[King of Serbia]] (1903\u20131918) and as the first [[King of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (1918\u20131921). Since he was the king of Serbia during a period of great Serbian military success, he was remembered by [[Serbs|Serbian]] [[people]] as '''King Peter the Liberator''', and also known as '''Old King'''.\n\nPeter was [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e]]'s grandson and third son of [[Persida Nenadovi\u0107]] and Prince [[Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, Prince of Serbia|Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]], who was forced to abdicate. Peter lived with his family in exile. He fought with the [[France|French]] Foreign Legion in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. He joined as volunteer under the alias Peter Mrkonji\u0107 in the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875\u201377)]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nHe married [[Princess Zorka of Montenegro]], daughter of [[Nicholas of Montenegro|King Nicholas]], in 1883. She gave birth to his five children, including Prince [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]]. After the death of his father in 1885, Peter became head of the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]]. After [[May Coup (Serbia)|a military coup d'\u00e9tat]] and the murder of King [[Aleksandar Obrenovi\u0107|Alexander I Obrenovi\u0107]] in 1903, Peter became King of Serbia. As king, he advocated a constitutional setup for the country and was famous for his libertarian politics.\n\nKing Peter was the supreme commander of the Serbian army in the [[Balkan wars]]. Because of his age, on 24 June 1914, he proclaimed his son, [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]], heir-apparent to the throne, as regent. In the [[First World War]] he and his army [[Serbian army's retreat through Albania|retreated across]] the [[Principality of Albania]].\n\n==Early life==\nPeter was born in [[Belgrade]] on {{OldStyleDate|11 July|1844|29 June}}, the fifth of Prince [[Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, Prince of Serbia|Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]] and his consort [[Persida Nenadovi\u0107]]'s ten children.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=95}} He was the grandson of [[Kara\u0111or\u0111e]], the leader of the [[First Serbian Uprising]] (1804\u20131813) and the founder of the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]].{{sfn|Judah|2000|p=83}} Peter was not born in the Royal Court, which was undergoing renovations at the time, but at the home of merchant [[Mi\u0161a Anastasijevi\u0107]]. His birth was not met with much celebration because he was his parents' third son and his older brother Svetozar was the heir to the throne.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=95}} His parents' oldest son, Aleksa, had died three years prior to Peter's birth, aged five, at which point Svetozar became heir. Peter did not become heir until Svetozar's death in 1847 at the age of six.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|loc=p. 95, note 2}} Besides Belgrade, Peter spent much of his childhood in the town of [[Topola]], from where the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty originated. He received his elementary education in Belgrade.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=95}}\n\n==Exile==\n\n===Post-secondary education and Franco-Prussian War===\n[[File:Petar Karadjordjevic 1865.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Peter, {{circa|1865}}]]\nIn 1858, just as the fourteen-year-old Peter was preparing to depart for [[Geneva]] to attend high school, his father was forced to abdicate the throne. The Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty's rivals, the [[Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty]], were reinstated, and an Obrenovi\u0107 prince, [[Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107|Mihailo]], claimed the throne.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=96}} The two dynasties had been vying for power since 1817, when Kara\u0111or\u0111e was assassinated on the orders of [[Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107]],   the founder of the Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty.{{sfn|Judah|2000|pp=53, 56}}\n\nPeter left Geneva for Paris in 1861 and enrolled in the [[Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Barbe]], located in the heart of the city's [[Latin Quarter, Paris|Latin Quarter]]. The following year, Peter enrolled in the ''[[\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]]'', France's most prestigious military academy. He graduated from the academy in 1864, and continued living in Paris for some time thereafter. During this period, he pursued interests such as photography and painting, and read works of political philosophy, learning about [[liberalism]], [[parliamentarism]] and [[democracy]]. In 1866, he entered the Higher Military School in [[Metz]], which he attended until the following year.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=96}} Two years later, his [[Serbian language|Serbian]]-language translation of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[On Liberty]]'' was published.{{sfn|Shrader|2014|p=1244}}\n\nAt the outbreak of the 1870\u201371 [[Franco-Prussian War]], Peter joined the [[French Foreign Legion]] under the pseudonym Petar Kara, together with relative Nikola Nikolajevi\u0107.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=96}} During his service, Peter held the rank of either [[lieutenant]]{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=96}} or [[second lieutenant]],{{sfn|Lepage|2008|p=57}} depending on the source, and fought with the [[1st Foreign Regiment]].{{sfn|Lepage|2008|p=57}} He participated in the [[Second Battle of Orl\u00e9ans (1870)|Second Battle of Orl\u00e9ans]] on 3\u20134 December 1870, as well as the [[Battle of Villersexel]] on 9 January 1871. He was awarded the [[Legion of Honour]] for his conduct during the two battles, but was captured by the Prussians shortly thereafter. He managed to escape captivity and returned to the front. Peter was involved in the [[Paris Commune]] in the spring of 1871, together with close friend and relative Vladimir Ljoti\u0107, though the exact nature of his involvement remains unknown.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=96}}\n\n===Guerrilla activities===\n[[File:Petar Karadjordjevic 1875.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Peter in guerrilla uniform, {{circa|1875}}]]\nWith the outbreak of the [[Great Eastern Crisis]] of 1875\u201378, which erupted after [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serb]] rebels in [[Nevesinje]] [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875\u201377)|staged a revolt]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]], Peter returned to the [[Balkans]] and fought the Ottomans in northwestern [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]. He adopted the ''[[nom de guerre]]'' of Petar Mrkonji\u0107, and upon reaching the regions of [[Banovina (region)|Banija]] and [[Kordun]] in [[Austria-Hungary]], took control of guerrilla unit of about 200 men.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=96}} He arrived [[Dubica, Bosnia-Herzegovina|Bosanska Dubica]] in August 1875, but received a cold welcome. He discovered that Prince [[Milan I of Serbia|Milan]] of Serbia was plotting to assassinate him fearing that Peter would attempt to wrest back the throne from the Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty. This revelation, combined with a string of battlefield defeats, compelled Peter and his followers to leave Bosnia and withdraw to Austria-Hungary. They were subsequently detained by the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] in the village of [[Bojna, Croatia|Bojna]], near [[Glina, Croatia|Glina]]. Peter escaped, returned to Bosnia and organized another band of rebels. Once again, his involvement in the fighting aroused suspicion in Belgrade, and by May 1876, his presence proved divisive. The rebels split into three separate camps: one that supported Peter, another that supported Milan and a third that advocated Austro-Hungarian arbitration. Not wishing to cause further divisions among the rebels, Peter agreed to leave Bosnia. Prior to his departure, he wrote a letter to Milan explaining why he was leaving the battlefield and offering to make peace with the Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=97}}\n\nDespite his attempts to make peace with Milan, accusations of treason continued to be levelled against Peter. He decided to travel to [[Kragujevac]], the seat of the Royal Serbian Government, and address the [[National Assembly of Serbia|National Assembly]] in an attempt to clear his name. In 1877, an anti-government uprising erupted in the [[Toplica District|Toplica]] region of southern Serbia, for which Milan blamed Peter and Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 sympathizers. Peter was accused of treachery and collaboration with the Ottomans. In the summer of 1878, he illegally crossed the border between Serbia and Austria-Hungary at [[Golubac]] via the [[Danube]]. Peter and his guide became lost in the [[Homolje mountains]] and were forced to hide from the authorities in the wilderness. Peter returned to Austria-Hungary shortly thereafter, but was arrested by the Austro-Hungarian police and interned at the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 family home in [[Bocsig|Bokszeg]]. In 1878, he was allowed to leave Bokszeg. He first went to [[Budapest]] and then to Paris. During this period, he was closely monitored by Austro-Hungarian spies, who took note of all his movements.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=97}} In January 1879, court proceedings were initiated against Peter and his closest companions in [[Smederevo]]. The plaintiff, Prince Milan, alleged that Peter and his followers had attempted to overthrow the Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty and place a Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 on the throne. Peter and his companions were charged with high treason, for which the mandatory penalty was death. As he was living in Paris at the time of the proceedings, Peter was convicted ''[[in absentia]]'' and sentenced to death by [[hanging]].{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=98}}\n\n===Move to Cetinje===\n[[File:Petar arsen zorka.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Peter ''(far left, standing)'' with his family]]\nIn 1883, Peter moved to [[Cetinje]], the capital of the second independent [[Serbs|Serb]] state, [[Principality of Montenegro|Montenegro]], with the intention of marrying the eldest daughter of Montenegro's ruler, Prince [[Nicholas of Montenegro|Nicholas]]. Peter and [[Princess Zorka of Montenegro|Ljubica Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]] were married in Cetinje in the summer of 1883. The marriage upset the region's volatile geopolitical balance, causing great unease in the Austro-Hungarian, Russian and Serbian capitals. Belgrade perceived it as a sign of increasing closeness between the [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]] and Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasties. Relations between the two Serb states worsened, as did relations between Austria-Hungary and Russia, which had been vying for power in the Balkans for decades.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=98}}\n\nWhen his father died in the spring of 1885, Peter became the head of the House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 and took the title of prince. Serbia, previously a [[principality]], was declared a [[Realm|kingdom]] in 1882, and henceforth, the Serbian monarch used the title [[King of Serbia]]. Ljubica died during childbirth in March 1890. The couple had five children, three of whom reached adulthood: [[Princess Helen of Serbia|Helen]] (Jelena), Milena, [[George, Crown Prince of Serbia|George]] (\u0110or\u0111e), [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander]] (Aleksandar), and Andrew (Andrej). Milena died in infancy and Andrew died along with his mother during childbirth.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=98}}\n\nFollowing his father's death, Peter's financial situation deteriorated and he became dependent on his father-in-law, as well as [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and his brother George, for support. Following the [[Royal Serbian Army]]'s rout in the [[Serbo-Bulgarian War]] of 1885, Peter and Nicholas devised a plan to invade Serbia and overthrow the Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty. At the last minute, Nicholas abandoned the idea. Peter felt betrayed by the Prince's decision to back out, leading to long lasting animosity. Nevertheless, he remained in Cetinje until 1894, devoting himself to his surviving children, who finished their primary education there.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=98}} In 1894, Peter moved to Geneva with his three children, where he was to remain until 1903.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=99}} In 1899, Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] invited Prince George and Prince Alexander, as well as Peter's nephew [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Paul]], to attend the ''[[Page Corps|Corps des Pages]]'' [[military academy]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] free of charge. Due to his poor financial standing, which prevented him from sending the boys to private schools in Switzerland, Peter accepted the Tsar's offer.{{sfn|Dedijer|1966|pp=381\u2013382}}\n\n===May Overthrow===\n{{main article|May Coup (Serbia)}}\nIn July 1900, King [[Alexander I of Serbia|Alexander]], Milan's 23-year-old son, married [[Draga Ma\u0161in]], a widowed [[lady-in-waiting]] twelve years his senior with a reputation for [[promiscuity]]. Ma\u0161in was also believed to be infertile, raising questions as to the viability of the Obrenovi\u0107 line. The marriage sparked outrage among the officer corps and led to a plot to remove Alexander from the throne. The officers, led by [[Dragutin Dimitrijevi\u0107]] (\"Apis\"), initially sought to expel Alexander and Draga but realized that doing so would precipitate a conflict between the pro-Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 and pro-Obrenovi\u0107 camps within the country. By the autumn of 1901, the conspirators resolved to kill the King and Queen, thereby averting a possible civil war. Some officers proposed placing an English or German prince on the throne. Another suggested Prince [[Prince Mirko of Montenegro|Mirko]], the second son of Nicholas of Montenegro, and others advocated forming a [[republic]].{{sfn|Mackenzie|1989|pp=31\u201334}} Political conditions in Europe were such that the proclamation of a republic would only have increased the ire of the [[Great Powers]] towards Serbia in case Alexander was overthrown, giving Austria-Hungary a pretext to invade.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1989|p=48}}\n\nPreparations for the coup took place between 1901 and 1903. The conspirators decided to place Peter on the throne in November 1901, but Peter had little trust in them and their initial offers were rebuffed. He accepted their offers on the condition that officers he trusted would take part in the plot and insisted that he would not take any part himself. He also told the officers that he would agree to take the throne only if his ascent was approved by the National Assembly. At the time of the coup, Peter was vacationing with his children and planning visits to Russia and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], suggesting that he was not aware of what was to occur.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=99}} The officers [[May Coup (Serbia)|raided the royal palace]] late in the evening of {{OldStyleDate|10 June|1903|29 May}} and shot the King and Queen, mutilating their corpses with sabres and tossing them from a third-floor balcony.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1989|pp=46\u201347}} The murders resulted in the extinction of the Obrenovi\u0107 line and resolved the century-long feud between the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 and Obrenovi\u0107 dynasties.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1989|p=48}} Peter expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the plot, as well as regret for the bloodshed that had occurred, describing it as \"neither gentlemanly, nor worthy of the 20th century\". On {{OldStyleDate|15 June|1903|2 June}}, by decision of the National Assembly, Peter was summoned to assume the Serbian throne.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=99}} He arrived in Belgrade on {{OldStyleDate|26 June|1903|13 June}}.{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=100}}\n\nPeter's ascent to the throne was met with great enthusiasm by South Slav nationalists, who believed he would succeed in uniting the South Slavs living in Serbia, Montenegro, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire. In Vienna, en route to Belgrade, he was welcomed by a crowd of euphoric Serb and [[Croats|Croat]] students, who hailed him as \"the first Yugoslav king\".{{sfn|Bjelajac|1997|p=100}}\n\n==Reign==\n\n===Coronation===\n[[File:King Peter I after coronation, 21 September 1904.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Peter emerging from [[St. Michael's Cathedral (Belgrade)|St. Michael's Cathedral]] on horseback following his coronation]]\n\nThe royal couple's murder upset and shocked most of Europe, but was met enthusiastically at home.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|p=79}} Russia immediately recognized the National Assembly's decision declaring Peter the next King of Serbia and expressed satisfaction that the inter-dynastic intrigues which had plagued the country since the early 19th century had been brought to an end. Austria-Hungary declared its neutrality on the matter, but privately, policymakers in [[Vienna]] expressed hope that Peter's accession would have a placating effect. The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] demanded that the chief conspirators be severely punished, and when the Royal Serbian Government neglected to carry out this request, the British severed all diplomatic ties.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1989|pp=50\u201351}} Several other European nations followed in the United Kingdom's footsteps and severed ties as well.{{sfn|Singleton|1985|p=98}} Peter lacked the power or authority to punish the conspirators. He also felt a deep sense of obligation towards them, acknowledging that he would not have been able to assume the throne were it not for their actions.{{sfn|Mackenzie|1989|pp=50\u201351}}\n\n[[File:KrunaKaradjordjevica.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Regalia of Serbia|Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 Crown]]]] Peter was crowned in [[St. Michael's Cathedral (Belgrade)|St. Michael's Cathedral]] in [[Belgrade]], on {{OldStyleDate|21 September|1904|8 September}}.{{sfn|Batakovi\u0107|2002|pp=351\u2013352}} The coronation ceremony, the first in Serbia's modern history, was intended to demonstrate that a new era had begun.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|p=79}} The year-long interval between Peter's return to Serbia and his coronation was done deliberately, so that the ceremony would coincide with the 100th anniversary of the First Serbian Uprising and to give European statesmen time to come to terms with the palace coup.{{sfn|Pavlowitch|2002|p=79}} Nevertheless, only representatives of Montenegro and [[Principality of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] were in attendance.{{sfn|Batakovi\u0107|2002|pp=351\u2013352}} New [[regalia of Serbia|regalia]], consisting of a [[crown (headgear)|crown]], [[sceptre]], [[globus cruciger|orb]] and royal [[mantle (royal garment)|mantle]], was commissioned specially for the occasion and made by the Parisian jewelers ''Falize Fr\u00e8res''.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=The Royal Family of Serbia|title=The Regalia|url=http://www.royalfamily.org/the-regalia/|accessdate=18 November 2016|date=2013-12-21}}</ref> King Peter's procession and a parade following the coronation were filmed by [[Arnold Muir Wilson]], the honorary Serbian consul in [[Sheffield]], and his cameraman, [[Frank Mottershaw]].

Serbia temporarily controlled northern parts of Albania, but had give away those parts to the newly created Albania. In November 1918, shortly before creating the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Serbia was joined by some new territories like Srem, Banat, Ba\u010dka and Montenegro and as such was later included in the new kingdom.\n\nThe most prominent prime minister during his reign was Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107. At the beginning of Peter's reign he opposed the new king, calling his ascension to the throne unlawful. However, he quickly changed his mind after seeing that the Serbian people accepted King Peter. As it turned out, the only conflict he had with Peter during his 18-year reign was the king's salary.\n\n====First Balkan War====\n\nThe war began in October 1912 and ended in May 1913. It  comprised actions of the [[Balkan League]] ([[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]]) against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The combined armies of the Balkan states overcame the numerically inferior and strategically disadvantaged Ottoman armies and achieved rapid success. As a result of the war, the allies captured and partitioned almost all remaining European territories of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn May 1912, the Albanian Hamidian revolutionaries, who wanted to reinstall Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II|Abdul Hamit II]] to power, drove the Young Turkish forces out of Skopje and pressed south towards Manastir (present day [[Bitola]]), forcing the Young Turks to grant effective autonomy over large regions in June 1912. Serbia, which had helped arm the Albanian Catholic and Hamidian rebels and sent secret agents to some of the prominent leaders, took the revolt as a pretext for war. Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, and Bulgaria had all been in talks about possible offensives against the Ottoman Empire before the Albanian revolt of 1912 broke out; a formal agreement between Serbia and Montenegro had been signed on 7 March.\n\nOn 18 October 1912, Peter I of Serbia issued a declaration, 'To the Serbian People', which appeared to support Albanians as well as Serbs:\n\n:\"The Turkish governments showed no interest in their duties towards their citizens and turned a deaf ear to all complaints and suggestions. Things got so far out of hand that no one was satisfied with the situation in Turkey in Europe. It became unbearable for the Serbs, the Greeks and for the Albanians, too. By the grace of God, I have therefore ordered my brave army to join in the Holy War to free our brethren and to ensure a better future. In Old Serbia, my army will meet not only upon Christian Serbs, but also upon Muslim Serbs, who are equally dear to us, and in addition to them, upon Christian and Muslim Albanians with whom our people have shared joy and sorrow for thirteen centuries now. To all of them we bring freedom, brotherhood and equality.\"\n\nIn a search for allies, Serbia was ready to negotiate a contract with Bulgaria.[15] The agreement provided that, in the event of victory against the Ottomans, Bulgaria would receive all of Macedonia south of the Kriva Palanka-Ohrid line. Serbia's expansion was accepted by Bulgaria as being to the north of the Shar Mountains (i.e., Kosovo). The intervening area was agreed to be \"disputed\"; it would be arbitrated by the Tsar of Russia in the event of a successful war against the Ottoman Empire.[16] During the course of the war, it became apparent that the Albanians did not consider Serbia as a liberator, as suggested by King Peter I, nor did the Serbian forces observe his declaration of amity toward Albanians.\n\nThe Serbian army was led by Peter I alongside marshals like [[Radomir Putnik]], [[Stepa Stepanovi\u0107]], [[Bo\u017eidar Jankovi\u0107]] and [[Petar Bojovi\u0107]]. Serbia sent 230,000 soldiers (out of the population of just 2,912,000 people) with about 228 guns, grouped in 10 infantry divisions.\n\n====Second Balkan War and aftermath====\n\nDissatisfied with its share of the spoils of the First Balkan War, Bulgaria attacked its former allies, Serbia and Greece, and started the [[Second Balkan War]] on 16 ([[Old Style|O.S.]])/29 June 1913. Serbian and Greek armies repulsed the Bulgarian offensive and counter-attacked, entering Bulgaria. With Bulgaria also having engaged in territorial disputes with [[Romania]], this war provoked Romanian intervention against Bulgaria. The [[Ottoman Empire]] took advantage of the situation to regain some lost territories from the previous war. When Romanian troops approached the capital Sofia, Bulgaria asked for an armistice, resulting in the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]], in which Bulgaria had to cede portions of its First Balkan War gains to Serbia, Greece and Romania. The Second Balkan War left Serbia as the most militarily powerful state south of the Danube. Years of military investment financed by French loans had borne fruit. Central [[Vardar]] and the eastern half of the [[Sanjak]] of [[Novi Pazar]] were acquired. Its territory grew in extent from 18,650 to 33,891 square miles and its population grew by more than one and a half million.\n\nBecause of his constant and heavy efforts in the Balkan Wars, Peter's health worsened. At the same time, The [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]] represented a core of military opposition to the civil assembly. Acting from within the government and the military, members of The Black Hand forced Peter to disband the government of Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107, even though the Radical Party held most of the seats in the National Assembly. Only just after Russian intervention and with the help of the French capital, the crisis was solved in Pa\u0161i\u0107's favor. King Peter had to withdraw, allegedly because of his failing health, and, on 24 June 1914, he passed his royal powers to his heir, [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107]].\n\n[[File:Flag of Serbia-Royal standard McCandless.png|thumb|right|Royal Standard of the King of Serbia]]\n\n===Politics===\nThe [[Western Europe|Western]]-educated King attempted to liberalize Serbia with the goal of creating a Western-style [[constitutional monarchy]]. King Peter I became gradually very popular for his commitment to parliamentary democracy that, in spite of certain influence of military cliques in political life, functioned properly. The 1903 Constitution was a revised version of the 1888 Constitution, based on the Belgian Constitution of 1831, considered as one of the most liberal in Europe. The governments were chosen from the parliamentary majority, mostly from [[People's Radical Party]] led by Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 and [[Independent Radical Party]] led by Ljubomir Stojanovi\u0107. King Peter himself was in favor of a broader coalition government that would boost Serbian democracy and help pursue an independent course in foreign policy. In contrast to the Austrophile Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty, King Peter I was relying on Russia and France, which provoked rising hostility from expansionist-minded Austria-Hungary. King Peter I paid two solemn visits to Saint-Petersburg and Paris in 1910 and 1911 respectively, greeted as a hero of both democracy and national independence in the troublesome Balkans.\n\nThe reign of Peter I, from 1903 to 1914, is remembered as the \"Golden Age of Serbia\", due to the unrestricted political freedoms, free press, and cultural ascendancy among [[South Slavs]] who finally saw in democratic Serbia a Piedmont of South Slavs.{{sfn|Norris|2008|p=87}} King Peter I was supportive to the movement of Yugoslav unification, hosting in Belgrade various cultural gatherings. Grand School of Belgrade was upgraded into [[Belgrade University]] in 1905, with scholars of international renown such as [[Jovan Cviji\u0107]], [[Mihailo Petrovi\u0107]], [[Slobodan Jovanovi\u0107]], [[Jovan M. \u017dujovi\u0107]], [[Bogdan Popovi\u0107]], [[Jovan Skerli\u0107]], [[Sima Lozani\u0107]], [[Branislav Petronijevi\u0107]] and several others. King Peter I gained enormous popularity following the [[Balkan Wars]] in 1912 and 1913, which, from a [[Serbs|Serb]] and South Slav perspective, were a great success, heralded by the spectacular military victories over the Ottomans, followed by the liberation of \"[[Old Serbia]]\" ([[Kosovo Vilayet]]) and mostly Slavic-inhabited Macedonia ([[Manastir Vilayet]]). The territory of Serbia was doubled and her prestige among South Slavs (Croats and Slovenes in particular, and among the Serbs in Austria-Hungary, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Vojvodina, Military Frontier, Dalmatia, Slavonia, etc.) grew significantly, with Peter I as the main symbol of this both political and cultural success. After the conflict between military and civilian representatives in the spring of 1914, King Peter chose to \"retire\" due to ill health, reassigning on 11/24 June 1914 his royal prerogatives to his second son [[Heir apparent]] Crown Prince Alexander.\n \nThe King, spending most of his time in various Serbian spas, remained relatively inactive during the [[First World War]], although occasionally, when the military situation became critical, he visited trenches on the front-line to check up on morale of his troops. His visit to the firing line prior to the [[Battle of Kolubara]] in late 1914 boosted morale of the retreating Serbian forces and announced a counter-offensive and sparkling victory against numerically superior Austro-Hungarian forces. Another memorable visit in 1915 involved King Peter, by then 71, picking up a rifle and shooting at enemy soldiers. Following the invasion of Serbia by the joint forces of Germany, Austro-Hungary and Bulgaria in October 1915, King Peter I led the army and tens of thousands of civilian refugees through the high mountains of Albania to the Adriatic sea on a 'Calvary known to few peoples'.<ref>R. Wolfson \"Years of Change. European History 1890\u20131945\"</ref>\n\nAfter the dramatic retreat in harsh winter through hostile environment of Albanian highlands from Prizren to the Albanian littoral, that took more than 100,000 lives, the King and his army, exhausted by cold and famine, were eventually transported by the Allies, mostly French ships to the Greek isle of Corfu in early 1916. For the rest of World War I King Peter I, already of very poor health, remained on Corfu, which became the seat of the Serbian government in exile until December 1918.\n\nOn 1 December 1918, King Peter I was proclaimed King of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. King Peter stayed abroad until July 1919 and returned to Belgrade where he died in 1921 at the age of 77. He was solemnly buried in his endowment in Oplenac, the Church of Saint George in the vicinity of Topola in Central Serbia, where his grandfather Karageorge, the founder of the dynasty, launched a large-scale insurrection against the Ottomans in 1804.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Topola Grab Peter I.JPG|thumb|right|Tomb of King Peter I]]\n[[File:HPIM0503.jpg|thumb|right|Monument to Peter I of Serbia in [[Zrenjanin]]]]\nThree cities in interwar Yugoslavia were named after King Peter I: Mrkonji\u0107 grad in Bosnia-Herzegovina (former Varcar Vakuf), Petrovgrad in Vojvodina (Veliki Be\u010dkerek, now Zrenjanin) and Petrovac na Moru (former Ka\u0161tel Lastva) in Montenegro. Dozens of monuments erected in his honor throughout Yugoslavia were destroyed after the communist takeover in 1945. Only one monument, in Zrenjanin (former Petrovgrad) was recently restored, as well as several smaller monuments in Belgrade and the rest of Serbia. The other monuments in honor to King Peter I were restored or erected in Republika Srpska, in Bosnia-Herzegovina where his cult status as a national hero is as strong as it is in Serbia.\n\nIn [[Paris]], an avenue off the [[Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] is named after him, [[Avenue Pierre 1er de Serbie]].<ref>[http://www.gralon.net/plan-ville/planr-av-pierre-1er-de-serbie-paris-3631.htm Avenue Pierre 1er de Serbie (see centre of map)]</ref> There is a modest monument dedicated to King Petar I of Serbia in Orl\u00e9ans, France, when he fought as a volunteer in the French army. A large monument to King Peter and his son Alexander I of Yugoslavia was also unveiled in 1936, at the Porte de la Muette in Paris. The film ''King Peter I'' was released in early December 2018 starring [[Lazar Ristovski]] as King Peter. <ref>{{Citation|title=Kralj Petar I: U slavu Srbije|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8161166/|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Serbian decorations and medals'''\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Noribbon.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Order of St. Prince Lazar|Order of Saint Prince Lazarus]], Collar (Royal Order only)\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Order of the Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star rib.png|width=60}}\n|[[Order of Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star]], Grand Master\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=SRB Orden Belog Orla BAR.svg|width=60}}\n|[[Order of the White Eagle (Serbia)|Order of the White Eagle]], Grand Master\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Order of the White Eagle War Merit ribbon sm.png|width=60}}\n|[[Order of the White Eagle (Serbia)|Order of the White Eagle with swords]], Grand Master\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Order of the Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star with Swords rib.png|width=60}}\n|[[Order of Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star|Order of Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star with Swords]], Grand Master\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Ord.St.Sava-ribbon.jpg|width=60}}\n|[[Order of St. Sava|Order of Saint Sava]], Grand Master\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''Serbian Service Medals'''\n|-\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Red Cross Medal of Merit rib.gif|width=60}}\n|Medal of the Serbian [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]]\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Military Merit medal 1883 rib.gif|width=60}}\n|Medal for Military Merit\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Conmemorative Medal of the Accesion of King Peter I.jpg|width=60}}\n| Commemorative Medal of the Election of Peter I as King of Serbia\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Commemorative Medal of the first Balkan war,1912.jpg|width=60}}\n| Commemorative Medal of the first Balkan War, 1912\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Commemorative Medal of the second Balkan War,1913 rib.png|width=60}}\n| Commemorative Medal of the second Balkan War, 1913\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Commemorative_Medal_of_the_Albanian_Campaign,1920_rib.png|width=60}}\n|[[Albanian Commemorative Medal|Commemorative Medal of the Albanian Campaign]]\n|-  style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=2 |'''International and Foreign Awards'''\n|-\n|{{ribbon devices|ribbon=Order of Saint Peter of Cetinje.

The quickdraws are either placed by the lead climber during the ascent or are placed beforehand. \n\n=== Fall distance and impact ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2019}}\nDistances between pieces of protection can range from three to forty feet or more, although most often the distance is between six and twelve feet.\n\nAt any point, protection will be placed so that the distance to the most recently placed protection will be at most, half of the length of a possible fall. For example, if a leader is ten feet above the last piece of protection, any fall should be a maximum of twenty feet. Realistically, the fall would likely include several more feet due to rope elasticity and slack and give in the overall mechanical system.<ref>{{cite-web | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190505230457/https://www.outsideonline.com/2062326/beginners-guide-rock-climbing | url=https://www.outsideonline.com/2062326/beginners-guide-rock-climbing | archive-date=May 5, 2019| title=The Noob's Guide to Rock Climbing | publisher=Outside Online}}</ref> If a lead climber, starting from the ground, approaches twice the height of the last piece of protection, there is danger of a ''ground fall'' (more commonly referred to as \"decking\") in which the falling climber hits the ground before the rope goes tight.\n\nThe severity of a fall arrested by the climbing rope is measured by the ''[[fall factor]]'': the ratio of the height a climber falls before their rope begins to stretch and the rope length available to absorb the energy of the fall. (A leader may reduce their fall factor by using \"protection\", equipment that attaches in some way to the rock, allowing the rope to pass through it.)  As the rope begins to stretch, it absorbs the energy of the fall and slows the falling climber. The more the rope is stretched by the force of the faller, the more intense the force it exerts on the faller, and the more severe any effect of that force. For this reason, a fall of 20 feet is much more severe (exerts more force on the climber and climbing equipment) if it occurs with 10 feet of rope out (i.e. the climber has placed no protection and falls from 10 feet above the belayer to 10 feet below\u2014a factor 2 fall) than if it occurs 100 feet above the belayer (a fall factor of 0.2), in which case the stretch of the rope more effectively cushions the fall.\n\n=== Risks ===\nSeveral poor practices during lead climbing can lead to severe risk.\n\n* Back-clipping can result in protection getting unclipped by the rope during a fall. It often occurs when the climber does not grip the rope correctly during clipping. A carabiner is back-clipped when the rope coming from the climber goes through the back of the carabiner before coming out of the front of the carabiner and then down to the belayer. To avoid back-clipping the climber should always make sure that the rope coming from their harness goes through the front of the carabiner towards the face of the wall and then down to the belayer.<ref>{{cite-web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190707085232/https://www.sierra.com/blog/climbing/trailtime-tips-back-clipping-vs-proper-clipping-technique/| url=https://www.sierra.com/blog/climbing/trailtime-tips-back-clipping-vs-proper-clipping-technique/ | archive-date=Jul 7, 2019 | title=Back Clipping vs. Proper Clipping Technique| publisher=Sierra}}</ref><ref name=\"climbing-lead-skills\">{{cite-web | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181018060955/https://www.vdiffclimbing.com/sport-lead/ | url=https://www.vdiffclimbing.com/sport-lead/ | archive-date=Oct 18, 2018 | title=Sport Climbing \u2013 Lead Skills}}</ref><ref name=\"gripped-climbing-mistakes\">{{cite-web | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190707085651/https://gripped.com/profiles/three-common-lead-climbing-mistakes-to-avoid/ | url=https://gripped.com/profiles/three-common-lead-climbing-mistakes-to-avoid/ | archive-date=Jul 7, 2019 | title=Three Common Lead Climbing Mistakes to avoid | publisher=Gripped magazine}}</ref>\n* Z-clipping occurs when the climber grabs the rope behind an already clipped quickdraw and clips it into the next quickdraw. This results in a zig-zag shape of the rope on the wall, which can create immense friction, making further ascending hard to impossible until it is fixed. It also gives the illusion of being clipped into a higher protection, even though the climber would actually fall to a lower protection before being caught by the rope. To avoid Z-clipping always grab the rope right below the tie-in knot before pulling it upwards towards the next quickdraw. <ref name=\"climbing-lead-skills\" /><ref name=\"gripped-climbing-mistakes\" />\n* Turtling can occur when one of the climber's limbs is behind the rope and the climber falls off the wall. The climber is flipped upside down, like a turtle on its back. Sometimes this can eject the climber from the harness.<ref name=\"climbing-lead-skills\" /><ref name=\"gripped-climbing-mistakes\" />\n\nIn traditional climbing, failure to place removable protection adequately may also result in lost protection.<ref>{{cite-web| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190707090003/https://rockandice.com/how-to-climb/how-to-place-protection/ | url=https://rockandice.com/how-to-climb/how-to-place-protection/ | title=How to Place Protection | publisher=Rock and Ice | archive-date=Jul 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Multi-pitch climbing ==\n\nLong routes, for instance in [[big wall climbing]], are usually climbed in [[Multi-pitch climbing|multiple pitches]]. One climber takes the lead and the other climbers wait at a spot where they can anchor themselves securely and are not in risk of falling. The lead climber is belayed until the end of the rope is reached or a convenient place for a new anchor is found. Here the lead climber secures themself to a new anchor and waits while the other climbers follow. Often the lead climber gives belay to the followers at this point. When the other climbers reach the new anchor the process is repeated. Usually another climber takes the lead for the new pitch and the previous leader can rest.<ref>{{cite-web | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704153626/https://www.99boulders.com/multi-pitch-climbing | url=https://www.99boulders.com/multi-pitch-climbing | archive-date=Jul 4, 2019 | title=Multi-pitch Climbing 101: The Complete Guide | publisher=99boulders.com}}</ref>\n\nIn mountaineering it is also common that the other climbers do not wait for the lead climber to reach the end of a pitch. They already start climbing beforehand. This practice increases the risk of the entire rope party falling to their deaths or serious injury should the protections placed between the lead climber and the followers fail. On the other hand it shortens the length of time necessary for completing a section, which in turn lowers the risk of getting caught in an avalanche, bad weather or getting hit by falling ice or rock. This practice is known as simul-climbing.<ref>{{cite-web | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190429223753/https://www.climbing.com/skills/advanced-techniques-simul-climbing-and-short-fixing/ | url=https://www.climbing.com/skills/advanced-techniques-simul-climbing-and-short-fixing/ | title=Advanced Techniques: Simul-Climbing and Short-Fixing | publisher=climbing.com | archive-date=Apr 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite-book | title=Washington Ice: A Climbing Guide | author=Jason D.

Club & Merchandising crest.]]\n\nAlthough Portsmouth F.C. were formed in 1898, the club did not have a club crest until one was introduced for the 1913\u201314 season. This would be the second season since Portsmouth's 1912 reformation, and their wearing of blue shirts for a second successive season. Their first season with a crest in 1913\u201314 would also become the last season before World War I began in 1914.\n\nThe official Coat of Arms of the [[Portsmouth|City of Portsmouth]] contains an eight pointed gold star and crescent moon on a blue shield, Portsmouth's adoption of the [[star and crescent]] is said to have come from when [[King Richard I]] (1157\u20131189), who granted the city \"a crescent of gold on a shade of azure, with a blazing star of eight points\" which he had taken from the [[Byzantine Emperor]]'s standard of Governor [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Komnenos]], after capturing [[Cyprus]].\n\nThe first 1913 Portsmouth F.C. crest was based on official symbols belonging to the town council of Portsmouth, which featured a golden eight-pointed star and a golden crescent moon.  The football club's first crest featured a horizontally elongated white crescent moon beneath a white five pointed star, with both symbols positioned in the centre of a blue four pointed shield. Portsmouth town council bestowed the privileged use (but not ownership) of their moon and star motifs to Portsmouth F.C., albeit with some colour and design changes.<ref name=\"historicalkits.co.uk\"/>\n\nThroughout their history Portsmouth F.C. have tried different variations of the crest before reverting to the basic gold star and crescent. After World War II, Portsmouth began using an eight-pointed star to match that used by the city of Portsmouth.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In the 1950s and 1960s, the traditional crest was emblazoned on the shirt in white rather than gold but this was due to white being a cheaper alternative to a more expensive gold coloured thread.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1989, Portsmouth scrapped the traditional crest and replaced it with an entirely new design. This crest showed a football in front of an [[anchor]] (representing the navy) and a [[sword]] (representing the army), with the whole design surrounded by an outer ring of ships rope. An alternative version included a circular version of the traditional star and crescent crest in place of the football.\n\nDuring 1989 and 1993, the rope and anchor crest was dropped replaced with a simpler eight pointed star and crescent moon on a long narrow shield. At the foot of the shield, a blue banner featured \"''Portsmouth Football Club''\" written within it in capital letters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Portsmouth/Portsmouth.htm|title=Portsmouth - Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1993-1997, the 1989-93 long narrow shield design was replaced by an embroidered badge of the city of Portsmouth Coat of Arms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Portsmouth/Portsmouth.htm|title=Portsmouth - Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://greatestkits.co.uk/products/1993-95-portsmouth-home-shirt-l|title=1993/95 Portsmouth Home Shirt (L)|website=Greatest Kits|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n\nThe 1993-97 city arms crest was replaced in 1997, with an eight pointed gold star and a golden crescent moon on a blue shield edged with a gold outer rim. At the foot of the shield, a gold ribbon with \"''Portsmouth F.C.''\" written in blue gothic lettering completed the new design.  This new crest coincided with the rebuilding and reopening of the new Fratton End and tjhe clubs centennial anniversary in the 1997\u201398 season\n\nIn 2007, an additional \"Since 1898\" was added to the 1997 crest ribbon underneath the shield in time for the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nOn 6 May 2008, a month after their 110th Anniversary, Portsmouth revealed a new crest with a very three dimensional look, the tradition curved shield with \"three points\" at the top of the shield were replaced with two straightened angles, with \"Portsmouth F.C.\" written above the star on the shield.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ffcw001.azureedge.net/-/media/team/england/crest/portsmouth.png?w=600&h=600|title=Portsmouth Crest|last=|first=|date=|website=ffcw001.azureedge.net|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref> The traditional elongated crescent moon was replaced with a new circular one, which closely resembled that on the city's Coat of Arms. The new crest had its debut in the 2008 FA Cup Final, in which Portsmouth also wore a new 110th Anniversary all-blue commemorative home strip.\n\nAs part of the World War I Centennial Commemorations in the 2014\u201315 season, the club opted to replace the 2008 crest on the home kit with one almost identical to that used in 1913\u201314. This was a more traditional-looking club crest featuring the traditional three points at the top of a slightly rounded shield but with a silver five-pointed star inside instead of the usual eight-pointed one. The moon featured on the crest was also silver, both appearing on a blue background.\n\nIn June 2015, following positive feedback from supporters, Portsmouth F.C. decided to revert the official club crest back to a familiar and traditional design, over the one introduced in 2008, which was often criticised by Pompey fans for looking too similar to Arsenal F.C.'s updated modern era crest. Portsmouth's new 2015 crest was virtually identical in design to that which has been used for the majority of the club's history. The famous \"star and moon\", both silver-white on a blue background, have a slight three-dimensional appearance. The star was restored back to the familiar eight pointed design, instead of the five pointed version used in the 1913 and 2014 crests. The crest's shield retains the three points at the top but is in a more traditional shape. No lettering or numbering features on the new club crest, just like that which was used on home shirts the previous 2014\u201315 season.\n\nOn 4 May 2017 at [[Portsmouth Guildhall]], The Tornante Company, owned by Michael Eisner met the Pompey Supporters Trust (PST), the fan-based owners of Portsmouth, to discuss a potential takeover of the football club. During the meeting, the prospective new owners identified a long overlooked ownership and copyright issue concerning the traditional Portsmouth crest \u2013 Portsmouth Football Club did not legally \"own\" the symbols on the crest, which had actually only been \"on loan\" to the club from Portsmouth City Council since 1913.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n7DZY79jTY |publisher=The Tornante Company |via=YouTube.com |title=Michael Eisner's Q&A Session with Portsmouth Supporters Trust |date=13 May 2017 |accessdate=8 August 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe Tornante Company completed their purchase of Portsmouth on 3 August 2017 after a majority vote from members of the Pompey Supporters Trust to sell.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} To rectify the copyright and commercial marketing issues with the current 2015 crest, the decision was taken by the new owners to design and copyright a brand new crest for the future.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Portsmouth's fans were consulted by traditional and digital media during late 2017 and early 2018 with various designs for new crests. Most of the designs were minor tweaks and adjustments of the existing 2015 crest, just enough to make a new crest design different from that of Portsmouth City Council's coat of Arms.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nOn 15 March 2018, two newly redesigned club crests were finally revealed. Both new crests featured a new eight pointed nautical compass star and the addition of an \"1898\" date, the founding year of the football club, beneath the crescent moon. The new crests are to be copyrighted and introduced for the new 2018\u201319 season. The first new crest, similar to previous crests, is intended for players shirts. The second crest, surrounded by a blue ring with \"Portsmouth Football Club\" written in it, will be used for letterheads, merchandise and other commercial purposes.<ref name=\"portsmouthfc.co.uk\"/>\n\n==Home colours==\n{|\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = _claretborder|\n pattern_b = _Roma2|\n pattern_ra = _claretborder|\n pattern_sh = |\n pattern_so = |\n leftarm = ff9999|\n body = ff9999|\n rightarm = ff9999|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n socks = 000000|\n title = 1899\u20131909\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = |\n pattern_b = _collar|\n pattern_ra = |\n leftarm = FFFFFF|\n body         = FFFFFF|\n rightarm = FFFFFF|\n shorts = 003366|\n socks = 003366|\n title = 1909\u20131912\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = |\n pattern_b = _collarwhite|\n pattern_ra = |\n leftarm = 0066FF|\n body         = 0066FF|\n rightarm = 0066FF|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n pattern_so = _2 white stripes|\n socks = 000000|\n title = 1912\u20131933\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = |\n pattern_b = _collarwhite|\n pattern_ra = |\n leftarm = 0000FF|\n body         = 0000FF|\n rightarm = 0000FF|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n pattern_so = _2 white stripes|\n socks = 000000|\n title = 1933\u20131947\n}}\n|}\n\nIn their first 1899\u20131900 season in the Southern League Division One, Portsmouth's first home colours were salmon pink shirts with maroon collars and cuffs, matched with white shorts and black socks.

The collars and cuffs were the same colour as the Corporation of Portsmouth's public trams, which were painted maroon at the time.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Portsmouth/Portsmouth.htm |title=Portsmouth |publisher=Historical Football Kits |website=historicalkits.co.uk |accessdate=8 August 2018 }}</ref> These colours lasted until the end of the 1908\u201309 season.

The next season, Portsmouth ended the poor 1910\u201311 season in bottom place and Portsmouth were relegated to Southern League Division Two. Following relegation, a financial crisis, fund raising, promotion in early 1912 and then another financial crisis, the original Portsmouth company that had been formed in 1898 was 'wound up'. A new limited company was formed on 27 July 1912 as Portsmouth F.C.'s parent company.\n\nFor the start of the 1912\u201313 Southern League Division One season, Portsmouth changed their home colours to azure blue shirts, white shorts and black socks. This was to become Portsmouth's home kit colour combination up until the start of the 1933\u201334 season, when the shirts were changed to a royal blue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Portsmouth/Portsmouth.htm|title=Portsmouth - Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk}}</ref> These colours remained until the start of the 1947\u201348 season, when the black socks were changed to red; this coinciding with the club's most successful period and has remained the favoured colours for the majority of the time since.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pompey's Home Kits Through The Ages |url=http://www.pompeyweb.co.uk/kits.htm |publisher=PompeyWeb |accessdate=27 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603114751/http://www.pompeyweb.co.uk/kits.htm |archivedate=3 June 2008}}</ref> Portsmouth F.C. changed their colour combination several times during the 1966\u20131976 period, before reverting to the now tradition post-war blue shirts, white shorts and red stockings in 1976.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> For the club's 110th anniversary season in 2008\u201309, Portsmouth played in an all blue home kit, which debuted in the previous season's successful 2008 FA Cup Final win.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Since the 2009\u201310 season, Portsmouth reverted to the now traditional blue-white-red home kit.\n\n===Red socks memorial===\n{|\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = |\n pattern_b = _collarwhite|\n pattern_ra = |\n leftarm = 0000FF|\n body         = 0000FF|\n rightarm = 0000FF|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n socks = FF0000|\n title = 1947\u20131966\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = _whiteborder|\n pattern_b = _whitecollar|\n pattern_ra = _whiteborder|\n leftarm = 0000FF|\n body         = 0000FF|\n rightarm = 0000FF|\n shorts = 0000FF|\n pattern_so = _whitehorizontal|\n socks = 0000FF|\n title = 1966\u20131972\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = _whiteborder|\n pattern_b = _whitecollar|\n pattern_ra = _whiteborder|\n leftarm = 0000FF|\n body         = 0000FF|\n rightarm = 0000FF|\n pattern_sh = _blue stripes|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n pattern_so = _whitehorizontal|\n socks = 0000FF|\n title = 1972\u20131973\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = _blueborder|\n pattern_b = _pfcaway10|\n pattern_ra = _blueborder|\n leftarm = FFFFFF|\n body = |\n rightarm = FFFFFF|\n shorts = 0000FF|\n pattern_so = _bluehorizontal|\n socks = FFFFFF|\n title = 1973\u20131976\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = |\n pattern_b = _vneckwhite|\n pattern_ra = |\n leftarm = 0000FF|\n body         = 0000FF|\n rightarm = 0000FF|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n socks = FF0000|\n title = 1976\u20132008\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = _whiteline|\n pattern_b  = _pfcccc|\n pattern_ra = _whiteline|\n leftarm    = 0000FF|\n body       = 0000FF|\n rightarm   = 0000FF|\n shorts     = 0000FF|\n socks      = 0000FF|\n title      = 2008\u20132009\n}}\n|}\nPortsmouth had predominantly worn black socks since their first match in 1899 up until the end of the post-World War II 1946\u201347 FA Cup season \u2013 in which the Football League had not yet resumed.\n\nDuring the Second World War and post-war periods, the British Army's [[Bernard Montgomery|Field Marshal Sir Bernard 'Monty' Montgomery]] had been based at [[Southwick House]], 5 miles to the north of Portsmouth. Montgomery regularly attended war-time League South matches at Fratton Park, becoming the honorary President of Portsmouth Football Club. Following the suggestion by Montgomery, red socks were introduced by the club as a memorial to soldiers lost in wartime as red is the traditional colour of the British Army and also the colour of the [[Remembrance poppy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/news/2013/may/crest-of-a-wave/ |title=Crest Of A Wave |publisher=Portsmouth Football Club |date=22 May 2013 |accessdate=8 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith the resumption of a full professional Football League season in England in 1947\u201348, Portsmouth changed their socks from the usual black to red for the start of the 1947\u201348 season.

An exact origin for the ''Pompey'' nickname has never formally been identified by historians, as many variations, sources and interpretations of the ''Pompey'' nickname exist.\n\nOne possible theory of the Pompey nickname is the [[Contraction (grammar)|grammatical contraction]] of the [[Old Portsmouth]] location name '''[[Portsmouth Point]]''' to the shorter '''Po'm. P.''' ('''Po''''''rts'''''m.'''''outh'' '''P.'''''oint'') which supposedly saved time and space when handwritten into a ship's logbook. Other theories include Royal Navy romanticism of the Roman character '''[[Pompey]]''' from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', used by officers to inspire the ship's company.\n\nAnother ''Pompey'' nickname theory, based on actual historic events, originates from {{HMS|Pompee|1793|6}}, originally a newly built [[T\u00e9m\u00e9raire-class ship of the line|T\u00e9m\u00e9raire class]] French frigate named ''La Pomp\u00e9e'' that was surrendered by French Royalists during the [[French Revolution]] to their British allies during the [[Siege of Toulon]] in 1793. The ship ''La Pomp\u00e9e'' eventually arrived at [[Spithead]] in 1794 and was recommissioned into the Royal Navy as ''HMS Pomp\u00e9e''.  In 1797, HMS ''Pomp\u00e9e'' was one of sixteen ships involved in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies]] of 1797. During her later career, HMS ''Pomp\u00e9e'' also served as Portsmouth's guard ship and ended her career in the early nineteenth century anchored in [[Portsmouth Harbour]] as the chief prison ship ''Pompee''. ''Pompee'' was also used as prison ship for French prisoners captured during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u20131815). The harsh treatment received aboard ''Pompee'' gained a national notoriety with the criminal classes of England, the name ''Pompey'' itself became a northern England slang word for prison.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-2010,00.html?gusrc=gpd |title=Why is Portsmouth called Pompey? |work=The Guardian |author=David Francis |accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref> The ''Pompee'' became a familiar local landmark and gained a common association with the Royal Navy and the civilian Portsmouth population, who both then began associating ''Pompee'' with Portsmouth.

Royal Artillery Portsmouth's supporters were also responsible for creating [[Portsmouth F.C.#'The Pompey Chimes'|\"The Town Hall Chimes\"]] chant, which later became known as ''\"The Pompey Chimes\"'' chant in the twentieth century.  The chant originally began at Royal Artillery Portsmouth's home football ground at Burnaby Road, Portsmouth ([[United Services Recreation Ground]]) and was within easy earshot of the nearby Portsmouth Town Hall (now called [[Portsmouth Guildhall]]) clock bells, which had inspired the chant.\n\nRoyal Artillery (Portsmouth) F.C. were disqualified for \"professionalism\" after an 1898\u201399 FA Amateur Cup match.  Royal Artillery were also forced to field only a team of amateur reserve players, thus weakening the remaining Royal Artillery team for the remainder of the 1898\u201399 Southern Football League season. Royal Artillery finished bottom of the [[1898\u201399 Southern Football League#Division One|table]], relegated after a relegation match with Cowes F.C. and were eventually disbanded. The \"Pompey\" nickname, the \"Town Hall Chimes\" chant, some of the Royal Artillery players and their supporters then migrated to a newly formed football club, named Portsmouth F.C., earlier formed on 5 April 1898.<ref name=\"portsmouth.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/heritage/history-of-the-chimes-1-1299340|title=History of the chimes|website=Portsmouth.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nPortsmouth F.C., as the \"new\" Pompey, played their first Southern Football League match away to Chatham Town on Saturday 2 September 1899, winning 0\u20131. Their first home match at Fratton Park stadium took place only four days later on Wednesday 6 September 1899, a friendly match against Southampton F.C., which Portsmouth won 2\u20130. During the first early seasons of Portsmouth F.C., the football team wore salmon pink shirts with maroon collars and cuffs, white shorts and black socks. The pink shirts gave rise to an alternative nickname, ''''The Shrimps''''. 'The Shrimps' went out of common usage after 1909 when Portsmouth F.C. began playing in white shirts, navy blue shorts and navy blue stockings. After the original 1898 founding company was replaced in 1912, Portsmouth began playing in their now familiar blue shirts in the 1912\u201313 season.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Stadium==\n[[File:Fratton Park entrance.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The entrance to Fratton Park's South Stand, with its mock Tudor facade]]\n{{main|Fratton Park}}\nPortsmouth F.C. play their home games at Fratton Park, in the district of [[Milton, Portsmouth]]. The stadium has been home to the club throughout its entire history since the club formed in 1898. Fratton Park is affectionately nicknamed \"The Old Girl\" by Portsmouth F.C. supporters.\n\nPlans for relocation were first mooted in the early 1990s, but due to various objections and financial obstacles, the club has continued to play at Fratton Park. Most recently, plans for relocation have included new stadia on a site offered by the [[Royal Navy]] at [[Horsea Island]], between Stamshaw and Port Solent, and on reclaimed land in Portsmouth Harbour beside the existing naval base. The former was mooted as a possible [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] venue as part of England's bid process. However, the cost to the city's taxpayers to join the bid was deemed too great a risk to take.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/8378313.stm |title=Football \u2013 Portsmouth pulls out of 2018 bid |publisher=BBC News |date=25 November 2009 |accessdate=2 December 2013}}</ref> A third, oft returned-to option, is to build a new stadium on the site of the existing Fratton Park.\n\nFollowing Portsmouth F.C.'s financial troubles, subsequent relegation from the Premier League, and the failure of the England 2018 bid, as of May 2017 there are no active plans for a new club stadium.\n\n==Supporters and rivalries==\n{{main|South Coast derby}}\n[[File:Pompeywembley.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Portsmouth fans at Wembley Stadium for the 2007\u201308 FA Cup semi-final with West Bromwich Albion]]\nPortsmouth's main rivals are [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], who are 19.8 miles (31.8&nbsp;km) away, with the \"border\" between the two located in the Hampshire village of [[Titchfield]].  The [[South Coast Derby]] is one of the less frequently played rivalries within English football due to the clubs being in different divisions however this usually adds to the ferocity of the fixture.\n\nPrior to the mid/late 1960s, rivalry between Portsmouth and Southampton was largely non-existent, as a consequence of their disparity in league status. This [[Local derby|derby match]] has been sporadic. Since 1977, the teams have only played league games against each other in four seasons (1987\u201388, 2003\u201304, 2004\u201305 and 2011\u201312). Including Southern League games, there have been 64 league games between the clubs, but they have also met five times in the FA Cup, Portsmouth beating their rivals 4\u20131 at [[St Mary's Stadium]] in their last meeting in 2010, and twice in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] \u2013 with Southampton winning both times.\n\nMany Portsmouth supporters commonly use the derogatory nickname '''''Scummer''''' (plural: '''''Scummers''''') to describe Southampton fans, or collectively '''''Scum''''' to also include their football club, and indeed the city of Southampton itself.\n* A disproven common origin theory dating from the late twentieth century suggested that the ''Scum'' nickname was an acronym of ''Southampton Company of Union Men'', linked to a vague recollection of an unspecified and unsourced past dockers strike, in which Southampton-based dockers supposedly crossed Portsmouth dockyard picket lines when brought in as [[Strikebreaker|scab labour]] to work inside the naval base. This theory is almost certainly an urban myth, as Royal Navy dockers are not permitted to go on strike.\n* Victorian era dockers employed in the supposedly higher status [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth Royal Dockyard]], looked down in disdain upon the civilian merchant port dockers at [[Port of Southampton|Southampton Docks]] and nicknamed them ''Scum'', as scum, flotsam and jetsam are useless residue found floating on, or nearby water.\n* According to the Oxford English Dictionary, ''Scummers'' was a derogatory name with naval origins for pirates or buccaneers, and was first recorded in use in 1585.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/scummer |title=scummer |work=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=24 January 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"theguardian.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/jan/23/newsstory.sport8 |title=Scummers v Skates |work=The Guardian |author=Kevin Mitchell |date=23 January 2005 |accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Portsmouth supporters have had the equally derogatory nickname '''''Skate''''' bestowed upon them by Southampton fans as a rebuttal to ''Scummer'' since the 1987\u201388 Division One season. This was unofficially chosen by Southampton fans from a list of insults compiled by a Southampton-based supporters fanzine called ''The Ugly Inside'' in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/southampton/news/48841/ |title=Why Bournemouth Will Never Be Saints Rivals ! |work=FansNetwork |date=17 October 2018 |accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref> Ironically, the chosen nickname ''Skate'' was actually stolen from the civilian population of Portsmouth, who had long used ''Skate'' as a derogatory insult or nickname for sailors based in Portsmouth Dockyard and other Royal Navy establishments. According to legend and folklore, Royal Navy matelots on long sea voyages were regularly denied female company, and would keep a [[Skate (fish)|skate]] (fish species) in their hammock or bunkside, as the mouth of the skate was supposedly used as a substitute vagina. Sailors ashore in Royal Navy uniform seeking the services of Portsmouth's prostitutes would often be refused service and met with a ''\"I ain't no skate bait, mate!\"'' rebuttal.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/>\n\nAnother rivalry over the years, colloquially known as the \"Dockyard Derby\", is with [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/plymouth_argyle/7201902.stm|title=Naval support for Dockyard Derby|date=22 January 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2289954/Tynan-Plymouth-can-cause-derby-upset.html|title=Tynan: Plymouth can cause derby upset|date=25 January 2008|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref> This rivalry is also known as the Battle of the Ports.<ref name=harvey>{{cite book |title=Rivals: The Off-Beat Guide to the 92 League Clubs |last1=Harvey |first1=Geoff |last2=Strowger |first2=Vanessa |year=2004 |publisher=Aesculus Press Ltd |location=Swadlincote, Derbyshire |isbn=1-904328-13-X |page=133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mG7XLIPEHvAC&pg=PT111&dq=%22battle+of+the+ports%22+football |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref> In recent seasons the club has also developed a minor rivalry with [[Sunderland AFC|Sunderland]], mainly stemming from the clubs meeting each other 5 times in the 18/19 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sunderland-portsmouth-story-so-far-16284128|title=Sunderland vs Portsmouth: A story of red cards, penalties and a simmering rivalry|first=Sean|last=Tighe|date=16 May 2019|website=nechronicle}}</ref>\n\nLesser rivalries exist with fellow South Coast clubs [[A.F.C.

Football referees would use the Town Hall's clock bells as a reference to when the football match should end at 4&nbsp;pm. Just before 4&nbsp;pm the crowd of supporters would slowly lilt in unison with the Town Hall's chimes on the hour to encourage the referee to blow the whistle to signify full-time.

On Friday 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. On Saturday 2 September 1939, all divisions of the Football League played their third and final game of the season, with [[Blackpool F.C.]] at the top of the table and Portsmouth in 18th position. These would be the last national Football League fixtures before abandonment following the [[United Kingdom declaration of war on Germany (1939)|British declaration of war on Germany]] on Sunday 3 September 1939.

The London War Cup competition required Portsmouth, the current FA Cup champions, to secede from the Football Association to enter. Portsmouth progressed to the 1942 London War Cup final at Wembley Stadium, but were beaten by [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] and finished as runners-up.

Manager Jack Tinn was rumoured to have kept the FA Cup trophy 'safe under his bed' during a part of the war. Because the navy city of Portsmouth was a primary strategic military target for German Luftwaffe bombing, the FA Cup trophy was routinely moved around the city of Portsmouth for its safety and protection, moving from Fratton Park's boardroom, into bank vaults, back to Fratton Park and around local pubs. During the worst of the bombing on Portsmouth, the FA Cup trophy was also taken ten miles north of Portsmouth, to the nearby Hampshire village of [[Lovedean]], where it was kept and displayed in a quaint thatched roof country pub called \"The Bird in Hand\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lovedeanbirdinhand.co.uk/?BIHrequestID=4C55838218D9D39854D199BD64BA29 |title=About Us |publisher=The Bird in Hand |website=lovedeanbirdinhand.co.uk |accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref> In 1945, the FA Cup trophy was taken around the streets of Portsmouth and proudly shown off at [[Victory in Europe Day]] street parties.\n\nFA Cup competition was resumed for the [[1945\u201346 in English football|1945\u201346 season]], but the resumption of the Football League had to wait one more year. Portsmouth, as a Division One team and as the current FA Cup Champions (from 1939), were drawn to play against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in the Third Round stage of the FA Cup competition. The first of the two-leg tie was played at Birmingham's [[St Andrew's (stadium)|St. Andrew's]] stadium on 5 January 1946 and the result was 1\u20130 in Birmingham City's favour. The second leg at Fratton Park ended 0\u20130 on 9 January 1946, with Birmingham City winning 1\u20130 overall on aggregate. (See [[1945\u201346 FA Cup]] for full results) Sadly, the FA Cup trophy was not to stay with Portsmouth for an eighth consecutive year and was returned to the Football Association in time for the [[1946 FA Cup Final]], in which Derby County were awarded the trophy.\n\nThe Football League finally resumed in [[1946\u201347 Football League|1946\u201347]]. Portsmouth had capitalised on the footballers called up to serve in the Royal Navy and Royal Marines in the war years and recruited some of them. In this way, Portsmouth had the pick of some of the best. Portsmouth ended the 1946\u201347 Football League First Division season in 12th place. On 1 May 1947, legendary manager Jack Tinn left Portsmouth, with [[Bob Jackson (football manager)|Bob Jackson]] taking over the role on the same day.\n\nThe second post-war Football League First Division season resumed under manager Bob Jackson in [[1947\u201348 Football League|1947\u201348]]. This was also the first season Portsmouth wore red socks, which replaced their traditional black socks. The red socks were an idea proposed by Portsmouth's honorary president, Field Marshal Montgomery, who had suggested that Portsmouth should wear red socks to commemorate the sacrifice of British servicemen lost in war. Red is traditionally the colour of the [[British Army]] and also of the [[Remembrance poppy]] flower, and so Montgomery's idea was adopted by Portsmouth at the start of the season. Bob Jackson's Portsmouth finished in 8th place at the end of the [[1947\u201348 Football League|1947\u201348 First Division season]].\n\n===1948\u201349 and 1949\u201350: Champions of England===\nIn their 50-year \"Golden Jubilee\" anniversary [[1948\u201349 Football League|1948\u201349 season]], Bob Jackson's Portsmouth side were tipped to be the first team of the 20th century to win a historic Football League and FA Cup \"[[Double (association football)|double]]\".  The potential of a rare 'Double' saw Fratton Park attracting average home attendances of 36,000 supporters, and a record attendance of 51,385 in an FA Cup quarter-final match against Derby County on 26 February 1949, which Portsmouth won 2\u20131. The Fratton Park attendance of 51,385 is no longer a club record. Portsmouth lost 1\u20133 in the FA Cup semi-final against Leicester City on 26 March 1949 at the neutral [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury]] stadium. Portsmouth however, did win one half of the 'Double', securing the First Division title and becoming Football League Champions of England at the end of the [[1948\u201349 Portsmouth F.C. season|1948\u201349 season]], with Manchester United finishing as runners-up. Portsmouth's championship-winning team consisted of [[Ernest Butler]], [[Phil Rookes]], [[Harry Ferrier]], [[Jimmy Scoular]], [[Reg Flewin]], [[Jimmy Dickinson]], [[Peter Harris (footballer)|Peter Harris]], [[Duggie Reid]], [[Ike Clarke]], [[Len Phillips]], [[Jack Froggatt]], [[Jasper Yeuell]], [[Lindy Delapenha]], [[Bert Barlow]] and [[Cliff Parker (footballer)|Cliff Parker]].\n\nBob Jackson's Portsmouth side beat [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] 5\u20131 on the last day of the following [[1949\u201350 Football League|1949\u201350 season]], winning the Football League title again for a second consecutive season \u2013 on goal difference \u2013 as both Portsmouth and runners up [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] finished the season with 53 points each, and only one point ahead of third place Sunderland on 52 points.

In the [[1956\u201357 Football League#First Division|1956\u201357 season]], Portsmouth escaped relegation by four points and finished two places above the drop zone.\n\nIn the following [[1957\u201358 Football League#First Division|1957\u201358 season]], Portsmouth once again escaped relegation on goal difference and finished one place above the relegation zone. Manager Eddie Lever left Portsmouth in April 1958.\n\n[[Freddie Cox]] became new Portsmouth manager in August 1958. The new 1958\u201359 season was the first Football League season with four national divisions. The two old regional Third Divisions (North and South) which had begun in the 1921\u201322 season were restructured and replaced with two new national divisions, named the Third Division and Fourth Division. At the end of the [[1958\u201359 Football League|1958\u201359 season]] Portsmouth finished bottom of the First Division, ending their 32-year stay in the First Division, and relegation to the Second Division. By now, the championship winning team of 1949 and 1950 had been broken up, caused by ageing or injury.\n\n===1959\u20131979: Decline and relegation to the Fourth Division===\nFollowing the bottom-place finish in the previous 1958\u201359 First Division season, Portsmouth started the [[1959\u201360 Football League|1959\u201360 season]] in the Second Division, the second tier of English football, which Portsmouth had last been in during the 1926\u201327 season. After another poor season, they escaped a further relegation to the Third Division only by 2 points and finishing only one place above the relegation zone.\n\nIn the [[1960\u201361 Football League|1960\u201361 season]] Portsmouth finished second-to-last place in the Second Division relegation zone and were relegated once again to the Third Division, (the first former [[English football champions|English League champions]] to do so). Manager [[Freddie Cox]] was sacked in February 1961.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blog.woolwicharsenal.co.uk/archives/6642 |title=Freddie Cox DFC |publisher=AISA Arsenal History Society |accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nUnder the guidance of [[George Smith (footballer, born 1915)|George Smith]], Portsmouth, now in the Third Division for the [[1961\u201362 Football League First Division|1960\u201361 season]] had a good season and were promoted back to the Second Division at the first time of asking after winning the Third Division title. Field-Marshal Bernard 'Monty' Montgomery of Alamein, was the honorary President of Portsmouth, having begun to support them during World War II due to the proximity of his headquarters at [[Southwick House]] on the outskirts of Portsmouth. In private correspondence dated 25 April 1962, he wrote to Smith: \"I congratulate you very much on getting Portsmouth out of the Third Division \u2013 which was completely a wrong place for a famous team. While the players all did their stuff, the major credit goes to you.\"\n\nDespite limited financial means, manager George Smith maintained Portsmouth's Second Division status throughout the rest of the 1960s until Smith was replaced by [[Ron Tindall]] in April 1970 as Smith moved upstairs to become general manager in April 1970, until his retirement from football in 1973.\n\nThe cash injection that accompanied the arrival of John Deacon as chairman in 1972 failed to improve Portsmouth's Second Division position. Ron Tindall was replaced in May 1973 by [[John Mortimore (footballer)|John Mortimore]]. However, Ron Tindall returned for two games as caretaker manager after manager John Mortimore left in 1974. [[Ian St. John]] became new Portsmouth manager in September 1974.\n\nWith Deacon unable to continue bankrolling the club on the same scale, Portsmouth finished bottom of the Second Division in the [[1975\u201376 Football League#Second Division|1975\u201376 season]] and were relegated down to the Third Division.\n\nIn November of the [[1976\u201377 Football League|1976\u201377 Third Division season]], the club found itself needing to raise [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]25,000 to pay off debts and so avoid bankruptcy.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} With players having to be sold to ease the club's financial situation, and no money available for replacements, Portsmouth were forced to rely on inexperienced young players. Initially results improved, but then declined again. On 4 May 1977, Ian St. John was replaced as manager by former Portsmouth and England international player [[Jimmy Dickinson]]. They ended the [[1976\u201377 Football League|1976\u201377 season]] only one place and one point above the Third Division's relegation zone.\nThey were relegated at the end of the new 1977\u201378 season, finishing in bottom place.\n\nIn the [[1978\u201379 Football League|1978\u201379 Fourth Division season]], Portsmouth finished in 7th position. Jimmy Dickinson suffered a heart attack near the end of the season and after the season in May 1979, was replaced by [[Frank Burrows]].\n\n===1979\u20131987: Return to the First Division===\nUnder Frank Burrows new management, Portsmouth gained promotion back to the Third Division after finishing in 4th place in the [[1979\u201380 Football League#Fourth Division|1979\u201380 season]].\n\nThe following [[1981\u201382 Football League#Third Division|1981\u201382 Third Division season]], Portsmouth finished mid-table in thirteenth position. On 21 May 1982, Frank Burrows departed and [[Bobby Campbell (English footballer)|Bobby Campbell]] became the new Portsmouth manager.\n\nDuring the [[1982\u201383 Football League#Third Division|1982\u201383 Third Division season]], former Portsmouth player, manager and England international [[Jimmy Dickinson]] died aged 57 on 8 November 1982 after suffering three heart attacks. A public memorial service was held at a packed [[St Mary's Church, Portsea|St. Mary's Church]] in Fratton, Portsmouth.  Dickinson was laid to rest in [[Alton, Hampshire]]. Pompey later that season won the [[1982\u201383 Football League#Third Division|1982\u201383 Third Division championship title]], gaining promotion back to the Second Division.\n\nIn the [[1983\u201384 Football League#Second Division|1983\u201384 Second Division season]], Portsmouth finished sixteenth place in the table. After the season, Bobby Campbell was replaced by former England international and [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] winner, [[Alan Ball Jr.|Alan Ball]] on 11 May 1984.\n\nUnder Ball, Portsmouth's results markedly improved and they narrowly missed winning promotion to the First Division in the [[1984\u201385 Football League#Second Division|1984\u201385 Second Division season]], finishing in 4th place on goal difference. They finished in 4th place again for the following [[1985\u201386 Football League#Second Division|1985\u201386 season]].\n\nIn Ball's third season as Portsmouth manager in the [[1986\u201387 Football League#Second Division|1986\u201387 Second Division season]], Portsmouth finished as runners-up behind Derby County, gaining promotion back to the First Division for the first time since the 1958\u201359 season. During the season, the upper tier of the Fratton End stand, built only thirty years earlier in 1956, was closed due to structural concerns, leaving only the lower tier of the Fratton End open to fans.\n\nBy the middle of the new [[1987\u201388 Football League#First Division|1987\u201388 First Division season]], the club was again in financial trouble. Portsmouth were relegated straight back down to the Second Division. The summer of 1988 saw chairman John Deacon sell the club to London-based businessman and former [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] chairman, [[Jim Gregory (football chairman)|Jim Gregory]].  Fratton Park was in a poor condition, with the Fratton End still half closed to fans and leaking roofs in the North and South stands.\n\nWith new chairman Jim Gregory injecting money into the club, work began in the summer of 1988 to demolish the upper tier of the Fratton End and its roof. The North and South stands were refurbished and both received smart new blue-coloured metal sheet roofs.\n\n===1988\u20132003: The Second Tier===\n\nAfter a single disappointing season in the First Division, Portsmouth were relegated back to the Second Division for the [[1988\u201389 Football League#Second Division|1988\u201389 season]]. Halfway through the season, Alan Ball was sacked on 17 January 1989 and replaced by [[John Gregory (footballer)|John Gregory]]. The entire Fratton End stand was closed during most of the season during demolition works, with only the lower tier of the stand reopening in the springtime of 1989. Portsmouth ended the season only two places above the relegation zone.\n\nFollowing the 15 April 1989 [[Hillsborough Disaster]], Portsmouth removed the perimeter fences from Fratton Park for the new [[1989\u201390 Football League#Second Division|1989\u201390 season]], except at the Milton End to separate away supporters.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The season saw John Gregory leaving the club on 3 January 1990. Assistant manager Frank Burrows became manager for a second spell on 23 January 1990. Portsmouth finished in 12th position at the end of the season.\n\nThe [[1990\u201391 Football League#Second Division|1990\u201391 season]] saw Frank Burrows resign as manager on 13 March 1991 after a string of bad results. Burrows was replaced by coach [[Graham Paddon]] until the end of the season, finishing in 17th position.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n[[Jim Smith (footballer, born 1940)|Jim Smith]]'s arrival as manager at the start of the [[1991\u201392 Portsmouth F.C. season|1991\u201392 season]] sparked a revival in the team's fortunes and that year Portsmouth reached the semi-finals of the [[1991\u201392 FA Cup|FA Cup]], meeting Liverpool at neutral ground Highbury on 5 April 1992 \u2013 the 94th Anniversary of Portsmouth Football Club. Portsmouth took the lead in extra time from a 111th minute [[Darren Anderton]] goal. However, Liverpool's [[Ronnie Whelan]] equalised five minutes later, and the semi-final match ended tied 1\u20131 after the allotted 120 minutes. The tie was then replayed at [[Villa Park]] on 13 April 1992 and ended 0\u20130 after extra time.  Portsmouth then lost 1\u20133 on penalties to Liverpool, who went on to meet Sunderland in the 1992 FA Cup Final, which Liverpool won 2\u20130.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe [[1992\u201393 Football League]] season saw a major restructuring of the [[English football league system|English football \"pyramid\" system]], caused by all the First Division clubs resigning from the Football League and forming a new breakaway top tier [[FA Premier League]]. Now without a First Division, the Football League Second Division was renamed as the [[1992\u201393 Football League#First Division|\"Football League First Division\"]] for the 1992\u201393 season. The FA Premier League also had a new winners trophy made, meaning the famous old Football League First Division championship trophy became demoted in status, now acting as the new second tier \"First Division\" championship trophy instead. Portsmouth had a good 1992\u201393 season in the new \"First Division\", but missed out on automatic promotion to the new first tier Premier League by virtue of scoring only one fewer goal than second-placed [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]]. In the subsequent promotion play-offs, Portsmouth lost 3\u20132 on aggregate over two games to Leicester City in the play-off semi-finals for the third promotion place.\n\nDuring the [[1993\u201394 Portsmouth F.C. season|1993\u201394 season]] under manager Jim Smith, Portsmouth finished 17th out of 24 in the First Division, winning 15 matches, drawing 13 and losing 18. The team reached the quarterfinals of the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] and the third round of the FA Cup, in both cases being knocked out after replays.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe [[1994\u201395 Portsmouth F.C. season|1994\u201395 season]] was a disappointing one for Portsmouth and after a decline in form which left them struggling at the wrong end of the \"new\" First Division, Jim Smith was sacked on 1 February 1995 and was replaced by [[Terry Fenwick]], who guided them to safety with 4 wins in their final 6 league games.\n\nIn the [[1995\u201396 Portsmouth F.C. season|1995\u201396 season]] Fenwick's first full season in charge of Portsmouth, relegation to the Second Division was avoided on the last day of the season (on goal difference) when Portsmouth won away at [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] while other results went the club's way.\n\nIn the summer of 1996, [[Terry Venables]] arrived at Portsmouth as a consultant. Venables had recently resigned as the England national team manager after the [[UEFA Euro 1996]] competition. Fratton Park was transformed into an all-seat stadium, with new blue plastic seats fitted to the lower North terrace, Milton End, lower South terrace paddocks and also to the remnant of the Fratton End terrace.\n\nIn the [[1996\u201397 Portsmouth F.C. season|1996\u201397]] league campaign, Portsmouth finished just short of the qualifying places for the playoffs for promotion to the Premier League. Terry Venables took over as chairman in February 1997 after buying a 51 per cent controlling share in the club for \u00a31.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/46933.stm|title=Venables quits Portsmouth taking a tidy profit|date=13 January 1998|work=BBC News |accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref> The team enjoyed a run in the [[1996\u201397 FA Cup]] competition, beating FA Premier League side [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] on 15 February 1997, but were eventually beaten 1\u20134 by Chelsea F.C. in the quarter-finals at Fratton Park on 9 March 1997.\n\nAt the end of the 1996\u201397 season, the Fratton End was fully demolished in the summer (of 1997) and work began to build a new Fratton End stand. In addition, a new roof extension was built over the lower tier of the North Stand and was completed before the new season started. These new additions to Fratton Park were partly funded by the [[Football Trust]] (now [[The Football Foundation]]).\n\nAt 4.59pm on Friday 31 October 1997, the new \u00a32.2 million Fratton End was officially cleared for its opening, with one minute to spare before a 5 pm deadline. Problems with some misorientated Fratton End rooftop floodlights caused the Fratton End of the pitch to be \"shrouded in gloom on Hallowe'en\", according to the Sky Sports 3 TV commentator, causing some doubt that the live televised Division One game against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] would take place.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Fortunately, the match referee, [[Paul Danson]] gave the go-ahead for the evening fixture. The game was won 0\u20131 by Swindon Town with an official Fratton Park attendance of only 8,707. As a mark of respect to the club's former player and manager, a memorial portrait of [[Jimmy Dickinson]] was incorporated into the seating of the new Fratton End stand, along with the club's crest. Terry Venables' role as coach of the Australian national team meant he was frequently absent from Portsmouth. Meanwhile, the team's results were poor. Two-thirds of the way through the [[1997\u201398 Portsmouth F.C. season|1997\u201398 season]], he and manager Terry Fenwick left the club, with Portsmouth on the bottom of the table, and Venables selling his shareholding back to Martin Gregory, son of former chairman Jim Gregory. Alan Ball then returned as manager for the second time on 26 January 1998. Relegation to the third tier was avoided on the last day of the season \u2013 by 1 point.\n\nPortsmouth's centenary season, [[1998\u201399 Portsmouth F.C. season|1998\u201399]], saw a financial crisis hit the club, and in December 1998 Portsmouth went into [[Administration (football)|financial administration]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16943651|title=Portsmouth enter administration & are docked 10 points|date=17 February 2012|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref> Serbian-born US businessman [[Milan Mandari\u0107]] saved the club with a takeover deal in May 1999, and the new chairman immediately started investing for the new 1999\u20132000 season.\n\nAlan Ball was sacked on 9 December 1999 during the [[1999\u20132000 Portsmouth F.C. season|1999\u20132000]] season with the club near the bottom of the table. [[Tony Pulis]] took over on 13 January 2000 and steered the club to safety at the end of the season.\n\nIn the [[2000\u201301 Portsmouth F.C. season|2000\u201301 season]], Pulis was put on leave and replaced by Portsmouth player, [[Steve Claridge]] in a player-manager role.  On 23 February 2001, [[Graham Rix]] took over from Claridge. Portsmouth escaped relegation on the last day of the 2000\u201301 season when they won their final game and [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] lost theirs, keeping Portsmouth up at their expense.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/3004911/Huddersfield-relegated-as-Palace-and-Portsmouth-win.html|title=Huddersfield relegated as Palace and Portsmouth win|date=6 May 2001|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref> During the summer break, former [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] manager [[Harry Redknapp]] was appointed director of football by Mandaric.\n\nA week before the new season began, 25-year-old Portsmouth goalkeeper [[Aaron Flahavan]] was killed in a car crash near Bournemouth on 5 August 2001. In a mark of respect, Portsmouth retired his number 1 shirt for the season. Portsmouth signed veteran Croatian playmaker [[Robert Prosine\u010dki#Portsmouth|Robert Prosine\u010dki]] on a one-year deal and [[Peter Crouch]] for the start of the [[2001\u201302 Portsmouth F.C. season|2001\u201302 season]]. Rix lost his job on 25 March 2002, with Harry Redknapp taking over. Former Portsmouth manager Jim Smith was asked to team up with Redknapp, and while he initially turned the offer down to remain as assistant at [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], he soon arrived at Portsmouth after a change of manager at Coventry saw almost all of the club's coaching staff being dismissed. Peter Crouch scored 19 goals for Portsmouth, but was sold to Aston Villa in March 2002 for \u00a35&nbsp;million.  Portsmouth ended the [[2001\u201302 Portsmouth F.C. season|2001\u201302 Division One season]] in 17th place and 4 points above relegation.\n\nIn the [[2002\u201303 Portsmouth F.C. season|2002\u201303 season]], Portsmouth led the First Division for most of the season, with [[Svetoslav Todorov]] scoring 26 league goals, which made him the First Division's top scorer at the end of the season. Portsmouth finished top as First Division champions on 27 April 2003, six points clear of second-placed Leicester City, gaining promotion (with a game to spare) to the FA Premier League, returning to the top tier of English football after an absence of fifteen seasons.<ref>{{cite news |title=Portsmouth clinch promotion and championship |url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/2003/0427/portsmouth.html |work=RT\u00c9 Sport |date= 27 April 2003 |accessdate=27 August 2007}}</ref> Portsmouth were awarded the Football League First Division Championship trophy for a third time, as the former Football League championship trophy had been demoted in status in 1992\u201393 (because of the creation of the FA Premier League) and had become the second tier trophy. Portsmouth goalkeeper [[Shaka Hislop]], midfielders Matthew Taylor and Paul Merson earned places in the 2002\u201303 Division One [[PFA Team of the Year (2000s)#First Division 4|PFA Team of the Year]] award.\n\n===2003\u20132010: FA Premier League===\nIn Portsmouth's Premiership debut season in 2003\u201304, the \"Harry & Jim\" partnership of Harry Redknapp and Jim Smith resulted in a 13th place final position at the end of the season.\n\nAlmost halfway through the following 2004\u201305 season in the Premiership, Harry Redknapp unexpectedly walked out on Portsmouth on 24 November 2004 after a row with chairman Milan Mandari\u0107 over the appointment of new Director of Football [[Velimir Zajec]] at the club. Shortly afterwards on 8 December 2004, Harry Redknapp was announced by Southampton F.C. chairman [[Rupert Lowe]] as their new manager, with Jim Smith as his assistant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/southampton/4077461.stm |title=Saints name Redknapp as boss |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 December 2004 |accessdate=6 July 2018}}</ref> Velimir Zajec then replaced Redknapp as Portsmouth manager, but in April 2005, Zajec was replaced by Frenchman [[Alain Perrin]].

Harry Redknapp then made a surprise return to manage Portsmouth again after leaving relegated Southampton. In January 2006, Portsmouth were sold by Milan Mandari\u0107 and bought by businessman [[Alexandre Gaydamak]]. New signings included a quartet from Tottenham Hotspur, then record signing [[Benjani Mwaruwari|Benjani]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentine international]] [[Andr\u00e9s D'Alessandro]] on loan from [[VfL Wolfsburg]]. The club survived their third season in the Premier League one place above the relegation zone in 17th position. With large amounts of money available for Redknapp to make record signings, the club finished the [[2006\u201307 Portsmouth F.C. season|2006\u201307 season]] in the top half of the table for the first time, in ninth position, only one point short of European qualification.\n\n[[File:The FA Cup Trophy in 2008.jpg|thumb|Portsmouth won the [[FA Cup]] for the second time in 2008]]\n[[File:Fullscore.JPG|thumb|The scoreboard at the end of the [[2008 FA Cup Final]], in which Portsmouth beat [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] 1\u20130]]\nThe following [[2007\u201308 Portsmouth F.C. season|2007\u201308 season]] saw Portsmouth finish eighth in the Premier League and reach the [[2008 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] for the first time since 1939.

On 19 August 2009, Portsmouth announced on their website that a rival consortium headed by current CEO [[Peter Storrie]] had also made a bid for the club; unknown at the time, this was backed by [[Ali al-Faraj]].

Club & Merchandising crest.]]\n\nAlthough Portsmouth F.C. were formed in 1898, the club did not have a club crest until one was introduced for the 1913\u201314 season. This would be the second season since Portsmouth's 1912 reformation, and their wearing of blue shirts for a second successive season. Their first season with a crest in 1913\u201314 would also become the last season before World War I began in 1914.\n\nThe official Coat of Arms of the [[Portsmouth|City of Portsmouth]] contains an eight pointed gold star and crescent moon on a blue shield, Portsmouth's adoption of the [[star and crescent]] is said to have come from when [[King Richard I]] (1157\u20131189), who granted the city \"a crescent of gold on a shade of azure, with a blazing star of eight points\" which he had taken from the [[Byzantine Emperor]]'s standard of Governor [[Isaac Komnenos of Cyprus|Isaac Komnenos]], after capturing [[Cyprus]].\n\nThe first 1913 Portsmouth F.C. crest was based on official symbols belonging to the town council of Portsmouth, which featured a golden eight-pointed star and a golden crescent moon.  The football club's first crest featured a horizontally elongated white crescent moon beneath a white five pointed star, with both symbols positioned in the centre of a blue four pointed shield. Portsmouth town council bestowed the privileged use (but not ownership) of their moon and star motifs to Portsmouth F.C., albeit with some colour and design changes.<ref name=\"historicalkits.co.uk\"/>\n\nThroughout their history Portsmouth F.C. have tried different variations of the crest before reverting to the basic gold star and crescent. After World War II, Portsmouth began using an eight-pointed star to match that used by the city of Portsmouth.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In the 1950s and 1960s, the traditional crest was emblazoned on the shirt in white rather than gold but this was due to white being a cheaper alternative to a more expensive gold coloured thread.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1989, Portsmouth scrapped the traditional crest and replaced it with an entirely new design. This crest showed a football in front of an [[anchor]] (representing the navy) and a [[sword]] (representing the army), with the whole design surrounded by an outer ring of ships rope. An alternative version included a circular version of the traditional star and crescent crest in place of the football.\n\nDuring 1989 and 1993, the rope and anchor crest was dropped replaced with a simpler eight pointed star and crescent moon on a long narrow shield. At the foot of the shield, a blue banner featured \"''Portsmouth Football Club''\" written within it in capital letters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Portsmouth/Portsmouth.htm|title=Portsmouth - Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1993-1997, the 1989-93 long narrow shield design was replaced by an embroidered badge of the city of Portsmouth Coat of Arms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Portsmouth/Portsmouth.htm|title=Portsmouth - Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://greatestkits.co.uk/products/1993-95-portsmouth-home-shirt-l|title=1993/95 Portsmouth Home Shirt (L)|website=Greatest Kits|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n\nThe 1993-97 city arms crest was replaced in 1997, with an eight pointed gold star and a golden crescent moon on a blue shield edged with a gold outer rim. At the foot of the shield, a gold ribbon with \"''Portsmouth F.C.''\" written in blue gothic lettering completed the new design.  This new crest coincided with the rebuilding and reopening of the new Fratton End and tjhe clubs centennial anniversary in the 1997\u201398 season\n\nIn 2007, an additional \"Since 1898\" was added to the 1997 crest ribbon underneath the shield in time for the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nOn 6 May 2008, a month after their 110th Anniversary, Portsmouth revealed a new crest with a very three dimensional look, the tradition curved shield with \"three points\" at the top of the shield were replaced with two straightened angles, with \"Portsmouth F.C.\" written above the star on the shield.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ffcw001.azureedge.net/-/media/team/england/crest/portsmouth.png?w=600&h=600|title=Portsmouth Crest|last=|first=|date=|website=ffcw001.azureedge.net|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref> The traditional elongated crescent moon was replaced with a new circular one, which closely resembled that on the city's Coat of Arms. The new crest had its debut in the 2008 FA Cup Final, in which Portsmouth also wore a new 110th Anniversary all-blue commemorative home strip.\n\nAs part of the World War I Centennial Commemorations in the 2014\u201315 season, the club opted to replace the 2008 crest on the home kit with one almost identical to that used in 1913\u201314. This was a more traditional-looking club crest featuring the traditional three points at the top of a slightly rounded shield but with a silver five-pointed star inside instead of the usual eight-pointed one. The moon featured on the crest was also silver, both appearing on a blue background.\n\nIn June 2015, following positive feedback from supporters, Portsmouth F.C. decided to revert the official club crest back to a familiar and traditional design, over the one introduced in 2008, which was often criticised by Pompey fans for looking too similar to Arsenal F.C.'s updated modern era crest. Portsmouth's new 2015 crest was virtually identical in design to that which has been used for the majority of the club's history. The famous \"star and moon\", both silver-white on a blue background, have a slight three-dimensional appearance. The star was restored back to the familiar eight pointed design, instead of the five pointed version used in the 1913 and 2014 crests. The crest's shield retains the three points at the top but is in a more traditional shape. No lettering or numbering features on the new club crest, just like that which was used on home shirts the previous 2014\u201315 season.\n\nOn 4 May 2017 at [[Portsmouth Guildhall]], The Tornante Company, owned by Michael Eisner met the Pompey Supporters Trust (PST), the fan-based owners of Portsmouth, to discuss a potential takeover of the football club. During the meeting, the prospective new owners identified a long overlooked ownership and copyright issue concerning the traditional Portsmouth crest \u2013 Portsmouth Football Club did not legally \"own\" the symbols on the crest, which had actually only been \"on loan\" to the club from Portsmouth City Council since 1913.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0n7DZY79jTY |publisher=The Tornante Company |via=YouTube.com |title=Michael Eisner's Q&A Session with Portsmouth Supporters Trust |date=13 May 2017 |accessdate=8 August 2018 }}</ref>\n\nThe Tornante Company completed their purchase of Portsmouth on 3 August 2017 after a majority vote from members of the Pompey Supporters Trust to sell.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} To rectify the copyright and commercial marketing issues with the current 2015 crest, the decision was taken by the new owners to design and copyright a brand new crest for the future.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Portsmouth's fans were consulted by traditional and digital media during late 2017 and early 2018 with various designs for new crests. Most of the designs were minor tweaks and adjustments of the existing 2015 crest, just enough to make a new crest design different from that of Portsmouth City Council's coat of Arms.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nOn 15 March 2018, two newly redesigned club crests were finally revealed. Both new crests featured a new eight pointed nautical compass star and the addition of an \"1898\" date, the founding year of the football club, beneath the crescent moon. The new crests are to be copyrighted and introduced for the new 2018\u201319 season. The first new crest, similar to previous crests, is intended for players shirts. The second crest, surrounded by a blue ring with \"Portsmouth Football Club\" written in it, will be used for letterheads, merchandise and other commercial purposes.<ref name=\"portsmouthfc.co.uk\"/>\n\n==Home colours==\n{|\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = _claretborder|\n pattern_b = _Roma2|\n pattern_ra = _claretborder|\n pattern_sh = |\n pattern_so = |\n leftarm = ff9999|\n body = ff9999|\n rightarm = ff9999|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n socks = 000000|\n title = 1899\u20131909\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = |\n pattern_b = _collar|\n pattern_ra = |\n leftarm = FFFFFF|\n body         = FFFFFF|\n rightarm = FFFFFF|\n shorts = 003366|\n socks = 003366|\n title = 1909\u20131912\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = |\n pattern_b = _collarwhite|\n pattern_ra = |\n leftarm = 0066FF|\n body         = 0066FF|\n rightarm = 0066FF|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n pattern_so = _2 white stripes|\n socks = 000000|\n title = 1912\u20131933\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = |\n pattern_b = _collarwhite|\n pattern_ra = |\n leftarm = 0000FF|\n body         = 0000FF|\n rightarm = 0000FF|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n pattern_so = _2 white stripes|\n socks = 000000|\n title = 1933\u20131947\n}}\n|}\n\nIn their first 1899\u20131900 season in the Southern League Division One, Portsmouth's first home colours were salmon pink shirts with maroon collars and cuffs, matched with white shorts and black socks.  The pink shirts gave the early Portsmouth F.C. the alternative second nickname of 'The Shrimps'. The collars and cuffs were the same colour as the Corporation of Portsmouth's public trams, which were painted maroon at the time.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Portsmouth/Portsmouth.htm |title=Portsmouth |publisher=Historical Football Kits |website=historicalkits.co.uk |accessdate=8 August 2018 }}</ref> These colours lasted until the end of the 1908\u201309 season. 'The Shrimps' nickname then also declined from common usage.\n\nAt the start of the 1909\u201310 season, Portsmouth changed to white shirts with navy blue shorts and navy blue socks. The next season, Portsmouth ended the poor 1910\u201311 season in bottom place and Portsmouth were relegated to Southern League Division Two. Following relegation, a financial crisis, fund raising, promotion in early 1912 and then another financial crisis, the original Portsmouth company that had been formed in 1898 was 'wound up'. A new limited company was formed on 27 July 1912 as Portsmouth F.C.'s parent company.\n\nFor the start of the 1912\u201313 Southern League Division One season, Portsmouth changed their home colours to azure blue shirts, white shorts and black socks. This was to become Portsmouth's home kit colour combination up until the start of the 1933\u201334 season, when the shirts were changed to a royal blue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Portsmouth/Portsmouth.htm|title=Portsmouth - Historical Football Kits|website=www.historicalkits.co.uk}}</ref> These colours remained until the start of the 1947\u201348 season, when the black socks were changed to red; this coinciding with the club's most successful period and has remained the favoured colours for the majority of the time since.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pompey's Home Kits Through The Ages |url=http://www.pompeyweb.co.uk/kits.htm |publisher=PompeyWeb |accessdate=27 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603114751/http://www.pompeyweb.co.uk/kits.htm |archivedate=3 June 2008}}</ref> Portsmouth F.C. changed their colour combination several times during the 1966\u20131976 period, before reverting to the now tradition post-war blue shirts, white shorts and red stockings in 1976.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> For the club's 110th anniversary season in 2008\u201309, Portsmouth played in an all blue home kit, which debuted in the previous season's successful 2008 FA Cup Final win.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Since the 2009\u201310 season, Portsmouth reverted to the now traditional blue-white-red home kit.\n\n===Red socks memorial===\n{|\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = |\n pattern_b = _collarwhite|\n pattern_ra = |\n leftarm = 0000FF|\n body         = 0000FF|\n rightarm = 0000FF|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n socks = FF0000|\n title = 1947\u20131966\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = _whiteborder|\n pattern_b = _whitecollar|\n pattern_ra = _whiteborder|\n leftarm = 0000FF|\n body         = 0000FF|\n rightarm = 0000FF|\n shorts = 0000FF|\n pattern_so = _whitehorizontal|\n socks = 0000FF|\n title = 1966\u20131972\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = _whiteborder|\n pattern_b = _whitecollar|\n pattern_ra = _whiteborder|\n leftarm = 0000FF|\n body         = 0000FF|\n rightarm = 0000FF|\n pattern_sh = _blue stripes|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n pattern_so = _whitehorizontal|\n socks = 0000FF|\n title = 1972\u20131973\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = _blueborder|\n pattern_b = _pfcaway10|\n pattern_ra = _blueborder|\n leftarm = FFFFFF|\n body = |\n rightarm = FFFFFF|\n shorts = 0000FF|\n pattern_so = _bluehorizontal|\n socks = FFFFFF|\n title = 1973\u20131976\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = |\n pattern_b = _vneckwhite|\n pattern_ra = |\n leftarm = 0000FF|\n body         = 0000FF|\n rightarm = 0000FF|\n shorts = FFFFFF|\n socks = FF0000|\n title = 1976\u20132008\n}}\n|{{Football kit |\n pattern_la = _whiteline|\n pattern_b  = _pfcccc|\n pattern_ra = _whiteline|\n leftarm    = 0000FF|\n body       = 0000FF|\n rightarm   = 0000FF|\n shorts     = 0000FF|\n socks      = 0000FF|\n title      = 2008\u20132009\n}}\n|}\nPortsmouth had predominantly worn black socks since their first match in 1899 up until the end of the post-World War II 1946\u201347 FA Cup season \u2013 in which the Football League had not yet resumed.\n\nDuring the Second World War and post-war periods, the British Army's [[Bernard Montgomery|Field Marshal Sir Bernard 'Monty' Montgomery]] had been based at [[Southwick House]], 5 miles to the north of Portsmouth. Montgomery regularly attended war-time League South matches at Fratton Park, becoming the honorary President of Portsmouth Football Club. Following the suggestion by Montgomery, red socks were introduced by the club as a memorial to soldiers lost in wartime as red is the traditional colour of the British Army and also the colour of the [[Remembrance poppy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/news/2013/may/crest-of-a-wave/ |title=Crest Of A Wave |publisher=Portsmouth Football Club |date=22 May 2013 |accessdate=8 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith the resumption of a full professional Football League season in England in 1947\u201348, Portsmouth changed their socks from the usual black to red for the start of the 1947\u201348 season.

An exact origin for the ''Pompey'' nickname has never formally been identified by historians, as many variations, sources and interpretations of the ''Pompey'' nickname exist.\n\nOne possible theory of the Pompey nickname is the [[Contraction (grammar)|grammatical contraction]] of the [[Old Portsmouth]] location name '''[[Portsmouth Point]]''' to the shorter '''Po'm. P.''' ('''Po''''''rts'''''m.'''''outh'' '''P.'''''oint'') which supposedly saved time and space when handwritten into a ship's logbook. Other theories include Royal Navy romanticism of the Roman character '''[[Pompey]]''' from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', used by officers to inspire the ship's company.\n\nAnother ''Pompey'' nickname theory, based on actual historic events, originates from {{HMS|Pompee|1793|6}}, originally a newly built [[T\u00e9m\u00e9raire-class ship of the line|T\u00e9m\u00e9raire class]] French frigate named ''La Pomp\u00e9e'' that was surrendered by French Royalists during the [[French Revolution]] to their British allies during the [[Siege of Toulon]] in 1793. The ship ''La Pomp\u00e9e'' eventually arrived at [[Spithead]] in 1794 and was recommissioned into the Royal Navy as ''HMS Pomp\u00e9e''.  In 1797, HMS ''Pomp\u00e9e'' was one of sixteen ships involved in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies]] of 1797. During her later career, HMS ''Pomp\u00e9e'' also served as Portsmouth's guard ship and ended her career in the early nineteenth century anchored in [[Portsmouth Harbour]] as the chief prison ship ''Pompee''. ''Pompee'' was also used as prison ship for French prisoners captured during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u20131815). The harsh treatment received aboard ''Pompee'' gained a national notoriety with the criminal classes of England, the name ''Pompey'' itself became a northern England slang word for prison.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-2010,00.html?gusrc=gpd |title=Why is Portsmouth called Pompey? |work=The Guardian |author=David Francis |accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref> The ''Pompee'' became a familiar local landmark and gained a common association with the Royal Navy and the civilian Portsmouth population, who both then began associating ''Pompee'' with Portsmouth. ''Pompee'' was finally taken away to be broken up in [[Woolwich]] in 1817, but her name lived on in Portsmouth folklore, anglicised to \"''Pompey''\" over time.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe present Portsmouth Football Club were not the first football club in the city of Portsmouth to be known as ''Pompey''. In the 1890s, an amateur Portsmouth-based British Army team, '''Royal Artillery (Portsmouth) F.C.''' were reported in newspapers with the ''Pompey'' nickname, as well as also being known as ''The Gunners''.  Royal Artillery Portsmouth's supporters were also responsible for creating [[Portsmouth F.C.#'The Pompey Chimes'|\"The Town Hall Chimes\"]] chant, which later became known as ''\"The Pompey Chimes\"'' chant in the twentieth century.  The chant originally began at Royal Artillery Portsmouth's home football ground at Burnaby Road, Portsmouth ([[United Services Recreation Ground]]) and was within easy earshot of the nearby Portsmouth Town Hall (now called [[Portsmouth Guildhall]]) clock bells, which had inspired the chant.\n\nRoyal Artillery (Portsmouth) F.C. were disqualified for \"professionalism\" after an 1898\u201399 FA Amateur Cup match.  Royal Artillery were also forced to field only a team of amateur reserve players, thus weakening the remaining Royal Artillery team for the remainder of the 1898\u201399 Southern Football League season. Royal Artillery finished bottom of the [[1898\u201399 Southern Football League#Division One|table]], relegated after a relegation match with Cowes F.C. and were eventually disbanded. The \"Pompey\" nickname, the \"Town Hall Chimes\" chant, some of the Royal Artillery players and their supporters then migrated to a newly formed football club, named Portsmouth F.C., earlier formed on 5 April 1898.<ref name=\"portsmouth.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/heritage/history-of-the-chimes-1-1299340|title=History of the chimes|website=Portsmouth.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nPortsmouth F.C., as the \"new\" Pompey, played their first Southern Football League match away to Chatham Town on Saturday 2 September 1899, winning 0\u20131. Their first home match at Fratton Park stadium took place only four days later on Wednesday 6 September 1899, a friendly match against Southampton F.C., which Portsmouth won 2\u20130. During the first early seasons of Portsmouth F.C., the football team wore salmon pink shirts with maroon collars and cuffs, white shorts and black socks. The pink shirts gave rise to an alternative nickname, ''''The Shrimps''''. 'The Shrimps' went out of common usage after 1909 when Portsmouth F.C. began playing in white shirts, navy blue shorts and navy blue stockings. After the original 1898 founding company was replaced in 1912, Portsmouth began playing in their now familiar blue shirts in the 1912\u201313 season.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Stadium==\n[[File:Fratton Park entrance.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The entrance to Fratton Park's South Stand, with its mock Tudor facade]]\n{{main|Fratton Park}}\nPortsmouth F.C. play their home games at Fratton Park, in the district of [[Milton, Portsmouth]]. The stadium has been home to the club throughout its entire history since the club formed in 1898. Fratton Park is affectionately nicknamed \"The Old Girl\" by Portsmouth F.C. supporters.\n\nPlans for relocation were first mooted in the early 1990s, but due to various objections and financial obstacles, the club has continued to play at Fratton Park. Most recently, plans for relocation have included new stadia on a site offered by the [[Royal Navy]] at [[Horsea Island]], between Stamshaw and Port Solent, and on reclaimed land in Portsmouth Harbour beside the existing naval base. The former was mooted as a possible [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] venue as part of England's bid process. However, the cost to the city's taxpayers to join the bid was deemed too great a risk to take.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/8378313.stm |title=Football \u2013 Portsmouth pulls out of 2018 bid |publisher=BBC News |date=25 November 2009 |accessdate=2 December 2013}}</ref> A third, oft returned-to option, is to build a new stadium on the site of the existing Fratton Park.\n\nFollowing Portsmouth F.C.'s financial troubles, subsequent relegation from the Premier League, and the failure of the England 2018 bid, as of May 2017 there are no active plans for a new club stadium.\n\n==Supporters and rivalries==\n{{main|South Coast derby}}\n[[File:Pompeywembley.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Portsmouth fans at Wembley Stadium for the 2007\u201308 FA Cup semi-final with West Bromwich Albion]]\nPortsmouth's main rivals are [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], who are 19.8 miles (31.8&nbsp;km) away, with the \"border\" between the two located in the Hampshire village of [[Titchfield]].  The [[South Coast Derby]] is one of the less frequently played rivalries within English football due to the clubs being in different divisions however this usually adds to the ferocity of the fixture.\n\nPrior to the mid/late 1960s, rivalry between Portsmouth and Southampton was largely non-existent, as a consequence of their disparity in league status. This [[Local derby|derby match]] has been sporadic. Since 1977, the teams have only played league games against each other in four seasons (1987\u201388, 2003\u201304, 2004\u201305 and 2011\u201312). Including Southern League games, there have been 64 league games between the clubs, but they have also met five times in the FA Cup, Portsmouth beating their rivals 4\u20131 at [[St Mary's Stadium]] in their last meeting in 2010, and twice in the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] \u2013 with Southampton winning both times.\n\nMany Portsmouth supporters commonly use the derogatory nickname '''''Scummer''''' (plural: '''''Scummers''''') to describe Southampton fans, or collectively '''''Scum''''' to also include their football club, and indeed the city of Southampton itself.\n* A disproven common origin theory dating from the late twentieth century suggested that the ''Scum'' nickname was an acronym of ''Southampton Company of Union Men'', linked to a vague recollection of an unspecified and unsourced past dockers strike, in which Southampton-based dockers supposedly crossed Portsmouth dockyard picket lines when brought in as [[Strikebreaker|scab labour]] to work inside the naval base. This theory is almost certainly an urban myth, as Royal Navy dockers are not permitted to go on strike.\n* Victorian era dockers employed in the supposedly higher status [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth Royal Dockyard]], looked down in disdain upon the civilian merchant port dockers at [[Port of Southampton|Southampton Docks]] and nicknamed them ''Scum'', as scum, flotsam and jetsam are useless residue found floating on, or nearby water.\n* According to the Oxford English Dictionary, ''Scummers'' was a derogatory name with naval origins for pirates or buccaneers, and was first recorded in use in 1585.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/scummer |title=scummer |work=English Oxford Living Dictionaries |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=24 January 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"theguardian.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/jan/23/newsstory.sport8 |title=Scummers v Skates |work=The Guardian |author=Kevin Mitchell |date=23 January 2005 |accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Portsmouth supporters have had the equally derogatory nickname '''''Skate''''' bestowed upon them by Southampton fans as a rebuttal to ''Scummer'' since the 1987\u201388 Division One season. This was unofficially chosen by Southampton fans from a list of insults compiled by a Southampton-based supporters fanzine called ''The Ugly Inside'' in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/southampton/news/48841/ |title=Why Bournemouth Will Never Be Saints Rivals ! |work=FansNetwork |date=17 October 2018 |accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref> Ironically, the chosen nickname ''Skate'' was actually stolen from the civilian population of Portsmouth, who had long used ''Skate'' as a derogatory insult or nickname for sailors based in Portsmouth Dockyard and other Royal Navy establishments. According to legend and folklore, Royal Navy matelots on long sea voyages were regularly denied female company, and would keep a [[Skate (fish)|skate]] (fish species) in their hammock or bunkside, as the mouth of the skate was supposedly used as a substitute vagina. Sailors ashore in Royal Navy uniform seeking the services of Portsmouth's prostitutes would often be refused service and met with a ''\"I ain't no skate bait, mate!\"'' rebuttal.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/>\n\nAnother rivalry over the years, colloquially known as the \"Dockyard Derby\", is with [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/plymouth_argyle/7201902.stm|title=Naval support for Dockyard Derby|date=22 January 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=23 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2289954/Tynan-Plymouth-can-cause-derby-upset.html|title=Tynan: Plymouth can cause derby upset|date=25 January 2008|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref> This rivalry is also known as the Battle of the Ports.<ref name=harvey>{{cite book |title=Rivals: The Off-Beat Guide to the 92 League Clubs |last1=Harvey |first1=Geoff |last2=Strowger |first2=Vanessa |year=2004 |publisher=Aesculus Press Ltd |location=Swadlincote, Derbyshire |isbn=1-904328-13-X |page=133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mG7XLIPEHvAC&pg=PT111&dq=%22battle+of+the+ports%22+football |accessdate=2 March 2012}}</ref> In recent seasons the club has also developed a minor rivalry with [[Sunderland AFC|Sunderland]], mainly stemming from the clubs meeting each other 5 times in the 18/19 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sunderland-portsmouth-story-so-far-16284128|title=Sunderland vs Portsmouth: A story of red cards, penalties and a simmering rivalry|first=Sean|last=Tighe|date=16 May 2019|website=nechronicle}}</ref>\n\nLesser rivalries exist with fellow South Coast clubs [[A.F.C.

Football referees would use the Town Hall's clock bells as a reference to when the football match should end at 4&nbsp;pm. Just before 4&nbsp;pm the crowd of supporters would slowly lilt in unison with the Town Hall's chimes on the hour to encourage the referee to blow the whistle to signify full-time.

After their first interaction, Columbus described the Ta\u00ednos as a physically tall, well-proportioned people, with a noble and kind personality.\n\nIn [[Christopher Columbus's journal|his diary]], Columbus wrote:\n{{quote|They traded with us and gave us everything they had, with good will&nbsp;... they took great delight in pleasing us&nbsp;...

The word was still in use in England in the 1840s, when it appeared as a black market occupation.

During the medieval period, the term, huckster, came to refer to market-based food vendors while peddlers referred to itinerant vendors of a wide range of merchandise. Hucksters were often women, who dealt in low-priced goods such as meat, poultry, dairy, bread and baked goods including pies and pastries. They sourced raw materials from their own holdings or purchased goods from other sellers, and carried their products to the market place in baskets or on their heads. These women either lived in the market town, or travelled into the market place from the surrounding area. Hucksters were at the bottom of the market hierarchy, both in terms of wealth and status since they made only small returns. <ref>Davis, J., ''Medieval Market Morality: Life, Law and Ethics in the English Marketplace, 1200-1500,'' Cambridge University Press, 2012, pp 7-8</ref>\n\nLuca Clerici has made a detailed study of Vicenza\u2019s food market during the sixteenth century. He found that there were many different types of reseller operating out of the markets. For example, in the dairy trade, cheese and butter was sold by the members of two craft guilds (i.e., cheesemongers who were shopkeepers) and that of the so-called \u2018resellers\u2019 (hucksters selling a wide range of foodstuffs), and by other sellers who were not enrolled in any guild.  Cheesemongers\u2019 shops were situated at the town hall and were very lucrative. Resellers and peddlers increased the number of sellers, thus increasing competition, to the benefit of consumers. Direct sellers, who brought produce from the surrounding countryside, sold their wares through the central market place and priced their goods at considerably lower rates than cheesemongers.<ref>Clerici, L., \"Le prix du bien commun.

Schmidt]], the author of ''[[Lizzie Bright and the Buckminster Boy]].'' The novel is set in suburban [[Long Island]] during the 1967\u201368 school year. The [[Vietnam War]] is an important backdrop for the novel. It was given a [[Newbery Honor]] medal in 2008, and was also nominated for the [[Rebecca Caudill Young Reader's Book Award]] in 2010. But toads,beetles,bats. If you can't figure that out for yourself, then a southwest blow on ye and blister you all o'er.\n\n==Synopsis==\nHolling Hoodhood is a seventh grader during the 1967-1968 school year. In his school, the student body is largely divided between Catholics and Jews, and every Wednesday both groups go to their separate churches for religious classes. Holling, a Presbyterian, has no religious class to attend, therefore he is forced to remain at class with his teacher, Mrs. Baker.\n\nHolling is convinced that Mrs. Baker resents him for this. This suspicion is compounded when she begins having him read Shakespeare. As he begins to enjoy the plays, though, he also begins to understand Mrs. Baker, whose husband, he learns, is stationed in Vietnam.\n\nThe story's main focus is on Holling's struggle to get out from his overbearing father's shadow. Mr. Hoodhood is an ambitious, social climbing, and at times, the cutthroat architect who is determined that Holling take over the business when he retires. In fact, Mr. Hoodhood believes that nothing is more important than their family business and ensuring that it flourishes.  Because of this, all of the Hoodhoods must be on their best behavior at all times.  Whenever Holling brings up a particular person, his father breaks down who the person is, as well as their status; if they're someone who owns a business, Mr. Hoodhood demands Holling to be respectful at all times.  This causes a strained relationship between Holling and his father.  Holling ultimately finds an ally in his older sister, Heather, and eventually comes to understand that Mrs. Baker is also trying to help him learn to be his own person.\n\nOther subplots in the story include: Holling entering track and field; running the big race for track; going on his first date with classmate Meryl Lee, whose father is of the other architecture firm in town, Kowalski and Associates; his sister Heather running away to California with her boyfriend; and the ever-present shadow of the Vietnam War \u2014 as well as other historical events, such as the shootings of [[Robert F. Kennedy]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]. In addition, television news anchorman [[Walter Cronkite]] is mentioned throughout the novel, as an important presence while delivering the news. Cronkite is presented as the voice of the people, with the ability to sway Americans to a particular side.\n\nThe plot follows a steady, progression-focused format, lacking any clear climax. Instead, it simply follows Holling as he struggles through school, forms friends out of supposed enemies, and tries to grow up.\n\n==Publication history==\n* {{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/wednesdaywars00schm |title=The Wednesday Wars |author=Schmidt, Gary D. |author-link=Gary D.

Pautova also broke the world record in the T13 5000m event in 2003.\n\n==Career history==\nPautova, who is visually impaired, first took to athletics while she attended a specialised boarding school in [[Armavir, Russia]].<ref name=\"IPC profile\">{{cite web|url=http://ipc.infostradasports.com/asp/lib/theasp.asp?pageid=8937&sportid=-1&personid=687902&refreshauto=1 |title=Pautova, Elena |accessdate=9 August 2013 |publisher=ipc.infostradasports.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061640/http://ipc.infostradasports.com/asp/lib/theasp.asp?pageid=8937&sportid=-1&personid=687902&refreshauto=1 |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}</ref> She began competing competitively whilst still a teenager, and she competed in both middle and long distance events. At the age of 17 she entered an international meet in Quebec, Canada and ran in a T13 5000m contest. There she posted an officially recognized time of 17:50.45, a new world record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/sdms/web/at/record.pdf.at.php?xml=0&rct=RCTWR&spec=out&gen=&evt=AT050|title=IPC Athletics World Records|accessdate=9 August 2013|page=2|publisher=paralympic.org}}</ref> Due to the rarity of official T13 5000m races at major competitions, Pautova's record, as of 2013, still stands. Pautova then switched to middle-distance events, and at the age of 18 she was selected for her first [[Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]], chosen to represent Russia at the [[2004 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Athens]]. It was an extremely successful competition for Pautova, winning the gold medal in the T12 1500m and a bronze medal in the T12 800m.\n\nIn 2006, she travelled to Assen where she took part in the [[2006 IPC Athletics World Championships|Athletics World Championships]]. There she entered her favoured two events the 800, and 1,500m, and finished with an identical result to Athens; a gold in the 1,500m and bronze in the 800m. She returned to the Paralympics in [[2008 Summer Paralympics|2008]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]], winning two more bronze medals in the T13 1500m and the joint classified T12/13 800m.\n\nIn 2011, she retained her World title in the 1,500m, successfully defending it at the [[2011 IPC Athletics World Championships]] in Christchurch, New Zealand. Then in the run-up to the 2012 London Paralympics, she took the gold, again in the 1,500m, at the [[2012 IPC Athletics European Championships|2012 European Championships]] in [[Stadskanaal]].

She is a two times Paralympic gold medalist and three times World Championship gold medalist in the 1500m race. Pautova also broke the world record in the T13 5000m event in 2003.\n\n==Career history==\nPautova, who is visually impaired, first took to athletics while she attended a specialised boarding school in [[Armavir, Russia]].<ref name=\"IPC profile\">{{cite web|url=http://ipc.infostradasports.com/asp/lib/theasp.asp?pageid=8937&sportid=-1&personid=687902&refreshauto=1 |title=Pautova, Elena |accessdate=9 August 2013 |publisher=ipc.infostradasports.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061640/http://ipc.infostradasports.com/asp/lib/theasp.asp?pageid=8937&sportid=-1&personid=687902&refreshauto=1 |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}</ref> She began competing competitively whilst still a teenager, and she competed in both middle and long distance events. At the age of 17 she entered an international meet in Quebec, Canada and ran in a T13 5000m contest. There she posted an officially recognized time of 17:50.45, a new world record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paralympic.org/sdms/web/at/record.pdf.at.php?xml=0&rct=RCTWR&spec=out&gen=&evt=AT050|title=IPC Athletics World Records|accessdate=9 August 2013|page=2|publisher=paralympic.org}}</ref> Due to the rarity of official T13 5000m races at major competitions, Pautova's record, as of 2013, still stands. Pautova then switched to middle-distance events, and at the age of 18 she was selected for her first [[Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]], chosen to represent Russia at the [[2004 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Athens]]. It was an extremely successful competition for Pautova, winning the gold medal in the T12 1500m and a bronze medal in the T12 800m.\n\nIn 2006, she travelled to Assen where she took part in the [[2006 IPC Athletics World Championships|Athletics World Championships]]. There she entered her favoured two events the 800, and 1,500m, and finished with an identical result to Athens; a gold in the 1,500m and bronze in the 800m. She returned to the Paralympics in [[2008 Summer Paralympics|2008]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]], winning two more bronze medals in the T13 1500m and the joint classified T12/13 800m.\n\nIn 2011, she retained her World title in the 1,500m, successfully defending it at the [[2011 IPC Athletics World Championships]] in Christchurch, New Zealand. Then in the run-up to the 2012 London Paralympics, she took the gold, again in the 1,500m, at the [[2012 IPC Athletics European Championships|2012 European Championships]] in [[Stadskanaal]]. In London she posted a season's best of 4:37.65 to beat her nearest rival, Spain's [[Elena Congost]], by almost seven seconds to take her second Paralympic gold medal. After her triumph in London, Pautova was awarded the [[Order of Honour (Russian Federation)|Order of Honour]], and received her medal form President [[Vladimir Putin]] at a ceremony held in the Kremlin.<ref name=\"IPC profile\"/>\n\nIn 2013 Pautova secured a third World gold title in the 1,500m with a win at the  [[2013 IPC Athletics World Championships]] in Lyon, making her the undefeated World champion at that distance for eight years.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IPC athlete|687902}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pautova, Elena}}\n[[Category:Paralympic athletes of Russia]]\n[[Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2004 Summer Paralympics]]\n[[Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2008 Summer Paralympics]]\n[[Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2012 Summer Paralympics]]\n[[Category:Paralympic gold medalists for Russia]]\n[[Category:Paralympic bronze medalists for Russia]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Russian female middle-distance runners]]\n[[Category:World record holders in Paralympic athletics]]\n[[Category:1986 births]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Honour (Russia)]]\n[[Category:Medalists at the 2004 Summer Paralympics]]\n[[Category:Medalists at the 2008 Summer Paralympics]]\n[[Category:Medalists at the 2012 Summer Paralympics]]\n", "name_user": "Zyxw", "label": "safe", "comment": "update IPC external link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Pautova"}
