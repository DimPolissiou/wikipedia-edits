He is one of four individuals to have attained the rank of [[Fleet admiral (United States)|fleet admiral]] of the United States Navy, the others being [[Ernest King]], [[William D. Leahy|William Leahy]], and [[Chester W. Nimitz]].\n\nBorn in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], Halsey graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1904. He served in the [[Great White Fleet]] and, during [[World War I]], commanded the [[destroyer]] {{USS|Shaw|DD-68|6}}. He took command of the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}} in 1935 after completing a course in naval aviation, and was promoted to the rank of rear admiral in 1938. At the start of the [[Pacific War|War in the Pacific]] (1941\u20131945), Halsey commanded the task force centered on the carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} in a series of raids against [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]-held targets. \n\nHalsey was made commander, [[South Pacific Area]], and led the Allied forces over the course of the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Battle for Guadalcanal]] (1942\u201343) and the [[Solomon Islands campaign|fighting up the Solomon chain]] (1942\u201345).<ref name=\"Morison p. 183\">Morison, ''The Struggle for Guadalcanal'', p. 183.</ref>  In 1943 he was made commander of the [[United States Third Fleet|Third Fleet]], the post he held through the rest of the war.<ref name=\"Potter p. 112\">Potter, p.&nbsp;112.</ref> He took part in the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Battle for Leyte Gulf]], the largest naval battle of the Second World War and, by some criteria, the [[largest naval battle in history]]. He was promoted to fleet admiral in December 1945 and retired from active service in March 1947.\n\n==Early years==\nHalsey was born in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], on October 30, 1882, the son of [[United States Navy]] Captain [[William F. Halsey Sr.]]  \n\nHalsey was of [[English American|English]] ancestry, all of his ancestors came to America from England and all of them emigrated from [[England]] to [[New England]] in the early 1600s.  He felt a \"kinship\" with his ancestors, including Captain John Halsey of colonial Massachusetts who served in the British Royal Navy in [[Queen Anne's War]] from 1702 to 1713 where he raided French shipping.<ref>Admiral \"Bull\" Halsey: The Life and Wars of the Navy's Most Controversial Commander by John Wukovits pg. 1-2</ref><ref>Admiral Bill Halsey: A Naval Life by Thomas Alexander Hughes, pg. 16</ref> Through his father he was a descendant of Senator [[Rufus King]], who was an American lawyer, politician, diplomat, and [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]].

He chose Virginia because his best friend, Karl Osterhause, was there. While there, Halsey joined the [[Delta Psi]] fraternity and was also a member of the secretive [[Seven Society]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Johnson |first=Bill |title=Seven Society's Secret Still Secret |newspaper=Washington Post |page=C8 |date=1965-02-15}}</ref> After his first year, Halsey received his appointment to the [[United States Naval Academy|United States Naval Academy at Annapolis]], and entered the Academy in the fall of 1900. While attending the academy he [[Varsity letter|lettered]] in football as a fullback and earned several [[Navy Midshipmen|athletic]] honors. Halsey graduated from the Naval Academy on February 2, 1904.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wukovits|first=John |title = Admiral \"Bull Halsey\" |year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn = 978-0-230-60284-7 |page=9 }}</ref> \n\nFollowing graduation he spent his early service years in [[battleship]]s, and sailed with the main battle fleet aboard the battleship {{USS|Kansas|BB-21|6}} as [[Theodore Roosevelt|Roosevelt's]] [[Great White Fleet]] [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the globe from 1907 to 1909. Halsey was on the bridge of the battleship {{USS|Missouri|BB-11|6}} on April 13, 1904, when a flareback from the port gun in her after turret ignited a powder charge and set off two others. No explosion occurred, but the rapid burning of the powder burnt and suffocated to death 31 officers and enlisted sailors. This resulted in Halsey dreading the 13th of every month, especially when it fell on a Friday.<ref>Borneman, p.&nbsp;47.</ref>\n\nAfter his service on ''Missouri'', Halsey served aboard torpedo boats, beginning with {{USS|Du Pont|TB-7|6}} in 1909. Halsey was one of the few officers who was promoted directly from [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]] to full lieutenant, skipping the rank of [[Lieutenant, junior grade|lieutenant (junior grade)]].<ref name=\"wukovits2010\">{{cite book|title=Admiral \"Bull\" Halsey: The Life and Wars of the Navy's Most Controversial Commander|last=Wukovits|first=John|year=2010|isbn=978-0-230-60284-7}}</ref> Torpedoes and torpedo boats became specialties of his, and he commanded the First Group of the Atlantic Fleet's Torpedo Flotilla in 1912 through 1913. Halsey commanded a number of torpedo boats and [[destroyer]]s during the 1910s and 1920s. At that time, the destroyer and the torpedo boat, though extremely hazardous delivery methods, were the most effective way to bring the torpedo into combat against capital ships. Then-[[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Halsey's World War I service, including command of {{USS|Shaw|DD-68|6}} in 1918, earned him the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]].\n\n== Interwar years ==\nIn October 1922, he was the [[Naval Attach\u00e9|naval attach\u00e9]] at the American Embassy in [[Berlin]], Germany. One year later, he was given additional duty as naval attach\u00e9 at the American Embassies in [[Oslo|Christiania]], Norway; [[Copenhagen]], Denmark; and [[Stockholm]], Sweden. He then returned to sea duty, again in destroyers in European waters, in command of {{USS|Dale|DD-290|6}} and {{USS|Osborne|DD-295|6}}. Upon his return to the U.S. in 1927, he served one year as executive officer of the battleship {{USS|Wyoming|BB-32|6}}, and then for three years in command of {{USS|Reina Mercedes|IX-25|6}}, the station ship at the Naval Academy. Then-[[Captain (naval)|Captain]] Halsey continued his destroyer duty on his next two-year stint at sea, starting in 1930 as the Commander of Destroyer Division Three of the Scouting Force, before returning to study at the [[Naval War College]] in Newport, Rhode Island.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq36-5.htm |title = Fleet Admiral William Frederick Halsey Jr. |publisher=[[Naval Historical Center]] }}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, the chief of the [[Bureau of Aeronautics]], Navy Admiral [[Ernest King]], offered Halsey command of the aircraft carrier {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}}, subject to completion of the course of an air observer. Halsey elected to enroll as a cadet for the full 12-week [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviator]] course rather than the simpler Naval Aviation Observer program. \"I thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than to just sit back and be at the mercy of the pilot,\" said Halsey at the time. Halsey earned his Naval Aviator's Wings on May 15, 1935, at the age of 52, the oldest person to do so in the history of the U.S. Navy. While he had approval from his wife to train as an observer, she learned from a letter after the fact that he had changed to pilot training, and she told her daughter, \"What do you think that the old fool is doing now? He's learning to fly!\"<ref>Borneman, p. 157.</ref> He went on to command the USS ''Saratoga'', and later the [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]] at [[Pensacola, Florida]]. Halsey considered airpower an important part of the future navy, commenting, \"The naval officer in the next war had better know his aviation, and good.\" Halsey was promoted to [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]] in 1938. During this time he commanded carrier divisions and served as the overall commander of the Aircraft Battle Force.\n\n==World War II==\nTraditional naval doctrine envisioned naval combat fought between opposing battleship gun lines. This view was challenged when Army Air Corps General [[Billy Mitchell]] demonstrated the capability of aircraft to substantially damage and sink even the most heavily armored naval vessel. In the interwar debate that followed, some saw the carrier as defensive in nature, providing air cover to protect the battle group from shore-based aircraft. Carrier-based aircraft were lighter in design and had not been shown to be as lethal. The adage \"Capital ships cannot withstand land-based air power\" was well known.<ref>Morison, ''The Rising Sun in the Pacific'', p. 190.</ref> Aviation proponents, however, imagined bringing the fight to the enemy with the use of air power.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wildenberg |first=Thomas |url = http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/sheerluck_midway.htm |title=Midway: Sheer Luck or Better Doctrine? |journal=Naval College War Review |date=Winter 2005 |volume=58 |number=1 }} Wildenberg quotes Browning's thesis: \"Every carrier we have knows what it means to be 'bopped' with all planes on deck, because her hands were tied by uncertainty as to her next move...\"</ref> Halsey was a firm believer in the aircraft carrier as the primary naval offensive weapon system. When he testified at [[Husband E. Kimmel|Admiral Husband Kimmel's]] hearing after the Pearl Harbor debacle he summed up American carrier tactics being to \"get to the other fellow with everything you have as fast as you can and to dump it on him.\" Halsey testified he would never hesitate to use the carrier as an offensive weapon.\n\nIn April 1940, Halsey's ships, as part of Battle Fleet, moved to Hawaii and in June 1940, he was promoted to vice admiral (temporary rank), and was appointed commander Carrier Division 2 and commander Aircraft Battle Force.<ref name=wukovits2010 />\n\nWith tensions high and war imminent, U.S. Naval intelligence indicated [[Wake Island]] would be the target of a Japanese surprise attack. In response, on 28 November 1941 Admiral Kimmel ordered Halsey to take {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} to ferry aircraft to Wake Island to reinforce the Marines there. Kimmel had given Halsey \"a free hand\" to attack and destroy any Japanese military forces encountered.<ref name=wukovits2010 /> The planes flew off her deck on December 2. Highly anxious of being spotted and then jumped by the Japanese carrier force, Halsey gave orders to \"sink any shipping sighted, shoot down any plane encountered.\" Protested his operations officer, \"Goddammit, Admiral, you can't start a private war of your own! Who's going to take the responsibility?\" Said Halsey, \"I'll take it! If anything gets in my way, we'll shoot first and argue afterwards.\"<ref name=\"Books: The General and the Admiral\">{{cite web |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,793941,00.html#ixzz1aL8AA1Tz |title = Books: The General and the Admiral |work=Time |date=November 10, 1947 }}</ref>  \n\nA storm delayed ''Enterprise'' on her return voyage to Hawaii. Instead of returning on December 6 as planned, she was still {{convert|200|mi}} out at sea, when she received word that the surprise attack anticipated was not at Wake Island, but at [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] itself. News of the attack came in the form of overhearing desperate radio transmissions from one of her aircraft sent forward to Pearl Harbor, attempting to identify itself as American.<ref>Millis, p. 357.</ref> The plane was shot down, and her pilot and crew were lost.

Above all else, he was an energetic and demanding leader who had the ability to invigorate the U.S. Navy's fighting spirit when most required.<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey''.</ref> In the early months of the war, as the nation was rocked by the fall of one western bastion after another, Halsey looked to take the fight to the enemy. Serving as commander, [[Carrier Strike Group Two#Historical background|Carrier Division 2]], aboard his flagship ''Enterprise'', Halsey led a series of hit-and-run raids against the Japanese, striking the [[Marshalls\u2013Gilberts raids|Gilbert and Marshall]] islands in February, Wake Island in March, and carrying out the [[Doolittle Raid]] in April 1942 against the Japanese capital [[Tokyo]] and other places on Japan's largest and most populous island [[Honshu]], the first air raid to strike the [[Japanese archipelago|Japanese Home Islands]], providing an important boost to American [[morale]]. Halsey's slogan, \"Hit hard, hit fast, hit often,\" soon became a byword for the Navy.\n\nHalsey returned to Pearl Harbor from his last raid on May 26, 1942, in poor health due to the extremely serious and stressful conditions at hand. He had spent nearly all of the previous six months on the bridge of the carrier ''Enterprise,'' directing the Navy's counterstrikes. [[Psoriasis]] covered a great deal of his body and caused unbearable itching, making it nearly impossible for him to sleep. Gaunt and having lost {{convert|20|lb|kg}}, he was medically ordered to the hospital in Hawaii.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Naval intelligence had strongly ascertained that the Japanese were planning an attack on the central Pacific island of Midway. Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]], [[CinCPAC|Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet]], determined to take the opportunity to engage them. Losing Midway would have been a very serious threat because the Japanese then could easily take Hawaii and threaten the west coast of the United States. The loss of his most aggressive and combat experienced carrier admiral, Halsey, on the eve of this crisis was a severe blow to Nimitz.<ref>Potter, ''Nimitz'', p. 85.</ref> Nimitz met with Halsey, who recommended his cruiser division commander, Rear Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance|Raymond Spruance]], to take command for the upcoming [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] operation.<ref>Potter, ''Nimitz'', p. 84.</ref> Nimitz considered the move, but it would mean stepping over Rear Admiral [[Frank Jack Fletcher|Frank Fletcher]] of Task Force 17, who was the senior of the two men. After interviewing Fletcher and reviewing his reports from the [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] engagement, Nimitz was convinced that Fletcher's performance was sound, and he was given the responsibility of command in the defense of Midway.<ref>Potter, ''Nimitz'', p. 86.</ref> Acting upon Halsey's recommendations, Nimitz then made Rear Admiral Spruance commander of Halsey's Task Force 16, comprising the carriers ''Enterprise'' and ''Hornet''. To aid Spruance, who had no experience as the commander of a carrier force, Halsey sent along his irascible chief of staff, Captain [[Miles Browning]]. The ensuing harrowing Battle of Midway was a crucial turning point in the war for the United States and a dramatic victory for the U.S. Navy.\n\nHalsey's skin condition was so serious, he was sent on the light cruiser {{USS|Detroit|CL-8|6}} to San Francisco where he was met by a leading allergist for specialized treatment.  The skin condition soon receded but Halsey was ordered to stand down for the next six weeks and relax. While detached stateside during his convalescence, he visited family and traveled to Washington D.C. In late August, he accepted a speaking engagement at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. Prior to the discussion of his raids against the Japanese positions in the Marshall Islands, Halsey informed the midshipmen before him, \"Missing the Battle of Midway has been the greatest disappointment of my career, but I am going back to the Pacific where I intend personally to have a crack at those yellow-bellied sons of bitches and their carriers,\" which was received with loud applause.<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey'', p.&nbsp;150.</ref>\n\nAt the completion of his convalescence in September 1942, Admiral Nimitz reassigned Halsey to Commander, Air Force, Pacific Fleet.\n\n===South Pacific Area Command===\n[[File:Admiral William F Halsey.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Halsey in the South Pacific.]]\n\nAfter being medically approved to return to duty, Halsey was named to command a carrier task force in the South Pacific Area. Since ''Enterprise'' was still laid up in Pearl Harbor undergoing repairs following the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]], and the other ships of Task Force 16 were still being readied, he began a familiarization trip to the south Pacific on October 15, 1942, arriving at area headquarters at [[Noum\u00e9a]] in [[New Caledonia#Second World War|New Caledonia]] on October 18. The [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal Campaign]] was at a critical juncture, with the 1st Marine Division, 11,000 men, under the combat command of Marine Major General [[Alexander Vandegrift|Alexander A. Vandegrift]] holding on by a thread around Henderson (Air) Field.  The Marines did receive additional support from the U.S. Army's 164th Regiment with a complement of 2,800 soldiers on October 13.  This addition only helped to fill some of the serious holes and was insufficient to sustain the battle of itself.\n\nDuring this critical juncture, naval support was tenuous due to Vice Admiral [[Robert L. Ghormley]]'s reticence, malaise and lackluster performance.<ref name=wukovits2010 />  Pacific Fleet commander Chester Nimitz had concluded that Vice Admiral Ghormley had become dispirited and exhausted.<ref>Morison, pp. 199\u2013207; Frank, pp. 368\u2013378; Dull, pp. 235\u2013237.</ref> Nimitz made his decision to change the [[South Pacific Area]] command while Halsey was en route. As Halsey's aircraft came to rest in Noum\u00e9a, a whaleboat came alongside carrying Ghormley's flag lieutenant. Meeting him before he could board the flagship, the lieutenant handed over a sealed envelope containing a message from Nimitz:\n\n{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | YOU WILL TAKE COMMAND OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC AREA AND SOUTH PACIFIC FORCES IMMEDIATELY<ref name=\"Morison p. 183\"/>}}\n\nThe order came as an awkward surprise to Halsey. Ghormley was a long time personal friend, and had been since their days as teammates on the football team back at Annapolis. Awkward or not, the two men carried out their directives. Halsey's command now included all ground, sea, and air forces in the South Pacific area. News of the change flashed and produced an immediate boost to morale with the beleaguered Marines, energizing his command. He was widely considered the U.S. Navy's most aggressive admiral, and with good reason. He set about assessing the situation to determine what actions were needed. Ghormley had been unsure of his command's ability to maintain the Marine toehold on Guadalcanal, and had been mindful of leaving them trapped there for a repeat of the [[Bataan Death March|Bataan Peninsula]] disaster. Halsey punctiliously made it clear he did not plan to withdraw the Marines. He not only intended to counter the Japanese efforts to dislodge them, he intended to secure the island. Above all else, he wanted to regain the initiative and take the fight to the Japanese. It was two days after Halsey had taken command in October 1942 that he gave an order that all naval officers in the South Pacific would dispense with wearing neckties with their tropical uniforms. As Richard Frank commented in his account of the Battle for Guadalcanal:\n{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | Halsey said he gave this order to conform to Army practice and for comfort. To his command it viscerally evoked the image of a brawler stripping for action and symbolized a casting off of effete elegance no more appropriate to the tropics than to war.<ref>{{cite book |title=Guadalcanal: The Definitive Account of the Landmark Battle |author=Richard Frank |year=1990 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-016561-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/guadalcanal00rich }}</ref>}}\n\nHalsey led the South Pacific command through what was for the U.S. Navy the most tenuous phase of the war. Halsey committed his limited naval forces through a series of naval battles around Guadalcanal, including the carrier engagements of the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] and the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]]. These engagements checked the Japanese advance and drained their naval forces of carrier aircraft and pilots. [[File:Nimitz and Halsey 1943.jpg|thumb|left|Admirals Nimitz and Halsey discuss South Pacific strategy in early 1943.]] In November Halsey's willingness to place at risk his command's two fast battleships in the confined waters around Guadalcanal for a night engagement paid off with the U.S. Navy winning the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], the decisive naval engagement of the Guadalcanal campaign that doomed the Japanese garrison and wrested control from the Japanese.\n\nJapanese naval aviation proved to be formidable during the Solomon campaign.<ref>Seal, Jon, and Michael Ahn. {{cite web |url = http://www.microsoft.com/games/combatfs2/articles_foss.asp |title = An Interview with Joseph Jacob 'Joe' Foss. |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060209105228/http://www.microsoft.com/games/combatfs2/articles_foss.asp |archive-date=February 9, 2006 |df=mdy-all |publisher = [[Microsoft Games Studios]] |date=March 2000 |access-date=August 3, 2011 }}</ref>  In April 1943, Halsey assigned Admiral [[Marc Mitscher]] to Commander Air, [[Solomon Islands]] (ComAirSols) where he directed a mixed bag of Army, Navy, Marine and New Zealand aircraft in the airwar over Guadalcanal and up the Solomon chain.  Said Halsey: \"I knew we'd probably catch hell from the Japs in the air.  That's why I sent Pete Mitscher up there.  Pete was a fighting fool and I knew it.\"<ref>Taylor, p. 145.</ref>\n\nTypical for the period was an exchange that occurred between Halsey and one of his staff officers in June 1943. South Pacific Command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive. As a part of the long view of winning the war taken by Nimitz, upon its arrival at Fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up, its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training. South Pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the Solomon chain. The staff officer who brought the dispatch to Halsey remarked \"If they do that to us we will have to go on the defensive.\" The admiral turned to the speaker and replied: \"As long as I have one plane and one pilot, I will stay on the offensive.\"<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey'', p.&nbsp;221.</ref>\n\nHalsey's forces spent the rest of the year [[Solomon Islands campaign|battling]] up the [[Solomon Islands]] chain to [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]].  At Bougainville the Japanese had two airfields in the southern tip of the island, and another at the northern most peninsula, with a fourth on Buki just across the northern passage.  Here, instead of landing near the Japanese airfields and taking them away against the bulk of the Japanese defenders, Halsey landed his invasion force of 14,000 Marines in [[Empress Augusta Bay]], about halfway up the west coast of Bougainville.  There he had the Seabees clear and build their own airfield.  Two days after the landing, a large cruiser force was sent down from Japan to Rabaul in preparation for a night engagement against Halsey's screening force and supply ships in Empress Augusta Bay.  The Japanese had been conserving their naval forces over the past year, but now committed a force of seven heavy cruisers, along with one light cruiser and four destroyers.  At [[Rabaul]] the force refueled in preparation for the coming night battle. Halsey had no surface forces anywhere near equivalent strength to oppose them.  The battleships {{USS|Washington|BB-56|2}}, {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|2}} and assorted cruisers had been transferred to the Central Pacific to support the upcoming invasion of Tarawa.  Other than the destroyer screen, the only force Halsey had available were the carrier airgroups on {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}} and {{USS|Princeton|CVL-23|2}}.  Rabaul was a heavily fortified port, with five airfields and extensive anti-aircraft batteries.  Other than the surprise raid at Pearl Harbor, no mission against such a target had ever been accomplished with carrier aircraft.  It was highly dangerous to the aircrews, and to the carriers as well.  With the landing in the balance, Halsey sent his two carriers to steam north through the night to get into range of Rabaul, then launch a daybreak raid on the base.  Aircraft from recently captured [[Vella Lavella]] were sent over to provide a combat air patrol over the carriers. All available aircraft from the two carriers were committed to the raid itself.  The [[Bombing of Rabaul (November 1943)|mission]] was a stunning success, so damaging the cruiser force at Rabaul as to make them no longer a threat.  Aircraft losses in the raid were light.  Halsey later described the threat to the landings as \"the most desperate emergency that confronted me in my entire term as ComSoPac.\"<ref>Potter, ''Admiral Arleigh Burke'', pp.&nbsp;98\u201399.</ref>\n\nFollowing the successful Bougainville operation, he then isolated and neutralized the Japanese naval stronghold at Rabaul by capturing surrounding positions in the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] in a series of amphibious landings known as [[Operation Cartwheel]]. This enabled the continuation of the drive north without the heavy fighting that would have been necessary to capture the base itself.  With the neutralization of Rabaul, major operations in the South Pacific Command came to a close.  With his determination and grit, Halsey had bolstered his command's resolve and seized the initiative from the Japanese until ships, aircraft and crews produced and trained in the States could arrive in 1943 and 1944 to tip the scales of the war in favor of the allies.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 416\u2013430.</ref>\n\n===Battles of the Central Pacific===\n[[File:VAdm John S.

McCain Sr.]] on board Halsey's flagship, {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|6}} in December 1944]]As the war progressed it moved out of the South Pacific and into the Central Pacific. Halsey's command shifted with it, and in May 1944 he was promoted to commanding officer of the newly formed [[U.S. Third Fleet|Third Fleet]]. He commanded actions from the [[Philippines]] to Japan. From September 1944 to January 1945, he led the campaigns to take the [[Palaus]], [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] and [[Luzon]], and on many raids on Japanese bases, including off the shores of Formosa, China, and Vietnam.\n\nBy this point in the conflict the U.S. Navy was doing things the Japanese high command had not thought possible. The [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] was able to bring to battle enough air power to overpower land based aircraft and dominate whatever area the fleet was operating in. Moreover, the Navy's ability to establish [[USS Cascade (AD-16)#Service Squadron 4 and Service Squadron 10|forward operating ports]] as they did at [[Majuro#History|Majuro]], [[Enewetak Atoll#History|Enewetak]] and [[Ulithi#History|Ulithi]], and their ability to convoy supplies out to the combat task forces, allowed the fleet to operate for extended periods of time far out to sea in the central and western Pacific. The Japanese Navy conserved itself in port and would sortie in force to engage the enemy. The U.S. Navy remained at sea and on station, dominating whatever region it entered. The size of the Pacific Ocean, which Japanese planners had thought would limit the U.S. Navy's ability to operate in the western Pacific, would not be adequate to protect Japan.\n\nCommand of the \"big blue fleet\" was alternated with [[Raymond Spruance]].{{NoteTag|The \"Big Blue Fleet\" was the name given to the main fleet of the US Navy in the Pacific.  The term stems from pre-war planning, called the color plans because each nation included was given a color code name. In these potential plans the British navy was red, the German navy black, and so forth. The Imperial Japanese Navy was termed the \"Orange Fleet\".  The U.S. fleet was the \"Blue Fleet\".  The \"Big Blue Fleet\" was the massive fleet that the U.S. Navy anticipated they would win the war with.  It was thought this fleet would largely come into being by late 1943, early 1944.<ref name=\"Potter p. 112\" />}}  Under Spruance the fleet designation was the [[U.S. Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleet]] and the Fast Carrier Task Force was designated \"Task Force 58\". Under Halsey the fleet was designated Third Fleet and the Fast Carrier Task Force was designated \"Task Force 38\".<ref name=\"Potter p. 112\" /> The split command structure was intended to confuse the Japanese and created a higher tempo of operations. While Spruance was at sea operating the fleet, Halsey and his staff, self-dubbed the \"Department of Dirty Tricks\", would be planning the next series of operations.<ref>Cutler, ''The Battle of Leyte Gulf'', p. 209.</ref> The two admirals were a contrast in styles. Halsey was aggressive and a risk taker. Spruance was calculating, professional and cautious. Most higher-ranking officers preferred to serve under Spruance; most common sailors were proud to serve under Halsey.<ref>{{cite book |title=America's Fighting Admirals:Winning the War at Sea in World War II |last=Tuohy |first=William |publisher=Zenith Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/americasfighting00tuoh/page/323 323] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-7603-2985-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/americasfighting00tuoh/page/323 }}</ref>\n\n====Leyte Gulf====\n[[File:Halsey messing with crew.jpg|thumb|right|Halsey dines with crew of USS ''New Jersey'' (November 1944)]]\nIn October 1944, amphibious forces of the U.S. [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] carried out [[Douglas MacArthur|General Douglas MacArthur's]] major landings on the island of [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] in the Central Philippines. Halsey's Third Fleet was assigned to cover and support Seventh Fleet operations around Leyte. Halsey's plans assumed the Japanese fleet or a major portion of it would challenge the effort, creating an opportunity to engage it decisively. Halsey directed the Third Fleet \"will seek the enemy and attempt to bring about a decisive engagement if he undertakes operations beyond support of superior land based air forces.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/9fe423c2-9276-41c7-be29-04260b8a04c3/Replacing-Battleships-with-Aircraft-Carriers-in-th|last=Hone|first=Thomas|title=Replacing Battleships with Aircraft Carriers in the Pacific in World War II|work=Naval War College Review|date=Winter 2013 |accessdate=April 11, 2017|p=71}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the invasion, the Japanese launched their final major naval effort, an operation known as 'Sho-Go', involving almost all their surviving fleet. It was aimed at destroying the invasion shipping in the [[Leyte Gulf]]. The Northern Force of Admiral Ozawa was built around the remaining Japanese aircraft carriers, now weakened by the heavy loss of trained pilots. The Northern Force was meant to lure the covering U.S. forces away from the Gulf while two surface battle-groups, the Center Force and the Southern Force, were to break through to the beachhead and attack the invasion shipping. These forces were built around the remaining strength of the Japanese Navy, and comprised a total of 7 battleships and 16 cruisers. The operation brought about the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Battle for Leyte Gulf]], the largest naval battle of the Second World War and, by some criteria, the [[largest naval battle in history]].\n\nThe Center Force commanded by Vice Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]] was located October 23 coming through the Palawan Passage by two American submarines, which [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#The submarine action in Palawan Passage .2823 October.29|attacked the force]], sinking two heavy cruisers and damaging a third. The following day Third Fleet's aircraft carriers launched strikes against Kurita's Center Force, [[Battle of the Sibuyan Sea|sinking]] the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}} and damaging the heavy cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|My\u014dk\u014d||2}}, causing the force to turn westward back towards its base. Kurita appeared to be retiring but he later reversed course and headed back into the [[San Bernardino Strait]]. At this point Ozawa's Northern Force was located by Third Fleet scout aircraft. Halsey made the momentous decision to take all available strength northwards to destroy the Japanese carrier forces, planning to strike them at dawn of October 25. He considered leaving a battle group behind to guard the strait, and made tentative plans to do so, but he felt he would also have to leave one of his three carrier groups to provide air cover, weakening his chance to crush the remaining Japanese carrier forces. The entire Third Fleet steamed northward. San Bernardino Strait was effectively left unguarded by any major surface fleet.\n\n====Battle off Samar====\nIn moving Third Fleet northwards, Halsey failed to advise Admiral [[Thomas C. Kinkaid|Thomas Kinkaid]] of Seventh Fleet of his decision. Seventh Fleet intercepts of organizational messages from Halsey to his own task group commanders seemed to indicate that Halsey had formed a task force and detached it to protect the San Bernardino Strait, but this was not the case. Kinkaid and his staff failed to confirm this with Halsey, and neither had confirmed this with Nimitz.\n\nDespite aerial reconnaissance reports on the night of October 24\u201325 of Kurita's Center Force in the San Bernardino Strait, Halsey continued to take Third Fleet northwards, away from Leyte Gulf.\n\n[[File:Halsey Mccain.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Halsey with Vice Admiral [[John S. McCain Sr.]]]]\n\nWhen Kurita's Center Force emerged from the San Bernardino Strait on the morning of October 25, there was nothing to oppose them except a small force of escort carriers and screening destroyers and [[destroyer escort]]s, Task Unit 77.4.3 \"Taffy 3\", which had been tasked and armed to attack troops on land and guard against submarines, not oppose the largest enemy surface fleet since the battle of Midway, led by the largest battleship in the world. Advancing down the coast of the island of Samar towards the troop transports and support ships of the Leyte Gulf landing, they took Seventh Fleet's escort carriers and their screening ships entirely by surprise.\n\nIn the desperate [[Battle off Samar]] which followed, Kurita's ships destroyed one of the escort carriers and three ships of the carriers' screen, and damaged a number of other ships as well. The remarkable resistance of the screening ships of Taffy 3 against Kurita's battle-group remains one of the most heroic feats in the history of the US Navy. Their efforts and those of the several hundred aircraft that the escort carriers could put up, many of whom, however could not be armed with the most effective ordinance to deal with heavy surface ships in time, took a heavy toll on Kurita's ships and convinced him that he was facing a stronger force than was the case. Mistaking the escort carriers for Halsey's fleet carriers, and fearing entrapment from the six battleships of the Third Fleet battleship group, he decided to withdraw back through the San Bernardino Strait and to the west without achieving his objective of disrupting the Leyte landing.\n\nWhen the Seventh Fleet's escort carriers found themselves under attack from the Center Force, Halsey began to receive a succession of desperate calls from Kinkaid asking for immediate assistance off Samar. For over two hours Halsey turned a deaf ear to these calls. Then, shortly after 10:00 hours,<ref name=\"Willmott\">{{cite book |last=Willmott|first=H.

The world wonders\". The tail end of this message, [[The world wonders]], was intended as padding designed to confuse enemy decoders, but was mistakenly left in the message when it was handed to Halsey. The urgent inquiry had seemingly become a stinging rebuke. The fiery Halsey threw his hat on the deck of the bridge and began cursing.<ref name=\"Willmott\"/> Finally Halsey's Chief of Staff, Rear Admiral [[Robert Carney|Robert \"Mick\" Carney]], confronted him, telling Halsey \"Stop it! What the hell's the matter with you? Pull yourself together.\"<ref name=\"Books: The General and the Admiral\"/>\n\nHalsey cooled but continued to steam Third Fleet northward to close on Ozawa's Northern Force for a full hour after receiving the signal from Nimitz.<ref name=\"Willmott\"/> Then, Halsey ordered Task Force 34 south. As Task Force 34 proceeded south they were further delayed when the battle force had to slow to 12 knots so that the battleships could refuel their escorting destroyers. The refueling cost a two and a half hour further delay.<ref name=\"Willmott\"/> By the time Task Force 34 arrived at the scene it was too late to assist the Seventh Fleet's escort carrier groups. Kurita had already decided to retire and had left the area. A single straggling destroyer was caught by Halsey's advance cruisers and destroyers, but the rest of Kurita's force was able to escape.\n\nMeanwhile the major part Third Fleet continued to close on Ozawa's Northern Force, which included one fleet carrier (the last surviving Japanese carrier of the six that had attacked Pearl Harbor) and three light carriers. The [[Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o]] resulted in Halsey's Third Fleet sinking all four of Ozawa's carriers.\n\nThe same attributes that made Halsey an invaluable leader in the desperate early months of the war, his desire to bring the fight to the enemy, his willingness to take on a gamble, worked against him in the later stages of the war. Halsey received much criticism for his decisions during the battle, with naval historian [[Samuel Eliot Morison|Samuel Morison]] terming the Third Fleet run to the north \"Halsey's Blunder.\"<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey'', pp. 376\u2013380.</ref> However, the destruction of the Japanese carriers had been an important goal up to that point, and the Leyte landings were still successful despite Halsey falling for the Japanese Navy's decoy.\n\n=== Halsey's Typhoon ===\n{{Main|Typhoon Cobra (1944)}}\n\n[[File:USS Langley (CVL-27) during Typhoon Cobra, December 1944.jpg|thumb|right|{{USS|Langley|CVL-27|6}} struggles in Typhoon Cobra.]]\n\nAfter the Leyte Gulf engagement, December found the Third Fleet confronted with another powerful enemy in the form of [[Typhoon Cobra]], which was dubbed \"Halsey's Typhoon\" by many.\n\nWhile conducting operations off the Philippines, the fleet had to discontinue refueling due to a Pacific storm. Rather than move Third Fleet away, Halsey chose to remain on station for another day. In fairness, he received conflicting information from Pearl Harbor and his own staff. The Hawaiian weathermen predicted a northerly path for the storm, which would have cleared Task Force 38 by some {{convert|200|mi|km|spell=in}}. Eventually his own staff provided a prediction regarding the direction of the storm that was far closer to the mark with a westerly direction. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/william-bull-halsey-legendary-world-war-ii-admiral.htm |title=William Bull Halsey: Legendary World War II Admiral |author=Barrett Tillman |work=historynet.com |date=July 2007}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Halsey played the odds, declining to cancel planned operations and requiring the ships of Third Fleet to hold formation. On the evening of December 17 Third Fleet was unable to land its combat air patrol due to the pitching and rolling decks of the carriers. All the aircraft were ditched in the ocean and lost, but the pilots were all saved by accompanying destroyers. By 10:00&nbsp;a.m. the next morning the barometer on the flagship was noted to be dropping precipitously. With increasingly heavy seas the fleet still attempted to maintain stations. The threat was greatest to the fleet's destroyers, which did not have the fuel reserves of the larger ships and were running dangerously low. Finally, at 11:49&nbsp;a.m., Halsey issued the order for the ships of the fleet to take the most comfortable course available to them. Many of the smaller ships had already been forced to do so. \n\nBetween 11:00&nbsp;a.m. and 2:00&nbsp;p.m., the typhoon did its worst damage, tossing the ships in {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on|0}} waves. The barometer continued to drop and the wind roared at {{convert|83|kn|kph|lk=in|0}} with gusts well over {{convert|100|kn|kph|0}}. At 1:45&nbsp;p.m. Halsey issued a typhoon warning to Fleet Weather Central. By this time Third Fleet had lost three of its destroyers. By the time the storm had cleared the next day a great many ships in the fleet had been damaged, 146 aircraft were destroyed and 802 seamen had been lost. For the next three days Third Fleet conducted search and rescue operations, finally retiring to [[Ulithi]] on 22 December 1944.\n\nFollowing the typhoon a Navy court of inquiry was convened on board {{USS|Cascade|AD-16|6}} in the Naval base at Ulithi. Admiral Nimitz, CINCPAC, was in attendance at the court. Forty-three-year-old Captain Herbert K. Gates, of ''Cascade'', was the Judge Advocate.<ref>Drury.</ref> The inquiry found that though Halsey had committed an error of judgement in sailing the Third Fleet into the heart of the typhoon, it stopped short of unambiguously recommending sanction.<ref name=\"Melton, Sea Cobra\">Melton, ''Sea Cobra''.</ref> The events surrounding Typhoon Cobra were similar to those the Japanese navy had faced some nine years earlier in what they termed \"[[4th Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)#The Fourth Fleet incident|The Fourth Fleet Incident]].\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Kaigun: Strategy, Tactics and Technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy 1887\u20131941 |last1=Evans |first1=David |last2=Peattie |first2=Mark|publisher=Naval Institute Press |page=243 |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-87021-192-8}}</ref>\n\n===End of the war===\n[[File:Nimitz missouri.jpg|thumb|Fleet Admiral Nimitz signing the documents of surrender on board USS ''Missouri''. Behind him stand Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Rear Adm. Forrest Sherman, and Halsey (''middle'').]]\nDuring January 1945 the Third Fleet attacked Formosa and Luzon, and [[South China Sea raid|raided the South China Sea]] in support of the landing of US Army forces on Luzon. At the conclusion of this operation, Halsey passed command of the ships that made up Third Fleet to Admiral Spruance on January 26, whereupon its designation changed to [[United States Fifth Fleet#History|Fifth Fleet]]. Returning home Halsey was asked about General MacArthur, who was not the easiest man to work with, and vied with the Navy over the conduct and management of the war in the Pacific.<ref>Willmott, pp. 178\u2013181.</ref> Halsey had worked well with MacArthur and did not mind saying so. When a reporter asked Halsey if he thought MacArthur's fleet (7th Fleet) would get to Tokyo first, the admiral grinned and answered \"We're going there together.\"  Then seriously he added \"He's a very fine man. I have worked under him for over two years and have the greatest admiration and respect for him.\"<ref>''Utica Daily Press'', February 20, 1945.</ref>\n\nSpruance held command of Fifth Fleet until May, when command returned to Halsey. In early June 1945 the Third Fleet again sailed through the path of [[Typhoon Connie]]. On this occasion, six men were swept overboard and lost, along with 75 airplanes lost or destroyed, with another 70 badly damaged. Though some ships sustained significant damage, none were lost.  A Navy court of inquiry was again convened, this time recommending that Halsey be reassigned, but Admiral Nimitz declined to abide by this recommendation, citing Halsey's prior service record, despite that record including a previous instance of negligently sailing his fleet through a typhoon.<ref name=\"Melton, Sea Cobra\" />\n\nHalsey led Third Fleet through the final stages of the war, striking targets on the Japanese homeland itself. Third Fleet aircraft conducted attacks upon Tokyo, the [[Bombing of Kure (July 1945)|naval base at Kure]] and the northern Japanese island of [[Hokkaid\u014d]], and Third Fleet battleships engaged in the [[Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II|bombardment of a number of Japanese coastal cities]] in preparation for an invasion of Japan, which ultimately never had to be undertaken.\n\nAfter the cessation of hostilities, Halsey, still aggressively cautious of Japanese kamikaze attacks, ordered Third Fleet to maintain a protective air cover with the following communiqu\u00e9: {{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | Cessation of hostilities.<br />War is over. <br />If any Japanese airplanes appear, shoot them down in a friendly way.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Caviar and Commissars: the Experience of a US Naval Officer in Stalin's Russia |author=Kemp Tolley |page=245|publisher=Naval Institute Press |year=1983 |isbn=978-1-55750-407-4}}</ref>}}\nHe was present when [[Surrender of Japan|Japan formally surrendered]] on the deck of his [[flagship]], {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}, on September 2, 1945.\n\n==Postwar years==\n[[File:Halsey.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Halsey]]\nImmediately after the surrender of Japan, 54 ships of the Third Fleet returned to the United States, with Halsey's four-star flag flying from USS ''South Dakota'', for the annual Navy Day Celebrations in San Francisco on October 27, 1945. He hauled down his flag on 22 November 1945, and was assigned special duty in the office of the Secretary of the Navy. On December 11, 1945, he took the oath as [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]], becoming the fourth and still the most recent naval officer awarded that rank. Halsey made a goodwill flying trip, passing by [[Central America|Central]] and South America, covering nearly {{convert|28,000|mi}} and 11 nations. He retired from active service in March 1947, but as a Fleet Admiral, he was not taken off active duty status.\n\nHalsey was asked about the weapons used to win the war and he answered:\n{{Quote | style = font-size: 100%; | If I had to give credit to the instruments and machines that won us the war in the Pacific, I would rate them in this order: submarines first, radar second, planes third, bulldozers fourth.<ref>{{cite book |title = Admiral Halsey's Story |first=William |last=Halsey |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1947|page=69 |isbn = 978-1-4367-1143-2 }}</ref>}}\n\nHalsey joined the New Jersey Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]] in 1946. Upon retirement, he joined the board of two subsidiaries of the [[International Telephone and Telegraph Company]], including the [[American Cable and Radio Corporation]], and served until 1957. He maintained an office near the top of the ITT Building at 67 Broad Street, New York City in the late 1950s. He was involved in a number of efforts to preserve his former flagship {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} as a memorial in [[New York Harbor]]. They proved fruitless, as it was not possible to secure sufficient funding to preserve the ship.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Fleet Admiral William Frederick Halsey Jr. (19351365942).jpg|thumb|Halsey's grave at Arlington National Cemetery]]\n\nHalsey died on August 16, 1959, while on holiday on [[Fishers Island, New York]].<ref name=mjapobt>{{cite news |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=c9cjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wyUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7080%2C3200658 |work=Milwaukee Journal |agency=Associated Press |title=Admiral Halsey dies; beat Japanese fleet |date=August 17, 1959 |page=4, part 1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.kxmb.com/News/418118.asp |title = Following Advance for Use Sunday, Aug. 16 &#124; |website = KXNet.com North Dakota News }}</ref> After lying in state in the [[Washington National Cathedral]], he was interred on August 20, 1959, near his parents in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

Wouk was extremely critical of Halsey's handling of the battle at Leyte Gulf, but also said he was too great a builder of naval morale to be retired in disgrace.  (Chapter 92)  Halsey was portrayed in the 1983 television [[miniseries]] adaptation of ''The Winds of War'' by [[Richard X. Slattery]], and in the 1988 miniseries adaptation of ''War and Remembrance'' by [[Pat Hingle]].\n* Halsey has been portrayed in a number of other films and TV miniseries, played by [[Glenn Morshower]] ([[Pearl Harbor (film)|''Pearl Harbor'']], 2001), [[Kenneth Tobey]] (''[[MacArthur (film)|MacArthur]]'', 1977), [[Jack Diamond (actor)|Jack Diamond]] (''[[Battle Stations (1956 film)|Battle Stations]]'', 1956), [[John Maxwell (actor)|John Maxwell]], (''[[The Eternal Sea]]'', 1955) and [[Morris Ankrum]] (''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'', 1944).\n* An \"Admiral Halsey\" is mentioned in the [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] and [[Linda McCartney]] song \"[[Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey]]\". The chorus of \"hands across the water, heads across the sky\" was a reference to the American aid programs of World War II. McCartney later specified that the second half of the song was indeed in honor of William Halsey.<ref>{{cite book |last=McGee |first=Garry |year=2003 |title=Band on the Run: A History of Paul McCartney and Wings |publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing |location=New York |page=196 |isbn=0-87833-304-5}}</ref>\n* On March 4, 1951, Halsey appeared as a mystery guest on episode No. 40 of the game show, ''[[What's My Line]]'', where the panel correctly deduced his identity.<ref>{{cite web |work=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/whats-my-line/episode-40/episode/92668/summary.html# |title=Episode No. 40 Summary}}</ref>\n* In the television series, ''[[McHale's Navy]]'', one of Captain Binghampton's catchphrases whenever he would get frustrated with one of McHale's schemes was, \"What in the name of Halsey is going on here?\"\n* Halsey is mentioned in the 1990 film ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]''. Soviet submarine commander Marko Ramius, while engaged in battle with the Soviet attack submarine ''Konovalov'', asks [[Jack Ryan (Tom Clancy character)|Jack Ryan]] what books he wrote for the CIA. Ryan mentions one about Admiral Halsey, entitled ''The Fighting Sailor'' (not to be confused with a real book of the same title); Ramius reveals his awareness of the book and expresses disdain for Ryan's assessment of Halsey, saying, \"Your conclusions were all wrong, Ryan. Halsey acted stupidly.\"\n* The fictional aircraft carrier USS ''William Halsey'' in [[Darren Sapp]]'s novel, ''[[Fire on the Flight Deck]]'', is named for Halsey.\n* On May 30, 2018, he was added as an unlockable unique commander for the United States Navy in the videogame [[World of Warships]].\n* A character in [[Seth MacFarlane]]'s ''[[The Orville]]'' is named Admiral Halsey, presumably after Admiral Halsey.\n* Halsey appears as a purchasable general in the Easytech mobile game ''[[World Conqueror 4]]''.\n\n\u2022   In ''Bridge over the River Kwai'', William Holden feigning madness replies, \u201cI'm getting worse, you know.

Halsey commanded a number of torpedo boats and [[destroyer]]s during the 1910s and 1920s. At that time, the destroyer and the torpedo boat, though extremely hazardous delivery methods, were the most effective way to bring the torpedo into combat against capital ships. Then-[[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Halsey's World War I service, including command of {{USS|Shaw|DD-68|6}} in 1918, earned him the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]].\n\n== Interwar years ==\nIn October 1922, he was the [[Naval Attach\u00e9|naval attach\u00e9]] at the American Embassy in [[Berlin]], Germany.

Then-[[Captain (naval)|Captain]] Halsey continued his destroyer duty on his next two-year stint at sea, starting in 1930 as the Commander of Destroyer Division Three of the Scouting Force, before returning to study at the [[Naval War College]] in Newport, Rhode Island.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq36-5.htm |title = Fleet Admiral William Frederick Halsey Jr. |publisher=[[Naval Historical Center]] }}</ref>\n\nIn 1934, the chief of the [[Bureau of Aeronautics]], Navy Admiral [[Ernest King]], offered Halsey command of the aircraft carrier {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}}, subject to completion of the course of an air observer. Halsey elected to enroll as a cadet for the full 12-week [[United States Naval Aviator|Naval Aviator]] course rather than the simpler Naval Aviation Observer program. \"I thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than to just sit back and be at the mercy of the pilot,\" said Halsey at the time. Halsey earned his Naval Aviator's Wings on May 15, 1935, at the age of 52, the oldest person to do so in the history of the U.S. Navy. While he had approval from his wife to train as an observer, she learned from a letter after the fact that he had changed to pilot training, and she told her daughter, \"What do you think that the old fool is doing now? He's learning to fly!\"<ref>Borneman, p. 157.</ref> He went on to command the USS ''Saratoga'', and later the [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]] at [[Pensacola, Florida]]. Halsey considered airpower an important part of the future navy, commenting, \"The naval officer in the next war had better know his aviation, and good.\" Halsey was promoted to [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]] in 1938. During this time he commanded carrier divisions and served as the overall commander of the Aircraft Battle Force.\n\n==World War II==\nTraditional naval doctrine envisioned naval combat fought between opposing battleship gun lines. This view was challenged when Army Air Corps General [[Billy Mitchell]] demonstrated the capability of aircraft to substantially damage and sink even the most heavily armored naval vessel. In the interwar debate that followed, some saw the carrier as defensive in nature, providing air cover to protect the battle group from shore-based aircraft. Carrier-based aircraft were lighter in design and had not been shown to be as lethal. The adage \"Capital ships cannot withstand land-based air power\" was well known.<ref>Morison, ''The Rising Sun in the Pacific'', p. 190.</ref> Aviation proponents, however, imagined bringing the fight to the enemy with the use of air power.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wildenberg |first=Thomas |url = http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/sheerluck_midway.htm |title=Midway: Sheer Luck or Better Doctrine? |journal=Naval College War Review |date=Winter 2005 |volume=58 |number=1 }} Wildenberg quotes Browning's thesis: \"Every carrier we have knows what it means to be 'bopped' with all planes on deck, because her hands were tied by uncertainty as to her next move...\"</ref> Halsey was a firm believer in the aircraft carrier as the primary naval offensive weapon system. When he testified at [[Husband E. Kimmel|Admiral Husband Kimmel's]] hearing after the Pearl Harbor debacle he summed up American carrier tactics being to \"get to the other fellow with everything you have as fast as you can and to dump it on him.\" Halsey testified he would never hesitate to use the carrier as an offensive weapon.\n\nIn April 1940, Halsey's ships, as part of Battle Fleet, moved to Hawaii and in June 1940, he was promoted to vice admiral (temporary rank), and was appointed commander Carrier Division 2 and commander Aircraft Battle Force.<ref name=wukovits2010 />\n\nWith tensions high and war imminent, U.S. Naval intelligence indicated [[Wake Island]] would be the target of a Japanese surprise attack.

Kimmel had given Halsey \"a free hand\" to attack and destroy any Japanese military forces encountered.<ref name=wukovits2010 /> The planes flew off her deck on December 2. Highly anxious of being spotted and then jumped by the Japanese carrier force, Halsey gave orders to \"sink any shipping sighted, shoot down any plane encountered.\" Protested his operations officer, \"Goddammit, Admiral, you can't start a private war of your own!

Above all else, he was an energetic and demanding leader who had the ability to invigorate the U.S. Navy's fighting spirit when most required.<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey''.</ref> In the early months of the war, as the nation was rocked by the fall of one western bastion after another, Halsey looked to take the fight to the enemy. Serving as commander, [[Carrier Strike Group Two#Historical background|Carrier Division 2]], aboard his flagship ''Enterprise'', Halsey led a series of hit-and-run raids against the Japanese, striking the [[Marshalls\u2013Gilberts raids|Gilbert and Marshall]] islands in February, Wake Island in March, and carrying out the [[Doolittle Raid]] in April 1942 against the Japanese capital [[Tokyo]] and other places on Japan's largest and most populous island [[Honshu]], the first air raid to strike the [[Japanese archipelago|Japanese Home Islands]], providing an important boost to American [[morale]]. Halsey's slogan, \"Hit hard, hit fast, hit often,\" soon became a byword for the Navy.\n\nHalsey returned to Pearl Harbor from his last raid on May 26, 1942, in poor health due to the extremely serious and stressful conditions at hand. He had spent nearly all of the previous six months on the bridge of the carrier ''Enterprise,'' directing the Navy's counterstrikes. [[Psoriasis]] covered a great deal of his body and caused unbearable itching, making it nearly impossible for him to sleep. Gaunt and having lost {{convert|20|lb|kg}}, he was medically ordered to the hospital in Hawaii.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Naval intelligence had strongly ascertained that the Japanese were planning an attack on the central Pacific island of Midway. Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]], [[CinCPAC|Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet]], determined to take the opportunity to engage them. Losing Midway would have been a very serious threat because the Japanese then could easily take Hawaii and threaten the west coast of the United States. The loss of his most aggressive and combat experienced carrier admiral, Halsey, on the eve of this crisis was a severe blow to Nimitz.<ref>Potter, ''Nimitz'', p. 85.</ref> Nimitz met with Halsey, who recommended his cruiser division commander, Rear Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance|Raymond Spruance]], to take command for the upcoming [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] operation.<ref>Potter, ''Nimitz'', p. 84.</ref> Nimitz considered the move, but it would mean stepping over Rear Admiral [[Frank Jack Fletcher|Frank Fletcher]] of Task Force 17, who was the senior of the two men. After interviewing Fletcher and reviewing his reports from the [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] engagement, Nimitz was convinced that Fletcher's performance was sound, and he was given the responsibility of command in the defense of Midway.<ref>Potter, ''Nimitz'', p. 86.</ref> Acting upon Halsey's recommendations, Nimitz then made Rear Admiral Spruance commander of Halsey's Task Force 16, comprising the carriers ''Enterprise'' and ''Hornet''. To aid Spruance, who had no experience as the commander of a carrier force, Halsey sent along his irascible chief of staff, Captain [[Miles Browning]]. The ensuing harrowing Battle of Midway was a crucial turning point in the war for the United States and a dramatic victory for the U.S. Navy.\n\nHalsey's skin condition was so serious, he was sent on the light cruiser {{USS|Detroit|CL-8|6}} to San Francisco where he was met by a leading allergist for specialized treatment.  The skin condition soon receded but Halsey was ordered to stand down for the next six weeks and relax. While detached stateside during his convalescence, he visited family and traveled to Washington D.C. In late August, he accepted a speaking engagement at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. Prior to the discussion of his raids against the Japanese positions in the Marshall Islands, Halsey informed the midshipmen before him, \"Missing the Battle of Midway has been the greatest disappointment of my career, but I am going back to the Pacific where I intend personally to have a crack at those yellow-bellied sons of bitches and their carriers,\" which was received with loud applause.<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey'', p.&nbsp;150.</ref>\n\nAt the completion of his convalescence in September 1942, Admiral Nimitz reassigned Halsey to Commander, Air Force, Pacific Fleet.\n\n===South Pacific Area Command===\n[[File:Admiral William F Halsey.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Halsey in the South Pacific.]]\n\nAfter being medically approved to return to duty, Halsey was named to command a carrier task force in the South Pacific Area. Since ''Enterprise'' was still laid up in Pearl Harbor undergoing repairs following the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]], and the other ships of Task Force 16 were still being readied, he began a familiarization trip to the south Pacific on October 15, 1942, arriving at area headquarters at [[Noum\u00e9a]] in [[New Caledonia#Second World War|New Caledonia]] on October 18. The [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal Campaign]] was at a critical juncture, with the 1st Marine Division, 11,000 men, under the combat command of Marine Major General [[Alexander Vandegrift|Alexander A. Vandegrift]] holding on by a thread around Henderson (Air) Field.  The Marines did receive additional support from the U.S. Army's 164th Regiment with a complement of 2,800 soldiers on October 13.  This addition only helped to fill some of the serious holes and was insufficient to sustain the battle of itself.\n\nDuring this critical juncture, naval support was tenuous due to Vice Admiral [[Robert L. Ghormley]]'s reticence, malaise and lackluster performance.<ref name=wukovits2010 />  Pacific Fleet commander Chester Nimitz had concluded that Vice Admiral Ghormley had become dispirited and exhausted.<ref>Morison, pp. 199\u2013207; Frank, pp. 368\u2013378; Dull, pp. 235\u2013237.</ref> Nimitz made his decision to change the [[South Pacific Area]] command while Halsey was en route. As Halsey's aircraft came to rest in Noum\u00e9a, a whaleboat came alongside carrying Ghormley's flag lieutenant. Meeting him before he could board the flagship, the lieutenant handed over a sealed envelope containing a message from Nimitz:\n\n{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | YOU WILL TAKE COMMAND OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC AREA AND SOUTH PACIFIC FORCES IMMEDIATELY<ref name=\"Morison p. 183\"/>}}\n\nThe order came as an awkward surprise to Halsey. Ghormley was a long time personal friend, and had been since their days as teammates on the football team back at Annapolis. Awkward or not, the two men carried out their directives. Halsey's command now included all ground, sea, and air forces in the South Pacific area. News of the change flashed and produced an immediate boost to morale with the beleaguered Marines, energizing his command. He was widely considered the U.S. Navy's most aggressive admiral, and with good reason. He set about assessing the situation to determine what actions were needed. Ghormley had been unsure of his command's ability to maintain the Marine toehold on Guadalcanal, and had been mindful of leaving them trapped there for a repeat of the [[Bataan Death March|Bataan Peninsula]] disaster. Halsey punctiliously made it clear he did not plan to withdraw the Marines. He not only intended to counter the Japanese efforts to dislodge them, he intended to secure the island. Above all else, he wanted to regain the initiative and take the fight to the Japanese. It was two days after Halsey had taken command in October 1942 that he gave an order that all naval officers in the South Pacific would dispense with wearing neckties with their tropical uniforms. As Richard Frank commented in his account of the Battle for Guadalcanal:\n{{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | Halsey said he gave this order to conform to Army practice and for comfort. To his command it viscerally evoked the image of a brawler stripping for action and symbolized a casting off of effete elegance no more appropriate to the tropics than to war.<ref>{{cite book |title=Guadalcanal: The Definitive Account of the Landmark Battle |author=Richard Frank |year=1990 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-016561-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/guadalcanal00rich }}</ref>}}\n\nHalsey led the South Pacific command through what was for the U.S. Navy the most tenuous phase of the war. Halsey committed his limited naval forces through a series of naval battles around Guadalcanal, including the carrier engagements of the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands]] and the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]]. These engagements checked the Japanese advance and drained their naval forces of carrier aircraft and pilots. [[File:Nimitz and Halsey 1943.jpg|thumb|left|Admirals Nimitz and Halsey discuss South Pacific strategy in early 1943.]] In November Halsey's willingness to place at risk his command's two fast battleships in the confined waters around Guadalcanal for a night engagement paid off with the U.S. Navy winning the [[Naval Battle of Guadalcanal]], the decisive naval engagement of the Guadalcanal campaign that doomed the Japanese garrison and wrested control from the Japanese.\n\nJapanese naval aviation proved to be formidable during the Solomon campaign.<ref>Seal, Jon, and Michael Ahn. {{cite web |url = http://www.microsoft.com/games/combatfs2/articles_foss.asp |title = An Interview with Joseph Jacob 'Joe' Foss. |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060209105228/http://www.microsoft.com/games/combatfs2/articles_foss.asp |archive-date=February 9, 2006 |df=mdy-all |publisher = [[Microsoft Games Studios]] |date=March 2000 |access-date=August 3, 2011 }}</ref>  In April 1943, Halsey assigned Admiral [[Marc Mitscher]] to Commander Air, [[Solomon Islands]] (ComAirSols) where he directed a mixed bag of Army, Navy, Marine and New Zealand aircraft in the airwar over Guadalcanal and up the Solomon chain.  Said Halsey: \"I knew we'd probably catch hell from the Japs in the air.  That's why I sent Pete Mitscher up there.  Pete was a fighting fool and I knew it.\"<ref>Taylor, p. 145.</ref>\n\nTypical for the period was an exchange that occurred between Halsey and one of his staff officers in June 1943. South Pacific Command was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive. As a part of the long view of winning the war taken by Nimitz, upon its arrival at Fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up, its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training. South Pacific command had been counting on the air group for their operations up the Solomon chain. The staff officer who brought the dispatch to Halsey remarked \"If they do that to us we will have to go on the defensive.\" The admiral turned to the speaker and replied: \"As long as I have one plane and one pilot, I will stay on the offensive.\"<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey'', p.&nbsp;221.</ref>\n\nHalsey's forces spent the rest of the year [[Solomon Islands campaign|battling]] up the [[Solomon Islands]] chain to [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]].  At Bougainville the Japanese had two airfields in the southern tip of the island, and another at the northern most peninsula, with a fourth on Buki just across the northern passage.  Here, instead of landing near the Japanese airfields and taking them away against the bulk of the Japanese defenders, Halsey landed his invasion force of 14,000 Marines in [[Empress Augusta Bay]], about halfway up the west coast of Bougainville.  There he had the Seabees clear and build their own airfield.  Two days after the landing, a large cruiser force was sent down from Japan to Rabaul in preparation for a night engagement against Halsey's screening force and supply ships in Empress Augusta Bay.  The Japanese had been conserving their naval forces over the past year, but now committed a force of seven heavy cruisers, along with one light cruiser and four destroyers.  At [[Rabaul]] the force refueled in preparation for the coming night battle. Halsey had no surface forces anywhere near equivalent strength to oppose them.  The battleships {{USS|Washington|BB-56|2}}, {{USS|South Dakota|BB-57|2}} and assorted cruisers had been transferred to the Central Pacific to support the upcoming invasion of Tarawa.  Other than the destroyer screen, the only force Halsey had available were the carrier airgroups on {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}} and {{USS|Princeton|CVL-23|2}}.  Rabaul was a heavily fortified port, with five airfields and extensive anti-aircraft batteries.  Other than the surprise raid at Pearl Harbor, no mission against such a target had ever been accomplished with carrier aircraft.  It was highly dangerous to the aircrews, and to the carriers as well.  With the landing in the balance, Halsey sent his two carriers to steam north through the night to get into range of Rabaul, then launch a daybreak raid on the base.  Aircraft from recently captured [[Vella Lavella]] were sent over to provide a combat air patrol over the carriers. All available aircraft from the two carriers were committed to the raid itself.  The [[Bombing of Rabaul (November 1943)|mission]] was a stunning success, so damaging the cruiser force at Rabaul as to make them no longer a threat.  Aircraft losses in the raid were light.  Halsey later described the threat to the landings as \"the most desperate emergency that confronted me in my entire term as ComSoPac.\"<ref>Potter, ''Admiral Arleigh Burke'', pp.&nbsp;98\u201399.</ref>\n\nFollowing the successful Bougainville operation, he then isolated and neutralized the Japanese naval stronghold at Rabaul by capturing surrounding positions in the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] in a series of amphibious landings known as [[Operation Cartwheel]]. This enabled the continuation of the drive north without the heavy fighting that would have been necessary to capture the base itself.  With the neutralization of Rabaul, major operations in the South Pacific Command came to a close.  With his determination and grit, Halsey had bolstered his command's resolve and seized the initiative from the Japanese until ships, aircraft and crews produced and trained in the States could arrive in 1943 and 1944 to tip the scales of the war in favor of the allies.<ref>Parshall and Tully, ''Shattered Sword'', pp. 416\u2013430.</ref>\n\n===Battles of the Central Pacific===\n[[File:VAdm John S.

McCain Sr.]] on board Halsey's flagship, {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62|6}} in December 1944]]As the war progressed it moved out of the South Pacific and into the Central Pacific. Halsey's command shifted with it, and in May 1944 he was promoted to commanding officer of the newly formed [[U.S. Third Fleet|Third Fleet]]. He commanded actions from the [[Philippines]] to Japan. From September 1944 to January 1945, he led the campaigns to take the [[Palaus]], [[Leyte (island)|Leyte]] and [[Luzon]], and on many raids on Japanese bases, including off the shores of Formosa, China, and Vietnam.\n\nBy this point in the conflict the U.S. Navy was doing things the Japanese high command had not thought possible. The [[Fast Carrier Task Force]] was able to bring to battle enough air power to overpower land based aircraft and dominate whatever area the fleet was operating in. Moreover, the Navy's ability to establish [[USS Cascade (AD-16)#Service Squadron 4 and Service Squadron 10|forward operating ports]] as they did at [[Majuro#History|Majuro]], [[Enewetak Atoll#History|Enewetak]] and [[Ulithi#History|Ulithi]], and their ability to convoy supplies out to the combat task forces, allowed the fleet to operate for extended periods of time far out to sea in the central and western Pacific. The Japanese Navy conserved itself in port and would sortie in force to engage the enemy. The U.S. Navy remained at sea and on station, dominating whatever region it entered. The size of the Pacific Ocean, which Japanese planners had thought would limit the U.S. Navy's ability to operate in the western Pacific, would not be adequate to protect Japan.\n\nCommand of the \"big blue fleet\" was alternated with [[Raymond Spruance]].{{NoteTag|The \"Big Blue Fleet\" was the name given to the main fleet of the US Navy in the Pacific.  The term stems from pre-war planning, called the color plans because each nation included was given a color code name. In these potential plans the British navy was red, the German navy black, and so forth. The Imperial Japanese Navy was termed the \"Orange Fleet\".  The U.S. fleet was the \"Blue Fleet\".  The \"Big Blue Fleet\" was the massive fleet that the U.S. Navy anticipated they would win the war with.  It was thought this fleet would largely come into being by late 1943, early 1944.<ref name=\"Potter p. 112\" />}}  Under Spruance the fleet designation was the [[U.S. Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleet]] and the Fast Carrier Task Force was designated \"Task Force 58\". Under Halsey the fleet was designated Third Fleet and the Fast Carrier Task Force was designated \"Task Force 38\".<ref name=\"Potter p. 112\" /> The split command structure was intended to confuse the Japanese and created a higher tempo of operations. While Spruance was at sea operating the fleet, Halsey and his staff, self-dubbed the \"Department of Dirty Tricks\", would be planning the next series of operations.<ref>Cutler, ''The Battle of Leyte Gulf'', p. 209.</ref> The two admirals were a contrast in styles. Halsey was aggressive and a risk taker. Spruance was calculating, professional and cautious.

Halsey's plans assumed the Japanese fleet or a major portion of it would challenge the effort, creating an opportunity to engage it decisively. Halsey directed the Third Fleet \"will seek the enemy and attempt to bring about a decisive engagement if he undertakes operations beyond support of superior land based air forces.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/9fe423c2-9276-41c7-be29-04260b8a04c3/Replacing-Battleships-with-Aircraft-Carriers-in-th|last=Hone|first=Thomas|title=Replacing Battleships with Aircraft Carriers in the Pacific in World War II|work=Naval War College Review|date=Winter 2013 |accessdate=April 11, 2017|p=71}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the invasion, the Japanese launched their final major naval effort, an operation known as 'Sho-Go', involving almost all their surviving fleet. It was aimed at destroying the invasion shipping in the [[Leyte Gulf]]. The Northern Force of Admiral Ozawa was built around the remaining Japanese aircraft carriers, now weakened by the heavy loss of trained pilots. The Northern Force was meant to lure the covering U.S. forces away from the Gulf while two surface battle-groups, the Center Force and the Southern Force, were to break through to the beachhead and attack the invasion shipping. These forces were built around the remaining strength of the Japanese Navy, and comprised a total of 7 battleships and 16 cruisers. The operation brought about the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Battle for Leyte Gulf]], the largest naval battle of the Second World War and, by some criteria, the [[largest naval battle in history]].\n\nThe Center Force commanded by Vice Admiral [[Takeo Kurita]] was located October 23 coming through the Palawan Passage by two American submarines, which [[Battle of Leyte Gulf#The submarine action in Palawan Passage .2823 October.29|attacked the force]], sinking two heavy cruisers and damaging a third. The following day Third Fleet's aircraft carriers launched strikes against Kurita's Center Force, [[Battle of the Sibuyan Sea|sinking]] the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}} and damaging the heavy cruiser {{ship|Japanese cruiser|My\u014dk\u014d||2}}, causing the force to turn westward back towards its base. Kurita appeared to be retiring but he later reversed course and headed back into the [[San Bernardino Strait]]. At this point Ozawa's Northern Force was located by Third Fleet scout aircraft. Halsey made the momentous decision to take all available strength northwards to destroy the Japanese carrier forces, planning to strike them at dawn of October 25. He considered leaving a battle group behind to guard the strait, and made tentative plans to do so, but he felt he would also have to leave one of his three carrier groups to provide air cover, weakening his chance to crush the remaining Japanese carrier forces. The entire Third Fleet steamed northward. San Bernardino Strait was effectively left unguarded by any major surface fleet.\n\n====Battle off Samar====\nIn moving Third Fleet northwards, Halsey failed to advise Admiral [[Thomas C. Kinkaid|Thomas Kinkaid]] of Seventh Fleet of his decision. Seventh Fleet intercepts of organizational messages from Halsey to his own task group commanders seemed to indicate that Halsey had formed a task force and detached it to protect the San Bernardino Strait, but this was not the case. Kinkaid and his staff failed to confirm this with Halsey, and neither had confirmed this with Nimitz.\n\nDespite aerial reconnaissance reports on the night of October 24\u201325 of Kurita's Center Force in the San Bernardino Strait, Halsey continued to take Third Fleet northwards, away from Leyte Gulf.\n\n[[File:Halsey Mccain.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Halsey with Vice Admiral [[John S. McCain Sr.]]]]\n\nWhen Kurita's Center Force emerged from the San Bernardino Strait on the morning of October 25, there was nothing to oppose them except a small force of escort carriers and screening destroyers and [[destroyer escort]]s, Task Unit 77.4.3 \"Taffy 3\", which had been tasked and armed to attack troops on land and guard against submarines, not oppose the largest enemy surface fleet since the battle of Midway, led by the largest battleship in the world. Advancing down the coast of the island of Samar towards the troop transports and support ships of the Leyte Gulf landing, they took Seventh Fleet's escort carriers and their screening ships entirely by surprise.\n\nIn the desperate [[Battle off Samar]] which followed, Kurita's ships destroyed one of the escort carriers and three ships of the carriers' screen, and damaged a number of other ships as well. The remarkable resistance of the screening ships of Taffy 3 against Kurita's battle-group remains one of the most heroic feats in the history of the US Navy. Their efforts and those of the several hundred aircraft that the escort carriers could put up, many of whom, however could not be armed with the most effective ordinance to deal with heavy surface ships in time, took a heavy toll on Kurita's ships and convinced him that he was facing a stronger force than was the case. Mistaking the escort carriers for Halsey's fleet carriers, and fearing entrapment from the six battleships of the Third Fleet battleship group, he decided to withdraw back through the San Bernardino Strait and to the west without achieving his objective of disrupting the Leyte landing.\n\nWhen the Seventh Fleet's escort carriers found themselves under attack from the Center Force, Halsey began to receive a succession of desperate calls from Kinkaid asking for immediate assistance off Samar. For over two hours Halsey turned a deaf ear to these calls. Then, shortly after 10:00 hours,<ref name=\"Willmott\">{{cite book |last=Willmott|first=H.

The world wonders\". The tail end of this message, [[The world wonders]], was intended as padding designed to confuse enemy decoders, but was mistakenly left in the message when it was handed to Halsey. The urgent inquiry had seemingly become a stinging rebuke. The fiery Halsey threw his hat on the deck of the bridge and began cursing.<ref name=\"Willmott\"/> Finally Halsey's Chief of Staff, Rear Admiral [[Robert Carney|Robert \"Mick\" Carney]], confronted him, telling Halsey \"Stop it! What the hell's the matter with you? Pull yourself together.\"<ref name=\"Books: The General and the Admiral\"/>\n\nHalsey cooled but continued to steam Third Fleet northward to close on Ozawa's Northern Force for a full hour after receiving the signal from Nimitz.<ref name=\"Willmott\"/> Then, Halsey ordered Task Force 34 south. As Task Force 34 proceeded south they were further delayed when the battle force had to slow to 12 knots so that the battleships could refuel their escorting destroyers. The refueling cost a two and a half hour further delay.<ref name=\"Willmott\"/> By the time Task Force 34 arrived at the scene it was too late to assist the Seventh Fleet's escort carrier groups. Kurita had already decided to retire and had left the area. A single straggling destroyer was caught by Halsey's advance cruisers and destroyers, but the rest of Kurita's force was able to escape.\n\nMeanwhile the major part Third Fleet continued to close on Ozawa's Northern Force, which included one fleet carrier (the last surviving Japanese carrier of the six that had attacked Pearl Harbor) and three light carriers. The [[Battle off Cape Enga\u00f1o]] resulted in Halsey's Third Fleet sinking all four of Ozawa's carriers.\n\nThe same attributes that made Halsey an invaluable leader in the desperate early months of the war, his desire to bring the fight to the enemy, his willingness to take on a gamble, worked against him in the later stages of the war. Halsey received much criticism for his decisions during the battle, with naval historian [[Samuel Eliot Morison|Samuel Morison]] terming the Third Fleet run to the north \"Halsey's Blunder.\"<ref>Potter, ''Bull Halsey'', pp. 376\u2013380.</ref> However, the destruction of the Japanese carriers had been an important goal up to that point, and the Leyte landings were still successful despite Halsey falling for the Japanese Navy's decoy.\n\n=== Halsey's Typhoon ===\n{{Main|Typhoon Cobra (1944)}}\n\n[[File:USS Langley (CVL-27) during Typhoon Cobra, December 1944.jpg|thumb|right|{{USS|Langley|CVL-27|6}} struggles in Typhoon Cobra.]]\n\nAfter the Leyte Gulf engagement, December found the Third Fleet confronted with another powerful enemy in the form of [[Typhoon Cobra]], which was dubbed \"Halsey's Typhoon\" by many.\n\nWhile conducting operations off the Philippines, the fleet had to discontinue refueling due to a Pacific storm. Rather than move Third Fleet away, Halsey chose to remain on station for another day. In fairness, he received conflicting information from Pearl Harbor and his own staff. The Hawaiian weathermen predicted a northerly path for the storm, which would have cleared Task Force 38 by some {{convert|200|mi|km|spell=in}}. Eventually his own staff provided a prediction regarding the direction of the storm that was far closer to the mark with a westerly direction. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/william-bull-halsey-legendary-world-war-ii-admiral.htm |title=William Bull Halsey: Legendary World War II Admiral |author=Barrett Tillman |work=historynet.com |date=July 2007}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Halsey played the odds, declining to cancel planned operations and requiring the ships of Third Fleet to hold formation. On the evening of December 17 Third Fleet was unable to land its combat air patrol due to the pitching and rolling decks of the carriers. All the aircraft were ditched in the ocean and lost, but the pilots were all saved by accompanying destroyers. By 10:00&nbsp;a.m. the next morning the barometer on the flagship was noted to be dropping precipitously. With increasingly heavy seas the fleet still attempted to maintain stations. The threat was greatest to the fleet's destroyers, which did not have the fuel reserves of the larger ships and were running dangerously low. Finally, at 11:49&nbsp;a.m., Halsey issued the order for the ships of the fleet to take the most comfortable course available to them. Many of the smaller ships had already been forced to do so. \n\nBetween 11:00&nbsp;a.m. and 2:00&nbsp;p.m., the typhoon did its worst damage, tossing the ships in {{convert|70|ft|m|adj=on|0}} waves. The barometer continued to drop and the wind roared at {{convert|83|kn|kph|lk=in|0}} with gusts well over {{convert|100|kn|kph|0}}. At 1:45&nbsp;p.m. Halsey issued a typhoon warning to Fleet Weather Central. By this time Third Fleet had lost three of its destroyers. By the time the storm had cleared the next day a great many ships in the fleet had been damaged, 146 aircraft were destroyed and 802 seamen had been lost. For the next three days Third Fleet conducted search and rescue operations, finally retiring to [[Ulithi]] on 22 December 1944.\n\nFollowing the typhoon a Navy court of inquiry was convened on board {{USS|Cascade|AD-16|6}} in the Naval base at Ulithi. Admiral Nimitz, CINCPAC, was in attendance at the court. Forty-three-year-old Captain Herbert K. Gates, of ''Cascade'', was the Judge Advocate.<ref>Drury.</ref> The inquiry found that though Halsey had committed an error of judgement in sailing the Third Fleet into the heart of the typhoon, it stopped short of unambiguously recommending sanction.<ref name=\"Melton, Sea Cobra\">Melton, ''Sea Cobra''.</ref> The events surrounding Typhoon Cobra were similar to those the Japanese navy had faced some nine years earlier in what they termed \"[[4th Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)#The Fourth Fleet incident|The Fourth Fleet Incident]].\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Kaigun: Strategy, Tactics and Technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy 1887\u20131941 |last1=Evans |first1=David |last2=Peattie |first2=Mark|publisher=Naval Institute Press |page=243 |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-87021-192-8}}</ref>\n\n===End of the war===\n[[File:Nimitz missouri.jpg|thumb|Fleet Admiral Nimitz signing the documents of surrender on board USS ''Missouri''. Behind him stand Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Rear Adm. Forrest Sherman, and Halsey (''middle'').]]\nDuring January 1945 the Third Fleet attacked Formosa and Luzon, and [[South China Sea raid|raided the South China Sea]] in support of the landing of US Army forces on Luzon. At the conclusion of this operation, Halsey passed command of the ships that made up Third Fleet to Admiral Spruance on January 26, whereupon its designation changed to [[United States Fifth Fleet#History|Fifth Fleet]]. Returning home Halsey was asked about General MacArthur, who was not the easiest man to work with, and vied with the Navy over the conduct and management of the war in the Pacific.<ref>Willmott, pp. 178\u2013181.</ref> Halsey had worked well with MacArthur and did not mind saying so. When a reporter asked Halsey if he thought MacArthur's fleet (7th Fleet) would get to Tokyo first, the admiral grinned and answered \"We're going there together.\"  Then seriously he added \"He's a very fine man. I have worked under him for over two years and have the greatest admiration and respect for him.\"<ref>''Utica Daily Press'', February 20, 1945.</ref>\n\nSpruance held command of Fifth Fleet until May, when command returned to Halsey. In early June 1945 the Third Fleet again sailed through the path of [[Typhoon Connie]]. On this occasion, six men were swept overboard and lost, along with 75 airplanes lost or destroyed, with another 70 badly damaged. Though some ships sustained significant damage, none were lost.  A Navy court of inquiry was again convened, this time recommending that Halsey be reassigned, but Admiral Nimitz declined to abide by this recommendation, citing Halsey's prior service record, despite that record including a previous instance of negligently sailing his fleet through a typhoon.<ref name=\"Melton, Sea Cobra\" />\n\nHalsey led Third Fleet through the final stages of the war, striking targets on the Japanese homeland itself. Third Fleet aircraft conducted attacks upon Tokyo, the [[Bombing of Kure (July 1945)|naval base at Kure]] and the northern Japanese island of [[Hokkaid\u014d]], and Third Fleet battleships engaged in the [[Allied naval bombardments of Japan during World War II|bombardment of a number of Japanese coastal cities]] in preparation for an invasion of Japan, which ultimately never had to be undertaken.\n\nAfter the cessation of hostilities, Halsey, still aggressively cautious of Japanese kamikaze attacks, ordered Third Fleet to maintain a protective air cover with the following communiqu\u00e9: {{Quote | style=font-size: 100%; | Cessation of hostilities.<br />War is over. <br />If any Japanese airplanes appear, shoot them down in a friendly way.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Caviar and Commissars: the Experience of a US Naval Officer in Stalin's Russia |author=Kemp Tolley |page=245|publisher=Naval Institute Press |year=1983 |isbn=978-1-55750-407-4}}</ref>}}\nHe was present when [[Surrender of Japan|Japan formally surrendered]] on the deck of his [[flagship]], {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}, on September 2, 1945.\n\n==Postwar years==\n[[File:Halsey.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Halsey]]\nImmediately after the surrender of Japan, 54 ships of the Third Fleet returned to the United States, with Halsey's four-star flag flying from USS ''South Dakota'', for the annual Navy Day Celebrations in San Francisco on October 27, 1945. He hauled down his flag on 22 November 1945, and was assigned special duty in the office of the Secretary of the Navy. On December 11, 1945, he took the oath as [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]], becoming the fourth and still the most recent naval officer awarded that rank. Halsey made a goodwill flying trip, passing by [[Central America|Central]] and South America, covering nearly {{convert|28,000|mi}} and 11 nations. He retired from active service in March 1947, but as a Fleet Admiral, he was not taken off active duty status.\n\nHalsey was asked about the weapons used to win the war and he answered:\n{{Quote | style = font-size: 100%; | If I had to give credit to the instruments and machines that won us the war in the Pacific, I would rate them in this order: submarines first, radar second, planes third, bulldozers fourth.<ref>{{cite book |title = Admiral Halsey's Story |first=William |last=Halsey |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1947|page=69 |isbn = 978-1-4367-1143-2 }}</ref>}}\n\nHalsey joined the New Jersey Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]] in 1946. Upon retirement, he joined the board of two subsidiaries of the [[International Telephone and Telegraph Company]], including the [[American Cable and Radio Corporation]], and served until 1957. He maintained an office near the top of the ITT Building at 67 Broad Street, New York City in the late 1950s. He was involved in a number of efforts to preserve his former flagship {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} as a memorial in [[New York Harbor]]. They proved fruitless, as it was not possible to secure sufficient funding to preserve the ship.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Fleet Admiral William Frederick Halsey Jr. (19351365942).jpg|thumb|Halsey's grave at Arlington National Cemetery]]\n\nHalsey died on August 16, 1959, while on holiday on [[Fishers Island, New York]].<ref name=mjapobt>{{cite news |url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=c9cjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wyUEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7080%2C3200658 |work=Milwaukee Journal |agency=Associated Press |title=Admiral Halsey dies; beat Japanese fleet |date=August 17, 1959 |page=4, part 1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.kxmb.com/News/418118.asp |title = Following Advance for Use Sunday, Aug. 16 &#124; |website = KXNet.com North Dakota News }}</ref> After lying in state in the [[Washington National Cathedral]], he was interred on August 20, 1959, near his parents in [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

Tora! Tora!]]''; by [[Robert Mitchum]] in the 1976 film, ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'', and by [[Dennis Quaid]] in the 2019 film ''[[Midway (2019 film)|Midway]]''.\n* Halsey makes a brief appearance in [[Herman Wouk]]'s novel ''[[The Winds of War]]'', and has a more substantial supporting role in the sequel ''[[War and Remembrance]]''. Wouk was extremely critical of Halsey's handling of the battle at Leyte Gulf, but also said he was too great a builder of naval morale to be retired in disgrace.  (Chapter 92)  Halsey was portrayed in the 1983 television [[miniseries]] adaptation of ''The Winds of War'' by [[Richard X. Slattery]], and in the 1988 miniseries adaptation of ''War and Remembrance'' by [[Pat Hingle]].\n* Halsey has been portrayed in a number of other films and TV miniseries, played by [[Glenn Morshower]] ([[Pearl Harbor (film)|''Pearl Harbor'']], 2001), [[Kenneth Tobey]] (''[[MacArthur (film)|MacArthur]]'', 1977), [[Jack Diamond (actor)|Jack Diamond]] (''[[Battle Stations (1956 film)|Battle Stations]]'', 1956), [[John Maxwell (actor)|John Maxwell]], (''[[The Eternal Sea]]'', 1955) and [[Morris Ankrum]] (''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'', 1944).\n* An \"Admiral Halsey\" is mentioned in the [[Paul McCartney|Paul]] and [[Linda McCartney]] song \"[[Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey]]\". The chorus of \"hands across the water, heads across the sky\" was a reference to the American aid programs of World War II. McCartney later specified that the second half of the song was indeed in honor of William Halsey.<ref>{{cite book |last=McGee |first=Garry |year=2003 |title=Band on the Run: A History of Paul McCartney and Wings |publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing |location=New York |page=196 |isbn=0-87833-304-5}}</ref>\n* On March 4, 1951, Halsey appeared as a mystery guest on episode No. 40 of the game show, ''[[What's My Line]]'', where the panel correctly deduced his identity.<ref>{{cite web |work=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/whats-my-line/episode-40/episode/92668/summary.html# |title=Episode No. 40 Summary}}</ref>\n* In the television series, ''[[McHale's Navy]]'', one of Captain Binghampton's catchphrases whenever he would get frustrated with one of McHale's schemes was, \"What in the name of Halsey is going on here?\"\n* Halsey is mentioned in the 1990 film ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]''. Soviet submarine commander Marko Ramius, while engaged in battle with the Soviet attack submarine ''Konovalov'', asks [[Jack Ryan (Tom Clancy character)|Jack Ryan]] what books he wrote for the CIA. Ryan mentions one about Admiral Halsey, entitled ''The Fighting Sailor'' (not to be confused with a real book of the same title); Ramius reveals his awareness of the book and expresses disdain for Ryan's assessment of Halsey, saying, \"Your conclusions were all wrong, Ryan. Halsey acted stupidly.\"\n* The fictional aircraft carrier USS ''William Halsey'' in [[Darren Sapp]]'s novel, ''[[Fire on the Flight Deck]]'', is named for Halsey.\n* On May 30, 2018, he was added as an unlockable unique commander for the United States Navy in the videogame [[World of Warships]].\n* A character in [[Seth MacFarlane]]'s ''[[The Orville]]'' is named Admiral Halsey, presumably after Admiral Halsey.\n* Halsey appears as a purchasable general in the Easytech mobile game ''[[World Conqueror 4]]''.\n\n\u2022   In ''Bridge over the River Kwai'', William Holden feigning madness replies, \u201cI'm getting worse, you know. Sometimes I think I'm Admiral Halsey.\u201d\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Biography|World War II|World War I}}\n* [[List of Fleet and Grand Admirals]]\n* [[List of United States military leaders by rank]]\n* [[List of military figures by nickname]]\n* [[Gene Markey]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last =  Borneman |first = Walter R. |title = The Admirals: Nimitz, Halsey, Leahy and King \u2013 The Five-Star Admirals Who Won the War at Sea |location = New York, NY |publisher = Little, Brown and Company |year = 2012 | isbn = 978-0-316-09784-0 }}\n* {{cite book |last = Buell |first = Thomas B. |year=1974 |title = The Quiet Warrior, A Biography of Raymond A.

His works often deal with the extremes of human experience, from death and degradation to religious exaltation. His name, '''Michel de Ghelderode''', is a pseudonym, he was born Ad\u00e9mar Adolphe Louis Martens. He wrote plays and short stories, and was a noted letter writer.<ref>B\u00e9d\u00e9, Jean Albert. Edgerton, William Benbow. \"Ghelderode, Michel de\".  ''Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature''. Columbia University Press (1980)  pp. 302-303. {{ISBN|9780231037174}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nGhelderode's father, Henri-Louis Martens, was employed as a royal archivist, a line of work later to be pursued by young Ghelderode. The author's mother, n\u00e9e Jeanne-Marie Rans, was a former postulant for holy orders; even after bearing four children, of whom Ghelderode was the youngest, she retained evident traces of her erstwhile vocation that would strongly influence the mature Ghelderode's dramatic work: One of Mme Martens's remembered \"spiritual tales,\" concerning a child mistakenly buried alive who remained strangely marked by death even after her rescue, inspired most of the plot and characters of Ghelderode's ''Mademoiselle Jaire'' (1934) written when the author was in his mid-thirties.\n\nHe was in military service from 1919 \u2013 1921 and in 1924 married Jeanne-Fran\u00e7oise G\u00e9rard (d. 1980).\n\nGhelderode became increasingly reclusive from 1930 onwards and was chronically ill with asthma during his late thirties. Frequently suffering from poor health, around the age of sixteen, while pursuing his studies at the Institut St.-Louis in Brussels, he fell gravely ill with typhus. He would retain for the rest of his life the vision of \"a Lady\" who materialized at his bedside to utter the words, \"not now, sixty-three.\" Ghelderode in fact died two days short of what would have been his sixty-fourth birthday in 1962. He is buried in the [[Laeken Cemetery]], Brussels.\n\n==Influences==\nGhelderode\u2019s ideas and vision of the theatre is in remarkable accord with ideas [[Antonin Artaud]] expressed in his manifesto ''[[The Theatre and Its Double]]''.  Both men saw theatre as having the potential to express the human unconscious with its dream-like hallucinatory images and dynamic appetites.  And both Artaud and Ghelderode found inspiration in the fantastical, dream-like images and ideas found in the works of the Flemish painters [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Brueghel]].<ref>Hellman, Helen. \"Hallucination and Cruelty in Artaud and Ghelderode\".

''The French Review''. Vol. 41, No. 1 (Oct., 1967), pp. 1-10. </ref>\n\nGhelderode's influences include [[puppet]] theater, Italian [[commedia dell'arte]], the medieval world of Flanders, the Flemish painters [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]], [[Jacob Jordaens]] and the [[Teniers]], along with the Belgian artist [[James Ensor]], painter of the macabre, and the novelist [[Georges Eekhoud]].\n\n==Career==\n\nA prolific writer, Ghelderode wrote more than 60 plays, a hundred stories, a number of articles on art and folklore and more than 20,000 letters.\n\nHe began writing plays in French in 1916. ''La mort regarde \u00e0 la fen\u00eatre'' (Death Looks In at the Window) was produced in 1918, followed by ''Le repas des fauves'' (The Beasts' Meal) in 1919. In 1921 and 1922 he was a professor at the Institut Dupuich but resigned because of ill health. The following year he worked as a bookseller. In 1923 Ghelderode earned the post of archives editor in the Communale de Schaerbeek, where he worked in a variety of capacities until 1945. In 1924 he began contributing to such publications as ''La Flandre litt\u00e9raire'' and ''La Renaissance d'Occident'' and wrote plays for the puppet theater ''Les Marionnettes de la Renaissance d'Occident''. Ghelderode began staging plays again in 1925, working with the Dutch producer Johan de Meester, a collaboration which lasted until 1930. ''Escurial'' (1927) is one of his most frequently performed plays. Widely recognized as one of his finest achievements, it exhibits [[German Expressionism]] and [[Symbolist]] influences. He wrote ''Pantagleize'' (1929) expressly for the Flemish comedian Renaat Verheyen, who died aged twenty-six, shortly after appearing in the title role.\n\nGhelderode completely gave up writing plays in 1939. Between 1946 and 1953 he wrote for ''Le Journal de Bruges''. A 1949 production of ''Fastes d'enfer'' (Chronicles of Hell), originally written in 1929, caused a huge scandal on its opening night, an event that ensured his popularity.\n\n==Themes and style==\n\nHe is the creator of a fantastic and disturbing, often macabre, grotesque and cruel world filled with [[mannequins]], puppets, devils, masks, [[skeletons]], religious paraphernalia, and mysterious old women. His works create an eerie and unsettling atmosphere although they rarely contain anything explicitly scary.\n\nA strong anticlerical streak runs through many of Ghelderode's plays, mitigated by a spirituality which stops short of true belief. Throughout Ghelderode's theatrical universe, religion is more often honored than adhered to. Sensuality is another dominant characteristic prominent in almost all of Ghelderode's plays, often in unattractive forms. Gluttony and heavy drinking loom large, as does lust, often represented by hag-like female characters with suggestive names.\n\nAccording to Oscar G. Brockett, the works of Ghelderode resemble those of [[Alfred Jarry]], the surrealists and the expressionists, and his theories are similar to those of [[Antonin Artaud]]. Through nearly all of his plays runs his perception of human beings as creatures whose flesh overpowers spirit. \"Corruption, death and cruelty are always near the surface [of Ghelderode's work], although behind them lurks an implied criticism of degradation and materialism and a call to repentance \"<ref>Beockett, Oscar Gross, History of the Theatre/ Oscar G. Brockett, Franklin J. Hildy.-9th ed. Copyright 2003 Pearson Education Group, Inc.</ref>\n\nGhelderode was one of the first dramatists to exploit the idea of total theatre\u2014that is, drama in which every sort of appeal is made to the eye, the ear, and the emotions in order to stir the intellect. As a pioneer of total theatre, Ghelderode exerted a powerful influence on the history of the French theatre. Although many of his plays have since been translated into English, his works are infrequently performed in English-speaking countries. Writing in October 1957 on the occasion of the first of his plays to be seen publicly in England, Ghelderode declared \u2013\n\n:''The moral of this sad story \u2013 and the story of man is always sad, absurd, and void of meaning, as Shakespeare wrote \u2013 it is that in our atomic and auto-disintegrated age, this age from which dreams and dreamers are banished in favor of the scientific nightmare and the beneficiaries of the future horror, a fellow like Pantagleize remains an [[archetype]], an exemplary man and a fine example who has nothing to do with that dangerous thing, intelligence, and a great deal to do with that savior, instinct. He is human in an age when all is becoming dehumanized. He is the last poet, and the poet is he who believes in heavenly voices, in revelation, in our divine origin. He is the man who has kept the treasure of his childhood in his heart, and who passes through all catastrophes in all artlessness. He is bound by purity to [[Parsifal]] and to [[Don Quixote]] by courage and holy madness. and if he dies, it is because particularly in our time, the Innocents must be slaughtered: that has been the law since the time of Jesus. Amen !....'' <ref>Seven Plays including ''Pantagleize'', translated and with an Introduction by George Hauger. MacGibbon & Kee 1960</ref>\n\nAlso in 1957 Luc de Heusch and Jean Raine made a 22-minute film about Ghelderode. He finally appears near its end, in the location of the Theatre Royale de Toone, the sixth and last in a dynasty of marionette theatres in Brussels.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\nGhelderode's ''La Balade du grand macabre'' (1934) served as libretto for [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]]'s opera ''[[Le Grand Macabre]]'' (1974\u201377.

His works often deal with the extremes of human experience, from death and degradation to religious exaltation. His name, '''Michel de Ghelderode''', is a pseudonym, he was born Ad\u00e9mar Adolphe Louis Martens. He wrote plays and short stories, and was a noted letter writer.<ref>B\u00e9d\u00e9, Jean Albert. Edgerton, William Benbow. \"Ghelderode, Michel de\".  ''Columbia Dictionary of Modern European Literature''. Columbia University Press (1980)  pp. 302-303. {{ISBN|9780231037174}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\nGhelderode's father, Henri-Louis Martens, was employed as a royal archivist, a line of work later to be pursued by young Ghelderode. The author's mother, n\u00e9e Jeanne-Marie Rans, was a former postulant for holy orders; even after bearing four children, of whom Ghelderode was the youngest, she retained evident traces of her erstwhile vocation that would strongly influence the mature Ghelderode's dramatic work: One of Mme Martens's remembered \"spiritual tales,\" concerning a child mistakenly buried alive who remained strangely marked by death even after her rescue, inspired most of the plot and characters of Ghelderode's ''Mademoiselle Jaire'' (1934) written when the author was in his mid-thirties.\n\nHe was in military service from 1919 \u2013 1921 and in 1924 married Jeanne-Fran\u00e7oise G\u00e9rard (d. 1980).\n\nGhelderode became increasingly reclusive from 1930 onwards and was chronically ill with asthma during his late thirties. Frequently suffering from poor health, around the age of sixteen, while pursuing his studies at the Institut St.-Louis in Brussels, he fell gravely ill with typhus. He would retain for the rest of his life the vision of \"a Lady\" who materialized at his bedside to utter the words, \"not now, sixty-three.\" Ghelderode in fact died two days short of what would have been his sixty-fourth birthday in 1962. He is buried in the [[Laeken Cemetery]], Brussels.\n\n==Influences==\nGhelderode\u2019s ideas and vision of the theatre is in remarkable accord with ideas [[Antonin Artaud]] expressed in his manifesto ''[[The Theatre and Its Double]]''.  Both men saw theatre as having the potential to express the human unconscious with its dream-like hallucinatory images and dynamic appetites.  And both Artaud and Ghelderode found inspiration in the fantastical, dream-like images and ideas found in the works of the Flemish painters [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Brueghel]].<ref>Hellman, Helen. \"Hallucination and Cruelty in Artaud and Ghelderode\". ''The French Review''. Vol. 41, No. 1 (Oct., 1967), pp. 1-10. </ref> Ghelderode referred to Brueghel as his \"p\u00e8re nourricier\" (foster father), wrote plays closely based on Brueghel\u2019s paintings,<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1124990 ] Hauger, George.

''The French Review''. Vol. 41, No. 1 (Oct., 1967), pp. 1-10. </ref>\n\nGhelderode's influences include [[puppet]] theater, Italian [[commedia dell'arte]], the medieval world of Flanders, the Flemish painters [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]], [[Jacob Jordaens]] and the [[Teniers]], along with the Belgian artist [[James Ensor]], painter of the macabre, and the novelist [[Georges Eekhoud]].\n\n==Career==\n\nA prolific writer, Ghelderode wrote more than 60 plays, a hundred stories, a number of articles on art and folklore and more than 20,000 letters.\n\nHe began writing plays in French in 1916. ''La mort regarde \u00e0 la fen\u00eatre'' (Death Looks In at the Window) was produced in 1918, followed by ''Le repas des fauves'' (The Beasts' Meal) in 1919. In 1921 and 1922 he was a professor at the Institut Dupuich but resigned because of ill health. The following year he worked as a bookseller. In 1923 Ghelderode earned the post of archives editor in the Communale de Schaerbeek, where he worked in a variety of capacities until 1945. In 1924 he began contributing to such publications as ''La Flandre litt\u00e9raire'' and ''La Renaissance d'Occident'' and wrote plays for the puppet theater ''Les Marionnettes de la Renaissance d'Occident''. Ghelderode began staging plays again in 1925, working with the Dutch producer Johan de Meester, a collaboration which lasted until 1930. ''Escurial'' (1927) is one of his most frequently performed plays. Widely recognized as one of his finest achievements, it exhibits [[German Expressionism]] and [[Symbolist]] influences. He wrote ''Pantagleize'' (1929) expressly for the Flemish comedian Renaat Verheyen, who died aged twenty-six, shortly after appearing in the title role.\n\nGhelderode completely gave up writing plays in 1939. Between 1946 and 1953 he wrote for ''Le Journal de Bruges''. A 1949 production of ''Fastes d'enfer'' (Chronicles of Hell), originally written in 1929, caused a huge scandal on its opening night, an event that ensured his popularity.\n\n==Themes and style==\n\nHe is the creator of a fantastic and disturbing, often macabre, grotesque and cruel world filled with [[mannequins]], puppets, devils, masks, [[skeletons]], religious paraphernalia, and mysterious old women. His works create an eerie and unsettling atmosphere although they rarely contain anything explicitly scary.\n\nA strong anticlerical streak runs through many of Ghelderode's plays, mitigated by a spirituality which stops short of true belief. Throughout Ghelderode's theatrical universe, religion is more often honored than adhered to. Sensuality is another dominant characteristic prominent in almost all of Ghelderode's plays, often in unattractive forms. Gluttony and heavy drinking loom large, as does lust, often represented by hag-like female characters with suggestive names.\n\nAccording to Oscar G. Brockett, the works of Ghelderode resemble those of [[Alfred Jarry]], the surrealists and the expressionists, and his theories are similar to those of [[Antonin Artaud]]. Through nearly all of his plays runs his perception of human beings as creatures whose flesh overpowers spirit. \"Corruption, death and cruelty are always near the surface [of Ghelderode's work], although behind them lurks an implied criticism of degradation and materialism and a call to repentance \"<ref>Beockett, Oscar Gross, History of the Theatre/ Oscar G. Brockett, Franklin J. Hildy.-9th ed. Copyright 2003 Pearson Education Group, Inc.</ref>\n\nGhelderode was one of the first dramatists to exploit the idea of total theatre\u2014that is, drama in which every sort of appeal is made to the eye, the ear, and the emotions in order to stir the intellect. As a pioneer of total theatre, Ghelderode exerted a powerful influence on the history of the French theatre. Although many of his plays have since been translated into English, his works are infrequently performed in English-speaking countries. Writing in October 1957 on the occasion of the first of his plays to be seen publicly in England, Ghelderode declared \u2013\n\n:''The moral of this sad story \u2013 and the story of man is always sad, absurd, and void of meaning, as Shakespeare wrote \u2013 it is that in our atomic and auto-disintegrated age, this age from which dreams and dreamers are banished in favor of the scientific nightmare and the beneficiaries of the future horror, a fellow like Pantagleize remains an [[archetype]], an exemplary man and a fine example who has nothing to do with that dangerous thing, intelligence, and a great deal to do with that savior, instinct. He is human in an age when all is becoming dehumanized. He is the last poet, and the poet is he who believes in heavenly voices, in revelation, in our divine origin. He is the man who has kept the treasure of his childhood in his heart, and who passes through all catastrophes in all artlessness. He is bound by purity to [[Parsifal]] and to [[Don Quixote]] by courage and holy madness. and if he dies, it is because particularly in our time, the Innocents must be slaughtered: that has been the law since the time of Jesus. Amen !....'' <ref>Seven Plays including ''Pantagleize'', translated and with an Introduction by George Hauger. MacGibbon & Kee 1960</ref>\n\nAlso in 1957 Luc de Heusch and Jean Raine made a 22-minute film about Ghelderode. He finally appears near its end, in the location of the Theatre Royale de Toone, the sixth and last in a dynasty of marionette theatres in Brussels.\n\n==Adaptations==\n\nGhelderode's ''La Balade du grand macabre'' (1934) served as libretto for [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]]'s opera ''[[Le Grand Macabre]]'' (1974\u201377.

Osbourne later refuted Stern's allegations and stated that her comments were only made in jest and were not to be taken literally, but that they were misappropriated by other people including ''The X Factor''\u2019s production company due to Stern wanting to give Cowell a bad reputation by using his radio show. She added that although the company wanted to fire her, Cowell was not upset with the comments and wanted her to remain on the show, but that it was ultimately her decision to step down out of fear of awkwardness between her and fellow judges Williams and Field, with whom she is close friends, though she did not rule out a return to the show in the future.\n\n===Sound problems===\nDuring the third week of live shows, sound issues caused the judges, O'Leary and contestants to sound distorted. As the show was not live, O'Leary did not address the sound problems until the following night's live results show, but at the end of the programme, another message said: \"Due to a technical issue, tonight's vote has been cancelled. It will open in tomorrow night's show.\" During the results show all the performances of the night were replayed before the lines opened to make the vote as fair possible for the contestants.<ref name=\"Week 3 Vote Cancel\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{itv.com|id=xfactor|title=The X Factor}}\n*{{stv.tv|id=xfactor|title=The X Factor}}\n\n{{The X Factor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:X Factor (British series 15), The}}\n[[Category:2018 British television seasons]]\n[[Category:2018 in British music]]\n[[Category:The X Factor (British TV series)|15]]\n[[Category:The X Factor seasons|United Kingdom 15]]\n", "text_old": "{{EngvarB|date=December 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2019}}\n{{Infobox reality talent competition\n| name          = The X Factor (British TV series){{!}}The X Factor\n| season        = 15\n| british       = no\n| first_aired   = {{Start date|df=y|2018|09|01}}\n| last_aired    = {{End date|df=y|2018|12|02}}\n| judges        = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Simon Cowell]]\n* [[Louis Tomlinson]]\n* [[Ayda Field]]\n* [[Robbie Williams]]\n* [[Nile Rodgers]] (guest)\n}}\n| presenter     = [[Dermot O'Leary]] (ITV)\n| broadcaster   = {{Plainlist|\n* [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]\n* [[ITV Hub]] (''Xtra Bites'')\n}}\n| last          = The X Factor (British series 14)\n| next          = The X Factor: Celebrity\n| year          = 2018\n| cohost        = {{Plainlist|\n* Becca Dudley (ITV Hub)\n* Tinea Taylor (ITV Hub)\n* [[Stacey Solomon]] (Live final)\n}}\n| finalsvenue   = [[Wembley Arena|The SSE Arena, Wembley]]\n| winner-name   = [[Dalton Harris]]\n| winner-origin = [[Clarendon Parish, Jamaica|Clarendon]], Jamaica\n| winner-genre  = \n| winner-song   = [[The Power of Love (Frankie Goes to Hollywood song)#Dalton Harris version|The Power of Love]]\n| winner-mentor = [[Louis Tomlinson]]\n| runner-name   = [[Scarlett Lee]]\n}}\n\n'''''[[The X Factor (British TV series)|The X Factor]]''''' is a British television music competition to find new singing talent.

Osbourne later refuted Stern's allegations and stated that her comments were only made in jest and were not to be taken literally, but that they were misappropriated by other people including ''The X Factor''\u2019s production company due to Stern wanting to give Cowell a bad reputation by using his radio show. She added that although the company wanted to fire her, Cowell was not upset with the comments and wanted her to remain on the show, but that it was ultimately her decision to step down out of fear of awkwardness between her and fellow judges Williams and Field, with whom she is close friends, though she did not rule out a return to the show in the future.\n\n===Sound problems===\nDuring the third week of live shows, sound issues caused the judges, O'Leary and contestants to sound distorted. As the show was not live, O'Leary did not address the sound problems until the following night's live results show, but at the end of the programme, another message said: \"Due to a technical issue, tonight's vote has been cancelled. It will open in tomorrow night's show.\" During the results show all the performances of the night were replayed before the lines opened to make the vote as fair possible for the contestants.<ref name=\"Week 3 Vote Cancel\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{itv.com|id=xfactor|title=The X Factor}}\n*{{stv.tv|id=xfactor|title=The X Factor}}\n\n{{The X Factor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:X Factor (British series 15), The}}\n[[Category:2018 British television seasons]]\n[[Category:2018 in British music]]\n[[Category:The X Factor (British TV series)|15]]\n[[Category:The X Factor seasons|United Kingdom 15]]\n", "name_user": "2a00:23c8:4300:0:e95b:c280:360e:3644", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eJudges' Houses)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X_Factor_(British_series_15)"}
