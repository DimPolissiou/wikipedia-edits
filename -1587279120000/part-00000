Additionally, it was also the second-costliest season recorded in the North Indian Ocean, only behind the [[2008 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2008]] season. The season has featured eight cyclonic storms, with a record-breaking six of them intensifying to very severe cyclonic storms and one to super cyclonic storm, [[Cyclone Kyarr|Kyarr]]. It is an ongoing event in the annual cycle of [[tropical cyclone]] formation. The North Indian Ocean cyclone season has no official bounds, but cyclones tend to form between April and December, with two peaks in activity in May and November. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern [[Indian Ocean]].\n\nThe season's first named storm, [[Tropical Storm Pabuk (2019)|Pabuk]], entered the basin on January 4, becoming the earliest-forming cyclonic storm of the North Indian Ocean on record. The second cyclone of the season, [[Cyclone Fani]], was the strongest tropical cyclone in the [[Bay of Bengal]] by 3-minute maximum sustained wind speed and minimum barometric pressure since the [[1999 Odisha cyclone]], while being equal in terms of maximum 3-minute sustained wind speed to [[2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2007]]'s [[Cyclone Sidr|Sidr]] and [[2013 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2013]]'s [[Cyclone Phailin|Phailin]]. Further activity occurred in October, and in the latter part of that month, the first Super Cyclonic Storm of the 2010s, [[Cyclone Kyarr|Kyarr]], formed.\n\nThe scope of this article is limited to the Indian Ocean in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], east of the [[Horn of Africa]] and west of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. There are two main [[sea]]s in the North Indian Ocean&nbsp;\u2014 the [[Arabian Sea]] to the west of the [[Indian subcontinent]], abbreviated ''ARB'' by the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD); and the Bay of Bengal to the east, abbreviated ''BOB'' by the IMD.\n\nThe official [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre]] in this basin is the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD), while the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) and the [[National Meteorological Center of CMA]] (NMC) unofficially release full advisories. On average, three to four cyclonic storms form in this basin every season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Annual Frequency of Cyclonic Disturbances (Maximum Wind Speed of 17 Knots or More), Cyclones (34 Knots or More) and Severe Cyclones (48 Knots or More) Over the Bay of Bengal (BOB), Arabian Sea (AS) and Land Surface of India|url=http://www.rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/images/pdf/climatalogy/frequency-cyclone/ANNUALCD.pdf|publisher=India Meteorological Department|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"IMD 2009\">{{cite report|publisher=India Meteorological Department|pages=2\u20133|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/RSMC-2009.pdf|title=Report on Cyclonic Disturbances over North Indian Ocean during 2009|year=2010|accessdate=May 24, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204195912/http://imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/rsmc.pdf|archivedate=2010-12-04|author=RSMC&nbsp;\u2014 Tropical Cyclones New Delhi|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Season summary==\n<center><timeline>\nImageSize = width:850 height:205\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:50 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/01/2019 till:31/12/2019\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/01/2019\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.5,0.8,1)      legend:Depression_(31\u201350_km/h)\n  id:DD     value:rgb(0.37,0.73,1)    legend:Deep_Depression_(51\u201362_km/h)\n  id:TS     value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)    legend:Cyclonic_Storm_(63\u201388_km/h)\n  id:ST     value:rgb(0.8,1,1)        legend:Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_(89\u2013117_km/h)\n  id:VS     value:rgb(1,1,0.8)        legend:Very_Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_(118\u2013165_km/h)\n  id:ES     value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)    legend:Extremely_Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_(166\u2013220_km/h)\n  id:SU     value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)    legend:Super_Cyclonic_Storm_(\u2265221_km/h)\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\nBarData = \n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\nPlotData=\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:04/01/2019 till:07/01/2019 color:TS text:\"[[Tropical Storm Pabuk (2019)|Pabuk (CS)]]\"\n  from:26/04/2019 till:04/05/2019 color:ES text:\"[[Cyclone Fani|Fani (ES)]]\"\n  from:10/06/2019 till:17/06/2019 color:VS text:\"[[Cyclone Vayu|Vayu (VS)]]\"\n  from:06/08/2019 till:11/08/2019 color:DD text:\"BOB 03 (DD)\"\n  from:22/09/2019 till:25/09/2019 color:VS text:\"[[Cyclone Hikaa|Hikaa (VS)]]\"\n  from:30/09/2019 till:01/10/2019 color:TD text:\"LAND 01 (D)\"\n  barset:break\n  from:24/10/2019 till:01/11/2019 color:SU text:\"[[Cyclone Kyarr|Kyarr (SU)]]\"\n  from:30/10/2019 till:07/11/2019 color:ES text:\"[[Cyclone Maha|Maha (ES)]]\"\n  from:05/11/2019 till:11/11/2019 color:VS text:\"[[Cyclone Bulbul|Bulbul (VS)]]\"\n  from:02/12/2019 till:07/12/2019 color:TS text:\"Pawan (CS)\"\n  from:03/12/2019 till:05/12/2019 color:DD text:\"ARB 06 (DD)\"\n  from:08/12/2019 till:10/12/2019 color:DD text:\"ARB 08 (DD)\"\n  \n bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/01/2019 till:31/01/2019 text:January\n  from:01/02/2019 till:28/02/2019 text:February\n  from:01/03/2019 till:31/03/2019 text:March\n  from:01/04/2019 till:30/04/2019 text:April\n  from:01/05/2019 till:31/05/2019 text:May\n  from:01/06/2019 till:30/06/2019 text:June\n  from:01/07/2019 till:31/07/2019 text:July\n  from:01/08/2019 till:31/08/2019 text:August\n  from:01/09/2019 till:30/09/2019 text:September\n  from:01/10/2019 till:31/10/2019 text:October\n  from:01/11/2019 till:30/11/2019 text:November\n  from:01/12/2019 till:31/12/2019 text:December\n\n</timeline></center>\n\nThe season had eight cyclonic storms, six very severe cyclonic storms and one super cyclonic storm, becoming exceptionally active. Amid a weak [[El Ni\u00f1o]] event, the season's first named storm, [[Tropical Storm Pabuk (2019)|Pabuk]], entered the basin on January 4, becoming the earliest-forming cyclonic storm of the North Indian Ocean on record, tying with the [[2014 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2014 season]]. The second cyclonic storm of the season, [[Cyclone Fani|Fani]], formed on April 26. Fani became an extremely severe cyclonic storm on April 30, reaching the equivalent of Category 4 status on the [[Saffir-Simpson scale]], then made landfall in [[India]] killing 89 people between [[Odisha]] and [[Bangladesh]]; Fani caused $8.1 billion in damage.\n\nIn early June, a strong pulse of the [[Madden-Julian Oscillation]] (MJO) led to the development of the third cyclonic storm, [[Cyclone Vayu|Vayu]], which formed June 10 in the [[Arabian Sea]] near the [[Maldives]]. The storm subsequently intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm on June 12, after moving northwestward towards northwestern [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. No tropical cyclones formed in the month of July. Deep Depression BOB 03 formed on August 7 before impacting [[East India]] and [[Bangladesh]]. In late September, Deep Depression ARB 02 formed near [[Gujarat]] and intensified into the fourth cyclonic storm of the season, Hikaa. Cyclonic Storm Kyarr formed on October 24 and three days later became the first super cyclonic storm since [[Cyclone Gonu]] in [[2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2007]]. The sixth cyclonic storm and a record-breaking fifth very severe cyclonic storm,[[Cyclone Maha]], formed on October 30 after Kyarr dissipated on November 1. Soon after, on 6th November the remnants of [[2019 Pacific typhoon season#Severe Tropical Storm Matmo|Severe Tropical Storm Matmo]] crossed the Southeast Asia overland and again consolidated into a depression. It further rapidly intensified to very severe [[Cyclone Bulbul]]. Three more Deep Depressions formed in Arabian Sea in quick succession early in the month of December, out of which, one strengthened into the eighth cyclone of the season, [[Cyclone Pawan]], which made landfall in [[Somalia]] on December 6.\n\nTropical cyclones have been recorded in the North Indian Ocean since 1891. The 2019 season was the first since 1902 that experienced the development of six severe cyclonic storms out of eight cyclonic storms; in 1902, five cyclonic storms formed and four of them became severe cyclonic storms.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191104061401/http://www.imd.gov.in/pages/press_release_view.php?ff=20191103_pr_655 |title = IMD \u2013 Press Release}}</ref> The season has also produced the most [[accumulated cyclone energy]] in this basin on record.\n\n==Systems==\n===Cyclonic Storm Pabuk===\n{{Infobox hurricane small\n|Basin=NIO\n|Image=Pabuk 2019-01-05 0410Z.jpg\n|Track=Pabuk 2019 track.png\n|Formed=January 4 ([[2019 Pacific typhoon season#Tropical Storm Pabuk|Entered basin]])\n|Dissipated=January 7\n|3-min winds=45\n|1-min winds=50\n|Pressure=994\n}}\n{{Main|Tropical Storm Pabuk (2019)}}\nOriginally a tropical storm that formed over the [[South China Sea]] on January 1, Pabuk entered the [[Gulf of Thailand]].

Ocean cyclone season''' was a hyperactive North Indian Ocean cyclone season, featuring 12 depressions, 11 deep depressions, 8 cyclonic storms, a record 6 severe cyclonic storms, a record 6 very severe cyclonic storms, a record 3 extremely severe cyclonic storms, and 1 to Super Cyclonic Storm, Kyarr. Additionally, it was also the second-costliest season recorded in the North Indian Ocean, only behind the [[2008 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2008]] season. The season has featured eight cyclonic storms, with a record-breaking six of them intensifying to very severe cyclonic storms and one to super cyclonic storm, [[Cyclone Kyarr|Kyarr]]. It is an ongoing event in the annual cycle of [[tropical cyclone]] formation. The North Indian Ocean cyclone season has no official bounds, but cyclones tend to form between April and December, with two peaks in activity in May and November. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern [[Indian Ocean]].\n\nThe season's first named storm, [[Tropical Storm Pabuk (2019)|Pabuk]], entered the basin on January 4, becoming the earliest-forming cyclonic storm of the North Indian Ocean on record. The second cyclone of the season, [[Cyclone Fani]], was the strongest tropical cyclone in the [[Bay of Bengal]] by 3-minute maximum sustained wind speed and minimum barometric pressure since the [[1999 Odisha cyclone]], while being equal in terms of maximum 3-minute sustained wind speed to [[2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2007]]'s [[Cyclone Sidr|Sidr]] and [[2013 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2013]]'s [[Cyclone Phailin|Phailin]]. Further activity occurred in October, and in the latter part of that month, the first Super Cyclonic Storm of the 2010s, [[Cyclone Kyarr|Kyarr]], formed.\n\nThe scope of this article is limited to the Indian Ocean in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], east of the [[Horn of Africa]] and west of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. There are two main [[sea]]s in the North Indian Ocean&nbsp;\u2014 the [[Arabian Sea]] to the west of the [[Indian subcontinent]], abbreviated ''ARB'' by the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD); and the Bay of Bengal to the east, abbreviated ''BOB'' by the IMD.\n\nThe official [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre]] in this basin is the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD), while the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) and the [[National Meteorological Center of CMA]] (NMC) unofficially release full advisories. On average, three to four cyclonic storms form in this basin every season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Annual Frequency of Cyclonic Disturbances (Maximum Wind Speed of 17 Knots or More), Cyclones (34 Knots or More) and Severe Cyclones (48 Knots or More) Over the Bay of Bengal (BOB), Arabian Sea (AS) and Land Surface of India|url=http://www.rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/images/pdf/climatalogy/frequency-cyclone/ANNUALCD.pdf|publisher=India Meteorological Department|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"IMD 2009\">{{cite report|publisher=India Meteorological Department|pages=2\u20133|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/RSMC-2009.pdf|title=Report on Cyclonic Disturbances over North Indian Ocean during 2009|year=2010|accessdate=May 24, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204195912/http://imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/rsmc.pdf|archivedate=2010-12-04|author=RSMC&nbsp;\u2014 Tropical Cyclones New Delhi|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Season summary==\n<center><timeline>\nImageSize = width:850 height:205\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:50 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/01/2019 till:31/12/2019\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/01/2019\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.5,0.8,1)      legend:Depression_(31\u201350_km/h)\n  id:DD     value:rgb(0.37,0.73,1)    legend:Deep_Depression_(51\u201362_km/h)\n  id:TS     value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)    legend:Cyclonic_Storm_(63\u201388_km/h)\n  id:ST     value:rgb(0.8,1,1)        legend:Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_(89\u2013117_km/h)\n  id:VS     value:rgb(1,1,0.8)        legend:Very_Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_(118\u2013165_km/h)\n  id:ES     value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)    legend:Extremely_Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_(166\u2013220_km/h)\n  id:SU     value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)    legend:Super_Cyclonic_Storm_(\u2265221_km/h)\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\nBarData = \n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\nPlotData=\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:04/01/2019 till:07/01/2019 color:TS text:\"[[Tropical Storm Pabuk (2019)|Pabuk (CS)]]\"\n  from:26/04/2019 till:04/05/2019 color:ES text:\"[[Cyclone Fani|Fani (ES)]]\"\n  from:10/06/2019 till:17/06/2019 color:VS text:\"[[Cyclone Vayu|Vayu (VS)]]\"\n  from:06/08/2019 till:11/08/2019 color:DD text:\"BOB 03 (DD)\"\n  from:22/09/2019 till:25/09/2019 color:VS text:\"[[Cyclone Hikaa|Hikaa (VS)]]\"\n  from:30/09/2019 till:01/10/2019 color:TD text:\"LAND 01 (D)\"\n  barset:break\n  from:24/10/2019 till:01/11/2019 color:SU text:\"[[Cyclone Kyarr|Kyarr (SU)]]\"\n  from:30/10/2019 till:07/11/2019 color:ES text:\"[[Cyclone Maha|Maha (ES)]]\"\n  from:05/11/2019 till:11/11/2019 color:VS text:\"[[Cyclone Bulbul|Bulbul (VS)]]\"\n  from:02/12/2019 till:07/12/2019 color:TS text:\"Pawan (CS)\"\n  from:03/12/2019 till:05/12/2019 color:DD text:\"ARB 06 (DD)\"\n  from:08/12/2019 till:10/12/2019 color:DD text:\"ARB 08 (DD)\"\n  \n bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/01/2019 till:31/01/2019 text:January\n  from:01/02/2019 till:28/02/2019 text:February\n  from:01/03/2019 till:31/03/2019 text:March\n  from:01/04/2019 till:30/04/2019 text:April\n  from:01/05/2019 till:31/05/2019 text:May\n  from:01/06/2019 till:30/06/2019 text:June\n  from:01/07/2019 till:31/07/2019 text:July\n  from:01/08/2019 till:31/08/2019 text:August\n  from:01/09/2019 till:30/09/2019 text:September\n  from:01/10/2019 till:31/10/2019 text:October\n  from:01/11/2019 till:30/11/2019 text:November\n  from:01/12/2019 till:31/12/2019 text:December\n\n</timeline></center>\n\nThe season had eight cyclonic storms, six very severe cyclonic storms and one super cyclonic storm, becoming exceptionally active. Amid a weak [[El Ni\u00f1o]] event, the season's first named storm, [[Tropical Storm Pabuk (2019)|Pabuk]], entered the basin on January 4, becoming the earliest-forming cyclonic storm of the North Indian Ocean on record, tying with the [[2014 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2014 season]]. The second cyclonic storm of the season, [[Cyclone Fani|Fani]], formed on April 26. Fani became an extremely severe cyclonic storm on April 30, reaching the equivalent of Category 4 status on the [[Saffir-Simpson scale]], then made landfall in [[India]] killing 89 people between [[Odisha]] and [[Bangladesh]]; Fani caused $8.1 billion in damage.\n\nIn early June, a strong pulse of the [[Madden-Julian Oscillation]] (MJO) led to the development of the third cyclonic storm, [[Cyclone Vayu|Vayu]], which formed June 10 in the [[Arabian Sea]] near the [[Maldives]]. The storm subsequently intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm on June 12, after moving northwestward towards northwestern [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. No tropical cyclones formed in the month of July. Deep Depression BOB 03 formed on August 7 before impacting [[East India]] and [[Bangladesh]]. In late September, Deep Depression ARB 02 formed near [[Gujarat]] and intensified into the fourth cyclonic storm of the season, Hikaa. Cyclonic Storm Kyarr formed on October 24 and three days later became the first super cyclonic storm since [[Cyclone Gonu]] in [[2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2007]]. The sixth cyclonic storm and a record-breaking fifth very severe cyclonic storm,[[Cyclone Maha]], formed on October 30 after Kyarr dissipated on November 1. Soon after, on 6th November the remnants of [[2019 Pacific typhoon season#Severe Tropical Storm Matmo|Severe Tropical Storm Matmo]] crossed the Southeast Asia overland and again consolidated into a depression. It further rapidly intensified to very severe [[Cyclone Bulbul]]. Three more Deep Depressions formed in Arabian Sea in quick succession early in the month of December, out of which, one strengthened into the eighth cyclone of the season, [[Cyclone Pawan]], which made landfall in [[Somalia]] on December 6.\n\nTropical cyclones have been recorded in the North Indian Ocean since 1891.

He launched a plant-based nutrition page on his website with links to nutrition and plant-based/vegan blogs, plant-based/vegan diet recipes and natural grocery stores, as well as vegan meetup groups and events. He has also replaced all vending machines in Brooklyn Borough Hall with protein bars, sparkling water and nut snacks instead of sugary, unhealthy snacks. Additionally, Adams has also prompted the City Council to pass a resolution called \"Ban the Baloney,\" which aims for schools across the city to stop serving processed meats.

middle-class households.\n\nIn February 2018, Adams called on NYCHA to take action to address challenges associated with the citywide heating crisis by committing to spending its recent and future fuel cost savings on emergency boiler repairs and conversions.\n\nIn June 2018, Adams suggested lowering the height of the Alloy Development's Downtown Brooklyn project, 80 Flatbush, from 986 to 600 feet in order to not disrupt or overwhelm the existing community surrounding the building.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://therealdeal.com/2018/06/18/brooklyn-boro-prez-wants-to-shrink-80-flatbush/

The diversity within these 950,000 foreign-born immigrants rivals that of neighboring Queens, which has the highest population of immigrants in New York City. In light of that, Adams has made Brooklyn Borough Hall serve as processing center for New York City's Municipal ID program (idNYC), and secured a municipal ID within a few days of the program's launch. Adams also showed strong support for President Obama's landmark executive order on immigration that helped millions of people including many Brooklyn residents.\n\nIn June 2018, Adams led a stroller march against the Trump Administration's family separation at the US-Mexico border.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/ny-immigration-stroller-protest-brooklyn-20180624-story.html |title=Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams leads stroller protest against family separation at U.S. border \u2013 NY Daily News |last=Reyna |first=Brian Niemietz, Rikki |work=Daily News |location=New York |access-date=August 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180809215504/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/ny-immigration-stroller-protest-brooklyn-20180624-story.html |archive-date=August 9, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n'''Parks and Recreational Spaces'''\n\nAdams has been outspoken about the need for a comprehensive urban agriculture plan for New York City.

fuel cost savings on emergency boiler repairs and conversions.\n\nIn June 2018, Adams suggested lowering the height of the Alloy Development's Downtown Brooklyn project, 80 Flatbush, from 986 to 600 feet in order to not disrupt or overwhelm the existing community surrounding the building.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://therealdeal.com/2018/06/18/brooklyn-boro-prez-wants-to-shrink-80-flatbush/

The diversity within these 950,000 foreign-born immigrants rivals that of neighboring Queens, which has the highest population of immigrants in New York City. In light of that, Adams has made Brooklyn Borough Hall serve as processing center for New York City's Municipal ID program (idNYC), and secured a municipal ID within a few days of the program's launch. Adams also showed strong support for President Obama's landmark executive order on immigration that helped millions of people including many Brooklyn residents.\n\nIn June 2018, Adams led a stroller march against the Trump Administration's family separation at the US-Mexico border.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/ny-immigration-stroller-protest-brooklyn-20180624-story.html |title=Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams leads stroller protest against family separation at U.S. border \u2013 NY Daily News |last=Reyna |first=Brian Niemietz, Rikki |work=Daily News |location=New York |access-date=August 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180809215504/http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/ny-immigration-stroller-protest-brooklyn-20180624-story.html |archive-date=August 9, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n'''Parks and Recreational Spaces'''\n\nAdams has been outspoken about the need for a comprehensive urban agriculture plan for New York City.

It is a relatively strong base. \n\nCalcium hypochlorite solution is [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] as the hypochlorite [[anion]] can accept a [[Hydron (chemistry)|proton]] from a water molecule leaving a [[hydroxyl]] [[anion]] in solution. This basicity is due to the propensity for the [[hypochlorite]] anion to accept a proton to become [[hypochlorous acid]], a [[Acid strength|weak]] acid:\n\n:{{chem|ClO|-}} + H<sub>2</sub>O \u2194 HClO + {{chem|OH|-}}\n\nThe hypochlorite anion is also a strong [[oxidizing agent]] containing a [[chlorine]] atom at the valence I (redox state: Cl+1) which reacts under acidic conditions with the [[Reducing agent|reduced]] [[chloride]] species (Cl<sup>\u2013</sup>, here the [[reducing agent]]) present in [[hydrochloric acid]] to form [[calcium chloride]], [[water]] and gaseous [[chlorine]]. The overall reaction is:\n\n:Ca(ClO)<sub>2</sub> + 4 HCl \u2192 CaCl<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + 2 Cl<sub>2</sub>\n\n==Safety==\nCalcium hypochlorite is stored dry and cold, away from any acid, organic materials, and metals. The hydrated form is safer to handle. \n\nIf mixed with an acid it releases highly toxic chlorine gas.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://chemicalland21.com/industrialchem/inorganic/CALCIUM%20HYPOCHLORITE.htm Chemical Land]\n\n{{Calcium compounds}}\n\n[[Category:Antiseptics]]\n[[Category:Bleaches]]\n[[Category:Hypochlorites]]\n[[Category:Calcium compounds]]\n[[Category:Oxidizing agents]]\n", "text_old": "{{chembox\n| Watchedfields = changed\n| verifiedrevid = 450959568\n| Name = Calcium hypochlorite\n| ImageFile = Calcium hypochlorite.png\n| ImageSize = \n| ImageName = Calcium hypochlorite\n| OtherNames = Hypochlorous acid calcium salt<br />Bleaching powder, Calcium oxychloride or chloride of lime\n| IUPACName = \n| SystematicName = \n| Section1 = {{Chembox Identifiers\n| ChemSpiderID_Ref = {{chemspidercite|correct|chemspider}}\n| ChemSpiderID = 22912\n| InChI = 1S/Cacl.ClO/c;1-2/q+2;2*-1\n| SMILES = Cl[O-].[Ca+2].Cl[O-]\n| InChIKey = ZKQDCIXGCQPQNV-UHFFFAOYAV\n| StdInChI_Ref = {{stdinchicite|correct|chemspider}}\n| StdInChI = 1S/Ca.2ClO/c;2*1-2/q+2;2*-1\n| StdInChIKey_Ref = {{stdinchicite|correct|chemspider}}\n| StdInChIKey = ZKQDCIXGCQPQNV-UHFFFAOYSA-N\n| CASNo = 7778-54-3\n| CASNo_Ref = {{cascite|correct|CAS}}\n| EINECS = 231-908-7\n| PubChem = 24504\n| RTECS = NH3485000\n| UNNumber = 1748 2208\n| ChEBI = 31342\n| ChEMBL = 2251447\n| KEGG = D01727\n| UNII = 11DXB629VZ\n  }}\n| Section2 = {{Chembox Properties\n| Formula = Ca(ClO)<sub>2</sub>\n| MolarMass = 142.98 g/mol\n| Appearance = white/gray powder\n| Density = 2.35 g/cm<sup>3</sup> (20 \u00b0C)\n| Solubility = 21 g/100 mL at 25 \u00b0C\n| SolubleOther = reacts in [[alcohol]]\n| MeltingPtC = 100\n| MeltingPt_notes = \n| BoilingPtC = 175\n| BoilingPt_notes = decomposes\n  }}\n| Section3 = {{Chembox Hazards\n| ExternalSDS = [http://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics0638.htm ICSC 0638]\n| GHSPictograms = {{GHS03}}{{GHS05}}{{GHS07}}{{GHS09}}\n| GHSSignalWord = Danger\n| HPhrases = {{H-phrases|272|302|314|400}}\n| PPhrases = {{P-phrases|210|220|221|260|264|270|273|280|301+312|301+330+331|303+361+353|304+340|305+351+338|310|321|330|363|370+378|391|405|501}}\n| NFPA-H = 3\n| NFPA-F = 0\n| NFPA-R = 1\n| NFPA-S = OX\n| FlashPt = Non-flammable\n| LD50 = 850 mg/kg (oral, rat)\n  }}\n| Section4 = \n| Section5 = \n| Section6 = \n| Section8 = {{Chembox Related\n| OtherAnions = [[Calcium chloride]]\n| OtherCations = [[Sodium hypochlorite]]\n  }}\n}}\n\n'''Calcium hypochlorite''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with [[chemical formula|formula]] {{calcium}}({{hypochlorite}})<sub>2</sub>.

It is a relatively strong base. \n\nCalcium hypochlorite solution is [[Base (chemistry)|basic]] as the hypochlorite [[anion]] can accept a [[Hydron (chemistry)|proton]] from a water molecule leaving a [[hydroxyl]] [[anion]] in solution. This basicity is due to the propensity for the [[hypochlorite]] anion to accept a proton to become [[hypochlorous acid]], a [[Acid strength|weak]] acid:\n\n:{{chem|ClO|-}} + H<sub>2</sub>O \u2194 HClO + {{chem|OH|-}}\n\nThe hypochlorite anion is also a strong [[oxidizing agent]] containing a [[chlorine]] atom at the valence I (redox state: Cl+1) which reacts under acidic conditions with the [[Reducing agent|reduced]] [[chloride]] species (Cl<sup>\u2013</sup>, here the [[reducing agent]]) present in [[hydrochloric acid]] to form [[calcium chloride]], [[water]] and gaseous [[chlorine]]. The overall reaction is:\n\n:Ca(ClO)<sub>2</sub> + 4 HCl \u2192 CaCl<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + 2 Cl<sub>2</sub>\n\n==Safety==\nCalcium hypochlorite is stored dry and cold, away from any acid, organic materials, and metals. The hydrated form is safer to handle. If accidentally mixed with a strong acid as e.g., hydrochloric acid, a sudden outgassing of toxic and corrosive elemental chlorine can occur. Chlorine emanations are harmful and can create severe pulmonary problems.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://chemicalland21.com/industrialchem/inorganic/CALCIUM%20HYPOCHLORITE.htm Chemical Land]\n\n{{Calcium compounds}}\n\n[[Category:Antiseptics]]\n[[Category:Bleaches]]\n[[Category:Hypochlorites]]\n[[Category:Calcium compounds]]\n[[Category:Oxidizing agents]]\n", "name_user": "Kelly2357", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_hypochlorite"}

She spent most of her childhood in France while Scotland was ruled by [[regent]]s. In 1558, she married the [[Dauphin of France]], [[Francis II of France|Francis]]. Mary was [[queen consort of France]] from his accession in 1559 until his death in December 1560. Widowed, Mary returned to Scotland, arriving in [[Leith]] on 19 August 1561. Four years later, she married her [[half-cousin]], [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]]. In June 1566 they had a son, [[James VI and I|James]].\n\nIn February 1567, Darnley's residence was destroyed by an explosion, and he [[Kirk o' Field#Darnley's murder|was found murdered]] in the garden. [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]], was generally believed to have orchestrated Darnley's death, but he was acquitted of the charge in April 1567. The following month he married Mary. Following an uprising against the couple, Mary was imprisoned in [[Loch Leven Castle]]. On 24 July 1567, she was forced to [[abdicate]] in favour of her one-year-old son. After an unsuccessful attempt to regain the throne, she fled southward seeking the protection of her [[first cousin once removed]], Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]]. \n\nMary had once claimed Elizabeth's throne as her own and was considered the legitimate sovereign of England by many [[English Catholics]], including participants in a rebellion known as the [[Rising of the North]]. Perceiving Mary as a threat, Elizabeth had her confined in various castles and manor houses in the interior of England. After eighteen and a half years in custody, Mary was found guilty of [[Babington Plot|plotting to assassinate Elizabeth]] in 1586, and was beheaded the following year at [[Fotheringhay Castle]].\n\n== Childhood and early reign ==\nMary was born on 8 December 1542 at [[Linlithgow Palace]], Scotland, to King [[James V]] and his French second wife, [[Mary of Guise]].

Her paternal grandmother, [[Margaret Tudor]], was Henry VIII's sister. On 14 December, six days after her birth, she became [[Queen of Scotland]] when her father died.

She spent most of her childhood in France while Scotland was ruled by [[regent]]s, and in 1558, she married the [[Dauphin of France]], [[Francis II of France|Francis]]. Mary was [[queen consort of France]] from his accession in 1559 until his death in December 1560. Widowed, Mary returned to Scotland, arriving in [[Leith]] on 19 August 1561. Four years later, she married her [[half-cousin]], [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]], and in June 1566 they had a son, [[James VI and I|James]].\n\nIn February 1567, Darnley's residence was destroyed by an explosion, and he [[Kirk o' Field#Darnley's murder|was found murdered]] in the garden. [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]], was generally believed to have orchestrated Darnley's death, but he was acquitted of the charge in April 1567, and the following month he married Mary. Following an uprising against the couple, Mary was imprisoned in [[Loch Leven Castle]]. On 24 July 1567, she was forced to [[abdicate]] in favour of her one-year-old son. After an unsuccessful attempt to regain the throne, she fled southward seeking the protection of her [[first cousin once removed]], Queen [[Elizabeth I of England]]. \n\nMary had once claimed Elizabeth's throne as her own and was considered the legitimate sovereign of England by many [[English Catholics]], including participants in a rebellion known as the [[Rising of the North]]. Perceiving Mary as a threat, Elizabeth had her confined in various castles and manor houses in the interior of England. After eighteen and a half years in custody, Mary was found guilty of [[Babington Plot|plotting to assassinate Elizabeth]] in 1586, and was beheaded the following year at [[Fotheringhay Castle]].\n\n== Childhood and early reign ==\nMary was born on 8 December 1542 at [[Linlithgow Palace]], Scotland, to King [[James V]] and his French second wife, [[Mary of Guise]]. She was said to have been born prematurely and was the only legitimate child of James to survive him.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fraser|1994|p=13}}</ref> She was the great-niece of King [[Henry VIII of England]], as her paternal grandmother, [[Margaret Tudor]], was Henry VIII's sister.

Clark was highly regarded and renowned as a guitarist, [[banjo]] player, and [[fiddle]]r.  He was skilled in the traditions of many genres, including [[classical guitar]], [[country music]], [[Latin music]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and pop.  He had hit songs as a pop vocalist (e.g., \"[[Hier encore|Yesterday, When I Was Young]]\" and \"Thank God and Greyhound\"), and his instrumental skill had an enormous effect on generations of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and country musicians.

He is best known for having hosted ''[[Hee Haw]]'', a nationally televised country variety show, from 1969 to 1997. Clark was an important and influential figure in [[country music]], both as a performer and in helping to popularize the genre.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Clark frequently guest-hosted for [[Johnny Carson]] on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and enjoyed a 30-million viewership for ''Hee Haw''. Clark was highly regarded and renowned as a guitarist, [[banjo]] player, and [[fiddle]]r.  He was skilled in the traditions of many genres, including [[classical guitar]], [[country music]], [[Latin music]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and pop.  He had hit songs as a pop vocalist (e.g., \"[[Hier encore|Yesterday, When I Was Young]]\" and \"Thank God and Greyhound\"), and his instrumental skill had an enormous effect on generations of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and country musicians. He became a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 1987, and, in 2009, was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]].

[[Country-western]] music was widely derided by Clark's schoolmates, leaving him socially isolated. Clowning around, he felt, helped him to fit in again. Clark used humor as a musician as well, and it was not until the mid 1960s that he felt confident enough to perform in public without using humor in his act.<ref name=rcinterview />\n\nThe D.C. area had a number of country-western music venues at the time.
