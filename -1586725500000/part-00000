In 1994, the City of Lamia regional campus of the TEI of Larissa became the independent university of the TEI of Lamia awarding its own name degrees. \nIn 2015, TEI of Lamia and the TEI of Chalkida agreed to a merger, Presidential Decree 100, Government Gazette 135 \u0391'/05.06.2013. The founded institution was named TEI of Central Greece with the City of Lamia Campus becoming the university main campus. As the European Union determined, in October 2017 the Ministry of Education specified all TEIs will be merged with the corresponding universities and each TEI department will be absorbed by a corresponding department. On January 17, 2019 the Hellenic Parliamentary Committee Session has voted the submitting draft law on December 28, 2018, and corresponding law 4589 has been published on the Government Gazette No 13 \u0391'/29.01.2019.<ref name=\"Law 4589, 2019, Government Gazette 13 \u0391'/29.01.2019\"/> \n\nThe TEI of Central Greece abolished and admitted its last students in the 2018-2019 [[academic year]]. Subsequently, the [[University of Thessaly]] absorbing the Departments of Computer Science, Electronic Engineering, Nursing, Physiotherapy, and the TEI of Central Greece Main Campus in the City of Lamia was transferred and joined to University of Thessaly at the City of Lamia Campus{{efn-ua|name=fn2}} (that was formerly the main campus of the [[University of Central Greece|University of Central Greece (UTH)]] existed from 2003 to 2013) and became its campus part.

In 1994, the City of Lamia regional campus of the TEI of Larissa became the independent university of the TEI of Lamia awarding its own name degrees. \nIn 2015, TEI of Lamia and the TEI of Chalkida agreed to a merger, Presidential Decree 100, Government Gazette 135 \u0391'/05.06.2013. The founded institution was named TEI of Central Greece with the City of Lamia Campus becoming the university main campus. As the European Union determined, in October 2017 the Ministry of Education specified all TEIs will be merged with the corresponding universities and each TEI department will be absorbed by a corresponding department. On January 17, 2019 the Hellenic Parliamentary Committee Session has voted the submitting draft law on December 28, 2018, and corresponding law 4589 has been published on the Government Gazette No 13 \u0391'/29.01.2019.<ref name=\"Law 4589, 2019, Government Gazette 13 \u0391'/29.01.2019\"/> \n\nThe TEI of Central Greece abolished and admitted its last students in the 2018-2019 [[academic year]].
