{"title_page": "Running out the clock", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=April 2014}}\nIn [[sports]], '''running out the clock''' (also known as '''running down the clock''', '''stonewalling''', '''killing the clock''', '''chewing the clock''', '''stalling''', '''timewasting''' (or '''time-wasting''') or '''eating clock'''<ref name=\"terrelldavis20140202\">{{cite news | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH8O9k9vln0 | title=Seattle Seahawks need to eat clock | work=Channel 4 | date=2014-02-03 | accessdate=February 2, 2014 | author=Davis, Terrell}}</ref>) is the practice of a winning team allowing the clock to expire through a series of pre-selected plays, either to preserve a lead or hasten the end of a one-sided contest. Such measures expend time, but do not otherwise have a tactical purpose. This is usually done by a team that is winning by a slim margin (or, occasionally, [[Tie (draw)|tied]]) near the end of a game, in order to reduce the time available for the opposing team to [[score (game)|score]]. Generally, it is the opposite strategy of [[running up the score]].\n\nMany rulebooks attempt to counteract this, some include a time limit for completing a play, such as a [[play clock]] or [[shot clock]].\n\nApproaches to running out the clock differ, particularly between sports. In some cases it is considered a normal aspect of the game, whereas in others it is considered [[Unsportsmanlike conduct|unsporting]]. The term \"timewasting\" has pejorative implications and is generally reserved for varieties of [[football]].<ref name=\"football time-wasting reference\">{{cite news| url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40993250| title = Premier League: Is time-wasting leaving fans short-changed? |date=2017-08-21 | publisher=[[BBC]] | accessdate = 2017-11-23}}</ref> In other timed sports, including [[basketball]], [[gridiron football]], and [[hockey]]; the more neutral term \"running out the clock\" is more commonly used.\n\n== Gridiron football ==\n{{Main|Clock management}}\n\n===American football===\nIn [[American football]], each quarter of a game is measured with a 15-minute game clock, or 12-minute clock in many [[high school football]] codes and the [[German Football League]]. A team in possession of the lead and the ball will attempt to use up as much of the game clock as possible in order to bring the game to an end more quickly, thus denying the opposition another chance on offense.\n\nTypically, the leading team will execute a series of simple [[Rush (American football)|rushing]] plays (the clock does not stop moving at the conclusion of a rushing play unless the rusher steps out of bounds) or one or more [[quarterback kneel]]s. A team will often accept minimal prospect for a large gain in yardage (or even, particularly with quarterback kneels, a modest loss of yardage) in order to drain more time from the game clock, as time elapsed is considered more valuable than yardage to a team with the lead. Passing plays are not typically used by a team running out the clock, as an incomplete pass will cause the game clock to stop. Passing plays always carry the risk of interception, and spread the offense widely across the field, which makes tackling after an interception much harder compared to a fumble. If the ball passes out of bounds, the clock will also stop. This leads to teams running plays in the middle of the field in order to minimize the chance that the ball will travel out of bounds. Running plays also carry a much lower chance of turning the ball over and of a turnover resulting in a score or significant gain for the defense. Relatively safe, short, [[West Coast offense]]-type passes can be, and sometimes are, included in attempts to run out the clock, especially if more yardage is needed to earn a first down and maintain possession.\n\nIn both professional and college football, the offense has 40 seconds (in the [[Alliance of American Football]], 30) from the end of the previous play to run the next play.  A team running out the clock will allow the [[play clock]] (which records the time remaining until a play must be run) to drain as much as possible before running its next play. In the NFL, this is particularly noteworthy due to the existence of the [[two-minute warning]]. If the trailing team has no [[time-out (sport)|timeout]]s remaining and the leading team is in possession of the ball with a first down at the two-minute warning, they can effectively run out the clock and win the game without running another positive play. With two minutes to go (120 seconds), the offense can take three \"knees\", one each on 1st, 2nd, and 3rd down (using all 40 seconds from the play clock on each), and allow the game clock to expire before having to run a play for fourth down. A similar situation can be had by also achieving a first down inside the two-minute warning. This practice is commonly known as the \"Victory Formation\", as the offense lines up in a tightly-protective \"V\" formation to minimize the chances of a fumble or other turnover. (The AAF lets teams run out the clock on three straight victory formations from 90 seconds left in regulation.)\n\nConversely, a team that faces the risk of the other team running out the clock may attempt to force its opponent to score so it can quickly get the ball back. In [[Super Bowl XLVI]], for example, the [[New England Patriots]] were ahead of the [[New York Giants]] 17\u201315 with 1:04 left in the fourth quarter. The Giants were at the Patriots' six-yard line, however, and the Patriots had only one time-out left. The Giants elected to run out as much time as possible and then kick a relatively short [[field goal (American football)|field goal]] to take a late lead. Had the Giants been successful in this strategy it would have left the Patriots with no timeouts and less than 20 seconds remaining to score. The Patriots thus let [[Ahmad Bradshaw]] score a touchdown in hopes of scoring a touchdown of their own before the game's end. Bradshaw, aware of the Patriots' strategy, attempted to stop himself from crossing the [[goal line (American football)|goal line]] but was unsuccessful as his momentum carried him forward. The Patriots then received the ball with 57 seconds remaining, but failed to score, and the Giants won 21\u201317.<ref name=\"posnanski20120206\">{{cite news | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/joe_posnanski/02/06/super.bowl.xlvi/?xid=cnnbin | title=Bradshaw's Reluctant Touchdown puts to rest an unusual Super Bowl | work=Sports Illustrated | date=2012-02-06 | accessdate=February 6, 2012 | author=Posnanski, Joe}}</ref>\n\n===Canadian football===\nRule differences between the two codes mean than in Canadian football running out the clock is much more limited. The specific differences are:\n* The offensive team is only allowed three downs to advance the ball 10 yards and thereby maintain possession, as opposed to four downs in the American game.\n* The play clock runs for only 20&nbsp;seconds from the time the ball is whistled into play, compared to 40&nbsp;seconds from the end of the last play in U.S. college football and the NFL.\n* Two major changes in game timing occur in the last 3 minutes of each half:\n** The clock stops after each play.\n** The penalty for \"time count\" (equivalent to \"delay of game\" in American football) is loss of down on first or second down, and 10 yards on third down with the down repeated. The referee has the right to penalize repeated third-down time counts during the last 3 minutes with loss of possession.\n* Finally, if the game clock runs out during a play, or while the ball is dead, the quarter is extended by one final untimed play.\n\nA Canadian football side on offense with a full set of downs can run just over 40 seconds off the game clock, a third of what is possible in American football.\n\n== Association football ==\nTimewasting in association football consists of two forms, extending the length of stoppages when the [[Ball in and out of play|ball is out of play]], and, while the ball is in play, playing in a way as to keep possession of the ball as long as possible rather than attempting to score. The former should, in theory, be negated by the addition of an equal amount of [[stoppage time]], but teams nevertheless employ a variety of such methods.\n\n;Extending the length of stoppages\n\nA common timewasting tactic is to make [[substitute (football)|substitututions]] late in the game, lengthening the duration of stoppages while the change is made. Players may also feign injury, kick the ball away, obstruct the taking of a quick [[Direct free kick|free kick]] by an opposing player, or delay the taking of their own free kicks or [[throw in]]s. If the referee considers a delay to be unreasonable, the offending player may be given a yellow card.\n\nTeams have also been accused of timewasting by instructing (or allowing) their [[ball boy]]s to delay returning the ball for the away team to take a throw in or a [[corner kick]].<ref name=\"Balls\">{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6163060.stm| title = Ball boy warning stuns SFA chief| work=www.bbc.co.uk| accessdate = 2006-11-19 | date=2006-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/league-cup/9823144/Swansea-City-ballboy-Charlie-Morgan-boasted-about-time-wasting-before-Capital-One-semi-final-with-Chelsea.html |title=Swansea City ballboy Charlie Morgan boasted about time wasting before Capital One semi-final with Chelsea |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2013-01-24 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Dominic |last=Fifield |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/23/swansea-ballboy-eden-hazard-sent-off |title=Swansea ballboy incident leads to red card for Eden Hazard |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2013-01-23 }}</ref>\n\n;Maintaining possession\n\nA common tactic often involves carrying the ball into the corner of the field and shielding it from the defender. This will commonly lead to a free kick if the frustrated defender budges the player out of the way, or it can also lead to a throw-in by the defender placing a tackle and managing to legally make contact with the ball so close to the line it often rolls out of play. This can be repeated to continue timewasting.\n\n===Laws of the Game===\nBoth types of timewasting are generally viewed negatively, though only the former is contrary to the game's rules. Referees are empowered to book players whom they feel are delaying the restart of play and several amendments to the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] and guidance to [[Referee (association football)|match officials]] have been made to prevent timewasting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mensyoutholympic/news/ifab-clamps-down-time-wasting-reckless-play-and-simulation-103178|title=About FIFA - News - IFAB clamps down on time-wasting, reckless play and simulation - FIFA.com|last=FIFA.com|website=www.fifa.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref>\n\nThe [[back-pass rule]] was introduced in 1992 in order to prevent timewasting by defenders repeatedly passing the ball back to their [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]].\n\nAn amendment to the Laws attempting to mitigate timewasting substitutions was made in 2019 \u2014 players are now required to leave the pitch at the nearest boundary, rather than making an often long and slow walk back to their teams' [[technical area]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11652949/handball-rules-among-those-amended-by-international-fa-board|title=Handball rules among those amended by International FA Board|website=Sky Sports|language=en|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref>\n\n== Australian rules football ==\nIn a close game, [[Australian rules football]] players will run the clock down by kicking the ball between the defenders while having no intention of a forward thrust, or by advancing the ball with short, low-risk kicks. Each time a mark is taken, the player can run approximately eight seconds off the clock before being required to play on \u2013 and may continue to run time off the clock if no opponents pressure them after the call of play on is made. Strategically, running down the clock can be stifled by playing man-on-man defence, in an attempt to force the opposition to kick to a contest, creating the chance for a turnover.\n\nLate in a close game players who have [[Mark (Australian football)|marked]] the ball will often attend to their uniforms such as tucking in jerseys or pulling their socks up along with over zealous stretching in an effort to milk the clock. Players kicking for goal are now given no more than 30 seconds to take their kicks, while in general play they are only given 7 seconds, after which \"play-on\" is called. According to the [[Laws of Australian rules football|laws]], wasting time is either (a) a free kick to the opposing team (15.10.1.a), (b) a 50-metre penalty (18.1.b), or (c) a reportable offence if it is judged to be intentional, reckless or negligent (19.2.2.g.iv).\n\n==Rugby union==\nIn [[rugby union]], it often takes place by one team deliberately collapsing a [[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]].  The penalty is a [[free kick (rugby union)|free kick]], as it is considered a technical offence.\n\n==Rugby league==\nIn the [[National Rugby League]] (rugby league), anti-time wasting measures include countdown clocks to achieve timely formations of the [[scrum (rugby)|scrum]] and execution of [[Glossary of rugby league#Goal line drop out|line drop-outs]],<ref>{{cite web |first=Eden |last=Richards |url=http://www.nrl.com/shot-clock-needs-tweaking-bennett/tabid/10874/newsid/92888/default.aspx |title=Shot clock needs tweaking: Bennett |website=NRL |date=2016-02-14 }}</ref> calling of time-off during the last five minutes of the match when a try has been scored, or when a [[Try (rugby)|conversion]] attempt runs longer than 80 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |first=Tony |last=Webeck |website=NRL |url=http://www.nrl.com/clock-to-stop-under-rule-changes/tabid/10874/newsid/75996/default.aspx |title=Clock to stop under rule changes |date=2014-01-26 }}</ref>\n\n== Basketball ==\n{{Main|Shot clock}}In basketball game clock stops when the ball is dead and runs when it is live.\n\nRunning out the clock was a major problem in the early days of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. Often, once a team grabbed the lead, they would spend the remainder of the game just passing the ball back and forth, in what was called '''stall ball'''. The only hope for the other team was to commit fouls and to score on [[free throw]]s. The worst example was a 1950 game with a final score of 19-18. Another game the same year had six overtime periods with only a single shot attempted.\n\nThe NBA responded to these problems when [[Danny Biasone]] invented the [[shot clock]]. This required a team that gets possession of the ball 24 seconds to make a shot at the basket. This effectively eliminated stall ball and in the NBA's own words, \"Biasone's invention rescue[d] the league.\"<ref name=\"nba19541955\">\"[http://www.nba.com/history/season/19541955.html 1954\u201355 SEASON OVERVIEW]\" NBA.</ref> Today, shot clocks are used in nearly all basketball leagues.\n\nMost clock management in modern basketball centers around both the game clock and the shot clock. An offense nearing the end of a game and holding a slim lead will attempt to use up as much of both clocks as possible before shooting the ball to give the opposing team as little time as possible to respond.\n\nTo combat this, defenses routinely commit intentional [[Personal foul (basketball)|personal fouls]] by making contact with the person in possession of the ball, immediately forcing them to take [[free throw]]s and stopping the game clock (when the player being fouled is a known poor free throw shooter, this strategy is known as [[hack-a-Shaq]]); once the free throws are taken, the fouling team then gets possession of the ball. The defensive team thus gets the ball back sooner by committing the foul than they would by playing clean and allowing the offense to run out the clock.\n\n== Other sports ==\n\n;[[Lacrosse]]\nA team must advance the ball from its defensive square to the midfield line within 20 seconds and then into the offensive square within 10 additional seconds or lose possession; additionally, a team in possession that appears to be Stonewalling by not attacking the goal may be ordered by the referee to stay within the attacking box or lose possession. Additionally, [[Major League Lacrosse]] and most forms of [[indoor lacrosse]] employ a shot clock as with basketball.\n;[[Ice hockey]]\nA team which shoots the [[Puck (sports)|puck]] forward from their half of the ice over the opposing team's goal line in an effort to stonewall is guilty of icing, and the puck is brought to the other end of the ice for a [[face-off]]. The rule is not in effect when a team is playing shorthanded due to a penalty. Additionally, a player (usually a [[goalkeeper]]) may be charged with a minor (two-minute) penalty for [[delay of game]] for shooting the puck over the glass and out of play. A leading team may pass the puck to the defense who will then retreat in his zone. During a [[power play (sport)|power play]], the shorthanded team will try to ice the puck in order to gain time until the penalty time ends.\n\n;[[Water polo]]\nA 30-second shot clock is employed, in much the same manner as college basketball.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Garbage time]]\n* [[Delay of game]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{American football concepts}}\n{{portalbar|Sports}}\n\n[[Category:Terminology used in multiple sports]]\n[[Category:American football terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=April 2014}}\nIn [[sports]], '''running out the clock''' (also known as '''running down the clock''', '''stonewalling''', '''killing the clock''', '''chewing the clock''', '''stalling''', '''timewasting''' (or '''time-wasting''') or '''eating clock'''<ref name=\"terrelldavis20140202\">{{cite news | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH8O9k9vln0 | title=Seattle Seahawks need to eat clock | work=Channel 4 | date=2014-02-03 | accessdate=February 2, 2014 | author=Davis, Terrell}}</ref>) is the practice of a winning team allowing the clock to expire through a series of pre-selected plays, either to preserve a lead or hasten the end of a one-sided contest. Such measures expend time, but do not otherwise have a tactical purpose. This is usually done by a team that is winning by a slim margin (or, occasionally, [[Tie (draw)|tied]]) near the end of a game, in order to reduce the time available for the opposing team to [[score (game)|score]]. Generally, it is the opposite strategy of [[running up the score]]. \n\nMany rulebooks attempt to counteract this, some include a time limit for completing a play, such as a [[play clock]] or [[shot clock]]. \n\nApproaches to running out the clock differ, particularly between sports. In some cases it is considered a normal aspect of the game, whereas in others it is considered [[Unsportsmanlike conduct|unsporting]]. The term \"timewasting\" has perjorative implications and is generally reserved for varieties of [[football]].<ref name=\"football time-wasting reference\">{{cite news| url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/40993250| title = Premier League: Is time-wasting leaving fans short-changed? |date=2017-08-21 | publisher=[[BBC]] | accessdate = 2017-11-23}}</ref> In other timed sports, including [[basketball]], [[gridiron football]], and [[hockey]]; the more neutral term \"running out the clock\" is more commonly used.\n\n== Gridiron football ==\n{{Main|Clock management}}\n===American football===\nIn [[American football]], each quarter of a game is measured with a 15-minute game clock, or 12-minute clock in many [[high school football]] codes and the [[German Football League]]. A team in possession of the lead and the ball will attempt to use up as much of the game clock as possible in order to bring the game to an end more quickly, thus denying the opposition another chance on offense.\n\nTypically, the leading team will execute a series of simple [[Rush (American football)|rushing]] plays (the clock does not stop moving at the conclusion of a rushing play unless the rusher steps out of bounds) or one or more [[quarterback kneel]]s. A team will often accept minimal prospect for a large gain in yardage (or even, particularly with quarterback kneels, a modest loss of yardage) in order to drain more time from the game clock, as time elapsed is considered more valuable than yardage to a team with the lead. Passing plays are not typically used by a team running out the clock, as an incomplete pass will cause the game clock to stop. Passing plays always carry the risk of interception, and spread the offense widely across the field, which makes tackling after an interception much harder compared to a fumble. If the ball passes out of bounds, the clock will also stop. This leads to teams running plays in the middle of the field in order to minimize the chance that the ball will travel out of bounds. Running plays also carry a much lower chance of turning the ball over and of a turnover resulting in a score or significant gain for the defense. Relatively safe, short, [[West Coast offense]]-type passes can be, and sometimes are, included in attempts to run out the clock, especially if more yardage is needed to earn a first down and maintain possession.\n\nIn both professional and college football, the offense has 40 seconds (in the [[Alliance of American Football]], 30) from the end of the previous play to run the next play.  A team running out the clock will allow the [[play clock]] (which records the time remaining until a play must be run) to drain as much as possible before running its next play. In the NFL, this is particularly noteworthy due to the existence of the [[two-minute warning]]. If the trailing team has no [[time-out (sport)|timeout]]s remaining and the leading team is in possession of the ball with a first down at the two-minute warning, they can effectively run out the clock and win the game without running another positive play. With two minutes to go (120 seconds), the offense can take three \"knees\", one each on 1st, 2nd, and 3rd down (using all 40 seconds from the play clock on each), and allow the game clock to expire before having to run a play for fourth down. A similar situation can be had by also achieving a first down inside the two-minute warning. This practice is commonly known as the \"Victory Formation\", as the offense lines up in a tightly-protective \"V\" formation to minimize the chances of a fumble or other turnover. (The AAF lets teams run out the clock on three straight victory formations from 90 seconds left in regulation.)\n\nConversely, a team that faces the risk of the other team running out the clock may attempt to force its opponent to score so it can quickly get the ball back. In [[Super Bowl XLVI]], for example, the [[New England Patriots]] were ahead of the [[New York Giants]] 17\u201315 with 1:04 left in the fourth quarter. The Giants were at the Patriots' six-yard line, however, and the Patriots had only one time-out left. The Giants elected to run out as much time as possible and then kick a relatively short [[field goal (American football)|field goal]] to take a late lead. Had the Giants been successful in this strategy it would have left the Patriots with no timeouts and less than 20 seconds remaining to score. The Patriots thus let [[Ahmad Bradshaw]] score a touchdown in hopes of scoring a touchdown of their own before the game's end. Bradshaw, aware of the Patriots' strategy, attempted to stop himself from crossing the [[goal line (American football)|goal line]] but was unsuccessful as his momentum carried him forward. The Patriots then received the ball with 57 seconds remaining, but failed to score, and the Giants won 21\u201317.<ref name=\"posnanski20120206\">{{cite news | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/joe_posnanski/02/06/super.bowl.xlvi/?xid=cnnbin | title=Bradshaw's Reluctant Touchdown puts to rest an unusual Super Bowl | work=Sports Illustrated | date=2012-02-06 | accessdate=February 6, 2012 | author=Posnanski, Joe}}</ref>\n\n===Canadian football===\nRule differences between the two codes mean than in Canadian football running out the clock is much more limited. The specific differences are:\n* The offensive team is only allowed three downs to advance the ball 10 yards and thereby maintain possession, as opposed to four downs in the American game.\n* The play clock runs for only 20&nbsp;seconds from the time the ball is whistled into play, compared to 40&nbsp;seconds from the end of the last play in U.S. college football and the NFL.\n* Two major changes in game timing occur in the last 3 minutes of each half:\n** The clock stops after each play.\n** The penalty for \"time count\" (equivalent to \"delay of game\" in American football) is loss of down on first or second down, and 10 yards on third down with the down repeated. The referee has the right to penalize repeated third-down time counts during the last 3 minutes with loss of possession.\n* Finally, if the game clock runs out during a play, or while the ball is dead, the quarter is extended by one final untimed play.\n\nA Canadian football side on offense with a full set of downs can run just over 40 seconds off the game clock, a third of what is possible in American football.\n\n== Association football ==\nTimewasting in association football consists of two forms, extending the length of stoppages when the [[Ball in and out of play|ball is out of play]], and, while the ball is in play, playing in a way as to keep possession of the ball as long as possible rather than attempting to score. The former should, in theory, be negated by the addition of an equal amount of [[stoppage time]], but teams nevertheless employ a variety of such methods. \n\n;Extending the length of stoppages\n\nA common timewasting tactic is to make [[substitute (football)|substitututions]] late in the game, lengthening the duration of stoppages while the change is made. Players may also feign injury, kick the ball away, obstruct the taking of a quick [[Direct free kick|free kick]] by an opposing player, or delay the taking of their own free kicks or [[throw in]]s. If the referee considers a delay to be unreasonable, the offending player may be given a yellow card.\n\nTeams have also been accused of timewasting by instructing (or allowing) their [[ball boy]]s to delay returning the ball for the away team to take a throw in or a [[corner kick]].<ref name=\"Balls\">{{cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6163060.stm| title = Ball boy warning stuns SFA chief| work=www.bbc.co.uk| accessdate = 2006-11-19 | date=2006-11-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/league-cup/9823144/Swansea-City-ballboy-Charlie-Morgan-boasted-about-time-wasting-before-Capital-One-semi-final-with-Chelsea.html |title=Swansea City ballboy Charlie Morgan boasted about time wasting before Capital One semi-final with Chelsea |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2013-01-24 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Dominic |last=Fifield |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jan/23/swansea-ballboy-eden-hazard-sent-off |title=Swansea ballboy incident leads to red card for Eden Hazard |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2013-01-23 }}</ref>\n\n;Maintaining possession\n\nA common tactic often involves carrying the ball into the corner of the field and shielding it from the defender. This will commonly lead to a free kick if the frustrated defender budges the player out of the way, or it can also lead to a throw-in by the defender placing a tackle and managing to legally make contact with the ball so close to the line it often rolls out of play. This can be repeated to continue timewasting. \n\n===Laws of the Game===\nBoth types of timewasting are generally viewed negatively, though only the former is contrary to the game's rules. Referees are empowered to book players whom they feel are delaying the restart of play and several amendments to the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] and guidance to [[Referee (association football)|match officials]] have been made to prevent timewasting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mensyoutholympic/news/ifab-clamps-down-time-wasting-reckless-play-and-simulation-103178|title=About FIFA - News - IFAB clamps down on time-wasting, reckless play and simulation - FIFA.com|last=FIFA.com|website=www.fifa.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-10}}</ref> \n\nThe [[back-pass rule]] was introduced in 1992 in order to prevent timewasting by defenders repeatedly passing the ball back to their [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]].\n\nAn amendment to the Laws attempting to mitigate timewasting substitutions was made in 2019 \u2014 players are now required to leave the pitch at the nearest boundary, rather than making an often long and slow walk back to their teams' [[technical area]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11652949/handball-rules-among-those-amended-by-international-fa-board|title=Handball rules among those amended by International FA Board|website=Sky Sports|language=en|access-date=2019-05-14}}</ref>\n\n== Australian rules football ==\nIn a close game, [[Australian rules football]] players will run the clock down by kicking the ball between the defenders while having no intention of a forward thrust, or by advancing the ball with short, low-risk kicks. Each time a mark is taken, the player can run approximately eight seconds off the clock before being required to play on \u2013 and may continue to run time off the clock if no opponents pressure them after the call of play on is made. Strategically, running down the clock can be stifled by playing man-on-man defence, in an attempt to force the opposition to kick to a contest, creating the chance for a turnover.\n\nLate in a close game players who have [[Mark (Australian football)|marked]] the ball will often attend to their uniforms such as tucking in jerseys or pulling their socks up along with over zealous stretching in an effort to milk the clock. Players kicking for goal are now given no more than 30 seconds to take their kicks, while in general play they are only given 7 seconds, after which \"play-on\" is called. According to the [[Laws of Australian rules football|laws]], wasting time is either (a) a free kick to the opposing team (15.10.1.a), (b) a 50-metre penalty (18.1.b), or (c) a reportable offence if it is judged to be intentional, reckless or negligent (19.2.2.g.iv).\n\n==Rugby union==\nIn [[rugby union]], it often takes place by one team deliberately collapsing a [[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]].  The penalty is a [[free kick (rugby union)|free kick]], as it is considered a technical offence.\n\n==Rugby league==\nIn the [[National Rugby League]] (rugby league), anti-time wasting measures include countdown clocks to achieve timely formations of the [[scrum (rugby)|scrum]] and execution of [[Glossary of rugby league#Goal line drop out|line drop-outs]],<ref>{{cite web |first=Eden |last=Richards |url=http://www.nrl.com/shot-clock-needs-tweaking-bennett/tabid/10874/newsid/92888/default.aspx |title=Shot clock needs tweaking: Bennett |website=NRL |date=2016-02-14 }}</ref> calling of time-off during the last five minutes of the match when a try has been scored, or when a [[Try (rugby)|conversion]] attempt runs longer than 80 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |first=Tony |last=Webeck |website=NRL |url=http://www.nrl.com/clock-to-stop-under-rule-changes/tabid/10874/newsid/75996/default.aspx |title=Clock to stop under rule changes |date=2014-01-26 }}</ref>\n\n== Basketball ==\n{{Main|Shot clock}}In basketball game clock stops when the ball is dead and runs when it is live.\n\nRunning out the clock was a major problem in the early days of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. Often, once a team grabbed the lead, they would spend the remainder of the game just passing the ball back and forth, in what was called '''stall ball'''. The only hope for the other team was to commit fouls and to score on [[free throw]]s. The worst example was a 1950 game with a final score of 19-18. Another game the same year had six overtime periods with only a single shot attempted.\n\nThe NBA responded to these problems when [[Danny Biasone]] invented the [[shot clock]]. This required a team that gets possession of the ball 24 seconds to make a shot at the basket. This effectively eliminated stall ball and in the NBA's own words, \"Biasone's invention rescue[d] the league.\"<ref name=\"nba19541955\">\"[http://www.nba.com/history/season/19541955.html 1954\u201355 SEASON OVERVIEW]\" NBA.</ref> Today, shot clocks are used in nearly all basketball leagues.\n\nMost clock management in modern basketball centers around both the game clock and the shot clock.

As time progressed and the number of Buddhist clergy increased, the offices of ''S\u014dj\u014d'' (archbishop) and ''S\u014dzu'' (bishop) were created.

These were not exclusive schools, and temples were apt to have scholars versed in several of the schools. It has been suggested that they can best be thought of as \"study groups\". The Buddhism of these periods, known as the [[Asuka period]] and [[Nara period]] \u2013 was not a practical religion, being more the domain of learned priests whose official function was to pray for the peace and prosperity of the state and imperial house. This kind of Buddhism had little to offer to the illiterate and uneducated masses and led to the growth of \"people\u2019s priests\" who were not ordained and had no formal Buddhist training. Their practice was a combination of Buddhist and [[Taoism|Daoist]] elements and the incorporation of [[shamanism|shamanistic]] features of indigenous practices. Some of these figures became immensely popular and were a source of criticism towards the sophisticated academic and bureaucratic Buddhism of the capital.\n\n====Tangmi====\nThe Late Nara period saw the introduction of [[Tangmi]] ([[Vajrayana|Esoteric Buddhism]], Japanese ''mikky\u014d'') to Japan from China by [[K\u016bkai]] and [[Saich\u014d]], who founded [[Shingon Buddhism]] and the [[Tendai]] school, respectively.\n\n===Heian Period (794 to 1185)===\n[[File:Byodo-in Uji01pbs2640.jpg|thumb|250px|[[By\u014dd\u014d-in]] (Pure Land sect), located in [[Uji, Kyoto]]]]\nDuring the Heian period the capital was shifted from Nara to Kyoto.

In 1185 the [[Kamakura shogunate]] was established at [[Kamakura]].{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=181}}\n\nThis period saw the introduction of the two schools that had perhaps the greatest impact on the country: the schools of [[Pure Land Buddhism]], promulgated by evangelists such as [[Genshin]] and articulated by monks such as [[H\u014dnen]], which emphasize salvation through faith in [[Amit\u0101bha]] and remain the largest Buddhist sect in Japan (and throughout Asia); and [[Zen]], promulgated by monks such as [[Eisai]] and [[D\u014dgen]], which emphasize liberation through the insight of meditation, which were equally rapidly adopted by the upper classes and had a profound impact on the [[culture of Japan]].\n\nAdditionally, it was during the Kamakura period that the influential monk [[Nichiren]] began teaching devotion to the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]''. Eventually, his disciples formed their own school of [[Nichiren Buddhism]], which includes various sects that have their own interpretations of Nichiren's teachings. Nichiren Buddhism established the foundation of Japanese Buddhism in the thirteenth century. The school is known for its sociopolitical activism and looks to reform society through faith.<ref>Cathy Cantwell and Hiroko Kawanami, \"Buddhism.\" Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations, Third Edition.

The only exception was the [[\u014cbaku]] lineage, which was introduced in the 17th century during the [[Edo period]] by [[Ingen]], a Chinese monk. Ingen had been a member of the [[Linji school]], the Chinese equivalent of Rinzai, which had developed separately from the Japanese branch for hundreds of years. Thus, when Ingen journeyed to Japan following the fall of the [[Ming dynasty]] to the [[Manchu people]], his teachings were seen as a separate school. The \u014cbaku school was named after [[Mount Huangbo]] ({{cjkv|c=\u9ec4\u6a97\u5c71|p=Hu\u00e1ngb\u00f2 sh\u0101n|r=\u014cbaku san}}), which had been Ingen's home in China. Also notable during the period was the publication of an exceptionally high quality reprint of the Ming-era ''[[Tripi\u1e6daka]]'' by [[Tetsugen Doko]], a renowned master of the \u014cbaku school.<ref name=\"Buddhanet\"/>\n\n===Meiji Restoration (1868\u20131912)===\nWith the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, the new government adopted a strong anti-Buddhist attitude, and [[Haibutsu kishaku|a movement to eradicate Buddhism]] and bring Shinto to ascendancy arose throughout the country due to the strong connections of Buddhism to the Sh\u014dguns.\n\nDuring the [[Meiji period]] (1868\u20131912), after a coup in 1868, Japan abandoned its feudal system and opened up to Western modernism.  Shinto became the state religion.

However, in comparison to Chinese or Korean Buddhist schools that are generally more united and less sectarian in their groupings, Buddhist denominations in Japan have developed into independent sects with autonomous organizations that have differing emphases on the doctrine and separate lay followings.\" (Authors: Kawananami, Partridge, and Woodhead  p. 82.)\n\nIn the post-Meiji, pre-WWII period, there were officially 13 schools and 56 branches of traditional Buddhism (i.e., those not established in modern times). The official schools included three from the Nara period, two from the Heian period (Tendai and Shingon), four Pure Land schools, three Zen schools (Rinzai, S\u014dt\u014d and \u014cbaku), and Nichiren. During the war, this was halved to 28 branches, but the law enforcing this was repealed following the end of the war, allowing former branches to return.

Buddhist institutions were used by the shogunate to control the country. During the Edo (1600\u20131868) this power was constricted, to be followed by persecutions at the beginning of the [[Meiji restoration]] (1868\u20131912).{{sfn|Snelling|1987}} Buddhist temples played a major administrative role during the Edo period, through the [[Danka system|Danka]] or ''terauke'' system. In this, Japanese citizens were required to register at their local Buddhist temples and obtain a certification (''terauke''), which became necessary to function in society. At first, this system was put into place to suppress Christianity, but over time it took on the larger role of census and population control.\n\n===Artistic influence===\n[[File:WindGods.JPG|thumb|350px|Iconographical evolution of the Wind God.<br/>\nLeft: Greek wind god from [[Hadda, Afghanistan]], second century.<br />\nMiddle: wind god from [[Kizil Caves]], [[Tarim Basin]], 7th century.<br />\nRight: Japanese wind god [[F\u016bjin]], 17th century.]]\nIn Japan, Buddhist art started to develop as the country converted to Buddhism in 548. Some tiles from the [[Asuka period]] (shown above), the first period following the conversion of the country to Buddhism, display a strikingly classical style, with ample Hellenistic dress and realistically rendered body shape characteristic of [[Greco-Buddhist art]].\n\nBuddhist art became extremely varied in its expression. Many elements of Greco-Buddhist art remain to this day however, such as the [[Hercules]] inspiration behind the [[Nio]] guardian deities in front of Japanese Buddhist temples, or representations of the Buddha reminiscent of Greek art such as the Buddha in [[Kamakura]].{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Katsumi Tanabe: \"Needless to say, the influence of Greek art on Japanese Buddhist art, via the Buddhist art of Gandhara and India, was already partly known in, for example, the comparison of the wavy drapery of the Buddha images, in what was, originally, a typical Greek style\" (Katsumi Tanabe, \"Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan\", p. 19)}}\n\n====Deities====\n[[File:Heracles-Shukongoshin.JPG|thumb|350px|Iconographical evolution from the Greek god [[Heracles]] to the Japanese god Shukong\u014dshin.

In consistency with Greek iconography for the wind god [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]], the Japanese wind god holds above his head with his two hands a draping or \"wind bag\" in the same general attitude.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|>Katusmi Tanabe: \"The Japanese wind god images do not belong to a separate tradition apart from that of their Western counter-parts but share the same origins. (...) One of the characteristics of these Far Eastern wind god images is the wind bag held by this god with both hands, the origin of which can be traced back to the shawl or mantle worn by [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]/ Oado.\" (Katsumi Tanabe, \"Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan\", p. 21)}} The abundance of hair has been kept in the Japanese rendering, as well as exaggerated facial features.\n\nAnother Buddhist deity, Shukong\u014dshin, one of the wrath-filled protector deities of Buddhist temples in Japan, is also an interesting case of transmission of the image of the famous Greek god Heracles to East Asia along the [[Silk Road]]. Heracles was used in Greco-Buddhist art to represent [[Vajrapani]], the protector of the Buddha, and his representation was then used in China and Japan to depict the protector gods of Buddhist temples.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Katsumi Tanabe: \"The origin of the image of Vajrapani should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modelled after that of Hercules. (...) The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterwards transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardian Deities ([[Nio]]).\" (Katsumi Tanabe, \"Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan\", p. 23)}}\n\n====Artistic motifs====\n[[File:NaraVines&Grapes.JPG|thumb|200px|Vine and grape scrolls from Nara, 7th century.]]\nThe artistic inspiration from Greek floral scrolls is found quite literally in the decoration of Japanese roof tiles, one of the only remaining element of wooden architecture throughout centuries. The clearest ones are from the 7th century Nara temple building tiles, some of them exactly depicting vines and grapes. These motifs have evolved towards more symbolic representations, but essentially remain to this day in many Japanese traditional buildings.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The transmission of the floral scroll pattern from West to East is presented in the regular exhibition of Ancient Japanese Art, at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].}}\n\n===Temples===\n{{main|List of National Treasures of Japan (temples)}}\n[[Soga no Umako]] built H\u014dk\u014d-ji, the first temple in Japan, between 588 to 596. It was later renamed as [[Asuka-dera]] for [[Asuka, Yamato|Asuka]], the name of the capital where it was located. Unlike early [[Shinto shrine]]s, early [[Buddhist temple]]s were highly ornamental and strictly symmetrical. The early [[Heian period]] (9th\u201310th century) saw an evolution of style based on the [[mikky\u014d]] sects Tendai and [[Shingon Buddhism]]. The [[Daibutsuy\u014d]] style and the [[Zensh\u016by\u014d]] style emerged in the late 12th or early 13th century.\n\n==Buddhist holidays==\n\n===Obon (\u304a\u76c6)===\nAlthough its date and practices vary region to region, the [[Bon Festival]] is celebrated primarily in Japan and in communities with large Japanese diaspora communities.

Eventually, his disciples formed their own school of [[Nichiren Buddhism]], which includes various sects that have their own interpretations of Nichiren's teachings. Nichiren Buddhism established the foundation of Japanese Buddhism in the thirteenth century. The school is known for its sociopolitical activism and looks to reform society through faith.<ref>Cathy Cantwell and Hiroko Kawanami, \"Buddhism.\" Religions in the Modern World: Traditions and Transformations, Third Edition.

The only exception was the [[\u014cbaku]] lineage, which was introduced in the 17th century during the [[Edo period]] by [[Ingen]], a Chinese monk. Ingen had been a member of the [[Linji school]], the Chinese equivalent of Rinzai, which had developed separately from the Japanese branch for hundreds of years. Thus, when Ingen journeyed to Japan following the fall of the [[Ming dynasty]] to the [[Manchu people]], his teachings were seen as a separate school. The \u014cbaku school was named after [[Mount Huangbo]] ({{cjkv|c=\u9ec4\u6a97\u5c71|p=Hu\u00e1ngb\u00f2 sh\u0101n|r=\u014cbaku san}}), which had been Ingen's home in China.

Shinto became the state religion.

However, in comparison to Chinese or Korean Buddhist schools that are generally more united and less sectarian in their groupings, Buddhist denominations in Japan have developed into independent sects with autonomous organizations that have differing emphases on the doctrine and separate lay followings.\" (Authors: Kawananami, Partridge, and Woodhead  p. 82.)\n\nIn the post-Meiji, pre-WWII period, there were officially 13 schools and 56 branches of traditional Buddhism (i.e., those not established in modern times). The official schools included three from the Nara period, two from the Heian period (Tendai and Shingon), four Pure Land schools, three Zen schools (Rinzai, S\u014dt\u014d and \u014cbaku), and Nichiren. During the war, this was halved to 28 branches, but the law enforcing this was repealed following the end of the war, allowing former branches to return.

The [[Fuju-fuse|Nichiren Fuju-fuse-ha]] sub-sect of Nichiren Buddhism was abolished in 1669 and legalised again in 1876.<br/>\nToday's Nichiren Buddhism is represented by traditional-oriented schools such as [[Honmon Butsury\u016b-sh\u016b]], [[Nichiren-sh\u016b]] and [[Nichiren Sh\u014dsh\u016b]] and more recent movements like the [[Soka Gakkai]], [[Rissh\u014d K\u014dsei Kai]], [[Reiy\u016bkai]] and [[Nipponzan-My\u014dh\u014dji-Daisanga]].

Buddhist institutions were used by the shogunate to control the country. During the Edo (1600\u20131868) this power was constricted, to be followed by persecutions at the beginning of the [[Meiji restoration]] (1868\u20131912).{{sfn|Snelling|1987}} Buddhist temples played a major administrative role during the Edo period, through the [[Danka system|Danka]] or ''terauke'' system. In this, Japanese citizens were required to register at their local Buddhist temples and obtain a certification (''terauke''), which became necessary to function in society. At first, this system was put into place to suppress Christianity, but over time it took on the larger role of census and population control.\n\n===Artistic influence===\n[[File:WindGods.JPG|thumb|350px|Iconographical evolution of the Wind God.<br/>\nLeft: Greek wind god from [[Hadda, Afghanistan]], second century.<br />\nMiddle: wind god from [[Kizil Caves]], [[Tarim Basin]], 7th century.<br />\nRight: Japanese wind god [[F\u016bjin]], 17th century.]]\nIn Japan, Buddhist art started to develop as the country converted to Buddhism in 548. Some tiles from the [[Asuka period]] (shown above), the first period following the conversion of the country to Buddhism, display a strikingly classical style, with ample Hellenistic dress and realistically rendered body shape characteristic of [[Greco-Buddhist art]].\n\nBuddhist art became extremely varied in its expression. Many elements of Greco-Buddhist art remain to this day however, such as the [[Hercules]] inspiration behind the [[Nio]] guardian deities in front of Japanese Buddhist temples, or representations of the Buddha reminiscent of Greek art such as the Buddha in [[Kamakura]].{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Katsumi Tanabe: \"Needless to say, the influence of Greek art on Japanese Buddhist art, via the Buddhist art of Gandhara and India, was already partly known in, for example, the comparison of the wavy drapery of the Buddha images, in what was, originally, a typical Greek style\" (Katsumi Tanabe, \"Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan\", p. 19)}}\n\n====Deities====\n[[File:Heracles-Shukongoshin.JPG|thumb|350px|Iconographical evolution from the Greek god [[Heracles]] to the Japanese god Shukong\u014dshin. From left to right:<br />\n1) Heracles (Louvre Museum).<br />\n2) Heracles on coin of [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] king [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius I]].<br />\n3) [[Vajrapani]], the protector of the Buddha, depicted as Heracles in the Greco-Buddhist art of [[Gandhara]].<br />\n4) [[Nio|Shukong\u014dshin]], manifestation of [[Vajrapani]], as protector deity of Buddhist temples in Japan.]]\nVarious other Greco-Buddhist artistic influences can be found in the Japanese Buddhist pantheon, the most striking being that of the Japanese wind god [[F\u016bjin]]. In consistency with Greek iconography for the wind god [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]], the Japanese wind god holds above his head with his two hands a draping or \"wind bag\" in the same general attitude.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|>Katusmi Tanabe: \"The Japanese wind god images do not belong to a separate tradition apart from that of their Western counter-parts but share the same origins. (...) One of the characteristics of these Far Eastern wind god images is the wind bag held by this god with both hands, the origin of which can be traced back to the shawl or mantle worn by [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]/ Oado.\" (Katsumi Tanabe, \"Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan\", p. 21)}} The abundance of hair has been kept in the Japanese rendering, as well as exaggerated facial features.\n\nAnother Buddhist deity, Shukong\u014dshin, one of the wrath-filled protector deities of Buddhist temples in Japan, is also an interesting case of transmission of the image of the famous Greek god Heracles to East Asia along the [[Silk Road]]. Heracles was used in Greco-Buddhist art to represent [[Vajrapani]], the protector of the Buddha, and his representation was then used in China and Japan to depict the protector gods of Buddhist temples.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Katsumi Tanabe: \"The origin of the image of Vajrapani should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modelled after that of Hercules. (...) The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterwards transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardian Deities ([[Nio]]).\" (Katsumi Tanabe, \"Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan\", p. 23)}}\n\n====Artistic motifs====\n[[File:NaraVines&Grapes.JPG|thumb|200px|Vine and grape scrolls from Nara, 7th century.]]\nThe artistic inspiration from Greek floral scrolls is found quite literally in the decoration of Japanese roof tiles, one of the only remaining element of wooden architecture throughout centuries. The clearest ones are from the 7th century Nara temple building tiles, some of them exactly depicting vines and grapes. These motifs have evolved towards more symbolic representations, but essentially remain to this day in many Japanese traditional buildings.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The transmission of the floral scroll pattern from West to East is presented in the regular exhibition of Ancient Japanese Art, at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].}}\n\n===Temples===\n{{main|List of National Treasures of Japan (temples)}}\n[[Soga no Umako]] built H\u014dk\u014d-ji, the first temple in Japan, between 588 to 596. It was later renamed as [[Asuka-dera]] for [[Asuka, Yamato|Asuka]], the name of the capital where it was located. Unlike early [[Shinto shrine]]s, early [[Buddhist temple]]s were highly ornamental and strictly symmetrical. The early [[Heian period]] (9th\u201310th century) saw an evolution of style based on the [[mikky\u014d]] sects Tendai and [[Shingon Buddhism]]. The [[Daibutsuy\u014d]] style and the [[Zensh\u016by\u014d]] style emerged in the late 12th or early 13th century.\n\n==Buddhist holidays==\n\n===Obon (\u304a\u76c6)===\nAlthough its date and practices vary region to region, the [[Bon Festival]] is celebrated primarily in Japan and in communities with large Japanese diaspora communities. It is believed that the spirits of the dead return to earth for three days and visit the family shrines or graves. It is customary to clean the graves and to hold [[family reunion]]s.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Buddhist deities]]\n*[[Buddhist modernism]]\n*[[Buddhist philosophy]]\n*[[History of Buddhism]]\n*[[Ichibata Yakushi Kyodan]]\n* [[Japanese Buddhist pantheon]]\n*[[Kaich\u014d]]\n*[[Kanjin]]\n*[[Nara National Museum]]\n*[[Religion in Japan]]\n*[[Shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d]]\n*''[[Zen at War]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert|authorlink1=Robert Buswell Jr.|last2=Lopez|first2=Donald S.|authorlink2=Donald S.

The theatre shares the same building with the [[Cluj-Napoca Romanian Opera|Romanian Opera]].\n\n==Building==\nThe theatre was built between 1904 and 1906 by the famous [[Austrians|Austrian]] architects [[Ferdinand Fellner|Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer]] who designed several theatres and palaces across Europe in the late 19th century and early 20th century, including the theatres in [[Ia\u015fi]], [[Oradea]], [[Timi\u0219oara]] and [[Chernivtsi]] (Romanian: Cern\u0103u\u0163i).\n\nThe project was financed using only private capital (Sandor Ujfalfy bequeathed his domains and estates from Szolnok-Doboka to the National Theatre Fund from Kolozsv\u00e1r)\n\nThe theatre opened on 8 September 1906 with [[Ferenc Herczeg]]'s ''Bujdos\u00f3k'' and until 1919, as Cluj was part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], it was home to the local Hungarian National Theatre ({{lang-hu|Nemzeti Sz\u00ednh\u00e1z}}). The last performance of the Hungarian troupe was held on September 30, 1919 and presented Shakespeare's Hamlet: ''\"Horatio, I am dead; / Thou livest; report me and my cause aright / To the unsatisfied.\"''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.korunk.org/konyvek/letoltkonyvek/janovicsjeno.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044327/http://www.korunk.org/konyvek/letoltkonyvek/janovicsjeno.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-28 }}</ref>\n\nSince 1919, the building has been home to the local Romanian National Theatre and Romanian Opera, while the local [[Cluj-Napoca Hungarian Opera|Hungarian Theatre and Opera]] received the theatre building in Emil Isac street, close to the Central Park and [[Some\u015ful Mic River]].\n\nAfter the [[Second Vienna Award]] the building was again the home of the Hungarian Theatre. On 31 October 1944 the Romanian and Hungarian actors celebrating the freedom of the city held a common performance, the revenue being donated to the Russian and Romanian wounded soldiers.<ref>Andr\u00e1s Fodor, ''Kolozsv\u00e1ri k\u00e9pesk\u00f6nyv.''

The inauguration performance, ''Poemul Unirei'' ({{lang-en|The Unification Poem}}) by Zaharia B\u00e2rsan, took place on 1 December 1919.\n\nThe founder of the National Theatre of Cluj, as well as his first director, was [[Zaharia B\u00e2rsan]], actor, stage director, playwright and animator. Some of the famous first members of the National Theatre include Olimpia B\u00e2rsan, St\u0103nescu-Papa, Dem Mih\u0103ilescu-Br\u0103ila, Neam\u0163u-Ottonel, Jeana Popovici, Stanca Alexandrescu, Ion T\u00e2lvan, \u015etefan Braborescu etc.\n\nBetween 1936 and 1940, the directorship of Victor Papilian meant a more profound opening towards modernity. In that period, a studio was created, in order to facilitate the contact of the public with the modern dramatic productions. Some famous actors of the time include Magda T\u00e2lvan, Maria Cupcea, Titus Croitoru, Violeta Boito\u015f, Viorica Iuga, Nicolae Sasu, Gheorghe Aurelian etc.\n\nIn 1940, as a result of the [[Second Vienna Award]], the theatre, like other Romanian institutions, had to move to the Romanian part of the artificially divided [[Transylvania]]. While the [[Babe\u015f-Bolyai University|local university]] moved to [[Sibiu]], the national theatre moved to [[Timi\u0219oara]]. In December 1945, at the end of [[World War II]], as Cluj became part of Romania once again, the theatrical institution returned to Cluj and restarted its activity, under the directorship of Aurel Buteanu.\n\nBetween 1948 and 1964, although under the initial stages of the [[Communist Romania|Communist]] regime, the theatre remarkably managed to keep true to its artistic values. Famous names of the time include Marietta Sadova, \u015etefan Braborescu, Radu Stanca, Viorica Cernucan, Maia \u0162ipan-Kaufmann, Ligia Moga, Gheorghe M. Nu\u0163escu, Emilia Hodi\u015f, Gheorghe Radu, Aurel Giurumia, Alexandru Munte, Silvia Ghelan etc.\n\nAfter 1965, as [[Vlad Mugur]] became its director, the theatre focused on aesthetic values, refusing the ideological and moralising line imposed by the increasingly strict Communist authorities. The performances became based on a balanced type of [[Modernism]]. In this period the National Theatre established itself as an important European theatrical institution, due to the prestigious artistic tours in [[Italy]] with performances such as ''[[Iphigeneia in Tauris]]'' by [[Euripides]], ''[[Caligula (play)|Caligula]]'' by [[Albert Camus]], ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]]. Among the young famous artists of the time there were Silvia Popovici, Valentino Dain, [[Melania Ursu]], Valeria Seciu, George Motoi, Dorel Vi\u015fan, Anton Tauf.\n\nThe directors that followed, Ion Vlad, Maia \u0162ipan-Kaufmann, Petre Buc\u015fa, Constantin Cuble\u015fan and Horia B\u0103descu, continued to try (and succeeded quite frequently) to avoid the Communist [[censorship]] by maintaining a balance between national and universal dramatic texts and between classical and modern elements. Famous artists of the time include [[Mihai M\u0103niu\u0163iu]], Gelu Bogdan Iva\u015fcu, Maria Munteanu, Ileana Negru, Miriam Cuibus, Marius Bodochi, Petre B\u0103cioiu, Dorin Andone. In this period, performances like ''S\u0103pt\u0103m\u00eena luminat\u0103'' by M. S\u0103ulescu, ''[[La Le\u00e7on|The Lesson]]'' by [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]], and ''[[Murder in the Cathedral]]'' by [[T. S. Eliot]] were staged during several tours in [[England]], [[France]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Finland]], the [[United States|USA]] and [[Egypt]].\n\nAfter the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], the performances became more diverse and modern. Famous names of this period include Victor Ioan Frunz\u0103, Mihai M\u0103niu\u0163iu, Mona Chiril\u0103, Anca Bradu, Th. Cristian Popescu, [[Liviu Ciulei]], Crin Teodorescu, Lucian Giurchescu, Mircea Marosin, Sorana Coroam\u0103-Stanca, Horea Popescu, Gheorghe Harag, Dinu Cernescu. The directors of the theatre until 2000 were, successively, V.I. Frunz\u0103, Anton Tauf and Dorel Vi\u015fan.\n\nSince 2011, the director of the Cluj-Napoca National Theatre has been Mihai Maniutiu. The performances comprise original dramatic works (classic and modern, Romanian and universal).

The inauguration performance, ''Poemul Unirei'' ({{lang-en|The Unification Poem}}) by Zaharia B\u00e2rsan, took place on 1 December 1919.\n\nThe founder of the National Theatre of Cluj, as well as his first director, was [[Zaharia B\u00e2rsan]], actor, stage director, playwright and animator. Some of the famous first members of the National Theatre include Olimpia B\u00e2rsan, St\u0103nescu-Papa, Dem Mih\u0103ilescu-Br\u0103ila, Neam\u0163u-Ottonel, Jeana Popovici, Stanca Alexandrescu, Ion T\u00e2lvan, \u015etefan Braborescu etc.\n\nBetween 1936 and 1940, the directorship of Victor Papilian meant a more profound opening towards modernity. In that period, a studio was created, in order to facilitate the contact of the public with the modern dramatic productions. Some famous actors of the time include Magda T\u00e2lvan, Maria Cupcea, Titus Croitoru, Violeta Boito\u015f, Viorica Iuga, Nicolae Sasu, Gheorghe Aurelian etc.\n\nIn 1940, as a result of the [[Second Vienna Award]], the theatre, like other Romanian institutions, had to move to the Romanian part of the artificially divided [[Transylvania]].

'Generally recognized' means the knowledge and practices described are applicable to most projects most of the time and there is a consensus about their value and usefulness. 'Good practice' means there is a general agreement that the application of the knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques can enhance the chance of success over many projects.\"<ref name=PMBOK2012/> This means that sometimes the \"latest\" project management trends, often promoted by consultants, may not be part of the latest version of ''The PMBOK Guide''.\n\nHowever, the 6th Edition of the PMBOK Guide now includes an \"Agile Practice Guide\"\n\n== Contents ==\n''The PMBOK Guide'' is process-based, meaning it describes work as being accomplished by processes. This approach is consistent with other management standards such as [[ISO 9000]] and the [[Software Engineering Institute]]'s [[CMMI]]. Processes overlap and interact throughout a project or its various phases.\n\n* Inputs (documents, plans, designs, etc.)\n* Tools and Techniques (mechanisms applied to inputs)\n* Outputs (documents, plans, designs, etc.)\n\nA Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge \u2014 Sixth Edition provides guidelines for managing individual projects and defines project management related concepts. It also describes the project management life cycle and its related processes, as well as the project life cycle.<ref name=\"PMBOK2012\">Project Management Institute, '''A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge''' \u2013 Fifth Edition, Project Management Institute Inc., 2013, Page 2.</ref> and for the first time it includes an \"Agile Practice Guide\".\n\nThe PMBOK as described in the Guide recognizes 49 processes that fall into five basic process groups and ten knowledge areas that are typical of most projects, most of the time.\n\n=== Process groups ===\nThe five ''process groups'' are:\n# '''Initiating''': processes performed to define a new project or a new phase of an existing project by obtaining authorization to start the project or phase.\n# '''Planning''': Those processes required to establish the scope of the project, refine the objectives, and define the course of action required to attain the objectives that the project was undertaken to achieve.\n# '''Executing''': Those processes performed to complete the work defined in the project management plan to satisfy the project specifications\n# '''Monitoring and Controlling''': Those processes required to track, review, and regulate the progress and performance of the project; identify any areas in which changes to the plan are required; and initiate the corresponding changes.\n# '''Closing''': Those processes performed to finalize all activities across all Process Groups to formally close the project or phase.\n\n=== Knowledge areas ===\nThe ten ''knowledge areas'', each of which contains some or all of the project management processes, are:\n\n# [[Project Integration Management]] : the processes and activities needed to identify, define, combine, unify, and coordinate the various processes and project management activities within the [[project management process groups]].\n# Project [[Scope (project management)|Scope]] management : the processes required to ensure that the project includes all the work required, and only the work required, to complete the project successfully.\n# [[Project Schedule Management]] : the processes required to manage the timely completion of the project. Until the 6th edition of the PMBOK Guide this was called \"Project Time Management\"\n# [[Project cost management|Project Cost Management]] : the processes involved in planning, estimating, budgeting, financing, funding, managing, and controlling costs so that the project can be completed within the approved budget.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n# Project [[Quality Management]] : the processes and activities of the performing organization that determine quality policies, objectives, and responsibilities so that the project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken.\n# Project [[Resource Management]] : the processes that organize, manage, and lead the project team. Until the 6th edition of the PMBOK Guide this was called \"Project Human Resource Management\"\n# Project [[Communications Management]] : the processes that are required to ensure timely and appropriate planning, collection, creation, distribution, storage, retrieval, management, control, monitoring, and the ultimate disposition of project information.\n# [[Project Risk Management]] : the processes of conducting risk management planning, identification, analysis, response planning, and controlling risk on a project.\n# [[Project Procurement Management]] : the processes necessary to purchase or acquire products, services, or results needed from outside the project team.  Processes in this area include Procurement Planning, Solicitation Planning, Solicitation, Source Selection, Contract Administration, and Contract Closeout.\n# Project [[Stakeholder management|Stakeholder Management]] : the processes required to identify all people or organizations impacted by the project, analyzing stakeholder expectations and impact on the project, and developing appropriate management strategies for effectively engaging stakeholders in project decisions and execution.\n\nEach of the ten knowledge areas contains the processes that need to be accomplished within its discipline in order to achieve effective project management.  Each of these processes also falls into one of the five process groups, creating a matrix structure such that every process can be related to one knowledge area and one process group.\n\n== Extensions ==\nWhile the ''PMBOK Guide'' is meant to offer a general guide to manage most projects most of the time, there are currently three official extensions: \n* ''Software Extension to the PMBOK Guide'' \n* ''Construction Extension to the PMBOK Guide'' \n* ''Government Extension to the PMBOK Guide''\n\n==Criticism and alternatives==\nThe PMBOK is a widely accepted standard in project management, however there are alternatives to the PMBOK standard, and PMBOK does have its critics.  One thrust of critique has come from the [[critical chain]] developers and followers (e.g. [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] and [[Lawrence P. Leach]]),<ref>[[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] . {{ISBN|0884271536}} and Lawrence P. Leach. (Artech House Professional Development Library). {{ISBN|1580530745}}</ref> as opposed to [[critical path method]] adherents. The PMBOK Guide section on Project Time Management does indicate Critical Chain as an alternative method to Critical Path. \n\nA second strand of criticism originates in [[Lean Construction]]. This approach emphasises the lack of two way communication in the PMBOK model and offers an alternative which emphasises a [[language/action perspective]] and [[continual improvement]] in the planning process.<ref>Koskela, L. & Howell, G.

That document was to some extent based on earlier work that began with a [[white paper]] published in 1983 called the \"Ethics, Standards, and Accreditation Committee Final Report.\" The second edition was published in 2000.<ref>A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, copyright page, edition 2 {{ISBN|1-880410-12-5}}, and edition 3 2004 {{ISBN|978-1-930699-45-8}}, and edition 4 2008 {{ISBN|1-933890-51-7}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the ''PMBOK Guide \u2014 Third Edition'' was published with major changes from the previous editions. The ''Fourth edition'' was published in 2008. The ''Fifth Edition'' was released in 2013.\n\nIn September 2017 the English-language version of ''The PMBOK Guide \u2014 The Sixth Edition was released.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://projectmanagement.plus/new-pmbok-guide-6th-edition-and-pmp-exam-change-everything-you-need-to-know|title=PMBOK\u00ae Guide 6th Edition will be released on 6th of September 2017 - everything you need to know about the new PMBoK guide Edition and the related exam changes!!|date=2017-06-16|website=pmplus - the blog|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\n== Purpose ==\n''The PMBOK Guide'' is intended to be a \"subset of the project management body of knowledge that is generally recognized as a good practice. 'Generally recognized' means the knowledge and practices described are applicable to most projects most of the time and there is a consensus about their value and usefulness. 'Good practice' means there is a general agreement that the application of the knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques can enhance the chance of success over many projects.\"<ref name=PMBOK2012/> This means that sometimes the \"latest\" project management trends, often promoted by consultants, may not be part of the latest version of ''The PMBOK Guide''.\n\nHowever, the 6th Edition of the PMBOK Guide now includes an \"Agile Practice Guide\"\n\n== Contents ==\n''The PMBOK Guide'' is process-based, meaning it describes work as being accomplished by processes. This approach is consistent with other management standards such as [[ISO 9000]] and the [[Software Engineering Institute]]'s [[CMMI]]. Processes overlap and interact throughout a project or its various phases.\n\n* Inputs (documents, plans, designs, etc.)\n* Tools and Techniques (mechanisms applied to inputs)\n* Outputs (documents, plans, designs, etc.)\n\nA Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge \u2014 Sixth Edition provides guidelines for managing individual projects and defines project management related concepts. It also describes the project management life cycle and its related processes, as well as the project life cycle.<ref name=\"PMBOK2012\">Project Management Institute, '''A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge''' \u2013 Fifth Edition, Project Management Institute Inc., 2013, Page 2.</ref> and for the first time it includes an \"Agile Practice Guide\".\n\nThe PMBOK as described in the Guide recognizes 49 processes that fall into five basic process groups and ten knowledge areas that are typical of most projects, most of the time.\n\n=== Process groups ===\nThe five ''process groups'' are:\n# '''Initiating''': processes performed to define a new project or a new phase of an existing project by obtaining authorization to start the project or phase.\n# '''Planning''': Those processes required to establish the scope of the project, refine the objectives, and define the course of action required to attain the objectives that the project was undertaken to achieve.\n# '''Executing''': Those processes performed to complete the work defined in the project management plan to satisfy the project specifications\n# '''Monitoring and Controlling''': Those processes required to track, review, and regulate the progress and performance of the project; identify any areas in which changes to the plan are required; and initiate the corresponding changes.\n# '''Closing''': Those processes performed to finalize all activities across all Process Groups to formally close the project or phase.\n\n=== Knowledge areas ===\nThe ten ''knowledge areas'', each of which contains some or all of the project management processes, are:\n\n# [[Project Integration Management]] : the processes and activities needed to identify, define, combine, unify, and coordinate the various processes and project management activities within the [[project management process groups]].\n# Project [[Scope (project management)|Scope]] management : the processes required to ensure that the project includes all the work required, and only the work required, to complete the project successfully.\n# [[Project Schedule Management]] : the processes required to manage the timely completion of the project. Until the 6th edition of the PMBOK Guide this was called \"Project Time Management\"\n# [[Project cost management|Project Cost Management]] : the processes involved in planning, estimating, budgeting, financing, funding, managing, and controlling costs so that the project can be completed within the approved budget.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n# Project [[Quality Management]] : the processes and activities of the performing organization that determine quality policies, objectives, and responsibilities so that the project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken.\n# Project [[Resource Management]] : the processes that organize, manage, and lead the project team. Until the 6th edition of the PMBOK Guide this was called \"Project Human Resource Management\"\n# Project [[Communications Management]] : the processes that are required to ensure timely and appropriate planning, collection, creation, distribution, storage, retrieval, management, control, monitoring, and the ultimate disposition of project information.\n# [[Project Risk Management]] : the processes of conducting risk management planning, identification, analysis, response planning, and controlling risk on a project.\n# [[Project Procurement Management]] : the processes necessary to purchase or acquire products, services, or results needed from outside the project team.  Processes in this area include Procurement Planning, Solicitation Planning, Solicitation, Source Selection, Contract Administration, and Contract Closeout.\n# Project [[Stakeholder management|Stakeholder Management]] : the processes required to identify all people or organizations impacted by the project, analyzing stakeholder expectations and impact on the project, and developing appropriate management strategies for effectively engaging stakeholders in project decisions and execution.\n\nEach of the ten knowledge areas contains the processes that need to be accomplished within its discipline in order to achieve effective project management.  Each of these processes also falls into one of the five process groups, creating a matrix structure such that every process can be related to one knowledge area and one process group.\n\n== Extensions ==\nWhile the ''PMBOK Guide'' is meant to offer a general guide to manage most projects most of the time, there are currently three official extensions: \n* ''Software Extension to the PMBOK Guide'' \n* ''Construction Extension to the PMBOK Guide'' \n* ''Government Extension to the PMBOK Guide''\n\n==Criticism and alternatives==\nThe PMBOK is a widely accepted standard in project management, however there are alternatives to the PMBOK standard, and PMBOK does have its critics.  One thrust of critique has come from the [[critical chain]] developers and followers (e.g. [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] and [[Lawrence P. Leach]]),<ref>[[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] . {{ISBN|0884271536}} and Lawrence P. Leach. (Artech House Professional Development Library). {{ISBN|1580530745}}</ref> as opposed to [[critical path method]] adherents. The PMBOK Guide section on Project Time Management does indicate Critical Chain as an alternative method to Critical Path. \n\nA second strand of criticism originates in [[Lean Construction]]. This approach emphasises the lack of two way communication in the PMBOK model and offers an alternative which emphasises a [[language/action perspective]] and [[continual improvement]] in the planning process.<ref>Koskela, L. & Howell, G.

Charlton Edholm''' (October 28, 1854 &ndash; November 29, 1935) was an American reformer and journalist. She worked as a journalist for twenty years. Edholm was appointed World's Superintendent of Press work, at the [[Boston]] Convention of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU) in 1891. Much of her work was along Christian, [[Temperance movement in the United States|temperance]] and philanthropic lines. For many years, her work averaged 250 columns of original matter, in which every phase of the labors of the WCTU was depicted in thousands of papers in the English-speaking world.{{sfn|Chapin|1895|p=15}}\n\nWhile editing the booklet, \"Around the World with Jesus,\" by evangelist [[Charles Nelson Crittenton]], she became interested in the rescue work among [[Sex trafficking|traffic-ed]] girls, and her book entitled ''The Traffic in Girls and Florence Crittenton Missions'' was the result. Edholm became so interested in the plight of these betrayed and enslaved girls that she determined to make [[Social purity movement|social purity]] work her specialty, and continued to speak and write in their behalf. In 1886, Edholm removed to [[Oakland, California]]; by 1893, she was living in [[Chicago]] with her only son.{{sfn|Chapin|1895|p=16}}\n\n==Early life and education==\nMary Grace Charlton was born in [[Freeport, Illinois]], October 28, 1854.{{sfn|Leonard|Marquis|1906|p=439}} Her journalistic gift was the inheritance from her father, James B. Charlton, and her mother, Lucy Gow Charlton, who were both fine writers along reformatory lines, especially the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]], the temperance movement, and [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]].\n\nShe was educated in public schools, and college through her sophomore year.{{sfn|Leonard|Marquis|1906|p=439}} During her sophomore year at [[Monmouth College]], she wrote her exhibition essay on the subject, \"Shall our Women Vote?\" As a test, she sent it for publication to the ''Woman's Journal'' of [[Boston]], and it was published.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=272}}\n\n==Career==\nAfter graduating, she contributed articles on [[women's suffrage]] and [[temperance movement|temperance]] to various periodicals.\n\nShe married Osborn L. Edholm, a journalist, in 1878. During her marriage, she developed still more her love for editorial and reportorial work, and for several years they traveled together extensively, and she thereby gained the knowledge and information which comes alone of travel, During those years, her descriptive articles appeared in the ''[[New York World]]'', the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', ''[[Press-Republican|Republican]]'', and ''[[Chicago Inter Ocean]]''. Both before and after the birth of her children, she wrote continuously.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=273}}\n\nIn 1886, Edholm moved to Oakland, California and was unanimously elected official reporter for the WCTU; in 1891, she was named superintendent of press. Annually, she wrote about 250 columns of original temperance matter for over 200 papers, including the dailies of [[San Francisco]], Oakland, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[New Orleans]], Boston and [[New York City]], as well as the ''Union Signal'' and the ''New York Voice''. She conducted three WCTU excursions across the United States. Her promotion came through [[Frances E. Willard]] and [[Lady Henry Somerset]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=273}}\n\nShe served as secretary for the International Federation Women's Press League,<ref name=rossiter/>{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=272}} and was editor of ''The Christian Home'' in Oakland.<ref name=rossiter>{{cite wikisource |title=The Biographical Dictionary of America |page=416 |year=1906 |editor-last=Johnson |editor-first=Rossiter |volume=3}}</ref>\n\nFor years, Edholm was interested in the rescue of [[Sex trafficking in the United States|trafficked]] girls and she wrote hundreds of articles in defense of outraged womanhood, in such papers as the ''[[Woman's Journal]]'',  ''[[The Woman's Tribune]]'', and the ''[[Hutchings' Illustrated California Magazine|California Illustrated Magazine]]'', where her articles depicted the horrors of the slave traffic in Chinese women for immoral purposes. In evangelistic meetings in Oakland, she met the millionaire evangelist, Crittenton, the founder of [[National Florence Crittenton Mission|Florence Crittenton Mission]]s for the rescue of trafficked girls, and at once entered into descriptive articles of Florence Mission work with such enthusiasm that Crittenton made her reporter of Florence Missions, thus honoring her as a champion of women and widening her field of journalism. In 1895, Edholm was named superintendent of the Crittenton Missions. The horrors of this traffic in girls and their redemption through Florence Missions, Edholm brought out in book form, ''The Traffic in Girls and Florence Crittenton Missions''.<ref name=\"rossiter\" /> She compiled a book of the life of [[Emily Pitt Stevens]], the WCTU Demosthenes and national organizer.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=273}}\n\nIn 1901, Edholm founded the Lucy Charlton Memorial, named after her mother, as a home for unfortunate women and children. For this purpose, she used her own home in Oakland, and she supported the charity from the proceeds of her lectures and the sale of her book. she was the Prohibition nominee for State Superintendent of Public Instruction, California, 1902.{{sfn|Leonard|Marquis|1906|p=439}}\n\n==Personal life==\nFor years, Mrs. Edholm has resided in Oakland, and was active in Rev.

Charlton Edholm''' (October 28, 1854 &ndash; November 29, 1935) was an American reformer and journalist. She worked as a journalist for twenty years. Edholm was appointed World's Superintendent of Press work, at the [[Boston]] Convention of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]] (WCTU) in 1891. Much of her work was along Christian, [[Temperance movement in the United States|temperance]] and philanthropic lines. For many years, her work averaged 250 columns of original matter, in which every phase of the labors of the WCTU was depicted in thousands of papers in the English-speaking world.{{sfn|Chapin|1895|p=15}}\n\nWhile editing the booklet, \"Around the World with Jesus,\" by evangelist [[Charles Nelson Crittenton]], she became interested in the rescue work among [[Sex trafficking|traffic-ed]] girls, and her book entitled ''The Traffic in Girls and Florence Crittenton Missions'' was the result. Edholm became so interested in the plight of these betrayed and enslaved girls that she determined to make [[Social purity movement|social purity]] work her specialty, and continued to speak and write in their behalf. In 1886, Edholm removed to [[Oakland, California]]; by 1893, she was living in [[Chicago]] with her only son.{{sfn|Chapin|1895|p=16}}\n\n==Early life and education==\nMary Grace Charlton was born in [[Freeport, Illinois]], October 28, 1854.{{sfn|Leonard|Marquis|1906|p=439}} Her journalistic gift was the inheritance from her father, James B. Charlton, and her mother, Lucy Gow Charlton, who were both fine writers along reformatory lines, especially the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]], the temperance movement, and [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]].\n\nShe was educated in public schools, and college through her sophomore year.{{sfn|Leonard|Marquis|1906|p=439}} During her sophomore year at [[Monmouth College]], she wrote her exhibition essay on the subject, \"Shall our Women Vote?\" As a test, she sent it for publication to the ''Woman's Journal'' of [[Boston]], and it was published.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=272}}\n\n==Career==\nAfter graduating, she contributed articles on [[women's suffrage]] and [[temperance movement|temperance]] to various periodicals.\n\nShe married Osborn L. Edholm, a journalist, in 1878. During her marriage, she developed still more her love for editorial and reportorial work, and for several years they traveled together extensively, and she thereby gained the knowledge and information which comes alone of travel, During those years, her descriptive articles appeared in the ''[[New York World]]'', the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', ''[[Press-Republican|Republican]]'', and ''[[Chicago Inter Ocean]]''. Both before and after the birth of her children, she wrote continuously.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=273}}\n\nIn 1886, Edholm moved to Oakland, California and was unanimously elected official reporter for the WCTU; in 1891, she was named superintendent of press. Annually, she wrote about 250 columns of original temperance matter for over 200 papers, including the dailies of [[San Francisco]], Oakland, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[New Orleans]], Boston and [[New York City]], as well as the ''Union Signal'' and the ''New York Voice''. She conducted three WCTU excursions across the United States. Her promotion came through [[Frances E. Willard]] and [[Lady Henry Somerset]].{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=273}}\n\nShe served as secretary for the International Federation Women's Press League,<ref name=rossiter/>{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=272}} and was editor of ''The Christian Home'' in Oakland.<ref name=rossiter>{{cite wikisource |title=The Biographical Dictionary of America |page=416 |year=1906 |editor-last=Johnson |editor-first=Rossiter |volume=3}}</ref>\n\nFor years, Edholm was interested in the rescue of [[Sex trafficking in the United States|trafficked]] girls and she wrote hundreds of articles in defense of outraged womanhood, in such papers as the ''[[Woman's Journal]]'',  the ''[[Women's Tribune]]'', and the ''[[Hutchings' Illustrated California Magazine|California Illustrated Magazine]]'', where her articles depicted the horrors of the slave traffic in Chinese women for immoral purposes. In evangelistic meetings in Oakland, she met the millionaire evangelist, Crittenton, the founder of [[National Florence Crittenton Mission|Florence Crittenton Mission]]s for the rescue of trafficked girls, and at once entered into descriptive articles of Florence Mission work with such enthusiasm that Crittenton made her reporter of Florence Missions, thus honoring her as a champion of women and widening her field of journalism. In 1895, Edholm was named superintendent of the Crittenton Missions. The horrors of this traffic in girls and their redemption through Florence Missions, Edholm brought out in book form, ''The Traffic in Girls and Florence Crittenton Missions''.<ref name=\"rossiter\" /> She compiled a book of the life of [[Emily Pitt Stevens]], the WCTU Demosthenes and national organizer.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=273}}\n\nIn 1901, Edholm founded the Lucy Charlton Memorial, named after her mother, as a home for unfortunate women and children. For this purpose, she used her own home in Oakland, and she supported the charity from the proceeds of her lectures and the sale of her book. she was the Prohibition nominee for State Superintendent of Public Instruction, California, 1902.{{sfn|Leonard|Marquis|1906|p=439}}\n\n==Personal life==\nFor years, Mrs. Edholm has resided in Oakland, and was active in Rev.

The plot tells about a mental patient who was committed to a sanitarium for [[sororicide|murdering his teenage sister]] on [[Halloween]] night when he was six years old. Fifteen years later, he escapes and returns to his hometown, where he stalks a female babysitter and her friends, while under pursuit by his psychiatrist.\n\nFilming took place in Southern California in May 1978, before premiering in October, where it grossed $70 million, becoming one of the most profitable independent films. Primarily praised for Carpenter's direction and [[Halloween (soundtrack)|score]], many credit the film as the first in a long line of slasher films inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960) and [[Bob Clark]]'s ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'' (1974). Some critics have suggested that ''Halloween'' may encourage [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadism]] and [[misogyny]] by audiences identifying with its villain. Others have suggested that the film is a social critique of the immorality of youth and teenagers in 1970s America, with many of Myers' victims being sexually promiscuous substance abusers, and the lone [[Final girl|heroine]] is depicted as innocent and pure, hence her survival. Carpenter dismisses such analyses.\n\n''Halloween'' spawned a [[Halloween (franchise)|film franchise]] comprising eleven films which helped construct an extensive backstory for its antagonist [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]], sometimes narratively diverging entirely from previous installments. A [[Halloween (2007 film)|remake]] was released in 2007, which was followed by a [[Halloween II (2009 film)|sequel]] in 2009. An [[Halloween (2018 film)|eleventh installment]], which serves as a direct sequel to the original film that [[retcon]]s all previous sequels, was released in 2018. Additionally, a novelization, a video game and comic book series have been based on the film. In 2006, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1963, on [[Halloween]] night in Haddonfield, Illinois, six year-old [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] inexplicably stabs his older sister Judith to death with a kitchen knife in their home, and is incarcerated at Smith's Grove sanitarium. Fifteen years later, Michael's psychiatrist [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Samuel Loomis]] and his colleague Marion Chambers arrive at the sanitarium to escort Michael to court. Michael escapes by stealing their car and returns to Haddonfield, killing a mechanic for his coveralls, as well as stealing a white mask and knives from a local hardware store.\n\nOn Halloween, when high school student [[Laurie Strode]] drops off a key at the Myers' home so her father can sell it, Michael stalks her throughout the day which she notices, but her friends [[Annie Brackett]] and [[List of Halloween (franchise) characters|Lynda Van der Klok]] dismiss her concerns. Loomis arrives in Haddonfield in search of Michael, and finds Judith's tombstone missing from the local cemetery. He meets with Annie's father, Sheriff Leigh Brackett, and they both investigate Michael's house, where Loomis tells Sheriff Brackett of the danger Michael poses. Sheriff Brackett, while doubtful of Michael's danger, patrols the streets, while Loomis waits at the house, expecting Michael to return.\n\nLater that night, Laurie babysits Tommy Doyle, while Annie babysits Lindsey Wallace just across the street, unaware that Michael has followed them. When Annie's boyfriend, Paul, calls her to come and pick him up, she takes Lindsey over to the Doyle house to spend the night with Laurie and Tommy. Before Annie can leave in her car, Michael, who hid in the back seat, strangles her and slits her throat. Soon after, Lynda and her boyfriend, Bob Simms, arrive at the Wallace house. After having sex, Bob goes downstairs to get a beer for Lynda, where Michael stabs him. Michael then poses as Bob in a ghost costume and confronts Lynda, who teases him to no effect. Annoyed, Lynda calls Laurie, but Michael strangles her with the telephone cord just as Laurie picks up. Meanwhile, Loomis discovers the stolen car and begins searching the streets.\n\nSuspicious, Laurie goes over to the Wallace house, and finds the bodies of Annie, Bob, and Lynda, as well as Judith's headstone. She cowers in a hallway, where Michael suddenly appears and attacks her. Barely escaping, Laurie flees back to the Doyle house; Michael gets in, but she manages to fend him off long enough for Tommy and Lindsey to escape. Loomis sees the two children fleeing the house and goes to investigate, finding Michael and Laurie fighting upstairs. Loomis shoots Michael, causing him to fall off the balcony to an apparent death, but when Loomis goes to check, he finds Michael's body missing, implying he survived. Unsurprised, he stares off into the night while Laurie begins sobbing in terror.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Halloween (franchise) characters|l1=List of ''Halloween'' characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Sam Loomis]]\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as [[Laurie Strode]]\n* [[Nick Castle]] as [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers / The Shape]]\n** [[Tony Moran (actor)|Tony Moran]] as Michael Myers (unmasked)\n** Will Sandin as Michael Myers (age 6)\n* [[P.J.

As also stated in the 2009 documentary ''Clarkworld'' (written and directed by Clark's former production designer Deren Abram after Clark's tragic death in 2007), Carpenter directly asked Clark about  his thoughts on developing the anonymous slasher in '' Black Christmas'': \n{{quote|...I did a film about three years later, started a film with John Carpenter, it was his first film for [[Warner Bros.]] (which picked up 'Black Christmas'), he asked me if I was ever gonna do a sequel and I said no. I was through with horror, I didn't come into the business to do just horror. He said, \"Well what would you do if you did do a sequel?\" I said it would be the next year and the guy would have actually been caught, escape from a mental institution, go back to the house and they would start all over again. And I would call it 'Halloween'. The truth is John didn't copy 'Black Christmas', he wrote a script, directed the script, did the casting. 'Halloween' is his movie and besides, the script came to him already titled anyway. He liked 'Black Christmas' and may have been influenced by it, but in no way did John Carpenter copy the idea. Fifteen other people at that time had thought to do a movie called 'Halloween' but the script came to John with that title on it.\n\n|author = Bob Clark, 2005\n|source = <ref name=\"IconsOfFright\" />}}\n\n===Screenplay===\nIt took approximately 10 days to write the screenplay.{{sfn|Muir|2012|p=13}} Yablans and Akkad ceded most of the creative control to writers Carpenter and Hill (whom Carpenter wanted as producer), but Yablans did offer several suggestions. According to a ''Fangoria'' interview with Hill, \"Yablans wanted the script written like a radio show, with 'boos' every 10 minutes.\"<ref name=\"behind\" /> By Hill's recollection, the script took three weeks to write,{{sfn|Smith|2003|loc=event occurs at 9:30}} and much of the inspiration behind the plot came from [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]] traditions of Halloween such as the festival of [[Samhain]]. Although Samhain is not mentioned in the plot of the first film, Hill asserts that:\n\n{{quote|... the idea was that you couldn't kill evil, and that was how we came about the story.

An abandoned house owned by a church stood in as the Myers house.

According to Curtis, Carpenter created a \"fear meter\" because the film was shot out-of-sequence and she was not sure what her character's level of terror should be in certain scenes. \"Here's about a 7, here's about a 6, and the scene we're going to shoot tonight is about a 9{{sfrac|1|2}}\", remembered Curtis. She had different facial expressions and scream volumes for each level on the meter.<ref name=\"behind\" /> Carpenter's direction for Castle in his role as Myers was minimal.{{sfn|Smith|2003|loc=event occurs at 40:10}} For example, when Castle asked what Myers' motivation was for a particular scene, Carpenter replied that his motivation was to walk from one set marker to another and \"not act.\"{{sfn|Smith|2003|loc=event occurs at 40:15}} By Carpenter's account the only direction he gave Castle was during the murder sequence of Bob, in which he told Castle to tilt his head and examine the corpse as if it \"were a butterfly collection.\"{{sfn|Smith|2003|loc=event occurs at 41:01}}\n\n===Musical score===\n{{main|Halloween (soundtrack)}}\nLacking a symphonic soundtrack, the film's score consists of a piano melody played in a [[Time signature|10/8]] or \"complex 5/4\" [[Meter (music)|time signature]] composed and performed by director Carpenter with Carpenter admitting that the music was inspired by both [[Dario Argento]]'s ''[[Suspiria]]'' (which also influenced the film's slightly surreal color scheme) and [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]''.<ref name=\"theofficialjohncarpenter.com\" />{{sfn|Burnand|Mena|2004|p=59}} It took Carpenter three days to compose the entire score for the film.

Believe me, I'm not. In ''Halloween'', I viewed the characters as simply normal teenagers.\"<ref name=\"scifi1\" /> Some feminist critics, according to historian Nicholas Rogers, \"have seen the slasher movies since ''Halloween'' as debasing women in as decisive a manner as hard-core pornography.\"{{sfn|Rogers|2002|pages=117\u2013118}} Critics such as [[John Kenneth Muir]] state that female characters such as Laurie Strode survive not because of \"any good planning\" or their own resourcefulness, but sheer luck. Although she manages to repel the killer several times, in the end, Strode is rescued in ''Halloween'' and ''Halloween II'' only when Dr. Loomis arrives to shoot Myers.{{sfn|Muir|1998|p=104}}\n\nOther feminist scholars such as [[Carol J. Clover]] argue that despite the violence against women, ''Halloween'' and other slasher films turned women into heroines.{{sfn|Clover|1993|p=46}} In many pre-''Halloween'' horror films, women are depicted as helpless victims and are not safe until they are rescued by a strong masculine hero. Despite the fact that Loomis saves Strode, Clover asserts that ''Halloween'' initiates the role of the \"[[final girl]]\" who ultimately triumphs in the end. Strode fights back against Myers and severely wounds him.{{sfn|Clover|1993|pages=25\u201333}} Had Myers been a normal man, Strode's attacks would have killed him; even Loomis, the male hero of the story, who shoots Michael repeatedly with a revolver, cannot kill him.{{sfn|Clover|1993|p=189}} Aviva Briefel argued that moments such as when Michael's face was temporarily revealed are meant to give pleasure to the male viewer. Briefel further argues that these moments are masochistic in nature and give pleasure to men because they are willingly submitting themselves to the women of the film; they submit themselves temporarily because it will make their return to authority even more powerful.{{sfn|Briefel|2005|pages=17\u201318}} Critics, such as Pat Gill, see ''Halloween'' as a critique of American social values. She remarks that parental figures are almost entirely absent throughout the film, noting that when Laurie is attacked by Michael while babysitting, \"No parents, either of the teenagers or of the children left in their charge, call to check on their children or arrive to keen over them.\"{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=22}}\n\nAnother major theme found in the film is the dangers of premarital sex. Clover believes that killers in slasher films are fueled by a \"psychosexual fury\"{{sfn|Clover|1987|p=194}} and that all the killings are sexual in nature. She reinforces this idea by saying that \"guns have no place in slasher films\" and when examining the film ''[[I Spit on Your Grave]]'' she notes that \"a hands-on killing answers a hands-on rape in a way that a shooting, even a shooting preceded by a humiliation, does not.\"{{sfn|Clover|1987|p=198}} Equating sex with violence is important in ''Halloween'' and the slasher genre according to Pat Gill, who made a note of this in her essay \"The Monstrous Years: Teens, Slasher Films, and the Family\". She remarks that Laurie's friends \"think of their babysitting jobs as opportunities to share drinks and beds with their boyfriends. One by one they are killed ... by Michael Myers an asylum escapee who years ago at the age of six murdered his sister for preferring sex to taking care of him.\"{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=22}}\n\nThe dangers of suburbia is another major theme that runs throughout the film and the slasher genre at large: Pat Gill states that slasher films \"seem to mock white flight to gated communities, in particular the attempts of parents to shield their children from the dangerous influences represented by the city.\"{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=16}} ''Halloween'' and slasher films, generally, represent the underside of suburbia.{{sfn|Gill|2002|pages=15\u201317}} Myers was raised in a suburban household and after he escapes the mental hospital he returns to his hometown to kill again; Myers is a product of the suburban environment.{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=16}}\n\nMichael is thought by some to represent evil in the film. This is based on the common belief that evil never dies, nor does evil show any remorse. This idea is demonstrated in the film when Dr. Loomis discusses Michael's history with the sheriff. Loomis states, \"I spent eight years trying to reach him [Michael Myers], and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply ... evil.\" Loomis also refers to Michael as \"evil\" when he steals his car at the sanitarium.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.popmatters.com/166315-reel-terror-by-david-konow-2495792142.html|title='Reel Terror' Is Quite the Hatchet Job|date=2012-12-19|work=PopMatters|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en}}</ref>\n\nCarpenter himself dismisses the notion that ''Halloween'' is a [[morality play]], regarding it as merely a horror film.{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=102}} According to Carpenter, critics \"completely missed the point there\". He explains, \"The one girl who is the most sexually uptight just keeps stabbing this guy with a long knife. She's the most sexually frustrated. She's the one that's killed him. Not because she's a virgin but because all that sexually repressed energy starts coming out. She uses all those phallic symbols on the guy.\"{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=102}}\n\n===Aesthetic elements===\n[[File:Halloween_opening_scene.jpg|thumb|alt=A man and woman embracing on a couch|Judith Myers and her boyfriend, as viewed from the point-of-view of young Michael Myers; this voyeuristic perspective is a distinguishing feature of the film's opening scene]]\nHistorian Nicholas Rogers notes that film critics contend that Carpenter's direction and camera work made ''Halloween'' a \"resounding success.\"{{sfn|Rogers|2002|p=111}} [[Roger Ebert]] remarks, \"It's easy to create violence on the screen, but it's hard to do it well. Carpenter is uncannily skilled, for example, at the use of foregrounds in his compositions, and everyone who likes thrillers knows that foregrounds are crucial . ... \"<ref name=\"Ebertreview\">{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|author-link=Roger Ebert|title=Halloween|website=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=October 31, 1979|accessdate=September 8, 2018|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/halloween-1979|via=RogerEbert.com}}</ref>\nThe opening title, featuring a [[jack-o'-lantern]] placed against a black backdrop, sets the mood for the entire film. The camera slowly moves toward the jack-o'-lantern's left eye as the main title theme plays. After the camera fully closes in, the jack-o'-lantern's light dims and goes out. Film historian J.P. Telotte says that this scene \"clearly announces that [the film's] primary concern will be with the way in which we see ourselves and others and the consequences that often attend our usual manner of perception.\"{{sfn|Telotte|1992|p=116}} Carpenter's first-person point-of-view compositions were employed with [[steadicam]]; Telotte argues, \"As a result of this shift in perspective from a disembodied, narrative camera to an actual character's eye ... we are forced into a deeper sense of participation in the ensuing action.\"{{sfn|Telotte|1992|pages=116\u2013117}} Along with the 1974 Canadian horror film ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'', ''Halloween'' made use of seeing events through the killer's eyes.{{sfn|Muir|2011|p=315}}\n\nThe first scene of the young Michael's voyeurism is followed by the murder of Judith seen through the eye holes of Michael's clown costume mask. According to scholar Nicholas Rogers, Carpenter's \"frequent use of the unmounted first-person camera to represent the killer's point of view ... invited [viewers] to adopt the murderer's assaultive gaze and to hear his heavy breathing and plodding footsteps as he stalked his prey.\"{{sfn|Rogers|2002|p=111}} Film analysts have noted its delayed or withheld representations of violence, characterized as the \"false startle\" or \"the old tap-on-the-shoulder routine\" in which the stalkers, murderers, or monsters \"lunge into our field of vision or creep up on a person.\"{{sfn|Diffrient|2004|p=61}} Critic Susan Stark described the film's opening sequence in her 1978 review:\n\n{{quote|In a single, wonderfully fluid tracking shot, the camera establishes the quiet character of a suburban street, the sexual hanky-panky going on between a teenage couple in one of the staid-looking homes, the departure of the boyfriend, a hand in the kitchen drawer removing a butcher's knife, the view on the way upstairs from behind the eye-slits of a Halloween mask, the murder of a half-nude young girl seated at her dressing table, the descent downstairs and whammo! The killer stands speechless on the lawn, holding the bloody knife, a small boy in a satin clown suit with a newly-returned parent on each side shrieking in an attempt to find out what the spectacle means.<ref name=\"stark\" />}}\n\n==Legacy==\n''Halloween'' is a widely influential film within the horror genre; it was largely responsible for the popularization of slasher films in the 1980s and helped develop the slasher genre. ''Halloween'' popularized many tropes that have become completely synonymous with the slasher genre. ''Halloween'' helped to popularize the final girl [[Trope (literature)|trope]], the killing off of characters who are substance abusers or sexually promiscuous,{{sfn|Williams|1996|pages=164\u2013165}} and the use of a theme song for the killer. Carpenter also shot many scenes from the perspective of the killer in order to build tension. These elements have become so established that many historians argue that ''Halloween'' is responsible for the new wave of horror that emerged during the 1980s.{{sfn|Clover|1993|p=24}}{{sfn|Conrich|2004|p=92}} Due to its popularity, ''Halloween'' became a blueprint for success that many other horror films, such as ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', followed, and that others like ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' satirized.\n\nThe major themes present in ''Halloween'' also became common in the slasher films it inspired. Film scholar Pat Gill notes that in ''Halloween'', there is a theme of absentee parents{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=22}} but films such as ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' and ''Friday the 13th'' feature the parents becoming directly responsible for the creation of the killer.{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=26}}\n\nThere are slasher films that predated ''Halloween'', such as ''[[Silent Night, Bloody Night]]'' (1972),  ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974) and ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'' (1974) which contained prominent elements of the slasher genre; both involving a group of teenagers being murdered by a stranger as well as having the final girl trope. ''Halloween'', however, is considered by historians as being responsible for the new wave of horror films, because it not only used these tropes but also pioneered many others.{{sfn|Clover|1993|p=24}}{{sfn|Conrich|2004|p=92}} Rockoff notes that it is \"difficult to overestimate the importance of ''Halloween'',\" noting its pioneering use of the final girl character, subjective point-of-view shots, and holiday setting.{{sfn|Rockoff|2011|p=55}} Rockoff considers the film \"the blueprint for all slashers and the model against which all subsequent films are judged.\"{{sfn|Rockoff|2011|p=55}}\n\n==Related works==\n===Novelization and video game===\nA [[mass market paperback]] novelization [[Halloween (novel)|of the same name]], written by Curtis Richards (a pseudonym that was used by author Richard Curtis), was published by Bantam Books in 1979. It was reissued in 1982.<ref>{{cite book|last=Richard|first=Curtis|title=Halloween|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1982|orig-year=1979|location=New York|isbn=978-0-553-26296-4}}</ref> it later went out of print. The novelization adds aspects not featured in the film, such as the origins of the curse of Samhain and Michael Myers' life in Smith's Grove Sanatorium, which contradict its source material. For example, the novel's version of Michael speaks during his time at the sanitarium;<ref>{{cite book|last=Richard|first=Curtis|title=Halloween|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1979|location=New York|isbn=978-0-553-13226-7}}</ref> in the film, Dr. Loomis states, \"He hasn't spoken a word in fifteen years.\"\n\nIn 1983, ''[[Halloween (video game)|Halloween]]'' was adapted as a video game for the [[Atari 2600]] by [[Wizard Video]].{{sfn|Perron|2009|p=5}} None of the main characters in the game were named.

The plot tells about a mental patient who was committed to a sanitarium for [[sororicide|murdering his teenage sister]] on [[Halloween]] night when he was six years old. Fifteen years later, he escapes and returns to his hometown, where he stalks a female babysitter and her friends, while under pursuit by his psychiatrist.\n\nFilming took place in Southern California in May 1978, before premiering in October, where it grossed $70 million, becoming one of the most profitable independent films. Primarily praised for Carpenter's direction and [[Halloween (soundtrack)|score]], many credit the film as the first in a long line of slasher films inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960) and [[Bob Clark]]'s ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'' (1974). Some critics have suggested that ''Halloween'' may encourage [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadism]] and [[misogyny]] by audiences identifying with its villain. Others have suggested that the film is a social critique of the immorality of youth and teenagers in 1970s America, with many of Myers' victims being sexually promiscuous substance abusers, and the lone [[Final girl|heroine]] is depicted as innocent and pure, hence her survival. Carpenter dismisses such analyses.\n\n''Halloween'' spawned a [[Halloween (franchise)|film franchise]] comprising eleven films which helped construct an extensive backstory for its antagonist [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]], sometimes narratively diverging entirely from previous installments. A [[Halloween (2007 film)|remake]] was released in 2007, which was followed by a [[Halloween II (2009 film)|sequel]] in 2009. An [[Halloween (2018 film)|eleventh installment]], which serves as a direct sequel to the original film that [[retcon]]s all previous sequels, was released in 2018. Additionally, a novelization, a video game and comic book series have been based on the film. In 2006, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1963, on [[Halloween]] night in Haddonfield, Illinois, six year-old [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] inexplicably stabs his older sister Judith to death with a kitchen knife in their home, and is incarcerated at Smith's Grove sanitarium. Fifteen years later, Michael's psychiatrist [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Samuel Loomis]] and his colleague Marion Chambers arrive at the sanitarium to escort Michael to court. Michael escapes by stealing their car and returns to Haddonfield, killing a mechanic for his coveralls, as well as stealing a white mask and knives from a local hardware store.\n\nOn Halloween, when high school student [[Laurie Strode]] drops off a key at the Myers' home so her father can sell it, Michael stalks her throughout the day which she notices, but her friends [[Annie Brackett]] and [[List of Halloween (franchise) characters|Lynda Van der Klok]] dismiss her concerns. Loomis arrives in Haddonfield in search of Michael, and finds Judith's tombstone missing from the local cemetery. He meets with Annie's father, Sheriff Leigh Brackett, and they both investigate Michael's house, where Loomis tells Sheriff Brackett of the danger Michael poses. Sheriff Brackett, while doubtful of Michael's danger, patrols the streets, while Loomis waits at the house, expecting Michael to return.\n\nLater that night, Laurie babysits Tommy Doyle, while Annie babysits Lindsey Wallace just across the street, unaware that Michael has followed them. When Annie's boyfriend, Paul, calls her to come and pick him up, she takes Lindsey over to the Doyle house to spend the night with Laurie and Tommy. Before Annie can leave in her car, Michael, who hid in the back seat, strangles her and slits her throat. Soon after, Lynda and her boyfriend, Bob Simms, arrive at the Wallace house. After having sex, Bob goes downstairs to get a beer for Lynda, where Michael stabs him. Michael then poses as Bob in a ghost costume and confronts Lynda, who teases him to no effect. Annoyed, Lynda calls Laurie, but Michael strangles her with the telephone cord just as Laurie picks up. Meanwhile, Loomis discovers the stolen car and begins searching the streets.\n\nSuspicious, Laurie goes over to the Wallace house, and finds the bodies of Annie, Bob, and Lynda, as well as Judith's headstone. She cowers in a hallway, where Michael suddenly appears and attacks her. Barely escaping, Laurie flees back to the Doyle house; Michael gets in, but she manages to fend him off long enough for Tommy and Lindsey to escape. Loomis sees the two children fleeing the house and goes to investigate, finding Michael and Laurie fighting upstairs. Loomis shoots Michael, causing him to fall off the balcony to an apparent death, but when Loomis goes to check, he finds Michael's body missing, implying he survived. Unsurprised, he stares off into the night while Laurie begins sobbing in terror.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Halloween (franchise) characters|l1=List of ''Halloween'' characters}}\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Donald Pleasence]] as [[Samuel Loomis|Dr. Sam Loomis]]\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as [[Laurie Strode]]\n* [[Nick Castle]] as [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers / The Shape]]\n** [[Tony Moran (actor)|Tony Moran]] as Michael Myers (unmasked)\n** Will Sandin as Michael Myers (age 6)\n* [[P.J.

As also stated in the 2009 documentary ''Clarkworld'' (written and directed by Clark's former production designer Deren Abram after Clark's tragic death in 2007), Carpenter directly asked Clark about  his thoughts on developing the anonymous slasher in '' Black Christmas'': \n{{quote|...I did a film about three years later, started a film with John Carpenter, it was his first film for [[Warner Bros.]] (which picked up 'Black Christmas'), he asked me if I was ever gonna do a sequel and I said no. I was through with horror, I didn't come into the business to do just horror. He said, \"Well what would you do if you did do a sequel?\" I said it would be the next year and the guy would have actually been caught, escape from a mental institution, go back to the house and they would start all over again.

Believe me, I'm not. In ''Halloween'', I viewed the characters as simply normal teenagers.\"<ref name=\"scifi1\" /> Some feminist critics, according to historian Nicholas Rogers, \"have seen the slasher movies since ''Halloween'' as debasing women in as decisive a manner as hard-core pornography.\"{{sfn|Rogers|2002|pages=117\u2013118}} Critics such as [[John Kenneth Muir]] state that female characters such as Laurie Strode survive not because of \"any good planning\" or their own resourcefulness, but sheer luck. Although she manages to repel the killer several times, in the end, Strode is rescued in ''Halloween'' and ''Halloween II'' only when Dr. Loomis arrives to shoot Myers.{{sfn|Muir|1998|p=104}}\n\nOther feminist scholars such as [[Carol J. Clover]] argue that despite the violence against women, ''Halloween'' and other slasher films turned women into heroines.{{sfn|Clover|1993|p=46}} In many pre-''Halloween'' horror films, women are depicted as helpless victims and are not safe until they are rescued by a strong masculine hero. Despite the fact that Loomis saves Strode, Clover asserts that ''Halloween'' initiates the role of the \"[[final girl]]\" who ultimately triumphs in the end. Strode fights back against Myers and severely wounds him.{{sfn|Clover|1993|pages=25\u201333}} Had Myers been a normal man, Strode's attacks would have killed him; even Loomis, the male hero of the story, who shoots Michael repeatedly with a revolver, cannot kill him.{{sfn|Clover|1993|p=189}} Aviva Briefel argued that moments such as when Michael's face was temporarily revealed are meant to give pleasure to the male viewer. Briefel further argues that these moments are masochistic in nature and give pleasure to men because they are willingly submitting themselves to the women of the film; they submit themselves temporarily because it will make their return to authority even more powerful.{{sfn|Briefel|2005|pages=17\u201318}} Critics, such as Pat Gill, see ''Halloween'' as a critique of American social values. She remarks that parental figures are almost entirely absent throughout the film, noting that when Laurie is attacked by Michael while babysitting, \"No parents, either of the teenagers or of the children left in their charge, call to check on their children or arrive to keen over them.\"{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=22}}\n\nAnother major theme found in the film is the dangers of premarital sex. Clover believes that killers in slasher films are fueled by a \"psychosexual fury\"{{sfn|Clover|1987|p=194}} and that all the killings are sexual in nature. She reinforces this idea by saying that \"guns have no place in slasher films\" and when examining the film ''[[I Spit on Your Grave]]'' she notes that \"a hands-on killing answers a hands-on rape in a way that a shooting, even a shooting preceded by a humiliation, does not.\"{{sfn|Clover|1987|p=198}} Equating sex with violence is important in ''Halloween'' and the slasher genre according to Pat Gill, who made a note of this in her essay \"The Monstrous Years: Teens, Slasher Films, and the Family\". She remarks that Laurie's friends \"think of their babysitting jobs as opportunities to share drinks and beds with their boyfriends. One by one they are killed ... by Michael Myers an asylum escapee who years ago at the age of six murdered his sister for preferring sex to taking care of him.\"{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=22}}\n\nThe dangers of suburbia is another major theme that runs throughout the film and the slasher genre at large: Pat Gill states that slasher films \"seem to mock white flight to gated communities, in particular the attempts of parents to shield their children from the dangerous influences represented by the city.\"{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=16}} ''Halloween'' and slasher films, generally, represent the underside of suburbia.{{sfn|Gill|2002|pages=15\u201317}} Myers was raised in a suburban household and after he escapes the mental hospital he returns to his hometown to kill again; Myers is a product of the suburban environment.{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=16}}\n\nMichael is thought by some to represent evil in the film. This is based on the common belief that evil never dies, nor does evil show any remorse. This idea is demonstrated in the film when Dr. Loomis discusses Michael's history with the sheriff. Loomis states, \"I spent eight years trying to reach him [Michael Myers], and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply ... evil.\" Loomis also refers to Michael as \"evil\" when he steals his car at the sanitarium.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.popmatters.com/166315-reel-terror-by-david-konow-2495792142.html|title='Reel Terror' Is Quite the Hatchet Job|date=2012-12-19|work=PopMatters|access-date=2018-10-05|language=en}}</ref>\n\nCarpenter himself dismisses the notion that ''Halloween'' is a [[morality play]], regarding it as merely a horror film.{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=102}} According to Carpenter, critics \"completely missed the point there\". He explains, \"The one girl who is the most sexually uptight just keeps stabbing this guy with a long knife. She's the most sexually frustrated. She's the one that's killed him. Not because she's a virgin but because all that sexually repressed energy starts coming out. She uses all those phallic symbols on the guy.\"{{sfn|Jones|2005|p=102}}\n\n===Aesthetic elements===\n[[File:Halloween_opening_scene.jpg|thumb|alt=A man and woman embracing on a couch|Judith Myers and her boyfriend, as viewed from the point-of-view of young Michael Myers; this voyeuristic perspective is a distinguishing feature of the film's opening scene]]\nHistorian Nicholas Rogers notes that film critics contend that Carpenter's direction and camera work made ''Halloween'' a \"resounding success.\"{{sfn|Rogers|2002|p=111}} [[Roger Ebert]] remarks, \"It's easy to create violence on the screen, but it's hard to do it well.

The camera slowly moves toward the jack-o'-lantern's left eye as the main title theme plays. After the camera fully closes in, the jack-o'-lantern's light dims and goes out. Film historian J.P. Telotte says that this scene \"clearly announces that [the film's] primary concern will be with the way in which we see ourselves and others and the consequences that often attend our usual manner of perception.\"{{sfn|Telotte|1992|p=116}} Carpenter's first-person point-of-view compositions were employed with [[steadicam]]; Telotte argues, \"As a result of this shift in perspective from a disembodied, narrative camera to an actual character's eye ... we are forced into a deeper sense of participation in the ensuing action.\"{{sfn|Telotte|1992|pages=116\u2013117}} Along with the 1974 Canadian horror film ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'', ''Halloween'' made use of seeing events through the killer's eyes.{{sfn|Muir|2011|p=315}}\n\nThe first scene of the young Michael's voyeurism is followed by the murder of Judith seen through the eye holes of Michael's clown costume mask. According to scholar Nicholas Rogers, Carpenter's \"frequent use of the unmounted first-person camera to represent the killer's point of view ... invited [viewers] to adopt the murderer's assaultive gaze and to hear his heavy breathing and plodding footsteps as he stalked his prey.\"{{sfn|Rogers|2002|p=111}} Film analysts have noted its delayed or withheld representations of violence, characterized as the \"false startle\" or \"the old tap-on-the-shoulder routine\" in which the stalkers, murderers, or monsters \"lunge into our field of vision or creep up on a person.\"{{sfn|Diffrient|2004|p=61}} Critic Susan Stark described the film's opening sequence in her 1978 review:\n\n{{quote|In a single, wonderfully fluid tracking shot, the camera establishes the quiet character of a suburban street, the sexual hanky-panky going on between a teenage couple in one of the staid-looking homes, the departure of the boyfriend, a hand in the kitchen drawer removing a butcher's knife, the view on the way upstairs from behind the eye-slits of a Halloween mask, the murder of a half-nude young girl seated at her dressing table, the descent downstairs and whammo! The killer stands speechless on the lawn, holding the bloody knife, a small boy in a satin clown suit with a newly-returned parent on each side shrieking in an attempt to find out what the spectacle means.<ref name=\"stark\" />}}\n\n==Legacy==\n''Halloween'' is a widely influential film within the horror genre; it was largely responsible for the popularization of slasher films in the 1980s and helped develop the slasher genre. ''Halloween'' popularized many tropes that have become completely synonymous with the slasher genre. ''Halloween'' helped to popularize the final girl [[Trope (literature)|trope]], the killing off of characters who are substance abusers or sexually promiscuous,{{sfn|Williams|1996|pages=164\u2013165}} and the use of a theme song for the killer. Carpenter also shot many scenes from the perspective of the killer in order to build tension. These elements have become so established that many historians argue that ''Halloween'' is responsible for the new wave of horror that emerged during the 1980s.{{sfn|Clover|1993|p=24}}{{sfn|Conrich|2004|p=92}} Due to its popularity, ''Halloween'' became a blueprint for success that many other horror films, such as ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'' and ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', followed, and that others like ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' satirized.\n\nThe major themes present in ''Halloween'' also became common in the slasher films it inspired. Film scholar Pat Gill notes that in ''Halloween'', there is a theme of absentee parents{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=22}} but films such as ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' and ''Friday the 13th'' feature the parents becoming directly responsible for the creation of the killer.{{sfn|Gill|2002|p=26}}\n\nThere are slasher films that predated ''Halloween'', such as ''[[Silent Night, Bloody Night]]'' (1972),  ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' (1974) and ''[[Black Christmas (1974 film)|Black Christmas]]'' (1974) which contained prominent elements of the slasher genre; both involving a group of teenagers being murdered by a stranger as well as having the final girl trope. ''Halloween'', however, is considered by historians as being responsible for the new wave of horror films, because it not only used these tropes but also pioneered many others.{{sfn|Clover|1993|p=24}}{{sfn|Conrich|2004|p=92}} Rockoff notes that it is \"difficult to overestimate the importance of ''Halloween'',\" noting its pioneering use of the final girl character, subjective point-of-view shots, and holiday setting.{{sfn|Rockoff|2011|p=55}} Rockoff considers the film \"the blueprint for all slashers and the model against which all subsequent films are judged.\"{{sfn|Rockoff|2011|p=55}}\n\n==Related works==\n===Novelization and video game===\nA [[mass market paperback]] novelization [[Halloween (novel)|of the same name]], written by Curtis Richards (a pseudonym that was used by author Richard Curtis), was published by Bantam Books in 1979.

The novelization adds aspects not featured in the film, such as the origins of the curse of Samhain and Michael Myers' life in Smith's Grove Sanatorium, which contradict its source material. For example, the novel's version of Michael speaks during his time at the sanitarium;<ref>{{cite book|last=Richard|first=Curtis|title=Halloween|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1979|location=New York|isbn=978-0-553-13226-7}}</ref> in the film, Dr. Loomis states, \"He hasn't spoken a word in fifteen years.\"\n\nIn 1983, ''[[Halloween (video game)|Halloween]]'' was adapted as a video game for the [[Atari 2600]] by [[Wizard Video]].{{sfn|Perron|2009|p=5}} None of the main characters in the game were named.
