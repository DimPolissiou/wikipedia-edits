The series has raced at least once annually at the track since 1990.\n\n==History==\n\nARCA ran its first race at Michigan International Speedway in 1980, when two races were held. The series would not return for nearly a decade, when it was added back to the calendar in 1990, where it has remained ever since. The race has been run between June and August since its inception, with every race falling in June each year since 1991. An [[Michigan ARCA 200#Former second race|additional second race]] was conducted at the speedway on seven occasions: 1980, 1991, 1996-1997, 2001, and 2005-2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racing-reference.info/tracks/Michigan_International_Speedway|title=Michigan International Speedway|work=Racing-reference.info|publisher=[[NASCAR]]|accessdate=March 31, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Past winners==\n{{Expand list|date=March 2020}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Date\n! rowspan=\"2\"|{{Tooltip|No.|Car number}}\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Driver\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Team\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Manufacturer\n! colspan=\"2\"|Race Distance\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Race Time\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Average Speed<br />(mph)\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Report\n|-\n!

The series would not return for nearly a decade, when it was added back to the calendar in 1990, where it has remained ever since. The race has been run between June and August since its inception, with every race falling in June each year since 1991.

His chief legal commentary on the [[Talmud]], referred to as ''The Mordechai'', is one of the sources of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''. He was killed in the [[Rintfleisch massacres]] in 1298.\n\n==Biography==\nLittle is known of Mordechai's early life. He belonged to one of the most prominent families of scholars in Germany: his grandfather Hillel, on his mother's side, was a grandson of [[Eliezer ben Joel ha-Levi]], who was in turn a grandson of [[Eliezer ben Nathan]]. Mordechai was also a relative of Rabbi [[Asher ben Jehiel]].  He was married to Zelda, with whom he had five children.\n\nHis principal teacher was [[Meir of Rothenburg|Meir ben Baruch of Rothenburg]]; he was also taught by [[Perez ben Elijah]] of [[Corbeil-Essonnes|Corbeil]], Ephraim ben Nathan,<!--Historical impossibility: [[Yaakov ben Moshe Levi Moelin]] (Jacob ben Moses ha-Levi),--> Abraham ben Baruch (Meir of Rothenburg's brother), and [[Dan Ashkenazi]]. In addition to his knowledge of Talmud and Halakha, the Mordechai was also an expert on [[Hebrew grammar]].\n\nAbout 1291 the family moved to [[Goslar]]. But his right of residence there was disputed by a certain Moses Tako (not the famous [[Moses Taku]]); although the suit was decided in Mordechai's favor, it was conducted with such bitterness that Mordechai left Goslar and settled at [[Nuremberg]]. For the next seven years, he operated a [[Yeshiva]] there which attracted students from all over Europe. The Mordechai was murdered, along with his wife and children, in the [[Rintfleisch-Pogrom|Rintfleisch Massacres]]; ''see [[Nuremberg#Middle Ages|Nuremberg: Middle Ages]]''.\n\n==Works==\n\n===Magnum opus===\n\n'''''Mordechai''''' is a prominent legal (Halachic) work, which acquired wide authority, and was one of the sources of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' of [[Joseph Caro]]; it has also been printed as an appendix to the [[Talmud]], since the [[Soncino family (printers)|Soncino]] edition of 1482. The work is written as a compilation of existing halakhic material, and also provides conclusions and results of long discussions in [[Halakha#Codes of Jewish law|other works]]. It thus serves both a source of analysis, as well a source of [[posek|decided law]]. Mordechai's knowledge of halakhic literature was extensive. He quotes the works, and written or verbal [[responsa]], of about 350 [[posek|authorities]]; in fact, ''Mordechai'' is now the only source for many [[Ashkenazi]] authors. He frequently quotes his teacher, Meir ben Baruch, and much of the ''Mordechai'' is written in support of the [[Tosafist]]s, the last of whom were Mordechai's teachers.\n\nThe [[Ashkenazi]] authorities, as well as [[Italian Jews|those in Italy]], were great admirers of Mordechai, and assiduously studied the ''Mordechai'' and recognized its authority as a source of Halakha. [[Moses Isserles]] lectured on the ''Mordechai'' in his yeshivah, and many of his [[responsa]] are devoted to questions regarding difficult passages of the book. Its status was such, that the ''Mordechai'' is one of the sources of the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' of [[Joseph Caro]]. In Italy and Poland, where the ''Mordechai'' was especially studied, a whole ''Mordechai'' literature came into existence.\n\nThe ''Mordechai'', although linked textually with the ''Halakhot'' of Rabbi [[Isaac Alfasi]], is, in fact, an independent work. The connection with Alfasi is an external one: single sentences, sometimes even single words, of the ''Halakhot'' serve as \"catchwords\" introducing the relevant material found in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], the [[tosafot]], as well as other codices and compendiums. The ''Mordechai'' is published in two forms: glosses to [[Isaac Alfasi|Alfasi's]] \"Halakhot\" in various manuscripts, and also as an appendix to the \"Halakhot\" - the standard form in today's editions of the [[Talmud]].\n\nThe work has a \"most peculiar history\". As the early critics pointed out, the ''Mordechai'' was not issued in its final form by the author. He collected the material, but the work was in fact arranged and published by his pupils, partly during his lifetime and partly after his death. Thus within two generations after Mordechai's death there were two entirely different versions of his work, respectively designated as the \"Rhenish\" and the \"Austrian\" versions. The Rhenish is the shorter one of the two, and they are also known as the \"Short Mordechai\" (\u05de\u05e8\u05d3\u05db\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e7\u05e6\u05e8 ''Mordekhai haKetzar'')\nand \"Long Mordechai\" (\u05de\u05e8\u05d3\u05db\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d0\u05e8\u05d5\u05da ''Mordekhai ha'Arokh''). These were not merely two different copies of the ''Mordechai'', but are in fact two materially different compendiums. It is thought that the Austrian ''Mordechai'', as found in the manuscripts, is the original form of the work. The version published in the Talmud is the Rhenish with [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] from the Austrian Mordechai, by Rabbi Samuel ben Aaron of Schlettstallt.\n\n===Other works===\n\n*Mordechai was the author of [[Responsa]] - however, these have not been preserved but are quoted in other works and responsa; see: [[History of Responsa#Twelfth century|History of Responsa: Twelfth century]].\n*He authored several [[selichot]].\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=772&letter=M Mordechai b.

The title track of Bowie's [[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|third album]], it was released in November 1970 in the US and in April 1971 in the UK. The song has been covered by a number of other artists, notably by [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], who had a UK No. 3 hit with her version in 1974; by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], whose 1993 performance of the song for the television program ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' introduced it to a new audience; and by [[Midge Ure]], whose 1982 cover of the song was featured in the 2015 video game ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'' because the game itself features the song's main theme of doppelg\u00e4ngers.\n\nThe song was reworked by Bowie, featuring atmospheric synths, a new bassline, techno-style drums and a notably darker mood, for performances in concerts from 1995 to 1997, including the [[1995 MTV Europe Music Awards]]. Bowie later returned to playing the original version in the 2000s.\n\n==Inspiration and explanation==\nThe person in the song has an encounter with a kind of [[doppelg\u00e4nger]], as suggested in the second chorus where \"I never lost control\" is replaced with \"We never lost control\".<ref>{{Cite book| contribution = Future Legends: David Bowie and Science Fiction| last = King| first = Maureen| editor-last = Morrison| editor-first = Michael A.| title = Trajectories of the Fantastic: Selected Essays from the Fourteenth International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts| publisher = Greenwood| year = 1997| location = Westport, CT| page = 131 }}</ref> Beyond this, the episode is unexplained: as James E. Perone wrote,\n\n{{quote|Bowie encounters the title character, but it is not clear just what the phrase means, or exactly who this man is.&nbsp;...

P. Lovecraft]].{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=38}} The lyrics are also cited as reflecting Bowie's concerns with splintered or multiple personalities, and are believed to have been partially inspired by the poem \"[[Antigonish (poem)|Antigonish]]\" by [[William Hughes Mearns]]:{{sfn|Buckley|1999|p=100}}<ref name=\"Thompson AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Dave |title=\"The Man Who Sold the World\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/the-man-who-sold-the-world-mt0052219335 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{poemquote|Last night I saw upon the stair\nA little man who wasn't there\nHe wasn't there again today\nOh, how I wish he'd go away...}}\n\nIn the [[BBC Radio 1]] special programme \"ChangesNowBowie\", broadcast on 8 January 1997, Bowie was interviewed by Mary Anne Hobbs and was asked about the song. He commented: \"I guess I wrote it because there was a part of myself that I was looking for. Maybe now that I feel more comfortable with the way that I live my life and my mental state (laughs) and my spiritual state whatever, maybe I feel there's some kind of unity now. That song for me always exemplified kind of how you feel when you're young, when you know that there's a piece of yourself that you haven't really put together yet. You have this great searching, this great need to find out who you really are.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teenagewildlife.com/Appearances/Radio/1997/0108/radio1-transcript.html |title=ChangesNowBowie Transcript \u2013 Radio 1 |first=Grant |last=Wallace |date=27 June 1999 |accessdate=19 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902074027/http://www.teenagewildlife.com/Appearances/Radio/1997/0108/radio1-transcript.html |archive-date=2 September 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Other releases by Bowie==\n*\"The Man Who Sold the World\" appeared as the B-side on the American single release of the song  \"[[Space Oddity]]\" (1973 rerelease) and British single \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" (1973). It also appears on various Bowie compilations such as ''[[Sound + Vision (box set)|Sound + Vision]]'' (1989), ''[[The Best of David Bowie 1969/1974]]'' (1997), ''[[Best of Bowie]]'' (2002), ''[[The Platinum Collection (David Bowie album)|The Platinum Collection]]'' (2006), ''[[Nothing Has Changed]]'' (2014), and ''[[Bowie Legacy]]'' (2016).\n*On 15 December 1979, Bowie recorded the song for a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' broadcast, with [[Klaus Nomi]] and [[Joey Arias]]. A portion of this show is included in the film ''[[The Nomi Song]]'', and the full performance was included in the touring exhibit ''[[David Bowie Is]]''.\n*A new [[drum n' bass]] studio version of the song was recorded by Bowie and mixed by [[Brian Eno]] and  appears as a B-side on the CD single \"[[Strangers When We Meet (David Bowie song)|Strangers When We Meet]]\" (1995). This version also appears on the bonus disc that followed some versions of ''[[Outside (David Bowie album)|Outside]] \u2013 Version 3''. It was this arrangement that appeared in Bowie's 2016 stage musical, ''[[Lazarus (musical)|Lazarus]]''.\n* Bowie's 25 June 2000 performance of the song at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] was released on ''[[Glastonbury 2000]]'' (2018).\n*A live version recorded at BBC Radio Theatre, London, on 27 June 2000 was released on the bonus disc accompanying the first releases of ''[[Bowie at the Beeb]]'' (2000).\n* A November 2003 live performance from the [[A Reality Tour|Reality Tour]] is featured on the concert film ''[[A Reality Tour (film)|A Reality Tour]]'' (2004), as well as the live album ''[[A Reality Tour (album)|A Reality Tour]]'' (2010).\n* A remastered version of the song appears in the box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' (2015).\n* A previously unreleased acoustic version was released on what would have been Bowie's 73rd birthday (2020).\n\n==Personnel==\nAccording to Kevin Cann:{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=210}}\n*[[David Bowie]] \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar\n*[[Mick Ronson]] \u2013 electric guitar\n*[[Tony Visconti]] \u2013 bass guitar\n*[[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]] \u2013 drums, [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]\n*Ralph Mace \u2013 [[Moog synthesiser]]\n\n==Lulu version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = The Man Who Sold the World\n| cover      = File:Themanwhosoldtheworld.png\n| caption    = A-side label of the UK single\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]]\n| album      =\n| B-side     = [[Watch That Man]]\n| released   = {{Start date|df=yes|1974|01|11}}\n| format     = [[7-inch single]]\n| recorded   = July 1973\n| studio     = [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]], [[H\u00e9rouville]], France\n| genre      =\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Polydor]]\n| writer     = [[David Bowie]]\n| producer   = \n*David Bowie\n*[[Mick Ronson]]\n| prev_title = Make Believe World\n| prev_year  = 1972\n| next_title = The Man with the Golden Gun\n| next_year  = 1974\n}}\n\nThe song was covered by the Scottish singer [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] in 1974, who, according to biographer David Buckley, performed it in \"a sleazy, almost [[Cabaret#German-speaking cabaret|Berlin cabaret]] style\".{{sfn|Buckley|1999|p=196}} Lulu would recall Bowie inviting her to a concert he gave after which he met her in his hotel room saying: \"I want to make an [[motherfucker|MF]] of a record with you [because] you're a great singer.\" Lulu \u2013 \"I didn't think it would happen but [Bowie] followed up two days later. He was \u00fcbercool at the time and I just wanted to be led by him. I loved everything he did. I didn't think 'The Man Who Sold the World' was the greatest song for my voice, but it was such a strong song in itself. I had no idea what it was about. In the studio Bowie kept telling me to smoke more cigarettes, to give my voice a certain quality.\"{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=228}} Bowie produced the Lulu recording of \"The Man Who Sold the World\" with [[Mick Ronson]] during the July 1973 ''[[Pin Ups]]'' sessions and also contributed guitar, [[saxophone]] and backing vocals. The remainder of the band included Ronson on guitar, [[Trevor Bolder]] on bass, [[Mike Garson]] on piano, and [[Aynsley Dunbar]] on drums.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=118}}\n\nLulu's \"The Man Who Sold the World\" was released as a [[music single|single]] on 11 January 1974 having been introduced by Lulu on the ''[[Top of the Pops|TOTP]]'' broadcast of 10 January 1974: the track only made its Top 50 debut (at #27) on the chart dated 26 January 1974 following a reprise performance by Lulu on ''TOTP'' two days earlier on 24 January 1974, with a third ''TOTP'' performance by Lulu on 7 February 1974 broadcast facilitating a boost from No. 13 to No. 5 on the chart dated 9 February 1974. In her ''TOTP'' performances in support of \"The Man Who Sold the World\" Lulu has been characterized as \"dressed and sounding exactly like a diminutive Bowie\".<ref name=\"Who Was That Man: a present for Mr Oscar Wilde\">{{cite book\n| first=Neil\n| last=Bartlett\n| year=1988\n| title=Who Was That Man: a present for Mr Oscar Wilde\n| publisher=Serpent's Tail\n| location=London\n| pages=[https://archive.org/details/whowasthatmanpre00bart/page/244 244]\n| isbn=978-1-85242-123-6\n| url=https://archive.org/details/whowasthatmanpre00bart/page/244\n}}</ref>\n\n===Chart positions===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Chart (1974)\n!Position\n|-\n|Belgian Singles Chart ''([[Ultratop]])''<ref name=\"LuluChart\">[http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Lulu&titel=The+Man+Who+Sold+The+World&cat=s Lulu \u2013 The Man Who Sold the World \u2013 peak chart positions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110085413/http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Lulu&titel=The+Man+Who+Sold+The+World&cat=s |date=10 November 2013 }} dutchcharts.com.

The title track of Bowie's [[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|third album]], it was released in November 1970 in the US and in April 1971 in the UK. The song has been covered by a number of other artists, notably by [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], who had a UK No. 3 hit with her version in 1974; by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], whose 1993 performance of the song for the television program ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' introduced it to a new audience; and by [[Midge Ure]], whose 1982 cover of the song was featured in the 2015 video game ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'' because the game itself features the song's main theme of doppelg\u00e4ngers.\n\nThe song was reworked by Bowie, featuring atmospheric synths, a new bassline, techno-style drums and a notably darker mood, for performances in concerts from 1995 to 1997, including the [[1995 MTV Europe Music Awards]]. Bowie later returned to playing the original version in the 2000s.\n\n==Inspiration and explanation==\nThe person in the song has an encounter with a kind of [[doppelg\u00e4nger]], as suggested in the second chorus where \"I never lost control\" is replaced with \"We never lost control\".<ref>{{Cite book| contribution = Future Legends: David Bowie and Science Fiction| last = King| first = Maureen| editor-last = Morrison| editor-first = Michael A.| title = Trajectories of the Fantastic: Selected Essays from the Fourteenth International Conference on the Fantastic in the Arts| publisher = Greenwood| year = 1997| location = Westport, CT| page = 131 }}</ref> Beyond this, the episode is unexplained: as James E. Perone wrote,\n\n{{quote|Bowie encounters the title character, but it is not clear just what the phrase means, or exactly who this man is.&nbsp;... The main thing that the song does is to paint \u2013 however elusively \u2013 the title character as another example of the societal outcasts who populate the album.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Perone| first = James E.| title = The Words and Music of David Bowie| publisher = Praeger| year = 2007| location = Westport, Connecticut| pages = 15\u201316}}</ref>}}\n\nIn common with a number of tracks on the album, the song's themes have been compared to the [[Horror fiction|horror]]-[[fantasy]] works of [[H. P. Lovecraft]].{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=38}} The lyrics are also cited as reflecting Bowie's concerns with splintered or multiple personalities, and are believed to have been partially inspired by the poem \"[[Antigonish (poem)|Antigonish]]\" by [[William Hughes Mearns]]:{{sfn|Buckley|1999|p=100}}<ref name=\"Thompson AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Dave |title=\"The Man Who Sold the World\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/the-man-who-sold-the-world-mt0052219335 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{poemquote|Last night I saw upon the stair\nA little man who wasn't there\nHe wasn't there again today\nOh, how I wish he'd go away...}}\n\nIn the [[BBC Radio 1]] special programme \"ChangesNowBowie\", broadcast on 8 January 1997, Bowie was interviewed by Mary Anne Hobbs and was asked about the song. He commented: \"I guess I wrote it because there was a part of myself that I was looking for. Maybe now that I feel more comfortable with the way that I live my life and my mental state (laughs) and my spiritual state whatever, maybe I feel there's some kind of unity now. That song for me always exemplified kind of how you feel when you're young, when you know that there's a piece of yourself that you haven't really put together yet. You have this great searching, this great need to find out who you really are.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.teenagewildlife.com/Appearances/Radio/1997/0108/radio1-transcript.html |title=ChangesNowBowie Transcript \u2013 Radio 1 |first=Grant |last=Wallace |date=27 June 1999 |accessdate=19 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902074027/http://www.teenagewildlife.com/Appearances/Radio/1997/0108/radio1-transcript.html |archive-date=2 September 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Other releases by Bowie==\n*\"The Man Who Sold the World\" appeared as the B-side on the American single release of the song  \"[[Space Oddity]]\" (1973 rerelease) and British single \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" (1973). It also appears on various Bowie compilations such as ''[[Sound + Vision (box set)|Sound + Vision]]'' (1989), ''[[The Best of David Bowie 1969/1974]]'' (1997), ''[[Best of Bowie]]'' (2002), ''[[The Platinum Collection (David Bowie album)|The Platinum Collection]]'' (2006), ''[[Nothing Has Changed]]'' (2014), and ''[[Bowie Legacy]]'' (2016).\n*On 15 December 1979, Bowie recorded the song for a ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' broadcast, with [[Klaus Nomi]] and [[Joey Arias]]. A portion of this show is included in the film ''[[The Nomi Song]]'', and the full performance was included in the touring exhibit ''[[David Bowie Is]]''.\n*A new [[drum n' bass]] studio version of the song was recorded by Bowie and mixed by [[Brian Eno]] and  appears as a B-side on the CD single \"[[Strangers When We Meet (David Bowie song)|Strangers When We Meet]]\" (1995). This version also appears on the bonus disc that followed some versions of ''[[Outside (David Bowie album)|Outside]] \u2013 Version 3''. It was this arrangement that appeared in Bowie's 2016 stage musical, ''[[Lazarus (musical)|Lazarus]]''.\n* Bowie's 25 June 2000 performance of the song at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] was released on ''[[Glastonbury 2000]]'' (2018).\n*A live version recorded at BBC Radio Theatre, London, on 27 June 2000 was released on the bonus disc accompanying the first releases of ''[[Bowie at the Beeb]]'' (2000).\n* A November 2003 live performance from the [[A Reality Tour|Reality Tour]] is featured on the concert film ''[[A Reality Tour (film)|A Reality Tour]]'' (2004), as well as the live album ''[[A Reality Tour (album)|A Reality Tour]]'' (2010).\n* A remastered version of the song appears in the box set ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' (2015).\n* A previously unreleased acoustic version was released on what would have been Bowie's 73rd birthday (2020).\n\n==Personnel==\nAccording to Kevin Cann:{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=210}}\n*[[David Bowie]] \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar\n*[[Mick Ronson]] \u2013 electric guitar\n*[[Tony Visconti]] \u2013 bass guitar\n*[[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]] \u2013 drums, [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]\n*Ralph Mace \u2013 [[Moog synthesiser]]\n\n==Lulu version==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = The Man Who Sold the World\n| cover      = File:Themanwhosoldtheworld.png\n| caption    = A-side label of the UK single\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]]\n| album      =\n| B-side     = [[Watch That Man]]\n| released   = {{Start date|df=yes|1974|01|11}}\n| format     = [[7-inch single]]\n| recorded   = July 1973\n| studio     = [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]], [[H\u00e9rouville]], France\n| genre      =\n| length     =\n| label      = [[Polydor]]\n| writer     = [[David Bowie]]\n| producer   = \n*David Bowie\n*[[Mick Ronson]]\n| prev_title = Make Believe World\n| prev_year  = 1972\n| next_title = The Man with the Golden Gun\n| next_year  = 1974\n}}\n\nThe song was covered by the Scottish singer [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] in 1974, who, according to biographer David Buckley, performed it in \"a sleazy, almost [[Cabaret#German-speaking cabaret|Berlin cabaret]] style\".{{sfn|Buckley|1999|p=196}} Lulu would recall Bowie inviting her to a concert he gave after which he met her in his hotel room saying: \"I want to make an [[motherfucker|MF]] of a record with you [because] you're a great singer.\" Lulu \u2013 \"I didn't think it would happen but [Bowie] followed up two days later. He was \u00fcbercool at the time and I just wanted to be led by him. I loved everything he did. I didn't think 'The Man Who Sold the World' was the greatest song for my voice, but it was such a strong song in itself. I had no idea what it was about. In the studio Bowie kept telling me to smoke more cigarettes, to give my voice a certain quality.\"{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=228}} Bowie produced the Lulu recording of \"The Man Who Sold the World\" with [[Mick Ronson]] during the July 1973 ''[[Pin Ups]]'' sessions and also contributed guitar, [[saxophone]] and backing vocals. The remainder of the band included Ronson on guitar, [[Trevor Bolder]] on bass, [[Mike Garson]] on piano, and [[Aynsley Dunbar]] on drums.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=118}}\n\nLulu's \"The Man Who Sold the World\" was released as a [[music single|single]] on 11 January 1974 having been introduced by Lulu on the ''[[Top of the Pops|TOTP]]'' broadcast of 10 January 1974: the track only made its Top 50 debut (at #27) on the chart dated 26 January 1974 following a reprise performance by Lulu on ''TOTP'' two days earlier on 24 January 1974, with a third ''TOTP'' performance by Lulu on 7 February 1974 broadcast facilitating a boost from No. 13 to No. 5 on the chart dated 9 February 1974. In her ''TOTP'' performances in support of \"The Man Who Sold the World\" Lulu has been characterized as \"dressed and sounding exactly like a diminutive Bowie\".<ref name=\"Who Was That Man: a present for Mr Oscar Wilde\">{{cite book\n| first=Neil\n| last=Bartlett\n| year=1988\n| title=Who Was That Man: a present for Mr Oscar Wilde\n| publisher=Serpent's Tail\n| location=London\n| pages=[https://archive.org/details/whowasthatmanpre00bart/page/244 244]\n| isbn=978-1-85242-123-6\n| url=https://archive.org/details/whowasthatmanpre00bart/page/244\n}}</ref>\n\n===Chart positions===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Chart (1974)\n!Position\n|-\n|Belgian Singles Chart ''([[Ultratop]])''<ref name=\"LuluChart\">[http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Lulu&titel=The+Man+Who+Sold+The+World&cat=s Lulu \u2013 The Man Who Sold the World \u2013 peak chart positions] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110085413/http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Lulu&titel=The+Man+Who+Sold+The+World&cat=s |date=10 November 2013 }} dutchcharts.com.

The original band name was Helicopter but later changed to Nada Surf, which Caws said is \u201cactually referring to something much more existential, it's just surfing on nothing. Being lost in your head or in your imagination but you know, whenever I listen to music I always find myself off somewhere. Somewhere in space. You know, in mental space and it's a reference to that.\"<ref name=Toazted-mp3>{{cite web|title=Nada Surf Interview|url=http://www.toazted.com/player.php?mp3id=1096|work=Toazted.com|accessdate=31 October 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060604214017/http://www.toazted.com/interview/699/Nada-Surf.html|archivedate=June 4, 2006|format=Audio interview|date=July 2005}}</ref> They met in the [[Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de New York]]; both spent some of their childhood in France and [[Belgium]], and played in many bands, including The Cost of Living and Because Because Because. Their first drummer, Dan (later alluded to in the song \"The Plan\" from the album ''[[High/Low (Nada Surf album)|High/Low]]''), was replaced by Aaron Conte, with whom the band recorded its first 7\", ''The Plan/Telescope'' (1994/Stickboy), as well as the demo tape ''Tafkans'', the raw version of ''High/Low''. Those raw versions were later released on their second 7\", ''Deeper Well/Pressure Free'' (1995/Deep Elm Records), on the [[Karmic (EP)|''Karmic'' EP]] and on ''[[North 6th Street]]''.\n\nIn 1995, Conte left the band and was replaced by [[Ira Elliot]], former drummer of the [[Fuzztones]], a very active band from the eighties [[New York City|New York]] scene, and of whom both Caws and Lorca were fans. After a [[Blonde Redhead]] show at the [[Knitting Factory]], Nada Surf met former [[The Cars|Cars]] frontman and [[Weezer]] producer [[Ric Ocasek]].<ref name=\"cawsoc\">{{cite web |last1=Caws |first1=Matthew |title=The Time Ric Ocasek Helped My Band Make Its First Record |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/09/18/761688937/the-time-ric-ocasek-helped-my-band-make-its-first-record |website=NPR.org |accessdate=18 September 2019 |language=en}}</ref>  With little hope, they presented him with a copy of ''Tafkans''.

Prior to this, the band released the EP {Karmic} on No. 6 Records, a label run by Elektra A&R head [[Terry Tolkin]]. That summer, as Nada Surf toured the United States with [[Superdrag]], their song \"[[Popular (Nada Surf song)|Popular]]\" became a summer anthem, and the band toured overseas.\n\nIn 1998, the band released ''[[The Proximity Effect (Nada Surf album)|The Proximity Effect]]'', their follow-up album, in Europe. Produced by [[Fred Maher]], the album gained little commercial success in the US. Their record label, thinking the album lacked a hit like \"Popular\", had the band record several covers, including \"Black & White\" ([[The dBs]]) and \"Why Are You So Mean To Me?\" ([[Vitreous Humor (band)|Vitreous Humor]]), to use as singles. Tired of the requirements of the A&R director, the band judged the album was perfect as-is (even though Elektra suggested the inclusion of an acoustic version of \"Popular\"), and broke their contract. As a consequence, Elektra did not release the album in the US and dropped the band while they were on a promotional tour in Europe. Despite these events, this album was critically acclaimed in France, where the band made a 30-show tour the following year.<ref name=DallasObs-SpinalTap>{{cite news|last=Freedman|first=Pete|title=Q&A: Nada Surf's Matthew Caws Wishes His Band Was Spinal Tap.

The original band name was Helicopter but later changed to Nada Surf, which Caws said is \u201cactually referring to something much more existential, it's just surfing on nothing. Being lost in your head or in your imagination but you know, whenever I listen to music I always find myself off somewhere. Somewhere in space. You know, in mental space and it's a reference to that.\"<ref name=Toazted-mp3>{{cite web|title=Nada Surf Interview|url=http://www.toazted.com/player.php?mp3id=1096|work=Toazted.com|accessdate=31 October 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060604214017/http://www.toazted.com/interview/699/Nada-Surf.html|archivedate=June 4, 2006|format=Audio interview|date=July 2005}}</ref> They met in the [[Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais de New York]]; both spent some of their childhood in France and [[Belgium]], and played in many bands, including The Cost of Living and Because Because Because. Their first drummer, Dan (later alluded to in the song \"The Plan\" from the album ''[[High/Low (Nada Surf album)|High/Low]]''), was replaced by Aaron Conte, with whom the band recorded its first 7\", ''The Plan/Telescope'' (1994/Stickboy), as well as the demo tape ''Tafkans'', the raw version of ''High/Low''. Those raw versions were later released on their second 7\", ''Deeper Well/Pressure Free'' (1995/Deep Elm Records), on the [[Karmic (EP)|''Karmic'' EP]] and on ''[[North 6th Street]]''.\n\nIn 1995, Conte left the band and was replaced by [[Ira Elliot]], former drummer of the [[Fuzztones]], a very active band from the eighties [[New York City|New York]] scene, and of whom both Caws and Lorca were fans. After a [[Blonde Redhead]] show at the [[Knitting Factory]], Nada Surf met former [[The Cars|Cars]] frontman and [[Weezer]] producer [[Ric Ocasek]].<ref name=\"cawsoc\">{{cite web |last1=Caws |first1=Matthew |title=The Time Ric Ocasek Helped My Band Make Its First Record |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/09/18/761688937/the-time-ric-ocasek-helped-my-band-make-its-first-record |website=NPR.org |accessdate=18 September 2019 |language=en}}</ref>  With little hope, they presented him with a copy of ''Tafkans''.

Prior to this, the band released the EP {Karmic} on No. 6 Records, a label run by Elektra A&R head [[Terry Tolkin]]. That summer, as Nada Surf toured the United States with [[Superdrag]], their song \"[[Popular (Nada Surf song)|Popular]]\" became a summer anthem, and the band toured overseas.\n\nIn 1998, the band released ''[[The Proximity Effect (Nada Surf album)|The Proximity Effect]]'', their follow-up album, in Europe. Produced by [[Fred Maher]], the album gained little commercial success in the US. Their record label, thinking the album lacked a hit like \"Popular\", had the band record several covers, including \"Black & White\" ([[The dBs]]) and \"Why Are You So Mean To Me?\" ([[Vitreous Humor (band)|Vitreous Humor]]), to use as singles. Tired of the requirements of the A&R director, the band judged the album was perfect as-is (even though Elektra suggested the inclusion of an acoustic version of \"Popular\"), and broke their contract. As a consequence, Elektra did not release the album in the US and dropped the band while they were on a promotional tour in Europe. Despite these events, this album was critically acclaimed in France, where the band made a 30-show tour the following year.<ref name=DallasObs-SpinalTap>{{cite news|last=Freedman|first=Pete|title=Q&A: Nada Surf's Matthew Caws Wishes His Band Was Spinal Tap.

States]]. The population was 39,581 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US1760287| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Plainfield village, Illinois| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| work=American Factfinder| accessdate=February 22, 2019}}</ref> and an estimated 44,138 in 2018.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n\nThe village includes land in Will County's [[Plainfield Township, Will County, Illinois|Plainfield]] and [[Wheatland Township, Will County, Illinois|Wheatland]] townships, as well as [[Na-Au-Say Township, Kendall County, Illinois|Na-Au-Say]] and [[Oswego Township, Kendall County, Illinois|Oswego]] townships in Kendall County. With the growth in the [[Chicago]] suburbs in the 1990s and 2000s, the village has seen a population increase, from 4,500 in 1990 to 28,000 in 2000 to nearly 44,000 in 2017. It is between the cities of [[Naperville, Illinois|Naperville]] and [[Joliet, Illinois|Joliet]].\n\nThe village has established a community Preservation Commission and historic preservation ordinance. It is the home of the [[Lake Renwick Preserve]], a county forest preserve used for [[birdwatching]] and other activities. Located south of Village Hall is Settlers' Park, which includes a lake, war monument, open space, and more. The park presents outdoor concerts to the public in the summer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.plainfield-il.org/pages/settlerspark|title=Village of Plainfield, IL|website=www.plainfield-il.org|access-date=2018-04-25}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2009}}\nThe area was called \"Walkers' Grove\" until it was [[plat]]ted as \"Plainfield\" in 1841. It was originally settled by a large community of [[Potawatomi]] people, and the land was later bequeathed to the United States as part of the [[Treaty of St. Louis (1816)|Treaty of St. Louis (1816) with the Council of the Three Fires]]. Indian Boundary Road aligns with the western border of the tract of land originally ceded.\n\nThe earliest Europeans in the area were [[France|French]] fur traders. The first European-American settler in the area was James Walker, who with his father-in-law, [[Methodist]] minister Jessie Walker, traveled here in 1826 where he established a small mission for the Potawatomi people. James Walker, Jesse Walker's son-in-law, traveled with him and became the first European-American to claim land in the area in 1828.<ref>Le Baron, ''History of Will County'', page 478. W.M Le Baron, Jr. and Co. 1878</ref>\n\nIn 1828, James Walker, in the company of several men, erected a sawmill around which the settlement of Walkers' Grove developed.\n\nPlainfield is identified as the oldest community in Will County because the earliest settlement of Walkers' Grove was established on the banks of the [[DuPage River]] by 1828. However, the actual village of Plainfield was platted immediately north of Walkers' Grove in 1834 by Chester Ingersoll. The separate community of East Plainfield was platted in June 1836 by James Mathers, who began selling lots in July 1836. He also constructed a [[gristmill]] and a mill race west of Water Street, which would later become Plainfield-Naperville Road. Ingersoll's \"Planefield\" (Plainfield) which comprised lots in Section 16, along with Mather's East Plainfield lots in Section 10 and Levi Arnold's plat of Section 9, all became joined to create the present-day village after the death of Levi Arnolds in 1845.\n\nWalkers' Grove flourished because of the DuPage River and established routes to [[Fort Dearborn]] in [[Chicago]], as well as to [[Ottawa, Illinois|Ottawa]] to the west.

It is the home of the [[Lake Renwick Preserve]], a county forest preserve used for [[birdwatching]] and other activities. Located south of Village Hall is Settlers' Park, which includes a lake, war monument, open space, and more. The park presents outdoor concerts to the public in the summer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.plainfield-il.org/pages/settlerspark|title=Village of Plainfield, IL|website=www.plainfield-il.org|access-date=2018-04-25}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2009}}\nThe area was called \"Walkers' Grove\" until it was [[plat]]ted as \"Plainfield\" in 1841. It was originally settled by a large community of [[Potawatomi]] people, and the land was later bequeathed to the United States as part of the [[Treaty of St. Louis (1816)|Treaty of St. Louis (1816) with the Council of the Three Fires]]. Indian Boundary Road aligns with the western border of the tract of land originally ceded.\n\nThe earliest Europeans in the area were [[France|French]] fur traders. The first European-American settler in the area was James Walker, who with his father-in-law, [[Methodist]] minister Jessie Walker, traveled here in 1826 where he established a small mission for the Potawatomi people. James Walker, Jesse Walker's son-in-law, traveled with him and became the first European-American to claim land in the area in 1828.<ref>Le Baron, ''History of Will County'', page 478. W.M Le Baron, Jr. and Co. 1878</ref>\n\nIn 1828, James Walker, in the company of several men, erected a sawmill around which the settlement of Walkers' Grove developed.\n\nPlainfield is identified as the oldest community in Will County because the earliest settlement of Walkers' Grove was established on the banks of the [[DuPage River]] by 1828. However, the actual village of Plainfield was platted immediately north of Walkers' Grove in 1834 by Chester Ingersoll. The separate community of East Plainfield was platted in June 1836 by James Mathers, who began selling lots in July 1836. He also constructed a [[gristmill]] and a mill race west of Water Street, which would later become Plainfield-Naperville Road. Ingersoll's \"Planefield\" (Plainfield) which comprised lots in Section 16, along with Mather's East Plainfield lots in Section 10 and Levi Arnold's plat of Section 9, all became joined to create the present-day village after the death of Levi Arnolds in 1845.\n\nWalkers' Grove flourished because of the DuPage River and established routes to [[Fort Dearborn]] in [[Chicago]], as well as to [[Ottawa, Illinois|Ottawa]] to the west. Reuben Flagg hauled lumber from Walker's mill to Chicago in order to erect the first two frame structures in the city (the P.F.W. Peck House and the George Dole Forwarding House). Chicago also depended upon the settlement for mail and supplies.\n[[File:Flanders House (5978683004).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|The Flanders House in Plainfield]]\nThe community's early prosperity was stunted when the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] opened in 1848, because the village was not located along the canal.

The earliest architects associated with buildings in Plainfield are J.E. Minott of Aurora; G. Julian & John Barnes of Joliet; and Herbert Cowell of Joliet and Plainfield.\n\nOn August 28, 1990, an F5 tornado ran its course through Plainfield. The \"Plainfield Tornado\" killed 29 people, 24 of whom were killed instantly, and 350 were injured. More than 1,000 homes were damaged and destroyed. The tornado made it across more than {{convert|16|mi}} in only 8 minutes. It destroyed the only Plainfield high school at the time, now called Plainfield Central High School.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theherald-news.com/2015/08/21/plainfield-1990-tornado-was-unique-in-its-formation-destruction-rebuilding/a3gw9ar/ |title=Plainfield 1990 tornado was unique in its formation, destruction, rebuilding |access-date=2018-05-03 |language=en}}</ref> A population boom started to take place at the end of the 20th century after the tornado, with a large number of new home subdivisions. Before this, Plainfield was primarily an agricultural town.\n\nCertain older parts of Plainfield once suffered from extreme traffic congestion. Before [[Interstate 55]] was built just east of the village in the late 1950s, [[U.S. Route 30]] (the [[Lincoln Highway]]) and [[U.S. Route 66]] (sometimes referred to as \"The Mother Road\") merged into one street for three blocks in the center of town on what is now [[Illinois Route 59]]. The merge was between Plainfield/Joliet Road on the south to Lockport Street on the north, but continues to be an area of heavy traffic congestion even outside heavy commuting periods.{{Original research inline|date=November 2009}} At one time, the two longest paved highways in the world ([[Lincoln Highway]] and [[U.S. Route 66]]) crossed within Plainfield. The highways only crossed each other twice and both locations are in Will County. The other location is in neighboring [[Joliet, Illinois|Joliet]].\n\n==Geography==\nPlainfield is located in northwestern Will County at {{Coord|41|37|2|N|88|12|10|W|type:city}} (41.617280, -88.202837).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> The village limits extend west into the eastern part of Kendall County.

Thousands of years ago, land in greater Plainfield used to be part of the bed of proglacial Lake Wauponsee. However, the lake did not hold up long, and eventually drained into the Illinois River valley.<ref>http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/midewin/geology03.html</ref> The lake left behind a very flat landscape.
