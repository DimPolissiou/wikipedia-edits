The name Zwickau is probably a [[Germanization]] of the [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] toponym ''\u0160wikawa'', which derives from [[Svarog|Svarozi\u010d]], the Slavic Sun and fire god.<ref>''Zwickau'' by Stadtbaurat Ebersbach in: Deutschlands St\u00e4dtebau (Germany's Urban Development), Deutscher Architektur und Industrieverlag Berlin 1921</ref> In the 10th century, German settlers began arriving and the native Slavs were [[Christianize]]d. A trading place known as ''terretorio Zcwickaw''(in [[Medieval Latin]]) was mentioned in 1118. The settlement received a town charter in 1212, and hosted [[Franciscans]] and [[Cistercians]] during the 13th century. Zwickau was a [[free imperial city]] from 1290\u20131323, but was subsequently granted to the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Although regional mining began in 1316, extensive mining increased with the discovery of silver in the [[Schneeberg, Saxony|Schneeberg]] in 1470. Because of the silver ore deposits in the Erzgebirge, Zwickau developed in the 15th and 16th centuries and grew to be an important economic and cultural centre of Saxony.\n\nIts nine churches include the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church of St.&nbsp;Mary (1451\u20131536), with a spire {{convert|285|ft|abbr=on}} high and a bell weighing 51 [[ton]]s. The church contains an altar with wood carvings, eight paintings by [[Michael Wohlgemuth]] and a [[piet\u00e0]] in carved and painted wood by [[Peter Breuer (woodcarver)|Peter Breuer]].\n\n[[File:Zwickau Katharinenkirche.jpg|thumb|left|St. Catharine's church]]\nThe late Gothic church of [[Catherine of Alexandria|St.&nbsp;Catharine]] has an altar piece ascribed to [[Lucas Cranach the elder]], and is remembered because [[Thomas M\u00fcntzer]] was once pastor there (1520\u201322). The town hall was begun in 1404 and rebuilt many times since. The municipal archives include documents dating back to the 13th century.\n\nEarly printed books from the Middle Ages, historical documents, letters and books are kept in the Town Archives (e.g. Meister Singer volumes by [[Hans Sachs]] (1494\u20131576)), and in the School Library founded by scholars and by the town clerk Stephan Roth during the Reformation.in \n\nIn 1520 [[Martin Luther]] dedicated his treatise \"On the Freedom of the Christian Man\" to his friend Hermann Muehlpfort, the Lord Mayor of Zwickau. The [[Anabaptist]] movement of 1525 began at Zwickau under the inspiration of the \"[[Zwickau prophets]]\".<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Zwickau|volume=28|page=1061}}</ref> After Wittenberg, it became the first city in Europe to join the [[Lutheran Reformation]]. The late Gothic Gewandhaus (cloth merchants' hall), was built in 1522\u201324 and is now converted into a theatre. The city was seriously damaged during the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n\nThe old city of Zwickau, perched on a hill, is surrounded by heights with extensive forests and a municipal park. Near the town are the Hartenstein area, for example, with Stein and Wolfsbrunn castles and the Prinzenh\u00f6hle cav, as well as the Auersberg peak (1019 meters) and the winter sports areas around Johanngeorgenstadt and the Vogtland.\n\nIn the Old Town the Cathedral and the ''Gewandhaus'' (cloth merchants' hall) originate in the 16th century and when Schneeberg silver was traded. In the 19th century the city's economy was driven by industrial coal mining and later by automobile manufacturing.\n\n[[File:Gedenkst\u00e4tte f\u00fcr die Opfer des Nationalsozialismus am Schwanenteich 02.jpg|thumb|Memorial at the resting place of 325 victims of Nazi Germany]]\nDuring [[World War II]], in 1942, a Nazi [[show trial]] of the members of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Czarny Legion|pl|Czarny Legion (polska organizacja konspiracyjna)}} [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish underground resistance organization]] from [[Gosty\u0144]] was held in Zwickau, after which 12 members were executed in [[Dresden]], and several dozen were imprisoned in [[Nazi concentration camps]], where 37 of them died.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://opinie.wp.pl/czarny-legion-polska-organizacja-podziemna-rozbita-przez-niemcow-6126041043765377a?src01=f1e45|title=Czarny Legion - polska organizacja podziemna rozbita przez Niemc\u00f3w|website=WP Opinie|author=Wojciech K\u00f6nigsberg|accessdate=8 March 2020|language=Polish}}</ref> In May 1942, five [[Poles|Polish]] students of the Salesian Oratory in [[Pozna\u0144]], known as the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Pozna\u0144 Five|pl|Pozna\u0144ska pi\u0105tka}}'' or five of the [[108 Martyrs of World War II|108 Blessed Polish Martyrs of World War II]], were imprisoned in Zwickau, before being executed in Dresden.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gosc.pl/doc/5803763.Poznanska-piatka|title=Pozna\u0144ska pi\u0105tka|website=Gosc.pl|accessdate=8 March 2020|language=Polish}}</ref> A subcamp of the [[Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp]] was located in Zwickau, whose prisoners were mostly [[Poles]] and [[Russians]], but also [[Italians]], [[French people|French]], [[Hungarians]], [[Jews]], [[Czechs]], [[Germans]] and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gedenkstaette-flossenbuerg.de/en/history/satellite-camps/zwickau|title=Zwickau Subcamp|website=KZ-Gedenkst\u00e4tte Flossenb\u00fcrg|accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 April 1945, US troops entered the city. They withdrew on 30 June 1945 and handed Zwickau to the [[Soviet]] [[Red Army]]. Between 1944 and 2003, the city had a population of over 100,000.\n\nA major employer is [[Volkswagen]] which assembles its Golf, Passat and Phaeton models in the Zwickau-Mosel vehicle plant.\n\n===Economic history===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R85422, Zwickau, Schacht Br\u00fcckenberg I.jpg|thumb|The ''Br\u00fcckenberg I'' [[Hard coal]] mine (later named Karl-Marx), here in 1948]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0315-006, Zwickau, Trabi ade.jpg|thumb|Production of the last Trabant in 1990]]\n\n====Coal mining====\nCoal mining is mentioned as early as 1348.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> However, mining on an industrial scale first started in the early 19th century. The coal mines of Zwickau and the neighbouring Oelsnitz-Lugau coalfield contributed significantly to the industrialisation of the region and the town.\n\nIn 1885 Carl Wolf invented an improved gas-detecting safety mining-lamp. He held the first world patent for it. Together with his business partner Friemann he founded the \"Friemann & Wolf\" factory. Coal mining ceased in 1978. About 230 million tonnes had been mined to a depth of over 1,000 metres. In 1992 Zwickau's last coke oven plant was closed. \n\nMany industrial branches developed in the town in the wake of the coal mining industry: mining equipment, iron and steel works, textile, machinery in addition to chemical, porcelain, paper, glass, dyestuffs, wire goods, tinware, stockings, and curtains. There were also steam saw-mills, diamond and glass polishing works, iron-foundries, and breweries.\n\n====Automotive industry====\nIn 1904 the [[Horch]] [[automobile]] plant was founded, followed by the [[Audi]] factory in 1909. In 1932 both brands were incorporated into [[Auto Union]] but retained their independent trademarks. The [[Auto Union racing car]]s, developed by [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and [[Robert Eberan von Eberhorst]], driven by [[Bernd Rosemeyer]], [[Hans Stuck]], [[Tazio Nuvolari]], [[Ernst von Delius]], became well known all over the world. During World War II, the Nazi government operated a satellite camp of the [[Flossenb\u00fcrg]] concentration camp in Zwickau which was sited near the Horch Auto Union plant. The Nazi administration built a hard labour prison camp at [[Osterstein Castle]]. Both camps were liberated by the US Army in 1945. On 1 August 1945 military administration was handed over to the Soviet Army. The Auto Union factories of Horch and Audi were dismantled by the Soviets; Auto Union relocated to [[Ingolstadt]], Bavaria, evolving into the present day [[Audi]] company. In 1948 all large companies were seized by the East German government.\n\nWith the founding of the [[German Democratic Republic]] in 1949 in East Germany, post-war reconstruction began. In 1958 the Horch and Audi factories were merged into the [[Sachsenring]] plant. At the Sachsenring automotive plant the compact ''[[Trabant]]'' cars were manufactured. These small cars had a two-cylinder, two-stroke engine. The car was the first vehicle in the world to be industrially manufactured with a plastic car body. The former VEB Sachsenring manufacturing site was acquired by [[Volkswagen]] in 1990 and has since been redeveloped as an engine and transmission manufacturing facility.\n\n[[Audi|Audi-AG]] together with the city of Zwickau operates the [[August Horch Museum Zwickau|August Horch Museum]] in the former Audi works.\n\n====Uranium mining====\nTwo major industrial facilities of the Soviet [[Wismut (mining company)|SDAG Wismut]] were situated in the city: the uranium mill in Zwickau-Crossen, producing uranium concentrate (known as \"yellow cake\") from ores mined in the Erzgebirge and Thuringia, and the machine building plant in Zwickau-Cainsdorf producing equipment for the uranium mines and mills of East Germany. Uranium milling ended in 1989, and after the unification the Wismut machine building plant was sold to a private investor.\n\n==Boundaries==\nZwickau is bounded by [[M\u00fclsen]], [[Reinsdorf, Saxony|Reinsdorf]], [[Wilkau-Hasslau]], [[Hirschfeld, Saxony|Hirschfeld]] ([[Verwaltungsgemeinschaft Kirchberg]]), [[Lichtentanne]], [[Werdau]], [[Neukirchen, Zwickau|Neukirchen]], [[Crimmitschau]], [[Dennheritz]] ([[Verwaltungsgemeinschaft Crimmitschau]]) and the city of [[Glauchau]].\n\n==Incorporations==\n* 1895: P\u00f6lbitz\n* 1902: Marienthal\n* 1905: Eckersbach\n* 1922: Weissenborn\n* 1923: Schedewitz\n* 1939: Brand and Bockwa\n* 1944: Oberhohndorf and [[Planitz]]\n* 1953: Auerbach, P\u00f6hlau and Niederhohndorf\n* 1993: Hartmannsdorf\n* 1996: Rottmannsdorf\n* 1996: Crossen (with 4 municipalities on January 1, 1994 Schneppendorf)\n* 1999: Cainsdorf, Mosel, [[Oberrothenbach]] and Schlunzig along with H\u00fcttelsgr\u00fcn (Lichtentanne) and Freiheitssiedlung\n\n==Population==\n{|border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Year\n! style=\"background:#efefef;\"|Population\n|-----\n|1462||align=\"right\"|ca. 3,900\n|-----\n|1530||align=\"right\"|ca. 7,677\n|-----\n|1640||align=\"right\"|2,693\n|-----\n|1723||align=\"right\"|3,753\n|-----\n|1800||align=\"right\"|4,189\n|-----\n|1840||align=\"right\"|9,740\n|-----\n|1861||align=\"right\"|20,492\n|-----\n|1871||align=\"right\"|27,322\n|-----\n|December 1, 1875 \u00b9||align=\"right\"|31,491\n|-----\n|December 1, 1890 \u00b9||align=\"right\"|44,198\n|-----\n|December 1, 1900 \u00b9||align=\"right\"|55,825\n|-----\n|December 1, 1905 \u00b9||align=\"right\"|68,502\n|-----\n|December 1, 1910 \u00b9||align=\"right\"|73,542\n|-----\n|June 16, 1925 \u00b9||align=\"right\"|80,358\n|-----\n|June 16, 1933 \u00b9||align=\"right\"|84,701\n|-----\n|May 17, 1939 \u00b9||align=\"right\"|85,198\n|-----\n|October 29, 1946||align=\"right\"|122,862\n|-----\n|August 31, 1950||align=\"right\"|138,844\n|-----\n|December 1, 1960||align=\"right\"|129,138\n|-----\n|December 31, 1972||align=\"right\"|124,796\n|-----\n|June 30, 1981||align=\"right\"|121,800\n|-----\n|1986||align=\"right\"|120,900\n|-----\n|June 30, 1997||align=\"right\"|102,100\n|-----\n|December 31, 2002||align=\"right\"|100,892\n|-----\n|December 31, 2012||align=\"right\"|95,089\n|}\n\u00b9 Census data\n\n\n==Economy==\nThe production of the Trabant was discontinued after German reunification, but [[Volkswagen]] built a new factory, and Sachsenring is now a supplier for the automobile industry.

The nearest major airports are [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]] and [[Dresden Airport]], both of which offer a large number of national and international flights.\n\n==Museums==\n[[File:Zwickau Robert Schumann Birth House.jpg|thumb|righr|House where [[Robert Schumann]] was born 1810, museum at Hauptmarkt 5]]\nIn the town centre there are three museums: an art museum from the 19th century and the houses of priests from 13th century, both located next to St.&nbsp;Mary's church. Just around the corner there is the Robert-Schumann museum. The museums offer different collections dedicated to the history of the town, as well as art and a mineralogical, palaeontological and geological collection with many specimens from the town and the nearby Erzgebirge mountains.\n\nZwickau is the birthplace of the composer [[Robert Schumann]]. The house where he was born in 1810 still stands in the marketplace. This is now called [[Robert Schumann House]] and is a museum dedicated to him.\n\nThe histories of the [[Audi]] and [[Horch]] [[automobile]] factories are presented at the ''[[August Horch Museum Zwickau]]''. The museum is an ''Anchor Point'' of the [[European Route of Industrial Heritage]] (EIRH).\n\n==Historical mayors==\n[[File:Zwickau Rathaus.jpg|thumb|Town hall, main fa\u00e7ade from 1866\u201367 and earlier.]]\n* 1501 \u2013 1518: Erasmus Stella\n* 1518 \u2013 1530: Hermann M\u00fchlpfort\n* 1800, 1802, 1804, 1806, 1808, 1810, 1812, 1814: Carl Wilhelm Ferber\n* 1801, 1803, 1805, 1807, 1809, 1811, 1813, 1815, 1817, 1819: Tobias Hempel\n* 1816, 1818, 1820, 1822: Christian Gottlieb Haugk\n* 1821, 1823, 1825, 1826: Carl Heinrich Rappius\n* 1824 \u2013 Christian Heinrich Pinther\n* 1827 \u2013 1830: Christian Heinrich M\u00fchlmann, Stadtvogt\n* 1830 \u2013 1832: Franz Adolf Marbach\n* 1832 \u2013 1860: Friedrich Wilhelm Meyer\n* 1860 \u2013 1898: Lothar Streit, from 1874 ''Lord Mayor''\n* 1898 \u2013 1919: Karl Keil\n* 1919 \u2013 1934: Richard Holz\n* 1934 \u2013 1945: Ewald Dost\n* 1945: Fritz Weber (acting Lord Mayor)\n* 1945: [[Georg Ulrich Handke]] (1894-1962) (acting Lord Mayor)\n* 1945 \u2013 1949: Paul M\u00fcller\n* 1949 \u2013 1954: Otto Assmann (1901-1977)\n* 1954 \u2013 1958: Otto Schneider\n* 1958 \u2013 1969: Gustav Seifried\n* 1969 \u2013 1973: Liesbeth Windisch\n* 1973 \u2013 1977: Helmut Repmann\n* 1977 \u2013 1990: Heiner Fischer (1936-2016)\n* 1990 \u2013 2001: Rainer Eichhorn (born 1950)\n* 2001 \u2013 2008: Dietmar Vettermann (born 1957)\n* 2008 \u2013 until now Pia Findeiss (born 1956)\n\n==Notable people==\n===Born Before 1900===\n[[File:Portrait of Robert Schumann.jpg|thumb|170px|Robert Schumann]]\n[[File:Iano Cornarius.jpg|thumb|170px|Janus Cornarius]]\n* [[Nicholas Storch]], (before 1500\u2013after 1536), weaver and lay preacher (Zwickau Prophets)\n* [[Janus Cornarius]], (c. 1500\u20131558), philologist and physicians\n[[File:Jacob Leupold 1674-1727 (01).JPG|thumb|170px|Jacob Leupold]]\n* [[Gregor Haloander]], (1501\u20131531), jurist\n* [[David K\u00f6ler]], (1532\u20131565), musician, organist, choirmaster, composer\n* [[Jacob Leupold]], (1674\u20131727), German mechanic and instrument maker\n* [[Robert Schumann]], (1810\u20131856) composer of the romantic era\n* [[Heinrich Schurtz]], (1863\u20131903), German ethnologist and historian\n* [[August Horch]], (1868\u20131952), automotive engineer, honorary doctorate from the Technical University of [[Braunschweig]]\n* [[Heinrich Waentig]], (1870\u20131943), German economist and politician (SPD)\n* [[Hans Dominik (writer)|Hans Dominik]], (1872\u20131945), German writer, journalist and engineer\n* [[Fritz Bleyl]], (1880\u20131966) expressionist painter and architect\n* [[Max Pechstein]], (1881\u20131955) expressionist painter\n* [[Margaret Scott (suffragette)|\"Margaret Scott\"]] (1888-1973) was a militant suffragette in London\n* [[Paul Langheinrich]], (1895-1979) German genealogist\n\n===Born after 1900===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1982-1123-416, Gerhard Sch\u00fcrer.jpg|thumb|160px|Gerhard Sch\u00fcrer in 1982]]\n* [[Robert Eberan von Eberhorst]], (1902\u20131982) Austrian automotive engineer\n* [[Gershom Schocken]] (1912\u20131990), Israeli journalist and politician\n* [[Gert Fr\u00f6be]], (1913\u20131988), actor in numerous film and stage roles including [[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]] (1964)\n* [[Gerhard Sch\u00fcrer]], (1921\u20132010), German politician (SED)\n* [[Gerhard Sommer]] (born 1921), SS-Untersturmf\u00fchrer (Second Lieutenant) involved in the massacre of 560 civilians\n* [[Rolf H\u00e4drich]], (1931\u20132000), German film director and screenwriter\n* [[Dieter F.

The name Zwickau is probably a [[Germanization]] of the [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] toponym ''\u0160wikawa'', which derives from [[Svarog|Svarozi\u010d]], the Slavic Sun and fire god.<ref>''Zwickau'' by Stadtbaurat Ebersbach in: Deutschlands St\u00e4dtebau (Germany's Urban Development), Deutscher Architektur und Industrieverlag Berlin 1921</ref> In the 10th century, German settlers began arriving and the native Slavs were [[Christianize]]d. A trading place known as ''terretorio Zcwickaw''(in [[Medieval Latin]]) was mentioned in 1118. The settlement received a town charter in 1212, and hosted [[Franciscans]] and [[Cistercians]] during the 13th century. Zwickau was a [[free imperial city]] from 1290\u20131323, but was subsequently granted to the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Although regional mining began in 1316, extensive mining increased with the discovery of silver in the [[Schneeberg, Saxony|Schneeberg]] in 1470. Because of the silver ore deposits in the Erzgebirge, Zwickau developed in the 15th and 16th centuries and grew to be an important economic and cultural centre of Saxony.\n\nIts nine churches include the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church of St.&nbsp;Mary (1451\u20131536), with a spire {{convert|285|ft|abbr=on}} high and a bell weighing 51 [[ton]]s. The church contains an altar with wood carvings, eight paintings by [[Michael Wohlgemuth]] and a [[piet\u00e0]] in carved and painted wood by [[Peter Breuer (woodcarver)|Peter Breuer]].\n\n[[File:Zwickau Katharinenkirche.jpg|thumb|left|St. Catharine's church]]\nThe late Gothic church of [[Catherine of Alexandria|St.&nbsp;Catharine]] has an altar piece ascribed to [[Lucas Cranach the elder]], and is remembered because [[Thomas M\u00fcntzer]] was once pastor there (1520\u201322). The town hall was begun in 1404 and rebuilt many times since. The municipal archives include documents dating back to the 13th century.\n\nEarly printed books from the Middle Ages, historical documents, letters and books are kept in the Town Archives (e.g. Meister Singer volumes by [[Hans Sachs]] (1494\u20131576)), and in the School Library founded by scholars and by the town clerk Stephan Roth during the Reformation.in \n\nIn 1520 [[Martin Luther]] dedicated his treatise \"On the Freedom of the Christian Man\" to his friend Hermann Muehlpfort, the Lord Mayor of Zwickau. The [[Anabaptist]] movement of 1525 began at Zwickau under the inspiration of the \"[[Zwickau prophets]]\".<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Zwickau|volume=28|page=1061}}</ref> After Wittenberg, it became the first city in Europe to join the [[Lutheran Reformation]]. The late Gothic Gewandhaus (cloth merchants' hall), was built in 1522\u201324 and is now converted into a theatre. The city was seriously damaged during the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n\nThe old city of Zwickau, perched on a hill, is surrounded by heights with extensive forests and a municipal park. Near the town are the Hartenstein area, for example, with Stein and Wolfsbrunn castles and the Prinzenh\u00f6hle cav, as well as the Auersberg peak (1019 meters) and the winter sports areas around Johanngeorgenstadt and the Vogtland.\n\nIn the Old Town the Cathedral and the ''Gewandhaus'' (cloth merchants' hall) originate in the 16th century and when Schneeberg silver was traded. In the 19th century the city's economy was driven by industrial coal mining and later by automobile manufacturing.\n\n[[File:Gedenkst\u00e4tte f\u00fcr die Opfer des Nationalsozialismus am Schwanenteich 02.jpg|thumb|Memorial at the resting place of 325 victims of Nazi Germany]]\nDuring [[World War II]], in 1942, a Nazi [[show trial]] of the members of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Czarny Legion|pl|Czarny Legion (polska organizacja konspiracyjna)}} [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish underground resistance organization]] from [[Gosty\u0144]] was held in Zwickau, after which 12 members were executed in [[Dresden]], and several dozen were imprisoned in [[Nazi concentration camps]], where 37 of them died.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://opinie.wp.pl/czarny-legion-polska-organizacja-podziemna-rozbita-przez-niemcow-6126041043765377a?src01=f1e45|title=Czarny Legion - polska organizacja podziemna rozbita przez Niemc\u00f3w|website=WP Opinie|author=Wojciech K\u00f6nigsberg|accessdate=8 March 2020|language=Polish}}</ref> In May 1942, five [[Poles|Polish]] students of the Salesian Oratory in [[Pozna\u0144]], known as the ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Pozna\u0144 Five|pl|Pozna\u0144ska pi\u0105tka}}'' or five of the [[108 Martyrs of World War II|108 Blessed Polish Martyrs of World War II]], were imprisoned in Zwickau, before being executed in Dresden.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gosc.pl/doc/5803763.Poznanska-piatka|title=Pozna\u0144ska pi\u0105tka|website=Gosc.pl|accessdate=8 March 2020|language=Polish}}</ref> A subcamp of the [[Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp]] was located in Zwickau, whose prisoners were mostly [[Poles]] and [[Russians]], but also [[Italians]], [[French people|French]], [[Hungarians]], [[Jews]], [[Czechs]], [[Germans]] and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gedenkstaette-flossenbuerg.de/en/history/satellite-camps/zwickau|title=Zwickau Subcamp|website=KZ-Gedenkst\u00e4tte Flossenb\u00fcrg|accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 April 1945, US troops entered the city.

The coal mines of Zwickau and the neighbouring Oelsnitz-Lugau coalfield contributed significantly to the industrialisation of the region and the town.\n\nIn 1885 Carl Wolf invented an improved gas-detecting safety mining-lamp. He held the first world patent for it. Together with his business partner Friemann he founded the \"Friemann & Wolf\" factory. Coal mining ceased in 1978. About 230 million tonnes had been mined to a depth of over 1,000 metres. In 1992 Zwickau's last coke oven plant was closed. \n\nMany industrial branches developed in the town in the wake of the coal mining industry: mining equipment, iron and steel works, textile, machinery in addition to chemical, porcelain, paper, glass, dyestuffs, wire goods, tinware, stockings, and curtains. There were also steam saw-mills, diamond and glass polishing works, iron-foundries, and breweries.\n\n====Automotive industry====\nIn 1904 the [[Horch]] [[automobile]] plant was founded, followed by the [[Audi]] factory in 1909. In 1932 both brands were incorporated into [[Auto Union]] but retained their independent trademarks. The [[Auto Union racing car]]s, developed by [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and [[Robert Eberan von Eberhorst]], driven by [[Bernd Rosemeyer]], [[Hans Stuck]], [[Tazio Nuvolari]], [[Ernst von Delius]], became well known all over the world. During World War II, the Nazi government operated a satellite camp of the [[Flossenb\u00fcrg]] concentration camp in Zwickau which was sited near the Horch Auto Union plant. The Nazi administration built a hard labour prison camp at [[Osterstein Castle]]. Both camps were liberated by the US Army in 1945. On 1 August 1945 military administration was handed over to the Soviet Army. The Auto Union factories of Horch and Audi were dismantled by the Soviets; Auto Union relocated to [[Ingolstadt]], Bavaria, evolving into the present day [[Audi]] company. In 1948 all large companies were seized by the East German government.\n\nWith the founding of the [[German Democratic Republic]] in 1949 in East Germany, post-war reconstruction began. In 1958 the Horch and Audi factories were merged into the [[Sachsenring]] plant. At the Sachsenring automotive plant the compact ''[[Trabant]]'' cars were manufactured. These small cars had a two-cylinder, two-stroke engine. The car was the first vehicle in the world to be industrially manufactured with a plastic car body. The former VEB Sachsenring manufacturing site was acquired by [[Volkswagen]] in 1990 and has since been redeveloped as an engine and transmission manufacturing facility.\n\n[[Audi|Audi-AG]] together with the city of Zwickau operates the [[August Horch Museum Zwickau|August Horch Museum]] in the former Audi works.\n\n====Uranium mining====\nTwo major industrial facilities of the Soviet [[Wismut (mining company)|SDAG Wismut]] were situated in the city: the uranium mill in Zwickau-Crossen, producing uranium concentrate (known as \"yellow cake\") from ores mined in the Erzgebirge and Thuringia, and the machine building plant in Zwickau-Cainsdorf producing equipment for the uranium mines and mills of East Germany.
