It is explained in the comics that Quan Chi remade his original body with magic, making him no longer a cyborg. During the war, as Quan Chi suffers a defeat, he loses control over the souls of Sub Zero, Scorpion and Jax, effectively resurrecting them. 25 years later and after the comic book prequel, Kuai Liang becomes the new grandmaster of the Lin Kuei, thanks to Kung Jin's help whom he and [[Bo' Rai Cho]] hired to steal a data stick containing a computer virus. He later uses this virus to free [[Cyrax]] and other human Lin Kuei warriors turned cyborgs from Sektor's enslavement. He would also make amends with Scorpion by revealing that Sektor and Quan Chi were involved in the murder of Hanzo's family and clan, as well as Bi-Han's downfall. Five years later, he helps [[Johnny Cage]]'s team of recruited warriors by testing them at the Lin Kuei temple. Sub-Zero eventually witnesses the Jinsei's corruption by Shinnok. He later finds Cassie Cage's team ambushed by [[Kotal Kahn]]'s Outworld army, and alongside his clan, drives Kotal's army back to Outworld, allowing Cassie's team to reach a now compromised Shaolin Temple to stop Shinnok. Sub-Zero's cybernetic form is reused in ''Mortal Kombat X'' as a DLC and hidden variation for Triborg who can also take the form of Cyrax, Sektor and [[Smoke (Mortal Kombat)|Cyber Smoke]].\n\nWhen the time anomaly caused by Kronika occurs in ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]'', Sub-Zero survived the kidnapping and massacre by the advanced time-displaced Cyber Lin Kuei, but Frost is missing after abandoning Lin Kuei, so he alerted Scorpion of the Cyber Lin Kuei's return. Though they were too late to save his clansmen, Sub-Zero and Scorpion infiltrate the factory to shut it down once again, with the past Cyrax's help. They soon found out Frost became the first ever female cyborg, and Sektor's most-trusted second in-command and successor by will, much to their disgust of her betrayal by her own pride and envy for joining the likes of Kronika. Once they freed Cyrax, as well as defeating Frost, Noob Saibot and Sektor, Sub-Zero promises Cyrax to find a way to restore him, no matter what forms but retain his humanity, before the freed cyborg uses his life to shut down the factory. Due to the destruction of his Lin Kuei base, including Shaolin Sky Temple and Special Force HQ, Sub-Zero and the surviving allied forces shelters in Shirai-Ryu Fire Garden where they learned from Raiden about Kronika's connection to both Shinnok and Cetrion, her schemes, and Elder Gods' perish by her and her daughter's hands, leaving Raiden as the sole survivor. Sub-Zero and Scorpion later scout out the home of the Netherrealm's guardian Kharon, where Scorpion tells Sub-Zero to return to Shirai-Ryu Fire Garden while he saves Kharon. The younger, revenant Scorpion returns after D'Vorah kills his older counterpart, leading to a brief fight between him and Sub-Zero as he, as well as Raiden did not trust Hanzo's younger counterpart, though Liu Kang soon realize shortly that Scorpion really want to redeem himself on his late-future human-self's behalf, eventually forgives him once Raiden unlocks the visions of the previously defunct timelines caused by Kronika's machinations. Later, he and the younger Scorpion team up to aid Earthrealm's forces in the attack on Kronika's Keep, where Raiden, who manage to return older Jax back to the good side confirms Sub-Zero that Frost is indeed the backup commander of Cyber Lin Kuei, should Sektor die. In Sub-Zero\u2019s ending, he defeats Kronika and begins to craft the sands of time to start a new timeline, but before he would do that, he began to think of Bi-Han and understand his past history with Sektor and as his time as Noob Saibot.

The scar was originally red, and later changed to blue in ''Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance'' as a result of Sub-Zero's enhanced powers. In ''Mortal Kombat: Deception'', his scar has faded to the point where it can no longer be seen. He now wore an armored uniform heavily inspired by [[Dynasties in Chinese history|Dynastic era Chinese]] battle armor, though it was often criticized by fans as being too reminiscent of ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' villain, the [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]]. However, Sub-Zero's alternate uniform was very reminiscent of Chinese culture, even featuring Sub-Zero without a cowl and a [[Qing Dynasty]]-era hairstyle. In ''Mortal Kombat: Armageddon'', Sub-Zero reverts to his masked costume from ''Deadly Alliance'', retaining the scar, which is not part of his alternate costume (which is the primary one from ''Deception''). Since ''Deadly Alliance'', Sub-Zero is the only character who has shown considerable signs of aging. Concept art from ''Deadly Alliance'' depicted him with a graying, receding hairline, and a more pale and gaunt face, while his scar was now blue and his forearms frozen over. Although Sub-Zero originally had blue eyes, they turned white after he obtained the Dragon Medallion in the game. Sub-Zero's appearance in ''Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks'' was one of the most revised ones from the title. Character lead Mark Lappin did almost ten passes on his design; producer Shaun Himmerick noted that \"we went through literally 5-6 heads and styles of head costume on him\" and commented that Sub-Zero's design in ''Mortal Kombat'' was difficult to make although most people called it \"simple\". In the end, the staff was satisfied with his final look in the game as it reminisces them to his classic outfit.<ref name=\"devd\">{{cite web|url= http://www.mortalkombatonline.com/content/forum/showmessage.cds?id=52997|title=Developer Diary#3: Characters|publisher=Mortal Kombat Online|author=Himmerick, Shaun|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}</ref> His appearance in ''Injustice 2'' was redesigned by [[Jim Lee]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/jimlee/status/860660286167973889|title=Jim Lee on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhen he first appeared in the first ''Mortal Kombat'', Sub-Zero featured only two special moves: his ice blast and sliding kick. These moves have become Sub-Zero's trademark since then, being featured in every game that Sub-Zero has appeared in (''Mortal Kombat II'' and subsequent games feature the younger Sub-Zero). ''Mortal Kombat II'' added his ground freeze move, and two new [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatalities]] including the now-famous one where he would freeze and shatter the victim. According to Boon, Sub-Zero's Freeze was originally omitted from the game in place of the Ice Shower, but was brought back in the next revision following fan feedback at a local arcade.<ref name=\"egm95\" /> Sub-Zero's ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]''-inspired<ref>Reyan Ali, [http://www.complex.com/video-games/2012/09/ed-boons-12-best-mortal-kombat-memories/#gallery Ed Boon's 12 Biggest Mortal Kombat Memories], Complex.com, September 12, 2012</ref> Fatality, the \"Spine Rip,\" is considered by Boon to be his favorite Fatality from the first game as well as the most controversial.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]] Premium Edition |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=October 11, 2006 |level=\"The History of Fatalities\" commentary}}</ref> Some home versions of the first game replaced the \"Spine Rip\" with another finishing move due to its violent content.<ref name=\"artgr\" /> Unlike other returning characters whose moves remained intact, this Fatality was not carried over to ''Mortal Kombat II'' and ''Mortal Kombat 3,''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/115/1159114p1.html |title=The Evolution of Mortal Kombat Fatalities at IGN |publisher=Uk.xbox360.ign.com |date= |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327034223/http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/115/1159114p1.html |archivedate=March 27, 2012 }}</ref> but was brought back in ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'' as one of Classic Sub-Zero's finishers. However, the move was intentionally censored by Midway; right after he grabbed onto his opponent, the screen went black and only the resulting sound effects were heard. This was due to the development team choosing not to animate the spine rip fatality for each of the updated character sprites in the game. The [[Nintendo 64]] port of ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' gives all of the younger Sub-Zero's special techniques and finishing moves to the classic masked version, due to the fact the N64's cartridge format had memory restrictions that did not allow the use of both masked and unmasked characters. The developers had to remove the \"Spine Rip\" from ''Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe'' as that game was aimed at a younger audience.<ref name=\"booninter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/207906/ed-boon-talks-mortal-kombat-secrets-mk-vs-dc-and-the-future-of-m-rated-fighters/|title=Ed Boon talks Mortal Kombat secrets, MK vs. DC, and the future of M-rated fighters|publisher=GamePro|author=Shuman, Sid|date=November 17, 2008|accessdate=December 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223113402/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/207906/ed-boon-talks-mortal-kombat-secrets-mk-vs-dc-and-the-future-of-m-rated-fighters/|archivedate=December 23, 2008}}</ref> Sub-Zero also gained a teleporting move in the game in which he freezes himself and falls back to the ground, appearing behind the foe.<ref name=\"dcinter\"/>\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn the ''[[Mortal Kombat (comics)|Blood & Thunder]]'' series, the elder Sub-Zero is featured, seeking Shang Tsung's death faithful to his game profile. Accompanied by fellow Lin Kuei member Hydro (an original character created for the comics), he confronted Scorpion and surpassed his fear of him when he realized that was what fuelled the specter's powers. Like the other characters, he pursued the powers of the Tao Te Zhan. In the ''Battlewave'' series, Sub-Zero allied himself with [[Kitana]], Kung Lao, and [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]] to overthrow [[Shao Kahn]].

The ''Mortal Kombat 3'' version of Sub-Zero made a cameo appearance in the epilogue of [[Malibu Comics]]' 1995 ''[[Mortal Kombat (comics)|Battlewave]]'' miniseries, in which he froze a group of Lin Kuei while proclaiming that the clan was corrupted and no longer worthy of his services. This subplot was never developed as the ''Mortal Kombat'' comic book series folded shortly thereafter.\n\nIn the first ''Mortal Kombat'' movie, the elder Sub-Zero was played by [[Fran\u00e7ois Petit]] and served as one of Shang Tsung's guardians alongside Scorpion in the tournament.

Bi-Han, believing Hanzo was protecting his family, decides to end the feud between their two clans out of respect for his friend. He becomes saddened and enraged by the fact that his clan had supposedly killed Hanzo, his family, and his clan. He then discovers that Quan Chi had impersonated him. Having been chosen to fight for Earthrealm in Mortal Kombat, he encounters Hanzo on the battlefield.

It is explained in the comics that Quan Chi remade his original body with magic, making him no longer a cyborg. During the war, as Quan Chi suffers a defeat, he loses control over the souls of Sub Zero, Scorpion and Jax, effectively resurrecting them. 25 years later and after the comic book prequel, Kuai Liang becomes the new grandmaster of the Lin Kuei, thanks to Kung Jin's help whom he and [[Bo' Rai Cho]] hired to steal a data stick containing a computer virus. He later uses this virus to free [[Cyrax]] and other human Lin Kuei warriors turned cyborgs from Sektor's enslavement. He would also make amends with Scorpion by revealing that Sektor and Quan Chi were involved in the murder of Hanzo's family and clan, as well as Bi-Han's downfall. Five years later, he helps [[Johnny Cage]]'s team of recruited warriors by testing them at the Lin Kuei temple. Sub-Zero eventually witnesses the Jinsei's corruption by Shinnok. He later finds Cassie Cage's team ambushed by [[Kotal Kahn]]'s Outworld army, and alongside his clan, drives Kotal's army back to Outworld, allowing Cassie's team to reach a now compromised Shaolin Temple to stop Shinnok. Sub-Zero's cybernetic form is reused in ''Mortal Kombat X'' as a DLC and hidden variation for Triborg who can also take the form of Cyrax, Sektor and [[Smoke (Mortal Kombat)|Cyber Smoke]].\n\nWhen the time anomaly caused by Kronika occurs in ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]'', Sub-Zero survived the kidnapping and massacre by the advanced time-displaced Cyber Lin Kuei, but Frost is missing after abandoning Lin Kuei, so he alerted Scorpion of the Cyber Lin Kuei's return. Though they were too late to save his clansmen, Sub-Zero and Scorpion infiltrate the factory to shut it down once again, with the past Cyrax's help. They soon found out Frost became the first ever female cyborg, and Sektor's most-trusted second in-command and successor by will, much to their disgust of her betrayal by her own pride and envy for joining the likes of Kronika. Once they freed Cyrax, as well as defeating Frost, Noob Saibot and Sektor, Sub-Zero promises Cyrax to find a way to restore him, no matter what forms but retain his humanity, before the freed cyborg uses his life to shut down the factory. Due to the destruction of his Lin Kuei base, including Shaolin Sky Temple and Special Force HQ, Sub-Zero and the surviving allied forces shelters in Shirai-Ryu Fire Garden where they learned from Raiden about Kronika's connection to both Shinnok and Cetrion, her schemes, and Elder Gods' perish by her and her daughter's hands, leaving Raiden as the sole survivor. Sub-Zero and Scorpion later scout out the home of the Netherrealm's guardian Kharon, where Scorpion tells Sub-Zero to return to Shirai-Ryu Fire Garden while he saves Kharon. The younger, revenant Scorpion returns after D'Vorah kills his older counterpart, leading to a brief fight between him and Sub-Zero as he, as well as Raiden did not trust Hanzo's younger counterpart, though Liu Kang soon realize shortly that Scorpion really want to redeem himself on his late-future human-self's behalf, eventually forgives him once Raiden unlocks the visions of the previously defunct timelines caused by Kronika's machinations. Later, he and the younger Scorpion team up to aid Earthrealm's forces in the attack on Kronika's Keep, where Raiden, who manage to return older Jax back to the good side confirms Sub-Zero that Frost is indeed the backup commander of Cyber Lin Kuei, should Sektor die. In Sub-Zero\u2019s ending, he defeats Kronika and begins to craft the sands of time to start a new timeline, but before he would do that, he began to think of Bi-Han and understand his past history with Sektor and as his time as Noob Saibot. Sub-Zero then crafts a reality where he frees Bi-Han and fights side by side with his brother once again.\n\nKuai Liang is playable in the [[Fictional crossovers in video games|crossover]] title ''[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]]'', involved in a war between the eponymous fictional universes and is the protagonist for one chapter of the story mode. In Sub-Zero's ending, he realizes he is no longer the assassin he once was and leaves the Lin Kuei. Inspired by [[Batman]], he becomes a [[superhero]] donning a new costume with a cape; unknown to him, the Lin Kuei are on his trail because they do not tolerate desertion.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe]] |developer=Midway Amusement Games |publisher=Midway Games |date=2008 |level=Chapter 4: Sub-Zero}}</ref> Sub-Zero makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' during Scorpion's intro, in which Scorpion is about to perform a fatality on the downed Sub-Zero before being pulled into the [[DC Universe]]. Sub-Zero appears as a playable character alongside Raiden via downloadable content in the game's sequel, ''[[Injustice 2]]''. Despite having some references from his crossover appearance in ''Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe'', Sub-Zero's ending is revealed to have taken place while he was forcing Kotal's army back to Outworld in ''Mortal Kombat X'', when suddenly Sub-Zero was transported into DC's ''Injustice'' universe. In his ending, after he defeats [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], Batman offers to help him return to his universe. Sub-Zero becomes a teacher to the three youngest members of Batman's [[Justice League]] ([[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]], [[Jaime Reyes|Blue Beetle]], and [[Firestorm#Jason Rusch|Firestorm]]) in the process, while waiting for Batman to develop a portal to the ''Mortal Kombat'' universe, which accidentally frees [[Superman]] as well as Superman's new Kryptonian allies [[General Zod]], Ursa, and Non from the [[Phantom Zone]] instead.

The scar was originally red, and later changed to blue in ''Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance'' as a result of Sub-Zero's enhanced powers. In ''Mortal Kombat: Deception'', his scar has faded to the point where it can no longer be seen. He now wore an armored uniform heavily inspired by [[Dynasties in Chinese history|Dynastic era Chinese]] battle armor, though it was often criticized by fans as being too reminiscent of ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' villain, the [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]]. However, Sub-Zero's alternate uniform was very reminiscent of Chinese culture, even featuring Sub-Zero without a cowl and a [[Qing Dynasty]]-era hairstyle. In ''Mortal Kombat: Armageddon'', Sub-Zero reverts to his masked costume from ''Deadly Alliance'', retaining the scar, which is not part of his alternate costume (which is the primary one from ''Deception''). Since ''Deadly Alliance'', Sub-Zero is the only character who has shown considerable signs of aging. Concept art from ''Deadly Alliance'' depicted him with a graying, receding hairline, and a more pale and gaunt face, while his scar was now blue and his forearms frozen over. Although Sub-Zero originally had blue eyes, they turned white after he obtained the Dragon Medallion in the game. Sub-Zero's appearance in ''Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks'' was one of the most revised ones from the title. Character lead Mark Lappin did almost ten passes on his design; producer Shaun Himmerick noted that \"we went through literally 5-6 heads and styles of head costume on him\" and commented that Sub-Zero's design in ''Mortal Kombat'' was difficult to make although most people called it \"simple\". In the end, the staff was satisfied with his final look in the game as it reminisces them to his classic outfit.<ref name=\"devd\">{{cite web|url= http://www.mortalkombatonline.com/content/forum/showmessage.cds?id=52997|title=Developer Diary#3: Characters|publisher=Mortal Kombat Online|author=Himmerick, Shaun|accessdate=December 26, 2008}}</ref> His appearance in ''Injustice 2'' was redesigned by [[Jim Lee]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/jimlee/status/860660286167973889|title=Jim Lee on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhen he first appeared in the first ''Mortal Kombat'', Sub-Zero featured only two special moves: his ice blast and sliding kick. These moves have become Sub-Zero's trademark since then, being featured in every game that Sub-Zero has appeared in (''Mortal Kombat II'' and subsequent games feature the younger Sub-Zero). ''Mortal Kombat II'' added his ground freeze move, and two new [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatalities]] including the now-famous one where he would freeze and shatter the victim. According to Boon, Sub-Zero's Freeze was originally omitted from the game in place of the Ice Shower, but was brought back in the next revision following fan feedback at a local arcade.<ref name=\"egm95\" /> Sub-Zero's ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]''-inspired<ref>Reyan Ali, [http://www.complex.com/video-games/2012/09/ed-boons-12-best-mortal-kombat-memories/#gallery Ed Boon's 12 Biggest Mortal Kombat Memories], Complex.com, September 12, 2012</ref> Fatality, the \"Spine Rip,\" is considered by Boon to be his favorite Fatality from the first game as well as the most controversial.<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]] Premium Edition |developer=Midway |publisher=Midway |date=October 11, 2006 |level=\"The History of Fatalities\" commentary}}</ref> Some home versions of the first game replaced the \"Spine Rip\" with another finishing move due to its violent content.<ref name=\"artgr\" /> Unlike other returning characters whose moves remained intact, this Fatality was not carried over to ''Mortal Kombat II'' and ''Mortal Kombat 3,''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/115/1159114p1.html |title=The Evolution of Mortal Kombat Fatalities at IGN |publisher=Uk.xbox360.ign.com |date= |accessdate=July 20, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327034223/http://uk.xbox360.ign.com/articles/115/1159114p1.html |archivedate=March 27, 2012 }}</ref> but was brought back in ''Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3'' as one of Classic Sub-Zero's finishers. However, the move was intentionally censored by Midway; right after he grabbed onto his opponent, the screen went black and only the resulting sound effects were heard. This was due to the development team choosing not to animate the spine rip fatality for each of the updated character sprites in the game. The [[Nintendo 64]] port of ''Mortal Kombat Trilogy'' gives all of the younger Sub-Zero's special techniques and finishing moves to the classic masked version, due to the fact the N64's cartridge format had memory restrictions that did not allow the use of both masked and unmasked characters. The developers had to remove the \"Spine Rip\" from ''Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe'' as that game was aimed at a younger audience.<ref name=\"booninter\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/207906/ed-boon-talks-mortal-kombat-secrets-mk-vs-dc-and-the-future-of-m-rated-fighters/|title=Ed Boon talks Mortal Kombat secrets, MK vs. DC, and the future of M-rated fighters|publisher=GamePro|author=Shuman, Sid|date=November 17, 2008|accessdate=December 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223113402/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/207906/ed-boon-talks-mortal-kombat-secrets-mk-vs-dc-and-the-future-of-m-rated-fighters/|archivedate=December 23, 2008}}</ref> Sub-Zero also gained a teleporting move in the game in which he freezes himself and falls back to the ground, appearing behind the foe.<ref name=\"dcinter\"/>\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn the ''[[Mortal Kombat (comics)|Blood & Thunder]]'' series, the elder Sub-Zero is featured, seeking Shang Tsung's death faithful to his game profile. Accompanied by fellow Lin Kuei member Hydro (an original character created for the comics), he confronted Scorpion and surpassed his fear of him when he realized that was what fuelled the specter's powers. Like the other characters, he pursued the powers of the Tao Te Zhan. In the ''Battlewave'' series, Sub-Zero allied himself with [[Kitana]], Kung Lao, and [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]] to overthrow [[Shao Kahn]]. During the final ''Tournament Edition'' issue, Sub-Zero is depicted as being the victor of Shao Kahn's tournament, defeating [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]] and claiming the Dragon Medallion, despite being mortally wounded by [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]]. The ''Mortal Kombat 3'' version of Sub-Zero made a cameo appearance in the epilogue of [[Malibu Comics]]' 1995 ''[[Mortal Kombat (comics)|Battlewave]]'' miniseries, in which he froze a group of Lin Kuei while proclaiming that the clan was corrupted and no longer worthy of his services. This subplot was never developed as the ''Mortal Kombat'' comic book series folded shortly thereafter.\n\nIn the first ''Mortal Kombat'' movie, the elder Sub-Zero was played by [[Fran\u00e7ois Petit]] and served as one of Shang Tsung's guardians alongside Scorpion in the tournament. Although Shang Tsung does make a reference to the rivalry between Scorpion and Sub-Zero early in the film, their relationship is not explored and both are slaves under the sorcerer's command. He is killed in combat by Liu Kang when he is impaled and frozen.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Goldman, Michael  |author2=Aaron, Richard E.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Mortal Kombat: The Movie|year=1995 |publisher=[[Prima Games]]|isbn=0-7615-0082-0}}</ref> In the animated film ''[[Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins]]'', a prequel to live-action film, the elder Sub-Zero was once again featured alongside Scorpion as servants to Shang Tsung and their feud was explained by Raiden through flashbacks, although interpreted differently from that in the games.<ref>{{cite video |date = 1995 |title = [[Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins]] |type = VHS |publisher = New Line}}</ref>\n\n[[File:MKASUB-ZERO.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Keith Cooke]] as Sub-Zero in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'']]\n\nThe younger Sub-Zero made an appearance in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]]'', where he was portrayed by [[Keith Cooke]], who had played [[Reptile (Mortal Kombat)|Reptile]] in the first movie. After saving both Liu Kang and Kitana from an ambush by Smoke, Sub-Zero has an inconclusive fight with Scorpion, who kidnaps Kitana and escapes.

The two fought to a draw and Scorpion escaped when Kung Lao and his friends came to Sub-Zero's aid.

In the next episode it is revealed that Quan Chi impersonated him in order to deceive Scorpion into believing that Sub-Zero murdered his family and clan to enact a false sense of vengeance in him against Bi-Han and gain his allegiance for the upcoming Mortal Kombat tournament.

When they become adults, Kuai Liang threatens Hanzo and his family while out for a walk and Hanzo is forced to kill Kuai Liang. Bi-Han, believing Hanzo was protecting his family, decides to end the feud between their two clans out of respect for his friend. He becomes saddened and enraged by the fact that his clan had supposedly killed Hanzo, his family, and his clan. He then discovers that Quan Chi had impersonated him. Having been chosen to fight for Earthrealm in Mortal Kombat, he encounters Hanzo on the battlefield. Bi-Han's efforts to explain himself to Hanzo are fruitless, as Hanzo is now an undead specter only responding to the name Scorpion, who then kills Bi-Han by ripping out his spine.\n\n[[Joe Taslim]] will portray the Bi-Han version of Sub-Zero in ''[[Mortal Kombat (2021 film)]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/raid-actor-joe-taslim-play-zero-mortal-kombat-movie-1222984|title='Mortal Kombat' Movie Finds Its Sub-Zero (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Galuppo|first=Mia|date=July 9, 2019|accessdate=July 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA brief image of Sub-Zero can be seen in the short film ''[[Mortal Kombat: Rebirth]]'' where dialogue implies a deadly rivalry between him and Hanzo Hasashi.

The western ridgeline of the valley, also part of the greater Massanutten range, is composed primarily of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain with a smaller highland valley in between, called Little Fort Valley. The far southern end of Fort Valley contains a small highland sub-valley called Crisman's Hollow, between Catback and Kerns mountains. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains, knobs, notches and mountain gaps within the ridges of Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point named Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountain in the southernmost valley and flowing north, fed by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. \n\nFort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains. The [[Elizabeth Furnace]] and [[Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area]] of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. \n\n==Roads and Gaps==\n\nBetween Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two significant gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of  Woodstock to the [https://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/cs/recarea?ss=110808&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=FSE_003738&navid=110240000000000&pnavid=110000000000000&position=generalinfo&recid=74047&ttype=recarea&pname=Woodstock%20Tower%20Observation%20Site Woodstock Tower], which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain.  Woodstock Tower offers panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley and was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. \n\nBetween Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley. In the east, Fort Valley is accessed via a paved road through Edith Gap that also serves as entrance to Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area. There are no roads accessing Fort Valley over Massanutten Mountain from Camp Roosevelt on the southeast to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley.\n\nRoads exit the valley at its northern end ([[Virginia State Route 678|S.R. 678]]) between [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] and [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], at Edinburg Gap ([[Virginia State Route 675|S.R. 675]]) towards [[Edinburg, Virginia|Edinburg]], Moreland Gap ([[Virginia State Route 730|S.R. 730]]) towards [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]]. There is also the dirt road that leads to [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] ([[Virginia State Route 758|S.R 758]]) over Powell Mountain.\n\n==Hiking Trails and Recreation Areas==\n\nThe [[Tuscarora_Trail|Tuscarora trail]], a 252-mile long distance hiking trail that passes through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland,  Pennsylvania, proceeds along the northeast ridgeline of Fort Valley, entering from just above Shenandoah State Park on the eastern ridgeline of Massanutten Mountain. The hiking trail passes through the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area, ascends Green Mountain and exits on Doll's Ridge on the western slope of Three Top Mountain as it descends towards the [[Tom's Brook Battlefield]] in the Shenandoah Valley. \n\nThe [[Massanutten Trail]] circumnavigates the entire ridgeline of the Fort Valley, 71 miles in total. It was built by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), completed in 2001. Prior to 2001, different portions of the trail had been known by different names and blazed in different colors. With the completion of the missing links, the Forest Service renamed the combined trails as the Massanutten Trail and provided orange blazes along the trail's entire length around Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley features two developed U.S. Forest Service recreation areas, [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73687 Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area] toward the northern apex of the Valley, and [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73633 Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area] at Edith Gap in the southeast end of the valley. Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail.  Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and acess to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.)\n\n==Special Biological Areas==\n\nThe ridges of Fort Valley administered by the U.S. Forest Service contain several Special Biological Areas (SBA). These include Mudhole Gap SBA in the northern end of the Little Fort Valley; Peters Mill Run Bog SBA in the upper reaches of the Little Fort Valley area just south of Woodstock Tower; Signal Knob SBA and the Edinburg Gap Shale Barrens SBA, two of the easternmost Appalachian shale barrens <ref>https://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/edc/Documents/HabitatGuides/13.pdf</ref>; and Scothorn Gap SBA, a 34 acre forest plan-designated Special Biological Area in the southernmost edge of Masanutten Mountain. Waterfall Mountain Cliffs, in the southern extremity of the Fort Valley's Masanutten Mountain ridgeline just south of Scothorn Gap, has been recommended by Virginia Division of Natural Heritage to be designated as a Special Biological Area as it contains significant amounts of semi-primitive acreage.<ref>http://www.vawilderness.org/uploads/1/7/4/4/17446555/massanutten.pdf</ref>\n\n==History==\nFort Valley was a native American hunting ground. The name Massanutten is said to mean \"Indian Basket,\" the Fort Valley being contained and perhaps shaped like an Indian basket and certainly abounding in wild game in early times.<ref>http://www.vagenweb.org/shenandoah/hom/S_pfv.html</ref>  While no permanent settlements were located there, Indian relics have been found on several temporary village sites. In 1740s Massanutten Mountain was called Peaked Mountain, and later it was known as Buffalo Mountain. George Washington surveyed Fort Valley for [[Lord Fairfax]] in 1748<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>.\n\nA settler named Powell, reputed to be a fugitive from the law, took refuge in the valley in the northwestern mountain. The area was then called Powell's Fort Mountain or Powell's Fort Valley, and later just \"The Fort.\" The area Powell inhabited is now known as Powell's Mountain, and Fort Valley. Powell is supposed to have found silver or gold in the area. About 1733, frontier hunters settled in \"The Fort\" and others soon followed.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>\n\nAccording to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible winter retreat had the Continental Army been defeated by the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]]. Washington had spent extensive time surveying the valley in his earlier life, and likely had  been impressed by the natural defenses offered by the mountain-contained valley. Thirty years later, after a hard winter at Valley Forge, Washington stated that if the war did not turn in their favor by the next winter, rather than surrender the Army would move south to the Shenandoah and make a stand in \"The Fort.\" About this time Morgan reportedly began building a road into the valley, but when the Continental armies had success work stopped.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref> Primary access would have been through a high pass now called Sherman's Gap along rough road partially constructed by Morgan; the route became known as Morgan's Road. Portions of the road are still visible and accessible by a hiking trail near Sherman's Gap, but in lower elevations the route is lost and unknown. In any case, the [[Continental Army]]'s victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] made Washington's theoretical plans unnecessary. Why Morgan would have picked a military road over a nearly 2,000 foot minor gap as opposed an easier route along the water line of Passage Creek is unclear, leading some to believe the story is apocryphal. \n\n[[Elizabeth Furnace]] was a blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 \u2013 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>. In 1936 the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area on the site.\n\nSignal Knob, a 2,111 foot barren promontory at the extreme northern ridgeline of Fort Valley offering sweeping, unobstructed panoramic views of of the Shenandoah Valley northeast and west, was utilized during a Civil War as an important Confederate military observation post. In skirmishing over control of Signal Knob, several Confederate soldiers were killed.

The western ridgeline of the valley, also part of the greater Massanutten range, is composed primarily of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain with a smaller highland valley in between, called Little Fort Valley. The far southern end of Fort Valley contains a smaller highland valley called Crisman's Hollow, between Catback and Kerns mountains. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains, knobs, notches and mountain gaps within the ridges of Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point named Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountain in the southernmost valley and flowing north, fed by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. \n\nFort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains. The [[Elizabeth Furnace]] and [[Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area]] of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. \n\n==Roads and Gaps==\n\nBetween Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two significant gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of  Woodstock to the [https://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/cs/recarea?ss=110808&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=FSE_003738&navid=110240000000000&pnavid=110000000000000&position=generalinfo&recid=74047&ttype=recarea&pname=Woodstock%20Tower%20Observation%20Site Woodstock Tower], which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain.  Woodstock Tower offers panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley and was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. \n\nBetween Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley. In the east, Fort Valley is accessed via a paved road through Edith Gap that also serves as entrance to Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area. There are no roads accessing Fort Valley over Massanutten Mountain from Camp Roosevelt on the southeast to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley.\n\nRoads exit the valley at its northern end ([[Virginia State Route 678|S.R. 678]]) between [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] and [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], at Edinburg Gap ([[Virginia State Route 675|S.R. 675]]) towards [[Edinburg, Virginia|Edinburg]], Moreland Gap ([[Virginia State Route 730|S.R. 730]]) towards [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]]. There is also the dirt road that leads to [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] ([[Virginia State Route 758|S.R 758]]) over Powell Mountain.\n\n==Hiking Trails and Recreation Areas==\n\nThe [[Tuscarora_Trail|Tuscarora trail]], a 252-mile long distance hiking trail that passes through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland,  Pennsylvania, proceeds along the northeast ridgeline of Fort Valley, entering from just above Shenandoah State Park on the eastern ridgeline of Massanutten Mountain. The hiking trail passes through the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area, ascends Green Mountain and exits on Doll's Ridge on the western slope of Three Top Mountain as it descends towards the [[Tom's Brook Battlefield]] in the Shenandoah Valley. \n\nThe [[Massanutten Trail]] circumnavigates the entire ridgeline of the Fort Valley, 71 miles in total. It was built by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), completed in 2001. Prior to 2001, different portions of the trail had been known by different names and blazed in different colors. With the completion of the missing links, the Forest Service renamed the combined trails as the Massanutten Trail and provided orange blazes along the trail's entire length around Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley features two developed U.S. Forest Service recreation areas, [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73687 Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area] toward the northern apex of the Valley, and [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73633 Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area] at Edith Gap in the southeast end of the valley. Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail.  Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and acess to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.)\n\n==Special Biological Areas==\n\nThe ridges of Fort Valley administered by the U.S. Forest Service contain several Special Biological Areas (SBA). These include Mudhole Gap SBA in the northern end of the Little Fort Valley; Peters Mill Run Bog SBA in the upper reaches of the Little Fort Valley area just south of Woodstock Tower; Signal Knob SBA and the Edinburg Gap Shale Barrens SBA, two of the easternmost Appalachian shale barrens <ref>https://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/edc/Documents/HabitatGuides/13.pdf</ref>; and Scothorn Gap SBA, a 34 acre forest plan-designated Special Biological Area in the southernmost edge of Masanutten Mountain. Waterfall Mountain Cliffs, in the southern extremity of the Fort Valley's Masanutten Mountain ridgeline just south of Scothorn Gap, has been recommended by Virginia Division of Natural Heritage to be designated as a Special Biological Area as it contains significant amounts of semi-primitive acreage.<ref>http://www.vawilderness.org/uploads/1/7/4/4/17446555/massanutten.pdf</ref>\n\n==History==\nFort Valley was a native American hunting ground. The name Massanutten is said to mean \"Indian Basket,\" the Fort Valley being contained and perhaps shaped like an Indian basket and certainly abounding in wild game in early times.<ref>http://www.vagenweb.org/shenandoah/hom/S_pfv.html</ref>  While no permanent settlements were located there, Indian relics have been found on several temporary village sites. In 1740s Massanutten Mountain was called Peaked Mountain, and later it was known as Buffalo Mountain. George Washington surveyed Fort Valley for [[Lord Fairfax]] in 1748<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>.\n\nA settler named Powell, reputed to be a fugitive from the law, took refuge in the valley in the northwestern mountain. The area was then called Powell's Fort Mountain or Powell's Fort Valley, and later just \"The Fort.\" The area Powell inhabited is now known as Powell's Mountain, and Fort Valley. Powell is supposed to have found silver or gold in the area. About 1733, frontier hunters settled in \"The Fort\" and others soon followed.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>\n\nAccording to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible winter retreat had the Continental Army been defeated by the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]]. Washington had spent extensive time surveying the valley in his earlier life, and likely had  been impressed by the natural defenses offered by the mountain-contained valley. Thirty years later, after a hard winter at Valley Forge, Washington stated that if the war did not turn in their favor by the next winter, rather than surrender the Army would move south to the Shenandoah and make a stand in \"The Fort.\" About this time Morgan reportedly began building a road into the valley, but when the Continental armies had success work stopped.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref> Primary access would have been through a high pass now called Sherman's Gap along rough road partially constructed by Morgan; the route became known as Morgan's Road. Portions of the road are still visible and accessible by a hiking trail near Sherman's Gap, but in lower elevations the route is lost and unknown. In any case, the [[Continental Army]]'s victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] made Washington's theoretical plans unnecessary. Why Morgan would have picked a military road over a nearly 2,000 foot minor gap as opposed an easier route along the water line of Passage Creek is unclear, leading some to believe the story is apocryphal. \n\n[[Elizabeth Furnace]] was a blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 \u2013 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>. In 1936 the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area on the site.\n\nSignal Knob, a 2,111 foot barren promontory at the extreme northern ridgeline of Fort Valley offering sweeping, unobstructed panoramic views of of the Shenandoah Valley northeast and west, was utilized during a Civil War as an important Confederate military observation post. In skirmishing over control of Signal Knob, several Confederate soldiers were killed. One still lies buried there and his grave that inspired the poem, \"The Georgia Volunteer.\"<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref> Signal Knob can view the nearby Shenandoah Valley battlefields of Cedar Creek, [[Fisher's Hill]] and Tom's Brook. It is accessed by an 11.5 mile round-trip hike from Elizabeth Furnace. Otherwise during the Civil War no battle was fought in Fort Valley, but [[General Imboden]]'s cavalry camped there at times.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>\n\nThe [[Daniel Munch House]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{authority control}}\n[[Category:Landforms of Shenandoah County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Valleys of Virginia]]\n\n\n{{ShenandoahCountyVA-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Woodrusher", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Valley_(Virginia)"}

They stated that these initial investigations had found that the aircraft took about five and a half minutes to descend from the decompression event at 29,000 feet to the altitude of 10,000 feet and that it appeared that part of an oxygen cylinder and its valve had entered the passenger cabin, then impacted with the number 2 right door handle, turning it part way.  The ATSB noted that there was no risk of the door being opened by this movement, with the door systems performing as designed.  All three of the aircraft's [[instrument landing system]]s as well as the anti-skid braking system were unavailable for the landing; the pilots subsequently landed the aircraft without using those systems. Most of the oxygen masks deployed in the incident, with 426 out of the 476 deployed being activated by the 346 passengers, pulling them down to activate the flow of oxygen.<ref name=\"ATSB_200833\">\n{{ cite press release\n |url = http://www.atsb.gov.au/newsroom/2008/release/2008_33.aspx\n |title = Depressurisation, 475 km north-west of Manila, Philippines, 25 July 2008, Boeing Company 747-438, VH-OJK\n |publisher = [[Australian Transport Safety Bureau]]\n |date = 29 August 2008\n |accessdate = 16 April 2009\n}}</ref>\n\n===Preliminary findings===\nThe cause of the [[aviation accident|accident]] has been determined to be an exploding [[oxygen tank]] in the cargo area, according to a preliminary finding of the [[Australian Transport Safety Bureau]]:<ref name=\"ATSB-2008-053\">\n{{cite book\n  | title = Depressurisation \u2013 VH-OJK, Boeing 747-438, 475 km north-west of Manila Airport, Philippines 25 July 2008\n  | work = [[Australian Transport Safety Bureau]]\n  | date = 29 August 2008\n  | url = http://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2008/aair/ao-2008-053.aspx\n  | isbn = 978-1-921490-65-1\n  | accessdate = 29 August 2008\n}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"After clearing the baggage and cargo from the forward aircraft hold, it was evident that one passenger oxygen cylinder (number-4 from a bank of seven cylinders along the right side of the cargo hold) had sustained a sudden failure and forceful discharge of its pressurised contents into the aircraft hold, rupturing the fuselage in the vicinity of the wing-fuselage leading edge fairing.

The aircraft was cruising at 29,000 ft and was 55 minutes into a flight between Hong Kong and Melbourne.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"Following an emergency descent to 10,000 ft, the flight crew diverted the aircraft to Ninoy Aquino International Airport, Manila, Philippines, where it landed safely. None of the passengers or crew sustained any physical injury.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"A team of investigators, led by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and including representatives from the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), Boeing and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) examined the aircraft on the ground in Manila. From that work, it was evident that the oxygen cylinder (number-4 in a bank along the right side of the forward cargo hold) had burst in such a way as to rupture the adjacent fuselage wall and be propelled upwards; puncturing the cabin floor and impacting the frame and handle of the R2 door and the overhead cabin panelling. No part of the cylinder (other than the valve assembly) was recovered and it was presumed lost from the aircraft during the depressurisation.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"The ATSB undertook a close and detailed study of the cylinder type, including a review of all possible failure scenarios and an engineering evaluation of other cylinders from the same production batch and of the type in general. It was evident that the cylinder had failed by bursting through, or around the base \u2013 allowing the release of pressurised contents to project it vertically upwards. While it was hypothesised that the cylinder may have contained a defect or flaw, or been damaged in a way that promoted failure, there was no evidence found to support such a finding. Nor was there any evidence found to suggest the cylinders from the subject production batch, or the type in general, were in any way predisposed to premature failure.\"</blockquote>\n\n==Repairs==\nRepairs to the aircraft were conducted in Manila by Boeing.

They stated that these initial investigations had found that the aircraft took about five and a half minutes to descend from the decompression event at 29,000 feet to the altitude of 10,000 feet and that it appeared that part of an oxygen cylinder and its valve had entered the passenger cabin, then impacted with the number 2 right door handle, turning it part way.  The ATSB noted that there was no risk of the door being opened by this movement, with the door systems performing as designed.  All three of the aircraft's [[instrument landing system]]s as well as the anti-skid braking system were unavailable for the landing; the pilots subsequently landed the aircraft without using those systems. Most of the oxygen masks deployed in the incident, with 426 out of the 476 deployed being activated by the 346 passengers, pulling them down to activate the flow of oxygen.<ref name=\"ATSB_200833\">\n{{ cite press release\n |url = http://www.atsb.gov.au/newsroom/2008/release/2008_33.aspx\n |title = Depressurisation, 475 km north-west of Manila, Philippines, 25 July 2008, Boeing Company 747-438, VH-OJK\n |publisher = [[Australian Transport Safety Bureau]]\n |date = 29 August 2008\n |accessdate = 16 April 2009\n}}</ref>\n\n===Preliminary findings===\nThe cause of the [[aviation accident|accident]] has been determined to be an exploding [[oxygen tank]] in the cargo area, according to a preliminary finding of the [[Australian Transport Safety Bureau]]:<ref name=\"ATSB-2008-053\">\n{{cite book\n  | title = Depressurisation \u2013 VH-OJK, Boeing 747-438, 475 km north-west of Manila Airport, Philippines 25 July 2008\n  | work = [[Australian Transport Safety Bureau]]\n  | date = 29 August 2008\n  | url = http://www.atsb.gov.au/publications/investigation_reports/2008/aair/ao-2008-053.aspx\n  | isbn = 978-1-921490-65-1\n  | accessdate = 29 August 2008\n}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"After clearing the baggage and cargo from the forward aircraft hold, it was evident that one passenger oxygen cylinder (number-4 from a bank of seven cylinders along the right side of the cargo hold) had sustained a sudden failure and forceful discharge of its pressurised contents into the aircraft hold, rupturing the fuselage in the vicinity of the wing-fuselage leading edge fairing.

The aircraft was cruising at 29,000 ft and was 55 minutes into a flight between Hong Kong and Melbourne.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"Following an emergency descent to 10,000 ft, the flight crew diverted the aircraft to Ninoy Aquino International Airport, Manila, Philippines, where it landed safely. None of the passengers or crew sustained any physical injury.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"A team of investigators, led by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) and including representatives from the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), Boeing and the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) examined the aircraft on the ground in Manila. From that work, it was evident that the oxygen cylinder (number-4 in a bank along the right side of the forward cargo hold) had burst in such a way as to rupture the adjacent fuselage wall and be propelled upwards; puncturing the cabin floor and impacting the frame and handle of the R2 door and the overhead cabin panelling. No part of the cylinder (other than the valve assembly) was recovered and it was presumed lost from the aircraft during the depressurisation.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"The ATSB undertook a close and detailed study of the cylinder type, including a review of all possible failure scenarios and an engineering evaluation of other cylinders from the same production batch and of the type in general. It was evident that the cylinder had failed by bursting through, or around the base \u2013 allowing the release of pressurised contents to project it vertically upwards. While it was hypothesised that the cylinder may have contained a defect or flaw, or been damaged in a way that promoted failure, there was no evidence found to support such a finding. Nor was there any evidence found to suggest the cylinders from the subject production batch, or the type in general, were in any way predisposed to premature failure.\"</blockquote>\n\n==Repairs==\nRepairs to the aircraft were conducted in Manila by Boeing. It was ferried to [[Avalon Airport|Avalon]] on 10 November 2008. The original captain and first officer were part of the ferry crew. The only work that remained to be done at that point was replacement of the carpets and seat covers.

The Coalition armies of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Sweden]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]], led by Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] and [[Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg|Karl von Schwarzenberg]], decisively defeated the ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'' of [[Emperor of the French|French Emperor]] [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]]. Napoleon's army also contained [[Duchy of Warsaw|Polish]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italian]] troops, as well as Germans from the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] (mainly Saxony and W\u00fcrttemberg). The battle was the culmination of the [[German Campaign of 1813]] and involved 500,000 soldiers, 2,200 artillery pieces, the expenditure of 200,000 rounds of artillery ammunition, and 127,000 casualties, making it the largest battle in Europe prior to [[World War I]].\n\nDecisively defeated again, Napoleon was compelled to return to France while the Sixth Coalition kept up its momentum, dissolving the Confederation of the Rhine and invading France early the next year. Napoleon was forced to abdicate and was exiled to [[Principality of Elba|Elba]] in May 1814.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Emperor of the French|French Emperor]] [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]] attempted to militarily coerce Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]] into rejoining his unpopular [[Continental System]] by [[French invasion of Russia|invading Russia]] with around 685,000 troops, and eventually entered [[Moscow]] in late 1812, following the bloody, yet indecisive [[Battle of Borodino]]. However, Alexander refused to surrender even as the French occupied the city, which was set on fire by the time of its occupation.<ref>''With Napoleon in Russia, The Memoirs of General Coulaincourt,'' Chapter VI 'The Fire' pp. 109\u201307 Pub. William Morrow and Co 1945</ref> The campaign ended in complete disaster as Napoleon and his remaining forces retreated during the bitter Russian winter, with sickness, starvation, and the constant harrying of Russian [[Cossacks]] and partisans leaving the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' virtually destroyed by the time it returned from Russia. To make matters matters even worse for Napoleon, in June 1813, the combined armies of the Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom, Spain, under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], had decisively routed the French at the [[Battle of Vitoria]] in the [[Peninsular War]], and were now advancing towards the Pyrenees and into France itself. With this string of defeats, the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' was in retreat on all fronts across Europe.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=852}}\n\nAnti-French forces joined Russia as its troops pursued the remnants of the virtually destroyed ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' across Central Europe. The allies regrouped as the Sixth Coalition, comprising [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], and as well as smaller [[Confederation of the Rhine|German]] states whose citizens and leaders were no longer loyal to the French emperor.<ref>Philip Dwyer, ''Citizen Emperor: Napoleon in Power'' (2013), pp. 431\u201374</ref> Napoleon hurried back to France and managed to mobilize another large army, but severe economic hardship and news of defeats had led to [[war-weariness]] and growing unrest among France's population.<ref>Merriman, John (1996), \"A History Of Modern Europe\" W.W. Norton Company, p. 579.</ref>\n\nDespite opposition at home, Napoleon was able to rebuild his army, with the intention of either inducing a temporary alliance or at least cessation of hostilities, or knocking at least one of the Great Powers (Austria, Prussia, and Russia) out of the war. Napoleon sought to regain the offensive by [[German Campaign of 1813|re-establishing his hold]] in Germany, winning two hard-fought tactical victories, at [[Battle of L\u00fctzen (1813)|L\u00fctzen]] on 2 May and [[Battle of Bautzen|Bautzen]] on 20\u201321 May. These victories led to a [[Truce of Pl\u00e4switz|brief armistice]]. Napoleon then won a major victory at the [[Battle of Dresden]] on 27 August. Following this, the Coalition armies, under the individual commands of [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|Gebhard von Bl\u00fccher]], Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte (now [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Crown Prince Charles John of Sweden]]), [[Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg|Karl von Schwarzenberg]], and [[Levin August von Bennigsen|Count Benningsen]], followed a new strategy outlined in the [[Trachenberg Plan]]: they would avoid battle with Napoleon, and instead target only his marshals. This policy led to victories at [[Battle of Gro\u00dfbeeren|Gro\u00dfbeeren]], [[Battle of Kulm|Kulm]], [[Battle of the Katzbach|Katzbach]], and [[Battle of Dennewitz|Dennewitz]]. After these defeats, the French emperor could not easily follow up on his victory at Dresden. Thinly-stretched supply lines spanning into now somewhat hostile territory, coupled with [[Treaty of Ried|Bavaria's switching of sides]] to the Coalition just eight days prior to the battle, made it almost impossible to replace his army's losses of 150,000 men, 300 guns, and 50,000 sick.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=873}}\n\n==Prelude==\nWith the intention of knocking Prussia out of the war as soon as possible, Napoleon sent Marshal [[Nicolas Oudinot]] to take the Prussian capital of [[Berlin]] with an army of 60,000. Oudinot was defeated at the [[Battle of Gro\u00dfbeeren]], by the Prussians under von B\u00fclow of the Army of the North, just south of the city. With the intact Prussian force threatening from the north, Napoleon was compelled to withdraw westward. He crossed the [[Elbe]] with much of his army between late September and early October, and organized his forces around Leipzig, to protect his crucial supply lines and oppose the converging Coalition armies arrayed against him. He deployed his army around the city, but concentrated his force from Taucha through St\u00f6tteritz, where he placed his command. The Prussians advanced from Wartenburg, the Austrians and Russians from [[Dresden]] (which they had recently retaken, after the [[Battle of Kulm]]), and the Swedes from the north.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=917\u2013925}}\n\n==Opposing forces==\nThe French had around 160,000 soldiers along with 700 guns<ref name=autogenerated1/> plus 15,000 Poles, 10,000 Italians, and 40,000 Germans belonging to the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], totaling to 225,000 troops.<ref name=\"Chandler1020\"/> The Coalition had around 380,000 troops<ref name=\"Chandler1020\"/> along with 1,500 guns,<ref name=autogenerated1/> consisting of 145,000 Russians, 115,000 Austrians, 90,000 Prussians, and 30,000 Swedes. This made Leipzig the largest battle of the Napoleonic wars, surpassing [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]], [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]], [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena and Auerstedt]], [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]], and [[Battle of Dresden|Dresden]].<ref>Stone, David R. (2006) ''A Military History of Russia: From Ivan the Terrible to the War in Chechnya''. Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 107. {{ISBN|0275985024}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'', under the command of Napoleon, was in a weakened state. The majority of his troops now consisted of teenagers and inexperienced men conscripted shortly after the near destruction of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' in Russia. Napoleon conscripted these men to be readied for an [[German Campaign of 1813|even larger campaign]] against the newly formed Sixth Coalition and its forces stationed in Germany. While he won several preliminary battles, his army was being steadily depleted as the Allies, closely following the Trachenberg Plan, systematically defeated his marshals. The French Imperial cavalry was similarly insufficient, making it difficult for Napoleon to keep his eyes on his lines of communications or even scout enemy positions, a fact which influenced the outcome of the Battle of Gro\u00dfbeeren and others during the German campaign.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=901}}\n\nThe Coalition army was organized into four army-level commands: the Army of Bohemia under Karl von Schwarzenberg, the Army of Silesia under Bl\u00fccher, the Army of Poland under [[Levin August von Bennigsen]] and the combined Prussian, Russian, and Swedish Army of the North under Bernadotte. The Swedes also had under their command a company of the British [[O Battery (The Rocket Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|Rocket Brigade]] armed with [[Congreve rockets]], under the command of Captain [[Richard Bogue]].<ref>Bernadotte had asked for a British garrison for Straslund so as to liberate the more Swedish troops for service in Germany. He was sent six battalions under Major-General Gibbs, plus the Rocket Brigade. Only the 2/73rd took to the field under General Wallmoden and were present at the [[Battle of the Gohrde|Battle of Gohrde]]</ref>\n\n==Preparations==\n\n===French plans===\n[[File:Napoleon i Poniatowski Lipsk.jpg|thumb|Napoleon and Poniatowski at Leipzig, by [[January Suchodolski]]]]\n\nDespite being outnumbered, Napoleon planned to take the offensive between the [[Plei\u00dfe]] and the [[Parthe]] rivers. The position at Leipzig held several advantages for his army and his battle strategy. The rivers that converged there split the surrounding terrain into four separate sectors.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=924}} Holding Leipzig and its bridges, Napoleon could shift troops from one sector to another far more rapidly than the Allies could, who had difficulty moving such large numbers of troops into a single sector.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=924}}<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Digby Smith, \"1813: Leipzig \u2013 Napoleon and the Battle of the Nations\"</ref>\n\nThe northern front was defended by Marshals [[Michel Ney]] and [[Auguste de Marmont]], and the eastern front by Marshal [[Jacques MacDonald]]. The artillery reserve and parks, ambulances, and baggage stood near Leipzig, which Napoleon made his supply base for the battle. The bridges on the Pleisse and [[White Elster]] rivers were defended by infantry and a few guns. The main battery stood in reserve, and during battle was to be deployed on the Gallows Height. This battery was to be commanded by the artillery expert [[Antoine Drouot]]. The western flank of the French positions at Wachau and Liebertwolkwitz was defended by Prince [[J\u00f3zef Poniatowski]] and Marshal [[Pierre Augereau]] and his young French conscripts.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=923\u2013925}}\n\n===Coalition plans===\n{{Multiple image\n|direction=horizontal\n|align=left\n|image1=Alexander I of Russia by G.Dawe (1826, Peterhof) crop.jpg\n|width1=180\n|alt1=\n|caption1=<center>[[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], Emperor of Russia and supreme commander of the Coalition armies<center>\n|image2=Karel Filip Schwarzenberg.jpg\n|width2=190\n|alt2=\n|caption2=<center>[[Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg|Karl von Schwarzenberg]] of Austria, commander-in-chief of the Coalition armies<center>\n}}\n\nThe three monarchs of the Coalition powers were present in the field, with Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]] at the head of the three alongside King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] of Austria, and a substantial staff supported the Coalition commanders. Alexander was also the supreme commander of the Coalition forces in the eastern front of the war, while Prince Karl von Schwarzenberg of Austria was the commander-in-chief of all Coalition forces in the German theatre.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">(Esposito & Elting, \"Military History and Atlas of the Napoleonic wars.\"</ref> For the Russian emperor, this was the second time that he had filled in as a battlefield commander since [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] almost a decade earlier during the [[War of the Third Coalition]]. Initially, the command was plagued with incompetence and petty rivalries, and its operations were prone to the vanities of the monarchs, especially from the Russian emperor himself, but these largely evaporated as the battle raged on, with the command largely centering on the two main commanders during the battle.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=924}}\n\nThere was a drafting of the battle plan, with Marshals [[Pyotr Mikhailovich Volkonsky|Prince Volkonsky]] of Russia, [[Johan Christopher Toll]] of Sweden, [[Karl Friedrich von dem Knesebeck]] and [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst]] of Prussia taking part in the planning. After the first plan was drafted, Schwarzenberg submitted it to the monarchs. However, Alexander complained about his incompetence in terms of battle planning upon seeing the plan for himself. Upon learning of Schwarzenberg's main plan \u2014 to call for a secondary attack on the bridge between Leipzig and Lindenau to be led by Bl\u00fccher and [[Ign\u00e1c Gyulay|Gyulay]], and a main attack astride the Plei\u00dfe River to be led by General [[Maximilian, Count of Merveldt|Merveldt]], Hessen-Homburg and the Prussian Guard, he insisted that this was a disastrous tactic as it would not permit the Coalition armies to fully encircle and outflank that of Napoleon or at least decisively defeat and destroy his army. Alexander thought the plan would potentially allow Napoleon to break the Coalition battle line at one point and then concentrate his forces in the gap created and the weakened sectors. This would possibly give Napoleon a chance to regain the strategic initiative in Germany. Frederick William III attempted to opine to Alexander but could do nothing so he treated the discussion as if it was none of his concern. Later events in the battle proved the Russian emperor's judgments correct. The action he had ordered Bl\u00fccher to take met with great success north of Leipzig and the actions of the Russian Guard were decisive in halting the all-out French attack on Gulden Gossa in the south. On the other hand, the actions of the Austrians along the Pleisse River, part of Schwarzenberg's initial plan, ended in failure.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=924\u2013926}}\n\nHowever, not willing to plan the battle by himself as he had done during his disastrous defeat at Austerlitz almost a decade earlier, Alexander had Schwarzenberg draft another battle plan based on his thoughts and views. Schwarzenberg then drafted another plan that was largely designed to let everyone do as they pleased. The plan was as follows: Bl\u00fccher's axis of advance was to be shifted northward to the Halle road, the Russian and Prussian guards and the Russian heavy cavalry was to be amassed at Rotha in general reserve.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=925}} The Austrian grenadiers and cuirassiers would advance between the rivers. This strategy would ensure the encirclement of the French army in Leipzig and its vicinity, or at least inflict heavy losses upon them to assure the needed decisive results. Seemingly, though somewhat reluctantly, convinced, Alexander soon agreed to his plan, and he then ordered him to tell the other commanders to follow the plan.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Battle==\n\n===16 October===\n[[File:Woodville Richard Caton - Poniatowski's Last Charge at Leipzig 1912.jpg|thumb|''Poniatowski's Last Charge at Leipzig'', by [[Richard Caton Woodville, Jr.|Richard Caton Woodville]]]]\n\nThe Allied offensives achieved little and were soon forced back, but Napoleon's outnumbered forces were unable to break the Allied lines, resulting in a hard-fought stalemate.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=924\u2013932}}\n\n====Action at D\u00f6litz====\n[[File:Battle of Leipzig by Zauerweid.jpg|thumb|275px|Overview of the battlefield]]\nThe Austrian II Corps, commanded by Merveldt, advanced towards Connewitz via Gautzsch and attempted to attack the position. By the time Napoleon arrived on the battlefield along with the Young Guard and some Chasseurs, Merveldt found that the avenue of advance was well covered by the French battery and some skirmishers who had occupied the houses there and did not permit the Austrians to deploy their artillery in support of the attack. Merveldt himself in an unlucky turn was wounded and captured by the French after he went straight into the Saxon-Polish lines at the Plei\u00dfe River. Repulsed, the Austrians then moved to attack nearby D\u00f6litz, down a road crossed by two bridges and leading to a manor house and a mill. Two companies of the 24th Regiment ousted the small Polish garrison and took the position. A prompt counterattack by the Saxons and Poles ejected the Austrian troops and the battle seesawed until the Austrians brought up a strong artillery battery and blew the Poles out of the position. The Poles suffered heavy casualties during their furious defense and set fire to both the manor and the mill during their retreat.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.napolun.com/mirror/napoleonistyka.atspace.com/Leipzig_battle.htm  Battle of Leipzig 1813 : Battle of Nations : Napoleon : Schlacht : Bataille]</ref>\n\n====Action at Markkleeberg====\n[[File:Leipzig Battle.svg|thumb|300px|Actions as of October 16]]\nGeneral [[Friedrich Graf Kleist von Nollendorf|Kleist]], moving along the Plei\u00dfe, attacked Poniatowski and Marshal Augereau in the village of [[Markkleeberg]]. The Austrians repaired a bridge and took a school building and manor. The French counterattacked, throwing the Austrians out of the school and back over the river. French attacks on the manor only resulted in mounting casualties for the French and Poles. The Russian 14th Division began a series of flanking attacks that forced the Poles out of Markkleeberg. Poniatowski stopped the retreat and the advancing Russians. Catching four battalions of the Prussian 12th Brigade in the open, Poniatowski directed attacks by artillery and cavalry until they were relieved by Russian hussars. Poniatowski retook Markkleeberg, but was thrown out by two Prussian battalions.

Reissue: Demi-Solde Press, {{ISBN|1-891717-14-6}}.</ref>\n\n====Action at Liebertwolkwitz====\n[[File:Leontiy korennoj.jpg|thumb|left|French soldiers sparing the life of Russian soldier Leontiy Korennoy for his bravery]]\n[[Liebertwolkwitz]] was a large village in a commanding position, defended by Marshal MacDonald and General [[Jacques Lauriston|Lauriston]] with about 18,000 men. General [[Johann von Klenau|von Klenau]]'s Austrian IV Corps attacked with 24,500 men backed up by Pirth's 10th Brigade (4,550) and Ziethen's 11th Brigade (5,365). The Austrians attacked first, driving the French out of Liebertwolkwitz after hard fighting, only to be driven out in turn by a French counterattack. Russian General [[Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg (1788\u20131857)|W\u00fcrttemberg]] was notable for his extreme bravery directing his troops under fire. At this point, Napoleon ordered General [[Antoine Drouot|Drouot]] to form a grand battery of 150 guns on Gallows hill.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=928}} This was done and the guns blasted the exposed Russian II Corps, forcing the Prussian battalions supporting it to take cover.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=929}}\n\nThe hole had now been opened as Napoleon wished and at this point, Marshal Murat was unleashed with 10,000 French, Italian, and Saxon cavalry.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=929}} However, Murat's choice of massive columns for the attack formation was unfortunate for the French force, as smaller mobile formations of Russian, Prussian, and Austrian cavalry were able to successfully harass Murat's division, driving them back to their own artillery, where they were saved by the French Guard Dragoons. The Young Guard was sent in to drive out the allies and give Napoleon his breakthrough. They recaptured both Liebertwolkwitz and Wachau, but the allies countered with Russian Guard and Austrian grenadiers backed by Russian cuirassiers. The units lived up to their elite reputation, forming squares that blasted the French cavalrymen from their horses and overran the French artillery batteries. On the southern front, although Napoleon gained ground, he could not break the Allied lines.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n====Northern attack====\nThe northern front opened with the attack by General [[Louis Alexandre Andrault Langeron|Langeron's]] Russian corps on the villages of Gro\u00df-Wiederitzsch and Klein-Wiederitzsch in the centre of the French northern lines.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=931}} This position was defended by General [[Jan Henryk D\u0105browski|Dabrowski]]'s Polish division of four infantry battalions and two cavalry battalions. At first sign of the attack, the Polish division attacked. The battle wavered back and forth with attacks and counterattacks.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=931}} General Langeron rallied his forces and finally took both villages with heavy casualties.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=931}}\n\n====Action at M\u00f6ckern====\n[[File:Boutigny-Battle of Leipzig.jpg|thumb|200px|French infantry defending a barricade against a Prussian assault]]\nThe northern front was dominated by the Battle of M\u00f6ckern. This was a four phase battle and saw hard fighting from both sides. A manor, palace, walled gardens, and low walls dominated the village. Each position was turned into a fortress with the walls being loopholed for covered fire by the French. The ground to the west of the position was too wooded and swampy for emplacement of artillery. A dike ran east along the Elster River being four metres high. Marshal Marmont brought up infantry columns behind the positions in reserve and for a quick counter-attack against any fallen position. Bl\u00fccher commanded Langeron's Russian and [[Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Yorck]]'s Prussian corps against Marmont's VI Corps. When the battle hung in the balance, Marmont ordered a cavalry charge, but his commander refused to attack. Later, an attack by Prussian hussars caused serious losses to the French defenders. The battle lasted well into the night. Artillery caused the majority of the 9,000 Allied and 7,000 French casualties, and the French lost another 2,000 prisoners.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n====Action at Lindenau====\nIn the western front, the Austrian III Corps under General Giulay attacked the suburb of Lindenau and had success at first, forcing Marshal Ney to divert General [[Henri Gatien Bertrand|Bertrand]]'s IV Corps to hold the position.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=926\u2013928}} But soon the French held, the fighting later ground down into a stalemate, and the Austrians were driven back not far from the village.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=928}} However, for the French, there was also a negative strategic consequence for this minor success. IV Corps was needed by Napoleon for his attacks on the main Austro-Russian armies positioned at the south, and since they did not take part in the attack as they were that time engaging the Austrians in Lindenau, his attack failed.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=926}}\n\n===17 October===\nThere were only two actions on 17 October, one an attack by Russian General [[Fabian Wilhelm von Osten-Sacken|Sacken]] on General Dabrowski's Polish division at the village of Gohlis. In the end, the numbers and determination of the Russians prevailed and the Poles retreated to Pfaffendorf. Bl\u00fccher, who was made a field marshal the day before, ordered General Lanskoi's Russian 2nd Hussar Division to attack General [[Jean-Toussaint Arrighi de Casanova|Arrighi]]'s III Cavalry Corps. As they had the day before, the Allied cavalry proved to be superior, driving the French away with great losses.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=933}}\n\n====Arrival of reinforcements====\nThe French received only 14,000 troops as reinforcements. On the other hand, the Allies were strengthened by the arrival of 145,000 troops divided into two armies, one commanded by Bennigsen from the Army of Bohemia's first line and the other, the Army of the North which consisted mainly of Swedish troops, commanded by Bernadotte.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=933}}\n\n===18 October===\n\n====Napoleon's attempt to sue for an armistice====\nIt was soon evident that the Allies would encircle Napoleon and his army, and he knew that not retreating from the battle would mean capitulation for his entire army, which by this time were starting to run out of supplies and ammunition.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=933}} So Napoleon began to examine whether the roads and bridges of Lindenau could be used to withdraw his troops, or at the very least to secure a bridgehead crossing on the Plei\u00dfe River.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=933}} However, he was not yet in the mood for withdrawing as he thought to achieve one more great victory for France.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=932}} He also thought that a strong, formidable rear guard in Leipzig itself could repulse any Allied assault, which could buy him and his forces more time to withdraw from the battle.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=933}}\n\nDuring this time, Napoleon sent Merveldt, who had been captured two days earlier, back to the Allies on parole. Merveldt was given a letter to Alexander I, Francis I, and Frederick William III in which Napoleon offered to surrender to the Allies the fortresses he held along the Oder and Vistula, on the condition that the Allies allow him to withdraw to a position behind the Saale. He added that, if approved, they should sign an armistice and undertake peace negotiations. However, all three monarchs declined the offer.{{sfn|Nafziger|1996|p=191}}\n\n====Coalition armies encircle Napoleon====\n[[File:Leipzig Battle 2.svg|thumb|350px|Actions as of October 18]]\nThe Allies launched a huge assault from all sides, this time completely encircling Napoleon's army. In over nine hours of fighting, in which both sides suffered heavy casualties, only the resilience and bravery of the French troops prevented a breakthrough,{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} but they were slowly forced back towards Leipzig. The Allies had Bl\u00fccher and Bernadotte to the north, [[Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly|Barclay de Tolly]] and Bennigsen, and Prince [[Louis William, Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg|von Hesse-Homburg]] to the south, as well as Gyulay to the west.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=933}}\n\n====Actions at Wachau, L\u00f6ssnig (L\u00f6\u00dfnig), and D\u00f6litz====\nThe Prussian 9th Brigade occupied the abandoned village of Wachau while the Austrians, with General Bianchi's Hungarians, threw the French out of L\u00f6\u00dfnig. The Austrians proceeded to give a demonstration of combined arms cooperation as Austrian cavalry attacked French infantry to give the Austrian infantry time to arrive and deploy in the attack on D\u00f6litz, but the Young Guard threw them out. At this point, three Austrian grenadier battalions began to contest for the village with artillery support.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n====Action at Probstheida====\n[[File:A 19. magyar gyalogezred rohama a lipcsei csataban (1813).JPG|thumb|right|280px|Troops of the 19th Hungarian Regiment engaging French infantry]]\nThe bloodiest fighting of the battle occurred in Probstheida, a village just southeast of Leipzig. Here, about 60,000 soldiers under Barclay were marching and advancing towards the village in two columns, one under von Kleist advancing through Wachau, and one under General Wittgenstein advancing through Liebertwolkwitz. Barclay was pressured by the monarchs, especially Alexander I, to take the village since it was the key to the positions of Napoleon's troops, and although von Kleist opposed this, the monarchs' orders were paramount, so Barclay had to follow their orders anyway.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=933}}\n\nThe French dispositions at the village, however, were heavily fortified, thanks to the high and thick garden walls that gave excellent protection for the French infantry. The defense was also strengthened with artillery and strong infantry reserves behind the village. A day earlier, the Russians had taken most of the losses incurred during the battle, so it was the Prussians who took the initiative.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=933}}\n\nPrussian j\u00e4gers attempted to enter the village by storm but were quickly driven back. Then the artillery of both sides opened fire upon the village; despite the enormous amount of artillery that the Allies had brought with them, the more powerful French Imperial Guard artillery gradually gained the upper hand. The Prussians conducted a series of attacks against the French positions at the village, but because the French artillery repulsed each attack, their efforts were in vain. French cuirassiers, under Murat, charged upon the weakened Prussian lines and drove them back. Counter-charges by the numerous Russian cavalry saved the infantry by repeatedly driving back the French cavalry, albeit with heavy losses. The Prussians again conducted a charge upon French lines, but this charge was less successful than the first one.<ref>Smith, Digby George. 1813: Leipzig : Napoleon and the Battle of the Nations.</ref> The third assault was now conducted, this time, by the Russians, commanded by General [[Nikolay Raevsky|Raevsky]], the hero of [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]] who had arrived a few days earlier from Russia after a delay due to sickness. The assault on the village was somewhat more successful than the first two, taking the gardens and destroying several French infantry units, but it was eventually driven back by the French Imperial Guard, who had just arrived at the scene. Despite Schwarzenberg's request that Alexander send the Russian Guard, the Russian emperor ordered that more assaults were to be undertaken against the village. However, despite their successful, stubborn defense, the French were now in dire straits as they were dangerously short of manpower, and thus the fighting became only a hollow tactical victory for them.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=934}}\n\n====Actions at Paunsdorf and Sch\u00f6nefeld====\nDuring that morning, Bernadotte and Bl\u00fccher held a conference in Breitenfeld. It was agreed that Bernadotte's Army of the North would pass the Parthe River at Taucha with a reinforcement of 30,000 men drawn from Bl\u00fccher's Army of Silesia. Bl\u00fccher agreed to dispatch Langeron's army corps, and to renounce his rank and his rights as army commander, putting himself at the head of his Prussians.{{sfn|Nafziger|1996|p=215}} The advance of the Army of the North towards Leipzig had been slow, purportedly because Bernadotte had received word that Napoleon planned a renewed attack towards Berlin after his marshals' failure to take the city in the battles of [[Battle of Gro\u00dfbeeren|Gro\u00dfbeeren]] and [[Battle of Dennewitz|Dennewitz]].{{sfn|Nafziger|1996|p=216}}\n\n[[File:Baschkiren gegen Franzosen.jpg|thumb|French soldiers in skirmish with [[Bashkirs]] and [[Cossacks]]]]\nGeneral [[Matvei Platov|Platov]]'s Russian heavy artillery began to fire on the Saxons around Paunsdorf. Langeron placed pontoon bridges over the Parthe River and a flying bridge via Mockau. Large masses of troops had now moved to the east bank of the river. Meanwhile, Russian and Austrian forces began attacking French and Saxon positions in Paunsdorf, but after counterattacks by French infantry and deadly canister shots from Franco-Saxon batteries, were driven back. After being driven back, the Allied troops were pursued by French infantry before being counterattacked by Austrian hussar and grenzer cavalries, in turn driving the French back. The town itself was still held by five Franco-Saxon battalions. Captain Bogue of the British Rocket Brigade, advanced with his unit and began firing Congreve rockets into the town, causing the defenders to fall back in disorder. Bogue, seizing the moment, charged at the head of his escort squadron of cavalry. This small force was in turn being driven out of the village when a barrage of rockets fired in close support<ref name=\":0\" /> again caused the French troops to break ranks.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Rockets and Missiles: The Life Story of a Technology|last = Van Riper|first = A.

Allied troops repeatedly assaulted French positions there, but were forced back. French infantry attacks on Allied positions produced similar results. Repeated assaults by Russian musketeers and grenadiers under Langeron finally drove the French out of Sch\u00f6nefeld. The heavy fighting in Paunsdorf and Sch\u00f6nefeld set both villages on fire.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=934}}\n\n====Sweden fully participates====\nIn the meantime, at the behest of his officers, who felt embarrassed that they had not participated in the battle, Bernadotte gave the order for his light infantry to participate in the final assault on Leipzig itself. The Swedish j\u00e4gers performed very well, losing only about 121 men in the attack.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=934}}\n\n====Action at Lindenau====\nOn the western front, the French IV Corps under Bertrand finally drove the Austrian III Corps under Gyulay away from Lindenau.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=934}} This broke the encirclement which the Allied forces earlier had made against the ''Grande Armee'', clearing the way for its retreat which would take place later the next day.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=934}}\n\n====Pro-Napoleonic Germans defect to the Coalition====\nDuring the fighting, 5,400 Saxons of General [[Jean Reynier|Reynier]]'s VII Corps defected to the Coalition, specifically Bernadotte's Army of the North due to the esteem the Saxons had for the former French marshal. Four years prior, Bernadotte, while still a Marshal of the Empire, had commanded the wholly Saxon IX Corps during the [[Battle of Wagram]] where his mild and courteous behavior toward them in the weeks prior, along with a controversial Order of the Day praising their courage after the battle, greatly endeared Bernadotte to them.<ref>Barton, D. Plunket (1921) Pp. 223-229</ref>{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=934}} At first, French officers saw the Saxons' rushing towards the advancing Prussians as a charge, but treachery became evident as they saw the Saxons asking the Prussians to join with them for the impending assault. Reynier himself witnessed this, and he rallied the remaining Saxons at his disposal, but to no avail, because W\u00fcrttemberg's cavalry also deserted from the French, forcing the French line in Paunsdorf to fall back.<ref>Howard Giles, unknown book and date of publishing</ref>\n\n====The ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' begins to retreat====\nThe battle during the day of 18 October was one of [[attrition warfare|attrition]]. French troops held on to their respective positions, but were steadily being worn out and depleted by fierce and intensifying Allied attacks throughout the day. The French artillery had only 20,000 rounds left.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=936}} Later that night, Napoleon was treating the battle as a lost cause.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=935}} At this time, he promoted Poniatowski to the rank of ''[[Marshal of the Empire|Mar\u00e9chal d'Empire]]'', the only foreigner of all his marshals who was given this title, and the latter swore that he would fight to the last stand, which he did.<ref>Bowden \u2013 \"Napoleon's Grande Armee of 1813\" 1990, p. 191</ref> After this, the emperor began to stage the retreat for the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' westward across the Elster River.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=935}}\n\nDuring the night the French army had been ordered to withdraw silently from Connewitz, Probstheida, Stotteritz, Volkmansdorf, and Reudnitz, all to cross the river via Leipzig and the single bridge in the river. Those in Lindenau were to move to Weissenfels. Weak rear guards occupied the villages in order to conceal the retreat, and support troops were placed in the outer suburbs by the wind mills and near the walls of the city. The garden and cemetery walls by the Grimma Gate were pierced with loopholes as well as the gates themselves. Skirmishers were posted in the farm houses, in the brush, in the parks, and everywhere possible. Leipzig was to be occupied by Reynier's VII Corps, Poniatowski's VIII Corps and MacDonald's XI Corps.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=935}} They were ordered to hold it for a day or a bit longer, in order to allow the rest of the army, its artillery, and its equipment sufficient time to evacuate. The Allied cavalry advance posts were ordered to attack without relief the French advanced posts during the night to determine whether or not the French were attempting to withdraw. However, they failed to realize that the French were, in fact, pulling out from the battle area. Therefore, the evacuation continued throughout the night.{{sfn|Nafziger|1996|pp=233\u2013234}}\n\n===19 October===\n[[File:Napoleon.Leipzig.jpg|thumb|Napoleon's retreat on 19 October 1813, showing the explosion of the bridge]]\nThe Allies had only learned of the French evacuation at 7:00 on the morning of the 19 October.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=935}} Soon thereafter between 8:00\u20139:00 am they launched a full-scale assault from the north, south, and east against the retreating French. But they were held up in Leipzig because of a ferocious street-to-street rearguard action fought by Marshal Oudinot's 30,000 troops.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=935}} As the Russians and Prussians entered the city through the Halle and Grimma gates they fell upon barricades and houses full of French soldiers. Civilians were forced into hiding as the bloody [[urban warfare|urban combat]] raged throughout the city.<ref>Digby Smith \u2013 \"1813: Leipzig \u2013 Napoleon and the Battle of the Nations\", p. 256</ref>\n\nNapoleon's retreat continued smoothly until early afternoon when General Dulauloy, tasked with destroying the only bridge over the Elster, delegated the task to Colonel Montfort.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=935}} The colonel then passed this responsibility to a corporal, who was unaware of the carefully planned time schedule.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=935}} The corporal ignited the fuses at 1:00 in the afternoon while the bridge was still crowded with retreating French troops and Oudinot's rearguard was still in Leipzig.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=935}} The explosion and subsequent panic caused a rout that resulted in the deaths of thousands of French troops and the capture of 30,000 others.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=935\u2013936}} Both Oudinot and MacDonald managed to swim their way across but Poniatowski, hampered by his wounds, was one of the many who drowned while attempting to cross the river.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=936}}\n\n==Conclusion==\n[[File:1839 Krafft Siegesmeldung nach der Schlacht bei Leipzig 1813 anagoria.JPG|thumb|Alexander I of Russia, Francis I of Austria, and Frederick William III of Prussia meeting after the battle]]\nBy the end of the battle on the afternoon of 19 October, the remnants of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' had crossed the Elster River and begun a well-ordered retreat. The battle had ended conclusively and decisively with the nations of the Coalition as the victors, and the German Campaign was a complete failure for the French, although they achieved a minor victory when the Bavarian Army attempted to block the retreat of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' at [[Battle of Hanau|Hanau]]. The heavy casualties the Coalition armies had incurred and their exhaustion from the bloody 4-day battle they fought made it impossible for them to promptly pursue the retreating ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''. The French were also exhausted after the battle, and were themselves retreating at a fast pace towards the Rhine.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=937}}\n\n==Casualties==\nThe Battle of Leipzig was the bloodiest of the Napoleonic Wars, with over 200,000 rounds of artillery ammunition having been expended.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=936}} Casualties on both sides were astoundingly high, such that locals had a hard time disposing of the corpses, and corpses were still visible the next year. Estimates range from 80,000 to 110,000 total killed, wounded, or missing. Napoleon lost about 38,000 killed and wounded.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=936}} The Allies captured 15,000 able-bodied Frenchmen, 21,000 wounded or sick, 325 guns {{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=936}}, 28 eagles, standards, or colours, and most of the French supply trains. Six French generals were killed, 12 wounded, and 36 captured including Lauriston and Reynier{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=936}}\n\nOut of a total force of 360,000, the Allies suffered approximately 54,000 casualties.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=936}} Schwarzenberg's Army of Bohemia lost 34,000, Bl\u00fccher's Army of Silesia lost 12,000, while Bernadotte's Army of the North and Bennigsen's Army of Poland lost about 4,000 each.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=936}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{quote|A year ago all Europe marched with us; today all Europe marches against us.|Napoleon<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">J. T. Headley, ''The Imperial Guard of Napoleon''</ref> }}\n\nThe battle ended the French Empire's presence east of the Rhine and brought secondary German states (e.g. Baden, Saxony, and W\u00fcrttemberg) over to the Coalition with the largest German states of Austria and Prussia. It also dealt a harsh blow to Napoleon himself, who was decisively defeated in battle for the first time in the Napoleonic Wars (although he had suffered a smaller defeat in 1809 at the [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]]), severely damaging his reputation as a military genius. Alexander I now urged all of his subordinate commanders including those of Austria, Prussia, and other nations to push the gigantic Coalition army on the offensive after the battle, and, having decisively won the battle, was more than ever determined to carry the war onto French soil.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=947}}\n\nThree weeks after Leipzig, Napoleon arrived at [[Saint-Cloud]] to organize the defense of France.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=945}} The time he went back to Paris at the year's end, his first words on entering the [[Senat conservateur|Senate]], after his return from the battle disaster, sad and low in mood, were, \"A year ago all Europe marched with us; today all Europe marches against us.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Half a million troops had been lost in the German Campaign of 1813.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=945}}\n\nWith the Confederation of the Rhine dissolved and Prussia once again becoming one of the continent's great powers after its [[War of the Fourth Coalition|severe setbacks]] in 1806,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> the Coalition armies pressed the advantage and invaded France in early 1814.

The Coalition armies of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Sweden]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]], led by Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] and [[Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg|Karl von Schwarzenberg]], decisively defeated the ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'' of [[Emperor of the French|French Emperor]] [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]]. Napoleon's army also contained [[Duchy of Warsaw|Polish]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Italian]] troops, as well as Germans from the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] (mainly Saxony and W\u00fcrttemberg). The battle was the culmination of the [[German Campaign of 1813]] and involved 500,000 soldiers, 2,200 artillery pieces, the expenditure of 200,000 rounds of artillery ammunition, and 127,000 casualties, making it the largest battle in Europe prior to [[World War I]].\n\nDecisively defeated again, Napoleon was compelled to return to France while the Sixth Coalition kept up its momentum, dissolving the Confederation of the Rhine and invading France early the next year. Napoleon was forced to abdicate and was exiled to [[Principality of Elba|Elba]] in May 1814.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Emperor of the French|French Emperor]] [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]] attempted to militarily coerce Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]] into rejoining his unpopular [[Continental System]] by [[French invasion of Russia|invading Russia]] with around 685,000 troops, and eventually entered [[Moscow]] in late 1812, following the bloody, yet indecisive [[Battle of Borodino]]. However, Alexander refused to surrender even as the French occupied the city, which was set on fire by the time of its occupation.<ref>''With Napoleon in Russia, The Memoirs of General Coulaincourt,'' Chapter VI 'The Fire' pp. 109\u201307 Pub. William Morrow and Co 1945</ref> The campaign ended in complete disaster as Napoleon and his remaining forces retreated during the bitter Russian winter, with sickness, starvation, and the constant harrying of Russian [[Cossacks]] and partisans leaving the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' virtually destroyed by the time it returned from Russia. To make matters matters even worse for Napoleon, in June 1813, the combined armies of the Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom, Spain, under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], had decisively routed the French at the [[Battle of Vitoria]] in the [[Peninsular War]], and were now advancing towards the Pyrenees and into France itself. With this string of defeats, the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' was in retreat on all fronts across Europe.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=852}}\n\nAnti-French forces joined Russia as its troops pursued the remnants of the virtually destroyed ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' across Central Europe. The allies regrouped as the Sixth Coalition, comprising [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], and as well as smaller [[Confederation of the Rhine|German]] states whose citizens and leaders were no longer loyal to the French emperor.<ref>Philip Dwyer, ''Citizen Emperor: Napoleon in Power'' (2013), pp. 431\u201374</ref> Napoleon hurried back to France and managed to mobilize another large army, but severe economic hardship and news of defeats had led to [[war-weariness]] and growing unrest among France's population.<ref>Merriman, John (1996), \"A History Of Modern Europe\" W.W. Norton Company, p. 579.</ref>\n\nDespite opposition at home, Napoleon was able to rebuild his army, with the intention of either inducing a temporary alliance or at least cessation of hostilities, or knocking at least one of the Great Powers (Austria, Prussia, and Russia) out of the war. Napoleon sought to regain the offensive by [[German Campaign of 1813|re-establishing his hold]] in Germany, winning two hard-fought tactical victories, at [[Battle of L\u00fctzen (1813)|L\u00fctzen]] on 2 May and [[Battle of Bautzen|Bautzen]] on 20\u201321 May. These victories led to a [[Truce of Pl\u00e4switz|brief armistice]]. Napoleon then won a major victory at the [[Battle of Dresden]] on 27 August. Following this, the Coalition armies, under the individual commands of [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|Gebhard von Bl\u00fccher]], Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte (now [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Crown Prince Charles John of Sweden]]), [[Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg|Karl von Schwarzenberg]], and [[Levin August von Bennigsen|Count Benningsen]], followed a new strategy outlined in the [[Trachenberg Plan]]: they would avoid battle with Napoleon, and instead target only his marshals. This policy led to victories at [[Battle of Gro\u00dfbeeren|Gro\u00dfbeeren]], [[Battle of Kulm|Kulm]], [[Battle of the Katzbach|Katzbach]], and [[Battle of Dennewitz|Dennewitz]]. After these defeats, the French emperor could not easily follow up on his victory at Dresden. Thinly-stretched supply lines spanning into now somewhat hostile territory, coupled with [[Treaty of Ried|Bavaria's switching of sides]] to the Coalition just eight days prior to the battle, made it almost impossible to replace his army's losses of 150,000 men, 300 guns, and 50,000 sick.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=873}}\n\n==Prelude==\nWith the intention of knocking Prussia out of the war as soon as possible, Napoleon sent Marshal [[Nicolas Oudinot]] to take the Prussian capital of [[Berlin]] with an army of 60,000. Oudinot was defeated at the [[Battle of Gro\u00dfbeeren]], by the Prussians under von B\u00fclow of the Army of the North, just south of the city. With the intact Prussian force threatening from the north, Napoleon was compelled to withdraw westward. He crossed the [[Elbe]] with much of his army between late September and early October, and organized his forces around Leipzig, to protect his crucial supply lines and oppose the converging Coalition armies arrayed against him. He deployed his army around the city, but concentrated his force from Taucha through St\u00f6tteritz, where he placed his command. The Prussians advanced from Wartenburg, the Austrians and Russians from [[Dresden]] (which they had recently retaken, after the [[Battle of Kulm]]), and the Swedes from the north.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=917\u2013925}}\n\n==Opposing forces==\nThe French had around 160,000 soldiers along with 700 guns<ref name=autogenerated1/> plus 15,000 Poles, 10,000 Italians, and 40,000 Germans belonging to the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], totaling to 225,000 troops.<ref name=\"Chandler1020\"/> The Coalition had around 380,000 troops<ref name=\"Chandler1020\"/> along with 1,500 guns,<ref name=autogenerated1/> consisting of 145,000 Russians, 115,000 Austrians, 90,000 Prussians, and 30,000 Swedes. This made Leipzig the largest battle of the Napoleonic wars, surpassing [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]], [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]], [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|Jena and Auerstedt]], [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]], and [[Battle of Dresden|Dresden]].<ref>Stone, David R. (2006) ''A Military History of Russia: From Ivan the Terrible to the War in Chechnya''. Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 107. {{ISBN|0275985024}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'', under the command of Napoleon, was in a weakened state. The majority of his troops now consisted of teenagers and inexperienced men conscripted shortly after the near destruction of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' in Russia. Napoleon conscripted these men to be readied for an [[German Campaign of 1813|even larger campaign]] against the newly formed Sixth Coalition and its forces stationed in Germany. While he won several preliminary battles, his army was being steadily depleted as the Allies, closely following the Trachenberg Plan, systematically defeated his marshals. The French Imperial cavalry was similarly insufficient, making it difficult for Napoleon to keep his eyes on his lines of communications or even scout enemy positions, a fact which influenced the outcome of the Battle of Gro\u00dfbeeren and others during the German campaign.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=901}}\n\nThe Coalition army was organized into four army-level commands: the Army of Bohemia under Karl von Schwarzenberg, the Army of Silesia under Bl\u00fccher, the Army of Poland under [[Levin August von Bennigsen]] and the combined Prussian, Russian, and Swedish Army of the North under Bernadotte. The Swedes also had under their command a company of the British [[O Battery (The Rocket Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|Rocket Brigade]] armed with [[Congreve rockets]], under the command of Captain [[Richard Bogue]].<ref>Bernadotte had asked for a British garrison for Straslund so as to liberate the more Swedish troops for service in Germany. He was sent six battalions under Major-General Gibbs, plus the Rocket Brigade. Only the 2/73rd took to the field under General Wallmoden and were present at the [[Battle of the Gohrde|Battle of Gohrde]]</ref>\n\n==Preparations==\n\n===French plans===\n[[File:Napoleon i Poniatowski Lipsk.jpg|thumb|Napoleon and Poniatowski at Leipzig, by [[January Suchodolski]]]]\n\nDespite being outnumbered, Napoleon planned to take the offensive between the [[Plei\u00dfe]] and the [[Parthe]] rivers. The position at Leipzig held several advantages for his army and his battle strategy. The rivers that converged there split the surrounding terrain into four separate sectors.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=924}} Holding Leipzig and its bridges, Napoleon could shift troops from one sector to another far more rapidly than the Allies could, who had difficulty moving such large numbers of troops into a single sector.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=924}}<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Digby Smith, \"1813: Leipzig \u2013 Napoleon and the Battle of the Nations\"</ref>\n\nThe northern front was defended by Marshals [[Michel Ney]] and [[Auguste de Marmont]], and the eastern front by Marshal [[Jacques MacDonald]]. The artillery reserve and parks, ambulances, and baggage stood near Leipzig, which Napoleon made his supply base for the battle. The bridges on the Pleisse and [[White Elster]] rivers were defended by infantry and a few guns. The main battery stood in reserve, and during battle was to be deployed on the Gallows Height. This battery was to be commanded by the artillery expert [[Antoine Drouot]]. The western flank of the French positions at Wachau and Liebertwolkwitz was defended by Prince [[J\u00f3zef Poniatowski]] and Marshal [[Pierre Augereau]] and his young French conscripts.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=923\u2013925}}\n\n===Coalition plans===\n{{Multiple image\n|direction=horizontal\n|align=left\n|image1=Alexander I of Russia by G.Dawe (1826, Peterhof) crop.jpg\n|width1=180\n|alt1=\n|caption1=<center>[[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], Emperor of Russia and supreme commander of the Coalition armies<center>\n|image2=Karel Filip Schwarzenberg.jpg\n|width2=180\n|alt2=\n|caption2=<center>[[Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg|Karl von Schwarzenberg]] of Austria, commander-in-chief of the Coalition armies<center>\n}}\n\nThe three monarchs of the Coalition powers were present in the field, with Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]] at the head of the three alongside King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] of Austria, and a substantial staff supported the Coalition commanders. Alexander was also the supreme commander of the Coalition forces in the eastern front of the war, while Prince Karl von Schwarzenberg of Austria was the commander-in-chief of all Coalition forces in the German theatre.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">(Esposito & Elting, \"Military History and Atlas of the Napoleonic wars.\"</ref> For the Russian emperor, this was the second time that he had filled in as a battlefield commander since [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] almost a decade earlier during the [[War of the Third Coalition]]. Initially, the command was plagued with incompetence and petty rivalries, and its operations were prone to the vanities of the monarchs, especially from the Russian emperor himself, but these largely evaporated as the battle raged on, with the command largely centering on the two main commanders during the battle.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=924}}\n\nThere was a drafting of the battle plan, with Marshals [[Pyotr Mikhailovich Volkonsky|Prince Volkonsky]] of Russia, [[Johan Christopher Toll]] of Sweden, [[Karl Friedrich von dem Knesebeck]] and [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst]] of Prussia taking part in the planning. After the first plan was drafted, Schwarzenberg submitted it to the monarchs. However, Alexander complained about his incompetence in terms of battle planning upon seeing the plan for himself. Upon learning of Schwarzenberg's main plan \u2014 to call for a secondary attack on the bridge between Leipzig and Lindenau to be led by Bl\u00fccher and [[Ign\u00e1c Gyulay|Gyulay]], and a main attack astride the Plei\u00dfe River to be led by General [[Maximilian, Count of Merveldt|Merveldt]], Hessen-Homburg and the Prussian Guard, he insisted that this was a disastrous tactic as it would not permit the Coalition armies to fully encircle and outflank that of Napoleon or at least decisively defeat and destroy his army. Alexander thought the plan would potentially allow Napoleon to break the Coalition battle line at one point and then concentrate his forces in the gap created and the weakened sectors. This would possibly give Napoleon a chance to regain the strategic initiative in Germany. Frederick William III attempted to opine to Alexander but could do nothing so he treated the discussion as if it was none of his concern. Later events in the battle proved the Russian emperor's judgments correct. The action he had ordered Bl\u00fccher to take met with great success north of Leipzig and the actions of the Russian Guard were decisive in halting the all-out French attack on Gulden Gossa in the south. On the other hand, the actions of the Austrians along the Pleisse River, part of Schwarzenberg's initial plan, ended in failure.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=924\u2013926}}\n\nHowever, not willing to plan the battle by himself as he had done during his disastrous defeat at Austerlitz almost a decade earlier, Alexander had Schwarzenberg draft another battle plan based on his thoughts and views. Schwarzenberg then drafted another plan that was largely designed to let everyone do as they pleased. The plan was as follows: Bl\u00fccher's axis of advance was to be shifted northward to the Halle road, the Russian and Prussian guards and the Russian heavy cavalry was to be amassed at Rotha in general reserve.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=925}} The Austrian grenadiers and cuirassiers would advance between the rivers. This strategy would ensure the encirclement of the French army in Leipzig and its vicinity, or at least inflict heavy losses upon them to assure the needed decisive results. Seemingly, though somewhat reluctantly, convinced, Alexander soon agreed to his plan, and he then ordered him to tell the other commanders to follow the plan.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Battle==\n\n===16 October===\n[[File:Woodville Richard Caton - Poniatowski's Last Charge at Leipzig 1912.jpg|thumb|''Poniatowski's Last Charge at Leipzig'', by [[Richard Caton Woodville, Jr.|Richard Caton Woodville]]]]\n\nThe Allied offensives achieved little and were soon forced back, but Napoleon's outnumbered forces were unable to break the Allied lines, resulting in a hard-fought stalemate.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=924\u2013932}}\n\n====Action at D\u00f6litz====\n[[File:Battle of Leipzig by Zauerweid.jpg|thumb|275px|Overview of the battlefield]]\nThe Austrian II Corps, commanded by Merveldt, advanced towards Connewitz via Gautzsch and attempted to attack the position. By the time Napoleon arrived on the battlefield along with the Young Guard and some Chasseurs, Merveldt found that the avenue of advance was well covered by the French battery and some skirmishers who had occupied the houses there and did not permit the Austrians to deploy their artillery in support of the attack. Merveldt himself in an unlucky turn was wounded and captured by the French after he went straight into the Saxon-Polish lines at the Plei\u00dfe River. Repulsed, the Austrians then moved to attack nearby D\u00f6litz, down a road crossed by two bridges and leading to a manor house and a mill. Two companies of the 24th Regiment ousted the small Polish garrison and took the position. A prompt counterattack by the Saxons and Poles ejected the Austrian troops and the battle seesawed until the Austrians brought up a strong artillery battery and blew the Poles out of the position. The Poles suffered heavy casualties during their furious defense and set fire to both the manor and the mill during their retreat.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.napolun.com/mirror/napoleonistyka.atspace.com/Leipzig_battle.htm  Battle of Leipzig 1813 : Battle of Nations : Napoleon : Schlacht : Bataille]</ref>\n\n====Action at Markkleeberg====\n[[File:Leipzig Battle.svg|thumb|300px|Actions as of October 16]]\nGeneral [[Friedrich Graf Kleist von Nollendorf|Kleist]], moving along the Plei\u00dfe, attacked Poniatowski and Marshal Augereau in the village of [[Markkleeberg]]. The Austrians repaired a bridge and took a school building and manor. The French counterattacked, throwing the Austrians out of the school and back over the river. French attacks on the manor only resulted in mounting casualties for the French and Poles. The Russian 14th Division began a series of flanking attacks that forced the Poles out of Markkleeberg. Poniatowski stopped the retreat and the advancing Russians. Catching four battalions of the Prussian 12th Brigade in the open, Poniatowski directed attacks by artillery and cavalry until they were relieved by Russian hussars. Poniatowski retook Markkleeberg, but was thrown out by two Prussian battalions. Austrian grenadiers then formed in front of Markkleeberg and drove the Poles and French out of the area with a flank attack.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n====Action at Wachau====<!-- This section heading is used in the redirect Battle of Wachau-->\nThe Russian II Corps attacked [[Markkleeberg|Wachau]] near Leipzig with support from the Prussian 9th Brigade. The Russians advanced, unaware that French forces were waiting. The French took them by surprise on the flank, mauling them. The Prussians entered Wachau, engaging in street-to-street fighting. French artillery blasted the Prussians out of Wachau and the French recovered the village.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=927}}<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref>[[William Cathcart, 1st Earl Cathcart|William Cathcart]] (first edition 1850) ''[https://archive.org/details/commentariesonw00cathgoog Commentaries on the War in Russia and Germany in 1812 and 1813]'', London: J.

General [[Johann von Klenau|von Klenau]]'s Austrian IV Corps attacked with 24,500 men backed up by Pirth's 10th Brigade (4,550) and Ziethen's 11th Brigade (5,365). The Austrians attacked first, driving the French out of Liebertwolkwitz after hard fighting, only to be driven out in turn by a French counterattack. Russian General [[Duke Eugen of W\u00fcrttemberg (1788\u20131857)|W\u00fcrttemberg]] was notable for his extreme bravery directing his troops under fire. At this point, Napoleon ordered General [[Antoine Drouot|Drouot]] to form a grand battery of 150 guns on Gallows hill.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=928}} This was done and the guns blasted the exposed Russian II Corps, forcing the Prussian battalions supporting it to take cover.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=929}}\n\nThe hole had now been opened as Napoleon wished and at this point, Marshal Murat was unleashed with 10,000 French, Italian, and Saxon cavalry.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=929}} However, Murat's choice of massive columns for the attack formation was unfortunate for the French force, as smaller mobile formations of Russian, Prussian, and Austrian cavalry were able to successfully harass Murat's division, driving them back to their own artillery, where they were saved by the French Guard Dragoons. The Young Guard was sent in to drive out the allies and give Napoleon his breakthrough. They recaptured both Liebertwolkwitz and Wachau, but the allies countered with Russian Guard and Austrian grenadiers backed by Russian cuirassiers. The units lived up to their elite reputation, forming squares that blasted the French cavalrymen from their horses and overran the French artillery batteries. On the southern front, although Napoleon gained ground, he could not break the Allied lines.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n====Northern attack====\nThe northern front opened with the attack by General [[Louis Alexandre Andrault Langeron|Langeron's]] Russian corps on the villages of Gro\u00df-Wiederitzsch and Klein-Wiederitzsch in the centre of the French northern lines.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=931}} This position was defended by General [[Jan Henryk D\u0105browski|Dabrowski]]'s Polish division of four infantry battalions and two cavalry battalions. At first sign of the attack, the Polish division attacked. The battle wavered back and forth with attacks and counterattacks.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=931}} General Langeron rallied his forces and finally took both villages with heavy casualties.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=931}}\n\n====Action at M\u00f6ckern====\n[[File:Boutigny-Battle of Leipzig.jpg|thumb|200px|French infantry defending a barricade against a Prussian assault]]\nThe northern front was dominated by the Battle of M\u00f6ckern. This was a four phase battle and saw hard fighting from both sides. A manor, palace, walled gardens, and low walls dominated the village. Each position was turned into a fortress with the walls being loopholed for covered fire by the French. The ground to the west of the position was too wooded and swampy for emplacement of artillery. A dike ran east along the Elster River being four metres high. Marshal Marmont brought up infantry columns behind the positions in reserve and for a quick counter-attack against any fallen position. Bl\u00fccher commanded Langeron's Russian and [[Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg|Yorck]]'s Prussian corps against Marmont's VI Corps. When the battle hung in the balance, Marmont ordered a cavalry charge, but his commander refused to attack. Later, an attack by Prussian hussars caused serious losses to the French defenders. The battle lasted well into the night. Artillery caused the majority of the 9,000 Allied and 7,000 French casualties, and the French lost another 2,000 prisoners.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n====Action at Lindenau====\nIn the western front, the Austrian III Corps under General Giulay attacked the suburb of Lindenau and had success at first, forcing Marshal Ney to divert General [[Henri Gatien Bertrand|Bertrand]]'s IV Corps to hold the position.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=926\u2013928}} But soon the French held, the fighting later ground down into a stalemate, and the Austrians were driven back not far from the village.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=928}} However, for the French, there was also a negative strategic consequence for this minor success. IV Corps was needed by Napoleon for his attacks on the main Austro-Russian armies positioned at the south, and since they did not take part in the attack as they were that time engaging the Austrians in Lindenau, his attack failed.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=926}}\n\n===17 October===\nThere were only two actions on 17 October, one an attack by Russian General [[Fabian Wilhelm von Osten-Sacken|Sacken]] on General Dabrowski's Polish division at the village of Gohlis. In the end, the numbers and determination of the Russians prevailed and the Poles retreated to Pfaffendorf. Bl\u00fccher, who was made a field marshal the day before, ordered General Lanskoi's Russian 2nd Hussar Division to attack General [[Jean-Toussaint Arrighi de Casanova|Arrighi]]'s III Cavalry Corps. As they had the day before, the Allied cavalry proved to be superior, driving the French away with great losses.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=933}}\n\n====Arrival of reinforcements====\nThe French received only 14,000 troops as reinforcements. On the other hand, the Allies were strengthened by the arrival of 145,000 troops divided into two armies, one commanded by Bennigsen from the Army of Bohemia's first line and the other, the Army of the North which consisted mainly of Swedish troops, commanded by Bernadotte.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=933}}\n\n===18 October===\n\n====Napoleon's attempt to sue for an armistice====\nIt was soon evident that the Allies would encircle Napoleon and his army, and he knew that not retreating from the battle would mean capitulation for his entire army, which by this time were starting to run out of supplies and ammunition.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=933}} So Napoleon began to examine whether the roads and bridges of Lindenau could be used to withdraw his troops, or at the very least to secure a bridgehead crossing on the Plei\u00dfe River.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=933}} However, he was not yet in the mood for withdrawing as he thought to achieve one more great victory for France.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=932}} He also thought that a strong, formidable rear guard in Leipzig itself could repulse any Allied assault, which could buy him and his forces more time to withdraw from the battle.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=933}}\n\nDuring this time, Napoleon sent Merveldt, who had been captured two days earlier, back to the Allies on parole. Merveldt was given a letter to Alexander I, Francis I, and Frederick William III in which Napoleon offered to surrender to the Allies the fortresses he held along the Oder and Vistula, on the condition that the Allies allow him to withdraw to a position behind the Saale. He added that, if approved, they should sign an armistice and undertake peace negotiations. However, all three monarchs declined the offer.{{sfn|Nafziger|1996|p=191}}\n\n====Coalition armies encircle Napoleon====\n[[File:Leipzig Battle 2.svg|thumb|350px|Actions as of October 18]]\nThe Allies launched a huge assault from all sides, this time completely encircling Napoleon's army. In over nine hours of fighting, in which both sides suffered heavy casualties, only the resilience and bravery of the French troops prevented a breakthrough,{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} but they were slowly forced back towards Leipzig. The Allies had Bl\u00fccher and Bernadotte to the north, [[Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly|Barclay de Tolly]] and Bennigsen, and Prince [[Louis William, Landgrave of Hesse-Homburg|von Hesse-Homburg]] to the south, as well as Gyulay to the west.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=933}}\n\n====Actions at Wachau, L\u00f6ssnig (L\u00f6\u00dfnig), and D\u00f6litz====\nThe Prussian 9th Brigade occupied the abandoned village of Wachau while the Austrians, with General Bianchi's Hungarians, threw the French out of L\u00f6\u00dfnig. The Austrians proceeded to give a demonstration of combined arms cooperation as Austrian cavalry attacked French infantry to give the Austrian infantry time to arrive and deploy in the attack on D\u00f6litz, but the Young Guard threw them out. At this point, three Austrian grenadier battalions began to contest for the village with artillery support.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n====Action at Probstheida====\n[[File:A 19. magyar gyalogezred rohama a lipcsei csataban (1813).JPG|thumb|right|280px|Troops of the 19th Hungarian Regiment engaging French infantry]]\nThe bloodiest fighting of the battle occurred in Probstheida, a village just southeast of Leipzig. Here, about 60,000 soldiers under Barclay were marching and advancing towards the village in two columns, one under von Kleist advancing through Wachau, and one under General Wittgenstein advancing through Liebertwolkwitz. Barclay was pressured by the monarchs, especially Alexander I, to take the village since it was the key to the positions of Napoleon's troops, and although von Kleist opposed this, the monarchs' orders were paramount, so Barclay had to follow their orders anyway.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=933}}\n\nThe French dispositions at the village, however, were heavily fortified, thanks to the high and thick garden walls that gave excellent protection for the French infantry. The defense was also strengthened with artillery and strong infantry reserves behind the village. A day earlier, the Russians had taken most of the losses incurred during the battle, so it was the Prussians who took the initiative.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=933}}\n\nPrussian j\u00e4gers attempted to enter the village by storm but were quickly driven back. Then the artillery of both sides opened fire upon the village; despite the enormous amount of artillery that the Allies had brought with them, the more powerful French Imperial Guard artillery gradually gained the upper hand. The Prussians conducted a series of attacks against the French positions at the village, but because the French artillery repulsed each attack, their efforts were in vain. French cuirassiers, under Murat, charged upon the weakened Prussian lines and drove them back. Counter-charges by the numerous Russian cavalry saved the infantry by repeatedly driving back the French cavalry, albeit with heavy losses. The Prussians again conducted a charge upon French lines, but this charge was less successful than the first one.<ref>Smith, Digby George. 1813: Leipzig : Napoleon and the Battle of the Nations.</ref> The third assault was now conducted, this time, by the Russians, commanded by General [[Nikolay Raevsky|Raevsky]], the hero of [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]] who had arrived a few days earlier from Russia after a delay due to sickness. The assault on the village was somewhat more successful than the first two, taking the gardens and destroying several French infantry units, but it was eventually driven back by the French Imperial Guard, who had just arrived at the scene. Despite Schwarzenberg's request that Alexander send the Russian Guard, the Russian emperor ordered that more assaults were to be undertaken against the village. However, despite their successful, stubborn defense, the French were now in dire straits as they were dangerously short of manpower, and thus the fighting became only a hollow tactical victory for them.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=934}}\n\n====Actions at Paunsdorf and Sch\u00f6nefeld====\nDuring that morning, Bernadotte and Bl\u00fccher held a conference in Breitenfeld. It was agreed that Bernadotte's Army of the North would pass the Parthe River at Taucha with a reinforcement of 30,000 men drawn from Bl\u00fccher's Army of Silesia. Bl\u00fccher agreed to dispatch Langeron's army corps, and to renounce his rank and his rights as army commander, putting himself at the head of his Prussians.{{sfn|Nafziger|1996|p=215}} The advance of the Army of the North towards Leipzig had been slow, purportedly because Bernadotte had received word that Napoleon planned a renewed attack towards Berlin after his marshals' failure to take the city in the battles of [[Battle of Gro\u00dfbeeren|Gro\u00dfbeeren]] and [[Battle of Dennewitz|Dennewitz]].{{sfn|Nafziger|1996|p=216}}\n\n[[File:Baschkiren gegen Franzosen.jpg|thumb|French soldiers in skirmish with [[Bashkirs]] and [[Cossacks]]]]\nGeneral [[Matvei Platov|Platov]]'s Russian heavy artillery began to fire on the Saxons around Paunsdorf. Langeron placed pontoon bridges over the Parthe River and a flying bridge via Mockau. Large masses of troops had now moved to the east bank of the river. Meanwhile, Russian and Austrian forces began attacking French and Saxon positions in Paunsdorf, but after counterattacks by French infantry and deadly canister shots from Franco-Saxon batteries, were driven back. After being driven back, the Allied troops were pursued by French infantry before being counterattacked by Austrian hussar and grenzer cavalries, in turn driving the French back. The town itself was still held by five Franco-Saxon battalions. Captain Bogue of the British Rocket Brigade, advanced with his unit and began firing Congreve rockets into the town, causing the defenders to fall back in disorder. Bogue, seizing the moment, charged at the head of his escort squadron of cavalry. This small force was in turn being driven out of the village when a barrage of rockets fired in close support<ref name=\":0\" /> again caused the French troops to break ranks.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Rockets and Missiles: The Life Story of a Technology|last = Van Riper|first = A.

Allied troops repeatedly assaulted French positions there, but were forced back. French infantry attacks on Allied positions produced similar results. Repeated assaults by Russian musketeers and grenadiers under Langeron finally drove the French out of Sch\u00f6nefeld. The heavy fighting in Paunsdorf and Sch\u00f6nefeld set both villages on fire.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=934}}\n\n====Sweden fully participates====\nIn the meantime, at the behest of his officers, who felt embarrassed that they had not participated in the battle, Bernadotte gave the order for his light infantry to participate in the final assault on Leipzig itself. The Swedish j\u00e4gers performed very well, losing only about 121 men in the attack.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=934}}\n\n====Action at Lindenau====\nOn the western front, the French IV Corps under Bertrand finally drove the Austrian III Corps under Gyulay away from Lindenau.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=934}} This broke the encirclement which the Allied forces earlier had made against the ''Grande Armee'', clearing the way for its retreat which would take place later the next day.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=934}}\n\n====Pro-Napoleonic Germans defect to the Coalition====\nDuring the fighting, 5,400 Saxons of General [[Jean Reynier|Reynier]]'s VII Corps defected to the Coalition, specifically Bernadotte's Army of the North due to the esteem the Saxons had for the former French marshal. Four years prior, Bernadotte, while still a Marshal of the Empire, had commanded the wholly Saxon IX Corps during the [[Battle of Wagram]] where his mild and courteous behavior toward them in the weeks prior, along with a controversial Order of the Day praising their courage after the battle, greatly endeared Bernadotte to them.<ref>Barton, D. Plunket (1921) Pp. 223-229</ref>{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=934}} At first, French officers saw the Saxons' rushing towards the advancing Prussians as a charge, but treachery became evident as they saw the Saxons asking the Prussians to join with them for the impending assault. Reynier himself witnessed this, and he rallied the remaining Saxons at his disposal, but to no avail, because W\u00fcrttemberg's cavalry also deserted from the French, forcing the French line in Paunsdorf to fall back.<ref>Howard Giles, unknown book and date of publishing</ref>\n\n====The ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' begins to retreat====\nThe battle during the day of 18 October was one of [[attrition warfare|attrition]]. French troops held on to their respective positions, but were steadily being worn out and depleted by fierce and intensifying Allied attacks throughout the day. The French artillery had only 20,000 rounds left.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=936}} Later that night, Napoleon was treating the battle as a lost cause.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=935}} At this time, he promoted Poniatowski to the rank of ''[[Marshal of the Empire|Mar\u00e9chal d'Empire]]'', the only foreigner of all his marshals who was given this title, and the latter swore that he would fight to the last stand, which he did.<ref>Bowden \u2013 \"Napoleon's Grande Armee of 1813\" 1990, p. 191</ref> After this, the emperor began to stage the retreat for the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' westward across the Elster River.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=935}}\n\nDuring the night the French army had been ordered to withdraw silently from Connewitz, Probstheida, Stotteritz, Volkmansdorf, and Reudnitz, all to cross the river via Leipzig and the single bridge in the river. Those in Lindenau were to move to Weissenfels. Weak rear guards occupied the villages in order to conceal the retreat, and support troops were placed in the outer suburbs by the wind mills and near the walls of the city. The garden and cemetery walls by the Grimma Gate were pierced with loopholes as well as the gates themselves. Skirmishers were posted in the farm houses, in the brush, in the parks, and everywhere possible. Leipzig was to be occupied by Reynier's VII Corps, Poniatowski's VIII Corps and MacDonald's XI Corps.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=935}} They were ordered to hold it for a day or a bit longer, in order to allow the rest of the army, its artillery, and its equipment sufficient time to evacuate. The Allied cavalry advance posts were ordered to attack without relief the French advanced posts during the night to determine whether or not the French were attempting to withdraw. However, they failed to realize that the French were, in fact, pulling out from the battle area. Therefore, the evacuation continued throughout the night.{{sfn|Nafziger|1996|pp=233\u2013234}}\n\n===19 October===\n[[File:Napoleon.Leipzig.jpg|thumb|Napoleon's retreat on 19 October 1813, showing the explosion of the bridge]]\nThe Allies had only learned of the French evacuation at 7:00 on the morning of the 19 October.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=935}} Soon thereafter between 8:00\u20139:00 am they launched a full-scale assault from the north, south, and east against the retreating French. But they were held up in Leipzig because of a ferocious street-to-street rearguard action fought by Marshal Oudinot's 30,000 troops.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=935}} As the Russians and Prussians entered the city through the Halle and Grimma gates they fell upon barricades and houses full of French soldiers. Civilians were forced into hiding as the bloody [[urban warfare|urban combat]] raged throughout the city.<ref>Digby Smith \u2013 \"1813: Leipzig \u2013 Napoleon and the Battle of the Nations\", p. 256</ref>\n\nNapoleon's retreat continued smoothly until early afternoon when General Dulauloy, tasked with destroying the only bridge over the Elster, delegated the task to Colonel Montfort.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=935}} The colonel then passed this responsibility to a corporal, who was unaware of the carefully planned time schedule.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=935}} The corporal ignited the fuses at 1:00 in the afternoon while the bridge was still crowded with retreating French troops and Oudinot's rearguard was still in Leipzig.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=935}} The explosion and subsequent panic caused a rout that resulted in the deaths of thousands of French troops and the capture of 30,000 others.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=935\u2013936}} Both Oudinot and MacDonald managed to swim their way across but Poniatowski, hampered by his wounds, was one of the many who drowned while attempting to cross the river.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=936}}\n\n==Conclusion==\n[[File:1839 Krafft Siegesmeldung nach der Schlacht bei Leipzig 1813 anagoria.JPG|thumb|Alexander I of Russia, Francis I of Austria, and Frederick William III of Prussia meeting after the battle]]\nBy the end of the battle on the afternoon of 19 October, the remnants of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' had crossed the Elster River and begun a well-ordered retreat. The battle had ended conclusively and decisively with the nations of the Coalition as the victors, and the German Campaign was a complete failure for the French, although they achieved a minor victory when the Bavarian Army attempted to block the retreat of the ''Grande Arm\u00e9e'' at [[Battle of Hanau|Hanau]]. The heavy casualties the Coalition armies had incurred and their exhaustion from the bloody 4-day battle they fought made it impossible for them to promptly pursue the retreating ''Grande Arm\u00e9e''. The French were also exhausted after the battle, and were themselves retreating at a fast pace towards the Rhine.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=937}}\n\n==Casualties==\nThe Battle of Leipzig was the bloodiest of the Napoleonic Wars, with over 200,000 rounds of artillery ammunition having been expended.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=936}} Casualties on both sides were astoundingly high, such that locals had a hard time disposing of the corpses, and corpses were still visible the next year. Estimates range from 80,000 to 110,000 total killed, wounded, or missing. Napoleon lost about 38,000 killed and wounded.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=936}} The Allies captured 15,000 able-bodied Frenchmen, 21,000 wounded or sick, 325 guns {{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=936}}, 28 eagles, standards, or colours, and most of the French supply trains. Six French generals were killed, 12 wounded, and 36 captured including Lauriston and Reynier{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=936}}\n\nOut of a total force of 360,000, the Allies suffered approximately 54,000 casualties.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=936}} Schwarzenberg's Army of Bohemia lost 34,000, Bl\u00fccher's Army of Silesia lost 12,000, while Bernadotte's Army of the North and Bennigsen's Army of Poland lost about 4,000 each.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=936}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{quote|A year ago all Europe marched with us; today all Europe marches against us.|Napoleon<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">J. T. Headley, ''The Imperial Guard of Napoleon''</ref> }}\n\nThe battle ended the French Empire's presence east of the Rhine and brought secondary German states (e.g. Baden, Saxony, and W\u00fcrttemberg) over to the Coalition with the largest German states of Austria and Prussia. It also dealt a harsh blow to Napoleon himself, who was decisively defeated in battle for the first time in the Napoleonic Wars (although he had suffered a smaller defeat in 1809 at the [[Battle of Aspern-Essling]]), severely damaging his reputation as a military genius. Alexander I now urged all of his subordinate commanders including those of Austria, Prussia, and other nations to push the gigantic Coalition army on the offensive after the battle, and, having decisively won the battle, was more than ever determined to carry the war onto French soil.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=947}}\n\nThree weeks after Leipzig, Napoleon arrived at [[Saint-Cloud]] to organize the defense of France.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=945}} The time he went back to Paris at the year's end, his first words on entering the [[Senat conservateur|Senate]], after his return from the battle disaster, sad and low in mood, were, \"A year ago all Europe marched with us; today all Europe marches against us.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Half a million troops had been lost in the German Campaign of 1813.{{sfn|Chandler|1966|p=945}}\n\nWith the Confederation of the Rhine dissolved and Prussia once again becoming one of the continent's great powers after its [[War of the Fourth Coalition|severe setbacks]] in 1806,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> the Coalition armies pressed the advantage and invaded France in early 1814.
