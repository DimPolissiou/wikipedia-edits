Mexico's position was that Santa Anna had no legal standing in the Mexican government to agree to those terms or negotiate a treaty.\n\nSanta Anna's position was that he had signed the documents under coercion as a prisoner, not as a surrendering general in accordance with the laws of war.

Over those years, their relationship became increasingly acrimonious. When the final break of the relationship came in 1913, Jung retreated from many of his professional activities to intensely reconsider his personal and professional path.<ref>Shamdasani gives a detailed review Jung's development and his divergence from Freud during this period in: Sonu Shamdasani, ''C.

Jung writes in Liber Novus that during the day, \"I gave all my love and submission to things, to men, and to the thoughts of this time. I went into the desert only at night. Thus can you differentiate sick and divine delusion. Whoever does the one and does without the other you may call sick since he is out of balance.\" ''Liber Novus'', pg. 238.</ref> He maintained a busy professional practice, seeing on average five patients a day. He lectured, wrote, and remained active in professional associations.<ref>Lance S. Owens, \"The Hermeneutics of Vision: C. G.

These fantasies may be understood as a type of dramatized thinking in pictorial form.... In retrospect, he recalled that his scientific question was to see what took place when he switched off consciousness. The example of dreams indicated the existence of background activity, and he wanted to give this a possibility of emerging, just as one does when taking mescaline.\"<ref>''Liber Novus'', pg. 200.</ref></blockquote>\n\nJung initially recorded his \"visions\", or \"fantasies, or \"imaginations\" \u2014 all terms used by Jung to describe his activity<ref>Owens, \"Hermeneutics of Vision\", pp. 11-13.</ref> \u2014 in a series of six  journals now known collectively as the \"[[Black Books (Jung)|Black Books]]\".<ref>Shamdasani explains the nature of the \"Black Books\", and provides high-resolution photographs of these journals in:  Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', pp. 63-73.</ref>  This journal record begins on 12 November 1913, and continues with intensity through the summer of 1914; subsequent entries were added up through at least the 1930s.<ref>The Black Books are currently being edited for publication: ''The Black Books of C.G. Jung (1913-1932)'', ed. Sonu Shamdasani, (Stiftung der Werke von C. G. Jung & W. W. Norton & Company), publication date pending.</ref>  Biographer [[Barbara Hannah]], who was close to Jung throughout the last three decades of his life, compared Jung's imaginative experiences recounted in his journals to the encounter of [[Menelaus]] with [[Proteus]] in the ''[[Odyssey]].''  Jung, she said, \"made it a rule never to let a figure or figures that he encountered leave until they had told him why they had appeared to him.\"<ref name=\"Hannah\">{{Cite book|last=Hannah |first=Barbara |title=Jung: His Life and Work |year=1976 |isbn=0-87773-615-4 |page=115}}</ref>\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Jung perceived that his visionary experience was not only of personal relevance, but entwined with a crucial cultural moment. In late-1914 and 1915 he compiled the visions from the journals, along with his additional commentary on each imaginative episode, into an initial manuscript. This manuscript was the beginning of ''Liber Novus''.<ref>See Shamdasani's introduction to the ''Red Book: Liber Novus'' for detailed explanation of this effort: ''Liber Novus'', pp. 198-203.</ref>\n\nIn 1915 Jung began artfully transcribing this draft text into the illuminated calligraphic volume that would subsequently become known as the ''Red Book''. In 1917 he compiled a further supplementary manuscript of visionary material and commentary, which he titled \"Scrutinies\"; this also was apparently intended for transcription into his red folio volume, the \"Red Book\".<ref>''Liber Novus'', pg. 331ff.</ref>  Although Jung labored on the artful transcription of this corpus of manuscript material into the calligraphic folio of the Red Book for sixteen years, he never completed the task. Only approximately two-thirds of Jung's manuscript text was transcribed into the Red Book by 1930, when he abandoned further work on the calligraphic transcription of his draft material into the Red Book.<ref>In the last three years of his life, Jung returned to his folio volume, and made an effort to finish the transcription.  He found it was beyond his ability, given his advanced age.  The transcription ends in mid-sentence. ''Liber Novus'', pg. 360.</ref> The published edition of ''The Red Book: Liber Novus'' includes all of Jung's manuscript material prepared for ''Liber Novus'', and not just the portion of the text transcribed by Jung into the calligraphic red book volume.<ref>See Shamdasani's  \"Editorial Note\": ''Liber Novus'', pp. 225-6.</ref>\n\nIn 1957, near the end of his life, Jung spoke to [[Aniela Jaff\u00e9]] about the ''Red Book'' and the process which yielded it; in that interview he stated:\n\n<blockquote>\"The years\u2026 when I pursued the inner images, were the most important time of my life. Everything else is to be derived from this. It began at that time, and the later details hardly matter anymore. My entire life consisted in elaborating what had burst forth from the unconscious and flooded me like an enigmatic stream and threatened to break me. That was the stuff and material for more than only one life. Everything later was merely the outer classification, scientific elaboration, and the integration into life. But the numinous beginning, which contained everything, was then.\"<ref>''Liber Novus'', p. vii.</ref></blockquote>In 1959, after having left the book more or less untouched for about 30 years, Jung wrote a short epilogue: \u201cTo the superficial observer, it will appear like madness.\u201d<ref name=\"Corbett\" />\n\n==Creation and physical description==\n[[File:The_Red_Book_-_Liber_Novus.jpg|thumb|right|The Red Book resting on Jung's desk]]\nJung worked his text and images in the Red Book using [[Calligraphy|calligraphic]] pen, multicolored ink, and [[gouache]] paint. The text is written in German but includes quotations from the [[Vulgate]] in Latin, a few inscriptions and names written in Latin and Greek, and a brief marginal quotation from the [[Bhagavad Gita]] given in English.\n\nThe initial seven folios (or leaves) of the book \u2014 which contain what is now entitled ''Liber Primus'' (the \"First Book\") of ''Liber Novus'' \u2014 were composed on sheets of [[parchment]] in a highly illuminated medieval style. However, as Jung proceeded working with the parchment sheets, it became apparent that their surface was not holding his paint properly and that his ink was bleeding through. These first seven leaves (fourteen pages, recto and verso) now show heavy chipping of paint, as will be noted on close examination of the facsimile edition reproductions.\n\nIn 1915, Jung commissioned the folio-sized and red leatherbound volume now known as the Red Book.<ref>High-resolution images of the Red Book appear in: Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', pp. 118-9.</ref> The bound volume contained approximately 600 blank pages of paper of a quality suitable for Jung's ink and paint. The folio-sized volume, {{convert|11.57|in|cm}} by {{convert|15.35|in|cm}}, is bound in fine red leather with gilt accents. Though Jung and others usually referred to the book simply as the \"Red Book\", he had the top of the spine of the book stamped in gilt with the book's formal title, ''Liber Novus'' (\"The New Book\").\n\nJung subsequently interleaved the seven original parchment sheets at the beginning of the bound volume. After receiving the bound volume in 1915, he began transcribing his text and illustrations directly onto the bound pages. Over the next many years, Jung ultimately filled only 191 of the approximately 600 pages bound in the Red Book folio.<ref>Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', pg. 119n.</ref> About a third of the manuscript material he had written was never entered into the illuminated Red Book. Inside the book now are 205 completed pages of text and illustrations (including the loose parchment sheets), all from Jung's hand:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychcentral.com/blog/carl-jungs-red-book/|title=Carl Jung's Red Book|last=Grohol|first=John M.|date=2009-09-20|website=World of Psychology|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref> 53 full-page images, 71 pages with both text and artwork, and 81 pages entirely of calligraphic text.\n\nThe Red Book is currently held, along with other valuable and private items from Jung's archive, in a bank vault in [[Zurich]].\n\n==Publication and display==\nDuring Jung's life, several people saw his Red Book \u2014 it was often present in his office \u2014 but only a very few individuals who were personally trusted by Jung had an opportunity to read it.

G. Jung finally decided in 2000 to allow publication of the work, and thereafter began preparations for the publication. The decision to publish was apparently aided by presentations made by Sonu Shamdasani, who had already discovered substantial private transcriptions of portions of the Red Book in archival repositories.<ref name=Corbett>{{Cite news|author=Corbett, Sara |title=The Holy Grail of the Unconscious |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/magazine/20jung-t.html|date=2009-09-16 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref> Editorial efforts and preparation for publication were underwritten by major funding from the [[Philemon Foundation]].\n\nOn occasion of the publication in October 2009, the [[Rubin Museum of Art]] in New York City displayed the original book along with three of Jung's original \"Black Book\" journals and several other related artifacts; this exhibit was open from 7 October 2009 to 25 January 2010.

Over those years, their relationship became increasingly acrimonious. When the final break of the relationship came in 1913, Jung retreated from many of his professional activities to intensely reconsider his personal and professional path.<ref>Shamdasani gives a detailed review Jung's development and his divergence from Freud during this period in: Sonu Shamdasani, ''C.

Jung writes in Liber Novus that during the day, \"I gave all my love and submission to things, to men, and to the thoughts of this time. I went into the desert only at night. Thus can you differentiate sick and divine delusion. Whoever does the one and does without the other you may call sick since he is out of balance.\" ''Liber Novus'', pg. 238.</ref> He maintained a busy professional practice, seeing on average five patients a day. He lectured, wrote, and remained active in professional associations.<ref>Lance S. Owens, \"The Hermeneutics of Vision: C. G.

These fantasies may be understood as a type of dramatized thinking in pictorial form.... In retrospect, he recalled that his scientific question was to see what took place when he switched off consciousness. The example of dreams indicated the existence of background activity, and he wanted to give this a possibility of emerging, just as one does when taking mescaline.\"<ref>''Liber Novus'', pg. 200.</ref></blockquote>\n\nJung initially recorded his \"visions\", or \"fantasies, or \"imaginations\" \u2014 all terms used by Jung to describe his activity<ref>Owens, \"Hermeneutics of Vision\", pp. 11-13.</ref> \u2014 in a series of six  journals now known collectively as the \"[[Black Books (Jung)|Black Books]]\".<ref>Shamdasani explains the nature of the \"Black Books\", and provides high-resolution photographs of these journals in:  Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', pp. 63-73.</ref>  This journal record begins on 12 November 1913, and continues with intensity through the summer of 1914; subsequent entries were added up through at least the 1930s.<ref>The Black Books are currently being edited for publication: ''The Black Books of C.G. Jung (1913-1932)'', ed. Sonu Shamdasani, (Stiftung der Werke von C. G. Jung & W. W. Norton & Company), publication date pending.</ref>  Biographer [[Barbara Hannah]], who was close to Jung throughout the last three decades of his life, compared Jung's imaginative experiences recounted in his journals to the encounter of [[Menelaus]] with [[Proteus]] in the ''[[Odyssey]].''  Jung, she said, \"made it a rule never to let a figure or figures that he encountered leave until they had told him why they had appeared to him.\"<ref name=\"Hannah\">{{Cite book|last=Hannah |first=Barbara |title=Jung: His Life and Work |year=1976 |isbn=0-87773-615-4 |page=115}}</ref>\n\nAfter the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, Jung perceived that his visionary experience was not only of personal relevance, but entwined with a crucial cultural moment. In late-1914 and 1915 he compiled the visions from the journals, along with his additional commentary on each imaginative episode, into an initial manuscript. This manuscript was the beginning of ''Liber Novus''.<ref>See Shamdasani's introduction to the ''Red Book: Liber Novus'' for detailed explanation of this effort: ''Liber Novus'', pp. 198-203.</ref>\n\nIn 1915 Jung began artfully transcribing this draft text into the illuminated calligraphic volume that would subsequently become known as the ''Red Book''. In 1917 he compiled a further supplementary manuscript of visionary material and commentary, which he titled \"Scrutinies\"; this also was apparently intended for transcription into his red folio volume, the \"Red Book\".<ref>''Liber Novus'', pg. 331ff.</ref>  Although Jung labored on the artful transcription of this corpus of manuscript material into the calligraphic folio of the Red Book for sixteen years, he never completed the task. Only approximately two-thirds of Jung's manuscript text was transcribed into the Red Book by 1930, when he abandoned further work on the calligraphic transcription of his draft material into the Red Book.<ref>In the last three years of his life, Jung returned to his folio volume, and made an effort to finish the transcription.  He found it was beyond his ability, given his advanced age.  The transcription ends in mid-sentence. ''Liber Novus'', pg. 360.</ref> The published edition of ''The Red Book: Liber Novus'' includes all of Jung's manuscript material prepared for ''Liber Novus'', and not just the portion of the text transcribed by Jung into the calligraphic red book volume.<ref>See Shamdasani's  \"Editorial Note\": ''Liber Novus'', pp. 225-6.</ref>\n\nIn 1957, near the end of his life, Jung spoke to [[Aniela Jaff\u00e9]] about the ''Red Book'' and the process which yielded it; in that interview he stated:\n\n<blockquote>\"The years\u2026 when I pursued the inner images, were the most important time of my life. Everything else is to be derived from this. It began at that time, and the later details hardly matter anymore. My entire life consisted in elaborating what had burst forth from the unconscious and flooded me like an enigmatic stream and threatened to break me. That was the stuff and material for more than only one life. Everything later was merely the outer classification, scientific elaboration, and the integration into life. But the numinous beginning, which contained everything, was then.\"<ref>''Liber Novus'', p. vii.</ref></blockquote>In 1959, after having left the book more or less untouched for about 30 years, Jung wrote a short epilogue: \u201cTo the superficial observer, it will appear like madness.\u201d<ref name=\"Corbett\" />\n\n==Creation and physical description==\n[[File:The_Red_Book_-_Liber_Novus.jpg|thumb|right|The Red Book resting on Jung's desk]]\nJung worked his text and images in the Red Book using calligraphic pen, multicolored ink, and [[gouache]] paint. The text is written in German but includes quotations from the [[Vulgate]] in Latin, a few inscriptions and names written in Latin and Greek, and a brief marginal quotation from the [[Bhagavad Gita]] given in English.\n\nThe initial seven folios (or leaves) of the book \u2014 which contain what is now entitled ''Liber Primus'' (the \"First Book\") of ''Liber Novus'' \u2014 were composed on sheets of [[parchment]] in a highly illuminated medieval style. However, as Jung proceeded working with the parchment sheets, it became apparent that their surface was not holding his paint properly and that his ink was bleeding through. These first seven leaves (fourteen pages, recto and verso) now show heavy chipping of paint, as will be noted on close examination of the facsimile edition reproductions.\n\nIn 1915, Jung commissioned the folio-sized and red leatherbound volume now known as the Red Book.<ref>High-resolution images of the Red Book appear in: Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', pp. 118-9.</ref> The bound volume contained approximately 600 blank pages of paper of a quality suitable for Jung's ink and paint. The folio-sized volume, {{convert|11.57|in|cm}} by {{convert|15.35|in|cm}}, is bound in fine red leather with gilt accents. Though Jung and others usually referred to the book simply as the \"Red Book\", he had the top of the spine of the book stamped in gilt with the book's formal title, ''Liber Novus'' (\"The New Book\").\n\nJung subsequently interleaved the seven original parchment sheets at the beginning of the bound volume. After receiving the bound volume in 1915, he began transcribing his text and illustrations directly onto the bound pages. Over the next many years, Jung ultimately filled only 191 of the approximately 600 pages bound in the Red Book folio.<ref>Shamdasani, ''C. G. Jung: A Biography in Books'', pg. 119n.</ref> About a third of the manuscript material he had written was never entered into the illuminated Red Book. Inside the book now are 205 completed pages of text and illustrations (including the loose parchment sheets), all from Jung's hand:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://psychcentral.com/blog/carl-jungs-red-book/|title=Carl Jung's Red Book|last=Grohol|first=John M.|date=2009-09-20|website=World of Psychology|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-30}}</ref> 53 full-page images, 71 pages with both text and artwork, and 81 pages entirely of calligraphic text.\n\nThe Red Book is currently held, along with other valuable and private items from Jung's archive, in a bank vault in Zurich.\n\n==Publication and display==\nDuring Jung's life, several people saw his Red Book \u2014 it was often present in his office \u2014 but only a very few individuals who were personally trusted by Jung had an opportunity to read it. After Jung's death in 1961, Jung's heirs held the book as a private legacy, and refused access to it by scholars or other interested parties.<ref name=\"Bair\">{{Cite book|last=Bair |first=Deirdre |title=Jung: A Biography |year=2003 |isbn=0-316-07665-1 |page=745}}</ref>\n\nAfter many years of careful deliberations, the estate of C. G. Jung finally decided in 2000 to allow publication of the work, and thereafter began preparations for the publication. The decision to publish was apparently aided by presentations made by Sonu Shamdasani, who had already discovered substantial private transcriptions of portions of the Red Book in archival repositories.<ref name=Corbett>{{Cite news|author=Corbett, Sara |title=The Holy Grail of the Unconscious |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/20/magazine/20jung-t.html|date=2009-09-16 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref> Editorial efforts and preparation for publication were underwritten by major funding from the [[Philemon Foundation]].\n\nOn occasion of the publication in October 2009, the [[Rubin Museum of Art]] in New York City displayed the original book along with three of Jung's original \"Black Book\" journals and several other related artifacts; this exhibit was open from 7 October 2009 to 25 January 2010.
