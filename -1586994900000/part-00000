The aim of this association is that the antibiotic suppresses intestinal [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[microflora]], which are a source of vitamin K. Diminished production of vitamin K by the intestinal microflora contributes to the action of anticoagulants.  Added [[vitamin D]] also has a synergistic effect with anticoagulants.\n|}\n\n[[Vitamin K|Vitamin K<sub>1</sub>]] has been suggested, and successfully used, as antidote for [[pet]]s or humans accidentally or intentionally exposed to anticoagulant poisons.  Some of these poisons act by inhibiting [[liver]] functions<!--relevance to blood transfusion?--> and in advanced stages of poisoning, several blood-clotting factors are absent, and the volume of circulating blood is diminished, so that a blood transfusion (optionally with the clotting factors present) can save a person who has been poisoned, an advantage over some older poisons.\n\n=== Metal phosphides ===\n[[File:5654-Linxia-City-market-rat-poison-vendor.jpg|thumb|Rat poison vendor's stall at a market in [[Linxia City]], China]]\nMetal phosphides have been used as a means of killing rodents and are considered single-dose fast acting rodenticides (death occurs commonly within 1\u20133 days after single bait ingestion). A bait consisting of food and a phosphide (usually [[zinc phosphide]]) is left where the rodents can eat it. The acid in the digestive system of the rodent reacts with the phosphide to generate the toxic [[phosphine]] gas. This method of vermin control has possible use in places where rodents are resistant to some of the anticoagulants, particularly for control of house and field mice; zinc phosphide baits are also cheaper than most second-generation anticoagulants, so that sometimes, in the case of large infestation by rodents, their population is initially reduced by copious amounts of zinc phosphide bait applied, and the rest of population that survived the initial fast-acting poison is then eradicated by prolonged feeding on anticoagulant bait. Inversely, the individual rodents that survived anticoagulant bait poisoning (rest population) can be eradicated by pre-baiting them with nontoxic bait for a week or two (this is important to overcome bait shyness, and to get rodents used to feeding in specific areas by specific food, especially in eradicating rats) and subsequently applying poisoned bait of the same sort as used for pre-baiting until all consumption of the bait ceases (usually within 2\u20134 days). These methods of alternating rodenticides with different modes of action gives actual or almost 100% eradications of the rodent population in the area, if the acceptance/palatability of baits are good (i.e., rodents feed on it readily).\n\nZinc phosphide is typically added to rodent baits in a concentration of 0.75% to 2.0%. The baits have strong, pungent garlic-like odor due to the [[phosphine]] liberated by [[hydrolysis]]. The odor attracts (or, at least, does not repel) rodents, but has an repulsive effect on other mammals. Birds, notably [[wild turkey]]s, are not sensitive to the smell, and will feed on the bait, and thus become collateral damage.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe tablets or pellets (usually aluminium, calcium or magnesium phosphide for fumigation/gassing) may also contain other chemicals which evolve [[ammonia]], which helps reduce the potential for spontaneous [[combustion]] or [[explosion]] of the [[phosphine]] gas.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nMetal phosphides do not accumulate in the tissues of poisoned animals, so the risk of [[secondary poisoning]] is low.\n\nBefore the advent of anticoagulants, phosphides were the favored kind of rat poison. During World War II, they came into use in United States because of shortage of [[strychnine]] due to the Japanese occupation of the territories where the [[strychnine tree]] is grown. Phosphides are rather fast-acting rat poisons, resulting in the rats dying usually in open areas, instead of in the affected buildings.\n\nPhosphides used as rodenticides include:\n* [[aluminium phosphide]] ([[fumigant]] and bait)\n* [[calcium phosphide]]  ([[fumigant]] only)\n* magnesium phosphide ([[fumigant]] only)\n* [[zinc phosphide]] (bait only)\n\n=== Hypercalcemia ===\n[[Cholecalciferol]] (vitamin D<sub>3</sub>) and [[ergocalciferol]] (vitamin D<sub>2</sub>) are used as [[Cholecalciferol#Use_as_rodenticide|rodenticides]]. They are toxic to rodents for the same reason they are important to humans: they affect calcium and phosphate [[homeostasis]] in the body. Vitamins D are essential in minute quantities (few [[international unit|IU]]s per kilogram body weight daily, only a fraction of a milligram), and like most fat soluble [[vitamin]]s, they are toxic in larger doses, causing [[hypervitaminosis]]. If the poisoning is severe enough (that is, if the dose of the toxin is high enough), it leads to death. In rodents that consume the rodenticidal bait, it causes [[hypercalcemia]], raising the calcium level, mainly by increasing calcium absorption from food, mobilising bone-matrix-fixed calcium into [[ionised]] form (mainly monohydrogencarbonate calcium cation, partially bound to plasma proteins, [CaHCO<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup>), which circulates dissolved in the [[blood plasma]]. After ingestion of a lethal dose, the free calcium levels are raised sufficiently that [[blood vessel]]s, [[kidney]]s, the [[stomach]] wall and [[lung]]s are mineralised/calcificated (formation of calcificates, crystals of calcium salts/complexes in the tissues, damaging them), leading further to heart problems (myocardial tissue is sensitive to variations of free calcium levels, affecting both myocardial contractibility and excitation propagation between atrias and ventriculars), bleeding (due to capillary damage) and possibly kidney failure. It is considered to be single-dose, cumulative (depending on concentration used; the common 0.075% bait concentration is lethal to most rodents after a single intake of larger portions of the bait) or sub-chronic (death occurring usually within days to one week after ingestion of the bait). Applied concentrations are 0.075% cholecalciferol<ref name=vertebratePestProceedings1984>{{cite conference |title=CHOLECALCIFEROL: A UNIQUE TOXICANT FOR RODENT CONTROL |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/vpc11/22/ |conference=Proceedings of the Eleventh Vertebrate Pest Conference (1984) |publisher=University of Nebraska Lincoln |date=March 1984 |quote=''Cholecalciferol is an acute (single-feeding) and/or chronic (multiple-feeding) rodenticide toxicant with unique activity for controlling commensal rodents including anticoagulant-resistant rats.

This synergism is mostly used in calciferol low concentration baits, because effective concentrations of calciferols are more expensive than effective concentrations of most anticoagulants.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe first application of a calciferol in rodenticidal bait was in the Sorex product Sorexa D (with a different formula than today's Sorexa D), back in the early 1970s, which contained 0.025% warfarin and 0.1% ergocalciferol. Today, Sorexa CD contains a 0.0025% difenacoum and 0.075% cholecalciferol combination. Numerous other brand products containing either 0.075-0.1% calciferols (e.g. Quintox) alone or alongside an anticoagulant are marketed.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe Merck Veterinary Manual states the following:\n<blockquote>\nAlthough this rodenticide [cholecalciferol] was introduced with claims that it was less toxic to nontarget species than to rodents, clinical experience has shown that rodenticides containing cholecalciferol are a significant health threat to dogs and cats. Cholecalciferol produces hypercalcemia, which results in systemic calcification of soft tissue, leading to [[kidney failure]], cardiac abnormalities, hypertension, CNS depression and GI upset. Signs generally develop within 18-36 hours of ingestion and can include depression, anorexia, polyuria and polydipsia. As serum calcium concentrations increase, clinical signs become more severe. ...&nbsp;GI smooth muscle excitability decreases and is manifest by anorexia, vomiting and constipation. ...&nbsp;Loss of renal concentrating ability is a direct result of hypercalcemia. As hypercalcemia persists, mineralization of the kidneys results in progressive renal insufficiency.\"<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/213000.htm\n| title=Merck Veterinary Manual - Rodenticide Poisoning: Introduction\n}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAdditional anticoagulant renders the bait more toxic to pets as well as human. Upon single ingestion, solely calciferol-based baits are considered generally safer to birds than second generation anticoagulants or acute toxicants. A specific antidote for calciferol intoxication is [[calcitonin]], a hormone that lowers the blood levels of calcium. The therapy with commercially available calcitonin preparations is, however, expensive.\n\n=== Other ===\n[[File:CPS141ratpoison.jpg|thumb|right|[[Civilian Public Service]] worker distributes poisoned bait for [[Endemic typhus|typhus]] control in [[Gulfport, Mississippi]],  ca. 1945.]]\nOther chemical [[poison]]s include:\n*[[ANTU]] (\u03b1-naphthylthiourea; specific against [[Brown rat]], ''Rattus norvegicus'')\n*[[Arsenic trioxide]]\n*[[Barium carbonate]] (sometimes called [[Witherite]])\n*[[Chloralose]] (a narcotic [[prodrug]])\n*[[Crimidine]] (inhibits metabolism of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>)\n*[[1,3-Difluoro-2-propanol]] (\"Gliftor\")\n*[[Endrin]] ([[organochlorine insecticide]], used in the past for extermination of voles in fields)\n*[[Fluoroacetamide]] (\"1081\")\n*[[Phosacetim]] (a delayed-action [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]])\n*[[White phosphorus]]\n*[[Pyrinuron]] (an [[urea]] derivative)\n*[[Scilliroside]] and other [[cardiac glycosides]] like [[oleandrin]] or [[digoxin]]\n*[[Sodium fluoroacetate]] (\"1080\")\n*[[Strychnine]] (A naturally occurring convulsant and stimulant)\n*[[Tetramethylenedisulfotetramine]] (\"tetramine\") - Deadly toxic to humans so use should be avoided\n*[[Thallium sulfate]]\n*[[Mitochondria]]l toxins like [[bromethalin]] and [[2,4-dinitrophenol]] (cause high fever and brain swelling)\n*[[Zyklon B]]/Uragan D2 ([[hydrogen cyanide]] gas absorbed in an inert carrier)\n*[[Carbon Dioxide]] / [[Rat Ice]] ([[dry ice]] in pellet form which displaces oxygen into the burrows)\n\n===Combinations===\nIn some countries, fixed three-component rodenticides, i.e., anticoagulant + antibiotic + vitamin D, are used. Associations of a second-generation anticoagulant with an antibiotic and/or vitamin D are considered to be effective even against most resistant strains of rodents, though some second generation anticoagulants (namely brodifacoum and difethialone), in bait concentrations of 0.0025% to 0.005% are so toxic that resistance is unknown, and even rodents resistant to other rodenticides are reliably exterminated by application of these most toxic anticoagulants.\n\n==Low toxicity rodenticides==\n[[Powdered corn cob]] or [[corn meal gluten]], have been developed as rodenticides and were approved in the EU and patented in the US in 2013.

The aim of this association is that the antibiotic suppresses intestinal [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[microflora]], which are a source of vitamin K. Diminished production of vitamin K by the intestinal microflora contributes to the action of anticoagulants.  Added [[vitamin D]] also has a synergistic effect with anticoagulants.\n|}\n\n[[Vitamin K|Vitamin K<sub>1</sub>]] has been suggested, and successfully used, as antidote for [[pet]]s or humans accidentally or intentionally exposed to anticoagulant poisons.  Some of these poisons act by inhibiting [[liver]] functions<!--relevance to blood transfusion?--> and in advanced stages of poisoning, several blood-clotting factors are absent, and the volume of circulating blood is diminished, so that a blood transfusion (optionally with the clotting factors present) can save a person who has been poisoned, an advantage over some older poisons.\n\n=== Metal phosphides ===\n[[File:5654-Linxia-City-market-rat-poison-vendor.jpg|thumb|Rat poison vendor's stall at a market in [[Linxia City]], China]]\nMetal phosphides have been used as a means of killing rodents and are considered single-dose fast acting rodenticides (death occurs commonly within 1\u20133 days after single bait ingestion). A bait consisting of food and a phosphide (usually [[zinc phosphide]]) is left where the rodents can eat it. The acid in the digestive system of the rodent reacts with the phosphide to generate the toxic [[phosphine]] gas. This method of vermin control has possible use in places where rodents are resistant to some of the anticoagulants, particularly for control of house and field mice; zinc phosphide baits are also cheaper than most second-generation anticoagulants, so that sometimes, in the case of large infestation by rodents, their population is initially reduced by copious amounts of zinc phosphide bait applied, and the rest of population that survived the initial fast-acting poison is then eradicated by prolonged feeding on anticoagulant bait. Inversely, the individual rodents that survived anticoagulant bait poisoning (rest population) can be eradicated by pre-baiting them with nontoxic bait for a week or two (this is important to overcome bait shyness, and to get rodents used to feeding in specific areas by specific food, especially in eradicating rats) and subsequently applying poisoned bait of the same sort as used for pre-baiting until all consumption of the bait ceases (usually within 2\u20134 days). These methods of alternating rodenticides with different modes of action gives actual or almost 100% eradications of the rodent population in the area, if the acceptance/palatability of baits are good (i.e., rodents feed on it readily).\n\nZinc phosphide is typically added to rodent baits in a concentration of 0.75% to 2.0%. The baits have strong, pungent garlic-like odor due to the [[phosphine]] liberated by [[hydrolysis]]. The odor attracts (or, at least, does not repel) rodents, but has an repulsive effect on other mammals. Birds, notably [[wild turkey]]s, are not sensitive to the smell, and will feed on the bait, and thus become collateral damage.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe tablets or pellets (usually aluminium, calcium or magnesium phosphide for fumigation/gassing) may also contain other chemicals which evolve [[ammonia]], which helps reduce the potential for spontaneous [[combustion]] or [[explosion]] of the [[phosphine]] gas.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nMetal phosphides do not accumulate in the tissues of poisoned animals, so the risk of [[secondary poisoning]] is low.\n\nBefore the advent of anticoagulants, phosphides were the favored kind of rat poison. During World War II, they came into use in United States because of shortage of [[strychnine]] due to the Japanese occupation of the territories where the [[strychnine tree]] is grown. Phosphides are rather fast-acting rat poisons, resulting in the rats dying usually in open areas, instead of in the affected buildings.\n\nPhosphides used as rodenticides include:\n* [[aluminium phosphide]] ([[fumigant]] and bait)\n* [[calcium phosphide]]  ([[fumigant]] only)\n* magnesium phosphide ([[fumigant]] only)\n* [[zinc phosphide]] (bait only)\n\n=== Hypercalcemia ===\n[[Cholecalciferol]] (vitamin D<sub>3</sub>) and [[ergocalciferol]] (vitamin D<sub>2</sub>) are used as [[Cholecalciferol#Use_as_rodenticide|rodenticides]]. They are toxic to rodents for the same reason they are important to humans: they affect calcium and phosphate [[homeostasis]] in the body. Vitamins D are essential in minute quantities (few [[international unit|IU]]s per kilogram body weight daily, only a fraction of a milligram), and like most fat soluble [[vitamin]]s, they are toxic in larger doses, causing [[hypervitaminosis]]. If the poisoning is severe enough (that is, if the dose of the toxin is high enough), it leads to death. In rodents that consume the rodenticidal bait, it causes [[hypercalcemia]], raising the calcium level, mainly by increasing calcium absorption from food, mobilising bone-matrix-fixed calcium into [[ionised]] form (mainly monohydrogencarbonate calcium cation, partially bound to plasma proteins, [CaHCO<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup>), which circulates dissolved in the [[blood plasma]]. After ingestion of a lethal dose, the free calcium levels are raised sufficiently that [[blood vessel]]s, [[kidney]]s, the [[stomach]] wall and [[lung]]s are mineralised/calcificated (formation of calcificates, crystals of calcium salts/complexes in the tissues, damaging them), leading further to heart problems (myocardial tissue is sensitive to variations of free calcium levels, affecting both myocardial contractibility and excitation propagation between atrias and ventriculars), bleeding (due to capillary damage) and possibly kidney failure. It is considered to be single-dose, cumulative (depending on concentration used; the common 0.075% bait concentration is lethal to most rodents after a single intake of larger portions of the bait) or sub-chronic (death occurring usually within days to one week after ingestion of the bait). Applied concentrations are 0.075% cholecalciferol<ref name=vertebratePestProceedings1984>{{cite conference |title=CHOLECALCIFEROL: A UNIQUE TOXICANT FOR RODENT CONTROL |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/vpc11/22/ |conference=Proceedings of the Eleventh Vertebrate Pest Conference (1984) |publisher=University of Nebraska Lincoln |date=March 1984 |quote=''Cholecalciferol is an acute (single-feeding) and/or chronic (multiple-feeding) rodenticide toxicant with unique activity for controlling commensal rodents including anticoagulant-resistant rats.

This synergism is mostly used in calciferol low concentration baits, because effective concentrations of calciferols are more expensive than effective concentrations of most anticoagulants.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe first application of a calciferol in rodenticidal bait was in the Sorex product Sorexa D (with a different formula than today's Sorexa D), back in the early 1970s, which contained 0.025% warfarin and 0.1% ergocalciferol. Today, Sorexa CD contains a 0.0025% difenacoum and 0.075% cholecalciferol combination. Numerous other brand products containing either 0.075-0.1% calciferols (e.g. Quintox) alone or alongside an anticoagulant are marketed.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe Merck Veterinary Manual states the following:\n<blockquote>\nAlthough this rodenticide [cholecalciferol] was introduced with claims that it was less toxic to nontarget species than to rodents, clinical experience has shown that rodenticides containing cholecalciferol are a significant health threat to dogs and cats. Cholecalciferol produces hypercalcemia, which results in systemic calcification of soft tissue, leading to [[kidney failure]], cardiac abnormalities, hypertension, CNS depression and GI upset. Signs generally develop within 18-36 hours of ingestion and can include depression, anorexia, polyuria and polydipsia. As serum calcium concentrations increase, clinical signs become more severe. ...&nbsp;GI smooth muscle excitability decreases and is manifest by anorexia, vomiting and constipation. ...&nbsp;Loss of renal concentrating ability is a direct result of hypercalcemia. As hypercalcemia persists, mineralization of the kidneys results in progressive renal insufficiency.\"<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/213000.htm\n| title=Merck Veterinary Manual - Rodenticide Poisoning: Introduction\n}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAdditional anticoagulant renders the bait more toxic to pets as well as human. Upon single ingestion, solely calciferol-based baits are considered generally safer to birds than second generation anticoagulants or acute toxicants. A specific antidote for calciferol intoxication is [[calcitonin]], a hormone that lowers the blood levels of calcium. The therapy with commercially available calcitonin preparations is, however, expensive.\n\n=== Other ===\n[[File:CPS141ratpoison.jpg|thumb|right|[[Civilian Public Service]] worker distributes poisoned bait for [[Endemic typhus|typhus]] control in [[Gulfport, Mississippi]],  ca. 1945.]]\nOther chemical [[poison]]s include:\n*[[ANTU]] (\u03b1-naphthylthiourea; specific against [[Brown rat]], ''Rattus norvegicus'')\n*[[Arsenic trioxide]]\n*[[Barium carbonate]] (sometimes called [[Witherite]])\n*[[Chloralose]] (a narcotic [[prodrug]])\n*[[Crimidine]] (inhibits metabolism of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>)\n*[[1,3-Difluoro-2-propanol]] (\"Gliftor\")\n*[[Endrin]] ([[organochlorine insecticide]], used in the past for extermination of voles in fields)\n*[[Fluoroacetamide]] (\"1081\")\n*[[Phosacetim]] (a delayed-action [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]])\n*[[White phosphorus]]\n*[[Pyrinuron]] (an [[urea]] derivative)\n*[[Scilliroside]] and other [[cardiac glycosides]] like [[oleandrin]] or [[digoxin]]\n*[[Sodium fluoroacetate]] (\"1080\")\n*[[Strychnine]] (A naturally occurring convulsant and stimulant)\n*[[Tetramethylenedisulfotetramine]] (\"tetramine\") - Deadly toxic to humans so use should be avoided\n*[[Thallium sulfate]]\n*[[Mitochondria]]l toxins like [[bromethalin]] and [[2,4-dinitrophenol]] (cause high fever and brain swelling)\n*[[Zyklon B]]/Uragan D2 ([[hydrogen cyanide]] gas absorbed in an inert carrier)\n*[[Carbon Dioxide]] / [[Rat Ice]] ([[dry ice]] in pellet form which displaces oxygen into the burrows)\n\n===Combinations===\nIn some countries, fixed three-component rodenticides, i.e., anticoagulant + antibiotic + vitamin D, are used. Associations of a second-generation anticoagulant with an antibiotic and/or vitamin D are considered to be effective even against most resistant strains of rodents, though some second generation anticoagulants (namely brodifacoum and difethialone), in bait concentrations of 0.0025% to 0.005% are so toxic that resistance is unknown, and even rodents resistant to other rodenticides are reliably exterminated by application of these most toxic anticoagulants.\n\n==Low toxicity rodenticides==\n[[Powdered corn cob]] or [[corn meal gluten]], have been developed as rodenticides and were approved in the EU and patented in the US in 2013.

Borghese was then tried and convicted of collaboration with the Nazi invaders but not of war crimes, by the Italian court.\n\nAngleton remained in Italy after the war, establishing connections with other secret intelligence services and playing a major role in the victory of the US-supported [[Christian Democratic Party]], over the USSR-supported [[Italian Communist Party]] in the [[Italian general election, 1948|1948 elections]].\n\n==CIA career==\n\n===Rise in influence in the CIA===\nReturning to Washington, he was employed by the various successor organizations to the OSS, eventually becoming one of the founder-officers of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. In May 1949, he was made head of Staff A of the CIA's [[Office of Special Operations]], where he was responsible for the collection of foreign intelligence and liaison with the CIA's counterpart organizations. Beginning in 1951, Angleton was responsible for liaison with [[Israel]]'s [[Mossad]] and [[Shin Bet]] agencies, \"the Israeli desk\", crucial relationships that he managed for the remainder of his career. During the next five years, Angleton helped put in place the structure of the new Agency and participated, to some extent, in the \"[[Rollback]]\" operations, associated with [[Frank Wisner]] in [[Albania]], [[Poland]] and other countries, concerning all of which Angleton counseled caution and all of which failed. He worked particularly closely with [[Kim Philby]], who being groomed to head the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] MI6, was also in Washington. The Angletons developed a varied social set in Washington, including professional acquaintances like the Philbys, poets, painters and journalists. In 1951, Philby's colleagues [[Guy Burgess]] and [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]] defected to [[Moscow]]. Philby was expelled from Washington, suspected of having tipped them off to imminent exposure based on decoded Soviet communications from the [[Venona project]].\n\n===Chief of the counterintelligence staff of the CIA===\nIn 1954 [[Allen Dulles]], who had recently become [[Director of Central Intelligence]], named Angleton chief of the Counterintelligence Staff, a position that Angleton retained for the rest of his CIA career. Dulles also assigned Angleton responsibility for coordination with allied intelligence services. In general, Angleton's career at CIA can be divided into three areas of responsibility: foreign intelligence activities, counterintelligence and domestic intelligence activities.\n\nUnder the heading of foreign intelligence, there was the [[Israeli desk]], the [[\"Lovestone Empire\"]] and a variety of smaller operations. The Israeli connection was at first of interest to Angleton, for the information that could be obtained about the Soviet Union and aligned countries, from \u00e9migr\u00e9s to Israel from those countries and for the utility of the Israeli foreign intelligence units, for proxy operations in third countries. Angleton's connections with the Israeli secret intelligence services were useful, for example, in obtaining from the Israeli [[Shin Bet]] a transcript of [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|1956 speech]] to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] [[20th Congress of the CPSU|Congress]] denouncing [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref>''Haaretz'', 11/3/2006</ref> The ''Lovestone Empire'' is a term for the network run for the CIA by [[Jay Lovestone]], once head of the [[Communist Party of the United States]], later a [[trade union]] leader, who worked with foreign unions, using covert funds to construct a worldwide system of [[anti-communist]] unions. Finally, there were individual agents, especially in Italy, who reported to Angleton.<ref>Ted Morgan, ''A Covert Life: Jay Lovestone, Communist, Anti-Communist, and Spymaster'', New York: Random House, 1999.</ref> It is quite possible that there were other foreign intelligence activities for which Angleton was responsible, for example, in [[Southeast Asia]] and in the [[Caribbean]].\n\nAngleton's primary responsibilities as chief of the counterintelligence staff of the CIA have given rise to a considerable literature focused on his efforts to identify any Soviet or [[Eastern Bloc]] agents, working in American secret intelligence agencies. As such agents have come to be called \"moles\", operations intended to find them have come to be called \"Molehunts\".\n\nThree books dealing with Angleton take these matters as their central theme: [[Tom Mangold]]'s ''[[Cold Warrior: James Jesus Angleton: The CIA's Master Spy Hunter]]'', David C. Martin's ''[[Wilderness of Mirrors: Intrigue, Deception, and the Secrets that Destroyed Two of the Cold War's Most Important Agents]]'' and [[David Wise (journalist)|David Wise]]'s ''[[Molehunt: The Secret Search for Traitors that Shattered the CIA]]''. [[Tim Weiner]]'s ''[[Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA]]'' paints Angleton as an incompetent alcoholic.<ref name=\"Wall Street Journal; July 14, 2007\">{{cite news |last=Epstein |first=Edward Jay |author-link=Edward Jay Epstein |date=July 14, 2007 |title=Opening Up the CIA; Espionage, covert action and the trouble with 'dangles' |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118436115647966211 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |location= |access-date=September 28, 2007}}</ref> These views have been challenged by [[Mark Riebling]] in ''[[Wedge: The Secret War between the FBI and CIA]]''.\n\nAngleton thought that all secret intelligence agencies should be assumed to be penetrated by others, or, at least, that a reasonable chief of counterintelligence should assume so.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Angleton had direct experience of ways in which secret intelligence services could be penetrated.{{sfn|Robarge|2003|pp=32\u201335}} There was the manipulation of the German services in World War II by means of Ultra; there was the direct penetration of the British services by the [[Cambridge Five]] and their indirect penetration of the American services by means of the liaison activities of [[Kim Philby]], [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]] and perhaps others, and there were the highly successful efforts of the American secret intelligence services in regard to allied, hostile and [[Third World]] services. The combination of Angleton's close association with Philby and Philby's duplicity caused Angleton to double-check \"potential problems\". Philby was confirmed as a Soviet mole, when he eluded those sent to capture him and defected. Philby said that Angleton had been \"a brilliant opponent\" and a fascinating friend who seemed to be \"catching on\" before Philby's departure, thanks to CIA employee [[William King Harvey]], a former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] agent, who had voiced his suspicions regarding Philby and others, who Angleton suspected were Soviet agents.\n\nAngleton's position in the CIA, his close relationship with [[Richard Helms]], in particular, his experience and character, made him particularly influential. As in all bureaucracies, this influence brought him the enmity of those who had different views. The conflict between the \"Angletonians\" and the \"Anti-Angletonians\" has played out in the public sphere generally in publications about the mole hunts and, in particular, in regard to two Soviet defectors (among many): [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]] and [[Yuri Nosenko]].\n\n===Golitsyn and Nosenko===\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2013}}\nAlthough Golitsyn was a questionable source, Angleton accepted significant information obtained from his debriefing by the CIA. It is claimed that Golitsyn, in asking to defect rather than to become a [[double agent]], implied that the CIA had already been seriously compromised by the KGB. Golitsyn may have concluded that the CIA failed to debrief him correctly because his debriefing was misdirected by a mole in the Soviet Russia Division, limiting his debriefing to a review of photographs of Soviet embassy staff to identify KGB officers and refusing to discuss KGB strategy. After Golitsyn raised this possibility with MI5 in a subsequent debriefing in Britain, MI5 raised the same concern with Angleton, who responded by requesting that DCI [[Richard Helms]] allow him to assume responsibility for Golitsyn and his further debriefing.\n\nIn 1964, [[Yuri Nosenko]], a KGB officer working out of [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], insisted that he needed to defect to the US, as his role as a double agent had been discovered, prompting his recall to Moscow. Nosenko was allowed to defect, although his credibility was immediately in question because the CIA was unable to verify a KGB recall order. Nosenko made two controversial claims: that Golitsyn was not a defector but a KGB plant, and that he had information on the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] by way of the KGB's history with [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] during the time that Oswald lived in the [[Soviet Union]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nRegarding the first claim, Golitsyn had said from the beginning that the KGB would try to plant other defectors in an effort to discredit him. Regarding the second, Nosenko told his debriefers that he had been personally responsible for handling Oswald's case and that the KGB had judged Oswald unfit for service due to his mental instability. Nosenko claimed that the KGB had not even attempted to debrief Oswald about his work on the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2 spy plane]] during his service in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. Although other KGB sources corroborated Nosenko's story, he repeatedly failed [[polygraph|lie detector]] tests. Judging the claim of not interrogating Oswald about the U-2 improbable, given Oswald's familiarity with the U-2 program, and faced with further challenges to Nosenko's credibility (he also falsely claimed to be a lieutenant colonel, a higher rank than he in fact held), Angleton did not object when David Murphy, then head of the Soviet Russia Division, ordered Nosenko held in solitary confinement for approximately three-and-a-half years.\n\nContrary to some accounts, the detention of Nosenko was neither ordered by Angleton nor kept secret. Without naming Nosenko, the 1975 report of the Rockefeller Commission, also known as the [[United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States|President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States]], affirmed that the [[Organizational structure of the Central Intelligence Agency#Directorate of Support|CIA's Office of Security]], which is responsible for the safety of defectors, the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), the [[United States Intelligence Board]], and select members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] were all apprised of Nosenko's detention. Nosenko never changed his story. The \"Monster Plot\" report about Nosenko's detainment and handling, written by John Hart, was feared by him and CIA lawyers to be libelous due to including \"literally irrelevant\" information and \"dramatic rhetorical phrases.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2017/oct/20/angleton-monster-plot/|title=James Angleton and the author of report that \"debunked\" his work agreed on one thing - the report was libel}}</ref>\n\n===Suspicion of infiltration===\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2013}}\nAngleton became increasingly convinced that the CIA was compromised by the KGB.<ref name=\"BeardenRisen2003\">{{cite book|last1=Bearden|first1=Milton|last2=Risen|first2=James|title=The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB|url=https://archive.org/details/mainenemyinsides00bear|url-access=registration|accessdate=15 November 2013|date=2003|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-1588363060|page=[https://archive.org/details/mainenemyinsides00bear/page/38 38]}}</ref> Golitsyn convinced him that the KGB had reorganized in 1958 and 1959 to consist mostly of a shell, incorporating only those agents whom the CIA and the FBI were recruiting, directed by a small cabal of puppet masters who doubled those agents to manipulate their Western counterparts. Hoover eventually curbed cooperation with the CIA, because Angleton refused to relent on this hypothesis. Angleton also came into increasing conflict with the rest of the CIA, particularly with the Directorate of Operations, over the efficacy of their intelligence-gathering efforts, which he questioned without explaining his broader views on KGB strategy and organization. DCI Helms was not willing to tolerate the resulting paralysis. Golitsyn, who was after all a major in the KGB and had defected years before, was able to marshal few facts to provide concrete support for his far-reaching theoretical views of the KGB. The senior leadership of the CIA came to this conclusion after a hearing in 1968 and Angleton was thereafter unable to draw directly upon Golitsyn.\n\nIn the period of the [[Vietnam War]] and Soviet-American [[d\u00e9tente]], Angleton was convinced of the necessity of the war and believed that the strategic calculations underlying the resumption of relations with [[People's Republic of China|China]] were based on a deceptive KGB staging of the Sino-Soviet split. He went so far as to speculate that [[Henry Kissinger]] might be under KGB influence.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/espionage-is-sublime-onscreen-but-hardly-ever-changes-history/article1635023/ Espionage is sublime onscreen, but hardly ever changes history] Jeet Heer, ''Globe and Mail'' 9 July 2010</ref> During this period, Angleton's counter-intelligence staff undertook a most comprehensive domestic covert surveillance project (called [[Operation CHAOS]]) under the direction of President [[Lyndon Johnson]]. The prevailing belief at the time was that the anti-war and civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s had foreign funding and support. None was found by them, although the Soviet Union did influence the movements (see [[Soviet influence on the peace movement]]).\n\nDCI [[William Colby]] reorganized the CIA in an effort to curb Angleton's influence, beginning by stripping him of control over the Israeli \"account\", which had the effect of weakening counter-intelligence. Colby then demanded Angleton's resignation. It has been claimed that Angleton directed CIA assistance to the [[Israel and weapons of mass destruction|Israeli nuclear weapons program]].<ref>See Samuel Katz, ''Soldier Spies'', 1992.</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s Angleton privately accused various foreign leaders of being Soviet spies. He twice informed the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] that he believed [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Lester B. Pearson|Lester Pearson]] and his successor [[Pierre Trudeau]] to be agents of the Soviet Union. In 1964, under pressure from Angleton, the RCMP detained [[John Watkins (Canadian diplomat)|John Watkins]], a close friend of Pearson and formerly Canadian Ambassador to the Soviet Union; Watkins died during interrogation by the RCMP and the CIA and was subsequently cleared of suspicion. Angleton accused Swedish [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] [[Olof Palme]], [[West Germany|West German]] [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Willy Brandt]] and British Prime Minister Harold Wilson of using their access to [[NATO]] secrets to benefit the USSR. Brandt resigned in 1974, after one of his aides was found to be a mole from the [[Stasi|East German secret police]].\n\n===Attempted removal of Gough Whitlam===\nAustralian journalist Brian Toohey claimed that Angleton considered then Australian Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]] a \"serious threat\" to the US and was concerned after the Commonwealth police [[1973 Murphy raids|raided]] [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation|ASIO]] headquarters in Melbourne in 1973 at the direction of [[Attorney_general#Australia|Attorney general]] [[Lionel Murphy]]. In 1974, Angleton sought to instigate the removal of Whitlam from office by having CIA station chief in Canberra, John Walker, ask [[Peter Barbour]], then head of ASIO, to make a false declaration that Whitlam had lied about the raid in Parliament. Barbour refused to make the statement.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Snow |first1=Deborah |title=Tantalising secrets of Australia's intelligence world revealed |url=https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/tantalising-secrets-of-australia-s-intelligence-world-revealed-20190826-p52ku9.html |accessdate=1 October 2019 |publisher=The Age |date=31 August 2019}}</ref> \n\n===Resignation===\n{{More citations needed|date=December 2014}}\n[[Seymour Hersh]] published a story in ''The New York Times'' about domestic counter-intelligence activities under Angleton's direction, against anti-war protesters and other domestic dissident organizations. Following this, Angleton's resignation was announced on Christmas Eve of 1974, just as President Ford demanded that Colby report on the allegations and as various Congressional committees announced that they would launch their own inquiries. Angleton told reporters from [[United Press International]] that he was quitting after 31 years because \"my usefulness has ended\" and the CIA was getting involved in \"[[police state]] activities.\"<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Deseret News|date= 25 December 1974|page= 1A |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=Aul-kAQHnToC&dat=19741225&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=President gets report on CIA spying}}</ref> Three of Angleton's senior aides in counter-intelligence\u2014his deputy Raymond Rocca, executive officer of the counter-intelligence division William J.

Angleton's personal liaisons with [[Italian Mafia]] figures helped the CIA in the immediate period after World War II. Angleton took charge of the CIA's effort to subvert Italian elections, to prevent communist and communist-related parties from gaining political leverage in the [[parliament of Italy|parliament]].\n\n{{quote box |quote =  Deception is a state of mind\u2014and the mind of the state.|\nJames Angleton<ref>[[Edward Jay Epstein|Epstein, Edward Jay.]] ''Deception: The Invisible War between the CIA and the KGB''.

In the wake of his departure, counter-intelligence efforts were undertaken with far less enthusiasm. Some believe this overcompensation was responsible for oversights which allowed [[Aldrich Ames]], [[Robert Hanssen]] and many others to compromise the CIA, the FBI and other agencies long after Angleton's resignation. Although the American intelligence community quickly bounced back from the embarrassments of the Church Committee, it found itself uncharacteristically incapable of policing itself after Angleton's departure.\n\n[[Edward Jay Epstein]] is among those who have argued that the positions of Ames and Hanssen\u2014both well-placed Soviet counter-intelligence agents, in the CIA and FBI respectively\u2014would enable the KGB to deceive the American intelligence community, in the manner that Angleton hypothesized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/question_angleton.htm|title= Was Angleton Right?|last=Epstein|first=Edward Jay|date=30 December 2004 <!-- OR 2001 -->|work=Question of the Week|accessdate=2 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe 1970s were generally a period of upheaval for the CIA. During [[George H. W. Bush|George H. W. Bush's]] tenure as DCI, President Ford authorized the creation of a \"[[Team B]]\" under the aegis of the [[President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board]]. This project concluded that the Agency and the intelligence community had seriously underestimated Soviet strategic nuclear strength in [[Central Europe]] in their [[National Intelligence Estimate]]. The Church Commission brought no small number of skeletons out of the Agency's closet. The organization inherited by [[Stansfield Turner|Admiral Stansfield Turner]] on his appointment as DCI by President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1977, was shortly to face further cuts, and Turner used Angleton as an example of the excesses in the Agency that he hoped to curb, both during his service and in his memoirs.\n\nThe suspicions of Angleton and his staff impeded the career advancement of a number of CIA employees. The CIA later paid out compensation to three, under what Agency employees termed the \"Mole Relief Act\". Forty employees are said to have been investigated and fourteen considered serious suspects by Angleton's staff.<ref>[[Tom Mangold|Mangold, Tom]]. ''[[Cold Warrior: James Jesus Angleton: The CIA's Master Spy Hunter]]''. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1991. {{ISBN|0-671-66273-2}}. p. 246</ref>\n\nWhen Golitsyn defected, he claimed that the CIA had a mole who had been stationed in West Germany, was of [[Slav]]ic descent, had a last name that might end in \"sky\" and definitely began with a \"K\", and operated under the KGB codename \"[[Sasha (espionage)|Sasha]]\". Angleton believed this claim, with the result that anyone who approximated this description fell under his suspicion. Some within CIA considered Golitsyn discredited{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}} even before Angleton's ousting, but the two did not appear to have lost their faith in one another. They sought the assistance of [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] (himself once in the CIA) in authoring ''New Lies for Old'', which advanced the argument that the USSR planned to fake its collapse to lull its enemies into a false sense of victory, but Buckley refused. In his book ''[[Wedge: The Secret War between the FBI and CIA]]'' (Knopf, 1994), [[Mark Riebling]] stated that of 194 predictions made in ''New Lies For Old'', 139 had been fulfilled by 1993, nine seemed 'clearly wrong', and the other 46 were 'not soon [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]]'.\n\nDespite misgivings over his uncompromising and often obsessive approach to his profession, Angleton is highly regarded by a number of his peers in the intelligence business. Former [[Shin Bet]] chief [[Amos Manor]], in an interview in ''[[Ha'aretz]]'', revealed his fascination for the man during Angleton's work to forge the U.S.\u2013Israel liaison in the early 1950s. Manor described Angleton as \"fanatic about everything\", with a \"tendency towards mystification\". Manor discovered decades later that the real reason for Angleton's visit to him was to investigate Manor, being an [[Eastern Europe]]an [[Jew]]ish immigrant, for James Angleton thought that it would be prudent to \"sanitize\" the U.S.\u2013Israeli bridge before a more formal intelligence relationship was established.\n\n==CIA Family Jewels==\n{{main|Family Jewels (Central Intelligence Agency)}}\nA set of highly sensitive Agency documents, referred to as the \"Family Jewels,\" was publicly released on June 25, 2007, after more than three decades of secrecy.<ref name=\"WaPoJun27\">{{cite news |first=Karen |last=DeYoung |authorlink=Karen DeYoung |author2=Walter Pincus |title=CIA Releases Files on Past Misdeeds |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/26/AR2007062600861.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2017-10-26}}</ref><ref name=\"NYTJun26\">{{cite news |title=C.I.A.

His official position within the organization was Associate Deputy Director of Operations for Counterintelligence (ADDOCI). Angleton was significantly involved in the US response to the purported KGB defectors [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]] and [[Yuri Nosenko]]. Angleton later became convinced the CIA harbored a high-ranking [[Mole (espionage)|mole]], and engaged in an intensive search. Whether this was a highly destructive witch hunt or appropriate caution vindicated by later moles remains a subject of intense historical debate.\n\nAccording to  [[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[Richard Helms]]: \"In his day, Jim was recognized as the dominant counterintelligence figure in the non-communist world.\"<ref>Richard Helms, ''A Look over My Shoulder: A Life in the Central Intelligence Agency'' (New York: Random House, 2003), 275.</ref> Investigative journalist [[Edward Jay Epstein]] agrees with the high regard in which Angleton was held by his colleagues in the intelligence business, and adds that Angleton earned the \"trust ... of six CIA directors\u2014including Gen. [[Walter Bedell Smith]], [[Allen W. Dulles]] and [[Richard Helms]]. They kept Angleton in key positions and valued his work.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Epstein|first=Edward Jay|date=2007-07-14|title=Opening Up the CIA|url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB118436115647966211|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Early and personal life==\nJames Jesus Angleton was born in [[Boise, Idaho]], to James Hugh Angleton and Carmen Mercedes Moreno. His parents met in [[Arizona]] while his father was a [[U.S. Army]] [[cavalry]] officer serving under [[John Pershing|General John Pershing]]. His father then joined the National Cash Register Corporation, rising through its ranks until in the early 1930s he purchased the [[NCR Corporation|NCR]] franchise in Italy, where he became head of the [[American Chamber of Commerce]]. During WWII he joined the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS).\n\nAngleton's boyhood was spent in [[Milan]], [[Italy]], where his family moved after his father bought NCR's Italian subsidiary. He then studied as a boarder at [[Malvern College]] in England before attending [[Yale University]]. The young Angleton was a poet and, as a Yale undergraduate, editor, with [[Reed Whittemore]], of the Yale literary magazine ''Furioso'', which published many of the best-known poets of the inter-war period, including [[William Carlos Williams]], [[E. E. Cummings]] and [[Ezra Pound]]. He carried on an extensive correspondence with Pound, Cummings and [[T. S. Eliot]], among others, and was particularly influenced by [[William Empson]], author of ''[[Seven Types of Ambiguity]]''.<ref>Terence Hawkes, \"William Empson's influence on the CIA\", ''Times Literary Supplement'', June 12, 2009, pp. 3\u20135.</ref> Angleton was trained in the [[New Criticism]] at Yale by Maynard Mack and others, chiefly [[Norman Holmes Pearson]], a founder of American Studies, and briefly studied law at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], but did not graduate.<ref>Michael Holzman, ''James Jesus Angleton, the CIA and the Craft of Counterintelligence'', [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 2008, pp. 7\u201330</ref>\n\nHe joined the [[U.S. Army]] in March 1943 and in July 1943 married Cicely Harriet d'Autremont, a [[Vassar College|Vassar]] alumna from [[Tucson, Arizona]]. Together, they had three children: James C.

Angleton was chief of the Italy desk for X-2 in London by February 1944 and in November was transferred to [[Italy]] as commander of SCI [Secret Counterintelligence] Unit Z, which handled [[Ultra]] intelligence based on the British intercepts of German radio communications.\n\nBy the end of the war, he was head of X-2 for all of Italy. In this position Angleton helped [[Junio Valerio Borghese]] escape execution, whose elite unit [[Decima MAS]] had collaborated with the [[SS]].<ref>Tunander, Ola, ''The Secret War Against Sweden: US and British Submarine Deception in the 1980s''. Routledge, 2004, p. 275</ref> Angleton was interested in the defense of installations such as ports and bridges and offered Borghese a fair trial, in return for his collaboration.<ref>Jack Greene & Alessandro Massignani, ''The Black Prince and the Sea Devils: The Story of Valerio Borghese and the Elite Units of the Decima Mas.'' Da Capo Press, 2009 pp. 183 ff.</ref> He dressed him up in an American uniform and drove him from Milan to Rome for interrogation by the Allies. Borghese was then tried and convicted of collaboration with the Nazi invaders but not of war crimes, by the Italian court.\n\nAngleton remained in Italy after the war, establishing connections with other secret intelligence services and playing a major role in the victory of the US-supported [[Christian Democratic Party]], over the USSR-supported [[Italian Communist Party]] in the [[Italian general election, 1948|1948 elections]].\n\n==CIA career==\n\n===Rise in influence in the CIA===\nReturning to Washington, he was employed by the various successor organizations to the OSS, eventually becoming one of the founder-officers of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. In May 1949, he was made head of Staff A of the CIA's [[Office of Special Operations]], where he was responsible for the collection of foreign intelligence and liaison with the CIA's counterpart organizations. Beginning in 1951, Angleton was responsible for liaison with [[Israel]]'s [[Mossad]] and [[Shin Bet]] agencies, \"the Israeli desk\", crucial relationships that he managed for the remainder of his career. During the next five years, Angleton helped put in place the structure of the new Agency and participated, to some extent, in the \"[[Rollback]]\" operations, associated with [[Frank Wisner]] in [[Albania]], [[Poland]] and other countries, concerning all of which Angleton counseled caution and all of which failed. He worked particularly closely with [[Kim Philby]], who being groomed to head the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] MI6, was also in Washington. The Angletons developed a varied social set in Washington, including professional acquaintances like the Philbys, poets, painters and journalists. In 1951, Philby's colleagues [[Guy Burgess]] and [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]] defected to [[Moscow]]. Philby was expelled from Washington, suspected of having tipped them off to imminent exposure based on decoded Soviet communications from the [[Venona project]].\n\n===Chief of the counterintelligence staff of the CIA===\nIn 1954 [[Allen Dulles]], who had recently become [[Director of Central Intelligence]], named Angleton chief of the Counterintelligence Staff, a position that Angleton retained for the rest of his CIA career. Dulles also assigned Angleton responsibility for coordination with allied intelligence services. In general, Angleton's career at CIA can be divided into three areas of responsibility: foreign intelligence activities, counterintelligence and domestic intelligence activities.\n\nUnder the heading of foreign intelligence, there was the [[Israeli desk]], the [[\"Lovestone Empire\"]] and a variety of smaller operations. The Israeli connection was at first of interest to Angleton, for the information that could be obtained about the Soviet Union and aligned countries, from \u00e9migr\u00e9s to Israel from those countries and for the utility of the Israeli foreign intelligence units, for proxy operations in third countries. Angleton's connections with the Israeli secret intelligence services were useful, for example, in obtaining from the Israeli [[Shin Bet]] a transcript of [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[On the Personality Cult and its Consequences|1956 speech]] to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] [[20th Congress of the CPSU|Congress]] denouncing [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref>''Haaretz'', 11/3/2006</ref> The ''Lovestone Empire'' is a term for the network run for the CIA by [[Jay Lovestone]], once head of the [[Communist Party of the United States]], later a [[trade union]] leader, who worked with foreign unions, using covert funds to construct a worldwide system of [[anti-communist]] unions. Finally, there were individual agents, especially in Italy, who reported to Angleton.<ref>Ted Morgan, ''A Covert Life: Jay Lovestone, Communist, Anti-Communist, and Spymaster'', New York: Random House, 1999.</ref> It is quite possible that there were other foreign intelligence activities for which Angleton was responsible, for example, in [[Southeast Asia]] and in the [[Caribbean]].\n\nAngleton's primary responsibilities as chief of the counterintelligence staff of the CIA have given rise to a considerable literature focused on his efforts to identify any Soviet or [[Eastern Bloc]] agents, working in American secret intelligence agencies. As such agents have come to be called \"moles\", operations intended to find them have come to be called \"Molehunts\".\n\nThree books dealing with Angleton take these matters as their central theme: [[Tom Mangold]]'s ''[[Cold Warrior: James Jesus Angleton: The CIA's Master Spy Hunter]]'', David C. Martin's ''[[Wilderness of Mirrors: Intrigue, Deception, and the Secrets that Destroyed Two of the Cold War's Most Important Agents]]'' and [[David Wise (journalist)|David Wise]]'s ''[[Molehunt: The Secret Search for Traitors that Shattered the CIA]]''. [[Tim Weiner]]'s ''[[Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA]]'' paints Angleton as an incompetent alcoholic.<ref name=\"Wall Street Journal; July 14, 2007\">{{cite news |last=Epstein |first=Edward Jay |author-link=Edward Jay Epstein |date=July 14, 2007 |title=Opening Up the CIA; Espionage, covert action and the trouble with 'dangles' |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118436115647966211 |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |location= |access-date=September 28, 2007}}</ref> These views have been challenged by [[Mark Riebling]] in ''[[Wedge: The Secret War between the FBI and CIA]]''.\n\nAngleton thought that all secret intelligence agencies should be assumed to be penetrated by others, or, at least, that a reasonable chief of counterintelligence should assume so.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Angleton had direct experience of ways in which secret intelligence services could be penetrated.{{sfn|Robarge|2003|pp=32\u201335}} There was the manipulation of the German services in World War II by means of Ultra; there was the direct penetration of the British services by the [[Cambridge Five]] and their indirect penetration of the American services by means of the liaison activities of [[Kim Philby]], [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Donald Maclean]] and perhaps others, and there were the highly successful efforts of the American secret intelligence services in regard to allied, hostile and [[Third World]] services. The combination of Angleton's close association with Philby and Philby's duplicity caused Angleton to double-check \"potential problems\". Philby was confirmed as a Soviet mole, when he eluded those sent to capture him and defected. Philby said that Angleton had been \"a brilliant opponent\" and a fascinating friend who seemed to be \"catching on\" before Philby's departure, thanks to CIA employee [[William King Harvey]], a former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] agent, who had voiced his suspicions regarding Philby and others, who Angleton suspected were Soviet agents.\n\nAngleton's position in the CIA, his close relationship with [[Richard Helms]], in particular, his experience and character, made him particularly influential. As in all bureaucracies, this influence brought him the enmity of those who had different views. The conflict between the \"Angletonians\" and the \"Anti-Angletonians\" has played out in the public sphere generally in publications about the mole hunts and, in particular, in regard to two Soviet defectors (among many): [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]] and [[Yuri Nosenko]].\n\n===Golitsyn and Nosenko===\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2013}}\nAlthough Golitsyn was a questionable source, Angleton accepted significant information obtained from his debriefing by the CIA. It is claimed that Golitsyn, in asking to defect rather than to become a [[double agent]], implied that the CIA had already been seriously compromised by the KGB. Golitsyn may have concluded that the CIA failed to debrief him correctly because his debriefing was misdirected by a mole in the Soviet Russia Division, limiting his debriefing to a review of photographs of Soviet embassy staff to identify KGB officers and refusing to discuss KGB strategy. After Golitsyn raised this possibility with MI5 in a subsequent debriefing in Britain, MI5 raised the same concern with Angleton, who responded by requesting that DCI [[Richard Helms]] allow him to assume responsibility for Golitsyn and his further debriefing.\n\nIn 1964, [[Yuri Nosenko]], a KGB officer working out of [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], insisted that he needed to defect to the US, as his role as a double agent had been discovered, prompting his recall to Moscow. Nosenko was allowed to defect, although his credibility was immediately in question because the CIA was unable to verify a KGB recall order. Nosenko made two controversial claims: that Golitsyn was not a defector but a KGB plant, and that he had information on the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination]] of [[President of the United States|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] by way of the KGB's history with [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] during the time that Oswald lived in the [[Soviet Union]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nRegarding the first claim, Golitsyn had said from the beginning that the KGB would try to plant other defectors in an effort to discredit him. Regarding the second, Nosenko told his debriefers that he had been personally responsible for handling Oswald's case and that the KGB had judged Oswald unfit for service due to his mental instability. Nosenko claimed that the KGB had not even attempted to debrief Oswald about his work on the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2 spy plane]] during his service in the [[United States Marine Corps]]. Although other KGB sources corroborated Nosenko's story, he repeatedly failed [[polygraph|lie detector]] tests. Judging the claim of not interrogating Oswald about the U-2 improbable, given Oswald's familiarity with the U-2 program, and faced with further challenges to Nosenko's credibility (he also falsely claimed to be a lieutenant colonel, a higher rank than he in fact held), Angleton did not object when David Murphy, then head of the Soviet Russia Division, ordered Nosenko held in solitary confinement for approximately three-and-a-half years.\n\nContrary to some accounts, the detention of Nosenko was neither ordered by Angleton nor kept secret. Without naming Nosenko, the 1975 report of the Rockefeller Commission, also known as the [[United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States|President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States]], affirmed that the [[Organizational structure of the Central Intelligence Agency#Directorate of Support|CIA's Office of Security]], which is responsible for the safety of defectors, the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), the [[United States Intelligence Board]], and select members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] were all apprised of Nosenko's detention. Nosenko never changed his story. The \"Monster Plot\" report about Nosenko's detainment and handling, written by John Hart, was feared by him and CIA lawyers to be libelous due to including \"literally irrelevant\" information and \"dramatic rhetorical phrases.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2017/oct/20/angleton-monster-plot/|title=James Angleton and the author of report that \"debunked\" his work agreed on one thing - the report was libel}}</ref>\n\n===Suspicion of infiltration===\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2013}}\nAngleton became increasingly convinced that the CIA was compromised by the KGB.<ref name=\"BeardenRisen2003\">{{cite book|last1=Bearden|first1=Milton|last2=Risen|first2=James|title=The Main Enemy: The Inside Story of the CIA's Final Showdown with the KGB|url=https://archive.org/details/mainenemyinsides00bear|url-access=registration|accessdate=15 November 2013|date=2003|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-1588363060|page=[https://archive.org/details/mainenemyinsides00bear/page/38 38]}}</ref> Golitsyn convinced him that the KGB had reorganized in 1958 and 1959 to consist mostly of a shell, incorporating only those agents whom the CIA and the FBI were recruiting, directed by a small cabal of puppet masters who doubled those agents to manipulate their Western counterparts. Hoover eventually curbed cooperation with the CIA, because Angleton refused to relent on this hypothesis. Angleton also came into increasing conflict with the rest of the CIA, particularly with the Directorate of Operations, over the efficacy of their intelligence-gathering efforts, which he questioned without explaining his broader views on KGB strategy and organization. DCI Helms was not willing to tolerate the resulting paralysis. Golitsyn, who was after all a major in the KGB and had defected years before, was able to marshal few facts to provide concrete support for his far-reaching theoretical views of the KGB. The senior leadership of the CIA came to this conclusion after a hearing in 1968 and Angleton was thereafter unable to draw directly upon Golitsyn.\n\nIn the period of the [[Vietnam War]] and Soviet-American [[d\u00e9tente]], Angleton was convinced of the necessity of the war and believed that the strategic calculations underlying the resumption of relations with [[People's Republic of China|China]] were based on a deceptive KGB staging of the Sino-Soviet split. He went so far as to speculate that [[Henry Kissinger]] might be under KGB influence.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/espionage-is-sublime-onscreen-but-hardly-ever-changes-history/article1635023/ Espionage is sublime onscreen, but hardly ever changes history] Jeet Heer, ''Globe and Mail'' 9 July 2010</ref> During this period, Angleton's counter-intelligence staff undertook a most comprehensive domestic covert surveillance project (called [[Operation CHAOS]]) under the direction of President [[Lyndon Johnson]]. The prevailing belief at the time was that the anti-war and civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s had foreign funding and support. None was found by them, although the Soviet Union did influence the movements (see [[Soviet influence on the peace movement]]).\n\nDCI [[William Colby]] reorganized the CIA in an effort to curb Angleton's influence, beginning by stripping him of control over the Israeli \"account\", which had the effect of weakening counter-intelligence. Colby then demanded Angleton's resignation. It has been claimed that Angleton directed CIA assistance to the [[Israel and weapons of mass destruction|Israeli nuclear weapons program]].<ref>See Samuel Katz, ''Soldier Spies'', 1992.</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s Angleton privately accused various foreign leaders of being Soviet spies. He twice informed the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] that he believed [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Lester B. Pearson|Lester Pearson]] and his successor [[Pierre Trudeau]] to be agents of the Soviet Union. In 1964, under pressure from Angleton, the RCMP detained [[John Watkins (Canadian diplomat)|John Watkins]], a close friend of Pearson and formerly Canadian Ambassador to the Soviet Union; Watkins died during interrogation by the RCMP and the CIA and was subsequently cleared of suspicion. Angleton accused Swedish [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] [[Olof Palme]], [[West Germany|West German]] [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Willy Brandt]] and British Prime Minister Harold Wilson of using their access to [[NATO]] secrets to benefit the USSR. Brandt resigned in 1974, after one of his aides was found to be a mole from the [[Stasi|East German secret police]].\n\n===Attempted removal of Gough Whitlam===\nAustralian journalist Brian Toohey claimed that Angleton considered then Australian Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]] a \"serious threat\" to the US and was concerned after the Commonwealth police [[1973 Murphy raids|raided]] [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation|ASIO]] headquarters in Melbourne in 1973 at the direction of [[Attorney_general#Australia|Attorney general]] [[Lionel Murphy]]. In 1974, Angleton sought to instigate the removal of Whitlam from office by having CIA station chief in Canberra, John Walker, ask [[Peter Barbour]], then head of ASIO, to make a false declaration that Whitlam had lied about the raid in Parliament. Barbour refused to make the statement.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Snow |first1=Deborah |title=Tantalising secrets of Australia's intelligence world revealed |url=https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/tantalising-secrets-of-australia-s-intelligence-world-revealed-20190826-p52ku9.html |accessdate=1 October 2019 |publisher=The Age |date=31 August 2019}}</ref> \n\n===Resignation===\n{{More citations needed|date=December 2014}}\n[[Seymour Hersh]] published a story in ''The New York Times'' about domestic counter-intelligence activities under Angleton's direction, against anti-war protesters and other domestic dissident organizations. Following this, Angleton's resignation was announced on Christmas Eve of 1974, just as President Ford demanded that Colby report on the allegations and as various Congressional committees announced that they would launch their own inquiries. Angleton told reporters from [[United Press International]] that he was quitting after 31 years because \"my usefulness has ended\" and the CIA was getting involved in \"[[police state]] activities.\"<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Deseret News|date= 25 December 1974|page= 1A |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=Aul-kAQHnToC&dat=19741225&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=President gets report on CIA spying}}</ref> Three of Angleton's senior aides in counter-intelligence\u2014his deputy Raymond Rocca, executive officer of the counter-intelligence division William J.

Angleton's personal liaisons with [[Italian Mafia]] figures helped the CIA in the immediate period after World War II. Angleton took charge of the CIA's effort to subvert Italian elections, to prevent communist and communist-related parties from gaining political leverage in the [[parliament of Italy|parliament]].\n\n{{quote box |quote =  Deception is a state of mind\u2014and the mind of the state.|\nJames Angleton<ref>[[Edward Jay Epstein|Epstein, Edward Jay.]] ''Deception: The Invisible War between the CIA and the KGB''.

In the wake of his departure, counter-intelligence efforts were undertaken with far less enthusiasm. Some believe this overcompensation was responsible for oversights which allowed [[Aldrich Ames]], [[Robert Hanssen]] and many others to compromise the CIA, the FBI and other agencies long after Angleton's resignation. Although the American intelligence community quickly bounced back from the embarrassments of the Church Committee, it found itself uncharacteristically incapable of policing itself after Angleton's departure.\n\n[[Edward Jay Epstein]] is among those who have argued that the positions of Ames and Hanssen\u2014both well-placed Soviet counter-intelligence agents, in the CIA and FBI respectively\u2014would enable the KGB to deceive the American intelligence community, in the manner that Angleton hypothesized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/question_angleton.htm|title= Was Angleton Right?|last=Epstein|first=Edward Jay|date=30 December 2004 <!-- OR 2001 -->|work=Question of the Week|accessdate=2 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe 1970s were generally a period of upheaval for the CIA. During [[George H. W. Bush|George H. W. Bush's]] tenure as DCI, President Ford authorized the creation of a \"[[Team B]]\" under the aegis of the [[President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board]]. This project concluded that the Agency and the intelligence community had seriously underestimated Soviet strategic nuclear strength in [[Central Europe]] in their [[National Intelligence Estimate]]. The Church Commission brought no small number of skeletons out of the Agency's closet. The organization inherited by [[Stansfield Turner|Admiral Stansfield Turner]] on his appointment as DCI by President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1977, was shortly to face further cuts, and Turner used Angleton as an example of the excesses in the Agency that he hoped to curb, both during his service and in his memoirs.\n\nThe suspicions of Angleton and his staff impeded the career advancement of a number of CIA employees. The CIA later paid out compensation to three, under what Agency employees termed the \"Mole Relief Act\". Forty employees are said to have been investigated and fourteen considered serious suspects by Angleton's staff.<ref>[[Tom Mangold|Mangold, Tom]].

Angleton believed this claim, with the result that anyone who approximated this description fell under his suspicion. Some within CIA considered Golitsyn discredited{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}} even before Angleton's ousting, but the two did not appear to have lost their faith in one another. They sought the assistance of [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] (himself once in the CIA) in authoring ''New Lies for Old'', which advanced the argument that the USSR planned to fake its collapse to lull its enemies into a false sense of victory, but Buckley refused. In his book ''[[Wedge: The Secret War between the FBI and CIA]]'' (Knopf, 1994), [[Mark Riebling]] stated that of 194 predictions made in ''New Lies For Old'', 139 had been fulfilled by 1993, nine seemed 'clearly wrong', and the other 46 were 'not soon [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]]'.\n\nDespite misgivings over his uncompromising and often obsessive approach to his profession, Angleton is highly regarded by a number of his peers in the intelligence business. Former [[Shin Bet]] chief [[Amos Manor]], in an interview in ''[[Ha'aretz]]'', revealed his fascination for the man during Angleton's work to forge the U.S.\u2013Israel liaison in the early 1950s. Manor described Angleton as \"fanatic about everything\", with a \"tendency towards mystification\". Manor discovered decades later that the real reason for Angleton's visit to him was to investigate Manor, being an [[Eastern Europe]]an [[Jew]]ish immigrant, for James Angleton thought that it would be prudent to \"sanitize\" the U.S.\u2013Israeli bridge before a more formal intelligence relationship was established.\n\n==CIA Family Jewels==\n{{main|Family Jewels (Central Intelligence Agency)}}\nA set of highly sensitive Agency documents, referred to as the \"Family Jewels,\" was publicly released on June 25, 2007, after more than three decades of secrecy.<ref name=\"WaPoJun27\">{{cite news |first=Karen |last=DeYoung |authorlink=Karen DeYoung |author2=Walter Pincus |title=CIA Releases Files on Past Misdeeds |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/26/AR2007062600861.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2017-10-26}}</ref><ref name=\"NYTJun26\">{{cite news |title=C.I.A.

After the war he was active within the [[National Union of Teachers]].\n\n==Political career==\nInitially a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]], he became a member in 1908 of [[Epsom Urban District Council]] and in 1914 of Surrey County Council. During [[World War I]] he moved to the Labour Party.  He was charter mayor of [[Epsom and Ewell]] in 1937.\n\nAfter fighting [[Epsom (UK Parliament constituency)|Epsom]] in [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]], he was first elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] as Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Mitcham (UK Parliament constituency)|Mitcham]], at [[1923 Mitcham by-election|a by-election]] in March 1923. However, he lost the seat in December at the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]]. He returned to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] at the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]], for the [[Tyneside]] seat of [[South Shields (UK Parliament constituency)|South Shields]], but was defeated again at the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 election]]. He was re-elected at the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], and held the seat until his retirement from the Commons at the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]]. During the 1930s, he became the Labour Party's main specialist in the field of education, following [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 3rd Baronet|Charles Trevelyan]], who had encouraged Ede by appointing him to chair a government committee on private schools <ref>{{cite book |last=Barker |first=Rodney |date=1972 |title=Education and Politics, 1900-1951 |publisher=Oxford UP}}</ref>.\n\nIn the wartime coalition he held junior ministerial office as [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education]], under two [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Secretary of State for Education|Presidents]], first [[Herwald Ramsbotham, 1st Viscount Soulbury|Herwald Ramsbotham]], and then [[Rab Butler|RA Butler]]. With Butler, he steered the [[Education Act 1944]] through Parliament, and it is clear that his detailed knowledge of state education, which Butler lacked, was crucial to the success of this measure <ref>{{cite thesis |last=Evans |first=Robert |date=1993 |title=James Chuter Ede and the Making of the 1944 Education Act |type=MA dissertation|publisher=Institute of Education, London}}</ref>.  There remained considerable cross-party respect between the two men <ref name=hart> </ref>.\n\nHe was [[Home Secretary]] in the [[Labour Government 1945-1951|1945 Labour government]] of [[Clement Attlee]], and concurrently [[Leader of the House of Commons]] in 1951. He was responsible for restructuring several public services, through the [[Police Act 1946]], the [[Fire Services Act 1947]], the [[Civil Defence Act 1948]], and the Justices of the Peace Act 1949.  In addition, he was closely involved in the [[Children Act 1948]], the [[British Nationality Act 1948]], the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]],  and the Criminal Justice Act 1948.  He established the [[Lynskey tribunal]] under Sir [[George Lynskey]] in 1948 to investigate allegations of corruption among ministers and civil servants.\n\nIn 1964 he left the Commons and was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Chuter-Ede''', of Epsom in the County of Surrey.\n\n==Capital punishment==\n\nIn 1938, Chuter Ede voted for a motion in favour of abolishing the death penalty for [[murder]]. This did not result in any change in the law but, when he was Home Secretary, his own Criminal Justice Bill in 1948 was successfully amended by MPs who wished to abolish [[hanging]]. However, by this time Chuter Ede, in line with the policy of the Attlee Government, opposed the reform. For a while he agreed to commute every death sentence to [[life imprisonment]], but the [[House of Lords]] then rejected the amendment, and the Criminal Justice Act 1948 did not abolish capital punishment.  He permitted hangings to continue.\n\nIn 1950 [[Timothy Evans]] was convicted of murdering his own daughter, and Chuter Ede approved his death sentence. In 1953, after [[John Christie (murderer)|John Christie]] had been convicted and hanged for a murder committed in the same house (and it was clear he had committed several others), Chuter Ede eventually concluded that he had made the wrong decision in regard to Evans.\n\nHe took part in the campaign for a pardon for Evans, and ended his career supporting the cause of abolition.  In November 1965, capital punishment for murder was abolished by the [[Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965]], and Evans's body was transferred to consecrated ground, shortly before Chuter Ede's death.

\u2013 11 November 1965) was a British teacher, trade unionist and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] politician. He served as [[Home Secretary]] under Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] from 1945 to 1951, becoming the longest-serving Home Secretary of the 20th century.\n\n==Early life==\nChuter Ede was born in [[Epsom]], Surrey, the son of James Ede, a [[grocer]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Hermiston |first=Roger |title=All Behind You, Winston \u2013 Churchill's Great Coalition, 1940\u201345 |year=2016 |publisher=Aurum Press |location=London |page=39 |isbn=978-1-78131-664-1}}</ref> of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]] religious convictions, and his wife Agnes Mary (n\u00e9e Chuter). He was educated at Epsom National School, [[The Ashcombe School|Dorking High School for Boys]], Battersea Pupil Teachers' Centre, and [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], where he studied natural sciences. Either through his family background or by a decision when a student, he became a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], and his religion consumed much of his time and effort later in life <ref name=hart>{{cite journal |last=Hart |first=Stephen|title=James Chuter Ede - a Model Unitarian Overlooked |year= 2020 |journal=Transactions of the Unitarian Historical Society |volume=27 |issue=2}}</ref>.\n\nHe then worked as a teacher, becoming an assistant master at council elementary schools in [[Surrey]] from 1905 to 1914, mainly in [[Mortlake]]<ref>Jeffreys, Kevin, [https://doi.org/10.1093/ref:odnb/32414 \"Ede, James Chuter Chuter-, Baron Chuter-Ede (1882\u20131965)\",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, January 2008. Retrieved 19 April 2018 {{subscription}}</ref>. He had to resign this post in 1914, when he stood for election to [[Surrey County Council]], and did not work as a teacher again<ref name=hart></ref>.\n\nDuring the [[First World War]] he served in the [[East Surrey Regiment]] and [[Royal Engineers]], reaching the rank of [[Acting (rank)|Acting]]  [[Regimental Sergeant Major]]. After the war he was active within the [[National Union of Teachers]].\n\n==Political career==\nInitially a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]], he became a member in 1908 of [[Epsom Urban District Council]] and in 1914 of Surrey County Council. During [[World War I]] he moved to the Labour Party.  He was charter mayor of [[Epsom and Ewell]] in 1937.\n\nAfter fighting [[Epsom (UK Parliament constituency)|Epsom]] in [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]], he was first elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] as Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Mitcham (UK Parliament constituency)|Mitcham]], at [[1923 Mitcham by-election|a by-election]] in March 1923. However, he lost the seat in December at the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]]. He returned to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] at the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]], for the [[Tyneside]] seat of [[South Shields (UK Parliament constituency)|South Shields]], but was defeated again at the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 election]]. He was re-elected at the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], and held the seat until his retirement from the Commons at the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 general election]]. During the 1930s, he became the Labour Party's main specialist in the field of education, following [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 3rd Baronet|Charles Trevelyan]], who had encouraged Ede by appointing him to chair a government committee on private schools <ref>{{cite book |last=Barker |first=Rodney |date=1972 |title=Education and Politics, 1900-1951 |publisher=Oxford UP}}</ref>.\n\nIn the wartime coalition he held junior ministerial office as [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education]], under two [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Secretary of State for Education|Presidents]], first [[Herwald Ramsbotham, 1st Viscount Soulbury|Herwald Ramsbotham]], and then [[Rab Butler|RA Butler]]. With Butler, he steered the [[Education Act 1944]] through Parliament, and it is clear that his detailed knowledge of state education, which Butler lacked, was crucial to the success of this measure <ref>{{cite thesis |last=Evans |first=Robert |date=1993 |title=James Chuter Ede and the Making of the 1944 Education Act |type=MA dissertation|publisher=Institute of Education, London}}</ref>.  There remained considerable cross-party respect between the two men <ref name=hart> </ref>.\n\nHe was [[Home Secretary]] in the [[Labour Government 1945-1951|1945 Labour government]] of [[Clement Attlee]], and concurrently [[Leader of the House of Commons]] in 1951. He was responsible for restructuring several public services, through the [[Police Act 1946]], the [[Fire Services Act 1947]], the [[Civil Defence Act 1948]], and the Justices of the Peace Act 1949.  In addition, he was closely involved in the [[Children Act 1948]], the [[British Nationality Act 1948]], the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]],  and the Criminal Justice Act 1948.  He established the [[Lynskey tribunal]] under Sir [[George Lynskey]] in 1948 to investigate allegations of corruption among ministers and civil servants.\n\nIn 1964 he left the Commons and was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Chuter-Ede''', of Epsom in the County of Surrey.\n\n==Capital punishment==\n\nIn 1938, Chuter Ede voted for a motion in favour of abolishing the death penalty for [[murder]]. This did not result in any change in the law but, when he was Home Secretary, his own Criminal Justice Bill in 1948 was successfully amended by MPs who wished to abolish [[hanging]]. However, by this time Chuter Ede, in line with the policy of the Attlee Government, opposed the reform. For a while he agreed to commute every death sentence to [[life imprisonment]], but the [[House of Lords]] then rejected the amendment, and the Criminal Justice Act 1948 did not abolish capital punishment.  He permitted hangings to continue.\n\nIn 1950 [[Timothy Evans]] was convicted of murdering his own daughter, and Chuter Ede approved his death sentence. In 1953, after [[John Christie (murderer)|John Christie]] had been convicted and hanged for a murder committed in the same house (and it was clear he had committed several others), Chuter Ede eventually concluded that he had made the wrong decision in regard to Evans.\n\nHe took part in the campaign for a pardon for Evans, and ended his career supporting the cause of abolition.  In November 1965, capital punishment for murder was abolished by the [[Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965]], and Evans's body was transferred to consecrated ground, shortly before Chuter Ede's death. His campaign was described as \"the last struggle of a liberal nonconformist of the old school\".<ref>Quotation from Kevin Jeffreys, op cit; see also his introduction to ''Labour and the Wartime Coalition'', Historian's Press, 1987.</ref>\n\n==Family==\nChuter Ede married Lilian Mary, daughter of Richard Williams, in 1917. She died in 1948. Lord Chuter-Ede survived her by 17 years and died at [[Ewell]], Surrey, in November 1965, aged 83. [[Chuter Ede Education Centre]] in South Shields is named after him.

More flexibility is observed in other collecting societies, recognizing music under [[Creative Commons licenses]] as long as commercial use is excluded.

These profiles are managed by the artist, with access to various features and tools like stats, notifications about interaction with the music, fan messaging, etc.\n\n== Website ==\nUsers can listen to [[MP3]] encoded audio files (96 kbit/s) and download in [[MP3]] (192kbit/s) and [[Ogg Vorbis]] formats. Listening and downloading is free, unlimited and without any advertisements. The site is available in eight languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Polish, Russian, and Portuguese.\n\nEach user has a personal account in which extended features are available, for example, creating playlists, saving their favorite songs and albums, becoming a fan of an artist, sharing on social networks, reviewing tracks or albums, and following their favorite artists. The website also promotes new music through an editorial feed on the homepage, along with top charts and genre-specific radio channels. A search engine allows users to look for specific artists or titles, but also search by [[Tag (metadata)|tags]], which are chosen by artists to describe their songs (genre, instrument, mood, theme, etc.).\n\nJamendo is integrated within [[Media player (application software)|media players]] like [[VLC media player]], [[Songbird (software)|Songbird]], [[Clementine (software)|Clementine]] and [[Amarok (software)|Amarok 2]]. It was integrated into [[Rhythmbox]] from version 0.9.6 until 2.9x, then removed for technical reasons, but the library can be accessed from Rhythmbox's Grilo plugin.

Jamendo Music intends to provide music for private use only, and Jamendo Licensing is a marketplace where anyone can sell and buy music, whether it's for a multimedia project (television, movie, advertising, video production..) or as background music for commercial space.<ref>{{cite web\n |url          = http://blog.jamendo.com/2015/11/say-hi-to-the-new-jamendo-music.html\n |title        = Say hi to the new Jamendo Music\n |author       = The Jamendo team\n |date         = 4 November 2015\n |publisher    = Jamendo\n |url-status      = dead\n |language     = fr\n |access-date  = 31 March 2017\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170331214034/http://blog.jamendo.com/2015/11/say-hi-to-the-new-jamendo-music.html\n |archive-date = 31 March 2017\n}}</ref>\n\nBy 2018, Jamendo was a subsidiary of Belgian company Audio Valley.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn February 2019 Jamendo has adopted the Independent Management Entity (IME) status<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2019/02/13/jamendo-independent-management-entity-ime/|title=Jamendo Adopts the Independent Management Entity (IME) Status|last=SA|first=Jamendo|date=2019-02-13|website=Digital Music News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-13}}</ref>. Created by the Directive 2014/26/EU transposed in Luxembourg Law in April 2018, the IME legal status allows commercial entities to perform activities similar to national copyright and related rights Collective Management Organizations such as, for copyright, SACEM, SGAE, GEMA and SIAE.\n\n== Sharing music for free ==\nJamendo offers artists the opportunity to publish their music for free under [[Creative Commons licenses]] (and also the [[Free Art License]] in the past).\nIn order to avoid contractual litigation, artists joining Jamendo cannot be registered to any [[Copyright collective|collecting rights society]], such as [[Gesellschaft f\u00fcr musikalische Auff\u00fchrungs- und mechanische Vervielf\u00e4ltigungsrechte|GEMA]] in Germany, [[Sociedad General de Autores y Editores|SGAE]] in Spain, or [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des auteurs, compositeurs et \u00e9diteurs de musique|SACEM]] in France. More flexibility is observed in other collecting societies, recognizing music under [[Creative Commons licenses]] as long as commercial use is excluded. This is notably the case for [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des auteurs, compositeurs et \u00e9diteurs de musique|SACEM]] in France.<ref>{{cite web\n | url    = https://societe.sacem.fr/ressources-presse/par-publication/Communiqu%C3%A9s/la-sacem-et-creative-commons-renouvellent-leur-accord\n | title  = La Sacem et Creative Commons Renouvellent leur Accord\n | date  = 16 September 2013\n | publisher  = SACEM\n | accessdate= 30 March 2017\n | language=fr}}</ref>\nIn the United States, [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] recognize the use of Jamendo by their registered artists.\n\nEach artist has a profile displaying uploaded albums and singles, along with artist information. These profiles are managed by the artist, with access to various features and tools like stats, notifications about interaction with the music, fan messaging, etc.\n\n== Website ==\nUsers can listen to [[MP3]] encoded audio files (96 kbit/s) and download in [[MP3]] (192kbit/s) and [[Ogg Vorbis]] formats. Listening and downloading is free, unlimited and without any advertisements. The site is available in eight languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Polish, Russian, and Portuguese.\n\nEach user has a personal account in which extended features are available, for example, creating playlists, saving their favorite songs and albums, becoming a fan of an artist, sharing on social networks, reviewing tracks or albums, and following their favorite artists. The website also promotes new music through an editorial feed on the homepage, along with top charts and genre-specific radio channels. A search engine allows users to look for specific artists or titles, but also search by [[Tag (metadata)|tags]], which are chosen by artists to describe their songs (genre, instrument, mood, theme, etc.).\n\nJamendo is integrated within [[Media player (application software)|media players]] like [[VLC media player]], [[Songbird (software)|Songbird]], [[Clementine (software)|Clementine]] and [[Amarok (software)|Amarok 2]]. It was integrated into [[Rhythmbox]] from version 0.9.6 until 2.9x, then removed for technical reasons, but the library can be accessed from Rhythmbox's Grilo plugin. Jamendo is not integrated into [[Banshee (media player)|Banshee]] by default, but can be integrated with a plugin.\n\n== Business model ==\nAccording to one article on Jamendo's business model,<ref>{{cite web\n | url    = http://www.teleread.org/blog/?p=6138\n | title  = Jamendo: A business model that works!

Though primarily a bird of hill and mountain forest, it comes down to lower elevations during the dry season where it is more likely to be seen.\n\nThe overall appearance of this species is of a sooty-grey bird, not at all glossy like its near relatives though it does possess a similar dark grey patch of naked skin just behind the eye and a smaller naked patch at the base of the bill. The bill itself is slate-grey and quite deep, tapering to a sharp point. The nasal bristles are relatively sparse usually leaving the nostrils on view. The iris is either grey-brown or red-brown, possibly depending on age. Legs and feet are black.\n\nAnother forest crow by nature, its food requirements contain a significant proportion of fruit taken from trees either in pairs or small groups. It also probes under bark and leaf litter for small [[invertebrates]] etc. and it is known to raid other birds nests of both eggs and nestlings.\n\nThe nest itself is usually built in a tall tree though this species may well use tree holes also as a possible nesting option although little further information is as yet recorded for this species and its breeding habits.\n\nThe voice, like its two nearest relatives is very distinctive and consists of various jabbering and bubbling sounds (thus its common Jamaican Patois name, jabbering crow), but also a more leisurely \u201ccraaa-aa\u201d and variations thereof, and somewhat of a musical burbling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ebird.org/species/jamcro1|title=Jamaican Crow - eBird|website=ebird.org|language=en|access-date=2019-09-11}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Corvidae}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q1586731}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:crow, Jamaican}}\n[[Category:Corvus (genus)|Jamaican crow]]\n[[Category:Endemic birds of Jamaica]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1788|Jamaican crow]]\n", "text_old": "{{speciesbox\n| image = Corvus jamaicensis.jpg\n| image2 = Jamaican_crow.jpg\n| status = LC\n| status_system = IUCN3.1\n| status_ref = <ref>{{cite iucn|url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22706007/0 |title=''Corvus jamaicensis'' |author=BirdLife International |author-link=BirdLife International |year=2012 |access-date=26 November 2013|ref=harv}}</ref>\n| genus = Corvus\n| species = jamaicensis\n| authority = [[Johann Friedrich Gmelin|Gmelin]], 1788\n| range_map = Jamaican crow distribution map.png\n| range_map_caption = Distribution map\n}}\n\nThe '''Jamaican crow''' (''Corvus jamaicensis'') is a comparatively small crow species (35\u201338&nbsp;cm in length).
