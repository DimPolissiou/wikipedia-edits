Two-thirds of the {{convert|7.4|acre|ha|adj=on}} site is landscaping and water.

As one approaches on the left (toward the Pacific arch), the scenes begin with soon-to-be servicemen getting physical exams, taking the oath, and being issued military gear. The reliefs progress through several iconic scenes, including combat and burying the dead, ending in a homecoming scene. On the right-side wall (toward the Atlantic arch) there is a similar progression, but with scenes generally more typical of the European theatre. Some scenes take place in England, depicting the preparations for air and sea assaults. The last scene is of [[Elbe Day|a handshake between the American and Russian armies]] when the western and eastern fronts met in Germany.\n\n===Freedom Wall===\nThe Freedom Wall is on the west side of the plaza, with a view of the [[Reflecting Pool]] and Lincoln Memorial behind it.

Kaptur introduced the World War II Memorial Act to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] as HR 3742 on December 10. The resolution authorized the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]] (ABMC) to establish a World War II memorial in \"Washington, D.C., or its environs\", but the bill was not voted on before the end of the session, so it was not passed. Two more times, in 1989 and 1991, Rep. Kaptur introduced similar legislation, but these bills suffered the same fate as the first and did not become law.\n\nKaptur reintroduced legislation in the House a fourth time as HR 682 on January 27, 1993, one day after Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] (a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] from [[South Carolina]]) introduced companion Senate legislation. On March 17, 1993, the Senate approved the act, and the House approved an amended version of the bill on May 4. On May 12, the Senate also approved the amended bill, and the World War II Memorial Act was signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]] on May 25 of that year, becoming Public Law 103-32.\n\n===Fundraising===\nOn September 30, 1994, President [[Bill Clinton]] appointed a 12-member Memorial Advisory Board (MAB) to advise the ABMC in picking the site, designing the memorial, and raising money to build it. A [[direct mail]] fundraising effort brought in millions of dollars from individual Americans. Additional large donations were made by veterans' groups, including the [[American Legion]], the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]], Veterans of the Battle of the Bulge and others. The majority of the corporate fundraising effort was led by two co-chairs: Senator [[Bob Dole]], a decorated World War II veteran and 1996 Republican nominee for president; and [[Frederick W. Smith]], the [[president (corporate title)|president]] and [[chief executive officer]] of [[FedEx Corporation]] and a former [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] officer. The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] provided about $16 million. A total of $197 million was raised.\n\n===Picking the site===\nOn January 20, 1995, Colonel Kevin C. Kelley, project manager for the ABMC, organized the first meeting of the ABMC and the MAB, at which the project was discussed and initial plans made. The meeting was chaired by Commissioner F. Haydn Williams, chairman of ABMC's World War II Memorial Site and Design Committee, who would go on to guide the project through the site selection and approval process and the selection and approval of the Memorial's design. Representatives from the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts]], the [[National Capital Planning Commission]], the [[National Capital Memorial Commission]], the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], and the National Park Service attended the meeting.The selection of an appropriate site was taken on as the first action.\n\nOver the next months, several sites were considered. Three quickly gained favor:<ref>{{cite news |title=Site-seeking at the Mall: Placing World War II memorial in the grand scheme of things |author=Forgey, Benjamin |work=The Washington Post |page=C1 |date=July 1, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=No Accord on WWII Memorial; Two Agencies Send Mixed Signals About Location |author=Forgey, Benjamin |work=The Washington Post |page=B3 |date=July 28, 1995}}</ref>\n* [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]] [[Capitol Reflection Pool|Reflection Pool]] area \u2013 between 3rd Street and the [[Ulysses S.

The design would incorporate the Rainbow Pool fountain, located across 17th Street from the Washington Monument and near the Constitution Gardens site.<ref>{{cite news |title=WWII Memorial Gets Choice Mall Site; 2nd Panel Approves Location, Clearing Way for Design Phase |author=Forgey, Benjamin |work=The Washington Post |page=B1 |date=October 6, 1995}}</ref>\n\nThe location, between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, is the most prominent spot for a monument on the National Mall since the Lincoln Memorial opened in 1922.

[[Friedrich St. Florian]]'s initial design was selected in 1997. St. Florian's design evokes a classical monument. Under each of the two memorial arches, the Pacific and Atlantic baldacchinos, four eagles carry an oak laurel wreath. Each of the 56 pillars bear wreaths of oak symbolizing military and industrial strength, and of wheat, symbolizing agricultural production.\n\nOver the next four years, St. Florian's design was altered during the review and approval process required of proposed memorials in Washington, D.C. Ambassador Haydn Williams guided the design development for ABMC.\n\n==Construction==\nGround was broken in September 2001.

The reliefs progress through several iconic scenes, including combat and burying the dead, ending in a homecoming scene. On the right-side wall (toward the Atlantic arch) there is a similar progression, but with scenes generally more typical of the European theatre.

Kaptur introduced the World War II Memorial Act to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] as HR 3742 on December 10. The resolution authorized the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]] (ABMC) to establish a World War II memorial in \"Washington, D.C., or its environs\", but the bill was not voted on before the end of the session, so it was not passed. Two more times, in 1989 and 1991, Rep. Kaptur introduced similar legislation, but these bills suffered the same fate as the first and did not become law.\n\nKaptur reintroduced legislation in the House a fourth time as HR 682 on January 27, 1993, one day after Senator [[Strom Thurmond]] (a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] from [[South Carolina]]) introduced companion Senate legislation. On March 17, 1993, the Senate approved the act, and the House approved an amended version of the bill on May 4. On May 12, the Senate also approved the amended bill, and the World War II Memorial Act was signed into law by President [[Bill Clinton]] on May 25 of that year, becoming Public Law 103-32.\n\n===Fundraising===\nOn September 30, 1994, President [[Bill Clinton]] appointed a 12-member Memorial Advisory Board (MAB) to advise the ABMC in picking the site, designing the memorial, and raising money to build it. A [[direct mail]] fundraising effort brought in millions of dollars from individual Americans. Additional large donations were made by veterans' groups, including the [[American Legion]], the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]], Veterans of the Battle of the Bulge and others. The majority of the corporate fundraising effort was led by two co-chairs: Senator [[Bob Dole]], a decorated World War II veteran and 1996 Republican nominee for president; and [[Frederick W. Smith]], the [[president (corporate title)|president]] and [[chief executive officer]] of [[FedEx Corporation]] and a former [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] officer. The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] provided about $16 million. A total of $197 million was raised.\n\n===Picking the site===\nOn January 20, 1995, Colonel Kevin C. Kelley, project manager for the ABMC, organized the first meeting of the ABMC and the MAB, at which the project was discussed and initial plans made. The meeting was chaired by Commissioner F. Haydn Williams, chairman of ABMC's World War II Memorial Site and Design Committee, who would go on to guide the project through the site selection and approval process and the selection and approval of the Memorial's design. Representatives from the [[United States Commission of Fine Arts]], the [[National Capital Planning Commission]], the [[National Capital Memorial Commission]], the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], and the National Park Service attended the meeting.The selection of an appropriate site was taken on as the first action.\n\nOver the next months, several sites were considered.

[[Friedrich St. Florian]]'s initial design was selected in 1997. St. Florian's design evokes a classical monument. Under each of the two memorial arches, the Pacific and Atlantic baldacchinos, four eagles carry an oak laurel wreath. Each of the 56 pillars bear wreaths of oak symbolizing military and industrial strength, and of wheat, symbolizing agricultural production.\n\nOver the next four years, St. Florian's design was altered during the review and approval process required of proposed memorials in Washington, D.C.

A diamond discovery in the river running between the poor township of [[Refilwe]] and the affluent neighbourhood of [[Silver Lakes, Pretoria|Silver Lakes]] quickly turns from a blessing to a curse. When Lindiwe murders Thato Mokoena for the diamond, she sets in motion a tragic set of events that deepen the divide between the haves and the have-nots. The thrill-a-minute telenovela sees worlds collide in spectacular fashion. One side of the river is home to those who will go to any lengths to keep their wealth; the other by those who have little to show for their hard work.\n\n== Plot ==\n''The River''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://channels24.co.za/category/the-river|title=The River latest Episode}}</ref> tells the story of Khanyisa Diamonds mine owner Lindiwe Dlamini-Dikana, who is ruthless and calculating <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pressreader.com/south-africa/drum/20190110/283893049163746|title=Screen superstar Sindi Dlathu on juggling her screen roles|last=Mnganga|first=Tholakele|date=10 January 2019|work=Drum|access-date=}}</ref>, and the extent she will go to in order to protect her family and maintain her lavish lifestyle. Lindiwe is married to provincial police commissioner Zweli Dikana, and is a mother to Andile and Mbali Dikana, step-mother to Nomonde Dikana. The Dikanas live in a mansion in Pretoria East, South Africa.\n\nIn the township of Refilwe, where Khanyisa Diamonds is located, lives poverty stricken residents, many of whom work at the mine. The Mokoena family, consisting of Malefu Mokoena and her children, Thuso, Dimpho and Itumeleng live in Refilwe. Unbeknownst to everyone except Malefu, Tumi is adopted, being found at a river as a baby by her late adoptive father, Thato Mokoena.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\nLindiwe's mine is about to go bankrupt<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LayUyXO-1eM&t=1s|title=The River Episode 1}}</ref>, when one of the foremen, Thato Mokoena finds an alluvial diamond, whose worth is later revealed to be $45 million, in the river that runs through the township of Refilwe while fishing. Lindiwe murders Thato Mokoena and places the diamond in her mine for her miners to find, so that the discovery is made in her land, while also covering up the murder.\n\nMalefu Mokoena struggles to raise her children after her husband's death. Her oldest son, Thuso is frequently in and out of jail. Her adopted daughter, Tumi, marries Lindiwe's nephew, Zolani Dlamini, and moves into the Dikana household. Following their wedding, Lindiwe employs Tumi as the CSR Officer at Khanyisa Diamonds. Lindiwe attempts to steal the land in Refilwe to mine, but her plan is foiled when Tumi dissents, realising Lindiwe's intentions.\n\nMalefu discovers Tumi had a hand in Lindiwe's plan. Malefu disowns Tumi and tells her she was adopted, and gives Tumi the one half of a necklace her birthmother left her with. Tumi divorces Zolani, who reveals that Lindiwe killed her father. Tumi and her new boyfriend, Lindani attempt to find evidence by returning to the Dikana mansion and while searching Lindiwe's desk, Tumi discovers Lindiwe is her biological mother. Tumi attempts to reach Lindiwe so they can talk, but is kidnapped and taken to the mine, where she is buried alive by Lindiwe, who knows that Zolani told Tumi of Thato Mokoena's murder.\n\nLindiwe finds Tumi's message and realising she has buried her own child, attempts suicide by shooting herself.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\nTumi is rescued by Lindani, while Lindiwe makes a full recovery. Tumi subsequently files charges against Lindiwe. Her quest for justice turns sour, as she becomes the prime suspect in the \"attempted murder\" of Lindiwe. Subsequently, Lindiwe files charges against Tumi, arguing in court that Tumi is an agent of white monopoly capital sent to destroy her company.\n\nLindiwe frees Paulina from prison in exchange for Lindani's silence in order to win the case. Her husband finds out she actually did commit the crimes and exiles her to a life of poverty as punishment.\n\nReeling from her parents divorce and her mothers disappearance, Mbali resorts to drugs and is kidnapped by her dealer while Nomonde takes over as the CEO of Khanyisa Diamonds and Zweli turns to a prostitute for company.\n\nAfter rescuing Mbali, Zweli informs his children of Lindiwe's misdeeds. In Refilwe, Cobra and Paulina contest an interim ward election after the councillor died from a heart attack. Paulina is set to win until Percy and Oupa plant fake votes in favour of Cobra.\n\nCobra wins the election and invites Paulina to join the Council. Lindiwe resurfaces in Refilwe and takes up refuge in the shack she grew up in. Everyone of her contacts abandon her when they realise she has lost her power. Tumi finds out Lindiwe is in Refilwe and sets her shack on fire, with Lindiwe inside. Zolani rescues Lindiwe and Sis Flora takes them in out of pity.\n\nLindiwe pretends to have turned over a new leaf and misleads everyone into believing she is a changed person, as she bids her time and calculates her return. Cobra uses his position as councillor to unfairly award tenders. Nomonde struggles to keep the mine afloat while juggling her relationship with Lindani. After Nomonde is nearly killed by the miners, she begins looking for a new CEO for Khanyisa Diamonds.\n\nGail Mathabatha enters the lives of the Dikanas when she is hired as Khanyisa's new CEO. Soon, she is involved in a romantic relationship with Zweli to Lindiwe's chagrin, setting the latter on a quest for everything she holds dear - her family, her marriage and her mine and later on killed by Lindiwe on her wedding day.\n\nThuso together with Percy and Oupa successfully steal Lindiwe's diamonds at the diamond launch which got disrupted by riots. Thuso then gives the diamonds to Lindani who is now Tumi's husband so that he doesn't get caught by police as he knows that he will be the prime suspect.\n\nLindani couldn't keep such a secret so he told his friend Charlie about the stolen diamonds.\nLindiwe and Zolani brutally torture Charlie, for information about the stolen diamonds, they got the information they needed they went to Lindani's house and searched for the stolen diamonds.\nThen they found the diamonds then a drunk and depressed Lindani enters the house and is immediately shot by Lindiwe.\n\nTumi and Mbali overhear a conversation between Lindiwe and Zolani celebrating their successful mission then Tumi plans on a revenge by tampering the car brakes then Mbali cries and fears that her mother is what people call her.

A diamond discovery in the river running between the poor township of [[Refilwe]] and the affluent neighbourhood of [[Silver Lakes, Pretoria|Silver Lakes]] quickly turns from a blessing to a curse. When Lindiwe murders Thato Mokoena for the diamond, she sets in motion a tragic set of events that deepen the divide between the haves and the have-nots. The thrill-a-minute telenovela sees worlds collide in spectacular fashion. One side of the river is home to those who will go to any lengths to keep their wealth; the other by those who have little to show for their hard work.\n\n== Plot ==\n''The River''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://channels24.co.za/the-river-10-february-2020-full-episode-watch-video.html|title=The River Episode today}}</ref> tells the story of Khanyisa Diamonds mine owner Lindiwe Dlamini-Dikana, who is ruthless and calculating <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pressreader.com/south-africa/drum/20190110/283893049163746|title=Screen superstar Sindi Dlathu on juggling her screen roles|last=Mnganga|first=Tholakele|date=10 January 2019|work=Drum|access-date=}}</ref>, and the extent she will go to in order to protect her family and maintain her lavish lifestyle. Lindiwe is married to provincial police commissioner Zweli Dikana, and is a mother to Andile and Mbali Dikana, step-mother to Nomonde Dikana. The Dikanas live in a mansion in Pretoria East, South Africa.\n\nIn the township of Refilwe, where Khanyisa Diamonds is located, lives poverty stricken residents, many of whom work at the mine. The Mokoena family, consisting of Malefu Mokoena and her children, Thuso, Dimpho and Itumeleng live in Refilwe. Unbeknownst to everyone except Malefu, Tumi is adopted, being found at a river as a baby by her late adoptive father, Thato Mokoena.\n\n=== Season 1 ===\nLindiwe's mine is about to go bankrupt<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LayUyXO-1eM&t=1s|title=The River Episode 1}}</ref>, when one of the foremen, Thato Mokoena finds an alluvial diamond, whose worth is later revealed to be $45 million, in the river that runs through the township of Refilwe while fishing. Lindiwe murders Thato Mokoena and places the diamond in her mine for her miners to find, so that the discovery is made in her land, while also covering up the murder.\n\nMalefu Mokoena struggles to raise her children after her husband's death. Her oldest son, Thuso is frequently in and out of jail. Her adopted daughter, Tumi, marries Lindiwe's nephew, Zolani Dlamini, and moves into the Dikana household. Following their wedding, Lindiwe employs Tumi as the CSR Officer at Khanyisa Diamonds. Lindiwe attempts to steal the land in Refilwe to mine, but her plan is foiled when Tumi dissents, realising Lindiwe's intentions.\n\nMalefu discovers Tumi had a hand in Lindiwe's plan. Malefu disowns Tumi and tells her she was adopted, and gives Tumi the one half of a necklace her birthmother left her with. Tumi divorces Zolani, who reveals that Lindiwe killed her father. Tumi and her new boyfriend, Lindani attempt to find evidence by returning to the Dikana mansion and while searching Lindiwe's desk, Tumi discovers Lindiwe is her biological mother. Tumi attempts to reach Lindiwe so they can talk, but is kidnapped and taken to the mine, where she is buried alive by Lindiwe, who knows that Zolani told Tumi of Thato Mokoena's murder.\n\nLindiwe finds Tumi's message and realising she has buried her own child, attempts suicide by shooting herself.\n\n=== Season 2 ===\nTumi is rescued by Lindani, while Lindiwe makes a full recovery. Tumi subsequently files charges against Lindiwe. Her quest for justice turns sour, as she becomes the prime suspect in the \"attempted murder\" of Lindiwe. Subsequently, Lindiwe files charges against Tumi, arguing in court that Tumi is an agent of white monopoly capital sent to destroy her company.\n\nLindiwe frees Paulina from prison in exchange for Lindani's silence in order to win the case. Her husband finds out she actually did commit the crimes and exiles her to a life of poverty as punishment.\n\nReeling from her parents divorce and her mothers disappearance, Mbali resorts to drugs and is kidnapped by her dealer while Nomonde takes over as the CEO of Khanyisa Diamonds and Zweli turns to a prostitute for company.\n\nAfter rescuing Mbali, Zweli informs his children of Lindiwe's misdeeds. In Refilwe, Cobra and Paulina contest an interim ward election after the councillor died from a heart attack. Paulina is set to win until Percy and Oupa plant fake votes in favour of Cobra.\n\nCobra wins the election and invites Paulina to join the Council. Lindiwe resurfaces in Refilwe and takes up refuge in the shack she grew up in. Everyone of her contacts abandon her when they realise she has lost her power. Tumi finds out Lindiwe is in Refilwe and sets her shack on fire, with Lindiwe inside. Zolani rescues Lindiwe and Sis Flora takes them in out of pity.\n\nLindiwe pretends to have turned over a new leaf and misleads everyone into believing she is a changed person, as she bids her time and calculates her return. Cobra uses his position as councillor to unfairly award tenders. Nomonde struggles to keep the mine afloat while juggling her relationship with Lindani. After Nomonde is nearly killed by the miners, she begins looking for a new CEO for Khanyisa Diamonds.\n\nGail Mathabatha enters the lives of the Dikanas when she is hired as Khanyisa's new CEO. Soon, she is involved in a romantic relationship with Zweli to Lindiwe's chagrin, setting the latter on a quest for everything she holds dear - her family, her marriage and her mine and later on killed by Lindiwe on her wedding day.\n\nThuso together with Percy and Oupa successfully steal Lindiwe's diamonds at the diamond launch which got disrupted by riots. Thuso then gives the diamonds to Lindani who is now Tumi's husband so that he doesn't get caught by police as he knows that he will be the prime suspect.\n\nLindani couldn't keep such a secret so he told his friend Charlie about the stolen diamonds.\nLindiwe and Zolani brutally torture Charlie, for information about the stolen diamonds, they got the information they needed they went to Lindani's house and searched for the stolen diamonds.\nThen they found the diamonds then a drunk and depressed Lindani enters the house and is immediately shot by Lindiwe.\n\nTumi and Mbali overhear a conversation between Lindiwe and Zolani celebrating their successful mission then Tumi plans on a revenge by tampering the car brakes then Mbali cries and fears that her mother is what people call her.

[[Niger]], a landlocked [[Sub-Sahara]] African nation, and over the past two decades has consistently been ranked near or at the bottom of worldwide indexes of the [[Human development index]], [[GDP]], and per capita income.  Economic activity centres on subsistence agriculture, animal husbandry, re-export trade, and export of [[uranium]]. The 50% devaluation of the West African CFA franc in January, 1994 boosted exports of [[livestock]], [[cowpea]]s, [[onion]]s, and the products of Niger's small [[cotton]] industry.  Exports of cattle to neighboring [[Nigeria]], as well as [[Macrotyloma geocarpum|Groundnuts]] and their oil remain the primary non-mineral exports.<ref name=ussd2009>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5474.htm Background Notes for Niger: January 2009] Bureau of African Affairs, United States State Department.  Retrieved 2009-02-26.  Portions of the \"Economy\" section are here used verbatim, as this document is in the [[Public Domain]].</ref>\n\n==Overall economy==\nNiger's economy is based largely on [[subsistence crop]]s, livestock, and some of the world's largest uranium deposits. [[Drought]] cycles, [[desertification]], a 3.4% population growth rate and the drop in world demand for uranium have undercut an already marginal economy.<ref name=ussd2009 /> Traditional subsistence farming, herding, small trading, and informal markets dominate an economy that generates few formal sector jobs.  Between 1988 and 1995 28% to 30% of the total economy of Niger was in the unregulated [[Informal sector]], including small and even large scale rural and urban production, transport and services.<ref>C.

A small area in the southern tip of the nation, surrounding [[Gaya, Niger|Gaya]] can expect to receive 700mm to 900mm or rainfall.  Northern areas which support crops, such as the southern portions of the [[A\u00efr Massif]] and the [[Kaouar oasis]] rely upon oases and a slight increase in rainfall due to mountain effects. Large portions of the northwest and far east of the nation, while within the [[Sahara desert]], see just enough seasonal rainfall to support semi-nomadic animal husbandry.  The populations of these areas, mostly [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Wodaabe]] - [[Fula people|Fula]], and [[Toubou]], practise [[Transhumance]]: traveling south to pasture and sell animals in the dry season, north into the Sahara in the brief rainy season, while maintaining settled communities along these routes.<ref name=\"Decalo1997\">{{Cite book\n|last=Decalo\n|first=Samuel\n|title=Historical Dictionary of the Niger (3rd ed.)\n|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Boston & Folkestone\n|year=1997\n|isbn=0-8108-3136-8\n}}</ref>\n[[File:Niger ag land use map USGS.png|thumb|500px|center|Cropland Use Indicator, drawn from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, for period 1986-1988. <br />Scale is: 1= 70% - 100% Crop coverage :: 2= 50% - 70% Crop coverage :: 3= 30% - 50% Crop coverage :: 4= 5% - 30% Crop coverage :: 5= 0% - 5% Crop coverage.]]\n\n==Agriculture production==\n[[Image:Niger millet Koremairwa 1214.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A farmer collecting his [[millet]] harvest near [[Koremairwa]] in the [[Dosso (department)|Dosso]] department.]]\nNiger's agricultural and livestock sectors are the mainstay of all but 18% of the population.<ref name=ussd2009 /> Fourteen percent of Niger's GDP is generated by livestock production (camels, goats, sheep and cattle), said to support 29% of the population. Thus 53% of the population is actively involved in crop production.<ref name=ussd2009 /> The 15% of Niger's land that is arable is found mainly along its southern border with Nigeria.\n\n[[Pearl millet]], sorghum, and cassava are Niger's principal rain-fed subsistence crops. Irrigated rice for internal consumption, while expensive, has, since the devaluation of the CFA franc, sold for below the price of imported rice, encouraging additional production. Cowpeas and onions are grown for commercial export, as are small quantities of garlic, peppers, potatoes, and wheat.<ref name=ussd2009 />\n\n==Drought and environmental degradation==\n[[File:Niger Farm sand tv 16aug05.jpg|thumb|right|\"Drought has turned farmland into useless soil and sand\" A farmer examines the soil in drought stricken Niger during the 2005 famine.]]\n[[File:Niger nomads flee drought 16 aug 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Nomads leaving for Nigeria with their herds, Dakoro Department, Niger, 2005.]]\nRainfall varies and when insufficient, Niger has difficulty feeding its population and must rely on grain purchases and food aid to meet food requirements.<ref name=ussd2009 /> Rains, as in much of the [[Sahel]], have been marked by annual variability. This has been especially true in the 20th century, with the [[Sahel drought|most severe drought on record]] beginning in the late 1960s and lasting, with one break, well into the 1980s. The long-term effect of this, especially to [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] populations remains in the 21st century, with those communities which rely upon cattle, sheep, and camels husbandry losing entire herds more than once during this period.  Recent rains remain variable.  For instance, the rains in 2000 were not good, those in 2001 were plentiful and well distributed.\n\nFood shortfalls have also been caused by other factors.  Market prices driven up by [[drought]] and a [[Overpopulation (animals)#Wild animal overpopulation|plague]] of [[desert locust]] in 2005&ndash;2006 caused [[2005\u201306 Niger food crisis|a major food crisis]] in parts of the nation.\n\nShortage of good farmland has led to a number of innovations to farm marginal, often [[laterite]] soils  and soil degraded by [[overfarming]], wind, [[desertification]], and drought.  Women in particular are often given poor plots of land (in inherited sections known as \"''Gamana''\") to garden, and have developed specific crops for poor soil and water conditions. These typically include ocra and malahiya. External organisations have tried introducing alternative crops, such as the fruit of the [[Ziziphus mauritania]] tree (\"''Indian Jujube''\", marketed by the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) under the name of \"''Pomme du Sahel''\" or Sahel Apple) and the leaves and seeds of the [[Moringa|Moringa oleifera]].  Farmers use specialty water conservation techniques, \"water microcatchments\" or planting pits known as ''zai holes'', planting of crops among certain trees, planting in raised beds, [[drip irrigation]], and usage of water collected in the natural stone bottomed low areas common in the south east of the nation. This approach has been termed the [[Bioreclamation of Degraded Lands]].<ref>[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/PSLG-7TCJF2?OpenDocument Niger: Reclaiming \u2018useless\u2019 lands gives new lifeline to West Africa\u2019s sidelined women farmers].

[[Niger]], a landlocked [[Sub-Sahara]] African nation, and over the past two decades has consistently been ranked near or at the bottom of worldwide indexes of the [[Human development index]], [[GDP]], and per capita income.  Economic activity centres on subsistence agriculture, animal husbandry, re-export trade, and export of [[uranium]]. The 50% devaluation of the West African CFA franc in January, 1994 boosted exports of [[livestock]], [[cowpea]]s, [[onion]]s, and the products of Niger's small [[cotton]] industry.  Exports of cattle to neighboring [[Nigeria]], as well as [[Macrotyloma geocarpum|Groundnuts]] and their oil remain the primary non-mineral exports.<ref name=ussd2009>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5474.htm Background Notes for Niger: January 2009] Bureau of African Affairs, United States State Department.  Retrieved 2009-02-26.  Portions of the \"Economy\" section are here used verbatim, as this document is in the [[Public Domain]].</ref>\n\n==Overall economy==\nNiger's economy is based largely on [[subsistence crop]]s, livestock, and some of the world's largest uranium deposits. [[Drought]] cycles, [[desertification]], a 3.4% population growth rate and the drop in world demand for uranium have undercut an already marginal economy.<ref name=ussd2009 /> Traditional subsistence farming, herding, small trading, and informal markets dominate an economy that generates few formal sector jobs.  Between 1988 and 1995 28% to 30% of the total economy of Niger was in the unregulated [[Informal sector]], including small and even large scale rural and urban production, transport and services.<ref>C.

A small area in the southern tip of the nation, surrounding [[Gaya, Niger|Gaya]] can expect to receive 700mm to 900mm or rainfall.  Northern areas which support crops, such as the southern portions of the [[A\u00efr Massif]] and the [[Kaouar oasis]] rely upon oases and a slight increase in rainfall due to mountain effects. Large portions of the northwest and far east of the nation, while within the [[Sahara desert]], see just enough seasonal rainfall to support semi-nomadic animal husbandry.  The populations of these areas, mostly [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Wodaabe]] - [[Fula people|Fula]], and [[Toubou]], practise [[Transhumance]]: traveling south to pasture and sell animals in the dry season, north into the Sahara in the brief rainy season, while maintaining settled communities along these routes.<ref name=\"Decalo1997\">{{Cite book\n|last=Decalo\n|first=Samuel\n|title=Historical Dictionary of the Niger (3rd ed.)\n|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Boston & Folkestone\n|year=1997\n|isbn=0-8108-3136-8\n}}</ref>\n[[File:Niger ag land use map USGS.png|thumb|500px|center|Cropland Use Indicator, drawn from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, for period 1986-1988. <br />Scale is: 1= 70% - 100% Crop coverage :: 2= 50% - 70% Crop coverage :: 3= 30% - 50% Crop coverage :: 4= 5% - 30% Crop coverage :: 5= 0% - 5% Crop coverage.]]\n\n==Agriculture production==\n[[Image:Niger millet Koremairwa 1214.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A farmer collecting his [[millet]] harvest near [[Koremairwa]] in the [[Dosso (department)|Dosso]] department.]]\nNiger's agricultural and livestock sectors are the mainstay of all but 18% of the population.<ref name=ussd2009 /> Fourteen percent of Niger's GDP is generated by livestock production (camels, goats, sheep and cattle), said to support 29% of the population. Thus 53% of the population is actively involved in crop production.<ref name=ussd2009 /> The 15% of Niger's land that is arable is found mainly along its southern border with Nigeria.\n\n[[Pearl millet]], sorghum, and cassava are Niger's principal rain-fed subsistence crops. Irrigated rice for internal consumption, while expensive, has, since the devaluation of the CFA franc, sold for below the price of imported rice, encouraging additional production. Cowpeas and onions are grown for commercial export, as are small quantities of garlic, peppers, potatoes, and wheat.<ref name=ussd2009 />\n\n==Drought and environmental degradation==\n[[File:Niger Farm sand tv 16aug05.jpg|thumb|right|\"Drought has turned farmland into useless soil and sand\" A farmer examines the soil in drought stricken Niger during the 2005 famine.]]\n[[File:Niger nomads flee drought 16 aug 2005.jpg|thumb|right|Nomads leaving for Nigeria with their herds, Dakoro Department, Niger, 2005.]]\nRainfall varies and when insufficient, Niger has difficulty feeding its population and must rely on grain purchases and food aid to meet food requirements.<ref name=ussd2009 /> Rains, as in much of the [[Sahel]], have been marked by annual variability. This has been especially true in the 20th century, with the [[Sahel drought|most severe drought on record]] beginning in the late 1960s and lasting, with one break, well into the 1980s. The long-term effect of this, especially to [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] populations remains in the 21st century, with those communities which rely upon cattle, sheep, and camels husbandry losing entire herds more than once during this period.  Recent rains remain variable.  For instance, the rains in 2000 were not good, those in 2001 were plentiful and well distributed.\n\nFood shortfalls have also been caused by other factors.  Market prices driven up by [[drought]] and a [[Overpopulation (animals)#Wild animal overpopulation|plague]] of [[desert locust]] in 2005&ndash;2006 caused [[2005\u201306 Niger food crisis|a major food crisis]] in parts of the nation.\n\nShortage of good farmland has led to a number of innovations to farm marginal, often [[laterite]] soils  and soil degraded by [[overfarming]], wind, [[desertification]], and drought.  Women in particular are often given poor plots of land (in inherited sections known as \"''Gamana''\") to garden, and have developed specific crops for poor soil and water conditions. These typically include ocra and malahiya. External organisations have tried introducing alternative crops, such as the fruit of the [[Ziziphus mauritania]] tree (\"''Indian Jujube''\", marketed by the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) under the name of \"''Pomme du Sahel''\" or Sahel Apple) and the leaves and seeds of the [[Moringa|Moringa oleifera]].  Farmers use specialty water conservation techniques, \"water microcatchments\" or planting pits known as ''zai holes'', planting of crops among certain trees, planting in raised beds, [[drip irrigation]], and usage of water collected in the natural stone bottomed low areas common in the south east of the nation. This approach has been termed the [[Bioreclamation of Degraded Lands]].<ref>[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/db900SID/PSLG-7TCJF2?OpenDocument Niger: Reclaiming \u2018useless\u2019 lands gives new lifeline to West Africa\u2019s sidelined women farmers].

It only recognises the [[taxa]] order, family, subfamily, genus, and species. When it is uncertain how to classify a species into a genus but its classification in a family is clear, it will be classified as an unassigned species of that family. Many taxa remain unranked. There are also, as of 2005, [[GenBank]] sequences assigned to 3,142 \"species\" which are not accounted for in the ICTV report (due to the way GenBank works, however, the actual number of proper species is probably significantly smaller).<ref name=\"fauquet2005\"/>  The number of unidentified virus sequences is only expected to increase as the rate of virus sequencing increases dramatically.<ref name=\"fauquet2005\"/>\n\nThe ICTV has been strikingly successful in achieving stability, since their inception in 1962.  Every genus and family recognized in the 1980s continued to be in use as of 2005, for example.<ref name=\"fauquet2005\"/>\n\n==Naming and changing taxa==\nProposals for new names, name changes, and the establishment and taxonomic placement of taxa are handled by the Executive Committee of the ICTV in the form of proposals. All relevant ICTV subcommittees and study groups are consulted prior to a decision being taken.\n\nThe name of a [[taxon]] has no official status until it has been approved by ICTV, and names will only be accepted if they are linked to approved hierarchical taxa. If no suitable name is proposed for a taxon, the taxon may be approved and the name be left undecided until the adoption of an acceptable international name, when one is proposed to and accepted by ICTV. Names must not convey a meaning for the taxon which would seem to either exclude viruses which are rightfully members of that taxon, exclude members which might one day belong to that taxon, or include viruses which are members of different taxa.\n\n==Rules for taxa==\n\n===Species===\nA species name shall consist of as few words as practicable but must not consist only of a host name and the word ''virus''. A species name must provide an appropriately unambiguous identification of the species. Numbers, letters, or combinations thereof may be used as species [[epithet]]s where such numbers and letters are already widely used. However, newly designated serial numbers, letters or combinations thereof are not acceptable alone as species epithets. If a number or letter series is in existence it may be continued.\n\n===Genera===\nA virus genus is a group of related species that share some significant properties and often only differ in host range and virulence. A genus name must be a single word ending in the suffix -''virus''. Approval of a new genus must be accompanied by the approval of a [[type species]].\n\n===Subfamilies===\nA subfamily is a group of genera sharing certain common characters. The taxon shall be used only when it is needed to solve a complex hierarchical problem. A subfamily name must be a single word ending in the suffix -''virinae''.\n\n===Families===\nA family is a group of genera, whether or not these are organized into subfamilies, sharing certain common characters. A family name must be a single word ending in the suffix -''viridae''.\n\n===Orders===\nAn order is a group of families sharing certain common characters. An order name must be a single word ending in the suffix -''virales''.\n\n== Rules for sub-viral agents==\nRules concerned with the classification of viruses shall also apply to the classification of [[viroid]]s.

The development of ICTVdB has been supported by the ICTV since 1991 and was initially intended to aid taxonomic research. The database classifies viruses based primarily on their chemical characteristics, [[Genome|genomic]] type, [[nucleic acid]] replication, diseases, [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]], and geographical distribution, among other characteristics.\n\nThe database was developed at the [[Australian National University]] with support of the US [[National Science Foundation]], and sponsored by the [[American Type Culture Collection]]. It uses the [http://delta-intkey.com/ Description Language for Taxonomy] ([[DELTA (taxonomy)|DELTA]]) system, a world standard for taxonomic data exchange, developed at Australia's [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO). DELTA is able to store a wide diversity of data and translate it into a language suitable for traditional reports and web publication. For example, ICTVdB does not itself contain genomic sequence information but can convert DELTA data into NEXUS format.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Maddison DR, Swofford DL, Maddison WP |title=NEXUS: an extensible file format for systematic information |journal=Syst.

This decision was made after it became apparent that the taxonomy provided on the site was many years out of date, and that some of the information on the site was inaccurate due to problems with how the database was being queried and processed to support the natural language output of the ICTVdb web site. The ICTV has begun discussions on how best to fix these problems, but decided that the time frame for updates and error correction were sufficiently long that it was best to take the site down rather than perpetuate the release of inaccurate information.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} As of August 2013, the database remains on hold.<ref name=\"gibbs2013\" /> According to some views, \"ICTV should also promote the use of a public database to replace the ICTV database as a store of the primary metadata of individual viruses, and should publish abstracts of the ICTV Reports in that database, so that they are \u2018Open Access\u2019.\"<ref name=\"gibbs2013\" />\n\n==History==\n\nThe International Classification of Viruses was a group established in 1966 to standardize the naming of viruses.

It only recognises the [[taxa]] order, family, subfamily, genus, and species. When it is uncertain how to classify a species into a genus but its classification in a family is clear, it will be classified as an unassigned species of that family. Many taxa remain unranked. There are also, as of 2005, [[GenBank]] sequences assigned to 3,142 \"species\" which are not accounted for in the ICTV report (due to the way GenBank works, however, the actual number of proper species is probably significantly smaller).<ref name=\"fauquet2005\"/>  The number of unidentified virus sequences is only expected to increase as the rate of virus sequencing increases dramatically.<ref name=\"fauquet2005\"/>\n\nThe ICTV has been strikingly successful in achieving stability, since their inception in 1962.  Every genus and family recognized in the 1980s continued to be in use as of 2005, for example.<ref name=\"fauquet2005\"/>\n\n==Naming and changing taxa==\nProposals for new names, name changes, and the establishment and taxonomic placement of taxa are handled by the Executive Committee of the ICTV in the form of proposals. All relevant ICTV subcommittees and study groups are consulted prior to a decision being taken.\n\nThe name of a [[taxon]] has no official status until it has been approved by ICTV, and names will only be accepted if they are linked to approved hierarchical taxa. If no suitable name is proposed for a taxon, the taxon may be approved and the name be left undecided until the adoption of an acceptable international name, when one is proposed to and accepted by ICTV. Names must not convey a meaning for the taxon which would seem to either exclude viruses which are rightfully members of that taxon, exclude members which might one day belong to that taxon, or include viruses which are members of different taxa.\n\n==Rules for taxa==\n\n===Species===\nA species name shall consist of as few words as practicable but must not consist only of a host name and the word ''virus''. A species name must provide an appropriately unambiguous identification of the species. Numbers, letters, or combinations thereof may be used as species [[epithet]]s where such numbers and letters are already widely used. However, newly designated serial numbers, letters or combinations thereof are not acceptable alone as species epithets. If a number or letter series is in existence it may be continued.\n\n===Genera===\nA virus genus is a group of related species that share some significant properties and often only differ in host range and virulence. A genus name must be a single word ending in the suffix -''virus''. Approval of a new genus must be accompanied by the approval of a [[type species]].\n\n===Subfamilies===\nA subfamily is a group of genera sharing certain common characters. The taxon shall be used only when it is needed to solve a complex hierarchical problem. A subfamily name must be a single word ending in the suffix -''virinae''.\n\n===Families===\nA family is a group of genera, whether or not these are organized into subfamilies, sharing certain common characters. A family name must be a single word ending in the suffix -''viridae''.\n\n===Orders===\nAn order is a group of families sharing certain common characters. An order name must be a single word ending in the suffix -''virales''.\n\n== Rules for sub-viral agents==\nRules concerned with the classification of viruses shall also apply to the classification of [[viroid]]s.

The development of ICTVdB has been supported by the ICTV since 1991 and was initially intended to aid taxonomic research. The database classifies viruses based primarily on their chemical characteristics, [[Genome|genomic]] type, [[nucleic acid]] replication, diseases, [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]], and geographical distribution, among other characteristics.\n\nThe database was developed at the [[Australian National University]] with support of the US [[National Science Foundation]], and sponsored by the [[American Type Culture Collection]]. It uses the [http://delta-intkey.com/ Description Language for Taxonomy] ([[DELTA (taxonomy)|DELTA]]) system, a world standard for taxonomic data exchange, developed at Australia's [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO). DELTA is able to store a wide diversity of data and translate it into a language suitable for traditional reports and web publication. For example, ICTVdB does not itself contain genomic sequence information but can convert DELTA data into NEXUS format.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Maddison DR, Swofford DL, Maddison WP |title=NEXUS: an extensible file format for systematic information |journal=Syst.

This decision was made after it became apparent that the taxonomy provided on the site was many years out of date, and that some of the information on the site was inaccurate due to problems with how the database was being queried and processed to support the natural language output of the ICTVdb web site. The ICTV has begun discussions on how best to fix these problems, but decided that the time frame for updates and error correction were sufficiently long that it was best to take the site down rather than perpetuate the release of inaccurate information.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} As of August 2013, the database remains on hold.<ref name=\"gibbs2013\" /> According to some views, \"ICTV should also promote the use of a public database to replace the ICTV database as a store of the primary metadata of individual viruses, and should publish abstracts of the ICTV Reports in that database, so that they are \u2018Open Access\u2019.\"<ref name=\"gibbs2013\" />\n\n==History==\n\nThe International Classification of Viruses was a group established in 1966 to standardize the naming of viruses. The group was renamed International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses in 1975.\n\nIn 1971 the ICTV classification for viruses infecting [[vertebrate]]s included 19 genera, 2 families, and a further 24 unclassified groups.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Viruses}}\n* [[Glossary of scientific naming]]\n*[[Virus classification]]\n*[[Bioinformatics]]\n*[[DELTA (taxonomy)]]\n\n== Reports ==\n* {{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yfE6AAAAMAAJ |title= Classification and nomenclature of viruses |series= 1st report |date= 1971 |quote= Out of print |last1= Viruses |first1= International Committee on Nomenclature of |last2= Wildy |first2= Peter }}\n* {{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=avU7nj3n8lgC |title= Classification and nomenclature of viruses |series= 2nd report |date= 1976 |isbn= 978-3805524186 |last1= Viruses |first1= International Committee on Taxonomy of |last2= Fenner |first2= Frank }}\n* {{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=u48_AAAAYAAJ |title= Classification and nomenclature of viruses |series= 3rd report |date= 1979 |isbn= 978-3805505239 |last1= Viruses |first1= International Committee on Taxonomy of |last2= Matthews |first2= Richard Ellis Ford |last3= Section On Virology |first3= International Association of Microbiological Societies }}\n* {{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3805535570 |title= Classification and nomenclature of viruses |series= 4th report |date= 1982 |isbn= 9783805535571 |editor1-first= Richard |editor1-last= Ellis |editor2-first= Ford |editor2-last= Matthews |publisher= Karger |pages= 199 }}\n* {{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=UZJFAQAAIAAJ |title= Classification and nomenclature of viruses |series= 5th report |date= 1991 |isbn= 978-3211822869 |last1= Viruses |first1= International Committee on Taxonomy of |last2= Francki |first2= R.

Der Film ist auch bekannt unter ''The Tomb'', Aber der Titel auf der DVD sagt ''HP Lovecraft's The Tomb.''\n\n''\"Aus der Ohnmacht erwacht, befreit sich eine junge geschundene Frau aus der Plastikfolie, die ihren K\u00f6rper fesselt. Als sie sich umsieht, findet sie sich in einem dunklen, feuchten Kellerraum wieder. \u00dcberall stehen verschlossene Holzs\u00e4rge. Doch da findet sie noch einen Menschen, der am Leben ist. Noch ahnen die beiden Gefangenen nicht, welches makabere Spiel der \"Puppetmaster\" mit ihnen spielen wird - und dass sie sich in der leibhaftigen H\u00f6lle befinden.\"'' So der originale deutsche Klappentext auf der DVD.\n\n==Handlung==\nTara Griffin (Victoria Ullmann) und Billy (Christian Behm) erwachen in einen dunklem Keller (oder Hallenlager), blut\u00fcberstr\u00f6mt und \u00fcberseht mit Wunden. Als sie den Ort voller gruseligen und verst\u00f6renden Dekoobjekten durchsuchen, finden sie weitere verwundete Leute die auf \"grausame\" Weisen sterben. Sie sind gefangen vom ''\"Puppet Master\"'' ein diabolischer Schurke, der mit ihnen ein Spiel um Leben und tot spielt. Es wird nur einen \u00dcberleenden geben. H.P. Lovecraft wird im Laufe des Films mehrmals von einigen Charakteren erw\u00e4hnt. Der \"Puppetmaster\" wird als [[The Case of Charles Dexter Ward|\"Charles Dexter Ward\"]] und eines seiner Opfer als [[Pickman's Model|\"Pickman\"]] bezeichnet (ein Hinweis auf Lovecrafts Geschichte [[Pickman's Model|Pickmans Modell]]). Diese vor\u00fcbergehenden Verweise auf Lovecraft's-Charaktere (und ein Zitat aus einer von Lovecrafts Geschichten \u00fcber das \"Jenseits der Sph\u00e4ren\") sind jedoch f\u00fcr die auf dem Bildschirm abgespielte Serienm\u00f6rder-Handlung weitgehend irrelevant. Immer wenn jemand im laufe des Filmes stirbt, ert\u00f6nt der Spruch \"Acht N\u00e4gel f\u00fcr den Verlierer\", welcher bedeutet, dass die \u00dcberlebenden, den Gestorbenen, in einem Sarg aus Holz mit acht N\u00e4geln versiegeln sollen.\n\n=== Ende: ===\nNachdem jeder gestorben ist, ist Tara noch die einzige \u00dcberlebende. So kommt sie schlie\u00dflich frei, steigt in ein Auto und f\u00e4hrt zu einem Hotel. Dort liest sie sich die Geschichte HP ''\"Lovecraft The Tomb\"''  durch. Daraufhin kommt ein Mann (Wahrscheinlich der \"Puppetmaster\") in das Hotelzimmer und sagt zu ihr \"Du hast die Wahl, entweder du hast Sex mit mir, beh\u00e4ltst das Buch, das Auto und das Geld oder ich drehe mich um und geh' nehme das Auto, das Buch und das Geld, und lass' dich hier einfach zur\u00fcck.\". Darauf hin hat sie keinen Sex mit ihm, und nimmt das Auto, das Buch und das Geld. Dann schaut sie aus dem Fenster, sieht einen Mann auf einen Pferd. Dann sieht man wie sie das Buch liest, und der Mann kommt wieder in Zimmer. Bevor die beiden Sex haben, erschl\u00e4gt sie ihn mit einer Lampe.\n\n==Produktion==\nDie Produktion von HP Lovecrafts The Tomb fand im August 2005 in Marina Del Rey, Kalifornien, in einem Lagerhaus am Princeton Drive statt, das inzwischen abgerissen wurde.

Chris is a sensitive writer and extremely good at school, particularly in languages. She lives with her domineering and abusive father, her warm and kind mother, her brother, and two younger siblings. After her father rapes her mother, resulting in the birth of twins, the family moves to a larger home in Kindraddie. While there Chris begins to study at college to become a teacher.  \n\nOne day Chris's mother warns her of the horror of being raped and shortly after commits suicide, poisoning both herself and her twin newborns. Chris quits her studies and she and her brother commit to helping their father on the farm, while their two younger siblings go to live with their childless aunt and uncle. Chris's brother Will warns her not to let her father run her down the way he did with their mother and tells her his hope of running off to Canada. \n\nWill does eventually leave, though for [[Aberdeen]], though not before briefly introducing her to his friend, fellow farmer Ewan Tavendale.\n\nChris's father John eventually suffers a debilitating stroke putting the care of the farm entirely on Chris, especially after she learns that her brother has married and sailed for [[Argentina]] with his new bride. He also tries to rape Chris, though because of his physical condition he is unable to. He dies shortly afterwards leaving all his property and money to Chris. Rather than sell off his possessions she decides to stay on the farm. Very quickly afterwards she and Ewan fall in love and decide to get married and Chris is relieved that she will be able to stay in Kindraddie.\n\nChris and Ewan have a loving marriage and she gives birth to a son, Ewan Jr, just as the start of [[World War I]]. Ewan at first refuses to enlist, but knowing that conscription will soon be passed he eventually decides to go to war. Ewan comes back on leave a changed man. Violent and abrasive he rapes Chris and the two part on bad terms. Chris eventually receives mail informing her that Ewan is dead. She learns from her friend Chae that Ewan was executed as a deserter because he tried to return home to see Chris, devastated that he never got to kiss her goodbye the last time he saw her.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Agyness Deyn]] as Chris Guthrie\n* [[Peter Mullan]] as John Guthrie, father of Chris\n* [[Kevin Guthrie]] as Ewan Tavendale\n* [[Jack Greenlees]] as Will Guthrie\n* [[Daniela Nardini]] as Jena Guthrie\n* [[Ian Pirie]] as Chae Strachan                                                                        \n* [[Douglas Rankine]] as Long Rob\n* [[Mark Bonnar]] as Reverend Gibbon\n* [[Simon Tait (actor)|Simon Tait]] as Dr. Meldrum\n* [[Niall Greig Fulton]] as John Brigson\n* [[Trish Mullin]] as Mistress Melon\n* [[Julian Nest]] as Mr. Semple, lawyer\n* [[Linda Duncan McLaughlin]] as Auntie Janet\n* [[Ron Donachie]] as Uncle Tam\n* [[Jamie Michie]] as Mr. Kinloch\n* [[Niall Greig Fulton]] as John Brigson\n* [[Jim Sweeney (actor)|Jim Sweeney]] as Preacher\n* [[Hugh Ross (actor)|Hugh Ross]] as School Inspector\n* [[David Ganly]] as Tinker\n* Tom Duncan as McIvor\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nThe film features [[Peter Mullan]] and [[Kevin Guthrie]], and was shot in New Zealand, Luxembourg and Scotland.
