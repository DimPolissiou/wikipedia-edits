[[Jonathan King]] credits him for starting his YouTube videos in 2006. Oakley influenced World War II veteran Martin H. Slobodkin (1920\u20132006), who, under the name ''MHarris1920'', started to post his own blogs. Martin died in October 2006, and received an outpouring of tributes from other YouTube users after his wife, Teresa, posted a video announcing his death. His widow temporarily took over his blogs, but later closed this account. Another older person is Bernhard von Schwerin, who appears under the name bernie1927. He too was a World War II veteran, but on the German side. He was encouraged by Oakley, and has talked about his youth and his many travels, and his emigration to the U.S. in 1951.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nArtist [[Annemarie Wright]], 31, was so inspired by Oakley's story that she dedicated a piece of artwork to him.

The program was taped in the autumn of 2006.

His widow temporarily took over his blogs, but later closed this account. Another older person is Bernhard von Schwerin, who appears under the name bernie1927. He too was a World War II veteran, but on the German side. He was encouraged by Oakley, and has talked about his youth and his many travels, and his emigration to the U.S. in 1951.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nArtist [[Annemarie Wright]], 31, was so inspired by Oakley's story that she dedicated a piece of artwork to him.

He mentioned that this was not what he sought or wanted. He also stated that any web sites using his username (geriatric1927) were in no way affiliated with him.<ref name=\"tell7\">Telling it all 7 - Something important to say youtube posting 17 August 2006</ref> In \"Telling it all 7\", he stated that he had received many messages from advertising companies, telephone companies, and newspaper companies that wanted to interview him, but he preferred to speak only to his fellow YouTubers, whom he considered his friends.\n\nOn 16 February 2007, Oakley made his first television appearance, on a special episode of the BBC's ''[[The Money Programme]]'' called \"Coming to Your Screen: DIY TV\".

During the date with Rosenbloom, Connie confesses to him that she only called him for a revenge date, and it was at Sturgis' suggestion. In response, Rosenbloom rejects future dates with Connie. Meanwhile, Sheldon feels that it's not fair for him not to be friends with Dr. Sturgis just because Sturgis and Connie broke up, and convinces Mary to invite Sturgis for dinner.

Mary does not like the dinner table conversation that is taking place, and asks George to take Dr. Sturgis to a bar.

The series is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] prequel to ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' and begins with the character [[Sheldon Cooper]] at the age of nine, living with his family in [[East Texas]] and going to high school. [[Iain Armitage]] stars as young Sheldon, alongside [[Zoe Perry]], [[Lance Barber]], [[Montana Jordan]], Raegan Revord, and [[Annie Potts]]. [[Jim Parsons]], who portrays the adult Sheldon Cooper on ''The Big Bang Theory'', narrates the series and serves as an [[executive producer]].\n\nDevelopment of the prequel series began in November 2016, from an initial idea that Parsons passed along to ''The Big Bang Theory'' producers. The following March, Armitage and Perry were cast, and the series was ordered by CBS. The series premiered as a special preview on September 25, 2017, and two days later, CBS picked up the series for a full season of 22 episodes. From November 2, 2017, new episodes began airing weekly. In January 2018, CBS renewed the series for a second season which premiered on September 24, 2018, and in February 2019, for a third and fourth season, with the third season having premiered on September 26, 2019.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\nThe series takes place in the late 1980s and early 1990s; and follows [[Sheldon Cooper]] as a young boy attending high school in the fictional town of Medford, [[Texas]], aged nine in the first season<ref name=\"YoungSheldonOrdered\" /> as he tries to fit into the world around him while his family and friends attempt to deal with his unique intellectual capabilities and social challenges.<ref name=\"YoungSheldonOrdered\" /><ref name=\"PremiereDate\" />\n\nIn the series premiere, adult Sheldon states that \"nobody I knew in [[East Texas]] in 1989 cared about [[Newtonian physics]]\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/young-sheldon-is-the-anti-big-bang-theory-thats-why-its-great|title=\u2018Young Sheldon\u2019 Is the Anti-\u2018Big Bang Theory.\u2019 That\u2019s Why It\u2019s Great.|first=Kevin|last=Fallon|date=September 25, 2017|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|access-date=October 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130112352/https://www.thedailybeast.com/young-sheldon-is-the-anti-big-bang-theory-thats-why-its-great|archive-date=November 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>{{efn|Dr. Sturgis and Dr. Linkletter, two college physics professors who teach the classes in which Sheldon enrolls, are not introduced until Season 1 Episode 19 and Season 2 Episode 13 respectively.}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Iain Armitage]] as [[Sheldon Cooper]], a [[child prodigy]] with a \"once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science\".

The series is a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] prequel to ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'' and begins with the character [[Sheldon Cooper]] at the age of nine, living with his family in [[East Texas]] and going to high school. [[Iain Armitage]] stars as young Sheldon, alongside [[Zoe Perry]], [[Lance Barber]], [[Montana Jordan]], [[Raegan Revord]], and [[Annie Potts]]. [[Jim Parsons]], who portrays the adult Sheldon Cooper on ''The Big Bang Theory'', narrates the series and serves as an [[executive producer]].\n\nDevelopment of the prequel series began in November 2016, from an initial idea that Parsons passed along to ''The Big Bang Theory'' producers. The following March, Armitage and Perry were cast, and the series was ordered by CBS. The series premiered as a special preview on September 25, 2017, and two days later, CBS picked up the series for a full season of 22 episodes. From November 2, 2017, new episodes began airing weekly. In January 2018, CBS renewed the series for a second season which premiered on September 24, 2018, and in February 2019, for a third and fourth season, with the third season having premiered on September 26, 2019.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article!-->\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Premise==\nThe series takes place in the late 1980s and early 1990s; and follows [[Sheldon Cooper]] as a young boy attending high school in the fictional town of Medford, [[Texas]], aged nine in the first season<ref name=\"YoungSheldonOrdered\" /> as he tries to fit into the world around him while his family and friends attempt to deal with his unique intellectual capabilities and social challenges.<ref name=\"YoungSheldonOrdered\" /><ref name=\"PremiereDate\" />\n\nIn the series premiere, adult Sheldon states that \"nobody I knew in [[East Texas]] in 1989 cared about [[Newtonian physics]]\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/young-sheldon-is-the-anti-big-bang-theory-thats-why-its-great|title=\u2018Young Sheldon\u2019 Is the Anti-\u2018Big Bang Theory.\u2019 That\u2019s Why It\u2019s Great.|first=Kevin|last=Fallon|date=September 25, 2017|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|access-date=October 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171130112352/https://www.thedailybeast.com/young-sheldon-is-the-anti-big-bang-theory-thats-why-its-great|archive-date=November 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>{{efn|Dr. Sturgis and Dr. Linkletter, two college physics professors who teach the classes in which Sheldon enrolls, are not introduced until Season 1 Episode 19 and Season 2 Episode 13 respectively.}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Iain Armitage]] as [[Sheldon Cooper]], a [[child prodigy]] with a \"once-in-a-generation mind capable of advanced mathematics and science\".
