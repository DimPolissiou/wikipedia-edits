The [[archipelago]], which is of volcanic origin, is {{convert|1750|km|mi}} east of northern Australia, {{convert|540|km|mi}} northeast of [[New Caledonia]], east of [[New Guinea]], southeast of the [[Solomon Islands]], and west of [[Fiji]].\n\nVanuatu was first inhabited by [[Melanesians|Melanesian]] people. The first Europeans to visit the islands were a Spanish expedition led by Portuguese navigator [[Pedro Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s|Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s]], who arrived on the largest island, [[Esp\u00edritu Santo]], in 1606. Since the Portuguese and Spanish monarchies had been unified under the king of Spain in 1580 (following the vacancy of the [[Portuguese throne]], which lasted for sixty years, until 1640, when the Portuguese monarchy was restored), Queir\u00f3s claimed the archipelago for Spain, as part of the colonial [[Spanish East Indies]], and named it {{lang|es|La Austrialia del Esp\u00edritu Santo}}.\n\nIn the 1880s, France and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] claimed parts of the archipelago, and in 1906, they agreed on a framework for jointly managing the archipelago as the [[New Hebrides]] through an Anglo\u2013French [[condominium (international law)|condominium]]. An independence movement arose in the 1970s, and the Republic of Vanuatu was founded in 1980. Since independence, the country has become a member of the [[United Nations]], [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] and the [[Pacific Islands Forum]].\n{{toc limit}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nVanuatu's name derives from the word ''[[vanua]]'' (\"land\" or \"home\"),{{sfn|Hess|2009|p=115}} which occurs in several [[Austronesian languages]],{{efn|1=''Vanua'' in turns comes from the [[Proto-Austronesian language|Proto-Austronesian]] ''banua'' \u2013 see {{harvnb|Reuter|2002|p=29}}; and {{harvnb|Reuter|2006|p=326}}}} and the word ''tu'' (\"stand\").

During the 1860s, [[plantations|planters]] in Australia, Fiji, New Caledonia, and the Samoa Islands, in need of labourers, encouraged a long-term [[indentured labour]] trade called \"[[blackbirding]]\".

The arrival of [[United States|Americans]] during the [[Second World War]], with their informal habits and relative wealth, contributed to the rise of nationalism in the islands.

Additionally, the lack of employment opportunities in industry and inaccessibility to markets have combined to lock rural families into a subsistence or self-reliance mode, putting tremendous pressure on local ecosystems.<ref name=pc/>\n\n{{wide image|Port Vila aerial.jpg|700px|align-cap=center|The panorama of [[Port Vila]], capital and largest city of Vanuatu.}}\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n{{see also|List of birds of Vanuatu}}\n[[File:Vanuatu Tanna Yasur.JPG|thumb|Cinder plain of [[Mount Yasur]] on [[Tanna (island)|Tanna]] island.]]\n[[File:A stream on Efate, Vanuatu.jpg|thumb|Stream on [[Efate]] island.]]\nDespite its tropical forests, Vanuatu has a limited number of plant and animal species. It has an indigenous flying fox, ''[[Pteropus anetianus]]''. Flying foxes are important rainforest and timber regenerators. They pollinate and seed disperse a wide variety of native trees. Their diet is nectar, pollen and fruit and they are commonly called \"fruit bats\". They are in decline across their South Pacific range. However, governments are increasingly aware of the economic and ecological value of flying foxes and there are calls to increase their protection. There are no indigenous large mammals. The nineteen species of native reptiles include the [[Ramphotyphlops braminus|flowerpot snake]], found only on Efate. The [[Fiji banded iguana]] (''Brachylophus fasciatus'') was introduced as a [[feral]] animal in the 1960s.{{sfn|Sprackland|1992}}<ref name=lp/> There are eleven species of bats (three unique to Vanuatu) and sixty-one species of land and water birds. While the small [[Polynesian rat]] is thought to be indigenous, the large species arrived with Europeans, as did domesticated hogs, dogs, and cattle. The ant species of some of the islands of Vanuatu were catalogued by [[E. O. Wilson]].{{sfn|Wilson|1994}}\n\nThe region is rich in sea life, with more than 4,000 species of marine molluscs and a large diversity of [[List of fishes of the Coral Sea|marine fishes]]. Cone snails and stonefish carry poison fatal to humans. The [[Achatina fulica|Giant East African land snail]] arrived only in the 1970s, but already has spread from the Port-Vila region to Luganville.\n\nThere are three or possibly four adult [[saltwater crocodile]]s living in Vanuatu's mangroves and no current breeding population.<ref name = lp>{{cite book |first=Jocelyn |last = Harewood |title=Vanuatu and New Caledonia |publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2009 |page=47 |isbn=978-0-86622-634-9 }}</ref> It is said the crocodiles reached the northern part of the islands after cyclones, given the island chain's proximity to the Solomon Islands and New Guinea where crocodiles are very common.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bennett| first=Michelle|author2=Jocelyn Harewood |title=Vanuatu |publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2003 |page=19 |isbn=978-1-74059-239-0 }}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate is tropical, with about nine months of warm to hot rainy weather and the possibility of cyclones and three to four months of cooler, drier weather characterised by winds from the southeast.

The Prime Minister, in turn, appoints the Council of Ministers, whose number may not exceed a quarter of the number of parliamentary representatives. The Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers constitute the executive government.\n\nThe [[Parliament of Vanuatu]] is [[unicameral]] and has 52 members,<ref>[http://www.paclii.org/cgi-bin/sinodisp/vu/legis/consol_sub/rotpcas654/rotpcas654.html?stem=&synonyms=&query=members%20of%20parliament Representation of the People (Parliamentary Constituencies and Seats)].</ref> who are elected by popular vote every four years unless earlier dissolved by a majority vote of a three-quarters quorum or by a directive from the President on the advice of the Prime Minister.

Chiefs continue to be the leading figures at the village level. It has been reported that even politicians need to oblige them.<ref name=\"Lonely Planet:Vanuatu\">Lonely Planet:Vanuatu</ref> One becomes such a figure by holding a number of lavish feasts (each feast allowing them a higher ceremonial grade) or alternatively through inheritance (the latter only in Polynesian-influenced villages). In northern Vanuatu, feasts are graded through the nimangki-system.\n\nGovernment and society in Vanuatu tend to divide along linguistic French and English lines. Forming [[coalition government]]s has proved problematic at times, owing to differences between English and French speakers. Francophone politicians like those of the [[Union of Moderate Parties]] tend to be conservative and support neo-liberal policies, as well as closer relations with France and the West. The anglophone [[Vanua'aku Pati]] identifies as socialist and anti-colonial.\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of Vanuatu|Supreme Court]] consists of a chief justice and up to three other judges.

The names in English of all provinces are derived from the initial letters of their constituent islands:\n\n* [[Malampa Province|Malampa]] ('''Mal'''akula, '''Am'''brym, '''Pa'''ama)\n* [[Penama Province|Penama]] ('''Pen'''tecost, '''Am'''bae, '''Ma'''ewo&nbsp;\u2013 in French: P\u00e9nama)\n* [[Sanma Province|Sanma]] ('''San'''to, '''Ma'''lo)\n* [[Shefa Province|Shefa]] ('''Sh'''epherds group, '''Efa'''te&nbsp;\u2013 in French: Sh\u00e9fa)\n* [[Tafea Province|Tafea]] ('''T'''anna, '''A'''niwa, '''F'''utuna, '''E'''rromango, '''A'''neityum&nbsp;\u2013 in French: Taf\u00e9a)\n* [[Torba Province|Torba]] ('''Tor'''res Islands, '''Ba'''nks Islands)\n\nProvinces are autonomous units with their own popularly elected local parliaments known officially as provincial councils. They collect local taxes and make by-laws in local matters like tourism, the provincial budget or the provision of some basic services. They are headed by a chairman elected from among the members of the local parliaments and assisted by a secretary appointed by the [[Civil service commission|Public Service Commission]].\n\nTheir executive arm consists of a provincial government headed by an executive officer who is appointed by the Prime Minister with the advice of the minister of local government. The provincial government is usually formed by the party that has the majority in the provincial council and, like the national government, is advised in Ni-Vanuatu culture and language by the local council of chiefs. The provincial president is constitutionally a member of the electoral college that elects the President of Vanuatu.\n\nThe provinces are in turn divided into municipalities (usually consisting of an individual island) headed by a council and a mayor elected from among the members of the council.\n'\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economy of Vanuatu}}\n[[File:Vanuatu Exports Treemap (2009)..jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A proportional representation of Vanuatu's exports]]\n[[File:PortVilaMarketHall.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A market hall in Port Vila]]\n\nThe four mainstays of the economy are agriculture, tourism, offshore [[financial services]], and [[cattle raising|raising cattle]]. Vanuatu sells citizenship for about $150,000, and its passports allow visa-free travel throughout Europe. With demand from the Chinese market booming, passport sales may now account for more than 30% of the country's revenue.<ref>How selling citizenship is now big business\nSarah Treanor and Vivienne Nunis, business reporters, BBC News, Vanuatu. 10 October 2019. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49958628</ref> There is substantial fishing activity, although this industry does not bring in much foreign exchange. Exports include [[copra]], [[kava]], beef, cocoa and timber, and imports include machinery and equipment, foodstuffs and fuels. In contrast, mining activity is unsubstantial.\n\nAlthough manganese mining halted in 1978, there was an agreement in 2006 to export manganese already mined but not yet exported. The country has no known petroleum deposits. A small light-industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues come mainly from import duties and a 15% [[Value Added Tax|VAT]] on goods and services. Economic development is hindered by dependence on relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to natural disasters, and long distances between constituent islands and from main markets.\n\nAgriculture is used for consumption as well as for export. It provides a living for 65% of the population. In particular, production of copra and kava create substantial revenue. Many farmers have been abandoning cultivation of food crops, and use earnings from kava cultivation to buy food.<ref name=\"Lonely Planet:Vanuatu\"/> Kava has also been used in ceremonial exchanges between clans and villages.<ref>Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 33&nbsp;\u2013 5.2)</ref> Cocoa is also grown for foreign exchange.<ref>Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 49&nbsp;\u2013 7.2)</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the number of households engaged in fishing was 15,758, mainly for consumption (99%), and the average number of weekly fishing trips was 3.<ref>Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 77&nbsp;\u2013 13.1)</ref> The tropical climate enables growing of a wide range of fruits and vegetables and spices, including banana, garlic, cabbage, peanuts, pineapples, sugarcane, taro, yams, watermelons, leaf spices, carrots, radishes, eggplants, vanilla (both green and cured), pepper, cucumber and many others.<ref>Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 114&nbsp;\u2013 table 4.17)</ref> In 2007, the value (in terms of millions of [[vatu]]&nbsp;\u2013 the official currency of Vanuatu), for agricultural products, was estimated for different products: kava (341&nbsp;million vatu), copra (195), cattle (135), crop gardens (93), cocoa (59), forestry (56), fishing (24) and coffee (12).<ref>Census of Agriculture 2007 (various pages)</ref>\nIn 2018, Vanuatu banned all use of plastic bags and plastic straws, with more plastic items scheduled to be banned in 2020.[https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p07l0ftg/what-happened-after-this-nation-banned-plastic-]\n\n{{anchor|Tourism}}\nTourism brings in much-needed foreign exchange.

The [[archipelago]], which is of volcanic origin, is {{convert|1750|km|mi}} east of northern Australia, {{convert|540|km|mi}} northeast of [[New Caledonia]], east of [[New Guinea]], southeast of the [[Solomon Islands]], and west of [[Fiji]].\n\nVanuatu was first inhabited by [[Melanesians|Melanesian]] people. The first Europeans to visit the islands were a Spanish expedition led by Portuguese navigator [[Pedro Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s|Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s]], who arrived on the largest island, [[Esp\u00edritu Santo]], in 1606. Since the Portuguese and Spanish monarchies had been unified under the king of Spain in 1580 (following the vacancy of the [[Portuguese throne]], which lasted for sixty years, until 1640, when the Portuguese monarchy was restored), Queir\u00f3s claimed the archipelago for Spain, as part of the colonial [[Spanish East Indies]], and named it {{lang|es|La Austrialia del Esp\u00edritu Santo}}.\n\nIn the 1880s, France and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] claimed parts of the archipelago, and in 1906, they agreed on a framework for jointly managing the archipelago as the [[New Hebrides]] through an Anglo\u2013French [[condominium (international law)|condominium]]. An independence movement arose in the 1970s, and the Republic of Vanuatu was founded in 1980. Since independence, the country has become a member of the [[United Nations]], [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] and the [[Pacific Islands Forum]].\n{{toc limit}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nVanuatu's name derives from the word ''[[vanua]]'' (\"land\" or \"home\"),{{sfn|Hess|2009|p=115}} which occurs in several [[Austronesian languages]],{{efn|1=''Vanua'' in turns comes from the [[Proto-Austronesian language|Proto-Austronesian]] ''banua'' \u2013 see {{harvnb|Reuter|2002|p=29}}; and {{harvnb|Reuter|2006|p=326}}}} and the word ''tu'' (\"stand\").

The Prime Minister, in turn, appoints the Council of Ministers, whose number may not exceed a quarter of the number of parliamentary representatives. The Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers constitute the executive government.\n\nThe [[Parliament of Vanuatu]] is [[unicameral]] and has 52 members,<ref>[http://www.paclii.org/cgi-bin/sinodisp/vu/legis/consol_sub/rotpcas654/rotpcas654.html?stem=&synonyms=&query=members%20of%20parliament Representation of the People (Parliamentary Constituencies and Seats)].</ref> who are elected by popular vote every four years unless earlier dissolved by a majority vote of a three-quarters quorum or by a directive from the President on the advice of the Prime Minister. The national Council of Chiefs, called the ''[[Malvatu Mauri]]'' and elected by district councils of chiefs, advises the government on all matters concerning ni-Vanuatu culture and language.\n\nBesides national authorities and figures, Vanuatu also has high-placed people at the village level. Chiefs continue to be the leading figures at the village level. It has been reported that even politicians need to oblige them.<ref name=\"Lonely Planet:Vanuatu\">Lonely Planet:Vanuatu</ref> One becomes such a figure by holding a number of lavish feasts (each feast allowing them a higher ceremonial grade) or alternatively through inheritance (the latter only in Polynesian-influenced villages). In northern Vanuatu, feasts are graded through the nimangki-system.\n\nGovernment and society in Vanuatu tend to divide along linguistic French and English lines. Forming [[coalition government]]s has proved problematic at times, owing to differences between English and French speakers. Francophone politicians like those of the [[Union of Moderate Parties]] tend to be conservative and support neo-liberal policies, as well as closer relations with France and the West. The anglophone [[Vanua'aku Pati]] identifies as socialist and anti-colonial.\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of Vanuatu|Supreme Court]] consists of a chief justice and up to three other judges. Two or more members of this court may constitute a Court of Appeal. Magistrate courts handle most routine legal matters.

The names in English of all provinces are derived from the initial letters of their constituent islands:\n\n* [[Malampa Province|Malampa]] ('''Mal'''akula, '''Am'''brym, '''Pa'''ama)\n* [[Penama Province|Penama]] ('''Pen'''tecost, '''Am'''bae, '''Ma'''ewo&nbsp;\u2013 in French: P\u00e9nama)\n* [[Sanma Province|Sanma]] ('''San'''to, '''Ma'''lo)\n* [[Shefa Province|Shefa]] ('''Sh'''epherds group, '''Efa'''te&nbsp;\u2013 in French: Sh\u00e9fa)\n* [[Tafea Province|Tafea]] ('''T'''anna, '''A'''niwa, '''F'''utuna, '''E'''rromango, '''A'''neityum&nbsp;\u2013 in French: Taf\u00e9a)\n* [[Torba Province|Torba]] ('''Tor'''res Islands, '''Ba'''nks Islands)\n\nProvinces are autonomous units with their own popularly elected local parliaments known officially as provincial councils. They collect local taxes and make by-laws in local matters like tourism, the provincial budget or the provision of some basic services. They are headed by a chairman elected from among the members of the local parliaments and assisted by a secretary appointed by the [[Civil service commission|Public Service Commission]].\n\nTheir executive arm consists of a provincial government headed by an executive officer who is appointed by the Prime Minister with the advice of the minister of local government. The provincial government is usually formed by the party that has the majority in the provincial council and, like the national government, is advised in Ni-Vanuatu culture and language by the local council of chiefs. The provincial president is constitutionally a member of the electoral college that elects the President of Vanuatu.\n\nThe provinces are in turn divided into municipalities (usually consisting of an individual island) headed by a council and a mayor elected from among the members of the council.\n'\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economy of Vanuatu}}\n[[File:Vanuatu Exports Treemap (2009)..jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A proportional representation of Vanuatu's exports]]\n[[File:PortVilaMarketHall.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A market hall in Port Vila]]\n\nThe four mainstays of the economy are agriculture, tourism, offshore [[financial services]], and [[cattle raising|raising cattle]]. Vanuatu sells citizenship for about $150,000, and its passports allow visa-free travel throughout Europe. With demand from the Chinese market booming, passport sales may now account for more than 30% of the country's revenue.<ref>How selling citizenship is now big business\nSarah Treanor and Vivienne Nunis, business reporters, BBC News, Vanuatu. 10 October 2019. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49958628</ref> There is substantial fishing activity, although this industry does not bring in much foreign exchange. Exports include [[copra]], [[kava]], beef, cocoa and timber, and imports include machinery and equipment, foodstuffs and fuels. In contrast, mining activity is unsubstantial.\n\nAlthough manganese mining halted in 1978, there was an agreement in 2006 to export manganese already mined but not yet exported. The country has no known petroleum deposits. A small light-industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues come mainly from import duties and a 15% [[Value Added Tax|VAT]] on goods and services. Economic development is hindered by dependence on relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to natural disasters, and long distances between constituent islands and from main markets.\n\nAgriculture is used for consumption as well as for export. It provides a living for 65% of the population. In particular, production of copra and kava create substantial revenue. Many farmers have been abandoning cultivation of food crops, and use earnings from kava cultivation to buy food.<ref name=\"Lonely Planet:Vanuatu\"/> Kava has also been used in ceremonial exchanges between clans and villages.<ref>Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 33&nbsp;\u2013 5.2)</ref> Cocoa is also grown for foreign exchange.<ref>Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 49&nbsp;\u2013 7.2)</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the number of households engaged in fishing was 15,758, mainly for consumption (99%), and the average number of weekly fishing trips was 3.<ref>Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 77&nbsp;\u2013 13.1)</ref> The tropical climate enables growing of a wide range of fruits and vegetables and spices, including banana, garlic, cabbage, peanuts, pineapples, sugarcane, taro, yams, watermelons, leaf spices, carrots, radishes, eggplants, vanilla (both green and cured), pepper, cucumber and many others.<ref>Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 114&nbsp;\u2013 table 4.17)</ref> In 2007, the value (in terms of millions of [[vatu]]&nbsp;\u2013 the official currency of Vanuatu), for agricultural products, was estimated for different products: kava (341&nbsp;million vatu), copra (195), cattle (135), crop gardens (93), cocoa (59), forestry (56), fishing (24) and coffee (12).<ref>Census of Agriculture 2007 (various pages)</ref>\nIn 2018, Vanuatu banned all use of plastic bags and plastic straws, with more plastic items scheduled to be banned in 2020.[https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p07l0ftg/what-happened-after-this-nation-banned-plastic-]\n\n{{anchor|Tourism}}\nTourism brings in much-needed foreign exchange.

Two years later, Australia's ''[[Australian Survivor (season 2)|Celebrity Survivor]]'' was filmed at the same location used by the US version. In mid-2002, the government stepped up efforts to boost tourism.\n\nFinancial services are an important part of the economy. Vanuatu is a [[tax haven]] that until 2008 did not release account information to other governments or law-enforcement agencies. International pressure, mainly from Australia, influenced the Vanuatu government to begin adhering to international norms to improve transparency.

Another musical genre that has become widely popular during the 20th century in all areas of Vanuatu, is known as ''[[string band]]'' music.

After SC 9, it continues northward into North Carolina as a two-lane highway. SCDOT has no plans to widen or bypass any US&nbsp;1 alignments northeast of Camden to the North Carolina line.\n\nBetween the South Carolina line and the [[U.S. Route 74|US&nbsp;74]] bypass, US&nbsp;1 is a two-lane road but sees a considerable amount of truck and tourist traffic of people cutting through from the US&nbsp;74/[[U.S. Route 220|US&nbsp;220]] and [[Interstate 73|I-73]]/[[Interstate 74 in North Carolina|I-74]] corridor attempting to reach points south and east. US&nbsp;1 goes through downtown [[Rockingham, North Carolina|Rockingham]], with a bypass in the future plans. North of the NC 177 junction, it becomes four lanes or greater, becoming a super-street with limited access and then becoming a limited access freeway. US&nbsp;1 becomes a major artery for the state as it moves north of Rockingham. After [[Richmond County, North Carolina|Richmond County]], it goes into [[Moore County, North Carolina|Moore County]] with two expressway bypasses in [[Southern Pines, North Carolina|Southern Pines]], [[Vass, North Carolina|Vass]] and [[Cameron, North Carolina|Cameron]]. US&nbsp;1 continues with the [[Jefferson Davis Highway]] label through [[Lee County, North Carolina|Lee County]] and [[Sanford, North Carolina|Sanford]], and on to [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]] and [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]].

US&nbsp;1 is at the minimum a 3 lane (with alternate passing) from the N.C. line to Petersburg with occasional four lane divided sections. North of Petersburg is a four lane undivided roadway at the minimum to the D.C. line.\nThe route of US&nbsp;1 from [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]] to the state line is parallel with the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]]. From [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]] onwards it is parallel with [[Interstate 95]].\nAfter exiting the District into [[Maryland]], US&nbsp;1 follows the Baltimore-Washington Boulevard, the first of several modern highways built along the [[Baltimore-Washington]] corridor; [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]] is the newest, after the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]]. US&nbsp;1 runs through the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland at College Park]] campus in [[College Park, Maryland]]. The route bypasses [[downtown Baltimore, Maryland|downtown Baltimore]] on [[North Avenue (Baltimore)|North Avenue]] and exits the city to the northeast on Belair Road, gradually leaving the I-95 corridor, which passes through [[Wilmington, Delaware]], for a straighter path towards [[Philadelphia]]. Around and beyond [[Bel Air, Harford County, Maryland|Bel Air]], US&nbsp;1 is a two-lane road, crossing the [[Susquehanna River]] over the top of the [[Conowingo Dam]] before entering Pennsylvania.

Ware III]] Memorial Highway, just after crossing into [[Pennsylvania]]. This bypass extends around [[Oxford, Pennsylvania|Oxford]] and [[Kennett Square, Pennsylvania|Kennett Square]], merging into the four-lane divided [[Baltimore Pike]] just beyond the latter. At [[Media, Pennsylvania|Media]], US&nbsp;1 again becomes a freeway&nbsp;\u2013 the Media Bypass&nbsp;\u2013 ending just beyond [[Interstate 476]]. After several name changes, the road becomes [[City Avenue]], the western city limits of [[Philadelphia]], at the end of which a short [[Concurrency (road)|overlap]] with the [[Schuylkill Expressway]] ([[Interstate 76 in Pennsylvania|I-76]]) leads to the [[Roosevelt Expressway (Philadelphia)|Roosevelt Expressway]] and then the twelve-lane [[Roosevelt Boulevard (Philadelphia)|Roosevelt Boulevard]] partly overlapping [[U.S. Route 13 in Pennsylvania|US&nbsp;13]]. US&nbsp;1 again becomes a freeway after leaving the city, bypassing [[Penndel, Pennsylvania|Penndel]] and [[Morrisville, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Morrisville]] and crossing the [[Delaware River]] into [[New Jersey]] on the [[Trenton\u2013Morrisville Toll Bridge]].<ref name=maps/>\n\n[[File:Pulaski Skyway full view.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pulaski Skyway]], in Jersey City, Kearny, and Newark, New Jersey]]\nAfter crossing into [[New Jersey]] in Mercer County, US&nbsp;1 continues on the [[Trenton Freeway]] through the state capital of [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] and [[Lawrence Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Lawrence Township]] as a four lane freeway. As the freeway ends, the four lane [[divided highway]] upgrades to six lanes north of [[Interstate 295 (Delaware\u2013Pennsylvania)|I-295]] passing through the Penns Neck section of West Windsor Township.

Northward, it continues through [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]] as a short limited-access highway until the CR 529/Plainfield Avenue traffic signal in Edison. Through Edison and Woodbridge, US&nbsp;1 has a mix of boulevard and limited-access segments and continues to do so after the [[U.S. Route 9 in New Jersey|US&nbsp;9]] juncture in the Avenel section of [[Woodbridge Township, New Jersey|Woodbridge]]. The [[U.S. Route 1/9|US&nbsp;1/9]] [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] continues through the rest of the state. The six lane divided highway remains through [[Rahway, New Jersey|Rahway]] in Union County and [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]], until it reaches the [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark Airport]], where it becomes a dual carriageway freeway around downtown [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] in Essex County with a 2-2-2-2 configuration. The historic [[Pulaski Skyway]] takes US&nbsp;1/9 into [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], and the route exits the freeway at [[Tonnele Circle]] to head north into [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]]. US&nbsp;1/9 turns onto [[U.S. Route 46|US&nbsp;46]] as a limited-access highway, and the three routes run northeast to the [[George Washington Bridge Plaza]], where they merge into [[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]]. US&nbsp;46 ends in the middle of the bridge, which crosses the [[Hudson River]] into [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]] exits just beyond onto [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in [[Manhattan]], but US&nbsp;1 stays with [[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]] onto the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]], exiting in [[the Bronx]] onto Webster Avenue. Two turns take US&nbsp;1 via [[Fordham Road]] to Boston Road, which it follows northeast out of the city, becoming Boston Post Road in Westchester County, never straying far from I-95. From the [[Bronx]] to the state line, it is a local road with two lanes in each direction, except in [[Rye, New York|Rye]] where it has a single lane in each direction. As it enters Greenwich, Connecticut, it continues as a two-lane local road.\n\n===New England===\n:''Main articles: [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut]], [[U.S. Route 1 in Rhode Island|Rhode Island]], [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|Massachusetts]], [[U.S. Route 1 in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], and [[U.S. Route 1 in Maine|Maine]]\n\nIn [[New England]], US&nbsp;1 generally serves large cities in a side street capacity.

Most of this part is a four-lane [[divided highway]], providing access to [[Route 138 (Rhode Island)|Route 138]] towards [[Newport, RI|Newport]]. After [[Route 4 (Rhode Island)|Route 4]] splits as a mostly-[[freeway]] connection to I-95, US&nbsp;1 becomes a lower-speed surface road, passing through [[Warwick, RI|Warwick]], Providence, and [[Pawtucket, RI|Pawtucket]].

Within [[Maine]], US&nbsp;1 begins as a parallel route to [[I-95 (ME)|I-95]] near the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. At [[Portland, Maine|Portland]], I-95 splits off to the north, and [[I-295 (ME)|I-295]] heads northeast paralleling US&nbsp;1 to [[Brunswick, ME|Brunswick]]. There US&nbsp;1 turns east as a mostly two-lane road along the coast to [[Calais, Maine|Calais]]; much of this portion is advertised as the \"Coastal Route\" on signs. North from Calais, US&nbsp;1 follows the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]], crossing I-95 in Houlton and eventually turning west and southwest to its \"north\" end at the [[Clair-Fort Kent Bridge]] in [[Fort Kent, ME|Fort Kent]].

SCDOT has no plans to widen or bypass any US&nbsp;1 alignments northeast of Camden to the North Carolina line.\n\nBetween the South Carolina line and the [[U.S. Route 74|US&nbsp;74]] bypass, US&nbsp;1 is a two-lane road but sees a considerable amount of truck and tourist traffic of people cutting through from the US&nbsp;74/[[U.S. Route 220|US&nbsp;220]] and [[Interstate 73|I-73]]/[[Interstate 74 in North Carolina|I-74]] corridor attempting to reach points south and east. US&nbsp;1 goes through downtown [[Rockingham, North Carolina|Rockingham]], with a bypass in the future plans. North of the NC 177 junction, it becomes four lanes or greater, becoming a super-street with limited access and then becoming a limited access freeway.

US&nbsp;1 is at the minimum a 3 lane (with alternate passing) from the N.C. line to Petersburg with occasional four lane divided sections. North of Petersburg is a four lane undivided roadway at the minimum to the D.C. line.\nThe route of US&nbsp;1 from [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]] to the state line is parallel with the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]]. From [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]] onwards it is parallel with [[Interstate 95]].\nAfter exiting the District into [[Maryland]], US&nbsp;1 follows the Baltimore-Washington Boulevard, the first of several modern highways built along the [[Baltimore-Washington]] corridor; [[Interstate 95 in Maryland|I-95]] is the newest, after the [[Baltimore-Washington Parkway]]. US&nbsp;1 runs through the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland at College Park]] campus in [[College Park, Maryland]]. The route bypasses [[downtown Baltimore, Maryland|downtown Baltimore]] on [[North Avenue (Baltimore)|North Avenue]] and exits the city to the northeast on Belair Road, gradually leaving the I-95 corridor, which passes through [[Wilmington, Delaware]], for a straighter path towards [[Philadelphia]]. Around and beyond [[Bel Air, Harford County, Maryland|Bel Air]], US&nbsp;1 is a two-lane road, crossing the [[Susquehanna River]] over the top of the [[Conowingo Dam]] before entering Pennsylvania. (Routed further north, US&nbsp;1 bypasses the state of  [[Delaware]], unlike I-95.)<ref name=maps/>\n\n[[File:US 1 NB past PA 532.jpeg|thumb|left|US 1 along [[Roosevelt Boulevard (Philadelphia)|Roosevelt Boulevard]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]\n\nThe two-lane US&nbsp;1 becomes a four-lane [[Controlled-access highway|expressway]], officially known as the [[John H. Ware III]] Memorial Highway, just after crossing into [[Pennsylvania]]. This bypass extends around [[Oxford, Pennsylvania|Oxford]] and [[Kennett Square, Pennsylvania|Kennett Square]], merging into the four-lane divided [[Baltimore Pike]] just beyond the latter. At [[Media, Pennsylvania|Media]], US&nbsp;1 again becomes a freeway&nbsp;\u2013 the Media Bypass&nbsp;\u2013 ending just beyond [[Interstate 476]]. After several name changes, the road becomes [[City Avenue]], the western city limits of [[Philadelphia]], at the end of which a short [[Concurrency (road)|overlap]] with the [[Schuylkill Expressway]] ([[Interstate 76 in Pennsylvania|I-76]]) leads to the [[Roosevelt Expressway (Philadelphia)|Roosevelt Expressway]] and then the twelve-lane [[Roosevelt Boulevard (Philadelphia)|Roosevelt Boulevard]] partly overlapping [[U.S. Route 13 in Pennsylvania|US&nbsp;13]]. US&nbsp;1 again becomes a freeway after leaving the city, bypassing [[Penndel, Pennsylvania|Penndel]] and [[Morrisville, Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Morrisville]] and crossing the [[Delaware River]] into [[New Jersey]] on the [[Trenton\u2013Morrisville Toll Bridge]].<ref name=maps/>\n\n[[File:Pulaski Skyway full view.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pulaski Skyway]], in Jersey City, Kearny, and Newark, New Jersey]]\nAfter crossing into [[New Jersey]] in Mercer County, US&nbsp;1 continues on the [[Trenton Freeway]] through the state capital of [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] and [[Lawrence Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Lawrence Township]] as a four lane freeway. As the freeway ends, the four lane [[divided highway]] upgrades to six lanes north of [[Interstate 295 (Delaware\u2013Pennsylvania)|I-295]] passing through the Penns Neck section of West Windsor Township. Through Penns Neck is a series of traffic signals. NJDOT is looking to revamp the highway through this area by replacing traffic signals with grade separations. The highway enters Middlesex County through Plainsboro and South Brunswick, where the highest point resides.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rosenthal|first=Harold|date=1983|title=Water tower in South Brunswick Township|url=https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/43303/|journal=Rutgers University Community Repository|language=en|volume=|pages=|doi=10.7282/T3N58JK0|via=}}</ref> By Forrestal Village, the highway downgrades from 6 to 4 lanes until after Finnegans Lane in North Brunswick. Northward, it continues through [[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick]] as a short limited-access highway until the CR 529/Plainfield Avenue traffic signal in Edison. Through Edison and Woodbridge, US&nbsp;1 has a mix of boulevard and limited-access segments and continues to do so after the [[U.S. Route 9 in New Jersey|US&nbsp;9]] juncture in the Avenel section of [[Woodbridge Township, New Jersey|Woodbridge]]. The [[U.S. Route 1/9|US&nbsp;1/9]] [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] continues through the rest of the state. The six lane divided highway remains through [[Rahway, New Jersey|Rahway]] in Union County and [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]], until it reaches the [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark Airport]], where it becomes a dual carriageway freeway around downtown [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] in Essex County with a 2-2-2-2 configuration. The historic [[Pulaski Skyway]] takes US&nbsp;1/9 into [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]], and the route exits the freeway at [[Tonnele Circle]] to head north into [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]]. US&nbsp;1/9 turns onto [[U.S. Route 46|US&nbsp;46]] as a limited-access highway, and the three routes run northeast to the [[George Washington Bridge Plaza]], where they merge into [[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]]. US&nbsp;46 ends in the middle of the bridge, which crosses the [[Hudson River]] into [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|US&nbsp;9]] exits just beyond onto [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] in [[Manhattan]], but US&nbsp;1 stays with [[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]] onto the [[Cross Bronx Expressway]], exiting in [[the Bronx]] onto Webster Avenue. Two turns take US&nbsp;1 via [[Fordham Road]] to Boston Road, which it follows northeast out of the city, becoming Boston Post Road in Westchester County, never straying far from I-95. From the [[Bronx]] to the state line, it is a local road with two lanes in each direction, except in [[Rye, New York|Rye]] where it has a single lane in each direction. As it enters Greenwich, Connecticut, it continues as a two-lane local road.\n\n===New England===\n:''Main articles: [[U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut]], [[U.S. Route 1 in Rhode Island|Rhode Island]], [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|Massachusetts]], [[U.S. Route 1 in New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], and [[U.S. Route 1 in Maine|Maine]]\n\nIn [[New England]], US&nbsp;1 generally serves large cities in a side street capacity.  In [[Connecticut]], US&nbsp;1 serves the shore of the [[Long Island Sound]] parallel to [[I-95 (CT)|I-95]]. Beyond [[New Haven, CT|New Haven]], the highway travels east\u2013west, and some signs in the state indicate this rather than the standard north\u2013south.

Most of this part is a four-lane [[divided highway]], providing access to [[Route 138 (Rhode Island)|Route 138]] towards [[Newport, RI|Newport]]. After [[Route 4 (Rhode Island)|Route 4]] splits as a mostly-[[freeway]] connection to I-95, US&nbsp;1 becomes a lower-speed surface road, passing through [[Warwick, RI|Warwick]], Providence, and [[Pawtucket, RI|Pawtucket]]. The route parallels [[I-95 (MA)|I-95]] again through Providence and Pawtucket and into [[Massachusetts]], traveling towards [[Boston]] as a four-lane road.

During construction, drivers had to detour to one of two other nearby bridges carrying [[U.S. Route 1 Bypass (Maine-New Hampshire)|U.S. Route 1 Bypass]] or [[Interstate 95]]. Within [[Maine]], US&nbsp;1 begins as a parallel route to [[I-95 (ME)|I-95]] near the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. At [[Portland, Maine|Portland]], I-95 splits off to the north, and [[I-295 (ME)|I-295]] heads northeast paralleling US&nbsp;1 to [[Brunswick, ME|Brunswick]]. There US&nbsp;1 turns east as a mostly two-lane road along the coast to [[Calais, Maine|Calais]]; much of this portion is advertised as the \"Coastal Route\" on signs. North from Calais, US&nbsp;1 follows the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]], crossing I-95 in Houlton and eventually turning west and southwest to its \"north\" end at the [[Clair-Fort Kent Bridge]] in [[Fort Kent, ME|Fort Kent]].

The film was released by [[Universal Pictures]] on March 2, 2012, on what would have been Seuss' 108th birthday.\n\nThe second [[film adaptation|adaptation]] of the book (following the [[The Lorax (TV special)|1972 animated television special]]), the film builds on the book by expanding the story of the Lorax and Ted, the previously unnamed boy who visits the Once-ler. The cast includes [[Danny DeVito]] as the Lorax, [[Ed Helms]] as the Once-ler and [[Zac Efron]] as Ted. New characters introduced in the film are Audrey, Ted's love interest (voiced by [[Taylor Swift]]), Aloysius O'Hare ([[Rob Riggle]]), Mrs. Wiggins, Ted's mother ([[Jenny Slate]]), and Grammy Norma, Ted's grandmother ([[Betty White]]).<ref name=\"The Lorax\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/813236/Dr-Seuss-The-Lorax/full-credits.html|title=The Lorax|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|accessdate=July 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhile the film received mixed reviews from critics, it was a box office success, grossing $348.8 million worldwide based on a $70 million budget.<ref name=\"BOM\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n12-year-old Ted Wiggins lives in Thneedville, a [[walled city]] where everything is artificial, with no living plants (\"Thneedville\"). Ted has a crush on environmentalist Audrey, and decides to impress her with a \u201creal tree\u201d. His Grammy Norma tells him the legend of the Once-ler, who knows what happened to the trees. Leaving Thneedville in search of the Once-ler, Ted discovers that the outside world is a barren, contaminated wasteland. He finds the Once-ler, who agrees to tell him the story of the trees over multiple visits. Returning home, Ted encounters Thneedville's greedy mayor, Aloysius O'Hare, whose company sells bottled [[oxygen]] to the polluted city. Explaining that trees, and the oxygen they produce freely, pose a threat to his business, O'Hare pressures Ted to stay in town, but Ted continues to visit the Once-ler.\n\nThe Once-ler recounts how, as a young inventor, he arrived in a lush forest of animals and Truffula trees (\"This is The Place\"). Cutting down a tree, he was confronted by the Lorax, the guardian of the forest who \u201cspeaks for the trees\u201d. After attempting to force the Once-ler out, the Lorax convinces him not to harm any more trees. Using the Truffula tree, the Once-ler created the \u201cThneed\u201d, a piece of cloth with multiple uses, which became a major success (\"Everybody Needs a Thneed\"). His lazy relatives persuaded him to resume chopping down trees to mass-produce Thneeds, leading to enormous profits but [[deforestation]] and [[pollution]] (\"How Bad Can I Be?\")the sog id abot  peaopel be ing bad. After harvesting the last Truffula tree, the Once-ler was ruined, abandoned by his family, and became a [[recluse]]. With the region uninhabitable, the Lorax sent the animals away to find a new place to live and disappeared into the sky, leaving a single word on a pile of rocks: \"Unless\".\n\nThe Once-ler gives Ted the last Truffula seed in hopes he can regrow the forest and make others care about trees. Ted returns home to plant the seed, which is spotted by O'Hare\u2019s city-wide surveillance. Enlisting the help of Audrey and his family, Ted is pursued by O\u2019Hare to the center of town. O\u2019Hare rallies the citizens against Ted, telling them that trees are dangerous and filthy, but Ted uses an [[earthmover]] to knock down a section of the city wall, revealing the environmental destruction outside. Inspired by Ted\u2019s conviction, the crowd turns on O\u2019Hare, and the seed is finally planted (\"Let It Grow\"). Time passes and the land begins to recover; new trees sprout, animals return, and the now-elderly Once-ler reunites with the Lorax.\n\nThe film ends with a quote from Dr. Seuss: \u201cUnless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It\u2019s not.\u201d\n\n==Voice cast==\n*[[Danny DeVito]] as The Lorax, a mystical orange furry creature with a yellow moustache.<ref name=\"FirstLook\">{{cite web|title=First look: Danny DeVito will stump for trees in 3-D 'Lorax'|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-10-25-Lorax25_ST_N.htm|author=Breznican, Anthony|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 25, 2010|accessdate=October 26, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104173755/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-10-25-Lorax25_ST_N.htm|archivedate=November 4, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*[[Ed Helms]] as The Once-ler.<ref name=\"FirstLook\" />\n*[[Zac Efron]] as Ted Wiggins, an idealistic 12-year-old boy.<ref name=ETOSharletteLorax>{{cite news|author=Sharlette|title=CINEMA WITH SHARLETTE: 'THE LORAX'|url=http://www.etonline.com/sharlette/119649_Cinema_with_Sharlette_The_Lorax/index.html|accessdate=June 15, 2013|newspaper=ETonline.com|date=March 5, 2012|quote=In the 3D-CG version of Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, we focus on Ted Wiggins, a 12-year-old boy in search of a living tree for the girl he adores.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016030035/http://www.etonline.com/sharlette/119649_Cinema_with_Sharlette_The_Lorax/index.html|archivedate=October 16, 2013}}</ref> He is named after the author of the book, [[Dr. Seuss]] (Theodor Geisel).<ref name=\"Collider20120130\">{{cite news|last=Radish|first=Christina|title=10 Things to Know About DR.

Then Pipsqueak and Lou arrive. The Once-ler tells them not to have [[Joyride (crime)|joyrides]]. When the Once-ler goes inside his house, Pipsqueak and Lou start cranking up the wagon, but Melvin refuses to pull it because he is angry that they whipped the reins. So Pipsqueak hangs a Truffula fruit in front of Melvin as an incentive. However, Melvin gets exhausted going up a steep hill. Then the wagon gets unhooked from Melvin, and it rolls downhill backwards while Pipsqueak and Lou scream in terror. Melvin chases the runaway wagon. Lou tries to stop the wagon by stabbing a stick in one of its [[wheel]]s, but he gets stuck on the wheel instead. Finally, he lands back on the seat next to Pipsqueak, who hugs him happily. The wagon hits a rock and is propelled downhill even faster. When it approaches a cliff, Pipsqueak panics and grabs the wagon canopy, which flies off\u2014only to be held in place by Lou. The wagon flies off the cliff, but the canopy acts as a parachute and they make their descent calmly, landing in the same place they left. Melvin appears shortly after. The Once-ler comes out of the house and is surprised to see them. He expresses surprise that they listened to instructions, but just when it seems like they fooled him, Lou sneezes and the wagon falls apart. Melvin hides beneath his hooves and Lou and Pipsqueak curl up into a ball. The Once-ler looks annoyed and makes a small, disgruntled \"Grr\" sound, causing Lou and Pipsqueak to run away into the trees.\n\n;''Forces of Nature''\nThe Lorax makes Pipsqueak an Honorary Lorax and team up to scare the Once-ler by using two sticks that looks like a monster's hand to freak him out. The Once-ler finds out it is fake and sprays water on the Lorax, which makes his fur puff up. When the Lorax tells Pipsqueak that he is going to turn out like him, Pipsqueak gets scared and runs away. The short ends with the Lorax telling Pipsqueak that he has lost his Honorary Lorax title.\n\n===Video game===\n[[Blockdot]] created a mobile puzzle game based on the film, titled ''Truffula Shuffula''.

The film was released by [[Universal Pictures]] on March 2, 2012, on what would have been Seuss' 108th birthday.\n\nThe second [[film adaptation|adaptation]] of the book (following the [[The Lorax (TV special)|1972 animated television special]]), the film builds on the book by expanding the story of the Lorax and Ted, the previously unnamed boy who visits the Once-ler. The cast includes [[Danny DeVito]] as the Lorax, [[Ed Helms]] as the Once-ler and [[Zac Efron]] as Ted. New characters introduced in the film are Audrey, Ted's love interest (voiced by [[Taylor Swift]]), Aloysius O'Hare ([[Rob Riggle]]), Mrs. Wiggins, Ted's mother ([[Jenny Slate]]), and Grammy Norma, Ted's grandmother ([[Betty White]]).<ref name=\"The Lorax\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/813236/Dr-Seuss-The-Lorax/full-credits.html|title=The Lorax|work=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting System]] ([[Time Warner]])|location=[[Atlanta]]|accessdate=July 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhile the film received mixed reviews from critics, it was a box office success, grossing $348.8 million worldwide based on a $70 million budget.<ref name=\"BOM\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n12-year-old Ted Wiggins lives in Thneedville, a [[walled city]] where everything is artificial, with no living plants (\"Thneedville\"). Ted has a crush on environmentalist Audrey, and decides to impress her with a \u201creal tree\u201d. His Grammy Norma tells him the legend of the Once-ler, who knows what happened to the trees. Leaving Thneedville in search of the Once-ler, Ted discovers that the outside world is a barren, contaminated wasteland. He finds the Once-ler, who agrees to tell him the story of the trees over multiple visits. Returning home, Ted encounters Thneedville's greedy mayor, Aloysius O'Hare, whose company sells bottled [[oxygen]] to the polluted city. Explaining that trees, and the oxygen they produce freely, pose a threat to his business, O'Hare pressures Ted to stay in town, but Ted continues to visit the Once-ler.\n\nThe Once-ler recounts how, as a young inventor, he arrived in a lush forest of animals and Truffula trees (\"This is The Place\"). Cutting down a tree, he was confronted by the Lorax, the guardian of the forest who \u201cspeaks for the trees\u201d. After attempting to force the Once-ler out, the Lorax convinces him not to harm any more trees. Using the Truffula tree, the Once-ler created the \u201cThneed\u201d, a piece of cloth with multiple uses, which became a major success (\"Everybody Needs a Thneed\"). His lazy relatives persuaded him to resume chopping down trees to mass-produce Thneeds, leading to enormous profits but [[deforestation]] and [[pollution]] (\"How Bad Can I Be?\"). After harvesting the last Truffula tree, the Once-ler was ruined, abandoned by his family, and became a [[recluse]]. With the region uninhabitable, the Lorax sent the animals away to find a new place to live and disappeared into the sky, leaving a single word on a pile of rocks: \"Unless\".\n\nThe Once-ler gives Ted the last Truffula seed in hopes he can regrow the forest and make others care about trees. Ted returns home to plant the seed, which is spotted by O'Hare\u2019s city-wide surveillance. Enlisting the help of Audrey and his family, Ted is pursued by O\u2019Hare to the center of town. O\u2019Hare rallies the citizens against Ted, telling them that trees are dangerous and filthy, but Ted uses an [[earthmover]] to knock down a section of the city wall, revealing the environmental destruction outside. Inspired by Ted\u2019s conviction, the crowd turns on O\u2019Hare, and the seed is finally planted (\"Let It Grow\"). Time passes and the land begins to recover; new trees sprout, animals return, and the now-elderly Once-ler reunites with the Lorax.\n\nThe film ends with a quote from Dr. Seuss: \u201cUnless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It\u2019s not.\u201d\n\n==Voice cast==\n*[[Danny DeVito]] as The Lorax, a mystical orange furry creature with a yellow moustache.<ref name=\"FirstLook\">{{cite web|title=First look: Danny DeVito will stump for trees in 3-D 'Lorax'|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-10-25-Lorax25_ST_N.htm|author=Breznican, Anthony|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 25, 2010|accessdate=October 26, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104173755/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-10-25-Lorax25_ST_N.htm|archivedate=November 4, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*[[Ed Helms]] as The Once-ler.<ref name=\"FirstLook\" />\n*[[Zac Efron]] as Ted Wiggins, an idealistic 12-year-old boy.<ref name=ETOSharletteLorax>{{cite news|author=Sharlette|title=CINEMA WITH SHARLETTE: 'THE LORAX'|url=http://www.etonline.com/sharlette/119649_Cinema_with_Sharlette_The_Lorax/index.html|accessdate=June 15, 2013|newspaper=ETonline.com|date=March 5, 2012|quote=In the 3D-CG version of Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, we focus on Ted Wiggins, a 12-year-old boy in search of a living tree for the girl he adores.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016030035/http://www.etonline.com/sharlette/119649_Cinema_with_Sharlette_The_Lorax/index.html|archivedate=October 16, 2013}}</ref> He is named after the author of the book, [[Dr. Seuss]] (Theodor Geisel).<ref name=\"Collider20120130\">{{cite news|last=Radish|first=Christina|title=10 Things to Know About DR.

Then Pipsqueak and Lou arrive. The Once-ler tells them not to have [[Joyride (crime)|joyrides]]. When the Once-ler goes inside his house, Pipsqueak and Lou start cranking up the wagon, but Melvin refuses to pull it because he is angry that they whipped the reins. So Pipsqueak hangs a Truffula fruit in front of Melvin as an incentive. However, Melvin gets exhausted going up a steep hill. Then the wagon gets unhooked from Melvin, and it rolls downhill backwards while Pipsqueak and Lou scream in terror. Melvin chases the runaway wagon. Lou tries to stop the wagon by stabbing a stick in one of its [[wheel]]s, but he gets stuck on the wheel instead. Finally, he lands back on the seat next to Pipsqueak, who hugs him happily. The wagon hits a rock and is propelled downhill even faster. When it approaches a cliff, Pipsqueak panics and grabs the wagon canopy, which flies off\u2014only to be held in place by Lou. The wagon flies off the cliff, but the canopy acts as a parachute and they make their descent calmly, landing in the same place they left. Melvin appears shortly after. The Once-ler comes out of the house and is surprised to see them. He expresses surprise that they listened to instructions, but just when it seems like they fooled him, Lou sneezes and the wagon falls apart. Melvin hides beneath his hooves and Lou and Pipsqueak curl up into a ball. The Once-ler looks annoyed and makes a small, disgruntled \"Grr\" sound, causing Lou and Pipsqueak to run away into the trees.\n\n;''Forces of Nature''\nThe Lorax makes Pipsqueak an Honorary Lorax and team up to scare the Once-ler by using two sticks that looks like a monster's hand to freak him out. The Once-ler finds out it is fake and sprays water on the Lorax, which makes his fur puff up.
