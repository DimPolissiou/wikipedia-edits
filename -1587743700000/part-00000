Assembled by five American [[G.I. (military)|GI]]s stationed in the country, the group grew tired of the traditional format of [[rock music|rock]], which motivated them to forge a highly experimental style characterized by an emphasis on hypnotic rhythms that minimized the role of melody, augmented by the use of sound manipulation techniques. The band's unconventional blend of shrill [[vocals]], [[Audio feedback|feedback]], and [[guitarist]] David Day's six-string [[banjo]] baffled audiences, but music historians have since identified the Monks as a pioneering force in [[avant-garde music]]. The band's lyrics often voiced objection to the [[Vietnam War]] and the dehumanized state of society, while prefiguring the harsh and blunt commentary of the [[punk rock]] movement of the 1970s and 1980s. The band's appearance was considered as shocking as its music, as they attempted to mimic the look of [[Catholic]] [[monk]]s by wearing black [[Religious habit|habits]] with [[cincture]]s symbolically tied around their necks, and hair worn in partially shaved [[tonsure]]s.\n\nIn late 1964, while known as the Torquays, the band issued the self-financed [[single (music)|single]] \"There She Walks\"; however, the release barely hinted at the music the group would record the following year. With the help of a German management team, they decided to change their name to the Monks and released the \"Complication\" single to coincide with the distribution of their one and only studio [[album]], ''[[Black Monk Time]]'' on [[Polydor Records]], in March 1966. Though the album and additional singles issued throughout 1966 and 1967 achieved limited success at the time, they have become highly regarded amongst music enthusiasts and commentators.\n\nA few days after the release of ''Five Upstart Americans'' in 1999, all five of the original band members held a reunion concert followed by other series of sporadic tours in the 2000s. The band has acquired a [[cult following]] as a result of the newfound interest in ''Black Monk Time'', and appearances on several [[compilation album]]s, most notably the expanded version of ''[[Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965\u20131968]]''. Punk bands and acts of other genres from the 1980s and 1990s, such as [[the Dead Kennedys]] and [[the Beastie Boys]], have credited the Monks as an influence on their own musical styles.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings (1963\u20131964)===\n\nThe nucleus of the Monks formed in late 1963, when American G.I.s [[Gary Burger]] ([[lead guitar]], [[lead vocalist]]), Larry Clark ([[keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), Eddie Shaw ([[bass guitar]]), and Dave Day ([[rhythm guitar]]), along with a West German civilian identified simply as Hans ([[drums]]) came together as a quintet known as the Torquays, a name inspired by Burger's admiration for [[the Fireballs]]' hit instrumental piece \"Torquay\".<ref name=ugly>{{cite web|url=http://ugly-things.com/the-monks-monk-time/|title=The Monks - Monk Time|website=uglythings.com|author=Stax, Mike|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref> Burger and Day had previously spent time together informally performing as an on-duty musical duo called the Rhythm Rockers, which soon recruited Clark and Hans to bolster their sound.<ref name=psychedelic>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2011/06/monks-interview-with-gary-burger.html|title=Monks Interview with Gary Burger|publisher=It's Psychedelic Baby! magazine|author=Breznikar, Klemen|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref><ref name=dazed>{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/22589/1/the-monks-holy-rockers|title=The Monks: Holy Rockers|website=dazeddigital.com|author=Phull, Hardeep|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref> Soon after, Shaw auditioned for the band and was reluctantly accepted by Burger.<ref name=ugly/> Shaw, a [[jazz]] musician by trade, was recruited largely due to the band's urgent need for a bass guitarist, rather than for his experience with the instrument, which was limited to some private practices prior to meeting with the Torquays.<ref name=monktime>{{cite AV media notes|title=Black Monk Time|type=CD booklet|year=2009|publisher=Light in the Attic Records|author=Howes, Kevin|id=LITA 042}}</ref> The band first began performing at military hangouts near their outpost in Gelhausen, playing a combination of American [[rock and roll]] standards from the 1950s, and some original songs penned by Burger and Day to rowdy crowds and servicemen.<ref name=psychedelic/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electrovoice.com/pressrelease.php?id=163|title=Singer/Guitarist of the Monks, Gary Burger, Endorses Ev'|website=electrovoice.com|author=Dedlund, James|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nSpotting the band at the Maxim Club, [[talent manager]] Hans Reich convinced the Torquays to stay in Germany when their military careers came to a close with the promise of work.<ref name=\"Early Years CD\">{{cite AV media notes|title=The Early Years 1964\u20131965|type=CD booklet|year=2009|publisher=Light in the Attic Records|author=Howes, Kevin|id=LITA 041}}</ref><ref name=\"Shaw (Monks book)\">{{cite book|title=Black Monk Time|last1=Shaw|first1=Edward|publisher=Street Street Publishing|page=86|year=1994|isbn=0963337122}}</ref> For a brief period, the band included vocalist Zack Zachariah and drummer Bob Rose; however, the two were forced to excuse themselves from the Torquays because their [[military discharge|discharge]]s were long after the other band members'.<ref name=\"Early Years CD\"/> Burger solved the issue relatively quickly by introducing the band to drummer Roger Johnston, and, henceforth, solidifying the line-up which would exist for the duration of the group's recording career.<ref name=\"Shaw (Monks book)\"/> As the Torquays began to rehearse, Burger arranged a one-off [[single (music)|single]] deal for the group at an independent studio in Heidelberg.

The band equipped themselves with new instruments and hardware to achieve that goal: a [[Maestro FZ-1 Fuzz-Tone|Maestro fuzz box]] (and eventually a [[wah-wah pedal]]) for Burger, a [[floor tom]] for Johnston, and a six-string [[banjo]] for Day, the latter of which offered a disorienting counter-rhythm to the bass section.<ref name=monktime/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-monks.com/year1.htm|title=Year of the Monks|website=themonks.com|author=Bedard, Will|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/gary-burger-monks-dies/|title=Gary Burger of the Monks dies|website=ultimateclassicmusic.com|author=Lifton, Dave|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref> Shaw explained that the group's motivation was to possess \"high rhythm and high energy\".<ref name=ugly/> He elaborated further, saying \"The idea of it was to get as much 'beat' out of it as we could. As much 'bam-bam-bam-bam' on the beat or whatever. The only time cymbals would be used would be for accent. If anyone wasn't contributing towards rhythm, then it wasn't part of the Monks sound\".<ref name=ugly/> However, the band's transformation into the Monks was painstakingly slow, taking the group nearly a year of trial-and-error before they were confident enough to return to the studio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nooga.com/printme/169023|title=How the Monks Predicted the Rise of Punk|website=nooga.com|author=Pedard, Joshua|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref><ref name=feedback>{{cite web|url=http://www.playloud.org/monkspresskit(40pages).pdf|title=the transatlantic feedback|website=playloud.org|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1965, the Monks recorded new, self-penned compositions to present to [[Polydor Records]].

Assembled by five American [[G.I. (military)|GI]]s stationed in the country, the group grew tired of the traditional format of [[rock music|rock]], which motivated them to forge a highly experimental style characterized by an emphasis on hypnotic rhythms that minimized the role of melody, augmented by the use of sound manipulation techniques. The band's unconventional blend of shrill [[vocals]], [[Audio feedback|feedback]], and [[guitarist]] David Day's six-string [[banjo]] baffled audiences, but music historians have since identified the Monks as a pioneering force in [[avant-garde music]]. The band's lyrics often voiced objection to the [[Vietnam War]] and the dehumanized state of society, while prefiguring the harsh and blunt commentary of the [[punk rock]] movement of the 1970s and 1980s. The band's appearance was considered as shocking as its music, as they attempted to mimic the look of [[Catholic]] [[monk]]s by wearing black [[Religious habit|habits]] with [[cincture]]s symbolically tied around their necks, and hair worn in partially shaved [[tonsure]]s.\n\nIn late 1964, while known as the Torquays, the band issued the self-financed [[single (music)|single]] \"There She Walks\"; however, the release barely hinted at the music the group would record the following year. With the help of a German management team, they decided to change their name to the Monks and released the \"Complication\" single to coincide with the distribution of their one and only studio [[album]], ''[[Black Monk Time]]'' on [[Polydor Records]], in March 1966. Though the album and additional singles issued throughout 1966 and 1967 achieved limited success at the time, they have become highly regarded amongst music enthusiasts and commentators.\n\nA few days after the release of ''Five Upstart Americans'' in 1999, all five of the original band members held a reunion concert followed by other series of sporadic tours in the 2000s. The band has acquired a [[cult following]] as a result of the newfound interest in ''Black Monk Time'', and appearances on several [[compilation album]]s, most notably the expanded version of ''[[Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965\u20131968]]''. Punk bands and acts of other genres from the 1980s and 1990s, such as [[the Dead Kennedys]] and [[the Beastie Boys]], have credited the Monks as an influence on their own musical styles.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings (1963\u20131964)===\n\nThe nucleus of the Monks formed in late 1963, when American G.I.s [[Gary Burger]] ([[lead guitar]], [[lead vocalist]]), Larry Clark ([[keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), Eddie Shaw ([[bass guitar]]), and Dave Day ([[rhythm guitar]]), along with a West German civilian identified simply as Hans ([[drums]]) came together as a quintet known as the Torquays, a name inspired by Burger's admiration for [[the Fireballs]]' hit instrumental piece \"Torquay\".<ref name=ugly>{{cite web|url=http://ugly-things.com/the-monks-monk-time/|title=The Monks - Monk Time|website=uglythings.com|author=Stax, Mike|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref> Burger and Day had previously spent time together informally performing as an on-duty musical duo called the Rhythm Rockers, which soon recruited Clark and Hans to bolster their sound.<ref name=psychedelic>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2011/06/monks-interview-with-gary-burger.html|title=Monks Interview with Gary Burger|publisher=It's Psychedelic Baby! magazine|author=Breznikar, Klemen|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref><ref name=dazed>{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/22589/1/the-monks-holy-rockers|title=The Monks: Holy Rockers|website=dazeddigital.com|author=Phull, Hardeep|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref> Soon after, Shaw auditioned for the band and was reluctantly accepted by Burger.<ref name=ugly/> Shaw, a [[jazz]] musician by trade, was recruited largely due to the band's urgent need for a bass guitarist, rather than for his experience with the instrument, which was limited to some private practices prior to meeting with the Torquays.<ref name=monktime>{{cite AV media notes|title=Black Monk Time|type=CD booklet|year=2009|publisher=Light in the Attic Records|author=Howes, Kevin|id=LITA 042}}</ref> The band first began performing at military hangouts near their outpost in Gelhausen, playing a combination of American [[rock and roll]] standards from the 1950s, and some original songs penned by Burger and Day to rowdy crowds and servicemen.<ref name=psychedelic/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electrovoice.com/pressrelease.php?id=163|title=Singer/Guitarist of the Monks, Gary Burger, Endorses Ev'|website=electrovoice.com|author=Dedlund, James|accessdate=August 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nSpotting the band at the Maxim Club, [[talent manager]] Hans Reich convinced the Torquays to stay in Germany when their military careers came to a close with the promise of work.<ref name=\"Early Years CD\">{{cite AV media notes|title=The Early Years 1964\u20131965|type=CD booklet|year=2009|publisher=Light in the Attic Records|author=Howes, Kevin|id=LITA 041}}</ref><ref name=\"Shaw (Monks book)\">{{cite book|title=Black Monk Time|last1=Shaw|first1=Edward|publisher=Street Street Publishing|page=86|year=1994|isbn=0963337122}}</ref> For a brief period, the band included vocalist Zack Zachariah and drummer Bob Rose; however, the two were forced to excuse themselves from the Torquays because their [[military discharge|discharge]]s were long after the other band members'.<ref name=\"Early Years CD\"/> Burger solved the issue relatively quickly by introducing the band to drummer Roger Johnston, and, henceforth, solidifying the line-up which would exist for the duration of the group's recording career.<ref name=\"Shaw (Monks book)\"/> As the Torquays began to rehearse, Burger arranged a one-off [[single (music)|single]] deal for the group at an independent studio in Heidelberg.

Early in the 20th century, Czech chemist [[Bohuslav Brauner]], and later English physicist [[Henry Mosely]], predicted the existence of an element with [[atomic weight]] 61, situated between [[neodymium]] and [[samarium]] on the [[periodic table]]. Various scientists had attempted to isolate the predicted element without success since the time of Mosely's and Brauner's predictions. Working in 1945, Richter carried out a series of experiments with his doctoral advisor Charles D. Coryell and with scientists [[Lawrence E. Glendenin]] and [[Jacob A. Marinsky]] on isolation of the missing element. These experiments were conducted at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]]. They obtained element 61 by two means, including as a [[nuclear fission product]] of [[uranium]] and the [[Neutron radiation|neutron bombardment]] of neodymium, all conducted in [[Graphite Reactor|graphite reactors]].

Coryell]] on investigations in nuclear chemistry.  Early in the 20th century, Czech chemist [[Bohuslav Brauner]], and later English physicist [[Henry Mosely]], predicted the existence of an element with atomic weight 61, situated between [[neodymium]] and [[samarium]] on the [[periodic table]]. Various scientists had attempted to isolate the predicted element without success since the time of Mosely's and Brauner's predictions. Working in 1945, Richter carried out a series of experiments with his doctoral advisor Charles D. Coryell and with scientists [[Lawrence E. Glendenin]] and [[Jacob A. Marinsky]] on isolation of the missing element. These experiments were conducted at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]]. They obtained element 61 by two means, including as a [[nuclear fission product]] of [[uranium]] and the [[Neutron radiation|neutron bombardment]] of neodymium, all conducted in [[Graphite Reactor|graphite reactors]]. This element was subsequently named \"promethium\", an inherently unstable element in all of its [[Isotope|isotopic forms]].<ref name=\"GemLab\" /> Richter wrote his Ph.D. thesis on ''The Photofusion of Uranium'' (1952)<ref name=\"PhD\">{{cite book |last1=Richter |first1=Harold G. |title=The photofusion of uranium |date=1952 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Chemistry |location=Cambridge, MA |edition=Dissertation, Ph.

She was a member of the Nairobi branch of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Kenya Red Cross Society]], becoming its director in 1973. She was a member of the Kenya Association of University Women. Following the establishment of the Environment Liaison Centre in 1974, Maathai was asked to be a member of the local board, eventually becoming board chair. The Environment Liaison Centre worked to promote the participation of non-governmental organizations in the work of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), whose headquarters was established in Nairobi following the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] held in [[Stockholm]] in 1972. Maathai also joined the National Council of Women of Kenya (NCWK).<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 119\u2013122.</ref> Through her work at these various volunteer associations, it became evident to Maathai that the root of most of Kenya's problems was environmental degradation.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 124\u2013125.</ref>\n{{Quote box |salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote=We hoped that these elections would provide the people of Kenya with a fairer and truer representation of their aspirations and beliefs. To our dismay and despair, however, the elections were the most disturbing and distorted in Kenya's history. The government introduced a highly controversial system of \"queue\" voting. Voters lined up behind their candidate and election officials counted each line and then told the people to go home. When election officials announced the winner, it was often the candidate with the shortest line of voters behind him! Since the voters were at home, there was nothing that could be done: The winner had been declared.

Her husband campaigned again for a seat in Parliament, hoping to represent the [[Langata Constituency|Lang'ata constituency]], and won. During his campaign, he had promised to find jobs to limit the rising unemployment in Kenya. These promises led Maathai to connect her ideas of environmental restoration to providing jobs for the unemployed and led to the founding of Envirocare Ltd., a business that involved the planting of trees to conserve the environment, involving ordinary people in the process. This led to the planting of her first tree nursery, collocated with a government tree nursery in [[Karura Forest]]. Envirocare ran into multiple problems, primarily dealing with funding. The project failed. However, through conversations concerning Envirocare and her work at the Environment Liaison Centre, UNEP made it possible to send Maathai to the first [[Habitat I|UN conference on human settlements]], known as Habitat I, in June 1976.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 125\u2013129.</ref>\n\nIn 1977, Maathai spoke to the NCWK concerning her attendance at Habitat I. She proposed further tree planting, which the council supported. On 5 June 1977, marking World Environment Day, the NCWK marched in a procession from [[Kenyatta International Conference Centre]] in downtown Nairobi to Kamukunji Park on the outskirts of the city, where they planted seven trees in honour of historical community leaders. This was the first \"Green Belt\", which was first known as the \"Save the Land Harambee\" and then became the [[Green Belt Movement]].<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 130\u2013132.</ref> Maathai encouraged the women of Kenya to plant tree nurseries throughout the country, searching nearby forests for seeds to grow trees native to the area. She agreed to pay the women a small stipend for each seedling which was later planted elsewhere.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 134\u2013137.</ref>\n\nIn her 2010 book, ''Replenishing the Earth: Spiritual Values for Healing Ourselves and the World'', she discussed the impact of the Green Belt Movement, explaining that the group's civic and environmental seminars stressed \"the importance of communities taking responsibility for their actions and mobilizing to address their local needs,\" and adding, \"We all need to work hard to make a difference in our neighborhoods, regions, and countries, and in the world as a whole. That means making sure we work hard, collaborate with each other, and make ourselves better agents to change.\" <ref>Snyder, Laurie. \"[https://thecontemplativetraveler.wordpress.com/2016/10/09/god-is-green-as-well-as-good-how-nobel-laureate-wangari-maathai-changed-the-world/ God Is Green as Well as Good: How Nobel Laureate Wangari Maathai Changed the World One Tree at a Time].\" ''The Contemplative Traveler'', 9 October 2016.</ref>\n\n===1977\u20131979: Personal problems===\nMaathai and her husband, Mwangi Mathai, separated in 1977. After a lengthy separation, Mwangi filed for divorce in 1979. He was said to have believed that Wangari was \"too strong-minded for a woman\" and that he was \"unable to control her\". In addition to naming her as \"cruel\" in court filings, he publicly accused her of adultery with another Member of Parliament,<ref name=\"NYTNairobiJournal\">Perlez, Jane, [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/06/world/nairobi-journal-skyscraper-s-enemy-draws-a-daily-dose-of-scorn.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm \"Nairobi Journal; Skyscraper's Enemy Draws a Daily Dose of Scorn\"], ''The New York Times'', 6 December 1989.

Shortly after the trial, in an interview with ''Viva'' magazine, Maathai referred to the judge as either incompetent or corrupt.<ref name=\"NYTNairobiJournal\"/> The interview later led the judge to charge Maathai with contempt of court. She was found guilty and sentenced to six months in jail. After three days in Lang'ata Women's Prison in Nairobi, her lawyer formulated a statement which the court found sufficient for her release. Shortly after the divorce, her former husband sent a letter via his lawyer demanding that Maathai drop his surname.

An opportunity arose to work for the [[Economic Commission for Africa]] through the [[United Nations Development Programme]]. As this job required extended travel throughout Africa and was based primarily in [[Lusaka, Zambia]], she was unable to bring her children with her. Maathai chose to send them to her ex-husband and take the job. While she visited them regularly, they lived with their father until 1985.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 151\u2013155.</ref>\n\n===1979\u20131982: Political problems===\nIn 1979, shortly after the divorce, Maathai ran for the position of chairperson of the National Council of Women of Kenya (NCWK), an [[umbrella organization]] consisting of many women's organizations in the country. The newly elected [[President of Kenya]], [[Daniel arap Moi]], tried to limit the amount of influence those of the Kikuyu ethnicity held in the country, including in volunteer civic organizations such as the NCWK. She lost this election by three votes, but was overwhelmingly chosen to be the vice-chairman of the organization. The following year, Maathai again ran for chairman of the NCWK. Again she was opposed, she believes, by the government. When it became apparent that Maathai was going to win the election, [[Maendeleo Ya Wanawake]], a member organization which represented a majority of Kenya's rural women and whose leader was close to Arap Moi, withdrew from the NCWK. Maathai was then elected chairman of the NCWK unopposed. However, Maendeleo Ya Wanawake came to receive a majority of the financial support for women's programs in the country, and NCWK was left virtually bankrupt. Future funding was much more difficult to come by, but the NCWK survived by increasing its focus on the environment and making its presence and work known. Maathai continued to be reelected to serve as chairman of the organization every year until she retired from the position in 1987.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 156\u2013160.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote=It soon became obvious that politics was at play again.

The court sat at nine o'clock on a Saturday morning, but I was required to present my candidacy papers by noon that same day in Nyeri, which is nearly a three-hour drive from Nairobi. Seeing that it would be impossible for me to meet the deadline if I drove, some friends had hired a plane to take me to Nyeri as soon as the court rendered its verdict. By the time the Judge made his final ruling, disqualifying me from running for parliament, it was nearly midday. Even with the plane and favorable ruling, I would have arrived in Nyeri too late.

As required by law, she resigned her position with the University of Nairobi to campaign for office. The courts decided that she was ineligible to run for office because she had not re-registered to vote in the last presidential election in 1979. Maathai believed this to be false and illegal, and brought the matter to court. The court was to meet at nine in the morning, and if she received a favorable ruling, was required to present her candidacy papers in Nyeri by three in the afternoon that day. The judge disqualified her from running on a technicality. {{Clarify|date=May 2013}} When she requested her job back, she was denied.

In the course of her work through the NCWK, she had the opportunity to partner with the executive director of the Norwegian Forestry Society, Wilhelm Elsrud. Maathai then became the coordinator,  in which she poured her efforts into the Green Belt Movement. Along with the partnership for the Norwegian Forestry Society, the movement had also received \"seed money\" from the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Women. These funds allowed for the expansion of the movement, for hiring additional employees to oversee the operations, and for continuing to pay a small stipend to the women who planted seedlings throughout the country. It allowed her to refine the operations of the movement, paying a small stipend to the women's husbands and sons who were literate and able to keep accurate records of seedlings planted.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 168\u2013173.</ref>{{Quote box|salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote=Although I was a highly educated woman, it did not seem odd to me to work with my hands, often with my knees on the ground, alongside rural woman.

But I had no problem with it, and the rural women both accepted and appreciated that I was working with them to improve their lives and the environment. After all, I was a child of the same soil. Education, if it means anything, should not take people away from land, but instill in them, even more, respect for it, because educated people are in a position to understand what is being lost.

During the conference, Maathai arranged seminars and presentations to describe the work the Green Belt Movement was doing in Kenya. She escorted delegates to see nurseries and plant trees. She met Peggy Snyder, the head of UNIFEM, and [[Helvi Sipil\u00e4]], the first woman appointed a UN assistant secretary general. The conference helped to expand funding for the Green Belt Movement and led to the movement's establishing itself outside Kenya. In 1986, with funding from UNEP, the movement expanded throughout Africa and led to the foundation of the Pan-African Green Belt Network. Forty-five representatives from fifteen African countries travelled to Kenya over the next three years to learn how to set up similar programs in their own countries to combat desertification, deforestation, water crises, and rural hunger. The attention the movement received in the media led to Maathai's being honored with numerous awards. The government of Kenya, however, demanded that the Green Belt Movement separate from the NCWK, believing the latter should focus solely on women's issues, not the environment. Therefore, in 1987, Maathai stepped down as chairperson of the NCWK and focused on the newly separate non-governmental organization.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 175\u2013179.</ref>\n\n===Government intervention===\nIn the latter half of the 1980s, the Kenyan government came down against Maathai and the Green Belt Movement. The single-party regime opposed many of the movement's positions regarding democratic rights. The government invoked a colonial-era law prohibiting groups of more than nine people from meeting without a government license. In 1988, the Green Belt Movement carried out pro-democracy activities such as registering voters for the election and pressing for constitutional reform and freedom of expression. The government carried out electoral fraud in the elections to maintain power, according to Maathai.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 180\u2013183.</ref>\n\nIn October 1989, Maathai learned of a plan to construct the 60-storey Kenya Times Media Trust Complex in [[Uhuru Park]]. The complex was intended to house the headquarters of KANU, the ''[[Kenya Times]]'' newspaper, a trading center, offices, an auditorium, galleries, shopping malls, and parking space for 2,000 cars. The plan also included a large statue of President Daniel Arap Moi. Maathai wrote many letters in protest to, among others, the ''Kenya Times'', the Office of the President, the Nairobi city commission, the provincial commissioner, the minister for environment and natural resources, the executive directors of UNEP and the Environment Liaison Centre International, the executive director of the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), the ministry of public works, and the permanent secretary in the department of international security and administration all received letters. She wrote to Sir John Johnson, the British high commissioner in Nairobi, urging him to intervene with Robert Maxwell, a major shareholder in the project, equating the construction of a tower in Uhuru Park to such construction in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] or [[Central Park]] and maintaining that it could not be tolerated.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 184\u2013188.</ref>\n{{Quote box|salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote=When I see Uhuru Park and contemplate its meaning, I feel compelled to fight for it so that my grandchildren may share that dream and that joy of freedom as they one day walk there.|source=Wangar\u0129 Muta Maathai \u2013 ''Unbowed'', p. 192.}}\nThe government refused to respond to her inquiries and protests, instead responding through the media that Maathai was \"a crazy woman\"; that denying the project in Uhuru Park would take more than a small portion of public park land; and proclaiming the project as a \"fine and magnificent work of architecture\" opposed by only the \"ignorant few.\" On 8 November 1989, Parliament expressed outrage at Maathai's actions, complaining of her letters to foreign organizations and calling the Green Belt Movement a bogus organization and its members \"a bunch of divorcees\". They suggested that if Maathai was so comfortable writing to Europeans, perhaps she should go live in Europe.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 190\u2013193.</ref>\n\nDespite Maathai's protests, as well as popular protest growing throughout the city, the ground was broken at Uhuru Park for construction of the complex on 15 November 1989. Maathai sought an injunction in the Kenya High Court to halt construction, but the case was thrown out on 11 December. In his first public comments pertaining to the project, President Daniel Arap Moi stated that those who opposed the project had \"insects in their heads\". On 12 December, in Uhuru Park, during a speech celebrating independence from the British, President Moi suggested Maathai be a proper woman in the African tradition and respect men and be quiet.<ref>''Unbowed'', p. 196.</ref> She was forced by the government to vacate her office, and the Green Belt Movement was moved into her home. The government then audited the Green Belt Movement in an apparent attempt to shut it down. Despite all this, her protests, the government's response \u2013 and the media coverage it garnered \u2013 led foreign investors to cancel the project in January 1990.<ref name=\"Ecologist\">''The Ecologist'' (1 April 2001).

Maathai's name was on the list. The pro-democracy group, known as the [[Forum for the Restoration of Democracy\u2013Kenya|Forum for the Restoration of Democracy]] (FORD), presented its information to the media, calling for a general election. Later that day, Maathai received a warning that one of their members had been arrested. Maathai decided to barricade herself in her home. Shortly thereafter, police arrived and surrounded the house. She was besieged for three days before police cut through the bars she had installed on her windows, came in, and arrested her. She and the other pro-democracy activists who had been arrested were charged with spreading malicious rumors, sedition, and treason. After a day and a half in jail, they were brought to a hearing and released on bail. A variety of international organizations and eight senators (including [[Al Gore]] and [[Edward M. Kennedy]]) put pressure on the Kenyan government to substantiate the charges against the pro-democracy activists or risk damaging relations with the United States. In November 1992, the Kenyan government dropped the charges.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 208\u2013215.</ref>\n\nOn 28 February 1992, while released on bail, Maathai and others took part in a [[hunger strike]] in a corner of Uhuru Park, which they labeled Freedom Corner, to pressure the government to release [[political prisoner]]s. After four days of hunger strike, on 3 March 1992, the police forcibly removed the protesters.

The protest there continued, with Maathai contributing frequently, until early 1993, when the prisoners were finally released.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 217\u2013225.</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Maathai was recognized with various awards internationally, but the Kenyan government did not appreciate her work. In 1991 she received the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] in San Francisco and the [[Hunger Project]]'s Africa Prize for Leadership in London. [[CNN]] aired a three-minute segment about the Goldman prize, but when it aired in Kenya, that segment was cut out. In June 1992, during the long protest at Uhuru Park, both Maathai and President arap Moi travelled to [[Rio de Janeiro]] for the UN Conference on Environment and Development ([[Earth Summit]]). The Kenyan government accused Maathai of inciting women and encouraging them to strip at Freedom Corner, urging that she not be allowed to speak at the summit. Despite this, Maathai was chosen to be a chief spokesperson at the summit.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp.  226\u2013228.</ref>\n\n===Push for democracy===\nDuring the first multi-party [[1992 Kenyan general election|election of Kenya, in 1992]], Maathai strove to unite the opposition and for fair elections in Kenya. The Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) had fractured into [[FORD-Kenya]] (led by [[Oginga Odinga]]) and [[FORD-Asili]] (led by [[Kenneth Matiba]]); former [[Vice-President of Kenya|vice president]] [[Mwai Kibaki]] had left the ruling [[Kenya African National Union]] (KANU) party, and formed the [[Democratic Party (Kenya)|Democratic Party]]. Maathai and many others believed such a fractured opposition would lead to KANU's retaining control of the country, so they formed the Middle Ground Group in an effort to unite the opposition. Maathai was chosen to serve as its chairperson. Also during the election, Maathai and like-minded opposition members formed the Movement for Free and Fair Elections. Despite their efforts, the opposition did not unite, and the ruling KANU party used intimidation and state-held media to win the election, retaining control of parliament.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 230\u2013235.</ref>\n{{Quote box|salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote=It is often difficult to describe to those who live in a free society what life is like in an authoritarian regime.

Such was the case in Kenya, especially during the 1990s.|source=Wangar\u0129 Muta Maathai \u2013 ''Unbowed'', p. 206.}}\n\nThe following year, ethnic clashes occurred throughout Kenya. Maathai believed they were incited by the government, who had warned of stark consequences to [[multi-party democracy]]. Maathai travelled with friends and the press to areas of violence in order to encourage them to cease fighting. With the Green Belt Movement she planted \"trees of peace\", but before long her actions were opposed by the government. The conflict areas were labeled as \"no go zones\", and in February 1993 the president claimed that Maathai had masterminded a distribution of leaflets inciting [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyus]] to attack [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjins]]. After her friend and supporter Dr. Makanga was kidnapped, Maathai chose to go into hiding. While in hiding, Maathai was invited to a meeting in Tokyo of the [[Green Cross International]], an environmental organization recently founded by former Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. When Maathai responded that she could not attend as she did not believe the government would allow her to leave the country and she was in hiding, Gorbachev pressured the government of Kenya to allow her to travel freely. President arap Moi denied limiting her travel, and she was allowed to leave the country, although too late for the meeting in Tokyo. Maathai was again recognized internationally, and she flew to [[Scotland]] to receive the Edinburgh Medal in April 1993. In May she went to Chicago to receive the [[Jane Addams]] International Women's Leadership Award, and in June she attended the UN's [[World Conference on Human Rights]] in Vienna.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 235\u2013252.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[1997 Kenyan general election|elections of 1997]], Maathai again wished to unite the opposition in order to defeat the ruling party. In November, less than two months before the election, she decided to run for parliament and for president as a candidate of the [[Mazingira Green Party of Kenya|Liberal Party]]. Her intentions were widely questioned in the press; many believed she should simply stick to running the Green Belt Movement and stay out of politics. On the day of the election, a rumour that Maathai had withdrawn from the election and endorsed another candidate was printed in the media. Maathai garnered few votes and lost the election.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 254\u2013259.</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1998, Maathai learned of a government plan to privatize large areas of public land in the Karura Forest, just outside Nairobi, and give it to political supporters. Maathai protested this through letters to the government and the press. She went with the Green Belt Movement to Karura Forest, planting trees and protesting the destruction of the forest. On 8 January 1999, a group of protesters including Maathai, six opposition MPs, journalists, international observers, and Green Belt members and supporters returned to the forest to plant a tree in protest. The entry to the forest was guarded by a large group of men. When she tried to plant a tree in an area that had been designated to be cleared for a golf course, the group was attacked. Many of the protesters were injured, including Maathai, four MPs, some of the journalists, and German environmentalists. When she reported the attack to the police, they refused to return with her to the forest to arrest her attackers. However, the attack had been filmed by Maathai's supporters, and the event provoked international outrage.<ref name=\"Ecologist\"/><ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 261\u2013270.</ref> Student protests broke out throughout Nairobi, and some of these groups were violently broken up by the police.

While protesting this and collecting [[petition]] signatures on 7 March 2001, in Wang'uru village near [[Mount Kenya]], Maathai was again arrested. The following day, following international and popular protest at her arrest, she was released without being charged. On 7 July 2001, shortly after planting trees at Freedom Corner in Uhuru Park in Nairobi to commemorate [[Saba Saba Day]], Maathai was again arrested. Later that evening, she was again released without being charged.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 280\u2013284.</ref> In January 2002, Maathai returned to teaching as the Dorothy McCluskey Visiting Fellow for Conservation at the [[Yale University]]'s [[Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies|School of Forestry and Environmental Studies]].

Her husband campaigned again for a seat in Parliament, hoping to represent the [[Langata Constituency|Lang'ata constituency]], and won. During his campaign, he had promised to find jobs to limit the rising unemployment in Kenya. These promises led Maathai to connect her ideas of environmental restoration to providing jobs for the unemployed and led to the founding of Envirocare Ltd., a business that involved the planting of trees to conserve the environment, involving ordinary people in the process. This led to the planting of her first tree nursery, collocated with a government tree nursery in [[Karura Forest]]. Envirocare ran into multiple problems, primarily dealing with funding. The project failed. However, through conversations concerning Envirocare and her work at the Environment Liaison Centre, UNEP made it possible to send Maathai to the first [[Habitat I|UN conference on human settlements]], known as Habitat I, in June 1976.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 125\u2013129.</ref>\n\nIn 1977, Maathai spoke to the NCWK concerning her attendance at Habitat I.

Shortly after the trial, in an interview with ''Viva'' magazine, Maathai referred to the judge as either incompetent or corrupt.<ref name=\"NYTNairobiJournal\"/> The interview later led the judge to charge Maathai with contempt of court. She was found guilty and sentenced to six months in jail. After three days in Lang'ata Women's Prison in Nairobi, her lawyer formulated a statement which the court found sufficient for her release. Shortly after the divorce, her former husband sent a letter via his lawyer demanding that Maathai drop his surname.

An opportunity arose to work for the [[Economic Commission for Africa]] through the [[United Nations Development Programme]]. As this job required extended travel throughout Africa and was based primarily in [[Lusaka, Zambia]], she was unable to bring her children with her.

The newly elected [[President of Kenya]], [[Daniel arap Moi]], tried to limit the amount of influence those of the Kikuyu ethnicity held in the country, including in volunteer civic organizations such as the NCWK. She lost this election by three votes, but was overwhelmingly chosen to be the vice-chairman of the organization. The following year, Maathai again ran for chairman of the NCWK. Again she was opposed, she believes, by the government. When it became apparent that Maathai was going to win the election, [[Maendeleo Ya Wanawake]], a member organization which represented a majority of Kenya's rural women and whose leader was close to Arap Moi, withdrew from the NCWK. Maathai was then elected chairman of the NCWK unopposed. However, Maendeleo Ya Wanawake came to receive a majority of the financial support for women's programs in the country, and NCWK was left virtually bankrupt. Future funding was much more difficult to come by, but the NCWK survived by increasing its focus on the environment and making its presence and work known. Maathai continued to be reelected to serve as chairman of the organization every year until she retired from the position in 1987.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 156\u2013160.</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote=It soon became obvious that politics was at play again.

As required by law, she resigned her position with the University of Nairobi to campaign for office. The courts decided that she was ineligible to run for office because she had not re-registered to vote in the last presidential election in 1979. Maathai believed this to be false and illegal, and brought the matter to court. The court was to meet at nine in the morning, and if she received a favorable ruling, was required to present her candidacy papers in Nyeri by three in the afternoon that day. The judge disqualified her from running on a technicality. {{Clarify|date=May 2013}} When she requested her job back, she was denied.

In the course of her work through the NCWK, she had the opportunity to partner with the executive director of the Norwegian Forestry Society, Wilhelm Elsrud. Maathai then became the coordinator,  in which she poured her efforts into the Green Belt Movement. Along with the partnership for the Norwegian Forestry Society, the movement had also received \"seed money\" from the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Women. These funds allowed for the expansion of the movement, for hiring additional employees to oversee the operations, and for continuing to pay a small stipend to the women who planted seedlings throughout the country.

During the conference, Maathai arranged seminars and presentations to describe the work the Green Belt Movement was doing in Kenya. She escorted delegates to see nurseries and plant trees. She met Peggy Snyder, the head of UNIFEM, and [[Helvi Sipil\u00e4]], the first woman appointed a UN assistant secretary general. The conference helped to expand funding for the Green Belt Movement and led to the movement's establishing itself outside Kenya. In 1986, with funding from UNEP, the movement expanded throughout Africa and led to the foundation of the Pan-African Green Belt Network. Forty-five representatives from fifteen African countries travelled to Kenya over the next three years to learn how to set up similar programs in their own countries to combat desertification, deforestation, water crises, and rural hunger. The attention the movement received in the media led to Maathai's being honored with numerous awards. The government of Kenya, however, demanded that the Green Belt Movement separate from the NCWK, believing the latter should focus solely on women's issues, not the environment. Therefore, in 1987, Maathai stepped down as chairperson of the NCWK and focused on the newly separate non-governmental organization.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 175\u2013179.</ref>\n\n===Government intervention===\nIn the latter half of the 1980s, the Kenyan government came down against Maathai and the Green Belt Movement. The single-party regime opposed many of the movement's positions regarding democratic rights. The government invoked a colonial-era law prohibiting groups of more than nine people from meeting without a government license. In 1988, the Green Belt Movement carried out pro-democracy activities such as registering voters for the election and pressing for constitutional reform and freedom of expression. The government carried out electoral fraud in the elections to maintain power, according to Maathai.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 180\u2013183.</ref>\n\nIn October 1989, Maathai learned of a plan to construct the 60-storey Kenya Times Media Trust Complex in [[Uhuru Park]]. The complex was intended to house the headquarters of KANU, the ''[[Kenya Times]]'' newspaper, a trading center, offices, an auditorium, galleries, shopping malls, and parking space for 2,000 cars. The plan also included a large statue of President Daniel Arap Moi. Maathai wrote many letters in protest to, among others, the ''Kenya Times'', the Office of the President, the Nairobi city commission, the provincial commissioner, the minister for environment and natural resources, the executive directors of UNEP and the Environment Liaison Centre International, the executive director of the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), the ministry of public works, and the permanent secretary in the department of international security and administration all received letters. She wrote to Sir John Johnson, the British high commissioner in Nairobi, urging him to intervene with Robert Maxwell, a major shareholder in the project, equating the construction of a tower in Uhuru Park to such construction in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] or [[Central Park]] and maintaining that it could not be tolerated.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 184\u2013188.</ref>\n{{Quote box|salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote=When I see Uhuru Park and contemplate its meaning, I feel compelled to fight for it so that my grandchildren may share that dream and that joy of freedom as they one day walk there.|source=Wangar\u0129 Muta Maathai \u2013 ''Unbowed'', p. 192.}}\nThe government refused to respond to her inquiries and protests, instead responding through the media that Maathai was \"a crazy woman\"; that denying the project in Uhuru Park would take more than a small portion of public park land; and proclaiming the project as a \"fine and magnificent work of architecture\" opposed by only the \"ignorant few.\" On 8 November 1989, Parliament expressed outrage at Maathai's actions, complaining of her letters to foreign organizations and calling the Green Belt Movement a bogus organization and its members \"a bunch of divorcees\". They suggested that if Maathai was so comfortable writing to Europeans, perhaps she should go live in Europe.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 190\u2013193.</ref>\n\nDespite Maathai's protests, as well as popular protest growing throughout the city, the ground was broken at Uhuru Park for construction of the complex on 15 November 1989. Maathai sought an injunction in the Kenya High Court to halt construction, but the case was thrown out on 11 December. In his first public comments pertaining to the project, President Daniel Arap Moi stated that those who opposed the project had \"insects in their heads\". On 12 December, in Uhuru Park, during a speech celebrating independence from the British, President Moi suggested Maathai be a proper woman in the African tradition and respect men and be quiet.<ref>''Unbowed'', p. 196.</ref> She was forced by the government to vacate her office, and the Green Belt Movement was moved into her home. The government then audited the Green Belt Movement in an apparent attempt to shut it down.

Maathai's name was on the list. The pro-democracy group, known as the [[Forum for the Restoration of Democracy\u2013Kenya|Forum for the Restoration of Democracy]] (FORD), presented its information to the media, calling for a general election. Later that day, Maathai received a warning that one of their members had been arrested. Maathai decided to barricade herself in her home. Shortly thereafter, police arrived and surrounded the house. She was besieged for three days before police cut through the bars she had installed on her windows, came in, and arrested her. She and the other pro-democracy activists who had been arrested were charged with spreading malicious rumors, sedition, and treason. After a day and a half in jail, they were brought to a hearing and released on bail. A variety of international organizations and eight senators (including [[Al Gore]] and [[Edward M. Kennedy]]) put pressure on the Kenyan government to substantiate the charges against the pro-democracy activists or risk damaging relations with the United States. In November 1992, the Kenyan government dropped the charges.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 208\u2013215.</ref>\n\nOn 28 February 1992, while released on bail, Maathai and others took part in a [[hunger strike]] in a corner of Uhuru Park, which they labeled Freedom Corner, to pressure the government to release [[political prisoner]]s.

In 1991 she received the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] in San Francisco and the [[Hunger Project]]'s Africa Prize for Leadership in London. [[CNN]] aired a three-minute segment about the Goldman prize, but when it aired in Kenya, that segment was cut out. In June 1992, during the long protest at Uhuru Park, both Maathai and President arap Moi travelled to [[Rio de Janeiro]] for the UN Conference on Environment and Development ([[Earth Summit]]). The Kenyan government accused Maathai of inciting women and encouraging them to strip at Freedom Corner, urging that she not be allowed to speak at the summit. Despite this, Maathai was chosen to be a chief spokesperson at the summit.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp.  226\u2013228.</ref>\n\n===Push for democracy===\nDuring the first multi-party [[1992 Kenyan general election|election of Kenya, in 1992]], Maathai strove to unite the opposition and for fair elections in Kenya.

Maathai and many others believed such a fractured opposition would lead to KANU's retaining control of the country, so they formed the Middle Ground Group in an effort to unite the opposition. Maathai was chosen to serve as its chairperson. Also during the election, Maathai and like-minded opposition members formed the Movement for Free and Fair Elections.

With the Green Belt Movement she planted \"trees of peace\", but before long her actions were opposed by the government. The conflict areas were labeled as \"no go zones\", and in February 1993 the president claimed that Maathai had masterminded a distribution of leaflets inciting [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyus]] to attack [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjins]]. After her friend and supporter Dr. Makanga was kidnapped, Maathai chose to go into hiding. While in hiding, Maathai was invited to a meeting in Tokyo of the [[Green Cross International]], an environmental organization recently founded by former Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. When Maathai responded that she could not attend as she did not believe the government would allow her to leave the country and she was in hiding, Gorbachev pressured the government of Kenya to allow her to travel freely. President arap Moi denied limiting her travel, and she was allowed to leave the country, although too late for the meeting in Tokyo. Maathai was again recognized internationally, and she flew to [[Scotland]] to receive the Edinburgh Medal in April 1993. In May she went to Chicago to receive the [[Jane Addams]] International Women's Leadership Award, and in June she attended the UN's [[World Conference on Human Rights]] in Vienna.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 235\u2013252.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[1997 Kenyan general election|elections of 1997]], Maathai again wished to unite the opposition in order to defeat the ruling party. In November, less than two months before the election, she decided to run for parliament and for president as a candidate of the [[Mazingira Green Party of Kenya|Liberal Party]]. Her intentions were widely questioned in the press; many believed she should simply stick to running the Green Belt Movement and stay out of politics. On the day of the election, a rumour that Maathai had withdrawn from the election and endorsed another candidate was printed in the media. Maathai garnered few votes and lost the election.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 254\u2013259.</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1998, Maathai learned of a government plan to privatize large areas of public land in the Karura Forest, just outside Nairobi, and give it to political supporters. Maathai protested this through letters to the government and the press. She went with the Green Belt Movement to Karura Forest, planting trees and protesting the destruction of the forest. On 8 January 1999, a group of protesters including Maathai, six opposition MPs, journalists, international observers, and Green Belt members and supporters returned to the forest to plant a tree in protest. The entry to the forest was guarded by a large group of men. When she tried to plant a tree in an area that had been designated to be cleared for a golf course, the group was attacked. Many of the protesters were injured, including Maathai, four MPs, some of the journalists, and German environmentalists. When she reported the attack to the police, they refused to return with her to the forest to arrest her attackers. However, the attack had been filmed by Maathai's supporters, and the event provoked international outrage.<ref name=\"Ecologist\"/><ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 261\u2013270.</ref> Student protests broke out throughout Nairobi, and some of these groups were violently broken up by the police. Protests continued until 16 August 1999, when the president announced that he was banning all allocation of public land.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 270\u2013271.</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the government again planned to take public forest land and give it to its supporters. While protesting this and collecting [[petition]] signatures on 7 March 2001, in Wang'uru village near [[Mount Kenya]], Maathai was again arrested. The following day, following international and popular protest at her arrest, she was released without being charged. On 7 July 2001, shortly after planting trees at Freedom Corner in Uhuru Park in Nairobi to commemorate [[Saba Saba Day]], Maathai was again arrested. Later that evening, she was again released without being charged.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 280\u2013284.</ref> In January 2002, Maathai returned to teaching as the Dorothy McCluskey Visiting Fellow for Conservation at the [[Yale University]]'s [[Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies|School of Forestry and Environmental Studies]]. She remained there until June 2002, teaching a course on sustainable development focused on the work of the Green Belt Movement.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 284\u2013285.</ref>\n\n===Election to parliament===\n[[File:Wangari_Maathai_social_forum.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Wangari Maathai speaks about deforestation]]\nUpon her return to Kenya, Maathai again campaigned for parliament in the [[2002 Kenyan general election|2002 elections]], this time as a candidate of the [[National Rainbow Coalition]], the umbrella organization which finally united the opposition. On 27 December 2002, the Rainbow Coalition defeated the ruling party [[Kenya African National Union]], and in [[Tetu Constituency]] Maathai won with an overwhelming 98% of the vote.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 286\u2013289.</ref> In January 2003, she was appointed Assistant Minister in the Ministry for Environment and Natural Resources and served in that capacity until November 2005.<ref name=\"UNCCD\"/> She founded the [[Mazingira Green Party of Kenya]] in 2003 to allow candidates to run on a platform of conservation as embodied by the Green Belt Movement.

Between 1901 and 2018, only 52 nobel prize awards were given to women, while 852 nobel prize awards have been given to men. Through her significant efforts, Wangari Maathai became the first African woman, and the first environmentalist, to win the prize. \n\n{{Quotebox|salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote= I was not prepared to learn that I had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize; I wonder whether anybody ever is.

They knew it was not a joke because happiness was written all over my face. But at the same time, tears streamed from my eyes and onto my cheeks as I turned to them. They, too, were now smiling broadly, some cheering and hugging me as if to both comfort and congratulate me, letting my tears fall on their shoulders and hiding my face from some of my staff, whom they felt shouldn't see me cry.
