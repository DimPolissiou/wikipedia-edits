North Richmond is located 67 kilometres north-west of the [[Sydney central business district]] in the [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of the [[City of Hawkesbury]]. It is separated from Richmond to the south-east by the [[Hawkesbury River]].\n\n==History==\nThe [[Welcome to Country and Acknowledgement of Country|traditional land owners]] of the town and surrounding district are the [[Darug people|Darug]] people. In the early years of European Settlement, the area was known as Enfield. The name was changed at a later date during the 19th century to avoid confusion with Enfield in Sydney's west. While located to the west of the town of Richmond, it is thought to have been named North Richmond because it was north of Richmond Hill. This hill was named by Governor Philip when travelling up the Hawkesbury River in 1789.\n\nIn 1833 the \"Woolpack Inn\" was opened on higher ground near the river crossing, by John Town, a prominent local landowner. In 1874 the name changed to the \"Travellers' Rest\". In 1933 a more modern hotel was built next to the old inn and in 1940 was renamed the \"North Richmond Hotel\".\n\nIn the 1860s a wooden bridge was built across the Hawkesbury River to provide an easier crossing than the ferry or punt which had been used. In 1905 it was replaced by a higher-level bridge which was the largest reinforced concrete bridge to be constructed. It remained so for 20 years. In 1926 a railway branch line between Richmond and Kurrajong was opened. The railway bridge was built right next to the concrete bridge. The line curved to the right at the western end of the bridge before curving back around to cross Bells Line of Road at an angle near the intersection with Grose Vale Road. North Richmond had a railway station. When the line closed in 1952, the railway bridge became part of the roadway.\n\nBeside a hotel and school, North Richmond also had a police station and lockup and a Wesleyan (Methodist) Chapel.\n\n==Population==\nAccording to the [[2016 Australian census|2016 census]] of Population, there were 4,977 people in North Richmond.\n* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 4.4% of the population. \n* 83.4% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 4.5%.   \n* 90.8% of people spoke only English at home. \n* The most common responses for religion were No Religion  25.7%, Anglican 25.3% and Catholic 24.7%.<ref name=\"abs\"/>\n\n==Landmarks==\nNorth Richmond has three main roads. These are Grose Vale Road, [[Bells Line of Road]] and Terrace Road.  North Richmond has a shopping mall consisting of a [[Coles (supermarkets)|Coles supermarket]] and various shops including [[Domino's Pizza]] and [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]]. There is the local primary school called Richmond North Public School and the high school, Colo High School. West of the town is the mountains and east is the [[Hawkesbury River]]. A Panthers Club is located in North Richmond. There are three main parks in North Richmond, John Wellington Oval, Turnbull Oval and Inalls Lane.

Mr George Sanders, formally in charge of the Denominational School, was appointed the first teacher. The 1871 building was demolished to make way for new school buildings in the mid-1960s. [[Colo High School]] was established in 1978 in demountable buildings at North Richmond. The current permanent site was occupied in 1980. The blue and white colours were chosen to match colours selected by the Uniform Committee. Mr Sam Weller, the school's first Deputy Principal, suggested using the school building plan as a basis for the logo.

Recorded in [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]], [[Michigan]], following Eminem's recruitment by [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Jimmy Iovine]], the album features production from Dr. Dre, the [[Bass Brothers]], and Eminem himself. ''The Slim Shady LP'' is his first album with a major label after his first album ''[[Infinite (Eminem album)|Infinite]]'' was released on an independent label in 1996.<ref name=\"Kaufman\"> </ref>\n\nFeaturing [[West Coast hip hop]], [[G-funk]] and [[horrorcore]] musical styles, the majority of ''The Slim Shady LP''<nowiki/>'s lyrical content is written from the perspective of Eminem's [[alter ego]] Slim Shady, whom he created on the ''[[Slim Shady EP]]'' (1997). ''The Slim Shady LP'' contains cartoonish depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity, which Eminem referred to as \"made-up tales of trailer-park stuff,\" describing it as [[horror film]]-esque, in that it is solely for entertainment value. Although many of the lyrics on the album are intended to be comical, Eminem also depicts his frustrations of living in poverty, especially in more serious songs (though still containing some trademark humour) as \"Rock Bottom\" and \"If I Had\".\n\n''The Slim Shady LP'' debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number one on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart. It received commercial and critical success, with critics praising Eminem for his unique lyrical style, [[dark humor]] lyrics, and eccentric personality.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.revolt.tv/2019/2/23/20824191/7-reasons-eminem-s-the-slim-shady-lp-is-a-classic|title=7 reasons Eminem's 'The Slim Shady LP' is a classic|last=Brown|first=Preezy|date=2019-02-23|website=REVOLT|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref> The first single, \"[[My Name Is]]\", became Eminem's first entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album won [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]] at [[42nd Grammy Awards]], while \"My Name Is\" won [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance|Best Rap Solo Performance]]. In 2000, ''The Slim Shady LP'' was certified [[RIAA certification|quadruple platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\nWhile ''The Slim Shady LP''<nowiki/>'s success turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity, he became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] and a negative influence on American youth. The successes of the music videos that accompanied the album helped recognize Eminem as a video artist, and contributed to the public's understanding of the Slim Shady alter ego.<ref name=\":0\" /> Additionally, the album's success was vital in breaking the stigma that \"[[Caucasian race|caucasians]] cannot [[Rapping|rap]]\".<ref name=\":0\" /> It has since been named by several {{who|date=April 2020}} as one of the greatest albums of all time.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Background ==\nEminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, began rapping at age fourteen. In 1996, his debut album ''[[Infinite (Eminem album)|Infinite]]'', which was recorded at the Bassmint, a recording studio owned by the [[Bass Brothers]], was released under their independent record label [[Web Entertainment]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bozza|1999}}</ref>  ''Infinite'' achieved very little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations.  The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: \"After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier. A lot of it was because of the feedback I got. Motherfuckers was like, 'You're a white boy, what the fuck are you rapping for? Why don't you go into rock & roll?' All that type of shit started pissing me off.\"<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/>  After the release of ''Infinite'', Eminem's personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in a suicide attempt.<ref name=\"allmusicbio\">{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |title=Eminem \u2013 Biography |url=https://allmusic.com/artist/eminem-p347307/biography |work=AllMusic |publisher=Rovi Corporation |accessdate=November 29, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129034257/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eminem-p347307/biography |archivedate=November 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe disappointment of ''Infinite'' inspired Eminem to create the [[alter ego]] Slim Shady: \"Boom, the name hit me, and right away I thought of all these words to rhyme with it.\"<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/>  Slim Shady served as Eminem's vent for his frustrations, and in the spring of 1997, he recorded the eight-song extended play ''[[Slim Shady EP]]''. During this time, Eminem and his girlfriend Kim Scott lived in a high-crime neighborhood with their newborn daughter Hailie, where their house was burglarized numerous times.<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/>  After being evicted from his home, Eminem traveled to [[Los Angeles]] to participate in the Rap Olympics, an annual nationwide [[rap battle]] competition.  He placed second, and the staff at [[Interscope Records]] who attended the Rap Olympics sent a copy of the ''Slim Shady EP'' to company CEO [[Jimmy Iovine]].<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/> Iovine played the tape for hip hop producer [[Dr. Dre]], founder of [[Aftermath Entertainment]].  Dr. Dre recalled, \"In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him. Now.'\"<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/> Some urged Dr. Dre not to take a chance on Eminem because he was white. Dr. Dre responded, \"I don't give a fuck if you're purple. If you can kick it, I'm working with you.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/eminem-blows-up-91979/|title=Eminem Blows Up|last=Bozza|first=Anthony|last2=Bozza|first2=Anthony|date=1999-04-29|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327102046/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/eminem-blows-up-91979/|archive-date=2019-03-27|url-status=live}}</ref> Eminem and Dr. Dre subsequently began work on Eminem's major-label debut album.\n\n==Recording==\n[[File:Dr. Dre.jpg|thumb|190px|Eminem had idolized ''The Slim Shady LP'' co-producer Dr. Dre (''pictured in 2008'') since he was a teenager.]]\n''The Slim Shady LP'' was recorded at Studio 8 at 430 [[M-102 (Michigan highway)|8 Mile Road]] in [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]], [[Michigan]].<ref name=\"Studiowhere\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1494874/slim-shady-studio-up-auction.jhtml|title=Studio Where Eminem Worked On Shady LP Up For Auction|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=December 14, 2004|accessdate=March 4, 2012|work=MTV News|publisher=Viacom|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111120430/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1494874/slim-shady-studio-up-auction.jhtml|archivedate=November 11, 2012}}</ref>  Eminem, who had idolized Dr. Dre since listening to his group [[N.W.A]] as a teenager, was nervous to work with him on the album: \"I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much&nbsp;... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre.\"<ref name=\"Bozza24\">Bozza, 2003. p. 24</ref>  However, Eminem became more comfortable working with Dr. Dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions.<ref name=\"Stubbs58\">Stubbs, 2006. p. 58</ref>  The recording process generally began with Dr. Dre creating a beat and Eminem using the tracks as a template for his [[freestyle rap]]s; \"Every beat he would make, I had a rhyme for\", Eminem recalled.<ref name=\"Stubbs58\"/> He later said: \"Every time I sat down with a pen, everything was just like: fuck you, fuck this, fuck them, fuck that, fuck the world, fuck what everybody thinks. Fuck them.\"<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/>  On the first day of recording, Eminem and Dr. Dre finished \"[[My Name Is]]\" in an hour.<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/>  Three other songs, including \"Role Model\", were also recorded that day.<ref name=\"Bozza24\"/>\n\n\"[['97 Bonnie & Clyde]]\", which was formerly featured on the ''Slim Shady EP'' as \"Just the Two of Us\", was rerecorded for ''The Slim Shady LP'' to feature his daughter Hailie's vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend's corpse, Eminem was not comfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead told her that he would be taking Hailie to [[Chuck E. Cheese's]]. However, he really took her to the recording studio.<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/> He explained, \"When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song and she bugged the fuck out.\" Eminem also said, \"When she (Hailie) gets old enough, I'm going to explain it to her. I'll let her know that Mommy and Daddy weren't getting along at the time. None of it was to be taken too literally, although at the time I wanted to fucking do it.\"<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/>  The song \"[[Guilty Conscience (song)|Guilty Conscience]]\" contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted [[Dee Barnes]].  Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre \"fell out of his chair laughing\" upon hearing the lyric.<ref name=\"Stubbs68\">Stubbs, 2006. p. 68</ref>  \"Ken Kaniff\", a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle.  After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem's breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums. Ken Kaniff would end up appearing in more Eminem albums over the course of his career and was last heard in ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP 2]]''<ref name=\"Bozza43\">Bozza, 2003. p. 43</ref> Another skit, \"Bitch\", is an answering machine message in which Zoe Winkler, daughter of actor [[Henry Winkler]], tells a friend that she was disgusted by Eminem's music.

I'm not a role model, and I don't claim to be.\"<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/>\n\n==Lawsuits==\nOn September 17, 1999, Eminem's mother, Deborah Nelson, filed a $10&nbsp;million lawsuit against him for [[slander]] based on his claim that she uses drugs in the line \"I just found out my mom does more dope than I do\" from \"My Name Is\".<ref name=\"Bozza69\">Bozza, 2003. p. 69</ref><ref name=\"Thereal\">{{cite news|title=INTERVIEW: Who's the real Slim Shady?|last=Verrico|first=Lisa|work=[[Scotland on Sunday]]|publisher=[[Johnston Press]]|date=January 28, 2001}}</ref> After a two-year-long trial, she was awarded $25,000, of which she received $1,600 after legal fees.<ref name=\"Bozza69\"/> Eminem was not surprised that his mother had filed the lawsuit against him, referring to her as a \"lawsuit queen\", and alleging that \"That's how she makes money. When I was five, she had a job on the cash register at a store that sold chips and soda. Other than that, I don't remember her working a day in her life.\"<ref name=\"Thereal\"/> She later filed another lawsuit against him for emotional damages suffered during the first trial, which was later dismissed.<ref name=\"Bozza69\"/>\n\nIn December 2001, DeAngelo Bailey, a janitor living in [[Roseville, Michigan]] who was made the subject of the song \"Brain Damage\" in which he is portrayed as a school bully, filed a $1&nbsp;million lawsuit against Eminem for slander and [[Expectation of privacy|invasion of privacy]].<ref name=\"AllegedBully\"/> Bailey's attorney stated \"Eminem is a Caucasian male who faced criticism within the music industry that he had not suffered through difficult circumstances growing up and he was therefore a 'pretender' in the industry&nbsp;... Eminem used Bailey, his African-American childhood schoolmate, as a pawn in his effort to stem the tide of criticism.\"<ref name=\"AllegedBully\"/> In 1982, Eminem's mother unsuccessfully sued the Roseville school district for not protecting her son, as she claimed that attacks from bullies caused him headaches, nausea, and antisocial behavior.<ref name=\"AllegedBully\"/> Additionally, Bailey had previously admitted to bullying Eminem in the April 1999 issue of ''Rolling Stone Magazine''.<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/> The lawsuit was dismissed by judge [[Deborah Servitto]] in 2003, who wrote her ruling in the form of rap-like rhyme. She ruled that the lyrics\u2014which include the school principal collaborating with Bailey, and Eminem's entire brain falling out of his head\u2014were too exaggerated for a listener to believe that they were recalling an actual event.<ref name=\"victim\"/> The verdict was upheld in 2005, and Bailey's lawyer ruled out any further appeals.<ref name=\"victim\">{{cite news|title=Eminem safe from bully's lawsuit|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4451583.stm|accessdate=June 17, 2016|work=BBC News|date=April 16, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830013737/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4451583.stm|archive-date=August 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2003, 70-year-old widow Harlene Stein filed suit against Eminem and Dr. Dre on the grounds that \"Guilty Conscience\" contains an unauthorized sample of \"Go Home Pigs\" composed for the film ''[[Getting Straight]]'' by her husband, [[Ronald Stein]], who died in 1988.<ref name=\"OldLady\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1478649/eminem-sued-over-sample.jhtml|title=Eminem Gets Sued&nbsp;...

Recorded in [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]], [[Michigan]], following Eminem's recruitment by [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Jimmy Iovine]], the album features production from Dr. Dre, the [[Bass Brothers]], and Eminem himself. ''The Slim Shady LP'' is his first album with a major label after his first album ''[[Infinite (Eminem album)|Infinite]]'' was released on an independent label in 1996.<ref name=\"Kaufman\"> </ref>\n\nFeaturing [[West Coast hip hop]], [[G-funk]] and [[horrorcore]] musical styles, the majority of ''The Slim Shady LP''<nowiki/>'s lyrical content is written from the perspective of Eminem's [[alter ego]] Slim Shady, whom he created on the ''[[Slim Shady EP]]'' (1997). The ''The Slim Shady LP'' contains cartoonish depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity, which Eminem referred to as \"made-up tales of trailer-park stuff,\" describing it as [[horror film]]-esque, in that it is solely for entertainment value. Although many of the lyrics on the album are intended to be comical, Eminem also depicts his frustrations of living in poverty, especially in more serious songs (though still containing some trademark humour) as \"Rock Bottom\" and \"If I Had\".\n\n''The Slim Shady LP'' debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number one on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart. It received commercial and critical success, with critics praising Eminem for his unique lyrical style, [[dark humor]] lyrics, and eccentric personality.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.revolt.tv/2019/2/23/20824191/7-reasons-eminem-s-the-slim-shady-lp-is-a-classic|title=7 reasons Eminem's 'The Slim Shady LP' is a classic|last=Brown|first=Preezy|date=2019-02-23|website=REVOLT|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref> The first single, \"[[My Name Is]]\", became Eminem's first entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album won [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]] at [[42nd Grammy Awards]], while \"My Name Is\" won [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance|Best Rap Solo Performance]]. In 2000, ''The Slim Shady LP'' was certified [[RIAA certification|quadruple platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\nWhile ''The Slim Shady LP''<nowiki/>'s success turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity, he became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] and a negative influence on American youth. The successes of the music videos that accompanied the album helped recognize Eminem as a video artist, and contributed to the public's understanding of the Slim Shady alter ego.<ref name=\":0\" /> Additionally, the album's success was vital in breaking the stigma that \"[[Caucasian race|caucasians]] cannot [[Rapping|rap]]\".<ref name=\":0\" /> It has since been named by several {{who|date=April 2020}} as one of the greatest albums of all time.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Background ==\nEminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, began rapping at age fourteen. In 1996, his debut album ''[[Infinite (Eminem album)|Infinite]]'', which was recorded at the Bassmint, a recording studio owned by the [[Bass Brothers]], was released under their independent record label [[Web Entertainment]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bozza|1999}}</ref>  ''Infinite'' achieved very little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations.  The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: \"After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier. A lot of it was because of the feedback I got. Motherfuckers was like, 'You're a white boy, what the fuck are you rapping for? Why don't you go into rock & roll?' All that type of shit started pissing me off.\"<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/>  After the release of ''Infinite'', Eminem's personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in a suicide attempt.<ref name=\"allmusicbio\">{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |title=Eminem \u2013 Biography |url=https://allmusic.com/artist/eminem-p347307/biography |work=AllMusic |publisher=Rovi Corporation |accessdate=November 29, 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129034257/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/eminem-p347307/biography |archivedate=November 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe disappointment of ''Infinite'' inspired Eminem to create the [[alter ego]] Slim Shady: \"Boom, the name hit me, and right away I thought of all these words to rhyme with it.\"<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/>  Slim Shady served as Eminem's vent for his frustrations, and in the spring of 1997, he recorded the eight-song extended play ''[[Slim Shady EP]]''. During this time, Eminem and his girlfriend Kim Scott lived in a high-crime neighborhood with their newborn daughter Hailie, where their house was burglarized numerous times.<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/>  After being evicted from his home, Eminem traveled to [[Los Angeles]] to participate in the Rap Olympics, an annual nationwide [[rap battle]] competition.  He placed second, and the staff at [[Interscope Records]] who attended the Rap Olympics sent a copy of the ''Slim Shady EP'' to company CEO [[Jimmy Iovine]].<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/> Iovine played the tape for hip hop producer [[Dr. Dre]], founder of [[Aftermath Entertainment]].  Dr. Dre recalled, \"In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him. Now.'\"<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/> Some urged Dr. Dre not to take a chance on Eminem because he was white. Dr. Dre responded, \"I don't give a fuck if you're purple. If you can kick it, I'm working with you.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/eminem-blows-up-91979/|title=Eminem Blows Up|last=Bozza|first=Anthony|last2=Bozza|first2=Anthony|date=1999-04-29|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327102046/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/eminem-blows-up-91979/|archive-date=2019-03-27|url-status=live}}</ref> Eminem and Dr. Dre subsequently began work on Eminem's major-label debut album.\n\n==Recording==\n[[File:Dr. Dre.jpg|thumb|190px|Eminem had idolized ''The Slim Shady LP'' co-producer Dr. Dre (''pictured in 2008'') since he was a teenager.]]\n''The Slim Shady LP'' was recorded at Studio 8 at 430 [[M-102 (Michigan highway)|8 Mile Road]] in [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]], [[Michigan]].<ref name=\"Studiowhere\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1494874/slim-shady-studio-up-auction.jhtml|title=Studio Where Eminem Worked On Shady LP Up For Auction|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=December 14, 2004|accessdate=March 4, 2012|work=MTV News|publisher=Viacom|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111120430/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1494874/slim-shady-studio-up-auction.jhtml|archivedate=November 11, 2012}}</ref>  Eminem, who had idolized Dr. Dre since listening to his group [[N.W.A]] as a teenager, was nervous to work with him on the album: \"I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much&nbsp;... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre.\"<ref name=\"Bozza24\">Bozza, 2003. p. 24</ref>  However, Eminem became more comfortable working with Dr. Dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions.<ref name=\"Stubbs58\">Stubbs, 2006. p. 58</ref>  The recording process generally began with Dr. Dre creating a beat and Eminem using the tracks as a template for his [[freestyle rap]]s; \"Every beat he would make, I had a rhyme for\", Eminem recalled.<ref name=\"Stubbs58\"/> He later said: \"Every time I sat down with a pen, everything was just like: fuck you, fuck this, fuck them, fuck that, fuck the world, fuck what everybody thinks. Fuck them.\"<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/>  On the first day of recording, Eminem and Dr. Dre finished \"[[My Name Is]]\" in an hour.<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/>  Three other songs, including \"Role Model\", were also recorded that day.<ref name=\"Bozza24\"/>\n\n\"[['97 Bonnie & Clyde]]\", which was formerly featured on the ''Slim Shady EP'' as \"Just the Two of Us\", was rerecorded for ''The Slim Shady LP'' to feature his daughter Hailie's vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend's corpse, Eminem was not comfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead told her that he would be taking Hailie to [[Chuck E. Cheese's]]. However, he really took her to the recording studio.<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/> He explained, \"When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song and she bugged the fuck out.\" Eminem also said, \"When she (Hailie) gets old enough, I'm going to explain it to her. I'll let her know that Mommy and Daddy weren't getting along at the time. None of it was to be taken too literally, although at the time I wanted to fucking do it.\"<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/>  The song \"[[Guilty Conscience (song)|Guilty Conscience]]\" contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted [[Dee Barnes]].  Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre \"fell out of his chair laughing\" upon hearing the lyric.<ref name=\"Stubbs68\">Stubbs, 2006. p. 68</ref>  \"Ken Kaniff\", a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle.  After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem's breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums.

The fall was like a reminder.\"<ref name=\"Hasted 125\"/> However, after receiving medical attention, he was well enough to travel to New York the following day for a performance on ''[[Total Request Live]]''.<ref name=\"Huxley79\"/>\n\nEminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content.  He was labeled as \"misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence\", and in an editorial by ''Billboard'' editor in chief [[Timothy White (editor)|Timothy White]], the writer accused Eminem of \"making money by exploiting the world's misery.\"<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/> During a radio interview in San Francisco, Eminem reportedly angered local DJ Sista Tamu due to a [[Freestyle rap|freestyle]] about \"slapping a pregnant bitch\" to the extent that on air she broke a copy of ''The Slim Shady LP''.<ref name=\"Hasted 125\"/> The rapper defended himself by saying, \"My album isn't for younger kids to hear.

Eminem used Bailey, his African-American childhood schoolmate, as a pawn in his effort to stem the tide of criticism.\"<ref name=\"AllegedBully\"/> In 1982, Eminem's mother unsuccessfully sued the Roseville school district for not protecting her son, as she claimed that attacks from bullies caused him headaches, nausea, and antisocial behavior.<ref name=\"AllegedBully\"/> Additionally, Bailey had previously admitted to bullying Eminem in the April 1999 issue of ''Rolling Stone Magazine''.<ref name=\"BlowsUp\"/> The lawsuit was dismissed by judge [[Deborah Servitto]] in 2003, who wrote her ruling in the form of rap-like rhyme.
