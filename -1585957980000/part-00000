It was released as a single on [[Atco Records]] in the U.S. in 1959. It became a multi-million seller, reaching No.2 on the U.S. charts for a week and No.4 on the R&B charts.<ref>{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942\u20132004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=145}}</ref> \"Dream Lover\" was kept from the No.1 spot by \"[[The Battle of New Orleans]]\" by [[Johnny Horton]].

A remake of the song performed by [[Dion DiMucci|Dion]] (1961) is also played in full, during the end credits.

Though the subjects of erotic photography are usually completely or mostly [[nudity|unclothed]], that is not a requirement. \n\nErotic photography should be distinguished from [[nude photography]], which contains nude subjects not necessarily in an erotic situation, and [[Pornography|pornographic photography]], which is of a sexually explicit nature. Pornographic photography generally does not claim any artistic or aesthetic merit.\n\nErotic photographs are normally intended for commercial use, including [[mass-produced]] items such as [[calendar (stationery)| decorative calendar]]s, [[Pin-up model|pinups]] and for [[List of men's magazines|men's magazine]]s, such as ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' and ''[[Playboy]]'', but sometimes the photographs are intended to be seen only by a subject's partner. \n\nThe subjects of erotic photographs may be professional models, celebrities or amateurs. Very few well-known entertainers have posed nude for photographs. The first entertainer to pose nude for photographs was the stage actress [[Adah Isaacs Menken]] (1835\u20131868).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thegreatbare.com/who-is-adah-menken/ |work=The Great Bare |title=Who Is Adah Menken? |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref> On the other hand, a number of well-known [[film star]]s have posed for [[pinup girl]] photographs and been promoted in photography and other media as [[sex symbol]]s. Traditionally, the subjects of erotic photographs have been female, but since the 1970s erotic images of men have also been published.{{dubious|date=October 2019}}<!-- Erotic photos of men have been taken for private collections, if not published, since the 1800s, if I remember the contents of the Museum of Sex in Amsterdam correctly. -->\n==Beginnings==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Nude woman in colored daguerreotype by F\u00e9lix-Jacques Moulin.jpg|Coloured daguerreotype by [[F\u00e9lix-Jacques Moulin]], c.1851\u20131854\nFile:Nu f\u00e9minin allong\u00e9 Am\u00e9lie.jpg|''Recumbent female nude, Am\u00e9lie'' by [[F\u00e9lix-Jacques Moulin]], c.1852\u20131853\nFile:19th century nude.jpg|19th-century nude photograph by unknown photographer\nFile:Vintage nude bust photograph of a young denuded lady.jpg|Bust photograph of a young nude lady by unknown photographer, 19th century\n</gallery>\nBefore 1839, [[depictions of nudity]] and erotica generally consisted of paintings, drawings and engravings.

Artists adopted the new technology as a new way to depict the nude form, which in practice was the feminine form. In so doing, at least initially, they tried to follow the styles and traditions of the art form. Traditionally, in France, an acad\u00e9mie was a nude study done by a painter to master the female (or male) form. Each had to be registered with the French government and approved or they could not be sold. Soon, nude photographs were being registered as acad\u00e9mie and marketed as aids to painters. However, the realism of a photograph as opposed to the idealism of a painting made many of these intrinsically erotic.<ref name=history>{{cite video|people=Chris Rodley, Dev Varma, Kate Williams III (Directors) Marilyn Milgrom, Grant Romer, Rolf Borowczak, Bob Guccione, Dean Kuipers (Cast) |date=2006-03-07 |title=Pornography: The Secret History of Civilization |url=http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |medium=DVD |publisher=Koch Vision |location=Port Washington, NY |accessdate=2006-10-21 |isbn=1-4172-2885-7 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822002054/http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |archivedate=2010-08-22 }}</ref>\n\nIn ''Nude Photography, 1840\u20131920'', Peter Marshall notes: \"In the prevailing moral climate at the time of the invention of photography, the only officially sanctioned photography of the body was for the production of artist's studies. Many of the surviving examples of daguerreotypes are clearly not in this genre but have a sensuality that clearly implies they were designed as [[erotic]] or pornographic images\".<ref name=\"about1\">{{cite web\n|url = http://photography.about.com/library/weekly/aa013100a.htm\n|title = Nude photography, 1840-1920, Part 1: The Body\n|last = Marshall\n|first = Peter\n|work = About: Photography\n|publisher = The New York Times Company\n|pages =\n|language =\n|doi =\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070218141330/http://photography.about.com/library/weekly/aa013100a.htm\n|archivedate = 2007-02-18\n|quote =\n}}</ref>\n\nThe daguerreotypes were not without drawbacks, however. The main difficulty was that they could only be reproduced by photographing the original picture since each image was an original and the all-metal process does not use [[negative (photography)|negatives]]. In addition, the earliest daguerreotypes had exposure times ranging from three to fifteen minutes, making them somewhat impractical for [[portrait photography|portraiture]]. Unlike earlier drawings, action could not be shown. The poses that the models struck had to be held very still for a long time. Another limitation was the monochrome image that the technology could produce. Because of this, the standard pornographic image shifted from one of two or more people engaged in sex acts to a solitary woman exposing her [[genitals]]. The cost of the process also limited the spread of the technology. Since one picture could cost a week's salary, the audience for nudes mostly consisted of artists and the upper echelon of society.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lisaskirts.com/MaleSubs_V.htm | title=LisaSkirts.com | accessdate=2006-10-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310235038/http://www.lisaskirts.com/MaleSubs_V.htm|archivedate=2006-03-10 }}</ref> \n\n[[Stereoscope|Stereoscopy]] was invented in 1838 and became extremely popular for daguerreotypes,<ref>{{cite journal| last = Wheatstone| first = Charles| title = Contributions to the Physiology of Vision.\u2014Part the First.

This technology produced a type of [[three-dimensional space|three dimensional]] view that suited erotic images quite well. Although thousands of erotic daguerreotypes were created, only around 800 are known to survive; however, their uniqueness and expense meant that they were once the toys of rich men. Due to their rarity, the works can sell for more than \u00a3GB 10,000.<ref name = history />\n\n=== The calotype process ===\nIn 1841, [[William Fox Talbot]] patented the [[calotype]] process, the first negative-positive process, making possible multiple copies.<ref name=glasgow>{{cite web|last=Schaaf |first=Larry |title=The Calotype Process |publisher=Glasgow University Library |year=1999 |url=http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/hillandadamson/calo.html |accessdate=2006-08-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619221733/http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/hillandadamson/calo.html |archivedate=2006-06-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This invention permitted an almost limitless number of prints to be produced from a glass negative. The technology also reduced the exposure time and made possible a true mass market for low cost commercial photography. The technology was immediately employed to reproduce nude portraits, classified by the standards of the time as pornographic. Paris soon became the centre of this trade. In 1848 only thirteen photography studios existed in Paris; by 1860, there were over 400. Most of them made income from the sale of illicit nude images to the masses who could now afford it. The pictures were also sold near [[train station]]s, by traveling salesmen and women in the streets who hid them under their dresses. They were often produced in sets (of four, eight or twelve), and exported internationally, mainly to England and the United States. Both the models and the photographers were commonly from the working class, and the artistic model excuse was increasingly hard to use. By 1855, no more photographic nudes were being registered as acad\u00e9mie, and the business had gone underground to escape prosecution.<ref name = history />\n\n=== The Victorian tradition ===\n[[File:Female nude motion study by Eadweard Muybridge.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Eadweard Muybridge]]: Woman walking with fishing pole (detail)]]\n\nThe Victorian pornographic tradition in Britain had three main elements: French photographs, erotic prints (sold in shops in Holywell Street, a long vanished London thoroughfare, swept away by the [[Aldwych]]), and printed literature. The ability to reproduce photographs in bulk assisted the rise of a new business individual, the porn dealer. Many of these dealers used the [[postal system]] to distribute erotic photography, sending the photographic cards to subscribers in plain wrappings. Victorian pornography had several defining characteristics. It reflected a very mechanistic view of the [[human anatomy]] and its functions. Science, the new obsession, was invoked to ostensibly study the nude human body. Consequently, the sexuality of the subject is often depersonalised, and is without any passion or tenderness. At this time, it also became popular to depict nude photographs of women of exotic ethnicities, under the umbrella of science. \n\nStudies of this type can be found in the work of [[Eadweard Muybridge]]. Although he photographed both men and women, the women were often given [[theatrical property|props]] like market baskets and fishing poles, making the images of women thinly disguised erotica.<ref name = history /> \n\nParallel to the British printing history, photographers and printers in France frequently turned to the medium of [[postcard]]s, producing great numbers of them. Such cards came to be known in the US as \"[[French postcard]]s\".<ref>''The Color of Words: An Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Ethnic Bias in the United States'', Philip Herbst.

Picture postcards allowed and encouraged many individuals to send images across national borders, and the legal availability of a postcard image in one country did not guarantee that the card would be considered \"proper\" in the destination country, or in the intermediate countries that the card would have to pass through. Some countries refused to handle postcards containing sexual references (such as of seaside scenes) or images of full or partial nudity (including images of classical statuary or paintings). Many [[French postcard]]s featured naked women in erotic poses. These were described as postcards but whose primary purpose was not for sending by post because they would have been banned from delivery. Street dealers, tobacco shops, and a variety of other vendors bought the photographs for resale to tourists. The sale of erotica was banned, and many of these postcards were sold \"under the counter\".\n\nInstead, nude and erotic photographs were marketed in a monthly magazine called ''La Beaut\u00e9'' that was ostensibly targeted for artists looking for poses. Each issue contained 75 nude images which could be ordered by mail, in the form of postcards, hand-tinted or sepia toned.\n\n==Early 20th century==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Bellocq Storyville undamaged.jpg|Portrait by [[E.

The [[Ur-Leica]] was a compact camera based on the idea of reducing the format of negatives and enlarging them later, after they had been exposed. This small, portable device made nude photography in secluded parks and other semi-public places easier, and represented a great advance for amateur erotica. Artists were enamored with their new ability to take impromptu photos without carrying around a clunky apparatus.\n\nEarly 20th century artist [[E. J. Bellocq]], who made his best known images with the older style glass plate negatives, is best remembered for his down-to-earth pictures of prostitutes in domestic settings in the [[Storyville, New Orleans|Storyville]] red light district of [[New Orleans]]. In contrast to the usual pictures of women awkwardly posed amid drapery, veils, flowers, fruit, classical columns and oriental braziers, Bellocq's sitters appear relaxed and comfortable. David Steinberg speculates that the prostitutes may have felt at ease with Bellocq because he was \"so much of a fellow outcast.\"\n\nOther photographers of nude women of this period include [[Alexandre-Jacques Chantron]], [[Jean Ag\u00e9lou]]<ref>{{cite book\n|last = Bourdon\n|first = Christian \n|title = Jean Ag\u00e9lou: De l'acad\u00e9misme \u00e0 la photo de charme\n|language = french\n|year = 2006 \n|editor = Marval\n|publisher = Par\u00eds\n|isbn= 978-2862343945\n|pages=\n}}</ref> and [[Alfred Cheney Johnston]].

Bellocq, for instance, frequently scratched out the faces of his sitters to obscure their identities. Some of his other sitters were photographed wearing masks. Peter Marshall writes, \"Even in the relatively bohemian atmosphere of Carmel, California in the 1920s and '30s, [[Edward Weston]] had to photograph many of his models without showing their faces, and some 75 years on, many communities are less open about such things than Carmel was then.\"<ref name=\"about3\">{{cite web\n|url = http://photography.about.com/library/weekly/aa032403c.htm\n|title = Nude 101: A Beginners Guide to Nude Photography, Part 3: Finding Models\n|last = Marshall\n|first = Peter\n|work = About: Photography\n|publisher = The New York Times Company\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070604053329/http://photography.about.com/library/weekly/aa032403c.htm\n|archivedate = 2007-06-04\n|quote =\n}}</ref>\n\n==Later 20th century==\nNude photographers of the mid-20th century include Walter Bird, [[John Everard (photographer)|John Everard]], [[Horace Roye]], [[Harrison Marks]] and [[Zolt\u00e1n Glass]].

The image is now considered one of the major pre-war photographs of the 20th century.\n=== The Second World War ===\nDuring the [[Second World War]], [[pin-up girl]] photographs reached a wide audience. Unlike earlier erotic photographs, whose subjects were usually anonymous, a number of well-known [[film star]]s posed for pin-up photographs and they were promoted as sex symbols. The emphasis was initially on bare legs, short skirts or swim suits and shapely figures; but in the 1950s such photos started to show naked breasts. \n=== ''Playboy'' and ''Penthouse'' ===\n''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, founded in 1953, achieved great popularity and soon established the market for men's and lifestyle magazines. Erotic photography soon became closely associated with it and gained increasing public attention. \n\nFounded in 1965, [[Penthouse (magazine)|''Penthouse'' magazine]] went a step further than ''Playboy'' and was the first to clearly display genitals, initially covered with [[pubic hair]]. The models looked usually directly into the camera, as if they would enter into relationship with the mostly male viewers. \n=== ''Cleo'' and male nude ===\nIn the 1970s, in the mood of feminism, gender equality and light humour, magazines such as [[Cleo (magazine)|''Cleo'']] included male nude centrefolds. \n\nUnlike the traditional erotic photographs, which use any attractive female subjects, the male nude photographs are usually of celebrities.\n\n=== Internet ===\nThe spread of the Internet in the 1990s and increasing social liberalization brought a renewed upsurge of erotic photography.

Though the subjects of erotic photography are usually completely or mostly [[nudity|unclothed]], that is not a requirement. \n\nErotic photography should be distinguished from [[nude photography]], which contains nude subjects not necessarily in an erotic situation, and [[Pornography|pornographic photography]], which is of a sexually explicit nature. Pornographic photography generally does not claim any artistic or aesthetic merit.\n\nErotic photographs are normally intended for commercial use, including [[mass-produced]] items such as [[calendar (stationery)| decorative calendar]]s, [[Pin-up model|pinups]] and for [[List of men's magazines|men's magazine]]s, such as ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' and ''[[Playboy]]'', but sometimes the photographs are intended to be seen only by a subject's partner. \n\nThe subjects of erotic photographs may be professional models, celebrities or amateurs. Very few well-known entertainers have posed nude for photographs. The first entertainer to pose nude for photographs was the stage actress [[Adah Isaacs Menken]] (1835\u20131868).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thegreatbare.com/who-is-adah-menken/ |work=The Great Bare |title=Who Is Adah Menken? |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref> On the other hand, a number of well-known [[film star]]s have posed for [[pinup girl]] photographs and been promoted in photography and other media as [[sex symbol]]s. Traditionally, the subjects of erotic photographs have been female, but since the 1970s erotic images of men have also been published.{{dubious|date=October 2019}}<!-- Erotic photos of men have been taken for private collections, if not published, since the 1800s, if I remember the contents of the Museum of Sex in Amsterdam correctly. -->\n==Beginnings==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Nude woman in colored daguerreotype by F\u00e9lix-Jacques Moulin.jpg|Coloured daguerreotype by [[F\u00e9lix-Jacques Moulin]], c.1851\u20131854\nFile:Nu f\u00e9minin allong\u00e9 Am\u00e9lie.jpg|''Recumbent female nude, Am\u00e9lie'' by [[F\u00e9lix-Jacques Moulin]], c.1852\u20131853\nFile:19th century nude.jpg|19th-century nude photograph by unknown photographer\nFile:Vintage nude bust photograph of a young denuded lady.jpg|Bust photograph of a young nude lady by unknown photographer, 19th century\n</gallery>\nBefore 1839, [[depictions of nudity]] and erotica generally consisted of paintings, drawings and engravings.

Artists adopted the new technology as a new way to depict the nude form, which in practice was the feminine form. In so doing, at least initially, they tried to follow the styles and traditions of the art form. Traditionally, in France, an acad\u00e9mie was a nude study done by a painter to master the female (or male) form. Each had to be registered with the French government and approved or they could not be sold. Soon, nude photographs were being registered as acad\u00e9mie and marketed as aids to painters. However, the realism of a photograph as opposed to the idealism of a painting made many of these intrinsically erotic.<ref name=history>{{cite video|people=Chris Rodley, Dev Varma, Kate Williams III (Directors) Marilyn Milgrom, Grant Romer, Rolf Borowczak, Bob Guccione, Dean Kuipers (Cast) |date=2006-03-07 |title=Pornography: The Secret History of Civilization |url=http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |medium=DVD |publisher=Koch Vision |location=Port Washington, NY |accessdate=2006-10-21 |isbn=1-4172-2885-7 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822002054/http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |archivedate=2010-08-22 }}</ref>\n\nIn ''Nude Photography, 1840\u20131920'', Peter Marshall notes: \"In the prevailing moral climate at the time of the invention of photography, the only officially sanctioned photography of the body was for the production of artist's studies. Many of the surviving examples of daguerreotypes are clearly not in this genre but have a sensuality that clearly implies they were designed as [[erotic]] or pornographic images\".<ref name=\"about1\">{{cite web\n|url = http://photography.about.com/library/weekly/aa013100a.htm\n|title = Nude photography, 1840-1920, Part 1: The Body\n|last = Marshall\n|first = Peter\n|work = About: Photography\n|publisher = The New York Times Company\n|pages =\n|language =\n|doi =\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070218141330/http://photography.about.com/library/weekly/aa013100a.htm\n|archivedate = 2007-02-18\n|quote =\n}}</ref>\n\nThe daguerreotypes were not without drawbacks, however. The main difficulty was that they could only be reproduced by photographing the original picture since each image was an original and the all-metal process does not use [[negative (photography)|negatives]]. In addition, the earliest daguerreotypes had exposure times ranging from three to fifteen minutes, making them somewhat impractical for [[portrait photography|portraiture]]. Unlike earlier drawings, action could not be shown. The poses that the models struck had to be held very still for a long time. Another limitation was the monochrome image that the technology could produce. Because of this, the standard pornographic image shifted from one of two or more people engaged in sex acts to a solitary woman exposing her [[genitals]]. The cost of the process also limited the spread of the technology. Since one picture could cost a week's salary, the audience for nudes mostly consisted of artists and the upper echelon of society.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lisaskirts.com/MaleSubs_V.htm | title=LisaSkirts.com | accessdate=2006-10-05|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060310235038/http://www.lisaskirts.com/MaleSubs_V.htm|archivedate=2006-03-10 }}</ref> \n\n[[Stereoscope|Stereoscopy]] was invented in 1838 and became extremely popular for daguerreotypes,<ref>{{cite journal| last = Wheatstone| first = Charles| title = Contributions to the Physiology of Vision.\u2014Part the First.

This technology produced a type of [[three-dimensional space|three dimensional]] view that suited erotic images quite well. Although thousands of erotic daguerreotypes were created, only around 800 are known to survive; however, their uniqueness and expense meant that they were once the toys of rich men. Due to their rarity, the works can sell for more than \u00a3GB 10,000.<ref name = history />\n\n=== The calotype process ===\nIn 1841, [[William Fox Talbot]] patented the [[calotype]] process, the first negative-positive process, making possible multiple copies.<ref name=glasgow>{{cite web|last=Schaaf |first=Larry |title=The Calotype Process |publisher=Glasgow University Library |year=1999 |url=http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/hillandadamson/calo.html |accessdate=2006-08-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619221733/http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/hillandadamson/calo.html |archivedate=2006-06-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This invention permitted an almost limitless number of prints to be produced from a glass negative. The technology also reduced the exposure time and made possible a true mass market for low cost commercial photography. The technology was immediately employed to reproduce nude portraits, classified by the standards of the time as pornographic. Paris soon became the centre of this trade. In 1848 only thirteen photography studios existed in Paris; by 1860, there were over 400. Most of them made income from the sale of illicit nude images to the masses who could now afford it. The pictures were also sold near [[train station]]s, by traveling salesmen and women in the streets who hid them under their dresses. They were often produced in sets (of four, eight or twelve), and exported internationally, mainly to England and the United States. Both the models and the photographers were commonly from the working class, and the artistic model excuse was increasingly hard to use. By 1855, no more photographic nudes were being registered as acad\u00e9mie, and the business had gone underground to escape prosecution.<ref name = history />\n\n=== The Victorian tradition ===\n[[File:Female nude motion study by Eadweard Muybridge.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Eadweard Muybridge]]: Woman walking with fishing pole (detail)]]\n\nThe Victorian pornographic tradition in Britain had three main elements: French photographs, erotic prints (sold in shops in Holywell Street, a long vanished London thoroughfare, swept away by the [[Aldwych]]), and printed literature. The ability to reproduce photographs in bulk assisted the rise of a new business individual, the porn dealer. Many of these dealers used the [[postal system]] to distribute erotic photography, sending the photographic cards to subscribers in plain wrappings. Victorian pornography had several defining characteristics. It reflected a very mechanistic view of the [[human anatomy]] and its functions. Science, the new obsession, was invoked to ostensibly study the nude human body. Consequently, the sexuality of the subject is often depersonalised, and is without any passion or tenderness. At this time, it also became popular to depict nude photographs of women of exotic ethnicities, under the umbrella of science. \n\nStudies of this type can be found in the work of [[Eadweard Muybridge]]. Although he photographed both men and women, the women were often given [[theatrical property|props]] like market baskets and fishing poles, making the images of women thinly disguised erotica.<ref name = history /> \n\nParallel to the British printing history, photographers and printers in France frequently turned to the medium of [[postcard]]s, producing great numbers of them. Such cards came to be known in the US as \"[[French postcard]]s\".<ref>''The Color of Words: An Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Ethnic Bias in the United States'', Philip Herbst.

Picture postcards allowed and encouraged many individuals to send images across national borders, and the legal availability of a postcard image in one country did not guarantee that the card would be considered \"proper\" in the destination country, or in the intermediate countries that the card would have to pass through. Some countries refused to handle postcards containing sexual references (such as of seaside scenes) or images of full or partial nudity (including images of classical statuary or paintings). Many [[French postcard]]s featured naked women in erotic poses. These were described as postcards but whose primary purpose was not for sending by post because they would have been banned from delivery. Street dealers, tobacco shops, and a variety of other vendors bought the photographs for resale to tourists. The sale of erotica was banned, and many of these postcards were sold \"under the counter\".\n\nInstead, nude and erotic photographs were marketed in a monthly magazine called ''La Beaut\u00e9'' that was ostensibly targeted for artists looking for poses. Each issue contained 75 nude images which could be ordered by mail, in the form of postcards, hand-tinted or sepia toned.\n\n==Early 20th century==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Bellocq Storyville undamaged.jpg|Portrait by [[E.

The [[Ur-Leica]] was a compact camera based on the idea of reducing the format of negatives and enlarging them later, after they had been exposed. This small, portable device made nude photography in secluded parks and other semi-public places easier, and represented a great advance for amateur erotica. Artists were enamored with their new ability to take impromptu photos without carrying around a clunky apparatus.\n\nEarly 20th century artist [[E. J. Bellocq]], who made his best known images with the older style glass plate negatives, is best remembered for his down-to-earth pictures of prostitutes in domestic settings in the [[Storyville, New Orleans|Storyville]] red light district of [[New Orleans]]. In contrast to the usual pictures of women awkwardly posed amid drapery, veils, flowers, fruit, classical columns and oriental braziers, Bellocq's sitters appear relaxed and comfortable. David Steinberg speculates that the prostitutes may have felt at ease with Bellocq because he was \"so much of a fellow outcast.\"\n\nOther photographers of nude women of this period include [[Alexandre-Jacques Chantron]], [[Jean Ag\u00e9lou]]<ref>{{cite book\n|last = Bourdon\n|first = Christian \n|title = Jean Ag\u00e9lou: De l'acad\u00e9misme \u00e0 la photo de charme\n|language = french\n|year = 2006 \n|editor = Marval\n|publisher = Par\u00eds\n|isbn= 978-2862343945\n|pages=\n}}</ref> and [[Alfred Cheney Johnston]].

Bellocq, for instance, frequently scratched out the faces of his sitters to obscure their identities. Some of his other sitters were photographed wearing masks. Peter Marshall writes, \"Even in the relatively bohemian atmosphere of Carmel, California in the 1920s and '30s, [[Edward Weston]] had to photograph many of his models without showing their faces, and some 75 years on, many communities are less open about such things than Carmel was then.\"<ref name=\"about3\">{{cite web\n|url = http://photography.about.com/library/weekly/aa032403c.htm\n|title = Nude 101: A Beginners Guide to Nude Photography, Part 3: Finding Models\n|last = Marshall\n|first = Peter\n|work = About: Photography\n|publisher = The New York Times Company\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070604053329/http://photography.about.com/library/weekly/aa032403c.htm\n|archivedate = 2007-06-04\n|quote =\n}}</ref>\n\n==Later 20th century==\nNude photographers of the mid-20th century include Walter Bird, [[John Everard (photographer)|John Everard]], [[Horace Roye]], [[Harrison Marks]] and [[Zolt\u00e1n Glass]].

The image is now considered one of the major pre-war photographs of the 20th century.\n=== The Second World War ===\nDuring the [[Second World War]], [[pin-up girl]] photographs reached a wide audience. Unlike earlier erotic photographs, whose subjects were usually anonymous, a number of well-known [[film star]]s posed for pin-up photographs and they were promoted as sex symbols.

It is one of nine cities and seven counties that constitute the Hampton Roads metro area, officially known as the [[Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA]]. The city is bordered to the west by the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] and to the north by the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. It also shares land borders with the independent cities of [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]] to its south and Virginia Beach to its east. Norfolk is one of the oldest cities in Hampton Roads, and is considered to be the historic, urban, financial, and cultural center of the region.\n\nThe city has a long history as a strategic military and transportation point. The largest naval base in the world, [[Naval Station Norfolk]], is located in Norfolk along with one of [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO's]] two [[Allied Command Transformation|Strategic Command headquarters]]. The city also has the corporate headquarters of [[Norfolk Southern Railway]], one of North America's principal [[Class I railroad]]s, however the company is currently in the process of relocating their headquarters to [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]. Norfolk is also home to [[A. P. Moller-Maersk Group#Maersk Line, Limited|Maersk Line, Limited]], which manages the world's largest fleet of [[Flag State|US-flag vessels]]. As the city is bordered by multiple bodies of water, Norfolk has many miles of riverfront and bayfront property, including beaches on the Chesapeake Bay. It is linked to its neighbors by an extensive network of [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highways]], [[bridge]]s, [[tunnel]]s, and three [[bridge-tunnel]] complexes, which are the only bridge-tunnels in the United States.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Norfolk, Virginia|Timeline of Norfolk, Virginia}}\n\n===Colonial years===\nIn 1619 the Governor of the [[Virginia Colony]], [[George Yeardley|Sir George Yeardley]], incorporated four jurisdictions, termed ''citties,'' for the developed portion of the colony. These formed the basis for colonial representative government in the newly minted [[House of Burgesses]]. What would become Norfolk was put under the [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] incorporation.\n\nIn 1634 [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] reorganized the colony into a system of [[shires of Virginia|shires]]. The former [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] became [[Elizabeth City Shire]]. After persuading 105 people to settle in the colony, [[Adam Thoroughgood]] (who had immigrated to Virginia in 1622 from [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]], [[England]]) was granted a large land holding, through the head rights system, along the [[Lynnhaven River]] in 1636.\n\nWhen the [[South Hampton Roads]] portion of the shire was separated, Thoroughgood suggested the name of his birthplace for the newly formed [[New Norfolk County, Virginia|New Norfolk County]]. One year later, it was divided into two counties, [[Upper Norfolk County|Upper Norfolk]] and [[Lower Norfolk County, Virginia|Lower Norfolk]] (the latter now incorporated into the City of Norfolk), chiefly on Thoroughgood's recommendation.<ref name=\"Norfolk History Chapter 4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/04.html |title=The Origins of Norfolk's Name |accessdate=October 9, 2007 |publisher=Norfolk Historical Society |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910230143/http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/04.html |archivedate=September 10, 2007 }}</ref> This area of Virginia became known as the place of entrepreneurs, including men of the [[London Company|Virginia Company of London]].\n\nNorfolk developed in the late-seventeenth century as a \"Half Moone\" fort was constructed and {{convert|50|acre|m2}} were acquired from local natives of the [[Powhatan Confederacy]] in exchange for 10,000 pounds of tobacco.

In 1730, a tobacco inspection site was located here. According to the [[Tobacco Inspection Act]], the inspection was ''\"At Norfolk Town, upon the fort land, in the County of Norfolk; and [[Kempsville, Virginia|Kemp's Landing]], in Princess Anne, under one inspection.\"'' In 1736 [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] granted it a royal charter as a borough.<ref name=\"Norfolk History Chapter 9\">{{cite web| url = http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/09.html| title = Norfolk Becomes a Borough| accessdate = October 9, 2007| publisher = Norfolk Historical Society}}</ref> By 1775, Norfolk developed into what contemporary observers argued was the most prosperous city in Virginia. It was an important port for exporting goods to the British Isles and beyond. In part because of its merchants' numerous trading ties with other parts of the British Empire, Norfolk served as a strong base of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] support during the early part of the [[American Revolution]]. After fleeing the colonial capital of [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], the Royal Governor of Virginia, [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore]], tried to reestablish control of the colony from Norfolk. Dunmore secured small victories at Norfolk but was soon driven into exile by the Virginia militia, commanded by [[William Woodford|Colonel Woodford]]. His departure brought an end to more than 168 years of British colonial rule in Virginia.<ref name=\"History from Colonial Williamsburg\">{{cite web| url = http://www.history.org/Almanack/resources/dateline/polcron.cfm#seeds| title = Cultural & Political Chronology (1750\u20131783)| accessdate = September 30, 2007| publisher = Colonial Williamsburg}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cannonball lodged in church wall.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A shot fired by [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]]'s troops during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] at [[Saint Paul's Episcopal Church (Norfolk, Virginia)|St. Paul's Episcopal Church]] ]]\n\nOn New Year's Day, 1776, Lord Dunmore's fleet of three ships shelled the city of Norfolk for more than eight hours.

In 1804, another serious fire along the city's waterfront destroyed some 300 buildings and the city suffered a serious economic setback. During the 1820s, agrarian communities across the [[Southern United States|American South]] suffered a prolonged recession, which caused many families to migrate to other areas. Many moved west into the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]], or further into [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]].  Such migration also followed the exhaustion of soil due to [[tobacco]] cultivation in the Tidewater, where it had been the primary commodity crop for generations.\n\nVirginia made some attempts to phase out [[slavery]] and [[manumission]]s increased in the two decades following the war. [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]] gained passage of an 1832 resolution for gradual abolition in the state. However, by that time the increased demand from the settlement of the lower South states had created a large internal market for slavery. The invention of the [[cotton gin]] in the late-eighteenth century had made profitable the cultivation of short-staple cotton in the uplands, which was widely practiced.\n\n[[File:Joseph Jenkins Roberts.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]], born and raised in Norfolk, became the first [[President of Liberia]].]]\n\nThe [[American Colonization Society]] proposed to \"[[Back-to-Africa movement|repatriate]]\" free blacks and freed slaves to Africa by establishing the new colony of Liberia and paying for transportation. But most African-Americans wanted to stay in their birthplace of the United States and achieve freedom and rights there. For a period, many emigrants to Liberia from Virginia and [[North Carolina]] embarked from the port of Norfolk.

She had just sailed from the [[West Indies]], where there had been an outbreak of [[yellow fever]]. The port health officer ordered the ship quarantined. After eleven days, a second inspection found no issues, so she was allowed to dock. A few days later, the first cases of yellow fever were discovered in Norfolk, and a machinist died from the disease on July 8. By August, several people were dying per day, and a third of the city's population had fled in the hopes of escaping the epidemic. No one understood how the disease was transmitted. With both Norfolk and Portsmouth being infected, New York banned all traffic from those sites. Neighboring cities also banned residents from Norfolk. The epidemic spread through the city via mosquitoes and poor sanitation, affecting every family and causing widespread panic. The number of infected reached 5,000 in September, and by the second week, 1,500 had died in Norfolk and Portsmouth.<ref>Donna, Bluemink YELLOW FEVER IN NORFOLK AND PORTSMOUTH, VIRGINIA, 1855,as reported in the DAILY DISPATCH of Richmond, Virginia 2005 accessed 29 September 2019.\nhttp://www.usgwarchives.net/va/yellow-fever/yftoc.html\n</ref> As the weather cooled, the outbreak began to wane, leaving a final tally of about 3,200 dead.<!--out of what population?--><ref>{{citation | first = Lon | last = Wagner | title = The Fever, a Story in 14 Parts | work = The Virginian-Pilot | date = July 10\u201323, 2005 | url = http://www.portsmouthva.gov/history/fever/thefever.pdf | accessdate = May 18, 2013 | postscript = . | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131215040256/http://www.portsmouthva.gov/history/fever/thefever.pdf | archive-date = December 15, 2013 | url-status = dead }}</ref> It took the city some time to recover.\n\nIn early 1861, Norfolk voters instructed their delegate to vote for secession. Virginia voted to secede from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. In the spring of 1862, the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] took place off the northwest shore of the city's [[Sewell's Point|Sewell's Point Peninsula]], marking the first fight between two [[ironclad warship|ironclads]], the [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']] and the [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']].

The [[Virginia General Assembly]] prohibited state funding for integrated public schools.\n\nIn 1958, [[United States district court]]s in Virginia ordered schools to open for the first time on a racially integrated basis. In response, [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] [[James Lindsay Almond, Jr.]] ordered the schools closed. The [[Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals]] declared the [[State law (United States)|state law]] to be in conflict with the [[Constitution of Virginia|state constitution]] and ordered all public schools to be funded, whether integrated or not.

In the late-1960s and early-1970s, the advent of newer suburban shopping destinations along with freeways spelled demise for the fortunes of downtown's [[Granby Street]] commercial corridor, located just a few blocks inland from the waterfront.

While Granby Street underwent decline, Norfolk city leaders focused on the waterfront and its collection of decaying piers and warehouses. Many obsolete shipping and warehousing facilities were demolished. In their place, planners created a new boulevard, Waterside Drive, along which many of the high-rise buildings in Norfolk's [[skyline]] have been erected. In 1983, the city and [[The Rouse Company]] developed the [[Waterside (Norfolk, Virginia)|Waterside]] festival marketplace to attract people back to the waterfront and catalyze further downtown redevelopment.<ref name=\"Waterside\">{{cite web| url = http://www.watersidemarketplace.com/| title = Waterside Marketplace| accessdate = February 21, 2008| publisher = Waterside}}</ref> Waterside was redeveloped in 2017.

The Hampton Roads [[United States metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (officially known as the [[Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA]]) is the [[Table of United States Metropolitan Statistical Areas|37th largest]] in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,716,624 in 2014. The area includes the Virginia cities of Norfolk, [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]], [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]], [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], [[Poquoson, Virginia|Poquoson]], [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]], [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], and the counties of [[Gloucester County, Virginia|Gloucester]], [[Isle of Wight County, Virginia|Isle of Wight]], [[James City County, Virginia|James City]], [[Mathews County, Virginia|Mathews]], and [[York County, Virginia|York]], as well as the [[North Carolina]] counties of [[Currituck County, North Carolina|Currituck]] and [[Gates County, North Carolina|Gates]]. The city of Norfolk is recognized as the central business district, while the Virginia Beach oceanside resort district and [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] are primarily centers of tourism. Virginia Beach is the most populated city within the MSA though it functions more as a suburb.  Additionally, Norfolk is part of the Virginia Beach-Norfolk, VA-NC [[Combined Statistical Area]], which includes the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA, the [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina Micropolitan Statistical Area]], and the [[Kill Devil Hills, NC]] Micropolitan Statistical Area.  The CSA is the 32nd largest in the nation with an estimated population in 2013 of 1,810,266.\n\nIn addition to extensive riverfront property, Norfolk has miles of bayfront resort property and beaches in the [[Willoughby Spit]] and [[Ocean View, Virginia|Ocean View]] communities.\n\nBeing low-lying and largely surrounded by water, Norfolk is particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels. In addition, the land on which it is built is slowly subsiding. Some areas already flood regularly at high tide, and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to investigate how to address the issue in the future: it reported the cost of dealing with a sea-level rise of one foot would be around $1,000,000,000. Since then, scientists at the [[Virginia Institute of Marine Science]] in 2013 have estimated that if current trends hold, the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 and 1/2 feet or more by the end of this century.<ref>{{cite news|last=Montgomery |first=Lori |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/in-norfolk-evidence-of-climate-change-is-in-the-streets-at-high-tide/2014/05/31/fe3ae860-e71f-11e3-8f90-73e071f3d637_story.html |title=In Norfolk, evidence of climate change is in the streets at high tide |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2014-05-31 |accessdate=2016-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Jarvis |first=Brooke |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/magazine/when-rising-seas-transform-risk-into-certainty.html |title=When Rising Seas Transform Risk Into Certainty\n |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2017-04-18 |accessdate=2018-08-01}}</ref>\n\n===Cityscape===\n{{see also|List of tallest buildings in Norfolk, Virginia}}\n[[File:Skyline of Downtown Norfolk Looking Towards Portsmouth.jpg|thumb|Skyline of Downtown Norfolk Looking Towards Elizabeth River.]]\n\nWhen Norfolk was first settled, homes were made of wood and [[Framing (construction)|frame]] construction, similar to most medieval English-style homes. These homes had wide [[chimney]]s and [[Thatching|thatch roofs]]. Some decades after the town was first laid out in 1682, the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian architectural style]], which was popular in the [[Southern United States|South]] at the time, was used. [[Brick]] was considered more substantial construction; patterns were made by brick laid and Flemish bond. This style evolved to include projecting center pavilions, [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] windows, [[Baluster|balustraded]] roof decks, and two-story [[portico]]es. By 1740, homes, warehouses, stores, workshops, and taverns began to dot Norfolk's streets.\n\n[[File:Ghent neighborhood house, Norfolk, VA.jpg|thumb|left|A home in the Ghent neighborhood]]\n\nNorfolk was burned down during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. After the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], Norfolk was rebuilt in the [[Federal architecture|Federal]] style, based on Roman ideals. Federal-style homes kept Georgian symmetry, though they had more refined decorations to look like [[New World]] homes. Federal homes had features such as narrow sidelights with an embracing [[fanlight]] around the doorway, giant porticoes, gable or flat roofs, and projecting bays on exterior walls. Rooms were oval, elliptical or octagonal. Few of these federal [[rowhouse]]s remain standing today. A majority of buildings were made of wood and had a simple construction.\n\n[[File:Whittle House Norfolk.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Taylor-Whittle House]] (c. 1790), now occupied by the Junior League of Norfolk-Virginia Beach and the Norfolk Historical Society<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jlnvb.org/?nd=house |title=Junior League of Norfolk-Virginia Beach |publisher=Jlnvb.org |date= |accessdate=May 14, 2012}}</ref>]]\n\nIn the early nineteenth century, [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] architectural elements began to appear in the federal style row homes, such as [[Ionic order|ionic]] [[Classical order|columns]] in the porticoes and classic motifs over doorways and windows. Many [[Federal architecture|Federal-style]] row houses were modernized by placing a Greek-style porch at the front. Greek and Roman elements were integrated into public buildings such as the old City Hall, the old Norfolk Academy, and the Customs House.\n\nGreek-style homes gave way to [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] in the 1830s, which emphasized [[pointed arch]]es, steep [[gable]] roofs, towers and tracer-lead windows. The Freemason Baptist Church and St. Mary's Catholic Church are examples of Gothic Revival. [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] elements emerged in the 1840s including [[cupola]]s, [[veranda]]s, ornamental [[brickwork]], or [[Quoin (architecture)|corner quoins]]. Norfolk still had simple wooden structures among its more ornate buildings.\n\n[[File:Norfolk, Virginia skyline 2016.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Norfolk, Virginia skyline from across the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] in 2016]]\n\n[[High-rise]] buildings were first built in the late nineteenth century when structures such as the current Commodore Maury Hotel and the Royster Building were constructed to form the initial Norfolk skyline. Past styles were revived during the early years of the twentieth century. [[Bungalow]]s and apartment buildings became popular for those living in the city.\n\nAs the [[Great Depression]] wore on, [[Art Deco]] emerged as a popular building style, as evidenced by the Post Office building downtown. Art Deco consisted of streamlined [[concrete]] faced appearance with smooth [[rock (geology)|stone]] or metal, with [[terracotta]], and trimming consisting of [[glass]] and colored [[tile]]s.\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n{{See also|List of neighborhoods in Norfolk}}\nNorfolk has a variety of historic neighborhoods. Some neighborhoods, such as [[Berkley, Virginia|Berkley]], were formerly cities and towns.  Others, such as [[Willoughby Spit]] and [[Ocean View, Virginia|Ocean View]], have a long \u201chistory tied to the [[Chesapeake Bay]].  Today, neighborhoods such as [[Downtown Norfolk, Virginia|Downtown]], [[Ghent district|Ghent]] and [[Fairmount Park Neighborhood|Fairmount Park]] have transformed with the revitalization that the city has undergone.\n\n===Climate===\nNorfolk has a [[humid subtropical climate]] and its USDA Hardiness Zone is 8a. Spring arrives in March with mild days and cool nights, and by late May, the temperature has warmed up considerably to herald warm summer days. Summers are consistently warm and humid, but the nearby Atlantic Ocean often exercises a slight cooling effect on daytime high temperatures, but a slight warming effect on nighttime low temperatures (compared to areas farther inland).  As such, Norfolk has occasional days over 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32&nbsp;\u00b0C).  Temperatures over 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C) are rare but can occur on occasion. On average, July is the warmest month, while August is the wettest month, due to still-frequent summer thunderstorm activity combined with a rising frequency (in August) of tropical activity (hurricanes and tropical storms), which can bring high winds and heavy rains. These usually brush Norfolk and only occasionally make landfalls in the area; the highest-risk period is mid-August to the end of September. [[Autumn|Fall]] is marked by mild to warm days and cooler nights. Winter is usually mild in Norfolk, with average winter days featuring lows near or slightly above freezing and highs in the upper-40s to mid-50s (8 to 13&nbsp;\u00b0C). On average, the coldest month of the year is January. Norfolk's record high was {{convert|105|\u00b0F|0}} on August 7, 1918, and July 24 and 25, 2010, and the record low was {{convert|\u22123|\u00b0F|0}} recorded on [[January 1985 Arctic outbreak|January 21, 1985]].<ref name=\"TWC\">Seasonal Temperature and Precipitation Information from [http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USVA0557?from=36hr_bottomnav_undeclared The Weather Channel].\" Retrieved on July 11, 2007.</ref> Snow occurs sporadically, with an average annual accumulation of 5.8 inches.<ref>\"[http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/akq/climate/ORF_Climate_Records.pdf Quick Data View Norfolk]\".

It is one of nine cities and seven counties that constitute the Hampton Roads metro area, officially known as the [[Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA]]. The city is bordered to the west by the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] and to the north by the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. It also shares land borders with the independent cities of [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]] to its south and Virginia Beach to its east. Norfolk is one of the oldest cities in Hampton Roads, and is considered to be the historic, urban, financial, and cultural center of the region.\n\nThe city has a long history as a strategic military and transportation point. The largest naval base in the world, [[Naval Station Norfolk]], is located in Norfolk along with one of [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO's]] two [[Allied Command Transformation|Strategic Command headquarters]]. The city also has the corporate headquarters of [[Norfolk Southern Railway]], one of North America's principal [[Class I railroad]]s, however the company is currently in the process of relocating their headquarters to [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]. Norfolk is also home to [[A. P. Moller-Maersk Group#Maersk Line, Limited|Maersk Line, Limited]], which manages the world's largest fleet of [[Flag State|US-flag vessels]]. As the city is bordered by multiple bodies of water, Norfolk has many miles of riverfront and bayfront property, including beaches on the Chesapeake Bay. It is linked to its neighbors by an extensive network of [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highways]], [[bridge]]s, [[tunnel]]s, and three [[bridge-tunnel]] complexes, which are the only bridge-tunnels in the United States.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Norfolk, Virginia|Timeline of Norfolk, Virginia}}\n\n===Colonial years===\nIn 1619 the Governor of the [[Virginia Colony]], [[George Yeardley|Sir George Yeardley]], incorporated four jurisdictions, termed ''citties,'' for the developed portion of the colony. These formed the basis for colonial representative government in the newly minted [[House of Burgesses]]. What would become Norfolk was put under the [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] incorporation.\n\nIn 1634 [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] reorganized the colony into a system of [[shires of Virginia|shires]]. The former [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] became [[Elizabeth City Shire]]. After persuading 105 people to settle in the colony, [[Adam Thoroughgood]] (who had immigrated to Virginia in 1622 from [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]], [[England]]) was granted a large land holding, through the head rights system, along the [[Lynnhaven River]] in 1636.\n\nWhen the [[South Hampton Roads]] portion of the shire was separated, Thoroughgood suggested the name of his birthplace for the newly formed [[New Norfolk County, Virginia|New Norfolk County]]. One year later, it was divided into two counties, [[Upper Norfolk County|Upper Norfolk]] and [[Lower Norfolk County, Virginia|Lower Norfolk]] (the latter now incorporated into the City of Norfolk), chiefly on Thoroughgood's recommendation.<ref name=\"Norfolk History Chapter 4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/04.html |title=The Origins of Norfolk's Name |accessdate=October 9, 2007 |publisher=Norfolk Historical Society |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910230143/http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/04.html |archivedate=September 10, 2007 }}</ref> This area of Virginia became known as the place of entrepreneurs, including men of the [[London Company|Virginia Company of London]].\n\nNorfolk developed in the late-seventeenth century as a \"Half Moone\" fort was constructed and {{convert|50|acre|m2}} were acquired from local natives of the [[Powhatan Confederacy]] in exchange for 10,000 pounds of tobacco.

In 1730, a tobacco inspection site was located here. According to the [[Tobacco Inspection Act]], the inspection was ''\"At Norfolk Town, upon the fort land, in the County of Norfolk; and [[Kempsville, Virginia|Kemp's Landing]], in Princess Anne, under one inspection.\"'' In 1736 [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] granted it a royal charter as a borough.<ref name=\"Norfolk History Chapter 9\">{{cite web| url = http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/09.html| title = Norfolk Becomes a Borough| accessdate = October 9, 2007| publisher = Norfolk Historical Society}}</ref> By 1775, Norfolk developed into what contemporary observers argued was the most prosperous city in Virginia. It was an important port for exporting goods to the British Isles and beyond. In part because of its merchants' numerous trading ties with other parts of the British Empire, Norfolk served as a strong base of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] support during the early part of the [[American Revolution]]. After fleeing the colonial capital of [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], the Royal Governor of Virginia, [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore]], tried to reestablish control of the colony from Norfolk. Dunmore secured small victories at Norfolk but was soon driven into exile by the Virginia militia, commanded by [[William Woodford|Colonel Woodford]]. His departure brought an end to more than 168 years of British colonial rule in Virginia.<ref name=\"History from Colonial Williamsburg\">{{cite web| url = http://www.history.org/Almanack/resources/dateline/polcron.cfm#seeds| title = Cultural & Political Chronology (1750\u20131783)| accessdate = September 30, 2007| publisher = Colonial Williamsburg}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cannonball lodged in church wall.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A shot fired by [[John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]]'s troops during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] at [[Saint Paul's Episcopal Church (Norfolk, Virginia)|St. Paul's Episcopal Church]] ]]\n\nOn New Year's Day, 1776, Lord Dunmore's fleet of three ships shelled the city of Norfolk for more than eight hours.

In 1804, another serious fire along the city's waterfront destroyed some 300 buildings and the city suffered a serious economic setback. During the 1820s, agrarian communities across the [[Southern United States|American South]] suffered a prolonged recession, which caused many families to migrate to other areas. Many moved west into the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]], or further into [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]].  Such migration also followed the exhaustion of soil due to [[tobacco]] cultivation in the Tidewater, where it had been the primary commodity crop for generations.\n\nVirginia made some attempts to phase out [[slavery]] and [[manumission]]s increased in the two decades following the war. [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]] gained passage of an 1832 resolution for gradual abolition in the state. However, by that time the increased demand from the settlement of the lower South states had created a large internal market for slavery. The invention of the [[cotton gin]] in the late-eighteenth century had made profitable the cultivation of short-staple cotton in the uplands, which was widely practiced.\n\n[[File:Joseph Jenkins Roberts.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]], born and raised in Norfolk, became the first [[President of Liberia]].]]\n\nThe [[American Colonization Society]] proposed to \"[[Back-to-Africa movement|repatriate]]\" free blacks and freed slaves to Africa by establishing the new colony of Liberia and paying for transportation. But most African-Americans wanted to stay in their birthplace of the United States and achieve freedom and rights there. For a period, many emigrants to Liberia from Virginia and [[North Carolina]] embarked from the port of Norfolk.  [[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]], a [[free person of color]] native to Norfolk, emigrated via the American Colonization Society and later was elected as the first president of [[Liberia]], establishing a powerful family.<ref name=\"Roberts\">{{cite web| url = http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/754/Joseph_Roberts_Liberias_first_President| title =  Joseph Roberts, Liberia's first President!| accessdate = February 19, 2008| publisher = The African-American Registry |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071123023225/http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/754/Joseph_Roberts_Liberias_first_President <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = November 23, 2007}}</ref>\n\nOn June 7, 1855, the 183-foot vessel ''Benjamin Franklin'' put into Hampton Roads for repairs. She had just sailed from the [[West Indies]], where there had been an outbreak of [[yellow fever]]. The port health officer ordered the ship quarantined. After eleven days, a second inspection found no issues, so she was allowed to dock. A few days later, the first cases of yellow fever were discovered in Norfolk, and a machinist died from the disease on July 8. By August, several people were dying per day, and a third of the city's population had fled in the hopes of escaping the epidemic. No one understood how the disease was transmitted. With both Norfolk and Portsmouth being infected, New York banned all traffic from those sites. Neighboring cities also banned residents from Norfolk.

A series of bridges and tunnels, constructed during fifteen years, linked Norfolk with [[Virginia Peninsula|the Peninsula]], [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], and [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]]. In 1952, the [[Downtown Tunnel]] opened to connect Norfolk with the city of Portsmouth. The highways also stimulated the development of new housing suburbs, leading to the population spreading out.

Board of Education]]'' that [[Racial segregation|segregated]] public schools were [[unconstitutional]], as the public system was supported by all taxpayers. It ordered [[racial integration|integration]], but Virginia pursued a policy of \"[[massive resistance]]\". (At this time, most black citizens were still [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] under the state's turn-of-the-century constitution and discriminatory practices related to voter registration and elections.) The [[Virginia General Assembly]] prohibited state funding for integrated public schools.\n\nIn 1958, [[United States district court]]s in Virginia ordered schools to open for the first time on a racially integrated basis. In response, [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] [[James Lindsay Almond, Jr.]] ordered the schools closed. The [[Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals]] declared the [[State law (United States)|state law]] to be in conflict with the [[Constitution of Virginia|state constitution]] and ordered all public schools to be funded, whether integrated or not.

In the late-1960s and early-1970s, the advent of newer suburban shopping destinations along with freeways spelled demise for the fortunes of downtown's [[Granby Street]] commercial corridor, located just a few blocks inland from the waterfront.

While Granby Street underwent decline, Norfolk city leaders focused on the waterfront and its collection of decaying piers and warehouses. Many obsolete shipping and warehousing facilities were demolished. In their place, planners created a new boulevard, Waterside Drive, along which many of the high-rise buildings in Norfolk's [[skyline]] have been erected. In 1983, the city and [[The Rouse Company]] developed the [[Waterside (Norfolk, Virginia)|Waterside]] festival marketplace to attract people back to the waterfront and catalyze further downtown redevelopment.<ref name=\"Waterside\">{{cite web| url = http://www.watersidemarketplace.com/| title = Waterside Marketplace| accessdate = February 21, 2008| publisher = Waterside}}</ref> Waterside was redeveloped in 2017.

The Hampton Roads [[United States metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (officially known as the [[Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA]]) is the [[Table of United States Metropolitan Statistical Areas|37th largest]] in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,716,624 in 2014. The area includes the Virginia cities of Norfolk, [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]], [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]], [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], [[Poquoson, Virginia|Poquoson]], [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]], [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], and the counties of [[Gloucester County, Virginia|Gloucester]], [[Isle of Wight County, Virginia|Isle of Wight]], [[James City County, Virginia|James City]], [[Mathews County, Virginia|Mathews]], and [[York County, Virginia|York]], as well as the [[North Carolina]] counties of [[Currituck County, North Carolina|Currituck]] and [[Gates County, North Carolina|Gates]]. The city of Norfolk is recognized as the central business district, while the Virginia Beach oceanside resort district and [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] are primarily centers of tourism. Virginia Beach is the most populated city within the MSA though it functions more as a suburb.  Additionally, Norfolk is part of the Virginia Beach-Norfolk, VA-NC [[Combined Statistical Area]], which includes the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA, the [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina Micropolitan Statistical Area]], and the [[Kill Devil Hills, NC]] Micropolitan Statistical Area.  The CSA is the 32nd largest in the nation with an estimated population in 2013 of 1,810,266.\n\nIn addition to extensive riverfront property, Norfolk has miles of bayfront resort property and beaches in the [[Willoughby Spit]] and [[Ocean View, Virginia|Ocean View]] communities.\n\nBeing low-lying and largely surrounded by water, Norfolk is particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels. In addition, the land on which it is built is slowly subsiding. Some areas already flood regularly at high tide, and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to investigate how to address the issue in the future: it reported the cost of dealing with a sea-level rise of one foot would be around $1,000,000,000. Since then, scientists at the [[Virginia Institute of Marine Science]] in 2013 have estimated that if current trends hold, the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 and 1/2 feet or more by the end of this century.<ref>{{cite news|last=Montgomery |first=Lori |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/in-norfolk-evidence-of-climate-change-is-in-the-streets-at-high-tide/2014/05/31/fe3ae860-e71f-11e3-8f90-73e071f3d637_story.html |title=In Norfolk, evidence of climate change is in the streets at high tide |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2014-05-31 |accessdate=2016-06-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Jarvis |first=Brooke |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/magazine/when-rising-seas-transform-risk-into-certainty.html |title=When Rising Seas Transform Risk Into Certainty\n |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2017-04-18 |accessdate=2018-08-01}}</ref>\n\n===Cityscape===\n{{see also|List of tallest buildings in Norfolk, Virginia}}\n[[File:Skyline of Downtown Norfolk Looking Towards Portsmouth.jpg|thumb|Skyline of Downtown Norfolk Looking Towards Elizabeth River.]]\n\nWhen Norfolk was first settled, homes were made of wood and [[Framing (construction)|frame]] construction, similar to most medieval English-style homes. These homes had wide [[chimney]]s and [[Thatching|thatch roofs]]. Some decades after the town was first laid out in 1682, the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian architectural style]], which was popular in the [[Southern United States|South]] at the time, was used. [[Brick]] was considered more substantial construction; patterns were made by brick laid and Flemish bond. This style evolved to include projecting center pavilions, [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] windows, [[Baluster|balustraded]] roof decks, and two-story [[portico]]es. By 1740, homes, warehouses, stores, workshops, and taverns began to dot Norfolk's streets.\n\n[[File:Ghent neighborhood house, Norfolk, VA.jpg|thumb|left|A home in the Ghent neighborhood]]\n\nNorfolk was burned down during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. After the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], Norfolk was rebuilt in the [[Federal architecture|Federal]] style, based on Roman ideals. Federal-style homes kept Georgian symmetry, though they had more refined decorations to look like [[New World]] homes. Federal homes had features such as narrow sidelights with an embracing [[fanlight]] around the doorway, giant porticoes, gable or flat roofs, and projecting bays on exterior walls. Rooms were oval, elliptical or octagonal. Few of these federal [[rowhouse]]s remain standing today. A majority of buildings were made of wood and had a simple construction.\n\n[[File:Whittle House Norfolk.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Taylor-Whittle House]] (c. 1790), now occupied by the Junior League of Norfolk-Virginia Beach and the Norfolk Historical Society<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jlnvb.org/?nd=house |title=Junior League of Norfolk-Virginia Beach |publisher=Jlnvb.org |date= |accessdate=May 14, 2012}}</ref>]]\n\nIn the early nineteenth century, [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] architectural elements began to appear in the federal style row homes, such as [[Ionic order|ionic]] [[Classical order|columns]] in the porticoes and classic motifs over doorways and windows. Many [[Federal architecture|Federal-style]] row houses were modernized by placing a Greek-style porch at the front. Greek and Roman elements were integrated into public buildings such as the old City Hall, the old Norfolk Academy, and the Customs House.\n\nGreek-style homes gave way to [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] in the 1830s, which emphasized [[pointed arch]]es, steep [[gable]] roofs, towers and tracer-lead windows. The Freemason Baptist Church and St. Mary's Catholic Church are examples of Gothic Revival. [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] elements emerged in the 1840s including [[cupola]]s, [[veranda]]s, ornamental [[brickwork]], or [[Quoin (architecture)|corner quoins]]. Norfolk still had simple wooden structures among its more ornate buildings.\n\n[[File:Norfolk, Virginia skyline 2016.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Norfolk, Virginia skyline from across the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] in 2016]]\n\n[[High-rise]] buildings were first built in the late nineteenth century when structures such as the current Commodore Maury Hotel and the Royster Building were constructed to form the initial Norfolk skyline. Past styles were revived during the early years of the twentieth century. [[Bungalow]]s and apartment buildings became popular for those living in the city.\n\nAs the [[Great Depression]] wore on, [[Art Deco]] emerged as a popular building style, as evidenced by the Post Office building downtown. Art Deco consisted of streamlined [[concrete]] faced appearance with smooth [[rock (geology)|stone]] or metal, with [[terracotta]], and trimming consisting of [[glass]] and colored [[tile]]s.\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n{{See also|List of neighborhoods in Norfolk}}\nNorfolk has a variety of historic neighborhoods. Some neighborhoods, such as [[Berkley, Virginia|Berkley]], were formerly cities and towns.  Others, such as [[Willoughby Spit]] and [[Ocean View, Virginia|Ocean View]], have a long \u201chistory tied to the [[Chesapeake Bay]].  Today, neighborhoods such as [[Downtown Norfolk, Virginia|Downtown]], [[Ghent district|Ghent]] and [[Fairmount Park Neighborhood|Fairmount Park]] have transformed with the revitalization that the city has undergone.\n\n===Climate===\nNorfolk has a [[humid subtropical climate]] and its USDA Hardiness Zone is 8a. Spring arrives in March with mild days and cool nights, and by late May, the temperature has warmed up considerably to herald warm summer days. Summers are consistently warm and humid, but the nearby Atlantic Ocean often exercises a slight cooling effect on daytime high temperatures, but a slight warming effect on nighttime low temperatures (compared to areas farther inland).  As such, Norfolk has occasional days over 90&nbsp;\u00b0F (32&nbsp;\u00b0C).  Temperatures over 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C) are rare but can occur on occasion. On average, July is the warmest month, while August is the wettest month, due to still-frequent summer thunderstorm activity combined with a rising frequency (in August) of tropical activity (hurricanes and tropical storms), which can bring high winds and heavy rains. These usually brush Norfolk and only occasionally make landfalls in the area; the highest-risk period is mid-August to the end of September. [[Autumn|Fall]] is marked by mild to warm days and cooler nights. Winter is usually mild in Norfolk, with average winter days featuring lows near or slightly above freezing and highs in the upper-40s to mid-50s (8 to 13&nbsp;\u00b0C). On average, the coldest month of the year is January. Norfolk's record high was {{convert|105|\u00b0F|0}} on August 7, 1918, and July 24 and 25, 2010, and the record low was {{convert|\u22123|\u00b0F|0}} recorded on [[January 1985 Arctic outbreak|January 21, 1985]].<ref name=\"TWC\">Seasonal Temperature and Precipitation Information from [http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USVA0557?from=36hr_bottomnav_undeclared The Weather Channel].\" Retrieved on July 11, 2007.</ref> Snow occurs sporadically, with an average annual accumulation of 5.8 inches.<ref>\"[http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/akq/climate/ORF_Climate_Records.pdf Quick Data View Norfolk]\".

As a strategic location at the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]], its protected deep-water channels serve as a major trade artery for the [[import]] and [[export]] of goods from across the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]], [[Midwestern United States|Mid-West]], and internationally.<ref name=\"Global Security\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/norfolk.htm\n| title = Norfolk Naval Base\n| accessdate = February 21, 2008\n| publisher = Globalsecurity.org\n}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to commercial activities, Hampton Roads is a major military center, particularly for the [[United States Navy]], and Norfolk serves as the home for [[Naval Station Norfolk]], the world's largest naval installation. Located on [[Sewell's Point|Sewell's Point Peninsula]], in the northwest corner of the city, the station is the headquarters of the [[United States Fleet Forces Command]] (formerly known as the Atlantic Fleet), which compromises over 62,000 active duty personnel, 75 ships, and 132 aircraft.

Major private shipyards located in Norfolk or the [[Hampton Roads]] area include: [[Huntington Ingalls Industries]] (formerly Northrop Grumman Newport News) in Newport News, [[BAE Systems Ship Repair|BAE Systems Norfolk Ship Repair]], [[General Dynamics]] [[National Steel and Shipbuilding Company|NASSCO]] Norfolk, and Colonna's Shipyard Inc., while the US Navy's [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] is just across the [[Downtown Tunnel]] in [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]]. Most contracts fulfilled by these shipyards are issued by the Navy, though some private commercial repair also takes place. Over 35% of Gross Regional Product (which includes the entire Norfolk-Newport News-Virginia Beach MSA), is attributable to defense spending, and that 75% of all regional growth since 2001 is attributable to increases in defense spending.<ref name=\"Hampton Roads Statistics\">{{cite web| url = http://bpa.odu.edu/forecasting/sor/sor2004.shtml| title = State of the Region 2004| accessdate = February 21, 2008| publisher = Old Dominion University| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080120224242/http://bpa.odu.edu/forecasting/sor/sor2004.shtml| archive-date = January 20, 2008| url-status = dead}}</ref>\n[[File:Norfolk, VA.jpg|thumb|A view of Norfolk from Portsmouth|left]]\nAfter the military, the second largest and most important industry for Hampton Roads and Norfolk based on economic impact are the region's cargo ports.

In the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], it was commonly described as an extremely wild [[forest|woodland]] creature, a symbol of purity and grace, which could be captured only by a virgin.

As soon as the unicorn sees her, it lays its head on her lap and falls asleep. This became a basic emblematic tag that underlies medieval notions of the unicorn, justifying its appearance in every form of [[Sacred art|religious art.]] Interpretations of the unicorn myth focus on the medieval lore of beguiled lovers,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} whereas some religious writers interpret the unicorn and its death as the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]]. The myths refer to a beast with one horn that can only be tamed by a [[Virginity|virgin]]; subsequently, some writers translated this into an allegory for Christ's relationship with the Virgin Mary.\n\nThe unicorn also figured in [[courtly love|courtly terms]]: for some 13th-century [[France|French]] authors such as [[Theobald I of Navarre|Thibaut of Champagne]] and [[Richard de Fournival]], the lover is attracted to his lady as the unicorn is to the virgin.

The tapestries now hang in [[the Cloisters]] division of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]]. In the series, richly dressed [[Nobility|noblemen]], accompanied by huntsmen and hounds, pursue a unicorn against ''[[mille-fleur]]'' backgrounds or settings of buildings and gardens. They bring the animal to bay with the help of a maiden who traps it with her charms, appear to kill it, and bring it back to a castle; in the last and most famous panel, \"The Unicorn in Captivity\", the unicorn is shown alive again and happy, chained to a [[pomegranate]] tree surrounded by a fence, in a field of flowers. Scholars conjecture that the red stains on its flanks are not blood but rather the juice from pomegranates, which were a symbol of fertility. However, the true meaning of the mysterious resurrected unicorn in the last panel is unclear. The series was woven about 1500 in the [[Low Countries]], probably [[Brussels]] or [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]], for an unknown patron. A set of six [[engraving]]s on the same theme, treated rather differently, were engraved by the French artist [[Jean Duvet]] in the 1540s.\n\nAnother famous set of six tapestries of ''[[The Lady and the Unicorn|Dame \u00e0 la licorne]]'' (\"Lady with the unicorn\") in the [[Mus\u00e9e de Cluny]], [[Paris]], were also woven in the [[Southern Netherlands]] before 1500, and show the five senses (the gateways to temptation) and finally Love (\"A mon seul desir\" the legend reads), with unicorns featured in each piece.

The unicorn already functioned as a symbol of the [[Incarnation of Christ|Incarnation]] and whether this meaning is intended in many ''prima facie'' secular depictions can be a difficult matter of scholarly interpretation. There is no such ambiguity in the scenes where the archangel [[Gabriel]] is shown blowing a horn, as hounds chase the unicorn into the Virgin's arms, and a little Christ Child descends on rays of light from God the Father. The [[Council of Trent]] finally banned this somewhat over-elaborated, if charming, depiction,<ref>G Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art, Vol. I'',1971 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, pp. 52-4 & figs 126-9, {{ISBN|0-85331-270-2}}, [http://www.sagen.at/fotos/data/603/medium/Maria_Gail_HortusConclusus_Detail.jpg another image]</ref> partly on the grounds of realism, as no one now believed the unicorn to be a real animal.\n\n[[Shakespeare]] scholars describe unicorns being captured by a hunter standing in front of a tree, the unicorn goaded into charging; the hunter would step aside the last moment and the unicorn would embed its horn deeply into the tree (See annotations<ref>''The Complete Works of Shakespeare'', Fourth Edition, [[David Bevington]], pg. 1281;''The Norton Shakespeare'', Second Edition, pg 2310, footnote 9; ''[[The Riverside Shakespeare]]'', Second Edition, page 1515</ref> of [[Timon of Athens]], Act 4, scene 3, c. line 341: \"wert thou the unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury\".)\n\n=== Heraldry ===\nIn [[heraldry]], a unicorn is often depicted as a horse with a goat's cloven hooves and beard, a lion's tail, and a slender, spiral horn on its forehead<ref name=\"friar\">{{cite book\n|last=Friar\n|first=Stephen\n|title=A New Dictionary of Heraldry\n|year=1987\n|pages= 353\u2013354\n|publisher=Alphabooks/[[A & C Black]]\n|place=London\n|isbn=978-0-906670-44-6}}</ref> (non-equine attributes may be replaced with equine ones, as can be seen from the following gallery).

As soon as the unicorn sees her, it lays its head on her lap and falls asleep. This became a basic emblematic tag that underlies medieval notions of the unicorn, justifying its appearance in every form of [[Sacred art|religious art.]] Interpretations of the unicorn myth focus on the medieval lore of beguiled lovers,{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} whereas some religious writers interpret the unicorn and its death as the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion of Christ]]. The myths refer to a beast with one horn that can only be tamed by a [[Virginity|virgin]]; subsequently, some writers translated this into an allegory for Christ's relationship with the Virgin Mary.\n\nThe unicorn also figured in [[courtly love|courtly terms]]: for some 13th-century [[France|French]] authors such as [[Theobald I of Navarre|Thibaut of Champagne]] and [[Richard de Fournival]], the lover is attracted to his lady as the unicorn is to the virgin. With the rise of [[Renaissance humanism|humanism]], the unicorn also acquired more orthodox secular meanings, emblematic of chaste love and faithful marriage.

The tapestries now hang in [[the Cloisters]] division of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]]. In the series, richly dressed [[Nobility|noblemen]], accompanied by huntsmen and hounds, pursue a unicorn against ''[[mille-fleur]]'' backgrounds or settings of buildings and gardens. They bring the animal to bay with the help of a maiden who traps it with her charms, appear to kill it, and bring it back to a castle; in the last and most famous panel, \"The Unicorn in Captivity\", the unicorn is shown alive again and happy, chained to a [[pomegranate]] tree surrounded by a fence, in a field of flowers. Scholars conjecture that the red stains on its flanks are not blood but rather the juice from pomegranates, which were a symbol of fertility. However, the true meaning of the mysterious resurrected unicorn in the last panel is unclear. The series was woven about 1500 in the [[Low Countries]], probably [[Brussels]] or [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]], for an unknown patron. A set of six [[engraving]]s on the same theme, treated rather differently, were engraved by the French artist [[Jean Duvet]] in the 1540s.\n\nAnother famous set of six tapestries of ''[[The Lady and the Unicorn|Dame \u00e0 la licorne]]'' (\"Lady with the unicorn\") in the [[Mus\u00e9e de Cluny]], [[Paris]], were also woven in the [[Southern Netherlands]] before 1500, and show the five senses (the gateways to temptation) and finally Love (\"A mon seul desir\" the legend reads), with unicorns featured in each piece. Facsimiles of these unicorn tapestries were woven for permanent display in [[Stirling Castle]], [[Scotland]], to take the place of a set recorded in the castle in a [[Scottish Royal tapestry collection|16th-century inventory]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ancient unicorn tapestries recreated at Stirling Castle|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-33237947|website=BBC News|accessdate=11 June 2017|date=23 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nA rather rare, late-15th-century, variant depiction of the ''[[hortus conclusus]]'' in religious art combined the [[Annunciation to Mary]] with the themes of the ''Hunt of the Unicorn'' and ''Virgin and Unicorn'', so popular in secular art. The unicorn already functioned as a symbol of the [[Incarnation of Christ|Incarnation]] and whether this meaning is intended in many ''prima facie'' secular depictions can be a difficult matter of scholarly interpretation. There is no such ambiguity in the scenes where the archangel [[Gabriel]] is shown blowing a horn, as hounds chase the unicorn into the Virgin's arms, and a little Christ Child descends on rays of light from God the Father.

In 1985, [[Andy Nulman]] joined the festival's staff and introduced English-language events as well; under Nulman's stewardship, the festival increased to a full month, with French-speaking performers during the first half, and English speakers in the second half. International and non-verbal acts (acrobats, pantomimes, etc.) are scattered throughout the program.\n\nIn 1999, Nulman left the festival's full-time employ; however, he directed its major Gala Shows at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis Theatre]] every July, and remained on the board of directors of the festival's parent company. After an 11-year absence, Nulman returned to Just for Laughs in July 2010 as president of Festivals and Television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nsb.com/speakers/view/andy-nulman|title=Andy Nulman \u00bb Speaker Profile \u00bb National Speakers Bureau|website=Nsb.com|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nEach day, performers, \"New [[Vaudevillians]]\" and other acts both vocal and visual perform throughout the city, particularly in the \"[[Quartier Latin, Montreal|Latin Quarter]]\"\u2014an area known for its theatres, caf\u00e9s and boutique shopping. In the evenings, the nightclubs and live venue theatres offer special programs supporting the performers.\n\nAlthough Just for Laughs attracts spectators from around the world, many of those in the audience are talent scouts, booking agents, producers and managers from the entertainment industry. Performing at the festival is one of the biggest opportunities for undiscovered talent to showcase their act in front of industry professionals.\n\nThe Just for Laughs festival also has the [[Comedia (festival)|Comedia]] comedy [[film festival]] component, which started in 1996. It gives awards for feature and short films. 2005, Comedia screened 125 [[short films]] from around the world as well as several feature-length films.\n\nIn February 1994, the festival sponsored a splinter project in [[Hollywood, Florida]]. That coastal area is a favourite winter destination for [[Quebec]]ers who head [[Snowbird (person)|south to vacation]] in the warmer weather. The event, Juste Pour Rire\u2014En Vacances (Just For Laughs\u2014On Vacation), was held in the Young Circle Park, an outdoor venue with an urban park setting.\n\nIn July 2007, Just For Laughs celebrated its 25th edition, launching a festival in [[Toronto]], Ontario.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn 2009, the [[Chicago]] festival was launched and aired on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timewarner.com/newsroom/press-releases/2009/03/31/tbs-presents-a-very-funny-festival-just-for-laughs-all-star|title=TBS PRESENTS A VERY FUNNY FESTIVAL: JUST FOR LAUGHS -- All-Star Comedy Lineup Unveiled for June's Premiere Event in Chicago|author=Time Warner Inc.|date=|website=Time Warner|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gapersblock.com/ac/2013/06/06/-photo-courtesy-of-tbs/|title=TBS Just for Laughs: 5th Annual Funny Festival Returns to Chicago|author=|date=|website=gapersblock.com|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2016, Just For Laughs [[London]] was held at [[Russel Square]].<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.ikonlondonmagazine.com/review-just-for-laughs-festival-london/ | title= Review: Just For Laughs Festival London | publisher= Ikon London Magazine | first = Tamara | last = Orlova-Alvarez | date= 3 July 2016 | accessdate=23 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn April 1, 2019, Just for Laughs' name went fully stylized to \"''J''ust for laughs\".\n\nOn April 3, 2020, it was announced the Just For Laughs Festival would be postponed until the fall due to the [[2019\u201320_coronavirus_pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].

As per a partnership with the conglomerate, [[Quebecor]] was given right of first refusal to counter competing offers. The company, however, declined. On March 21, 2018, it was announced that the festival would be acquired by a partnership between U.S.-based talent agency [[ICM Partners]] and [[Ontario]] comedian [[Howie Mandel]]. In their announcement of the purchase, it was stated that Just for Laughs would remain based in Montreal (with Mandel considering the event to be a key component of local culture), and that there would be no changes in its management or operations. It was also stated that the partnership was seeking other local partners.

In 1985, [[Andy Nulman]] joined the festival's staff and introduced English-language events as well; under Nulman's stewardship, the festival increased to a full month, with French-speaking performers during the first half, and English speakers in the second half. International and non-verbal acts (acrobats, pantomimes, etc.) are scattered throughout the program.\n\nIn 1999, Nulman left the festival's full-time employ; however, he directed its major Gala Shows at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis Theatre]] every July, and remained on the board of directors of the festival's parent company. After an 11-year absence, Nulman returned to Just for Laughs in July 2010 as president of Festivals and Television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nsb.com/speakers/view/andy-nulman|title=Andy Nulman \u00bb Speaker Profile \u00bb National Speakers Bureau|website=Nsb.com|accessdate=June 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nEach day, performers, \"New [[Vaudevillians]]\" and other acts both vocal and visual perform throughout the city, particularly in the \"[[Quartier Latin, Montreal|Latin Quarter]]\"\u2014an area known for its theatres, caf\u00e9s and boutique shopping. In the evenings, the nightclubs and live venue theatres offer special programs supporting the performers.\n\nAlthough Just for Laughs attracts spectators from around the world, many of those in the audience are talent scouts, booking agents, producers and managers from the entertainment industry. Performing at the festival is one of the biggest opportunities for undiscovered talent to showcase their act in front of industry professionals.\n\nThe Just for Laughs festival also has the [[Comedia (festival)|Comedia]] comedy [[film festival]] component, which started in 1996. It gives awards for feature and short films. 2005, Comedia screened 125 [[short films]] from around the world as well as several feature-length films.\n\nIn February 1994, the festival sponsored a splinter project in [[Hollywood, Florida]]. That coastal area is a favourite winter destination for [[Quebec]]ers who head [[Snowbird (person)|south to vacation]] in the warmer weather. The event, Juste Pour Rire\u2014En Vacances (Just For Laughs\u2014On Vacation), was held in the Young Circle Park, an outdoor venue with an urban park setting.\n\nIn July 2007, Just For Laughs celebrated its 25th edition, launching a festival in [[Toronto]], Ontario.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\nIn 2009, the [[Chicago]] festival was launched and aired on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timewarner.com/newsroom/press-releases/2009/03/31/tbs-presents-a-very-funny-festival-just-for-laughs-all-star|title=TBS PRESENTS A VERY FUNNY FESTIVAL: JUST FOR LAUGHS -- All-Star Comedy Lineup Unveiled for June's Premiere Event in Chicago|author=Time Warner Inc.|date=|website=Time Warner|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gapersblock.com/ac/2013/06/06/-photo-courtesy-of-tbs/|title=TBS Just for Laughs: 5th Annual Funny Festival Returns to Chicago|author=|date=|website=gapersblock.com|accessdate=12 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2016, Just For Laughs [[London]] was held at [[Russel Square]].<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.ikonlondonmagazine.com/review-just-for-laughs-festival-london/ | title= Review: Just For Laughs Festival London | publisher= Ikon London Magazine | first = Tamara | last = Orlova-Alvarez | date= 3 July 2016 | accessdate=23 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn April 1, 2019, Just for Laughs' name went fully stylized to \"''J''ust for laughs\".\n\nOn April 3, 2020, it was announced the Just For Laughs Festival would be postponed until the fall, due to the [[2019\u201320_coronavirus_pandemic|coronavirus pandemic]].

As per a partnership with the conglomerate, [[Quebecor]] was given right of first refusal to counter competing offers. The company, however, declined. On March 21, 2018, it was announced that the festival would be acquired by a partnership between U.S.-based talent agency [[ICM Partners]] and [[Ontario]] comedian [[Howie Mandel]]. In their announcement of the purchase, it was stated that Just for Laughs would remain based in Montreal (with Mandel considering the event to be a key component of local culture), and that there would be no changes in its management or operations.
