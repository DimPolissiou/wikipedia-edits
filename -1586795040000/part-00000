{"title_page": "Milling cutter", "text_new": "'''Milling cutters''' are [[cutting tool (machining)|cutting tools]] typically used in [[Milling (machining)|milling]] machines or [[machining centres]] to perform milling operations (and occasionally in other [[machine tool]]s). They remove material by their movement within the machine (e.g., a ball nose mill) or directly from the cutter's shape (e.g., a form tool such as a hobbing cutter).\n\n==Features of a milling cutter==\n[[Image:End Mill 02 labels.png|thumb|180px|An End Mill cutter with two flutes]]\n\nMilling cutters come in several shapes and many sizes. There is also a choice of coatings, as well as [[rake angle]] and number of cutting surfaces.\n* '''Shape:''' Several standard shapes of milling cutter are used in industry today,  which are explained in more detail below.\n* '''Flutes / teeth:''' The flutes of the milling bit are the deep helical grooves running up the cutter, while the sharp blade along the edge of the flute is known as the tooth. The tooth cuts the material, and chips of this material are pulled up the flute by the rotation of the cutter. There is almost always one tooth per flute, but some cutters have two teeth per flute.<ref>[http://www.mmsonline.com/articles/0705rt3.html Rapid Traverse: More Teeth Per Flute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222952/http://www.mmsonline.com/articles/0705rt3.html |date=2007-09-27 }}</ref> Often, the words ''flute'' and ''tooth'' are used interchangeably. Milling cutters may have from one to many teeth, with 2, 3 and 4 being most common. Typically, the more teeth a cutter has, the more rapidly it can remove material. So, a 4-tooth cutter can remove material at twice the rate of a 2-tooth cutter.\n* '''Helix angle:''' The flutes of a milling cutter are almost always helical. If the flutes were straight, the whole tooth would impact the material at once, causing vibration and reducing accuracy and surface quality. Setting the flutes at an angle allows the tooth to enter the material gradually, reducing vibration. Typically, finishing cutters have a higher rake angle (tighter helix) to give a better finish.\n* '''Center cutting:''' Some milling cutters can drill straight down (plunge) through the material, while others cannot. This is because the teeth of some cutters do not go all the way to the centre of the end face. However, these cutters can cut downwards at an angle of 45 degrees or so.\n* '''Roughing or Finishing:''' Different types of cutter are available for cutting away large amounts of material, leaving a poor surface finish (roughing), or removing a smaller amount of material, but leaving a good surface finish (finishing). A roughing cutter may have serrated teeth for breaking the chips of material into smaller pieces. These teeth leave a rough surface behind. A finishing cutter may have a large number (4 or more) teeth for removing material carefully. However, the large number of flutes leaves little room for efficient [[swarf]] removal, so they are less appropriate for removing large amounts of material.\n* '''Coatings:''' The right tool coatings can have a great influence on the cutting process by increasing cutting speed and tool life, and improving the surface finish. [[Polycrystalline diamond]] (PCD) is an exceptionally hard coating used on cutters which must withstand high abrasive wear. A PCD coated tool may last up to 100 times longer than an uncoated tool. However the coating cannot be used at temperatures above 600 degrees C, or on ferrous metals. Tools for machining aluminium are sometimes given a coating of [[TiAlN]]. Aluminium is a relatively sticky metal, and can weld itself to the teeth of tools, causing them to appear blunt. However it tends not to stick to TiAlN, allowing the tool to be used for much longer in aluminium.\n* '''Shank:''' The shank is the cylindrical (non-fluted) part of the tool which is used to hold and locate it in the tool holder. A shank may be perfectly round, and held by friction, or it may have a Weldon Flat, where a [[set screw]], also known as a [[grub screw]], makes contact for increased torque without the tool slipping. The diameter may be different from the diameter of the cutting part of the tool, so that it can be held by a standard tool holder.\u00a7\n\n==Types==\n\n=== End Mill ===\n[[Image:MillingCutterSlotEndMillBallnose.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Slot, end mill, and ballnose cutters]]\n{{Main|End mill}}\n\nEnd mills (middle row in image) are those tools which have cutting teeth at one end, as well as on the sides. The words ''end mill'' are generally used to refer to flat bottomed cutters, but also include rounded cutters (referred to as ''ball nosed'') and radiused cutters (referred to as ''bull nose'', or ''torus''). They are usually made from [[high speed steel]] or [[cemented carbide]], and have one or more flutes. They are the most common tool used in a vertical mill.\n\n===Roughing end mill ===\nRoughing end mills quickly remove large amounts of material. This kind of end mill utilizes a wavy tooth form cut on the periphery. These wavy teeth act as many successive cutting edges producing many small chips. This results in a relatively rough surface finish, but the swarf takes the form of short thin sections and is more manageable than a thicker more ribbon-like section, resulting in smaller chips that are easier to clear. During cutting, multiple teeth are in simultaneous contact with the workpiece, reducing chatter and vibration. Rapid stock removal with heavy milling cuts is sometimes called ''hogging''. Roughing end mills are also sometimes known as \"rippa\" or \"ripper\" cutters.\n\n===Ball cutter===\n''Ball nose'' cutters or ''ball end'' mills (lower row in image) are similar to slot drills, but the end of the cutters are [[Sphere|hemispherical]]. They are ideal for machining 3-dimensional contoured shapes in [[CNC|machining centres]], for example in [[moulding (process)|moulds]] and [[Die (manufacturing)|dies]]. They are sometimes called ''ball mills'' in shop-floor slang, despite the fact that that term also has [[Ball mill|another meaning]]. They are also used to add a radius between perpendicular faces to reduce [[stress concentrations]].\n\nA ''bull nose'' cutter mills a slot with a corner radius, intermediate between an end mill and ball cutter; for example, it may be a 20&nbsp;mm diameter cutter with a 2&nbsp;mm radius corner. The silhouette is essentially a rectangle with its corners truncated (by either a chamfer or radius).\n\n===Slab mill===\n[[Image:MillingCutterHSSSlab.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[High speed steel]] slab mill]]\n\nSlab mills are used either by themselves or in [[gang milling]] operations on manual horizontal or universal milling machines to machine large broad surfaces quickly. They have been superseded by the use of [[cemented carbide]]-tipped face mills which are then used in vertical mills or machining centres.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Side-and-face cutter===\n[[Image:MillSideAndFaceCutter.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Side and face cutter]]\n\nThe side-and-face cutter is designed with cutting teeth on its side as well as its circumference. They are made in varying diameters and widths depending on the application. The teeth on the side allow the cutter to make ''unbalanced cuts'' (cutting on one side only) without deflecting the cutter as would happen with a slitting saw or slot cutter (no side teeth).\n\nCutters of this form factor were the earliest milling cutters developed. From the 1810s to at least the 1880s they were the most common form of milling cutter, whereas today that distinction probably goes to [[#End mill|end mills]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Involute gear cutter===\n[[Image:MillInvoluteGearCutter.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Involute gear cutter \u2013 number 4:<br />{{\u00b7}}10 [[diametrical pitch]] cutter<br />{{\u00b7}}Cuts gears from 26 through to 34 teeth<br />{{\u00b7}}14.5 degree [[pressure angle]]]]\n\nThere are 8 cutters (excluding the rare half sizes) that will cut gears from 12 teeth through to a rack (infinite diameter).\n\n===Hob===\n[[Image:MillingCutterHobbingInvolute.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Hobbing cutter]]\n{{Main|Hobbing}}\n[[File:AlCrTiN-CoatedHob NanoShieldPVD Thailand.jpg|thumb|left|Aluminium chromium titanium nitride (AlCrTiN) coated hob using [[Cathodic arc deposition]] technique]]\n\nThese cutters are a type of form tool and are used in [[hobbing machine]]s to generate gears. A cross section of the cutter's tooth will generate the required shape on the workpiece, once set to the appropriate conditions (blank size). A hobbing machine is a specialised milling machine.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Thread mill===\n{{Main|Threading (manufacturing)#Thread milling}}\n[[File:Single form thread cutting tool.svg|thumb|left|A diagram of a solid single-form thread cutting tool]]\n[[File:HM-Fr\u00e4ser.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|A solid multiple-form thread milling cutter.]]\nWhereas a hob engages the work much as a mating gear would (and cuts the blank progressively until it reaches final shape), a thread milling cutter operates much like an endmill, traveling around the work in a helical interpolation.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Face mill ===\n<!-- [[Face mill]] redirects here -->\nA face mill is a cutter designed for facing as opposed to e.g., creating a pocket (end mills).  The cutting edges of face mills are always located along its sides.  As such it must always cut in a horizontal direction at a given depth coming from outside the stock.  Multiple teeth distribute the chip load, and since the teeth are normally disposable [[carbide insert]]s, this combination allows for very large and efficient face milling.    \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Fly cutter ===<!-- [[Tipped tool]] links here -->\nA fly cutter is composed of a body into which one or two [[tool bit]]s are inserted. As the entire unit rotates, the tool bits take broad, shallow facing cuts. Fly cutters are analogous to face mills in that their purpose is face milling and their individual cutters are replaceable. Face mills are more ideal in various respects (e.g., rigidity, indexability of inserts without disturbing effective cutter diameter or tool length offset, depth-of-cut capability), but tend to be expensive, whereas fly cutters are very inexpensive.\n\nMost fly cutters simply have a cylindrical center body that holds one tool bit. It is usually a standard left-hand turning tool that is held at an angle of 30 to 60 degrees. Fly cutters with two tool bits have no \"official\" name but are often called double fly cutters, double-end fly cutters, or fly bars. The latter name reflects that they often take the form of a bar of steel with a tool bit fastened on each end. Often these bits will be mounted at right angles to the bar's main axis, and the cutting geometry is supplied by using a standard right-hand turning tool.\n\nRegular fly cutters (one tool bit, swept diameter usually less than 100&nbsp;mm) are widely sold in machinists' tooling catalogs. Fly bars are rarely sold commercially; they are usually made by the user. Fly bars are perhaps a bit more dangerous to use than endmills and regular fly cutters because of their larger swing. As one machinist put it, running a fly bar is like \"running a lawn mower without the deck\",<ref name=\"PracticalMachinist_post749841\">{{Citation|author=J.Ramsey|title=Max Diameter for a Flycutter?|work=PracticalMachinist.com discussion board|url=http://www.practicalmachinist.com/vb/general/max-diameter-flycutter-144309/#post749841|accessdate=2011-06-05|postscript=.}}</ref> that is, the exposed swinging cutter is a rather large opportunity to take in nearby hand tools, rags, fingers, and so on. However, given that a machinist can never be careless with impunity around rotating cutters or workpieces, this just means using the same care as always except with slightly higher stakes. Well-made fly bars in conscientious hands give years of trouble-free, cost-effective service for the facing off of large polygonal workpieces such as die/mold blocks.\n\n===Woodruff cutter===\n[[Image:WoodruffCutters-Keys.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Woodruff key cutters and keys]]\n\nWoodruff cutters are used to cut the keyway for a [[woodruff key]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Hollow mill===\n[[File:HM Example.jpg|thumb|4 bladed hollow mill]]\nHollow milling cutters, more often called simply ''hollow mills'', are essentially \"inside-out endmills\". They are shaped like a piece of pipe (but with thicker walls), with their cutting edges on the inside surface. They were originally used on used on [[turret lathe]]s and [[screw machine (automatic lathe)|screw machine]]s as an alternative to turning with a [[Tool bit#Box tool|box tool]], or on milling machines or drill presses to finish a cylindrical boss (such as a [[trunnion]]). Hollow mills can be used on modern [[Numerical control|CNC]] lathes and [[Swiss-style lathe|Swiss style]] machines.  An advantage to using an indexable adjustable hollow mill on a Swiss style machine is replacing multiple tools.\u00a0 By performing multiple operations in a single pass, the machine does not need as can accommodate other tools in the tool zone and improves productivity.\n\nMore advanced hollow mills use indexable [[carbide]] inserts for cutting, although traditional [[High-speed steel|high speed steel]] and carbide tipped blades are still used.\n\nHollow milling has an advantage over other ways of cutting because it can perform multiple operations.  A hollow mill can reduce the diameter of a part and also perform [[Facing (machining)|facing]], [[centering]], and [[Chamfer|chamfering]] in a single pass.\n\nHollow mills offer an advantage over single point tooling.  Multiple blades allow the [[Speeds and feeds|feed rate]] to double and can hold a closer concentricity.  The number of blades can be as many as 8 or as few as 3.\u00a0 For significant diameter removal (roughing), more blades are necessary.\n\n[[Trepanning (drilling)|Trepanning]] is also possible with a hollow mill.  Special form blades can be used on a hollow mill for trepanning diameters, forms, and ring grooves.\n\n[[Interpolation (disambiguation)|Interpolation]] is also not necessary when using a hollow mill; this can result in a significant reduction of production time.\n\nBoth convex and concave spherical radii are possible with a hollow mill.  The multiple blades of a hollow mill allow  this radius to be produced while holding a tight tolerance. \n\nA common use of a hollow mill is preparing for threading.\u00a0 The hollow mill can create a consistent pre-thread diameter quickly, improving productivity.\n\nAn adjustable hollow mill is a valuable tool for even a small machine shop to have because the blades can be changed out for an almost infinite number of possible geometries.<br />\n\n===Dovetail cutter===\nA dovetail cutter is an end mill whose form leaves behind a [[dovetail joint|dovetail]] slot, such as often forms the ways of a machine tool.\n\n===Shell mill===\n\n====Modular principle====\n[[File:Face Mill Index 01.png|thumb|A face mill shell. The rectangular cutout area on the back side is the pocket that engages the lugs/tangs of the arbor.]]\nA shell mill is any of various milling cutters (typically a face mill or endmill) whose construction takes a [[modularity|modular]] form, with the shank (arbor) made separately from the body of the cutter, which is called a \"shell\" and attaches to the shank/arbor via any of several standardized joining methods.\n\nThis modular style of construction is appropriate for large milling cutters for about the same reason that large diesel engines use separate pieces for each cylinder and head whereas a smaller engine would use one integrated casting. Two reasons are that (1) for the maker it is more practical (and thus less expensive) to make the individual pieces as separate endeavors than to machine all their features in relation to each other while the whole unit is integrated (which would require a larger machine tool work envelope); and (2) the user can change some pieces while keeping other pieces the same (rather than changing the whole unit). One arbor (at a hypothetical price of USD100) can serve for various shells at different times. Thus 5 different milling cutters may require only USD100 worth of arbor cost, rather than USD500, as long as the workflow of the shop does not require them all to be set up simultaneously. It is also possible that a crashed tool scraps only the shell rather than both the shell and arbor. To also avoid damage to the shell, many cutters, especially in larger diameters, also have another replaceable part called shim, which is mounted to the shell and the inserts are mounted on the shim. That way, in case of light damage, only the insert and maximum the shim needs replacement. The shell is safe. This would be like crashing a \"regular\" endmill and being able to reuse the shank rather than losing it along with the flutes.\n\nMost shell mills made today use indexable inserts for the cutting edges\u2014thus shank, body, and cutting edges are all modular components.\n\n====Mounting methods====\nThere are several common standardized methods of mounting shell mills to their arbors. They overlap somewhat (not entirely) with the analogous [[Chuck (engineering)#Mounting methods|joining of lathe chucks to the spindle nose]].\n\nThe most common type of joint between shell and arbor involves a fairly large cylindrical feature at center (to locate the shell concentric to the arbor) and two driving lugs or tangs that drive the shell with a positive engagement (like a [[dog clutch]]). Within the central cylindrical area, one or several socket head cap screws fasten the shell to the arbor.\n\nAnother type of shell fastening is simply a large-diameter fine thread. The shell then screws onto the arbor just as old-style lathe chuck backplates screw onto the lathe's spindle nose. This method is commonly used on the 2\" or 3\" boring heads used on knee mills. As with the threaded-spindle-nose lathe chucks, this style of mounting requires that the cutter only take cuts in one rotary direction. Usually (i.e., with right-hand helix orientation) this means only [[G-code#M03|M03]], never [[G-code#M04|M04]], or in pre-CNC terminology, \"only forward, never reverse\". One could use a left-hand thread if one needed a mode of use involving the opposite directions (i.e., only M04, never M03).\n\n==Using a milling cutter==\n\n=== Chip formation ===\nAlthough there are many different types of milling cutter, understanding chip formation is fundamental to the use of any of them.\nAs the milling cutter rotates, the material to be cut is fed into it, and each tooth of the cutter cuts away a small chip of material. Achieving the correct size of chip is of critical importance. The size of this chip depends on several variables.\n\n;Surface cutting speed (V<sub>c</sub>): This is the speed at which each tooth cuts through the material as the tool spins. This is measured either in metres per minute in metric countries, or surface feet per minute (SFM) in America. Typical values for cutting speed are 10m/min to 60m/min for some steels, and 100m/min and 600m/min for aluminum. This should not be confused with the feed rate.  This value is also known as \"tangential velocity.\"\n;Spindle speed (S): This is the rotation speed of the tool, and is measured in revolutions per minute (rpm). Typical values are from hundreds of rpm, up to tens of thousands of rpm.\n;Diameter of the tool (D):\n;Number of teeth (z):\n;Feed per tooth (F<sub>z</sub>): This is the distance the material is fed into the cutter as each tooth rotates. This value is the size of the deepest cut the tooth will make.Typical values could be 0.1mm/tooth or 1 mm/tooth\n;Feed rate (F): This is the speed at which the material is fed into the cutter. Typical values are from 20mm/min to 5000mm/min.\n;Depth of cut: This is how deep the tool is under the surface of the material being cut (not shown on the diagram). This will be the height of the chip produced. Typically, the depth of cut will be less than or equal to the diameter of the cutting tool.\n\nThe machinist needs three values: '''S''', '''F''' and '''Depth''' when deciding how to cut a new material with a new tool. However, he will probably be given values of '''V<sub>c</sub>''' and '''F<sub>z</sub>''' from the tool manufacturer. '''S''' and '''F''' can be calculated from them:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:50%\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n! Spindle Speed\n! Feed rate\n|- align=\"center\"\n| <math>S = \\frac {V_c}{\\pi D} \\, </math> || style=\"width:50%\" | <math>F = zSF_z \\, </math>\n|-\n| Looking at the formula for the spindle speed, S, it can be seen that larger tools require lower spindle speeds, while small tools may be able to go at high speeds.\n| The formula for the feed rate, F shows that increasing S or z gives a higher feed rate. Therefore, machinists may choose a tool with the highest number of teeth that can still cope with the swarf load.\n|}\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Conventional milling versus climb milling ===<!-- [[Climb milling]] links here -->\n[[Image:Conventional Milling 01.png|thumb|left|275px|Conventional milling. Point '''A''' may become work hardened.]]\n[[Image:Climb Milling 01.png|thumb|300px|right|Chip formation during climb milling.]]\n\nA milling cutter can cut in two directions, sometimes known as ''conventional'' or ''up'' and ''climb'' or ''down''.\n\n* '''Conventional milling (left):''' The chip thickness starts at zero thickness, and increases up to the maximum. The cut is so light at the beginning that the tool does not cut, but slides across the surface of the material, until sufficient [[pressure]] is built up and the tooth suddenly bites and begins to cut. This deforms the material (at point A on the diagram, left), [[work hardening|hardening]] it, and dulling the tool. The sliding and biting behaviour leaves a poor finish on the material.\n* '''Climb milling (right):''' Each tooth engages the material at a definite point, and the width of the cut starts at the maximum and decreases to zero. The chips are disposed behind the cutter, leading to easier swarf removal. The tooth does not rub on the material, and so tool life may be longer. However, climb milling can apply larger loads to the machine, and so is not recommended for older milling machines, or machines which are not in good condition. This type of milling is used predominantly on mills with a [[backlash (engineering)|backlash]] eliminator.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Cutter location (cutter radius compensation)===\n[[Cutter location]] is the topic of where to locate the cutter in order to achieve the desired contour (geometry) of the workpiece, given that the cutter's size is non-zero. The most common example is cutter radius compensation (CRC) for [[endmill]]s, where the centerline of the tool will be offset from the target position by a [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] whose ''distance'' is equal to the cutter's radius and whose ''direction'' is governed by the [[#Conventional milling versus climb milling|left/right, climb/conventional, up/down distinction]]. In most implementations of [[G-code]], it is [[G-code#G40|G40 through G42]] that control CRC (G40 cancel, G41 left/climb, G42 right/conventional). The radius values for each tool are entered into the offset register(s) by the CNC operator or machinist, who then tweaks them during production in order to keep the finished sizes within [[engineering tolerance|tolerance]]. Cutter location for 3D contouring in 3-, 4-, or 5-axis milling with a ball-endmill is handled readily by [[computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]] software rather than manual programming. Typically the CAM vector output is postprocessed into G-code by a postprocessor program that is tailored to the particular CNC control model. Some late-model CNC controls accept the vector output directly, and do the translation to servo inputs themselves, internally.\n\n===Swarf removal===\nAnother important quality of the milling cutter to consider is its ability to deal with the [[swarf]] generated by the cutting process. If the swarf is not removed as fast as it is produced, the flutes will clog and prevent the tool cutting efficiently, causing vibration, tool wear and overheating. Several factors affect swarf removal, including the depth and angle of the flutes, the size and shape of the chips, the flow of coolant, and the surrounding material. It may be difficult to predict, but a good machinist will watch out for swarf build up, and adjust the milling conditions if it is observed.\n\n==Selecting a milling cutter==\nSelecting a milling cutter is not a simple task. There are many variables, opinions and lore to consider, but essentially the machinist is trying to choose a tool which will cut the material to the required specification for the least cost. The cost of the job is a combination of the price of the tool, the time taken by the milling machine, and the time taken by the machinist. Often, for jobs of a large number of parts, and days of machining time, the cost of the tool is lowest of the three costs.\n\n* '''Material:''' [[High speed steel]] (HSS) cutters are the least-expensive and shortest-lived cutters. Cobalt-bearing high speed steels generally can be run 10% [[Speeds and feeds|faster]] than regular high speed steel. [[Cemented carbide]] tools are more expensive than steel, but last longer, and can be run much faster, so prove more economical in the long run.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} HSS tools are perfectly adequate for many applications. The progression from regular HSS to cobalt HSS to carbide could be viewed as very good, even better, and the best. Using high speed spindles may preclude use of HSS entirely.\n* '''Diameter:''' Larger tools can remove material faster than small ones, therefore the largest possible cutter that will fit in the job is usually chosen. When milling an internal contour, or concave external contours, the diameter is limited by the size of internal curves. The radius of the cutter must be less than or equal to the radius of the smallest arc.\n* '''Flutes:''' More flutes allows a higher feed rate, because there is less material removed per flute. But because the core diameter increases, there is less room for swarf, so a balance must be chosen.\n* '''Coating:''' Coatings, such as [[titanium nitride]], also increase initial cost but reduce wear and increase tool life. TiAlN coating reduces sticking of aluminium to the tool, reducing and sometimes eliminating need for lubrication.\n* '''Helix angle:''' High [[helix angle]]s are typically best for soft metals, and low helix angles for hard or tough metals.\n\n==History==\nThe history of milling cutters is intimately bound up with [[Milling machine#History|that of milling machines]].  Milling evolved from rotary filing, so there is a continuum of development between the earliest milling cutters known, such as that of [[Jacques de Vaucanson]] from about the 1760s or 1770s,<ref name=\"Woodbury1972p23\">{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1972|p=23}}.</ref><ref name=\"Roe1916p206\">{{Harvnb|Roe|1916|p=206}}.</ref> through the cutters of the milling pioneers of the 1810s through 1850s ([[Eli Whitney, Jr.|Whitney]], [[Simeon North|North]], Johnson, [[James Nasmyth|Nasmyth]], and others),<ref name=\"Woodbury1972pp51-52\">{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1972|pp=51\u201352}}.</ref> to the cutters developed by Joseph R.

De Vries (1910)<ref name=\"DeVries1910p15\" /> reported, \"This revolution in the science of milling cutters took place in the States about the year 1870, and became generally known in Europe during the [[Weltausstellung 1873 Wien|Exhibition in Vienna in 1873]]. However strange it may seem now that this type of cutter has been universally adopted and its undeniable superiority to the old European type is no longer doubted, it was regarded very distrustfully and European experts were very reserved in expressing their judgment. Even we ourselves can remember that after the coarse pitched cutter had been introduced, certain very clever and otherwise shrewd experts and engineers regarded the new cutting tool with many a shake of the head. When[,] however, the [[Centennial Exposition|Worlds Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876]], exhibited to European experts a universal and many-sided application of the coarse pitched milling cutter which exceeded even the most sanguine expectations, the most far-seeing engineers were then convinced of the immense advantages which the application of the new type opened up for the metalworking industry, and from that time onwards the American type advanced, slowly at first, but later on with rapid strides\".<ref name=\"DeVries1910p15-16\">{{Harvnb|De Vries|1910|pp=15\u201316}}.</ref>\n\nWoodbury provides citations<ref name=\"Woodbury1972p54\">{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1972|p=54}}.</ref> of patents for various advances in milling cutter design, including irregular spacing of teeth (1867), forms of inserted teeth (1872), spiral groove for breaking up the cut (1881), and others.

They remove material by their movement within the machine (e.g., a ball nose mill) or directly from the cutter's shape (e.g., a form tool such as a hobbing cutter).\n\n==Features of a milling cutter==\n[[Image:End Mill 02 labels.png|thumb|180px|An End Mill cutter with two flutes]]\n\nMilling cutters come in several shapes and many sizes. There is also a choice of coatings, as well as [[rake angle]] and number of cutting surfaces.\n* '''Shape:''' Several standard shapes of milling cutter are used in industry today,  which are explained in more detail below.\n* '''Flutes / teeth:''' The flutes of the milling bit are the deep helical grooves running up the cutter, while the sharp blade along the edge of the flute is known as the tooth. The tooth cuts the material, and chips of this material are pulled up the flute by the rotation of the cutter. There is almost always one tooth per flute, but some cutters have two teeth per flute.<ref>[http://www.mmsonline.com/articles/0705rt3.html Rapid Traverse: More Teeth Per Flute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222952/http://www.mmsonline.com/articles/0705rt3.html |date=2007-09-27 }}</ref> Often, the words ''flute'' and ''tooth'' are used interchangeably. Milling cutters may have from one to many teeth, with 2, 3 and 4 being most common. Typically, the more teeth a cutter has, the more rapidly it can remove material. So, a 4-tooth cutter can remove material at twice the rate of a 2-tooth cutter.\n* '''Helix angle:''' The flutes of a milling cutter are almost always helical. If the flutes were straight, the whole tooth would impact the material at once, causing vibration and reducing accuracy and surface quality. Setting the flutes at an angle allows the tooth to enter the material gradually, reducing vibration. Typically, finishing cutters have a higher rake angle (tighter helix) to give a better finish.\n* '''Center cutting:''' Some milling cutters can drill straight down (plunge) through the material, while others cannot. This is because the teeth of some cutters do not go all the way to the centre of the end face. However, these cutters can cut downwards at an angle of 45 degrees or so.\n* '''Roughing or Finishing:''' Different types of cutter are available for cutting away large amounts of material, leaving a poor surface finish (roughing), or removing a smaller amount of material, but leaving a good surface finish (finishing). A roughing cutter may have serrated teeth for breaking the chips of material into smaller pieces. These teeth leave a rough surface behind. A finishing cutter may have a large number (4 or more) teeth for removing material carefully. However, the large number of flutes leaves little room for efficient [[swarf]] removal, so they are less appropriate for removing large amounts of material.\n* '''Coatings:''' The right tool coatings can have a great influence on the cutting process by increasing cutting speed and tool life, and improving the surface finish. [[Polycrystalline diamond]] (PCD) is an exceptionally hard coating used on cutters which must withstand high abrasive wear. A PCD coated tool may last up to 100 times longer than an uncoated tool. However the coating cannot be used at temperatures above 600 degrees C, or on ferrous metals. Tools for machining aluminium are sometimes given a coating of [[TiAlN]]. Aluminium is a relatively sticky metal, and can weld itself to the teeth of tools, causing them to appear blunt. However it tends not to stick to TiAlN, allowing the tool to be used for much longer in aluminium.\n* '''Shank:''' The shank is the cylindrical (non-fluted) part of the tool which is used to hold and locate it in the tool holder. A shank may be perfectly round, and held by friction, or it may have a Weldon Flat, where a [[set screw]], also known as a [[grub screw]], makes contact for increased torque without the tool slipping. The diameter may be different from the diameter of the cutting part of the tool, so that it can be held by a standard tool holder.\u00a7\n\n==Types==\n\n=== End Mill ===\n[[Image:MillingCutterSlotEndMillBallnose.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Slot, end mill, and ballnose cutters]]\n{{Main|End mill}}\n\nEnd mills (middle row in image) are those tools which have cutting teeth at one end, as well as on the sides. The words ''end mill'' are generally used to refer to flat bottomed cutters, but also include rounded cutters (referred to as ''ball nosed'') and radiused cutters (referred to as ''bull nose'', or ''torus''). They are usually made from [[high speed steel]] or [[cemented carbide]], and have one or more flutes. They are the most common tool used in a vertical mill.\n\n===Roughing end mill ===\nRoughing end mills quickly remove large amounts of material. This kind of end mill utilizes a wavy tooth form cut on the periphery. These wavy teeth act as many successive cutting edges producing many small chips. This results in a relatively rough surface finish, but the swarf takes the form of short thin sections and is more manageable than a thicker more ribbon-like section, resulting in smaller chips that are easier to clear. During cutting, multiple teeth are in simultaneous contact with the workpiece, reducing chatter and vibration. Rapid stock removal with heavy milling cuts is sometimes called ''hogging''. Roughing end mills are also sometimes known as \"rippa\" or \"ripper\" cutters.\n\n===Ball cutter===\n''Ball nose'' cutters or ''ball end'' mills (lower row in image) are similar to slot drills, but the end of the cutters are [[Sphere|hemispherical]]. They are ideal for machining 3-dimensional contoured shapes in [[CNC|machining centres]], for example in [[moulding (process)|moulds]] and [[Die (manufacturing)|dies]]. They are sometimes called ''ball mills'' in shop-floor slang, despite the fact that that term also has [[Ball mill|another meaning]]. They are also used to add a radius between perpendicular faces to reduce [[stress concentrations]].\n\nA ''bull nose'' cutter mills a slot with a corner radius, intermediate between an end mill and ball cutter; for example, it may be a 20&nbsp;mm diameter cutter with a 2&nbsp;mm radius corner. The silhouette is essentially a rectangle with its corners truncated (by either a chamfer or radius).\n\n===Slab mill===\n[[Image:MillingCutterHSSSlab.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[High speed steel]] slab mill]]\n\nSlab mills are used either by themselves or in [[gang milling]] operations on manual horizontal or universal milling machines to machine large broad surfaces quickly. They have been superseded by the use of [[cemented carbide]]-tipped face mills which are then used in vertical mills or machining centres.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Side-and-face cutter===\n[[Image:MillSideAndFaceCutter.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Side and face cutter]]\n\nThe side-and-face cutter is designed with cutting teeth on its side as well as its circumference. They are made in varying diameters and widths depending on the application. The teeth on the side allow the cutter to make ''unbalanced cuts'' (cutting on one side only) without deflecting the cutter as would happen with a slitting saw or slot cutter (no side teeth).\n\nCutters of this form factor were the earliest milling cutters developed. From the 1810s to at least the 1880s they were the most common form of milling cutter, whereas today that distinction probably goes to [[#End mill|end mills]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Involute gear cutter===\n[[Image:MillInvoluteGearCutter.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Involute gear cutter \u2013 number 4:<br />{{\u00b7}}10 [[diametrical pitch]] cutter<br />{{\u00b7}}Cuts gears from 26 through to 34 teeth<br />{{\u00b7}}14.5 degree [[pressure angle]]]]\n\nThere are 8 cutters (excluding the rare half sizes) that will cut gears from 12 teeth through to a rack (infinite diameter).\n\n===Hob===\n[[Image:MillingCutterHobbingInvolute.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Hobbing cutter]]\n{{Main|Hobbing}}\n[[File:AlCrTiN-CoatedHob NanoShieldPVD Thailand.jpg|thumb|left|Aluminium chromium titanium nitride (AlCrTiN) coated hob using [[Cathodic arc deposition]] technique]]\n\nThese cutters are a type of form tool and are used in [[hobbing machine]]s to generate gears. A cross section of the cutter's tooth will generate the required shape on the workpiece, once set to the appropriate conditions (blank size). A hobbing machine is a specialised milling machine.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Thread mill===\n{{Main|Threading (manufacturing)#Thread milling}}\n[[File:Single form thread cutting tool.svg|thumb|left|A diagram of a solid single-form thread cutting tool]]\n[[File:HM-Fr\u00e4ser.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|A solid multiple-form thread milling cutter.]]\nWhereas a hob engages the work much as a mating gear would (and cuts the blank progressively until it reaches final shape), a thread milling cutter operates much like an endmill, traveling around the work in a helical interpolation.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Face mill ===\n<!-- [[Face mill]] redirects here -->\nA face mill is a cutter designed for facing as opposed to e.g., creating a pocket (end mills).  The cutting edges of face mills are always located along its sides.  As such it must always cut in a horizontal direction at a given depth coming from outside the stock.  Multiple teeth distribute the chip load, and since the teeth are normally disposable [[carbide insert]]s, this combination allows for very large and efficient face milling.    \n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Fly cutter ===<!-- [[Tipped tool]] links here -->\nA fly cutter is composed of a body into which one or two [[tool bit]]s are inserted. As the entire unit rotates, the tool bits take broad, shallow facing cuts. Fly cutters are analogous to face mills in that their purpose is face milling and their individual cutters are replaceable. Face mills are more ideal in various respects (e.g., rigidity, indexability of inserts without disturbing effective cutter diameter or tool length offset, depth-of-cut capability), but tend to be expensive, whereas fly cutters are very inexpensive.\n\nMost fly cutters simply have a cylindrical center body that holds one tool bit. It is usually a standard left-hand turning tool that is held at an angle of 30 to 60 degrees. Fly cutters with two tool bits have no \"official\" name but are often called double fly cutters, double-end fly cutters, or fly bars. The latter name reflects that they often take the form of a bar of steel with a tool bit fastened on each end. Often these bits will be mounted at right angles to the bar's main axis, and the cutting geometry is supplied by using a standard right-hand turning tool.\n\nRegular fly cutters (one tool bit, swept diameter usually less than 100&nbsp;mm) are widely sold in machinists' tooling catalogs. Fly bars are rarely sold commercially; they are usually made by the user. Fly bars are perhaps a bit more dangerous to use than endmills and regular fly cutters because of their larger swing. As one machinist put it, running a fly bar is like \"running a lawn mower without the deck\",<ref name=\"PracticalMachinist_post749841\">{{Citation|author=J.Ramsey|title=Max Diameter for a Flycutter?|work=PracticalMachinist.com discussion board|url=http://www.practicalmachinist.com/vb/general/max-diameter-flycutter-144309/#post749841|accessdate=2011-06-05|postscript=.}}</ref> that is, the exposed swinging cutter is a rather large opportunity to take in nearby hand tools, rags, fingers, and so on. However, given that a machinist can never be careless with impunity around rotating cutters or workpieces, this just means using the same care as always except with slightly higher stakes. Well-made fly bars in conscientious hands give years of trouble-free, cost-effective service for the facing off of large polygonal workpieces such as die/mold blocks.\n\n===Woodruff cutter===\n[[Image:WoodruffCutters-Keys.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Woodruff key cutters and keys]]\n\nWoodruff cutters are used to cut the keyway for a [[woodruff key]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Hollow mill===\n[[File:HM Example.jpg|thumb|4 bladed hollow mill]]\nHollow milling cutters, more often called simply ''hollow mills'', are essentially \"inside-out endmills\". They are shaped like a piece of pipe (but with thicker walls), with their cutting edges on the inside surface. They were originally used on used on [[turret lathe]]s and [[screw machine (automatic lathe)|screw machine]]s as an alternative to turning with a [[Tool bit#Box tool|box tool]], or on milling machines or drill presses to finish a cylindrical boss (such as a [[trunnion]]). Hollow mills can be used on modern [[Numerical control|CNC]] lathes and [[Swiss-style lathe|Swiss style]] machines.  An advantage to using an indexable adjustable hollow mill on a Swiss style machine is replacing multiple tools.\u00a0 By performing multiple operations in a single pass, the machine does not need as can accommodate other tools in the tool zone and improves productivity.\n\nMore advanced hollow mills use indexable [[carbide]] inserts for cutting, although traditional [[High-speed steel|high speed steel]] and carbide tipped blades are still used.\n\nHollow milling has an advantage over other ways of cutting because it can perform multiple operations.  A hollow mill can reduce the diameter of a part and also perform [[facing]], [[centering]], and [[Chamfer|chamfering]] in a single pass.\n\nHollow mills offer an advantage over single point tooling.  Multiple blades allow the [[Speeds and feeds|feed rate]] to double and can hold a closer concentricity.  The number of blades can be as many as 8 or as few as 3.\u00a0 For significant diameter removal (roughing), more blades are necessary.\n\n[[Trepanning (drilling)|Trepanning]] is also possible with a hollow mill.  Special form blades can be used on a hollow mill for trepanning diameters, forms, and ring grooves.\n\n[[Interpolation (disambiguation)|Interpolation]] is also not necessary when using a hollow mill; this can result in a significant reduction of production time.\n\nBoth convex and concave spherical radii are possible with a hollow mill.  The multiple blades of a hollow mill allow  this radius to be produced while holding a tight tolerance. \n\nA common use of a hollow mill is preparing for threading.\u00a0 The hollow mill can create a consistent pre-thread diameter quickly, improving productivity.\n\nAn adjustable hollow mill is a valuable tool for even a small machine shop to have because the blades can be changed out for an almost infinite number of possible geometries.<br />\n\n===Dovetail cutter===\nA dovetail cutter is an end mill whose form leaves behind a [[dovetail joint|dovetail]] slot, such as often forms the ways of a machine tool.\n\n===Shell mill===\n\n====Modular principle====\n[[File:Face Mill Index 01.png|thumb|A face mill shell. The rectangular cutout area on the back side is the pocket that engages the lugs/tangs of the arbor.]]\nA shell mill is any of various milling cutters (typically a face mill or endmill) whose construction takes a [[modularity|modular]] form, with the shank (arbor) made separately from the body of the cutter, which is called a \"shell\" and attaches to the shank/arbor via any of several standardized joining methods.\n\nThis modular style of construction is appropriate for large milling cutters for about the same reason that large diesel engines use separate pieces for each cylinder and head whereas a smaller engine would use one integrated casting. Two reasons are that (1) for the maker it is more practical (and thus less expensive) to make the individual pieces as separate endeavors than to machine all their features in relation to each other while the whole unit is integrated (which would require a larger machine tool work envelope); and (2) the user can change some pieces while keeping other pieces the same (rather than changing the whole unit). One arbor (at a hypothetical price of USD100) can serve for various shells at different times. Thus 5 different milling cutters may require only USD100 worth of arbor cost, rather than USD500, as long as the workflow of the shop does not require them all to be set up simultaneously. It is also possible that a crashed tool scraps only the shell rather than both the shell and arbor. To also avoid damage to the shell, many cutters, especially in larger diameters, also have another replaceable part called shim, which is mounted to the shell and the inserts are mounted on the shim. That way, in case of light damage, only the insert and maximum the shim needs replacement. The shell is safe. This would be like crashing a \"regular\" endmill and being able to reuse the shank rather than losing it along with the flutes.\n\nMost shell mills made today use indexable inserts for the cutting edges\u2014thus shank, body, and cutting edges are all modular components.\n\n====Mounting methods====\nThere are several common standardized methods of mounting shell mills to their arbors. They overlap somewhat (not entirely) with the analogous [[Chuck (engineering)#Mounting methods|joining of lathe chucks to the spindle nose]].\n\nThe most common type of joint between shell and arbor involves a fairly large cylindrical feature at center (to locate the shell concentric to the arbor) and two driving lugs or tangs that drive the shell with a positive engagement (like a [[dog clutch]]). Within the central cylindrical area, one or several socket head cap screws fasten the shell to the arbor.\n\nAnother type of shell fastening is simply a large-diameter fine thread. The shell then screws onto the arbor just as old-style lathe chuck backplates screw onto the lathe's spindle nose. This method is commonly used on the 2\" or 3\" boring heads used on knee mills. As with the threaded-spindle-nose lathe chucks, this style of mounting requires that the cutter only take cuts in one rotary direction. Usually (i.e., with right-hand helix orientation) this means only [[G-code#M03|M03]], never [[G-code#M04|M04]], or in pre-CNC terminology, \"only forward, never reverse\". One could use a left-hand thread if one needed a mode of use involving the opposite directions (i.e., only M04, never M03).\n\n==Using a milling cutter==\n\n=== Chip formation ===\nAlthough there are many different types of milling cutter, understanding chip formation is fundamental to the use of any of them.\nAs the milling cutter rotates, the material to be cut is fed into it, and each tooth of the cutter cuts away a small chip of material. Achieving the correct size of chip is of critical importance. The size of this chip depends on several variables.\n\n;Surface cutting speed (V<sub>c</sub>): This is the speed at which each tooth cuts through the material as the tool spins. This is measured either in metres per minute in metric countries, or surface feet per minute (SFM) in America. Typical values for cutting speed are 10m/min to 60m/min for some steels, and 100m/min and 600m/min for aluminum. This should not be confused with the feed rate.  This value is also known as \"tangential velocity.\"\n;Spindle speed (S): This is the rotation speed of the tool, and is measured in revolutions per minute (rpm). Typical values are from hundreds of rpm, up to tens of thousands of rpm.\n;Diameter of the tool (D):\n;Number of teeth (z):\n;Feed per tooth (F<sub>z</sub>): This is the distance the material is fed into the cutter as each tooth rotates. This value is the size of the deepest cut the tooth will make.Typical values could be 0.1mm/tooth or 1 mm/tooth\n;Feed rate (F): This is the speed at which the material is fed into the cutter. Typical values are from 20mm/min to 5000mm/min.\n;Depth of cut: This is how deep the tool is under the surface of the material being cut (not shown on the diagram). This will be the height of the chip produced. Typically, the depth of cut will be less than or equal to the diameter of the cutting tool.\n\nThe machinist needs three values: '''S''', '''F''' and '''Depth''' when deciding how to cut a new material with a new tool. However, he will probably be given values of '''V<sub>c</sub>''' and '''F<sub>z</sub>''' from the tool manufacturer. '''S''' and '''F''' can be calculated from them:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:50%\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n! Spindle Speed\n! Feed rate\n|- align=\"center\"\n| <math>S = \\frac {V_c}{\\pi D} \\, </math> || style=\"width:50%\" | <math>F = zSF_z \\, </math>\n|-\n| Looking at the formula for the spindle speed, S, it can be seen that larger tools require lower spindle speeds, while small tools may be able to go at high speeds.\n| The formula for the feed rate, F shows that increasing S or z gives a higher feed rate. Therefore, machinists may choose a tool with the highest number of teeth that can still cope with the swarf load.\n|}\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Conventional milling versus climb milling ===<!-- [[Climb milling]] links here -->\n[[Image:Conventional Milling 01.png|thumb|left|275px|Conventional milling. Point '''A''' may become work hardened.]]\n[[Image:Climb Milling 01.png|thumb|300px|right|Chip formation during climb milling.]]\n\nA milling cutter can cut in two directions, sometimes known as ''conventional'' or ''up'' and ''climb'' or ''down''.\n\n* '''Conventional milling (left):''' The chip thickness starts at zero thickness, and increases up to the maximum. The cut is so light at the beginning that the tool does not cut, but slides across the surface of the material, until sufficient [[pressure]] is built up and the tooth suddenly bites and begins to cut. This deforms the material (at point A on the diagram, left), [[work hardening|hardening]] it, and dulling the tool. The sliding and biting behaviour leaves a poor finish on the material.\n* '''Climb milling (right):''' Each tooth engages the material at a definite point, and the width of the cut starts at the maximum and decreases to zero. The chips are disposed behind the cutter, leading to easier swarf removal. The tooth does not rub on the material, and so tool life may be longer. However, climb milling can apply larger loads to the machine, and so is not recommended for older milling machines, or machines which are not in good condition. This type of milling is used predominantly on mills with a [[backlash (engineering)|backlash]] eliminator.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Cutter location (cutter radius compensation)===\n[[Cutter location]] is the topic of where to locate the cutter in order to achieve the desired contour (geometry) of the workpiece, given that the cutter's size is non-zero. The most common example is cutter radius compensation (CRC) for [[endmill]]s, where the centerline of the tool will be offset from the target position by a [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] whose ''distance'' is equal to the cutter's radius and whose ''direction'' is governed by the [[#Conventional milling versus climb milling|left/right, climb/conventional, up/down distinction]]. In most implementations of [[G-code]], it is [[G-code#G40|G40 through G42]] that control CRC (G40 cancel, G41 left/climb, G42 right/conventional). The radius values for each tool are entered into the offset register(s) by the CNC operator or machinist, who then tweaks them during production in order to keep the finished sizes within [[engineering tolerance|tolerance]]. Cutter location for 3D contouring in 3-, 4-, or 5-axis milling with a ball-endmill is handled readily by [[computer-aided manufacturing|CAM]] software rather than manual programming. Typically the CAM vector output is postprocessed into G-code by a postprocessor program that is tailored to the particular CNC control model. Some late-model CNC controls accept the vector output directly, and do the translation to servo inputs themselves, internally.\n\n===Swarf removal===\nAnother important quality of the milling cutter to consider is its ability to deal with the [[swarf]] generated by the cutting process. If the swarf is not removed as fast as it is produced, the flutes will clog and prevent the tool cutting efficiently, causing vibration, tool wear and overheating. Several factors affect swarf removal, including the depth and angle of the flutes, the size and shape of the chips, the flow of coolant, and the surrounding material. It may be difficult to predict, but a good machinist will watch out for swarf build up, and adjust the milling conditions if it is observed.\n\n==Selecting a milling cutter==\nSelecting a milling cutter is not a simple task. There are many variables, opinions and lore to consider, but essentially the machinist is trying to choose a tool which will cut the material to the required specification for the least cost. The cost of the job is a combination of the price of the tool, the time taken by the milling machine, and the time taken by the machinist. Often, for jobs of a large number of parts, and days of machining time, the cost of the tool is lowest of the three costs.\n\n* '''Material:''' [[High speed steel]] (HSS) cutters are the least-expensive and shortest-lived cutters. Cobalt-bearing high speed steels generally can be run 10% [[Speeds and feeds|faster]] than regular high speed steel. [[Cemented carbide]] tools are more expensive than steel, but last longer, and can be run much faster, so prove more economical in the long run.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} HSS tools are perfectly adequate for many applications. The progression from regular HSS to cobalt HSS to carbide could be viewed as very good, even better, and the best. Using high speed spindles may preclude use of HSS entirely.\n* '''Diameter:''' Larger tools can remove material faster than small ones, therefore the largest possible cutter that will fit in the job is usually chosen. When milling an internal contour, or concave external contours, the diameter is limited by the size of internal curves. The radius of the cutter must be less than or equal to the radius of the smallest arc.\n* '''Flutes:''' More flutes allows a higher feed rate, because there is less material removed per flute. But because the core diameter increases, there is less room for swarf, so a balance must be chosen.\n* '''Coating:''' Coatings, such as [[titanium nitride]], also increase initial cost but reduce wear and increase tool life. TiAlN coating reduces sticking of aluminium to the tool, reducing and sometimes eliminating need for lubrication.\n* '''Helix angle:''' High [[helix angle]]s are typically best for soft metals, and low helix angles for hard or tough metals.\n\n==History==\nThe history of milling cutters is intimately bound up with [[Milling machine#History|that of milling machines]].  Milling evolved from rotary filing, so there is a continuum of development between the earliest milling cutters known, such as that of [[Jacques de Vaucanson]] from about the 1760s or 1770s,<ref name=\"Woodbury1972p23\">{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1972|p=23}}.</ref><ref name=\"Roe1916p206\">{{Harvnb|Roe|1916|p=206}}.</ref> through the cutters of the milling pioneers of the 1810s through 1850s ([[Eli Whitney, Jr.|Whitney]], [[Simeon North|North]], Johnson, [[James Nasmyth|Nasmyth]], and others),<ref name=\"Woodbury1972pp51-52\">{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1972|pp=51\u201352}}.</ref> to the cutters developed by Joseph R.

De Vries (1910)<ref name=\"DeVries1910p15\" /> reported, \"This revolution in the science of milling cutters took place in the States about the year 1870, and became generally known in Europe during the [[Weltausstellung 1873 Wien|Exhibition in Vienna in 1873]]. However strange it may seem now that this type of cutter has been universally adopted and its undeniable superiority to the old European type is no longer doubted, it was regarded very distrustfully and European experts were very reserved in expressing their judgment. Even we ourselves can remember that after the coarse pitched cutter had been introduced, certain very clever and otherwise shrewd experts and engineers regarded the new cutting tool with many a shake of the head. When[,] however, the [[Centennial Exposition|Worlds Exhibition at Philadelphia in 1876]], exhibited to European experts a universal and many-sided application of the coarse pitched milling cutter which exceeded even the most sanguine expectations, the most far-seeing engineers were then convinced of the immense advantages which the application of the new type opened up for the metalworking industry, and from that time onwards the American type advanced, slowly at first, but later on with rapid strides\".<ref name=\"DeVries1910p15-16\">{{Harvnb|De Vries|1910|pp=15\u201316}}.</ref>\n\nWoodbury provides citations<ref name=\"Woodbury1972p54\">{{Harvnb|Woodbury|1972|p=54}}.</ref> of patents for various advances in milling cutter design, including irregular spacing of teeth (1867), forms of inserted teeth (1872), spiral groove for breaking up the cut (1881), and others.

As a result, his publisher hired ghostwriters to write novels in the Clancy style.]]\n\nA '''ghostwriter''' is hired to write [[literature|literary]] or [[journalism|journalistic]] works, [[Public speaking|speeches]], or other texts that are officially credited to another person as the [[author]]. Celebrities, executives, participants in timely news stories, and political leaders often hire ghostwriters to draft or edit [[autobiography|autobiographies]], [[memoir]]s, magazine articles, or other written material. In music, ghostwriters are often used to write songs, lyrics, and instrumental pieces. Screenplay authors can also use ghostwriters to either [[script doctor|edit or rewrite their scripts]] to improve them.\n\nUsually, there is a confidentiality clause in the contract between the ghostwriter and the credited author that obligates the former to remain anonymous. Sometimes the ghostwriter is acknowledged by the author or publisher for his or her writing services, euphemistically called a \"researcher\" or \"research assistant\", but often the ghostwriter is not credited.\n\nGhostwriting (or simply \"ghosting\") also occurs in other creative fields. Composers have long hired ghostwriters to help them to write musical pieces and songs; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] is an example of a well-known composer who was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons. Ghosting also occurs in [[popular music]]. A pop music ghostwriter writes lyrics and a melody in the style of the credited musician. In [[hip hop]] music, the increasing use of ghostwriters by high-profile hip-hop stars has led to controversy.<ref name=\"bbc.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28551924|title=The secret ghostwriters of Hip Hop|work=BBC News}}</ref> In the visual arts, it is not uncommon in either [[fine art]] or commercial art such as [[comics]] for a number of assistants to do work on a piece that is credited to a single artist; [[Andy Warhol]] engaged in this practice, supervising an [[assembly line]] [[silk screen]] process for his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/warhol/story/0,11478,648898,00.html |title=My 15 minutes | work=[[The Guardian (newspaper)|The Guardian]]|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref> However, when credit is established for the writer, the acknowledgement of their contribution is public domain and the writer in question would not be considered a ghostwriter.\n\n==Overview==\n\nA consultant or career-switcher may pay a ghostwriter to write a book on a topic in their professional area, to establish or enhance credibility as an 'expert' in their field. Public officials and [[politicians]] employ \"correspondence officers\" to respond to the large volume of official [[communication|correspondence]]. A number of papal [[encyclical]]s have been written by ghostwriters. A controversial and scientifically unethical practice is medical ghostwriting, where biotech or pharmaceutical companies pay professional writers to produce papers and then recruit (via payment or as a perk) other scientists or physicians to attach their names to these articles before they are published in medical or scientific journals. Some university and college students hire ghostwriters from [[essay mill]]s to write entrance essays, term papers, theses, and dissertations. This is largely considered unethical unless the actual ghostwriting work is just light editing.\n\nGhostwriters are hired for numerous reasons. In many cases, celebrities or public figures do not have the time, discipline, or writing skills to write and research a several hundred page autobiography or \"how-to\" book. Even if a celebrity or public figure has the writing skills to pen a short article, they may not know how to structure and edit a several hundred page book so that it is captivating and well-paced. In other cases, publishers use ghostwriters to increase the number of books that can be published each year under the name of well-known, highly marketable authors, or to quickly release a topical book that ties in with a recent or upcoming newsworthy event.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Quien no corre, vuela|url = http://www.zoomnews.es/40446/letras-y-tretas/quien-no-corre-vuela|website = ZoomNews|accessdate = 2015-11-14|language = es-ES|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015909/http://www.zoomnews.es/40446/letras-y-tretas/quien-no-corre-vuela|archivedate = 2015-11-17}}</ref>\n\n==Remuneration and credit==\n[[File:Hrcraad.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The ghostwriter for [[Hillary Clinton]]'s memoirs received a $500,000 fee for collaborating with her.]]\n\nGhostwriters will often spend from several months to a full year researching, writing, and editing [[nonfiction]] and [[fiction]] works for a client, and they are paid based on a price per hour, per word or per page, with a flat fee, a percentage of the royalties of the sales, or some combination thereof. [[Literary agent]] Madeleine Morel states that the average ghostwriter's advance for work for major book publishers is \"between $15,000 and $75,000\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bookwritinginc.com/blog/what-is-ghostwriting-complete-guide-ghostwriting/ |title=What is Ghostwriting?

One such market is the shorter book, best represented at the moment by Amazon's Kindle Singles imprint: texts of 30,000 words and under.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/sep/05/amazon-kindle-singles-short|title=The big short \u2013 why Amazon's Kindle Singles are the future|author=Julian Gough|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Such a length would have been much harder to sell before digital reader-technologies became widely available, but is now quite acceptable.

Manhattan Literary, a ghostwriting company, states that \"book projects on the shorter side, tailored to new markets like the Kindle Singles imprint and others (30,000\u201342,000 words) start at a cost of $15,000\".<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/who-wrote-that-political-memoir-no-who-actually-wrote-it/2014/06/09/8e89ccae-f00a-11e3-9ebc-2ee6f81ed217_story.html|title=Who wrote that political memoir?

It was once financially impractical for publishers to produce such novella-length texts (they would have to charge too much); but this new market is, by 2015, already substantial and has been projected to be a solid part of the future of book publishing.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/> So, with its appearance the starting price for the professional book writer has come down by about half, but only if this shorter format makes sense for the client.\n\nOn the upper end of the spectrum, with celebrities that can all but guarantee a publisher large sales, the fees can be much higher. In 2001, the ''[[New York Times]]'' stated that the fee that the ghostwriter for [[Hillary Clinton]]'s memoirs would receive was probably about $500,000 of her book's $8 million advance, which \"is near the top of flat fees paid to collaborators\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E3DF153AF93BA35752C0A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | first=David D. | last=Kirkpatrick | title=Media Talk; Mrs.Clinton Seeks Ghostwriter for Memoirs | date=8 January 2001}}</ref>\n\nThere is also the consideration of different benchmarks in different countries. In Canada, The Writers' Union has established a minimum fee schedule for ghostwriting, starting at $40,000 for a 200 to 300 page book, paid at various stages of the drafting of the book. Research fees are an extra charge on top of this minimum fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.writersunion.ca/content/ghost-writing|title=Ghost Writing|work=writersunion.ca|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801172621/http://www.writersunion.ca/content/ghost-writing|archivedate=2012-08-01}}</ref>\n\nA recent availability also exists, of outsourcing many kinds of jobs, including ghostwriting, to [[Offshoring|offshore]] locations like India, China, and the Philippines where the customer can save money.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-19476254|title=The globalisation of work - and people|work=BBC News}}</ref> The true tests of credibility\u2014the writer's track record, and samples of his or her craft\u2014become even more important in these instances, when the writer comes from a culture and first language that are entirely different from the client's.\n\nIn some cases, ghostwriters are allowed to share credit. For example, a common method is to put the client/author's name on a book cover as the main byline (by ''Author's Name'') and then to put the ghostwriter's name underneath it (as told to ''Ghostwriter's Name''). Sometimes this is done in lieu of pay or in order to decrease the amount of payment to the book ghostwriter for whom the credit has its own intrinsic value. Also, the ghostwriter can be cited as a co-author of a book, or listed in the movie or film credits when having ghostwritten the script or screenplay for film production.\n\nFor nonfiction books, the ghostwriter may be credited as a \"contributor\" or a \"research assistant\". In other cases, the ghostwriter receives no official credit for writing a book or article; in cases where the credited author or the [[publisher]] or both wish to conceal the ghostwriter's role, the ghostwriter may be asked to sign a [[nondisclosure contract]] that legally forbids any mention of the writer's role in a project. Some have made the distinction between \"author\" and \"writer\", as ghostwriter Kevin Anderson explains in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' interview: \"A ghostwriter is an interpreter and a translator, not an author, which is why our clients deserve full credit for authoring their books.\"<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Nonfiction===\nGhostwriters are widely used by celebrities and public figures who wish to publish their autobiographies or memoirs. The degree of involvement of the ghostwriter in nonfiction writing projects ranges from minor to substantial. Various sources explain the role of the ghostwriter and how competent writers can get this kind of work. In some cases, a ghostwriter may be called in just to clean up, edit, and polish a rough draft of an autobiography or a \"how-to\" book. In other cases, the ghostwriter will write an entire book or article based on information, stories, notes, an outline, or interview sessions with the celebrity or public figure. The credited author also indicates to the ghostwriter what type of style, tone, or \"voice\" they want in the book.\n\nIn some cases, such as with some \"how-to\" books, diet guides, or cookbooks, a book will be entirely written by a ghostwriter, and the celebrity (e.g., a well-known musician or sports star) will be credited as author. Publishing companies use this strategy to increase the marketability of a book by associating it with a celebrity or well-known figure. In several countries before elections, candidates commission ghostwriters to produce autobiographies for them so as to gain visibility and exposure. Two of [[John F.

For example, a successful salesperson hoping to become a motivational speaker on selling may pay a ghostwriter to write a book on sales techniques. Often this type of book is published by a [[self-publishing press]] (or \"[[vanity press]]\"), which means that the author is paying to have the book published. This type of book is typically given away to prospective clients as a promotional tool, rather than being sold in bookstores.\n\n===Fiction===\nGhostwriters are employed by fiction publishers for several reasons. In some cases, publishers use ghostwriters to increase the number of books that can be published each year by a well-known, highly marketable author. Ghostwriters are mostly used to pen fiction works for well-known \"name\" authors in genres such as detective fiction, mysteries, and teen fiction.\n\nAdditionally, publishers use ghostwriters to write new books for established series where the \"author\" is a [[pseudonym]]. For example, the purported authors of the [[Nancy Drew]] and [[Hardy Boys]] mysteries, \"[[Carolyn Keene]]\" and \"[[Franklin W. Dixon]]\", respectively, are actually pseudonyms for a series of ghostwriters who write books in the same style using a template of basic information about the book's characters and their fictional universe (names, dates, speech patterns), and about the tone and style that are expected in the book (for more information, see the articles on pseudonyms or [[pen name]]<nowiki/>s). In addition, ghostwriters are often given copies of several of the previous books in the series to help them match the style.\n\nThe estate of romance novelist [[V. C. Andrews]] hired ghostwriter [[Andrew Neiderman]] to continue writing novels after her death, under her name and in a similar style to her original works. Many of action writer [[Tom Clancy]]'s books from the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] bear the names of two people on their covers, with Clancy's name in larger print and the other author's name in smaller print. Various books bearing Clancy's name were written by different authors under the same pseudonym. The first two books in the ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell]]'' franchise were written by [[Raymond Benson]] under the pseudonym [[David Michaels (author)|David Michaels]].\n\nSometimes famous authors will ghostwrite for other celebrities as well, such as when [[H. P. Lovecraft]] ghostwrote \"Imprisoned with the Pharaohs\" (also known as \"Under the Pyramids\") for [[Harry Houdini]] in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n===Religious===\nA number of papal [[encyclical]]s have been written by ghostwriters.

Nonetheless, the style, tone and content is modeled on that of the credited author. Many website ghostwriters are [[freelance]] but some are [[freelancer]]s who work under [[employment contract|contract]], as with [[radio presenter]]s and [[television presenter]]s. Occasionally [[Pseudonym#Literary pen names|a \"house pseudonym\", or collective name]] is used by the author of the website.\n\nSome celebrities, [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]], or public figures set up blog websites\u2014sometimes as a marketing, public relations, or lobbying tool. However, since these individuals are typically too busy to write their blog posts, they hire discreet ghostwriters to post to the blog under the celebrity or CEO's name. As with nonfiction ghostwriting, the blog ghostwriter models their writing style, content and tone on that of the credited author. This goes for social media as well. Many public figures have ghostwriters at least partially handle their [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] accounts, among others.<ref name=\"PC World\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2048479/whos-actually-writing-your-favorite-celebritys-tweets-.html|title=Who's actually writing your favorite celebrity's tweets?|author=Evan Dashevsky|date=16 December 2013|work=PC World}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n\n====Classical music and film scores====\n[[File:Martini bologna mozart 1777.jpg|thumb|upright|The Classical era composer [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons who wished to give the impression that they were gifted composers.]]\n[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] is an example of a well-known composer who was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons. More recently, composers such as the UK-based Patric Standford (born in 1939) have ghostwritten for symphonic recordings and films such as the Rod McKuen Cello Concerto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.impulse-music.co.uk/standford.htm|title=Patric Standford|work=impulse-music.co.uk}}</ref> In the film industry, a music ghostwriter is a \"person who composes music for another composer but is not credited on the cue sheet or in the final product in any way.\" The practice is considered one of the \"dirty little secrets of the film and television music business\" that is considered unethical,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicmag.com/kb/glossary.php|title=Film & TV Music Knowledgebase :: Glossary of Film and TV Music Terms|work=filmmusicmag.com}}</ref> but has been common since the early stages of the film industry. In the early years of film, [[David Raksin]] worked as music ghostwriter and [[Orchestration|orchestrator]] for [[Charlie Chaplin]]; even though Chaplin was credited as the score writer, he was considered to be a \"hummer\" (pejorative film industry slang for a person who purports to be a film score composer but who in fact only gives a general idea of the melodies to a ghostwriter).\n\nThe practice is also common in television, as composers listed on cue sheets are entitled to music royalties every time an episode or theme score appears on television. A 1998 investigation by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' revealed that it was especially prevalent among animation companies such as [[Saban Entertainment]], [[DiC Entertainment|DiC]], [[Ruby-Spears Productions]] and [[Hanna-Barbera]], which often listed company executives as musicians for the purpose of royalties.<ref>\"Composers say they're paupers in royalty game\" - ''The Hollywood Reporter'' (1998)</ref> Several composers later filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Saban Entertainment president [[Haim Saban]], for allegedly taking ownership and credit for their musical compositions.\n\n====Popular music====\nMusical ghostwriting also occurs in [[popular music]]. When a record company wants to market an inexperienced young singer as a [[singer-songwriter]], or help a veteran bandleader coping with writer's block (or a lack of motivation to finish the next album), an experienced songwriter may be discreetly brought in to help.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In other cases, a ghostwriter writes lyrics and a melody in the style of the credited musician, with little or no input from the credited musician. A ghostwriter providing this type of service may be thanked, without reference to the service provided, in the album credits, or they may be a true 'ghost', with no acknowledgement in the album.\n\nLegal disputes have arisen when musical ghostwriters have tried to claim royalties when an allegedly ghostwritten song becomes a money-making hit. In 1987, Darryl Neudorf was asked to work on a project for [[Nettwerk Productions]] involving a newly signed artist in their repertoire named [[Sarah McLachlan]]. This recording, the album ''[[Touch (Sarah McLachlan album)|Touch]]'', resulted in garnering the interest of [[Arista Records]]. She signed a multi-album contract with them and two of the songs that Neudorf worked on with her became commercial hits in [[Canada]]. In 1991, Neudorf was invited back to work with McLachlan on her second album, ''[[Solace (Sarah McLachlan album)|Solace]]''. In 1993, he filed a lawsuit against McLachlan and her label, [[Nettwerk]], alleging that he had made a significant and uncredited contribution to the songwriting on ''Touch'', and alleging that he wasn't paid properly for work done on ''Solace''. The judge in this suit eventually ruled in McLachlan's favour on the songs; though Neudorf may have contributed to the [[songwriting]], neither regarded each other as joint authors. The judge ruled in Neudorf's favour on the payment issue.\n\n[[File: Chuck D.

[[Frank Ocean]] started his career as a ghostwriter for artists such as [[Justin Bieber]], [[John Legend]] and [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]].\n\nCurrently in hip-hop, the credit given to ghostwriters varies: \"silent pens might sign confidentiality clauses, appear obliquely in the liner notes, or discuss their participation freely.\" In some cases, liner notes credit individuals for \"vocal arrangement\", which may be a euphemism for ghostwriting. In the early 2010s, hip-hop ghostwriting services like [[Rap Rebirth]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/07/03/137559845/no-flow-rap-rebirth-can-help|title=Stamberg Raps! And Other Tales From A Hip-Hop Ghostwriter|date=2 July 2011|work=NPR.org}}</ref> have appeared online, which provide recording artists who wish to purchase ghostwritten rhymes a greater degree of anonymity.\n\n===Visual art===\nGhost-authorship also applies to the visual arts, most commonly paintings. The extent of the master artist's contribution varies widely, as little as composition adjustments and corrective brush strokes, or as much as entire works. A common practice is the use of art instruction class milieu in which the master artist makes significant contributions to the work of the student who then signs that work as his or her own. Services addressing complete works have historically been highly confidential. Less prevalent are advertised commercial services which may use the term \"vanity artwork\" as suggestive of \"vanity publishing\".\n{{Clear}}\n\n===As blacklisting countermeasure===\nIn countries where the freedom of speech is not upheld and authors that have somehow displeased the ruling regime are \"blacklisted\" (i.e. forbidden from having their works published), the blacklisted authors or composers may ghostwrite material for other authors or composers who are in the good graces of the regime.

Celebrities, executives, participants in timely news stories, and political leaders often hire ghostwriters to draft or edit [[autobiography|autobiographies]], [[memoir]]s, magazine articles, or other written material. In music, ghostwriters are often used to write songs, lyrics, and instrumental pieces. Screenplay authors can also use ghostwriters to either [[script doctor|edit or rewrite their scripts]] to improve them.\n\nUsually, there is a confidentiality clause in the contract between the ghostwriter and the credited author that obligates the former to remain anonymous. Sometimes the ghostwriter is acknowledged by the author or publisher for his or her writing services, euphemistically called a \"researcher\" or \"research assistant\", but often the ghostwriter is not credited.\n\nGhostwriting (or simply \"ghosting\") also occurs in other creative fields. Composers have long hired ghostwriters to help them to write musical pieces and songs; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] is an example of a well-known composer who was paid to ghostwrite music for wealthy patrons. Ghosting also occurs in [[popular music]]. A pop music ghostwriter writes lyrics and a melody in the style of the credited musician. In [[hip hop]] music, the increasing use of ghostwriters by high-profile hip-hop stars has led to controversy.<ref name=\"bbc.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28551924|title=The secret ghostwriters of Hip Hop|work=BBC News}}</ref> In the visual arts, it is not uncommon in either [[fine art]] or commercial art such as [[comics]] for a number of assistants to do work on a piece that is credited to a single artist; [[Andy Warhol]] engaged in this practice, supervising an [[assembly line]] [[silk screen]] process for his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/warhol/story/0,11478,648898,00.html |title=My 15 minutes | work=[[The Guardian (newspaper)|The Guardian]]|accessdate=October 5, 2014}}</ref> However, when credit is established for the writer, the acknowledgement of their contribution is public domain and the writer in question would not be considered a ghostwriter.\n\n==Overview==\n\nA consultant or career-switcher may pay a ghostwriter to write a book on a topic in their professional area, to establish or enhance credibility as an 'expert' in their field. Public officials and [[politicians]] employ \"correspondence officers\" to respond to the large volume of official [[communication|correspondence]]. A number of papal [[encyclical]]s have been written by ghostwriters. A controversial and scientifically unethical practice is medical ghostwriting, where biotech or pharmaceutical companies pay professional writers to produce papers and then recruit (via payment or as a perk) other scientists or physicians to attach their names to these articles before they are published in medical or scientific journals. Some university and college students hire ghostwriters from [[essay mill]]s to write entrance essays, term papers, theses, and dissertations. This is largely considered unethical unless the actual ghostwriting work is just light editing.\n\nGhostwriters are hired for numerous reasons. In many cases, celebrities or public figures do not have the time, discipline, or writing skills to write and research a several hundred page autobiography or \"how-to\" book. Even if a celebrity or public figure has the writing skills to pen a short article, they may not know how to structure and edit a several hundred page book so that it is captivating and well-paced. In other cases, publishers use ghostwriters to increase the number of books that can be published each year under the name of well-known, highly marketable authors, or to quickly release a topical book that ties in with a recent or upcoming newsworthy event.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Quien no corre, vuela|url = http://www.zoomnews.es/40446/letras-y-tretas/quien-no-corre-vuela|website = ZoomNews|accessdate = 2015-11-14|language = es-ES|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117015909/http://www.zoomnews.es/40446/letras-y-tretas/quien-no-corre-vuela|archivedate = 2015-11-17}}</ref>\n\n==Remuneration and credit==\n[[File:Hrcraad.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The ghostwriter for [[Hillary Clinton]]'s memoirs received a $500,000 fee for collaborating with her.]]\n\nGhostwriters will often spend from several months to a full year researching, writing, and editing [[nonfiction]] and [[fiction]] works for a client, and they are paid based on a price per hour, per word or per page, with a flat fee, a percentage of the royalties of the sales, or some combination thereof.

One such market is the shorter book, best represented at the moment by Amazon's Kindle Singles imprint: texts of 30,000 words and under.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2013/sep/05/amazon-kindle-singles-short|title=The big short \u2013 why Amazon's Kindle Singles are the future|author=Julian Gough|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Such a length would have been much harder to sell before digital reader-technologies became widely available, but is now quite acceptable.

Manhattan Literary, a ghostwriting company, states that \"book projects on the shorter side, tailored to new markets like the Kindle Singles imprint and others (30,000\u201342,000 words) start at a cost of $15,000\".<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/who-wrote-that-political-memoir-no-who-actually-wrote-it/2014/06/09/8e89ccae-f00a-11e3-9ebc-2ee6f81ed217_story.html|title=Who wrote that political memoir?

It was once financially impractical for publishers to produce such novella-length texts (they would have to charge too much); but this new market is, by 2015, already substantial and has been projected to be a solid part of the future of book publishing.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\"/> So, with its appearance the starting price for the professional book writer has come down by about half, but only if this shorter format makes sense for the client.\n\nOn the upper end of the spectrum, with celebrities that can all but guarantee a publisher large sales, the fees can be much higher. In 2001, the ''[[New York Times]]'' stated that the fee that the ghostwriter for [[Hillary Clinton]]'s memoirs would receive was probably about $500,000 of her book's $8 million advance, which \"is near the top of flat fees paid to collaborators\".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E3DF153AF93BA35752C0A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | first=David D. | last=Kirkpatrick | title=Media Talk; Mrs.Clinton Seeks Ghostwriter for Memoirs | date=8 January 2001}}</ref>\n\nThere is also the consideration of different benchmarks in different countries. In Canada, The Writers' Union has established a minimum fee schedule for ghostwriting, starting at $40,000 for a 200 to 300 page book, paid at various stages of the drafting of the book. Research fees are an extra charge on top of this minimum fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.writersunion.ca/content/ghost-writing|title=Ghost Writing|work=writersunion.ca|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801172621/http://www.writersunion.ca/content/ghost-writing|archivedate=2012-08-01}}</ref>\n\nA recent availability also exists, of outsourcing many kinds of jobs, including ghostwriting, to [[Offshoring|offshore]] locations like India, China, and the Philippines where the customer can save money.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-19476254|title=The globalisation of work - and people|work=BBC News}}</ref> The true tests of credibility\u2014the writer's track record, and samples of his or her craft\u2014become even more important in these instances, when the writer comes from a culture and first language that are entirely different from the client's.\n\nIn some cases, ghostwriters are allowed to share credit. For example, a common method is to put the client/author's name on a book cover as the main byline (by ''Author's Name'') and then to put the ghostwriter's name underneath it (as told to ''Ghostwriter's Name''). Sometimes this is done in lieu of pay or in order to decrease the amount of payment to the book ghostwriter for whom the credit has its own intrinsic value. Also, the ghostwriter can be cited as a co-author of a book, or listed in the movie or film credits when having ghostwritten the script or screenplay for film production.\n\nFor nonfiction books, the ghostwriter may be credited as a \"contributor\" or a \"research assistant\". In other cases, the ghostwriter receives no official credit for writing a book or article; in cases where the credited author or the [[publisher]] or both wish to conceal the ghostwriter's role, the ghostwriter may be asked to sign a [[nondisclosure contract]] that legally forbids any mention of the writer's role in a project. Some have made the distinction between \"author\" and \"writer\", as ghostwriter Kevin Anderson explains in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' interview: \"A ghostwriter is an interpreter and a translator, not an author, which is why our clients deserve full credit for authoring their books.\"<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/>\n\n==Types==\n\n===Nonfiction===\nGhostwriters are widely used by celebrities and public figures who wish to publish their autobiographies or memoirs. The degree of involvement of the ghostwriter in nonfiction writing projects ranges from minor to substantial. Various sources explain the role of the ghostwriter and how competent writers can get this kind of work. In some cases, a ghostwriter may be called in just to clean up, edit, and polish a rough draft of an autobiography or a \"how-to\" book. In other cases, the ghostwriter will write an entire book or article based on information, stories, notes, an outline, or interview sessions with the celebrity or public figure. The credited author also indicates to the ghostwriter what type of style, tone, or \"voice\" they want in the book.\n\nIn some cases, such as with some \"how-to\" books, diet guides, or cookbooks, a book will be entirely written by a ghostwriter, and the celebrity (e.g., a well-known musician or sports star) will be credited as author. Publishing companies use this strategy to increase the marketability of a book by associating it with a celebrity or well-known figure. In several countries before elections, candidates commission ghostwriters to produce autobiographies for them so as to gain visibility and exposure. Two of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s books are almost entirely credited to ghostwriters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2478/did-john-f-kennedy-really-write-profiles-in-courage|title=The Straight Dope: Did John F.

For example, a successful salesperson hoping to become a motivational speaker on selling may pay a ghostwriter to write a book on sales techniques. Often this type of book is published by a [[self-publishing press]] (or \"[[vanity press]]\"), which means that the author is paying to have the book published. This type of book is typically given away to prospective clients as a promotional tool, rather than being sold in bookstores.\n\n===Fiction===\nGhostwriters are employed by fiction publishers for several reasons. In some cases, publishers use ghostwriters to increase the number of books that can be published each year by a well-known, highly marketable author. Ghostwriters are mostly used to pen fiction works for well-known \"name\" authors in genres such as detective fiction, mysteries, and teen fiction.\n\nAdditionally, publishers use ghostwriters to write new books for established series where the \"author\" is a [[pseudonym]]. For example, the purported authors of the [[Nancy Drew]] and [[Hardy Boys]] mysteries, \"[[Carolyn Keene]]\" and \"[[Franklin W. Dixon]]\", respectively, are actually pseudonyms for a series of ghostwriters who write books in the same style using a template of basic information about the book's characters and their fictional universe (names, dates, speech patterns), and about the tone and style that are expected in the book (for more information, see the articles on pseudonyms or [[pen name]]<nowiki/>s). In addition, ghostwriters are often given copies of several of the previous books in the series to help them match the style.\n\nThe estate of romance novelist [[V. C. Andrews]] hired ghostwriter [[Andrew Neiderman]] to continue writing novels after her death, under her name and in a similar style to her original works. Many of action writer [[Tom Clancy]]'s books from the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]] bear the names of two people on their covers, with Clancy's name in larger print and the other author's name in smaller print. Various books bearing Clancy's name were written by different authors under the same pseudonym. The first two books in the ''[[Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell]]'' franchise were written by [[Raymond Benson]] under the pseudonym [[David Michaels (author)|David Michaels]].\n\nSometimes famous authors will ghostwrite for other celebrities as well, such as when [[H. P. Lovecraft]] ghostwrote \"Imprisoned with the Pharaohs\" (also known as \"Under the Pyramids\") for [[Harry Houdini]] in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' in the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n===Religious===\nA number of papal [[encyclical]]s have been written by ghostwriters.

Nonetheless, the style, tone and content is modeled on that of the credited author. Many website ghostwriters are [[freelance]] but some are [[freelancer]]s who work under [[employment contract|contract]], as with [[radio presenter]]s and [[television presenter]]s. Occasionally [[Pseudonym#Literary pen names|a \"house pseudonym\", or collective name]] is used by the author of the website.\n\nSome celebrities, [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]], or public figures set up blog websites\u2014sometimes as a marketing, public relations, or lobbying tool. However, since these individuals are typically too busy to write their blog posts, they hire discreet ghostwriters to post to the blog under the celebrity or CEO's name. As with nonfiction ghostwriting, the blog ghostwriter models their writing style, content and tone on that of the credited author. This goes for social media as well.

More recently, composers such as the UK-based Patric Standford (born in 1939) have ghostwritten for symphonic recordings and films such as the Rod McKuen Cello Concerto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.impulse-music.co.uk/standford.htm|title=Patric Standford|work=impulse-music.co.uk}}</ref> In the film industry, a music ghostwriter is a \"person who composes music for another composer but is not credited on the cue sheet or in the final product in any way.\" The practice is considered one of the \"dirty little secrets of the film and television music business\" that is considered unethical,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmusicmag.com/kb/glossary.php|title=Film & TV Music Knowledgebase :: Glossary of Film and TV Music Terms|work=filmmusicmag.com}}</ref> but has been common since the early stages of the film industry. In the early years of film, [[David Raksin]] worked as music ghostwriter and [[Orchestration|orchestrator]] for [[Charlie Chaplin]]; even though Chaplin was credited as the score writer, he was considered to be a \"hummer\" (pejorative film industry slang for a person who purports to be a film score composer but who in fact only gives a general idea of the melodies to a ghostwriter).\n\nThe practice is also common in television, as composers listed on cue sheets are entitled to music royalties every time an episode or theme score appears on television. A 1998 investigation by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' revealed that it was especially prevalent among animation companies such as [[Saban Entertainment]], [[DiC Entertainment|DiC]], [[Ruby-Spears Productions]] and [[Hanna-Barbera]], which often listed company executives as musicians for the purpose of royalties.<ref>\"Composers say they're paupers in royalty game\" - ''The Hollywood Reporter'' (1998)</ref> Several composers later filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against Saban Entertainment president [[Haim Saban]], for allegedly taking ownership and credit for their musical compositions.\n\n====Popular music====\nMusical ghostwriting also occurs in [[popular music]]. When a record company wants to market an inexperienced young singer as a [[singer-songwriter]], or help a veteran bandleader coping with writer's block (or a lack of motivation to finish the next album), an experienced songwriter may be discreetly brought in to help.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In other cases, a ghostwriter writes lyrics and a melody in the style of the credited musician, with little or no input from the credited musician. A ghostwriter providing this type of service may be thanked, without reference to the service provided, in the album credits, or they may be a true 'ghost', with no acknowledgement in the album.\n\nLegal disputes have arisen when musical ghostwriters have tried to claim royalties when an allegedly ghostwritten song becomes a money-making hit. In 1987, Darryl Neudorf was asked to work on a project for [[Nettwerk Productions]] involving a newly signed artist in their repertoire named [[Sarah McLachlan]]. This recording, the album ''[[Touch (Sarah McLachlan album)|Touch]]'', resulted in garnering the interest of [[Arista Records]]. She signed a multi-album contract with them and two of the songs that Neudorf worked on with her became commercial hits in [[Canada]]. In 1991, Neudorf was invited back to work with McLachlan on her second album, ''[[Solace (Sarah McLachlan album)|Solace]]''. In 1993, he filed a lawsuit against McLachlan and her label, [[Nettwerk]], alleging that he had made a significant and uncredited contribution to the songwriting on ''Touch'', and alleging that he wasn't paid properly for work done on ''Solace''. The judge in this suit eventually ruled in McLachlan's favour on the songs; though Neudorf may have contributed to the [[songwriting]], neither regarded each other as joint authors. The judge ruled in Neudorf's favour on the payment issue.\n\n[[File: Chuck D.

[[Frank Ocean]] started his career as a ghostwriter for artists such as [[Justin Bieber]], [[John Legend]] and [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]].\n\nCurrently in hip-hop, the credit given to ghostwriters varies: \"silent pens might sign confidentiality clauses, appear obliquely in the liner notes, or discuss their participation freely.\" In some cases, liner notes credit individuals for \"vocal arrangement\", which may be a euphemism for ghostwriting. In the early 2010s, hip-hop ghostwriting services like [[Rap Rebirth]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/07/03/137559845/no-flow-rap-rebirth-can-help|title=Stamberg Raps! And Other Tales From A Hip-Hop Ghostwriter|date=2 July 2011|work=NPR.org}}</ref> have appeared online, which provide recording artists who wish to purchase ghostwritten rhymes a greater degree of anonymity.\n\n===Visual art===\nGhost-authorship also applies to the visual arts, most commonly paintings. The extent of the master artist's contribution varies widely, as little as composition adjustments and corrective brush strokes, or as much as entire works. A common practice is the use of art instruction class milieu in which the master artist makes significant contributions to the work of the student who then signs that work as his or her own. Services addressing complete works have historically been highly confidential. Less prevalent are advertised commercial services which may use the term \"vanity artwork\" as suggestive of \"vanity publishing\".\n{{Clear}}\n\n===As blacklisting countermeasure===\nIn countries where the freedom of speech is not upheld and authors that have somehow displeased the ruling regime are \"blacklisted\" (i.e. forbidden from having their works published), the blacklisted authors or composers may ghostwrite material for other authors or composers who are in the good graces of the regime.

Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the [[ash]]es of its predecessor. Some legends say it dies in a show of flames and combustion, others that it simply dies and decomposes before being born again.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA146 146]}} Most accounts say that it lived for 500 years before rebirth.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA67 67&ndash;70]}} [[Herodotus]], [[Lucan]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Pope Clement I]], [[Lactantius]], [[Ovid]], and [[Isidore of Seville]] are among those who have contributed to the retelling and transmission of the phoenix motif. The phoenix symbolized renewal in general, as well as entities and concepts such as the Sun, time, the [[Roman Empire]], [[Christ (title)|Christ]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], and [[virginity]].{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA9 9]}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe modern ''phoenix'' comes from Latin ''phoen\u012bx'' via [[Old English]]. The Latin word comes from Greek {{wiktgrc|\u03c6\u03bf\u1fd6\u03bd\u03b9\u03be}} ''phoin\u012bx''.{{Sfn | Barnhart | 1995 | p = 564}} The Greek word is first attested in the [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''po-ni-ke'', which probably meant '[[griffin]]', though it might have meant 'palm tree'. That word is probably a borrowing from a [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] word for [[madder]], a red dye made from ''[[Rubia tinctorum]]''. The word ''[[Phoenicia|Phoenician]]'' appears to be from the same root, meaning 'those who work with red dyes'. So ''phoenix'' may mean 'the Phoenician bird' or 'the purplish-red bird'.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 62\u201366}}\n\nThe spellings ''ph\u0153nix'' and ''phenix'' are rare nowadays.\n\n==Egyptian origin hypothesis and the ''Bennu''==\nClassical discourse on the subject of the phoenix points to a potential origin of the phoenix in [[Ancient Egypt]]. [[Herodotus]], writing in the 5th century BC, gives a somewhat skeptical account of the phoenix. For example:\n \n{{quote|[The Egyptians] have also another sacred bird called the phoenix which I myself have never seen, except in pictures. Indeed it is a great rarity, even in Egypt, only coming there (according to the accounts of the people of Heliopolis) once in five hundred years, when the old phoenix dies. Its size and appearance, if it is like the pictures, are as follow:\u2013 The plumage is partly red, partly golden, while the general make and size are almost exactly that of the eagle. They tell a story of what this bird does, which does not seem to me to be credible: that he comes all the way from Arabia, and brings the parent bird, all plastered over with myrrh, to the temple of the Sun, and there buries the body. In order to bring him, they say, he first forms a ball of myrrh as big as he finds that he can carry; then he hollows out the ball and puts his parent inside, after which he covers over the opening with fresh myrrh, and the ball is then of exactly the same weight as at first; so he brings it to Egypt, plastered over as I have said, and deposits it in the temple of the Sun. Such is the story they tell of the doings of this bird.<ref>Herodotus, ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories (1858 translation)]]'', [http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.2.ii.html Book II] Trans. G. Rawlinson (1858)</ref>}}\n\nIn the 19th century, scholastic suspicions appeared to be confirmed by the discovery that Egyptians in [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] had venerated the [[Bennu]], a solar bird similar in some respects to the Greek phoenix.  However, the Egyptian sources regarding the bennu are often problematic and open to a variety of interpretations. Some of these sources may have actually been influenced by Greek notions of the phoenix, rather than the other way around.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 14\u201325}}\n\n==Appearance==\nThe phoenix is sometimes pictured in ancient and medieval literature and medieval art as endowed with a [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]], which emphasizes the bird's connection with the Sun.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 233}} In the oldest images of phoenixes on record these nimbuses often have seven rays, like [[Helios]] (the Greek personification of the Sun).{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = 246\u2013247}} Pliny the Elder<ref>''Ancient Magic and the Supernatural in the Modern Visual and Performing Arts'', edited by Filippo Carl\u00e0-Uhink, Irene Berti, 2016, page 172</ref> also describes the bird as having a crest of feathers on its head,<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D10%3Achapter%3D2 10.2]</ref>{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 233}} and [[Ezekiel the Tragedian|Ezekiel the Dramatist]] compared it to a rooster.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 257}}\n\nAlthough the phoenix was generally believed to be colorful and vibrant, sources provide no clear consensus about its coloration. [[Tacitus]] says that its color made it stand out from all other birds.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 253}} Some said that the bird had peacock-like coloring, and [[Herodotus]]'s claim of the Phoenix being red and yellow is popular in many versions of the story on record.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 259}} Ezekiel the Dramatist declared that the phoenix had red legs and striking yellow eyes,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 257}} but [[Lactantius]] said that its eyes were blue like sapphires{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 256}} and that its legs were covered in yellow-gold scales with rose-colored talons.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = 257\u2013258}}\n\nHerodotus, Pliny, [[Solinus]], and [[Philostratus]] describe the phoenix as similar in size to an eagle,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 251}} but Lactantius and Ezekiel the Dramatist both claim that the phoenix was larger, with Lactantius declaring that it was even larger than an ostrich.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 252}}\n\n==In Gnostic texts==\nIdeas taking the phoenix into consideration presented themselves in the [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] manuscript [[On the Origin of the World]] from the [[Nag Hammadi Library]] collection:\n\n{{quote|Thus when [[Eve#Gnosticism|Sophia Zoe]] saw that the rulers of darkness had laid a curse upon her counterparts, she was indignant. And coming out of the first heaven with full power, she chased those rulers out of their heavens and cast them into the sinful world, so that there they should dwell, in the form of evil spirits upon the earth.\n[...], so that in their world it might pass the thousand years in paradise - a soul-endowed living creature called \"phoenix\". It kills itself and brings itself back to life as a witness to the judgement against them, for they did wrong to [[Adam]] and his race, unto the consummation of the age. There are [...] three men, and also his posterities, unto the consummation of the world: the spirit-endowed of eternity, and the soul-endowed, and the earthly. Likewise, there are three phoenixes in paradise - the first is immortal, the second lives 1,000 years; as for the third, it is written in the sacred book that it is consumed. So, too, there are three baptisms - the first is spiritual, the second is by fire, the third is by water. Just as the phoenix appears as a witness concerning the [[angel|angels]], so the case of the water hydri in Egypt, which has been a witness to those going down into the baptism of a true man. The two bulls in Egypt posses a mystery, the Sun and the Moon, being a witness to [[Archon (Gnosticism)#Naming and associations|Sabaoth]]: namely, that over them [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]] received the universe; from the day that she made the Sun and Moon, she put a seal upon her heaven, unto eternity. And the worm that has been born out of the phoenix is a human being as well. It is written concerning it, \"the just man will blossom like a phoenix\". And the phoenix first appears in a living state, and dies, and rises again, being a sign of what has become apparent at the consummation of the age.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[James M.

Some of these sources may have actually been influenced by Greek notions of the phoenix, rather than the other way around.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 14\u201325}}\n\n==Appearance==\nThe phoenix is sometimes pictured in ancient and medieval literature and medieval art as endowed with a [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]], which emphasizes the bird's connection with the Sun.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 233}} In the oldest images of phoenixes on record these nimbuses often have seven rays, like [[Helios]] (the Greek personification of the Sun).{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = 246\u2013247}} Pliny the Elder<ref>''Ancient Magic and the Supernatural in the Modern Visual and Performing Arts'', edited by Filippo Carl\u00e0-Uhink, Irene Berti, 2016, page 172</ref> also describes the bird as having a crest of feathers on its head,<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0137%3Abook%3D10%3Achapter%3D2 10.2]</ref>{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 233}} and [[Ezekiel the Tragedian|Ezekiel the Dramatist]] compared it to a rooster.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 257}}\n\nAlthough the phoenix was generally believed to be colorful and vibrant, sources provide no clear consensus about its coloration. [[Tacitus]] says that its color made it stand out from all other birds.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 253}} Some said that the bird had peacock-like coloring, and [[Herodotus]]'s claim of the Phoenix being red and yellow is popular in many versions of the story on record.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 259}} Ezekiel the Dramatist declared that the phoenix had red legs and striking yellow eyes,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 257}} but [[Lactantius]] said that its eyes were blue like sapphires{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 256}} and that its legs were covered in yellow-gold scales with rose-colored talons.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = 257\u2013258}}\n\nHerodotus, Pliny, [[Solinus]], and [[Philostratus]] describe the phoenix as similar in size to an eagle,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 251}} but Lactantius and Ezekiel the Dramatist both claim that the phoenix was larger, with Lactantius declaring that it was even larger than an ostrich.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 252}}\n\n==In Gnostic texts==\nIdeas taking the phoenix into consideration presented themselves in the [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] manuscript [[On the Origin of the World]] from the [[Nag Hammadi Library]] collection:\n\n{{quote|Thus when [[Eve#Gnosticism|Sophia Zoe]] saw that the rulers of darkness had laid a curse upon her counterparts, she was indignant. And coming out of the first heaven with full power, she chased those rulers out of their heavens and cast them into the sinful world, so that there they should dwell, in the form of evil spirits upon the earth.\n[...], so that in their world it might pass the thousand years in paradise - a soul-endowed living creature called \"phoenix\". It kills itself and brings itself back to life as a witness to the judgement against them, for they did wrong to [[Adam]] and his race, unto the consummation of the age. There are [...] three men, and also his posterities, unto the consummation of the world: the spirit-endowed of eternity, and the soul-endowed, and the earthly. Likewise, there are three phoenixes in paradise - the first is immortal, the second lives 1,000 years; as for the third, it is written in the sacred book that it is consumed. So, too, there are three baptisms - the first is spiritual, the second is by fire, the third is by water. Just as the phoenix appears as a witness concerning the [[angel|angels]], so the case of the water hydri in Egypt, which has been a witness to those going down into the baptism of a true man. The two bulls in Egypt posses a mystery, the Sun and the Moon, being a witness to [[Archon (Gnosticism)#Naming and associations|Sabaoth]]: namely, that over them [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia]] received the universe; from the day that she made the Sun and Moon, she put a seal upon her heaven, unto eternity. And the worm that has been born out of the phoenix is a human being as well. It is written concerning it, \"the just man will blossom like a phoenix\". And the phoenix first appears in a living state, and dies, and rises again, being a sign of what has become apparent at the consummation of the age.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[James M.
