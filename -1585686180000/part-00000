Other presenting symptoms include trouble swallowing or breathing, cramping, or stiffness of affected muscles; muscle weakness affecting an arm or a leg; or slurred and nasal speech.

If the legs are affected first, people may experience awkwardness, tripping, or stumbling when walking or running; this is often marked by walking with a \"[[Foot drop|dropped foot]]\" that drags gently on the ground. If the arms are affected first, they may experience difficulty with tasks requiring manual dexterity, such as buttoning a shirt, writing, or turning a key in a lock.<ref name=NHSsymptoms/>\n\nIn bulbar-onset ALS, the first symptoms are difficulty speaking or swallowing. Speech may become slurred, nasal in character, or quieter. There may be difficulty with swallowing and loss of tongue mobility. A smaller proportion of people experience \"respiratory-onset\" ALS, where the [[intercostal muscle]]s that support breathing are affected first.<ref name=Lancet2011/>\n\nOver time, people experience increasing difficulty moving, swallowing ([[dysphagia]]), and speaking or forming words ([[dysarthria]]). Symptoms of upper motor neuron involvement include tight and stiff muscles ([[spasticity]]) and exaggerated reflexes ([[hyperreflexia]]), including an overactive gag reflex. An abnormal reflex commonly called [[Plantar reflex|Babinski's sign]] also indicates upper motor neuron damage. Symptoms of lower motor neuron degeneration include muscle weakness and atrophy, muscle cramps, and fleeting twitches of muscles that can be seen under the skin (fasciculations). However, twitching is more of a side effect than a diagnostic symptom; it either occurs after or accompanies weakness and atrophy.<ref name=NINDS2014/>\n\n=== Progression ===\nAlthough the initial symptoms and rate of progression vary from person to person, the disease eventually spreads to unaffected regions and the affected regions become more affected. Most people eventually are not able to walk or use their hands and arms, lose the ability to speak and swallow food and their own saliva, and begin to lose the ability to cough and to breathe on their own.<ref name=Support2016/>\n\nThe rate of progression can be measured using the \"ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised (ALSFRS-R)\", a 12-item instrument survey administered as a clinical interview or self-reported questionnaire that produces a score between 48 (normal function) and 0 (severe disability);<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gordon PH, Miller RG, Moore DH | title = ALSFRS-R | journal = Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Other Motor Neuron Disorders | volume = 5 Suppl 1 | pages = 90\u201393 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15512883 | doi = 10.1080/17434470410019906 }}</ref> it is the most commonly used outcome measure in clinical trials and is used by doctors to track disease progression.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Creemers H, Grupstra H, Nollet F, van den Berg LH, Beelen A | title = Prognostic factors for the course of functional status of patients with ALS: a systematic review | journal = Journal of Neurology | volume = 262 | issue = 6 | pages = 1407\u201323 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25385051 | doi = 10.1007/s00415-014-7564-8 }}</ref> Though the degree of variability is high and a small percentage of people have a much slower disorder, on average, people with ALS lose about 0.9 FRS points per month.

Mutant SOD1 protein forms intracellular aggregations that inhibit protein degradation. Cytoplasmic aggregations of [[wild-type]] (normal) SOD1 protein are common in sporadic ALS.<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/> It is thought that misfolded mutant SOD1 can cause misfolding and aggregation of wild-type SOD1 in neighboring neurons in a prion-like manner.<ref name=Nature2017/> Other protein degradation genes that can cause ALS when mutated include ''[[Valosin-containing protein|VCP]]'', ''[[Optineurin|OPTN]]'', ''TBK1'', and ''SQSTM1''. Three genes implicated in ALS that are important for maintaining the cytoskeleton<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/> and for axonal transport<ref name=Nature2017/> include ''[[DCTN1]]'', ''[[PFN1]]'', and ''[[TUBA4A]]''.<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/>\n\nThere are a number of ALS genes that encode for RNA-binding proteins. The first to be discovered was TDP-43 protein,<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/> a nuclear protein that aggregates in the cytoplasm of motor neurons in almost all cases of ALS; however, mutations in ''TARDBP'', the gene that codes for TDP-43, are a rare cause of ALS.<ref name=Nature2017/> ''FUS'' codes for FUS, another RNA-binding protein with a similar function to TDP-43, which can cause ALS when mutated.<ref name=Neuroscience2014/> It is thought that mutations in ''TARDBP'' and ''FUS'' increase the binding affinity of the low-complexity domain, causing their respective proteins to aggregate in the cytoplasm. Once these mutant RNA-binding proteins are misfolded and aggregated, they may be able to misfold normal protein both within and between cells in a prion-like manner.<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/> This also leads to decreased levels of RNA-binding protein in the nucleus, which may mean that their target RNA transcripts do not undergo the normal processing. Other RNA metabolism genes associated with ALS include ''[[angiogenin|ANG]]'', ''[[SETX]]'', and ''[[MATR3]]''.<ref name=Nature2017/>\n\n''C9orf72'' is the most commonly mutated gene in ALS and causes motor neuron death through a number of mechanisms.<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/> The pathogenic mutation is a hexanucleotide repeat expansion (a series of six nucleotides repeated over and over);<ref name=\"Trends in Genetics 2018\"/> people with 30 repeats are normal, while people with hundreds or thousands of repeats can have familial ALS, frontotemporal dementia, or sometimes sporadic ALS. The three mechanisms of disease associated with these ''C9orf72'' repeats are deposition of RNA transcripts in the nucleus, translation of the RNA into toxic dipeptide repeat proteins in the cytoplasm, and decreased levels of the normal C9orf72 protein.<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/>\n\n[[Excitotoxicity]], or nerve cell death caused by high levels of intracellular calcium due to excessive stimulation by the excitatory neurotransmitter [[glutamate]], is a mechanism thought to be common to all forms of ALS. Motor neurons are more sensitive to excitotoxicity than other types of neurons because they have a lower calcium-buffering capacity and a type of glutamate receptor (the [[AMPA receptor]]) that is more permeable to calcium. In ALS, there are decreased levels of excitatory amino acid transporter 2 ([[EAAT2]]), which is the main transporter that removes glutamate from the synapse; this leads to increased synaptic glutamate levels and excitotoxicity. Riluzole, a drug that modestly prolongs survival in ALS, inhibits glutamate release from pre-synaptic neurons; however, it is unclear if this mechanism is responsible for its therapeutic effect.<ref name=Nature2017/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n[[File:ALS cross.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|MRI (axial [[Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery|FLAIR]]) demonstrates increased [[Spin-spin relaxation|''T<sub>2</sub>'']] signal within the [[Internal capsule#Posterior limb|posterior part of the internal capsule]], consistent with the diagnosis of ALS.]]\nNo test can provide a definite diagnosis of ALS, although the presence of upper and lower motor neuron signs in a single limb is strongly suggestive.<ref name=NINDS2014/> Instead, the diagnosis of ALS is primarily based on the symptoms and signs the [[physician]] observes in the person and a series of tests to rule out other diseases.<ref name=NINDS2014/> Physicians obtain the person's full [[medical history]] and usually conduct a neurologic examination at regular intervals to assess whether symptoms such as muscle weakness, atrophy of muscles, [[hyperreflexia]], and spasticity are worsening.<ref name=NINDS2014/> A number of biomarkers are being studied for the condition, but so far are not in general medical use.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xu Z, Henderson RD, David M, McCombe PA | title = Neurofilaments as Biomarkers for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = e0164625 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27732645 | pmc = 5061412 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0164625 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1164625X }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vu LT, Bowser R | title = Fluid-Based Biomarkers for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis | journal = Neurotherapeutics | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 119\u2013134 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27933485 | pmc = 5233638 | doi = 10.1007/s13311-016-0503-x }}</ref>\n\n===Diagnostic criteria===\nThe diagnosis of ALS is based on the El Escorial Revised criteria and the Awaji criteria.<ref name=Nature2017/> The original El Escorial criteria had four levels of diagnostic certainty, based on how many of the four spinal cord regions were involved: bulbar, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar.

The El Escorial Revised criteria, also known as the Airlie House criteria, dropped the \"suspected ALS\" category and added a \"laboratory-supported probable ALS\" category.

There are also new methods of developing animal models, including viral [[transgenesis]], in which viruses are used to deliver mutant genes to an animal model, and [[CRISPR/Cas9]], which can be used to give an animal model multiple mutated genes. Both of these methods are faster and cheaper than traditional methods of genetically engineering mice; they also allow scientists to study the effects of a mutation in mice of different genetic backgrounds, which better represents the genetic diversity seen in humans.<ref name=MouseModels2018/>\n\nCellular models used to study ALS include the yeast ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' and rat or mouse motor neurons in culture. Small-animal models include the fruit fly, the roundworm ''C. elegans'', and the zebrafish. Of the three, the fruit fly is the most widely used; it has a rapid life-cycle, short lifespan, a sophisticated nervous system, and many genetic tools available. ''C. elegans'' has a short life-cycle, is easy to manipulate genetically, and has a simple but well-understood nervous system. The zebrafish has transparent embryos that can be injected with DNA or RNA and has a lifespan of up to two years.<ref name=\"Modelling ALS\"/> [[Induced pluripotent stem cells]] (iPSCs) can be used to convert skin [[fibroblasts]] into motor neurons.<ref name=Lancet2017/> It is now possible to generate iPSCs from people with ALS, which can then be converted into spinal motor neurons, which are useful for studying disease mechanisms and for testing potential drugs for ALS. iPSCs allow sporadic ALS to be modeled, which cannot be done with animal models.<ref name=\"Modelling ALS\"/>\n\n===Treatments===\nFrom the 1960s until 2014, about 50 drugs for ALS were tested in randomized controlled trials (RCTs);{{efn|For the complete list, see [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis research#Past clinical trials]].}} of these, riluzole was the only one that showed a slight benefit in improving survival. Drugs tested and not shown to be effective in clinical trials in humans include antiviral drugs, anti-excitotoxic drugs, growth factors, neurotrophic factors, anti-inflammatory drugs, antioxidants, anti-apoptotic drugs, and drugs to improve mitochondria function.<ref name=\"Mitsumoto 2014\"/>\n\nAn analysis of 23 large phase II and phase III RCTs that failed between 2004 and 2014 concluded that there were many potential reasons for their lack of success. These trials in humans went ahead on the basis of positive results in ''SOD1'' transgenic mice, which are not a good animal model for sporadic ALS. Additionally, in most preclinical studies the ''SOD1'' mice were given the drug during the presymptomatic stage; this makes the results less likely to apply to people with ALS, who begin treatment well after their symptoms begin. Positive results in small phase II studies in humans could also be misleading and lead to failure in phase III trials. Other potential issues included the drug not reaching its intended site of action in the central nervous system and [[drug interactions]] between the study drug and riluzole.<ref name=\"Mitsumoto 2014\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Mitsumoto H, Brooks BR, Silani V | title = Clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: why so many negative trials and how can trials be improved? | journal = The Lancet.

If the legs are affected first, people may experience awkwardness, tripping, or stumbling when walking or running; this is often marked by walking with a \"[[Foot drop|dropped foot]]\" that drags gently on the ground. If the arms are affected first, they may experience difficulty with tasks requiring manual dexterity, such as buttoning a shirt, writing, or turning a key in a lock.<ref name=NHSsymptoms/>\n\nIn bulbar-onset ALS, the first symptoms are difficulty speaking or swallowing. Speech may become slurred, nasal in character, or quieter. There may be difficulty with swallowing and loss of tongue mobility. A smaller proportion of people experience \"respiratory-onset\" ALS, where the [[intercostal muscle]]s that support breathing are affected first.<ref name=Lancet2011/>\n\nOver time, people experience increasing difficulty moving, swallowing ([[dysphagia]]), and speaking or forming words ([[dysarthria]]). Symptoms of upper motor neuron involvement include tight and stiff muscles ([[spasticity]]) and exaggerated reflexes ([[hyperreflexia]]), including an overactive gag reflex. An abnormal reflex commonly called [[Plantar reflex|Babinski's sign]] also indicates upper motor neuron damage.

In about 97% of people with ALS, the main component of the inclusion bodies is TDP-43 protein;<ref name=Nature2017/> however, in those with ''SOD1'' or ''FUS'' mutations, the main component is SOD1 protein or FUS protein, respectively.<ref name=\"Cold Spring Harbor 2017\"/> The [[gross pathology]] of ALS, which are features of the disease that can be seen with the naked eye, include skeletal muscle atrophy, motor cortex atrophy, sclerosis of the [[corticospinal tract|corticospinal]] and [[corticobulbar tract]]s, thinning of the [[hypoglossal nerve]]s (which control the tongue), and thinning of the anterior roots of the spinal cord.<ref name=Nature2017/> Besides for the death of motor neurons, two other characteristics common to most ALS variants are focal initial pathology, meaning that symptoms start in a single spinal cord region, and progressive continuous spread, meaning that symptoms spread to additional regions over time. [[Prion]]-like propagation of misfolded proteins from cell to cell may explain why ALS starts in one area and spreads to others.<ref name=\"Cold Spring Harbor 2017\"/>\n\n===Biochemistry===\n[[File:ALS Disease Pathology and Proposed Disease Mechanisms.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|This figure shows ten proposed disease mechanisms for ALS and the genes associated with them.<ref name=\"Modelling ALS\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Philip Van Damme P, Robberecht W, Van Den Bosch L  | title = Modelling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: progress and possibilities | journal = Disease Models and Mechanisms | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 537\u201349 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28468939 | pmc = 5451175 | doi = 10.1242/dmm.029058 }}</ref>]]\nIt is still not fully understood why neurons die in ALS, but this [[neurodegeneration]] is thought to involve many different cellular and molecular processes.<ref name=Lancet2017/> The genes known to be involved in ALS can be grouped into three general categories based on their normal function: protein degradation, the [[cytoskeleton]], and RNA processing. Mutant SOD1 protein forms intracellular aggregations that inhibit protein degradation. Cytoplasmic aggregations of [[wild-type]] (normal) SOD1 protein are common in sporadic ALS.<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/> It is thought that misfolded mutant SOD1 can cause misfolding and aggregation of wild-type SOD1 in neighboring neurons in a prion-like manner.<ref name=Nature2017/> Other protein degradation genes that can cause ALS when mutated include ''[[Valosin-containing protein|VCP]]'', ''[[Optineurin|OPTN]]'', ''TBK1'', and ''SQSTM1''. Three genes implicated in ALS that are important for maintaining the cytoskeleton<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/> and for axonal transport<ref name=Nature2017/> include ''[[DCTN1]]'', ''[[PFN1]]'', and ''[[TUBA4A]]''.<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/>\n\nThere are a number of ALS genes that encode for RNA-binding proteins. The first to be discovered was TDP-43 protein,<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/> a nuclear protein that aggregates in the cytoplasm of motor neurons in almost all cases of ALS; however, mutations in ''TARDBP'', the gene that codes for TDP-43, are a rare cause of ALS.<ref name=Nature2017/> ''FUS'' codes for FUS, another RNA-binding protein with a similar function to TDP-43, which can cause ALS when mutated.<ref name=Neuroscience2014/> It is thought that mutations in ''TARDBP'' and ''FUS'' increase the binding affinity of the low-complexity domain, causing their respective proteins to aggregate in the cytoplasm. Once these mutant RNA-binding proteins are misfolded and aggregated, they may be able to misfold normal protein both within and between cells in a prion-like manner.<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/> This also leads to decreased levels of RNA-binding protein in the nucleus, which may mean that their target RNA transcripts do not undergo the normal processing. Other RNA metabolism genes associated with ALS include ''[[angiogenin|ANG]]'', ''[[SETX]]'', and ''[[MATR3]]''.<ref name=Nature2017/>\n\n''C9orf72'' is the most commonly mutated gene in ALS and causes motor neuron death through a number of mechanisms.<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/> The pathogenic mutation is a hexanucleotide repeat expansion (a series of six nucleotides repeated over and over);<ref name=\"Trends in Genetics 2018\"/> people with 30 repeats are normal, while people with hundreds or thousands of repeats can have familial ALS, frontotemporal dementia, or sometimes sporadic ALS. The three mechanisms of disease associated with these ''C9orf72'' repeats are deposition of RNA transcripts in the nucleus, translation of the RNA into toxic dipeptide repeat proteins in the cytoplasm, and decreased levels of the normal C9orf72 protein.<ref name=\"NEJM 2017\"/>\n\n[[Excitotoxicity]], or nerve cell death caused by high levels of intracellular calcium due to excessive stimulation by the excitatory neurotransmitter [[glutamate]], is a mechanism thought to be common to all forms of ALS. Motor neurons are more sensitive to excitotoxicity than other types of neurons because they have a lower calcium-buffering capacity and a type of glutamate receptor (the [[AMPA receptor]]) that is more permeable to calcium. In ALS, there are decreased levels of excitatory amino acid transporter 2 ([[EAAT2]]), which is the main transporter that removes glutamate from the synapse; this leads to increased synaptic glutamate levels and excitotoxicity. Riluzole, a drug that modestly prolongs survival in ALS, inhibits glutamate release from pre-synaptic neurons; however, it is unclear if this mechanism is responsible for its therapeutic effect.<ref name=Nature2017/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\n[[File:ALS cross.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|MRI (axial [[Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery|FLAIR]]) demonstrates increased [[Spin-spin relaxation|''T<sub>2</sub>'']] signal within the [[Internal capsule#Posterior limb|posterior part of the internal capsule]], consistent with the diagnosis of ALS.]]\nNo test can provide a definite diagnosis of ALS, although the presence of upper and lower motor neuron signs in a single limb is strongly suggestive.<ref name=NINDS2014/> Instead, the diagnosis of ALS is primarily based on the symptoms and signs the [[physician]] observes in the person and a series of tests to rule out other diseases.<ref name=NINDS2014/> Physicians obtain the person's full [[medical history]] and usually conduct a neurologic examination at regular intervals to assess whether symptoms such as muscle weakness, atrophy of muscles, [[hyperreflexia]], and spasticity are worsening.<ref name=NINDS2014/> A number of biomarkers are being studied for the condition, but so far are not in general medical use.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Xu Z, Henderson RD, David M, McCombe PA | title = Neurofilaments as Biomarkers for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 11 | issue = 10 | pages = e0164625 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27732645 | pmc = 5061412 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0164625 | bibcode = 2016PLoSO..1164625X }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vu LT, Bowser R | title = Fluid-Based Biomarkers for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis | journal = Neurotherapeutics | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 119\u2013134 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27933485 | pmc = 5233638 | doi = 10.1007/s13311-016-0503-x }}</ref>\n\n===Diagnostic criteria===\nThe diagnosis of ALS is based on the El Escorial Revised criteria and the Awaji criteria.<ref name=Nature2017/> The original El Escorial criteria had four levels of diagnostic certainty, based on how many of the four spinal cord regions were involved: bulbar, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar. Definite ALS was defined as upper motor neuron (UMN) and lower motor neuron (LMN) signs in three spinal cord regions, probable ALS as UMN and LMN signs in two regions, possible ALS as UMN and LMN signs in only one region, and suspected ALS as LMN signs only. The El Escorial Revised criteria, also known as the Airlie House criteria, dropped the \"suspected ALS\" category and added a \"laboratory-supported probable ALS\" category. The Awaji criteria give abnormal EMG tests the same weight as clinical signs of LMN dysfunction in making the diagnosis of ALS,<ref name=Classification2016/> thus making the \"laboratory-supported probable ALS\" category unnecessary.

The U.S. was both fascinated and horrified by the practice of polygamy, with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] platform at one time referencing \"the twin relics of barbarism\u2014polygamy and slavery.\"<ref>[http://www.ushistory.org/gop/convention_1856.htm US History.org] website</ref> The private practice of polygamy was instituted in the 1830s by founder [[Joseph Smith]]. The public practice of plural marriage by the church was announced and defended in 1852 by a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], [[Orson Pratt]],<ref name=Embry1994 /> by the request of [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Brigham Young]].\n\nFor over 60 years, the [[LDS Church and politics in the United States|LDS Church and the United States]] were at odds over the issue: the church defended the practice as a matter of religious freedom, while the federal government aggressively sought to eradicate it, consistent with prevailing public opinion. Polygamy was probably a significant factor in the [[Utah War]] of 1857 and 1858, given Republican attempts to paint Democratic President [[James Buchanan]] as weak in his opposition to both polygamy and slavery. In 1862, the United States Congress passed the [[Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act]], which prohibited plural marriage in the territories.<ref name=Embry1994 /> In spite of the law, Mormons continued to practice polygamy, believing that it was protected by the [[First Amendment]]. In 1879, in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'',<ref>''Reynolds v. United States'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20061009192447/http://www.historyofsupremecourt.org/scripts/supremecourt/glossary.cgi?term=r&letter=yes \u201cThe History of The Supreme Court\u201d]</ref> the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the Morrill Act, stating: \"Laws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinion, they may with practices.\"<ref name=Embry1994 />\n\nIn 1890, when it became clear that Utah would not be admitted to the Union while polygamy was still the practice, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] issued a [[1890 Manifesto|Manifesto]] that officially terminated the practice of polygamy.<ref>{{lds|Official Declaration |od|1}}</ref> Although this Manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. After the Manifesto, some Mormons continued to enter into polygamous marriages, but these eventually stopped in 1904 when church president [[Joseph F. Smith]] [[Reed Smoot hearings|disavowed polygamy]] before Congress and issued a \"[[Second Manifesto]]\", calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease and established [[excommunication]] as the consequence for those who disobeyed. Several small \"fundamentalist\" groups, seeking to continue the practice, split from the LDS Church, including the [[Apostolic United Brethren]] (AUB) and the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]] (FLDS Church). Meanwhile, the LDS Church continues its policy of excommunicating members found practicing polygamy, and today actively seeks to distance itself from fundamentalist groups that continue the practice.<ref>The LDS Church encourages journalists not to use the word \"Mormon\" in reference to organizations or people that practice polygamy {{cite web |url=https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/style-guide |title=Style Guide \u2014 LDS Newsroom |accessdate=2014-04-15}}; the church repudiates polygamist groups and excommunicates their members if discovered {{Harvtxt|Bushman|2008|p=91}}; {{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/25396937 |title=Mormons seek distance from polygamous sects |year=2008 |publisher=NBC News}}</ref> On its web site, the church states that \"the standard doctrine of the church is monogamy\" and that polygamy was a temporary exception to the rule.<ref name=LDSofficialstatement /><ref>Citing [[Book of Jacob|Jacob]], chapter 2, from the [[Book of Mormon]]: \"Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: For there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none . ...

On July 8, 1862, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] signed the [[Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act]] into law, which forbade the practice in U.S. territories. Lincoln made a statement that he had no intentions of enforcing it if the LDS Church would not interfere with him, and so the matter was laid to rest for a time. But rhetoric continued, and polygamy became an impediment to Utah being admitted as a state. Brigham Young preached in 1866 that if Utah will not be admitted to the Union until it abandons polygamy, \"we shall never be admitted.\"<ref>''[[Journal of Discourses]]'' '''11''':266.</ref>\n\nAfter the Civil War, immigrants to Utah who were not members of the church continued the contest for political power. They were frustrated by the consolidation of the members. Forming the [[Liberal Party (Utah)|Liberal Party]], non-Mormons began pushing for political changes and sought to weaken the church's dominance in the territory. In September 1871, Young was indicted for adultery due to his plural marriages. On January 6, 1879, the Supreme Court upheld the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]''.\n\n===1882 Edmunds Act===\n{{Main|Edmunds Act}}\nIn February 1882, [[George Q. Cannon]], a prominent leader in the church, was denied a non-voting seat in the U.S. House of Representatives due to his polygamous relations. This revived the issue of polygamy in national politics. One month later, the [[Edmunds Act]] was passed by Congress, amending the Morrill Act and made polygamy a felony punishable by a $500 fine and five years in prison. \"Unlawful cohabitation\", in which the prosecution did not need to prove that a marriage ceremony had taken place (only that a couple had lived together), was a misdemeanor punishable by a $300 fine and six months imprisonment.<ref name=Embry1994 /> It also revoked the right of polygamists to vote or hold office and allowed them to be punished without due process. Even if people did not practice polygamy, they would have their rights revoked if they confessed a belief in it. In August, [[Rudger Clawson]] was imprisoned for continuing to cohabit with wives that he married before the 1862 Morrill Act.\n\n===1887 Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act===\n{{Main|Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act}}\n[[File:Polygamists in prison.jpg|thumb|290px|Portrait of polygamists in prison, at the Utah Penitentiary, including [[George Q.

In July of the same year, the U.S. Attorney General filed suit to seize all church assets.\n\nThe church was losing control of the territorial government, and many members and leaders were being actively pursued as fugitives. Without being able to appear publicly, the leadership was left to navigate \"underground\".\n\nFollowing the passage of the Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act, the church found it difficult to operate as a viable institution. After visiting  priesthood leaders in many settlements, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] left for San Francisco on September 3, 1890, to meet with prominent businessmen and politicians. He returned to Salt Lake City on September 21, determined to obtain divine confirmation to pursue a course that seemed to be agonizingly more and more clear. As he explained to church members a year later, the choice was between, on the one hand, continuing to practice plural marriage and thereby losing the [[temple (LDS Church)|temples]], \"stopping all the ordinances therein,\" and, on the other, ceasing plural marriage in order to continue performing the essential ordinances for the living and the dead. Woodruff hastened to add that he had acted only as the Lord directed:\n\n{{quote|I should have let all the temples go out of our hands; I should have gone to prison myself, and let every other man go there, had not the God of heaven commanded me to do what I do; and when the hour came that I was commanded to do that, it was all clear to me.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/od/1?lang=eng|title=Official Declaration 1|website=ChurchofJesusChrist.org}}</ref>}}\n\n==1890 Manifesto banning plural marriage==\n{{Main|1890 Manifesto}}\nThe final element in Woodruff's revelatory experience came on the evening of September 23, 1890. The following morning, he reported to some of the [[general authorities]] that he had struggled throughout the night with the Lord regarding the path that should be pursued. The result was a 510-word handwritten manuscript which stated his intentions to comply with the law and denied that the church continued to solemnize or condone plural marriages. The document was later edited by [[George Q. Cannon]] of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and others to its present 356 words. On October 6, 1890, it was presented to the Latter-day Saints at the [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]] and unanimously approved.\n\nWhile many church leaders in 1890 regarded the [[1890 Manifesto|Manifesto]] as inspired, there were differences among them about its scope and permanence. Contemporary opinions include the contention that the manifesto was more related to an effort to achieve statehood for the Utah territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/sfeature/utah_04.html|title=The Mormons \u2013 Special Features \u2013 PBS|website=www.pbs.org}}</ref> Some leaders were reluctant to terminate a long-standing practice that was regarded as divinely mandated. As a result, over 200 plural marriages were performed between 1890 and 1904.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hardy|1992}}</ref>\n\n===1904 Second Manifesto===\n{{Main|Second Manifesto}}\nIt was not until 1904, under the leadership of church president [[Joseph F. Smith]], that the church completely banned new plural marriages worldwide.<ref>Scriptures of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, for the Sunday Schools, Salt Lake City: Deseret Sunday School Union, 1968, p. 159.</ref> Not surprisingly, rumors persisted of marriages performed after the 1890 Manifesto, and beginning in January 1904, testimony given in the [[Reed Smoot hearings|Smoot hearings]] made it clear that plural marriage had not been completely extinguished.\n\nThe ambiguity was ended in the General Conference of April 1904, when Smith issued the \"[[Second Manifesto]]\", an emphatic declaration that prohibited plural marriage and proclaimed that offenders would be subject to [[Disciplinary council|church discipline]]. It declared that any who participated in additional plural marriages, and those officiating, would be excommunicated from the church. Those disagreeing with the Second Manifesto included apostles [[Matthias F. Cowley]] and [[John W. Taylor (Mormon)|John W. Taylor]], who both resigned from the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve]]. Cowley retained his membership in the church, but Taylor was later excommunicated.\n\nAlthough the Second Manifesto ended the official practice of new plural marriages, existing plural marriages were not automatically dissolved. Many Mormons, including prominent church leaders, maintained existing plural marriages into the 1940s and 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Embry|first1=Jessie L.|title=The History of Polygamy|url=https://heritage.utah.gov/history/uhg-history-polygamy-2|website=heritage.utah.gov|publisher=Utah State Historical Society|year=1994|quote=Those involved in plural marriages after 1904 were excommunicated; and those married between 1890 and 1904 were not to have church callings where other members would have to sustain them.

Lyman]] was cohabitating with a woman other than his legal wife. As it turned out, in 1925 Lyman had begun a relationship which he defined as a polygamous marriage. Unable to trust anyone else to officiate, Lyman and the woman exchanged vows secretly. By 1943, both were in their seventies. Lyman was excommunicated on November 12, 1943, at age 73. The Quorum of the Twelve provided the newspapers with a one-sentence announcement, stating that the ground for excommunication was violation of the [[law of chastity]].\n\n==Remnants within sects==\n[[Image:Teens from polygamous families.jpg|200px|thumb|Teens from polygamous families along with over 200 supporters demonstrate at a pro-plural marriage rally in Salt Lake City in 2006<ref>\n{{cite news\n|title=Teens defend polygamy at Utah rally\n|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060820/ap_on_re_us/polygamy_rally\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902171217/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060820/ap_on_re_us/polygamy_rally\n|last=Dobner\n|first=Jennifer\n|agency=[[Associated Press]]\n|date=20 August 2006\n|work=[[Yahoo!

These beliefs stem from statements by 19th-century Mormon authorities including Brigham Young (although some of these leaders gave possibly conflicting statements that a monogamist may obtain at least a lower degree of \"exaltation\" through mere ''belief'' in polygamy).<ref>{{Harvtxt|Quinn|1985|pp=24 fn. 65}}</ref>\n\nFor public relations reasons, the LDS Church has sought vigorously to disassociate itself from Mormon fundamentalists and the practice of plural marriage.<ref>[https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/mormon-fundamentalists- \"Mormon Fundamentalists\"], 6 March 2006 press release by the LDS Church.</ref> Although the LDS Church has requested that journalists not refer to Mormon fundamentalists using the term \"Mormon\",<ref>[https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/polygamist-sects-are-not--mormons,--church-says \"Polygamist Sects Are Not 'Mormons,' Church Says\"], 25 October 2006 press release by the LDS Church.</ref> journalists generally have not complied, and \"Mormon fundamentalist\" has become standard terminology. Mormon fundamentalists themselves embrace the term \"[[Mormon (word)|Mormon]]\" and share a religious heritage and beliefs with the LDS Church, including canonization of the [[Book of Mormon]] and a claim that Joseph Smith is the founder of their religion.\n\n==Modern plural marriage theory within the LDS Church==\n{{Main|Current state of polygamy in the Latter Day Saint movement}}\n\nAlthough the LDS Church has abandoned the practice of plural marriage, it has not abandoned the underlying doctrines of polygamy. According to the church's [[sacred text]]s and pronouncements by its leaders and theologians, the church leaves open the possibility that it may one day re-institute the practice. It is still the practice of monogamous Mormon couples to be sealed to one another. However, in some circumstances, men and women may be sealed to multiple spouses. Most commonly, a man may be sealed to multiple wives: if his first wife dies, he may be sealed to a second wife. A deceased woman may also be sealed to multiple men, but only through [[Mormonism and polygamy#Multiple sealings when a prior spouse has died|vicarious sealing]] if they are also deceased.<ref>[[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]] (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2010) \u00a7 3.6.1.</ref>\n\n===Reasons for polygamy===\nAs early as the publication of the [[Book of Mormon]] in 1830, Latter Day Saint doctrine maintained that polygamy was allowable only if it was commanded by God. The [[Book of Jacob]] condemned polygamy as adultery,<ref>{{lds|Jacob|jacob|2|23|29}}.</ref> but left open the proviso that \"For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise, they shall hearken unto these things.\"<ref>{{lds|Jacob|jacob|2|30}}.</ref> Thus, the LDS Church today teaches that plural marriage can only be practiced when specifically authorized by God. According to this view, the [[1890 Manifesto]] and [[Second Manifesto]] rescinded God's prior authorization given to Joseph Smith.\n\nHowever, [[Bruce R. McConkie]] controversially stated in his 1958 book, ''[[Mormon Doctrine (book)|Mormon Doctrine]]'', that God will \"obviously\" re-institute the practice of polygamy after the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus Christ.<ref>Bruce R. McConkie, ''Mormon Doctrine'', 2d ed., Bookcraft, 1966, p. 578 (\"Obviously the holy practice [of plural marriage] will commence again after the Second Coming of the Son of Man and the ushering in of the millennium.\").

Penrose]], ''\"Mormon\" Doctrine Plain and Simple, or Leaves from the Tree of Life'', 1897, Salt Lake City, p.66 (\"In the case of a man marrying a wife in the everlasting covenant who dies while he continues in the flesh and marries another by the same divine law, each wife will come forth in her order and enter with him into his glory.\"); [[Joseph Fielding Smith]], [[Bruce R.

Lee]], ''Deseret News 1974 Church Almanac'', p. 17 (\"My lovely Joan was sent to me: So Joan joins Fern/That three might be, more fitted for eternity./'O Heavenly Father, my thanks to thee'.\").</ref> Apostle [[Dallin Oaks]] is an example of such a case.<ref>\"When I was 66, my wife June died of cancer. Two years later I married Kristen McMain, the eternal companion who now stands at my side.\" [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2003/10/timing?lang=eng \"Timing\"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', October 2003.</ref>\n\nUnder LDS Church policy, a man whose sealed wife has died does not have to request any permission beyond having a current temple recommend and an interview with his bishop to get final permission for a living ordinance, to be married in the temple and sealed to another woman, unless the new wife's circumstance requires a cancellation of sealing. However, a woman whose sealed husband has died is still bound by the original sealing and must request a cancellation of sealing to be sealed to another man (see next paragraph for exception to this after she dies). In some cases, women in this situation who wish to remarry choose to be married to subsequent husbands in the temple \"for time only\", and are not sealed to them, leaving them sealed to their first husband for eternity.\n\nAs of 1998, however, women who have died may be sealed to more than one man. In 1998, the LDS Church created a new policy that a woman may also be sealed to more than one man. A woman, however, may not be sealed to more than one man while she is alive. She may only be sealed to subsequent partners after both she and her husband(s) have died.<ref name = CHOI>LDS Church, ''[[Church Handbook of Instructions]]'', (LDS Church, Salt Lake City, Utah, 1998) p. 72. \"A deceased woman may be sealed to all men to whom she was legally married during her life. However, if she was sealed to a husband during her life, all her husbands must be deceased before she can be sealed to a husband to whom she was not sealed during life.\"</ref> Thus, if a widow who was sealed to her first husband remarries, she may be sealed by proxy to all of her subsequent husband(s), but only after both she and the subsequent husbands have died. Proxy sealings, like proxy baptisms, are merely ''offered'' to the person in the afterlife, indicating that the purpose is to allow the woman to choose the right man to be sealed to. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n====Multiple sealings when marriages end in divorce====\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2012|talk=y}}\nA man who is sealed to a woman but later divorced must apply for a \"sealing clearance\" from the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] in order to be sealed to another woman. Receiving clearance does not void or invalidate the first sealing. A woman in the same circumstances would apply to the First Presidency for a \"cancellation of sealing\" (sometimes called a \"temple divorce\"), allowing her to be sealed to another man. This approval voids the original sealing as far as the woman is concerned. Divorced women who have not applied for a sealing cancellation are considered sealed to the original husband. However, it is generally believed that even in the afterlife the marriage relationship is voluntary, so no person could be forced into an eternal relationship through temple sealing that they do not wish to be in. Divorced women may also be granted a cancellation of sealing, even though they do not intend to marry someone else. In this case, they are no longer regarded as being sealed to anyone and are presumed to have the same eternal status as unwed women.\n\n====Proxy sealings where both spouses have died====\nAccording to church policy, after a man has died, he may be sealed by proxy to all of the women to whom he was legally married while he was alive. The same is true for women; however, if a woman was sealed to a man while she was alive, all of her husbands must be deceased before she can be sealed by proxy to them.<ref name = CHOI/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://help.familysearch.org/kb/UserGuide/en/policy/r_wws_policy_sealing_to_spouse_multiple_husbands.html|title=Help Center \u2014 FamilySearch.org|website=help.familysearch.org}}</ref>\n\nChurch doctrine is not entirely specific on the status of men or women who are sealed by proxy to multiple spouses. There are at least two possibilities:\n# Regardless of how many people a man or woman is sealed to by proxy, they will only remain with one of them in the afterlife, and that the remaining spouses, who might still merit the full benefits of exaltation that come from being sealed, would then marry another person in order to ensure each has an eternal marriage.\n# These sealings create effective plural marriages that will continue after death. There are no church teachings clarifying whether polyandrous relationships can exist in the afterlife, so some church members doubt whether this possibility would apply to women who are sealed by proxy to multiple spouses. The possibility for women to be sealed to multiple men is a recent policy change enacted in 1998. Church leaders have neither explained this change, nor its doctrinal implications.\n\n==Criticism of plural marriage==\n\n===Instances of unhappy plural marriage===\nCritics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that plural marriages produced unhappiness in some wives.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tanner|1979|pp=226\u2013228}}</ref> LDS historian Todd Compton, in his book ''[[In Sacred Loneliness]]'', described various instances where some wives in polygamous marriages were unhappy with polygamy.<ref name=\"Harvnb|Compton|1997\">{{Harvnb|Compton|1997}}</ref>\n\n===A means for male sexual gratification===\nCritics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that church leaders established the practice of polygamy in order to further their immoral desires for sexual gratification with multiple sexual partners.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tanner|1979|pp=204\u2013290}}</ref>  Critics point to the fact that church leaders practiced polygamy in secret from 1833 to 1852, despite a written church doctrine (Doctrine and Covenants 101, 1835 edition) renouncing polygamy and stating that only monogamous marriages were permitted.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tanner|1987|p=202}}</ref> Critics also cite several first-person accounts of early church leaders attempting to use the polygamy doctrine to enter into illicit relationships with women.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|1876|pp=65\u201386}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1842|pp=226\u2013232}}</ref> Critics also assert that Joseph Smith instituted polygamy in order to cover up an 1835 adulterous affair with a neighbor's daughter, [[Fanny Alger]], by taking Alger as his second wife.<ref>{{Harvnb|Abanes|2003|pp=132\u2013134}}</ref> Compton dates this marriage to March or April 1833, well before Joseph was accused of an affair.<ref>{{Harvnb|Compton|1996|pp=174\u2013207}}</ref> However, historian Lawrence Foster dismisses the marriage of Alger to Joseph Smith as \"debatable supposition\" rather than \"established fact\".<ref>[http://www.signaturebooks.com/reviews/insacred.htm \"Review of Todd Compton, ''In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith''\"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20060323034213/http://www.signaturebooks.com/reviews/insacred.htm |date=2006-03-23 }}, ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'' 33 (Spring 2001): 184\u201386</ref>\n\nOthers conclude that many Latter-day Saints entered into plural marriage based on the belief that it was a religious commandment, rather than as an excuse for sexual license. For instance, many of the figures who came to be best associated with plural marriage, including church president Brigham Young and his counselor [[Heber C. Kimball]], expressed revulsion at the system when it was first introduced to them. Young famously stated that after receiving the commandment to practice plural marriage in [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], he saw a funeral procession walking down the street and he wished he could exchange places with the corpse. He recalled that \"I was not desirous of shrinking from any duty, nor of failing in the least to do as I was commanded, but it was the first time in my life that I had desired the grave, and I could hardly get over it for a long time.\"<ref>[[Leonard J. Arrington]], ''[[Brigham Young: American Moses]]'', p. 100 (1985).</ref> When Kimball first heard of the principle, he believed that he would marry elderly women whom he would care for and who would not be a threat to his first wife Vilate. He was later shocked to learn that he was to marry a younger woman.<ref name=\"Whitney 1888 p=326\">{{Harvnb|Whitney|1888|p=326}}</ref> His biographer writes that he \"became sick in body, but his mental wretchedness was too great to allow of his retiring, and he would walk the floor till nearly morning, and sometimes the agony of his mind was so terrible that he would wring his hands and weep like a child\".<ref name=\"Whitney 1888 p=326\"/> While his wife Vilate had trials \"grievous to bear\" as a result of her acceptance of plural marriage, she supported her husband in his religious duties, and taught her children that \"she could not doubt the plural order of marriage was of God, for the Lord had revealed it to her in answer to prayer.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Whitney|1888|pp=325\u2013328}}</ref>\n\n===Underage plural marriages===\nCritics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that church leaders sometimes used polygamy to take advantage of young girls for immoral purposes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Abanes|2003|p=294}}</ref> Historian [[George D.

The U.S. was both fascinated and horrified by the practice of polygamy, with the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] platform at one time referencing \"the twin relics of barbarism\u2014polygamy and slavery.\"<ref>[http://www.ushistory.org/gop/convention_1856.htm US History.org] website</ref> The private practice of polygamy was instituted in the 1830s by founder [[Joseph Smith]]. The public practice of plural marriage by the church was announced and defended in 1852 by a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], [[Orson Pratt]],<ref name=Embry1994 /> by the request of [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church president]] [[Brigham Young]].\n\nFor over 60 years, the [[LDS Church and politics in the United States|LDS Church and the United States]] were at odds over the issue: the church defended the practice as a matter of religious freedom, while the federal government aggressively sought to eradicate it, consistent with prevailing public opinion. Polygamy was probably a significant factor in the [[Utah War]] of 1857 and 1858, given Republican attempts to paint Democratic President [[James Buchanan]] as weak in his opposition to both polygamy and slavery. In 1862, the United States Congress passed the [[Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act]], which prohibited plural marriage in the territories.<ref name=Embry1994 /> In spite of the law, Mormons continued to practice polygamy, believing that it was protected by the [[First Amendment]]. In 1879, in ''[[Reynolds v. United States]]'',<ref>''Reynolds v. United States'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20061009192447/http://www.historyofsupremecourt.org/scripts/supremecourt/glossary.cgi?term=r&letter=yes \u201cThe History of The Supreme Court\u201d]</ref> the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the Morrill Act, stating: \"Laws are made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with mere religious belief and opinion, they may with practices.\"<ref name=Embry1994 />\n\nIn 1890, when it became clear that Utah would not be admitted to the Union while polygamy was still the practice, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] issued a [[1890 Manifesto|Manifesto]] that officially terminated the practice of polygamy.<ref>{{lds|Official Declaration |od|1}}</ref> Although this Manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. After the Manifesto, some Mormons continued to enter into polygamous marriages, but these eventually stopped in 1904 when church president [[Joseph F.

Cannon]], a prominent leader in the church, was denied a non-voting seat in the U.S. House of Representatives due to his polygamous relations. This revived the issue of polygamy in national politics. One month later, the [[Edmunds Act]] was passed by Congress, amending the Morrill Act and made polygamy a felony punishable by a $500 fine and five years in prison. \"Unlawful cohabitation\", in which the prosecution did not need to prove that a marriage ceremony had taken place (only that a couple had lived together), was a misdemeanor punishable by a $300 fine and six months imprisonment.<ref name=Embry1994 /> It also revoked the right of polygamists to vote or hold office and allowed them to be punished without due process. Even if people did not practice polygamy, they would have their rights revoked if they confessed a belief in it. In August, [[Rudger Clawson]] was imprisoned for continuing to cohabit with wives that he married before the 1862 Morrill Act.\n\n===1887 Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act===\n{{Main|Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act}}\n[[File:Polygamists in prison.jpg|thumb|290px|Portrait of polygamists in prison, at the Utah Penitentiary, including [[George Q. Cannon]] in 1889, arrested under the Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act.]]\nIn 1887, the [[Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act]] allowed the disincorporation of the LDS Church and the seizure of church property; it also further extended the punishments of the Edmunds Act. In July of the same year, the U.S. Attorney General filed suit to seize all church assets.\n\nThe church was losing control of the territorial government, and many members and leaders were being actively pursued as fugitives. Without being able to appear publicly, the leadership was left to navigate \"underground\".\n\nFollowing the passage of the Edmunds\u2013Tucker Act, the church found it difficult to operate as a viable institution. After visiting  priesthood leaders in many settlements, church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] left for San Francisco on September 3, 1890, to meet with prominent businessmen and politicians. He returned to Salt Lake City on September 21, determined to obtain divine confirmation to pursue a course that seemed to be agonizingly more and more clear. As he explained to church members a year later, the choice was between, on the one hand, continuing to practice plural marriage and thereby losing the [[temple (LDS Church)|temples]], \"stopping all the ordinances therein,\" and, on the other, ceasing plural marriage in order to continue performing the essential ordinances for the living and the dead. Woodruff hastened to add that he had acted only as the Lord directed:\n\n{{quote|I should have let all the temples go out of our hands; I should have gone to prison myself, and let every other man go there, had not the God of heaven commanded me to do what I do; and when the hour came that I was commanded to do that, it was all clear to me.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/od/1?lang=eng|title=Official Declaration 1|website=ChurchofJesusChrist.org}}</ref>}}\n\n==1890 Manifesto banning plural marriage==\n{{Main|1890 Manifesto}}\nThe final element in Woodruff's revelatory experience came on the evening of September 23, 1890. The following morning, he reported to some of the [[general authorities]] that he had struggled throughout the night with the Lord regarding the path that should be pursued. The result was a 510-word handwritten manuscript which stated his intentions to comply with the law and denied that the church continued to solemnize or condone plural marriages. The document was later edited by [[George Q. Cannon]] of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and others to its present 356 words. On October 6, 1890, it was presented to the Latter-day Saints at the [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]] and unanimously approved.\n\nWhile many church leaders in 1890 regarded the [[1890 Manifesto|Manifesto]] as inspired, there were differences among them about its scope and permanence. Contemporary opinions include the contention that the manifesto was more related to an effort to achieve statehood for the Utah territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/sfeature/utah_04.html|title=The Mormons \u2013 Special Features \u2013 PBS|website=www.pbs.org}}</ref> Some leaders were reluctant to terminate a long-standing practice that was regarded as divinely mandated. As a result, over 200 plural marriages were performed between 1890 and 1904.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hardy|1992}}</ref>\n\n===1904 Second Manifesto===\n{{Main|Second Manifesto}}\nIt was not until 1904, under the leadership of church president [[Joseph F. Smith]], that the church completely banned new plural marriages worldwide.<ref>Scriptures of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, for the Sunday Schools, Salt Lake City: Deseret Sunday School Union, 1968, p. 159.</ref> Not surprisingly, rumors persisted of marriages performed after the 1890 Manifesto, and beginning in January 1904, testimony given in the [[Reed Smoot hearings|Smoot hearings]] made it clear that plural marriage had not been completely extinguished.\n\nThe ambiguity was ended in the General Conference of April 1904, when Smith issued the \"[[Second Manifesto]]\", an emphatic declaration that prohibited plural marriage and proclaimed that offenders would be subject to [[Disciplinary council|church discipline]]. It declared that any who participated in additional plural marriages, and those officiating, would be excommunicated from the church. Those disagreeing with the Second Manifesto included apostles [[Matthias F. Cowley]] and [[John W. Taylor (Mormon)|John W. Taylor]], who both resigned from the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve]]. Cowley retained his membership in the church, but Taylor was later excommunicated.\n\nAlthough the Second Manifesto ended the official practice of new plural marriages, existing plural marriages were not automatically dissolved. Many Mormons, including prominent church leaders, maintained existing plural marriages into the 1940s and 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Embry|first1=Jessie L.|title=The History of Polygamy|url=https://heritage.utah.gov/history/uhg-history-polygamy-2|website=heritage.utah.gov|publisher=Utah State Historical Society|year=1994|quote=Those involved in plural marriages after 1904 were excommunicated; and those married between 1890 and 1904 were not to have church callings where other members would have to sustain them.

Lyman]] was cohabitating with a woman other than his legal wife. As it turned out, in 1925 Lyman had begun a relationship which he defined as a polygamous marriage. Unable to trust anyone else to officiate, Lyman and the woman exchanged vows secretly. By 1943, both were in their seventies. Lyman was excommunicated on November 12, 1943, at age 73. The Quorum of the Twelve provided the newspapers with a one-sentence announcement, stating that the ground for excommunication was violation of the [[law of chastity]].\n\n==Remnants within sects==\n[[Image:Teens from polygamous families.jpg|200px|thumb|Teens from polygamous families along with over 200 supporters demonstrate at a pro-plural marriage rally in Salt Lake City in 2006<ref>\n{{cite news\n|title=Teens defend polygamy at Utah rally\n|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060820/ap_on_re_us/polygamy_rally\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902171217/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060820/ap_on_re_us/polygamy_rally\n|last=Dobner\n|first=Jennifer\n|agency=[[Associated Press]]\n|date=20 August 2006\n|work=[[Yahoo!

These groups continue to practice \"the Principle\". In the 1940s, LDS Church apostle [[Mark E. Petersen]] coined the term \"[[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalist]]\" to describe such people.<ref>Ken Driggs, \"'This Will Someday Be the Head and Not the Tail of the Church': A History of the Mormon Fundamentalists at Short Creek\", ''[[Journal of Church and State]]'' '''43''':49 (2001) at p. 51.</ref> Fundamentalists either practice as individuals, as families, or as part of organized denominations. Today, the LDS Church objects to the use of the term \"Mormon fundamentalists\" and suggests using the term \"polygamist sects\" to avoid confusion about whether the main body of Mormon believers teach or practice polygamy.<ref name=pbs>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/faqs/controversies.html|title=The Mormons . Frequently Asked Questions . Dissent/Excommunication/Controversies \u2013 PBS|website=www.pbs.org}}</ref>\n\nMormon fundamentalists believe that plural marriage is a requirement for [[exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|exaltation]] and entry into the highest level of the [[celestial kingdom]]. These beliefs stem from statements by 19th-century Mormon authorities including Brigham Young (although some of these leaders gave possibly conflicting statements that a monogamist may obtain at least a lower degree of \"exaltation\" through mere ''belief'' in polygamy).<ref>{{Harvtxt|Quinn|1985|pp=24 fn. 65}}</ref>\n\nFor public relations reasons, the LDS Church has sought vigorously to disassociate itself from Mormon fundamentalists and the practice of plural marriage.<ref>[https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/mormon-fundamentalists- \"Mormon Fundamentalists\"], 6 March 2006 press release by the LDS Church.</ref> Although the LDS Church has requested that journalists not refer to Mormon fundamentalists using the term \"Mormon\",<ref>[https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/polygamist-sects-are-not--mormons,--church-says \"Polygamist Sects Are Not 'Mormons,' Church Says\"], 25 October 2006 press release by the LDS Church.</ref> journalists generally have not complied, and \"Mormon fundamentalist\" has become standard terminology. Mormon fundamentalists themselves embrace the term \"[[Mormon (word)|Mormon]]\" and share a religious heritage and beliefs with the LDS Church, including canonization of the [[Book of Mormon]] and a claim that Joseph Smith is the founder of their religion.\n\n==Modern plural marriage theory within the LDS Church==\n{{Main|Current state of polygamy in the Latter Day Saint movement}}\n\nAlthough the LDS Church has abandoned the practice of plural marriage, it has not abandoned the underlying doctrines of polygamy. According to the church's [[sacred text]]s and pronouncements by its leaders and theologians, the church leaves open the possibility that it may one day re-institute the practice. It is still the practice of monogamous Mormon couples to be sealed to one another. However, in some circumstances, men and women may be sealed to multiple spouses. Most commonly, a man may be sealed to multiple wives: if his first wife dies, he may be sealed to a second wife. A deceased woman may also be sealed to multiple men, but only through [[Mormonism and polygamy#Multiple sealings when a prior spouse has died|vicarious sealing]] if they are also deceased.<ref>[[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]] (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2010) \u00a7 3.6.1.</ref>\n\n===Reasons for polygamy===\nAs early as the publication of the [[Book of Mormon]] in 1830, Latter Day Saint doctrine maintained that polygamy was allowable only if it was commanded by God. The [[Book of Jacob]] condemned polygamy as adultery,<ref>{{lds|Jacob|jacob|2|23|29}}.</ref> but left open the proviso that \"For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise, they shall hearken unto these things.\"<ref>{{lds|Jacob|jacob|2|30}}.</ref> Thus, the LDS Church today teaches that plural marriage can only be practiced when specifically authorized by God. According to this view, the [[1890 Manifesto]] and [[Second Manifesto]] rescinded God's prior authorization given to Joseph Smith.\n\nHowever, [[Bruce R. McConkie]] controversially stated in his 1958 book, ''[[Mormon Doctrine (book)|Mormon Doctrine]]'', that God will \"obviously\" re-institute the practice of polygamy after the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus Christ.<ref>Bruce R. McConkie, ''Mormon Doctrine'', 2d ed., Bookcraft, 1966, p. 578 (\"Obviously the holy practice [of plural marriage] will commence again after the Second Coming of the Son of Man and the ushering in of the millennium.\"). See also Janet Bennion, ''Women of Principle: Female Networking in Contemporary Mormon Polygyny'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 20 [https://books.google.com/books?id=q90cUKnsFEMC&pg=PA20 online at google books]: \"Ironically, many mainstream Mormons still believe plural marriage to be a law of the highest degree of heaven, simply in suspension until the millennium.\"</ref> This echoes earlier teachings by Brigham Young that the primary purpose of polygamy was to bring about the Millennium.<ref>John Cairncross, ''After polygamy was made a sin: the social history of Christian polygamy'', Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1974, {{ISBN|0-7100-7730-0}}, p. 181.</ref> Current official church materials do not make any mention of the future re-institution of plural marriage.\n\n====Multiple sealings when a prior spouse has died====\nIn the case where a man's first wife dies, and the man remarries, and both of the marriages involve a [[sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealing]], LDS authorities teach that in the afterlife, the man will enter a polygamous relationship with both wives.<ref>[[Charles W. Penrose]], ''\"Mormon\" Doctrine Plain and Simple, or Leaves from the Tree of Life'', 1897, Salt Lake City, p.66 (\"In the case of a man marrying a wife in the everlasting covenant who dies while he continues in the flesh and marries another by the same divine law, each wife will come forth in her order and enter with him into his glory.\"); [[Joseph Fielding Smith]], [[Bruce R. McConkie]], ed., ''Doctrines of Salvation'', 1956, vol. 2, p. 67 (Smith, who was sealed to two different women, stated, \"[M]y wives will be mine in the eternity.\"); [[Harold B. Lee]], ''Deseret News 1974 Church Almanac'', p. 17 (\"My lovely Joan was sent to me: So Joan joins Fern/That three might be, more fitted for eternity./'O Heavenly Father, my thanks to thee'.\").</ref> Apostle [[Dallin Oaks]] is an example of such a case.<ref>\"When I was 66, my wife June died of cancer. Two years later I married Kristen McMain, the eternal companion who now stands at my side.\" [https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2003/10/timing?lang=eng \"Timing\"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', October 2003.</ref>\n\nUnder LDS Church policy, a man whose sealed wife has died does not have to request any permission beyond having a current temple recommend and an interview with his bishop to get final permission for a living ordinance, to be married in the temple and sealed to another woman, unless the new wife's circumstance requires a cancellation of sealing. However, a woman whose sealed husband has died is still bound by the original sealing and must request a cancellation of sealing to be sealed to another man (see next paragraph for exception to this after she dies). In some cases, women in this situation who wish to remarry choose to be married to subsequent husbands in the temple \"for time only\", and are not sealed to them, leaving them sealed to their first husband for eternity.\n\nAs of 1998, however, women who have died may be sealed to more than one man. In 1998, the LDS Church created a new policy that a woman may also be sealed to more than one man. A woman, however, may not be sealed to more than one man while she is alive. She may only be sealed to subsequent partners after both she and her husband(s) have died.<ref name = CHOI>LDS Church, ''[[Church Handbook of Instructions]]'', (LDS Church, Salt Lake City, Utah, 1998) p. 72. \"A deceased woman may be sealed to all men to whom she was legally married during her life. However, if she was sealed to a husband during her life, all her husbands must be deceased before she can be sealed to a husband to whom she was not sealed during life.\"</ref> Thus, if a widow who was sealed to her first husband remarries, she may be sealed by proxy to all of her subsequent husband(s), but only after both she and the subsequent husbands have died. Proxy sealings, like proxy baptisms, are merely ''offered'' to the person in the afterlife, indicating that the purpose is to allow the woman to choose the right man to be sealed to. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n====Multiple sealings when marriages end in divorce====\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2012|talk=y}}\nA man who is sealed to a woman but later divorced must apply for a \"sealing clearance\" from the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] in order to be sealed to another woman. Receiving clearance does not void or invalidate the first sealing. A woman in the same circumstances would apply to the First Presidency for a \"cancellation of sealing\" (sometimes called a \"temple divorce\"), allowing her to be sealed to another man. This approval voids the original sealing as far as the woman is concerned. Divorced women who have not applied for a sealing cancellation are considered sealed to the original husband. However, it is generally believed that even in the afterlife the marriage relationship is voluntary, so no person could be forced into an eternal relationship through temple sealing that they do not wish to be in. Divorced women may also be granted a cancellation of sealing, even though they do not intend to marry someone else. In this case, they are no longer regarded as being sealed to anyone and are presumed to have the same eternal status as unwed women.\n\n====Proxy sealings where both spouses have died====\nAccording to church policy, after a man has died, he may be sealed by proxy to all of the women to whom he was legally married while he was alive. The same is true for women; however, if a woman was sealed to a man while she was alive, all of her husbands must be deceased before she can be sealed by proxy to them.<ref name = CHOI/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://help.familysearch.org/kb/UserGuide/en/policy/r_wws_policy_sealing_to_spouse_multiple_husbands.html|title=Help Center \u2014 FamilySearch.org|website=help.familysearch.org}}</ref>\n\nChurch doctrine is not entirely specific on the status of men or women who are sealed by proxy to multiple spouses. There are at least two possibilities:\n# Regardless of how many people a man or woman is sealed to by proxy, they will only remain with one of them in the afterlife, and that the remaining spouses, who might still merit the full benefits of exaltation that come from being sealed, would then marry another person in order to ensure each has an eternal marriage.\n# These sealings create effective plural marriages that will continue after death. There are no church teachings clarifying whether polyandrous relationships can exist in the afterlife, so some church members doubt whether this possibility would apply to women who are sealed by proxy to multiple spouses. The possibility for women to be sealed to multiple men is a recent policy change enacted in 1998. Church leaders have neither explained this change, nor its doctrinal implications.\n\n==Criticism of plural marriage==\n\n===Instances of unhappy plural marriage===\nCritics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that plural marriages produced unhappiness in some wives.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tanner|1979|pp=226\u2013228}}</ref> LDS historian Todd Compton, in his book ''[[In Sacred Loneliness]]'', described various instances where some wives in polygamous marriages were unhappy with polygamy.<ref name=\"Harvnb|Compton|1997\">{{Harvnb|Compton|1997}}</ref>\n\n===A means for male sexual gratification===\nCritics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that church leaders established the practice of polygamy in order to further their immoral desires for sexual gratification with multiple sexual partners.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tanner|1979|pp=204\u2013290}}</ref>  Critics point to the fact that church leaders practiced polygamy in secret from 1833 to 1852, despite a written church doctrine (Doctrine and Covenants 101, 1835 edition) renouncing polygamy and stating that only monogamous marriages were permitted.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tanner|1987|p=202}}</ref> Critics also cite several first-person accounts of early church leaders attempting to use the polygamy doctrine to enter into illicit relationships with women.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|1876|pp=65\u201386}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1842|pp=226\u2013232}}</ref> Critics also assert that Joseph Smith instituted polygamy in order to cover up an 1835 adulterous affair with a neighbor's daughter, [[Fanny Alger]], by taking Alger as his second wife.<ref>{{Harvnb|Abanes|2003|pp=132\u2013134}}</ref> Compton dates this marriage to March or April 1833, well before Joseph was accused of an affair.<ref>{{Harvnb|Compton|1996|pp=174\u2013207}}</ref> However, historian Lawrence Foster dismisses the marriage of Alger to Joseph Smith as \"debatable supposition\" rather than \"established fact\".<ref>[http://www.signaturebooks.com/reviews/insacred.htm \"Review of Todd Compton, ''In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith''\"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20060323034213/http://www.signaturebooks.com/reviews/insacred.htm |date=2006-03-23 }}, ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'' 33 (Spring 2001): 184\u201386</ref>\n\nOthers conclude that many Latter-day Saints entered into plural marriage based on the belief that it was a religious commandment, rather than as an excuse for sexual license. For instance, many of the figures who came to be best associated with plural marriage, including church president Brigham Young and his counselor [[Heber C. Kimball]], expressed revulsion at the system when it was first introduced to them. Young famously stated that after receiving the commandment to practice plural marriage in [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], he saw a funeral procession walking down the street and he wished he could exchange places with the corpse. He recalled that \"I was not desirous of shrinking from any duty, nor of failing in the least to do as I was commanded, but it was the first time in my life that I had desired the grave, and I could hardly get over it for a long time.\"<ref>[[Leonard J. Arrington]], ''[[Brigham Young: American Moses]]'', p. 100 (1985).</ref> When Kimball first heard of the principle, he believed that he would marry elderly women whom he would care for and who would not be a threat to his first wife Vilate.

Some sisters have had revelations that when this time passes away and they go through the veil every woman will have a husband to herself. ''I wish more of our young men would take to themselves wives of the daughters of Zion and not wait for us old men to take them all''; go-ahead upon the right principle young gentlemen and God bless you forever and ever and make you fruitful, that we may fill the mountains and then the earth with righteous inhabitants.}}\n\nThe precise number who participated in plural marriage is not known, but studies indicate a maximum of 20 to 25 percent of Latter-day Saint adults were members of polygamist households. One third of the women of marriageable age and nearly all of the church leadership were involved in the practice.<ref>''[[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]]''. Macmillan (1992) p. 1095.</ref>\n\n===Instances of coercion===\nCritics of polygamy in the early LDS Church have documented several cases where deception and coercion were used to induce marriage,<ref>{{Harvnb|Ostling|1999|pp=60\u201363}}</ref> for example citing the case of Joseph Smith who warned some potential spouses of eternal damnation if they did not consent to be his wife.<ref name=\"Harvnb|Compton|1997\"/> In 1893, married LDS Church member John D. Miles traveled to England and proposed to Caroline Owens, assuring her that he was not polygamous. She returned to Utah and participated in a wedding, only to find out after the ceremony that Miles was already married. She ran away, but Miles hunted her down and raped her. She eventually escaped, and filed a lawsuit against Miles that reached the Supreme Court and became a significant case in polygamy case law.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gage|1972}}</ref> [[Ann Eliza Young]], nineteenth wife of Brigham Young, claimed that Young coerced her to marry him by threatening financial ruin of her brother.<ref>{{Harvnb|Young|1875|pp=440\u2013454}}</ref>\n\n===Incestuous plural marriages===\nCritics of polygamy in the early LDS Church claim that polygamy was used to justify marriage of close relatives that would otherwise be considered immoral.<ref name=\"Abanes 2003 pp=297\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Young|1875|pp=306\u2013319}}</ref> In 1843, Joseph Smith's diary records the sealing of [[John Milton Bernhisel]] to his sister, Maria, in a ceremony that included the sealing of Bernhisel to multiple relatives, some of whom were deceased.<ref>{{Harvnb|Faulring|1987|p=424}}</ref> However, this is understood by most scholars as the collective sealing or binding of the family and not a marriage between Bernhisel and his sister. Similar family sealings are practiced in Latter-Day Saint temples today, where children of parents who were not sealed at the time of their marriage are sealed to their parents and to one another in a group ceremony.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books\n |1=Mormonism and polygamy\n}}\n{{Portal|Latter Day Saint movement}}\n* [[Criticism of the Latter Day Saint movement]]\n* [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and politics in the United States]]\n* [[Marriage in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]\n* [[Short Creek raid]]\n* ''[[Sister Wives]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{ref begin|40em}}\n*{{Cite book\n | last=Abanes\n | first=Richard\n | authorlink=Richard Abanes\n | title=One Nation Under Gods: A History of the Mormon Church\n | publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press\n | year=2003\n | isbn=1-56858-283-8\n | ref=harv\n}}\n*{{Cite journal\n |last        = Alexander\n |first       = Thomas G.\n |authorlink  = Thomas G.

Historically a [[Roman Catholic]] public school, St. Pat's opened in 1954 less than one block from its rival non-denominational public school, [[Queen Elizabeth High School; Halifax, NS|Queen Elizabeth High]] (QEH). St. Patrick's closed in 2007, merging with QEH to form [[Citadel High School]]. The school building was demolished in 2015.\n\n==History==\n=== Origins ===\nThe Roman Catholics of St. Patrick's Parish petitioned the government in 1846 for aid in educating their children, since most parents could not afford to pay school fees. However, free education did not come to Nova Scotia until the 1865 passage of the Nova Scotia Education Act. Classes for Catholics were subsequently established in the basement of [[St. Patrick's Church, Halifax|St. Patrick's Church]].<ref name=history11/>\n\nConditions in the basement were poor and a dedicated Saint Patrick's School opened on Lockman Street (now part of [[Barrington Street]]) in 1872. It contained ten classrooms supporting about 786 pupils. The high school was opened in the same overcrowded building in 1884, in response to an amendment of the Education Act that provided for high school education. The high school was moved to the Worrall Building, at the corner of Barrington Street and Proctor's Lane, in 1886.<ref name=history11/>\n\nThe Saint Patrick's Girls' School opened in 1888 nearby on Brunswick Street to help relieve overcrowding. It was a two-storey brick building with eleven classrooms, and had the highest enrolment in the province, at 1,033 students.<ref name=history11/> The Lockman Street school suffered a serious fire in 1898. The girls' school was dangerously overcrowded, and a new Saint Patrick's Girls' High School opened on Brunswick Street in 1907.<ref name=history11/>\n\nThe Saint Patrick's Boys' School on Lockman Street was condemned by the fire marshall in 1916. Land was obtained to build a new school, but construction was delayed by the outbreak of World War I. The [[Halifax Explosion]] of December 1917 heavily damaged all three Saint Patrick's Schools. The buildings were subsequently repaired at a cost of $44,641.<ref name=history11/> A new fireproof Boys' School opened in 1921 on Brunswick Street, and the original Saint Patrick's School was turned into a spice factory. Enrolment rose steadily during the early 20th century and various building extensions and annex buildings were used to accommodate the student population.<ref name=history11/>\n\n=== Founding and operating years ===\nIn 1944, the \"Post War Planning Committee\" of the school board placed a high priority on building a Roman Catholic high school in the city. The board moved to obtain the property of the old [[Saint Mary's University (Halifax)|Saint Mary's College]] at Quinpool Road and Windsor Street, after Saint Mary's moved to Robie Street. The high school students moved to the former Saint Mary's buildings while the new high school building was constructed on the former football field next door. Graduation ceremonies were temporarily held in the auditorium of nearby Queen Elizabeth High School.<ref name=history11/>\n\nThe new Saint Patrick's High School opened in September 1954 and a foundation stone was unveiled by Premier [[Harold Connolly]].<ref name=herald2>{{cite news|last1=Bennett|first1=Paul W.|title=Recalling St. Pat\u2019s, in and out of class|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/thenovascotian/1246297-recalling-st-pat-s-in-and-out-of-class|work=Halifax Chronicle-Herald|date=24 October 2014}}</ref> At the time of opening, it was hailed in the ''Halifax Mail-Star'' as a \"model high school\" and in a national magazine as one of \"the most modern and best-equipped schools\" in the country, and was the largest school in the country.<ref name=herald2/><ref name=history11/> The boys' and girls' high schools moved from their outdated premises, on Windsor Street and Brunswick Street respectively, into the modern new school. The library collection remained temporarily in the old Saint Mary's College building, and the new library did not open until 1955.<ref name=history11/>\n\nThe school building was designed by Downie, Baker and Ahern Architects-Engineers in a modernist style. The school auditorium had a full stage and seating for 1,060. The school was a strict Catholic institution in the early years, with boys and girls segregated and directed by separate principals.<ref name=herald2/> On 29 February 1968 the city purchased the former Saint Mary's College building, which was being rented out by the [[Maritime Conservatory of Performing Arts|Maritime Conservatory of Music]], for expansion of Saint Patrick's.<ref>{{cite web|title=Minutes|url=http://www.halifax.ca/archives/halifaxcityminutes/documents/102-1a-1968-02-27to1968-02-29p0143-0168.pdf|publisher=Halifax City Council|date=29 February 1968|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118130608/http://www.halifax.ca/archives/HalifaxCityMinutes/documents/102-1a-1968-02-27to1968-02-29p0143-0168.pdf|archive-date=18 November 2015|df=}}</ref> The Saint Mary's building was demolished and Saint Patrick's was expanded to the rear with an addition that opened in 1969.<ref name=herald1/><ref name=history11>{{cite book|last1=Hum|first1=R.

From the Heart of Black Nova Scotia]]'', produced by the [[National Film Board of Canada|National Film Board]] and directed by Halifax filmmaker [[Sylvia Hamilton]], profiled a group of black students at St. Patrick's as they explored their heritage and tried to build self-esteem.<ref name=ottawa>{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Janice|title=NFB film lets blacks explain their contribution to Canada|work=Ottawa Citizen|date=22 February 1993|page=B10}}</ref> The students in the film discuss racism in the community and confront hateful graffiti in the school washrooms.

The film was critically acclaimed and won several awards.<ref name=ottawa/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Cox|first1=Kevin|title=Black teen-agers reclaim their history|work=The Globe and Mail|date=11 February 1993}}</ref>\n\nSt. Pat's was traditionally known for its football, basketball, and soccer teams, musicals and music programs, and debating club. In 2005-06, St. Pat's celebrated their sole provincial sports victory in Girls' Curling. This was the first provincial Girls' Curling win for St. Pat's since 1976, when [[Colleen Jones]] played skip for the team. Also, the Girls Basketball team won the 2005/06, provincial girls championship. The St. Pat's football team won a provincial championship in 2001. first title in 30 years.  In January 2007, St. Pat's won the Dalhousie Debating Tournament.\n\n=== Closure ===\n[[File:St. Patrick's High School collapse.jpg|thumbnail|Damage following the 2015 roof collapse.]]\nWhile the school once had a population of 2,300 students, at which time students enjoying free periods would sometimes be forced onto the street to make room for lessons, it fell dramatically in population to less than 400 housed in an oversized building of {{convert|265000|sqft|sqm}}.<ref name=herald2/> St. Pat's High School was merged with QEH, beginning September 2007, to form [[Citadel High School]], at the former site of the Halifax [[Nova Scotia Community College]] campus.\n\nIn preparation for the merge of QEH and St. Pat's into Citadel High School, many of the music programs were combined to include members from both schools. These programs include the string orchestra, concert band, and Schola/Jazz chamber choir.\n\nAfter the high school closed, the St. Patrick's building was renamed Quinpool Education Centre, housing the Halifax All-City Music Centre and other educational and community programs. The underused building cost $400,000 a year to run at this time, and was called a \"poster child for wasteful inaction by local government\" by the ''Chronicle Herald'' in July 2014.<ref name=herald2/> The building was vacated in December 2013 and turned over to the city in preparation for demolition.<ref name=globalroof/>\n\nOn early March 27, 2015, a 500 square foot area of the roof of the 1960s section of the school building collapsed under the weight of snow and ice. The precast concrete exterior walls buckled, prompting the city to demolish a section of the walls to prevent another collapse. The tender to demolish the school was scheduled to close on April 7, but was extended so bidders could address any issues caused by the roof collapse.<ref name=globalroof>{{cite news|last1=Walsh|first1=Marieke|title=Roof collapses at old St. Patrick\u2019s High School in Halifax|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1907144/roof-collapses-at-old-st-patricks-high-school/|work=Global News|date=27 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=herald1>{{cite news|last1=Willick|first1=Frances|title=Vacant St. Patrick\u2019s High School roof collapses under snow|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/metro/1277075-vacant-st.-patrick%E2%80%99s-high-school-roof-collapses-under-snow|work=Halifax Chronicle-Herald|date=27 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nDemolition of the school began in August 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=St. Patrick's High School demolition begins in Halifax|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/st-patrick-s-high-school-demolition-begins-in-halifax-1.3193571|work=CBC News|date=17 August 2015}}</ref> It was complicated by the surprise discovery of asbestos that was not detected through pre-demolition testing.<ref>{{cite news|title=St. Patrick's High School demolition cost rises by 30%|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/st-patrick-s-high-school-demolition-cost-rises-by-30-1.3258501|work=CBC News|date=6 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Segregation controversy==\nIn 2006, St. Pat's Vice Principal Wade Smith, an African-Canadian, stirred up some controversy with his suggestion to establish an Africentric school in Nova Scotia.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=L|title=Blacks may need own school|work=Daily News|date=29 April 2006}}</ref> While the comment was initially an off-the-cuff remark, it was widely debated and generated strong feelings from both sides of the argument. His remark was made under questioning in an interview with [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]], and reported on by other media outlets. To some, such a move would represent a return to [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and the [[Jim Crow laws]] of the southern [[United States]]. Smith has indicated that this would not be the intent, saying that such a school would not exclude other races or ethnicities, but would simply focus on African-Canadian studies. He suggested that a change is needed because the current system is failing black students, many of whom receive low grades and are at increased risk of dropping out of school. He believed that an environment designed to cater to the special needs of African-Canadians would improve these results. Both the [[Halifax Regional School Board]] and the [[Nova Scotia Department of Education|Department of Education]] very quickly dismissed the concept.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Art Donahoe]], MLA, lawyer, and secretary general of the [[Commonwealth Parliamentary Association]]<ref name=herald2/>\n* [[Colleen Jones]], world championship curler<ref name=herald2/>\n* [[Paul Hollingsworth]], TSN anchor\n* [[Peter McGuigan]], local historian\n* [[Jonathan Torrens]], actor<ref name=herald2/>\n* Darrell Young, Stanley Cup Champion, Tampa Bay Lightning, 2004\n* [[Wendell Young]], Stanley Cup Champion, Pittsburg Penguins, 1991 and 1992\n\n==Musicals==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n*2007 -

Historically a [[Roman Catholic]] public school, St. Pat's opened in 1954 less than one block from its rival non-denominational public school, [[Queen Elizabeth High School; Halifax, NS|Queen Elizabeth High]] (QEH). St. Patrick's closed in 2007, merging with QEH to form [[Citadel High School]]. The school building was demolished in 2015.\n\n==History==\n=== Origins ===\nThe Roman Catholics of St. Patrick's Parish petitioned the government in 1846 for aid in educating their children, since most parents could not afford to pay school fees. However, free education did not come to Nova Scotia until the 1865 passage of the Nova Scotia Education Act. Classes for Catholics were subsequently established in the basement of [[St. Patrick's Church, Halifax|St. Patrick's Church]].<ref name=history11/>\n\nConditions in the basement were poor and a dedicated Saint Patrick's School opened on Lockman Street (now part of [[Barrington Street]]) in 1872. It contained ten classrooms supporting about 786 pupils. The high school was opened in the same overcrowded building in 1884, in response to an amendment of the Education Act that provided for high school education. The high school was moved to the Worrall Building, at the corner of Barrington Street and Proctor's Lane, in 1886.<ref name=history11/>\n\nThe Saint Patrick's Girls' School opened in 1888 nearby on Brunswick Street to help relieve overcrowding. It was a two-storey brick building with eleven classrooms, and had the highest enrolment in the province, at 1,033 students.<ref name=history11/> The Lockman Street school suffered a serious fire in 1898. The girls' school was dangerously overcrowded, and a new Saint Patrick's Girls' High School opened on Brunswick Street in 1907.<ref name=history11/>\n\nThe Saint Patrick's Boys' School on Lockman Street was condemned by the fire marshall in 1916. Land was obtained to build a new school, but construction was delayed by the outbreak of World War I. The [[Halifax Explosion]] of December 1917 heavily damaged all three Saint Patrick's Schools. The buildings were subsequently repaired at a cost of $44,641.<ref name=history11/> A new fireproof Boys' School opened in 1921 on Brunswick Street, and the original Saint Patrick's School was turned into a spice factory. Enrolment rose steadily during the early 20th century and various building extensions and annex buildings were used to accommodate the student population.<ref name=history11/>\n\n=== Founding and operating years ===\nIn 1944, the \"Post War Planning Committee\" of the school board placed a high priority on building a Roman Catholic high school in the city. The board moved to obtain the property of the old [[Saint Mary's University (Halifax)|Saint Mary's College]] at Quinpool Road and Windsor Street, after Saint Mary's moved to Robie Street. The high school students moved to the former Saint Mary's buildings while the new high school building was constructed on the former football field next door. Graduation ceremonies were temporarily held in the auditorium of nearby Queen Elizabeth High School.<ref name=history11/>\n\nThe new Saint Patrick's High School opened in September 1954 and a foundation stone was unveiled by Premier [[Harold Connolly]].<ref name=herald2>{{cite news|last1=Bennett|first1=Paul W.|title=Recalling St. Pat\u2019s, in and out of class|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/thenovascotian/1246297-recalling-st-pat-s-in-and-out-of-class|work=Halifax Chronicle-Herald|date=24 October 2014}}</ref> At the time of opening, it was hailed in the ''Halifax Mail-Star'' as a \"model high school\" and in a national magazine as one of \"the most modern and best-equipped schools\" in the country, and was the largest school in the country.<ref name=herald2/><ref name=history11/> The boys' and girls' high schools moved from their outdated premises, on Windsor Street and Brunswick Street respectively, into the modern new school. The library collection remained temporarily in the old Saint Mary's College building, and the new library did not open until 1955.<ref name=history11/>\n\nThe school building was designed by Downie, Baker and Ahern Architects-Engineers in a modernist style. The school auditorium had a full stage and seating for 1,060. The school was a strict Catholic institution in the early years, with boys and girls segregated and directed by separate principals.<ref name=herald2/> On 29 February 1968 the city purchased the former Saint Mary's College building, which was being rented out by the [[Maritime Conservatory of Performing Arts|Maritime Conservatory of Music]], for expansion of Saint Patrick's.<ref>{{cite web|title=Minutes|url=http://www.halifax.ca/archives/halifaxcityminutes/documents/102-1a-1968-02-27to1968-02-29p0143-0168.pdf|publisher=Halifax City Council|date=29 February 1968|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118130608/http://www.halifax.ca/archives/HalifaxCityMinutes/documents/102-1a-1968-02-27to1968-02-29p0143-0168.pdf|archive-date=18 November 2015|df=}}</ref> The Saint Mary's building was demolished and Saint Patrick's was expanded to the rear with an addition that opened in 1969.<ref name=herald1/><ref name=history11>{{cite book|last1=Hum|first1=R.

From the Heart of Black Nova Scotia]]'', produced by the [[National Film Board of Canada|National Film Board]] and directed by Halifax filmmaker [[Sylvia Hamilton]], profiled a group of black students at St. Patrick's as they explored their heritage and tried to build self-esteem.<ref name=ottawa>{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Janice|title=NFB film lets blacks explain their contribution to Canada|work=Ottawa Citizen|date=22 February 1993|page=B10}}</ref> The students in the film discuss racism in the community and confront hateful graffiti in the school washrooms.

In 2005-06, St. Pat's celebrated their sole provincial sports victory in Girls' Curling. This was the first provincial Girls' Curling win for St. Pat's since 1976, when [[Colleen Jones]] played skip for the team. Also, the Girls Basketball team won the 2005/06, provincial girls championship. The St. Pat's football team won a provincial championship in 2001. first title in 30 years.  In January 2007, St. Pat's won the Dalhousie Debating Tournament.\n\n=== Closure ===\n[[File:St. Patrick's High School collapse.jpg|thumbnail|Damage following the 2015 roof collapse.]]\nWhile the school once had a population of 2,300 students, at which time students enjoying free periods would sometimes be forced onto the street to make room for lessons, it fell dramatically in population to less than 400 housed in an oversized building of {{convert|265000|sqft|sqm}}.<ref name=herald2/> St. Pat's High School was merged with QEH, beginning September 2007, to form [[Citadel High School]], at the former site of the Halifax [[Nova Scotia Community College]] campus.\n\nIn preparation for the merge of QEH and St. Pat's into Citadel High School, many of the music programs were combined to include members from both schools. These programs include the string orchestra, concert band, and Schola/Jazz chamber choir.\n\nAfter the high school closed, the St. Patrick's building was renamed Quinpool Education Centre, housing the Halifax All-City Music Centre and other educational and community programs. The underused building cost $400,000 a year to run at this time, and was called a \"poster child for wasteful inaction by local government\" by the ''Chronicle Herald'' in July 2014.<ref name=herald2/> The building was vacated in December 2013 and turned over to the city in preparation for demolition.<ref name=globalroof/>\n\nOn early March 27, 2015, a 500 square foot area of the roof of the 1960s section of the school building collapsed under the weight of snow and ice. The precast concrete exterior walls buckled, prompting the city to demolish a section of the walls to prevent another collapse. The tender to demolish the school was scheduled to close on April 7, but was extended so bidders could address any issues caused by the roof collapse.<ref name=globalroof>{{cite news|last1=Walsh|first1=Marieke|title=Roof collapses at old St. Patrick\u2019s High School in Halifax|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/1907144/roof-collapses-at-old-st-patricks-high-school/|work=Global News|date=27 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=herald1>{{cite news|last1=Willick|first1=Frances|title=Vacant St. Patrick\u2019s High School roof collapses under snow|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/metro/1277075-vacant-st.-patrick%E2%80%99s-high-school-roof-collapses-under-snow|work=Halifax Chronicle-Herald|date=27 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nDemolition of the school began in August 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=St. Patrick's High School demolition begins in Halifax|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/st-patrick-s-high-school-demolition-begins-in-halifax-1.3193571|work=CBC News|date=17 August 2015}}</ref> It was complicated by the surprise discovery of asbestos that was not detected through pre-demolition testing.<ref>{{cite news|title=St. Patrick's High School demolition cost rises by 30%|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/st-patrick-s-high-school-demolition-cost-rises-by-30-1.3258501|work=CBC News|date=6 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Segregation controversy==\nIn 2006, St. Pat's Vice Principal Wade Smith, an African-Canadian, stirred up some controversy with his suggestion to establish an Africentric school in Nova Scotia.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=L|title=Blacks may need own school|work=Daily News|date=29 April 2006}}</ref> While the comment was initially an off-the-cuff remark, it was widely debated and generated strong feelings from both sides of the argument. His remark was made under questioning in an interview with [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]], and reported on by other media outlets. To some, such a move would represent a return to [[Racial segregation|segregation]] and the [[Jim Crow laws]] of the southern [[United States]]. Smith has indicated that this would not be the intent, saying that such a school would not exclude other races or ethnicities, but would simply focus on African-Canadian studies. He suggested that a change is needed because the current system is failing black students, many of whom receive low grades and are at increased risk of dropping out of school. He believed that an environment designed to cater to the special needs of African-Canadians would improve these results. Both the [[Halifax Regional School Board]] and the [[Nova Scotia Department of Education|Department of Education]] very quickly dismissed the concept.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Art Donahoe]], MLA, lawyer, and secretary general of the [[Commonwealth Parliamentary Association]]<ref name=herald2/>\n* [[Colleen Jones]], world championship curler<ref name=herald2/>\n* [[Paul Hollingsworth]], TSN anchor\n* [[Peter McGuigan]], local historian\n* [[Jonathan Torrens]], actor<ref name=herald2/>\n* Darrell Young, Stanley Cup Champion, Tampa Bay Lightning, 2004\n* [[Wendell Young]], Stanley Cup Champion, Pittsburg Penguins, 1991 and 1992\n\n==Musicals==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n*2007 - ''[[Urinetown]]''\n*2006 - ''[[Godspell]]''\n*2005 - ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]''\n*2004 - ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical play)|Little Shop of Horrors]]''\n*2003 - ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]''\n*2002 - ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''\n*2001 - ''[[The Pajama Game]]''\n*2000 - ''[[Gypsy: A Musical Fable|Gypsy]]''\n*1999 - ''[[Man of La Mancha]]''\n*1998 - ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''\n*1997 - ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]''\n*1996 - ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]''\n{{col-break}}\n*1995 - ''[[The Music Man]]''\n*1994 - ''[[Sweet Charity]]''\n*1993 - ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]''\n*1992 - ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]''\n*1991 - ''[[Godspell]]''\n*1990 - ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]''\n*1989 - ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]''\n*1988 - ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''\n*1987 - ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]''\n*1986 - ''[[Oklahoma!]]''\n*1985 - ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]\n*1984 - ''[[Oliver!]]\n*1962 -'' [[Leave it to Jane (musical)|Leave it to Jane]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|St. Patrick's High School (Halifax)}}\n* [http://st-pats.ednet.ns.ca/ Official website]\n* [http://st-pats.ednet.ns.ca/SPHMemories/index.html St. Patrick's High School Preservation Project]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Patrick's High School, Halifax}}\n[[Category:High schools in Halifax, Nova Scotia]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1955]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 2007]]\n[[Category:1955 establishments in Nova Scotia]]\n[[Category:2007 disestablishments in Nova Scotia]]\n", "name_user": "Will Sandberg", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Patrick%27s_High_School_(Halifax)"}

Finally, Greek Court, the McKimmon Conference and Training Center, and student park-and-ride areas are found on South Campus. North and Central Campus are separated by the [[North Carolina Railroad]]. Pedestrian tunnels allow students to commute between campuses. Central and South Campuses are separated by Western Boulevard, a major downtown artery. University Housing divides Main Campus into West, Central, and East Campus for residence hall purposes. West and Central campuses are divided by Dan Allen Drive, while Central and East are divided by Morill Drive and [[Reynolds Coliseum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsu.edu/facilities/campus_history/index.htm|title=Campus History|publisher=NC State Facilities Division|accessdate=May 25, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509011224/http://www.ncsu.edu/facilities/campus_history/index.htm|archive-date=May 9, 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pulstar2.jpg|thumb|right|175px|NC State's [[Pulstar (nuclear reactor)|PULSTAR]] Reactor is a 1 MW pool-type [[nuclear reactor|nuclear]] [[research reactor]].]]Architecturally, Main Campus is known for its distinctive red brick buildings.
