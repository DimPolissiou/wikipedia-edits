[[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] from 1944 to 1991 and 1990 respectively, replacing \"[[The Internationale]]\". Its original lyrics were written by [[Sergey Mikhalkov]] (1913\u20132009) in collaboration with [[Gabriel El-Registan]] (1899\u20131945), and its music composed by [[Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov|Alexander Alexandrov]] (1883\u20131946). Following a two decade interval in which the anthem was performed without lyrics a second set of lyrics, also written by Mikhalov, were adopted in 1977.\n\nAlthough Russia [[Patrioticheskaya Pesnya|adopted a new anthem]] in 1990 and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union was dissolved]] in December 1991, the Soviet-era melody was restored with new lyrics (once again written by Mikhalkov) in 2000, and has been used since in the second version of the [[State Anthem of the Russian Federation|Russian anthem]].\n\n==History==\n=== Origins ===\nThe anthem's music was originally composed by [[Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov|Alexander Alexandrov]] around 1938 for the [[Hymn of the Bolshevik Party]].

Alexandrov himself has described it as the combination of a [[march (music)|march]] with [[Russian traditional music]], particularly that of ''[[bylina]]'' epic songs. The anthem shares several chord progressions with [[Vasily Kalinnikov]]'s overture ''Bylina, Epic Poem'' (which, as its name indicates, is also inspired by the ''[[bylina]]'' tradition).<ref name=\"rodina\">\u0410. \u041a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0446. \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d \u0438 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432: \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u044b\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430. // \u0420\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430. \u2116 3 \u0437\u0430 2002 \u0433.</ref> There also exist similarities between Alexandrov's anthem and [[Robert Schumann]]'s ''Fr\u00fchlingsfahrt''.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://old.russ.ru/culture/kursiv/20001207.html |script-title=ru:\u0412\u0430\u0445\u0438\u0442 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u043a\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0432. \u0414\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0444\u0438\u043d \u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430. \u0417\u0430\u043f\u043b\u044b\u0432 #1 |script-magazine=ru:[[\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b]] |date=2000-12-07 |access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Communist International]] (Comintern) was dissolved in 1943 in order for the Soviet Union to maintain its alliance with the other [[Allies of World War II]], a new composition was needed to replace \"[[The Internationale]]\" as the national anthem.

The poets [[Sergey Mikhalkov]] and [[Gabriel El-Registan]] were chosen by Stalin's staffers, called to [[Moscow]], and given the task of writing lyrics which referenced not only the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]], but also \"a Country of Soviets\". The first draft was completed overnight.\n\nThe anthem was first published on 7 November 1943.

As a result, a few different versions were produced.<ref>[http://www.hymn.ru/#related-to-glinka-anthem II. \u0421\u0432\u044f\u0437\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441 \u0433\u0438\u043c\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0413\u043b\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0438] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20120801193920/http://www.hymn.ru/ |date=August 1, 2012 }}</ref> In late 2000, the current [[national anthem of Russia]] was introduced, which uses the music of the Soviet national anthem with new lyrics by [[Sergey Mikhalkov]].\n\n===State Union of Russia and Belarus===\nThe same music was used for a proposed anthem for the [[Union State|State Union of Russia and Belarus]], entitled ''Derzhavny Soyuz Narodov'' (\"[[Sovereign Union of Nations]]\"). Its lyrics were not tied to any specific nationality, and there were official versions in the languages of every Soviet republic and several other [[languages of the Soviet Union|Soviet languages]]; thus it could have been adopted by a [[Commonwealth of Independent States|broader union]]. However, it was never officially adopted, and there appear to be no plans to utilize it in any official role.\n\n=== Decommunization ===\nIn some [[post-Soviet states]] which adopted [[decommunization]] laws [[Bans on Communist symbols|banning Communist symbolism]], performing the Soviet anthem is illegal. For example, [[Decommunization in Ukraine|since 2015, offenders in Ukraine]] face up to five years in prison.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.segodnya.ua/politics/pnews/net-sssr-simvolika-ostanetsya-v-chastnyh-kollekciyah-a-iz-tematicheskih-kafe-plakaty-uberut-616371.html|title=\u0417\u0430 \u0433\u0438\u043c\u043d \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 - 5 \u043b\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u044e\u0440\u044c\u043c\u044b: \u0434\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0443\u043d\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0446\u0438\u0444\u0440\u0430\u0445 \u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0430\u0445|publisher=}}</ref> Similar laws were adopted in [[Latvia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20130621/181788657/Latvia-Bans-Soviet-Nazi-Symbols.html|title=Latvia Bans Soviet, Nazi Symbols|last=Sputnik|website=en.ria.ru}}</ref> and [[Lithuania]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7459976.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Lithuanian ban on Soviet symbols|publisher=|date=2008-06-17}}</ref>\n\n===Other===\nThe anthem has also been used sometimes for humour and memes related to communism on the Internet.{{original research?|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe variation on the anthem, with comical lyrics, was used during the opening of the second series of the [[BBC]] comedy sketch show [[Harry and Paul]], starring [[Harry Enfield]] and [[Paul Whitehouse]]. The opening montage being a parody of [[Cold War]] era [[Soviet propaganda]] films, with Enfield and Whitehouse portraying aging [[Soviet Presidents]].\n\n== Official translations ==\nThe anthem has been officially translated into several languages:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

[[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] from 1944 to 1991 and 1990 respectively, replacing \"[[The Internationale]]\". Its original lyrics were written by [[Sergey Mikhalkov]] (1913\u20132009) in collaboration with [[Gabriel El-Registan]] (1899\u20131945), and its music composed by [[Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov|Alexander Alexandrov]] (1883\u20131946). Following a two decade interval in which the anthem was performed without lyrics a second set of lyrics, also written by Mikhalov, were adopted in 1977.\n\nAlthough Russia [[Patrioticheskaya Pesnya|adopted a new anthem]] in 1990 and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union was dissolved]] in December 1991, the Soviet-era melody was restored with new lyrics (once again written by Mikhalkov) in 2000, and has been used since in the second version of the [[State Anthem of the Russian Federation|Russian anthem]].\n\n==History==\n=== Origins ===\nThe anthem's music was originally composed by [[Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov|Alexander Alexandrov]] around 1938 for the [[Hymn of the Bolshevik Party]].

Alexandrov himself has described it as the combination of a [[march (music)|march]] with [[Russian traditional music]], particularly that of ''[[bylina]]'' epic songs. The anthem shares several chord progressions with [[Vasily Kalinnikov]]'s overture ''Bylina, Epic Poem'' (which, as its name indicates, is also inspired by the ''[[bylina]]'' tradition).<ref name=\"rodina\">\u0410. \u041a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0446. \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d \u0438 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432: \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u044b\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430. // \u0420\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430. \u2116 3 \u0437\u0430 2002 \u0433.</ref> There also exist similarities between Alexandrov's anthem and [[Robert Schumann]]'s ''Fr\u00fchlingsfahrt''.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://old.russ.ru/culture/kursiv/20001207.html |script-title=ru:\u0412\u0430\u0445\u0438\u0442 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u043a\u044b\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0432. \u0414\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0444\u0438\u043d \u0438 \u0440\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0430\u043b\u043a\u0430. \u0417\u0430\u043f\u043b\u044b\u0432 #1 |script-magazine=ru:[[\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b]] |date=2000-12-07 |access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Communist International]] (Comintern) was dissolved in 1943 in order for the Soviet Union to maintain its alliance with the other [[Allies of World War II]], a new composition was needed to replace \"[[The Internationale]]\" as the national anthem.

The poets [[Sergey Mikhalkov]] and [[Gabriel El-Registan]] were chosen by Stalin's staffers, called to [[Moscow]], and given the task of writing lyrics which referenced not only the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]], but also \"a Country of Soviets\". The first draft was completed overnight.\n\nThe anthem was first published on 7 November 1943. It was played for the first time on Soviet radio at midnight on 1 January 1944, and officially adopted on 15 March the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hymn.ru/anthem-sovietunion-1943.html|title=Gimn Soyuza Sovetskikh Sotsialisticheskikh Respublik (Stalinsky) |website=Museum of Russian Anthems |script-title=ru:\u0413\u0438\u043c\u043d \u0421\u043e\u044e\u0437\u0430 \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0420\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a (\u00ab\u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\u00bb)|trans-title=Anthem of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Stalin's)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420075009/http://www.hymn.ru/anthem-sovietunion-1943.html|archive-date=20 April 2016|access-date=5 February 2018}}</ref> The new lyrics had three refrains following three different stanzas.

The varying refrains were replaced by a uniform refrain after all stanzas, and the line praising Stalin was dropped, as were the lines referring to the Great Patriotic War.

Born in 1885 the [[Cape Colony]], in her infancy her family moved to [[Johannesburg]], where she completed her secondary education. After earning an undergraduate degree in 1906 from [[South African College]], she went abroad, studying at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]], [[Leipzig University]], the [[University of Bonn]], and the [[College of Sorbonne|Sorbonne]]. Returning to South Africa in 1912, she undertook anthropological research among the [[Khoekhoe|Khoekhoe people]], until she married in 1914.\n\nAfter living in [[Boston]] from 1914 to 1920, Hoernl\u00e9 returned to South Africa to resume her research. She partnered with [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]] in a collaborative effort to establish [[social anthropology]] as an academic discipline in South Africa. In 1926, she began working as an academic, and built both a library and ethnological museum to facilitate her students' learning. Introducing innovative teaching ideals, she encouraged her students to evaluate social change, as well as the roles of women in society. Retiring from teaching in 1937, she focused on social reforms for the remainder of her life. Her anthropological studies and teaching had informed her world view and Hoernl\u00e9 became an opponent of separatist Apartheid policies. She argued in reports submitted to the government that all cultures which were part of the greater single society of South Africa had intrinsic value and that no race was superior. She espoused protection of fundamental principles such as equal opportunity without conditions of race and colour, freedom of conscience and expression, and the [[rule of law]] for all Africans.\n\nIn her lifetime, Hoernl\u00e9 was honoured with numerous awards for both her academic work and her social reform programs. She was awarded an honourary [[Doctor of Law]]s in 1945, which recognized both aspects of her career. She is remembered for having trained most of the leading South African anthropologists of her era and for having laid the foundations for the development of social anthropology in South Africa.\n\n==Early life==\nAgnes Winifred Tucker was born on 6 December 1885 in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] in the [[Cape Colony]] of the [[British Empire]]{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=138}} to Sarah Agnes (n\u00e9e Bottomley) and William Kidger Tucker.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=19}}{{sfn|Spencer|2001|p=304}} The second child in a family of eight children, they relocated to [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]] soon after her birth.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=138}}{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=19}} Her father was a surveyor and miner, and moved the family soon after [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush|gold was discovered]] near Witwatersrand. He would later become mayor of Johannesburg and a [[Senate of South Africa|federal Senator]] of [[Transvaal (province)|Transvaal]].{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=19}} Tucker was a sickly child and suffered from diphtheria, measles, and pneumonia, which left her with a life-long susceptibility to [[bronchitis]].{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=138}} Her father, who supported women's education, kept her supplied with books to read when she was confined.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=138}}{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=19}}\n\nTucker attended [[Barnato Park High School|Fanny Buckland School]], but at the beginning of the [[Second Boer War]] was evacuated with her family to East London. When the returned to South Africa in 1900, she studied at the Wesleyan High School for Girls in [[Grahamstown]], graduating in 1902.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=138}} Wanting to become a teacher, with encouragement from her father, Tucker enrolled the following year at [[Cape Town]]'s [[South African College]], (later the [[University of Cape Town]]),{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=19}} studying the [[classics]], French, and philosophy.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=138}} Becoming a \"star student\", she won prizes in both English and philosophy,{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=21}} and became the first and only female to serve on the [[student council]] in 1906.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=22}}{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=139}} Because a spinal nerve condition impacted her ability to write, she used a typewriter, an [[amanuensis]], and was given an extra time to write her bachelor's examinations, which she passed with honours.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=139}} \n\nInfluenced by her philosophy professor, [[Thomas Loveday (university administrator)|Thomas Loveday]], Tucker decided to continue her studies at Cambridge.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=22}} Before she left South Africa, Tucker met [[R. F. Alfred Hoernl\u00e9|Reinhold Friedrich Alfred Hoernl\u00e9]], who had been appointed a philosophy professor at South African College in 1908.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=29}} Upon receipt of the Porter Scholarship, which provided her with a three-year funding of \u00a3150 annually, she enrolled in [[Newnham College]] in 1908.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=139}} Studying anthropology and philosophy under [[Alfred Cort Haddon]] and [[W. H. R. Rivers]], she attended lectures by [[James George Frazer]] and [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]] and worked in [[Charles Samuel Myers]]' laboratory.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=23}} As there was no diploma available for anthropology at that time at Cambridge, Tucker did not sit for exams when she finished her studies in 1910.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=139}}{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=23}} Moving to [[Leipzig University]] in 1911, she studied under [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and then with his student and [[Structuralism (psychology)|structural psychologist]], [[Oswald K\u00fclpe]], at the [[University of Bonn]].{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=23}}{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=215}} Tucker completed her education with studies under [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], founder of the academic discipline of [[sociology]] in 1912 at the [[College of Sorbonne|Sorbonne]] in Paris.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=23}}\n\n==Career==\n===Fieldwork and domestic life (1912\u20131922)===\nReturning to South Africa in 1912, Tucker applied to replace \"Alfred\" Hoernl\u00e9 as philosophy chair at the South African College. Though he had moved to [[Durham University]], the selection committee at the College asked Alfred to explain to Tucker that she was unsuitable because of her gender.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=30}}{{sfn|Carstens|1985|p=18}} Rekindling their acquaintance, the two became correspondents. When she turned down the selection committee's offer of an unpaid lectureship,{{sfn|Bank|2016|pp=29\u201330}} she was awarded college's Croll Scholarship to enable research among the [[Khoekhoe|Khoekhoe people]]. She made two expeditions, one to [[Richtersveld]] and the other to [[Berseba]] between 1912 and 1913,{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=140}} taking notes on the [[Nama people|Nama]] and [[San people]] along the [[Orange River|Orange]] and [[Kuiseb River]]s. She encountered many difficulties traveling from communities in a horse-drawn wagon,{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=140}}{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=26}} and more difficulties trying to gain consent for her to measure the limbs of her subjects, test them for colour perception,{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=27}} or relate to her general cultural information.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=28}} Though her field work was supposed to last for three years,{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=26}} in 1913, Tucker accepted a proposal of marriage from Alfred, resigned her scholarship, and joined him in the UK in 1914.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=26}}{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=141}}\n\nThe couple married in [[Oxford]] and in April 1914, moved to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where Alfred had taken a post as a philosophy professor and chair at [[Harvard University]].{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=30}}{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=141}} Their only child, Alwin, was born in 1915 and Hoernl\u00e9 spent the majority of her time in domestic pursuits while in the United States, though she did contribute an article \"Certain Rites of Transition and Conception of ''!Nau'' among the Hottentots\" to the journal ''Harvard African Studies''{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=141}}{{sfn|Bank|2016|pp=30\u201331}} in 1918. The work represented the first time that [[Van Gennep]]'s model on [[rites of passage]] had been applied to ethnographic data in southern Africa.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=32}} The severe winters in Boston caused repeated bronchial problems for Hoernl\u00e9 and in October 1920, she returned to Johannesburg. She lived with her parents,{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=33}} while Alfred remained in Boston for two more years.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=141}} \n\nIn 1921, Hoernl\u00e9 became a founding member of the publication committee of the journal ''[[African Studies (journal)|Bantu Studies]]'' and would be the only woman to serve on the editorial board until the 1930s.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=141}}{{sfn|Bank|2016|pp=34\u201335}} She planned an expedition to [[South West Africa]] for December 1922. In the planning stages the month preceding her trip, she met with Radcliffe-Brown, who encouraged her to abandon physical examination of her subjects and focus on collecting data related to kinship.{{sfn|Bank|2016|pp=34\u201335}} The trip was sponsored by the government and was intended to provide evidence of the need to establish [[Bantustan|segregated land reserves]] for the rural Nama people. South Africa had recently acquired the [[League of Nations mandate]] to govern the former [[German South West Africa|German colony]], after German losses in [[World War I]] and five years of military rule. Instead of evaluating rural environments, Hoernl\u00e9's report focused on urban Nama and their grievances over taxation by authorities and missionaries in the shift of government. Dismissing her report as irrelevant, the government implemented land reserves as an official policy in 1923.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=36}}\n\n===University faculty (1923\u20131937)===\nIn 1921, the [[University of Cape Town]] had hired Radcliffe-Brown as the first full professor of [[social anthropology]] at any British university throughout the empire.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=37}}{{sfn|Fortes|1956}} He and Hoernl\u00e9 carried out extensive correspondence regarding the formation of the new academic field of study and how it should be structured as a scientific discipline in South Africa.{{sfn|Bank|2016|pp=37\u201338}} In 1922, Alfred was offered the post to head the philosophy department at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] and as an inducement to secure him, the university offered to hire his wife as a researcher and develop a social anthropology department. Hired in 1923,{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=37}}{{sfn|Gluckman|Schapera|1960|p=262}} Hoernl\u00e9 and Brown's correspondence confirms that they were jointly working through 1924 on several joint papers on ancestry and marriage rites, cattle, [[joking relationship]]s, kinship terms, and sacrifice rituals.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=40}} His decision to accept the position at the [[University of Sydney]] as head of the social anthropology department in 1925,{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=45}} led Hoernl\u00e9 to abandon her field research in favor of teaching.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=37}}{{sfn|Gluckman|Schapera|1960|p=262}} \n\nHoernl\u00e9 was appointed as a [[lecturer]] in January 1926 at the University of the Witwatersrand.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=45}} As early as 1912, she had given lectures arguing that primitive or indigenous people had the same mental capacity as more sophisticated members of society, that their cultures should be examined with empathy and consideration of their perspective, and that social organization played a major role in which societies survived and which societies failed.{{sfn|Gordon|1987|p=70}} Her teaching style was \"stimulating and thorough\", and she inspired her students, \"among the first in the field\" to research cultural contacts and the problems associated with social change.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=141}} She taught her students that traditional cultures were not separately operated and contained societies, but instead part of the greater single society of South Africa and dynamic. Her views and those of her students who followed her lead were increasingly at odds with Afrikaner anthropologists and the later apartheid government, who accepted a static, [[Primitive culture|primitivist model]] of traditional cultures.{{sfn|James|Plaice|Toren|2010|p=172}} \n\nHoernl\u00e9 challenged her students with innovative theories which laid the groundwork for development of the field of social anthropology.{{sfn|Gordon|1987|p=68}} She encouraged them to observe and preserve social and cultural aspects of women's lives. [[Dora Earthy]], a missionary in [[Mozambique]], wrote a unique monograph focused solely on [[Makuleke tribe|Valenge women]], but other students incorporated information on female rituals within the family into their works, including initiation rites and those associated with marriage and conjugal relations.{{sfn|Gaitskell|1983|p=3}} Their studies caused her students to compare the lives of indigenous women with the restrictions placed on Western women, and they discovered African women did not typically have the same social curtailments.{{sfn|Gaitskell|1983|p=4}}\n\nIn addition to her focus on building an anthropological department, Hoernl\u00e9 created a library and an archaeological specimen and cultural museum, to facilitate her students' studies.{{sfn|Gluckman|Schapera|1960|p=262}}{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=47}} To ensure that her students had a thorough grounding she sent her best pupils to the [[London School of Economics]] to study ethnographic field work methods and [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] with [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]].{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=57}} As an external examiner on anthropological theses, Hoernl\u00e9 came in contact with [[Isaac Schapera]] in 1925. He used her early research in his thesis and upon his graduation, they worked together to promote social anthropology grounded in field work.{{sfn|Bank|2016|pp=54\u201355}} She took a leave and went to study with Malinowski herself in 1929.{{sfn|Bank|2016|pp=56\u201357}}{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=203}} \n\nWhile she was gone, Schapera taught Hoernl\u00e9's classes and from her return in 1930, they collaborated together on the Inter-University African Studies Committee.{{sfn|Bank|2016|pp=56\u201357}}{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=203}} In their work, they shaped the committee in developing a national project to further ethnographic studies through adequate funding and cooperation among scholars throughout the continent.{{sfn|Bank|2016|pp=58\u201359, 63}} Hoernl\u00e9 was promoted to senior lecturer in 1934.{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=215}} Under her guidance, pioneering urban anthropological studies were undertaken in South Africa and first published in 1935.{{sfn|Gordon|1987|p=71}}{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=62}} That year, ''Bantu Studies'' dedicated their September 1935 issue as a \"homage to Winifred Hoernl\u00e9\"{{sfn|Gordon|1987|p=68}}{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=203}} and she was granted the unusual distinction of being \"made an Honorary Fellow of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Anthropological Institute]]\".{{sfn|Gluckman|Schapera|1960|p=263}} She resigned from her post in 1937 to care for she and Alfred's aging parents.{{sfn|Gluckman|Schapera|1960|p=262}}\n\n===Social activism (1932\u20131960)===\nDuring her time at university in Cape Town, Hoernl\u00e9 (Tucker at the time) had begun developing a liberal attitude toward race relations. Differing from her father's view, she believed that educated Africans should be able to vote.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=22}} In her field work, she developed empathy for the people she was studying, especially in urban communities, because her fluency in [[Afrikaans]], English, and German allowed a more intimate communication with her subjects.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=37}} By 1932, when she joined the Committee of the Johannesburg Child Welfare Society, Hoernl\u00e9 had developed not only a commitment to justice, but a sense of responsibility for social service.{{sfn|Krige|1960|pp=142\u2013143}} She served as president in 1938 and 1939 of the National Women's Organisation and upon her husband's death in 1943, became president of the [[South African Institute of Race Relations]] for two years,{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=60}}{{sfn|Richards|1961|p=53}} serving subsequent terms from 1948 to 1950 and from 1953 to 1954.{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=215}} \n\nRapid industrialization and urbanization in the 1930s and 1940s challenged the existing systems of legal jurisdiction in South Africa, which had formerly allowed rural people to indirectly govern themselves. As people moved in large numbers to urban areas to work in factories, security became a major issue, as did fear of crime.{{sfn|Gillespie|2011|pp=503\u2013504}} Several commissions \u2014 Elliot Commission (1943), the [[Fagan Commission]] (1946), and the [[Sauer Commission]] (1947) \u2013 each attempted to deal with crime, laws regulating mobile populations, and potential threats to the communities.{{sfn|Gillespie|2011|p=509}} During this period, Hoernl\u00e9 became a vocal advocate of liberal [[universalism]].{{sfn|Gillespie|2011|p=505}} In 1945, she was appointed as one of the founding members of the Penal and Prisons Reform Commission.{{sfn|Gillespie|2011|p=509}} The commission became an important sounding board for conceptualising ideas about race in a reform-minded platform incorporating paternalistic models of governance.{{sfn|Gillespie|2011|p=515}} The commission later became the Penal Reform League of South Africa and she served as its president for many years.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=143}}\n\nHoernl\u00e9 was one of the most prominent activists in social welfare campaigns in the period, stressing the need for collaboration between African, Indian and white women. She helped establish clinics for mothers; improved educational facilities and welfare services for children; and worked on penal reform.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=60}} Concerned for the depressed conditions in Indian communities, she opened the first schools for Indian girls{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=143}} and chaired the Committee of the Indian Social Welfare Association.{{sfn|Richards|1961|p=53}} In 1949, Hoernl\u00e9 was given an [[Honorary degree|honourary]] [[Doctor of Law|Doctorate of Laws]] from the University of the Witwatersrand in recognition to her contributions to academics and social welfare.{{#tag:ref|Bank notes the significance of the degree being in law rather than anthropology, suggesting her importance in social reform{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=60}} and Gordon wrote that her moral stances were as important to her legacy as her academic contributions.{{sfn|Gordon|1987|p=72}} |group=\"Notes\"}} That year, the National Welfare Board appointed her as a member and her contributions to the Landsdown Penal Reform Commission Report were presented. They would be one \"of the most important sections of the Commission's Report\". In 1952, Hoernl\u00e9 was honored by the International Council for Child Welfare with with their Medal of Merit and was recognized with a medal for her service to Africa by the [[Royal African Society]].{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=143}} After the [[Bantu Education Act, 1953]] was enacted, she worked to reform its repressive language{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=60}} and argued that educational systems which did not take into consideration social customs practiced within communities estranged students from their communities.{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=201}} In 1955, the journal ''Race Relations'' of the South African Institute of Race Relations published a special issue to commemorate her 70th birthday.{{sfn|Gordon|1987|p=68}}\n\n==Racial views and \"Christian Trusteeship\"==\nFrom 1923, Hoernl\u00e9 wrote that to be successful in implementing change and European-style administration among traditional populations, officials needed \"a sound knowledge of the outlook and beliefs of the natives\".{{sfn|Webster|2017|p=20}} She recognized that because the mechanisms of power in South Africa favored white society, white culture was dominant.{{sfn|James|Plaice|Toren|2010|p=79}} In her 1948 article, ''Alternatives to Apartheid'', Hoernl\u00e9 argued any solution implemented to control racial relations must protect fundamental principles such as equal opportunity without conditions of race and colour, freedom of conscience and expression, and the [[rule of law]]. While she acknowledged that traditional societies and western civilization might each have reasons to protect their culture and racial purity, Hoernl\u00e9 wrote that no race was superior and each should mutually respect each other, by guaranteeing to protect the fundamental principles. Stating that if assimilation was unlikely, implementation of [[Apartheid]] required granting sovereign independence to traditional societies.{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=220}} By implementing such a plan, she reasoned societies could develop [[separate but equal]] institutions and customs which allowed each group to govern themselves and share the fundamental tenets of citizenship.{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=221}} \n\nHowever, Hoernl\u00e9 reiterated that the test of commitment to basic rights was to recognize that they applied to people who had previously followed different traditions, but were now members of a society that had such principles. She argued that failing to recognize that they were all one society and attempting to create separate but equal facilities would damage the economy, as well as humanity.{{sfn|Gillespie|2011|p=507}} Her seemingly contradictory approaches recognized that the situation was complex and might require utilizing various methods and policies in a period of \"Christian Trusteeship\" to reach solutions that supported the ethical beliefs of the society and provided stewardship to indigenous members who were part of that society.{{sfn|Gillespie|2011|p=508}} Along with other academics, many of whom were her former students, she was in favor of assimilation of all races into one society. {{sfn|James|Plaice|Toren|2010|p=48}} In 1952, amid political unrest and pressure from black activists, Hoernl\u00e9 joined twenty-one other white liberals in issuing a statement calling upon the government to support equal rights and equal opportunities for \"educated, politically conscious non-Europeans\".{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=221}} \n\n==Death and Legacy==\nHoernl\u00e9 died on 17 March 1960 in Johannesburg.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=138}}{{sfn|Gluckman|Schapera|1960|p=262}} After her death, her contributions were obscured by scholars who claimed her scholarship was directed by Radcliffe-Brown and her social involvement was an extension of husband's work.{{sfn|Carstens|1985|p=17-18}} Letters from Radcliffe-Brown, make clear that Hoernl\u00e9's work was original scholarship{{sfn|Carstens|1985|p=17}} and though she and Alfred were both liberals, her ideas about social reforms differed from and predated her relationship with him.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=22}}{{sfn|Carstens|1985|p=18}}  According to Robert Gordon, professor of anthropology at the [[University of Vermont]], \"she was the first trained female social anthropologist in the world\".{{sfn|Gordon|1987|p=70}}{{sfn|Carstens|1985|p=17}} Historian Andrew Bank, of the [[University of the Western Cape]] has said that she was the central figure in the development of social anthropology in South Africa in the [[interwar period]] because she introduced a collaborative \"series of methodological innovations that led to the creation of a professional, scientific, and... field-based ethnographic tradition\".{{sfn|Bank|2016|pp=18\u201319}} Coupled with her influence upon the students who studied under her and whom she mentored, which included [[Max Gluckman]], [[Ellen Hellmann]], [[Eileen Krige]], [[Hilda Kuper]], [[Audrey Richards]], and [[Monica Wilson]], among others, she shaped the field of social anthropology in South Africa.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=18}}{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=214}} She has often been called the \"Mother of Social Anthropology in South Africa\",{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=214}}{{sfn|Carstens|1985|p=17}} as most of the leading South African anthropologists of her era trained with her.{{sfn|Richards|1961|p=53}} Her tenure marked a shift in the makeup of scientists studying social anthropology, from a male-dominated field, to one where women were at the forefront.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=63}}\n\n==Selected works==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Hoernl\u00e9 |first1=A.

Born in 1885 the [[Cape Colony]], in her infancy her family moved to [[Johannesburg]], where she completed her secondary education. After earning an undergraduate degree in 1906 from [[South African College]], she went abroad, studying at [[Newnham College, Cambridge]], [[Leipzig University]], the [[University of Bonn]], and the [[College of Sorbonne|Sorbonne]]. Returning to South Africa in 1912, she undertook anthropological research among the [[Khoekhoe|Khoekhoe people]], until she married in 1914.\n\nAfter living in [[Boston]] from 1914 to 1920, Hoernl\u00e9 returned to South Africa to resume her research. She partnered with [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]] in a collaborative effort to establish [[social anthropology]] as an academic discipline in South Africa. In 1926, she began working as an academic, and built both a library and ethnological museum to facilitate her students' learning. Introducing innovative teaching ideals, she encouraged her students to evaluate social change, as well as the roles of women in society. Retiring from teaching in 1937, she focused on social reforms for the remainder of her life. Her anthropological studies and teaching had informed her world view and Hoernl\u00e9 became an opponent of separatist Apartheid policies. She argued in reports submitted to the government that all cultures which were part of the greater single society of South Africa had intrinsic value and that no race was superior. She espoused protection of fundamental principles such as equal opportunity without conditions of race and colour, freedom of conscience and expression, and the [[rule of law]] for all Africans.\n\nIn her lifetime, Hoernl\u00e9 was honoured with numerous awards for both her academic work and her social reform programs. She was awarded an honourary [[Doctor of Law]]s in 1945, which recognized both aspects of her career. She is remembered for having trained most of the leading South African anthropologists of her era and for having laid the foundations for the development of social anthropology in South Africa.\n\n==Early life==\nAgnes Winifred Tucker was born on 6 December 1885 in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] in the [[Cape Colony]] of the [[British Empire]]{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=138}} to Sarah Agnes (n\u00e9e Bottomley) and William Kidger Tucker.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=19}}{{sfn|Spencer|2001|p=304}} The second child in a family of eight children, they relocated to [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]] soon after her birth.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=138}}{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=19}} Her father was a surveyor and miner, and moved the family soon after [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush|gold was discovered]] near Witwatersrand. He would later become mayor of Johannesburg and a [[Senate of South Africa|federal Senator]] of [[Transvaal (province)|Transvaal]].{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=19}} Tucker was a sickly child and suffered from diphtheria, measles, and pneumonia, which left her with a life-long susceptibility to [[bronchitis]].{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=138}} Her father, who supported women's education, kept her supplied with books to read when she was confined.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=138}}{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=19}}\n\nTucker attended [[Barnato Park High School|Fanny Buckland School]], but at the beginning of the [[Second Boer War]] was evacuated with her family to East London. When the returned to South Africa in 1900, she studied at the Wesleyan High School for Girls in [[Grahamstown]], graduating in 1902.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=138}} Wanting to become a teacher, with encouragement from her father, Tucker enrolled the following year at [[Cape Town]]'s [[South African College]], (later the [[University of Cape Town]]),{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=19}} studying the [[classics]], French, and philosophy.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=138}} Becoming a \"star student\", she won prizes in both English and philosophy,{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=21}} and became the first and only female to serve on the [[student council]] in 1906.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=22}}{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=139}} Because a spinal nerve condition impacted her ability to write, she used a typewriter, an [[amanuensis]], and was given an extra time to write her bachelor's examinations, which she passed with honours.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=139}} \n\nInfluenced by her philosophy professor, [[Thomas Loveday (university administrator)|Thomas Loveday]], Tucker decided to continue her studies at Cambridge.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=22}} Before she left South Africa, Tucker met [[R. F. Alfred Hoernl\u00e9|Reinhold Friedrich Alfred Hoernl\u00e9]], who had been appointed a philosophy professor at South African College in 1908.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=29}} Upon receipt of the Porter Scholarship, which provided her with a three-year funding of \u00a3150 annually, she enrolled in [[Newnham College]] in 1908.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=139}} Studying anthropology and philosophy under [[Alfred Cort Haddon]] and [[W. H. R. Rivers]], she attended lectures by [[James George Frazer]] and [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]] and worked in [[Charles Samuel Myers]]' laboratory.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=23}} As there was no diploma available for anthropology at that time at Cambridge, Tucker did not sit for exams when she finished her studies in 1910.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=139}}{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=23}} Moving to [[Leipzig University]] in 1911, she studied under [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and then with his student and [[Structuralism (psychology)|structural psychologist]], [[Oswald K\u00fclpe]], at the [[University of Bonn]].{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=23}}{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=215}} Tucker completed her education with studies under [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]], founder of the academic discipline of [[sociology]] in 1912 at the [[College of Sorbonne|Sorbonne]] in Paris.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=23}}\n\n==Career==\n===Fieldwork and domestic life (1912-1922)===\nReturning to South Africa in 1912, Tucker applied to replace \"Alfred\" Hoernl\u00e9 as philosophy chair at the South African College. Though he had moved to [[Durham University]], the selection committee at the College asked Alfred to explain to Tucker that she was unsuitable because of her gender.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=30}}{{sfn|Carstens|1985|p=18}} Rekindling their acquaintance, the two became correspondents. When she turned down the selection committee's offer of an unpaid lectureship,{{sfn|Bank|2016|pp=29-30}} she was awarded college's Croll Scholarship to enable research among the [[Khoekhoe|Khoekhoe people]]. She made two expeditions, one to [[Richtersveld]] and the other to [[Berseba]] between 1912 and 1913,{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=140}} taking notes on the [[Nama people|Nama]] and [[San people]] along the [[Orange River|Orange]] and [[Kuiseb River]]s. She encountered many difficulties traveling from communities in a horse-drawn wagon,{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=140}}{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=26}} and more difficulties trying to gain consent for her to measure the limbs of her subjects, test them for colour perception,{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=27}} or relate to her general cultural information.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=28}} Though her field work was supposed to last for three years,{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=26}} in 1913, Tucker accepted a proposal of marriage from Alfred, resigned her scholarship, and joined him in the UK in 1914.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=26}}{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=141}}\n\nThe couple married in [[Oxford]] and in April 1914, moved to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where Alfred had taken a post as a philosophy professor and chair at [[Harvard University]].{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=30}}{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=141}} Their only child, Alwin, was born in 1915 and Hoernl\u00e9 spent the majority of her time in domestic pursuits while in the United States, though she did contribute an article \"Certain Rites of Transition and Conception of ''!Nau'' among the Hottentots\" to the journal ''Harvard African Studies''{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=141}}{{sfn|Bank|2016|pp=30-31}} in 1918. The work represented the first time that [[Van Gennep]]'s model on [[rites of passage]] had been applied to ethnographic data in southern Africa.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=32}} The severe winters in Boston caused repeated bronchial problems for Hoernl\u00e9 and in October 1920, she returned to Johannesburg. She lived with her parents,{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=33}} while Alfred remained in Boston for two more years.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=141}} \n\nIn 1921, Hoernl\u00e9 became a founding member of the publication committee of the journal ''[[African Studies (journal)|Bantu Studies]]'' and would be the only woman to serve on the editorial board until the 1930s.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=141}}{{sfn|Bank|2016|pp=34-35}} She planned an expedition to [[South West Africa]] for December 1922. In the planning stages the month preceding her trip, she met with Radcliffe-Brown, who encouraged her to abandon physical examination of her subjects and focus on collecting data related to kinship.{{sfn|Bank|2016|pp=34-35}} The trip was sponsored by the government and was intended to provide evidence of the need to establish [[Bantustan|segregated land reserves]] for the rural Nama people. South Africa had recently acquired the [[League of Nations mandate]] to govern the former [[German South West Africa|German colony]], after German losses in [[World War I]] and five years of military rule. Instead of evaluating rural environments, Hoernl\u00e9's report focused on urban Nama and their grievances over taxation by authorities and missionaries in the shift of government. Dismissing her report as irrelevant, the government implemented land reserves as an official policy in 1923.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=36}}\n\n===University faculty (1923-1937)===\nIn 1921, the [[University of Cape Town]] had hired Radcliffe-Brown as the first full professor of [[social anthropology]] at any British university throughout the empire.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=37}}{{sfn|Fortes|1956}} He and Hoernl\u00e9 carried out extensive correspondence regarding the formation of the new academic field of study and how it should be structured as a scientific discipline in South Africa.{{sfn|Bank|2016|pp=37-38}} In 1922, Alfred was offered the post to head the philosophy department at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] and as an inducement to secure him, the university offered to hire his wife as a researcher and develop a social anthropology department. Hired in 1923,{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=37}}{{sfn|Gluckman|Schapera|1960|p=262}} Hoernl\u00e9 and Brown's correspondence confirms that they were jointly working through 1924 on several joint papers on ancestry and marriage rites, cattle, [[joking relationship]]s, kinship terms, and sacrifice rituals.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=40}} His decision to accept the position at the [[University of Sydney]] as head of the social anthropology department in 1925,{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=45}} led Hoernl\u00e9 to abandon her field research in favor of teaching.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=37}}{{sfn|Gluckman|Schapera|1960|p=262}} \n\nHoernl\u00e9 was appointed as a [[lecturer]] in January 1926 at the University of the Witwatersrand.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=45}} As early as 1912, she had given lectures arguing that primitive or indigenous people had the same mental capacity as more sophisticated members of society, that their cultures should be examined with empathy and consideration of their perspective, and that social organization played a major role in which societies survived and which societies failed.{{sfn|Gordon|1987|p=70}} Her teaching style was \"stimulating and thorough\", and she inspired her students, \"among the first in the field\" to research cultural contacts and the problems associated with social change.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=141}} She taught her students that traditional cultures were not separately operated and contained societies, but instead part of the greater single society of South Africa and dynamic. Her views and those of her students who followed her lead were increasingly at odds with Afrikaner anthropologists and the later apartheid government, who accepted a static, [[Primitive culture|primitivist model]] of traditional cultures.{{sfn|James|Plaice|Toren|2010|p=172}} \n\nHoernl\u00e9 challenged her students with innovative theories which laid the groundwork for development of the field of social anthropology.{{sfn|Gordon|1987|p=68}} She encouraged them to observe and preserve social and cultural aspects of women's lives. [[Dora Earthy]], a missionary in [[Mozambique]], wrote a unique monograph focused solely on [[Makuleke tribe|Valenge women]], but other students incorporated information on female rituals within the family into their works, including initiation rites and those associated with marriage and conjugal relations.{{sfn|Gaitskell|1983|p=3}} Their studies caused her students to compare the lives of indigenous women with the restrictions placed on Western women, and they discovered African women did not typically have the same social curtailments.{{sfn|Gaitskell|1983|p=4}}\n\nIn addition to her focus on building an anthropological department, Hoernl\u00e9 created a library and an archaeological specimen and cultural museum, to facilitate her students' studies.{{sfn|Gluckman|Schapera|1960|p=262}}{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=47}} To ensure that her students had a thorough grounding she sent her best pupils to the [[London School of Economics]] to study ethnographic field work methods and [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] with [[Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski]].{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=57}} As an external examiner on anthropological theses, Hoernl\u00e9 came in contact with [[Isaac Schapera]] in 1925. He used her early research in his thesis and upon his graduation, they worked together to promote social anthropology grounded in field work.{{sfn|Bank|2016|pp=54-55}} She took a leave and went to study with Malinowski herself in 1929.{{sfn|Bank|2016|pp=56-57}}{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=203}} \n\nWhile she was gone, Schapera taught Hoernl\u00e9's classes and from her return in 1930, they collaborated together on the Inter-University African Studies Committee.{{sfn|Bank|2016|pp=56-57}}{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=203}} In their work, they shaped the committee in developing a national project to further ethnographic studies through adequate funding and cooperation among scholars throughout the continent.{{sfn|Bank|2016|pp=58-59, 63}} Hoernl\u00e9 was promoted to senior lecturer in 1934.{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=215}} Under her guidance, pioneering urban anthropological studies were undertaken in South Africa and first published in 1935.{{sfn|Gordon|1987|p=71}}{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=62}} That year, ''Bantu Studies'' dedicated their September 1935 issue as a \"homage to Winifred Hoernl\u00e9\"{{sfn|Gordon|1987|p=68}}{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=203}} and she was granted the unusual distinction of being \"made an Honorary Fellow of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland|Royal Anthropological Institute]]\".{{sfn|Gluckman|Schapera|1960|p=263}} She resigned from her post in 1937 to care for she and Alfred's aging parents.{{sfn|Gluckman|Schapera|1960|p=262}}\n\n===Social activism (1932-1960)===\nDuring her time at university in Cape Town, Hoernl\u00e9 (Tucker at the time) had begun developing a liberal attitude toward race relations. Differing from her father's view, she believed that educated Africans should be able to vote.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=22}} In her field work, she developed empathy for the people she was studying, especially in urban communities, because her fluency in [[Afrikaans]], English, and German allowed a more intimate communication with her subjects.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=37}} By 1932, when she joined the Committee of the Johannesburg Child Welfare Society, Hoernl\u00e9 had developed not only a commitment to justice, but a sense of responsibility for social service.{{sfn|Krige|1960|pp=142-143}} She served as president in 1938 and 1939 of the National Women's Organisation and upon her husband's death in 1943, became president of the [[South African Institute of Race Relations]] for two years,{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=60}}{{sfn|Richards|1961|p=53}} serving subsequent terms from 1948 to 1950 and from 1953 to 1954.{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=215}} \n\nRapid industrialization and urbanization in the 1930s and 1940s challenged the existing systems of legal jurisdiction in South Africa, which had formerly allowed rural people to indirectly govern themselves. As people moved in large numbers to urban areas to work in factories, security became a major issue, as did fear of crime.{{sfn|Gillespie|2011|pp=503-504}} Several commissions \u2014 Elliot Commission (1943), the [[Fagan Commission]] (1946), and the [[Sauer Commission]] (1947) \u2013 each attempted to deal with crime, laws regulating mobile populations, and potential threats to the communities.{{sfn|Gillespie|2011|p=509}} During this period, Hoernl\u00e9 became a vocal advocate of liberal [[universalism]].{{sfn|Gillespie|2011|p=505}} In 1945, she was appointed as one of the founding members of the Penal and Prisons Reform Commission.{{sfn|Gillespie|2011|p=509}} The commission became an important sounding board for conceptualising ideas about race in a reform-minded platform incorporating paternalistic models of governance.{{sfn|Gillespie|2011|p=515}} The commission later became the Penal Reform League of South Africa and she served as its president for many years.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=143}}\n\nHoernl\u00e9 was one of the most prominent activists in social welfare campaigns in the period, stressing the need for collaboration between African, Indian and white women. She helped establish clinics for mothers; improved educational facilities and welfare services for children; and worked on penal reform.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=60}} Concerned for the depressed conditions in Indian communities, she opened the first schools for Indian girls{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=143}} and chaired the Committee of the Indian Social Welfare Association.{{sfn|Richards|1961|p=53}} In 1949, Hoernl\u00e9 was given an [[Honorary degree|honourary]] [[Doctor of Law|Doctorate of Laws]] from the University of the Witwatersrand in recognition to her contributions to academics and social welfare.{{#tag:ref|Bank notes the significance of the degree being in law rather than anthropology, suggesting her importance in social reform{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=60}} and Gordon wrote that her moral stances were as important to her legacy as her academic contributions.{{sfn|Gordon|1987|p=72}} |group=\"Notes\"}} That year, the National Welfare Board appointed her as a member and her contributions to the Landsdown Penal Reform Commission Report were presented. They would be one \"of the most important sections of the Commission's Report\". In 1952, Hoernl\u00e9 was honored by the International Council for Child Welfare with with their Medal of Merit and was recognized with a medal for her service to Africa by the [[Royal African Society]].{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=143}} After the [[Bantu Education Act, 1953]] was enacted, she worked to reform its repressive language{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=60}} and argued that educational systems which did not take into consideration social customs practiced within communities estranged students from their communities.{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=201}} In 1955, the journal ''Race Relations'' of the South African Institute of Race Relations published a special issue to commemorate her 70th birthday.{{sfn|Gordon|1987|p=68}}\n\n==Racial views and \"Christian Trusteeship\"==\nFrom 1923, Hoernl\u00e9 wrote that to be successful in implementing change and European-style administration among traditional populations, officials needed \"a sound knowledge of the outlook and beliefs of the natives\".{{sfn|Webster|2017|p=20}} She recognized that because the mechanisms of power in South Africa favored white society, white culture was dominant.{{sfn|James|Plaice|Toren|2010|p=79}} In her 1948 article, ''Alternatives to Apartheid'', Hoernl\u00e9 argued any solution implemented to control racial relations must protect fundamental principles such as equal opportunity without conditions of race and colour, freedom of conscience and expression, and the [[rule of law]]. While she acknowledged that traditional societies and western civilization might each have reasons to protect their culture and racial purity, Hoernl\u00e9 wrote that no race was superior and each should mutually respect each other, by guaranteeing to protect the fundamental principles. Stating that if assimilation was unlikely, implementation of [[Apartheid]] required granting sovereign independence to traditional societies.{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=220}} By implementing such a plan, she reasoned societies could develop [[separate but equal]] institutions and customs which allowed each group to govern themselves and share the fundamental tenets of citizenship.{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=221}} \n\nHowever, Hoernl\u00e9 reiterated that the test of commitment to basic rights was to recognize that they applied to people who had previously followed different traditions, but were now members of a society that had such principles. She argued that failing to recognize that they were all one society and attempting to create separate but equal facilities would damage the economy, as well as humanity.{{sfn|Gillespie|2011|p=507}} Her seemingly contradictory approaches recognized that the situation was complex and might require utilizing various methods and policies in a period of \"Christian Trusteeship\" to reach solutions that supported the ethical beliefs of the society and provided stewardship to indigenous members who were part of that society.{{sfn|Gillespie|2011|p=508}} Along with other academics, many of whom were her former students, she was in favor of assimilation of all races into one society. {{sfn|James|Plaice|Toren|2010|p=48}} In 1952, amid political unrest and pressure from black activists, Hoernl\u00e9 joined twenty-one other white liberals in issuing a statement calling upon the government to support equal rights and equal opportunities for \"educated, politically conscious non-Europeans\".{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=221}} \n\n==Death and Legacy==\nHoernl\u00e9 died on 17 March 1960 in Johannesburg.{{sfn|Krige|1960|p=138}}{{sfn|Gluckman|Schapera|1960|p=262}} After her death, her contributions were obscured by scholars who claimed her scholarship was directed by Radcliffe-Brown and her social involvement was an extension of husband's work.{{sfn|Carstens|1985|p=17-18}} Letters from Radcliffe-Brown, make clear that Hoernl\u00e9's work was original scholarship{{sfn|Carstens|1985|p=17}} and though she and Alfred were both liberals, her ideas about social reforms differed from and predated her relationship with him.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=22}}{{sfn|Carstens|1985|p=18}}  According to Robert Gordon, professor of anthropology at the [[University of Vermont]], \"she was the first trained female social anthropologist in the world\".{{sfn|Gordon|1987|p=70}}{{sfn|Carstens|1985|p=17}} Historian Andrew Bank, of the [[University of the Western Cape]] has said that she was the central figure in the development of social anthropology in South Africa in the [[interwar period]] because she introduced a collaborative \"series of methodological innovations that led to the creation of a professional, scientific, and... field-based ethnographic tradition\".{{sfn|Bank|2016|pp=18-19}} Coupled with her influence upon the students who studied under her and whom she mentored, which included [[Max Gluckman]], [[Ellen Hellmann]], [[Eileen Krige]], [[Hilda Kuper]], [[Audrey Richards]], and [[Monica Wilson]], among others, she shaped the field of social anthropology in South Africa.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=18}}{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=214}} She has often been called the \"Mother of Social Anthropology in South Africa\",{{sfn|Schmidt|1996|p=214}}{{sfn|Carstens|1985|p=17}} as most of the leading South African anthropologists of her era trained with her.{{sfn|Richards|1961|p=53}} Her tenure marked a shift in the makeup of scientists studying social anthropology, from a male-dominated field, to one where women were at the forefront.{{sfn|Bank|2016|p=63}}\n\n==Selected works==\n*{{cite journal |last1=Hoernl\u00e9 |first1=A.

The term may be used in a moral sense\u2014condemning, taking advantage of others' misfortunes\u2014or in a legal sense, where an interest rate is charged in excess of the maximum rate that is allowed by law. A loan may be considered usurious because of excessive or abusive [[interest rate]]s or other factors defined by a nation's laws. Someone who practices usury can be called a ''usurer'', but in contemporary English may be called a ''[[loan shark]]''.\n\nIn many historical societies including ancient Christian, Jewish, and many modern Islamic societies, usury meant the charging of [[interest]] of any kind and was considered wrong, or was made illegal.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081015172719/http://www.affil.org/consumer_rsc/usury.php The History of Usury from Americans for Fairness in Lending]</ref>  During the Sutra period in India (7th to 2nd centuries BC) there were laws prohibiting the highest castes from practicing usury.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jain|first=L.

Though the Roman Empire eventually allowed loans with carefully restricted interest rates, the Catholic Church in medieval Europe regarded the charging of interest at any rate as sinful (as well as charging a fee for the use of money, such as at a [[bureau de change]]). Religious prohibitions on usury are predicated upon the belief that charging interest on a loan is a sin.\n\n==History==\nUsury (in the original sense of any interest) was at times denounced by a number of religious leaders and philosophers in the ancient world, including [[Moses]],<ref>Exodus 22:25</ref> [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], [[Cicero]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]],<ref name=\"pr_tson\">{{cite web|url=http://www.peterrussell.com/SP/Usury.php|title=Usury - The Root of All Evil|work=The Spirit of Now|publisher=Peter Russell}}</ref> [[Aquinas]],<ref name=\"aquinus_onusury\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/aquinas-usury.html|title=Thomas Aquinas: On Usury, c. 1269-71|publisher=Fordham University}}</ref> [[Muhammad]],<ref name=\"muhammad_lastsermon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/muhm-sermon.html|title=The Prophet Muhammad's Last Sermon |publisher=Fordham University}}</ref> and [[Gautama Buddha]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bodhi|first=Bhikku|title=Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood (Samma Vaca, Samma Kammanta, Samma Ajiva)|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html#ch4|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society|accessdate=29 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nCertain negative historical renditions of usury carry with them social connotations of perceived \"unjust\" or \"discriminatory\" lending practices.

Mostly, it was undertaken by exceedingly rich men prepared to take on a high risk if the profit looked good; interest rates were fixed privately and were almost entirely unrestricted by law. Investment was always regarded as a matter of seeking personal profit, often on a large scale. Banking was of the small, back-street variety, run by the urban lower-middle class of petty shopkeepers.

The Christians, on the basis of the Biblical rulings, condemned interest-taking absolutely, and from [[Third Council of the Lateran|1179]] those who practiced it were [[excommunication|excommunicated]].

For instance, the 15th-century commentator [[Isaac Abarbanel|Rabbi Isaac Abrabanel]] specified that the rubric for allowing interest does not apply to Christians or Muslims, because their faith systems have a common ethical basis originating from Judaism. The medieval commentator [[David Kimhi|Rabbi David Kimchi]] extended this principle to non-Jews who show consideration for Jews, saying they should be treated with the same consideration when they borrow.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/moneylending|title=Encyclopedia Judaica: Moneylending|last=|first=|date=2008|website=Jewish Virtual Library|access-date=October 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==England==\nIn England, the departing [[Crusaders]] were joined by crowds of debtors in the [[History of the Jews in England (1066\u20131290)#Massacres at London and York (1189\u20131190)|massacres of Jews at London and York in 1189\u20131190]]. In 1275, [[Edward I of England]] passed the [[Statute of the Jewry]] which made usury illegal and linked it to [[blasphemy]], in order to seize the assets of the violators. Scores of English Jews were arrested, 300 were hanged and their property went to [[the Crown]]. In 1290, all Jews were to be expelled from England, allowed to take only what they could carry; the rest of their property became the Crown's. Usury was cited as the official reason for the [[Edict of Expulsion]]; however, not all Jews were expelled: it was easy to avoid expulsion by converting to Christianity. Many other crowned heads of Europe expelled the Jews, although again converts to Christianity were no longer considered Jewish. Many of these [[marranos|forced converts]] still [[crypto-Judaism|secretly practiced]] their faith.\n\nThe growth of the [[Lombard banking|Lombard bankers]] and [[pawnbroker]]s, who moved from city to city, was along the [[pilgrim]] routes.\n\n[[File:Die Wucherfrage.jpg|thumb|''Die Wucherfrage'' is the title of a [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]] work against usury from 1869.

This was caused by refined commercial techniques, increased capital availability, the [[Reformation]], and other reasons. The lower rates weakened religious scruples about lending at interest, although the debate did not cease altogether.\n\nThe [[Vix pervenit|18th century papal prohibition]] on usury meant that it was a sin to charge interest on a money loan. As set forth by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the 13th century, the natural essence of money was as a [[Unit of account|measure of value]] or [[Medium of exchange|intermediary in exchange]]. The increase of money through usury violated this essence and according to the same [[Thomism|Thomistic]] analysis, a just transaction was one characterized by an equality of exchange, one where each side received exactly his due. Interest on a loan, in excess of the principal, would violate the balance of an exchange between debtor and creditor and was therefore unjust.\n\n[[Charles Eisenstein]] has argued that pivotal change in the English-speaking world came with lawful rights to charge interest on lent money,<ref>[[Charles Eisenstein|Eisenstein, Charles]]: [http://www.realitysandwich.com/homepage_sacred_economics Sacred Economics: Money, Gift, and Society in the Age of Transition]</ref> particularly the 1545 Act, \"An Act Against Usurie\" ([[37 Hen.

We, therefore, wishing to get rid of these pernicious practices, decree with the approval of the sacred council that all the magistrates, captains, rulers, consuls, judges, counsellors or any other officials of these communities who presume in the future to make, write or dictate such statutes, or knowingly decide that usury be paid or, if paid, that it be not fully and freely restored when claimed, incur the sentence of excommunication. They shall also incur the same sentence unless within three months they delete from the books of their communities, if they have the power, statutes of this kind hitherto published, or if they presume to observe in any way these statutes or customs. Furthermore, since money-lenders for the most part enter into usurious contracts so frequently with secrecy and guile that they can be convicted only with difficulty, we decree that they be compelled by ecclesiastical censure to open their account books, when there is question of usury. If indeed someone has fallen into the error of presuming to affirm pertinaciously that the practice of usury is not sinful, we decree that he is to be punished as a heretic; and we strictly enjoin on local ordinaries and inquisitors of heresy to proceed against those they find suspect of such error as they would against those suspected of heresy.

Previously usury had been seen as a lack of [[Charity (virtue)|charity]].\n\nSt. [[Thomas Aquinas]], the leading scholastic theologian of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], argued charging of interest is wrong because it amounts to \"double charging\", charging for both the thing and the use of the thing. Aquinas said this would be morally wrong in the same way as if one sold a bottle of wine, charged for the bottle of wine, and then charged for the person using the wine to actually drink it.<ref>Thomas Aquinas. [[Summa Theologica]], \"Of Cheating, Which Is Committed in Buying and Selling.\" Translated by The Fathers of the English Dominican Province. pp. 1-10 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON301-2.1.2-2nd.pdf] Retrieved June 19, 2012</ref> Similarly, one cannot charge for a piece of cake and for the eating of the piece of cake. Yet this, said Aquinas, is what usury does. Money is a medium of exchange, and is used up when it is spent. To charge for the money and for its use (by spending) is therefore to charge for the money twice. It is also to sell time since the usurer charges, in effect, for the time that the money is in the hands of the borrower. Time, however, is not a commodity for which anyone can charge. In condemning usury Aquinas was much influenced by the recently rediscovered philosophical writings of [[Aristotle]] and his desire to assimilate [[Greek philosophy]] with [[Christian theology]]. Aquinas argued that in the case of usury, as in other aspects of Christian revelation, Christian doctrine is reinforced by Aristotelian [[natural law]] rationalism. Aristotle's argument is that interest is unnatural, since money, as a sterile element, cannot naturally reproduce itself. Thus, usury conflicts with natural law just as it offends Christian revelation: see [[Thought of Thomas Aquinas]].\n\nOutlawing usury did not prevent investment, but stipulated that in order for the investor to share in the profit he must share the risk. In short he must be a joint-venturer. Simply to invest the money and expect it to be returned regardless of the success of the venture was to make money simply by having money and not by taking any risk or by doing any work or by any effort or sacrifice at all, which is usury. St Thomas quotes Aristotle as saying that \"to live by usury is exceedingly unnatural\". Islam likewise condemns usury but allowed commerce (Al-Baqarah 2:275) - an alternative that suggests investment and sharing of profit and loss instead of sharing only profit through interests. Judaism condemns usury towards Jews, but allows it towards non-Jews. (Deut 23:19-20) {{citation needed|date=May 2015}} St Thomas allows, however, charges for actual services provided. Thus a banker or credit-lender could charge for such actual work or effort as he did carry out e.g. any fair administrative charges. The Catholic Church, in a decree of the [[Fifth Council of the Lateran]], expressly allowed such charges in respect of credit-unions run for the benefit of the poor known as \"[[montes pietatis]]\".<ref>{{cite conference | url = http://www.intratext.com/ixt/ENG0067/_PE.HTM | title = Session Ten: On the reform of credit organisations (Montes pietatis) | conference = [[Fifth Lateran Council]] | publisher = [[Catholic Church]] | date = 4 May 1515 | accessdate = 2008-04-05 | location = [[Rome]], [[Italy]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the 13th century [[Henry of Segusio|Cardinal Hostiensis]] enumerated thirteen situations in which charging interest was not immoral.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Roover | first = Raymond | title = The Scholastics, Usury, and Foreign Exchang | journal =  Business History Review |date=Autumn 1967 | volume = 41 | doi = 10.2307/3112192 | pages = 257\u2013271 | jstor = 3112192 | issue = 3 | publisher = The Business History Review, Vol. 41, No. 3 }}</ref> The most important of these was ''lucrum cessans'' (profits given up) which allowed for the lender to charge interest \"to compensate him for profit foregone in investing the money himself.\" {{Harv|Rothbard|1995|p=46}} This idea is very similar to opportunity cost.

As such, specialized codes of banking have developed to cater to investors wishing to obey [[Sharia|Qur'anic law]]. ''(See [[Islamic banking]])''\n\nThe following quotations are English translations from the [[Qur'an]]:<ref>Khattab, M. D. (2015). ''The clear Quran: a thematic English translation''. Siraj Publications.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Those who consume interest will stand \u02f9on Judgment Day\u02fa like those driven to madness by Satan\u2019s touch. That is because they say, \u201cTrade is no different than interest.\u201d But Allah has permitted trading and forbidden interest. Whoever refrains\u2014after having received warning from their Lord\u2014may keep their previous gains, and their case is left to Allah. As for those who persist, it is they who will be the residents of the Fire. They will be there forever. (''Al-Baqarah 2:275'')\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Allah has made interest fruitless and charity fruitful. And Allah does not like any ungrateful evildoer. Indeed, those who believe, do good, establish prayer, and pay alms-tax will receive their reward from their Lord, and there will be no fear for them, nor will they grieve. O believers! Fear Allah, and give up outstanding interest if you are \u02f9true\u02fa believers. If you do not, then beware of a war with Allah and His Messenger! But if you repent, you may retain your principal. Do no wrong and you will not be wronged. If it is difficult for someone to repay a debt, postpone it until a time of ease. And if you waive it as an act of charity, it will be better for you, if only you knew. (''Al-Baqarah 2:276-280'')\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>O believers! Do not consume interest, multiplying it many times over. And be mindful of Allah, so you may prosper. (''Al-'Imran 3:130'')\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>taking interest despite its prohibition, and consuming people\u2019s wealth unjustly. We have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful punishment. (''Al-Nisa 4:161'')\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Whatever loans you give, \u02f9only\u02fa seeking interest at the expense of people\u2019s wealth will not increase with Allah. But whatever charity you give, \u02f9only\u02fa seeking the pleasure of Allah\u2014it is they whose reward will be multiplied. (''Ar-Rum 30:39'')\n</blockquote>\n\nThe attitude of Muhammad to usury is articulated in his [[Farewell Sermon|Last Sermon]]:<ref>''[[Sahih Muslim]]'', book 15 (The Book of Pilgrimage), [http://sunnah.com/muslim/15/159 hadith 159].</ref><blockquote>Verily your blood, your property are as sacred and inviolable as the sacredness of this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this town of yours. Behold! Everything pertaining to the [[Jahiliyyah|Days of Ignorance]] is under my feet completely abolished. Abolished are also the blood-revenges of the Days of Ignorance. The first claim of ours on blood-revenge which I abolish is that of the son of [[Rabi'ah ibn al-Harith|Rabi'a b. al-Harith]], who was nursed among the tribe of Sa'd and killed by Hudhail.

Examples of forbidden loans, such as a person borrowing 1000 dollars and the borrower is required to return 1100 dollars. The above agreement is a form of transaction which is a burden for people who borrow, because in Islam, lending and borrowing are social transactions aimed at helping others, not like a sale and purchase agreement that is allowed to be profitable. Hence, a rule of thumb used by Islamic scholars is, \"Every loan (qardh) which gives additional benefits is called usury.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://salikun.com/fiqih/hukum-hadiah-atau-tambahan-dalam-hutang-piutang/|title=Hukum Hadiah atau Tambahan dalam Hutang Piutang|last=|first=|date=2020-03-19|website=Salikun.com|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Scholastic theology}}\n\n==In literature==\nIn ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] places the usurers in the inner ring of the seventh circle of hell.\n\nInterest on loans, and the contrasting views on the morality of that practice held by Jews and Christians, is central to the plot of Shakespeare's play \"[[The Merchant of Venice]]\".

Muslim scholars argue that such practice is unjust.<ref>Maududi(1967), vol. i, pg. 199</ref> As an alternative to usury, Islam strongly encourages charity and direct investment in which the creditor shares whatever profit or loss the business may incur (in modern terms, this amounts to an equity stake in the business).\n\n===Interest-free banks===\nThe [[JAK members bank]] is a usury-free saving and loaning system.\n\n===Interest-free micro-lending===\nGrowth of the [[Internet]] internationally has enabled both business micro-lending through sites such as [[Kickstarter]] as well as through global [[micro-lending]] charities where lenders make small sums of money available on zero-interest terms.

However, unlike other loans, which oblige the debtor to repay the amount borrowed, a non-recourse loan is fully satisfied merely by the transfer of the property to the creditor, even if the property has declined in value and is worth less than the amount borrowed. When such a loan is created, the creditor bears the risk that the property will decline sharply in value (in which case the creditor is repaid with property worth less than the amount borrowed), and the debtor does not bear the risk of decrease in property value (because the debtor is guaranteed the right to use the property, regardless of value, to satisfy the debt.)\n\n===Zinskauf===\n{{Main|Zinskauf}}\nZinskauf was used as an avoidance mechanism in the Middle Ages.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Abomination (Bible)]]\n* [[Chrematistics]]\n* [[Christian finance]]\n* [[Contractum trinius]]\n* [[Greed]]\n* [[History of Banking]]\n* [[History of pawnbroking]]\n* [[Islamic banking and finance|Islamic Banking]]\n* [[Loans and interest in Judaism]]\n* [[Loansharking]] (traditional occupation of [[Mafiosi]])\n* [[Money changing]]\n* [[Payday loan]]s\n* [[Predatory lending]]\n* [[Title loan]]\n* [[Usury Act 1660]]\n* [[Riba]]\n* ''[[Vix pervenit]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last=Noonan | first = John T. | author-link=John T.

The medieval commentator [[David Kimhi|Rabbi David Kimchi]] extended this principle to non-Jews who show consideration for Jews, saying they should be treated with the same consideration when they borrow.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/moneylending|title=Encyclopedia Judaica: Moneylending|last=|first=|date=2008|website=Jewish Virtual Library|access-date=October 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==England==\nIn England, the departing [[Crusaders]] were joined by crowds of debtors in the [[History of the Jews in England (1066\u20131290)#Massacres at London and York (1189\u20131190)|massacres of Jews at London and York in 1189\u20131190]]. In 1275, [[Edward I of England]] passed the [[Statute of the Jewry]] which made usury illegal and linked it to [[blasphemy]], in order to seize the assets of the violators. Scores of English Jews were arrested, 300 were hanged and their property went to [[the Crown]]. In 1290, all Jews were to be expelled from England, allowed to take only what they could carry; the rest of their property became the Crown's. Usury was cited as the official reason for the [[Edict of Expulsion]]; however, not all Jews were expelled: it was easy to avoid expulsion by converting to Christianity. Many other crowned heads of Europe expelled the Jews, although again converts to Christianity were no longer considered Jewish. Many of these [[marranos|forced converts]] still [[crypto-Judaism|secretly practiced]] their faith.\n\nThe growth of the [[Lombard banking|Lombard bankers]] and [[pawnbroker]]s, who moved from city to city, was along the [[pilgrim]] routes.\n\n[[File:Die Wucherfrage.jpg|thumb|''Die Wucherfrage'' is the title of a [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]] work against usury from 1869.

This was caused by refined commercial techniques, increased capital availability, the [[Reformation]], and other reasons. The lower rates weakened religious scruples about lending at interest, although the debate did not cease altogether.\n\nThe [[Vix pervenit|18th century papal prohibition]] on usury meant that it was a sin to charge interest on a money loan. As set forth by [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the 13th century, the natural essence of money was as a [[Unit of account|measure of value]] or [[Medium of exchange|intermediary in exchange]]. The increase of money through usury violated this essence and according to the same [[Thomism|Thomistic]] analysis, a just transaction was one characterized by an equality of exchange, one where each side received exactly his due. Interest on a loan, in excess of the principal, would violate the balance of an exchange between debtor and creditor and was therefore unjust.\n\n[[Charles Eisenstein]] has argued that pivotal change in the English-speaking world came with lawful rights to charge interest on lent money,<ref>[[Charles Eisenstein|Eisenstein, Charles]]: [http://www.realitysandwich.com/homepage_sacred_economics Sacred Economics: Money, Gift, and Society in the Age of Transition]</ref> particularly the 1545 Act, \"An Act Against Usurie\" ([[37 Hen.

Previously usury had been seen as a lack of [[Charity (virtue)|charity]].\n\nSt. [[Thomas Aquinas]], the leading scholastic theologian of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], argued charging of interest is wrong because it amounts to \"double charging\", charging for both the thing and the use of the thing. Aquinas said this would be morally wrong in the same way as if one sold a bottle of wine, charged for the bottle of wine, and then charged for the person using the wine to actually drink it.<ref>Thomas Aquinas. [[Summa Theologica]], \"Of Cheating, Which Is Committed in Buying and Selling.\" Translated by The Fathers of the English Dominican Province. pp. 1-10 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON301-2.1.2-2nd.pdf] Retrieved June 19, 2012</ref> Similarly, one cannot charge for a piece of cake and for the eating of the piece of cake. Yet this, said Aquinas, is what usury does. Money is a medium of exchange, and is used up when it is spent. To charge for the money and for its use (by spending) is therefore to charge for the money twice. It is also to sell time since the usurer charges, in effect, for the time that the money is in the hands of the borrower. Time, however, is not a commodity for which anyone can charge. In condemning usury Aquinas was much influenced by the recently rediscovered philosophical writings of [[Aristotle]] and his desire to assimilate [[Greek philosophy]] with [[Christian theology]]. Aquinas argued that in the case of usury, as in other aspects of Christian revelation, Christian doctrine is reinforced by Aristotelian [[natural law]] rationalism. Aristotle's argument is that interest is unnatural, since money, as a sterile element, cannot naturally reproduce itself. Thus, usury conflicts with natural law just as it offends Christian revelation: see [[Thought of Thomas Aquinas]].\n\nOutlawing usury did not prevent investment, but stipulated that in order for the investor to share in the profit he must share the risk. In short he must be a joint-venturer. Simply to invest the money and expect it to be returned regardless of the success of the venture was to make money simply by having money and not by taking any risk or by doing any work or by any effort or sacrifice at all, which is usury. St Thomas quotes Aristotle as saying that \"to live by usury is exceedingly unnatural\". Islam likewise condemns usury but allowed commerce (Al-Baqarah 2:275) - an alternative that suggests investment and sharing of profit and loss instead of sharing only profit through interests. Judaism condemns usury towards Jews, but allows it towards non-Jews. (Deut 23:19-20) {{citation needed|date=May 2015}} St Thomas allows, however, charges for actual services provided. Thus a banker or credit-lender could charge for such actual work or effort as he did carry out e.g. any fair administrative charges. The Catholic Church, in a decree of the [[Fifth Council of the Lateran]], expressly allowed such charges in respect of credit-unions run for the benefit of the poor known as \"[[montes pietatis]]\".<ref>{{cite conference | url = http://www.intratext.com/ixt/ENG0067/_PE.HTM | title = Session Ten: On the reform of credit organisations (Montes pietatis) | conference = [[Fifth Lateran Council]] | publisher = [[Catholic Church]] | date = 4 May 1515 | accessdate = 2008-04-05 | location = [[Rome]], [[Italy]]}}</ref>\n\nIn the 13th century [[Henry of Segusio|Cardinal Hostiensis]] enumerated thirteen situations in which charging interest was not immoral.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Roover | first = Raymond | title = The Scholastics, Usury, and Foreign Exchang | journal =  Business History Review |date=Autumn 1967 | volume = 41 | doi = 10.2307/3112192 | pages = 257\u2013271 | jstor = 3112192 | issue = 3 | publisher = The Business History Review, Vol. 41, No. 3 }}</ref> The most important of these was ''lucrum cessans'' (profits given up) which allowed for the lender to charge interest \"to compensate him for profit foregone in investing the money himself.\" {{Harv|Rothbard|1995|p=46}} This idea is very similar to opportunity cost.

Shylock customarily charges interest on loans, seeing it as good business, while Antonio does not, viewing it as morally wrong.

This is the source of the metaphorical phrase \"a pound of flesh\" often used to describe the dear price of a loan or business transaction. Shakespeare's play is a vivid portrait of the competing views of loans and use of interest, as well as the cultural strife between Jews and Christians that overlaps it. {{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nBy the 18th century, usury was more often treated as a metaphor than a crime in itself, so [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s ''Defense of Usury'' was not as shocking as it would have appeared two centuries earlier.\n\nIn [[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]]'s 1830 novel ''[[Gobseck]]'', the title character, who is a usurer, is described as both \"petty and great\u2014a miser and a philosopher...\"<ref>{{cite wikisource | title=Gobseck |author=[[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]] |year=1830 |translator=Ellen Marriage}}</ref> The character [[Quilp|Daniel Quilp]] in ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]] is a usurer.\n\nIn the early 20th century [[Ezra Pound]]'s [[The Cantos#XLII\u2013LI (Fifth Decad, called also Leopoldine Cantos)|anti-usury poetry]] was not primarily based on the [[natural law|moral injustice]] of interest payments but on the fact that excess capital was no longer devoted to artistic [[patronage]], as it could now be used for [[capitalism|capitalist]] business investment.<ref>[http://www.englit.ed.ac.uk/studying/undergrd/american_lit_2/Handouts/cmc_pound.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060105184644/http://www.englit.ed.ac.uk/studying/undergrd/american_lit_2/Handouts/cmc_pound.htm|date=January 5, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Usury law==\n\n===Usury and the law===\n{{See|Zinskauf}}\n[[Image:Magna_Carta_(British_Library_Cotton_MS_Augustus_II.106).jpg|thumb|''[[Magna Carta]]'' commands, \"If any one has taken anything, whether much or little, by way of loan from Jews, and if he dies before that debt is paid, the debt shall not carry usury so long as the heir is under age, from whomsoever he may hold.

The [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held unanimously in the 1978 case, ''[[Marquette Nat. Bank of Minneapolis v.

Among the Act's provisions, it exempted federally chartered savings banks, installment plan sellers and chartered loan companies from state usury limits. Combined with the ''Marquette'' decision that applied to National Banks, this effectively overrode all state and local usury laws.<ref name=\"docutech\" /><ref>[http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/bank/bt_9805.html The Effect of Consumer Interest Rate Deregulation on Credit Card Volumes, Charge-Offs, and the Personal Bankruptcy Rate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080924054000/http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/bank/bt_9805.html|date=2008-09-24}}, [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] \"Bank Trends\" Newsletter, March, 1998.</ref> The 1968 [[Truth in Lending Act]] does not regulate rates, except for some mortgages, but requires uniform or standardized disclosure of costs and charges.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-41/subchapter-I/part-A|title=15 U.S. Code Part A|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1996 ''[[Smiley v.

In July 2010, the [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], was signed into law by President Obama. The act provides for a [[United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau|Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] to regulate some credit practices but has no interest rate limit.<ref name=\"ABA\" />\n\n====Texas====\nState law in Texas also includes a provision for contracting for, charging, or receiving charges exceeding twice the amount authorized (A/K/A \"double usury\"). A person who violates this provision is liable to the obligor as an additional penalty for all principal or principal balance, as well as interest or time price differential.

However, unlike other loans, which oblige the debtor to repay the amount borrowed, a non-recourse loan is fully satisfied merely by the transfer of the property to the creditor, even if the property has declined in value and is worth less than the amount borrowed. When such a loan is created, the creditor bears the risk that the property will decline sharply in value (in which case the creditor is repaid with property worth less than the amount borrowed), and the debtor does not bear the risk of decrease in property value (because the debtor is guaranteed the right to use the property, regardless of value, to satisfy the debt.)\n\n===Zinskauf===\n{{Main|Zinskauf}}\nZinskauf was used as an avoidance mechanism in the Middle Ages.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Abomination (Bible)]]\n* [[Chrematistics]]\n* [[Christian finance]]\n* [[Contractum trinius]]\n* [[Greed]]\n* [[History of Banking]]\n* [[History of pawnbroking]]\n* [[Islamic banking and finance|Islamic Banking]]\n* [[Loans and interest in Judaism]]\n* [[Loansharking]] (traditional occupation of [[Mafiosi]])\n* [[Money changing]]\n* [[Payday loan]]s\n* [[Predatory lending]]\n* [[Title loan]]\n* [[Usury Act 1660]]\n* [[Riba]]\n* ''[[Vix pervenit]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last=Noonan | first = John T. | author-link=John T.

Marland Mansion''' is a {{convert|43561|sqft|m2}} [[Mediterranean Revival architecture|Mediterranean Revival-style]] mansion located in [[Ponca City]], [[Oklahoma]], [[United States]]. Built by oil baron and philanthropist [[E. W. Marland|Ernest Whitworth (E.W.) Marland]], as a display of wealth at the peak of the 1920s oil boom, the house is one of the largest residences in the southwestern United States, and is known as the \"Palace on the Prairie.\"  It was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1973, and is now a museum open to the public.\n\n==Architecture==\nThe Marland Mansion was built on the side of a small hill, higher on the west side than on the east, in an abandoned stone quarry that determined the placement for the mansion, as the excavations for the quarry was used for the construction of the swimming pool. Designed by prominent [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] architect [[John Duncan Forsyth]], the mansion was constructed between 1925 and 1928, and influenced by the [[Palazzo Davanzati]] in [[Florence]], [[Italy]] that Marland had visited while traveling in [[Europe]]. Crafted from light-colored, rusticated limestone blocks, quarried on-site, and set in concrete on a steel frame, the roughly u-shaped layout is 78 feet wide and 184 feet long. The main entrance is found on the west front and features an arched and buttressed [[porte-coch\u00e8re]] with gabled, clay tiled roof, that shelters the arched, 11-panel, double wood entrance doors custom-made in [[New York (state)|New York]]. Under each of the four inside corners of the porte-coch\u00e8re are sculptures of Marland's four hunting dogs, carved by Italian sculptor, Ernest G. Pellegrini. The windows with black painted metal surrounds, to contrast with the light colored stone, are asymmetrically arranged. The first level windows feature wrought iron grill work, while those on the second level are smaller, or have wrought iron balconies.<ref name=slice>{{cite journal|title=The Marlands\u2019 Mysterious Legacy|url=http://www.sliceok.com/May-2014/The-Marlands-Mysterious-Legacy/|publisher=Slice: The Magazine of Central Oklahoma|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}</ref>\n[[File:Marland Mansion South Front.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Marland Mansion South Front]]\nLarge raised terraces are found on the north, south and east fronts, however they do not interconnect. The south front's notable features include triple arched windows giving an arcaded effect and accented with stone balconies with flower carved [[corbels]] that flank the facade on the upper level. The drainage system is also exposed and displays the Marland monogram and the date \"1927.\" The water from the system drains through a sculptured carving of [[Pan (god)|Pan]] into a water feature located in a niche in the side of the terrace wall. Giving access to the terrace is a semicircular arched glass and wrought iron double doorway. The [[fanlight]] features a sunburst pattern with the tracery continuing down into the [[sidelights]] and doors with vertical bars. The arched doorway is replicated on the north facade in a set of three, continuing the arcaded effect. This arcade is highlighted by a stone cantilevered staircase to the left, with ornately carved corbels of mythological creatures leading to a second floor balcony adjacent to E.W. Marland's quarters. The east front is the only one that features a symmetrical facade, and where all three stories are evident due to the house being built on a hill. The first level has a set of three arched doorways that enclose a lounge directly below a terrace found on the second level, centered by a single arched entryway. On the third level are flanking rectangular windows with wrought iron balconies, mirroring those on the west front, centered by three small square shaped fenestrations.\n\nThe overhanging hipped roof, with stone corbeling along the roof line, features red clay tiles pierced by five large stone chimneys topped with Mediterranean style chimney caps. There was a sixth chimney situated on the north side of the house towards the rear that was destroyed in a storm and never rebuilt.<ref name=\"nhlsum\"/>\n\n==Interior==\n\n===First floor===\nThe mansion is spread out over three floors featuring a total of 55 rooms, including 10 bedrooms, 12 bathrooms, 7 fireplaces, and 3 kitchens illuminated by 861 light bulbs. The layout of the house is generally a central hall plan, and as a result of being built on the side of a hill, the entrance hall is located on the second floor. Defining the space is a large stone arch flanked by two lower rectangular openings, through which a short flight of stairs lead to a landing behind the arch featuring a balustrade. Overhead are gilded domed ceilings, and the space is embellished with two stone carved night owls, peering out of the stairway niches through glowing red eyes. Below the arch, a grand stairway leads down to the first level, and to the Hall of Merriment. The hall is named due to the four whimsical carvings of men representing \"Eat, drink and be merry,\" with the fourth figure taking a pinch of snuff. The hall today is the site of the Carl and Carolyn Renfro Gallery that feature replicas of the twelve statues entered in a competition to depict the Pioneer Woman. \n[[File:Marland Mansion Ballroom.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Marland Mansion Ballroom]]\n\n[[File:Marland Mansion Loggia.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Marland Mansion Loggia]]\nTo the left of the hall is the service area of the house including the main kitchen where a majority of the cooking was done, the staff dining room and pantry. On the right was originally a handball court for the amusement of family and friends, but has been re-purposed as the administrative offices for the Estate and the National Petroleum Hall of Fame. At the far eastern side of the house are two lounges, the inner lounge known as the Winter Room, and the outer lounge known as the Summer Room. The Winter Room has a large fireplace with a hearth that hides a small entry to a panic room that could have been used by the family during any dangerous situations. Above the concrete beams of the ceiling are decorated with artwork tracing the history of Oklahoma from the days of the pre-Columbian Native Americans through the discovery of oil by Marland Oil Company. The third kitchen is also located in this room and is known as the Hunt Kitchen as this is where guest assembled for breakfast before the fox hunts. Adjacent to the Hunt Kitchen is the secret Poker Room that concealed a hidden Whiskey Room and door to the 550 foot tunnel leading to the Boat House and Artist Studio. The ceilings in the Summer Lounge were designed and painted by Vincent Maragliotti free of charge and pay homage to the spirit of the 1920s.\n\n===Second floor===\nThe principal rooms of the house are located on the second floor. To the left of the entrance hall is the Elizabethan formal dining room featuring wall panels of hand-cut pollard oak cut from an English [[royal forest]], as well as a suspended cast plaster barrel ceiling that was molded at bench level, and then hoisted and wired into position to the structural beams. Adjacent to the dining room is a small octagonal-shaped breakfast room with plaster work representing the [[Tree of Life]] on the walls, and a service kitchen that featured once state-of-the-art appliances and counters made of [[Monel]].\n\nAccessed by a curved double staircase in the entrance hall, a multiple arched loggia with vaulted ceilings, featuring hand painted [[chinoiserie]] canvases, and a [[terrazzo]] floor with each tile individually poured between brass dividers, runs through the center of the house to the ballroom. Flanking the loggia are the sun room and living room where Marland displayed his collection of tapestries, paintings and works of art. The spacious ballroom features an ornate [[coffer]]ed ceiling that was gilded in $80,000 of gold leaf, and lit from imported [[Waterford crystal]] chandeliers with wrought iron bases that originally cost $15,000 each. To replace the ceiling and chandeliers today would cost an estimated $2 million. On the north wall are family portraits surrounding a large fireplace.<ref name= \"Magic\">{{cite news|title=The Magic Is Back // Ponca City's beloved Marland Mansion is regaining some of its long-lost glory|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/the-magic-is-back-ponca-city-s-beloved-marland-mansion/article_070cd509-9198-5fb0-8862-0956268c25c4.html|newspaper=Tulsa World|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Third floor===\nThe third floor, where the family's private quarters are found, is accessed by a spacious stone staircase with wrought iron railings, or by the original [[Otis Elevator Company|Otis elevator]] lined with [[American bison|buffalo]] leather; one of the first to be installed in the state of Oklahoma.

Lydie's Cottage was originally the chauffeur's quarters with garage space attached for the Marland's carriages and cars. Several architectural elements used in the mansion can be found in the cottage including a wood beam ceiling and a fish-scale stone floor in the entry. The house was remodeled by Forsyth with the addition of a bedroom and bathroom in the former carriage area, and the Marlands moved-in upon the sale of the mansion in 1941. E.W. Marland died here six months later of a heart condition, while Lydie Marland continued to live in the house, off and on, until her death in 1987.

The Oil Museum is located in the north wing of the Artist Studio and showcases the history of the [[Marland Oil Company]] in the early 20th-century. The studio is connected to the mansion by a tunnel via the Boat House.\n\nThe Boat House is the location of a large underground wine cellar that is accessed by a safe door. It also functioned as a storage area for the boats that were used for the enjoyment of guest and family. Once on the edge of one of five lakes on the estate, this body of water along with three other lakes, and the T-shaped Olympic-sized pool, were filled in by a successive owner. Lake Whitemarsh is the only remaining lake, and named after Marland's yacht, which in turn was named for a lake in Marland's hometown of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Tour the Grounds of the Marland Estate Mansion|url=http://www.marlandmansion.com/tours/grounds/index.htm|publisher=Marland Estate|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAt the height of the 1920s oil boom, E.W. Marland who controlled one tenth of the world's oil, set about building a home that was befitting of his new station in life. The mansion was built on a {{convert|2500|acre}} estate on the edge of town, and named The Refuge by Marland. Construction of the house began in 1925, employing dozens of European craftsmen, and was completed in 1928 at a cost of $5.5 million. Artwork and antique furnishings were purchased from around the world to fill the large mansion and gardens including French limestone sculptures of the family.\n\nE.W. Marland opened his estate on June 2, 1928 to invited friends and family, who enjoyed a luncheon and an afternoon of equestrian events such as [[polo]] and [[fox hunting]] which he had introduced to Oklahoma. Due to a hostile takeover of his company in 1928 by [[J. P. Morgan, Jr.]], the Marlands only enjoyed living in the mansion until 1931, as the operation of the large dwelling depleted their much reduced finances. Moving into the Artist Studio on the estate, the mansion was only opened for special occasions, such as the Inaugural Ball to celebrate Marland becoming Oklahoma's 10th governor in 1935. Just six months prior to his death, Marland sold the estate to the [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite Fathers]] in 1941 for just $66,000. Marland kept the former chauffeur cottage and surrounding land, leaving them to Lydie in his will.\n\nIn 1948, the Fathers sold the estate to the [[Felician Sisters|Sisters of St. Felix]] who operated a private high school on the grounds. During their tenure, they built a number of structures on the grounds, though all have been removed except for Angela Hall, built in 1958, and still operating as a school. The Felician Sisters moved to [[New Mexico]] in 1975, and sold the estate to the City of Ponca City and [[Conoco|Continental Oil Company]], which transferred their partial ownership to the city, for $1.5 million. The mansion was opened to the public the following year, and since then has undergone continued renovation to restore the estate to its former grandeur.<ref name= \"Magic\"/>\n\nIt was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1977.<ref name=\"nhlsum\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of largest houses in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|E.

Marland Mansion''' is a {{convert|43561|sqft|m2}} [[Mediterranean Revival architecture|Mediterranean Revival-style]] mansion located in [[Ponca City]], [[Oklahoma]], [[United States]]. Built by oil baron and philanthropist [[E. W. Marland|Ernest Whitworth (E.W.) Marland]], as a display of wealth at the peak of the 1920s oil boom, the house is one of the largest residences in the southwestern United States, and is known as the \"Palace on the Prairie.\"  It was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1973, and is now a museum open to the public.\n\n==Architecture==\nThe Marland Mansion was built on the side of a small hill, higher on the west side than on the east, in an abandoned stone quarry that determined the placement for the mansion, as the excavations for the quarry was used for the construction of the swimming pool. Designed by prominent [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] architect [[John Duncan Forsyth]], the mansion was constructed between 1925 and 1928, and influenced by the [[Palazzo Davanzati]] in [[Florence]], [[Italy]] that Marland had visited while traveling in [[Europe]]. Crafted from light-colored, rusticated limestone blocks, quarried on-site, and set in concrete on a steel frame, the roughly u-shaped layout is 78 feet wide and 184 feet long. The main entrance is found on the west front and features an arched and buttressed [[porte-coch\u00e8re]] with gabled, clay tiled roof, that shelters the arched, 11-panel, double wood entrance doors custom-made in [[New York (state)|New York]]. Under each of the four inside corners of the porte-coch\u00e8re are sculptures of Marland's four hunting dogs, carved by Italian sculptor, Ernest G. Pellegrini. The windows with black painted metal surrounds, to contrast with the light colored stone, are asymmetrically arranged. The first level windows feature wrought iron grill work, while those on the second level are smaller, or have wrought iron balconies.<ref name=slice>{{cite journal|title=The Marlands\u2019 Mysterious Legacy|url=http://www.sliceok.com/May-2014/The-Marlands-Mysterious-Legacy/|publisher=Slice: The Magazine of Central Oklahoma|accessdate=September 4, 2015}}</ref>\n[[File:Marland Mansion South Front.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Marland Mansion South Front]]\nLarge raised terraces are found on the north, south and east fronts, however they do not interconnect. The south front's notable features include triple arched windows giving an arcaded effect and accented with stone balconies with flower carved [[corbels]] that flank the facade on the upper level. The drainage system is also exposed and displays the Marland monogram and the date \"1927.\" The water from the system drains through a sculptured carving of [[Pan (god)|Pan]] into a water feature located in a niche in the side of the terrace wall. Giving access to the terrace is a semicircular arched glass and wrought iron double doorway. The [[fanlight]] features a sunburst pattern with the tracery continuing down into the [[sidelights]] and doors with vertical bars. The arched doorway is replicated on the north facade in a set of three, continuing the arcaded effect. This arcade is highlighted by a stone cantilevered staircase to the left, with ornately carved corbels of mythological creatures leading to a second floor balcony adjacent to E.W. Marland's quarters. The east front is the only one that features a symmetrical facade, and where all three stories are evident due to the house being built on a hill. The first level has a set of three arched doorways that enclose a lounge directly below a terrace found on the second level, centered by a single arched entryway. On the third level are flanking rectangular windows with wrought iron balconies, mirroring those on the west front, centered by three small square shaped fenestrations.\n\nThe overhanging hipped roof, with stone corbeling along the roof line, features red clay tiles pierced by five large stone chimneys topped with Mediterranean style chimney caps. There was a sixth chimney situated on the north side of the house towards the rear that was destroyed in a storm and never rebuilt.<ref name=\"nhlsum\"/>\n\n==Interior==\n\n===First floor===\nThe mansion is spread out over three floors featuring a total of 55 rooms, including 10 bedrooms, 12 bathrooms, 7 fireplaces, and 3 kitchens illuminated by 861 light bulbs. The layout of the house is generally a central hall plan, and as a result of being built on the side of a hill, the entrance hall is located on the second floor. Defining the space is a large stone arch flanked by two lower rectangular openings, through which a short flight of stairs lead to a landing behind the arch featuring a balustrade. Overhead are gilded domed ceilings, and the space is embellished with two stone carved night owls, peering out of the stairway niches through glowing red eyes. Below the arch, a grand stairway leads down to the first level, and to the Hall of Merriment. The hall is named due to the four whimsical carvings of men representing \"Eat, drink and be merry,\" with the fourth figure taking a pinch of snuff. The hall today is the site of the Carl and Carolyn Renfro Gallery that feature replicas of the twelve statues entered in a competition to depict the Pioneer Woman. \n[[File:Marland Mansion Ballroom.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Marland Mansion Ballroom]]\n\n[[File:Marland Mansion Loggia.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Marland Mansion Loggia]]\nTo the left of the hall is the service area of the house including the main kitchen where a majority of the cooking was done, the staff dining room and pantry.

These troops were generally [[Filipinos]] and [[Filipino-Americans]] assigned to the [[United States Army]] [[Philippine Department]], under the command of [[white American]] [[commissioned officer]]s (though a handful of Filipino Americans received commissions from the [[United States Military Academy]]). Philippine Scout units were given the suffix \"'''(PS)'''\", to distinguish them from other U.S. Army units.\n\nThe first Scout companies were organized by the US in 1901 to combat the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army]] led at that time by General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. In 1919\u20131920, the PS companies were grouped into regiments as part of the [[United States Army|US Army]] and redesignated the [[43d Infantry Regiment (PS)|43d]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (United States)|44th]], [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th]], and [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)|57th Infantry Regiments]], plus the [[24th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|24th]] and [[25th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|25th Field Artillery Regiments]], the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (PS)]] and the [[91st Coast Artillery (United States)|91st]] and [[92nd Coast Artillery (United States)|92nd Coast Artillery Regiments]]. Service and support formations were also organized as engineer, medical, quartermaster and military police units. The infantry and field artillery regiments were grouped together with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 31st Infantry Regiment]] to form the U.S. Army's [[Philippine Division]]. At this point, the Scouts became the U.S. Army's front line troops in the Pacific.\n\nThe Philippine Department assigned the Scouts to subdue the [[Moro people|Moro tribes]] on the island of Mindanao (see [[Moro rebellion]]), and to establish tranquility throughout the islands. In the 1930s, Philippine Scouts, along with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry Regiment]], saw action at [[Palawan|Jolo, Palawan]].\n\nPhilippine Scout regiments became the first United States Army units to be in combat during World War II, until the surrender of [[USAFFE]] in May 1942. Even after that some individual soldiers and units refused to surrender and become beginning elements of the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines#Resistance|resistance to the Japanese occupation]].

MacArthur took command of all military forces in the Philippines except the U.S. Navy's [[Asiatic Fleet]].

Over the next three months the Japanese Army marched through [[Southeast Asia]], and by March 1942 the Japanese had completely overrun every country and island in the western Pacific\u2014except the Philippines.\n\nOn the [[Bataan Peninsula]] of [[Luzon Island]], the Philippine Scouts, a few U.S. Army National Guard units, and ten divisions of poorly equipped, almost untrained [[Philippine Army]] soldiers held out against the Japanese. Survivors of the [[Battle of Bataan]], to a man, describe the Philippine Scouts as the backbone of the American defense there. President Franklin Roosevelt awarded the U.S. Army\u2019s first three [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]] of World War II to Philippine Scouts: to Sergeant [[Jose Calugas]] for action at Culis, Bataan on January 6, 1942, to Lieutenant [[Alexander R. Nininger]] for action near Abucay, Bataan on January 12, and to Lieutenant [[Willibald C. Bianchi]] for action near Bagac, Bataan on February 3, 1942.\n\nWith the U.S. Navy at [[Pearl Harbor]] in shambles, and the Japanese Navy blockading the Philippines, there was no way to send adequate amounts of food, medicine, ammunition or reinforcements to Bataan. Early in the campaign, in January 1942, General MacArthur ordered that his forces be fed one-half daily rations because the USAFFE food-stocks on Bataan were insufficient for the planned six-month siege. Such a diet did not provide enough calories for men working and fighting in the tropical heat of the Philippines' Dry Season. Nonetheless, the Scouts and the other soldiers held out for more than four months without adequate food or medicine, while malaria, dysentery and malnutrition ravaged their ranks, and Japanese attacks drove them further down the [[Bataan Peninsula]]. In the midst of the [[Battle of Bataan]], on 11 March 1942, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered General [[Douglas MacArthur]] spirited out of the Philippines by PT boat and airplane.\n\n==Prisoners of war==\nThe [[Battle of Bataan]] ended on April 9, 1942, when [[Edward P. King|Major General Edward P. King, Jr.]], surrendered rather than see any more of his starving, diseased men slaughtered by the advancing enemy. At that point 70,000 men became [[Prisoners of War]]: about 16,000 Americans and 54,000 Filipinos. Japanese soldiers marched the emaciated Scouts, American soldiers, and Philippine Army men sixty-five miles up the Bataan Peninsula's East Road on the notorious \"March of Death,\" the [[Bataan Death March]]. During the March, Japanese guards shot or bayoneted between 7,000 and 10,000 men who fell, attempted to escape, or just stopped to quench their thirst at roadside spigots or puddles. They also beat and sometimes killed Filipino civilians who attempted to give food and water to the POWs, and at times flashed the \"V\" for \"Victory\" hand-gesture to the defeated soldiers along the length of the Death March. The March ended at the railroad head in San Fernando, Pampanga province. There the POWs were forced into overcrowded \"40 and 10\" railroad cars, which only had enough room for them to sit down in shifts on the final leg of the trip to Capas, Tarlac province. At Capas they were herded into Camp O'Donnell, a former Philippine Army training camp, which was to be their prison camp.\n\nAt [[Camp O'Donnell]] the Japanese crammed all 60,000 survivors into a Philippine Army camp designed to accommodate 10,000 men. There, the Japanese commander greeted each new group of arrivals with the discouraging \"Goddamn you to Hell\" speech in his native language, and assured the men that they were \"captives,\" not Prisoners of War, and would be treated as such. There was little running water, sparse food, no medical care, and only slit trenches for sanitation. The heat was intolerable, flies rose out of the latrines and covered the prisoner's food, and malaria, dysentery, beriberi and a host of other diseases swept through the crowds of men. They began to die at the rate of four hundred per day.\n\nFrom September through December 1942, the Japanese gradually paroled the surviving Philippine Scouts and other Filipino soldiers to their families and to the mayors of their hometowns. But by the time Camp O'Donnell closed in January 1943, after eight months of operation, 26,000 of the 50,000 Filipino [[Prisoners of War]] had died there.\n\nThe Japanese transferred the American prisoners to [[Cabanatuan]], Nueva Ecija province, where conditions were only marginally better. But as U.S. forces pulled closer to the Philippines in 1944, they [[Hell ship|evacuated]] the healthiest American prisoners to [[Japan]] and [[Manchuria]], for use as slave laborers. Thousands of men were crammed into the dark holds of cargo ships so tightly that they could not sit or lay down. Again, food and water were scarce, sanitary facilities were non-existent, and the heat in the closed holds of the ships was unbearable. Men suffocated to death standing up. The Japanese ships were unmarked and some of them were torpedoed by American submarines. More of the men died of malnutrition and exposure in the work camps. By the time Japan surrendered and the U.S. and Filipino Army liberated the Bataan Prisoners of War, two-thirds of the American prisoners had died in Japanese custody.\n\n==Liberation and the \"New\" Scouts==\nDuring the Japanese occupation of the Philippines an extensive Filipino [[guerrilla]] movement sprang up. In some cases the guerrilla units were led by escaped American officers (e.g., [[Wendell Fertig]]) and often included \"paroled\" Philippine Scout and Philippine Commonwealth Army soldiers, along with civilian members of the Philippine underground. As MacArthur\u2019s forces, supported by the guerrillas, liberated the [[Philippine Islands]], the surviving Philippine Scouts stepped forward and rejoined the U.S. Army. The Filipino guerrillas joined them, and the U.S. Army set up new Philippine Scout units, reconstituting the old Philippine Division as the [[Philippine Division (United States)|12th Infantry Division]]. Subordinate units included the [[43rd Infantry Regiment (PS)|43rd]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (PS)|44th]] and [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th Infantry Regiments]] (PS); [[23rd Field Artillery (PS)|23rd]], [[24th Field Artillery (PS)|24th]] and [[88th Field Artillery (PS)|88th Field Artillery]] (PS) Battalions; [[56th Engineer Battalion (PS)]] and the [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)]]. The \"New Scouts\" actively participated in combat against the Japanese Army in north [[Luzon]], served as [[military police]] to restore order and help locate pockets of escaped Japanese in the south, and served as occupation forces on [[Okinawa]]. As planning for the invasion of Japan progressed, the Philippine Scouts were included in the invasion forces, and were selected to become part of the occupying force once Japan was defeated.\n\nAfter Japan surrendered in August 1945, the United States granted the Republic of the Philippines full independence on July 4, 1946. At that point the ethnically Filipino Philippine Scouts held a unique status in U.S. military history: they were soldiers in the regular U.S. Army, but now they were citizens of a foreign country. To solve this dilemma, the United States offered the Filipinos in the Philippine Scouts full [[U.S. citizenship]]. Many of the surviving Scouts, perhaps around 1,000, accepted, and the Army transferred them to other units to finish their military careers.\n\nWith the consent of the Philippine government, Congress approved the maintenance of 50,000 Philippine Scouts. Under Major General Hibbs, Philippine Division as the 12th Infantry Division (PS) was reconstituted. Unlike its previous organization enlisted personnel of the division were exclusively Philippine Scouts. The War Department also proposed organizing a second Philippine Scout division, the [[14th Infantry Division (United States)|14th]], but never did so.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alexander M.

Children of the Scouts (known as \"Army Soup\" in pre-World War II Fort William McKinley days) sometimes carried on their fathers' military traditions and also became US Army soldiers and Marines. Two Philippine Scout children even earned the stars of US Army generals: Lt. General [[Edward Soriano]] and Major General [[Antonio M. Taguba]]. A third, Brig. General [[Oscar Hilman]], a native of Washington state and an armor officer who had started out as an enlisted man, earned his star in a long career in the Army National Guard.\n\nUnlike other non-citizen veterans, veterans of the Philippine Division and other Filipinos who fought as part of the [[USAFFE]] were never granted citizenship. Since 1993, various bills have been introduced to the [[United States Congress]] under the name [[Filipino Veterans Fairness Act]] to rectify this. However, this was a complicated matter as after the liberation of the Philippines members of the Philippine Scouts were offered enlistments and in some applicable cases commissions in the US Army and subsequent citizenship. Large numbers of \"old\" Philippine Scouts (those enlisting before or during World War II) took advantage of this. However, most \"new\" Philippine Scouts (those recruited following the war, mostly for occupation duty on Okinawa and elsewhere) were not offered citizenship. Language similar to the aforementioned proposed legislation was inserted by the Senate into the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]<ref>{{cite news |first=Rick|last=Maze |title=Senate puts Filipino vet pensions in stimulus |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/01/military_filipinoscouts_stimulus_012909w/ |format=News article |work=Army Times |date=2008-01-29|accessdate=2009-01-30 |quote=Buried inside the Senate bill, which includes tax cuts and new spending initiatives intended to create jobs in the U.S., the Filipino payment was inserted at the urging of Sen.

This provided a one-time payment to those veterans who are recognized as being soldiers or recognized guerrilla members by the United States or their surviving spouse. Even this, however, falls far short of the benefits available to similar veterans of other units.\n\nIn 2012, a [[documentary film]] named ''Forgotten Soldiers'' was produced by Donald A. Pata, with the help of Associate Instructor Chris Schaefer of the [[University of Utah]], and narrated by [[Lou Diamond Phillips]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Forgotten Soldiers: A Film Recognizing the Bravery and Courage of WWII's Philippine Scouts |author=Malou Liwanag-Bledsoe |url=http://www.asianjournal.com/aj-magazine/something-filipino/17559-forgotten-soldiers-a-film-recognizing-the-bravery-and-courage-of-wwiis-philippine-scouts.html |newspaper=Asian Journal |date=3 October 2012 |accessdate=5 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128075437/http://asianjournal.com/aj-magazine/something-filipino/17559-forgotten-soldiers-a-film-recognizing-the-bravery-and-courage-of-wwiis-philippine-scouts.html |archivedate=28 January 2013 }}</ref> The film received awards from the City of [[Los Angeles]], the [[California Senate]], [[County of Los Angeles]], and at the [[Beloit International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite news |title=City of LA recognizes Donald Plata for 'Forgotten' Soldiers |url=http://www.asianjournal.com/community/community-news/17827-city-of-la-recognizes-donald-plata-for-forgotten-soldiers-.html |newspaper=Asian Journal |date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=5 May 2013 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\n==Notable Philippine Scouts==\n* [[Vicente Barros]] \u2013 Major, U.S. Army, the only Filipino officer among the ranks of Americans during the formation of the [[Philippine National Guard]] in 1917.<ref>{{cite news |title=THE CORNERSTONE OF PHILIPPINE INDEPENDENCE: A Narrative Of Seven Years |author=Francis Burton Harrison |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/philamer/AFJ2343.0001.001/192 |pages=166 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing, LLC |date=10 September 2010 |accessdate=17 April 2014}}<br />{{cite book|author=Francis Burton Harrison|title=The Corner-stone of Philippine Independence|url=https://archive.org/details/cornerstonephil00harrgoog|year=1922|publisher=Century Company|page=[https://archive.org/details/cornerstonephil00harrgoog/page/n196 166]}}</ref> Became advisor to the Philippine Commonwealth militia, the National Volunteers of the Philippines in 1935.<ref>{{cite news |title=THE PHILIPPINE ARMY, 1935-1942 |author=Ricardo Trota Jose |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kGocnp15GQ8C&pg=PA13&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q=barros&f=false |pages=21 |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press (1992) |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Willibald C.

These troops were generally [[Filipinos]] and [[Filipino-Americans]] assigned to the [[United States Army]] [[Philippine Department]], under the command of [[white American]] [[commissioned officer]]s (though a handful of Filipino Americans received commissions from the [[United States Military Academy]]). Philippine Scout units were given the suffix \"'''(PS)'''\", to distinguish them from other U.S. Army units.\n\nThe first Scout companies were organized by the US in 1901 to combat the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army]] led at that time by General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. In 1919\u20131920, the PS companies were grouped into regiments as part of the [[United States Army|US Army]] and redesignated the [[43d Infantry Regiment (PS)|43d]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (United States)|44th]], [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th]], and [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)|57th Infantry Regiments]], plus the [[24th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|24th]] and [[25th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|25th Field Artillery Regiments]], the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (PS)]] and the [[91st Coast Artillery (United States)|91st]] and [[92nd Coast Artillery (United States)|92nd Coast Artillery Regiments]]. Service and support formations were also organized as engineer, medical, quartermaster and military police units. The infantry and field artillery regiments were grouped together with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 31st Infantry Regiment]] to form the U.S. Army's [[Philippine Division]]. At this point, the Scouts became the U.S. Army's front line troops in the Pacific.\n\nThe Philippine Department assigned the Scouts to subdue the [[Moro people|Moro tribes]] on the island of Mindanao (see [[Moro rebellion]]), and to establish tranquility throughout the islands. In the 1930s, Philippine Scouts, along with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry Regiment]], saw action at [[Palawan|Jolo, Palawan]].\n\nPhilippine Scout regiments became the first United States Army units to be in combat during World War II, until the surrender of [[USAFFE]] in May 1942.

MacArthur took command of all military forces in the Philippines except the U.S. Navy's [[Asiatic Fleet]]. The [[Philippine Division]], [[Philippine Department]] and all other Philippine Scout units were included in USAFFE, as was the U.S. Army's [[United States Far East Air Force|Far East Air Force]] (FEAF). At the time of USAFFE's formation, the unit consisted of 22,532 troops, of which 11,972 were Philippine Scouts.\n\nOf the 22,532 troops, 10,473 were members of the Philippine Division, itself containing 2,552 Americans and 7,921 Filipinos. All of the division's enlisted men, with the exception of the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry Regiment]] and some of the [[Military Police Corps (United States)|military police]] and headquarters troops, were Philippine Scouts.\n\n==Filipino Officers within the Philippine Division, July 1941==\nIn 1910, the U.S. Army began sending one outstanding Filipino soldier per year to West Point.

Over the next three months the Japanese Army marched through [[Southeast Asia]], and by March 1942 the Japanese had completely overrun every country and island in the western Pacific\u2014except the Philippines.\n\nOn the [[Bataan Peninsula]] of [[Luzon Island]], the Philippine Scouts, a few U.S. Army National Guard units, and ten divisions of poorly equipped, almost untrained [[Philippine Army]] soldiers held out against the Japanese. Survivors of the [[Battle of Bataan]], to a man, describe the Philippine Scouts as the backbone of the American defense there. President Franklin Roosevelt awarded the U.S. Army\u2019s first three [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]] of World War II to Philippine Scouts: to Sergeant [[Jose Calugas]] for action at Culis, Bataan on January 6, 1942, to Lieutenant [[Alexander R. Nininger]] for action near Abucay, Bataan on January 12, and to Lieutenant [[Willibald C. Bianchi]] for action near Bagac, Bataan on February 3, 1942.\n\nWith the U.S. Navy at [[Pearl Harbor]] in shambles, and the Japanese Navy blockading the Philippines, there was no way to send adequate amounts of food, medicine, ammunition or reinforcements to Bataan. Early in the campaign, in January 1942, General MacArthur ordered that his forces be fed one-half daily rations because the USAFFE food-stocks on Bataan were insufficient for the planned six-month siege. Such a diet did not provide enough calories for men working and fighting in the tropical heat of the Philippines' Dry Season. Nonetheless, the Scouts and the other soldiers held out for more than four months without adequate food or medicine, while malaria, dysentery and malnutrition ravaged their ranks, and Japanese attacks drove them further down the [[Bataan Peninsula]]. In the midst of the [[Battle of Bataan]], on 11 March 1942, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered General [[Douglas MacArthur]] spirited out of the Philippines by PT boat and airplane.\n\n==Prisoners of war==\nThe [[Battle of Bataan]] ended on April 9, 1942, when [[Edward P. King|Major General Edward P. King, Jr.]], surrendered rather than see any more of his starving, diseased men slaughtered by the advancing enemy. At that point 70,000 men became [[Prisoners of War]]: about 16,000 Americans and 54,000 Filipinos. Japanese soldiers marched the emaciated Scouts, American soldiers, and Philippine Army men sixty-five miles up the Bataan Peninsula's East Road on the notorious \"March of Death,\" the [[Bataan Death March]]. During the March, Japanese guards shot or bayoneted between 7,000 and 10,000 men who fell, attempted to escape, or just stopped to quench their thirst at roadside spigots or puddles. They also beat and sometimes killed Filipino civilians who attempted to give food and water to the POWs, and at times flashed the \"V\" for \"Victory\" hand-gesture to the defeated soldiers along the length of the Death March. The March ended at the railroad head in San Fernando, Pampanga province. There the POWs were forced into overcrowded \"40 and 10\" railroad cars, which only had enough room for them to sit down in shifts on the final leg of the trip to Capas, Tarlac province. At Capas they were herded into Camp O'Donnell, a former Philippine Army training camp, which was to be their prison camp.\n\nAt [[Camp O'Donnell]] the Japanese crammed all 60,000 survivors into a Philippine Army camp designed to accommodate 10,000 men. There, the Japanese commander greeted each new group of arrivals with the discouraging \"Goddamn you to Hell\" speech in his native language, and assured the men that they were \"captives,\" not Prisoners of War, and would be treated as such. There was little running water, sparse food, no medical care, and only slit trenches for sanitation. The heat was intolerable, flies rose out of the latrines and covered the prisoner's food, and malaria, dysentery, beriberi and a host of other diseases swept through the crowds of men. They began to die at the rate of four hundred per day.\n\nFrom September through December 1942, the Japanese gradually paroled the surviving Philippine Scouts and other Filipino soldiers to their families and to the mayors of their hometowns. But by the time Camp O'Donnell closed in January 1943, after eight months of operation, 26,000 of the 50,000 Filipino [[Prisoners of War]] had died there.\n\nThe Japanese transferred the American prisoners to [[Cabanatuan]], Nueva Ecija province, where conditions were only marginally better. But as U.S. forces pulled closer to the Philippines in 1944, they [[Hell ship|evacuated]] the healthiest American prisoners to [[Japan]] and [[Manchuria]], for use as slave laborers. Thousands of men were crammed into the dark holds of cargo ships so tightly that they could not sit or lay down. Again, food and water were scarce, sanitary facilities were non-existent, and the heat in the closed holds of the ships was unbearable. Men suffocated to death standing up. The Japanese ships were unmarked and some of them were torpedoed by American submarines. More of the men died of malnutrition and exposure in the work camps. By the time Japan surrendered and the U.S. and Filipino Army liberated the Bataan Prisoners of War, two-thirds of the American prisoners had died in Japanese custody.\n\n==Liberation and the \"New\" Scouts==\nDuring the Japanese occupation of the Philippines an extensive Filipino [[guerrilla]] movement sprang up. In some cases the guerrilla units were led by escaped American officers (e.g., [[Wendell Fertig]]) and often included \"paroled\" Philippine Scout and Philippine Commonwealth Army soldiers, along with civilian members of the Philippine underground. As MacArthur\u2019s forces, supported by the guerrillas, liberated the [[Philippine Islands]], the surviving Philippine Scouts stepped forward and rejoined the U.S. Army. The Filipino guerrillas joined them, and the U.S. Army set up new Philippine Scout units, reconstituting the old Philippine Division as the [[Philippine Division (United States)|12th Infantry Division]]. Subordinate units included the [[43rd Infantry Regiment (PS)|43rd]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (PS)|44th]] and [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th Infantry Regiments]] (PS); [[23rd Field Artillery (PS)|23rd]], [[24th Field Artillery (PS)|24th]] and [[88th Field Artillery (PS)|88th Field Artillery]] (PS) Battalions; [[56th Engineer Battalion (PS)]] and the [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)]]. The \"New Scouts\" actively participated in combat against the Japanese Army in north [[Luzon]], served as [[military police]] to restore order and help locate pockets of escaped Japanese in the south, and served as occupation forces on [[Okinawa]]. As planning for the invasion of Japan progressed, the Philippine Scouts were included in the invasion forces, and were selected to become part of the occupying force once Japan was defeated.\n\nAfter Japan surrendered in August 1945, the United States granted the Republic of the Philippines full independence on July 4, 1946. At that point the ethnically Filipino Philippine Scouts held a unique status in U.S. military history: they were soldiers in the regular U.S. Army, but now they were citizens of a foreign country. To solve this dilemma, the United States offered the Filipinos in the Philippine Scouts full [[U.S. citizenship]]. Many of the surviving Scouts, perhaps around 1,000, accepted, and the Army transferred them to other units to finish their military careers.\n\nWith the consent of the Philippine government, Congress approved the maintenance of 50,000 Philippine Scouts. Under Major General Hibbs, Philippine Division as the 12th Infantry Division (PS) was reconstituted. Unlike its previous organization enlisted personnel of the division were exclusively Philippine Scouts. The War Department also proposed organizing a second Philippine Scout division, the [[14th Infantry Division (United States)|14th]], but never did so.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alexander M.

Children of the Scouts (known as \"Army Soup\" in pre-World War II Fort William McKinley days) sometimes carried on their fathers' military traditions and also became US Army soldiers and Marines. Two Philippine Scout children even earned the stars of US Army generals: Lt. General [[Edward Soriano]] and Major General [[Antonio M. Taguba]]. A third, Brig. General [[Oscar Hilman]], a native of Washington state and an armor officer who had started out as an enlisted man, earned his star in a long career in the Army National Guard.\n\nUnlike other non-citizen veterans, veterans of the Philippine Division and other Filipinos who fought as part of the [[USAFFE]] were never granted citizenship. Since 1993, various bills have been introduced to the [[United States Congress]] under the name [[Filipino Veterans Fairness Act]] to rectify this. However, this was a complicated matter as after the liberation of the Philippines members of the Philippine Scouts were offered enlistments and in some applicable cases commissions in the US Army and subsequent citizenship. Large numbers of \"old\" Philippine Scouts (those enlisting before or during World War II) took advantage of this. However, most \"new\" Philippine Scouts (those recruited following the war, mostly for occupation duty on Okinawa and elsewhere) were not offered citizenship. Language similar to the aforementioned proposed legislation was inserted by the Senate into the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]<ref>{{cite news |first=Rick|last=Maze |title=Senate puts Filipino vet pensions in stimulus |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/01/military_filipinoscouts_stimulus_012909w/ |format=News article |work=Army Times |date=2008-01-29|accessdate=2009-01-30 |quote=Buried inside the Senate bill, which includes tax cuts and new spending initiatives intended to create jobs in the U.S., the Filipino payment was inserted at the urging of Sen.

This provided a one-time payment to those veterans who are recognized as being soldiers or recognized guerrilla members by the United States or their surviving spouse. Even this, however, falls far short of the benefits available to similar veterans of other units.\n\nIn 2012, a [[documentary film]] named ''Forgotten Soldiers'' was produced by Donald A.
