There are estimated to be over 150 such objects around the country. There are big things in every state and territory in [[Australia (continent)|continental Australia]]. The Biggest and Best thing lives in Brisbane, under the alias atariangel. You have no idea how big. \n\nMost big things began as [[tourist trap]]s found along major roads between destinations.\n\nThe big things have become something of a [[Cult following|cult]] phenomenon, and are sometimes used as an excuse for a [[road trip]], where many or all big things are visited and used as a backdrop to a group photograph. Many of the big things are considered works of [[folk art]] and have been heritage-listed, though others have come under threat of demolition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/big-brash-and-finally-treasured-20090714-djdi.html|title=Big, brash and finally treasured|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=14 July 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140405005825/http://www.smh.com.au/travel/big-brash-and-finally-treasured-20090714-djdi.html|archivedate=5 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/australias-big-problem-what-to-do-with-our-ageing-super-sized-statues-83424|title=Australia's 'big' problem \u2013 what to do with our ageing super-sized statues?|last=Clarke|first=Amy|work=The Conversation|access-date=1 December 2017|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201081540/https://theconversation.com/australias-big-problem-what-to-do-with-our-ageing-super-sized-statues-83424|archivedate=1 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==List of big things (by state or territory)==\n\n===Australian Capital Territory===\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Name\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Location\n! style=\"width:5%;\"| Built\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Size\n! style=\"width:35%;\"| Notes\n! style=\"width:8%;\"| Image\n|-\n| Big Acorns\n| [[Molonglo Valley, Australian Capital Territory|Molonglo Valley]]\n| 2013\n| \n| Architectural art incorporating large scale acorns into children's play equipment.\nPod playground featuring giant banksia seeds and nest swings that can be located at the [[National Arboretum Canberra]]\n|[[File:Molonglo Valley - BIG Acorn Playground.jpg|200px]]\n|-\n| Big Bogong Moths\n| [[Acton, Australian Capital Territory|Acton]]\n| 2001\n| \n| Designed by Ngunnawal artist Jim Williams and created by Matthew Harding these 6 larger than life [[bogong moth]]s constructed with cast concrete can currently be located at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies.\n| [[File:Acton - BIG Moths.jpg|200px]]\n|-\n| Big Coins\n|[[Deakin, Australian Capital Territory|Deakin]]\n| \n| \n| A building embellishment for the Australian Royal MINT representing the decimal currency of Australia\n|[[File:Deakin - BIG Coins.jpg|200px]]\n|-\n|Big Galahs\n|Watson\n|\n|\n|Located on Antill Street, Watson\n|[[File:The Big Gallah's.jpg|200px]]\n|-\n| Giant Mushroom\n| [[Belconnen, Australian Capital Territory|Belconnen]]\n| 1998\n|{{convert|8|x|4|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n| Located in the Belconnen Fresh Food Markets,<ref>{{cite news | title = How we can become the next Big Thing | date = 31 July 2005 | work = [[Canberra Times]] }}</ref> the Giant Mushroom shelters a children's playground.

Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably.

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

The downturn in industry in the late 20th century caused a loss of many jobs, leaving many people in poverty.

Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.\n\nCincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and  [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

It uses [[Pressure sensor|pressure sensors]] to add another method of input to Apple's devices.<ref name=\"Force Touch - Apple Developer\">{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/macos/force-touch/|title=Force Touch - Apple Developer|website=www.developer.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref><ref name=\"3D Touch - iOS - Apple Developer\">{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/ios/3d-touch/|title=3D Touch - iOS - Apple Developer|website=www.developer.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> The technology was first unveiled on September 9, 2014, during the introduction of [[Apple Watch]]. Starting with the Apple Watch, Force Touch has been incorporated into many products within Apple's lineup. This notably includes [[MacBook family|MacBooks]] and the [[Magic Trackpad 2]]. The technology is known as '''3D Touch''' on the [[iPhone]] models. The technology brings [[usability]] enhancements to the software by offering a third dimension to accept input. Accessing shortcuts, previewing details, drawing art and system wide features enable users to additionally interact with the displayed content by applying force on the input surface.\n\n3D Touch has 3 levels of input based on the pressure sensitivity. This enables users to customize a preference of light, medium, or firm press on the iPhone's screen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-my/HT205056|title=Change 3D Touch sensitivity on your iPhone - Apple Support|website=www.support.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> Force Touch on the other hand, has two layers of interaction. Apple's [[haptic technology|haptic]] engine called the Taptic Engine resides in these devices, which houses a [[linear actuator]] producing vibratory effects as feedback. Apple allows application developers to leverage the pressure sensitivity of trackpads and touchscreens into their own apps.\n\nHaptic Touch is a feature on the iPhone XR, iPhone 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max and iPhone SE (2nd generation) replacing 3D Touch. The screen itself is not pressure sensitive, but a long-press will trigger certain 3D Touch features (only ones for elements that do not have an action assigned to long press). It's called Haptic Touch because the Taptic Engine engine is still included on these iPhones.\n\n==User functionality==\n\nForce touch on Macs bring a variety of features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT204352|title=How to use the Force Touch trackpad - Apple Support|website=www.support.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> A few notable ones are:\n\n* Look up text to show more information from [[Dictionary (software)|Dictionary]], Wikipedia, etc.\n* Show an [[Apple Maps]] preview of an address location.\n* Add dates and events to [[Calendar (Apple)|Calendar]].\n* Preview details of flight numbers, tracking numbers and events.\n* Accelerate fast-forwarding and rewinding on [[QuickTime]] and [[iMovie]] using variable pressure.\n\n3D Touch on iPhones bring the following features<ref name=\"3D Touch - iOS - Apple Developer\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT204352|title=How to use the Force Touch trackpad - Apple Support|website=www.support.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref>, but are not limited to:\n\n* Quick Actions allow users to access shortcuts, many right from the Home screen.\n* Peek and Pop allows users to preview content and take actions on it, without having to open it. Pressing further, the user can pop into the content in the app.\n* Pressure Sensitivity allows creative apps to take advantage of the pressure-sensing display, for varying line thickness or giving a brush a changing style.\n* Holding down to preview Live Photos, enable multitasking, etc.\n* Pressing down on the keyboard displays a cursor which can be moved in two dimensions. Pressing again enters selection mode.\n\nForce Touch on Apple Watch brings some significant features<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imore.com/secret-apple-watch-options-14-force-touch-tips-your-wrist|title=Secret Apple Watch options: 14 Force Touch tips!|website=www.imore.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref>, such as:\n\n* See alternate watch faces from the current watch face.\n* Change [[emoji]] colours: yellow smiley face to red, red heart to blue or purple.\n* Get the analog, digital, graph, and hybrid modes on the stopwatch app.\n* Toggle between day, list, or today view on the calendar app.\n* See weather, rain predictions and temperature on the weather app.\n\n==Software==\n\nApple allows [[Programmer|application developers]] to integrate the force touch functionality into their applications. The [[Application programming interface|APIs]] facilitate the following interactions<ref name=\"Force Touch - Apple Developer\"/>:\n\n* Apps respond to a press of stronger pressure, providing a shortcut as an additional functionality.\n* Pressure sensitivity for drawing and creative apps to make lines thicker or give brushes a changing style.\n* Accelerators allow receiving pressure sensitivity, to give users greater control. Say, fast-forward in media playback can speed up as pressure increases.\n* [[Drag and drop]] to allow users react to a force gesture amidst the hold, to immediately open a new target for the drop.\n\n==Hardware==\n\n[[File:IPhone 6s - Taptic Engine-92994.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Taptic Engine embedded into the iPhone 6s]]\n\nOn iPhones, the [[Capacitive sensing|capacitive sensors]] are directly integrated into the display. When a press is detected, these capacitive sensors measure microscopic changes in the distance between the back light and the cover glass. On the Apple Watch, a series of [[electrode]]s line the curvature of the screen. When a press is detected, these electrodes determine the pressure applied. The trackpads deploy a similar mechanism, although sensory information is determined by a series of four sensors that align with the corners of the trackpad. The detected pressure is then relayed to the Taptic Engine, which is Apple's [[haptic technology|haptic feedback]] engine. The [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[linear actuator]] within the Taptic engine is capable of reaching its peak output in just one cycle and producing [[vibration]]s that last 10 milliseconds. Unlike typical motors, the linear actuator does not rotate but oscillates back and forth. The Taptic Engine produces immediate haptic feedback, without the need to offset the balance of mass. The haptic feedback produced may be accompanied by an audible tone.<ref name=\"Haptic Feedback - User Interaction - watchOS - Human Interface Guidelines - Apple Developer\">{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/watchos/user-interaction/haptic-feedback/|title=Haptic Feedback - User Interaction - watchOS - Human Interface Guidelines - Apple Developer|website=www.developer.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> This helps in gaining the user's attention in order to convey an important information such as a success, warning or a failure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/feedback/|title=Haptic Feedback - User Interaction - iOS - Human Interface Guidelines - Apple Developer|website=www.developer.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> Each haptic type is defined for a specific purpose, to convey a specific meaning.<ref name=\"Haptic Feedback - User Interaction - watchOS - Human Interface Guidelines - Apple Developer\"/>\n\n==Mechanics==\n\n[[File:IPhone 6s - Taptic Engine-92995.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Taptic Engine module used in the iPhone 6s]]\n\nThe touch sensitive interface could either be a trackpad or a touch screen. Multiple actuators are mechanically connected to the back of the input surface. The actuators are distributed along the surface, each at a separate contact location, to provide localized haptic feedback to the user. [[Piezoelectricity]] is used by actuators to convert the physically-induced vibration or the input displacement into an [[electrical signal]]. A [[Microcontroller|controller]] is configured to activate the actuators in and around the point of contact. The actuators at the point of contact induces [[waveform]]s to produce vibration. However, since there are multiple actuators around the point of contact, the vibration can [[Wave propagation|propagate]] to other locations, thus limiting the localization effect.

It uses [[Pressure sensor|pressure sensors]] to add another method of input to Apple's devices.<ref name=\"Force Touch - Apple Developer\">{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/macos/force-touch/|title=Force Touch - Apple Developer|website=www.developer.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref><ref name=\"3D Touch - iOS - Apple Developer\">{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/ios/3d-touch/|title=3D Touch - iOS - Apple Developer|website=www.developer.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> The technology was first unveiled on September 9, 2014, during the introduction of [[Apple Watch]]. Starting with the Apple Watch, Force Touch has been incorporated into many products within Apple's lineup. This notably includes [[MacBook family|MacBooks]] and the [[Magic Trackpad 2]]. The technology is known as '''3D Touch''' on the [[iPhone]] models. The technology brings [[usability]] enhancements to the software by offering a third dimension to accept input. Accessing shortcuts, previewing details, drawing art and system wide features enable users to additionally interact with the displayed content by applying force on the input surface.\n\n3D Touch has 3 levels of input based on the pressure sensitivity. This enables users to customize a preference of light, medium, or firm press on the iPhone's screen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-my/HT205056|title=Change 3D Touch sensitivity on your iPhone - Apple Support|website=www.support.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> Force Touch on the other hand, has two layers of interaction. Apple's [[haptic technology|haptic]] engine called the Taptic Engine resides in these devices, which houses a [[linear actuator]] producing vibratory effects as feedback. Apple allows application developers to leverage the pressure sensitivity of trackpads and touchscreens into their own apps.\n\nHaptic Touch is a feature on the iPhone XR, iPhone 11, 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max and iPhone SE (2nd) replacing 3D Touch. The screen itself is not pressure sensitive, but a long-press will trigger certain 3D Touch features (only ones for elements that do not have an action assigned to long press). It's called Haptic Touch because the Taptic Engine engine is still included on these iPhones.\n\n==User functionality==\n\nForce touch on Macs bring a variety of features.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT204352|title=How to use the Force Touch trackpad - Apple Support|website=www.support.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> A few notable ones are:\n\n* Look up text to show more information from [[Dictionary (software)|Dictionary]], Wikipedia, etc.\n* Show an [[Apple Maps]] preview of an address location.\n* Add dates and events to [[Calendar (Apple)|Calendar]].\n* Preview details of flight numbers, tracking numbers and events.\n* Accelerate fast-forwarding and rewinding on [[QuickTime]] and [[iMovie]] using variable pressure.\n\n3D Touch on iPhones bring the following features<ref name=\"3D Touch - iOS - Apple Developer\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-in/HT204352|title=How to use the Force Touch trackpad - Apple Support|website=www.support.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref>, but are not limited to:\n\n* Quick Actions allow users to access shortcuts, many right from the Home screen.\n* Peek and Pop allows users to preview content and take actions on it, without having to open it.

The [[Application programming interface|APIs]] facilitate the following interactions<ref name=\"Force Touch - Apple Developer\"/>:\n\n* Apps respond to a press of stronger pressure, providing a shortcut as an additional functionality.\n* Pressure sensitivity for drawing and creative apps to make lines thicker or give brushes a changing style.\n* Accelerators allow receiving pressure sensitivity, to give users greater control. Say, fast-forward in media playback can speed up as pressure increases.\n* [[Drag and drop]] to allow users react to a force gesture amidst the hold, to immediately open a new target for the drop.\n\n==Hardware==\n\n[[File:IPhone 6s - Taptic Engine-92994.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Taptic Engine embedded into the iPhone 6s]]\n\nOn iPhones, the [[Capacitive sensing|capacitive sensors]] are directly integrated into the display. When a press is detected, these capacitive sensors measure microscopic changes in the distance between the back light and the cover glass. On the Apple Watch, a series of [[electrode]]s line the curvature of the screen. When a press is detected, these electrodes determine the pressure applied. The trackpads deploy a similar mechanism, although sensory information is determined by a series of four sensors that align with the corners of the trackpad. The detected pressure is then relayed to the Taptic Engine, which is Apple's [[haptic technology|haptic feedback]] engine. The [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] [[linear actuator]] within the Taptic engine is capable of reaching its peak output in just one cycle and producing [[vibration]]s that last 10 milliseconds. Unlike typical motors, the linear actuator does not rotate but oscillates back and forth. The Taptic Engine produces immediate haptic feedback, without the need to offset the balance of mass. The haptic feedback produced may be accompanied by an audible tone.<ref name=\"Haptic Feedback - User Interaction - watchOS - Human Interface Guidelines - Apple Developer\">{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/watchos/user-interaction/haptic-feedback/|title=Haptic Feedback - User Interaction - watchOS - Human Interface Guidelines - Apple Developer|website=www.developer.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> This helps in gaining the user's attention in order to convey an important information such as a success, warning or a failure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/user-interaction/feedback/|title=Haptic Feedback - User Interaction - iOS - Human Interface Guidelines - Apple Developer|website=www.developer.apple.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> Each haptic type is defined for a specific purpose, to convey a specific meaning.<ref name=\"Haptic Feedback - User Interaction - watchOS - Human Interface Guidelines - Apple Developer\"/>\n\n==Mechanics==\n\n[[File:IPhone 6s - Taptic Engine-92995.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Taptic Engine module used in the iPhone 6s]]\n\nThe touch sensitive interface could either be a trackpad or a touch screen. Multiple actuators are mechanically connected to the back of the input surface. The actuators are distributed along the surface, each at a separate contact location, to provide localized haptic feedback to the user. [[Piezoelectricity]] is used by actuators to convert the physically-induced vibration or the input displacement into an [[electrical signal]]. A [[Microcontroller|controller]] is configured to activate the actuators in and around the point of contact. The actuators at the point of contact induces [[waveform]]s to produce vibration. However, since there are multiple actuators around the point of contact, the vibration can [[Wave propagation|propagate]] to other locations, thus limiting the localization effect. This is why a second set of actuators induce waveforms to suppress the vibratory cross-talk produced by the first set of actuators. This may be achieved by producing waveforms that provides [[Wave interference|interference]] in terms of [[amplitude]], [[frequency]] or both. The masking waveforms could also alter the vibration at contact locations by providing a user experience other than just suppressing the propagated vibrations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=33&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=(apple.ASNM.+AND+20130219.PD.)|title=United States Patent: 8378797|website=www.patft.uspto.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref>\n\n==Products==\n\nForce Touch or Haptic Touch technology is featured on the following Apple devices:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=row | Force Touch\n| [[MacBook]] generations: [[MacBook (Retina)|Retina]] \u00b7 [[MacBook Air|Air]] 2018 \u00b7 [[MacBook Pro|Pro]] from early 2015 onwards<br>[[Apple Watch]], [[Magic Trackpad 2]]\n|-\n! scope=row | Haptic Touch\n| [[iPhone]] generations: [[iPhone XR|XR]] \u00b7 [[iPhone 11|11]] \u00b7 [[iPhone 11 Pro|11 Pro]] \u00b7 [[iPhone 11 Pro Max|11 Pro Max]] \u00b7 [[iPhone SE (2nd generation)|SE (2nd)]]\n|}\n\n3D Touch technology was featured on the following Apple devices:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! scope=row | 3D Touch\n| [[iPhone]] generations: [[iPhone 6S|6S]] \u00b7 [[iPhone 6S Plus|6S Plus]] \u00b7 [[iPhone 7|7]] \u00b7 [[iPhone 7 Plus|7 Plus]] \u00b7 [[iPhone 8|8]] \u00b7 [[iPhone 8 Plus|8 Plus]] \u00b7 [[iPhone X|X]] \u00b7 [[iPhone XS|XS]] \u00b7 [[iPhone XS Max|XS Max]]\n|}\n\n== Litigation ==\n\n[[File:Immersion Logo.png|thumb|right|200px|Immersion Corp. filed the lawsuit in 2016, which was settled by 2018]]\n\nApple Inc. was subjected to a [[lawsuit]] by [[Immersion Corporation]] on February 11, 2016, due to allegations of [[Patent infringement|infringing patents]] owned by Immersion on 3D Touch technology.
