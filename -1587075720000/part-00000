There is pre-degree school in Funtua a few kilometres from main campus owned by the university. The Samaru campus houses the administrative offices and the faculties of physical sciences, life sciences, social sciences, arts and languages, education, environmental design, engineering, medical sciences, agricultural sciences and research facilities. The Kongo campus hosts the faculties of Law and Administration. The Faculty of Administration consists of Accounting, Business Administration, Local Government and Development Studies and Public Administration Departments. Additionally, the university is responsible for other institutions and programmes at other locations.\n\nIt is named after the Sardauna of [[Sokoto]], Alhaji Sir [[Ahmadu Bello]], the first premier of Northern Nigeria.\n\nThe university runs a wide variety of undergraduate and graduate programmes (and offers associate degrees and vocational and remedial programmes). It has a large medical programme with its own ABU Teaching Hospital, one of the largest teaching hospitals in Nigeria and Africa.\n\n== Faculties ==\nThe University has thirteen faculties:\n\n*\n*\n* Faculty of Administration\n* Faculty of Agriculture\n* Faculty of Arts\n* Faculty of Education\n* Faculty of Engineering\n* Faculty of Environmental Design\n* Faculty of Law\n* Faculty of Life Science\n* Faculty of Medicine\n* Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science\n* Faculty of Physical Science\n* Faculty of Social Science\n* Faculty of Veterinary Medicine\n\nThe university also has a Division of Agric Collages (DAC) a research institution established before the university was but later merged with the university. \n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation and first years===\nAs Nigeria approached independence on October 1, 1960, it had only a single university: the [[University of Ibadan]], established in 1948. The important [[Ashby Commission]] report<ref>Sir Eric Ashby.  ''Investment in Education: The Report of the Commission on Post-School Certificate and Higher Education'' (Lagos, 1960)</ref> (submitted a month before independence) recommended adding new universities in each of Nigeria's then-three regions and the capital, [[Lagos]]. Even before the report, however, the regional governments had begun planning universities. In May 1960, the Northern Region had upgraded the School of Arabic Studies in [[Kano]] to become the Ahmadu Bello College for Arabic and Islamic Studies. (The college was named after the region's dominant political leader, Alhaji Sir Ahmadu Bello.)\n\nThe Ashby Commission report recommendations gave a new impetus and direction. It was ultimately decided to create a University of Northern Nigeria at Zaria (rather than Kano). The university would take over the facilities of the Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology at Samaru just outside Zaria, and would incorporate the Ahmadu Bello College in Kano, the Agricultural Research Institute at Samaru, the Institute of Administration at Zaria, and the Veterinary Research Institute at Vom on the [[Jos Plateau]]. The law establishing the new university was passed by the Northern Region legislature in 1961. It was decided to name the university after Ahmadu Bello, and the Kano college took the name of [[Abdullahi Bayero]], a past Emir of Kano.\n\nAt the opening on 4 October 1962, thanks in part to absorbing existing institutions, ABU claimed four faculties comprising 15 departments.<ref>Details on all aspects of ABU's development are provided in the chapters and appendices of ''A History of Ahmadu Bello University, 1962\u20131987,'' Ahmadu Bello University Press, Zaria, 1989.</ref> Students in all programmes numbered only 426.\n\nThe challenges were enormous. Over 60 years of British colonial rule, education in the Northern Region had lagged far behind that of the two southern regions. Few students from the north had qualifications for university entrance, and fewer still northerners had qualifications for teaching appointments. Of the original student body, only 147 were from the north.\n\nABU's first vice chancellor (principal administrator and leader) was British, as were most of the professorial appointments. Only two Nigerians \u2014 Dr. [[Iya Abubakar]] (Mathematics) and Adamu Baikie (Education) \u2014 were among the earliest round of faculty appointments. Facilities on the main Samaru campus were inadequate, and the administration and integration of the physically separated pre-existing institutions was difficult.\n\nNevertheless, under the vice chancellorship of Dr. [[Norman Alexander]], academic and administrative staffing was developed, new departments and programmes were created, major building plans were undertaken, and student enrollments grew rapidly. By the end of Alexander's tenure (1965\u201366), almost 1,000 students were enrolled. The [[New Zealand]]-born Alexander, from 1966, became a kind of \"freelance vice-chancellor\", offering his expertise to help in the setting up of other [[Commonwealth]] universities in the [[West Indies]], [[Fiji]] and Africa.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituarysir-norman-alexander-1265280.html | work=The Independent | title=Obituary:Sir Norman Alexander | date=5 April 1997 | accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Development through the middle 1970s===\n\nIn 1966, Dr. Alexander was succeeded as ABU vice chancellor by Dr. [[Ishaya Audu|Ishaya Shuaibu Audu]], a pediatrician and associate professor at the [[University of Lagos]]. Audu had been born in Wusasa, near Zaria, in 1928. A native Hausa, he was ABU's first Nigerian vice chancellor and a northerner. However, his membership in the Hausa Christian community of Wusasa probably had some later impact on his tenure.\n\nABU was seriously affected by the coups and the anti-Igbo riots of 1966. But, under Dr. Audu's leadership, ABU was to grow and develop at an even faster pace. Growth in student enrollments had been held hostage to growth and development of A-level training at the secondary school level. So beginning in 1968\u201369 ABU broke free from the British three-year heritage and established the School of Basic Studies to provide advanced secondary pre-degree training on campus.<ref>See ''History of Ahmadu Bello University,'' p. 270.</ref> Students who entered through the School of Basic Studies essentially embarked on a four-year programme toward a bachelor's degree.\n\nOpposed initially by some, the school proved a great success and enrollments expanded even more rapidly. By its tenth year ABU total enrollments including non- and pre-degree programmes were put at over 7,000 of which more than half were in degree programmes. In its first ten years, the University of Ibadan produced 615 graduates. At ABU the corresponding figure after 10 years was 2,333 first degrees, along with several advanced degrees.<ref>''Ten Years: The First Decade of Ahmadu Bello University, October 1962-October 1972,'' Ahmadu Bello University Press, Zaria, 1972; and ''History of Ahmadu Bello University,'' pp. 267\u2013282.</ref>\n\nFrom the beginning, ABU was remarkable for the breadth of its ambition. In its institutions, but mainly on or close by the main campus by Samaru, ABU was creating a range of programmes that only the very most comprehensive of U.S. state universities could have matched. Ranging far beyond the standard fields of the arts, languages, social sciences and sciences, it included engineering, medicine (the Zaria hospital was an ABU teaching hospital), pharmacy, architecture, and a wide variety of agricultural departments including veterinary medicine.\n\nWhat was called the Kongo campus just outside the old city in Zaria taught [[public administration]] and carried out a programme of in-service training for local government throughout the north. The Faculty of Law was based at the Kongo campus. The Faculty of Education taught education courses and managed the Advanced Teacher's Colleges in the northern states. At the Kano campus (now called Abdullahi Bayero College) ABU taught courses in Hausa, Arabic and Islamic studies.\n\nABU was likewise remarkable among Nigeria's universities for the breadth and national character of its student recruitment. ABU had been founded to be the University of Northern Nigeria. Yet, more than any other of Nigeria's universities, ABU has served students from every state of the Nigerian federation.<ref>Paul Beckett and James O\u2019Connell, ''Education and Power in Nigeria,'' Hodder and Stoughton, 1977, pp. 26\u201330; and ''History of Ahmadu Bello University,'' Appendix V and VI, pp. 280\u20131.</ref>\n\nProfessorial staffing to serve the burgeoning student enrollments and course offerings was a potential limitation during this period. In the early 1970s relatively abundant funding made it possible to send some senior academic staff to overseas institutions to complete advanced degrees. A small but increasing number of Nigerians with Ph.D.s or other advanced degrees were returning from abroad (but ABU had to compete with other Nigerian universities to recruit them). In the meantime, appointment of expatriate teaching staff was essential and it expanded greatly and diversified in nationalities. Vice chancellor Audu endeavored to balance the goals of Nigerianization (and \"northernization\") of ABU's professors with the commitment to maintaining all programmes at an international level of academic quality.\n\nBy 1975, this balance was strained. The teaching faculty remained more than half expatriate overall; at senior levels still more so.<ref>''History of Ahmadu Bello University,'' Table X, p. 307.</ref> The development of Nigerian staffing (and especially of northern-origin teaching staff) was perceived as too slow. In 1975, ABU turned toward a much heavier emphasis on internal staff development as it adopted the Graduate Assistantship programme. Under this programme, the best graduates from the departments\u2019 undergraduate programmes are recruited to join the department as staff-in-training and undertake advanced training as they gain on-the-job experience. Within a few years, a significant proportion of ABU senior staff were products of the internal training programmes. From 1975, the proportion of expatriate teaching staff diminished rapidly.<ref>See Chapter Ten (\"Staff Recruitment and Development in ABU, 1962\u20131987\") in ''History of Ahmadu Bello University,'' pp. 196\u2013219.</ref>\n\n===Later development===\n\nBy the end of the vice chancellorship of Ishaya Audu (mid-1975), ABU was solidly established as Nigeria's largest university and among Africa's academically strongest university institutions. Strong growth has continued. But ABU has been increasingly buffeted by external events and challenges. No vice-chancellorship has been as long (or, arguably, as successful) as that of Ishaya Audu. Beginning in the early 1980s, ABU was hit with sharply reduced funding as the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] imposed the [[Structural Adjustment Programme]]: the value of the national currency plummeted in relation to international currencies. Staff salaries were reduced rapidly in cost-of-living terms, and funding for facilities, library acquisitions, and other necessary resources was abruptly curtailed. Further, ABU increasingly competed for students, staff and funding with all the other institutions in the rapidly expanding Nigerian [[List of universities in Nigeria|university system]].\n\nIn May 1986 the security forces killed around 20 demonstrators and bystanders at ABU in order to prevent a peaceful demonstration against the implementation of the Structural Adjustment Programme.<ref>{{cite web|title=Structural Adjustment Program|url=http://www.whirledbank.org/development/sap.html|publisher=The Whirled Bank Group|accessdate=11 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, ABU has been affected by national political instability. The very fact of ABU's strikingly \"national character\" (in drawing students and staff from an unusually broad range of Nigeria's regional, ethnic and religious communities) may incline the institution to internal instability. ABU has been among Nigeria's universities that have suffered most from closures.\n\nYet ABU continues to occupy a particularly important place among Nigerian universities. As it approaches its half-century anniversary, ABU can claim to be the largest and the most extensive of universities in Sub-Saharan Africa.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} It covers a land area of 7,000 hectares and encompasses 12 academic faculties, a postgraduate school and 82 academic departments. It has five institutes, six specialized centers, a Division of Agricultural Colleges, demonstration secondary and primary schools, as well as extension and consultancy services which provide services to the wider society. The total student enrollment in the university's degree and sub-degree programmes is about 35,000, drawn from every state of Nigeria, from Africa, and from the rest of world. There are about 1,400 academic and research staff and 5,000 support staff.\n\nThe university has nurtured two new institutions: [[Bayero University Kano]] and the [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University]] of Technology, Bauchi. Some 27 tertiary institutions made up of colleges of education, polytechnics and schools of basic or preliminary studies are affiliated to it.\n\n==Administration==\n{{See also|List of Ahmadu Bello University chancellors}}\nAhmadu Bello University has a [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] as its ceremonial head, while the [[vice-chancellor]] is the chief executive and academic officer.

There is pre-degree school in Funtua a few kilometres from main campus owned by the university. The Samaru campus houses the administrative offices and the faculties of physical sciences, life sciences, social sciences, arts and languages, education, environmental design, engineering, medical sciences, agricultural sciences and research facilities. The Kongo campus hosts the faculties of Law and Administration. The Faculty of Administration consists of Accounting, Business Administration, Local Government and Development Studies and Public Administration Departments. Additionally, the university is responsible for other institutions and programmes at other locations.\n\nIt is named after the Sardauna of [[Sokoto]], Alhaji Sir [[Ahmadu Bello]], the first premier of Northern Nigeria.\n\nThe university runs a wide variety of undergraduate and graduate programmes (and offers associate degrees and vocational and remedial programmes). It has a large medical programme with its own ABU Teaching Hospital, one of the largest teaching hospitals in Nigeria and Africa.\n\n== Faculties ==\nThe University has thirteen faculties:\n\n*\n*\n* Faculty of Administration\n* Faculty of Agriculture\n* Faculty of Arts\n* Faculty of Education\n* Faculty of Engineering\n* Faculty of Environmental Design\n* Faculty of Law\n* Faculty of Life Science\n* Faculty of Medicine\n* Faculty of Pharmaceutical Science\n* Faculty of Physical Science\n* Faculty of Social Science\n* Faculty of Veterinary Medicine\n\n==History==\n\n===Foundation and first years===\nAs Nigeria approached independence on October 1, 1960, it had only a single university: the [[University of Ibadan]], established in 1948. The important [[Ashby Commission]] report<ref>Sir Eric Ashby.  ''Investment in Education: The Report of the Commission on Post-School Certificate and Higher Education'' (Lagos, 1960)</ref> (submitted a month before independence) recommended adding new universities in each of Nigeria's then-three regions and the capital, [[Lagos]]. Even before the report, however, the regional governments had begun planning universities. In May 1960, the Northern Region had upgraded the School of Arabic Studies in [[Kano]] to become the Ahmadu Bello College for Arabic and Islamic Studies. (The college was named after the region's dominant political leader, Alhaji Sir Ahmadu Bello.)\n\nThe Ashby Commission report recommendations gave a new impetus and direction. It was ultimately decided to create a University of Northern Nigeria at Zaria (rather than Kano). The university would take over the facilities of the Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology at Samaru just outside Zaria, and would incorporate the Ahmadu Bello College in Kano, the Agricultural Research Institute at Samaru, the Institute of Administration at Zaria, and the Veterinary Research Institute at Vom on the [[Jos Plateau]]. The law establishing the new university was passed by the Northern Region legislature in 1961. It was decided to name the university after Ahmadu Bello, and the Kano college took the name of [[Abdullahi Bayero]], a past Emir of Kano.\n\nAt the opening on 4 October 1962, thanks in part to absorbing existing institutions, ABU claimed four faculties comprising 15 departments.<ref>Details on all aspects of ABU's development are provided in the chapters and appendices of ''A History of Ahmadu Bello University, 1962\u20131987,'' Ahmadu Bello University Press, Zaria, 1989.</ref> Students in all programmes numbered only 426.\n\nThe challenges were enormous. Over 60 years of British colonial rule, education in the Northern Region had lagged far behind that of the two southern regions. Few students from the north had qualifications for university entrance, and fewer still northerners had qualifications for teaching appointments. Of the original student body, only 147 were from the north.\n\nABU's first vice chancellor (principal administrator and leader) was British, as were most of the professorial appointments. Only two Nigerians \u2014 Dr. [[Iya Abubakar]] (Mathematics) and Adamu Baikie (Education) \u2014 were among the earliest round of faculty appointments. Facilities on the main Samaru campus were inadequate, and the administration and integration of the physically separated pre-existing institutions was difficult.\n\nNevertheless, under the vice chancellorship of Dr. [[Norman Alexander]], academic and administrative staffing was developed, new departments and programmes were created, major building plans were undertaken, and student enrollments grew rapidly. By the end of Alexander's tenure (1965\u201366), almost 1,000 students were enrolled. The [[New Zealand]]-born Alexander, from 1966, became a kind of \"freelance vice-chancellor\", offering his expertise to help in the setting up of other [[Commonwealth]] universities in the [[West Indies]], [[Fiji]] and Africa.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituarysir-norman-alexander-1265280.html | work=The Independent | title=Obituary:Sir Norman Alexander | date=5 April 1997 | accessdate=19 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Development through the middle 1970s===\n\nIn 1966, Dr. Alexander was succeeded as ABU vice chancellor by Dr. [[Ishaya Audu|Ishaya Shuaibu Audu]], a pediatrician and associate professor at the [[University of Lagos]]. Audu had been born in Wusasa, near Zaria, in 1928. A native Hausa, he was ABU's first Nigerian vice chancellor and a northerner. However, his membership in the Hausa Christian community of Wusasa probably had some later impact on his tenure.\n\nABU was seriously affected by the coups and the anti-Igbo riots of 1966. But, under Dr. Audu's leadership, ABU was to grow and develop at an even faster pace. Growth in student enrollments had been held hostage to growth and development of A-level training at the secondary school level. So beginning in 1968\u201369 ABU broke free from the British three-year heritage and established the School of Basic Studies to provide advanced secondary pre-degree training on campus.<ref>See ''History of Ahmadu Bello University,'' p. 270.</ref> Students who entered through the School of Basic Studies essentially embarked on a four-year programme toward a bachelor's degree.\n\nOpposed initially by some, the school proved a great success and enrollments expanded even more rapidly. By its tenth year ABU total enrollments including non- and pre-degree programmes were put at over 7,000 of which more than half were in degree programmes. In its first ten years, the University of Ibadan produced 615 graduates. At ABU the corresponding figure after 10 years was 2,333 first degrees, along with several advanced degrees.<ref>''Ten Years: The First Decade of Ahmadu Bello University, October 1962-October 1972,'' Ahmadu Bello University Press, Zaria, 1972; and ''History of Ahmadu Bello University,'' pp. 267\u2013282.</ref>\n\nFrom the beginning, ABU was remarkable for the breadth of its ambition. In its institutions, but mainly on or close by the main campus by Samaru, ABU was creating a range of programmes that only the very most comprehensive of U.S. state universities could have matched. Ranging far beyond the standard fields of the arts, languages, social sciences and sciences, it included engineering, medicine (the Zaria hospital was an ABU teaching hospital), pharmacy, architecture, and a wide variety of agricultural departments including veterinary medicine.\n\nWhat was called the Kongo campus just outside the old city in Zaria taught [[public administration]] and carried out a programme of in-service training for local government throughout the north. The Faculty of Law was based at the Kongo campus. The Faculty of Education taught education courses and managed the Advanced Teacher's Colleges in the northern states. At the Kano campus (now called Abdullahi Bayero College) ABU taught courses in Hausa, Arabic and Islamic studies.\n\nABU was likewise remarkable among Nigeria's universities for the breadth and national character of its student recruitment. ABU had been founded to be the University of Northern Nigeria. Yet, more than any other of Nigeria's universities, ABU has served students from every state of the Nigerian federation.<ref>Paul Beckett and James O\u2019Connell, ''Education and Power in Nigeria,'' Hodder and Stoughton, 1977, pp. 26\u201330; and ''History of Ahmadu Bello University,'' Appendix V and VI, pp. 280\u20131.</ref>\n\nProfessorial staffing to serve the burgeoning student enrollments and course offerings was a potential limitation during this period. In the early 1970s relatively abundant funding made it possible to send some senior academic staff to overseas institutions to complete advanced degrees. A small but increasing number of Nigerians with Ph.D.s or other advanced degrees were returning from abroad (but ABU had to compete with other Nigerian universities to recruit them). In the meantime, appointment of expatriate teaching staff was essential and it expanded greatly and diversified in nationalities. Vice chancellor Audu endeavored to balance the goals of Nigerianization (and \"northernization\") of ABU's professors with the commitment to maintaining all programmes at an international level of academic quality.\n\nBy 1975, this balance was strained. The teaching faculty remained more than half expatriate overall; at senior levels still more so.<ref>''History of Ahmadu Bello University,'' Table X, p. 307.</ref> The development of Nigerian staffing (and especially of northern-origin teaching staff) was perceived as too slow. In 1975, ABU turned toward a much heavier emphasis on internal staff development as it adopted the Graduate Assistantship programme. Under this programme, the best graduates from the departments\u2019 undergraduate programmes are recruited to join the department as staff-in-training and undertake advanced training as they gain on-the-job experience. Within a few years, a significant proportion of ABU senior staff were products of the internal training programmes. From 1975, the proportion of expatriate teaching staff diminished rapidly.<ref>See Chapter Ten (\"Staff Recruitment and Development in ABU, 1962\u20131987\") in ''History of Ahmadu Bello University,'' pp. 196\u2013219.</ref>\n\n===Later development===\n\nBy the end of the vice chancellorship of Ishaya Audu (mid-1975), ABU was solidly established as Nigeria's largest university and among Africa's academically strongest university institutions. Strong growth has continued. But ABU has been increasingly buffeted by external events and challenges. No vice-chancellorship has been as long (or, arguably, as successful) as that of Ishaya Audu. Beginning in the early 1980s, ABU was hit with sharply reduced funding as the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] imposed the [[Structural Adjustment Programme]]: the value of the national currency plummeted in relation to international currencies. Staff salaries were reduced rapidly in cost-of-living terms, and funding for facilities, library acquisitions, and other necessary resources was abruptly curtailed. Further, ABU increasingly competed for students, staff and funding with all the other institutions in the rapidly expanding Nigerian [[List of universities in Nigeria|university system]].\n\nIn May 1986 the security forces killed around 20 demonstrators and bystanders at ABU in order to prevent a peaceful demonstration against the implementation of the Structural Adjustment Programme.<ref>{{cite web|title=Structural Adjustment Program|url=http://www.whirledbank.org/development/sap.html|publisher=The Whirled Bank Group|accessdate=11 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, ABU has been affected by national political instability. The very fact of ABU's strikingly \"national character\" (in drawing students and staff from an unusually broad range of Nigeria's regional, ethnic and religious communities) may incline the institution to internal instability. ABU has been among Nigeria's universities that have suffered most from closures.\n\nYet ABU continues to occupy a particularly important place among Nigerian universities. As it approaches its half-century anniversary, ABU can claim to be the largest and the most extensive of universities in Sub-Saharan Africa.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} It covers a land area of 7,000 hectares and encompasses 12 academic faculties, a postgraduate school and 82 academic departments. It has five institutes, six specialized centers, a Division of Agricultural Colleges, demonstration secondary and primary schools, as well as extension and consultancy services which provide services to the wider society. The total student enrollment in the university's degree and sub-degree programmes is about 35,000, drawn from every state of Nigeria, from Africa, and from the rest of world. There are about 1,400 academic and research staff and 5,000 support staff.\n\nThe university has nurtured two new institutions: [[Bayero University Kano]] and the [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University]] of Technology, Bauchi. Some 27 tertiary institutions made up of colleges of education, polytechnics and schools of basic or preliminary studies are affiliated to it.\n\n==Administration==\n{{See also|List of Ahmadu Bello University chancellors}}\nAhmadu Bello University has a [[Chancellor (education)|chancellor]] as its ceremonial head, while the [[vice-chancellor]] is the chief executive and academic officer. The vice-chancellor is usually appointed for a five-year, non-renewable term.

Methylation of histones can either increase or decrease transcription of genes, depending on which amino acids in the histones are methylated, and how many methyl groups are attached. Methylation events that weaken chemical attractions between histone tails and DNA increase transcription because they enable the DNA to uncoil from nucleosomes so that transcription factor proteins and RNA polymerase can access the DNA. This process is critical for the regulation of gene expression that allows different cells to express different genes.\n\n==Function==\nHistone methylation, as a mechanism for modifying [[chromatin]] structure is associated with stimulation of neural pathways known to be important for formation of [[long-term memories]] and learning.<ref name=\"Perry\">{{cite journal|last=Kramer|first=Jamie M.|title=Epigenetic regulation of memory: implications in human cognitive disorders|journal=Biomolecular Concepts|date=February 2013|volume=4|issue=1|pages=1\u201312|doi=10.1515/bmc-2012-0026|hdl=2066/118379|hdl-access=free}}<!--|accessdate=21 February 2013--></ref> Animal models have shown methylation and other epigenetic regulation mechanisms to be associated with conditions of aging, [[neurodegenerative diseases]], and intellectual disability<ref name=\"Perry\" /> (Rubinstein\u2013Taybi Syndrome, X-linked mental retardation).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lilja|first=Tobias|author2=Nina Heldring |author3=Ola Hermanson |title=Like a rolling histone: Epigenetic regulation of neural stem cells and brain development by factors controlling histone acetylation and methylation|journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - General Subjects|date=February 2013|volume=1830|issue=2|pages=2354\u20132360|doi=10.1016/j.bbagen.2012.08.011|doi-access=free}}<!--|accessdate=21 February 2013--></ref>\nThis modification alters the properties of the [[nucleosome]] and affects its interactions with other proteins, particularly in regards to gene transcription processes.  \n* Histone methylation can be associated with either transcriptional [[Repressor|repression]] or [[Operon|activation]].

Lysine is able to be mono-, di-, or trimethylated with a methyl group replacing each hydrogen of its NH3+ group. With a free NH2 and NH2+ group, arginine is able to be mono- or dimethylated.

When dimethylated, the residue provides a platform for the binding of protein 53BP1 involved in the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks by non-homologous end joining. H4K20me3 is observed to be concentrated in heterochromatin and reductions in this trimethylation are observed in cancer progression.

There are instances of the core globular domains of histones being methylated as well.\n\nThe histone methyltransferases are specific to either lysine or arginine. The lysine-specific transferases are further broken down into whether or not they have a SET domain or a non-SET domain.

Mutations that occur to increase and decrease methylation have great changes on gene regulation, while mutations to enzymes such as [[methyltransferase]] and demethyltransferase can completely alter which proteins are transcribed in a given cell. Over methylation of a chromosome can cause certain genes that are necessary for normal cell function, to become inactivated. In a certain yeast strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a mutation that causes three lysine residues on the third histone, H3K4, H3K36, and H3K79, to become methylated causes a delay in the mitotic cell cycle, as many genes required for this progression are inactivated. This extreme mutation leads to the death of the organism. It has been discovered that the deletion of genes that will eventually allow for the production of histone methyltransferase allows this organism to live as its lysine residues are not methylated.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Jin | first1 = Y. | last2 = Rodriguez | first2 = A.

Cancer can be caused in a variety of ways due to differential methylation of histones.

Methylation of histones can either increase or decrease transcription of genes, depending on which amino acids in the histones are methylated, and how many methyl groups are attached. Methylation events that weaken chemical attractions between histone tails and DNA increase transcription because they enable the DNA to uncoil from nucleosomes so that transcription factor proteins and RNA polymerase can access the DNA.
