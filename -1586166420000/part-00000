(''The Sky: Order and Chaos'' by [[Jean-Pierre Verdet]], from the '[[New Horizons (Thames & Hudson)|New Horizons]]' series)]]\nIn [[Western astrology]], '''astrological signs''' are the twelve 30\u00b0 sectors of the [[ecliptic]], starting at the [[vernal equinox]] (one of the intersections of the ecliptic with the [[celestial equator]]), also known as the First Point of Aries. The order of the astrological signs is [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]], [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]], [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]], [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]], [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]], [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]], [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]], [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]], [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] and [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]]. Each sector was named for a constellation it was passing through in times of naming.\n\nThe concept of the [[zodiac]] originated in [[Babylonian astrology]], and was later influenced by [[Hellenistic astrology|Hellenistic]] culture. According to [[astrology]], celestial phenomena relate to human activity on the principle of \"[[Macrocosm and microcosm|as above, so below]]\", so that the signs are held to represent characteristic modes of expression.<ref>Mayo (1979), p. 35.</ref> Modern discoveries about the true nature of celestial objects have undermined the theoretical basis for assigning meaning to astrological signs, and empirical scientific investigation has shown that predictions and recommendations based on these systems are not accurate.<ref name=\"Cosmic\">{{cite book |author1=Jeffrey Bennett |author2=Megan Donohue |author3=Nicholas Schneider |author4=Mark Voit |title=The cosmic perspective |url=https://archive.org/details/astronomymediawo04lopr |url-access=registration |year=2007 |publisher=Pearson/Addison-Wesley |location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=0-8053-9283-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/astronomymediawo04lopr/page/82 82\u201384] |edition=4th}}</ref>{{rp|85;}}<ref name=Zarka>{{cite journal |last=Zarka |first=Philippe |title=Astronomy and astrology |journal=Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union |year=2011 |volume=5 |issue=S260 |pages=420\u2013425 |doi=10.1017/S1743921311002602|url=https://zenodo.org/record/890932/files/article.pdf }}</ref>{{rp|424}} Astrology is generally regarded as [[pseudoscience]].\n\nVarious approaches to measuring and dividing the sky are currently used by differing systems of astrology, although the tradition of the Zodiac's names and symbols remain consistent. Western astrology measures from [[Equinox]] and [[Solstice]] points (points relating to equal, longest and shortest days of the [[tropical year]]), while [[Jyoti\u1e63a]] or [[Vedic astrology]] measures along the equatorial plane ([[sidereal year]]). [[Precession]] results in Western astrology's zodiacal divisions not corresponding in the current era to the [[constellations]] that carry similar names,<ref>Bobrick (2005), pp. 10, 23.</ref> while [[Jyoti\u1e63a]] measurements still correspond with the background constellations.<ref>Johnsen (2004).</ref>\n\n== Western zodiac signs ==\n=== History and symbolism ===\n{{main|Zodiac|History of astrology}}\n{{further|Babylonian astrology|Hellenistic astrology|Ancient Egyptian astronomy}}\n[[Image:Sign cusps.png|250px|thumb|right|The twelve ecliptic signs.

The intersection of the celestial equator and the ecliptic define the equinoctial points: First Point of Aries ([[Image:Aries.svg|11px]]) and First Point of Libra ([[Image:Libra.svg|11px]]). The [[great circle]] containing the celestial poles and the ecliptic poles (P and P'), intersect the ecliptic at 0\u00b0 Cancer ([[Image:Cancer.svg|11px]]) and 0\u00b0 Capricorn ([[Image:Capricorn.svg|12px]]). In this illustration, the Sun is schematically positioned at the start of Aquarius ([[Image:Aquarius.svg|11px]]).]]\n[[Western astrology]] is a direct continuation of [[Hellenistic astrology]] as recorded by [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century. Hellenistic astrology in turn was partly based on concepts from [[Babylonian astrology|Babylonian tradition]]. Specifically, the division of the ecliptic in twelve equal sectors is a Babylonian conceptual construction.<ref>Sachs (1948), p. 289.\nIsolated references to celestial \"signs\" in Sumerian sources are insufficient to speak of a Sumerian zodiac, see Rochberg (1998), p. ''ix''.</ref> \n\nBy the 4th century BC, Babylonian astronomy and its system of celestial omens had an influence on the culture of [[ancient Greece]], as did the astronomy of Egypt by late 2nd century BC. This resulted, unlike the Mesopotamian tradition, in a strong focus on the birth chart of the individual and in the creation of [[Horoscopic astrology]], employing the use of the [[Ascendant]] (the rising degree of the ecliptic, at the time of birth), and of the twelve [[House (astrology)|houses]]. Association of the astrological signs with [[Empedocles]]' four classical [[Classical element|elements]] was another important development in the characterization of the twelve signs.\n\nThe body of the Hellenistic astrological tradition as it stood by the 2nd century is described in Ptolemy's ''[[Tetrabiblos]]''. This is the seminal work for later astronomical tradition not only in the West but also in India and in the Islamic sphere, and has remained a reference for almost seventeen centuries as later traditions made few substantial changes to its core teachings.\n\nThe following table enumerates the twelve divisions of celestial longitude, with the Latin names (still widely used) and the English translation (gloss), which express the [[constellation]] they are named for. The longitude [[Interval (mathematics)#Notations for intervals|intervals]], are treated as closed for the first endpoint (''a'') and open for the second (''b'') \u2013 for instance, 30\u00b0 of longitude is the first point of Taurus, not part of Aries. The sign numbers, 0 through 11, are seen instead of the symbols in some astronomical works.\n\nAny association of calendar dates with these signs only makes sense when referring to [[Sun sign astrology]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Sign\n! scope=\"col\" | Symbol\n! scope=\"col\" | Number\n! scope=\"col\" | Ecliptic longitude<br>(''a'' \u2264 {{math|''&lambda;''}} < ''b'')\n! scope=\"col\" | Gloss\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]]\n|[[Image:Aries.svg|20px]]\n|0\n|0\u00b0 to 30\u00b0\n|The [[Sheep|Ram]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]]\n|[[Image:Taurus.svg|20px]]\n|1\n|30\u00b0 to 60\u00b0\n|The [[Bull]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]]\n|[[Image:Gemini.svg|20px]]\n|2\n|60\u00b0 to 90\u00b0\n|The [[Twin]]s\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]]\n|[[Image:Cancer.svg|20px]]\n|3\n|90\u00b0 to 120\u00b0\n|The [[Crab]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]]\n|[[Image:Leo.svg|20px]]\n|4\n|120\u00b0 to 150\u00b0\n|The [[Lion]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]]\n|[[Image:Virgo.svg|20px]]\n|5\n|150\u00b0 to 180\u00b0\n|The [[Maiden]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]]\n|[[Image:Libra.svg|24px]]\n|6\n|180\u00b0 to 210\u00b0\n|The [[Weighing scale|Scales]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]]\n|[[Image:Scorpio.svg|20px]]\n|7\n|210\u00b0 to 240\u00b0\n|The [[Scorpion]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]]\n|[[Image:Sagittarius.svg|20px]]\n|8\n|240\u00b0 to 270\u00b0\n|The [[Archery|Archer]] ([[Centaur]])\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]]\n|[[Image:Capricorn.svg|26px]]\n|9\n|270\u00b0 to 300\u00b0\n|The [[Goat]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]]\n|[[Image:Aquarius.svg|24px]]\n|10\n|300\u00b0 to 330\u00b0\n|The [[water carrier|Water-bearer]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]]\n|[[Image:Pisces.svg|20px]]\n|11\n|330\u00b0 to 360\u00b0\n|The [[Fish]]\n|}\n\n=== Polarity and the four elements ===\n{{main|Triplicity}}\n{{Further|Classical element}}\n<!-- \n     HIDDEN EDITOR NOTE:\n     DO NOT ADD ANY INFORMATION WITHOUT CITING A RELIABLE SOURCE\n     UNSOURCED ADDITIONS WILL BE REMOVED\n-->\n\n[[Image:Sign position example.svg|220px|thumb|right|A simple diagram displaying the planets' sign positions on May 16th, 2012.

He explained the nature of the universe as an interaction of two opposing principles called love and strife manipulating the four elements, and stated that these four elements were all equal, of the same age, that each rules its own province, and each possesses its own individual character. Different mixtures of these elements produced the different natures of things. Empedocles said that those who were born with near equal proportions of the four elements are more intelligent and have the most exact perceptions.<ref name=\"Charlie Higgins\">{{cite web|url=http://accessnewage.com/Articles/astro/HIGELEMS.HTM |title=Astrology and The Four Elements |author=Charlie Higgins |year=1997 |accessdate=2009-12-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103102752/http://accessnewage.com/articles/astro/HIGELEMS.HTM |archivedate=2010-01-03 |df= }}</ref>\n\nEach sign is associated with one of the [[classical element]]s (fire, air, earth, and water),<ref name=\"RobLeo\">Pelletier, Robert, and Leonard Cataldo (1984).

By contrast, they are held to find some signs to be weak or difficult to operate in because their natures are thought to be in conflict. These categories are Dignity, Detriment, Exaltation and Fall. \n\n* '''[[Essential dignity|Dignity]]''' and '''[[Detriment (astrology)|Detriment]]''': A [[Planets in astrology|planet]] is strengthened or '''dignified''' if it falls within the sign that it rules. In other words, it is said to exercise ''[[Domicile (astrology)|Rulership]]'' of the sign. For example, the Moon in Cancer is considered \"strong\" (well-dignified). If a planet is in the sign opposite which it rules (or is dignified in), it is said to be weakened or in '''Detriment''' (for example, the Moon in Capricorn).<ref name=\"glossary\">\"Glossary of Astrological Terms\". Logos, Asaa 1998\u20132004. 26 Nov 2007. {{cite web|url=http://logosastrology.dk/glossary.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122142135/http://logosastrology.dk/glossary.htm |archivedate=2008-01-22 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn traditional astrology, other levels of Dignity are recognised in addition to Rulership. These are known as Exaltation, [[Triplicity]], [[Terms or bounds]], and Face or [[Decans|Decan]], which together are known as describing a planet's ''[[Essential dignity]]'', the quality or ability of one's true nature.<ref name=\"glossary\" />\n\n* '''[[Exaltation (astrology)|Exaltation]]''' and '''[[Astrological fall|Fall]]''': In addition, a planet is also strengthened when it is in its sign of '''Exaltation'''. In traditional horary astrology, Exaltation denotes a level of dignity somewhat exaggerated compared to rulership. Exaltation was considered to give the planet (or what it signified in a horary chart) dignity, with the metaphor of an honoured guest \u2013 who is the centre of attention but the extent of their ability to act is limited. Examples of planets in their Exaltation are: Saturn (Libra), Sun (Aries), Venus (Pisces), Moon (Taurus), Mercury (Virgo, although some disagree to this classification), Mars (Capricorn), Jupiter (Cancer). A planet in the opposite sign of its Exaltation is said to be in its '''Fall''', and thus weakened, perhaps seemingly more so than Detriment.<ref name=\"glossary\" /> There is no agreement as to the signs in which the three extra-Saturnian planets may be considered to be exalted.<ref>Hone (1978), p. 144</ref>\n\nThe following table summarizes the positions described above:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

This is placement by [[astrological house|house]] in the chart under examination. Accidental dignity is the planet's \"ability to act.\" So we might have, for example, Moon in Cancer, dignified by rulership, is placed in the 12th house it would have little scope to express its good nature.<ref>{{cite web|title=Accidental Dignity|publisher= Astrological Dictionary 1998\u20132007|website= www.gotohoroscope.com|date= 26 November 2007|url= http://www.gotohoroscope.com/dictionary/astrological/5.html}}</ref> The 12th is a cadent house as are the 3rd, 6th and 9th and planets in these houses are considered weak or afflicted. On the other hand, Moon in the 1st, 4th, 7th or 10th would be more able to act as these are Angular houses. Planets in Succedent houses of the chart (2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th) are generally considered to be of medium ability to act.

The first decanate is said to be most emphatically of its own nature and is ruled by the sign ruler.<ref>Hone (1978), p.&nbsp;87</ref> The next decanate is sub-ruled by the planet ruling the next sign in the same triplicity.

The first four signs, Aries, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer, form the group of personal signs. The next four signs, Leo, Virgo, Libra and Scorpio form the group of interpersonal signs. The last four signs of the zodiac, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces, form the group of transpersonal signs.<ref name=\"spiritsingles.com\">\"An Introduction to Astrology.\" Spiritsingles.com 25 Nov.2007. {{cite web|url=http://www.spiritsingles.com/Astrology/aboutAstrology.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209083130/http://www.spiritsingles.com/Astrology/aboutAstrology.cfm |archivedate=2007-12-09 |df= }}</ref>\n\nDane Rudhyar presented the tropical zodiac primary factors,<ref>Rudhyar (1943)</ref> used in the curriculum of the RASA School of Astrology. The tropical zodiac is the zodiac of seasonal factors as opposed to the sidereal zodiac (constellation factors). The primary seasonal factors are based on the changing ratio of sunlight and darkness across the year. The first factor is whether the chosen time falls in the half of the year when daylight is increasing, or the half of the year when darkness is increasing. The second factor is whether the chosen time falls in the half of the year when there is more daylight than darkness, or the half when there is more darkness than daylight. The third factor is which of the four seasons the chosen time falls in, defined by the first two factors.

The order of the astrological signs is [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]], [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]], [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]], [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]], [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]], [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]], [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]], [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]], [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] and [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]]. Each sector was named for a constellation it was passing through in times of naming.\n\nThe concept of the [[zodiac]] originated in [[Babylonian astrology]], and was later influenced by [[Hellenistic astrology|Hellenistic]] culture.

Western astrology measures from [[Equinox]] and [[Solstice]] points (points relating to equal, longest and shortest days of the [[tropical year]]), while [[Jyoti\u1e63a]] or [[Vedic astrology]] measures along the equatorial plane ([[sidereal year]]). [[Precession]] results in Western astrology's zodiacal divisions not corresponding in the current era to the [[constellations]] that carry similar names,<ref>Bobrick (2005), pp. 10, 23.</ref> while [[Jyoti\u1e63a]] measurements still correspond with the background constellations.<ref>Johnsen (2004).</ref>\n\n== Western zodiac signs ==\n=== History and symbolism ===\n{{main|Zodiac|History of astrology}}\n{{further|Babylonian astrology|Hellenistic astrology|Ancient Egyptian astronomy}}\n[[Image:Sign cusps.png|250px|thumb|right|The twelve ecliptic signs.

In this illustration, the Sun is schematically positioned at the start of Aquarius ([[Image:Aquarius.svg|11px]]).]]\n[[Western astrology]] is a direct continuation of [[Hellenistic astrology]] as recorded by [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century. Helenistic astrology in turn was partly based on concepts from [[Babylonian astrology|Babylonian tradition]]. Specifically, the division of the ecliptic in twelve equal sectors is a Babylonian conceptual construction.<ref>Sachs (1948), p. 289.\nIsolated references to celestial \"signs\" in Sumerian sources are insufficient to speak of a Sumerian zodiac, see Rochberg (1998), p. ''ix''.</ref> \nBy the 4th century BC, Babylonian astronomy and its system of celestial omens had an influence on the culture of [[ancient Greece]], as did the astronomy of Egypt by late 2nd century BC. This resulted, unlike the Mesopotamian tradition, in a strong focus on the birth chart of the individual and in the creation of [[Horoscopic astrology]], employing the use of the [[Ascendant]] (the rising degree of the ecliptic, at the time of birth), and of the twelve [[House (astrology)|houses]]. Association of the astrological signs with [[Empedocles]]' four classical [[Classical element|elements]] was another important development in the characterization of the twelve signs.\n\nThe body of the Hellenistic astrological tradition as it stood by the 2nd century is described in Ptolemy's ''[[Tetrabiblos]]''.

By contrast, they are held to find some signs to be weak or difficult to operate in because their natures are thought to be in conflict. These categories are Dignity, Detriment, Exaltation and Fall. \n\n* '''[[Essential dignity|Dignity]]''' and '''[[Detriment (astrology)|Detriment]]''': A [[Planets in astrology|planet]] is strengthened or '''dignified''' if it falls within the sign that it rules. In other words, it is said to exercise ''[[Domicile (astrology)|Rulership]]'' of the sign. For example, the Moon in Cancer is considered \"strong\" (well-dignified). If a planet is in the sign opposite which it rules (or is dignified in), it is said to be weakened or in '''Detriment''' (for example, the Moon in Capricorn).<ref name=\"glossary\">\"Glossary of Astrological Terms\". Logos, Asaa 1998\u20132004. 26 Nov 2007. {{cite web|url=http://logosastrology.dk/glossary.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122142135/http://logosastrology.dk/glossary.htm |archivedate=2008-01-22 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn traditional astrology, other levels of Dignity are recognised in addition to Rulership. These are known as Exaltation, [[Triplicity]], [[Terms or bounds]], and Face or [[Decans|Decan]], which together are known as describing a planet's ''[[Essential dignity]]'', the quality or ability of one's true nature.<ref name=\"glossary\" />\n\n* '''[[Exaltation (astrology)|Exaltation]]''' and '''[[Astrological fall|Fall]]''': In addition, a planet is also strengthened when it is in its sign of '''Exaltation'''. In traditional horary astrology, Exaltation denotes a level of dignity somewhat exaggerated compared to rulership. Exaltation was considered to give the planet (or what it signified in a horary chart) dignity, with the metaphor of an honoured guest \u2013 who is the centre of attention but the extent of their ability to act is limited. Examples of planets in their Exaltation are: Saturn (Libra), Sun (Aries), Venus (Pisces), Moon (Taurus), Mercury (Virgo, although some disagree to this classification), Mars (Capricorn), Jupiter (Cancer). A planet in the opposite sign of its Exaltation is said to be in its '''Fall''', and thus weakened, perhaps seemingly more so than Detriment.<ref name=\"glossary\" /> There is no agreement as to the signs in which the three extra-Saturnian planets may be considered to be exalted.<ref>Hone (1978), p. 144</ref>\n\nThe following table summarizes the positions described above:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

This is placement by [[astrological house|house]] in the chart under examination. Accidental dignity is the planet's \"ability to act.\" So we might have, for example, Moon in Cancer, dignified by rulership, is placed in the 12th house it would have little scope to express its good nature.<ref>{{cite web|title=Accidental Dignity|publisher= Astrological Dictionary 1998\u20132007|website= www.gotohoroscope.com|date= 26 November 2007|url= http://www.gotohoroscope.com/dictionary/astrological/5.html}}</ref> The 12th is a cadent house as are the 3rd, 6th and 9th and planets in these houses are considered weak or afflicted. On the other hand, Moon in the 1st, 4th, 7th or 10th would be more able to act as these are Angular houses. Planets in Succedent houses of the chart (2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th) are generally considered to be of medium ability to act. Besides Accidental Dignity, there are a range of ''Accidental Debilities'', such as retrogradation, Under the Sun's Beams, Combust, and so forth.\n\n=== Additional classifications ===\n<!-- \n     HIDDEN EDITOR NOTE:\n     DO NOT ADD ANY INFORMATION WITHOUT CITING A RELIABLE SOURCE\n     UNSOURCED ADDITIONS WILL BE REMOVED\n-->\n{{Details|Decans}}\nEach sign can be divided into three 10\u00b0 sectors known as decans or decanates, though these have fallen into disuse. The first decanate is said to be most emphatically of its own nature and is ruled by the sign ruler.<ref>Hone (1978), p.&nbsp;87</ref> The next decanate is sub-ruled by the planet ruling the next sign in the same triplicity. The last decanate is sub-ruled by the next in order in the same triplicity.<ref>Hone (1978), p.&nbsp;88</ref>\n\nWhile the element and modality of a sign are together sufficient to define it, they can be grouped to indicate their symbolism. The first four signs, Aries, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer, form the group of personal signs. The next four signs, Leo, Virgo, Libra and Scorpio form the group of interpersonal signs.

DRESS syndrome is a SCARs type IV, subtype IVb reaction. This contrasts with SJS, SJS/TEN, and TEN which are type IV, subtype IVc reactions and AGEP which is a type IV subtype IVd reaction. DRESS syndrome therefore differs from the other SCARs disorders in that it involves the tissue-injuring action of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells and the cell- and tissue-injuring action of eosinophils as well as the release of the following cytokines: [[interleukin 5|Interleukins 5]] and [[interleukin 13|13]] which simulate the growth, longevity, and activation of eosinophils; [[Interleukin 4]] which promotes the differentiation of naive helper T cells into [[T helper cell#Th1/Th2 model|T<sub>h</sub>2 helper cells]] that then serve to activate eosinophils as well as other types of pro-inflammatory cells; [[Interferon gamma|IFN\u03b3]] which activates macrophages and induces the expression of Class II MHC molecules; and [[Tumor necrosis factor alpha|TNF\u03b1]] which promotes inflammation but also has cell-killing actions.<ref name=\"pmid26553194\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoetzenecker W, N\u00e4geli M, Mehra ET, Jensen AN, Saulite I, Schmid-Grendelmeier P, Guenova E, Cozzio A, French LE | title = Adverse cutaneous drug eruptions: current understanding | journal = Seminars in Immunopathology | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 75\u201386 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26553194 | doi = 10.1007/s00281-015-0540-2 | url = }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid27472323\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Feldmeyer L, Heidemeyer K, Yawalkar N | title = Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis: Pathogenesis, Genetic Background, Clinical Variants and Therapy | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 17 | issue = 8 | pages = 1214| year = 2016 | pmid = 27472323 | pmc = 5000612 | doi = 10.3390/ijms17081214 | url = }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid28476287\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Duong TA, Valeyrie-Allanore L, Wolkenstein P, Chosidow O | title = Severe cutaneous adverse reactions to drugs | journal = Lancet | volume = 390 | issue = 10106 | pages = 1996\u20132011 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28476287 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30378-6 | url = }}</ref>\n\nLike other SCARs-inducing drugs, DRESS syndrome-inducing drugs or their metabolites stimulate CD8<sup>+</sup> T or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to initiate autoimmune responses. Studies indicate that the mechanism by which a drug or its metabolites accomplishes this stimulation involves subverting the [[antigen presentation]] pathways of the [[innate immunity|innate immune]] system. The drug or metabolite covalently binds with a host protein to form a non-self, drug-related [[epitope]]. An [[antigen-presenting cell]] (APC) takes up these alter proteins; digests them into small peptides; places the peptides in a groove on the [[human leukocyte antigen]] (i.e. HLA) component of their [[major histocompatibility complex]] (i.e. MHC); and presents the MHC-associated peptides to the [[T-cell receptor]] on CD8<sup>+</sup> T or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Those peptides expressing a drug-related, non-self epitope on their [[HLA-A]], [[HLA-B]], [[HLA-C]], [[HLA-DM]], [[HLA-DO]], [[HLA-DP]], [[HLA-DQ]], or [[HLA-DR]] proteins may bind to a T-cell receptor to stimulate the receptor-bearing parent T cell to initiate attacks on self tissues. Alternatively, a drug or metabolite may stimulate these T cells by inserting into the groove on a HLA protein to serve as a non-self epitope or bind outside of this groove to alter a HLA protein so that it forms a non-self epitope. Importantly, however, non-self epitopes must bind to specific HLA [[serotypes]] in order to stimulate T cells. Since the human population expresses some 13,000 different HLA serotypes while an individual expresses only a fraction of them and since a DRESSs-inducing drug or metabolite interacts with only one or a few HLA serotypes,  a drug's ability to induce SCARs is limited to those individuals who express HLA serotypes targeted by the drug or its metabolite.<ref name=\"pmid28476287\"/><ref name=\"pmid29333670\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bachelez H | title = Pustular psoriasis and related pustular skin diseases | journal = The British Journal of Dermatology | volume = 178| issue = 3| pages = 614\u2013618| date = January 2018 | pmid = 29333670 | doi = 10.1111/bjd.16232 | url = }}</ref> Thus, only rare individuals are predisposed to develop  SCARs in response to a particular drug on the bases of their expression of HLA serotypes.<ref name=\"pmid27960170\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pichler WJ, Hausmann O | title = Classification of Drug Hypersensitivity into Allergic, p-i, and Pseudo-Allergic Forms | journal = International Archives of Allergy and Immunology | volume = 171 | issue = 3\u20134 | pages = 166\u2013179 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27960170 | doi = 10.1159/000453265 | url = }}</ref> Studies have identified several [[Severe cutaneous adverse reactions#HLA proteins|HLA serotypes]] associated with development of the DRESS syndrome in response to certain drugs, have developed tests to identify individuals who express some of these serotypes, and thereby have identified individuals who should avoid certain DRESS syndrome-inducing drugs.<ref name=\"pmid26553194\"/><ref name=\"pmid27362322\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang CW, Dao RL, Chung WH | title = Immunopathogenesis and risk factors for allopurinol severe cutaneous adverse reactions | journal = Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 339\u201345 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27362322 | doi = 10.1097/ACI.0000000000000286 | url = }}</ref>\n\n=== T-cell receptors ===\nA drug or its metabolite may also stimulate CD8<sup>+</sup> T or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to initiate autoimmune responses by directly binding to the T-cell receptors on these T cells. Again, this binding appears to develop only on certain T-cell receptors. Since the genes for these receptors are highly [[Genome editing|edited]], i.e. altered to encode proteins with different amino acid sequences, and since the human population may express more than 100 trillion different (i.e. different amino acid sequences) T-cell receptors while an individual express only a fraction of these, a drug's or its metabolite's ability to induce the DRESS syndrome by interacting with a T-cell receptor is limited to those individuals whose T cells express a T-cell receptor(s) that can interact with drug or its metabolite.<ref name=\"pmid28476287\"/><ref name=\"pmid28345177\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Garon SL, Pavlos RK, White KD, Brown NJ, Stone CA, Phillips EJ | title = Pharmacogenomics of off-target adverse drug reactions | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 83 | issue = 9 | pages = 1896\u20131911 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28345177 | pmc = 5555876 | doi = 10.1111/bcp.13294 | url = }}</ref> Thus, only rare individuals are predisposed to develop a SCARs disorder in response to a particular drug on the bases of their expression of specific cell receptor types.<ref name=\"pmid27960170\"/> While the evidence supporting these ideas is limited, one study identified the preferential presence of the [[V(D)J recombination|TCR-V-b]] and [[complementarity-determining region]] 3 in [[T-cell receptor#Structural characteristics of the TCR|T-cell receptors]] found on the T cells in the blisters of patients with allopurinol-induced DRESS syndrome. This finding is compatible with the notion that specific types of T-cell receptors are involved in the development of specific drug-induced SCARs.<ref name=\"pmid27362322\"/>\n\n===ADME===\nVariations in [[ADME]], i.e. an individual's efficiency in [[absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorpting]], [[distribution (pharmacology)|distributing]], [[metabolism|metabolizing]], and [[excreting]] a drug has been found to occur in cases of the DRESS syndrome. These variations influence the levels and duration of a drug or drug metabolite in tissues and thereby impact the drug's or drug metabolite's ability to evoke the DRESS syndrome.<ref name=\"pmid28256714\"/> For example, the ''[[CYP2C9]]'' gene codes for CYP2C9, a [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme which metabolizes various substances including phenytoin. The CYP2CP*3 variant of CYP29C has reduced catalytic activity; individuals expressing this variant show an increased incidence of developing the DRESS syndrome when taking phenytoin apparently due to increases in the drug's blood and tissue levels. In a second example of a genetically based ADME defect causing SCARs, Japanese individuals bearing slow acetylating variants of the [[N-acetyltransferase 2]] gene, (NAT2), viz., NAT2*6A and NAT2*7B, acetylate [[sulfasalazine]] more slowly than individuals homozygous for the wild type gene. Individuals expressing the NAT2*6A and NAT2*7 variants have an increased risk for developing DRESS syndrome-like reactions to this [[anti-inflammatory drug]].<ref name=\"pmid28138822\"/> None-genetic ADME factors are also associated with increased risks of developing the DRESS syndrome. Allopurinol is metabolized to [[oxipurinol]], a product with a far slower renal excretion rate than its parent compound. Renal impairment is associated with abnormally high blood levels of oxipurinol and an increased risk of developing the DRESS syndrome, particularly the more severe forms of this disorder. Dysfunction of the kidney and liver are also suggested to promote this disorder in response to other drugs due to the accumulation of SCARs-inducing drugs or metabolites in blood and tissues.<ref name=\"pmid28256714\"/><ref name=\"pmid27154258\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chung WH, Wang CW, Dao RL | title = Severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions | journal = The Journal of Dermatology | volume = 43 | issue = 7 | pages = 758\u201366 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27154258 | doi = 10.1111/1346-8138.13430 | url = }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid29188475\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lerch M, Mainetti C, Terziroli Beretta-Piccoli B, Harr T | title = Current Perspectives on Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis | journal = Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology | volume = 54| issue = 1| pages = 147\u2013176| year = 2017 | pmid = 29188475 | doi = 10.1007/s12016-017-8654-z | url = }}</ref> Currently, it is suspected that the expression of particular HLA proteins and T-cell receptors interact with ADME factors to promote SCARs particularly in their more serious forms.<ref name=\"pmid28256714\"/>\n\n===Viral reactivation===\nDuring the progression of the DRESS syndrome certain viruses that previously infected an individual and then became [[viral latency|latent]] are reactivated and proliferate. Viruses known to do so include certain members of the [[Herpesviridae]] family of Herpes viruses viz., [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus]], [[human herpesvirus 6]], [[human herpesvirus 7]], and [[cytomegalovirus]]. Individuals suffering the DRESS syndrome may exhibit sequential reactivation of these four viruses, typically in the order just given. Reactivation of these viruses is associated with a flare-up in symptoms, a prolonged course, and increased disease severity which includes significant organ involvement and the development of certain [[autoimmune disease]]s viz., [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[autoimmune thyroiditis]], and [[type 1 diabetes mellitus]]. While these viral reactivations, particularly of human herpes virus 6, have been suggested to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of the DRESS syndrome, studies to date have not clearly determined if they are a cause or merely a consequence of T cell-mediated tissue injury.<ref name=\"pmid28256714\"/><ref name=\"pmid28598363\"/>\n\n==Preventative==\nCurrently, screening individuals for the expression of certain HLA [[alleles]] before initiating treatment of patients with DRESS-inducing drugs is recommended.

It has also been suggested that all individuals found to express this HLA serotype avoid treatment with abacovir.\n\nCurrent trials are underway to evaluate the ability of genetic screening to prevent the DRESS syndrome for dapsone and HLA-B*13:01 in China and Indonesia.

In the past, the mainstay treatment of severe cases of DRESS syndrome was the use, often at high-dosage, of systemic [[glucocorticoid]]s, relying on the [[anti-inflammatory]] actions of these drugs to suppress the eosinophil- and T cell-induced tissue damage caused by the disorder. However, there have been no [[randomized control trial]]s reporting on the systemic use of these drugs. Rather, there are suggestions that treatment with systemic glucocorticoids is associated with a higher incidence of relapse compared to topical glucocorticoid treatment and may be associated with a higher rate of [[opportunistic infection]]. Accordingly, less severe cases of this disorder may be better treated conservatively with general support and, where needed, topical glucocorticoids. Severer cases, particularly those involving significant internal organ involvement, may require systemic corticosteroids and efforts to support heart, kidney, lung, or other organ dysfunctions.<ref name=\"pmid28598363\"/><ref name=\"pmid28476287\"/>\n\n==Terminology==\nDRESS syndrome is one of several terms that have been used to describe a severe idiosyncratic reaction to a drug that is characterized by a long latency of onset after exposure to the offending medication, a rash, involvement of internal organs, hematologic abnormalities, and systemic illness.

Renal involvement is more prone to occur in older individuals and in those with prior kidney or cardiovascular disease; it may take the form of severe [[interstitial nephritis]], [[acute tubular necrosis]], or [[vasculitis]] and may lead to [[kidney failure]] and, uncommonly, be lethal. Lung involvement takes the form of [[interstitial pneumonitis]], [[pleuritis]], or the [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]]; minocycline and [[abacavir]] are the main culprit drugs causing severe lung involvement.

DRESS syndrome is a SCARs type IV, subtype IVb reaction. This contrasts with SJS, SJS/TEN, and TEN which are type IV, subtype IVc reactions and AGEP which is a type IV subtype IVd reaction. DRESS syndrome therefore differs from the other SCARs disorders in that it involves the tissue-injuring action of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells and the cell- and tissue-injuring action of eosinophils as well as the release of the following cytokines: [[interleukin 5|Interleukins 5]] and [[interleukin 13|13]] which simulate the growth, longevity, and activation of eosinophils; [[Interleukin 4]] which promotes the differentiation of naive helper T cells into [[T helper cell#Th1/Th2 model|T<sub>h</sub>2 helper cells]] that then serve to activate eosinophils as well as other types of pro-inflammatory cells; [[Interferon gamma|IFN\u03b3]] which activates macrophages and induces the expression of Class II MHC molecules; and [[Tumor necrosis factor alpha|TNF\u03b1]] which promotes inflammation but also has cell-killing actions.<ref name=\"pmid26553194\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoetzenecker W, N\u00e4geli M, Mehra ET, Jensen AN, Saulite I, Schmid-Grendelmeier P, Guenova E, Cozzio A, French LE | title = Adverse cutaneous drug eruptions: current understanding | journal = Seminars in Immunopathology | volume = 38 | issue = 1 | pages = 75\u201386 | year = 2016 | pmid = 26553194 | doi = 10.1007/s00281-015-0540-2 | url = }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid27472323\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Feldmeyer L, Heidemeyer K, Yawalkar N | title = Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis: Pathogenesis, Genetic Background, Clinical Variants and Therapy | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 17 | issue = 8 | pages = 1214| year = 2016 | pmid = 27472323 | pmc = 5000612 | doi = 10.3390/ijms17081214 | url = }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid28476287\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Duong TA, Valeyrie-Allanore L, Wolkenstein P, Chosidow O | title = Severe cutaneous adverse reactions to drugs | journal = Lancet | volume = 390 | issue = 10106 | pages = 1996\u20132011 | year = 2017 | pmid = 28476287 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30378-6 | url = }}</ref>\n\nLike other SCARs-inducing drugs, DRESS syndrome-inducing drugs or their metabolites stimulate CD8<sup>+</sup> T or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to initiate autoimmune responses.

The drug or metabolite covalently binds with a host protein to form a non-self, drug-related [[epitope]]. An [[antigen-presenting cell]] (APC) takes up these alter proteins; digests them into small peptides; places the peptides in a groove on the [[human leukocyte antigen]] (i.e. HLA) component of their [[major histocompatibility complex]] (i.e. MHC); and presents the MHC-associated peptides to the [[T-cell receptor]] on CD8<sup>+</sup> T or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Those peptides expressing a drug-related, non-self epitope on their [[HLA-A]], [[HLA-B]], [[HLA-C]], [[HLA-DM]], [[HLA-DO]], [[HLA-DP]], [[HLA-DQ]], or [[HLA-DR]] proteins may bind to a T-cell receptor to stimulate the receptor-bearing parent T cell to initiate attacks on self tissues. Alternatively, a drug or metabolite may stimulate these T cells by inserting into the groove on a HLA protein to serve as a non-self epitope or bind outside of this groove to alter a HLA protein so that it forms a non-self epitope. Importantly, however, non-self epitopes must bind to specific HLA [[serotypes]] in order to stimulate T cells. Since the human population expresses some 13,000 different HLA serotypes while an individual expresses only a fraction of them and since a DRESSs-inducing drug or metabolite interacts with only one or a few HLA serotypes,  a drug's ability to induce SCARs is limited to those individuals who express HLA serotypes targeted by the drug or its metabolite.<ref name=\"pmid28476287\"/><ref name=\"pmid29333670\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bachelez H | title = Pustular psoriasis and related pustular skin diseases | journal = The British Journal of Dermatology | volume = 178| issue = 3| pages = 614\u2013618| date = January 2018 | pmid = 29333670 | doi = 10.1111/bjd.16232 | url = }}</ref> Thus, only rare individuals are predisposed to develop  SCARs in response to a particular drug on the bases of their expression of HLA serotypes.<ref name=\"pmid27960170\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pichler WJ, Hausmann O | title = Classification of Drug Hypersensitivity into Allergic, p-i, and Pseudo-Allergic Forms | journal = International Archives of Allergy and Immunology | volume = 171 | issue = 3\u20134 | pages = 166\u2013179 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27960170 | doi = 10.1159/000453265 | url = }}</ref> Studies have identified several [[Severe cutaneous adverse reactions#HLA proteins|HLA serotypes]] associated with development of the DRESS syndrome in response to certain drugs, have developed tests to identify individuals who express some of these serotypes, and thereby have identified individuals who should avoid certain DRESS syndrome-inducing drugs.<ref name=\"pmid26553194\"/><ref name=\"pmid27362322\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang CW, Dao RL, Chung WH | title = Immunopathogenesis and risk factors for allopurinol severe cutaneous adverse reactions | journal = Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 339\u201345 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27362322 | doi = 10.1097/ACI.0000000000000286 | url = }}</ref>\n\n=== T-cell receptors ===\nA drug or its metabolite may also stimulate CD8<sup>+</sup> T or CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to initiate autoimmune responses by directly binding to the T-cell receptors on these T cells. Again, this binding appears to develop only on certain T-cell receptors. Since the genes for these receptors are highly [[Genome editing|edited]], i.e. altered to encode proteins with different amino acid sequences, and since the human population may express more than 100 trillion different (i.e. different amino acid sequences) T-cell receptors while an individual express only a fraction of these, a drug's or its metabolite's ability to induce the DRESS syndrome by interacting with a T-cell receptor is limited to those individuals whose T cells express a T-cell receptor(s) that can interact with drug or its metabolite.<ref name=\"pmid28476287\"/><ref name=\"pmid28345177\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Garon SL, Pavlos RK, White KD, Brown NJ, Stone CA, Phillips EJ | title = Pharmacogenomics of off-target adverse drug reactions | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 83 | issue = 9 | pages = 1896\u20131911 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28345177 | pmc = 5555876 | doi = 10.1111/bcp.13294 | url = }}</ref> Thus, only rare individuals are predisposed to develop a SCARs disorder in response to a particular drug on the bases of their expression of specific cell receptor types.<ref name=\"pmid27960170\"/> While the evidence supporting these ideas is limited, one study identified the preferential presence of the [[V(D)J recombination|TCR-V-b]] and [[complementarity-determining region]] 3 in [[T-cell receptor#Structural characteristics of the TCR|T-cell receptors]] found on the T cells in the blisters of patients with allopurinol-induced DRESS syndrome. This finding is compatible with the notion that specific types of T-cell receptors are involved in the development of specific drug-induced SCARs.<ref name=\"pmid27362322\"/>\n\n===ADME===\nVariations in [[ADME]], i.e. an individual's efficiency in [[absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorpting]], [[distribution (pharmacology)|distributing]], [[metabolism|metabolizing]], and [[excreting]] a drug has been found to occur in cases of the DRESS syndrome. These variations influence the levels and duration of a drug or drug metabolite in tissues and thereby impact the drug's or drug metabolite's ability to evoke the DRESS syndrome.<ref name=\"pmid28256714\"/> For example, the ''[[CYP2C9]]'' gene codes for CYP2C9, a [[cytochrome P450]] enzyme which metabolizes various substances including phenytoin. The CYP2CP*3 variant of CYP29C has reduced catalytic activity; individuals expressing this variant show an increased incidence of developing the DRESS syndrome when taking phenytoin apparently due to increases in the drug's blood and tissue levels. In a second example of a genetically based ADME defect causing SCARs, Japanese individuals bearing slow acetylating variants of the [[N-acetyltransferase 2]] gene, (NAT2), viz., NAT2*6A and NAT2*7B, acetylate [[sulfasalazine]] more slowly than individuals homozygous for the wild type gene. Individuals expressing the NAT2*6A and NAT2*7 variants have an increased risk for developing DRESS syndrome-like reactions to this [[anti-inflammatory drug]].<ref name=\"pmid28138822\"/> None-genetic ADME factors are also associated with increased risks of developing the DRESS syndrome. Allopurinol is metabolized to [[oxipurinol]], a product with a far slower renal excretion rate than its parent compound. Renal impairment is associated with abnormally high blood levels of oxipurinol and an increased risk of developing the DRESS syndrome, particularly the more severe forms of this disorder. Dysfunction of the kidney and liver are also suggested to promote this disorder in response to other drugs due to the accumulation of SCARs-inducing drugs or metabolites in blood and tissues.<ref name=\"pmid28256714\"/><ref name=\"pmid27154258\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chung WH, Wang CW, Dao RL | title = Severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions | journal = The Journal of Dermatology | volume = 43 | issue = 7 | pages = 758\u201366 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27154258 | doi = 10.1111/1346-8138.13430 | url = }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid29188475\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lerch M, Mainetti C, Terziroli Beretta-Piccoli B, Harr T | title = Current Perspectives on Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis | journal = Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology | volume = 54| issue = 1| pages = 147\u2013176| year = 2017 | pmid = 29188475 | doi = 10.1007/s12016-017-8654-z | url = }}</ref> Currently, it is suspected that the expression of particular HLA proteins and T-cell receptors interact with ADME factors to promote SCARs particularly in their more serious forms.<ref name=\"pmid28256714\"/>\n\n===Viral reactivation===\nDuring the progression of the DRESS syndrome certain viruses that previously infected an individual and then became [[viral latency|latent]] are reactivated and proliferate. Viruses known to do so include certain members of the [[Herpesviridae]] family of Herpes viruses viz., [[Epstein\u2013Barr virus]], [[human herpesvirus 6]], [[human herpesvirus 7]], and [[cytomegalovirus]]. Individuals suffering the DRESS syndrome may exhibit sequential reactivation of these four viruses, typically in the order just given. Reactivation of these viruses is associated with a flare-up in symptoms, a prolonged course, and increased disease severity which includes significant organ involvement and the development of certain [[autoimmune disease]]s viz., [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[autoimmune thyroiditis]], and [[type 1 diabetes mellitus]]. While these viral reactivations, particularly of human herpes virus 6, have been suggested to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of the DRESS syndrome, studies to date have not clearly determined if they are a cause or merely a consequence of T cell-mediated tissue injury.<ref name=\"pmid28256714\"/><ref name=\"pmid28598363\"/>\n\n==Preventative==\nCurrently, screening individuals for the expression of certain HLA [[alleles]] before initiating treatment of patients with DRESS-inducing drugs is recommended. These recommendations typically apply only to specific populations that have a significant chance of expressing the indicated allele since screening of populations with extremely low incidences of expressing an allele is considered cost-ineffective.<ref name=\"pmid28346659\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chong HY, Mohamed Z, Tan LL, Wu DB, Shabaruddin FH, Dahlui M, Apalasamy YD, Snyder SR, Williams MS, Hao J, Cavallari LH, Chaiyakunapruk N | title = Is universal HLA-B*15:02 screening a cost-effective option in an ethnically diverse population?

This screening is widely implemented. It has also been suggested that all individuals found to express this HLA serotype avoid treatment with abacovir.\n\nCurrent trials are underway to evaluate the ability of genetic screening to prevent the DRESS syndrome for dapsone and HLA-B*13:01 in China and Indonesia. Similar trials are underway in Taiwan to prevent phenytoin-induced DRESS syndrome in individuals expressing the CYP2C9*3 allele of CYP2C9 as well as a series of HLA alleles.<ref name=\"pmid27854302\"/>\n\n==Treatment==\nImmediate discontinuance of the offending drug or drug(s) is the first and critical step in treating any SCARs disorder. In the past, the mainstay treatment of severe cases of DRESS syndrome was the use, often at high-dosage, of systemic [[glucocorticoid]]s, relying on the [[anti-inflammatory]] actions of these drugs to suppress the eosinophil- and T cell-induced tissue damage caused by the disorder. However, there have been no [[randomized control trial]]s reporting on the systemic use of these drugs. Rather, there are suggestions that treatment with systemic glucocorticoids is associated with a higher incidence of relapse compared to topical glucocorticoid treatment and may be associated with a higher rate of [[opportunistic infection]]. Accordingly, less severe cases of this disorder may be better treated conservatively with general support and, where needed, topical glucocorticoids. Severer cases, particularly those involving significant internal organ involvement, may require systemic corticosteroids and efforts to support heart, kidney, lung, or other organ dysfunctions.<ref name=\"pmid28598363\"/><ref name=\"pmid28476287\"/>\n\n==Terminology==\nDRESS syndrome is one of several terms that have been used to describe a severe idiosyncratic reaction to a drug that is characterized by a long latency of onset after exposure to the offending medication, a rash, involvement of internal organs, hematologic abnormalities, and systemic illness. Other synonymous names and acronyms include drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS or DHiS), anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome, drug-induced delayed multiorgan hypersensitivity syndrome, drug-induced pseudolymphoma, [[anticonvulsant hypersensitivity syndrome]], [[allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome]], [[Dapsone#dapsone syndrome|dapsone syndrome]], and [[Dapsone#Adverse effects|dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome]].<ref name=\"Walsh\" /><ref name=\"pmid28598363\"/><ref name=\"Bocquet\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Severe cutaneous adverse reactions|SCARs]]\n*[[Adverse drug reaction]]\n*[[Drug allergy]]\n*[[Drug intolerance]]\n*[[Drug tolerance]]\n*[[List of skin conditions]]\n*[[Eosinophilic myocarditis#The DRESS syndrome|Eosinophilic myocarditis associated with the DRESS syndrome]]\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [http://www.emedicine.com/derm/topic104.htm eMedicine Article]\n\n{{Drug reactions}}\n\n[[Category:Syndromes affecting blood]]\n[[Category:Drug eruptions]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGenetics:Journal cites:, templated 1 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_reaction_with_eosinophilia_and_systemic_symptoms"}

Most of the buildings are 100 years or older, with some still carrying the insignia of the British Crown - the Lion and the Unicorn. The hides to the tanneries were and is still supplied by the slaughter house located at the beginning of Tannery Road. Gradually around 200 tannery units which have come up around the original tanneries set up in British India. In times gone by, people from the Tannery Road area were not allowed into the cantonment, and residents of the cantonment avoided Tannery Road.\n\nAround 5000 [[Arunthathiyar]], [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[Dalit]] labourers were brought by the British from [[Madras Presidency]] districts of [[Vellore]], [[Madurai]] and [[Tirunelveli]]. The Tanneries are owned by Muslims and the labour consists of Tamil Dalits, from the original migrants. The raw skin is initially cleaned using water, then rubbed with salt and folded into a square like a saree, and this preserves the skin for another 2 weeks. The hides are then transported to [[Vaniyambadi]] and [[Ambur]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. In 2006, many of the tanneries and curing units were shut down, and now there are only about 15 left today. Most of the labourers have moved to other professions, and their children also getting good education. Tanners have also migrated in large numbers to Ambur and Vaniyambadi, as a result of the declining tannery industry in Bangalore. The government proposed the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill, which would have stopped the slaughter of cow/oxen, and would have struck the death knell to the tanneries.

Most of the buildings are 100 years or older, with some still carrying the insignia of the British Crown - the Lion and the Unicorn. The hides to the tanneries were and is still supplied by the slaughter house located at the beginning of Tannery Road. Gradually around 200 tannery units which have come up around the original tanneries set up in [[British India]]. In times gone by, people from the Tannery Road area were not allowed into the cantonment, and residents of the cantonment avoided Tannery Road.\n\nAround 5000 [[Arunthathiyar]], [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[Dalit]] labourers were brought by the British from [[Madras Presidency]] districts of [[Vellore]], [[Madurai]] and [[Tirunelveli]]. The Tanneries are owned by Muslims and the labour consists of Tamil Dalits, from the original migrants. The raw skin is initially cleaned using water, then rubbed with salt and folded into a square like a saree, and this preserves the skin for another 2 weeks. The hides are then transported to [[Vaniyambadi]] and [[Ambur]], [[Tamil Nadu]]. In 2006, many of the tanneries and curing units were shut down, and now there are only about 15 left today. Most of the labourers have moved to other professions, and their children also getting good education. Tanners have also migrated in large numbers to Ambur and Vaniyambadi, as a result of the declining tannery industry in Bangalore. The government proposed the Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill, which would have stopped the slaughter of cow/oxen, and would have struck the death knell to the tanneries. The Bill was however withdrawn by the strong Congress Government.<ref name=Simhadri /><ref name=Mondal /><ref name=Gandhi>{{cite news|last1=Gandhi|first1=Divya|title=Leather industry set to take a hiding|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/leather-industry-set-to-take-a-hiding/article571729.ece|accessdate=1 January 2015|issue=Bangalore|publisher=The Hindu|date=15 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=Firdaus>{{cite web|title=Tannery Road: A Tainey departure from MM Road|url=http://famishedfirdaus.blogspot.com.au/2014/07/tannery-road-tainey-departure-from-mm.html|website=Famished Firdaus|accessdate=1 January 2015}}</ref><ref name=News9>{{cite web|title=Dirty Truth of Tannery Road|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF7oNl4jaEg|website=Youtube|publisher=News9|accessdate=1 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Slaughterhouse==\nThe slaughterhouse (called as Doddi by the locals in Tamil/Urdu)[https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Tannery+Rd,+Bengaluru,+Karnataka,+India/@13.0029973,77.6123343,18z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3bae16f970ef7879:0x688a71f722d4784a] is located at the beginning of Tannery Road, at the intersection of Pottery Road.

I was never one of those girls who would do like 30 shows a season or whatever the fuck those girls do. More power to \u2019em. But I had a million jobs, not only catwalks but everything else. The whole combination was very overwhelming and I started to freak out a little bit and needed to take a step back.</blockquote>\n\nMany prominent fashion models including [[Daria Strokous]], responded in anger and felt personally insulted.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/08/kendall-jenner-just-enraged-a-whole-bunch-of-models|title=Kendall Jenner Just Enraged a Whole Bunch of Models|work=Vanity Fair|last=Harwood|first=Erika}}</ref> In response to the controversy, she apologized and claimed the magazine had \"misrepresented\" her and she meant the statement as a compliment.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wmagazine.com/story/kendall-jenner-model-apology-slay-always|title=Kendall Jenner Apologizes for Critiquing Fellow Models for How Much They Work|work=W|last=Ivie|first=Devon}}</ref>\n\n=== Fyre Festival ===\nOn January 5, 2017, Kendall Jenner was paid $250 thousand for an Instagram post announcing that some members of the G.O.O.D Music family would be performing at [[Fyre Festival]], and that her followers could buy tickets using a discount code she provided.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bluestone |first1=Gabrielle |title=Fyre Festival organizers blew all their money months early on models, planes, and yachts |url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/7xwabq/fyre-fest-organizers-blew-all-their-money-months-early-on-models-planes-and-yachts |accessdate= August 15, 2019 |publisher=Vice Media |date=May 3, 2017}}</ref> The post, which has since been deleted, was not tagged as an #ad despite Jenner's compensation and the [[Federal Trade Commission]] law which requires paid posts on social media to be disclosed transparently.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Paige |first1=Rachel |title=Kendall Jenner's Fyre Fest Instagram May Have Actually Changed Influencer Culture |url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/01/221813/kendall-jenner-fyre-festival-lawsuit-instagram-ads |website=Refinery29.com |publisher=Refinery29 |accessdate=15 August 2019}}</ref> Fyre Festival was a fraudulent \"luxury music festival\" founded by [[Billy McFarland (fraudster)|Billy McFarland]], CEO of Fyre Media Inc, and rapper [[Ja Rule]].

First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine. The use of such a virus, be it [[inactivated vaccine|inactive]] or dead, aims to elicit a prompt [[immune response]] of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19. A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor. A third strategy is that of the nucleic acid vaccines ([[DNA vaccination|DNA]] or [[RNA vaccines]], a novel technique for creating a vaccination).

The methods for sampling, preservation or analysis differ between those different types of sample.\n\n'''Tissue samples'''\n\nTo barcode a tissue sample from the target specimen, a small piece of skin, a scale, a leg or antenna is likely to be sufficient (depending on the size of the specimen). To avoid contamination, it is necessary to sterilize used tools between samples. It is recommended to collect two samples from one specimen, one to archive, and one for the barcoding process. Sample preservation is crucial to overcome the issue of DNA degradation.\n\n'''Bulk samples'''\n\nA bulk sample is a type of environmental sample containing several organisms from the [[taxonomic group]] under study. The difference between bulk samples (in the sense used here) and other environmental samples is that the bulk sample usually provides a large quantity of good-quality DNA.<ref name=\":15\" /> Examples of bulk samples include aquatic macroinvertebrate sample collected by kick-net, or insect samples collected with a Malaise trap. Filtered or size-fractionated water samples containing whole organisms like unicellular eukaryotes are also sometimes defined as bulk samples. Such samples can be collected by the same techniques as used to obtain traditional samples for morphology-based identification.\n\n'''eDNA samples'''\n\nThe [[environmental DNA]] (eDNA) method is a non-invasive approach to detect and identify species from cellular debris or extracellular DNA present in environmental samples (e.g. water or soil) through barcoding or metabarcoding. The approach is based on the fact that every living organism leave DNA in the environment, and this environmental DNA can be detected even for organisms that are at very low abundance. Thus, for field sampling, the most crucial part is to use DNA-free material and tools on each sampling site or sample to avoid contamination, if the DNA of the target organism(s) is likely to be present in low quantities. On the other hand, an eDNA sample always includes the DNA of whole-cell, living microorganisms, which are often present in large quantities. Therefore, microorganism samples taken in the natural environment also are called eDNA samples, but contamination is less problematic in this context due to the large quantity of target organisms. The eDNA method is applied on most sample types, like water, sediment, soil, animal feces, stomach content or blood from e.g. leeches.<ref>{{Citation|last=Jelger Herder|title=Environmental DNA - a review of the possible applications for the detection of (invasive) species.|date=2014|publisher=RAVON|doi=10.13140/rg.2.1.4002.1208|last2=A.

Several different [[DNA extraction]] methods exist, and factors like cost, time, sample type and yield affect the selection of the optimal method.\n\nWhen DNA from organismal or eDNA samples is amplified using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), the reaction can be affected negatively by inhibitor molecules contained in the sample.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Schrader|first=C.|last2=Schielke|first2=A.|last3=Ellerbroek|first3=L.|last4=Johne|first4=R.|date=2012|title=PCR inhibitors \u2013 occurrence, properties and removal|journal=Journal of Applied Microbiology|volume=113|issue=5|pages=1014\u20131026|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2672.2012.05384.x|pmid=22747964|issn=1365-2672}}</ref> Removal of these inhibitors is crucial to ensure that high quality DNA is available for subsequent analyzing.\n\n[[Gene amplification|Amplification]] of the extracted DNA is a required step in DNA barcoding.

These databases contain the DNA barcodes assigned to previously identified taxa. Most reference libraries do not cover all species within an organism group, and new entries are continually created. In the case of macro- and many microorganisms (such as algae), these reference libraries require detailed documentation (sampling location and date, person who collected it, image, etc.) and authoritative taxonomic identification of the voucher specimen, as well as submission of sequences in a particular format. The process also requires the storage of voucher specimens in museum collections and other collaborating institutions. Both taxonomically comprehensive coverage and content quality are important for identification accuracy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Weigand|first=Hannah|last2=Beermann|first2=Arne J.|last3=\u010ciampor|first3=Fedor|last4=Costa|first4=Filipe O.|last5=Csabai|first5=Zolt\u00e1n|last6=Duarte|first6=Sofia|last7=Geiger|first7=Matthias F.|last8=Grabowski|first8=Micha\u0142|last9=Rimet|first9=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|date=2019-03-14|title=DNA barcode reference libraries for the monitoring of aquatic biota in Europe: Gap-analysis and recommendations for future work|journal=bioRxiv|volume=678|pages=499|doi=10.1101/576553|bibcode=2019ScTEn.678..499W|hdl=11250/2608962}}</ref> Several reference databases exist depending on the organism group and the genetic marker used.

The database also involves additional, trait information of species, like morphological characteristics (biovolume, size dimensions, etc.), life-forms (mobility, colony-type, etc.) or ecological features (pollution sensitivity, etc.).\n\n=== Bioinformatic analysis ===\nIn order to obtain well structured, clean and interpretable data, raw sequencing data must be processed using bioinformatic analysis. The [[FASTQ format|FASTQ]] file with the sequencing data contains two types of information: the sequences detected in the sample ([[FASTA format|FASTA]] file) and a quality file with quality scores ([[Phred quality score|PHRED]] scores) associated with each nucleotide of each DNA sequence. The PHRED scores indicate the probability with which the associated nucleotide has been correctly scored.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+PHRED quality score and the associated certainty level\n|10\n|90%\n|-\n|20\n|99%\n|-\n|30\n|99.9%\n|-\n|40\n|99.99%\n|-\n|50\n|99.999%\n|}\nIn general, the PHRED score decreases towards the end of each DNA sequence. Thus some bioinformatics pipelines simply cut the end of the sequences at a defined threshold.\n\nSome sequencing technologies, like MiSeq, use paired-end sequencing during which sequencing is performed from both directions producing better quality. The overlapping sequences are then aligned into contigs and merged. Usually, several samples are pooled in one run, and each sample is characterized by a short DNA fragment, the tag. In a demultiplexing step, sequences are sorted using these tags to reassemble the separate samples. Before further analysis, tags and other adapters are removed from the barcoding sequence DNA fragment. During trimming, the bad quality sequences (low PHRED scores), or sequences that are much shorter or longer than the targeted DNA barcode, are removed. The following dereplication step is the process where all of the quality-filtered sequences are collapsed into a set of unique reads (individual sequence units ISUs) with the information of their abundance in the samples. After that, chimeras (i.e. compound sequences formed from pieces of mixed origin) are detected and removed. Finally, the sequences are clustered into OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units), using one of many clustering strategies.

However, DNA barcoding could improve traditional methods for the following reasons; DNA barcoding (i) can increase taxonomic resolution and harmonize the identification of taxa which are difficult to identify or lack experts, (ii) can more accurately/precisely relate environmental factors to specific taxa (iii) can increase comparability among regions, (iv) allows for the inclusion of early life stages and fragmented specimens, (v) allows delimitation of [[Species complex|cryptic]]/rare species (vi) allows for development of new indices e.g. rare/cryptic species which may be sensitive/tolerant to [[stressor]]s, (vii) increases the number of samples which can be processed and reduces processing time resulting in increased knowledge of species ecology, (viii) is a non-invasive way of monitoring when using [[Environmental DNA|eDNA]] methods.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Pawlowski|first=Jan|last2=Kelly-Quinn|first2=Mary|last3=Altermatt|first3=Florian|last4=Apoth\u00e9loz-Perret-Gentil|first4=Laure|last5=Beja|first5=Pedro|last6=Boggero|first6=Angela|last7=Borja|first7=Angel|last8=Bouchez|first8=Agn\u00e8s|last9=Cordier|first9=Tristan|date=2018|title=The future of biotic indices in the ecogenomic era: Integrating (e)DNA metabarcoding in biological assessment of aquatic ecosystems|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=637-638|pages=1295\u20131310|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.05.002|pmid=29801222|bibcode=2018ScTEn.637.1295P}}</ref>\n\n==== Time and cost ====\nDNA barcoding is faster than traditional morphological methods all the way from training through to taxonomic assignment. It takes less time to gain expertise in DNA methods than becoming an expert in taxonomy. In addition, the DNA barcoding workflow (i.e. from sample to result) is generally quicker than traditional morphological workflow and allows the processing of more samples.\n\n==== Taxonomic resolution ====\nDNA barcoding allows the resolution of taxa from higher (e.g. family) to lower (e.g. species) taxonomic levels, that are otherwise too difficult to identify using traditional morphological methods, like e.g. identification via microscopy. For example, [[Chironomidae]] (the non-biting midge) are widely distributed in both terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Their richness and abundance make them important for ecological processes and networks, and they are one of many invertebrate groups used in biomonitoring. Invertebrate samples can contain as many as 100 species of chironomids which often make up as much as 50% of a sample. Despite this, they are usually not identified below the family level because of the taxonomic expertise and time required.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Chironomidae|date=1995|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789401043083|editor-last=Armitage|editor-first=Patrick D.|location=Dordrecht|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-0715-0|editor-last2=Cranston|editor-first2=Peter S.|editor-last3=Pinder|editor-first3=L. C. V.}}</ref> This may result in different chironomid species with different ecological preferences grouped together, resulting in inaccurate assessment of water quality.\n\nDNA barcoding provides the opportunity to resolve taxa, and directly relate stressor effects to specific taxa such as individual chironomid species. For example, Beermann et al. (2018) DNA barcoded Chironomidae to investigate their response to multiple stressors; reduced flow, increased fine-sediment and increased salinity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beermann|first=Arne J.|last2=Zizka|first2=Vera M.

For example, detecting target DNA in aquatic systems depends on the concentration of DNA molecules at a site, which in turn can be affected by many factors. The presence of DNA molecules also depends on dispersion at a site, e.g. direction or strength of currents. It is not really known how DNA moves around in streams and lakes, which makes sampling difficult. Another factor might be the behavior of the target species, e.g. fish can have seasonal changes of movements, crayfish or mussels will release DNA in larger amounts just at certain times of their life (moulting, spawning). For DNA in soil, even less is known about distribution, quantity or quality.\n\n==== Incomplete barcode reference libraries ====\nThe major limitation of the barcoding method is that it relies on barcode reference libraries for the taxonomic identification of the sequences. The taxonomic identification is accurate only if a reliable reference is available. However, most databases are still incomplete, especially for smaller organisms e.g. fungi, phytoplankton, nematoda etc. In addition, current databases contain misidentifications, spelling mistakes and other errors. There is massive curation and completion effort around the databases for all organisms necessary, involving large barcoding projects (for example the iBOL project for the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) reference database).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ibol.org/|title=The International Barcode of Life Consortium|website=International Barcode of Life|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boldsystems.org/|title=Bold Systems v4|website=www.boldsystems.org|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref> However, completion and curation are difficult and time-consuming. Without vouchered specimens, there can be no certainty about whether the sequence used as a reference is correct. DNA sequence databases like GenBank contain many sequences that are not tied to [[Zoological specimen#Voucher specimens|vouchered specimens]] (for example, herbarium specimens, cultured cell lines, or sometimes images). This is problematic in the face of taxonomic issues such as whether several species should be split or combined, or whether past identifications were sound. Therefore, best practice for DNA barcoding is to sequence vouchered specimens.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schander|first=Christoffer|last2=Willassen|first2=Endre|date=2005|title=What can biological barcoding do for marine biology?|journal=Marine Biology Research|volume=1|issue=1|pages=79\u201383|doi=10.1080/17451000510018962|issn=1745-1000}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=S.

The methods for sampling, preservation or analysis differ between those different types of sample.\n\n'''Tissue samples'''\n\nTo barcode a tissue sample from the target specimen, a small piece of skin, a scale, a leg or antenna is likely to be sufficient (depending on the size of the specimen). To avoid contamination, it is necessary to sterilize used tools between samples. It is recommended to collect two samples from one specimen, one to archive, and one for the barcoding process. Sample preservation is crucial to overcome the issue of DNA degradation.\n\n'''Bulk samples'''\n\nA bulk sample is a type of environmental sample containing several organisms from the [[taxonomic group]] under study. The difference between bulk samples (in the sense used here) and other environmental samples is that the bulk sample usually provides a large quantity of good-quality DNA.<ref name=\":15\" /> Examples of bulk samples include aquatic macroinvertebrate sample collected by kick-net, or insect samples collected with a Malaise trap. Filtered or size-fractionated water samples containing whole organisms like unicellular eukaryotes are also sometimes defined as bulk samples. Such samples can be collected by the same techniques as used to obtain traditional samples for morphology-based identification.\n\n'''eDNA samples'''\n\nThe [[environmental DNA]] (eDNA) method is a non-invasive approach to detect and identify species from cellular debris or extracellular DNA present in environmental samples (e.g. water or soil) through barcoding or metabarcoding. The approach is based on the fact that every living organism leave DNA in the environment, and this environmental DNA can be detected even for organisms that are at very low abundance. Thus, for field sampling, the most crucial part is to use DNA-free material and tools on each sampling site or sample to avoid contamination, if the DNA of the target organism(s) is likely to be present in low quantities. On the other hand, an eDNA sample always includes the DNA of whole-cell, living microorganisms, which are often present in large quantities. Therefore, microorganism samples taken in the natural environment also are called eDNA samples, but contamination is less problematic in this context due to the large quantity of target organisms. The eDNA method is applied on most sample types, like water, sediment, soil, animal feces, stomach content or blood from e.g. leeches.<ref>{{Citation|last=Jelger Herder|title=Environmental DNA - a review of the possible applications for the detection of (invasive) species.|date=2014|publisher=RAVON|doi=10.13140/rg.2.1.4002.1208|last2=A.

These databases contain the DNA barcodes assigned to previously identified taxa. Most reference libraries do not cover all species within an organism group, and new entries are continually created. In the case of macro- and many microorganisms (such as algae), these reference libraries require detailed documentation (sampling location and date, person who collected it, image, etc.) and authoritative taxonomic identification of the voucher specimen, as well as submission of sequences in a particular format. The process also requires the storage of voucher specimens in museum collections and other collaborating institutions.

Diat.barcode provides data for two genetic markers, ''rbc''L (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) and 18S (18S ribosomal RNA). The database also involves additional, trait information of species, like morphological characteristics (biovolume, size dimensions, etc.), life-forms (mobility, colony-type, etc.) or ecological features (pollution sensitivity, etc.).\n\n=== Bioinformatic analysis ===\nIn order to obtain well structured, clean and interpretable data, raw sequencing data must be processed using bioinformatic analysis. The [[FASTQ format|FASTQ]] file with the sequencing data contains two types of information: the sequences detected in the sample ([[FASTA format|FASTA]] file) and a quality file with quality scores ([[Phred quality score|PHRED]] scores) associated with each nucleotide of each DNA sequence. The PHRED scores indicate the probability with which the associated nucleotide has been correctly scored.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+PHRED quality score and the associated certainty level\n|10\n|90%\n|-\n|20\n|99%\n|-\n|30\n|99.9%\n|-\n|40\n|99.99%\n|-\n|50\n|99.999%\n|}\nIn general, the PHRED score decreases towards the end of each DNA sequence. Thus some bioinformatics pipelines simply cut the end of the sequences at a defined threshold.\n\nSome sequencing technologies, like MiSeq, use paired-end sequencing during which sequencing is performed from both directions producing better quality. The overlapping sequences are then aligned into contigs and merged. Usually, several samples are pooled in one run, and each sample is characterized by a short DNA fragment, the tag. In a demultiplexing step, sequences are sorted using these tags to reassemble the separate samples. Before further analysis, tags and other adapters are removed from the barcoding sequence DNA fragment. During trimming, the bad quality sequences (low PHRED scores), or sequences that are much shorter or longer than the targeted DNA barcode, are removed. The following dereplication step is the process where all of the quality-filtered sequences are collapsed into a set of unique reads (individual sequence units ISUs) with the information of their abundance in the samples. After that, chimeras (i.e. compound sequences formed from pieces of mixed origin) are detected and removed.

However, DNA barcoding could improve traditional methods for the following reasons; DNA barcoding (i) can increase taxonomic resolution and harmonize the identification of taxa which are difficult to identify or lack experts, (ii) can more accurately/precisely relate environmental factors to specific taxa (iii) can increase comparability among regions, (iv) allows for the inclusion of early life stages and fragmented specimens, (v) allows delimitation of [[Species complex|cryptic]]/rare species (vi) allows for development of new indices e.g. rare/cryptic species which may be sensitive/tolerant to [[stressor]]s, (vii) increases the number of samples which can be processed and reduces processing time resulting in increased knowledge of species ecology, (viii) is a non-invasive way of monitoring when using [[Environmental DNA|eDNA]] methods.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Pawlowski|first=Jan|last2=Kelly-Quinn|first2=Mary|last3=Altermatt|first3=Florian|last4=Apoth\u00e9loz-Perret-Gentil|first4=Laure|last5=Beja|first5=Pedro|last6=Boggero|first6=Angela|last7=Borja|first7=Angel|last8=Bouchez|first8=Agn\u00e8s|last9=Cordier|first9=Tristan|date=2018|title=The future of biotic indices in the ecogenomic era: Integrating (e)DNA metabarcoding in biological assessment of aquatic ecosystems|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=637-638|pages=1295\u20131310|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.05.002|pmid=29801222|bibcode=2018ScTEn.637.1295P}}</ref>\n\n==== Time and cost ====\nDNA barcoding is faster than traditional morphological methods all the way from training through to taxonomic assignment. It takes less time to gain expertise in DNA methods than becoming an expert in taxonomy. In addition, the DNA barcoding workflow (i.e. from sample to result) is generally quicker than traditional morphological workflow and allows the processing of more samples.\n\n==== Taxonomic resolution ====\nDNA barcoding allows the resolution of taxa from higher (e.g. family) to lower (e.g. species) taxonomic levels, that are otherwise too difficult to identify using traditional morphological methods, like e.g. identification via microscopy. For example, [[Chironomidae]] (the non-biting midge) are widely distributed in both terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Their richness and abundance make them important for ecological processes and networks, and they are one of many invertebrate groups used in biomonitoring. Invertebrate samples can contain as many as 100 species of chironomids which often make up as much as 50% of a sample.

For example, detecting target DNA in aquatic systems depends on the concentration of DNA molecules at a site, which in turn can be affected by many factors. The presence of DNA molecules also depends on dispersion at a site, e.g. direction or strength of currents. It is not really known how DNA moves around in streams and lakes, which makes sampling difficult. Another factor might be the behavior of the target species, e.g. fish can have seasonal changes of movements, crayfish or mussels will release DNA in larger amounts just at certain times of their life (moulting, spawning). For DNA in soil, even less is known about distribution, quantity or quality.\n\n==== Incomplete barcode reference libraries ====\nThe major limitation of the barcoding method is that it relies on barcode reference libraries for the taxonomic identification of the sequences. The taxonomic identification is accurate only if a reliable reference is available. However, most databases are still incomplete, especially for smaller organisms e.g. fungi, phytoplankton, nematoda etc. In addition, current databases contain misidentifications, spelling mistakes and other errors. There is massive curation and completion effort around the databases for all organisms necessary, involving large barcoding projects (for example the iBOL project for the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) reference database).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ibol.org/|title=The International Barcode of Life Consortium|website=International Barcode of Life|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boldsystems.org/|title=Bold Systems v4|website=www.boldsystems.org|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref> However, completion and curation are difficult and time-consuming. Without vouchered specimens, there can be no certainty about whether the sequence used as a reference is correct. DNA sequence databases like GenBank contain many sequences that are not tied to [[Zoological specimen#Voucher specimens|vouchered specimens]] (for example, herbarium specimens, cultured cell lines, or sometimes images). This is problematic in the face of taxonomic issues such as whether several species should be split or combined, or whether past identifications were sound. Therefore, best practice for DNA barcoding is to sequence vouchered specimens.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schander|first=Christoffer|last2=Willassen|first2=Endre|date=2005|title=What can biological barcoding do for marine biology?|journal=Marine Biology Research|volume=1|issue=1|pages=79\u201383|doi=10.1080/17451000510018962|issn=1745-1000}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=S.

The parameters of bioinformatics [[Bioinformatics workflow management system|pipelines]] (for example OTU clustering, taxonomic assignment algorithms or thresholds etc.) are at the origin of much debate among DNA barcoding users.<ref name=\"ScienceDirect\"/> Sequencing technologies are also rapidly evolving, together with the tools for the analysis of the massive amounts of DNA data generated, and standardization of the methods is urgently needed to enable collaboration and data sharing at greater spatial and time-scale. This standardisation of barcoding methods at the European scale is part of the objectives of the European COST Action DNAqua-net <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dnaqua.net/|title=DNAquaNet|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref> and is also addressed by CEN (the European Committee for Standardization).<ref>CEN (2018) CEN/TC 230/WORKING GROUP 2 \u2013 Proposal for a new Working Group WG28 ''\u201cDNA and eDNA methods\u201d A plan to fulfil the DNA and eDNA standardization needs of EU legislation in Water Policy'' (Proposal following decisions of the 2017 Berlin Meeting of CEN/TC 230, its Working Groups and eDNA COST representatives)</ref>\n\nAnother criticism of DNA barcoding is its limited efficiency for accurate discrimination below species level (for example, to distinguish between varieties), for hybrid detection, and that it can be affected by evolutionary rates (Ref needed).\n\n==== Mismatches between conventional (morphological) and barcode based identification ====\nIt is important to know that taxa lists derived by conventional (morphological) identification are not, and maybe never will be, directly comparable to taxa lists derived from barcode based iendtification because of several reasons. The most important cause is probably the incompleteness and lack of accuracy of the molecular reference databases preventing a correct taxonomic assignment of eDNA sequences. Taxa not present in reference databases will not be found by eDNA, and sequences linked to a wrong name will lead to incorrect identification.<ref name=\":0\" /> Other known causes are a different sampling scale and size between a traditional and a molecular sample, the possible analysis of dead organisms, which can happen in different ways for both methods depending on organism group, and the specific selection of identification in either method, i.e. varying taxonomical expertise or possibility to identify certain organism groups, respectively primer bias leading also to a potential biased analysis of taxa.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Estimates of richness/diversity ====\nDNA Barcoding can result in an over or underestimate of species richness and diversity.

While DNA barcoding points to find a specific species, metabarcoding looks for the whole community.|478x478px]]DNA metabarcoding is defined as the barcoding of [[DNA]] or [[Environmental DNA|eDNA]] (environmental DNA) that allows for simultaneous identification of many taxa within the same (environmental) sample, however often within the same organism group. The main difference between the approaches is that metabarcoding, in contrast to barcoding, does not focus on one specific organism, but instead aims to determine species composition within a sample.\n\n=== Methodology ===\nThe metabarcoding procedure, like general barcoding, covers the steps of [[DNA extraction]], [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR amplification]], [[sequencing]] and [[data analysis]]. A barcode consists of a short variable [[gene]] region (for example, see [[Algae DNA barcoding#Target regions|different markers/barcodes]]) which is useful for taxonomic assignment flanked by highly conserved gene regions which can be used for [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] design.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite book|title=Environmental DNA : for biodiversity research and monitoring|last=Pierre|first=Taberlet|others=Bonin, Aurelie, 1979-|isbn=9780191079993|location=Oxford|pages=|oclc=1021883023|date = 2018-02-02}}</ref> Different genes are used depending if the aim is to barcode single species or metabarcoding several species.

In Korea, a Go variant called [[Go variants#Sunjang Baduk|Sunjang baduk]] was played.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/history/sunjang.html |title=Historic: Sunjang Go |author=John Fairbairn |accessdate=2007-11-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305195431/http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/history/sunjang.html |archivedate=2006-03-05 }}</ref>\n\n===Japan===\nAt the start of the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]], four [[Four go houses|Go academies]] were established. This table lists all heads of these houses, as well as some that were appointed heir but died before they became head of the house. Tokugawa also established the post of [[Godokoro]] (minister of Go), which was awarded to the strongest player of a generation. Such players were dubbed [[Meijin]] (brilliant man), which was considered equal to a 9 dan professional grade.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://senseis.xmp.net/?HistoricMeijin | author = Sensei's Library | title = Historic Meijins | accessdate = 2007-06-28 }}</ref> Over the 300-year period covered here, only ten players received the title of Meijin. Several other players (16 total) received the title of [[Jun-Meijin]] (half-Meijin), which is considered to equal an 8 dan professional grade and listed as such below. In some houses it was the custom that the head of the house was always named the same according to the [[iemoto]] system (\u5bb6\u5143). All heads of the house [[Inoue]] (\u4e95\u4e0a) were named Inseki (\u56e0\u78a9), heads of the house [[Yasui house|Yasui]] (\u5b89\u4e95 ) were named [[Yasui house|Senkaku]] (\u4ed9\u89d2) from the 4th head onward, and heads of the house [[Hayashi]] (\u6797) were named [[Monnyu]] (\u9580\u5165) from the second head onward. To distinguish between these players, the names listed below are the names they had before becoming head of their house, or after their retirement. The house [[Honinbo]] (\u672c\u56e0\u574a) had no such tradition, although heads would often take one character from the name of their predecessor into their own name, notably the character Shu (\u79c0) from the 14th head onward.\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin:0;\" \n!

In Korea, a Go variant called [[Go variants#Sunjang Baduk|Sunjang baduk]] was played.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/history/sunjang.html |title=Historic: Sunjang Go |author=John Fairbairn |accessdate=2007-11-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060305195431/http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/orient/go/history/sunjang.html |archivedate=2006-03-05 }}</ref>\n\n===Japan===\nAt the start of the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]], four [[Four go houses|Go academies]] were established. This table lists all heads of these houses, as well as some that were appointed heir but died before they became head of the house. Tokugawa also established the post of [[Godokoro]] (minister of Go), which was awarded to the strongest player of a generation. Such players were dubbed [[Meijin]] (brilliant man), which was considered equal to a 9 dan professional grade.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://senseis.xmp.net/?HistoricMeijin | author = Sensei's Library | title = Historic Meijins | accessdate = 2007-06-28 }}</ref> Over the 300-year period covered here, only ten players received the title of Meijin. Several other players (16 total) received the title of [[Jun-Meijin]] (half-Meijin), which is considered to equal an 8 dan professional grade and listed as such below. In some houses it was the custom that the head of the house was always named the same according to the [[iemoto]] system (\u5bb6\u5143). All heads of the house [[Inoue]] (\u4e95\u4e0a) were named Inseki (\u56e0\u78a9), heads of the house [[Yasui house|Yasui]] (\u5b89\u4e95 ) were named [[Yasui house|Senkaku]] (\u4ed9\u89d2) from the 4th head onward, and heads of the house [[Hayashi]] (\u6797) were named [[Monnyu]] (\u9580\u5165) from the second head onward. To distinguish between these players, the names listed below are the names they had before becoming head of their house, or after their retirement. The house [[Honinbo]] (\u672c\u56e0\u574a) had no such tradition, although heads would often take one character from the name of their predecessor into their own name, notably the character Shu (\u79c0) from the 14th head onward.\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin:0;\" \n!

In one such pathway, some cells do not have the usual [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s on their surfaces that viruses use to gain entry. The antiviral proteins (i.e., the [[antibodies]]) bind to antibody [[Fc receptor]]s that some of these cells have in the [[plasma membrane]]. The viruses bind to the antigen binding site at the other end of the antibody. ADE is common in cells cultured in the laboratory, but rarely occurs ''in vivo'' except for [[dengue virus]].

In such cases, the clinical course of the disease is more severe, and these people have higher [[viremia]] compared with those in whom ADE has not occurred. This explains the observation that while primary (first) infections cause mostly minor disease (dengue fever) in children, secondary infection (re-infection at a later date) is more likely to be associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever and/or dengue shock syndrome in both children and adults.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Guzman MG, Vazquez S | title = The complexity of antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection | journal = Viruses | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 2649\u201362 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21994635 | pmc = 3185591 | doi = 10.3390/v2122649 }}</ref>\n\nThere are four [[antigen]]ically different [[serotype]]s of dengue virus (dengue virus 1\u20134).<ref name=King2002/> In 2013 a fifth serotype was reported.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Normile D | year = 2013 | title = Tropical medicine.

Infection with dengue virus also produces some degree of [[cross-reactivity|cross-protective]] immunity against the other three serotypes.<ref name=Alvarez2006/> Neutralizing heterotypic (cross-reactive) IgG antibodies are responsible for this cross-protective immunity, which typically persists for a period of several months to a few years. These heterotypic antibody [[titer]]s decrease over long time periods (4 to 20 years).<ref name=Guzman2007/> While heterotypic IgG antibody titers decrease, homotypic IgG antibody titers increase over long time periods. This could be due to the preferential survival of long-lived [[memory B cell]]s producing homotypic antibodies.<ref name=Guzman2007/>\n\nIn addition to inducing neutralizing heterotypic antibodies, infection with dengue virus can also induce heterotypic antibodies which neutralize the virus only partially or not at all.<ref name=Goncalvez2007/> The production of such cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies could be the reason for more severe secondary infections. It is thought that by binding to but not neutralizing the virus, these antibodies cause it to behave as a \"[[Trojan Horse|trojan horse]]\",<ref name=Peluso1985/><ref name=Chen2002/><ref name=Witayathawornwong2005/> where it is delivered into the wrong compartment of [[dendritic cell]]s that have ingested the virus for destruction.<ref name=Rodenhuis2010/><ref name=Guzman2010/> Once inside the white blood cell, the virus replicates undetected, eventually generating very high virus titers which cause severe disease.<ref name=Dejnirattisai2010/>\n\nA study conducted by Modhiran et al.<ref name=Modhiran2010/> attempted to explain how non-neutralizing antibodies down regulate the immune response in the host cell through the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Toll-like receptors are known to recognize extra- and intracellular viral particles and to be a major basis of the cytokines production. In vitro experiments showed that the inflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon production was reduced when the ADE-dengue virus complex bound to the Fc receptor of THP-1 cells. This can be explained by both a decrease of Toll-like receptorproduction and a modification of its signaling pathway. On one hand, an unknown protein induced by the stimulated Fc receptor reduces the Toll-like receptor transcription and translation, which reduce the capacity of the cell to detect viral proteins. On the other hand, many proteins (TRIF, TRAF6, TRAM, TIRAP, IKK\u03b1, TAB1, TAB2, NF-\u03baB complex) involved in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway are down regulated, which led to a decrease of the cytokine production. Two of them, TRIF and TRAF6, are respectively down regulated by 2 proteins SARM and TANK up regulated by the stimulated Fc receptors.\n\nTo illustrate the phenomenon of ADE, consider the following example: an epidemic of dengue fever occurred in [[Cuba]], lasting from 1977 to 1979. The infecting serotype was dengue virus-1. This epidemic was followed by two more outbreaks of dengue fever\u2014one in 1981 and one in 1997; dengue virus-2 was the infecting serotype in both of these later epidemics. 205 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome occurred during the 1997 outbreak, all in people older than 15 years. All but three of these cases were demonstrated to have been previously infected by the dengue virus-1 serotype during the epidemic of 1977\u20131979.<ref name=Guzman2000/> Furthermore, people who had been infected with dengue virus-1 during the 1977-79 outbreak and secondarily infected with dengue virus-2 in 1997 had a 3-4 fold [[Odds ratio|increased probability]] of developing severe disease than those secondarily infected with dengue virus-2 in 1981.<ref name=Guzman2007/> This scenario can be explained by the presence of neutralizing heterotypic IgG antibodies in sufficient titers in 1981, the titers of which had decreased by 1997 to the point where they no longer provided significant cross-protective immunity.\n\n==In HIV-1 virus infection==\nADE of infection has also been reported in HIV. Like dengue virus, non-neutralizing level of antibodies have been found to enhance the viral infection through interactions of complement system and receptors.<ref name=Willey2001/> The increase in infection has been reported to be over 350 fold which is comparable to ADE in other viruses like dengue virus.<ref name=Willey2001/> ADE in HIV can be complement mediated or Fc receptor mediated. Complements in presence of HIV-1 positive sera have been found to enhance the infection of MT-2 T-cell line. The Fc-receptor mediated enhancement was reported when HIV infection was enhanced by sera from HIV-1 positive guinea pig enhanced the infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells without the presence of any complements.<ref name=Levy2007/> Complement component receptors CR2, CR3 and CR4 have been found to mediate this Complement-mediated enhancement of infection.<ref name=Willey2001/><ref name=Yu2010/> The infection of HIV-1 leads to activation of complements fragments of these complements can assist viruses with infection by facilitating viral interactions with host cells that express complement receptors.<ref name=Gras1991/> The deposition of complement on the virus brings the gp120 protein close to CD4 molecules on the surface of the cells, thus leading to facilitated viral entry.<ref name=Gras1991/> Viruses pre-exposed to non-neutralizing complement system have also been found to enhance infections in interdigitating dendritic cells. [[Opsonin|Opsonized]] viruses have not only shown enhanced entry but also favorable signalling cascades for HIV replication in interdigitating dendritic cells.<ref name=Bouhlal2007/> HIV-1 has also showed enhancement of infection in HT-29 cells when the viruses were pre-opsonized with complements C3 and C9 in seminal fluid. This enhanced rate of infection was almost 2 times greater than infection of HT-29 cells with virus alone.<ref name=Bouhlal2002/> Subramanian ''et al.'', reported that almost 72% of serum samples out of 39 HIV positive individuals contained complements that were known to enhance the infection. They also suggested that presence of neutralizing antibody or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-mediating antibodies in the serum contains infection-enhancing antibodies.<ref name=Subramanian2002/> The balance between the neutralizing antibodies and infection-enhancing antibodies changes as the disease progresses. During advanced stages of disease the proportion of infection-enhancing antibodies are generally higher than neutralizing antibodies.<ref name=Beck2008/> Increase in viral protein synthesis and RNA production have been reported to occur during the complement mediated enhancement of infection. Cells that are challenged with non neutralizing levels of complements have been found have accelerated release of reverse transcriptase and the viral progeny.<ref name=Robinson1990/> The interaction of anti-HIV antibodies with non-neutralizing complement exposed viruses also aid in binding of the virus and the erythrocytes which can lead to a more efficient delivery of viruses to the immune compromised organs.<ref name=Yu2010/>\n\nADE in HIV has raised questions about the risk of infections to volunteers who have taken subneutralizing levels of vaccine just like any other viruses that exhibit ADE. Gilbert ''et al.'', in 2005 reported that there was no ADE of infection when they used rgp120 vaccine in phase 1 and 2 trials.<ref name=Gilbert2005/> It has been emphasized that much research needs to be done in the field of immunity response to HIV-1, information from these studies can be used to produce a more effective vaccine.\n\n==Mechanism==\nThere are several possibilities to explain the phenomenon:\n# A viral surface protein laced with antibodies against a virus of one serotype binds to a similar virus with a different serotype. The binding is meant to neutralize the virus surface protein from attaching to the cell, but the antibody bound to virus also binds to the receptor of the cell, the Fc-region antibody receptor Fc\u03b3R. This brings the virus into close proximity to the virus-specific receptor, and the cell [[endocytosis|internalizes]] the virus through the normal infection route.<ref name=TakadaKawaoka2003/>\n# A virus surface protein may be attached to antibodies of a different serotype, activating the classical pathway of the [[complement system]]. The complement cascade system instead binds [[C1Q complex]] attached to the virus surface protein via the antibodies, which in turn bind C1q receptor found on cells, bringing the virus and the cell close enough for a specific virus receptor to bind the virus, beginning infection.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}} This mechanism has not been shown specifically for dengue virus infection, but is supposed to occur with Ebola virus infection ''in vitro''.<ref name=TakadaFeldmann2003/>\n# When an antibody to a virus is present for a different serotype, it is unable to neutralize the virus, which is then ingested into the cell as a sub-neutralized virus particle. These viruses are [[phagocytosis|phagocytosed]] as antigen-antibody complexes, and degraded by [[macrophage]]s. Upon ingestion the antibodies no longer even sub-neutralize the body due to the denaturing condition at the step for acidification of phagosome before fusion with [[lysosome]].{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} The virus becomes active and begins its proliferation within the cell.{{citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Original antigenic sin]]\n* Other ways in which antibodies can

This virus can use this mechanism to infect human [[macrophage]]s, causing a normally mild viral infection to become life-threatening.<ref>{{Cite book | vauthors = Dimmock NJ, Easton AJ, Leppard K |title=Introduction to modern virology |year=2007 |publisher=Blackwell Pub. |location=Malden, MA |isbn=978-1-4051-3645-7 |page=65}}</ref>\n\nAn ongoing question in the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] is whether\u2014and if so, to what extent\u2014ADE happens in coronavirus diseases.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tetro JA | title = Is COVID-19 receiving ADE from other coronaviruses? | journal = Microbes and Infection | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 72\u201373 | date = March 2020 | pmid = 32092539 | pmc = 7102551 | doi = 10.1016/j.micinf.2020.02.006 }}</ref>\n\n== In coronavirus infection ==\nNon-human primates vaccinated with modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus encoding full-length SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein and challenged with the SARs-CoV virus had lower viral loads but suffered from acute lung injury due to antibody enhancement.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu L et al | display-authors = 1 | title = Anti\u2013spike IgG causes severe acute lung injury by skewing macrophage responses during acute SARS-CoV infection | journal = JCI Insight | date = 2019 | url = https://insight.jci.org/articles/view/123158}}</ref> \n\n== In influenza infection ==\nPrior receipt of 2008\u201309 TIV was associated with increased risk of medically attended pH1N1 illness during the spring\u2013summer 2009 in Canada.

In such cases, the clinical course of the disease is more severe, and these people have higher [[viremia]] compared with those in whom ADE has not occurred. This explains the observation that while primary (first) infections cause mostly minor disease (dengue fever) in children, secondary infection (re-infection at a later date) is more likely to be associated with dengue hemorrhagic fever and/or dengue shock syndrome in both children and adults.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Guzman MG, Vazquez S | title = The complexity of antibody-dependent enhancement of dengue virus infection | journal = Viruses | volume = 2 | issue = 12 | pages = 2649\u201362 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21994635 | pmc = 3185591 | doi = 10.3390/v2122649 }}</ref>\n\nThere are four [[antigen]]ically different [[serotype]]s of dengue virus (dengue virus 1\u20134).<ref name=King2002/> In 2013 a fifth serotype was reported.<ref>Normile, D (October 2013). \"Tropical medicine.

Infection with dengue virus also produces some degree of [[cross-reactivity|cross-protective]] immunity against the other three serotypes.<ref name=Alvarez2006/> Neutralizing heterotypic (cross-reactive) IgG antibodies are responsible for this cross-protective immunity, which typically persists for a period of several months to a few years. These heterotypic antibody [[titer]]s decrease over long time periods (4 to 20 years).<ref name=Guzman2007/> While heterotypic IgG antibody titers decrease, homotypic IgG antibody titers increase over long time periods. This could be due to the preferential survival of long-lived [[memory B cell]]s producing homotypic antibodies.<ref name=Guzman2007/>\n\nIn addition to inducing neutralizing heterotypic antibodies, infection with dengue virus can also induce heterotypic antibodies which neutralize the virus only partially or not at all.<ref name=Goncalvez2007/> The production of such cross-reactive but non-neutralizing antibodies could be the reason for more severe secondary infections. It is thought that by binding to but not neutralizing the virus, these antibodies cause it to behave as a \"[[Trojan Horse|trojan horse]]\",<ref name=Peluso1985/><ref name=Chen2002/><ref name=Witayathawornwong2005/> where it is delivered into the wrong compartment of [[dendritic cell]]s that have ingested the virus for destruction.<ref name=Rodenhuis2010/><ref name=Guzman2010/> Once inside the white blood cell, the virus replicates undetected, eventually generating very high virus titers which cause severe disease.<ref name=Dejnirattisai2010/>\n\nA study conducted by Modhiran et al.<ref name=Modhiran2010/> attempted to explain how non-neutralizing antibodies down regulate the immune response in the host cell through the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Toll-like receptors are known to recognize extra- and intracellular viral particles and to be a major basis of the cytokines production. In vitro experiments showed that the inflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon production was reduced when the ADE-dengue virus complex bound to the Fc receptor of THP-1 cells. This can be explained by both a decrease of Toll-like receptorproduction and a modification of its signaling pathway. On one hand, an unknown protein induced by the stimulated Fc receptor reduces the Toll-like receptor transcription and translation, which reduce the capacity of the cell to detect viral proteins. On the other hand, many proteins (TRIF, TRAF6, TRAM, TIRAP, IKK\u03b1, TAB1, TAB2, NF-\u03baB complex) involved in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway are down regulated, which led to a decrease of the cytokine production. Two of them, TRIF and TRAF6, are respectively down regulated by 2 proteins SARM and TANK up regulated by the stimulated Fc receptors.\n\nTo illustrate the phenomenon of ADE, consider the following example: an epidemic of dengue fever occurred in [[Cuba]], lasting from 1977 to 1979. The infecting serotype was dengue virus-1. This epidemic was followed by two more outbreaks of dengue fever\u2014one in 1981 and one in 1997; dengue virus-2 was the infecting serotype in both of these later epidemics. 205 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome occurred during the 1997 outbreak, all in people older than 15 years. All but three of these cases were demonstrated to have been previously infected by the dengue virus-1 serotype during the epidemic of 1977\u20131979.<ref name=Guzman2000/> Furthermore, people who had been infected with dengue virus-1 during the 1977-79 outbreak and secondarily infected with dengue virus-2 in 1997 had a 3-4 fold [[Odds ratio|increased probability]] of developing severe disease than those secondarily infected with dengue virus-2 in 1981.<ref name=Guzman2007/> This scenario can be explained by the presence of neutralizing heterotypic IgG antibodies in sufficient titers in 1981, the titers of which had decreased by 1997 to the point where they no longer provided significant cross-protective immunity.\n\n==In HIV-1 virus infection==\nADE of infection has also been reported in HIV. Like dengue virus, non-neutralizing level of antibodies have been found to enhance the viral infection through interactions of complement system and receptors.<ref name=Willey2001/> The increase in infection has been reported to be over 350 fold which is comparable to ADE in other viruses like dengue virus.<ref name=Willey2001/> ADE in HIV can be complement mediated or Fc receptor mediated. Complements in presence of HIV-1 positive sera have been found to enhance the infection of MT-2 T-cell line. The Fc-receptor mediated enhancement was reported when HIV infection was enhanced by sera from HIV-1 positive guinea pig enhanced the infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells without the presence of any complements.<ref name=Levy2007/> Complement component receptors CR2, CR3 and CR4 have been found to mediate this Complement-mediated enhancement of infection.<ref name=Willey2001/><ref name=Yu2010/> The infection of HIV-1 leads to activation of complements fragments of these complements can assist viruses with infection by facilitating viral interactions with host cells that express complement receptors.<ref name=Gras1991/> The deposition of complement on the virus brings the gp120 protein close to CD4 molecules on the surface of the cells, thus leading to facilitated viral entry.<ref name=Gras1991/> Viruses pre-exposed to non-neutralizing complement system have also been found to enhance infections in interdigitating dendritic cells. [[Opsonin|Opsonized]] viruses have not only shown enhanced entry but also favorable signalling cascades for HIV replication in interdigitating dendritic cells.<ref name=Bouhlal2007/> HIV-1 has also showed enhancement of infection in HT-29 cells when the viruses were pre-opsonized with complements C3 and C9 in seminal fluid. This enhanced rate of infection was almost 2 times greater than infection of HT-29 cells with virus alone.<ref name=Bouhlal2002/> Subramanian ''et al.'', reported that almost 72% of serum samples out of 39 HIV positive individuals contained complements that were known to enhance the infection. They also suggested that presence of neutralizing antibody or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity-mediating antibodies in the serum contains infection-enhancing antibodies.<ref name=Subramanian2002/> The balance between the neutralizing antibodies and infection-enhancing antibodies changes as the disease progresses. During advanced stages of disease the proportion of infection-enhancing antibodies are generally higher than neutralizing antibodies.<ref name=Beck2008/> Increase in viral protein synthesis and RNA production have been reported to occur during the complement mediated enhancement of infection. Cells that are challenged with non neutralizing levels of complements have been found have accelerated release of reverse transcriptase and the viral progeny.<ref name=Robinson1990/> The interaction of anti-HIV antibodies with non-neutralizing complement exposed viruses also aid in binding of the virus and the erythrocytes which can lead to a more efficient delivery of viruses to the immune compromised organs.<ref name=Yu2010/>\n\nADE in HIV has raised questions about the risk of infections to volunteers who have taken subneutralizing levels of vaccine just like any other viruses that exhibit ADE. Gilbert ''et al.'', in 2005 reported that there was no ADE of infection when they used rgp120 vaccine in phase 1 and 2 trials.<ref name=Gilbert2005/> It has been emphasized that much research needs to be done in the field of immunity response to HIV-1, information from these studies can be used to produce a more effective vaccine.\n\n==Mechanism==\nThere are several possibilities to explain the phenomenon:\n# A viral surface protein laced with antibodies against a virus of one serotype binds to a similar virus with a different serotype. The binding is meant to neutralize the virus surface protein from attaching to the cell, but the antibody bound to virus also binds to the receptor of the cell, the Fc-region antibody receptor Fc\u03b3R. This brings the virus into close proximity to the virus-specific receptor, and the cell [[endocytosis|internalizes]] the virus through the normal infection route.<ref name=TakadaKawaoka2003/>\n# A virus surface protein may be attached to antibodies of a different serotype, activating the classical pathway of the [[complement system]]. The complement cascade system instead binds [[C1Q complex]] attached to the virus surface protein via the antibodies, which in turn bind C1q receptor found on cells, bringing the virus and the cell close enough for a specific virus receptor to bind the virus, beginning infection.{{citation needed|date=July 2008}} This mechanism has not been shown specifically for dengue virus infection, but is supposed to occur with Ebola virus infection ''in vitro''.<ref name=TakadaFeldmann2003/>\n# When an antibody to a virus is present for a different serotype, it is unable to neutralize the virus, which is then ingested into the cell as a sub-neutralized virus particle. These viruses are [[phagocytosis|phagocytosed]] as antigen-antibody complexes, and degraded by [[macrophage]]s. Upon ingestion the antibodies no longer even sub-neutralize the body due to the denaturing condition at the step for acidification of phagosome before fusion with [[lysosome]].{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} The virus becomes active and begins its proliferation within the cell.{{citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Original antigenic sin]]\n* Other ways in which antibodies can
