True electronic bulletin board systems arrived with the Computer Bulletin Board System in Chicago, which first came online on February 16, 1978.  Before long, most major cities had more than one BBS running on [[TRS-80]], [[Apple II]], [[Atari Corporation|Atari]], [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Sinclair Research|Sinclair]], and similar [[personal computer]]s. The IBM PC was introduced in 1981, and subsequent models of both Mac computers and PCs were used throughout the 1980s.  Multiple modems, followed by specialized telecommunication hardware, allowed many users to be online simultaneously. [[Compuserve]], [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]] and [[AOL]] were three of the largest BBS companies and were the first to migrate to the Internet in the 1990s.

The term is an analogy to the concept of [[viral infections]], which can spread rapidly from person to person. In a social media context, content or websites that are \"viral\" (or which \"go viral\") are those with a greater likelihood that users will reshare content posted (by another user) to their social network, leading to further sharing. In some cases, posts containing popular content or fast-breaking news have been rapidly shared and reshared by a huge number of users. Many social media sites provide specific functionality to help users reshare content, such as [[Twitter]]'s retweet button, [[Pinterest]]'s pin function, [[Facebook]]'s share option or [[Tumblr]]'s reblog function. [[Business]]es have a particular interest in [[viral marketing]] tactics because a viral campaign can achieve widespread advertising coverage (particularly if the viral reposting itself makes the news) for a fraction of the cost of a traditional marketing campaign, which typically uses printed materials, like newspapers, [[magazine]]s, mailings, and billboards, and television and radio commercials. [[Nonprofit organization]]s and [[activist]]s may have similar interests in posting content on social media sites with the aim of it going viral. A popular component and feature of Twitter is retweeting. Twitter allows other people to keep up with important events, stay connected with their peers, and can contribute in various ways throughout social media.<ref>{{Cite arxiv |eprint=1106.0346 |title=Entropy-based Classification of 'Retweeting' Activity on Twitter |last=Ghosh |first=Rumi |date=June 2011 |class=cs.SI}}</ref> When certain posts become popular, they start to get [[retweet]]ed over and over again, becoming viral. Hashtags can be used in tweets, and can also be used to take count of how many people have used that hashtag.\n\n=== Bots ===\nSocial media can enable companies to get in the form of greater market share and increased audiences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Castronovo|first=Cristina|date=2012|title=Social Media in Alternative Marketing Communication Model|url=|journal=Journal of Marketing Development & Competitivness|volume=6|pages=117\u2013136}}</ref> [[Internet bot]]s have been developed which facilitate social media marketing.

In many ways, mainstream [[journalist]]s have maintained an authoritative voice as the storytellers of the American past. Their documentary style narratives, detailed exposes, and their positions in the present make them prime sources for public memory. Specifically, news media journalists have shaped collective memory on nearly every major national event \u2013 from the deaths of social and political figures to the progression of political hopefuls. Journalists provide elaborate descriptions of commemorative events in U.S. history and contemporary popular cultural sensations. Many Americans learn the significance of historical events and political issues through news media, as they are presented on popular news stations.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pajala |first1=Mary |year=2012 |title=Television as an Archive of Memory? |journal=Critical Studies in Television |volume=5 |issue=2|pages=133\u2013145 |doi=10.7227/cst.5.2.16}}</ref> However, journalistic influence is growing less important, whereas social networking sites such as [[Facebook]], YouTube and [[Twitter]], provide a constant supply of alternative news sources for users.\n\nAs [[social networking]] becomes more popular among older and younger generations, sites such as Facebook and YouTube, gradually undermine the traditionally authoritative voices of news media. For example, American citizens contest media coverage of various social and political events as they see fit, inserting their voices into the narratives about America's past and present and shaping their own collective memories.<ref>Motti Neiger, Oren Meyers and Eyal Zandberg.

News media coverage of the incident was minimal until social media users made the story recognizable through their constant discussion of the case. Approximately one month after the fatal shooting of [[Trayvon Martin]], its online coverage by everyday Americans garnered national attention from mainstream media journalists, in turn exemplifying [[media activism]]. In some ways, the spread of this tragic event through alternative news sources parallels that of [[Emmitt Till]] \u2013 whose murder by lynching in 1955 became a national story after it was circulated in African-American and Communist newspapers.\n\n===Interpersonal relationships===\n[[File:Social media team.jpeg|thumb|Modern day teenagers interacting]]\nSocial media is used to fulfill perceived social needs, but not all needs can be fulfilled by social media.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Z. |last2=Tchernev |first2=J.

The authors sampled over 632 girls and boys from the ages of 12\u201316 from Spain in an effort to confirm their beliefs.

The researchers also noted that the traditional stereotypes are often upheld by boys more so than girls. The authors described how neither stereotype was entirely positive, but most people viewed masculine values as more positive.\n\n===Cognition and memory===\nAccording to writer Christine Rosen in \"Virtual Friendship, and the New Narcissism,\" many social media sites encourage status-seeking.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/virtual-friendship-and-the-new-narcissism |title=Virtual Friendship and the New Narcissism |work=The New Atlantis |accessdate=2016-02-29 |author=Rosen, Christine}}</ref> According to Rosen, the practice and definition of \"friendship\" changes in virtuality. Friendship in these virtual spaces is thoroughly different from real-world friendship. In its traditional sense, friendship is a relationship which, broadly speaking, involves the sharing of mutual interests, reciprocity, trust, and the revelation of intimate details over time and within specific social (and cultural) contexts. Because friendship depends on mutual revelations that are concealed from the rest of the world, it can only flourish within the boundaries of privacy; the idea of public friendship is an oxymoron.\" Rosen also cites Brigham Young University researchers who \"recently surveyed 184 users of social networking sites and found that heavy users 'feel less socially involved with the community around them.'\"\nCritic Nicholas G.

At the same time, concerns have been raised about possible links between heavy social media use and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and even the issues of [[cyberbullying]], online [[harassment]] and \"[[Internet troll|trolling]]\".

This finding was consistent with other studies that found people with high social comparison orientation make more social comparisons once on social media.\n\nPeople compare their own lives to the lives of their friends through their friends' posts. People are motivated to portray themselves in a way that is appropriate to the situation and serves their best interest. Often the things posted online are the positive aspects of people's lives, making other people question why their own lives are not as exciting or fulfilling. This can lead to depression and other self-esteem issues as well as decrease their satisfaction of life as they feel if their life is not exciting enough to put online it is not as good as their friends or family.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hawi | first1 = N.S. | last2 = Samaha | first2 = M. | year = 2017 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nazir_Hawi/publication/306048463_The_Relations_Among_Social_Media_Addiction_Self-Esteem_and_Life_Satisfaction_in_University_Students/links/59efa4b6a6fdcce2096dc335/The-Relations-Among-Social-Media-Addiction-Self-Esteem-and-Life-Satisfaction-in-University-Students.pdf |title=The Relations Among Social Media Addiction, Self-Esteem, and Life Satisfaction in University Students]| journal = Social Science Computer Review | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 576\u2013586 | doi = 10.1177/0894439316660340 }}</ref>\n\nStudies have shown that self comparison on social media can have dire effects on physical and mental health because they give us the ability to seek approval and compare ourselves.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Stefanone, M.A. |author2=Lackaff, D. |author3=Rosen, D. |date=2011 |title=Contingencies of Self-Worth and Social-Networking-Site Behavior |url=http://www.buffalo.edu/content/dam/cas/communication/files/Stefanone/Stefanone_cyberpsych.2011.pdf |journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|volume=14 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=41\u20139 |doi=10.1089/cyber.2010.0049 |pmid=21329442 }}</ref> Social media has both a practical usage- to connect us with others, but also can lead to fulfillment of gratification.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Quan-Haase |first=Anabel |last2=Young |first2=Alyson L.|date=September 14, 2010|title=Uses and Gratifications of Social Media: A Comparison of Facebook and Instant Messaging |journal=Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society |language=en |volume=30|issue=5|pages=350\u2013361 |doi=10.1177/0270467610380009|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8423ac0b397329ad53605d1e8e1cdd5f9b4cade8 }}</ref> In fact, one study suggests that because a critical aspect of social networking sites involve spending hours, if not months customizing a personal profile, and encourage a sort of social currency based on likes, followers and comments- they provide a forum for persistent \"appearance conversations\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/children-teens-media-and-body-image# |title=Children, Teens, Media, and Body Image |website=Common Sense Media|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}</ref> These appearance centered conversations that forums like Facebook, Instagram among others provide can lead to feelings of disappointment in looks and personality when not enough likes or comments are achieved.

Ambivalence refers to a user's confusion about the benefits she can get from using a social media site. Emotional exhaustion refers to the stress a user has when using a social media site. Depersonalization refers to the emotional detachment from a social media site a user experiences. The three burnout factors can all negatively influence the user's social media continuance. This study provides an instrument to measure the burnout a user can experience, when his or her social media \"friends\" are generating an overwhelming amount of useless information (e.g., \"what I had for dinner\", \"where I am now\").\n\n====Adolescents====\nExcessive use of digital technology, like social media, by adolescents can cause disruptions in their physical and mental health, in sleeping patterns, their weight and levels of exercise and notably in their academic performance. Research has continued to demonstrate that long hours spent on mobile devices have shown a positive relationship with an increase in teenagers' BMI and a lack of physical activity.

Abbreviations have been introduced to cut down on the time it takes to respond online. The commonly known \"[[LOL]]\" has become globally recognized as the abbreviation for \"laugh out loud\" thanks to social media.\n\nAnother trend that influences the way youth communicates is (through) the use of hashtags. With the introduction of social media platforms such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]], the hashtag was created to easily organize and search for information. Hashtags can be used when people want to advocate for a movement, store content or tweets from a movement for future use, and allow other social media users to contribute to a discussion about a certain movement by using existing hashtags. Using hashtags as a way to advocate for something online makes it easier and more accessible for more people to acknowledge it around the world.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Saxton|first=Gregory D.|last2=Niyirora|first2=Jerome N.|last3=Guo|first3=Chao|last4=Waters|first4=Richard D.|date=Spring 2015|title=#AdvocatingForChange: The Strategic Use of Hashtags in Social Media Advocacy|journal=Advances in Social Work|volume=16|pages=154\u2013169|doi=10.18060/17952|doi-access=free}}</ref> As hashtags such as #tbt (\"[[throwback Thursday]]\") become a part of online communication, it influenced the way in which youth share and communicate in their daily lives.

There has always been a huge debate on the ownership of the content on social media platforms because it is generated by the users and hosted by the company. Added to this is the danger to security of information, which can be leaked to third parties with economic interests in the platform, or parasites who comb the data for their own databases.<ref name=Jones>{{cite web |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/fall05-papers/facebook.pdf |last1=Jones |first1=Harvey |last2=Soltren |first2=Jos\u00e9 Hiram |title=Facebook: Threats to Privacy |publisher=MIT Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab |year= 2005 |accessdate=2018-04-04 }}</ref>\n\n===Privacy===\n[[Privacy concerns with social networking services|Privacy]] rights advocates warn users on social media about the collection of their personal data. Some information is captured without the user's knowledge or [[consent]] through electronic tracking and third party applications. Data may also be collected for law enforcement and governmental purposes,<ref name=Auer2001/> by [[social media intelligence]] using [[data mining]] techniques.<ref name=Jones/> Data and information may also be collected for third party use. When information is shared on social media, that information is no longer private. There have been many cases in which young persons especially, share personal information, which can attract predators. It is very important to monitor what you share, and to be aware of who you could potentially be sharing that information with. Teens especially share significantly more information on the internet now than they have in the past. Teens are much more likely to share their personal information, such as email address, phone number, and school names.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/05/21/teens-social-media-and-privacy/ |title=Teens, Social Media, and Privacy |last=Madden |first=Mary |display-authors=etal |date=May 21, 2013 |website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science & Tech |access-date=2016-11-29 }}</ref> Studies suggest that teens are not aware of what they are posting and how much of that information can be accessed by third parties.\n\nThere are arguments that \"privacy is dead\" and that with social media growing more and more, some heavy social media users appear to have become quite unconcerned with privacy. Others argue, however, that people are still very concerned about their privacy, but are being ignored by the companies running these social networks, who can sometimes make a profit off of sharing someone's personal information. There is also a disconnect between social media user's words and their actions. Studies suggest that surveys show that people want to keep their lives private, but their actions on social media suggest otherwise. Another factor is ignorance of how accessible social media posts are. Some social media users who have been criticized for inappropriate comments stated that they did not realize that anyone outside their circle of friends would read their post; in fact, on some social media sites, unless a user selects higher privacy settings, their content is shared with a wide audience.\n\nAccording to a 2016 article diving into the topic of sharing privately and the effect social media has on expectations of privacy, \"1.18 billion people will log into their [[Facebook]] accounts, 500 million tweets will be sent, and there will be 95 million photos and videos posted on [[Instagram]]\" in a day. Much of the privacy concerns individuals face stem from their own posts on a form of social network. Users have the choice to share voluntarily, and has been ingrained into society as routine and normative. Social media is a snapshot of our lives; a community we have created on the behaviors of sharing, posting, liking, and communicating. Sharing has become a phenomenon which social media and networks have uprooted and introduced to the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/sunday-review/we-want-privacy-but-cant-stop-sharing.html|title=We Want Privacy, but Can't Stop Sharing|last=Murphy|first=Kate|date=October 4, 2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=}}</ref> The idea of privacy is redundant; once something is posted, its accessibility remains constant even if we select who is potentially able to view it.

Our children |url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ991339.pdf |website=files.eric.ed.gov}}</ref> There are concerns that social media tools can be misused for [[cyberbullying]] or sharing inappropriate content. As result, cell phones have been banned from some classrooms, and some schools have blocked many popular social media websites. Many schools have realized that they need to loosen restrictions, teach digital citizenship skills, and even incorporate these tools into classrooms. Some schools permit students to use [[smartphone]]s or [[tablet computer]]s in class, as long as the students are using these devices for academic purposes, such as doing research. Using Facebook in class allows for integration of multimodal content such as student-created photographs and video and URLs to other texts, in a platform that many students are already familiar with. Twitter can be used to enhance communication building and critical thinking and it provides students with an informal \"[[back channel]]\"), and extend discussion outside of class time.\n\n===Censorship by governments===\n{{Main|Internet censorship}}\n[[File:Thai-coup-detat-2014-social-media-banner.jpg|thumb|Banner in [[Bangkok]], observed on June 30, 2014, informing the Thai public that 'like' or 'share' activity on social media may land them in jail]]\n\nSocial media often features in political struggles to control public perception and online activity. In some countries, [[Internet police]] or [[secret police]] monitor or control citizens' use of social media. For example, in 2013 some social media was banned in [[Turkey]] after the Taksim [[Gezi Park protests]]. Both Twitter and YouTube were temporarily suspended in the country by a court's decision. A new law, passed by [[Turkish Parliament]], has granted immunity to Telecommunications Directorate (T\u0130B) personnel. The T\u0130B was also given the authority to block access to specific websites without the need for a court order.<ref>{{cite web|author=Salih Sar\u0131kaya |title=Social Media Ban In Turkey: What Does It Mean? by Salih Sar\u0131kaya |url=http://www.salihsarikaya.com/en/social-media-ban-in-turkey-what-does-it-mean-by-salih-sarikaya/ |date=October 30, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006012638/http://www.salihsarikaya.com/en/social-media-ban-in-turkey-what-does-it-mean-by-salih-sarikaya/ |archivedate=2014-10-06 }}</ref> Yet T\u0130B's 2014 blocking of Twitter was ruled by the constitutional court to violate free speech.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-twitter-ban-idUSBREA311BF20140402 |title=Turkey's Twitter ban violates free speech: constitutional court |work=Reuters |date=April 2, 2014 }}</ref> More recently, in the [[2014 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat]], the public was explicitly instructed not to 'share' or 'like' dissenting views on social media or face prison. In July of that same year, in response to [[WikiLeaks]]' release of a secret suppression order made by the [[Supreme Court of Victoria|Victorian Supreme Court]], media lawyers were quoted in the [[Australia]]n media to the effect that \"anyone who tweets a link to the Wikileaks report, posts it on Facebook, or shares it in any way online could also face charges\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/social-media-users-could-be-charged-for-sharing-wikileaks-story-20140730-zye0b.html |title=Social media users could be charged for sharing Wikileaks story |author=Mex Cooper |publisher=[[Brisbane Times]] |date=July 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Decentralization and open standards===\n[[Mastodon (software)|Mastodon]], [[GNU social]], [[Diaspora (social network)|Diaspora]], [[Friendica]] and other compatible software packages operate as a loose federation of mostly volunteer-operated servers, called the [[Fediverse]], which connect with each other through the open source protocol [[ActivityPub]]. In early 2019, Mastodon successfully blocked the spread of violent right-wing extremism when the Twitter alternative [[Gab (social network)|Gab]] tried to associate with Mastodon, and their independent servers quickly contained its dissemination.<ref>Kan, M.

Retrieved 14 December 2019.</ref>\n\nIn December 2019, Twitter CEO [[Jack Dorsey]] made a similar suggestion, stating that efforts would be taken to achieve an \"open and decentralized standard for social media\". Rather than \"deplatforming\", such standards would allow a more scalable, and customizable approach to content moderation and censorship, and involve a number of companies, in the way that e-mail servers work.\n\n===Self-censorship by social media platforms===\n{{Main|Deplatforming|Twitter suspensions}}\n[[Deplatforming]] is a form of Internet censorship in which controversial speakers or speech are suspended, banned, or otherwise shut down by social media platforms and other service providers that normally provide a venue for free expression.<ref name=Reynolds/> As early as 2015, platforms such as [[Reddit]] began to enforce selective bans based, for example, on [[terms of service]] that prohibit \"[[hate speech]]\".<ref name=ACM>{{cite journal |title=You Can't Stay Here: The Efficacy of Reddit's 2015 Ban Examined Through Hate Speech |first1=Eshwar |last1=Chandrasekharan |first2=Umashanti |last2=Pavalanathan |display-authors=etal |journal=Proc.

How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and Facebook,\u201d the media plays a large role in shaping people's perceptions of specific social networking sites. When looking at the site [[Myspace|MySpace]], after adults started to realize how popular the sight was becoming with teens, news media became heavily concerned with teen participation and the potential dangers they faced using the site. As a result, teens avoided joining the site because of the associated risks (e.g. child predators and lack of control) and parents began to publicly denounce the site. Ultimately, the site was labeled as dangerous, and many were detracted from interacting with the site. As boyd also describes, when [[Facebook]] initially launched in 2004, it solely targeted college students and access was intentionally limited. Facebook started as a [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-only social networking site before expanding to all other [[Ivy League]] schools. It then made its way to other top universities and ultimately to a wider range of schools. Because of its origins, some saw Facebook as an \u201celite\u201d social networking site. While it was very open and accepting to some, it seemed to outlaw and shun out most others who didn't fit that \u201celite\u201d categorization. These narratives propagated by the media influenced the large movement of teenage users from one social networking site to another.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race After the Internet|last=boyd|first=danah|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=|editor-last=Nakamura|editor-first=Lisa|location=|pages=203\u2013222|chapter=White Flight in Networked Publics?

Social media can help to improve an individual's sense of connectedness with real or [[online]] communities and can be an effective communication (or [[marketing]]) tool for corporations, entrepreneurs, non-profit organizations, advocacy groups, political parties, and governments.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Information Age}}\n{{multiple image |align=left |direction=vertical |width=220\n|image1=Interface Message Processor Front Panel.jpg |caption1 =Front panel of the 1969-era [[ARPANET]] Interface Message Processor.\n|image2=The IMP Log The Very First Message Sent on the Internet (6293913865).jpg |caption2=IMP log for the first message sent over the Internet, using ARPANET.\n}}\nSocial media may have roots in the 1840s introduction of the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], which connected the United States.<ref>{{cite web\n| author       = \n| title        = The definitive history of social media\n| url          = https://www.dailydot.com/debug/history-of-social-media/\n| work         = The Daily Dot\n| location     = online\n| date         = September 11, 2016\n| access-date=2018-02-05\n}}\n</ref>\nThe [[PLATO system]] launched in 1960, which was developed at the [[University of Illinois]] and subsequently commercially marketed by [[Control Data Corporation]], offered early forms of social media features with 1973-era innovations such as Notes, PLATO's message-forum application; TERM-talk, its instant-messaging feature; [[Talkomatic]], perhaps the first online chat room; News Report, a crowd-sourced online newspaper and blog; and Access Lists, enabling the owner of a note file or other application to limit access to a certain set of users, for example, only friends, classmates, or co-workers.\n\n[[ARPANET]], which first came online in 1967, had by the late 1970s developed a rich cultural exchange of non-government/business ideas and communication, as evidenced by the [[ARPANET#Rules and etiquette|network etiquette]] (or \"netiquette\") described in a 1982 handbook on computing at [[MIT]]'s [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]].<ref name=Stacy>{{cite web |last=Stacy |first=Christopher C. |date=September 7, 1982 |title=Getting Started Computing at the AI Lab |issue=Working Paper 235 |publisher=MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory |url=https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/41180/ai_wp_235.pdf?sequence=4 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323132534/https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/41180/AI_WP_235.pdf?sequence=4 |archivedate=2019-03-23 }}</ref> ARPANET evolved into the [[Internet]] following the publication of the first [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) specification, {{IETF RFC|675}} (''Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program''), written by [[Vint Cerf]], [[Yogen Dalal]] and Carl Sunshine in 1974.<ref>[[Vint Cerf|Cerf, Vinton]]; [[Yogen Dalal|Dalal, Yogen]]; Sunshine, Carl (December 1974), {{IETF RFC|675}}, ''Specification of Internet Transmission Control Protocol''</ref> This became the foundation of [[Usenet]], conceived by [[Tom Truscott]] and [[Jim Ellis (computing)|Jim Ellis]] in 1979 at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] and [[Duke University]], and established in 1980.\n\nA precursor of the electronic [[bulletin board system]] (BBS), known as [[Community Memory]], had already appeared by 1973. True electronic bulletin board systems arrived with the Computer Bulletin Board System in Chicago, which first came online on February 16, 1978.  Before long, most major cities had more than one BBS running on [[TRS-80]], [[Apple II]], [[Atari Corporation|Atari]], [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[Sinclair Research|Sinclair]], and similar [[personal computer]]s. The IBM PC was introduced in 1981, and subsequent models of both Mac computers and PCs were used throughout the 1980s.  Multiple modems, followed by specialized telecommunication hardware, allowed many users to be online simultaneously. [[Compuserve]], [[Prodigy (online service)|Prodigy]] and [[AOL]] were three of the largest BBS companies and were the first to migrate to the Internet in the 1990s.

According to [[Andreas Kaplan]], mobile social media applications can be differentiated among four types:<ref name='mobileKaplan' />\n\n# ''Space-timers'' (location and time sensitive): Exchange of messages with relevance mostly for one specific location at one specific point in time (e.g. [[Facebook Places]] [[WhatsApp]]; [[Foursquare City Guide|Foursquare]])\n# ''Space-locators'' (only location sensitive): Exchange of messages, with relevance for one specific location, which is tagged to a certain place and read later by others (e.g. [[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]]; [[Qype]], [[Tumblr]], [[Fishbrain]])\n# ''Quick-timers'' (only time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media [[mobile apps]] to increase immediacy (e.g. posting [[Twitter]] messages or [[Facebook]] status updates)\n# ''Slow-timers'' (neither location nor time sensitive): Transfer of traditional social media applications to [[mobile devices]] (e.g. watching a [[YouTube]] video or reading/editing a [[Wikipedia]] article)\n\n==Elements and function==\n\n===Viral content===\nSome social media sites have potential for content posted there to spread ''[[Viral phenomenon|virally]]'' over social networks. The term is an analogy to the concept of [[viral infections]], which can spread rapidly from person to person. In a social media context, content or websites that are \"viral\" (or which \"go viral\") are those with a greater likelihood that users will reshare content posted (by another user) to their social network, leading to further sharing. In some cases, posts containing popular content or fast-breaking news have been rapidly shared and reshared by a huge number of users. Many social media sites provide specific functionality to help users reshare content, such as [[Twitter]]'s retweet button, [[Pinterest]]'s pin function, [[Facebook]]'s share option or [[Tumblr]]'s reblog function. [[Business]]es have a particular interest in [[viral marketing]] tactics because a viral campaign can achieve widespread advertising coverage (particularly if the viral reposting itself makes the news) for a fraction of the cost of a traditional marketing campaign, which typically uses printed materials, like newspapers, [[magazine]]s, mailings, and billboards, and television and radio commercials. [[Nonprofit organization]]s and [[activist]]s may have similar interests in posting content on social media sites with the aim of it going viral. A popular component and feature of Twitter is retweeting. Twitter allows other people to keep up with important events, stay connected with their peers, and can contribute in various ways throughout social media.<ref>{{Cite arxiv |eprint=1106.0346 |title=Entropy-based Classification of 'Retweeting' Activity on Twitter |last=Ghosh |first=Rumi |date=June 2011 |class=cs.SI}}</ref> When certain posts become popular, they start to get [[retweet]]ed over and over again, becoming viral. Hashtags can be used in tweets, and can also be used to take count of how many people have used that hashtag.\n\n=== Bots ===\nSocial media can enable companies to get in the form of greater market share and increased audiences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Castronovo|first=Cristina|date=2012|title=Social Media in Alternative Marketing Communication Model|url=|journal=Journal of Marketing Development & Competitivness|volume=6|pages=117\u2013136}}</ref> [[Internet bot]]s have been developed which facilitate social media marketing.

They suggest that interactions on the website encourage representing oneself in the traditional gender constructs, which helps maintain gender stereotypes.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Basow |first1=susan A. |title=Gender : stereotypes and roles . |date=1992 |publisher=Thomson Brooks/ Cole publishing Co. |location=Belmont CA.

In contrast girls generally post more images that include themselves, friends and things they have emotional ties to, which the researchers attributed that to the higher emotional intelligence of girls at a younger age. The authors sampled over 632 girls and boys from the ages of 12\u201316 from Spain in an effort to confirm their beliefs. The researchers concluded that masculinity is more commonly associated with a positive psychological well-being, while femininity displays less psychological well-being.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Facebook Involvement, Objectified Body Consciousness, Body Shame, and Sexual Assertiveness in College Women and Men |journal=Sex Roles |volume=72 |issue=1\u20132 |doi=10.1007/s11199-014-0441-1 |year=2014 |pages=1\u201314 | last1 = Manago | first1 = Adriana M. | last2 = Ward | first2 = L.

Users of Facebook generally use their profile to reflect that they are a \"normal\" person. Social media was found to uphold gender stereotypes both feminine and masculine. The researchers also noted that the traditional stereotypes are often upheld by boys more so than girls. The authors described how neither stereotype was entirely positive, but most people viewed masculine values as more positive.\n\n===Cognition and memory===\nAccording to writer Christine Rosen in \"Virtual Friendship, and the New Narcissism,\" many social media sites encourage status-seeking.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/virtual-friendship-and-the-new-narcissism |title=Virtual Friendship and the New Narcissism |work=The New Atlantis |accessdate=2016-02-29 |author=Rosen, Christine}}</ref> According to Rosen, the practice and definition of \"friendship\" changes in virtuality. Friendship in these virtual spaces is thoroughly different from real-world friendship. In its traditional sense, friendship is a relationship which, broadly speaking, involves the sharing of mutual interests, reciprocity, trust, and the revelation of intimate details over time and within specific social (and cultural) contexts. Because friendship depends on mutual revelations that are concealed from the rest of the world, it can only flourish within the boundaries of privacy; the idea of public friendship is an oxymoron.\" Rosen also cites Brigham Young University researchers who \"recently surveyed 184 users of social networking sites and found that heavy users 'feel less socially involved with the community around them.'\"\nCritic Nicholas G.

Some users have experienced threats of violence online and have feared these threats manifesting themselves offline. At the same time, concerns have been raised about possible links between heavy social media use and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and even the issues of [[cyberbullying]], online [[harassment]] and \"[[Internet troll|trolling]]\". According to cyber bullying statistics from the i-Safe Foundation, over half of adolescents and teens have been bullied online, and about the same number have engaged in cyber bullying.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.bullyingstatistics.org/content/cyber-bullying-statistics.html | title=Cyber Bullying Statistics| date=July 7, 2015}}</ref> Both the bully and the victim are negatively affected, and the intensity, duration, and frequency of bullying are the three aspects that increase the negative effects on both of them.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Peebles|first=E|date=2014|title=Cyberbullying: Hiding behind the screen.|journal=Paediatrics & Child Health|volume=19|issue=10|pages=527\u2013528|doi=10.1093/pch/19.10.527|pmid=25587229|pmc=4276384}}</ref> Studies also show that social media have negative effects on peoples' self-esteem and self-worth.

This finding was consistent with other studies that found people with high social comparison orientation make more social comparisons once on social media.\n\nPeople compare their own lives to the lives of their friends through their friends' posts. People are motivated to portray themselves in a way that is appropriate to the situation and serves their best interest. Often the things posted online are the positive aspects of people's lives, making other people question why their own lives are not as exciting or fulfilling. This can lead to depression and other self-esteem issues as well as decrease their satisfaction of life as they feel if their life is not exciting enough to put online it is not as good as their friends or family.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hawi | first1 = N.S. | last2 = Samaha | first2 = M. | year = 2017 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nazir_Hawi/publication/306048463_The_Relations_Among_Social_Media_Addiction_Self-Esteem_and_Life_Satisfaction_in_University_Students/links/59efa4b6a6fdcce2096dc335/The-Relations-Among-Social-Media-Addiction-Self-Esteem-and-Life-Satisfaction-in-University-Students.pdf |title=The Relations Among Social Media Addiction, Self-Esteem, and Life Satisfaction in University Students]| journal = Social Science Computer Review | volume = 35 | issue = 5| pages = 576\u2013586 | doi = 10.1177/0894439316660340 }}</ref>\n\nStudies have shown that self comparison on social media can have dire effects on physical and mental health because they give us the ability to seek approval and compare ourselves.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Stefanone, M.A. |author2=Lackaff, D. |author3=Rosen, D. |date=2011 |title=Contingencies of Self-Worth and Social-Networking-Site Behavior |url=http://www.buffalo.edu/content/dam/cas/communication/files/Stefanone/Stefanone_cyberpsych.2011.pdf |journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|volume=14 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=41\u20139 |doi=10.1089/cyber.2010.0049 |pmid=21329442 }}</ref> Social media has both a practical usage- to connect us with others, but also can lead to fulfillment of gratification.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Quan-Haase |first=Anabel |last2=Young |first2=Alyson L.|date=September 14, 2010|title=Uses and Gratifications of Social Media: A Comparison of Facebook and Instant Messaging |journal=Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society |language=en |volume=30|issue=5|pages=350\u2013361 |doi=10.1177/0270467610380009|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/8423ac0b397329ad53605d1e8e1cdd5f9b4cade8 }}</ref> In fact, one study suggests that because a critical aspect of social networking sites involve spending hours, if not months customizing a personal profile, and encourage a sort of social currency based on likes, followers and comments- they provide a forum for persistent \"appearance conversations\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/children-teens-media-and-body-image# |title=Children, Teens, Media, and Body Image |website=Common Sense Media|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}</ref> These appearance centered conversations that forums like Facebook, Instagram among others provide can lead to feelings of disappointment in looks and personality when not enough likes or comments are achieved.

Ambivalence refers to a user's confusion about the benefits she can get from using a social media site. Emotional exhaustion refers to the stress a user has when using a social media site. Depersonalization refers to the emotional detachment from a social media site a user experiences. The three burnout factors can all negatively influence the user's social media continuance. This study provides an instrument to measure the burnout a user can experience, when his or her social media \"friends\" are generating an overwhelming amount of useless information (e.g., \"what I had for dinner\", \"where I am now\").\n\n====Adolescents====\nExcessive use of digital technology, like social media, by adolescents can cause disruptions in their physical and mental health, in sleeping patterns, their weight and levels of exercise and notably in their academic performance. Research has continued to demonstrate that long hours spent on mobile devices have shown a positive relationship with an increase in teenagers' BMI and a lack of physical activity. Moreover, excessive internet usage has been linked to lower grades compared to users who do not spend an excessive amount of time online, even with a control over age, gender, race, parent education and personal contentment factors that may affect the study.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s11920-014-0472-x|pmid = 25070673|title = Adolescents and the Internet: What Mental Health Clinicians Need to Know|journal = Current Psychiatry Reports|volume = 16|issue = 9|pages = 472|year = 2014|last1 = Rafla|first1 = Malak|last2 = Carson|first2 = Nicholas J|last3 = Dejong|first3 = Sandra M}}</ref>  In a recent study, it was found that time spent on Facebook has a strong negative relationship with overall GPA.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Junco|first=Reynol|date=September 2011|title=Too Much Face and Not Enough Books|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563211001932|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=28|pages=|via=}}</ref> The use of multiple social media platforms is more strongly associated with depression and anxiety among young adults than time spent online.

With the introduction of social media platforms such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]], the hashtag was created to easily organize and search for information. Hashtags can be used when people want to advocate for a movement, store content or tweets from a movement for future use, and allow other social media users to contribute to a discussion about a certain movement by using existing hashtags.

There has always been a huge debate on the ownership of the content on social media platforms because it is generated by the users and hosted by the company. Added to this is the danger to security of information, which can be leaked to third parties with economic interests in the platform, or parasites who comb the data for their own databases.<ref name=Jones>{{cite web |url=http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/student-papers/fall05-papers/facebook.pdf |last1=Jones |first1=Harvey |last2=Soltren |first2=Jos\u00e9 Hiram |title=Facebook: Threats to Privacy |publisher=MIT Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence Lab |year= 2005 |accessdate=2018-04-04 }}</ref>\n\n===Privacy===\n[[Privacy concerns with social networking services|Privacy]] rights advocates warn users on social media about the collection of their personal data. Some information is captured without the user's knowledge or [[consent]] through electronic tracking and third party applications. Data may also be collected for law enforcement and governmental purposes,<ref name=Auer2001/> by [[social media intelligence]] using [[data mining]] techniques.<ref name=Jones/> Data and information may also be collected for third party use. When information is shared on social media, that information is no longer private. There have been many cases in which young persons especially, share personal information, which can attract predators. It is very important to monitor what you share, and to be aware of who you could potentially be sharing that information with. Teens especially share significantly more information on the internet now than they have in the past. Teens are much more likely to share their personal information, such as email address, phone number, and school names.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/05/21/teens-social-media-and-privacy/ |title=Teens, Social Media, and Privacy |last=Madden |first=Mary |display-authors=etal |date=May 21, 2013 |website=Pew Research Center: Internet, Science & Tech |access-date=2016-11-29 }}</ref> Studies suggest that teens are not aware of what they are posting and how much of that information can be accessed by third parties.\n\nThere are arguments that \"privacy is dead\" and that with social media growing more and more, some heavy social media users appear to have become quite unconcerned with privacy. Others argue, however, that people are still very concerned about their privacy, but are being ignored by the companies running these social networks, who can sometimes make a profit off of sharing someone's personal information. There is also a disconnect between social media user's words and their actions. Studies suggest that surveys show that people want to keep their lives private, but their actions on social media suggest otherwise. Another factor is ignorance of how accessible social media posts are. Some social media users who have been criticized for inappropriate comments stated that they did not realize that anyone outside their circle of friends would read their post; in fact, on some social media sites, unless a user selects higher privacy settings, their content is shared with a wide audience.\n\nAccording to a 2016 article diving into the topic of sharing privately and the effect social media has on expectations of privacy, \"1.18 billion people will log into their [[Facebook]] accounts, 500 million tweets will be sent, and there will be 95 million photos and videos posted on [[Instagram]]\" in a day. Much of the privacy concerns individuals face stem from their own posts on a form of social network. Users have the choice to share voluntarily, and has been ingrained into society as routine and normative. Social media is a snapshot of our lives; a community we have created on the behaviors of sharing, posting, liking, and communicating. Sharing has become a phenomenon which social media and networks have uprooted and introduced to the world.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/sunday-review/we-want-privacy-but-cant-stop-sharing.html|title=We Want Privacy, but Can't Stop Sharing|last=Murphy|first=Kate|date=October 4, 2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=}}</ref> The idea of privacy is redundant; once something is posted, its accessibility remains constant even if we select who is potentially able to view it.

As result, cell phones have been banned from some classrooms, and some schools have blocked many popular social media websites. Many schools have realized that they need to loosen restrictions, teach digital citizenship skills, and even incorporate these tools into classrooms. Some schools permit students to use [[smartphone]]s or [[tablet computer]]s in class, as long as the students are using these devices for academic purposes, such as doing research. Using Facebook in class allows for integration of multimodal content such as student-created photographs and video and URLs to other texts, in a platform that many students are already familiar with. Twitter can be used to enhance communication building and critical thinking and it provides students with an informal \"[[back channel]]\"), and extend discussion outside of class time.\n\n===Censorship by governments===\n{{Main|Internet censorship}}\n[[File:Thai-coup-detat-2014-social-media-banner.jpg|thumb|Banner in [[Bangkok]], observed on June 30, 2014, informing the Thai public that 'like' or 'share' activity on social media may land them in jail]]\n\nSocial media often features in political struggles to control public perception and online activity.

Rather than \"deplatforming\", such standards would allow a more scalable, and customizable approach to content moderation and censorship, and involve a number of companies, in the way that e-mail servers work.\n\n===Self-censorship by social media platforms===\n{{Main|Deplatforming|Twitter suspensions}}\n[[Deplatforming]] is a form of Internet censorship in which controversial speakers or speech are suspended, banned, or otherwise shut down by social media platforms and other service providers that normally provide a venue for free expression.<ref name=Reynolds/> As early as 2015, platforms such as [[Reddit]] began to enforce selective bans based, for example, on [[terms of service]] that prohibit \"[[hate speech]]\".<ref name=ACM>{{cite journal |title=You Can't Stay Here: The Efficacy of Reddit's 2015 Ban Examined Through Hate Speech |first1=Eshwar |last1=Chandrasekharan |first2=Umashanti |last2=Pavalanathan |display-authors=etal |journal=Proc.

How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and Facebook,\u201d the media plays a large role in shaping people's perceptions of specific social networking sites. When looking at the site [[Myspace|MySpace]], after adults started to realize how popular the sight was becoming with teens, news media became heavily concerned with teen participation and the potential dangers they faced using the site. As a result, teens avoided joining the site because of the associated risks (e.g. child predators and lack of control) and parents began to publicly denounce the site. Ultimately, the site was labeled as dangerous, and many were detracted from interacting with the site. As boyd also describes, when [[Facebook]] initially launched in 2004, it solely targeted college students and access was intentionally limited. Facebook started as a [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-only social networking site before expanding to all other [[Ivy League]] schools. It then made its way to other top universities and ultimately to a wider range of schools. Because of its origins, some saw Facebook as an \u201celite\u201d social networking site. While it was very open and accepting to some, it seemed to outlaw and shun out most others who didn't fit that \u201celite\u201d categorization. These narratives propagated by the media influenced the large movement of teenage users from one social networking site to another.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Race After the Internet|last=boyd|first=danah|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=|editor-last=Nakamura|editor-first=Lisa|location=|pages=203\u2013222|chapter=White Flight in Networked Publics?

When fully grown, according to the American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standard, it stands from {{convert|19|to|23|in|cm}} tall. Both the AKC and [[The Kennel Club]] in the UK allow height up to {{convert|24|in|cm}} but that is not ideal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/dalmatian/ |title=American Kennel Club \u2013 Dalmatian |publisher=Akc.org |access-date=26 October 2011}}</ref> The outline of the dog should be square when viewed from the side: the body is as long from fore-chest to buttocks as it is tall at the withers, the shoulders are well laid back, the stifle is well bent and the hocks are well let down. The Dalmatian's feet are round with well-arched toes, and the nails are usually white or the same color as the dog's spots. The thin ears taper towards the tip and are set fairly high and close to the head. Eye color varies between brown, amber, purple, and blue, with some dogs having one blue eye and one brown eye, or other combinations.<ref name=\"Thornton, Kim Campbell 2004\">Thornton, Kim Campbell. \"THE DALMATIAN\". ''Dog World'' 89.11 (2004): 24.</ref> {{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n=== Coat ===\nDalmatian puppies are born with plain white coats and their first spots usually appear within 10 days; however, spots are visible on their skin from birth. They continue to develop until the dog is around 18 months old. Spots usually range in size from 20 to 60&nbsp;mm (1.25 to 2.5 in), and are most commonly black or liver on a white background. Liver is the recessive color in dalmatians, meaning that both parents have to \u201ccarry\u201d liver in order to produce liver pups. If both parents are liver, then all puppies will be liver spotted.\n\nOther, more rare colors, include blue (a blue-grayish color), brindle, mosaic, tricolored (with tan spotting on the eyebrows, cheeks, legs, and chest), and orange or lemon (dark to pale yellow). Patches of color may appear anywhere on the body, mostly on the head or ears, and usually consist of a solid color.  Patches are visible at birth and are not a group of connected spots; they are identifiable by the smooth edge of the patch.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breed Faults|url=http://www.dalmatians.info/breed-faults-dalmatian-dog/}}</ref> \n\nThe Dalmatian coat is usually short, fine, and dense; however, smooth-coated Dalmatians occasionally produce long-coated offspring. Long-coated Dalmatians are not acceptable in the breed standard, but these individuals experience much less shedding than their smooth-coated counterparts, which shed considerably year-round. The standard variety's short, stiff hairs often weave into carpet, clothing, upholstery, and nearly any other kind of fabric and can be difficult to remove. Weekly grooming with a hound mitt or curry can lessen the amount of hair Dalmatians shed, although nothing can completely prevent shedding. Due to the minimal amount of oil in their coats, Dalmatians lack a [[dog odor]] (\"dog smell\") and stay fairly clean relative to many other dog breeds.<ref name=\"Thornton, Kim Campbell 2004\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/dalmatian/#standard |title=American Kennel Club \u2013 Dalmatian |publisher=Akc.org |access-date=26 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Litter size ===\nDalmatians usually have litters of six to nine pups,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dalmatian Club of America Health Survey Results: General Dog Information|url=http://www.thedca.org/gendog.html|publisher=The Dalmatian Club of America|access-date=25 July 2012}}</ref>  but larger litters of up to 15 puppies are common.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Weisse welpen.jpg|Newborn Dalmatian puppies\nFile:Dalmatian puppy, three weeks-3.JPG|Dalmatian puppies, three weeks old, spots beginning to develop\nFile:Chienne dalmatienne allaitant 6 chiots dalmatiens.jpg|Puppies, four-five weeks old\nFile:Dalmatian puppy.JPG|A three-month-old Dalmatian\n</gallery>\n\n== Health ==\n[[File:Blauauge.jpg|thumb|200px|Blue and brown-eyed Dalmatian]]\n\nLike other breeds, Dalmatians display a propensity towards certain health problems specific to their breed, such as deafness, allergies and urinary stones. Reputable breeders have their puppies BAER (Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response) tested to ensure the status of the hearing on their pups. The Dalmatian Club of America lists the average lifespan of a Dalmatian at between 11 and 13 years, although some can live as long as 15 to 16 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedca.org/redbook.html#QA1|title=The Red Book: The Dalmatian Club Of America\u2019s Informational brochure regarding Dalmatians|publisher=The Dalmatian Club Of America|access-date=20 April 2011}}</ref> Breed health surveys in the US and the UK show an average lifespan of 9.9 and 11.55 years, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedca.org/healthcon.html|title= The Dalmatian Club of America Health Survey Results: Health Related Conditions |publisher= The Dalmatian Club of America|access-date=20 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Summary results for the purebred dog health survey for Dalmatians |publisher=The Kennel Club |url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/media/16394/dalmatian.pdf |access-date=19 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423092902/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/media/16394/dalmatian.pdf |archivedate=23 April 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> In their late teens, both males and females may suffer [[bone spurs]] and [[arthritis|arthritic conditions]].

Deafness was not recognized by early breeders, so the breed was thought to be unintelligent. Many breeders, when hearing testing started to become the norm, were amazed to discover that they had uni hearing dogs. Even after recognizing the problem as a genetic fault, breeders did not understand the dogs' nature, and deafness in Dalmatians continues to be a frequent problem.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} \n\nResearchers now know deafness in albino and [[piebald]] animals is caused by the absence of mature [[melanocytes]] in the inner ear.<ref name=Proctor>{{Cite book|author=Proctor PH |chapter=Free Radicals and Human Disease|veditors=Weber HH, Miquel J, Quintanilha AT |title=Handbook of free radicals and antioxidants in biomedicine |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |year=1988 |pages=209\u201321 |isbn=978-0-8493-3268-5 |volume=1 |url=http://www.doctorproctor.com/crcpap2.htm}}</ref> This may affect one or both ears. The condition is also common in other canine breeds that share a genetic propensity for light pigmentation. This includes, but is not limited to [[Bull Terrier]]s, [[Dogo Argentino]]s, [[Poodle]]s, [[Boxer (dog)|Boxers]], [[Border Collie]]s and [[Great Dane]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nTypically, only dogs with bilateral hearing are bred, although those with unilateral hearing, and even dogs with bilateral [[deafness]], make fine pets with appropriate training.<ref name=\"Thornton, Kim Campbell 2004\"/> The main difference you will notice in a dog with uni hearing is that they do not have directional hearing. They can hear you, just not which direction you are in. The Dalmatian Club of America's position on deaf pups is that they should not be used for breeding, and that humane euthanasia may be considered as an \"alternative to placement\". The British Dalmatian Club recommends only purchasing pups who are [[Brainstem auditory evoked potential|BAER tested]], and requests all members provide BAER testing results of their puppies so that the true deafness statistics can be looked at.\n\nIt has been proved that it is the inheritance of the extreme piebald gene that causes the blue eyes. It is therefore frowned upon to breed from blue eyed Dalmatians even if they are fully hearing. Blue eyed Dalmatians are not typically shown in the UK.\n\n=== Hip Dysplasia ===\n[[Hip dysplasia (canine)|Hip dysplasia]] is another disease that affects nearly 5% of purebred Dalmatians,<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://dalmatianadvice.com/common-dalmatian-health-problems/|title=Common Dalmatian Health Problems|access-date=20 January 2018|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150204104810/http://dalmatianadvice.com/common-dalmatian-health-problems/| archivedate = 4 February 2015}} </ref> causing those to experience limping, fatigue, moderate to severe pain, and trouble standing up. Most Dalmatians who eventually develop hip dysplasia are born with normal hips, but the soft tissues surrounding the joint grow abnormally due to their genetic make-up. The disease may affect both hips, or only the right or left hip, leading afflicted dogs to walk or run with an altered gait.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dogshealth.com/blog/hip-dysplasia-in-dalmatians/|title=Hip Dysplasia in Dalmatians \u2013 Dog'sHealth.com Blog|website=Dogshealth.com|access-date=2 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Hyperuricemia ===\n[[File:Female dalmatian head shot.jpg|thumb|Dalmatian portrait]]\nDalmatians, like [[human]]s, can suffer from [[hyperuricemia]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Friedamman |first=M |author2=S.O Byers |date=1 September 1948|title=Observations concerning the causes of the excess excretion of uric acid in the dalmatian dog |journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume=175 |issue=2 |pages=727\u201335 |url=http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/175/2/727 |pmid=18880769 }}</ref> Dalmatians' livers have trouble breaking down [[uric acid]], which can build up in the [[blood serum]] ([[hyperuricemia]]) causing [[gout]].

Therefore, there is no possibility of eliminating hyperuricemia among pure-bred Dalmatians. The only possible solution to this problem must then be crossing Dalmatians with other breeds to reintroduce the \"normal\" uric acid transporter gene. This led to the foundation of the Dalmatian-Pointer Backcross Project, which aims to reintroduce the normal uric acid transporter gene into the Dalmatian breed. The backcross used a single [[Pointer (dog breed)|English Pointer]]; subsequent breedings have all been to purebred Dalmatians. This project was started in 1973 by Dr. Robert Schaible. The first cross (F1) hybrids did not resemble Dalmatians very closely. The F1s were then crossed back to purebreds. This breeding produced puppies of closer resemblance to the pure Dalmatian. By the fifth generation in 1981, they resembled purebreds so much, Dr. Schaible convinced the AKC to allow two of the hybrids to be registered as purebreds. Then AKC President William F. Stifel stated, \"If there is a logical, scientific way to correct genetic health problems associated with certain breed traits and still preserve the integrity of the breed standard, it is incumbent upon the American Kennel Club to lead the way.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dalmatianheritage.com/about/schaible_research.htm|title=A Dalmatian Study: The Genetic Correction of Health Problems|last=Schaible|first=Robert H.|date=April 1981|publisher=The AKC Gazette|access-date=13 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311011321/http://www.dalmatianheritage.com/about/schaible_research.htm|archive-date=11 March 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Dalmatian Club of America's (DCA) board of directors supported this decision, however it quickly became highly controversial among the club members.

Dalmatian Dog.JPG|thumb|200px|left|A Dalmatian, published in 1859]]\n\nThe roles of this breed are as varied as their reputed ancestors. They were used as [[Dogs in warfare|dogs of war]], guarding the borders of Dalmatia. To this day, the breed retains a high guarding instinct; although friendly and loyal to those the dog knows and trusts, it is often aloof with strangers and unknown dogs. Dalmatians have a strong hunting instinct and are an excellent exterminator of rats and vermin. In sporting, they have been used as bird dogs, trail hounds, retrievers, or in packs for wild boar or stag hunting. Their dramatic markings and intelligence have made them successful circus dogs throughout the years.\n\nDalmatians are perhaps best known for working for the [[firefighter]]s for their role as [[firefighting apparatus]] escorts and firehouse mascots. Since Dalmatians and horses are very compatible, the dogs were easily trained to run in front of the carriages to help clear a path and quickly guide the horses and firefighters to the fires.<ref name=\"Windsor\"/>\n\nDalmatians are often considered to make good watchdogs, and they may have been useful to [[Fire department|fire brigade]]s as [[guard dog]]s to protect a firehouse and its equipment. Fire engines used to be drawn by fast and powerful horses, a tempting target for thieves, so Dalmatians were kept in the firehouse as deterrence to theft.<ref name=\"Windsor\">{{cite web |title=Fire buffs traditions |url=http://www.windsorfire.com/fire-buffs-traditions-dalmations |publisher=Windsor Fire |access-date=20 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730032526/http://www.windsorfire.com/fire-buffs-traditions-dalmations |archive-date=30 July 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[File:Old fire engine and dalmatian.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Dalmatian in a fire service parade]]\n\n=== Firefighting ===\nDalmatians are associated with [[firefighting]], particularly in the United States.

The Dalmatian's feet are round with well-arched toes, and the nails are usually white or the same color as the dog's spots. The thin ears taper towards the tip and are set fairly high and close to the head. Eye color varies between brown, amber, purple, and blue, with some dogs having one blue eye and one brown eye, or other combinations.<ref name=\"Thornton, Kim Campbell 2004\">Thornton, Kim Campbell. \"THE DALMATIAN\". ''Dog World'' 89.11 (2004): 24.</ref> {{cn|date=June 2019}}\n\n=== Coat ===\nDalmatian puppies are born with plain white coats and their first spots usually appear within 10 days; however, spots are visible on their skin from birth. They continue to develop until the dog is around 18 months old. Spots usually range in size from 20 to 60&nbsp;mm (1.25 to 2.5 in), and are most commonly black or liver on a white background. Liver is the recessive color in dalmatians, meaning that both parents have to \u201ccarry\u201d liver in order to produce liver pups. If both parents are liver, then all puppies will be liver spotted.\n\nOther, more rare colors, include blue (a blue-grayish color), brindle, mosaic, tricolored (with tan spotting on the eyebrows, cheeks, legs, and chest), and orange or lemon (dark to pale yellow). Patches of color may appear anywhere on the body, mostly on the head or ears, and usually consist of a solid color.  Patches are visible at birth and are not a group of connected spots; they are identifiable by the smooth edge of the patch.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breed Faults|url=http://www.dalmatians.info/breed-faults-dalmatian-dog/}}</ref> \n\nThe Dalmatian coat is usually short, fine, and dense; however, smooth-coated Dalmatians occasionally produce long-coated offspring. Long-coated Dalmatians are not acceptable in the breed standard, but these individuals experience much less shedding than their smooth-coated counterparts, which shed considerably year-round. The standard variety's short, stiff hairs often weave into carpet, clothing, upholstery, and nearly any other kind of fabric and can be difficult to remove. Weekly grooming with a hound mitt or curry can lessen the amount of hair Dalmatians shed, although nothing can completely prevent shedding. Due to the minimal amount of oil in their coats, Dalmatians lack a [[dog odor]] (\"dog smell\") and stay fairly clean relative to many other dog breeds.<ref name=\"Thornton, Kim Campbell 2004\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/dalmatian/#standard |title=American Kennel Club \u2013 Dalmatian |publisher=Akc.org |access-date=26 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Litter size ===\nDalmatians usually have litters of six to nine pups,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Dalmatian Club of America Health Survey Results: General Dog Information|url=http://www.thedca.org/gendog.html|publisher=The Dalmatian Club of America|access-date=25 July 2012}}</ref>  but larger litters of up to 15 puppies are common.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Weisse welpen.jpg|Newborn Dalmatian puppies\nFile:Dalmatian puppy, three weeks-3.JPG|Dalmatian puppies, three weeks old, spots beginning to develop\nFile:Chienne dalmatienne allaitant 6 chiots dalmatiens.jpg|Puppies, four-five weeks old\nFile:Dalmatian puppy.JPG|A three-month-old Dalmatian\n</gallery>\n\n== Health ==\n[[File:Blauauge.jpg|thumb|200px|Blue and brown-eyed Dalmatian]]\n\nLike other breeds, Dalmatians display a propensity towards certain health problems specific to their breed, such as deafness, allergies and urinary stones. Reputable breeders have their puppies BAER (Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response) tested to ensure the status of the hearing on their pups. The Dalmatian Club of America lists the average lifespan of a Dalmatian at between 11 and 13 years, although some can live as long as 15 to 16 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedca.org/redbook.html#QA1|title=The Red Book: The Dalmatian Club Of America\u2019s Informational brochure regarding Dalmatians|publisher=The Dalmatian Club Of America|access-date=20 April 2011}}</ref> Breed health surveys in the US and the UK show an average lifespan of 9.9 and 11.55 years, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedca.org/healthcon.html|title= The Dalmatian Club of America Health Survey Results: Health Related Conditions |publisher= The Dalmatian Club of America|access-date=20 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Summary results for the purebred dog health survey for Dalmatians |publisher=The Kennel Club |url=http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/media/16394/dalmatian.pdf |access-date=19 September 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423092902/http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/media/16394/dalmatian.pdf |archivedate=23 April 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> In their late teens, both males and females may suffer [[bone spurs]] and [[arthritis|arthritic conditions]].

Deafness was not recognized by early breeders, so the breed was thought to be unintelligent. Many breeders, when hearing testing started to become the norm, were amazed to discover that they had uni hearing dogs. Even after recognizing the problem as a genetic fault, breeders did not understand the dogs' nature, and deafness in Dalmatians continues to be a frequent problem.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} \n\nResearchers now know deafness in albino and [[piebald]] animals is caused by the absence of mature [[melanocytes]] in the inner ear.<ref name=Proctor>{{Cite book|author=Proctor PH |chapter=Free Radicals and Human Disease|veditors=Weber HH, Miquel J, Quintanilha AT |title=Handbook of free radicals and antioxidants in biomedicine |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |year=1988 |pages=209\u201321 |isbn=978-0-8493-3268-5 |volume=1 |url=http://www.doctorproctor.com/crcpap2.htm}}</ref> This may affect one or both ears. The condition is also common in other canine breeds that share a genetic propensity for light pigmentation. This includes, but is not limited to [[Bull Terrier]]s, [[Dogo Argentino]]s, [[Poodle]]s, [[Boxer (dog)|Boxers]], [[Border Collie]]s and [[Great Dane]]s.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nTypically, only dogs with bilateral hearing are bred, although those with unilateral hearing, and even dogs with bilateral [[deafness]], make fine pets with appropriate training.<ref name=\"Thornton, Kim Campbell 2004\"/> The main difference you will notice in a dog with uni hearing is that they do not have directional hearing. They can hear you, just not which direction you are in. The Dalmatian Club of America's position on deaf pups is that they should not be used for breeding, and that humane euthanasia may be considered as an \"alternative to placement\".

Therefore, there is no possibility of eliminating hyperuricemia among pure-bred Dalmatians. The only possible solution to this problem must then be crossing Dalmatians with other breeds to reintroduce the \"normal\" uric acid transporter gene. This led to the foundation of the Dalmatian-Pointer Backcross Project, which aims to reintroduce the normal uric acid transporter gene into the Dalmatian breed. The backcross used a single [[Pointer (dog breed)|English Pointer]]; subsequent breedings have all been to purebred Dalmatians. This project was started in 1973 by Dr. Robert Schaible. The first cross (F1) hybrids did not resemble Dalmatians very closely. The F1s were then crossed back to purebreds. This breeding produced puppies of closer resemblance to the pure Dalmatian. By the fifth generation in 1981, they resembled purebreds so much, Dr. Schaible convinced the AKC to allow two of the hybrids to be registered as purebreds. Then AKC President William F. Stifel stated, \"If there is a logical, scientific way to correct genetic health problems associated with certain breed traits and still preserve the integrity of the breed standard, it is incumbent upon the American Kennel Club to lead the way.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dalmatianheritage.com/about/schaible_research.htm|title=A Dalmatian Study: The Genetic Correction of Health Problems|last=Schaible|first=Robert H.|date=April 1981|publisher=The AKC Gazette|access-date=13 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130311011321/http://www.dalmatianheritage.com/about/schaible_research.htm|archive-date=11 March 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Dalmatian Club of America's (DCA) board of directors supported this decision, however it quickly became highly controversial among the club members.

They were used as [[Dogs in warfare|dogs of war]], guarding the borders of Dalmatia. To this day, the breed retains a high guarding instinct; although friendly and loyal to those the dog knows and trusts, it is often aloof with strangers and unknown dogs. Dalmatians have a strong hunting instinct and are an excellent exterminator of rats and vermin. In sporting, they have been used as bird dogs, trail hounds, retrievers, or in packs for wild boar or stag hunting. Their dramatic markings and intelligence have made them successful circus dogs throughout the years.\n\nDalmatians are perhaps best known for working for the [[firefighter]]s for their role as [[firefighting apparatus]] escorts and firehouse mascots. Since Dalmatians and horses are very compatible, the dogs were easily trained to run in front of the carriages to help clear a path and quickly guide the horses and firefighters to the fires.<ref name=\"Windsor\"/>\n\nDalmatians are often considered to make good watchdogs, and they may have been useful to [[Fire department|fire brigade]]s as [[guard dog]]s to protect a firehouse and its equipment.

The trustees of the struggling college then decided to seek a locale whose economic and transportation advantages could provide a better base of support.\n\n[[File:Henry Jarvis Raymond.jpg|thumb|left|A graduate of the Genesee Seminary, [[Henry Jarvis Raymond]] later went on to found ''[[The New York Times]]''.|329x329px]] [[File:Syracuse-university 1908 winter.jpg|left|thumb|264x264px|Left to right: [[Hall of Languages, Syracuse University|Hall of Languages]] and Von Ranke Library<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.syr.edu/skin/?url=http://archives.syr.edu/buildings/tolley.html|title=University Archives {{!}} Syracuse University Libraries|website=library.syr.edu|access-date=September 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180924224919/https://library.syr.edu/skin/?url=http%3A%2F%2Farchives.syr.edu%2Fbuildings%2Ftolley.html|archive-date=September 24, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Syracuse-university bowne-hall.jpg|left|thumb|262x262px|From left to right: Bowne Hall,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.syr.edu/skin/?url=http://archives.syr.edu/buildings/bowne.html|title=University Archives {{!}} Syracuse University Libraries|website=library.syr.edu|access-date=September 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180924224926/https://library.syr.edu/skin/?url=http%3A%2F%2Farchives.syr.edu%2Fbuildings%2Fbowne.html|archive-date=September 24, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Carnegie Library,<ref name=\"library.syr.edu\">{{Cite web|url=https://library.syr.edu/skin/?url=http://archives.syr.edu/buildings/carnegie.html|title=University Archives {{!}} Syracuse University Libraries|website=library.syr.edu|access-date=September 24, 2018}}</ref> Archbold Gymnasium<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.syr.edu/skin/?url=http://archives.syr.edu/buildings/archbold.html|title=University Archives {{!}} Syracuse University Libraries|website=library.syr.edu|access-date=September 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180924224852/https://library.syr.edu/skin/?url=http%3A%2F%2Farchives.syr.edu%2Fbuildings%2Farchbold.html|archive-date=September 24, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>]] [[File:Syracuse-university 1920 quad.jpg|left|thumb|263x263px|The Old Row, campus of Syracuse University, 1920]]\nThe college began looking for a new home at the same time Syracuse, ninety miles to the east, was engaged in a search to bring a university to the city, having failed to convince [[Ezra Cornell]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]] to locate [[Cornell University]] there rather than in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]].<ref name=\"PioneerYears\" /><ref name=\"Greene\" /> Syracuse resident White pressed that the new university should locate on the hill in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] (the current location of Syracuse University) due to the city's attractive transportation hub, which would ease the recruitment of faculty, students, and other persons of note. However, as a young carpenter working in Syracuse, Cornell had been twice robbed of his wages,<ref name=\"reminiscences\" /><ref name=\"university\" /> and thereafter considered Syracuse a [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], insisting the university be in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] on his large farm on East Hill, overlooking the town and [[Cayuga Lake]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:GeneseeWesleyanSeminary.png|thumb|right|Genesee Wesleyan Seminary]]\n[[File:BelvaLockwood-engraving.jpg|thumb|right|[[Belva Lockwood]] was the second woman, (after [[Victoria Woodhull]]), to run for President of the United States.]]\nMeanwhile, there were several years of dispute between the Methodist ministers, Lima, and contending cities across the state, over proposals to move Genesee College to Syracuse. At the time, the ministers wanted a share of the funds from the [[Morrill Land Grant Act]] for Genesee College. They agreed to a ''[[quid pro quo]]'' donation of $25,000 from Senator Cornell in exchange for their (Methodist) support for his bill. Cornell insisted the bargain be written into the bill and Cornell became New York State's Land Grant University in 1865.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} In 1869, Genesee College obtained New York State approval to move to Syracuse, but Lima got a court injunction to block the move, and Genesee stayed in Lima until it was dissolved in 1875.<ref name=\"found\" /> By that time, however, the court injunction had been made moot by the founding of a new university on March 24, 1870.

President Peck stated at the opening ceremonies, \"The conditions of admission shall be equal to all persons... there shall be no invidious discrimination here against woman.... brains and heart shall have a fair chance... \"<ref name=\"coed\" /> Syracuse implemented this policy with a high proportion of women students. In the College of Liberal Arts, the ratio between male and female students during the 19th century was approximately even. The College of Fine Arts was predominantly female, and a low ratio of women enrolled in the College of Medicine and the College of Law.<ref name=\"coed\" /> Men and women were taught together in the same courses, and many extra-curricular activities were coeducational as well. Syracuse also developed \"women-only\" organizations and clubs.<ref name=\"coed\" />\n\n===Expansion===\nCoeducation at Syracuse traced its roots to the early days of Genesee College where educators and students like [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]] and [[Belva Lockwood]] were heavily influenced by the Women's movement in nearby [[Seneca Falls, New York|Seneca Falls, NY]]. However, the progressive \"co-ed\" policies practiced at Genesee would soon find controversy at the new university in Syracuse.<ref name=\"Greene\" /> Colleges and universities admitted few women students in the 1870s. Administrators and faculty argued women had inferior minds and could not master mathematics and the classics. Dr. [[Erastus Otis Haven]], Syracuse University chancellor and former president of the [[University of Michigan]] and [[Northwestern University]], maintained that women should receive the advantages of higher education. He enrolled his daughter, Frances, at Syracuse where she joined the other newly admitted female students in founding the [[Gamma Phi Beta]] sorority.<ref name=\"Greene\" /> The inclusion of women in the early days of the university led to the proliferation of various women's clubs and societies. In fact, it was a Syracuse professor who coined the term \"sorority\" specifically for [[Gamma Phi Beta]].\n\nIn the late 1880s the university engaged in a rapid building spree.

Newhouse School of Public Communications]], was established at Syracuse in 1934.<ref name=\"SU1931\" />\n\nThe growth of Syracuse University from a small liberal arts college into a major comprehensive university were due to the efforts of two men, Chancellor [[James Roscoe Day|James Day]] and [[John Dustin Archbold|John D. Archbold]]. James Roscoe Day was serving the Calvary Church in New York City where he befriended Archbold. Together, the two dynamic figures would oversee the first of two great periods of campus renewal in Syracuse's history.<ref name=\"Greene\" />\n\nJohn Dustin Archbold was a capitalist, philanthropist, and President of the Board of Trustees at Syracuse University. He was known as John D. Rockefeller's right-hand man and successor at the [[Standard Oil]] Company. He was a close friend of Syracuse University Chancellor James R. Day, and gave almost $6&nbsp;million to the university over his lifetime.<ref name=\"Greene\" /> Said a journalist in 1917:\n<blockquote>Mr. Archbold's ... is the president of the board of trustees of Syracuse University, an institution which has prospered so remarkably since his connection with it that its student roll has increased from hundreds to over 4,000, including 1,500 young women, placing it in the ranks of the foremost institutions of learning in the United States.<ref name=\"Men who are making America\" /></blockquote>In 1905 Rev. Dr. James D. Phelps secured a donation of $150,000 from [[Andrew Carnegie]] for a new university library provided the University raised an equal sum as an endowment for the library. The University raised the required endowment in little over a month with the largest share being contributed by [[John Dustin Archbold|John D. Archbold]].

Archbold also contributed funds for eight buildings, including the full cost of [[Archbold Stadium]] (opened 1907, demolished 1978), Sims Hall<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.syr.edu/skin/?url=http://archives.syr.edu/buildings/sims.html|title=University Archives {{!}} Syracuse University Libraries|website=library.syr.edu|access-date=September 24, 2018}}</ref> (men's dormitory, 1907), the [[Archbold Gymnasium]] (1909, nearly destroyed by fire in 1947, but still in use), and the oval athletic field.\n\n===Modern===\nAfter [[World War II]], Syracuse University began to transform into a major research institution. Enrollment increased in the four years after the war due to the [[G.I. Bill]], which paid tuition, room, board, and a small allowance for veterans returning from World War II. In 1946, SU admitted 9,464 freshmen, nearly four times greater than the previous incoming class.<ref name=\"SU1931\"/> Branch campuses were established in [[Endicott, New York]], and [[Utica, New York]], which became [[Binghamton University]] and [[Utica College]] respectfully.\n\nThe velocity with which the university sped through its change into a major research institution was astounding. By the end of the 1950s, Syracuse ranked twelfth nationally in terms of the amount of its sponsored research, and it had over four hundred professors and graduate students engaging in that investigation.<ref name=\"Greene2\" />\n\nFrom the early 1950s through the 1960s, Syracuse University added programs and staff that continued the transformation of the school into a research university. In 1954, Arthur Phillips was recruited from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and started the first [[pathogen]]-free animal research laboratory. The lab focused on studying medical problems using animal models. The School of Social Work, which eventually merged into the College of Human Ecology, was founded in 1956.<ref name=\"Syracuse University History, 1951\u20131960\"/> Syracuse's College of Engineering also founded the nation's second oldest computer engineering and bioengineering programs. In 1962, [[Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr.]] donated $15&nbsp;million to begin construction of a school of communications, eventually known as the [[SI Newhouse School of Public Communications]]. In 1966, Syracuse University was admitted to the [[Association of American Universities]], an organization of leading research universities devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic research and education.<ref name=\"Syracuse University History, 1961\u20131970\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:80%; width:90%; border:0; text-align:center; line-height:120%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=12|Schools and colleges of Syracuse University (date of founding)\n|-\n!Undergraduate\n|colspan=2|[[Syracuse University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]]<br />1870\n|University College<br />1918\n|rowspan=2|College of Visual and Performing Arts<br />1873\n|rowspan=2|[[Syracuse University School of Architecture|School of Architecture]]<br />1873\n|rowspan=2|[[Syracuse University School of Information Studies|School of Information Studies]]<br />1896\n|rowspan=2|College of Engineering and Computer Science<br />1901\n|rowspan=2|[http://soe.syr.edu/ School of Education<br />1906]\n|rowspan=2|Falk College of Sport and Human Dynamic<br />1918\n|rowspan=2|[[Martin J.

Buses run to South Campus, as well as [[downtown Syracuse]] and other locations in the city.<ref name=\"Syracuse University Map\" /> About 70 percent of students live in university housing. First- and second-year students are required to live on campus. All 22 residence halls are coeducational and each contain a lounge, laundry facility, and various social/study spaces. Residence halls are secured with a card access system. Residence halls are located on both Main Campus and South Campus, the latter of which is a five-minute ride via bus. Learning communities and interest housing options are also available. Food facilities include six residential dining centers, two food courts, and several cafes.\n\nThe [[Comstock Tract Buildings]], a historic district of older buildings on the campus, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1980.<ref name=\"nrhptextComstock\"/> Three buildings on campus\u2014the [[Crouse College, Syracuse University|Crouse Memorial College]] and the [[Hall of Languages, Syracuse University|Hall of Languages]], and the [[Pi Chapter House of Psi Upsilon Fraternity]]\u2014are individually listed on the National Register.<ref name=nris/>\n\nA few blocks walk from Main Campus on East Genesee St, the [[Syracuse Stage]] building includes two [[proscenium]] theatres.

During the 1970s, this housing was replaced by permanent two-level townhouses for two or three students each, or for graduate family housing. There are also three small residence halls which feature open doubles. South Campus is also home to the Institute for Sensory Research, Tennity Ice Pavilion, Goldstein Student Center, Skytop Office Building and 621 Skytop Road (for administration), and the InnComplete Pub, a graduate student bar. Just north is the headquarters of SU Athletics, [[Manley Field House]], located in the Manley Athletics Complex.

They agreed to a ''[[quid pro quo]]'' donation of $25,000 from Senator Cornell in exchange for their (Methodist) support for his bill.

President Peck stated at the opening ceremonies, \"The conditions of admission shall be equal to all persons... there shall be no invidious discrimination here against woman.... brains and heart shall have a fair chance... \"<ref name=\"coed\" /> Syracuse implemented this policy with a high proportion of women students. In the College of Liberal Arts, the ratio between male and female students during the 19th century was approximately even. The College of Fine Arts was predominantly female, and a low ratio of women enrolled in the College of Medicine and the College of Law.<ref name=\"coed\" /> Men and women were taught together in the same courses, and many extra-curricular activities were coeducational as well. Syracuse also developed \"women-only\" organizations and clubs.<ref name=\"coed\" />\n\n===Expansion===\nCoeducation at Syracuse traced its roots to the early days of Genesee College where educators and students like [[Frances Willard (suffragist)|Frances Willard]] and [[Belva Lockwood]] were heavily influenced by the Women's movement in nearby [[Seneca Falls, New York|Seneca Falls, NY]]. However, the progressive \"co-ed\" policies practiced at Genesee would soon find controversy at the new university in Syracuse.<ref name=\"Greene\" /> Colleges and universities admitted few women students in the 1870s. Administrators and faculty argued women had inferior minds and could not master mathematics and the classics. Dr. [[Erastus Otis Haven]], Syracuse University chancellor and former president of the [[University of Michigan]] and [[Northwestern University]], maintained that women should receive the advantages of higher education. He enrolled his daughter, Frances, at Syracuse where she joined the other newly admitted female students in founding the [[Gamma Phi Beta]] sorority.<ref name=\"Greene\" /> The inclusion of women in the early days of the university led to the proliferation of various women's clubs and societies. In fact, it was a Syracuse professor who coined the term \"sorority\" specifically for [[Gamma Phi Beta]].\n\nIn the late 1880s the university engaged in a rapid building spree.

Together, the two dynamic figures would oversee the first of two great periods of campus renewal in Syracuse's history.<ref name=\"Greene\" />\n\nJohn Dustin Archbold was a capitalist, philanthropist, and President of the Board of Trustees at Syracuse University. He was known as John D. Rockefeller's right-hand man and successor at the [[Standard Oil]] Company. He was a close friend of Syracuse University Chancellor James R. Day, and gave almost $6&nbsp;million to the university over his lifetime.<ref name=\"Greene\" /> Said a journalist in 1917:\n<blockquote>Mr. Archbold's ... is the president of the board of trustees of Syracuse University, an institution which has prospered so remarkably since his connection with it that its student roll has increased from hundreds to over 4,000, including 1,500 young women, placing it in the ranks of the foremost institutions of learning in the United States.<ref name=\"Men who are making America\" /></blockquote>In 1905 Rev. Dr. James D. Phelps secured a donation of $150,000 from [[Andrew Carnegie]] for a new university library provided the University raised an equal sum as an endowment for the library. The University raised the required endowment in little over a month with the largest share being contributed by [[John Dustin Archbold|John D. Archbold]].

Archbold also contributed funds for eight buildings, including the full cost of [[Archbold Stadium]] (opened 1907, demolished 1978), Sims Hall<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.syr.edu/skin/?url=http://archives.syr.edu/buildings/sims.html|title=University Archives {{!}} Syracuse University Libraries|website=library.syr.edu|access-date=September 24, 2018}}</ref> (men's dormitory, 1907), the [[Archbold Gymnasium]] (1909, nearly destroyed by fire in 1947, but still in use), and the oval athletic field.\n\n===Modern===\nAfter [[World War II]], Syracuse University began to transform into a major research institution. Enrollment increased in the four years after the war due to the [[G.I. Bill]], which paid tuition, room, board, and a small allowance for veterans returning from World War II. In 1946, SU admitted 9,464 freshmen, nearly four times greater than the previous incoming class.<ref name=\"SU1931\"/> Branch campuses were established in [[Endicott, New York]], and [[Utica, New York]], which became [[Binghamton University]] and [[Utica College]] respectfully.\n\nThe velocity with which the university sped through its change into a major research institution was astounding. By the end of the 1950s, Syracuse ranked twelfth nationally in terms of the amount of its sponsored research, and it had over four hundred professors and graduate students engaging in that investigation.<ref name=\"Greene2\" />\n\nFrom the early 1950s through the 1960s, Syracuse University added programs and staff that continued the transformation of the school into a research university. In 1954, Arthur Phillips was recruited from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and started the first [[pathogen]]-free animal research laboratory. The lab focused on studying medical problems using animal models. The School of Social Work, which eventually merged into the College of Human Ecology, was founded in 1956.<ref name=\"Syracuse University History, 1951\u20131960\"/> Syracuse's College of Engineering also founded the nation's second oldest computer engineering and bioengineering programs. In 1962, [[Samuel Irving Newhouse Sr.]] donated $15&nbsp;million to begin construction of a school of communications, eventually known as the [[SI Newhouse School of Public Communications]]. In 1966, Syracuse University was admitted to the [[Association of American Universities]], an organization of leading research universities devoted to maintaining a strong system of academic research and education.<ref name=\"Syracuse University History, 1961\u20131970\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:80%; width:90%; border:0; text-align:center; line-height:120%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=12|Schools and colleges of Syracuse University (date of founding)\n|-\n!Undergraduate\n|colspan=2|[[Syracuse University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]]<br />1870\n|University College<br />1918\n|rowspan=2|College of Visual and Performing Arts<br />1873\n|rowspan=2|[[Syracuse University School of Architecture|School of Architecture]]<br />1873\n|rowspan=2|[[Syracuse University School of Information Studies|School of Information Studies]]<br />1896\n|rowspan=2|College of Engineering and Computer Science<br />1901\n|rowspan=2|[http://soe.syr.edu/ School of Education<br />1906]\n|rowspan=2|Falk College of Sport and Human Dynamic<br />1918\n|rowspan=2|[[Martin J.

ESF was founded in 1911 as the [[History of the New York State College of Forestry|New York State College of Forestry]] at Syracuse University, under the leadership of Syracuse University Trustee [[Louis Marshall]], with the active support of Syracuse University Chancellor Day. Its founding followed the Governor's veto of annual appropriations to a separate [[New York State College of Forestry at Cornell]].<ref name=\"agriculture\"/>\n\nESF is an autonomous institution, administratively separate from SU, while resources, facilities, and some infrastructure are shared. The two schools share a common Schedule of Classes; students at both institutions may take courses at the other, and degrees from ESF bear the Syracuse University seal along with the State University of New York. A number of concurrent degree programs and certificates are offered between the schools, as well. The college receives an annual appropriation as part of the SUNY budget and the state builds and maintains all of the college's educational facilities. The state has similar relationships with five [[statutory college]]s that are at [[Alfred University]] and [[Cornell University]].\n\nESF faculty, students, and students' families join those from SU to take part in a joint convocation ceremony at the beginning of the academic year in August, and joint commencement exercises in May. ESF and SU students share access to libraries, recreational facilities, student clubs, and other activities at both institutions, except for the schools' intercollegiate sports teams, affiliated with the NCAA and [[United States Collegiate Athletic Association|USCAA]], respectively. First-year ESF students live in Centennial Hall on ESF's campus.<ref name=\"The ESF-SU Relationship\"/>\n\n====State University of New York Upstate Medical University====\n{{main|State University of New York Upstate Medical University}}\n\nThe medical school was formerly a college within SU, known as the Syracuse University Medical School. In 1950, SU sold the medical school to the [[State University of New York]] system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://library.syr.edu/digital/guides_sua/html/sua_medicine.htm|title=College of Medicine Records A description of its records at the Syracuse University Archives|website=library.syr.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> A joint [[Master of Public Health]] degree program<ref name=\"SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse University Offer Joint Master of Public Health Degree in Fall 2009\"/> and a joint PhD Program in [[Biomedical Engineering]] are offered by the two institutions. The campuses of the two universities are adjacent to each other on [[University Hill, Syracuse|University Hill]] in Syracuse.\n\n===Formerly affiliated institutions===\n====State University of New York at Binghamton====\n{{main|Binghamton University}}\n\nBinghamton University was established in 1946 as Triple Cities College, to serve the needs of local veterans of the [[Binghamton, New York]] area, who were returning from [[World War II]]. Established in [[Endicott, New York]], the college was a branch of Syracuse University. Triple Cities College offered local students the first two years of their education, while the following two were spent at Syracuse University. In 1946, students could earn their degrees entirely at the Binghamton campus. In 1950, it was absorbed by the [[State University of New York]] and renamed Harpur College.<ref name=\"About: History\"/>\n\n====Utica College====\n{{main|Utica College}}\n\n[[Utica College]], an independent private university located in [[Utica, New York]], was founded by Syracuse University in 1946. Utica College became independent from Syracuse in 1995, but still offers its students the option to receive a specialized bachelor's degree from Syracuse University through a mutual relationship between the two schools.<ref name=\"Fast Facts\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|New York (state)}}\n* [[Bernie Fine Sexual Abuse Allegations and Termination]]\n* ''[[Feiner v.
