''[[The New York Times]]'' attributed most the revenue to sales of supplements, including \"Super Male Vitality\" and \"Brain Force Plus\", which the site purported would increase [[testosterone]] and mental agility, respectively.<ref name=nyt-7-9-2018/> Court documents in 2014 indicate that ''InfoWars'' was successful enough for Jones and his then-wife to be planning to \"build a swimming pool complex ... featuring a waterfall and dining cabana with a stone fireplace\".

However, Ichimoku is also integrated by three other theories that improve and enhance the indicator:\n\n* Time Theory <ref>\"Ichimoku Time Theory\" section of the page {{cite web|url=http://www.ichimoku.com/ichimoku-time-theory/|title=Ichimoku TimeTheory|publisher=Ichimoku.com}}</ref>\n* Wave Movement Theory <ref>\"Ichimoku Wave Movement Theory\" section of the page {{cite web|url=http://www.ichimoku.com/part-3-ichimoku-wave-theory/|title=Ichimoku TimeTheory|publisher=Ichimoku.com}}</ref>\n* Target Price Theory <ref>\"Ichimoku Price Theory\" section of the page {{cite web|url=http://www.ichimoku.com/part-4-target-price-theory/|title=Ichimoku TimeTheory|publisher=Ichimoku.com}}</ref>\n\n==The key elements of Ichimoku's Graphic Environment==\n\n===Tenkan-sen===\nTenkan-sen ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u8ee2\u63db|\u8ee2\u63db]][[:wikt:\u7dda|\u7dda]]}}) calculation: (highest high + lowest low)/2 for the last 9 periods.\n\nIt is primarily used as a signal line and a minor support/resistance line. Tenkan Sen (red line): This is also known as the turning line and is derived by averaging the highest high and the lowest low for the past nine periods. ''The Tenkan Sen is an indicator of the market trend. If the red line is moving up or down, it indicates that the market is trending. If it moves horizontally, it signals that the market is ranging''.\n\n===Kijun-sen===\nKijun-sen ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u57fa\u6e96|\u57fa\u6e96]]\u7dda}}) calculation: (highest high + lowest low)/2 for the past 26 periods.\n\nThis is a confirmation line, a support/resistance line, and can be used as a trailing stop line. The Kijun Sen acts as an indicator of future price movement. If the price is higher than the blue line, it could continue to climb higher. If the price is below the blue line, it could keep dropping.\n\n===Senkou span A===\nSenkou ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u5148\u884c|\u5148\u884c]]}}) span A calculation: (Tenkan-sen + kijun-sen)/2 plotted 26 periods ahead.\n\nAlso called leading span 1, this line forms one edge of the kumo or cloud.\n\nIf the price is above the Senkou span, the top line serves as the first support level while the bottom line serves as the second support level.\n\nIf the price is below the Senkou span, the bottom line forms the first resistance level while the top line is the second resistance level.\n\n===Senkou span B===\nSenkou span B calculation: (highest high + lowest low)/2 calculated over the past 52 time periods and plotted 26 periods ahead.\n\nAlso called leading span 2, this line forms the other edge of the Kumo.\n\n===Kumo===\nKumo ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u96f2|\u96f2]]}}, cloud) is the space between Senkou span A and B. The cloud edges identify current and potential future support and resistance points.\n\nThe Kumo cloud changes in shape and height based on price changes. This height represents volatility as larger price movements form thicker clouds, which creates stronger support and resistance. As thinner clouds offer only weak support and resistance, prices can and tend to break through such thin clouds.\n\nGenerally, markets are bullish when Senkou Span A is above Senkou Span B and vice versa when markets are bearish. Traders often look for Kumo Twists in future clouds, where Senkou Span A and B exchange positions, a signal of potential trend reversals.\n\nIn addition to thickness, the strength of the cloud can also be ascertained by its angle; upwards for bullish and downwards for bearish. Any clouds behind price are also known as Kumo Shadows.\n\n===Chikou span===\nChikou ({{lang|ja|[[:wikt:\u9045\u884c|\u9045\u884c]]}}) span calculation: today's closing price projected back 26 days on the chart.\n\nAlso called the lagging span it is used as a support/resistance aid.\n\nIf the Chikou Span or the green line crosses the price in the bottom-up direction, that is a buy signal. If the green line crosses the price from the top-down, that is a sell signal.\n\n== The key elements of Ichimoku's Time Theory ==\n\nGoichi Hosoda also developed the time theory by differentiating 3-time ranges and two different levels: simple and compound.\n\n===Numerical values===\n\nSimple ranges\n[[File:= SIMPLE ranges.png|thumb|Simple ranges at Ichimoku]]\n\nCompound ranges\n[[File:= COMPOUND RANGES.png|thumb|Compound ranges at Ichimoku]]\n\n===Equality in the numerical values or Taitou-Suchi===\n\nHen-Gi: Using a numerical value that happened before and applying it from another\n\nJyu-Gi: Proposing a numerical value that happened before and applying it from a point between the time range\n\n== The key elements of Ichimoku wave movement theory ==\n\nHosoda knew about [[Elliott wave principle]] but his renderings about it were not as complex as Elliott\u2019s.

During this time period, 1940\u20131960, it was supplied for free as the data was so valuable to E. F. Wonderlic. He wanted to perfect the test, not charge for it. In the 1970s [[Tom Landry]], coach of the [[Dallas Cowboys]], was the first to use the Wonderlic Personnel Test to predict player performance.<ref name=\"Pollick2003\"/> It is still used in the annual [[NFL Combine]] as a form of pre-draft assessment.<ref name=\"Pollick2003\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In short, it attempts to screen candidates for certain jobs within the shortest possible time.

The Wonderlic Personnel test is divided into two different forms of test: the Wonderlic Personnel Test - Quicktest (30 questions in 8 minutes) and the Wonderlic Personnel Test (50 questions, 12 minutes).

In fall 1996, Jordan requested an interview with Keith Harrigan, New London's Assistant City Manager in charge of personnel. Harrigan informed Jordan that he was ineligible because he scored too high on the written portion of the Wonderlic test intended to evaluate cognitive ability. New London had decided to consider only applicants who scored between 20 and 27 on the written examination. Jordan scored a 33 on the exam, the equivalent of having an IQ of 125. \n\nJordan filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]], where his case was dismissed by Judge Peter C. Dorsey, who noted: \"The guarantee of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment is not a source of substantive rights or liberties, but rather a right to be free from invidious discrimination in statutory classifications and other governmental activity. It is well settled that where a statutory classification does not itself impinge on a right or liberty protected by the Constitution, the validity of the classification must be sustained unless the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of [any legitimate government] objective....[Jordan] may have been disqualified unwisely but he was not denied equal protection.\"<ref>http://www.aele.org/apa/jordan-newlondon.html</ref> The dismissal was upheld on appeal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]].\n\n==Central tendency of Wonderlic scores==\n{{See also|Central tendency}}\nServing as a quantitative measure for employers, scores are collected by the employers and the applicant's score may be compared to a professional standard, as is the case with security guards or, simply, compared to the scores of other applicants who happen to be applying for the same or similar positions at that time.<ref name=Wonderlic1983>{{cite book|title=Wonderlic Personnel Test Manual|year=1983|publisher=E.F.

In fall 1996, Jordan requested an interview with Keith Harrigan, New London's Assistant City Manager in charge of personnel. Harrigan informed Jordan that he was ineligible because he scored too high on the written portion of the Wonderlic test intended to evaluate cognitive ability. New London had decided to consider only applicants who scored between 20 and 27 on the written examination. Jordan scored a 33 on the exam, the equivalent of having an IQ of 125. \n\nJordan filed suit in the [[United States District Court for the District of Connecticut]], where his case was dismissed by Judge Peter C. Dorsey, who noted: \"The guarantee of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment is not a source of substantive rights or liberties, but rather a right to be free from invidious discrimination in statutory classifications and other governmental activity. It is well settled that where a statutory classification does not itself impinge on a right or liberty protected by the Constitution, the validity of the classification must be sustained unless the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of [any legitimate government] objective....[Jordan] may have been disqualified unwisely but he was not denied equal protection.\"<ref>http://www.aele.org/apa/jordan-newlondon.html</ref> The dismissal was upheld on appeal to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]].\n\n==Central tendency of Wonderlic scores==\n{{See also|Central tendency}}\nServing as a quantitative measure for employers, scores are collected by the employers and the applicant's score may be compared to a professional standard, as is the case with security guards or, simply, compared to the scores of other applicants who happen to be applying for the same or similar positions at that time.<ref name=Wonderlic1983>{{cite book|title=Wonderlic Personnel Test Manual|year=1983|publisher=E.F.

He flew from Houston to Tucson with members of his family. While en route, the Kellys received an erroneous news report that Giffords had died. \"The kids, Claudia and Claire, started crying. My mother, she almost screamed. I just walked into the bathroom, and, you know, broke down.\" Calling family in Tucson, Kelly found out that the report was false and that she was alive and in surgery. \"It was a terrible mistake,\" Kelly said, \"as bad as it was that she had died, it's equally exciting that she hadn't.\"<ref name=\"GGFearABC\" />\n\nFrom the time he arrived in Tucson, Kelly sat vigil at his wife's bedside as she struggled to survive and began to recover.

Kelly said that prior to the attack, \"I thought the world just spins and the clock just ticks and things happen for no particular reason.\" Kelly said that, in Tucson, as he found himself wandering in makeshift memorials and shrines, filled with Bibles and angels that \"You pray where you are. You pray when God is there in your heart.\"<ref name=\"KellyPrayerBrkUSAToday\" /> Kelly offered the final prayer of the morning. The prayer was from Rabbi Stephanie Aaron, who married Kelly and Giffords, and who said the same words over Giffords on the night of the shooting:\n\n{{quote|In the name of God, our God of Israel, may Michael, God's angel messenger of compassion, watch over your right side.
