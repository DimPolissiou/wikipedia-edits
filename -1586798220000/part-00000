''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'', a 1952 collection of Fairbairn's papers previously published in various psychoanalytic journals, includes four papers that contain most of his innovative concepts. \n\nFairbairn's model is  classified as psychoanalytic model or theory because it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models\u2014the belief that the fundamental source of human motivation originates in the unconscious\u2014as well as offering explanations of the origins and dynamics of transference, repetition compulsions, and resistance. His enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian [[metapsychology]] with his own. Fairbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant is overflowing with primitive drives needing to be tamed, but rather that the infant is seeking love and emotional attachment that can infuse him with the security he needs to explore the world, safe in the knowledge that he has parents ready to help him if he becomes overwhelmed in that exploration. Fairbairn's model offers a different theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology, and a different approach to the treatment of disordered individuals. Fairbairn's model also shifts the focus away from repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as humans' fundamental defense mechanism. \n\nGreenberg and Mitchell noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn.  \n<blockquote>\nIn a series of dense and fertile papers written during the early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe psychoanalytic model Freud offers is a '''drive/structure model''': it proposes that human beings are born with innate, biological drives (e.g., sexual desire and aggression) contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating) comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society, there is immediate conflict. A new structure must emerge from the Id of the growing infant to insure that its drives are expressed in a socially acceptable way. Thus the unconscious Id\u2014Freud's metaphor for the whole range and strength of biological drives\u2014is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of a second structure: the Ego. Thus the Ego has the task of mediating between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development (via the Oedipal Conflict), the child internalizes the values of his parents. These internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures\u2014Id, Ego, and Super Ego\u2014mature and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make morally correct choices. \n\nIn contrast, Fairbairn's is a '''relational/structure model''' in its assumption that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, not from pressure from the Id, whose existence Fairbairn rejects. Instead, Fairbairn proposes that the human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. A child's growing and maturing internal ego structures can be understood as packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. For Fairburn, the unconscious develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's underdeveloped central ego to tolerate. Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In families where punishment is frequent and severe, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be so overwhelmed by parental aggression that it faces the loss of its sense of self, as described by Bromberg:     <blockquote>\nPsychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, [sic] assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. \u2026 At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n</blockquote>\nOver time, these dissociated events, including those in which the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world. (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process.) Thus the human psyche acquires structure from the tensions of split-off traumas so toxic they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. Therefore, the unconscious is not a biological inheritance of humankind but a development of specific parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n===='Schizoid Factors in the Personality' (1940)====\n\nIn his first paper, Fairbairn observed that many of his patients seemed \"schizoid\", which he defined as any individual who showed evidence of  having '''splits in their ego structure''' directly resulting from dissociated memories in their central ego. The dissociated packages of memories are held in the unconscious, \"split-off\" from the conscious central ego which no longer knows that they exist. Thus, many reality-based traumas are no longer known to the individual, who becomes withdrawn for interpersonal interactions. Fairbairn defined the schizoid as having the three following characteristics. <blockquote>\n\u2026 (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality.\u2026 So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn, 1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe more frequently a child encounters intolerable trauma, the larger the number of memories of actual lived experiences that are split off and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\". The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originates from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid child was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world, which, though safer, is ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:\n<blockquote>\nRegressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude (the earliest form of dependency) would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18).<ref name=\":2\" /> \n</blockquote>\nFairbairn recognized that lack of love in a young child's life is traumatic and disruptive to his attachment, and that  that the intolerable-to accept parental failures force him to use the dissociative defense, causing splits in his ego. \n\nTypically, Fairbairn returned again and again to topics that he had discussed in his early papers as he was gradually expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper on the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child blames himself for not being lovable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. By blaming himself, he continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he and his love are toxic. This theme will come up again in the 1943 paper when Fairbairn described \"The Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" a cognitive defense in which the child blames himself for the parental failures. In the next quote, Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which was defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id. Fairbairn was forced to use the preexisting language of psychoanalysis, however he took the word \"libido\" and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or love of other external objects:<blockquote>\nIt is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    \n</blockquote>\nSimply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.\n\n===='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'====\nFairbairn was gradually forming  his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, the shift in focus from drive theory to object relations theory was too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian in the 1940s, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an \"interesting\" philosophical and intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the foundational models of  \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, Stephen & Aron, Lewis|first=|title=Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=1999|isbn=0-88163-270-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation both physically and psychologically) from the parent because of the emergence  of a mature, reality based, central ego in the young adult. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the developmental proceeds, the child gradually realizes that is not part of his mother, but rather is an independent, fully functioning person. Unfortunately, many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from his parents without being sure of their love and support. The loved child does receive support and encouragement which gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  \n\nThe unloved child attempts to avoid further emotional rebuffs  by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\". That is, he turns away from the harsh and unloving world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available at all times. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the antilibidinal ego ad he rejecting object in the splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.   \n\nSecondly, the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumed were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power,  and his desire for revenge, which temporarily lessens his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's  has been validated by the  millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external reality, including their family members, while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. \n\nFairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individual who either live at home with their ageing parents, or others who live separately, but remain fixated in an adolescent time warp is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   \n\n===='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ====\nFairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community who found his work acceptable as he had the temerity to once again urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal\"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Later on, in the same paper, Fairbairn added another comment that further alienated his analytic colleagues.  <blockquote>A point has now been reached at which the theory (Freud's Libido theory) has outworn its usefulness and, so far from providing impetus for further progress within the field of psychoanalytical thought , is actually operating as a brake upon the wheels (Fairbairn, 1952, p.72)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>This is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for in 1943, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as compared to his vision of the child's motivation which was to search for a good object and establish a loving  relationship with another human being. To make matters much worse, Fairbairn then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather compendium of  memories of interpersonal events that were too destructive to the child's needed attachment to his parents for his developing ego to accept. Fairbairn's\"challenge\" of the Freudian model was not a problem for the analytic community despite the fact that Fairbairn's unconscious was so different from the \"standard\" Freudian view, simply because his model was politely ignored until the publication of Greenberg and Mitchell's book in 1983,<ref name=\":6\" />. This alerted the younger members of the psychoanalytic community to a new model of psychoanalysis, and the renewed interest provoked numerous publications.  <blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />.  </blockquote>Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love,help, guidance, and support, and who fails the child again and again. Note that Fairbairn uses the word '''repressed''' rather than '''dissociated''' in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" a overwhelmingly traumatic event in the external world  and simultaneously forcing it into in the unconscious. Once there,  it is held out of awareness by repression. In this short quote Fairbairn dismisses Freud's notion of biological forces that were claimed to be the fundamental motivator of humankind and replaced them with the assumption that the human unconscious was developed from the dissociation of traumatic rejections during  which the child needs were ignored or dismissed.  Once in the unconscious, they resonate throughout the individuals life.     \n\nOnce these \"bad-object\" memories are dissociated and repressed they become the basic source of human psychopathology.  <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The second and third points in this quote can exacerbate or  mitigate the impact of these bad object internalizations. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might dis-identify with her father and, in adulthood, support abused women. The third factor is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of the traumas he/she experienced in childhood and will have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other because they have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the traumatic events of their childhood. Thus, they will never comprehend what happened to them, and how it influenced their adulthood. Instead, the internalized patterns will re-emerge and be acted out with the next generation. This is called the \"intergenerational transmission of trauma\".                    \n\nFairbairn noticed that children whom had been removed from their families because of extreme neglect or abuse (this was in Scotland during the 1930's) made endless excuses for their parents and assumed that they were responsible for the treatment that they were receiving. That is, their parents were punishing them because they were dirty, disobedient, or lazy. The child assumed that he/she was the cause of the parent's hostile behavior toward them. Fairbairn called this the \"Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" Once again, the child is desperate to support the illusion that he is living within a  loving family, and that he/she is the cause of the strife..         <blockquote>It become obvious, therefore, that the child would rather be bad himself than have bad objects: and accordingly we have some justification for surmising that  one of his motives in becoming bad is to make his objects \"good'. In becoming bad he is really taking upon himself the burden of badness which appears to reside in his objects. By this means he seeks to purge them of his badness: and in proportion as he succeeds in doing so,he is rewarded by that sense of security which an environment of good objects so characteristically confers....Outer security is thus purchased at the price of inner insecurity (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>This defense is a cognitive defense in that the child is explaining to himself why he is being punished or neglected. By saying it is his fault, he absolves his parents and gives them a \"good\" reason for treating him badly. As Fairbairn notes, it continues the pattern of using defenses to support the illusion that he/she is living in a loving family.. The child prefers to believe that he has a \"moral\" defect, such as being  lazy, disrespectful, or of being chronically dirty, all of which are potentially correctable, than see that his parents are emotionally bankrupt. Worse, the defensive self blame erodes what little self worth the child may have developed. This defense is really a precursor to the splitting defense that Fairbairn described in his next paper (1944), in that it is a primitive form of splitting in that he parental objects are \"all good\", and the child himself is \"all bad\". Fairbairn never went back to his earlier concepts, like the moral defense and updated them to fit in with his evolving thought.          \n\nThen Fairbairn returned to  his earlier discussion that he had begun in his 1940 and 1941 papers of different aspects of the child's dependency on his objects. These concepts would have been more appropriate in his earlier papers where he first discussed the issue of dependency. However, the reader is given an opportunity to actually see how a major innovator of a psychoanalytic theory gradually created a model. His mind was not linear, and many topics came to mind again and again, dependency being the most frequent topic.Here, he observes the intense need of the child for his parents and the child's inability to reject them, regardless of how badly he/she was being treated.        <blockquote>The child not only internalizes his bad objects because they force themselves upon him and he seeks to control them, but also,and above all, because he ''needs'' them. If a child's parents are bad objects, he cannot eject them, even if they do not force themselves upon him: for he cannot do without them. '''Even if they neglect him, he cannot reject them: for if they neglect him, his need for them is increased''' (Fairbairn, 1952,p.67)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>Fairbairn made this revolutionary observation and, at the time, it went unnoticed. The '''neglected child needs the parent more, rather than less''' because the individual's earlier needs were never fulfilled, and they do not suddenly disappear or resolve themselves. This observation seems counter-intuitive when seen from an adult perspective, because a mature individual would leave a hostile or unloving interpersonal situation in a minute.  However, the reality of many  young adults from neglectful families is that they are pressured to remain with their abusive parents by their own unmet needs. They may have unmet needs from age 4, 5,6,7,8 (and so on) that were  never met, so as a young adult this individual has '''no possibility whatsoever of separating''' from his neglectful parents and beginning a life of his own. This was one of Fairbairn's great insights which can be seen in virtually all patients.                                    \n\nFairbairn then took up new topics in he same wide-ranging paper- which is one of his two greatest (the second being his 1944 paper which will be described in the next section). The two topics were his theory of treatment and his view of resistance. Most of his work focuses on the bad object, and the many psychological problems it fostered. Here, he begins to think about the effects of a good object- one that fulfills the promise of being nurturant, loving, and supportive. As mentioned earlier, Fairbairn's model is symmetrical, in that good objects (which ideally should be present in every child's life)  have the opposite effect as compared to bad objects. Here he notes that they can actually cure or at least mitigate, the effects of internalized bad objects.                 <blockquote>Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that such results must be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that in the transference situation the patient is provided in reality with an unwontedly good object, and is thereby placed in a position to risk a release of his internalized bad objects from the unconscious and so to provide conditions for the libidinal cathexis of these objects to be dissolved-albeit he is also under a temptation to exploit a \"good\" relationship  with he analyst as a defense against taking this risk (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69) .<ref name=\":2\" />                  </blockquote>Fairbairn  identifies one of the key mutaive factors in psychotherapy as the \"good relationship\" between the therapist and patient. The influence of a good object therapist should provoke a derepression (a release from the unconscious) of the memories of abuse and neglect that were previously unavailable to his conscious central ego. He sees the relationship between patient and therapist as providing the patient with enough confidence and support to allow him to \"remember\" what actually happened to him, as he has a new object upon whom he can depend. He  uses the word \"libidinal cathexis\" in his quote which is a holdover from the Freudian model. It means emotional investment of libidinal energy in the other person, which when translated into Fairbairn's terminology, means emotional attachment. Thus, a relationship with a new, good object can loosen up the attachment to internalized bad object, as the good object offers the patient an alternative attachment. In reality, this process seldom happens until treatment is well underway and the therapist is specifically aiming to unearth this type of material.  Most frequently, the patient stubbornly clings to his illusions of a loving and supportive family as well as to the illusion that he is somehow defective and deserving of neglect or abuse.\n\nThe 1943  paper's title \"Repression and the Return of Bad Objects\" suggests the Fairbairn was going to address the reemergence of bad objects, which he does in a  comment on one of the fundamental sources of '''Resistance.''' Resistance describes the patient's attempts to remain the same and fight against the therapist's interventions during the process of psychotherapy, despite their conscious desire to change. As previously noted, Fairbairn's model is  coherent, and given that the source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects because they were intolerable to accept, resistance comes from the patient's fear of acknowledging and accepting what happened to him in childhood despite the fact that these events occurred decades ago. This is true even if the parents are long deceased, because for the patient to accept what they did to him/her as a child will, in most cases, destroy all his illusions about them as parents and the \"goodness\" of his childhood. It also leaves the individual without a personal history as he has to discard all his fantasies of being a member of a family. For a detailed description of how to manage patient resistance during the process of treatment see Celani, 2010 (pp,117-184)<ref name=\":4\" />. \n\nFairbairn's quote on resistance is graphic and too the point.<blockquote>There is little doubt in my mind that, in conjunction with another factor to be mentioned later, the deepest source of resistance is fear of the release of bad objects from the unconscious: for, when such bad objects are released the world around the patient becomes '''peopled with devils which are too terrifying for him to face'''...At the same time there is now little doubt in my mind that the release of bad objects from the unconscious is one of he chief aims which the psychotherapist should set himself out to achieve, even at the expense of a severe\"transference neurosis\": for it is only when the internalized bad objects are released from the unconscious that there is any hope of their cathexis being dissolved. The bad objects can only be safely released , however, if the analyst has become established as a sufficiently good object for the patient. Otherwise the resulting insecurity may prove insupportable (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69-70)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>Fairbairn's comment on the difficulty for patients to actual reexamine and tolerate the events that they had already suffered through is absolutely correct.Exposure of the patient to the realities of his childhood can only be successfully managed when the patient is securely attached to the therapist as a good object and thus will not feel abandoned when the illusions about his parents fall away. Fairbairn was both a philosopher and an advanced  divinity student before becoming a physician and psychoanalyst and often his language involves devils and angels, as it does in this quote. Later on the next page he ends his comment on resistance with the statement: \"It becomes evident, accordingly, that the psychotherapist is the true successor to the exorcist, and that he is concerned, not only with \"the forgiveness of sins\", but also with \"the casting out of devils\"\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.70).<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n=== Endopsychic Structure Considered in terms of Object Relationships (1944) ===\n{{Main|Splitting of the Ego}}\nFairbairn's 1944 article described his structural theory in terms of six structures, including two conscious structures, '''The Central Ego''' and its relationship to the '''Ideal Object''', and two '''pairs''' of unconscious structures. The unconscious structures are: '''The Antilibidinal Ego''' and its relationship to the '''Rejecting object''', and:  '''The Libidinal Ego''' and its relationship to the '''Exciting Object'''. The fundamental position of Object Relations Theory is that for every developing self there has to be a object to whom it relates. The simple reality that Fairbairn's structural theory contains six different structures is a source of difficulty in terms of its adoption by the analytic community,as it is more complex than Freud's three structure theory. It represents a whole new vision of the psychological functioning of the human personality, which is very different than the the original Libido Theory. Fairbairn's model is one of relationships and there are dialogues between the structures. That is, the relational pattern that was internalized includes the typical dialogues that were originally in the external world, but now continue in the internal world.  \n\nAs described in previous sections the neglected child solves the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. Prior to Fairbairn, the defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn's work in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>convinced him that  children separated from their families experienced a major trauma that required the dissociative defense to prevent a complete psychic collapse. The dissociative defense erased the event from their consciousness. The memory of the abandonment  along with the  memory of the parents reasons for their actions are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the abandoned child to continue loving a parent that he/she sees as completely supportive. \n\n==== Fairbairn's Structural Model and the Splitting of the Ego ====\nIn families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent coalesce in the child's unconscious and become a single representation of the angry parent called the Rejecting Object. The child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions which was called  the Antilibidinal Ego. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized Rejecting Object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden: <blockquote>\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either\" (Odgen,2010)<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|title=The International Journal of Psychoanalysis|date=2010|volume=91|pages=101-118|chapter=|publisher=|doi=|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8}}</ref></blockquote>Within the child's inner world (his unconscious) the Antilibidinal Ego '''relates only to the''' Rejecting Object''',''' and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious Central Ego that is in contact with the acceptable aspects of the parent, called the Ideal Object, and with external reality.  In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  This fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the Exciting Object by Fairbairn, and the child's self that relates to it was called the Libidinal Ego (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it, while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is always out of reach. \n\n'''The Splitting''' '''Defense''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole object. Thus, the individual  never develops '''\"object constancy\"''' which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of childhood development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  libidinal ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and minutes later says \"I love you, Mommy\". The dominant ego state has no memory of the other ego state which is repressed. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref> \n\n==== The Variable Strength of the Ego Structures ====\nThe three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are '''unaware''' of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious Central Ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's Central Ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. \n\nIn less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his Central Ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego has lost sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  '''The ratio of''' '''conscious to unconscious structures''' shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the Libidinal Ego. A powerful unconscious influences the weakened Central Ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> \n\n'''Transference, Resistance and Repetition Compulsions'''\n\nWhen any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html 'Fairbairn's Structural Model'], Richard L.

Fairbairn was one of the theory-builders for the [[British Independent Group (psychoanalysis)|Middle Group]]<ref>{{cite book | authorlink=Peter Fuller|last=Fuller|first=Peter | title=Introduction to \"Psychoanalysis and after\" | publisher=Chatto | year=1985|isbn=0-7011-2971-9|page=21}}</ref> (now called the Independent Group) psychoanalysts. The Independent Group contained analysts who identified with neither the [[Melanie Klein|Klein]]ians nor the [[Anna Freud]]ians. They were more concerned with the relationships between people than with the \"drives\" within them.\n\nHe died in Edinburgh at the age of 75. He is buried with his wives in [[Dean Cemetery]] in western [[Edinburgh]].

''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'', a 1952 collection of Fairbairn's papers previously published in various psychoanalytic journals, includes four papers that contain most of his innovative concepts. \n\nFairbairn's model is  classified as psychoanalytic model or theory because it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models\u2014the belief that the fundamental source of human motivation originates in the unconscious\u2014as well as offering explanations of the origins and dynamics of transference, repetition compulsions, and resistance. His enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian [[metapsychology]] with his own. Fairbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant is overflowing with primitive drives needing to be tamed, but rather that the infant is seeking love and emotional attachment that can infuse him with the security he needs to explore the world, safe in the knowledge that he has parents ready to help him if he becomes overwhelmed in that exploration. Fairbairn's model offers a different theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology, and a different approach to the treatment of disordered individuals. Fairbairn's model also shifts the focus away from repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as humans' fundamental defense mechanism. \n\nGreenberg and Mitchell noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn.  \n<blockquote>\nIn a series of dense and fertile papers written during the early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe psychoanalytic model Freud offers is a '''drive/structure model''': it proposes that human beings are born with innate, biological drives (e.g., sexual desire and aggression) contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating) comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society, there is immediate conflict. A new structure must emerge from the Id of the growing infant to insure that its drives are expressed in a socially acceptable way. Thus the unconscious Id\u2014Freud's metaphor for the whole range and strength of biological drives\u2014is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of a second structure: the Ego. Thus the Ego has the task of mediating between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development (via the Oedipal Conflict), the child internalizes the values of his parents. These internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures\u2014Id, Ego, and Super Ego\u2014mature and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make morally correct choices. \n\nIn contrast, Fairbairn's is a '''relational/structure model''' in its assumption that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, not from pressure from the Id, whose existence Fairbairn rejects. Instead, Fairbairn proposes that the human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. A child's growing and maturing internal ego structures can be understood as packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. For Fairburn, the unconscious develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's underdeveloped central ego to tolerate. Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In families where punishment is frequent and severe, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be so overwhelmed by parental aggression that it faces the loss of its sense of self, as described by Bromberg:     <blockquote>\nPsychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, [sic] assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. \u2026 At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n</blockquote>\nOver time, these dissociated events, including those in which the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world. (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process.) Thus the human psyche acquires structure from the tensions of split-off traumas so toxic they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. Therefore, the unconscious is not a biological inheritance of humankind but a development of specific parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n===='Schizoid Factors in the Personality' (1940)====\n\nIn his first paper, Fairbairn observed that many of his patients seemed \"schizoid\", which he defined as any individual who showed evidence of  having '''splits in their ego structure''' directly resulting from dissociated memories in their central ego. The dissociated packages of memories are held in the unconscious, \"split-off\" from the conscious central ego which no longer knows that they exist. Thus, many reality-based traumas are no longer known to the individual, who becomes withdrawn for interpersonal interactions. Fairbairn defined the schizoid as having the three following characteristics. <blockquote>\n\u2026 (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality.\u2026 So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn, 1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe more frequently a child encounters intolerable trauma, the larger the number of memories of actual lived experiences that are split off and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\". The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originates from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid child was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world, which, though safer, is ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:\n<blockquote>\nRegressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude (the earliest form of dependency) would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18).<ref name=\":2\" /> \n</blockquote>\nFairbairn recognized that lack of love in a young child's life is traumatic and disruptive to his attachment, and that  that the intolerable-to accept parental failures force him to use the dissociative defense, causing splits in his ego. \n\nTypically, Fairbairn returned again and again to topics that he had discussed in his early papers as he was gradually expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper on the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child blames himself for not being lovable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. By blaming himself, he continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he and his love are toxic. This theme will come up again in the 1943 paper when Fairbairn described \"The Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" a cognitive defense in which the child blames himself for the parental failures. In the next quote, Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which was defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id. Fairbairn was forced to use the preexisting language of psychoanalysis, however he took the word \"libido\" and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or love of other external objects:<blockquote>\nIt is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    \n</blockquote>\nSimply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.\n\n===='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'====\nFairbairn was gradually forming  his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, the shift in focus from drive theory to object relations theory was too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian in the 1940s, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an \"interesting\" philosophical and intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the foundational models of  \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, Stephen & Aron, Lewis|first=|title=Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=1999|isbn=0-88163-270-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation both physically and psychologically) from the parent because of the emergence  of a mature, reality based, central ego in the young adult. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the developmental proceeds, the child gradually realizes that is not part of his mother, but rather is an independent, fully functioning person. Unfortunately, many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from his parents without being sure of their love and support. The loved child does receive support and encouragement which gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  \n\nThe unloved child attempts to avoid further emotional rebuffs  by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\". That is, he turns away from the harsh world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available at all times. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the antilibidinal ego ad he rejecting object in the splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.   \n\nSecondly, the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumed were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power,  and his desire for revenge, which temporarily lessens his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's  has been validated by the  millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external reality, including their family members, while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. \n\nFairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individual who either live at home with their ageing parents, or others who live separately, but remain fixated in an adolescent time warp is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   \n\n===='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ====\nFairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community who found his work acceptable as he had the temerity to once again urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal\"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>This is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for in 1943, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as compared to his vision of the child's motivation which was to search for a good object and establish a loving  relationship with another human being. To make matters much worse, Fairbairn then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather compendium of  memories of interpersonal events that were too destructive to the child's needed attachment to his parents for his developing ego to accept. Fairbairn's\"challenge\" of the Freudian model was not a problem for the analytic community despite the fact that Fairbairn's unconscious was so different from the \"standard\" Freudian view, simply because his model was politely ignored until the publication of Greenberg and Mitchell's book in 1983,<ref name=\":6\" />. This alerted the younger members of the psychoanalytic community to a new model of psychoanalysis, and the renewed interest provoked numerous publications.  <blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love,help, guidance, and support, and who fails the child again and again. Note that Fairbairn uses the word '''repressed''' rather than '''dissociated''' in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" a overwhelmingly traumatic event in the external world  and simultaneously forcing it into in the unconscious. Once there,  it is held out of awareness by repression. In this short quote Fairbairn dismisses Freud's notion of biological forces that were claimed to be the fundamental motivator of humankind and replaced them with the assumption that the human unconscious was developed from the dissociation of traumatic rejections during  which the child needs were ignored or dismissed.  Once in the unconscious, they resonate throughout the individuals life.     \n\nOnce these \"bad-object\" memories are dissociated and repressed they become the basic source of human psychopathology.  <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The second and third points in this quote can exacerbate or  mitigate the impact of these bad object internalizations. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might dis-identify with her father and, in adulthood, support abused women. The third factor is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of the traumas he/she experienced in childhood and will have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other because they have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the traumatic events of their childhood. Thus, they will never comprehend what happened to them, and how it influenced their adulthood. Instead, the internalized patterns will re-emerge and be acted out with the next generation. This is called the \"intergenerational transmission of trauma\".                        \n\nFairbairn noticed that children whom had been removed from their families because of extreme neglect or abuse (this was in 1940's Scotland) made endless excuses for their parents and assumed that they were responsible for the treatment that they were receiving. That is, their parents were punishing them because they were dirty, disobedient, or lazy. The child assumed that he was the cause of the parent's hostile behavior toward them. Fairbairn called this the \"Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" Once again, the child is desperate to support the illusion that he is living within a  loving family, and that he/she is the cause of the strife..         <blockquote>It become obvious, therefore, that the child would rather be bad himself than have bad objects: and accordingly we have some justification for surmising that  one of his motives in becoming bad is to make his objects \"good'. In becoming bad he is really taking upon himself the burden of badness which appears to reside in his objects. By this means he seeks to purge them of his badness: and in proportion as he succeeds in doing so,he is rewarded by that sense of security which an environment of good objects so characteristically confers....Outer security is thus purchased at the price of inner insecurity (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>This defense is a cognitive defense in that the child is explaining to himself why he is being punished or neglected. By saying it is his fault, he absolves his parents and gives them a \"good\" reason for treating him badly. As Fairbairn notes, it continues the pattern of using defenses to support the illusion that he/she is living in a loving family.. The child prefers to believe that he has a \"moral\" defect, such as being  lazy, disrespectful, or of being chronically dirty, all of which are potentially correctable, than see that his parents are emotionally bankrupt. Worse, the defensive self blame erodes what little self worth the child may have developed. This defense is really a precursor to the splitting defense that Fairbairn described in his next paper (1944). It is a primitive form of splitting in that he parental objects are \"all good\", and the child himself is \"all bad\". Fairbairn never went back to his earlier concepts, like the moral defense and updated them to fit in with his evolving thought.                     \n\nThen Fairbairn continued his earlier discussion that he had begun in his 1940 and 1941 papers of different aspects of the child's dependency on his objects. These concepts would have been more appropriate in his earlier papers where he first discussed the issue of dependency. However, the reader is given an opportunity to actually see how a major innovator of a psychoanalytic theory gradually created a model. His mind was not linear, and many topics came to mind again and again, dependency being the most frequent topic.Here, he observes the intense need of the child for his parents and the child's inability to reject them, regardless of how badly they treated him.        <blockquote>The child not only internalizes his bad objects because they force themselves upon him and he seeks to control them, but also,and above all, because he ''needs'' them. If a child's parents are bad objects, he cannot eject them, even if they do not force themselves upon him: for he cannot do without them. '''Even if they neglect him, he cannot reject them: for if they neglect him, his need for them is increased''' (Fairbairn, 1952,p.67)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>Fairbairn made this revolutionary observation and at the time it went unnoticed. The '''neglected child needs the parent more, rather than less''' because the individual's earlier needs were never fulfilled, and they do not suddenly disappear or resolve themselves. This observation seems counter-intuitive when seen from an adult perspective, because a mature individual would leave in a minute.  However, the reality of many  young adults from neglectful families is that they are pressured to remain with their abusive parents by their own unmet needs. They may have unmet needs from age 4, 5,6,7,8 (and so on) that were  never met, so as a young adult this individual has '''no possibility whatsoever of separating''' from his neglectful parents and beginning a life of his own. This was one of Fairbairn's great insights which can be seen in virtually all patients.                                   \n\nFairbairn then took up new topics in he same wide-ranging paper- which is one of his two greatest (the second being his 1944 paper which will be described in the next section). The two topics were his theory of treatment and his view of resistance. Most of his work focuses on the bad object, and the many psychological problems it fostered. Here, he begins to think about the effects of a good object- one that fulfills the promise of being nurturant, loving, and supportive.As mentioned earlier, Fairbairn's model is symmetrical, in that good objects, which should have been present in every child's life, have the opposite effect as compared to bad objects. Here he notes that they can actually cure or at least mitigate, the effects of internalized bad objects.                 <blockquote>Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that such results must be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that in the transference situation the patient is provided in reality with an unwontedly good object, and is thereby placed in a position to risk a release of his internalized bad objects from the unconscious and so to provide conditions for the libidinal cathexis of these objects to be dissolved-albeit he is also under a temptation to exploit a \"good\" relationship  with he analyst as a defense against taking this risk (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69) .<ref name=\":2\" />                  </blockquote>Fairbairn  identifies one of he mutaive factors in psychotherapy as the \"good relationship\" between the therapist and patient as one that might provoke a derepression (a release from the unconscious) of the memories of abuse and neglect that were previously unavailable to his conscious central ego. He sees the relationship between patient and therapist as providing the patient with enough confidence and support to allow him to \"remember\" or more accurately, \"de-repress\" memories of neglect and abuse from his childhood. He also uses the word \"libidinal cathexis\" in his quote which is a holdover from the Freudian model. It means emotional investment of libidinal energy in the other person, which when translated into Fairbairn's terminology, means emotional attachment. Thus, a relationship with a new, good object can loosen up the attachment to internalized bad object, as the good object offers the patient an alternative attachment. In reality, this process seldom happens until treatment is well underway and the therapist is specifically aiming to unearth this type of material.  Most frequently, the patient clings to his illusions of a loving and supportive family as well as to the illusion that he is somehow defective and deserving of neglect or abuse.\n\nThe paper's title \"Repression and the Return of Bad Objects\" suggests the Fairbairn was going to address the reemergence of bad objects, which he did in a very brief comment on one of the fundamental sources of '''Resistance.''' Resistance describes the patient's attempts to remain the same and fight against the therapist's interventions during the process of psychotherapy, despite their conscious desire to change. As previously noted, Fairbairn's model is  coherent, and given that the source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects because they were intolerable to accept, resistance comes from the patient's fear of acknowledging and accepting what happened to him in childhood despite the fact that these events occurred decades ago. This is true even if the parents are long deceased, because for the patient to accept what they did to him/her as a child will, in most cases, destroy all his illusions about them as parents and the \"goodness\" of his childhood. It also leaves the individual without a personal history as he has to discard all his fantasies of being a member of a family. \n\nFairbairn's quote is graphic and too the point.<blockquote>There is little doubt in my mind that, in conjunction with another factor to be mentioned later, the deepest source of resistance is fear of the release of bad objects from the unconscious: for, when such bad objects are released the world around the patient becomes '''peopled with devils which are too terrifying for him to fac'''e...at the same time there is now little doubt in my mind that the release of bad objects from the unconscious is one of he chief aims which the psychotherapist should set himself out to achieve (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>Fairbairn's comment on the difficulty for patients to actual reexamine and tolerate the events that they had already suffered through is absolutely correct. He was both a philosopher and an advanced  divinity student before becoming a physician and psychoanalyst and often his language involves devils and angels, as it does in this quote. Later on the next page he ends his comment on resistance with the statement: \"It becomes evident, accordingly, that the psychotherapist is the true successor to the exorcist, and that he is concerned, not only with \"the forgiveness of sins\", but also with \"the casting out of devils\"\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.70).<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n=== The splitting of the ego ===\n{{Main|Splitting (psychology)}}\nFairbairn recognized that  children are  totally and absolutely dependent on their parents. Because of this dependency they cannot tolerate \"knowing\" that their parents are indifferent, abandoning, and perhaps even abusive. They solve the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. The defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn had worked in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>as one of his part-time appointments and his experiences with children separated from their families alerted him to the reality that the child's extreme dependency on their parents makes any abandonment a major trauma. The powerful defense called '''dissociation''' was needed to erase the event from their consciousness. The memory of the rejecting parent, along with the  memory of the child's response to that parent, are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the child to continue loving a parent that he sees as completely supportive. Once dissociated, these memories of the child in relationship to the parent become internal ego structures over time. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent must be dissociated, for if the child were to \"see\" this reality it would destroy his dependency relationship on the parent and he would face an abandonment crisis. In addition to the memories of the rejecting parent (The '''Rejecting Object''' in Fairbairn's model) the child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions. Fairbairn called the ego structure that develops from the dissociated memories of  the child's  self  as he reacted to the parent's rejection of him and his legitimate needs, the '''Antilibidinal Ego'''. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized Rejecting Object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden: \n\n\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either\" (Odgen,2018)<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|chapter=Why read Fairbairn? *|date=2018-03-08|pages=131\u2013146|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8|doi=10.4324/9780429474538-12|title=Fairbairn and the Object Relations Tradition}}</ref>  \n\nWithin the child's inner world (his unconscious) '''the Antilibidinal Ego relates only to the \"Rejecting Object\",''' and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious '''Central Ego''' that is in contact with the acceptable aspects of the parent (the '''Ideal Object''') and with external reality.  In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  This fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the '''Exciting Object''' by Fairbairn, and the child's self that relates to it was called the '''Libidinal Ego''' (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it, while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is always out of reach. \n\nThese two unconscious pairs: \n* The '''Antilibidinal Ego''' that relates to the '''Rejecting Object''', and \n* the '''Libidinal Ego''' that relates only to the '''Exciting Object''' \nare unknown to each other and to the Central Ego. '''Splitting''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole Object. Thus, the individual  never develops \"object constancy\" which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of childhood development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  Libidinal Ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and minutes later says \"I love you, Mommy\". There is no memory of the other ego state. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref>\n\n'''Fairbairn's Structural Model'''\n\nEmotional deprivation, and the resulting fear of abandonment, leads to splitting of the ego, and the split ego eventuates into Fairbairn's Structural Theory. As just described, the psyche is split into three pairs of selves that relate to three separate objects:\n* The Central Ego relates to the Ideal Object\n* The Antilibidinal Ego relates to the Rejecting Object\n* The Libidinal Ego relates to the Exciting Object\n\nThe three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are '''unaware''' of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious Central Ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's Central Ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. \n\nIn less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his Central Ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego has lost sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  The ratio of conscious to unconscious structures shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the Libidinal Ego seeking the key to the love that it assumes  (incorrectly) is stored in their parent (the Exciting Object''')'''. This powerful unconscious influences the weakened Central Ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> \n\n'''Transference, Resistance and Repetition Compulsions'''\n\nWhen any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html 'Fairbairn's Structural Model'], Richard L.

{"title_page": "History of surfing", "text_new": "{{More footnotes|date=August 2015}}\nThe riding of [[wind waves|waves]] has likely existed since humans began swimming in the [[ocean]]. In this sense, [[bodysurfing]] is the oldest type of wave-catching. Standing up on what is now called a [[surfboard]] is a relatively recent innovation developed by the [[Polynesians]]. The influences for modern [[surfing]] can be directly traced to the surfers of [[Ancient Hawaii|pre-contact Hawaii]].\n\n[[File:Kahaluu Canoe Landing.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Kahaluu Bay|Kahalu{{okina}}u Bay]] was the site of an ancient surfing temple.]]\n\n== Polynesian origins ==\nThe art of surfing, known as ''he\u02bbe \u02bbana'' (''he\u02bbe'' means ''to surf'', and ''\u02bbana'' is the [[Nominalization|nominalizing]] particle) in the [[Hawaiian language]], was recorded by Joseph Banks aboard [[HMS Endeavour]] during the first voyage of [[James Cook]], during the ship's stay in [[Tahiti]]. Surfing was a central part of ancient [[Polynesian culture]] and predates European contact.  The chief (Ali'i) was traditionally the most skilled wave rider in the community with the best board made from the best wood. The ruling class had the best beaches and the best boards, and the commoners were not allowed on the same beaches, but they could gain prestige by their ability to ride the surf on their boards.\n\nIn Tahiti and Samoa surfing was a popular pastime that was often used as part of warriors' training. Warriors often paddled to surf breaks and were recorded in print by early European historians as spending many hours bravely paddling head-on into large surf and riding waves. Canoes often accompanied\nsurfing parties and the men would often swap between canoeing and paddling boards, and then catch fish after their recreational activities. In Hawai'i, surfing became ingrained into the very fabric of Hawaii'an religion and culture.\n\nThe sport was also recorded in print by other European residents and visitors who wrote about and photographed [[Samoa]]ns surfing on planks and single canoe hulls; Samoans referred to surf riding as ''fa'ase'e'' or ''se'egalu.'' Edward Treager also confirmed Samoan terminology for surfing and surfboards in Samoa. Oral tradition confirms that surfing was also practiced in [[Tonga]], where the late king [[Taufa'ahau Tupou IV]] was the foremost Tongan surfer of his time.\n\n== Pre-Incan Per\u00fa origins and debate ==\n\nThe practice of riding a vessel with a wave was practiced since the Pre-Incan civilization (Mochica/[[Moche culture]]) around 2000 years ago and continued in the [[Chimu culture]]. The vessels the Mochica people used were called\n\"[[Caballitos de Totora]]\", ('Straw SeaHorses'). Although the Mochica used the Caballitos de Totora for fishing purposes, it is also possible that they were used for fun, as their archaeology suggests. It is also likely that the Mochica people did in fact 'surf for fun' given that the longest rideable wave in the world, 'Chicama,' was within their empire.<ref>http://briancampagna.com/chicama-peru/</ref> [[Puerto Chicama|Chicama]] is located in Puerto Malabrigo, La Libertad, close to the city of Trujillo, Peru. To this day Caballitos de Totora are still used by local fishermen and can also be ridden by tourists for recreational purposes.\n\nIt is questioned whether this is the first observed form of surfing, given that the Mochica/Chimu also used a paddle/stick to displace themselves in the ocean, thus the Caballito de Totora has a closer resemblance to Stand-Up Paddle boarding than surfing.\n\n==Ancient Hawaii==\nThe [[ancient Hawaii]]an people did not consider surfing a mere recreational activity, [[hobby]], [[extreme sport]], or [[career]] as it is viewed today. Rather, the Hawaiian people integrated surfing into their [[culture]] and made surfing more of an [[art]] than anything else.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} They referred to this art as ''he{{okina}}e nalu'' which translates into [[English language|English]] as \"wave sliding.\" The art began before entering the mysterious ocean as the Hawaiians prayed to the gods for protection and strength to undertake the powerful mystifying ocean. If the ocean was tamed, frustrated surfers would call upon the ''[[kahuna]]'' (priest), who would aid them in a surfing prayer asking the gods to deliver great surf. Prior to entering the ocean, the priest would also aid the surfers (mainly of the upper class) in undertaking the spiritual ceremony of constructing a surfboard.\n\nHawaiians would carefully select one of three types of trees. The trees included the ''koa'' (''[[Acacia koa]]''), ''{{okina}}ulu'' (''[[Breadfruit|Artocarpus altilis]]''), and ''[[wiliwili]]'' (''Erythrina sandwicensis'') trees. Once selected, the surfer would dig the tree out and place fish in the hole as an offering to the gods. Selected craftsmen of the community were then hired to shape, stain, and prepare the board for the surfer. There were three primary shapes: the ''{{okina}}olo'', ''kiko{{okina}}o'', and the ''[[alaia]]''. The ''{{okina}}olo'' is thick in the middle and gradually gets thinner towards the edges. The ''kiko{{okina}}o'' ranges in length from {{convert|12|to|18|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|round=10}} and requires great skill to maneuver. The ''alaia'' board is around {{convert|9|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|round=5}} long and requires great skill to ride and master. Aside from the preparatory stages prior to entering the water, the most skilled surfers were often of the upper class including chiefs and warriors that surfed amongst the best waves on the island. These upper class Hawaiians gained respect through their enduring ability to master the waves and this art the Hawaiians referred to as surfing.<ref>{{cite web |author=Veronica Britton |url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04/Britton/default.htm |year=2004 |title=The Sport of Kings |accessdate=2009-11-07 |publisher= [[University of Florida]] Interactive Media Lab }}</ref>\nSome ancient sites still popular today include [[Kahaluu Bay|Kahalu{{okina}}u Bay]] and [[Holualoa Bay]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/about/pdfs/kic_brochure.pdf |title=Ho\u02bbiho\u02bbi Kulana Wahi pana - Restoring Sacred Places |publisher=brochure published by Kamehameha Investment Corporation |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-11-07}}</ref>\n\n== Post-Contact Hawaii ==\nAfter [[History of Hawaii#Contact|contact]] with the [[Western world|Western World]] Hawaiian culture was [[History of Hawaii|forced to change]].

Local Hawaiians, mixed with imported workers from Asia, were put to work on sugar plantations and Protestant missionaries attempted to turn the population [[Christianity and colonialism|from their traditional beliefs into Christians]]. Along with the suppression of traditional culture was the suppression of surfing, often viewed as frivolous.\n\nIt was not until [[Waikiki]] became a tourist destination that surfing began a resurgence in popularity. Particularly wealthy Americans came to the beach and saw the locals occasionally surfing what had long been an established surf break, Waikiki, and wanted to try it. [[Mark Twain]] attempted it but failed in 1866. [[Jack London]] tried it while visiting, then chronicled it enthusiastically in an essay entitled \"A Royal Sport\" published in October 1907. In 1908 Alexander Hume Ford founded the Outrigger Canoe and Surfing Club the first modern organization developed to promote surfing broadly, although it was de facto whites-only and women weren't admitted until 1926. Local Hawaiians started their own club in 1911 called Hui Nalu, meaning \"Club of the Waves\". But the first surf icons who gained widespread recognition, [[George Freeth]] and [[Duke Kahanamoku]], became famous for practicing their traditional sport and helped spread it from Waikiki to around the world.\n\nAs the news of this new sport began to spread, locals in Waikiki began giving lessons and demonstrations for tourists. This was the basis of the Waikiki Beach Boys, a loose groups of mostly native Hawaiians who hung out at the beach, surfed daily, and taught wealthy [[haole]] tourists how to ride waves. This was also known as the Hawaiian boarder-land, where white hegemony was uncertain and Natives inverted dominant social categories.<ref name=\":0\" /> A borderland is a place where differences converge and social norms are often fluid. Because state-sanctioned authority is often absent from the borderlands, unique social and cultural identities are formed there.This was  the foundation of a continual element of surf culture, repeated around the globe innumerable times and continuing to this day: people who, for at least a time, dedicate most of their daily lives to living on or around the beach and surfing as much as they can. These groups in Hawaii, and following in Australia, California, and South Africa, laid the foundation for modern surf culture around the world.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==North America==\n\n{{See also|Surfing in the United States}}\n\nIn July 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes took a break from their boarding school, St. Mathew's Hall in San Mateo, and came to cool off in Santa Cruz, California. There, David Kawananakoa, Edward Keli\u02bbiahonui and Jonah K\u016bhi\u014d Kalaniana'ole surfed the mouth of the San Lorenzo River on custom-shaped redwood boards, according to surf historians Kim Stoner and Geoff Dunn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gtweekly.com/santa-cruz-news/good-times-cover-stories/936-riders-of-the-sea-spray.html|title=Riders of the Sea Spray - Santa Cruz Good Times|author=GTWebmaster|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref>\nIn 1907 [[George Freeth]] was brought to California from Hawaii, to demonstrate surfboard riding as a publicity stunt to promote the opening of the Los Angeles-Redondo-Huntington railroad owned by [[Henry E.

Surfing progressed tremendously in the 20th century, through innovations in board design and ever increasing public exposure.\n\nSurfing's development and culture was centered primarily in three locations: Hawaii, Australia, and California, although the first footage of surfing in the UK was in 1929 by Louis Rosenberg and a number of friends after being fascinated by watching some Australian surfers. In 1959 the release of the film [[Gidget]], based on the life of surfer [[Kathy Kohner-Zuckerman]], boosted the sport's popularity immensely, moving surfing from an [[Subculture|underground culture]] into a national [[fad]] and packing many surf breaks with sudden and previously unheard of crowds. [[B-movie]]s and [[surf music]] such as the [[Beach Boys]] and [[Surfaris]] based on surfing and Southern California beach culture ([[Beach Party film]]s) as it exploded, formed most of the world's first ideas of surfing and surfers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  This conception was revised again in the 1980s, with newer mainstream portrayals of surfers represented by characters like Jeff Spicoli from ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''.\n\n[[File:Oxnard, Ormond Beach surfing 1975.jpg|thumb|Surfing at Ormond Beach in [[Oxnard]], California, in 1975]]\nThe anonymous sleeve notes on the 1962 album ''Surfin' Safari'', the first album to be released on the Capitol label by The Beach Boys, include a rather tongue-in-cheek description of the sport of surfing thus:<blockquote>\"For those not familiar with the latest craze to invade the sun-drenched Pacific coast of Southern California, here is a definition of \"surfing\" - a water sport in which the participant stands on a floating slab of wood, resembling an ironing board in both size and shape, and attempts to remain perpendicular while being hurtled toward the shore at a rather frightening rate of speed on the crest of a huge wave (especially recommended for teen-agers and all others without the slightest regard for either life or limb).\"</blockquote>\n\nRegardless of its usually erroneous portrayal in the media, true surfing culture continued to evolve quietly by itself, changing decade by decade. From the 1960s fad years to the creation and evolution of the [[shortboard|short board]] in the late 60s and early 70s to the performance hotdogging of the neon-drenched 1980s and the epic professional surfing of the 1990s (typified by [[Kelly Slater]], the \"[[Michael Jordan]] of Surfing\").

Most often all three go together, but sometimes well-known professionals excel in only one.\n\nIf a professional surfer is someone who makes money from surfing (not including teaching) than the history of professional surfing dates to perhaps 1959 when the first West Coast Surfing Championships was held in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. Previously there had been innumerable amateur competitions, from the ancient Hawaiians themselves who were known to wager on the outcomes, to multiple iterations of surf competition as some form of race (commonly starting from shore, paddling to a buoy, then catching a wave back to shore).\n\nIn 1961 the United States Surfing Association (USSA) was founded, arguably the first proto-professional surfing contest organization. This was also about the time when surfing switched from basic action: simply riding a good wave, to a more style oriented endeavor where turns, tricks, and artistry began to become important. Becoming even more important than catching the best wave and staying on it for the longest possible time, which had previously been the primary goal, and seemed self-evident to earlier surfers.\n\nThrough numerous iterations of the surf contest and small sponsorships, very few people ever made a living from surfing alone (by not teaching or producing signature model boards or clothing) until the 1970s. As described in the documentary [[Bustin' Down the Door]] much of the prestige and money to be made from contest surfing resided in Hawaii, specifically the increasingly important epicenter of worldwide performance-surfing: the [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]] of [[Oahu]]. But when Australians and South Africans showed up to join the Californians who had been migrating there in waves for nearly 20 year tensions arose between not only the Americans and international surfers, but between the local Hawaiians and the [[haoles]] generally.\n\nInto the 1980s surfing saw its second boost of wider popular recognition (the first being from [[Gidget (film)|Gidget]]) with new neon colors, increasing shortboard performance, more professional surfers, and a number of surf brands becoming trendy beyond surfing, such as [[Town & Country Surf Designs]] and [[Body Glove]]. The pro surfers of the 1980s were able to make more money, get more exposure, and generally survive longer with no job other than contest surfing and sponsorship.\n[[File:Professional_surfing.jpg|thumb|A surfer dropping in]]\n\n==Technological innovations in surfing==\n\nSurfing has been an internationally co-developed sport since its early spread beyond Hawaii, and has been highly influenced by (and generally welcoming of) new technology. There are no standards or committees to rule surfboard design or progression. Change has been rampant. Surfers generally pick styles and materials based on performance, feeling, and price. Surfboard shapers can be global name-brand professionals, local artisans, or even backyard amateurs. Unlike many other sports, the high variability and subtle performance differences in the main apparatus, the surfboard, is fundamental to both the experience and history. While many other sports standardize their equipment, in surfing, diversity in craft-design played a huge part in its history and still ongoing culture.\n\nMuch of the last century of surf history has been defined by new eras of technology which often fundamentally changed the experience. Surfers themselves have often developed, altered, or anticipated new technology to grant increased access to previously unsurfed waves and places. And unlike many other sports, the secondary equipment became almost as important as the core surfboard, a prime example being the [[wetsuit]]. The worldwide history of surfing could easily be divided between pre-wetsuit and post-wetsuit, because it expanded the potential to surf places previously far too cold, which comprised a vast amount of un-surfed worldwide coastline. On a similar basis, surfing history could justifiably be divided between pre-[[polystyrene]] and post-polystyrene surfboards, or pre-[[Surfboard fin|fin]] and post-fin as the original Hawaiian boards did not have fins until [[Tom Blake (surfer)|Tom Blake]] added one in 1935. Technology has changed surfing repeatedly and dramatically throughout its modern development, generally making the sport more accessible, cheaper, easier, and raising the level of performance.\n\nMuch of this change has also come from the fact that surfing was originally, and for many decades into the modern era, primarily a tropical or summertime only warm water sport, and a [[Developed World|developed-world]] sport, making its early range quite limited. But after the arrival of mass-produced [[fiberglass]] boards, quality [[wetsuit]]s, [[Off-road vehicle|offroad vehicles]], and inexpensive international [[Jet Age|travel]], surfing became accessible along many parts of the world's coasts which were previously unthinkable or unknown as surf spots. Travelers thereby introduced the sport and equipment to the local coastal peoples of even very remote places. By the 21st century much of the worldwide coast line has been explored and local peoples surf in nearly every country with access to waves. Yet unlike many other aspects of human expansion, there remain surf breaks as yet never ridden by humans, often in remote or treacherous corners of the globe, politically unstable areas, or around uninhabited islands, many which might yet reveal great surf spots in the future.\n[[File:Surfboard_technology.jpg|thumb|A quiver of surfboards]]\n\n===The Short Board Revolution===\n\nThe ancient Hawaiians had mainly three type of board: Olo, Alaia, and Paipo. The Olo was 15 to 20 feet long and solid wood. They were very difficult to make and reserved for the upper classes. The Alai was only 6 or 7 feet long and usually much thinner. The Paipo was even smaller and similar to a modern body board. None of these had a fin.\n\nThroughout the first half of the 20th century nearly all modern surfboads were longboards, generally 9 feet or longer, although after the 1930s they began to shift away from being solid dense wood and shifted to lighter materials like balsa wood and eventually various forms of polystyrene, which still dominate to this day.\n\nThroughout the decades shapers had occasionally made smaller boards, often as novelties, experiments, or specifically designed for small-statured people, but the popularity of those designs was slow to rise. During the surboard production boom of the 1960s the predominantly male shapers would sometimes construct specifically smaller boards for girls (who are often lighter and shorter, affecting weight/length requirements for paddling). But often they ended up surfing those small boards themselves because the style of surfing was different and increasingly mid-wave turns were growing in popularity. One basic reason for longer and thicker boards generally is they paddle faster. But faster waves were also becoming more popular; waves with narrower take off zones. By the early 1970s, shortboards began rise dramatically in popularity, not just as novelty but fulltime craft. So design innovation was not far behind. By the 1980s the styles have become very refined and the second large burst of surf-culture popularity in the mainstream occurred as the 3-fin, 6-foot-tall \"thruster\" shortboard began to take over. A generally narrow board with small variance in design, it almost always has three fins, a pointed nose, a squash tail, and is approximately the height of the rider. This basic style of board, with many small modifications, has been the dominant craft since the 1980s and is still the approximation of the modern professional surfboard. In 21st century professional surfing it has slowly become shorter and wider, with a more rounded nose and sometimes 4-fins (rarely 2-fins and never 1-fin), although non-professionals still regularly mix and match all those options based on personal taste.\n\n==Style versus performance==\n\n\"What is the purpose of surfing?\" has long been philosophically debated in and out of surf culture. Often the entire endeavor has been viewed in the popular media as a waste of time, or the occupation of slackers. For the most part surfing is agreed to be purely recreational, as it did not develop from, or turn into, a useful mode of daily transportation (as opposed to [[skiing]] or [[skateboarding]], which can be both). Therefore in judging and appreciating surfing there has always been varying opinions about what is necessary, stylish, extravagant, and/or functional.\n\nThe variety and size of waves varies tremendously, as does surf craft, and to some degree even the medium. Harnessing the momentum of a wave for travel is the loosest definition of surfing, so in popular culture the term is often applied to many forms of expanded \"surfing\". Particually \"surfing the web\" is a particular common example. But also characters like The Silver Surfer have taken the notion of surfing into science fiction.\n\nThere are also those who view surfing in a religious context. Certainly for the ancient Hawaiians this component was important because the ocean was viewed as a deity. Yet also in modern surfing it is common for surfing to refer to it as some form of church or mass.\n\n==Surfing's Impact on Popular Culture==\n\nComparatively small and localized surfing cultures have repeatedly generated surprisingly large influence upon popular culture, particularly in the United States of America and Australia, as well as upon the global consciousness of surfing as a form of recreation. Since the expansion of surfing in the mid-20th century, there have been numerous coastal towns that were situated near good surf breaks, whose citizens did not yet know about modern surfing, and so did not even realize it was a rare commodity.\n\nIn America and Australia the culture of surfing has influenced popular culture in periodic fads, starting with novels, movies, and the early 1960s TV show, [[Gidget]]. The attention that surfing gets in the popular culture has waxed and waned, much like other niche sports.\n\nFashions developed within surf culture have had a large worldwide impact numerous times from the 1960s to the present. A number of large clothing brands began as surfing brands, including but not limited to: OP, Stussy, Billabong, Quicksilver, Roxy, Hurley, O'neill, Ripcurl, RVCA, Vans, Volcom, Reef, and Da Kine. One of the largest influences is probably the worldwide adoption of [[boardshorts]] as swim gear for men.\n\n==Alternatives to wind-generated waves==\n\nSince their invention, surfers have sometimes used [[wave pools]] to attempt surfing, but generally the waves were too small and not well formed enough for an enjoyable experience. The 1987 movie [[North Shore (1987 film)|North Shore]] started the protagonist in an Arizona wave pool, then going on to Hawaii to try his luck. Both in and out of the movie this was considered basically a joke. But more recently, multiple attempts have been made to construct wave pools specifically designed for surfing. As of 2020 there are only few around the world open to the public, but with many more currently in development. 2018 was the first year a professional surfing contest was held at a wave pool, specifically: ''Kelly Slater's Surf Ranch''.\n\n[[Wakeboarding]] is a popular type of surfing done behind a boat's wake. There are also sometimes standing waves in rivers at high flow which can be [[River surfing|surfable]]. At certain times of year on large rivers, [[River surfing#Tidal bores|tidal bores are surfable]]. People have also surfed alongside large [[cargo ships]] as their wakes roll into shallower water, and a few people have even surfed the waves caused by calving glaciers.\nThe Wave Bristol opened in The UK as an inland artificial surf site.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.thewave.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAz53vBRCpARIsAPPsz8Wmho9IiozSDyOcdz-YTIiGTQMLqpaYKiWdehYiAkBxR89gaETJxykaAiKSEALw_wcB|title=The Wave|website=www.thewave.com|accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n;General\n*Quinn, Richard. \"Region's First Surfboard Evokes a Wave of Nostalgia\" The Virginian Pilot.

In this sense, [[bodysurfing]] is the oldest type of wave-catching. Standing up on what is now called a [[surfboard]] is a relatively recent innovation developed by the [[Polynesians]]. The influences for modern [[surfing]] can be directly traced to the surfers of [[Ancient Hawaii|pre-contact Hawaii]].\n\n[[File:Kahaluu Canoe Landing.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Kahaluu Bay|Kahalu{{okina}}u Bay]] was the site of an ancient surfing temple.]]\n\n== Polynesian origins ==\nThe art of surfing, known as ''he\u02bbe \u02bbana'' (''he\u02bbe'' means ''to surf'', and ''\u02bbana'' is the [[Nominalization|nominalizing]] particle) in the [[Hawaiian language]], was recorded by Joseph Banks aboard [[HMS Endeavour]] during the first voyage of [[James Cook]], during the ship's stay in [[Tahiti]]. Surfing was a central part of ancient [[Polynesian culture]] and predates European contact.  The chief (Ali'i) was traditionally the most skilled wave rider in the community with the best board made from the best wood. The ruling class had the best beaches and the best boards, and the commoners were not allowed on the same beaches, but they could gain prestige by their ability to ride the surf on their boards.\n\nIn Tahiti and Samoa surfing was a popular pastime that was often used as part of warriors' training. Warriors often paddled to surf breaks and were recorded in print by early European historians as spending many hours bravely paddling head-on into large surf and riding waves. Canoes often accompanied\nsurfing parties and the men would often swap between canoeing and paddling boards, and then catch fish after their recreational activities. In Hawai'i, surfing became ingrained into the very fabric of Hawaii'an religion and culture.\n\nThe sport was also recorded in print by other European residents and visitors who wrote about and photographed [[Samoa]]ns surfing on planks and single canoe hulls; Samoans referred to surf riding as ''fa'ase'e'' or ''se'egalu.'' Edward Treager also confirmed Samoan terminology for surfing and surfboards in Samoa. Oral tradition confirms that surfing was also practiced in [[Tonga]], where the late king [[Taufa'ahau Tupou IV]] was the foremost Tongan surfer of his time.\n\n== Pre-Incan Per\u00fa origins and debate ==\n\nThe practice of riding a vessel with a wave was practiced since the Pre-Incan civilization (Mochica/[[Moche culture]]) around 2000 years ago and continued in the [[Chimu culture]]. The vessels the Mochica people used were called\n\"[[Caballitos de Totora]]\", ('Straw SeaHorses'). Although the Mochica used the Caballitos de Totora for fishing purposes, it is also possible that they were used for fun, as their archaeology suggests. It is also likely that the Mochica people did in fact 'surf for fun' given that the longest rideable wave in the world, 'Chicama,' was within their empire.<ref>http://briancampagna.com/chicama-peru/</ref> [[Puerto Chicama|Chicama]] is located in Puerto Malabrigo, La Libertad, close to the city of Trujillo, Peru. To this day Caballitos de Totora are still used by local fishermen and can also be ridden by tourists for recreational purposes.\n\nIt is questioned whether this is the first observed form of surfing, given that the Mochica/Chimu also used a paddle/stick to displace themselves in the ocean, thus the Caballito de Totora has a closer resemblance to Stand-Up Paddle boarding than surfing.\n\n==Ancient Hawaii==\nThe [[ancient Hawaii]]an people did not consider surfing a mere recreational activity, [[hobby]], [[extreme sport]], or [[career]] as it is viewed today. Rather, the Hawaiian people integrated surfing into their [[culture]] and made surfing more of an [[art]] than anything else.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} They referred to this art as ''he{{okina}}e nalu'' which translates into [[English language|English]] as \"wave sliding.\" The art began before entering the mysterious ocean as the Hawaiians prayed to the gods for protection and strength to undertake the powerful mystifying ocean. If the ocean was tamed, frustrated surfers would call upon the ''[[kahuna]]'' (priest), who would aid them in a surfing prayer asking the gods to deliver great surf. Prior to entering the ocean, the priest would also aid the surfers (mainly of the upper class) in undertaking the spiritual ceremony of constructing a surfboard.\n\nHawaiians would carefully select one of three types of trees. The trees included the ''koa'' (''[[Acacia koa]]''), ''{{okina}}ulu'' (''[[Breadfruit|Artocarpus altilis]]''), and ''[[wiliwili]]'' (''Erythrina sandwicensis'') trees. Once selected, the surfer would dig the tree out and place fish in the hole as an offering to the gods. Selected craftsmen of the community were then hired to shape, stain, and prepare the board for the surfer. There were three primary shapes: the ''{{okina}}olo'', ''kiko{{okina}}o'', and the ''[[alaia]]''. The ''{{okina}}olo'' is thick in the middle and gradually gets thinner towards the edges. The ''kiko{{okina}}o'' ranges in length from {{convert|12|to|18|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|round=10}} and requires great skill to maneuver. The ''alaia'' board is around {{convert|9|ft|cm|order=flip|abbr=on|round=5}} long and requires great skill to ride and master. Aside from the preparatory stages prior to entering the water, the most skilled surfers were often of the upper class including chiefs and warriors that surfed amongst the best waves on the island. These upper class Hawaiians gained respect through their enduring ability to master the waves and this art the Hawaiians referred to as surfing.<ref>{{cite web |author=Veronica Britton |url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04/Britton/default.htm |year=2004 |title=The Sport of Kings |accessdate=2009-11-07 |publisher= [[University of Florida]] Interactive Media Lab }}</ref>\nSome ancient sites still popular today include [[Kahaluu Bay|Kahalu{{okina}}u Bay]] and [[Holualoa Bay]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/about/pdfs/kic_brochure.pdf |title=Ho\u02bbiho\u02bbi Kulana Wahi pana - Restoring Sacred Places |publisher=brochure published by Kamehameha Investment Corporation |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-11-07}}</ref>\n\n== Post-Contact Hawaii ==\nAfter [[History of Hawaii#Contact|contact]] with the [[Western world|Western World]] Hawaiian culture was [[History of Hawaii|forced to change]].

Local Hawaiians, mixed with imported workers from Asia, were put to work on sugar plantations and Protestant missionaries attempted to turn the population [[Christianity and colonialism|from their traditional beliefs into Christians]]. Along with the suppression of traditional culture was the suppression of surfing, often viewed as frivolous.\n\nIt was not until [[Waikiki]] became a tourist destination that surfing began a resurgence in popularity. Particularly wealthy Americans came to the beach and saw the locals occasionally surfing what had long been an established surf break, Waikiki, and wanted to try it. [[Mark Twain]] attempted it but failed in 1866. [[Jack London]] tried it while visiting, then chronicled it enthusiastically in an essay entitled \"A Royal Sport\" published in October 1907. In 1908 Alexander Hume Ford founded the Outrigger Canoe and Surfing Club the first modern organization developed to promote surfing broadly, although it was de facto whites-only and women weren't admitted until 1926. Local Hawaiians started their own club in 1911 called Hui Nalu, meaning \"Club of the Waves\". But the first surf icons who gained widespread recognition, [[George Freeth]] and [[Duke Kahanamoku]], became famous for practicing their traditional sport and helped spread it from Waikiki to around the world.\n\nAs the news of this new sport began to spread, locals in Waikiki began giving lessons and demonstrations for tourists. This was the basis of the Waikiki Beach Boys, a loose groups of mostly native Hawaiians who hung out at the beach, surfed daily, and taught wealthy [[haole]] tourists how to ride waves. This was also known as the Hawaiian boarder-land, where white hegemony was uncertain and Natives inverted dominant social categories.<ref name=\":0\" /> A borderland is a place where differences converge and social norms are often fluid. Because state-sanctioned authority is often absent from the borderlands, unique social and cultural identities are formed there.This was  the foundation of a continual element of surf culture, repeated around the globe innumerable times and continuing to this day: people who, for at least a time, dedicate most of their daily lives to living on or around the beach and surfing as much as they can. These groups in Hawaii, and following in Australia, California, and South Africa, laid the foundation for modern surf culture around the world.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==North America==\n\n{{See also|Surfing in the United States}}\n\nIn July 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes took a break from their boarding school, St. Mathew's Hall in San Mateo, and came to cool off in Santa Cruz, California.

Surfing progressed tremendously in the 20th century, through innovations in board design and ever increasing public exposure.\n\nSurfing's development and culture was centered primarily in three locations: Hawaii, Australia, and California, although the first footage of surfing in the UK was in 1929 by Louis Rosenberg and a number of friends after being fascinated by watching some Australian surfers. In 1959 the release of the film [[Gidget]], based on the life of surfer [[Kathy Kohner-Zuckerman]], boosted the sport's popularity immensely, moving surfing from an [[Subculture|underground culture]] into a national [[fad]] and packing many surf breaks with sudden and previously unheard of crowds. [[B-movie]]s and [[surf music]] such as the [[Beach Boys]] and [[Surfaris]] based on surfing and Southern California beach culture ([[Beach Party film]]s) as it exploded, formed most of the world's first ideas of surfing and surfers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  This conception was revised again in the 1980s, with newer mainstream portrayals of surfers represented by characters like Jeff Spicoli from ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''.\n\n[[File:Oxnard, Ormond Beach surfing 1975.jpg|thumb|Surfing at Ormond Beach in [[Oxnard]], California, in 1975]]\nThe anonymous sleeve notes on the 1962 album ''Surfin' Safari'', the first album to be released on the Capitol label by The Beach Boys, include a rather tongue-in-cheek description of the sport of surfing thus:<blockquote>\"For those not familiar with the latest craze to invade the sun-drenched Pacific coast of Southern California, here is a definition of \"surfing\" - a water sport in which the participant stands on a floating slab of wood, resembling an ironing board in both size and shape, and attempts to remain perpendicular while being hurtled toward the shore at a rather frightening rate of speed on the crest of a huge wave (especially recommended for teen-agers and all others without the slightest regard for either life or limb).\"</blockquote>\n\nRegardless of its usually erroneous portrayal in the media, true surfing culture continued to evolve quietly by itself, changing decade by decade. From the 1960s fad years to the creation and evolution of the [[shortboard|short board]] in the late 60s and early 70s to the performance hotdogging of the neon-drenched 1980s and the epic professional surfing of the 1990s (typified by [[Kelly Slater]], the \"[[Michael Jordan]] of Surfing\"). In 1975, professional contests started.<ref name=\"Woman of the Year\">{{cite web|url=http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html|title=Woman of the Year|publisher=|accessdate=8 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806224253/http://www.surfingwalkoffame.com/woman/Oberg.html|archive-date=6 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> That year [[Margo Oberg]] became the first female professional surfer.<ref name=\"Woman of the Year\"/>\n\n[[Surf film|Surfing documentaries]] have been one of the main ways in which [[surf culture|surfing culture]] grows and replenishes itself, not just as a sport but as an art form, the style and quality of surf films have often tracked well the evolution of the sport.\n\n==Professional surfing==\n\nDefining the scope of professional surfing is difficult, because like in many [[extreme sport]]s, there is more than one model for what constitutes a professional. There are three main contemporary modes of making money purely as an active surfer: [[sponsorship]], [[World Surf League|surf contests]], and [[internet celebrity|social media influence]]. Most often all three go together, but sometimes well-known professionals excel in only one.\n\nIf a professional surfer is someone who makes money from surfing (not including teaching) than the history of professional surfing dates to perhaps 1959 when the first West Coast Surfing Championships was held in [[Huntington Beach, California]]. Previously there had been innumerable amateur competitions, from the ancient Hawaiians themselves who were known to wager on the outcomes, to multiple iterations of surf competition as some form of race (commonly starting from shore, paddling to a buoy, then catching a wave back to shore).\n\nIn 1961 the United States Surfing Association (USSA) was founded, arguably the first proto-professional surfing contest organization. This was also about the time when surfing switched from basic action: simply riding a good wave, to a more style oriented endeavor where turns, tricks, and artistry began to become important. Becoming even more important than catching the best wave and staying on it for the longest possible time, which had previously been the primary goal, and seemed self-evident to earlier surfers.\n\nThrough numerous iterations of the surf contest and small sponsorships, very few people ever made a living from surfing alone (by not teaching or producing signature model boards or clothing) until the 1970s. As described in the documentary [[Bustin' Down the Door]] much of the prestige and money to be made from contest surfing resided in Hawaii, specifically the increasingly important epicenter of worldwide performance-surfing: the [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]] of [[Oahu]]. But when Australians and South Africans showed up to join the Californians who had been migrating there in waves for nearly 20 year tensions arose between not only the Americans and international surfers, but between the local Hawaiians and the [[haoles]] generally.\n\nInto the 1980s surfing saw its second boost of wider popular recognition (the first being from [[Gidget (film)|Gidget]]) with new neon colors, increasing shortboard performance, more professional surfers, and a number of surf brands becoming trendy beyond surfing, such as [[Town & Country Surf Designs]] and [[Body Glove]]. The pro surfers of the 1980s were able to make more money, get more exposure, and generally survive longer with no job other than contest surfing and sponsorship.\n[[File:Professional_surfing.jpg|thumb|A surfer dropping in]]\n\n==Technological innovations in surfing==\n\nSurfing has been an internationally co-developed sport since its early spread beyond Hawaii, and has been highly influenced by (and generally welcoming of) new technology. There are no standards or committees to rule surfboard design or progression. Change has been rampant. Surfers generally pick styles and materials based on performance, feeling, and price. Surfboard shapers can be global name-brand professionals, local artisans, or even backyard amateurs. Unlike many other sports, the high variability and subtle performance differences in the main apparatus, the surfboard, is fundamental to both the experience and history. While many other sports standardize their equipment, in surfing, diversity in craft-design played a huge part in its history and still ongoing culture.\n\nMuch of the last century of surf history has been defined by new eras of technology which often fundamentally changed the experience. Surfers themselves have often developed, altered, or anticipated new technology to grant increased access to previously unsurfed waves and places. And unlike many other sports, the secondary equipment became almost as important as the core surfboard, a prime example being the [[wetsuit]]. The worldwide history of surfing could easily be divided between pre-wetsuit and post-wetsuit, because it expanded the potential to surf places previously far too cold, which comprised a vast amount of un-surfed worldwide coastline. On a similar basis, surfing history could justifiably be divided between pre-[[polystyrene]] and post-polystyrene surfboards, or pre-[[Surfboard fin|fin]] and post-fin as the original Hawaiian boards did not have fins until [[Tom Blake (surfer)|Tom Blake]] added one in 1935. Technology has changed surfing repeatedly and dramatically throughout its modern development, generally making the sport more accessible, cheaper, easier, and raising the level of performance.\n\nMuch of this change has also come from the fact that surfing was originally, and for many decades into the modern era, primarily a tropical or summertime only warm water sport, and a [[Developed World|developed-world]] sport, making its early range quite limited. But after the arrival of mass-produced [[fiberglass]] boards, quality [[wetsuit]]s, [[Off-road vehicle|offroad vehicles]], and inexpensive international [[Jet Age|travel]], surfing became accessible along many parts of the world's coasts which were previously unthinkable or unknown as surf spots. Travelers thereby introduced the sport and equipment to the local coastal peoples of even very remote places. By the 21st century much of the worldwide coast line has been explored and local peoples surf in nearly every country with access to waves. Yet unlike many other aspects of human expansion, there remain surf breaks as yet never ridden by humans, often in remote or treacherous corners of the globe, politically unstable areas, or around uninhabited islands, many which might yet reveal great surf spots in the future.\n[[File:Surfboard_technology.jpg|thumb|A quiver of surfboards]]\n\n===The Short Board Revolution===\n\nThe ancient Hawaiians had mainly three type of board: Olo, Alaia, and Paipo. The Olo was 15 to 20 feet long and solid wood. They were very difficult to make and reserved for the upper classes. The Alai was only 6 or 7 feet long and usually much thinner. The Paipo was even smaller and similar to a modern body board. None of these had a fin.\n\nThroughout the first half of the 20th century nearly all modern surfboads were longboards, generally 9 feet or longer, although after the 1930s they began to shift away from being solid dense wood and shifted to lighter materials like balsa wood and eventually various forms of polystyrene, which still dominate to this day.\n\nThroughout the decades shapers had occasionally made smaller boards, often as novelties, experiments, or specifically designed for small-statured people, but the popularity of those designs was slow to rise. During the surboard production boom of the 1960s the predominantly male shapers would sometimes construct specifically smaller boards for girls (who are often lighter and shorter, affecting weight/length requirements for paddling). But often they ended up surfing those small boards themselves because the style of surfing was different and increasingly mid-wave turns were growing in popularity. One basic reason for longer and thicker boards generally is they paddle faster. But faster waves were also becoming more popular; waves with narrower take off zones. By the early 1970s, shortboards began rise dramatically in popularity, not just as novelty but fulltime craft. So design innovation was not far behind. By the 1980s the styles have become very refined and the second large burst of surf-culture popularity in the mainstream occurred as the 3-fin, 6-foot-tall \"thruster\" shortboard began to take over. A generally narrow board with small variance in design, it almost always has three fins, a pointed nose, a squash tail, and is approximately the height of the rider. This basic style of board, with many small modifications, has been the dominant craft since the 1980s and is still the approximation of the modern professional surfboard. In 21st century professional surfing it has slowly become shorter and wider, with a more rounded nose and sometimes 4-fins (rarely 2-fins and never 1-fin), although non-professionals still regularly mix and match all those options based on personal taste.\n\n==Style versus performance==\n\n\"What is the purpose of surfing?\" has long been philosophically debated in and out of surf culture. Often the entire endeavor has been viewed in the popular media as a waste of time, or the occupation of slackers. For the most part surfing is agreed to be purely recreational, as it did not develop from, or turn into, a useful mode of daily transportation (as opposed to [[skiing]] or [[skateboarding]], which can be both). Therefore in judging and appreciating surfing there has always been varying opinions about what is necessary, stylish, extravagant, and/or functional.\n\nThe variety and size of waves varies tremendously, as does surf craft, and to some degree even the medium. Harnessing the momentum of a wave for travel is the loosest definition of surfing, so in popular culture the term is often applied to many forms of expanded \"surfing\". Particually \"surfing the web\" is a particular common example. But also characters like The Silver Surfer have taken the notion of surfing into science fiction.\n\nThere are also those who view surfing in a religious context. Certainly for the ancient Hawaiians this component was important because the ocean was viewed as a deity. Yet also in modern surfing it is common for surfing to refer to it as some form of church or mass.\n\n==Surfing's Impact on Popular Culture==\n\nComparatively small and localized surfing cultures have repeatedly generated surprisingly large influence upon popular culture, particularly in the United States of America and Australia, as well as upon the global consciousness of surfing as a form of recreation. Since the expansion of surfing in the mid-20th century, there have been numerous coastal towns that were situated near good surf breaks, whose citizens did not yet know about modern surfing, and so did not even realize it was a rare commodity.\n\nIn America and Australia the culture of surfing has influenced popular culture in periodic fads, starting with novels, movies, and the early 1960s TV show, [[Gidget]]. The attention that surfing gets in the popular culture has waxed and waned, much like other niche sports.\n\nFashions developed within surf culture have had a large worldwide impact numerous times from the 1960s to the present. A number of large clothing brands began as surfing brands, including but not limited to: OP, Stussy, Billabong, Quicksilver, Roxy, Hurley, O'neill, Ripcurl, RVCA, Vans, Volcom, Reef, and Da Kine. One of the largest influences is probably the worldwide adoption of [[boardshorts]] as swim gear for men.\n\n==Alternatives to wind-generated waves==\n\nSince their invention, surfers have sometimes used [[wave pools]] to attempt surfing, but generally the waves were too small and not well formed enough for an enjoyable experience. The 1987 movie [[North Shore (1987 film)|North Shore]] started the protagonist in an Arizona wave pool, then going on to Hawaii to try his luck. Both in and out of the movie this was considered basically a joke. But more recently, multiple attempts have been made to construct wave pools specifically designed for surfing. As of 2020 there are only few around the world open to the public, but with many more currently in development. 2018 was the first year a professional surfing contest was held at a wave pool, specifically: ''Kelly Slater's Surf Ranch''.\n\n[[Wakeboarding]] is a popular type of surfing done behind a boat's wake. There are also sometimes standing waves in rivers at high flow which can be [[River surfing|surfable]]. At certain times of year on large rivers, [[River surfing#Tidal bores|tidal bores are surfable]]. People have also surfed alongside large [[cargo ships]] as their wakes roll into shallower water, and a few people have even surfed the waves caused by calving glaciers.\nThe Wave Bristol opened in The UK as an inland artificial surf site.<ref>{{citeweb|url=https://www.thewave.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAz53vBRCpARIsAPPsz8Wmho9IiozSDyOcdz-YTIiGTQMLqpaYKiWdehYiAkBxR89gaETJxykaAiKSEALw_wcB|title=The Wave|website=www.thewave.com|accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n;General\n*Quinn, Richard. \"Region's First Surfboard Evokes a Wave of Nostalgia\" The Virginian Pilot.
