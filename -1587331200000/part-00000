It was the 24th [[January 4 Tokyo Dome Show]] and the first event on the 2015 NJPW schedule. The event featured ten professional wrestling matches and one pre-show match, six of which were for championships.\n\nIn the double main event, [[Shinsuke Nakamura]] successfully defended the [[IWGP Intercontinental Championship]] against [[Kota Ibushi]], and [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]] successfully defended the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]] against [[Kazuchika Okada]]. A Tanahashi\u2013Okada heavyweight title match had headlined [[Wrestle Kingdom 7]] two years earlier and was also the main event the following year at [[Wrestle Kingdom 10]]. Although the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship]] was successfully defended, the [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]], [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]] and [[NEVER Openweight Championship]] changed hands. The appearance of [[Pro Wrestling Noah]] wrestlers led to a storyline in which NJPW's [[Suzuki-gun]] group began wrestling at Noah events starting the week after Wrestle Kingdom 9.\n\nThe event was attended by 36,000 people. Through NJPW's partnership with [[Global Force Wrestling (2014\u20132017)|Global Force Wrestling]] (GFW), the event was broadcast with English commentary as a GFW event. It was available on PPV television in the United States and Canada, and broadcast worldwide on the Internet via [[Flipps]] and [[New Japan Pro Wrestling World]]. Critics issued positive reviews; ''[[Philly.com]]'' said it featured \"good, quality wrestling\", while ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine said it presented \"some of the most passionate and poignant performance art today\". Readers of the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'' voted Wrestle Kingdom 9 the [[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Best Major Show|Best Major Wrestling Show]] of 2015; they also named the Ibushi\u2013Nakamura match as the 2015 [[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Match of the Year|Pro Wrestling Match of the Year]].\n\n== Production ==\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ '''Other on-screen personnel'''\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Commentators\n|[[Jim Ross]] (English-language announcer)\n|-\n|[[Matt Striker]] (English-language announcer)\n|-\n|rowspan=1|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|Makoto Abe\n|-\n|rowspan=4|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Kenta Sato\n|-\n|Marty Asami\n|-\n|Red Shoes Unno\n|-\n|[[Tiger Hattori]]\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Background ===\nWrestle Kingdom has been described as \"New Japan's major annual show\" and the \"equivalent\" of [[WWE]]'s [[WrestleMania]] [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) event.<ref name=pastemag>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Garrett|title=Japanese Wrestling's Golden Age Comes to America|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/01/japanese-wrestlings-golden-age-comes-to-america.html|website=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|date=January 16, 2015|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}</ref> Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome was promoted as the \"largest wrestling show in the world outside of the United States\" and was the 24th [[January 4 Tokyo Dome Show]], although previous events were held under different names.<ref name=sportsnavi /><ref>{{cite web|title=GFW News: New Japan Pro Wrestling \"Wrestle Kingdom 9\" press conference details|url=http://www.prowrestling.net/article.php?40241|website=prowrestling.net|date=December 23, 2014|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Mike|title=1/4 This Day in History: Bret Hart returns to WWE, New Japan's Tokyo Dome tradition and more|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=82579|date=January 4, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2015|work=Pro Wrestling Insider}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jeff Jarrett at a GFW show in June 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|Global Force Wrestling owner [[Jeff Jarrett]], who participated at the event and also helped broadcast the event to the American market|alt=Jeff Jarrett, a blond-haired Caucasian man using a microphone to speak to a crowd]]\n\nOn August&nbsp;10, 2014, NJPW made two announcements.

After they battled on the top rope, Tanahashi missed a ''High Fly Flow'' but countered Okada's ''[[Kazuchika Okada#In wrestling|Rainmaker]]''. The momentum shifted to Tanahashi as he performed a [[dragon screw legwhip]] and continued attacking Okada's leg. Tanahashi later dove off the top rope and over the guard rail with a ''High Fly Flow'' [[crossbody]] to Okada on the floor outside of the ring. After Tanahashi tried another ''High Fly Flow'' crossbody back in the ring, Okada rolled through for a Tombstone piledriver, which Tanahashi countered with his own Tombstone.

He praised Jim Ross, whose \"timeless voice cut through the language barrier\" for American wrestling fans, and likened his commentary to \"reading the first English translation of [[Homer]].\" Martin commented on the ending of the show, stating that a \"broken Kazuchika Okada shambling tearfully back towards the locker room&nbsp;... made the moment feel real\" which displayed that \"Okada isn't just a great athlete but a better actor than most who step into the ring, and elevating the entire scripted, choreographed display into something beyond a sport.\" Martin wrote that New Japan had transcended [[puroresu]] and has produced \"some of the most passionate and poignant performance art today.\"<ref name=pastemag />\n\nJason Powell of ''Pro Wrestling Dot Net'' predicted that even first-time viewers of New Japan would be \"thrilled\" watching this event. Although the \"first half of the night felt rushed and had too many tag matches\", the show still held his \"interest from start to finish\" and its final three matches were \"amazing\". Powell described several matches as overtaking each other as the night's best as the event progressed: the \"very physical\" Ishii\u2013Makabe, then Naito\u2013Styles, then Ibushi\u2013Nakamura. English-language commentators Ross and Striker were endorsed as an overall positive. Lastly, Powell thought the \"pay-per-view broadcast is fantastic\", but he also said some ''Pro Wrestling Dot Net'' readers \"reported issues with the Flipps app [broadcast] feed for the show.<ref name=resultsDotNet>{{cite web|last1=Powell|first1=Jason|title=1/4 Powell's NJPW Wrestle Kingdom 9 results and review|url=http://prowrestling.net/article.php?40339|website=prowrestling.net|date=January 4, 2015|accessdate=May 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn his review, Vaughn Johnson of the [[Philadelphia Media Network]] through ''Philly.com'' wrote: \"Everything that was presented to the worldwide audience was simple and didn't require anyone to know the Japanese language. Good, quality wrestling is a universal language, and I got the message New Japan sent Sunday loud and clear.\" According to Johnson, some viewers were \"exposed to a product for the first time where the outcomes of the matches are still important, as Okada showed by openly crying after his loss to Tanahashi\" in a main event, which was \"just as much a spectacle as it was a fantastic match athletic exhibition.\" He wrote that to call the Nakamura\u2013Ibushi match \"physical would be a gross understatement&nbsp;... It was brutal to watch at times\" but \"one of the best\" he had ever seen. Johnson praised the event as \"devoid of popcorn matches and silly gimmicks that insult your intelligence\", and commentators Ross and Striker for focusing \"on the action in the ring and the significance of it instead of cracking jokes and making a million plugs.\"<ref name=philly>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Vaughn|title=New Japan Pro Wrestling's Wrestle Kingdom 9 review, observations|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/the-squared-circle/New-Japan-Pro-Wrestlings-Wrestle-Kingdom-9-review-observations.html?c=r|website=[[Philly.com]]|date=January 5, 2015|accessdate=May 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Wrestling Observer Newsletter'', although several early matches were \"rushed\", the final two were candidates for \"match of the year\".<ref name=resultsObserver /> Readers of the publication voted Wrestle Kingdom 9 the [[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Best Major Show|Best Major Wrestling Show]] of 2015; they also named the match between Ibushi and Nakamura the 2015 [[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Match of the Year|Pro Wrestling Match of the Year]], and the match between Okada and Tanahashi was voted the fourth best of 2015. Dave Meltzer gave commentary for the result in January 2016, describing Wrestle Kingdom 9 as \"the blow away show of\" 2015 and \"the peak show of the rise of New Japan Pro Wrestling from very low levels for much of the late [[2000s (decade)|00s]]\".<ref name=WONaward>{{cite magazine| last = Meltzer | first = Dave | authorlink = Dave Meltzer | date = January 25, 2016 | title = January 25, 2016 Wrestling Observer Newsletter: 2015 Observer Awards Issue | magazine = [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]] | location = [[Campbell, California]] | issn = 1083-9593 | pages=27\u201335}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:BULLET CLUB 2015.JPG|thumb|350px|[[Bullet Club]] won three championships at NJPW [[The New Beginning in Osaka (2015)|The New Beginning in Osaka]].|alt=Ten members of the Bullet Club group celebrate in a professional wrestling ring.

It was the 24th [[January 4 Tokyo Dome Show]] and the first event on the 2015 NJPW schedule. The event featured ten professional wrestling matches and one pre-show match, six of which were for championships.\n\nIn the double main event, [[Shinsuke Nakamura]] successfully defended the [[IWGP Intercontinental Championship]] against [[Kota Ibushi]], and [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]] successfully defended the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]] against [[Kazuchika Okada]]. A Tanahashi\u2013Okada heavyweight title match had headlined [[Wrestle Kingdom 7]] two years earlier and was also the main event the following year at [[Wrestle Kingdom 10]]. Although the [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship]] was successfully defended, the [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]], [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]] and [[NEVER Openweight Championship]] changed hands. The appearance of [[Pro Wrestling Noah]] wrestlers led to a storyline in which NJPW's [[Suzuki-gun]] group began wrestling at Noah events starting the week after Wrestle Kingdom 9.\n\nThe event was attended by 36,000 people. Through NJPW's partnership with [[Global Force Wrestling (2014\u20132017)|Global Force Wrestling]] (GFW), the event was broadcast with English commentary as a GFW event. It was available on PPV television in the United States and Canada, and broadcast worldwide on the Internet via [[Flipps]] and [[New Japan Pro Wrestling World]]. Critics issued positive reviews; ''[[Philly.com]]'' said it featured \"good, quality wrestling\", while ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine said it presented \"some of the most passionate and poignant performance art today\". Readers of the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'' voted Wrestle Kingdom 9 the [[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Best Major Show|Best Major Wrestling Show]] of 2015; they also named the Ibushi\u2013Nakamura match as the 2015 [[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Match of the Year|Pro Wrestling Match of the Year]].\n\n== Production ==\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ '''Other on-screen personnel'''\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Commentators\n|[[Jim Ross]] (English-language announcer)\n|-\n|[[Matt Striker]] (English-language announcer)\n|-\n|rowspan=1|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|Makoto Abe\n|-\n|rowspan=4|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Kenta Sato\n|-\n|Marty Asami\n|-\n|Red Shoes Unno\n|-\n|[[Tiger Hattori]]\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Background ===\nWrestle Kingdom has been described as \"New Japan's major annual show\" and the \"equivalent\" of [[WWE]]'s [[WrestleMania]] [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) event.<ref name=pastemag>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Garrett|title=Japanese Wrestling's Golden Age Comes to America|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/01/japanese-wrestlings-golden-age-comes-to-america.html|website=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|date=January 16, 2015|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}</ref> Wrestle Kingdom 9 in Tokyo Dome was promoted as the \"largest wrestling show in the world outside of the United States\" and was the 24th [[January 4 Tokyo Dome Show]], although previous events were held under different names.<ref name=sportsnavi /><ref>{{cite web|title=GFW News: New Japan Pro Wrestling \"Wrestle Kingdom 9\" press conference details|url=http://www.prowrestling.net/article.php?40241|website=prowrestling.net|date=December 23, 2014|accessdate=May 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Mike|title=1/4 This Day in History: Bret Hart returns to WWE, New Japan's Tokyo Dome tradition and more|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/ViewArticle.php?id=82579|date=January 4, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2015|work=Pro Wrestling Insider}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jeff Jarrett at a GFW show in June 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|Global Force Wrestling owner [[Jeff Jarrett]], who participated at the event and also helped broadcast the event to the American market|alt=Jeff Jarrett, a blond-haired Caucasian man using a microphone to speak to a crowd]]\n\nOn August&nbsp;10, 2014, NJPW made two announcements.

Ibushi also jumped on the top rope, grabbing Nakamura on the apron, and German-suplexed him back into the ring for a two count. In the finishing sequence, Ibushi got up immediately after receiving a knee from the second rope to the back of his head; both attempted the ''Boma Ye'', but Nakamura recovered first with the ''[[Powerslam#Samoan driver|Landslide]]'' and then the ''Boma Ye'' knee to retain the title at 20 minutes and 12 seconds.

The challenger controlled the early match with a [[hanging DDT]] onto the floor, a  ''Heavy Rain'' ([[Death Valley driver]]) on the entrance ramp, and the ''D.I.D.'' submission. After they battled on the top rope, Tanahashi missed a ''High Fly Flow'' but countered Okada's ''[[Kazuchika Okada#In wrestling|Rainmaker]]''. The momentum shifted to Tanahashi as he performed a [[dragon screw legwhip]] and continued attacking Okada's leg. Tanahashi later dove off the top rope and over the guard rail with a ''High Fly Flow'' [[crossbody]] to Okada on the floor outside of the ring. After Tanahashi tried another ''High Fly Flow'' crossbody back in the ring, Okada rolled through for a Tombstone piledriver, which Tanahashi countered with his own Tombstone.

Although Okada attempted the ''Rainmaker'' three more times, Tanahashi countered with a bridging [[Suplex#X-Plex|straitjacket German suplex]], a bridging dragon suplex, a series of dragon-screw legwhips, and three ''High Fly Flows''.

Although the \"first half of the night felt rushed and had too many tag matches\", the show still held his \"interest from start to finish\" and its final three matches were \"amazing\". Powell described several matches as overtaking each other as the night's best as the event progressed: the \"very physical\" Ishii\u2013Makabe, then Naito\u2013Styles, then Ibushi\u2013Nakamura. English-language commentators Ross and Striker were endorsed as an overall positive.

It was brutal to watch at times\" but \"one of the best\" he had ever seen. Johnson praised the event as \"devoid of popcorn matches and silly gimmicks that insult your intelligence\", and commentators Ross and Striker for focusing \"on the action in the ring and the significance of it instead of cracking jokes and making a million plugs.\"<ref name=philly>{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Vaughn|title=New Japan Pro Wrestling's Wrestle Kingdom 9 review, observations|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/the-squared-circle/New-Japan-Pro-Wrestlings-Wrestle-Kingdom-9-review-observations.html?c=r|website=[[Philly.com]]|date=January 5, 2015|accessdate=May 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the ''Wrestling Observer Newsletter'', although several early matches were \"rushed\", the final two were candidates for \"match of the year\".<ref name=resultsObserver /> Readers of the publication voted Wrestle Kingdom 9 the [[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Best Major Show|Best Major Wrestling Show]] of 2015; they also named the match between Ibushi and Nakamura the 2015 [[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Match of the Year|Pro Wrestling Match of the Year]], and the match between Okada and Tanahashi was voted the fourth best of 2015.

The variety is influenced by not only the altitude but also by factors such as proximity to the seacoast and the seasonal impact of the [[monsoon]]s. Southern parts are mostly hot in summers and receive rain during monsoon periods. The northern belt of [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]s also is hot in summer, but cooler in winter. The mountainous north is colder and receives snowfall at higher altitudes of Himalayan ranges.\n\nAs the [[Himalayas]] block the north-Asian bitter cold winds, the temperatures are considerably moderate in the plains down below. For the most part, the climate of the region is called the [[Monsoon]] climate, which keeps the region humid during summer and dry during winter, and favours the cultivation of [[jute]], [[tea]], [[rice]], and various vegetables in this region.\n\nSouth Asia is largely divided into four broad climate zones:<ref name=olive1>John E. Olive, ''The Encyclopedia of World Climatology'', page 115-117, Springer, 2005, {{ISBN|9781402032646}}</ref>\n* The northern Indian edge and northern Pakistani uplands have a dry subtropical [[continental climate]]\n* The far south of India and southwest Sri Lanka have an [[equatorial climate]]\n* Most of the peninsula has a tropical climate with variations:\n** Hot [[Subtropics|subtropical]] climate in northwest India\n** Cool winter hot [[tropical climate]] in Bangladesh\n** Tropical [[semi-arid climate]] in the center\n* The Himalayas have an [[Alpine climate]]\n\nMaximum relative humidity of over 80% has been recorded in [[Khasi and Jaintia Hills]] and Sri Lanka, while the area adjustment to Pakistan and western India records lower than 20%\u201330%.<ref name=olive1/> Climate of South Asia is largely characterized by [[monsoon]]s. South Asia depends critically on monsoon rainfall.<ref>Peter D. Tyson, ''Global-Regional Linkages in the Earth System'', page 83, Springer, 2002, {{ISBN|9783540424031}}</ref> Two monsoon systems exist in the region:<ref>Peter D. Tyson, ''Global-Regional Linkages in the Earth System'', page 76, Springer, 2002, {{ISBN|9783540424031}}</ref>\n* The summer monsoon: Wind blows from southwest to most of the parts of the region. It accounts for 70%\u201390% of the annual precipitation.\n* The winter monsoon: Wind blows from the northeast. Dominant in Sri Lanka and Maldives.\n\nThe warmest period of the year precedes the monsoon season (March to mid-June). In the summer, the low pressures are centered over the [[Indus-Gangetic Plain]], and high wind from the Indian Ocean blows towards the center. The monsoons are the second coldest season of the year because of high humidity and cloud covering. But, at the beginning of June, the jetstreams vanish above the [[Tibetan Plateau]], low pressure over the [[Indus Valley]] deepens, and the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) moves in. The change is violent. Moderately vigorous monsoon depressions form in the Bay of Bengal and make landfall from June to September.<ref name=olive1/>\n\n=== Land and water area ===\n{{See also|Exclusive economic zone|Indian Ocean}}\nThis list includes [[dependent territories]] within their [[List of sovereign states|sovereign states]] (including uninhabited territories), but does not include claims on [[Antarctica]].

The spoken languages of the region are largely based on geography and shared across religious boundaries, but the written script is sharply divided by religious boundaries. In particular, Muslims of South Asia, such as in Afghanistan and Pakistan, use the Arabic alphabet and Persian [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]]. Till 1952, Muslim-majority Bangladesh (then known as East Pakistan) too mandated only the Nastaliq script, but after that has adopted regional scripts and particularly Bengali, after the [[Bengali language movement|Language Movement]] for the adoption of Bengali as the official language of the then East Pakistan. Non-Muslims of South Asia, and some Muslims in India, on the other hand, use their traditional ancient heritage scripts such as those derived from [[Brahmi script]] for Indo-European languages and non-Brahmi scripts for [[Dravidian languages]] and others.<ref name=kachru122>{{cite book|author1=Braj B.

During the height of [[Cold war]], the elite political leaders of Pakistan aligned with the [[United States|US]]. At the same time, India played crucial [[India and the Non-Aligned Movement|role]] informing the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and while maintaining goodwill relations with the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]].\n\nPakistan's governance is one of the most conflicted in the region. The military rule and the unstable government in Pakistan have become a concern for the South Asian region. In [[Nepal]], the government has struggled to come in the side of democracy, and it only showed signs in the recent past, basically in the 21st century, to support the democratic system. The political situation in [[Sri Lanka]] has been dominated by an increasingly assertive [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] nationalism, and the emergence of a [[Sri Lankan Tamil people|Tamil]] separatist movement under [[LTTE]], which was suppressed in May 2009. [[Myanmar]]'s politics is dominated by a military [[Military junta|Junta]], which has sidelined the democratic forces led by [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Governance and education index rankings of South Asian countries\n! colspan=\"2\"|\n!Afghanistan|| Bangladesh|| Bhutan || India || Maldives || Nepal || Pakistan || Sri Lanka\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Inequality-adjusted HDI (2018)<ref name=\"UNDP2019\"/> (''global ranking of 150'')\n|No data|| 101 || 107 || 99 || 87 || 112 || 120 || 54\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Corruption Perception Index (2019)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/cpi2019?/news/feature/cpi-2019|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2019|last=|first=|date=|website=Transparency International|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>  (''global ranking of 168'')\n|173|| 146 || 25 || 80 || 130 || 113 || 120 || 93\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | The Worldwide Governance<br />Indicators (2015)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/#reports|title=Worldwide Governance Indicators|date=2015|website=World Bank|access-date=2017-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705084108/http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/#reports|archive-date=5 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| Government Effectiveness\n|8%|| 24% || 68% || 56% || 41% || 13% || 27% || 53%\n|-\n| Political stability and absence<br />of violence/terrorism\n|1%|| 11% || 89% || 17% || 61% || 16% || 1% || 47%\n|-\n| Rule of law\n|2%|| 27% || 70% || 56% || 35% || 27% || 24% || 60%\n|-\n| Voice and accountability\n|16%|| 31% || 46% || 61% || 30% || 33% || 27% || 36%\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[List of countries by percentage of population living in poverty|Population below poverty line]] (2011)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.NAHC?locations=CO&view=map&year_high_desc=true|title=Poverty headcount ratio at national poverty lines (% of population) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2017-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826234751/http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.NAHC?locations=CO&view=map&year_high_desc=true|archive-date=26 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|35.8%|| 31.5% || 23.7% || 21.9%|| 16% || 25.2% || 21.4% || 8.9%\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Primary School Enrollment<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR|title=School enrollment, primary (% net) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2017-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701185547/http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR|archive-date=1 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|29%||90%||85%||92%||94%||96%||73%||98%\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Secondary School Enrollment<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.SEC.ENRR/countries|title=Gross enrolment ratio, secondary, both sexes (%) \u2013 Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=3 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516152545/http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.SEC.ENRR/countries|archive-date=16 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|49%||54%||78%||68%||N/A||72%||38%||96%\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Asia}}\n<!-- {{Wikipedia-Books}} -->\n<!-- {{main|Outline of South Asia|Index of South Asia-related articles}} -->\n<!-- *[[Bibliography of South Asia]] -->\n* [[Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia]]\n* [[Indian subcontinent]]\n* [[List of tallest buildings and structures in South Asia]]\n* ''[[South Asia Disaster Report]]''\n* [[South Asian cuisine]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{citation|last1=Burnell|first1=P.

The variety is influenced by not only the altitude but also by factors such as proximity to the seacoast and the seasonal impact of the [[monsoon]]s. Southern parts are mostly hot in summers and receive rain during monsoon periods. The northern belt of [[Indo-Gangetic plain]]s also is hot in summer, but cooler in winter. The mountainous north is colder and receives snowfall at higher altitudes of Himalayan ranges.\n\nAs the [[Himalayas]] block the north-Asian bitter cold winds, the temperatures are considerably moderate in the plains down below. For the most part, the climate of the region is called the [[Monsoon]] climate, which keeps the region humid during summer and dry during winter, and favours the cultivation of [[jute]], [[tea]], [[rice]], and various vegetables in this region.\n\nSouth Asia is largely divided into four broad climate zones:<ref name=olive1>John E. Olive, ''The Encyclopedia of World Climatology'', page 115-117, Springer, 2005, {{ISBN|9781402032646}}</ref>\n* The northern Indian edge and northern Pakistani uplands have a dry subtropical [[continental climate]]\n* The far south of India and southwest Sri Lanka have an [[equatorial climate]]\n* Most of the peninsula has a tropical climate with variations:\n** Hot [[Subtropics|subtropical]] climate in northwest India\n** Cool winter hot [[tropical climate]] in Bangladesh\n** Tropical [[semi-arid climate]] in the center\n* The Himalayas have an [[Alpine climate]]\n\nMaximum relative humidity of over 80% has been recorded in [[Khasi and Jaintia Hills]] and Sri Lanka, while the area adjustment to Pakistan and western India records lower than 20%\u201330%.<ref name=olive1/> Climate of South Asia is largely characterized by [[monsoon]]s. South Asia depends critically on monsoon rainfall.<ref>Peter D. Tyson, ''Global-Regional Linkages in the Earth System'', page 83, Springer, 2002, {{ISBN|9783540424031}}</ref> Two monsoon systems exist in the region:<ref>Peter D. Tyson, ''Global-Regional Linkages in the Earth System'', page 76, Springer, 2002, {{ISBN|9783540424031}}</ref>\n* The summer monsoon: Wind blows from southwest to most of the parts of the region. It accounts for 70%\u201390% of the annual precipitation.\n* The winter monsoon: Wind blows from the northeast. Dominant in Sri Lanka and Maldives.\n\nThe warmest period of the year precedes the monsoon season (March to mid-June). In the summer, the low pressures are centered over the [[Indus-Gangetic Plain]], and high wind from the Indian Ocean blows towards the center. The monsoons are the second coldest season of the year because of high humidity and cloud covering. But, at the beginning of June, the jetstreams vanish above the [[Tibetan Plateau]], low pressure over the [[Indus Valley]] deepens, and the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) moves in. The change is violent. Moderately vigorous monsoon depressions form in the Bay of Bengal and make landfall from June to September.<ref name=olive1/>\n\n=== Land and water area ===\n{{See also|Exclusive economic zone|Indian Ocean}}\nThis list includes [[dependent territories]] within their [[List of sovereign states|sovereign states]] (including uninhabited territories), but does not include claims on [[Antarctica]].

The spoken languages of the region are largely based on geography and shared across religious boundaries, but the written script is sharply divided by religious boundaries. In particular, Muslims of South Asia, such as in Afghanistan and Pakistan, use the Arabic alphabet and Persian [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script|Nastaliq]]. Till 1952, Muslim-majority Bangladesh (then known as East Pakistan) too mandated only the Nastaliq script, but after that has adopted regional scripts and particularly Bengali, after the [[Bengali language movement|Language Movement]] for the adoption of Bengali as the official language of the then East Pakistan. Non-Muslims of South Asia, and some Muslims in India, on the other hand, use their traditional ancient heritage scripts such as those derived from [[Brahmi script]] for Indo-European languages and non-Brahmi scripts for [[Dravidian languages]] and others.<ref name=kachru122>{{cite book|author1=Braj B.

During the height of [[Cold war]], the elite political leaders of Pakistan aligned with the [[United States|US]].

The military rule and the unstable government in Pakistan have become a concern for the South Asian region. In [[Nepal]], the government has struggled to come in the side of democracy, and it only showed signs in the recent past, basically in the 21st century, to support the democratic system. The political situation in [[Sri Lanka]] has been dominated by an increasingly assertive [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] nationalism, and the emergence of a [[Sri Lankan Tamil people|Tamil]] separatist movement under [[LTTE]], which was suppressed in May 2009. [[Myanmar]]'s politics is dominated by a military [[Military junta|Junta]], which has sidelined the democratic forces led by [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Governance and education index rankings of South Asian countries\n! colspan=\"2\"|\n!Afghanistan|| Bangladesh|| Bhutan || India || Maldives || Nepal || Pakistan || Sri Lanka\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Inequality-adjusted HDI (2018)<ref name=\"UNDP2019\"/> (''global ranking of 150'')\n|No data|| 101 || 107 || 99 || 87 || 112 || 120 || 54\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | Corruption Perception Index (2019)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/cpi2019?/news/feature/cpi-2019|title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2019|last=|first=|date=|website=Transparency International|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>  (''global ranking of 168'')\n|173|| 146 || 25 || 80 || 130 || 113 || 120 || 93\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | The Worldwide Governance<br />Indicators (2015)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/#reports|title=Worldwide Governance Indicators|date=2015|website=World Bank|access-date=2017-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705084108/http://info.worldbank.org/governance/wgi/#reports|archive-date=5 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| Government Effectiveness\n|8%|| 24% || 68% || 56% || 41% || 13% || 27% || 53%\n|-\n| Political stability and absence<br />of violence/terrorism\n|1%|| 11% || 89% || 17% || 61% || 16% || 1% || 47%\n|-\n| Rule of law\n|2%|| 27% || 70% || 56% || 35% || 27% || 24% || 60%\n|-\n| Voice and accountability\n|16%|| 31% || 46% || 61% || 30% || 33% || 27% || 36%\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |[[List of countries by percentage of population living in poverty|Population below poverty line]] (2011)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.NAHC?locations=CO&view=map&year_high_desc=true|title=Poverty headcount ratio at national poverty lines (% of population) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2017-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826234751/http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.NAHC?locations=CO&view=map&year_high_desc=true|archive-date=26 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|35.8%|| 31.5% || 23.7% || 21.9%|| 16% || 25.2% || 21.4% || 8.9%\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Primary School Enrollment<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR|title=School enrollment, primary (% net) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2017-08-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701185547/http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR|archive-date=1 July 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|29%||90%||85%||92%||94%||96%||73%||98%\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" |Secondary School Enrollment<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.SEC.ENRR/countries|title=Gross enrolment ratio, secondary, both sexes (%) \u2013 Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=3 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150516152545/http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.SEC.ENRR/countries|archive-date=16 May 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|49%||54%||78%||68%||N/A||72%||38%||96%\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Asia}}\n<!-- {{Wikipedia-Books}} -->\n<!-- {{main|Outline of South Asia|Index of South Asia-related articles}} -->\n<!-- *[[Bibliography of South Asia]] -->\n* [[Genetics and archaeogenetics of South Asia]]\n* [[Indian subcontinent]]\n* [[List of tallest buildings and structures in South Asia]]\n* ''[[South Asia Disaster Report]]''\n* [[South Asian cuisine]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{citation|last1=Burnell|first1=P.

While all known fireflies glow, only some adults produce light and the location of the light organ varies among species and between sexes of the same species.

The eggs hatch three to four weeks later, and the larvae feed until the end of the summer. The larvae are commonly called glowworms (not to be confused with the distinct beetle family [[Phengodidae]] or the fly genus ''[[Arachnocampa]]''). Lampyrid larvae have simple eyes. The term glowworm is also used for both adults and larvae of species such as ''[[Lampyris noctiluca]]'', the common European glowworm, in which only the nonflying adult females glow brightly and the flying males glow only weakly and intermittently.\n[[File:FireFlies short video.webm|thumb|A video of fireflies]]\nFireflies hibernate [[insect winter ecology|over winter]] during the larval stage, some species for several years.{{Clarify|date=February 2017}} Some do this by burrowing underground, while others find places on or under the bark of trees. They emerge in the spring. After several weeks of feeding on other insects, snails, and worms, they [[pupa]]te for 1.0 to 2.5 weeks and emerge as adults. The larvae of most species are specialized [[predator]]s and feed on other larvae, terrestrial [[snail]]s, and [[slug]]s. Some are so specialized that they have grooved [[mandible (insect)|mandibles]] that deliver digestive fluids directly to their prey. Adult diet varies: some are predatory<!--carnivore?-->, while others feed on plant [[pollen]] or [[nectar]]<!--plant eating only?-->. Some, like the European glow-worm beetle, ''[[Lampyris noctiluca]]'', have no mouth.\n\nMost fireflies are distasteful to many vertebrate predators. This is due at least in part to a group of steroid pyrones known as [[lucibufagin]]s, which are similar to [[cardiotonic]] [[Bufanolide|bufadienolides]] found in some poisonous toads.<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last1 = Eisner    | first1 = Thomas\n  | last2 = Wiemer    | first2 = David\n  | last3 = Haynes    | first3 = Leroy\n  | last4 = Meinwald  | first4 = Jerrold\n  | title = Lucibufagins: Defensive steroids from the fireflies Photinus ignitus and P. marginellus (Coleoptera: Lampyridae)\n  | pmid=16592501  | year = 1978\n  | volume = 75\n  | issue = 2\n  | pages = 905\u2013908\n  | pmc = 411366\n  | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | doi=10.1073/pnas.75.2.905| bibcode = 1978PNAS...75..905E\n }}</ref>\n\n===Light and chemical production===\n[[File:Firefly composite.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Photuris]]'' firefly captured in eastern Canada \u2013 the top picture is taken with a flash, the bottom with only the self-emitted light]]\n[[File:GluehwuermchenImWald.jpg|thumb|right|Fireflies in the woods near [[Nuremberg]], Germany, exposure time 30 seconds]]\n{{further|Bioluminescence}}\n\nLight production in fireflies is due to a type of chemical reaction called [[bioluminescence]]. This process occurs in specialized light-emitting [[organ (biology)|organ]]s, usually on a firefly's lower abdomen. The enzyme [[luciferase]] acts on the [[Firefly luciferin|luciferin]], in the presence of [[magnesium]] ions, [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], and oxygen to produce light. [[Gene]] coding for these substances has been inserted into many different organisms (see [[Luciferase#Applications|Luciferase \u2013 Applications]]).

At night along river banks in the Malaysian jungles, fireflies synchronize their light emissions precisely. Current hypotheses about the causes of this behavior involve diet, social interaction, and altitude.  In the Philippines, thousands of fireflies can be seen all year-round in the town of [[Donsol]] (called ''aninipot'' or ''totonbalagon'' in [[Bikol language|Bicol]]). In the United States, one of the most famous sightings of fireflies blinking in [[unison]] occurs annually near [[Elkmont, Tennessee]], in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] during the first weeks of June.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/grsm/naturescience/fireflies.htm Synchronous Fireflies \u2013 Great Smoky Mountains National Park].

Chicago Tribune.</ref>\n\nFemale ''Photuris'' fireflies are known for mimicking the photic signaling patterns of other fireflies for the sole purpose of [[predator|predation]]; they often prey upon smaller ''Photinus'' fireflies.<ref name=\":1\" /> Target males are attracted to what appears to be a suitable mate, and are then eaten. For this reason, ''Photuris'' species are sometimes referred to as \"''[[femme fatale]]'' fireflies\".\n\nMany fireflies do not produce light. Usually these species are diurnal, or day-flying, such as those in the genus ''[[Ellychnia]]''. A few diurnal fireflies that inhabit primarily shadowy places, such as beneath tall plants or trees, are luminescent. One such genus is ''[[Lucidota]]''.\nNon-bioluminescent fireflies use pheromones to signal mates. This is supported by the fact that some basal groups do not show bioluminescence and use chemical signaling, instead. ''Phosphaenus hemipterus'' has photic organs, yet is a diurnal firefly and displays large antennae and small eyes. These traits strongly suggest pheromones are used for sexual selection, while photic organs are used for warning signals. In controlled experiments, males coming from downwind arrived at females first, indicating males travel upwind along a pheromone plume. Males were also found to be able to find females without the use of visual cues, when the sides of test [[Petri dish]]es were covered with black tape{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}. This and the facts that females do not light up at night and males are diurnal point to the conclusion that sexual communication in ''P. hemipterus'' is based entirely on pheromones.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last1 = De Cock    | first1 = R.\n  | last2 = Matthysen    | first2 = E.\n  | title = Sexual communication by pheromones in a firefly, ''Phosphaenus hemipterus'' (Coleoptera: Lampyridae)\n  | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.01.011 | year = 2005\n  | journal = Animal Behaviour\n  | volume = 70\n  | issue = 4\n  | pages = 807\u2013818 }}</ref>\n\n===Systematics===\n[[File:Cyphonocerus ruficollis 2552543412 crop.png|thumb|left|''Cyphonocerus ruficollis'', a weakly glowing member of the [[Cyphonocerinae]]]]\nFirefly [[systematics]], as with many insects, are in a constant state of flux, as new species continue to be discovered. The five [[subfamilies]] listed above are the most commonly accepted ones, though others, such as the Amydetinae and Psilocladinae, have been proposed. This was mainly done in an attempt to revise the [[Lampyrinae]], which bit by bit had become something of a \"[[wastebin taxon]]\" to hold ''[[incertae sedis]]'' species and genera of fireflies. Other changes have been proposed, such as merging the [[Ototretinae]] into the [[Luciolinae]], but the arrangement used here appears to be the most frequently seen and stable layout for the time being. Though most groups appear to be [[monophyletic]], some (e.g., the [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Photinini]]) are perhaps better divided.\n\nTwo groups of subfamilies seem to exist: one containing many [[Americas|American]] and some [[Eurasia]]n species in the Lampyrinae and Photurinae; and one, predominantly Asian, made up from the other subfamilies. While the subfamilies as understood here are, in general, [[monophyletic]], a few genera still need to be moved for the subfamilies to accurately represent the [[evolution]]ary relationships among the fireflies.\n\nThe [[Rhagophthalmidae]] are a glow-worm-like lineage of [[Elateroidea]]. They have in the recent past usually been considered a distinct family, but whether this is correct is still disputed. Indeed, they might be the only close relative of the puzzling firefly genus ''[[Pterotus]]'', which sometimes is placed in a [[monotypic]] subfamily.\n\nThe genus ''[[Phausis]]'', usually placed in the [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Photinini]] of the Lampyrinae, might represent another rather distinct lineage instead.\n\n== Conservation ==\nFirefly populations are declining worldwide, for a variety of reasons.<ref>[https://www.firefly.org/ Firefly.org]</ref> Fireflies, like many other organisms, are directly affected by land-use change (e.g. loss of habitat area and connectivity), which is identified as the main driver of biodiversity changes in terrestrial ecosystems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sala|first=Osvaldo E.|last2=Chapin|first2=F.

Many are found in [[marsh]]es or in wet, wooded areas where their [[larva]]e have abundant sources of food. Some species are called \"[[glowworm]]s\" in Eurasia and elsewhere. While all known fireflies glow, only some adults produce light and the location of the light organ varies among species and between sexes of the same species. The form of the insect which emits light varies from species to species (for example, in the glow worm found in the UK, ''Lampyris noctiluca'', it is the female that is most easily noticed.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.glowworms.org.uk | title=UK Glow worm survey home page}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brc.ac.uk/irecord/glow-worm|accessdate=19 July 2018|title=Enter a glow-worm record|date=11 June 2015}}</ref>).

Adults can differ drastically in size depending on the species, with the largest being up to an inch long. Although the females of some species are similar in appearance to males, [[larviform female]]s are found in many firefly species. These females can often be distinguished from the larvae only because the adults have [[arthropod eye|compound eye]]s, although the latter are much smaller than those of their males and often highly regressed.<ref name= \"Lau & Meyer-Rochow 2006\">{{cite journal|last=Lau|first=T.F.|last2=Meyer-Rochow|first2=V.B.|title=Sexual dimorphism in the compound eye of Rhagophthalmus ohbai (Coleoptera: Rhagophthalmidae): Morphology and ultrastructure| journal=Journal of Asia-Pacific Entomology|date=2006|volume=9|pages=19\u201330|doi=10.1016/S1226-8615(08)60271-X}}</ref>  The most commonly known fireflies are [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/firefly|title=Firefly|publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref> although numerous species are [[diurnality|diurnal]]. Most diurnal species are not luminescent; however, some species that remain in shadowy areas may produce light.\n\nA few days after mating, a female lays her fertilized eggs on or just below the surface of the ground. The eggs hatch three to four weeks later, and the larvae feed until the end of the summer. The larvae are commonly called glowworms (not to be confused with the distinct beetle family [[Phengodidae]] or the fly genus ''[[Arachnocampa]]''). Lampyrid larvae have simple eyes. The term glowworm is also used for both adults and larvae of species such as ''[[Lampyris noctiluca]]'', the common European glowworm, in which only the nonflying adult females glow brightly and the flying males glow only weakly and intermittently.\n[[File:FireFlies short video.webm|thumb|A video of fireflies]]\nFireflies hibernate [[insect winter ecology|over winter]] during the larval stage, some species for several years.{{Clarify|date=February 2017}} Some do this by burrowing underground, while others find places on or under the bark of trees. They emerge in the spring. After several weeks of feeding on other insects, snails, and worms, they [[pupa]]te for 1.0 to 2.5 weeks and emerge as adults. The larvae of most species are specialized [[predator]]s and feed on other larvae, terrestrial [[snail]]s, and [[slug]]s. Some are so specialized that they have grooved [[mandible (insect)|mandibles]] that deliver digestive fluids directly to their prey. Adult diet varies: some are predatory<!--carnivore?-->, while others feed on plant [[pollen]] or [[nectar]]<!--plant eating only?-->. Some, like the European glow-worm beetle, ''[[Lampyris noctiluca]]'', have no mouth.\n\nMost fireflies are distasteful to many vertebrate predators. This is due at least in part to a group of steroid pyrones known as [[lucibufagin]]s, which are similar to [[cardiotonic]] [[Bufanolide|bufadienolides]] found in some poisonous toads.<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last1 = Eisner    | first1 = Thomas\n  | last2 = Wiemer    | first2 = David\n  | last3 = Haynes    | first3 = Leroy\n  | last4 = Meinwald  | first4 = Jerrold\n  | title = Lucibufagins: Defensive steroids from the fireflies Photinus ignitus and P. marginellus (Coleoptera: Lampyridae)\n  | pmid=16592501  | year = 1978\n  | volume = 75\n  | issue = 2\n  | pages = 905\u2013908\n  | pmc = 411366\n  | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | doi=10.1073/pnas.75.2.905| bibcode = 1978PNAS...75..905E\n }}</ref>\n\n===Light and chemical production===\n[[File:Firefly composite.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Photuris]]'' firefly captured in eastern Canada \u2013 the top picture is taken with a flash, the bottom with only the self-emitted light]]\n[[File:GluehwuermchenImWald.jpg|thumb|right|Fireflies in the woods near [[Nuremberg]], Germany, exposure time 30 seconds]]\n{{further|Bioluminescence}}\n\nLight production in fireflies is due to a type of chemical reaction called [[bioluminescence]]. This process occurs in specialized light-emitting [[organ (biology)|organ]]s, usually on a firefly's lower abdomen. The enzyme [[luciferase]] acts on the [[Firefly luciferin|luciferin]], in the presence of [[magnesium]] ions, [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], and oxygen to produce light. [[Gene]] coding for these substances has been inserted into many different organisms (see [[Luciferase#Applications|Luciferase \u2013 Applications]]). The genetics of firefly bioluminescence, focusing on [[luciferase]], has been reviewed by John Day.<ref name=\"Day 2009\">{{cite book |last1=Day| first1=John|chapter=Beetle bioluminescence: a genetic and enzymatic research review |year=2009 |publisher=Research Signpost: Kerala | editor=Meyer-Rochow, V.B. |title=Bioluminescence in Focus |pages=325\u2013355 }}</ref> Firefly luciferase is used in [[forensics]], and the enzyme has medical uses \u2013 in particular, for detecting the presence of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] or magnesium.\nAll fireflies glow as larvae.

At night along river banks in the Malaysian jungles, fireflies synchronize their light emissions precisely. Current hypotheses about the causes of this behavior involve diet, social interaction, and altitude.  In the Philippines, thousands of fireflies can be seen all year-round in the town of [[Donsol]] (called ''aninipot'' or ''totonbalagon'' in [[Bikol language|Bicol]]).

Chicago Tribune.</ref>\n\nFemale ''Photuris'' fireflies are known for mimicking the photic signaling patterns of other fireflies for the sole purpose of [[predator|predation]]; they often prey upon smaller ''Photinus'' fireflies.<ref name=\":1\" /> Target males are attracted to what appears to be a suitable mate, and are then eaten. For this reason, ''Photuris'' species are sometimes referred to as \"''[[femme fatale]]'' fireflies\".\n\nMany fireflies do not produce light. Usually these species are diurnal, or day-flying, such as those in the genus ''[[Ellychnia]]''. A few diurnal fireflies that inhabit primarily shadowy places, such as beneath tall plants or trees, are luminescent. One such genus is ''[[Lucidota]]''.\nNon-bioluminescent fireflies use pheromones to signal mates. This is supported by the fact that some basal groups do not show bioluminescence and use chemical signaling, instead. ''Phosphaenus hemipterus'' has photic organs, yet is a diurnal firefly and displays large antennae and small eyes. These traits strongly suggest pheromones are used for sexual selection, while photic organs are used for warning signals. In controlled experiments, males coming from downwind arrived at females first, indicating males travel upwind along a pheromone plume. Males were also found to be able to find females without the use of visual cues, when the sides of test [[Petri dish]]es were covered with black tape{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}. This and the facts that females do not light up at night and males are diurnal point to the conclusion that sexual communication in ''P. hemipterus'' is based entirely on pheromones.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last1 = De Cock    | first1 = R.\n  | last2 = Matthysen    | first2 = E.\n  | title = Sexual communication by pheromones in a firefly, ''Phosphaenus hemipterus'' (Coleoptera: Lampyridae)\n  | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.01.011 | year = 2005\n  | journal = Animal Behaviour\n  | volume = 70\n  | issue = 4\n  | pages = 807\u2013818 }}</ref>\n\n===Systematics===\n[[File:Cyphonocerus ruficollis 2552543412 crop.png|thumb|left|''Cyphonocerus ruficollis'', a weakly glowing member of the [[Cyphonocerinae]]]]\nFirefly [[systematics]], as with many insects, are in a constant state of flux, as new species continue to be discovered. The five [[subfamilies]] listed above are the most commonly accepted ones, though others, such as the Amydetinae and Psilocladinae, have been proposed. This was mainly done in an attempt to revise the [[Lampyrinae]], which bit by bit had become something of a \"[[wastebin taxon]]\" to hold ''[[incertae sedis]]'' species and genera of fireflies. Other changes have been proposed, such as merging the [[Ototretinae]] into the [[Luciolinae]], but the arrangement used here appears to be the most frequently seen and stable layout for the time being. Though most groups appear to be [[monophyletic]], some (e.g., the [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Photinini]]) are perhaps better divided.\n\nTwo groups of subfamilies seem to exist: one containing many [[Americas|American]] and some [[Eurasia]]n species in the Lampyrinae and Photurinae; and one, predominantly Asian, made up from the other subfamilies. While the subfamilies as understood here are, in general, [[monophyletic]], a few genera still need to be moved for the subfamilies to accurately represent the [[evolution]]ary relationships among the fireflies.\n\nThe [[Rhagophthalmidae]] are a glow-worm-like lineage of [[Elateroidea]]. They have in the recent past usually been considered a distinct family, but whether this is correct is still disputed. Indeed, they might be the only close relative of the puzzling firefly genus ''[[Pterotus]]'', which sometimes is placed in a [[monotypic]] subfamily.\n\nThe genus ''[[Phausis]]'', usually placed in the [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] [[Photinini]] of the Lampyrinae, might represent another rather distinct lineage instead.\n\n== Conservation ==\nFirefly populations are declining worldwide, for a variety of reasons.<ref>[https://www.firefly.org/ Firefly.org]</ref> Fireflies, like many other organisms, are directly affected by land-use change (e.g. loss of habitat area and connectivity), which is identified as the main driver of biodiversity changes in terrestrial ecosystems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sala|first=Osvaldo E.|last2=Chapin|first2=F.

As such, until the late 1990s, Legion Field hosted most of Alabama's important home games. The most notable of these games was the [[Iron Bowl]] with rival [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]]. Legion Field was considered a neutral site from 1948 through 1987. When the Iron Bowl became a home-and-home series in 1988, Alabama continued to host its home games in the series at Legion Field in even-numbered years through 1998. The Crimson Tide hosted Tennessee in odd-numbered years in Birmingham until 1999, and LSU in even-numbered years from 1964 through 1986, except for 1980. Usually, Bryant\u2013Denny hosted three or four games per season, mostly non-conference games, although the Tide always played Mississippi State in Tuscaloosa, save for 1987, due to the close distance between Tuscaloosa and [[Starkville, Mississippi|Starkville]]. However, in 1998, when Bryant\u2013Denny was expanded to a capacity exceeding Legion Field, the more important home games started to move to Bryant\u2013Denny, culminating with the move of the Tennessee series to Tuscaloosa in 1999 and the Iron Bowl a year later.<ref name=\"March 6, 1999\">{{cite news |title=Vols Due in Fall, AU in 2000|first=Cecil|last=Hurt|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6ckdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VqYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6026%2C631746|newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|date=March 6, 1999|accessdate=February 3, 2011|page=1}}</ref> From 1998 to 2003, Alabama continued to play two or three minor games in Birmingham.

[[NCAA Football 11]] ranked Alabama's Bryant\u2013Denny as the fourth toughest place to play in the nation and third in the SEC behind [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium|Florida]] and [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|LSU]].

As more and more stadiums began to add other designs to the field, such as logos, Alabama chose to remain traditional with the field design. In fact, even into the 2002 season, Bryant\u2013Denny still had no logo at midfield and no logos at the 25-yard lines, which are now commonplace in many stadiums. The end zone design simply consisted of \"ALABAMA\" in a white, block-style font. During the 1992 season, however, a special logo was used at midfield to commemorate the centennial season of Alabama football.\n\nDuring the 2002 season, however, a large white script \u201cA\u201d was added to midfield. The field design underwent full-scale changes beginning with the 2004 season. At midfield, the large white script \u201cA\u201d was replaced with the crimson script \u201cA\u201d logo, encircled by a crimson ring which has \"Alabama Crimson Tide\" written around it. In addition, the end zone designs were changed to a crimson block-style font outlined in white.\n\nFor the 2006 season, two identical logos commemorating the 175th anniversary of the university were also added to the field on the 25-yard lines. One was added on the south end of the stadium, on the west side of the playing field, while the other was on the north end of the stadium, on the east side of the playing field.\n\n[[File:2011 houndstooth ribbon on the field at Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium.jpg|thumb|right|alt=American football field with a houndstooth awareness ribbon painted on it.|left|Detail of the [[houndstooth]] [[awareness ribbon]] painted on-field in remembrance of the victims and damage of the April 2011 tornado.]]\nFor the 2007 season, two identical logos commemorating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) were added to home field of every SEC team.

Legion Field was considered a neutral site from 1948 through 1987. When the Iron Bowl became a home-and-home series in 1988, Alabama continued to host its home games in the series at Legion Field in even-numbered years through 1998. The Crimson Tide hosted Tennessee in odd-numbered years in Birmingham until 1999, and LSU in even-numbered years from 1964 through 1986, except for 1980. Usually, Bryant\u2013Denny hosted three or four games per season, mostly non-conference games, although the Tide always played Mississippi State in Tuscaloosa, save for 1987, due to the close distance between Tuscaloosa and [[Starkville, Mississippi|Starkville]]. However, in 1998, when Bryant\u2013Denny was expanded to a capacity exceeding Legion Field, the more important home games started to move to Bryant\u2013Denny, culminating with the move of the Tennessee series to Tuscaloosa in 1999 and the Iron Bowl a year later.<ref name=\"March 6, 1999\">{{cite news |title=Vols Due in Fall, AU in 2000|first=Cecil|last=Hurt|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6ckdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VqYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6026%2C631746|newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]]|date=March 6, 1999|accessdate=February 3, 2011|page=1}}</ref> From 1998 to 2003, Alabama continued to play two or three minor games in Birmingham.

As more and more stadiums began to add other designs to the field, such as logos, Alabama chose to remain traditional with the field design. In fact, even into the 2002 season, Bryant\u2013Denny still had no logo at midfield and no logos at the 25-yard lines, which are now commonplace in many stadiums. The end zone design simply consisted of \"ALABAMA\" in a white, block-style font. During the 1992 season, however, a special logo was used at midfield to commemorate the centennial season of Alabama football.\n\nDuring the 2002 season, however, a large white script \u201cA\u201d was added to midfield. The field design underwent full-scale changes beginning with the 2004 season. At midfield, the large white script \u201cA\u201d was replaced with the crimson script \u201cA\u201d logo, encircled by a crimson ring which has \"Alabama Crimson Tide\" written around it. In addition, the end zone designs were changed to a crimson block-style font outlined in white.\n\nFor the 2006 season, two identical logos commemorating the 175th anniversary of the university were also added to the field on the 25-yard lines. One was added on the south end of the stadium, on the west side of the playing field, while the other was on the north end of the stadium, on the east side of the playing field.\n\n[[File:2011 houndstooth ribbon on the field at Bryant\u2013Denny Stadium.jpg|thumb|right|alt=American football field with a houndstooth awareness ribbon painted on it.|left|Detail of the [[houndstooth]] [[awareness ribbon]] painted on-field in remembrance of the victims and damage of the April 2011 tornado.]]\nFor the 2007 season, two identical logos commemorating the 75th anniversary of the founding of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) were added to home field of every SEC team. These were in the same places as the 175th logos were during the 2006 season.\n\nFor the 2008 season, two identical SEC logos were added to the home field of every SEC team. Alabama\u2019s crimson was used as the primary color for the logos at Bryant\u2013Denny.

Because green contributes the largest share of luminance, followed by red, then blue, this sequence of bars thus appears on a [[waveform monitor]] in luminance mode as a downward staircase from left to right. The [[Oscilloscope#Graticule|graticule]] of a [[vectorscope]] is etched with boxes showing the permissible regions where the traces from these seven bars are supposed to fall if the signal is properly adjusted. \n\nBelow the main set of seven bars is a strip of [[blue]], [[magenta]], [[cyan]], and [[white]] castellations. When a television receiver is set to filter out all colors except for blue, these castellations, combined with the main set of color bars, are used to properly adjust the color controls; they appear as four solid blue bars, with no visible distinction between the bars and the castellations, if the color controls are properly adjusted.\n\nThe bottom section contains a square of 100% intensity white and a rectangle of 7.5% intensity black, for use in setting the luminance range. More modern versions of the pattern feature a \"[[pluge]] pulse.\" The white square lines up so that it is below the yellow and cyan bars, on a waveform monitor this will show up with the white bar overlapping the peak of the yellow and cyan chroma at 100 IRE units. The pluge (short for \"Picture Line-Up Generation Equipment\") pulse is positioned within the black rectangle, below the red bar (it is present in the illustration but may be hard to see). It comprises three small vertical bars, a rightmost one with intensity 4% above black level (11.5 IRE), a middle one with intensity exactly equal to black (7.5 IRE), and a leftmost one with intensity 4% below black (super-black or \"blacker than black\", 3.5 IRE). The pluge pulse aids in adjusting the bottom of the luminance range to avoid either washing out the black tones into grays or collapsing picture information into the signal clipping that occurs a small distance below the black level (known as \"crushing the blacks\"). When a monitor is properly adjusted, the rightmost pluge bar should be just barely visible, while the left two should appear indistinguishable from each other and completely black. Also in the bottom section are two sections that contain -In-phase and +Quadrature signals (see [[YIQ]]), centered on black level and having the same gain as the color burst signal; these show up on the pattern as a square of very dark blue, and a square of very dark purple. On a vectorscope, they appear as two short lines ninety degrees apart. These are used to ensure that the television receiver is properly demodulating the 3.58 [[Megahertz|MHz]] [[NTSC#Chrominance subcarrier|color subcarrier]] portion of the signal. The vectors for the -I and +Q blocks should fall exactly on the I and Q axes on the vectorscope if the chrominance signal is demodulated properly.\n\n[[File:SMPTE bars and tone.ogv|thumb|250px|right|SMPTE color bars with 1kHz [[sine wave]] tone.]]\nThese bars give rise to the former portion of the casual term, \"bars and tone\". Typically, a [[television network]], [[TV station]], or other originator of video programming transmits SMPTE color bars together with a continuous 1000 [[Hertz|Hz]] [[Audio frequency|audio]] [[Pitch (music)|tone]] before sending program material, in order to assert ownership of the transmission line or medium, and so that receiving stations and intermediary telecommunications providers may adjust their equipment. Likewise, producers of television programs typically record \"bars and tone\" at the beginning of a videotape or other recording medium so that the playback equipment can be [[calibration|calibrated]]. Often, the name or [[callsign]] of the TV station, other information such as a real-time clock, or another signal source is graphically superimposed over the bars. \n\nAn alternate form of color bars is the 100% Color Bars pattern, or RGB pattern (sometimes called full field bars), which consists of eight vertical bars of 100% intensity, and does not include the castellation or luminance patterns. Like the SMPTE standard (\"75%\") pattern, the color order is white, yellow, cyan, green, magenta, red, and blue, but with an additional column of saturated black. This pattern is used to check peak color levels and color saturation as well as color alignment. The 100% pattern is not as common or as useful as the SMPTE standard 75% pattern, but many pieces of test equipment generate both patterns, and can be selected to generate either one. Many professional cameras can be set to generate a 100% pattern for calibration to broadcast or recording equipment, especially in a multi-camera installation where all camera signals must match. There is another 75% pattern that consists of the same eight columns as the 100% pattern, but at 75% intensity. This pattern is very seldom used.\n\nAlthough color bars were originally designed to calibrate analog NTSC equipment, they remain widely used within modern digital television facilities. Color bars are used to maintain accurate chroma and luminance levels in CRT, LCD, plasma, and other video displays, as well as duplication, television and webcast equ\u0131pment.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
