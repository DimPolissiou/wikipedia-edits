This strategy was used by various civilizations, such as the Romans and the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. While not as common as in previous centuries, modern militaries continue to employ dogs in an attack role. SOCOM forces of the US military still use dogs in raids for apprehending fleeing enemies or prisoners, or for searching areas too difficult or dangerous for human soldiers (such as crawl spaces).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/Training-for-US-SOCOMs-Best-Friends-06923/ |title=Training for US SOCOM\u2019s Best Friends |publisher=Defenseindustrydaily.com |date=2011-06-13 |accessdate=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\nAnother program attempted during World War II was suggested by a Swiss citizen living in Santa Fe, New Mexico. William A. Prestre proposed using large dogs to kill Japanese soldiers. He convinced the military to lease an entire island in the Mississippi to house the training facilities. There the army hoped to train as many as two million dogs. The idea was to begin island invasions with landing craft releasing thousands of dogs against the Japanese defenders, then followed up by troops as the Japanese defenders scattered in confusion. One of the biggest problems encountered was getting Japanese soldiers to train the dogs with, because few Japanese soldiers were being captured. Eventually, Japanese-American soldiers volunteered for the training. Another large problem was with the dogs; either they were too docile, did not properly respond to their beach crossing training, or were terrified by shellfire. After millions of dollars were spent with inconclusive results, the program was abandoned.<ref>{{cite book|pages=[https://archive.org/details/1942yearthattrie00groo_0/page/166 166\u2013168]|title=1942: The Year that Tried Men's Souls|author=Winston Groom|publisher=Atlanta Monthly Press|year=2005|isbn=0-87113-889-1|url=https://archive.org/details/1942yearthattrie00groo_0/page/166}}</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union used dogs for [[Anti-tank dog|anti-tank]] purposes beginning in the 1930s. Earlier anti-tank dogs were fitted with tilt-rod mines and trained to run beneath enemy tanks, which would detonate the mines automatically. However, the dogs were trained with stationary Russian tanks and very seldom ran under the moving tanks, instead they were shot as they ran beside the moving tanks.

The presence of a mascot was designed to uplift [[morale]], and many were used to this effect in the trenches of World War I. An example of this would be Sgt. Stubby for the US Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://3milliondogs.com/blog-assets-two/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2016-01-22-at-11.03.22-AM.png|title=Sgt.

The United States' government responded by proclaiming these dogs as heroes.\n\nThe [[Cold War]] sparked a heated debate over the ethics of animal experimentation in the U.S., particularly aimed at how canines were treated in World War II.<ref name=NLM_20061024/> In 1966, major reforms came to this field with the adoption of the [[Laboratory Animal Welfare Act]].<ref>{{cite journal |accessdate=2008-07-08\n|last=Buettinger |first=Craig\n|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-13506650.html\n|title=Antivivisection and the charge of zoophil-psychosis in the early twentieth century\n|journal=The Historian|date=January 1, 1993}}</ref>\n\n===Detection and tracking===\n\n{{Main|Detection dog}}\nMany dogs were used to locate [[Land mine|mine]]s. They did not prove to be very effective under combat conditions. Marine mine detecting dogs were trained using bare electric wires beneath the ground surface.<ref>Putney, William. (2001) ''Always Faithful: A Memoir of the Marine Dogs of World War II'', New York: Simon & Schuster Inc. {{ISBN|0-7432-0198-1}}</ref> The wires shocked the dogs, teaching them that danger lurked under the dirt. Once the dog's focus was properly directed, dummy mines were planted and the dogs were trained to signal their presence. While the dogs effectively found the mines, the task proved so stressful for the dogs they were only able to work between 20 and 30 minutes at a time. The mine detecting war dogs anticipated random shocks from the heretofore friendly earth, making them extremely nervous.{{Clarify|date=December 2010}} The useful service life of the dogs was not long. Experiments with lab rats show that this trend can be very extreme, in some tests rats even huddled in the corner to the point of starvation to avoid electric shock.\n\nDogs have historically also been used in many cases to track fugitives and enemy troops, overlapping partly into the duties of a scout dog, but use their olfactory skill in tracking a scent, rather than warning a handler at the initial presentation of a scent.\n\n===Scouts===\n[[File:Marine-war-dogs.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marine Raiders]] take scouting and messenger dogs to the frontlines on [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], late 1943]]\n\nSome dogs are trained to silently locate [[booby trap]]s and concealed enemies such as snipers. The dog's keen senses of smell and hearing would make them far more effective at detecting these dangers than humans. The best scout dogs are described as having a disposition intermediate to docile tracking dogs and aggressive attack dogs.<ref name=\"SCOUT\"/>\nScouting dogs are able to identify the opposing threat within 1,000 yards of area. This method of scouting is more efficient compared to human senses.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uswardogs.org/war-dog-history/types-war-dogs/|title=Types of War Dogs - US War Dog Association - National Headquarters|website=www.uswardogs.org|accessdate=16 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nScout dogs were used in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam by the United States to detect ambushes, weapon caches, or enemy fighters hiding underwater, with only reed breathing straws showing above the waterline. The US operated a number of scout dog platoons (assigned on a handler-and-dog team basis to individual patrols) and had a dedicated dog training school in [[Fort Benning]], Georgia.<ref name=\"SCOUT\">{{cite journal\n |url         = http://www.qmfound.com/scout_dogs.htm\n |title       = Scout Dogs - Enemy's Worst Enemy... \n |last        = Rubenstein\n |first       = SP4 Wain\n |journal     = Danger Forward\n |volume      = 3\n |issue       = 2\n |date        = June 1969\n |publisher   = U.S/ Army Quartermaster Museum\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090803142226/http://www.qmfound.com/scout_dogs.htm\n |archivedate = 2009-08-03\n}}</ref>\n\n===Sentries===\n\n{{main|Guard dog}}\nOne of the earliest military-related uses, sentry dogs were used to defend camps or other priority areas at night and sometimes during the day. They would bark or growl to alert guards of a stranger's presence. During the [[Cold War]], the American military used sentry dog teams outside of nuclear weapons storage areas. A test program was conducted in Vietnam to test sentry dogs, launched two days after a successful [[Vietcong]] attack on [[Da Nang Air Base]] (July 1, 1965). Forty dog teams were deployed to Vietnam for a four-month test period, with teams placed on the perimeter in front of machine gun towers/bunkers. The detection of intruders resulted in a rapid deployment of reinforcements. The test was successful, so the handlers returned to the US while the dogs were reassigned to new handlers. The Air Force immediately started to ship dog teams to all the bases in Vietnam and Thailand.\n\nThe buildup of American forces in Vietnam created large dog sections at USAF Southeast Asia (SEA) bases. 467 dogs were eventually assigned to [[Bien Hoa Air Base|Bien Hoa]], [[Binh Thuy Air Base|Binh Thuy]], [[Cam Ranh Air Base|Cam Ranh Bay]], [[Da Nang Air Base|Da Nang]], [[Nha Trang Air Base|Nha Trang]], [[Tuy Hoa Air Base|Tuy Hoa]], [[Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t Air Base|Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t]], [[Phan Rang Air Base|Phan Rang]], [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base|Tan Son Nhut]], and [[Pleiku Air Base]]s. Within a year of deployment, attacks on several bases had been stopped when the enemy forces were detected by dog teams. Captured Vietcong told of the fear and respect that they had for the dogs. The Vietcong even placed a bounty on lives of handlers and dogs. The success of sentry dogs was determined by the lack of successful penetrations of bases in Vietnam and Thailand. It is estimated by the United States War Dogs Association that war dogs saved over 10,000 U.S. lives in Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web\n |accessdate  = 2008-07-08\n |url         = http://www.qmfound.com/War_Dogs.htm\n |title       = War Dogs\n |date        = January 9, 2007\n |publisher   = [[U.S. Army Quartermaster Museum]]\n |location    = Fort Lee, Virginia\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080523110604/http://www.qmfound.com/War_Dogs.htm\n |archivedate = May 23, 2008\n}}</ref> Sentry Dogs were also used by the Army, Navy, and Marines to protect the perimeter of a large bases\n\n===Modern uses===\n[[File:K-9 Andy.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. Army military working dog searches among rubble and trash outside a target building in [[Al-Rusafa, Iraq|Rusafa]], eastern Baghdad, Iraq.]]\nContemporary dogs in military roles are also often referred to as [[police dogs]], or in the United States and United Kingdom as a Military Working Dog (MWD), or K-9. Their roles are nearly as varied as those of their ancient cousins, though they tend to be more rarely used in front-line formations. As of 2011, 600 U.S. Military dogs were actively participating in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.<ref name=\"six hundred\">{{cite news|title=A Bin Laden Hunter on Four Legs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/science/05dog.html?_r=1|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=5 May 2011|author=Gardiner Harris|date=4 May 2011|quote=There are 600 dogs serving in Afghanistan and Iraq, and that number is expected to grow substantially over the next year.}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the most common breed for these police-type operations has been the [[German Shepherd]]; in recent years there has been a shift to smaller dogs with keener senses of smell for detection work, and more resilient breeds such as the [[Belgian Malinois]] and [[Dutch Shepherd]] for patrolling and law enforcement. All MWDs in use today are paired with a single individual after their training. This person is called a handler. While a handler usually won't stay with one dog for the length of either's career, usually a handler will stay partnered with a dog for at least a year, and sometimes much longer.\n\nThe latest canine tactical vests are outfitted with cameras and durable microphones that allow dogs to relay audio and visual information to their handlers.\n\nIn the 1970s the [[US Air Force]] used over 1,600 dogs worldwide. Today, personnel cutbacks have reduced USAF dog teams to approximately 530, stationed throughout the world. Many dogs that operate in these roles are trained at [[Lackland Air Force Base]], the only United States facility that currently trains dogs for military use.<ref name=NationalGeographic_Mott_20030409>{{cite news|accessdate=2008-07-08\n|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/04/0409_030409_militarydogs.html\n|title=Dogs of War: Inside the U.S. Military's Canine Corps\n|first=Maryann |last=Mott |date=April 9, 2003\n|work=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic News]]}}</ref>\n[[File:Aviators performs medevac training, military working dogs climb to new heights 150724-A-AB123-004.jpg|thumb|right|Military working dog with goggles for eye protection]]\nChange has also come in legislation for the benefit of the canines.

Police dogs can chase suspects, track them if they are hidden, and guard them when they are caught. They are trained to respond viciously if their handler is attacked, and otherwise not to react at all unless they are commanded to do so by their handler. Many police dogs are also trained in detection as well.\n\n====Drug and explosives detection====\n{{main|Detection dog}}\nBoth MWDs and their civilian counterparts provide service in drug detection, sniffing out a broad range of [[psychoactive substances]] despite efforts at concealment. Provided they have been trained to detect it, MWDs can smell small traces of nearly any substance, even if it is in a sealed container. [[Detection dog|Dogs trained in drug detection]] are normally used at ports of embarkation such as [[airports]], checkpoints, and other places where there is high security and a need for anti-[[contraband]] measures.\n\nMWDs can also be trained to detect [[explosives]]. As with narcotics, trained MWDs can detect minuscule amounts of a wide range of explosives, making them useful for searching entry points, patrolling within secure installations, and at checkpoints. These dogs are capable of achieving over a 98% success rate in bomb detection.<ref name=QMFound>{{cite web\n |accessdate  = 2008-07-08\n |url         = http://www.qmfound.com/War_Dogs.htm\n |title       = War Dogs\n |publisher   = U.S. Army Quartermaster Museum\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080523110604/http://www.qmfound.com/War_Dogs.htm\n |archivedate = 2008-05-23\n}}</ref>\n\n====Intimidation====\n[[File:Abu Ghraib 56.jpg|thumb|right|A bound prisoner in an orange [[jumpsuit]] is intimidated with a dog by a U.S. soldier, at [[Abu Ghraib prison]] ]]\n\nThe use of Military Working Dogs on prisoners by the United States during recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq has been controversial.\n\n[[Iraq War]]: The United States has used dogs to intimidate prisoners in Iraqi prisons.<ref name=SeattlePI_Goodman_20070829>{{cite news\n|accessdate= |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/opinion/329528_amy30.html\n|title=Gonzales' tortured legacy lingers |first=Amy |last=Goodman\n|date=August 29, 2007|work=[[Seattle Post Intelligencer]]}}</ref>\nIn court testimony following the revelations of [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse]], it was stated that Col.

Many roles for dogs in war are obsolete and no longer practiced, but the concept of the war dog still remains alive and well in modern warfare.\n\n===Fighting===\n\n[[File:Working dog in Afghanistan, wearing a bulletproof vest, being trained-hires.jpg|thumb|Military working dog wearing [[Ballistic vest|body armor]], undergoing escalation of force training in [[Afghanistan]].]]\n{{main|Attack dog}}\nIn ancient times, dogs, often large mastiff- or molosser-type breeds, would be strapped with armor or spiked collars and sent into battle to attack the enemy. This strategy was used by various civilizations, such as the Romans and the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. While not as common as in previous centuries, modern militaries continue to employ dogs in an attack role. SOCOM forces of the US military still use dogs in raids for apprehending fleeing enemies or prisoners, or for searching areas too difficult or dangerous for human soldiers (such as crawl spaces).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/Training-for-US-SOCOMs-Best-Friends-06923/ |title=Training for US SOCOM\u2019s Best Friends |publisher=Defenseindustrydaily.com |date=2011-06-13 |accessdate=2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\nAnother program attempted during World War II was suggested by a Swiss citizen living in Santa Fe, New Mexico. William A. Prestre proposed using large dogs to kill Japanese soldiers. He convinced the military to lease an entire island in the Mississippi to house the training facilities. There the army hoped to train as many as two million dogs. The idea was to begin island invasions with landing craft releasing thousands of dogs against the Japanese defenders, then followed up by troops as the Japanese defenders scattered in confusion. One of the biggest problems encountered was getting Japanese soldiers to train the dogs with, because few Japanese soldiers were being captured. Eventually, Japanese-American soldiers volunteered for the training. Another large problem was with the dogs; either they were too docile, did not properly respond to their beach crossing training, or were terrified by shellfire. After millions of dollars were spent with inconclusive results, the program was abandoned.<ref>{{cite book|pages=[https://archive.org/details/1942yearthattrie00groo_0/page/166 166\u2013168]|title=1942: The Year that Tried Men's Souls|author=Winston Groom|publisher=Atlanta Monthly Press|year=2005|isbn=0-87113-889-1|url=https://archive.org/details/1942yearthattrie00groo_0/page/166}}</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union used dogs for [[Anti-tank dog|anti-tank]] purposes beginning in the 1930s. Earlier anti-tank dogs were fitted with tilt-rod mines and trained to run beneath enemy tanks, which would detonate the mines automatically. However, the dogs were trained with stationary Russian tanks and very seldom ran under the moving tanks, instead they were shot as they ran beside the moving tanks. When both Russian and German tanks were present, the dogs would preferentially run towards the familiar Russian tanks.\n\n===Logistics and communication===\n[[File:The Battle of Frontiers, August-september 1914 Q70232.jpg|thumb|Belgian [[Carabiniers]] with dog drawn machine gun carts during the [[Battle of the Frontiers]] in 1914]]\nAbout the time [[World War I]] broke out, many European communities used dogs to pull small carts for milk deliveries and similar purposes.<ref name=\"Ouida\">{{cite book\n|last=[[Ouida]]\n|title=[[A Dog of Flanders]]\n|publisher=[[Chapman & Hall]] |year=1872}}</ref>\nSeveral European armies adapted the process for military use.<ref name=Dyer2006>{{cite book\n|last=Dyer |first=Walter A. |authorlink=Walter Alden Dyer\n|title=Pierrot the Carabinier: Dog of Belgium\n|publisher=Diggory Press |year=2006\n|isbn=978-1-84685-036-3}}</ref>\nIn August 1914, the [[Belgian Land Component|Belgian Army]] used dogs to pull their [[Maxim Gun]]s on wheeled carriages and supplies or reportedly even wounded in their [[cart]]s.<ref name=\"WILL\">{{cite book\n|title=First World War\n|last=Willmott |first=H.P.\n|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2003\n|page=59}}</ref> Two dogs of the sturdy and docile ''Martin Belge'' breed were used to pull each machine gun or ammunition cart.

The dog in question might be an officer's dog, an animal that the unit chose to adopt, or one of their canines employed in another role as a working dog. Some naval dogs such as [[Sinbad (USCG)|Sinbad]] and [[Judy (dog)|Judy]] were themselves enlisted service members. Some units also chose to employ a particular breed of dog as their standard mascot, with new dogs replacing the old when it died or was retired. The presence of a mascot was designed to uplift [[morale]], and many were used to this effect in the trenches of World War I. An example of this would be Sgt. Stubby for the US Army.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://3milliondogs.com/blog-assets-two/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2016-01-22-at-11.03.22-AM.png|title=Sgt.

They did not prove to be very effective under combat conditions. Marine mine detecting dogs were trained using bare electric wires beneath the ground surface.<ref>Putney, William. (2001) ''Always Faithful: A Memoir of the Marine Dogs of World War II'', New York: Simon & Schuster Inc. {{ISBN|0-7432-0198-1}}</ref> The wires shocked the dogs, teaching them that danger lurked under the dirt. Once the dog's focus was properly directed, dummy mines were planted and the dogs were trained to signal their presence. While the dogs effectively found the mines, the task proved so stressful for the dogs they were only able to work between 20 and 30 minutes at a time. The mine detecting war dogs anticipated random shocks from the heretofore friendly earth, making them extremely nervous.{{Clarify|date=December 2010}} The useful service life of the dogs was not long. Experiments with lab rats show that this trend can be very extreme, in some tests rats even huddled in the corner to the point of starvation to avoid electric shock.\n\nDogs have historically also been used in many cases to track fugitives and enemy troops, overlapping partly into the duties of a scout dog, but use their olfactory skill in tracking a scent, rather than warning a handler at the initial presentation of a scent.\n\n===Scouts===\n[[File:Marine-war-dogs.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marine Raiders]] take scouting and messenger dogs to the frontlines on [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], late 1943]]\n\nSome dogs are trained to silently locate [[booby trap]]s and concealed enemies such as snipers. The dog's keen senses of smell and hearing would make them far more effective at detecting these dangers than humans. The best scout dogs are described as having a disposition intermediate to docile tracking dogs and aggressive attack dogs.<ref name=\"SCOUT\"/>\nScouting dogs are able to identify the opposing threat within 1,000 yards of area.

They would bark or growl to alert guards of a stranger's presence. During the [[Cold War]], the American military used sentry dog teams outside of nuclear weapons storage areas. A test program was conducted in Vietnam to test sentry dogs, launched two days after a successful [[Vietcong]] attack on [[Da Nang Air Base]] (July 1, 1965). Forty dog teams were deployed to Vietnam for a four-month test period, with teams placed on the perimeter in front of machine gun towers/bunkers. The detection of intruders resulted in a rapid deployment of reinforcements. The test was successful, so the handlers returned to the US while the dogs were reassigned to new handlers. The Air Force immediately started to ship dog teams to all the bases in Vietnam and Thailand.\n\nThe buildup of American forces in Vietnam created large dog sections at USAF Southeast Asia (SEA) bases. 467 dogs were eventually assigned to [[Bien Hoa Air Base|Bien Hoa]], [[Binh Thuy Air Base|Binh Thuy]], [[Cam Ranh Air Base|Cam Ranh Bay]], [[Da Nang Air Base|Da Nang]], [[Nha Trang Air Base|Nha Trang]], [[Tuy Hoa Air Base|Tuy Hoa]], [[Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t Air Base|Ph\u00f9 C\u00e1t]], [[Phan Rang Air Base|Phan Rang]], [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base|Tan Son Nhut]], and [[Pleiku Air Base]]s. Within a year of deployment, attacks on several bases had been stopped when the enemy forces were detected by dog teams. Captured Vietcong told of the fear and respect that they had for the dogs. The Vietcong even placed a bounty on lives of handlers and dogs. The success of sentry dogs was determined by the lack of successful penetrations of bases in Vietnam and Thailand. It is estimated by the United States War Dogs Association that war dogs saved over 10,000 U.S. lives in Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web\n |accessdate  = 2008-07-08\n |url         = http://www.qmfound.com/War_Dogs.htm\n |title       = War Dogs\n |date        = January 9, 2007\n |publisher   = [[U.S. Army Quartermaster Museum]]\n |location    = Fort Lee, Virginia\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080523110604/http://www.qmfound.com/War_Dogs.htm\n |archivedate = May 23, 2008\n}}</ref> Sentry Dogs were also used by the Army, Navy, and Marines to protect the perimeter of a large bases\n\n===Modern uses===\n[[File:K-9 Andy.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. Army military working dog searches among rubble and trash outside a target building in [[Al-Rusafa, Iraq|Rusafa]], eastern Baghdad, Iraq.]]\nContemporary dogs in military roles are also often referred to as [[police dogs]], or in the United States and United Kingdom as a Military Working Dog (MWD), or K-9. Their roles are nearly as varied as those of their ancient cousins, though they tend to be more rarely used in front-line formations.

All MWDs in use today are paired with a single individual after their training. This person is called a handler. While a handler usually won't stay with one dog for the length of either's career, usually a handler will stay partnered with a dog for at least a year, and sometimes much longer.\n\nThe latest canine tactical vests are outfitted with cameras and durable microphones that allow dogs to relay audio and visual information to their handlers.\n\nIn the 1970s the [[US Air Force]] used over 1,600 dogs worldwide. Today, personnel cutbacks have reduced USAF dog teams to approximately 530, stationed throughout the world.

Police dogs can chase suspects, track them if they are hidden, and guard them when they are caught. They are trained to respond viciously if their handler is attacked, and otherwise not to react at all unless they are commanded to do so by their handler. Many police dogs are also trained in detection as well.\n\n====Drug and explosives detection====\n{{main|Detection dog}}\nBoth MWDs and their civilian counterparts provide service in drug detection, sniffing out a broad range of [[psychoactive substances]] despite efforts at concealment. Provided they have been trained to detect it, MWDs can smell small traces of nearly any substance, even if it is in a sealed container. [[Detection dog|Dogs trained in drug detection]] are normally used at ports of embarkation such as [[airports]], checkpoints, and other places where there is high security and a need for anti-[[contraband]] measures.\n\nMWDs can also be trained to detect [[explosives]]. As with narcotics, trained MWDs can detect minuscule amounts of a wide range of explosives, making them useful for searching entry points, patrolling within secure installations, and at checkpoints. These dogs are capable of achieving over a 98% success rate in bomb detection.<ref name=QMFound>{{cite web\n |accessdate  = 2008-07-08\n |url         = http://www.qmfound.com/War_Dogs.htm\n |title       = War Dogs\n |publisher   = U.S. Army Quartermaster Museum\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080523110604/http://www.qmfound.com/War_Dogs.htm\n |archivedate = 2008-05-23\n}}</ref>\n\n====Intimidation====\n[[File:Abu Ghraib 56.jpg|thumb|right|A bound prisoner in an orange [[jumpsuit]] is intimidated with a dog by a U.S. soldier, at [[Abu Ghraib prison]] ]]\n\nThe use of Military Working Dogs on prisoners by the United States during recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq has been controversial.\n\n[[Iraq War]]: The United States has used dogs to intimidate prisoners in Iraqi prisons.<ref name=SeattlePI_Goodman_20070829>{{cite news\n|accessdate= |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/opinion/329528_amy30.html\n|title=Gonzales' tortured legacy lingers |first=Amy |last=Goodman\n|date=August 29, 2007|work=[[Seattle Post Intelligencer]]}}</ref>\nIn court testimony following the revelations of [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse]], it was stated that Col.

It stars [[Sigourney Weaver]] reprising her role as [[Ellen Ripley]]. It is the third installment of the [[Alien (franchise)|''Alien'' franchise]].\n\nSet right after the events of ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', Ripley and an Alien organism are the only survivors of the Colonial Marine spaceship [[Sulaco (fictional spacecraft)|''Sulaco'']]'s escape pod's crash on a planet housing a penal colony populated by violent male inmates. Additional roles are played by [[Charles Dance]], [[Brian Glover]], [[Charles S. Dutton]], [[Ralph Brown]], [[Paul McGann]], [[Danny Webb (actor)|Danny Webb]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Holt McCallany]], [[Pete Postlethwaite]], and Danielle Edmond.\n\nThe film faced problems during production, including shooting without a script, with various screenwriters and directors attached. Fincher, in his [[List of directorial debuts|feature directorial debut]], was brought in to direct after a proposed version with [[Vincent Ward (director)|Vincent Ward]] as director was cancelled during pre-production.\n\n''Alien 3'' was released on May 22, 1992. While it underperformed at the American box office, it earned over $100 million outside North America. The film received mixed reviews and was regarded as inferior to previous installments. Fincher has since disowned the film, blaming studio interference and deadlines. It was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], seven [[Saturn Award]]s ([[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]], [[Saturn Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] for Weaver, [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Dutton, [[Saturn Award for Best Director|Best Direction]] for Fincher, and [[Saturn Award for Best Writing|Best Writing]] for Giler, Hill, and Ferguson), a [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Best Dramatic Presentation]], and an [[MTV Movie & TV Awards|MTV Movie Award]] for [[MTV Movie Award for Best Action Sequence|Best Action Sequence]].

The computer launches an escape pod containing [[Ellen Ripley]], the young girl Newt, [[Dwayne Hicks|Hicks]], and the damaged [[Android (robot)|android]] [[Bishop (Aliens)|Bishop]]; all four are in [[Cryonics|cryonic]] [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]]. Scans of the crew's [[Cryonics|cryotubes]] show a [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Facehugger|Queen Facehugger]] attached to one member. The pod crash-lands on Fiorina \"Fury\" 161, a [[foundry]] facility and [[penal colony]] inhabited by male inmates with [[XYY syndrome|double-Y chromosome syndrome]], a genetic mutation which gives the afflicted individual a predisposition for antisocial behavior. The inmates recover the crashed pod and its passengers. The same Facehugger is seen approaching inmate Thomas Murphy's dog, Spike.\n<!-- PLEASE NOTE: Do not change the plot summary to say that the alien comes from an \"ox\", \"bull\" or \"cow\" rather than a dog. In the theatrical version of the film, the alien comes from a dog. There are two different versions of the film. These differences are discussed in the section of this article titled \"Special Edition DVD\". -->\n\nRipley is awakened by Clemens, the prison doctor, who informs her that she is the sole survivor. She is warned by the prison warden, Harold Andrews, that her presence may have disruptive effects. Ripley insists that Clemens perform an [[autopsy]] on Newt, secretly fearing that Newt may be carrying an Alien embryo. Despite protests from the warden and his assistant Aaron, the autopsy is conducted and no embryo is found. The bodies of Newt and Hicks are cremated.\n\nElsewhere in the prison, a quadrupedal alien bursts from Spike. Growing to full size, the alien kills Murphy, Boggs, and Rains and returns outcast prisoner Golic to his previously psychopathic state \u2014 Golic dubs the creature \"the Dragon\". Ripley finds the damaged Bishop in the prison's garbage dump. Just as she is leaving the area, she is cornered by four inmates and almost raped. After being saved by inmate leader Dillon, Ripley returns to the infirmary and re-activates Bishop, who confirms that a Facehugger came with them to Fiorina in the escape pod. Ripley informs Andrews of [[Aliens (film)|her previous encounter with the Xenomorphs]]<ref>The Alien species is defined as \"Xenomorph\" within the previous film ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', and is later referred to as \"Xenomorph\" by Ripley when she is sending an email to Weyland-Yutani.</ref> and suggests everyone work together to hunt down and kill it. The highly skeptical Andrews does not believe her story, and explains that even if she were telling the truth, the facility is without weapons; their only hope is the rescue ship being sent for Ripley by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.\n\nThe Alien ambushes Ripley and Clemens in the prison [[First aid room|infirmary]], killing him, and almost slays Ripley, but then mysteriously spares her and retreats. Ripley then rushes to the cafeteria to warn the others. Andrews orders Aaron to take her back to the infirmary, but the warden himself is dragged into the vents and killed by the monster. Ripley rallies the inmates and proposes they pour flammable toxic waste into the ventilation system and ignite it to flush out the extraterrestrial. However, its intervention causes a premature explosion and several inmates are killed. With Aaron's help, Ripley scans herself using the escape pod's medical equipment and discovers the embryo of an [[Alien Queen]] growing inside her. She also discovers that Weyland-Yutani hopes to turn the aliens into [[biological warfare|biological weapons]].\n\nDeducing that the Alien will not kill her because of the embryo she carries, Ripley begs Dillon to kill her; he agrees only if she helps the inmates kill the Alien first. They form a plan to lure the Alien into the foundry's molding facility, trap it via a series of closing doors, and drown it in molten [[lead]]. The bait-and-chase plan results in the deaths of all the remaining prisoners except Dillon and Morse. Dillon sacrifices himself to position the Alien towards the mold as Morse pours the molten lead onto them. Although the alien is covered in molten metal, it escapes the mold but Ripley activates the fire sprinklers, causing its molten metal exoskeleton to [[thermal shock|cool rapidly and shatter]], blowing it apart.\n\nThe Weyland\u2013Yutani team arrives, including scientists, heavily armed commandos and a man who looks identical to Bishop,<ref>Identified as '''Michael Bishop Weyland''' in tie-in materials.</ref> who explains that he is Bishop's creator. He tries to persuade Ripley to undergo surgery to remove the Alien Queen embryo, which he falsely claims will be destroyed. Ripley refuses and steps back onto a mobile platform, which Morse positions over the furnace. The Weyland\u2013Yutani team shoot Morse in the leg in an attempt to stop him; Aaron, believing the Bishop look-alike is an android, strikes the man with a wrench and is killed by the commandos. Ignoring Bishop's pleas to give them the embryo, Ripley throws herself into the furnace, killing herself. The facilities are closed down and almost all was forgotten. Morse, the sole survivor, is led away as Ripley's recording from the first film plays for the final time in the EEV.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Alien characters#Alien 3|l1=List of Alien characters}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as [[Ellen Ripley]], reprising her role from the previous two ''Alien'' films. Ripley crash-lands on Fiorina 161 and is once again burdened with the task of destroying another of the alien creatures. Sigourney was  hesitant of returning, but approved of David Twohy\u2019s work and signed on but demanded a larger salary of $4-5 million, plus co-producing credit.

The prisoners refer to him by the nickname \"85\", after his [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] score, which annoys him. He opposes Ripley's insistence that the prisoners must try to fight the alien, and repudiates her claim that Weyland\u2013Yutani will collect the alien instead of them.\n* [[Paul McGann]] as Walter Golic. A mass-murderer and outcast amongst the prison population, Golic becomes very disturbed after being assaulted by the alien in the prison's underground network of tunnels, gradually becoming more and more obsessed with the alien.

The ship is boarded by people from the U.P.P., who are attacked by a facehugger hiding in the entrails of Bishop's mangled body. The soldiers blast the facehugger into space and take Bishop with them for further study. The ''Sulaco'' then arrives at a space station\u2013shopping mall hybrid named Anchorpoint.

Afterwards, it moved into a small-town U.S. city in a type of bio-dome in space, culminating in an all-out battle with the townsfolk facing hordes of Alien warriors. Brandywine rejected Red's script for deviating too much from their story, and eventually gave up on developing two sequels simultaneously.<ref name=\"bald\"/> Writer [[David Twohy]] was next to work on the project, being instructed to start with Gibson's script. Once the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of Communism]] made the Cold War analogies outdated, Twohy changed his setting to a prison planet, which was being used for illegal experiments on the aliens for a Biological Warfare division.<ref name=bald/> Harlin felt this approach was too similar to the previous movies, and, tired of the [[development hell]], walked out on the project, which led Fox to offer Harlin ''[[The Adventures of Ford Fairlane]]''.<ref>{{cite web | last=Bibbiani | first=William | date=August 17, 2011 | title=Interview: Renny Harlin on '5 Days of War' | publisher=[[CraveOnline|Crave]] | url=http://www.craveonline.com/film/interviews/172837-interview-renny-harlin-on-5-days-of-war | access-date=August 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTwohy's script was delivered to Fox president [[Joe Roth]], who did not like the idea of Ripley being removed, declaring that \"Sigourney Weaver is the centerpiece of the series\" and Ripley was \"really the only female warrior we have in our movie mythology.\"<ref name=Jolin/> Weaver was then called, with a reported $5 million salary, plus a share of the box office receipts.<ref name=\"last\"/> She also requested the story to be suitably impressive, original and non-dependent on guns. Twohy duly set about writing Ripley into his screenplay.<ref name=Jolin/>\n\n===Start-up with Vincent Ward===\nOnce Hill attended a screening of ''[[The Navigator: A Medieval Odyssey]]'', he decided to invite its director, [[Vincent Ward (director)|Vincent Ward]]. Ward, who was in London developing ''[[Map of the Human Heart]]'',<ref name=\"bald\"/> only accepted the project on the third call as he at first was uninterested in doing a sequel. Ward thought little of the Twohy script, and instead worked up another idea, involving Ripley's escape pod crash landing on a monastery-like satellite. Having developed this pitch on his flight to Los Angeles, once Ward got with the studio executives he saw his idea approved by the studio. Ward was hired to direct ''Alien 3'', and writer John Fasano was hired to expand his story into a screenplay.<ref name=\"wreckage\"/> Once Twohy discovered through a journalist friend that another script was being written concurrently with his, he went after Fox and eventually left the project.<ref>{{cite web | last=Stovall | first=Ada | date=September 24, 2013 | title=Riddick's David Twohy | publisher=Creative Screenwriting | url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/david-twohy-is-a-hard-working-man/ | access-date=August 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWard envisioned a planet whose interior was both wooden and archaic in design, where [[Luddite]]-like monks would take refuge. The story begins with a monk who sees a \"star in the East\" (Ripley's escape pod) and at first believes this to be a good omen. Upon arrival of Ripley, and with increasing suggestions of the Alien presence, the monk inhabitants believe it to be some sort of religious trial for their misdemeanors, punishable by the creature that haunts them. By having a woman in their monastery, they wonder if their trial is partially caused by sexual temptation, as Ripley is the only woman to be amongst the all-male community in ten years. To avoid this belief and (hopefully) the much grimmer reality of what she has brought with her, the Monks of the \"wooden satellite\" lock Ripley into a dungeon-like sewer and ignore her advice on the true nature of the beast.<ref>vincentwardfilms.com, Alien 3 Unrequited Vision, retrieved on 2009:10:30 http://www.vincentwardfilms.com/concepts/alien-3/unrequited-vision/{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The monks believe that the Alien is in fact the Devil. Primarily though, this story was about Ripley's own soul-searching complicated by the seeding of the Alien within her and further hampered by her largely solo attempts to defeat it. Eventually Ripley decides to sacrifice herself to kill the Alien. Fox asked for an alternative ending in which Ripley survived, but Weaver would only agree to the film if Ripley died.<ref name=\"wreckage\"/>\n\n''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine described Ward's 'Wooden Planet' concept as 'undeniably attractive\u2014it would have been visually arresting and at the very least, could have made for some astonishing action sequences.' In the same article, Norman Reynolds\u2014Production Designer originally hired by Ward\u2014remembers an early design idea for \"a wooden library shaft.

The producers at Brandywine discussed the logical problems of creating and maintaining a wooden planet in space, while Fox executive [[Jon Landau (film producer)|Jon Landau]] considered Ward's vision to be \"more bent on the artsy-fartsy side than the big commercial one\" that Ridley Scott and James Cameron employed. Ward managed to dissuade the producers of their idea of turning the planet into an ore refinery and the monks into prisoners, but eventually Fox asked a meeting with the director imposing a list of changes to be made. Refusing to do so, Ward was fired. The main plot of the finished film still follows Ward's basic structure.<ref name=\"wreckage\"/>\n\n===Walter Hill and David Giler's script===\nHill and Giler did a first draft trying to enhance the story structure on the Fasano script, and feeling creatively drained hired [[Larry Ferguson (screenwriter)|Larry Ferguson]] as a [[script doctor]]. Ferguson's work was not well received in the production, particularly by Sigourney Weaver, who felt Ferguson made Ripley sound like \"a pissed-off gym teacher\". Short on time before filming was due to commence, producers Walter Hill and David Giler took control of the screenplay themselves, melding aspects of the Ward/Fasano script with Twohy's earlier prison planet screenplay to create the basis of the final film.<ref name=bald/> Sigourney Weaver had also had a clause written into her contract stating the final draft should be written by Hill and Giler, believing that they were the only writers (besides James Cameron) to write the character of Ripley effectively.<ref name=wreckage/> Fox approached music video director [[David Fincher]] to replace Ward.<ref>{{cite magazine | last=Pearce | first=Garth | date=1991 | title=Alien3: Set Visit To A Troubled Sequel | magazine=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] | url=https://empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1102 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703222946/https://empireonline.com/interviews/interview.asp?IID=1102 | archive-date=July 3, 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> Fincher did further work on the screenplay with author [[Rex Pickett]], and despite Pickett being fired and Hill and Giler writing the final draft of the screenplay, he revised most of the work done by the previous authors.<ref>{{cite book | editor1-last=Knapp | editor1-first=Laurence F. | last=Richardson | first=John H. | date=2014 | title=David Fincher: Interviews | series=Conversations with Filmmakers Series | chapter=Mother from Another Planet | page=23 | location=Jackson, Miss. | publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]] | isbn=978-1-628460-36-0}}</ref> Fincher wanted [[Gary Oldman]] to star in the film, but the pair \"couldn't work it out\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917030311/http://www.playboy.com/articles/playboy-interview-david-fincher|title=Interview: David Fincher|last=Rebello|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen Rebello|date=16 September 2014|website=[[Playboy]]|access-date=16 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Filming===\nFilming began on January 14, 1991, at [[Pinewood Studios]] without a finished script and with $7 million already having been spent.<ref name=\"last\" /> While a majority of the film was shot at Pinewood, some scenes were shot at [[Blyth Power Station]] in Northumberland, UK.<ref name=\"sine_project\">{{cite web|title=Structure details |work=SINE Project (Structural Images of the North East) |publisher=[[Newcastle University]] |url=http://www.sine.ncl.ac.uk/view_structure_information.asp?struct_id=301 |accessdate=June 9, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312201030/http://sine.ncl.ac.uk/view_structure_information.asp?struct_id=301 |archivedate=March 12, 2008 }}</ref> The purpose of these shots were to show the exterior of the planet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wtfdvds.com/all-dvds-1/alien-3-workprint-1992-dvd-43.html|title=Alien 3 Workprint (1992) DVD|accessdate=January 20, 2009|publisher=WTFDVDs|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123184215/http://wtfdvds.com/all-dvds-1/alien-3-workprint-1992-dvd-43.html <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=January 23, 2009}}</ref> [[Cinematographer]] [[Jordan Cronenweth]] worked only for two weeks before he started suffering from [[Parkinson's disease]], and was forced out of the film by a line producer who had lost his father to the disease several years previously, and knew that if anything, the demanding schedule would likely take a fatal toll on Cronenweth's health.

Winston instead recommended Tom Woodruff Jr. and Alec Gillis, two former workers of his studio who had just started their own company, [[Amalgamated Dynamics]].<ref name=\"fright\"/> Even before principal photography had begun, the practical effects crew was developing models of the Alien and the corpses of the ''Sulaco'' victims. [[Richard Edlund]]'s [[Boss Film Studios]] was hired for [[compositing]] and other post-production effects.<ref name=wreckage/> A small number of shots contain [[computer-generated imagery]], most notably the cracking alien head once the sprinklers cause thermal shock. Other CGI elements include shadows cast by the rod puppet alien, and airborne debris in outdoor scenes.<ref name=\"Visual Effects\"/>\n\nDavid Fincher wanted the alien to be, \"more of a puma, or a beast\" as opposed to the upright, humanoid posture of the previous films, so the designer of the original alien, [[H. R. Giger]], was contacted to generate new sketch ideas. His revisions included longer, thinner legs, the removal of \"pipes\" around the spine, and an idea for a sharp alien \"tongue\" in place of the secondary jaws. Working from his studio in Zurich, Giger produced these new sketches which he faxed to Cornelius de Fries who then created their model counterparts out of [[plasticine]].<ref name=\"xeno\">{{cite video  | title=Xeno-Erotic: The H.R. Giger Redesign\" | medium=DVD | location=Alien Quadrilogy (Alien 3) bonus disc  | publisher=Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment |date=2003}}</ref> The only one of Giger's designs that wound up in the final project was a \"Bambi Burster\" Alien that had long legs and walked on all fours. ADI also built a full-scale [[Bunraku]]-style puppet of this design which was operated on-set as an in-camera effect. Scenes using this approach were cut from the final release due to the limitations of chemical compositing techniques, making it exceedingly difficult to remove the puppeteers from the background plate, but can be seen in the \"Assembly Cut\" of the film.<ref name=\"optical\" />\n\nThe Alien is portrayed by both Woodruff Jr. in a suit and a [[Rod puppets|rod puppet]] filmed against [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] and optically [[Compositing|composited]] into the live-action footage, with the rods removed by [[rotoscoping]]. A mechanical alien head was also used for [[close-up]]s.<ref name=\"Visual Effects\">{{cite video | people=Fredrick Garvin (Director) | title=The Making of Alien 3 | medium=DVD | location=United States | publisher=Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment |date=2003}}</ref> The suit adapted the design used in ''Aliens'' so Woodruff could walk on all fours.<ref name=\"fright\"/> Woodruff's head was contained in the neck of the suit, because the head was filled with [[animatronics]] to move the mouth of the Alien.<ref name=\"shock\" /> Fincher suggested that a [[Whippet]] be dressed in an alien costume for on-set [[Camera coverage|coverage]] of the [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] alien, but the visual effects team was dissatisfied with the comical result and the idea was dropped in favor of the puppet.<ref name=\"Visual Effects\"/>\n\nThe rod-puppet approach was chosen for the production rather than [[stop motion|stop-motion animation]] which did not provide the required smoothness to appear realistic. As a result, the rod-puppet allowed for a fast alien that could move across surfaces of any orientation and be shot from any angle.<ref name=\"optical\">{{cite video | people=David Fincher (Director) | title=Alien Quadrilogy (Alien 3) bonus disc \"Optical Fury\" | medium=DVD | location=United States | publisher=Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment |date=2003}}</ref> This was particularly effective as it was able to accomplish movements not feasible by an actor in a suit.

The data output was then taken back to the studio and fed into the motion control cameras with the linear dimensions scaled down to match the puppet.<ref name=\"optical\" />\n\nTo make syncing the puppet's actions with the live-action shots easier, the effects team developed an instant compositing system using [[LaserDisc]]. This allowed takes to be quickly overlaid on the background plate so the crew could observe whether any spatial adjustments were required.<ref name=\"optical\" />\n\nLaine Liska was hired to lead a team of puppeteers in a new process dubbed \"Mo-Motion\" where the rod puppet would be simultaneously manipulated and filmed with a moving [[motion control photography|motion control camera]].<ref name=\"optical\" /> Depending on the complexity of the shot, the puppet was operated by 4\u20136 people.<ref name=\"imagi\" /> Sparse sets were created as they provided freedom of motion for the puppeteers as well as large, solid surfaces for the puppet to act within a three dimensional space.<ref name=\"optical\" />\n\nThe crew were pushed to make the movements of the Alien as quick as possible to the point where they were barely in control, and this led to, according to Edlund, \"the occasional serendipitous action that made the alien have a character.\" The ease of this setup allowed the crew to film 60\u201370 takes of a single scene.<ref name=\"optical\" />\n\nHoping to give the destroyed Bishop a more complex look that could not be done by simple make-up, the final product was done entirely through animatronics, while a playback of Lance Henriksen's voice played to guide Sigourney Weaver.<ref name=\"wreckage\" />\n\nScenes of the Emergency Escape Vehicle were shot with a 3.5-foot [[scale model|miniature]] against a blue-screen and composited onto large scale traditional [[matte painting]]s of the planet's surface. To make the clouds glow from within as the EEV entered the atmosphere, the painting's values were digitally reversed and animated frame by frame.

A VHS boxed set titled ''The Alien Trilogy'' containing ''Alien 3'' along with ''Alien'' and ''Aliens'' was released in [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|facehugger]]-shaped carrying cases, and included some of the deleted scenes from the LaserDisc editions. When ''Alien Resurrection'' premiered in theaters in 1997, another boxed set of the first three films was released titled ''The Alien Saga'', which included a ''Making of Alien Resurrection'' tape. A few months later, this set was re-released with the ''Alien Resurrection'' film taking the place of the making-of video. In 1999, ''Alien 3'' was released on [[DVD-Video|DVD]], both singly and packaged with the other three ''Alien'' films as ''The Alien Legacy'' boxed set. This set was also released in a VHS version and would be the last VHS release of the film. In 2003, ''Alien 3'' would be included in the 9-disc ''Alien Quadrilogy'' DVD set which contained two versions of the film (see below). The first three films were also later packaged as the ''Alien Triple Pack'' DVD set (this release was identical to the 1999 ''Alien Legacy'' set but excluding ''Alien Resurrection'').\n''Alien 3'' was first released on [[Blu-ray]] in 2010, as part of the 6-disc ''Alien Anthology'' boxed set which included all of the features from the ''Alien Quadrilogy'' DVD set and more.

She is warned by the prison warden, Harold Andrews, that her presence may have disruptive effects. Ripley insists that Clemens perform an [[autopsy]] on Newt, secretly fearing that Newt may be carrying an Alien embryo. Despite protests from the warden and his assistant Aaron, the autopsy is conducted and no embryo is found. The bodies of Newt and Hicks are cremated.\n\nElsewhere in the prison, a quadrupedal alien bursts from Spike. Growing to full size, the alien kills Murphy, Boggs, and Rains and returns outcast prisoner Golic to his previously psychopathic state \u2014 Golic dubs the creature \"the Dragon\". Ripley finds the damaged Bishop in the prison's garbage dump. Just as she is leaving the area, she is cornered by four inmates and almost raped. After being saved by inmate leader Dillon, Ripley returns to the infirmary and re-activates Bishop, who confirms that a Facehugger came with them to Fiorina in the escape pod. Ripley informs Andrews of [[Aliens (film)|her previous encounter with the Xenomorphs]]<ref>The Alien species is defined as \"Xenomorph\" within the previous film ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', and is later referred to as \"Xenomorph\" by Ripley when she is sending an email to Weyland-Yutani.</ref> and suggests everyone work together to hunt down and kill it. The highly skeptical Andrews does not believe her story, and explains that even if she were telling the truth, the facility is without weapons; their only hope is the rescue ship being sent for Ripley by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation.\n\nThe Alien ambushes Ripley and Clemens in the prison [[First aid room|infirmary]], killing him, and almost slays Ripley, but then mysteriously spares her and retreats. Ripley then rushes to the cafeteria to warn the others. Andrews orders Aaron to take her back to the infirmary, but the warden himself is dragged into the vents and killed by the monster. Ripley rallies the inmates and proposes they pour flammable toxic waste into the ventilation system and ignite it to flush out the extraterrestrial. However, its intervention causes a premature explosion and several inmates are killed. With Aaron's help, Ripley scans herself using the escape pod's medical equipment and discovers the embryo of an [[Alien Queen]] growing inside her. She also discovers that Weyland-Yutani hopes to turn the aliens into [[biological warfare|biological weapons]].\n\nDeducing that the Alien will not kill her because of the embryo she carries, Ripley begs Dillon to kill her; he agrees only if she helps the inmates kill the Alien first. They form a plan to lure the Alien into the foundry's molding facility, trap it via a series of closing doors, and drown it in molten [[lead]]. The bait-and-chase plan results in the deaths of all the remaining prisoners except Dillon and Morse. Dillon sacrifices himself to position the Alien towards the mold as Morse pours the molten lead onto them. Although the alien is covered in molten metal, it escapes the mold but Ripley activates the fire sprinklers, causing its molten metal exoskeleton to [[thermal shock|cool rapidly and shatter]], blowing it apart.\n\nThe Weyland\u2013Yutani team arrives, including scientists, heavily armed commandos and a man who looks identical to Bishop,<ref>Identified as '''Michael Bishop Weyland''' in tie-in materials.</ref> who explains that he is Bishop's creator. He tries to persuade Ripley to undergo surgery to remove the Alien Queen embryo, which he falsely claims will be destroyed. Ripley refuses and steps back onto a mobile platform, which Morse positions over the furnace. The Weyland\u2013Yutani team shoot Morse in the leg in an attempt to stop him; Aaron, believing the Bishop look-alike is an android, strikes the man with a wrench and is killed by the commandos. Ignoring Bishop's pleas to give them the embryo, Ripley throws herself into the furnace, killing herself. The facilities are closed down and almost all was forgotten. Morse, the sole survivor, is led away as Ripley's recording from the first film plays for the final time in the EEV.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Alien characters#Alien 3|l1=List of Alien characters}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Sigourney Weaver]] as [[Ellen Ripley]], reprising her role from the previous two ''Alien'' films.

The ship is boarded by people from the U.P.P., who are attacked by a facehugger hiding in the entrails of Bishop's mangled body.

Ward, who was in London developing ''[[Map of the Human Heart]]'',<ref name=\"bald\"/> only accepted the project on the third call as he at first was uninterested in doing a sequel. Ward thought little of the Twohy script, and instead worked up another idea, involving Ripley's escape pod crash landing on a monastery-like satellite. Having developed this pitch on his flight to Los Angeles, once Ward got with the studio executives he saw his idea approved by the studio. Ward was hired to direct ''Alien 3'', and writer John Fasano was hired to expand his story into a screenplay.<ref name=\"wreckage\"/> Once Twohy discovered through a journalist friend that another script was being written concurrently with his, he went after Fox and eventually left the project.<ref>{{cite web | last=Stovall | first=Ada | date=September 24, 2013 | title=Riddick's David Twohy | publisher=Creative Screenwriting | url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/david-twohy-is-a-hard-working-man/ | access-date=August 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWard envisioned a planet whose interior was both wooden and archaic in design, where [[Luddite]]-like monks would take refuge. The story begins with a monk who sees a \"star in the East\" (Ripley's escape pod) and at first believes this to be a good omen. Upon arrival of Ripley, and with increasing suggestions of the Alien presence, the monk inhabitants believe it to be some sort of religious trial for their misdemeanors, punishable by the creature that haunts them. By having a woman in their monastery, they wonder if their trial is partially caused by sexual temptation, as Ripley is the only woman to be amongst the all-male community in ten years. To avoid this belief and (hopefully) the much grimmer reality of what she has brought with her, the Monks of the \"wooden satellite\" lock Ripley into a dungeon-like sewer and ignore her advice on the true nature of the beast.<ref>vincentwardfilms.com, Alien 3 Unrequited Vision, retrieved on 2009:10:30 http://www.vincentwardfilms.com/concepts/alien-3/unrequited-vision/{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The monks believe that the Alien is in fact the Devil. Primarily though, this story was about Ripley's own soul-searching complicated by the seeding of the Alien within her and further hampered by her largely solo attempts to defeat it. Eventually Ripley decides to sacrifice herself to kill the Alien. Fox asked for an alternative ending in which Ripley survived, but Weaver would only agree to the film if Ripley died.<ref name=\"wreckage\"/>\n\n''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine described Ward's 'Wooden Planet' concept as 'undeniably attractive\u2014it would have been visually arresting and at the very least, could have made for some astonishing action sequences.'

The producers at Brandywine discussed the logical problems of creating and maintaining a wooden planet in space, while Fox executive [[Jon Landau (film producer)|Jon Landau]] considered Ward's vision to be \"more bent on the artsy-fartsy side than the big commercial one\" that Ridley Scott and James Cameron employed. Ward managed to dissuade the producers of their idea of turning the planet into an ore refinery and the monks into prisoners, but eventually Fox asked a meeting with the director imposing a list of changes to be made. Refusing to do so, Ward was fired. The main plot of the finished film still follows Ward's basic structure.<ref name=\"wreckage\"/>\n\n===Walter Hill and David Giler's script===\nHill and Giler did a first draft trying to enhance the story structure on the Fasano script, and feeling creatively drained hired [[Larry Ferguson (screenwriter)|Larry Ferguson]] as a [[script doctor]].

Working from his studio in Zurich, Giger produced these new sketches which he faxed to Cornelius de Fries who then created their model counterparts out of [[plasticine]].<ref name=\"xeno\">{{cite video  | title=Xeno-Erotic: The H.R. Giger Redesign\" | medium=DVD | location=Alien Quadrilogy (Alien 3) bonus disc  | publisher=Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment |date=2003}}</ref> The only one of Giger's designs that wound up in the final project was a \"Bambi Burster\" Alien that had long legs and walked on all fours. ADI also built a full-scale [[Bunraku]]-style puppet of this design which was operated on-set as an in-camera effect. Scenes using this approach were cut from the final release due to the limitations of chemical compositing techniques, making it exceedingly difficult to remove the puppeteers from the background plate, but can be seen in the \"Assembly Cut\" of the film.<ref name=\"optical\" />\n\nThe Alien is portrayed by both Woodruff Jr. in a suit and a [[Rod puppets|rod puppet]] filmed against [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] and optically [[Compositing|composited]] into the live-action footage, with the rods removed by [[rotoscoping]]. A mechanical alien head was also used for [[close-up]]s.<ref name=\"Visual Effects\">{{cite video | people=Fredrick Garvin (Director) | title=The Making of Alien 3 | medium=DVD | location=United States | publisher=Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment |date=2003}}</ref> The suit adapted the design used in ''Aliens'' so Woodruff could walk on all fours.<ref name=\"fright\"/> Woodruff's head was contained in the neck of the suit, because the head was filled with [[animatronics]] to move the mouth of the Alien.<ref name=\"shock\" /> Fincher suggested that a [[Whippet]] be dressed in an alien costume for on-set [[Camera coverage|coverage]] of the [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] alien, but the visual effects team was dissatisfied with the comical result and the idea was dropped in favor of the puppet.<ref name=\"Visual Effects\"/>\n\nThe rod-puppet approach was chosen for the production rather than [[stop motion|stop-motion animation]] which did not provide the required smoothness to appear realistic. As a result, the rod-puppet allowed for a fast alien that could move across surfaces of any orientation and be shot from any angle.<ref name=\"optical\">{{cite video | people=David Fincher (Director) | title=Alien Quadrilogy (Alien 3) bonus disc \"Optical Fury\" | medium=DVD | location=United States | publisher=Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment |date=2003}}</ref> This was particularly effective as it was able to accomplish movements not feasible by an actor in a suit. The \u2153-scale puppet was 40 inches long and cast in foam rubber over a bicycle chain armature for flexibility.<ref name=\"imagi\">{{cite journal |year=1994 |title=H.R. Giger |journal=Imagi-Movies Magazine |volume=1 |issue=3 }}</ref> For moving camera shots, the on-set cameras were equipped with digital recorders to track, pan, tilt, and dolly values. The data output was then taken back to the studio and fed into the motion control cameras with the linear dimensions scaled down to match the puppet.<ref name=\"optical\" />\n\nTo make syncing the puppet's actions with the live-action shots easier, the effects team developed an instant compositing system using [[LaserDisc]]. This allowed takes to be quickly overlaid on the background plate so the crew could observe whether any spatial adjustments were required.<ref name=\"optical\" />\n\nLaine Liska was hired to lead a team of puppeteers in a new process dubbed \"Mo-Motion\" where the rod puppet would be simultaneously manipulated and filmed with a moving [[motion control photography|motion control camera]].<ref name=\"optical\" /> Depending on the complexity of the shot, the puppet was operated by 4\u20136 people.<ref name=\"imagi\" /> Sparse sets were created as they provided freedom of motion for the puppeteers as well as large, solid surfaces for the puppet to act within a three dimensional space.<ref name=\"optical\" />\n\nThe crew were pushed to make the movements of the Alien as quick as possible to the point where they were barely in control, and this led to, according to Edlund, \"the occasional serendipitous action that made the alien have a character.\" The ease of this setup allowed the crew to film 60\u201370 takes of a single scene.<ref name=\"optical\" />\n\nHoping to give the destroyed Bishop a more complex look that could not be done by simple make-up, the final product was done entirely through animatronics, while a playback of Lance Henriksen's voice played to guide Sigourney Weaver.<ref name=\"wreckage\" />\n\nScenes of the Emergency Escape Vehicle were shot with a 3.5-foot [[scale model|miniature]] against a blue-screen and composited onto large scale traditional [[matte painting]]s of the planet's surface. To make the clouds glow from within as the EEV entered the atmosphere, the painting's values were digitally reversed and animated frame by frame. The scene in which the EEV is moved by a crane-arm (also a miniature) was created by projecting a video of actors onto pieces of cardboard and then compositing them into the scene as silhouettes against the matte-painted background.<ref name=\"optical\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Alien 3 (soundtrack)}}\nThe film's composer, [[Elliot Goldenthal]], spent a year composing the score by working closely with Fincher to create music based primarily on the surroundings and atmosphere of the film itself. The score was recorded during the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], which Goldenthal later claimed contributed to the score's disturbing nature.<ref>\"Music, Editing and Sound\"; ''Alien<sup>3</sup>'' bonus disc, Alien ''[[Quadrilogy]]''</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\nThe film was released in the United States on May 22, 1992.

The first of these were on [[VHS]] and [[LaserDisc]], and several subsequent VHS releases were sold both singly and as [[box set|boxed sets]] throughout the 1990s. A VHS boxed set titled ''The Alien Trilogy'' containing ''Alien 3'' along with ''Alien'' and ''Aliens'' was released in [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|facehugger]]-shaped carrying cases, and included some of the deleted scenes from the LaserDisc editions. When ''Alien Resurrection'' premiered in theaters in 1997, another boxed set of the first three films was released titled ''The Alien Saga'', which included a ''Making of Alien Resurrection'' tape. A few months later, this set was re-released with the ''Alien Resurrection'' film taking the place of the making-of video. In 1999, ''Alien 3'' was released on [[DVD-Video|DVD]], both singly and packaged with the other three ''Alien'' films as ''The Alien Legacy'' boxed set. This set was also released in a VHS version and would be the last VHS release of the film. In 2003, ''Alien 3'' would be included in the 9-disc ''Alien Quadrilogy'' DVD set which contained two versions of the film (see below). The first three films were also later packaged as the ''Alien Triple Pack'' DVD set (this release was identical to the 1999 ''Alien Legacy'' set but excluding ''Alien Resurrection'').\n''Alien 3'' was first released on [[Blu-ray]] in 2010, as part of the 6-disc ''Alien Anthology'' boxed set which included all of the features from the ''Alien Quadrilogy'' DVD set and more.
