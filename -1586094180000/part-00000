His death led to the [[1383\u201385 Crisis|1383\u201385 crisis]], also known as the Portuguese [[interregnum]].\n\n== Life==\nFerdinand was born in Coimbra, the second but eldest surviving son of [[Peter I of Portugal|Peter I]] and his wife, Constanza Manuel.<ref name=Adam>[https://books.google.com/books?id=NdgCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA560 ''Spain and Portugal'', Graeme Mercer Adam ed., J. D. Morris, 1906]</ref> On the death of [[Peter of Castile]] in 1369, Ferdinand, as great-grandson of [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho IV]] by his grandmother [[Beatrice of Castile (1293\u20131359)|Beatrice]], laid claim to the vacant Castilian throne. The kings of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], and later [[John of Gaunt|John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster]], who had married Peter of Castile's eldest daughter, Constance, also claimed the throne.\n\nThe throne was held by his second cousin [[Henry II of Castile|Henry of Trast\u00e1mara]] (Henry II of Castile), Peter of Castile's illegitimate brother, who had defeated him in the [[Castilian Civil War]] in 1366 and assumed the crown. After one or two indecisive campaigns, all parties were ready to accept the mediation of [[Pope Gregory XI]]. The conditions of the treaty, ratified in 1371, included a marriage between Ferdinand and [[Eleanor of Castile, Queen of Navarre|Leonora of Castile]]. But before the union could take place Ferdinand had become passionately attached to [[Leonor Telles de Meneses]], the wife of one of his own courtiers. Having procured a dissolution of her previous marriage, he lost no time in making Leonor his queen.<ref name=Adam/>\n[[File:Chapelle Ardente of the King of Portugal, with hatchments - Chronique d' Angleterre (Volume III) (late 15th C), f.217v - BL Royal MS 14 E IV.png|thumb|left|''The Funeral of D. Fernando'' from the ''Chronique d' Angleterre''; Jean de Wavrin, late 14th century.]]\nThis conduct, although it raised a serious insurrection in Portugal, did not at once result in a war with Henry.  However, the outward concord was soon disturbed by intrigues with [[John of Gaunt]], Duke of Lancaster, brother of [[Edward the Black Prince]], who entered into a secret treaty with Ferdinand for the expulsion of Henry from his throne. The war which followed was unsuccessful; and peace was again made in 1373.\n\nOn the death of Henry in 1379, the Duke of Lancaster once more put forward his claims, and again found an ally in Portugal. According to the Continental annalists, the English proved as offensive to their allies as to their enemies in the field. So Ferdinand made a peace for himself at [[Badajoz]] in 1382. It stipulated that [[Beatrice of Portugal|Beatrice]], Ferdinand's daughter and heiress, would marry King [[John I of Castile]], and thus secure the ultimate union of the two crowns.\n\nFerdinand left no male heir when he died, probably from poisoning, at  Lisbon on  22 October 1383, and the direct [[Portuguese House of Burgundy|Burgundian]] line, which had been in possession of the throne since the days of [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Count Henry]] (about 1112), became extinct. The stipulations of the treaty of Badajoz were set aside, and [[John I of Portugal|John]], Grand Master of the [[order of Aviz]], Ferdinand's illegitimate brother, claimed the throne.

His death led to the [[1383\u201385 Crisis|1383\u201385 crisis]], also known as the Portuguese [[interregnum]].\n\n== Life==\nFerdinand was born in Coimbra, the second but eldest surviving son of [[Peter I of Portugal|Peter I]] and his wife, Constanza Manuel.<ref name=Adam>[https://books.google.com/books?id=NdgCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA560 ''Spain and Portugal'', Graeme Mercer Adam ed., J. D. Morris, 1906]</ref> On the death of [[Peter of Castile]] in 1369, Ferdinand, as great-grandson of [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho IV]] by his grandmother [[Beatrice of Castile (1293\u20131359)|Beatrice]], laid claim to the vacant Castilian throne. The kings of [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], and later [[John of Gaunt|John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster]], who had married Peter of Castile's eldest daughter, Constance, also claimed the throne.\n\nThe throne was held by his second cousin [[Henry II of Castile|Henry of Trast\u00e1mara]] (Henry II of Castile), Peter of Castile's illegitimate brother, who had defeated him in the [[Castilian Civil War]] in 1366 and assumed the crown. After one or two indecisive campaigns, all parties were ready to accept the mediation of [[Pope Gregory XI]]. The conditions of the treaty, ratified in 1371, included a marriage between Ferdinand and [[Eleanor of Castile, Queen of Navarre|Leonora of Castile]]. But before the union could take place Ferdinand had become passionately attached to [[Leonor Telles de Meneses]], the wife of one of his own courtiers. Having procured a dissolution of her previous marriage, he lost no time in making Leonor his queen.<ref name=Adam/>\n[[File:Chapelle Ardente of the King of Portugal, with hatchments - Chronique d' Angleterre (Volume III) (late 15th C), f.217v - BL Royal MS 14 E IV.png|thumb|left|''The Funeral of D. Fernando'' from the ''Chronique d' Angleterre''; Jean de Wavrin, late 14th century.]]\nThis conduct, although it raised a serious insurrection in Portugal, did not at once result in a war with Henry.  However, the outward concord was soon disturbed by intrigues with [[John of Gaunt]], Duke of Lancaster, brother of [[Edward the Black Prince]], who entered into a secret treaty with Ferdinand for the expulsion of Henry from his throne. The war which followed was unsuccessful; and peace was again made in 1373.\n\nOn the death of Henry in 1379, the Duke of Lancaster once more put forward his claims, and again found an ally in Portugal. According to the Continental annalists, the English proved as offensive to their allies as to their enemies in the field. So Ferdinand made a peace for himself at [[Badajoz]] in 1382. It stipulated that [[Beatrice of Portugal|Beatrice]], Ferdinand's daughter and heiress, would marry King [[John I of Castile]], and thus secure the ultimate union of the two crowns.\n\nFerdinand left no male heir when he died, probably from poisoning, at  Lisbon on  22 October 1383, and the direct [[Portuguese House of Burgundy|Burgundian]] line, which had been in possession of the throne since the days of [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Count Henry]] (about 1112), became extinct. The stipulations of the treaty of Badajoz were set aside, and [[John I of Portugal|John]], Grand Master of the [[order of Aviz]], Ferdinand's illegitimate brother, claimed the throne. This led to a period of war and political indefinition known as the [[1383-1385 Crisis]].  John became the first king of the [[House of Aviz]] in 1385.\n\nFerdinand's spectacular ornate tomb can be found on display at the [[Carmo Convent (Lisbon)|Carmo Archaeological Museum]] in Lisbon.

In the 19th century, the age of [[colonialism]] was at its height and the great [[Chinese diaspora]] began. Many colonies lacked a large pool of laborers.  Meanwhile, in the provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] in China, there was a surge in emigration as a result of the poverty and ruin caused by the [[Taiping rebellion]].<ref>The Story of California From the Earliest Days to the Present, by Henry K.

Many Hokkien chose to work in Southeast Asia (where they had earlier links starting from the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] era), as did the Cantonese. The area of Taishan, in Guangdong province was the source for many of the economic migrants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} San Francisco and California was an early American destination in the mid 1800s because of the California Gold Rush. Many settled in San Francisco forming one of the earliest (or earliest?;reference?) Chinatowns. For the countries in North America and Australasia, great numbers of laborers were also needed in the dangerous tasks of [[gold mining]] and [[railway]] construction.  Widespread famine in Guangdong impelled many Cantonese to work in these countries to improve the living conditions of their relatives. Some overseas Chinese were sold{{By whom|date=July 2010}} to [[South America]] during the [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]] (1855\u20131867) in the [[Pearl River Delta]] in Guangdong.

Moreover, the [[average height]] of [[Southern Chinese]] used to be relatively stable at around 161\u2013164&nbsp;cm for males. Another important fact is that the height of Chinese emigrants varied depending on the location they have chosen.

Many of these emigrants who entered Western countries were themselves overseas Chinese, particularly from the 1950s to the 1980s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of [[Hong Kong]] to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom (mainly England), Australia, Canada, US, South America, Europe and other parts of the world.  The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] further accelerated the migration.  The wave calmed after Hong Kong's transfer of [[sovereignty]] in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.  In fact, after the Tiananmen Square incident, the lines for immigration visas increased at every consulate in Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|reason=the preceding paragraph is entirely devoid of references|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations.

Since the 1860s, most Chinese immigrants of the contemporary [[Chinese Filipino]]s have come from Fujian and thus form the bulk of the contemporary mixed and unmixed Chinese Filipinos and Filipinos of partial Chinese ancestry. Older generations have retained Chinese traditions and the use of [[Philippine Hokkien]] ([[Southern Min|Min Nan]]), while the current majority of younger generations largely communicate in [[Philippine English|English]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and other [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]] and have largely layered facets of both Western and Filipino culture onto their Chinese cultural background.\n\n[[File:East Coast Road 3, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|right|Since their early migration, many of the overseas Chinese have adopted local culture, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand with large [[Peranakan]] community.

There are also great similarities between Vietnamese and Chinese traditions such as the use Lunar New Year, philosophy such as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and ancestor worship; leads to some [[Hoa people|Hoa]] people adopt easily to Vietnamese culture, however many Hoa still prefer to maintain Chinese cultural background. The official census from 2009 accounted the Hoa population at some 823,000 individuals and ranked 6th in terms of its population size. 70% of the Hoa live in cities and towns, mostly in Ho Chi Minh city while the rests live in the southern provinces.<ref name=\"GSO2009\" />\n\nOn the other hand, in Malaysia, Singapore, and [[Brunei]], the ethnic Chinese have maintained a distinct communal identity.\n\nIn [[East Timor]], a large fraction of Chinese are of [[Hakka people#East Timor|Hakka descent]].\n\nIn Western countries, the overseas Chinese generally use romanised versions of their Chinese names, and the use of local first names is also common.\n\n===Discrimination===\n{{See also|Sinophobia}}\n\nOverseas Chinese have often experienced hostility and [[discrimination]].\n\nIn countries with small ethnic Chinese minorities, the [[economic disparity]] can be remarkable. For example, in 1998, ethnic Chinese made up just 1% of the population of the [[Philippines]] and 4% of the population in [[Indonesia]], but have wide influence in the Philippine and Indonesian private economies.<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, pp. 3, 43.</ref> The book ''[[World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability|World on Fire]]'', describing the Chinese as a \"market-[[dominant minority]]\", notes that \"Chinese market dominance and intense resentment amongst the indigenous majority is characteristic of virtually every country in Southeast Asia except Thailand and Singapore\".<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, p. 61.</ref> Chinese market dominance is present in Thailand and the Philippines, but is noted for its lack of resentment, while Singapore is majority ethnic Chinese. Widespread violent anti-Chinese sentiment spread across Southeast Asia, mostly occur in Malaysia and Indonesia, but not very much in Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines.\n\nThis asymmetrical economic position has incited anti-Chinese sentiment among the poorer majorities. Sometimes the anti-Chinese attitudes turn violent, such as the [[13 May Incident]] in Malaysia in 1969 and the [[Jakarta riots of May 1998]] in Indonesia, in which more than 2,000 people died, mostly rioters burned to death in a shopping mall.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4323219 Malaysia's race rules].

In Malaysia, ethnic Chinese tend to support equal and meritocratic treatment on the expectation that they would not be discriminated against in the resulting competition for government contracts, university places, etc., whereas many \"[[Bumiputra]]\" (\"native sons\") [[Malaysian Malay|Malays]] oppose this on the grounds that their group needs such protections in order to retain their patrimony. The question of to what extent ethnic Malays, Chinese, or others are \"native\" to Malaysia is a sensitive political one.

In the 19th century, the age of [[colonialism]] was at its height and the great [[Chinese diaspora]] began. Many colonies lacked a large pool of laborers.  Meanwhile, in the provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] in China, there was a surge in emigration as a result of the poverty and ruin caused by the [[Taiping rebellion]].<ref>The Story of California From the Earliest Days to the Present, by Henry K.

Many Hokkien chose to work in Southeast Asia (where they had earlier links starting from the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] era), as did the Cantonese. The area of Taishan, in Guangdong province was the source for many of the economic migrants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} San Francisco and California was an early American destination in the mid 1800s because of the California Gold Rush. Many settled in San Francisco forming one of the earliest (or earliest?;reference?) Chinatowns. For the countries in North America and Australasia, great numbers of laborers were also needed in the dangerous tasks of [[gold mining]] and [[railway]] construction.  Widespread famine in Guangdong impelled many Cantonese to work in these countries to improve the living conditions of their relatives. Some overseas Chinese were sold{{By whom|date=July 2010}} to [[South America]] during the [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]] (1855\u20131867) in the [[Pearl River Delta]] in Guangdong.

Moreover, the [[average height]] of [[Southern Chinese]] used to be relatively stable at around 161\u2013164&nbsp;cm for males. Another important fact is that the height of Chinese emigrants varied depending on the location they have chosen.

Many of these emigrants who entered Western countries were themselves overseas Chinese, particularly from the 1950s to the 1980s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of [[Hong Kong]] to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom (mainly England), Australia, Canada, US, South America, Europe and other parts of the world.  The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] further accelerated the migration.  The wave calmed after Hong Kong's transfer of [[sovereignty]] in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.  In fact, after the Tiananmen Square incident, the lines for immigration visas increased at every consulate in Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|reason=the preceding paragraph is entirely devoid of references|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations.

Since the 1860s, most Chinese immigrants of the contemporary [[Chinese Filipino]]s have come from Fujian and thus form the bulk of the contemporary mixed and unmixed Chinese Filipinos and Filipinos of partial Chinese ancestry.

There are also great similarities between Vietnamese and Chinese traditions such as the use Lunar New Year, philosophy such as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and ancestor worship; leads to some [[Hoa people|Hoa]] people adopt easily to Vietnamese culture, however many Hoa still prefer to maintain Chinese cultural background. The official census from 2009 accounted the Hoa population at some 823,000 individuals and ranked 6th in terms of its population size. 70% of the Hoa live in cities and towns, mostly in Ho Chi Minh city while the rests live in the southern provinces.<ref name=\"GSO2009\" />\n\nOn the other hand, in Malaysia, Singapore, and [[Brunei]], the ethnic Chinese have maintained a distinct communal identity.\n\nIn [[East Timor]], a large fraction of Chinese are of [[Hakka people#East Timor|Hakka descent]].\n\nIn Western countries, the overseas Chinese generally use romanised versions of their Chinese names, and the use of local first names is also common.\n\n===Discrimination===\n{{See also|Sinophobia}}\n\nOverseas Chinese have often experienced hostility and [[discrimination]].\n\nIn countries with small ethnic Chinese minorities, the [[economic disparity]] can be remarkable. For example, in 1998, ethnic Chinese made up just 1% of the population of the [[Philippines]] and 4% of the population in [[Indonesia]], but have wide influence in the Philippine and Indonesian private economies.<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, pp. 3, 43.</ref> The book ''[[World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability|World on Fire]]'', describing the Chinese as a \"market-[[dominant minority]]\", notes that \"Chinese market dominance and intense resentment amongst the indigenous majority is characteristic of virtually every country in Southeast Asia except Thailand and Singapore\".<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, p. 61.</ref> Chinese market dominance is present in Thailand and the Philippines, but is noted for its lack of resentment, while Singapore is majority ethnic Chinese. Widespread violent anti-Chinese sentiment spread across Southeast Asia, mostly occur in Malaysia and Indonesia, but not very much in Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines.\n\nThis asymmetrical economic position has incited anti-Chinese sentiment among the poorer majorities. Sometimes the anti-Chinese attitudes turn violent, such as the [[13 May Incident]] in Malaysia in 1969 and the [[Jakarta riots of May 1998]] in Indonesia, in which more than 2,000 people died, mostly rioters burned to death in a shopping mall.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4323219 Malaysia's race rules].

In Malaysia, ethnic Chinese tend to support equal and meritocratic treatment on the expectation that they would not be discriminated against in the resulting competition for government contracts, university places, etc., whereas many \"[[Bumiputra]]\" (\"native sons\") [[Malaysian Malay|Malays]] oppose this on the grounds that their group needs such protections in order to retain their patrimony. The question of to what extent ethnic Malays, Chinese, or others are \"native\" to Malaysia is a sensitive political one.
