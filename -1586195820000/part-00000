He died six years later at the age of 46 after an unsuccessful heart transplant operation.\n\n==Background==\n\nCozzalio was born August 19, 1946, in [[Ashland, Oregon]], and raised on his family's ranch on the [[Klamath River]] on the [[California]]/[[Oregon]] border. He attended the local schools in Ashland, [[Hornbrook, California]], and high school in [[Yreka, California|Yreka]] and [[Sacramento, California]].{{r|vhpa}} He graduated from [[Mira Loma High School]] in 1964.{{r|sb1}} He worked as a cook and assistant manager at an [[International House of Pancakes]] in Sacramento before being drafted into the [[United States Army]] in February 1966.{{r|vhpa}}\n\nHe trained for armored duty before graduating from [[Officers Candidate School|Armor Officers Candidate School]] in April 1967 and was commissioned a [[Second Lieutenant]] of Armor.  He then received helicopter pilot training from March to October 1967 at the [[Army Aviation School]].{{r|vhpa}}\n\n==Vietnam==\n\nCozzalio arrived in [[Vietnam]] in December 1967 and was assigned to a standalone helicopter cavalry reconnaissance unit attached to the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th Infantry Division]]. The unit wore yellow scarves and white [[Stetson]]s, evoking the uniform of prior-era horse cavalry units. Cozzalio wore a complete 1860s cavalry uniform on special occasions.{{r|vva}}\n\nCozzalio spent eighteen months in Vietnam and was shot down a total of six times. Several times, he returned in a helicopter so badly damaged it was never flown again.{{r|vva}}\n\nThis time included two required six-month tours, during which he received 49 medals including a [[Silver Star]], three [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]es, the [[Soldier's Medal]] and two [[Purple Heart]]s, one for a bullet wound to the neck and another for a broken jaw suffered after crashing when shot-down which required a seven-week hospital stay before he returned to duty. He logged over 1,000 hours of combat flying in the area around [[Saigon]]. The biggest engagement in which he participated was the [[May Offensive]] in Saigon's [[Cholon, Ho Chi Minh City|Cholon sector]] May 5\u201311, 1968.{{r|sb1}}\n\nAfter his twelve months active duty in Vietnam, he took a 30-day leave at his home in Oregon before a voluntary return for an additional six-month extended tour.{{r|sb1}}\n\n==Postwar==\nAfter service in Vietnam, he returned to the US for several years before deploying as a Special Services Officer to [[Thailand]] in 1972. He attended [[Sul Ross University]] in Texas in 1974\u20131975, before duty as a recruitment officer in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] in 1975\u20131977.

As part of Education 2010, a new building was opened in October 2006 to replace the previous one, which had been in use for almost 70 years.\n\nThe current head teacher is Martin Anderson. He is supported by a senior management team composed of: Allison Dewar, MaryJane Hunter, Graeme Nolan and Claire O'Neill\n\n== History ==\nFounded in 1849, Airdrie Academy exists today in its third incarnation.  The Academy moved to its current site on South Commonhead Avenue in 1941.   When it was built in the midst of [[World War II]], the new building cost a little over \u00a3100,000 at the time.  It was first located on Cairnhill Road in a building that housed Alexandra Primary School. The original building has since been demolished to make way for housing.\n[[File:Airdrie Academy - geograph.org.uk - 222492.jpg|thumb|right|Former building]]\n\n===Grammar school===\nFrom its inception, Airdrie Academy was the senior secondary school in Airdrie: pupils who did not pass an exam on leaving primary school would go to the now defunct Airdrie High.\n\n===Comprehensive===\nThis system changed in the late 1960s when it became a full six-year comprehensive, nearly tripling the school roll to 1800.  To cope with the increase the South Commonhead Avenue site's existing 'A-Block' was expanded into a larger campus with specific buildings for Science and Technology and a fourth 'House Block' with six dining halls and three floors of modern classrooms.\n\nThough enhanced and expanded over the years, the building fell into disrepair with students having to be taught in [[portable buildings]] during the early 2000s whilst [[asbestos]] was removed from the Science Block.  After 60 years of service, the building was reaching the end of its serviceable life and North Lanarkshire Council began exploring alternatives.\n\nIn December 1988 there was a [[meningitis]] outbreak, resulting in the death of a 40-year-old teacher.\n\n===New building===\n[[File:Airdrie Academy from the air (geograph 5625958).jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the modern campus, 2017]]\nVigorous lobbying from the school's pupils, teaching staff and the local MSP stopped the school from merging with Caldervale High in a proposed super-campus with over 2000 pupils.  Instead, parents and pupils were invited to select a design for a new Airdrie Academy to be built on the playing fields of its current site. The selected design - similar to most other new schools in the county - was completed in October 2006 and is considerably smaller. The new building cost \u00a326 million.\n\nOver the remaining academic year, the old buildings were demolished and the land prepared for new sports fields.

As part of Education 2010, a new building was opened in October 2006 to replace the previous one, which had been in use for almost 70 years.\n\nThe current head teacher is Martin Anderson. He is supported by a senior management team composed of: Allison Dewar, MaryJane Hunter, Graeme Nolan and Claire O'Neill\n\n== History ==\nFounded in 1849, Airdrie Academy exists today in its third incarnation.  First located on Cairnhill Road in a building that now houses Alexandra Primary School, the Academy moved to its current site on South Commonhead Avenue in 1941.   When it was built in the midst of [[World War II]], the new building cost a little over \u00a3100,000 at the time.\n\n[[File:Airdrie Academy - geograph.org.uk - 222492.jpg|thumb|right|Former building]]\n\n===Grammar school===\nFrom its inception, Airdrie Academy was the senior secondary school in Airdrie: pupils who did not pass an exam on leaving primary school would go to the now defunct Airdrie High.\n\n===Comprehensive===\nThis system changed in the late 1960s when it became a full six-year comprehensive, nearly tripling the school roll to 1800.  To cope with the increase the South Commonhead Avenue site's existing 'A-Block' was expanded into a larger campus with specific buildings for Science and Technology and a fourth 'House Block' with six dining halls and three floors of modern classrooms.\n\nThough enhanced and expanded over the years, the building fell into disrepair with students having to be taught in [[portable buildings]] during the early 2000s whilst [[asbestos]] was removed from the Science Block.  After 60 years of service, the building was reaching the end of its serviceable life and North Lanarkshire Council began exploring alternatives.\n\nIn December 1988 there was a [[meningitis]] outbreak, resulting in the death of a 40-year-old teacher.\n\n===New building===\n[[File:Airdrie Academy from the air (geograph 5625958).jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the modern campus, 2017]]\nVigorous lobbying from the school's pupils, teaching staff and the local MSP stopped the school from merging with Caldervale High in a proposed super-campus with over 2000 pupils.  Instead, parents and pupils were invited to select a design for a new Airdrie Academy to be built on the playing fields of its current site. The selected design - similar to most other new schools in the county - was completed in October 2006 and is considerably smaller. The new building cost \u00a326 million.\n\nOver the remaining academic year, the old buildings were demolished and the land prepared for new sports fields.  During this time one wing of the old A-Block was set on fire by vandals.  Demolition moved on and in January 2007 the 'Dome' part of the old building was pulled down.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtvy64v2604|title=Airdrie Academy Assembly Hall Demolition 1|accessdate=2008-08-28}}.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ9QBxTM6jk|title=Airdrie Academy Assembly Hall Demolition 2|accessdate=2008-08-28}}.</ref>\n\n==Staff==\nIn June 2006 Allan Dougan, Teacher of Mathematics, was awarded Scottish Teacher of the Year runner-up at the Scottish Education Awards.\n\n==Notable former pupils==\n{{See also|Category:People educated at Airdrie Academy}}\n{{Alumni|date=June 2018}}\n* [[William Whigham Fletcher]] [[FRSE]], biologist\n* Charles Hammond, chief executive since 2000 of [[Forth Ports]]\n* [[Alan Morton]], footballer\n* [[Paul Towndrow]], saxophonist\n* [[Amanda Hendrick]], model\n* [[Grant Harrold]], The Royal Butler, Britain's etiquette expert and broadcaster\n* \n\n===Grammar school===\n* Sir [[George G.

Plate motion should not be confused with [[continental drift]] which applies purely to the movement of the crustal components of the continents. The movements of the lithosphere and the underlying mantle are coupled since descending lithosphere is an essential component of convection in the mantle. The observed continental drift is a complicated relationship between the forces causing oceanic lithosphere to sink and the movements within Earth's mantle.\n\nAlthough there is a tendency to larger viscosity at greater depth, this relation is far from linear and shows layers with dramatically decreased viscosity, in particular in the upper mantle and at the boundary with the core.<ref name=\"jena\">Walzer, Uwe; Hendel, Roland and Baumgardner, John.

The deepest penetration was approximately {{convert|180|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

Coordinated by the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]], DSDP provided crucial data to support the [[seafloor spreading]] hypothesis and helped to prove the theory of [[plate tectonics]]. ''[[Glomar Challenger]]'' conducted the drilling operations. DSDP was the first of three international scientific ocean drilling programs that have operated over more than 40 years. Scientific planning was conducted under the auspices of the [[Joint Oceanographic Institutions for Deep Earth Sampling]] (JOIDES), whose advisory group consisted of 250 distinguished scientists from academic institutions, government agencies, and private industry from all over the world.

The volcanism often attributed to deep mantle plumes is alternatively explained by passive extension of the crust, permitting magma to leak to the surface (the \"Plate\" hypothesis).<ref name=Foulger>{{cite book |title=Plates vs. Plumes: A Geological Controversy |author=Foulger, G.R. |url=http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405161485.html |date=2010 |isbn=978-1-4051-6148-0 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell}}</ref>\n\nThe [[convection]] of the Earth's mantle is a [[Chaos theory|chaotic]] process (in the sense of fluid dynamics), which is thought to be an integral part of the motion of plates. Plate motion should not be confused with [[continental drift]] which applies purely to the movement of the crustal components of the continents. The movements of the lithosphere and the underlying mantle are coupled since descending lithosphere is an essential component of convection in the mantle. The observed continental drift is a complicated relationship between the forces causing oceanic lithosphere to sink and the movements within Earth's mantle.\n\nAlthough there is a tendency to larger viscosity at greater depth, this relation is far from linear and shows layers with dramatically decreased viscosity, in particular in the upper mantle and at the boundary with the core.<ref name=\"jena\">Walzer, Uwe; Hendel, Roland and Baumgardner, John.

The mantle is considered to be viscous and incapable of brittle faulting. However, in subduction zones, earthquakes are observed down to {{convert|670|km|abbr=on}}. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including dehydration, thermal runaway, and phase change.\nThe geothermal gradient can be lowered where cool material from the surface sinks downward, increasing the strength of the surrounding mantle, and allowing earthquakes to occur down to a depth of {{convert|400|km|abbr=on}} and {{convert|670|km|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe pressure at the bottom of the mantle is ~136 G[[pascal (unit)|Pa]] (1.4 million [[atmospheric pressure|atm]]).<ref name=\"burns\">\n{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JiTuaX_1TU0C&pg=PA354|title=Mineralogical Applications of Crystal Field Theory|last=Burns|first=Roger George|date=1993|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43077-7|page=354|accessdate=2007-12-26}}\n</ref> Pressure increases as depth increases, since the material beneath has to support the weight of all the material above it. The entire mantle, however, is thought to deform like a fluid on long timescales, with permanent plastic deformation accommodated by the movement of point, line, and/or planar defects through the solid crystals composing the mantle. Estimates for the viscosity of the upper mantle range between 10<sup>19</sup> and 10<sup>24</sup> [[pascal second|Pa\u00b7s]], depending on depth,<ref name=\"jena\" /> temperature, composition, state of stress, and numerous other factors. Thus, the upper mantle can only flow very slowly. However, when large forces are applied to the uppermost mantle it can become weaker, and this effect is thought to be important in allowing the formation of tectonic plate boundaries.\n\n== Exploration ==\nExploration of the mantle is generally conducted at the seabed rather than on land because of the relative thinness of the oceanic crust as compared to the significantly thicker continental crust.\n\nThe first attempt at mantle exploration, known as [[Project Mohole]], was abandoned in 1966 after repeated failures and cost over-runs. The deepest penetration was approximately {{convert|180|m|ft|abbr=on}}. In 2005 an oceanic borehole reached {{convert|1416|m|ft}} below the sea floor from the ocean drilling vessel ''[[JOIDES Resolution]]''.\n\nMore successful was the [[Deep Sea Drilling Project]] (DSDP) that operated from 1968 to 1983. Coordinated by the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]], DSDP provided crucial data to support the [[seafloor spreading]] hypothesis and helped to prove the theory of [[plate tectonics]]. ''[[Glomar Challenger]]'' conducted the drilling operations. DSDP was the first of three international scientific ocean drilling programs that have operated over more than 40 years. Scientific planning was conducted under the auspices of the [[Joint Oceanographic Institutions for Deep Earth Sampling]] (JOIDES), whose advisory group consisted of 250 distinguished scientists from academic institutions, government agencies, and private industry from all over the world. The [[Ocean Drilling Program]] (ODP) continued exploration from 1985 to 2003 when it was replaced by the [[Integrated Ocean Drilling Program]] (IODP).<ref name=\"about\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.deepseadrilling.org/about.htm|title=About DSDP|publisher=Deep Sea Drilling Project}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 March 2007, a team of scientists on board the [[RRS James Cook|RRS ''James Cook'']] embarked on a voyage to an area of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] [[seafloor]] where the mantle lies exposed without any crust covering, midway between the [[Cape Verde Islands]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]].
