In 1958 the military in both the US and Europe allowed its commercial use again as depleted uranium, and its use began again on a more limited scale. Urania-based ceramic glazes are dark green or black when fired in a reduction or when  UO<sub>2</sub> is used; more commonly it is used in oxidation to produce bright yellow, orange and red glazes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.uranglasuren.com/|title=Uran in der Keramik.

[[Uranium glass]]<nowiki/> is pale green to yellow and often has strong fluorescent properties. Urania has also been used in formulations of [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] and [[porcelain]]. It is possible to determine with a [[Geiger counter]] if a glaze or glass produced before 1958 contains urania.\n\n===Other use===\nPrior to the realisation of the harmfulness of radiation, uranium was included in false teeth and dentures, as its slight fluorescence made the dentures appear more like real teeth in a variety of lighting conditions.\n\n[[Depleted uranium|Depleted]] UO<sub>2</sub> (DUO<sub>2</sub>) can be used as a material for [[radiation shielding]]. For example, [[DUCRETE]] is a \"heavy [[concrete]]\" material where [[gravel]] is replaced with uranium dioxide aggregate; this material is investigated for use for [[cask]]s for [[radioactive waste]]. Casks can be also made of DUO<sub>2</sub>-[[steel]] [[cermet]], a [[composite material]] made of an [[aggregate (composite)|aggregate]] of uranium dioxide serving as radiation shielding, [[graphite]] and/or [[silicon carbide]] serving as [[neutron radiation]] absorber and moderator, and steel as the matrix, whose high thermal conductivity allows easy removal of decay heat.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nDepleted uranium dioxide can be also used as a [[catalyst]], e.g. for degradation of [[volatile organic compound]]s in gaseous phase, [[oxidation]] of [[methane]] to [[methanol]], and removal of [[sulfur]] from [[petroleum]]. It has high efficiency and long-term stability when used to destroy VOCs when compared with some of the commercial [[catalyst]]s, such as [[precious metal]]s, [[titanium dioxide|TiO<sub>2</sub>]], and [[cobalt oxide|Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>]] catalysts. Much research is being done in this area, DU being favoured for the uranium component due to its low radioactivity.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/384341a0 |title=Uranium-oxide-based catalysts for the destruction of volatile chloro-organic compounds |journal=Nature |volume=384 |issue=6607 |pages=341\u20133 |year=1996 |last1=Hutchings |first1=Graham J. |last2=Heneghan |first2=Catherine S. |last3=Hudson |first3=Ian D. |last4=Taylor |first4=Stuart H. |bibcode=1996Natur.384..341H }}</ref>\n\nThe use of uranium dioxide as a material for [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]] is being investigated. The batteries could have high [[power density]] and potential of 4.7 V per cell. Another investigated application is in [[photoelectrochemical cell]]s for solar-assisted hydrogen production where UO<sub>2</sub> is used as a [[photoanode]]. In earlier times, uranium dioxide was also used as heat conductor for current limitation (URDOX-resistor), which was the first use of its semiconductor properties.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nUranium dioxide is also the strongest known piezomagnetic in the antiferromagnetic state observed at cryogenic temperatures below 30 [[kelvin]]s. UO<sub>2</sub> displays a linear magnetostriction that changes sign with the sign of the applied magnetic field, and magnetoelastic memory switching at magnetic fields near 180,000 Oe.<ref>M. Jaime et al. (2017), Piezomagnetism and magnetoelastic memory in uranium dioxide. ''Nature Communications'' '''8''', 99.</ref>\n\n===Semiconductor properties===\nThe [[band gap]] of uranium dioxide is comparable to those of [[silicon]] and [[gallium arsenide]], near the optimum for efficiency vs band gap curve for absorption of solar radiation, suggesting its possible use for very efficient [[solar cell]]s based on [[Schottky diode]] structure; it also absorbs at five different wavelengths, including infrared, further enhancing its efficiency. Its intrinsic conductivity at room temperature is about the same as of [[single crystal]] silicon.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.207402 |pmid=21668262 |title=Ultrafast Hopping Dynamics of 5''f'' Electrons in the Mott Insulator UO<sub>2</sub> Studied by Femtosecond Pump-Probe Spectroscopy |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=106 |issue=20 |pages=207402 |year=2011 |last1=An |first1=Yong Q. |last2=Taylor |first2=Antoinette J. |last3=Conradson |first3=Steven D. |last4=Trugman |first4=Stuart A. |last5=Durakiewicz |first5=Tomasz |last6=Rodriguez |first6=George |bibcode=2011PhRvL.106t7402A }}</ref>\n\nThe [[dielectric constant]] of uranium dioxide is about 22, which is almost twice as high as of silicon (11.2) and GaAs (14.1). This is an advantage over Si and GaAs in the construction of [[integrated circuit]]s, as it may allow higher density integration with higher [[breakdown voltage]]s and with lower susceptibility to the [[CMOS]] [[quantum tunnelling|tunnelling]] breakdown.\n\nThe [[Seebeck coefficient]] of uranium dioxide at room temperature is about 750 \u00b5V/K, a value significantly higher than the 270 \u00b5V/K of [[thallium tin telluride]] (Tl<sub>2</sub>SnTe<sub>5</sub>) and [[thallium germanium telluride]] (Tl<sub>2</sub>GeTe<sub>5</sub>) and of [[bismuth]]-[[tellurium]] alloys, other materials promising for [[thermoelectric generator|thermoelectric power generation]] applications and [[Peltier element]]s.\n\nThe [[radioactive decay]] impact of the <sup>235</sup>U and <sup>238</sup>U on its semiconducting properties was not measured {{as of|2005|lc=on}}. Due to the slow decay rate of these isotopes, it should not meaningfully influence the properties of uranium dioxide solar cells and thermoelectric devices, but it may become an important factor for [[very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] chips. Use of [[depleted uranium]] oxide is necessary for this reason. The capture of alpha particles emitted during radioactive decay as helium atoms in the crystal lattice may also cause gradual long-term changes in its properties.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe [[stoichiometry]] of the material dramatically influences its electrical properties. For example, the electrical conductivity of UO<sub>1.994</sub> is orders of magnitude lower at higher temperatures than the conductivity of UO<sub>2.001</sub>.\n\nUranium dioxide, like U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, is a [[ceramic]] material capable of withstanding high temperatures (about 2300&nbsp;\u00b0C, in comparison with at most 200&nbsp;\u00b0C for silicon or GaAs), making it suitable for high-temperature applications like thermophotovoltaic devices.\n\nUranium dioxide is also resistant to [[radiation]] damage, making it useful for [[radiation hardening|rad-hard]] devices for special military and [[aerospace]] applications.\n\nA [[Schottky diode]] of [[yellowcake|U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>]] and a [[p-n-p transistor]] of UO<sub>2</sub> were successfully manufactured in a laboratory.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.vacuum.2008.04.005 |title=Semiconductor devices fabricated from actinide oxides |journal=Vacuum |volume=83 |issue=1 |pages=226\u20138 |year=2008 |last1=Meek |first1=Thomas T. |last2=von Roedern |first2=B. |bibcode=2008Vacuu..83..226M }}</ref>\n\n==Toxicity==\nUranium dioxide is known to be absorbed by [[phagocytosis]] in the lungs.<ref>Principles of Biochemical Toxicology.

In 1958 the military in both the US and Europe allowed its commercial use again as depleted uranium, and its use began again on a more limited scale. Urania-based ceramic glazes are dark green or black when fired in a reduction or when  UO<sub>2</sub> is used; more commonly it is used in oxidation to produce bright yellow, orange and red glazes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.uranglasuren.com/|title=Uran in der Keramik.

[[Uranium glass]]<nowiki/> is pale green to yellow and often has strong fluorescent properties. Urania has also been used in formulations of [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] and [[porcelain]]. It is possible to determine with a [[Geiger counter]] if a glaze or glass produced before 1958 contains urania.\n\n===Other use===\nPrior to the realisation of the harmfulness of radiation, uranium was included in false teeth and dentures, as its slight fluorescence made the dentures appear more like real teeth in a variety of lighting conditions.\n\n[[Depleted uranium|Depleted]] UO<sub>2</sub> (DUO<sub>2</sub>) can be used as a material for [[radiation shielding]]. For example, [[DUCRETE]] is a \"heavy [[concrete]]\" material where [[gravel]] is replaced with uranium dioxide aggregate; this material is investigated for use for [[cask]]s for [[radioactive waste]]. Casks can be also made of DUO<sub>2</sub>-[[steel]] [[cermet]], a [[composite material]] made of an [[aggregate (composite)|aggregate]] of uranium dioxide serving as radiation shielding, [[graphite]] and/or [[silicon carbide]] serving as [[neutron radiation]] absorber and moderator, and steel as the matrix, whose high thermal conductivity allows easy removal of decay heat.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nDepleted uranium dioxide can be also used as a [[catalyst]], e.g. for degradation of [[volatile organic compound]]s in gaseous phase, [[oxidation]] of [[methane]] to [[methanol]], and removal of [[sulfur]] from [[petroleum]]. It has high efficiency and long-term stability when used to destroy VOCs when compared with some of the commercial [[catalyst]]s, such as [[precious metal]]s, [[titanium dioxide|TiO<sub>2</sub>]], and [[cobalt oxide|Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>]] catalysts. Much research is being done in this area, DU being favoured for the uranium component due to its low radioactivity.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/384341a0 |title=Uranium-oxide-based catalysts for the destruction of volatile chloro-organic compounds |journal=Nature |volume=384 |issue=6607 |pages=341\u20133 |year=1996 |last1=Hutchings |first1=Graham J. |last2=Heneghan |first2=Catherine S. |last3=Hudson |first3=Ian D. |last4=Taylor |first4=Stuart H. |bibcode=1996Natur.384..341H }}</ref>\n\nThe use of uranium dioxide as a material for [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]] is being investigated. The batteries could have high [[power density]] and potential of 4.7 V per cell. Another investigated application is in [[photoelectrochemical cell]]s for solar-assisted hydrogen production where UO<sub>2</sub> is used as a [[photoanode]]. In earlier times, uranium dioxide was also used as heat conductor for current limitation (URDOX-resistor), which was the first use of its semiconductor properties.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nUranium dioxide is also the strongest known piezomagnetic in the antiferromagnetic state observed at cryogenic temperatures below 30 [[kelvin]]s. UO<sub>2</sub> displays a linear magnetostriction that changes sign with the sign of the applied magnetic field, and magnetoelastic memory switching at magnetic fields near 180,000 Oe.<ref>M.

''Nature Communications'' '''8''', 99.</ref>\n\n===Semiconductor properties===\nThe [[band gap]] of uranium dioxide is comparable to those of [[silicon]] and [[gallium arsenide]], near the optimum for efficiency vs band gap curve for absorption of solar radiation, suggesting its possible use for very efficient [[solar cell]]s based on [[Schottky diode]] structure; it also absorbs at five different wavelengths, including infrared, further enhancing its efficiency. Its intrinsic conductivity at room temperature is about the same as of [[single crystal]] silicon.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.207402 |pmid=21668262 |title=Ultrafast Hopping Dynamics of 5''f'' Electrons in the Mott Insulator UO<sub>2</sub> Studied by Femtosecond Pump-Probe Spectroscopy |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=106 |issue=20 |pages=207402 |year=2011 |last1=An |first1=Yong Q. |last2=Taylor |first2=Antoinette J. |last3=Conradson |first3=Steven D. |last4=Trugman |first4=Stuart A. |last5=Durakiewicz |first5=Tomasz |last6=Rodriguez |first6=George |bibcode=2011PhRvL.106t7402A }}</ref>\n\nThe [[dielectric constant]] of uranium dioxide is about 22, which is almost twice as high as of silicon (11.2) and GaAs (14.1). This is an advantage over Si and GaAs in the construction of [[integrated circuit]]s, as it may allow higher density integration with higher [[breakdown voltage]]s and with lower susceptibility to the [[CMOS]] [[quantum tunnelling|tunnelling]] breakdown.\n\nThe [[Seebeck coefficient]] of uranium dioxide at room temperature is about 750 \u00b5V/K, a value significantly higher than the 270 \u00b5V/K of [[thallium tin telluride]] (Tl<sub>2</sub>SnTe<sub>5</sub>) and [[thallium germanium telluride]] (Tl<sub>2</sub>GeTe<sub>5</sub>) and of [[bismuth]]-[[tellurium]] alloys, other materials promising for [[thermoelectric generator|thermoelectric power generation]] applications and [[Peltier element]]s.\n\nThe [[radioactive decay]] impact of the <sup>235</sup>U and <sup>238</sup>U on its semiconducting properties was not measured {{as of|2005|lc=on}}. Due to the slow decay rate of these isotopes, it should not meaningfully influence the properties of uranium dioxide solar cells and thermoelectric devices, but it may become an important factor for [[very-large-scale integration|VLSI]] chips. Use of [[depleted uranium]] oxide is necessary for this reason. The capture of alpha particles emitted during radioactive decay as helium atoms in the crystal lattice may also cause gradual long-term changes in its properties.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe [[stoichiometry]] of the material dramatically influences its electrical properties. For example, the electrical conductivity of UO<sub>1.994</sub> is orders of magnitude lower at higher temperatures than the conductivity of UO<sub>2.001</sub>.\n\nUranium dioxide, like U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>, is a [[ceramic]] material capable of withstanding high temperatures (about 2300&nbsp;\u00b0C, in comparison with at most 200&nbsp;\u00b0C for silicon or GaAs), making it suitable for high-temperature applications like thermophotovoltaic devices.\n\nUranium dioxide is also resistant to [[radiation]] damage, making it useful for [[radiation hardening|rad-hard]] devices for special military and [[aerospace]] applications.\n\nA [[Schottky diode]] of [[yellowcake|U<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>]] and a [[p-n-p transistor]] of UO<sub>2</sub> were successfully manufactured in a laboratory.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.vacuum.2008.04.005 |title=Semiconductor devices fabricated from actinide oxides |journal=Vacuum |volume=83 |issue=1 |pages=226\u20138 |year=2008 |last1=Meek |first1=Thomas T. |last2=von Roedern |first2=B. |bibcode=2008Vacuu..83..226M }}</ref>\n\n==Toxicity==\nUranium dioxide is known to be absorbed by [[phagocytosis]] in the lungs.<ref>Principles of Biochemical Toxicology.

All other tasks must cede precedence to the task of rearmament\u201d and \u201cin case of conflict between the demands of the Wehrmacht and demands for other purposes, the interests of the Wehrmacht must in every case have priority.\u201d{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=38}} This policy was implemented immediately, with military expenditures quickly growing far larger than the civilian work-creation programs. As early as June 1933, military spending for the year was budgeted to be three times larger than the spending on all civilian work-creation measures in 1932 and 1933 combined.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=55}} Nazi Germany increased its military spending faster than any other state in peacetime, with the share of military spending rising from 1 percent to 10 percent of national income in the first two years of the regime alone.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=66}} Eventually, it reached as high as 75 percent by 1944.<ref name=\"Evans, Richard J. 2008 p. 333\"/>\n\nThe first financial package for rearmament was adopted by the Nazi government in June 1933, and it was extremely ambitious. Schacht approved a figure of 35 billion Reichsmarks to be spent on military buildup over eight years.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=53}} By comparison, the entire national income of Germany in 1933 was 43 billion Reichsmarks, so the government was not merely proposing to increase military spending, but to make military production the primary focus of the national economy.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=54}} Earlier in April, the cabinet had already agreed to release the military from the normal processes of budgetary oversight.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=54}} Germany\u2019s international treaty obligations would not allow such extensive rearmament, so Hitler withdrew from the Geneva disarmament talks and from the [[League of Nations]] in October 1933.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=56}} The German government feared that this might provoke immediate war with France at the time, but it did not. Still, the fear that war might come before Germany was prepared for it served to create a sense of urgency and reinforced the rearmament program.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=56}} The army and the navy prepared to quickly expand their capacity and manpower. Plans were made to secretly build an air force (forbidden by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]), and the army prepared to introduce conscription within two years and grow to 300,000 soldiers by 1937 (also in violation of the Treaty of Versailles).{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=57}} At first, the navy did not benefit much from these rearmament plans, because Hitler wished to fight a land war in Europe and even hoped to make an alliance with the British Empire whereby the British would retain control of the seas. However, at the insistence of Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], an expansion of the navy was also approved in 1934. This included the projected construction of 8 battleships (Versailles allowed a maximum of 6), 3 aircraft carriers, 8 cruisers (Versailles permitted 6), 48 destroyers (Versailles permitted 12), and 72 submarines (completely banned by the treaty).{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=58-59}} The unprecedented size of the military budget was impossible to hide from foreign observers. When Hitler was asked for an explanation, he claimed that Germany was \"engaged only in essential maintenance and renewal expenditure.\"{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=59}}\n\nThe enormous military buildup was financed to a large extent through deficit spending, including Mefo bills. Between 1933 and 1939 the total revenue of the German government amounted to 62 billion Reichsmarks, whereas government expenditure (up to 60% of which consisted of rearmament costs) exceeded 101 billion, thus causing a huge deficit and rising national debt (reaching 38 billion marks in 1939).<ref name=\"bare_url\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110901034600/http://varldenshistoria.se/files/bonnier-his/pdf/SHIS_0731.pdf VarldensHistoria.se: \"Frihet, j\u00e4mlikhet och NAZISM\"] (PDF).</ref><ref>H .P.

The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=131}} As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with [[IG Farben]] in 1933, guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at [[Leuna]]. Any profits in excess of that amount would be turned over to the Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=106, 117\u2013118}}\n\nIn June 1933, the \"Reinhardt Program\" for infrastructure development was introduced. It combined indirect incentives, such as tax reductions, with direct public investment in waterways, railroads and highways.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=83}} It was followed by similar initiatives resulting in great expansion of the German construction industry. Between 1933 and 1936, employment in construction rose from only 666,000 to over 2,000,000.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=84}} Cars and other forms of motorized transport became increasingly attractive to the population, and the German motor industry boomed.{{sfn|Braun|1990|pp=83\u201384}} However, Germany's attempt to achieve [[autarky]] meant imposing restrictions on foreign currency, which caused a shortage of rubber and fuel for civilian use by 1939 and resulted in \u201cdrastic restrictions on the use of motor vehicles\u201d.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=364}}\n\n===Privatization and business ties===\nThe Great Depression had spurred increased state ownership in most Western capitalist countries.

At the same time, world prices for manufactured goods (Germany's chief exports) were falling. The result was that Germany found it increasingly difficult to maintain a balance of payments. A large trade deficit seemed almost inevitable. But Hitler found this prospect unacceptable. Germany began to move away from partially free trade in the direction of economic self-sufficiency.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=86}} Hitler was aware of the fact that Germany lacked reserves of raw materials, and full [[autarky]] was therefore impossible. Thus he chose a different approach. The Nazi government tried to limit the number of its trade partners, and, when possible, only trade with countries within the German sphere of influence. A number of bilateral trade agreements were signed between Germany and other European Countries (mostly countries located in Southern and South-Eastern Europe) during the 1930s. The German government strongly encouraged trade with these countries but strongly discouraged trade with any others.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=101}}{{clarify |date=July 2016 |reason= Through what mechanism did the Nazi government succeed in intervening trade?}}\n\nBy the late 1930s, the aims of German trade policy were to use economic and political power to make the countries of Southern Europe and the Balkans dependent on Germany. The German economy would draw its raw materials from that region, and the countries in question would receive German manufactured goods in exchange.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=102}}  Germany would also leverage productive trade relationships with Spain, Switzerland and Sweden in areas ranging from iron ore imports and clearing and payment services.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Golson |first1=Eric |title=The Economics of Neutrality |url=http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/178/1/Golson_The_Economics_of_Neutrality.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>  Throughout the 1930s, German businesses were also encouraged to form cartels, monopolies and oligopolies, whose interests were then protected by the state.{{sfn|Schweitzer|1964|p=265}}\n\n===Preparations for war===\n{{main|Adolf Hitler#Rearmament and new alliances}}\nIn 1936, after years of limitations imposed by the [[Versailles Treaty]], military spending in Germany rose to 10% of [[Gross national product|GNP]], higher than any other European country at the time, and, from 1936 onwards, even higher than civilian investments.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=85}} Hitler faced a choice between conflicting recommendations. On one side a \"free market\" technocratic faction within the government, centered around ''Reichsbank'' President [[Hjalmar Schacht]], Minister of Economics [[Walther Funk]] and Price Commissioner Dr. [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]] calling for decreased military spending, free trade, and a moderation in state intervention in the economy. This faction was supported by some of Germany's leading business executives, most notably Hermann Duecher of [[AEG]], [[Robert Bosch]] of [[Robert Bosch GmbH]], and Albert Voegeler of [[Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG|Vereinigte Stahlwerke]].{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=217}} On the other side the more politicized faction favored [[autarky|autarkic]] policies and sustained military spending.{{sfn|Carr|1972|p=49-52}} Hitler hesitated before siding with the latter, which was much in line with his fundamental ideological tenets: social darwinism and ''Lebensraum'''s aggressive policies. So in August 1936, Hitler issued his \"Memorandum\" requesting from [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] a series of Year's Plans (the term \"Four-Year Plan\" was coined only later, in September) in order to mobilize the entire economy, within the next four years, and make it ready for war: maximizing autarchic policies, even at a cost for the German people, and having the armed forces fully operational and ready at the end of the four years period.<ref>[[Richard Overy|R.

No state will be able to withdraw or even remain at a distance from this historical conflict...It is not the aim of this memorandum to prophesy the time when the untenable situation in Europe will become an open crisis. I only want, in these lines, to set down my conviction that this crisis cannot and will not fail to arrive and that it is Germany's duty to secure her own existence by every means in face of this catastrophe, and to protect herself against it, and that from this compulsion there arises a series of conclusions relating to the most important tasks that our people have ever been set. For a victory of Bolshevism over Germany would not lead to a Versailles treaty, but to the final destruction, indeed the annihilation of the German people...I consider it necessary for the ''Reichstag'' to pass the following two laws: 1) A law providing the death penalty for economic sabotage and 2) A law making the whole of Jewry liable for all damage inflicted by individual specimens of this community of criminals upon the German economy, and thus upon the German people.{{sfn|Dawidowicz|1976|p=32}} }} Hitler called for Germany to have the world's \"first army\" in terms of fighting power within the next four years and that \"the extent of the military development of our resources ''cannot be too large, nor its pace too swift''\" [italics in the original] and the role of the economy was simply to support \"Germany's self-assertion and the extension of her ''Lebensraum''\".<ref>[[Manfred Messerschmidt|Messerschmidt, Manfred]] \"Foreign Policy and Preparation for War\" from ''[[Germany and the Second World War]]'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990 pages 623\u2013624</ref><ref>[[Richard Overy|R. J. Overy]], \"Misjudging Hitler\" from ''The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered'' edited by Gordon Martel Routledge: London, United Kingdom, 1999 page 103</ref> Hitler went on to write that given the magnitude of the coming struggle that the concerns expressed by members of the \"free market\" faction like Schacht and Goerdeler that the current level of military spending was bankrupting Germany were irrelevant. Hitler wrote that: \"However well balanced the general pattern of a nation's life ought to be, there must at particular times be certain disturbances of the balance at the expense of other less vital tasks. If we do not succeed in bringing the German army as rapidly as possible to the rank of premier army in the world...then Germany will be lost!\"{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=220}} and \"The nation does not live for the economy, for economic leaders, or for economic or financial theories; on the contrary, it is finance and the economy, economic leaders and theories, which all owe unqualified service in this struggle for the self-assertion of our nation\".{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=220}}\n\nGermany had already been rapidly rearming and militarizing before 1936. However, it was in his memorandum of 1936 that Hitler made it clear he expected war to be imminent. He argued that the German economy \u201cmust be fit for war within four years.\u201d{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=357}} [[Autarky]] was to be pursued more aggressively, and the German people would have to begin making sacrifices in their consumption habits in order to enable food supplies and raw materials to be diverted towards military uses.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=357}} Speaking to a meeting of his main economic advisers in 1937, Hitler insisted that Germany\u2019s population had grown to the point where the nation would soon become unable to feed itself, so war for the conquest of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' in Eastern Europe was necessary as soon as possible. Therefore, if the rearmament drive caused economic problems, the response would have to entail pushing even harder in order to be ready for war faster, rather than scaling back military spending.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=359-360}} Seeing that Hitler had taken this stance, Schacht resigned as Minister of Economics in November 1937, and the management of the economy effectively passed to Hermann G\u00f6ring.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=360}}\n\nIn July 1937, the [[Reichswerke Hermann G\u00f6ring]] was established as a new industrial [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] to extract and process domestic [[iron ore]]s from [[Salzgitter]], as the first step in a general effort to increase German steel production in preparation for war.{{sfn|Overy|1994|pp=98}} Later, during the war, the ''Reichswerke'' would expand by incorporating much of the heavy industry of occupied nations, including between 50 and 60 per cent of Czech heavy industries and slightly less in Austria.{{sfn|Overy|1994|pp=155}} By the end of 1941, the ''Reichswerke'' had become the largest company in Europe, after absorbing most of the industry captured by Germany from the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Overy|1994|pp=158-159}}\n\n===Assessments of historical knowledge===\nA major historiographical debate about the relationship between the German prewar economy and foreign policy decision-making was prompted in the late 1980s, when historian [[Timothy Mason]] claimed that an economic crisis had caused a \"flight into war\" in 1939. Mason argued that the German working-class was opposed to the Nazi dictatorship in the over-heated German economy of the late 1930s.<ref name=\"Perry pages 780-781\">Perry, Matt \"Mason, Timothy\" pages 780-781 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'' edited by Kelly Boyd, Volume 2, London: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishing, 1999 page 780</ref> However, Mason\u2019s thesis was opposed by historian [[Richard Overy]] who wrote that Germany's economic problems could not explain aggression against [[Poland]] and that the reasons for the outbreak of war were due to the [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|ideological choices]] made by the Nazi leadership. For Overy, the problem with Mason's thesis was that it rested on the assumptions not shown by records.<ref>Mason, Tim & Overy, R.J. \"Debate: Germany, `domestic crisis\u2019 and the war in 1939\" from ''The Origins of The Second World War'' edited by Patrick Finney, Edward Arnold: London, United Kingdom, 1997, p.102.</ref> Overy argued that there was a difference between economic pressures induced by the problems of the [[Four Year Plan]], and economic motives to seize foreign industry, materials and reserves of neighboring states.<ref>[[Richard Overy|R. J. Overy]], \"Germany, \u2018Domestic Crisis\u2019 and War in 1939\" from ''The Third Reich'' edited by Christian Leitz Blackwell: Oxford, 1999 pp.117-118.</ref> Meanwhile, [[Adam Tooze]] argued that from 1939 onwards, in spite of the military successes in the West, the German economy became dependent on vital imports from the East.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=420}} Tooze saw this as a reason for Hitler to attack the Soviet Union, because \"[t]he Third Reich had no intention of slipping into that kind of humbling dependence that Britain now occupied in relation to the United States, mortgaging its assets and selling its secrets, simply to sustain its war effort\".{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=422}} Up to [[Operation Barbarossa]] the German economy could not \"do without Soviet deliveries of oil, grain, and alloy metals.\"<ref>Ericson, Edward E.

Petroleum, sugar, coffee, chocolate and cotton were all extremely scarce. Germany used [[coal gasification]] to replace petroleum imports to a limited extent, and relied on Romanian oilfields at [[Ploiesti]]. Germany was dependent on Sweden for the majority of their iron ore production, and relied on Spain and Portugal to provide tungsten. Switzerland continued to trade with Germany, and was very useful as a neutral country friendly to Germany. Until the declaration of war on the Soviet Union, the Third Reich [[German\u2013Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|received]] large supplies of grain and raw materials from the [[USSR]], which they paid for with industrial machinery, weapons, and even German designs for a battleship. In the spring of 1940, the Soviet Union asked for two chemical plants as compensation for raw materials. The German government declined, at the insistence of the military.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=422}}\n\n[[Rationing]] was introduced for German consumers in 1939. However, while Britain immediately put their economy on a war footing as soon as the conflict began, Germany resisted equivalent measures until later in the war. For instance, the Nazis were reluctant to increase taxes on individual German citizens to pay for the war, so the top [[personal income tax]] rate in 1941 was 13.7% in Germany, as opposed to 23.7% in Great Britain.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=114}} The German government instead funded much of its military effort through plunder, especially plundering the wealth of Jewish citizens and the like, both at home and in the conquered territories.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/8119805/Confiscated-Jewish-wealth-helped-fund-the-German-war-effort.html|title=Confiscated Jewish wealth 'helped fund the German war effort'|first=Allan|last=Hall|date=November 9, 2010|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Use of conquered territories===\nDuring the war, as Germany acquired new territories (either by direct annexation or by installing puppet governments in defeated countries), these new territories were forced to sell raw materials and agricultural products to German buyers at extremely low prices. Hitler's policy of [[lebensraum]] strongly emphasized the conquest of new lands in the East, and the exploitation of these lands to provide cheap goods to Germany. In practice, however, the intensity of the fighting on the Eastern Front and the Soviet [[scorched earth]] policy meant that the Germans found little they could use, and, on the other hand, a large quantity of goods flowed into Germany from conquered lands in the West. For example, two-thirds of all French trains in 1941 were used to carry goods to Germany. Norway lost 20% of its national income in 1940 and 40% in 1943.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=121}}\n\n[[Fiscal policy]] was also directed towards exploitation of conquered countries, from which [[Financial capital|capital]] was to be gathered for German investments. German-run banks, such as [[Bank Emisyjny w Polsce]], were created to manage local economies.<ref name=gojski>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbp.pl/publikacje/bank_i_kredyt/2004_08/gojski.pdf |title=Etapy i cele niemieckiej polityki bankowej w GG.

Agricultural supply chains collapsed, partly due to wartime destruction and partly due to the British blockade that prevented the import of fertilizer and other raw materials from outside of Europe.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=418-419}} The grain harvest in France in 1940 was less than half what it had been in 1938. Grain yields also fell (compared to their pre-war levels) in Germany itself, as well as in Hungary and the occupied Netherlands and Yugoslavia. German grain imports from Yugoslavia and Hungary fell by almost 3 million tons, and this could only be partially offset by increased deliveries from Romania.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=419}} Coal and oil were also in short supply, again because Germany could not access sources outside of Europe. Germany's oil supplies, crucial for the war effort, depended largely on annual imports of 1.5 million tons of oil, mainly from Romania.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=411}} Although Germany seized the oil supplies of conquered states \u2013 for example reducing France to a mere 8 percent of its pre-war oil consumption \u2013 this was still not enough for the needs of the war.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=411}} Acute fuel shortages forced the German military to cut back on training for its drivers and pilots, because training would be a waste of fuel.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=412}} The Soviets and the Americans had accurate reports of Germany\u2019s oil supplies, but refused to believe that the Nazi government would take the risk of starting a war with so little fuel security, so they assumed that Germany must have had vast amounts of well-hidden supplies that they were not able to detect.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=412}} Germany also had a problem with coal, although in this case the issue was not a lack of quantity, but an inability to extract it and transport it where it was needed fast enough. Railways had been badly damaged by the war, and coal miners in occupied territories drastically reduced their productivity compared to pre-war levels. This was, in part, intentional sabotage on the part of the miners, who wished to harm the German war effort. But it was also in part due to lack of adequate nutrition for those miners, as food from their countries was redirected to Germany.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=413-415}}\n\nIn 1942, after the death of Armaments Minister [[Fritz Todt]], Hitler appointed [[Albert Speer]] as his replacement. Historians have long contended that the growing burdens of the war saw Germany move to a full [[war economy]] under the efficient<ref>for a critical assessment of Speer's performance see, however, Tooze 2006, 552ff.</ref> leadership of Speer. However historian Richard Overy contends this is a myth based on the flimsy conclusions of the [[Strategic Bombing Survey]], which relied on the views of one German official from the German Statistical Office, Ralf Wagenfuhr. Wagenfuhr was not senior enough to be aware of decision making at higher levels. Overy shows that the military and Nazi leadership were particular about preparing the economy for total war as they felt that World War I was lost on the Home Front.<ref>[[Richard Overy|Overy, Richard]] (1994) ''War and Economy in the Third Reich''.

Civilian factories were converted to military use and placed under military administration. From mid 1943 on, Germany switched to a full war economy overseen by [[Albert Speer]]. By late 1944, almost the entire German economy was dedicated to military production. The result was a dramatic rise in military production, with an increase by 2 to 3 times of vital goods like tanks and aircraft, despite the intensifying Allied air campaign and the loss of territory and factories. Restaurants and other services were closed to focus the German economy on military needs. With the exception of ammunition for the army, the increase in production was insufficient to match the Allies in any category of production. Some production was moved underground in an attempt to put it out of reach of Allied bombers.\n\nFrom late 1944 on, Allied bombings were destroying German factories and cities at a rapid pace, leading to the final collapse of the German war economy in 1945 ([[Stunde Null]]). Food became drastically scarce. Synthetic fuel production dropped by 86% in eight months, explosive output was reduced by 42% and the loss of tank output was 35%.<ref>Webster and Frankland,''The Strategic Air Offensive against Germany 1939-1945, Volume IV'' page 516</ref> The Allied bombing campaign also tied up valuable manpower, with [[Albert Speer]] (Germany's Minister of Armaments) estimating that in the summer of 1944 between 200,000 and 300,000 men were permanently employed in repairing oil installations and placing oil production underground.<ref>[[Richard Overy|R.

Shirer, ''The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany'', New York, NY, Simon & Schuster, 2011, p. 260</ref> When the notes were presented for payment, the Reichsbank printed money. This proved inadequate in 1938, when a large share of Mefo\u2019s five-year promissory notes fell due, so the government employed \u201chighly dubious methods\u201d where \u201cbanks were forced to buy government bonds, and the government took money from savings accounts and insurance companies\u201d in order to pay the holders of Mefo bills, due mainly to a serious government cash shortage.<ref>[[Martin Kitchen]], ''A History of Modern Germany 1800-2000, Maden, MA, Blackwell Publishing'', 2006, p. 284</ref> Meanwhile, Schacht's administration achieved a rapid decline in the unemployment rate, the largest of any country during the Great Depression.{{sfn|DeLong|1997}} By 1938 unemployment was practically extinct.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lee |first=Stephen |title=Weimar and Nazi Germany |year=1996 |publisher = Heinemann |location= Oxford |isbn=043530920X |page=85}}</ref>\n\nThe main economic priority of the Nazi government, which set it apart from previous German governments, was to rearm and rebuild Germany\u2019s military in preparation for an eventual war to conquer ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\u201cliving space\u201d) in the East.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=38}} Thus, at the beginning of his rule, Hitler said that \u201cthe future of Germany depends exclusively and only on the reconstruction of the [[Wehrmacht]]. All other tasks must cede precedence to the task of rearmament\u201d and \u201cin case of conflict between the demands of the Wehrmacht and demands for other purposes, the interests of the Wehrmacht must in every case have priority.\u201d{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=38}} This policy was implemented immediately, with military expenditures quickly growing far larger than the civilian work-creation programs. As early as June 1933, military spending for the year was budgeted to be three times larger than the spending on all civilian work-creation measures in 1932 and 1933 combined.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=55}} Nazi Germany increased its military spending faster than any other state in peacetime, with the share of military spending rising from 1 percent to 10 percent of national income in the first two years of the regime alone.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=66}} Eventually, by 1944, it reached as high as 75 percent.<ref name=\"Evans, Richard J. 2008 p. 333\"/>\n\nThe first financial package for rearmament was adopted by the Nazi government in June 1933, and it was extremely ambitious. Schacht approved a figure of 35 billion Reichsmarks to be spent on military buildup over eight years.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=53}} By comparison, the entire national income of Germany in 1933 was 43 billion Reichsmarks, so the government was not merely proposing to increase military spending, but to make military production the primary focus of the national economy.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=54}} Earlier, in April, the cabinet had already agreed to release the military from the normal processes of budgetary oversight.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=54}} Germany\u2019s international treaty obligations would not allow such extensive rearmament, so Hitler withdrew from the Geneva disarmament talks and from the [[League of Nations]] in October 1933.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=56}} The German government feared that this might provoke immediate war with France at the time, but it did not. Still, the fear that war might come before Germany was prepared for it served to create a sense of urgency and reinforced the rearmament program.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=56}} The army and the navy prepared to quickly expand their capacity and manpower. Plans were made to secretly build an air force (forbidden by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]), and the army prepared to introduce conscription within two years and grow to 300,000 soldiers by 1937 (also in violation of the Treaty of Versailles).{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=57}} At first, the navy did not benefit much from these rearmament plans, because Hitler wished to fight a land war in Europe and even hoped to make an alliance with the British Empire whereby the British would retain control of the seas. However, at the insistence of Admiral [[Erich Raeder]], an expansion of the navy was also approved in 1934. This included the projected construction of 8 battleships (Versailles allowed a maximum of 6), 3 aircraft carriers, 8 cruisers (Versailles permitted 6), 48 destroyers (Versailles permitted 12), and 72 submarines (completely banned by the treaty).{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=58-59}} The unprecedented size of the military budget was impossible to hide from foreign observers, but when Hitler was asked for an explanation, he claimed that Germany was \u201cengaged only in essential maintenance and renewal expenditure.\u201d{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=59}}\n\nThe enormous military buildup was financed to a large extent through deficit spending, including Mefo bills. Between 1933 and 1939 the total revenue of the German government amounted to 62 billion Reichsmarks, whereas government expenditure (up to 60% of which consisted of rearmament costs) exceeded 101 billion, thus causing a huge deficit and rising national debt (reaching 38 billion marks in 1939).<ref name=\"bare_url\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20110901034600/http://varldenshistoria.se/files/bonnier-his/pdf/SHIS_0731.pdf VarldensHistoria.se: \"Frihet, j\u00e4mlikhet och NAZISM\"] (PDF).</ref><ref>H .P.

The Nazis encouraged the development of synthetic replacements for materials such as oil and textiles.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=131}} As the market was experiencing a glut and prices for petroleum were low, in 1933 the Nazi government made a profit-sharing agreement with [[IG Farben]], guaranteeing them a 5 percent return on capital invested in their synthetic oil plant at [[Leuna]]. Any profits in excess of that amount would be turned over to the Reich. By 1936, Farben regretted making the deal, as the excess profits by then being generated had to be given to the government.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=106, 117\u2013118}}\n\nIn June 1933, the \"Reinhardt Program\" for infrastructure development was introduced.

At the same time, world prices for manufactured goods (Germany's chief exports) were falling. The result was that Germany found it increasingly difficult to maintain a balance of payments. A large trade deficit seemed almost inevitable. But Hitler found this prospect unacceptable. Germany began to move away from partially free trade in the direction of economic self-sufficiency.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=86}} Hitler was aware of the fact that Germany lacked reserves of raw materials, and full [[autarky]] was therefore impossible. Thus he chose a different approach. The Nazi government tried to limit the number of its trade partners, and, when possible, only trade with countries within the German sphere of influence. A number of bilateral trade agreements were signed between Germany and other European Countries (mostly countries located in Southern and South-Eastern Europe) during the 1930s. The German government strongly encouraged trade with these countries but strongly discouraged trade with any others.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=101}}{{clarify |date=July 2016 |reason= Through what mechanism did the Nazi government succeed in intervening trade?}}\n\nBy the late 1930s, the aims of German trade policy were to use economic and political power to make the countries of Southern Europe and the Balkans dependent on Germany. The German economy would draw its raw materials from that region, and the countries in question would receive German manufactured goods in exchange.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=102}}  Germany would also leverage productive trade relationships with Spain, Switzerland and Sweden in areas ranging from iron ore imports and clearing and payment services.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Golson |first1=Eric |title=The Economics of Neutrality |url=http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/178/1/Golson_The_Economics_of_Neutrality.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>  Throughout the 1930s, German businesses were also encouraged to form cartels, monopolies and oligopolies, whose interests were then protected by the state.{{sfn|Schweitzer|1964|p=265}}\n\n===Preparations for war===\n{{main|Adolf Hitler#Rearmament and new alliances}}\nIn 1936, after years of limitations imposed by the [[Versailles Treaty]], military spending in Germany rose to 10% of [[Gross national product|GNP]], higher than any other European country at the time, and, from 1936 onwards, even higher than civilian investments.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=85}} Hitler faced a choice between conflicting recommendations. On one side a \"free market\" technocratic faction within the government, centered around ''Reichsbank'' President [[Hjalmar Schacht]], Minister of Economics [[Walther Funk]] and Price Commissioner Dr. [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]] calling for decreased military spending, free trade, and a moderation in state intervention in the economy. This faction was supported by some of Germany's leading business executives, most notably Hermann Duecher of [[AEG]], [[Robert Bosch]] of [[Robert Bosch GmbH]], and Albert Voegeler of [[Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG|Vereinigte Stahlwerke]].{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=217}} On the other side the more politicized faction favored [[autarky|autarkic]] policies and sustained military spending.{{sfn|Carr|1972|p=49-52}} Hitler hesitated before siding with the latter, which was much in line with his fundamental ideological tenets: social darwinism and ''Lebensraum'''s aggressive policies. So in August 1936, Hitler issued his \"Memorandum\" requesting from [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] a series of Year's Plans (the term \"Four-Year Plan\" was coined only later, in September) in order to mobilize the entire economy, within the next four years, and make it ready for war: maximizing autarchic policies, even at a cost for the German people, and having the armed forces fully operational and ready at the end of the four years period.<ref>[[Richard Overy|R.

No state will be able to withdraw or even remain at a distance from this historical conflict...It is not the aim of this memorandum to prophesy the time when the untenable situation in Europe will become an open crisis. I only want, in these lines, to set down my conviction that this crisis cannot and will not fail to arrive and that it is Germany's duty to secure her own existence by every means in face of this catastrophe, and to protect herself against it, and that from this compulsion there arises a series of conclusions relating to the most important tasks that our people have ever been set. For a victory of Bolshevism over Germany would not lead to a Versailles treaty, but to the final destruction, indeed the annihilation of the German people...I consider it necessary for the ''Reichstag'' to pass the following two laws: 1) A law providing the death penalty for economic sabotage and 2) A law making the whole of Jewry liable for all damage inflicted by individual specimens of this community of criminals upon the German economy, and thus upon the German people.{{sfn|Dawidowicz|1976|p=32}} }} Hitler called for Germany to have the world's \"first army\" in terms of fighting power within the next four years and that \"the extent of the military development of our resources ''cannot be too large, nor its pace too swift''\" [italics in the original] and the role of the economy was simply to support \"Germany's self-assertion and the extension of her ''Lebensraum''\".<ref>[[Manfred Messerschmidt|Messerschmidt, Manfred]] \"Foreign Policy and Preparation for War\" from ''[[Germany and the Second World War]]'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1990 pages 623\u2013624</ref><ref>[[Richard Overy|R.

Hitler wrote that: \"However well balanced the general pattern of a nation's life ought to be, there must at particular times be certain disturbances of the balance at the expense of other less vital tasks. If we do not succeed in bringing the German army as rapidly as possible to the rank of premier army in the world...then Germany will be lost!\"{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=220}} and \"The nation does not live for the economy, for economic leaders, or for economic or financial theories; on the contrary, it is finance and the economy, economic leaders and theories, which all owe unqualified service in this struggle for the self-assertion of our nation\".{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=220}}\n\nGermany had already been rapidly rearming and militarizing before 1936. However, it was in his memorandum of 1936 that Hitler made it clear he expected war to be imminent. He argued that the German economy \u201cmust be fit for war within four years.\u201d{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=357}} [[Autarky]] was to be pursued more aggressively, and the German people would have to begin making sacrifices in their consumption habits in order to enable food supplies and raw materials to be diverted towards military uses.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=357}} Speaking to a meeting of his main economic advisers in 1937, Hitler insisted that Germany\u2019s population had grown to the point where the nation would soon become unable to feed itself, so war for the conquest of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' in Eastern Europe was necessary as soon as possible. Therefore, if the rearmament drive caused economic problems, the response would have to entail pushing even harder in order to be ready for war faster, rather than scaling back military spending.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=359-360}} Seeing that Hitler had taken this stance, Schacht resigned as Minister of Economics in November 1937, and the management of the economy effectively passed to Hermann G\u00f6ring.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=360}}\n\nIn July 1937, the [[Reichswerke Hermann G\u00f6ring]] was established as a new industrial [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] to extract and process domestic [[iron ore]]s from [[Salzgitter]], as the first step in a general effort to increase German steel production in preparation for war.{{sfn|Overy|1994|pp=98}} Later, during the war, the ''Reichswerke'' would expand by incorporating much of the heavy industry of occupied nations, including between 50 and 60 per cent of Czech heavy industries and slightly less in Austria.{{sfn|Overy|1994|pp=155}} By the end of 1941, the ''Reichswerke'' had become the largest company in Europe, after absorbing most of the industry captured by Germany from the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Overy|1994|pp=158-159}}\n\n===Assessments of historical knowledge===\nA major historiographical debate about the relationship between the German prewar economy and foreign policy decision-making was prompted in the late 1980s, when historian [[Timothy Mason]] claimed that an economic crisis had caused a \"flight into war\" in 1939. Mason argued that the German working-class was opposed to the Nazi dictatorship in the over-heated German economy of the late 1930s.<ref name=\"Perry pages 780-781\">Perry, Matt \"Mason, Timothy\" pages 780-781 from ''The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing'' edited by Kelly Boyd, Volume 2, London: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishing, 1999 page 780</ref> However, Mason\u2019s thesis was opposed by historian [[Richard Overy]] who wrote that Germany's economic problems could not explain aggression against [[Poland]] and that the reasons for the outbreak of war were due to the [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|ideological choices]] made by the Nazi leadership. For Overy, the problem with Mason's thesis was that it rested on the assumptions not shown by records.<ref>Mason, Tim & Overy, R.J. \"Debate: Germany, `domestic crisis\u2019 and the war in 1939\" from ''The Origins of The Second World War'' edited by Patrick Finney, Edward Arnold: London, United Kingdom, 1997, p.102.</ref> Overy argued that there was a difference between economic pressures induced by the problems of the [[Four Year Plan]], and economic motives to seize foreign industry, materials and reserves of neighboring states.<ref>[[Richard Overy|R. J. Overy]], \"Germany, \u2018Domestic Crisis\u2019 and War in 1939\" from ''The Third Reich'' edited by Christian Leitz Blackwell: Oxford, 1999 pp.117-118.</ref> Meanwhile, [[Adam Tooze]] argued that from 1939 onwards, in spite of the military successes in the West, the German economy became dependent on vital imports from the East.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=420}} Tooze saw this as a reason for Hitler to attack the Soviet Union, because \"[t]he Third Reich had no intention of slipping into that kind of humbling dependence that Britain now occupied in relation to the United States, mortgaging its assets and selling its secrets, simply to sustain its war effort\".{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=422}} Up to [[Operation Barbarossa]] the German economy could not \"do without Soviet deliveries of oil, grain, and alloy metals.\"<ref>Ericson, Edward E.

Petroleum, sugar, coffee, chocolate and cotton were all extremely scarce. Germany used [[coal gasification]] to replace petroleum imports to a limited extent, and relied on Romanian oilfields at [[Ploiesti]]. Germany was dependent on Sweden for the majority of their iron ore production, and relied on Spain and Portugal to provide tungsten. Switzerland continued to trade with Germany, and was very useful as a neutral country friendly to Germany. Until the declaration of war on the Soviet Union, the Third Reich [[German\u2013Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|received]] large supplies of grain and raw materials from the [[USSR]], which they paid for with industrial machinery, weapons, and even German designs for a battleship. In the spring of 1940, the Soviet Union asked for two chemical plants as compensation for raw materials. The German government declined, at the insistence of the military.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|p=422}}\n\n[[Rationing]] was introduced for German consumers in 1939. However, while Britain immediately put their economy on a war footing as soon as the conflict began, Germany resisted equivalent measures until later in the war. For instance, the Nazis were reluctant to increase taxes on individual German citizens to pay for the war, so the top [[personal income tax]] rate in 1941 was 13.7% in Germany, as opposed to 23.7% in Great Britain.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=114}} The German government instead funded much of its military effort through plunder, especially plundering the wealth of Jewish citizens and the like, both at home and in the conquered territories.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/8119805/Confiscated-Jewish-wealth-helped-fund-the-German-war-effort.html|title=Confiscated Jewish wealth 'helped fund the German war effort'|first=Allan|last=Hall|date=November 9, 2010|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Use of conquered territories===\nDuring the war, as Germany acquired new territories (either by direct annexation or by installing puppet governments in defeated countries), these new territories were forced to sell raw materials and agricultural products to German buyers at extremely low prices. Hitler's policy of [[lebensraum]] strongly emphasized the conquest of new lands in the East, and the exploitation of these lands to provide cheap goods to Germany. In practice, however, the intensity of the fighting on the Eastern Front and the Soviet [[scorched earth]] policy meant that the Germans found little they could use, and, on the other hand, a large quantity of goods flowed into Germany from conquered lands in the West. For example, two-thirds of all French trains in 1941 were used to carry goods to Germany. Norway lost 20% of its national income in 1940 and 40% in 1943.{{sfn|Braun|1990|p=121}}\n\n[[Fiscal policy]] was also directed towards exploitation of conquered countries, from which [[Financial capital|capital]] was to be gathered for German investments. German-run banks, such as [[Bank Emisyjny w Polsce]], were created to manage local economies.<ref name=gojski>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbp.pl/publikacje/bank_i_kredyt/2004_08/gojski.pdf |title=Etapy i cele niemieckiej polityki bankowej w GG.

Agricultural supply chains collapsed, partly due to wartime destruction and partly due to the British blockade that prevented the import of fertilizer and other raw materials from outside of Europe.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=418-419}} The grain harvest in France in 1940 was less than half what it had been in 1938. Grain yields also fell (compared to their pre-war levels) in Germany itself, as well as in Hungary and the occupied Netherlands and Yugoslavia. German grain imports from Yugoslavia and Hungary fell by almost 3 million tons, and this could only be partially offset by increased deliveries from Romania.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=419}} Coal and oil were also in short supply, again because Germany could not access sources outside of Europe. Germany's oil supplies, crucial for the war effort, depended largely on annual imports of 1.5 million tons of oil, mainly from Romania.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=411}} Although Germany seized the oil supplies of conquered states \u2013 for example reducing France to a mere 8 percent of its pre-war oil consumption \u2013 this was still not enough for the needs of the war.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=411}} Acute fuel shortages forced the German military to cut back on training for its drivers and pilots, because training would be a waste of fuel.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=412}} The Soviets and the Americans had accurate reports of Germany\u2019s oil supplies, but refused to believe that the Nazi government would take the risk of starting a war with so little fuel security, so they assumed that Germany must have had vast amounts of well-hidden supplies that they were not able to detect.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=412}} Germany also had a problem with coal, although in this case the issue was not a lack of quantity, but an inability to extract it and transport it where it was needed fast enough. Railways had been badly damaged by the war, and coal miners in occupied territories drastically reduced their productivity compared to pre-war levels. This was, in part, intentional sabotage on the part of the miners, who wished to harm the German war effort. But it was also in part due to lack of adequate nutrition for those miners, as food from their countries was redirected to Germany.{{sfn|Tooze|2006|pp=413-415}}\n\nIn 1942, after the death of Armaments Minister [[Fritz Todt]], Hitler appointed [[Albert Speer]] as his replacement. Historians have long contended that the growing burdens of the war saw Germany move to a full [[war economy]] under the efficient<ref>for a critical assessment of Speer's performance see, however, Tooze 2006, 552ff.</ref> leadership of Speer. However historian Richard Overy contends this is a myth based on the flimsy conclusions of the [[Strategic Bombing Survey]], which relied on the views of one German official from the German Statistical Office, Ralf Wagenfuhr. Wagenfuhr was not senior enough to be aware of decision making at higher levels. Overy shows that the military and Nazi leadership were particular about preparing the economy for total war as they felt that World War I was lost on the Home Front.<ref>[[Richard Overy|Overy, Richard]] (1994) ''War and Economy in the Third Reich''. Oxford: Clarendon Press. pp.28-30ff. {{isbn|9780198202905}}</ref> \n\n===Forced labor===\n{{main|Forced labour under German rule during World War II|Ostarbeiter}}\n\nEven before the war, Nazi Germany maintained a supply of [[slave labor]]. \"Undesirables\" ({{lang-de|unzuverl\u00e4ssige Elemente}}), such as the homeless, homosexuals, and alleged criminals as well as political [[dissident]]s, [[communism|communists]], [[Jew]]s, and anyone else that the regime wanted out of the way were imprisoned in [[labor camps]]. [[Prisoner of war|Prisoners of war]] and civilians were brought into Germany from occupied territories after the German [[invasion of Poland]]. The necessary labor for the German war economy was provided by the new camp system, serving as one of the key instruments of terror.

Civilian factories were converted to military use and placed under military administration. From mid 1943 on, Germany switched to a full war economy overseen by [[Albert Speer]]. By late 1944, almost the entire German economy was dedicated to military production. The result was a dramatic rise in military production, with an increase by 2 to 3 times of vital goods like tanks and aircraft, despite the intensifying Allied air campaign and the loss of territory and factories. Restaurants and other services were closed to focus the German economy on military needs. With the exception of ammunition for the army, the increase in production was insufficient to match the Allies in any category of production. Some production was moved underground in an attempt to put it out of reach of Allied bombers.\n\nFrom late 1944 on, Allied bombings were destroying German factories and cities at a rapid pace, leading to the final collapse of the German war economy in 1945 ([[Stunde Null]]). Food became drastically scarce. Synthetic fuel production dropped by 86% in eight months, explosive output was reduced by 42% and the loss of tank output was 35%.<ref>Webster and Frankland,''The Strategic Air Offensive against Germany 1939-1945, Volume IV'' page 516</ref> The Allied bombing campaign also tied up valuable manpower, with [[Albert Speer]] (Germany's Minister of Armaments) estimating that in the summer of 1944 between 200,000 and 300,000 men were permanently employed in repairing oil installations and placing oil production underground.<ref>[[Richard Overy|R.

In 1944 gliders of the requisitioned Lakes Gliding Club were moved from [[RAF Walney Island|RAF Walney]] and formed No.188 Gliding School, [[Air Training Corps]].\n\nDuring its operational life RAF Cark played host to detachments from several squadrons on anti aircraft co-operational duties.\n[[File:Miles M.25 Martinet TT MkI in flight.jpg|thumb|Miles M.25 Martinet TT MkI in flight]]\n\n==Units==\nDuring the course of the operation of the station, the following units were at sometime based at RAF Cark:<ref name=\"CR\"/>\n\n03/41 to 11/42, Staff Pilot Training Unit.\n\n01/42 to 10/42, [[No. 1 Anti Aircraft Co-operation Unit]] ('R'.Flt).\n\n01/42 to 11/42, [[No. 1 Anti Aircraft Co-operation Unit]] ('F'.Flt).\n\n03/42 to 03/43, [[No. 6 Anti Aircraft Co-operation Unit]]\n\n11/42 to 12/43, [[No. 1614 Flt (Anti Aircraft Co-operation) RAF|No. 1614 Flt (Anti Aircraft Co-operation)]].\n\n11/42 to  --/--, 289 Sqn (detachment) with [[Hawker Hurricane]]s.\n\n03/43 to 12/45, Staff Pilot Training Unit.\n\n03/43 to 11/44, 650 Sqn (detachment) with [[Miles Martinet]]s.\n\n04/44 to 05/44, 290 Sqn (detachment) with [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s\n\n11/44 to  --/--, 650 Sqn  (detachment) with [[Hawker Hurricane]]s.\n\n10/45 to 12/45, Pilot Navigation Instructors School\n\n--/44 to 05/47, No. 188 Gliding School, [[Air Training Corps]].\n\n==Closure==\nFollowing the cessation of hostilities in 1945 operations at RAF Cark were run down with the Station being placed on care and maintenance.<ref>http://www.controltowers.co.uk/C/Cark.htm</ref> The last residents to leave were No. 188 Gliding School who transferred to [[RAF Walney Island|RAF Walney]] in May 1947 following which the Station closed.<ref name=\"forgottenairfields.com\"/><ref name=\"CT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.controltowers.co.uk/C/Cark.htm |title=RAF Cark |publisher=Control Towers|accessdate=16 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Subsequent use==\nRAF Cark was sold off by the [[Air Ministry]] and was subsequently used as a venue for [[gliding]].

Apple [[fruit tree|trees]] are [[agriculture|cultivated]] worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the [[genus]] ''[[Malus]]''. The tree originated in [[Central Asia]], where its wild ancestor, ''[[Malus sieversii]]'', is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] and were brought to North America by [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]]. Apples have religious and [[mythology|mythological]] significance in many cultures, including [[Norse mythology|Norse]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Christianity in Europe|European Christian]] tradition.\n\nApple trees are large if grown from seed.  Generally, apple [[cultivar]]s are propagated by [[grafting]] onto [[rootstock]]s, which control the size of the resulting tree. There are more than 7,500 known [[List of apple cultivars|cultivars of apples]], resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and use, including [[cooking apple|cooking]], eating raw and [[apple cider|cider]] production. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of [[fungus|fungal]], bacterial and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of [[organic farming|organic]] and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's [[genome]] was [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.\n\nWorldwide production of apples in 2017 was 83.1&nbsp;million [[tonnes]], with China accounting for half of the total.<ref name=faostat/>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe word \"apple\", formerly spelled ''\u00e6ppel'' in [[Old English]], is derived from the [[Proto-Germanic]] root *ap(a)laz, which could also mean [[fruit]] in general. This is ultimately derived from [[Proto-Indo-European]] *ab(e)l-, but the precise original meaning and the relationship between both words is uncertain.\n\nAs late as the 17th century, the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit other than [[berries]] but including [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s\u2014such as the 14th century [[Middle English]] word ''appel of paradis'', meaning a [[banana]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Origin and meaning of \"apple\" by Online Etymology Dictionary |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/apple |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=22 November 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> This use is analogous to the [[French language]] use of ''pomme''.\n\n==Description==\n\n[[File:Koeh-108.jpg|thumb|right|Blossoms, fruits, and leaves of the apple tree (''Malus domestica'')]]\n[[File:Pink lady and cross section.jpg|thumb|right|An apple's side, stem end, and interior]]\nThe apple is a [[deciduous]] tree, generally standing {{convert|6|to|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall in cultivation and up to {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} in the wild.<!--<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.treenames.net/ti/malus/index_apple_tree.html |title=Types and names of Apple Trees, Species of the Malus Genus |publisher=Treenames.net |accessdate=25 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915015547/http://www.treenames.net/ti/malus/index_apple_tree.html |archive-date=15 September 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>--> When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by [[rootstock]] selection and trimming method.

The {{convert|3|to|4|cm|abbr=on|sp=us}} flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five [[petal]]ed, with an [[inflorescence]] consisting of a [[cyme (botany)|cyme]] with 4\u20136 flowers.

Commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is {{convert|2+3/4|to|3+1/4|in|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter, due to market preference. Some consumers, especially those in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples below {{convert|2+1/4|in|cm|abbr=on}} are generally used for making juice and have little fresh market value. The skin of ripe apples is generally red, yellow, green, pink, or [[russetted]], though many bi- or tri-colored cultivars may be found.<ref name=Janick>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/pri/chapter.pdf |page=9 |chapter=Chapter 1: Apples |author1=Jules Janick |author2=James N.

English scholar [[H. R. Ellis Davidson]] links apples to religious practices in [[Germanic paganism]], from which [[Norse paganism]] developed. She points out that buckets of apples were found in the [[Oseberg ship]] burial site in Norway, that fruit and nuts (I\u00f0unn having been described as being transformed into a nut in ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'') have been found in the early graves of the [[Germanic peoples]] in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of [[fertility]] in southwest England.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nDavidson notes a connection between apples and the [[Vanir]], a tribe of gods associated with [[fertility]] in Norse mythology, citing an instance of eleven \"golden apples\" being given to woo the beautiful [[Ger\u00f0r]] by [[Sk\u00edrnir]], who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god [[Freyr]] in stanzas 19 and 20 of ''[[Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l]]''. Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of the ''[[V\u00f6lsunga saga]]'' when the major goddess [[Frigg]] sends King [[Rerir]] an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg's messenger (in the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a [[tumulus|mound]].<ref name=\"DAVIDSON165-166\"/> Rerir's wife's consumption of the apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the [[Caesarean section]] birth of their son\u2014the hero [[V\u00f6lsung]].<ref name=\"DAVIDSONROLES146-147\"/>\n\nFurther, Davidson points out the \"strange\" phrase \"Apples of [[Hel (location)|Hel]]\" used in an 11th-century poem by the [[skald]] Thorbiorn Br\u00fanarson. She states this may imply that the apple was thought of by Br\u00fanarson as the food of the dead. Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess [[Nehalennia]] is sometimes depicted with apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the apple in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the [[Roman Empire]] and came to Europe from the [[Near East]], the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter. Davidson concludes that in the figure of I\u00f0unn \"we must have a dim reflection of an old symbol: that of the guardian goddess of the life-giving fruit of the other world.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n===Greek mythology===\n[[File:Hercules Musei Capitolini MC1265 n2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.6|[[Heracles]] with the apple of [[Hesperides]]]]\nApples appear in many [[World religions|religious traditions]], often as a mystical or [[forbidden fruit]].

Many commercial orchards pursue a program of chemical sprays to maintain high fruit quality, tree health, and high yields. These prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, though some older pesticides are allowed. [[organic farming|Organic]] methods include, for instance, introducing its natural predator to reduce the population of a particular pest.\n\nA wide range of pests and diseases can affect the plant. Three of the more common diseases or pests are mildew, aphids, and apple scab.\n* [[Mildew]] is characterized by light grey powdery patches appearing on the leaves, shoots and flowers, normally in spring. The flowers turn a creamy yellow color and do not develop correctly. This can be treated similarly to [[Botryotinia|Botrytis]]\u2014eliminating the conditions that caused the disease and burning the infected plants are among recommended actions.<ref name=\"pest4\"/>\n* [[Aphids]] are a small insect. Five species of aphids commonly attack apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid, and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species can be identified by color, time of year, and by differences in the cornicles (small paired projections from their rear).<ref name=pest4/> Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices.

Apple [[fruit tree|trees]] are [[agriculture|cultivated]] worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the [[genus]] ''[[Malus]]''. The tree originated in [[Central Asia]], where its wild ancestor, ''[[Malus sieversii]]'', is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] and were brought to North America by [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonists]]. Apples have religious and [[mythology|mythological]] significance in many cultures, including [[Norse mythology|Norse]], [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Christianity in Europe|European Christian]] tradition.\n\nApple trees are large if grown from seed.  Generally, apple [[cultivar]]s are propagated by [[grafting]] onto [[rootstock]]s, which control the size of the resulting tree. There are more than 7,500 known [[List of apple cultivars|cultivars of apples]], resulting in a range of desired characteristics. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and use, including [[cooking apple|cooking]], eating raw and [[apple cider|cider]] production. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of [[fungus|fungal]], bacterial and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of [[organic farming|organic]] and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's [[genome]] was [[DNA sequencing|sequenced]] as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.\n\nWorldwide production of apples in 2017 was 83.1&nbsp;million [[tonnes]], with China accounting for half of the total.<ref name=faostat/>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe word \"apple\", formerly spelled ''\u00e6ppel'' in [[Old English]], is derived from the [[Proto-Germanic]] root *ap(a)laz, which could also mean [[fruit]] in general. This is ultimately derived from [[Proto-Indo-European]] *ab(e)l-, but the precise original meaning and the relationship between both words is uncertain.\n\nAs late as the 17th century, the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit other than [[berries]] but including [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s\u2014such as the 14th century [[Middle English]] word ''appel of paradis'', meaning a [[banana]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Origin and meaning of \"apple\" by Online Etymology Dictionary |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/apple |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=22 November 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> This use is analogous to the [[French language]] use of ''pomme''.\n\n==Description==\n\n[[File:Koeh-108.jpg|thumb|right|Blossoms, fruits, and leaves of the apple tree (''Malus domestica'')]]\n[[File:Pink lady and cross section.jpg|thumb|right|An apple's side, stem end, and interior]]\nThe apple is a [[deciduous]] tree, generally standing {{convert|6|to|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} tall in cultivation and up to {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} in the wild.<!--<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.treenames.net/ti/malus/index_apple_tree.html |title=Types and names of Apple Trees, Species of the Malus Genus |publisher=Treenames.net |accessdate=25 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140915015547/http://www.treenames.net/ti/malus/index_apple_tree.html |archive-date=15 September 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>--> When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by [[rootstock]] selection and trimming method.

Some consumers, especially those in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples below {{convert|2+1/4|in|cm|abbr=on}} are generally used for making juice and have little fresh market value.

English scholar [[H. R. Ellis Davidson]] links apples to religious practices in [[Germanic paganism]], from which [[Norse paganism]] developed. She points out that buckets of apples were found in the [[Oseberg ship]] burial site in Norway, that fruit and nuts (I\u00f0unn having been described as being transformed into a nut in ''[[Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l]]'') have been found in the early graves of the [[Germanic peoples]] in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of [[fertility]] in southwest England.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nDavidson notes a connection between apples and the [[Vanir]], a tribe of gods associated with [[fertility]] in Norse mythology, citing an instance of eleven \"golden apples\" being given to woo the beautiful [[Ger\u00f0r]] by [[Sk\u00edrnir]], who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god [[Freyr]] in stanzas 19 and 20 of ''[[Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l]]''. Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of the ''[[V\u00f6lsunga saga]]'' when the major goddess [[Frigg]] sends King [[Rerir]] an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg's messenger (in the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a [[tumulus|mound]].<ref name=\"DAVIDSON165-166\"/> Rerir's wife's consumption of the apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the [[Caesarean section]] birth of their son\u2014the hero [[V\u00f6lsung]].<ref name=\"DAVIDSONROLES146-147\"/>\n\nFurther, Davidson points out the \"strange\" phrase \"Apples of [[Hel (location)|Hel]]\" used in an 11th-century poem by the [[skald]] Thorbiorn Br\u00fanarson. She states this may imply that the apple was thought of by Br\u00fanarson as the food of the dead. Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess [[Nehalennia]] is sometimes depicted with apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the apple in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the [[Roman Empire]] and came to Europe from the [[Near East]], the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter. Davidson concludes that in the figure of I\u00f0unn \"we must have a dim reflection of an old symbol: that of the guardian goddess of the life-giving fruit of the other world.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n===Greek mythology===\n[[File:Hercules Musei Capitolini MC1265 n2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.6|[[Heracles]] with the apple of [[Hesperides]]]]\nApples appear in many [[World religions|religious traditions]], often as a mystical or [[forbidden fruit]].

Apples can be canned, dried or frozen.<ref name=applefood/> Canned or frozen apples are eventually baked into pies or other cooked dishes. Apple juice or cider is also bottled. Apple juice is often concentrated and frozen.\n\n===Popular uses===\nApples are often eaten raw. Cultivars bred for raw consumption are termed dessert or [[table apple]]s.\n* In the UK, a [[toffee apple]] is a traditional confection made by coating an apple in hot [[toffee]] and allowing it to cool. Similar treats in the U.S. are [[candy apple]]s (coated in a hard shell of crystallized sugar syrup) and [[caramel apples]] (coated with cooled [[caramel]]).\n* Apples are eaten with honey at the Jewish New Year of [[Rosh Hashanah]] to symbolize a sweet new year.<ref name=food/>\n\nApples are an important ingredient in many desserts, such as [[apple pie]], apple [[crumble]], [[apple crisp]] and [[apple cake]]. When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as [[apple sauce]]. Apples are also made into [[apple butter]] and apple jelly. They are often [[baked]] or [[stewed]] and are also (cooked) in some meat dishes. Dried apples can be eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid).\n\nApples are milled or pressed to produce [[apple juice]], which may be drunk unfiltered (called [[apple cider]] in North America), or filtered. Filtered juice is often concentrated and frozen, then reconstituted later and consumed. Apple juice can be [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] to make [[cider]] (called hard cider in North America), [[ciderkin]], and vinegar. Through [[distillation]], various alcoholic beverages can be produced, such as [[applejack (beverage)|applejack]], [[Calvados (spirit)|Calvados]], and [[apfelwein]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Edible Medicinal And Non-Medicinal Plants: Volume 4, Fruits|isbn=9789400740532|location=|pages=|last1=Lim|first1=T.

It is the most powerful passenger locomotive in the Indian Railways' fleet. It is a passenger variant of the [[Indian locomotive class WAG-9|WAG 9]] freight locomotive with a modified [[gear ratio]] to pull lighter loads at higher speeds. It is capable of hauling 24 coach trains at speeds ranging {{convert|110|-|140|km/h|abbr=on}}, depending on the MPS (Maximum Permissible Speed) of the sector, and is now largely used by [[Northern Railway (India)|Northern Railways]] (NR), [[South Central Railway zone|South Central Railway]] (SCR), [[Central Railways]] (CR), [[South East Central Railway Zone]] (SECR), [[South Eastern Railway (India)|South Eastern Railways]] (SER), [[West Central Railway zone|West Central Railways]] (WCR), [[Eastern Railway zone|Eastern Railways]] (ER), [[Western Railway zone]] (WR), [[North Central Railway zone]] (NCR), [[South Western Railway zone|South Western Railway]] (SWR) etc among other zones. As of April 2020, there are 1046 locomotives in service, all of which are fitted with [[tightlock coupler]]s (for [[Buffers and chain coupler#Center-buffer-and-chain(s)|central buffer coupling]]) and chain link couplers. In February 2017, [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] built their first WAP 7 class locomotive.<ref name=\"prod_dlw\">{{cite web|title=Brief History of DLW|url=http://www.dlw.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,294,702|publisher=Ministry of Railways, Government of India|accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Performance==\nWith a maximum speed rating of {{convert|140|km/h|abbr=on}} the WAP-7 has the highest acceleration figures while hauling mail/express trains.

The locomotives have been used as a regular link for many of the [[Garib Rath Express|Garib Rath express]] and many [[Humsafar Express|Humsafar express]]<nowiki/>services and eventually extended to a significant number of [[AC Express (Indian Railways)|AC Express]] and [[Superfast/Mail Trains in India|Mail/Superfast Express]] services like [[Jaipur Superfast Express]], [[Thiruvananthapuram Mail]], [[Mangalore Mail]], [[Bangalore Mail]], [[Sewagram Express|Sewagram]] express and so on. It is soon to be the most commonly used passenger locomotive. Upgrades are underway to increase power output and maximum speed. The First High Speed version WAP-7 HS loco ( loco no 30750) was launched on 28 February 2019 capable of attaining 160 km/h with overall reduction in weight by 14 tons.\n\n[[File:WAP730333.jpg|thumb|30333 WAP-7 locomotive of RPM ([[Royapuram Railway Station|Royapuram]]) shed at [[Mysore|Mysuru]], [[Karnataka]].]]\nThe WAP-7 locomotive can deliver {{convert|6125|hp|kW|abbr=on|lk=on}} continuously, with [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] being one of its salient features.

It is the most powerful passenger locomotive in the Indian Railways' fleet. It is a passenger variant of the [[Indian locomotive class WAG-9|WAG 9]] freight locomotive with a modified [[gear ratio]] to pull lighter loads at higher speeds. It is capable of hauling 24 coach trains at speeds ranging {{convert|110|-|140|km/h|abbr=on}}, depending on the MPS (Maximum Permissible Speed) of the sector, and is now largely used by [[Northern Railway (India)|Northern Railways]] (NR), [[South Central Railway zone|South Central Railway]] (SCR), [[Central Railways]] (CR), [[South East Central Railway Zone]] (SECR), [[South Eastern Railway (India)|South Eastern Railways]] (SER), [[West Central Railway zone|West Central Railways]] (WCR), [[Eastern Railway zone|Eastern Railways]] (ER), [[Western Railway zone]] (WR), [[North Central Railway zone]] (NCR), [[South Western Railway zone|South Western Railway]] (SWR) etc among other zones. As of April 2020, there are 1046 locomotives in service, all of which are fitted with [[tightlock coupler]]s (for [[Buffers and chain coupler#Center-buffer-and-chain(s)|central buffer coupling]]) and chain link couplers. In February 2017, [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] built their first WAP 7 class locomotive.<ref name=\"prod_dlw\">{{cite web|title=Brief History of DLW|url=http://www.dlw.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,294,702|publisher=Ministry of Railways, Government of India|accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Performance==\nWith a maximum speed rating of {{convert|140|km/h|abbr=on}} the WAP-7 has the highest acceleration figures while hauling mail/express trains.

The locomotives have been used as a regular link for many of the [[Garib Rath Express|Garib Rath express]] and many [[Humsafar Express|Humsafar express]]<nowiki/>services and eventually extended to a significant number of [[AC Express (Indian Railways)|AC Express]] and [[Superfast/Mail Trains in India|Mail/Superfast Express]] services like [[Jaipur Superfast Express]], [[Thiruvananthapuram Mail]], [[Mangalore Mail]], [[Bangalore Mail]], [[Sewagram Express|Sewagram]] express and so on. It is soon to be the most commonly used passenger locomotive. Upgrades are underway to increase power output and maximum speed. The First High Speed version WAP-7 HS loco ( loco no 30750) was launched on 28 February 2019 capable of attaining 160 km/h with overall reduction in weight by 14 tons.\n\n[[File:WAP730333.jpg|thumb|30333 WAP-7 locomotive of RPM ([[Royapuram Railway Station|Royapuram]]) shed at [[Mysore|Mysuru]], [[Karnataka]].]]\nThe WAP-7 locomotive can deliver {{convert|6125|hp|kW|abbr=on|lk=on}} continuously, with [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] being one of its salient features.
