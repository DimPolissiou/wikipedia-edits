Despite the series being named after her, the main protagonist is [[Kyon]], who narrates the story. She possesses unconscious god-like abilities to change, destroy, and reshape reality to her desires.

In the beginning of the series she had long hair reaching to her waist and would change her hairstyle every day. After having a conversation with Kyon concerning her hair she decided to cut it just above her shoulders. Haruhi is always seen wearing an orange-yellow ribbon in her hair. In ''[[The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya]]'' she is seen with longer, uncut hair. She is often seen in her school uniform along with an arm band that reads as brigade leader, although in occasion is seen in more casual clothes.\n\n==Character history==\nWhile little is revealed about Haruhi's origins or her family, she cites a revelatory incident in her childhood when she attended a baseball game with her family.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|title=[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya]]|last=Tanigawa|first=Nagaru|date=June 6, 2003|publisher=[[Kadokawa Shoten]]|year=|isbn=4-04-429201-9|location=[[Japan]]|page=|pages=|nopp=true|language=Japanese}}</ref> Before the event, Haruhi tended to think of herself and her life as being special and interesting, but the sheer number of people packed into the stadium (and her later calculations that this only represented a small fraction of the population of Japan) caused her to come to the conclusion that the events of her life likely fit into the normal, everyday occurrences and habits of Japanese citizens and humans in general. Her belief that there had to be at least one person in the world who lived a truly interesting and unique life, and her desire to be that person, led her to begin a search for the extraordinary. Throughout middle school she gained a reputation as an eccentric, for incidents including painting hieroglyphs on the school grounds, moving all of the school's desks out into the hallways, and going out with and then dumping every boy who asked her out.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHer entrance into high school is marked by her meeting her fellow student and series protagonist, [[Kyon]], the first person to seriously engage her in conversation related to her interests. He is Haruhi's inspiration to, in despair over the lack of interesting school clubs, create her own: the {{Nihongo|'''''S'''ave the World by '''O'''verloading It with Fun Haruhi '''S'''uzumiya Brigade'' (in the English anime, \"'''''S'''preading Excitement All '''O'''ver the World with Haruhi '''S'''uzumiya Brigade''\")|'''\u4e16'''\u754c\u3092'''\u5927'''\u3044\u306b\u76db\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u308b\u305f\u3081\u306e'''\u6dbc'''\u5bae\u30cf\u30eb\u30d2\u306e\u56e3|'''S'''ekai o '''\u014c'''i ni Moriageru Tame no '''S'''uzumiya Haruhi no Dan}} or the SOS Brigade.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Personality==\nHaruhi's personality is often connected to her supernatural abilities and their use. She is very intelligent, athletic, and naturally talented at nearly everything that she sets out to do.<ref name=\":1\" /> Coupled with her tendency to grow bored easily, this leads to her joining and quitting every after-school activity club. This is set against a front of coldness and indifference to anything that she considers normal and uninteresting, until her encounter with Kyon causes her to become more open.<ref name=\"melancholy1\">Episode 1: ''The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Part I''</ref>\n\nEarlier in the series, Haruhi is startlingly self-centered. She often bullies her members into agreeing with her ideas, especially Mikuru Asahina, whom she habitually forces to change into cosplay outfits, as if she were a human dress-up doll.<ref name=\"melancholy2\"/> She blackmails the president of the Computer Club into giving the SOS Brigade a brand new, state-of-the-art computer by setting him up, taking a photograph of him supposedly [[sexually harassing]] Mikuru.<ref name=\"melancholy2\">Episode 2: ''The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Part II''</ref> Later in the series she becomes more sympathetic to others and displays a strong sense of responsibility towards the well-being of the SOS Brigade members, going so far as to get up early on school days to take care of Yuki when she is sick in ''The Surprise of Haruhi Suzumiya''. Kyon increasingly turns to her as a confidant, even discussing the supernatural problems faced by the SOS Brigade in \"Snowy Mountain Syndrome\" and ''The Surprise'' under the veil of \"family problems\" and \"study problems\" respectively.\n\nHaruhi has a very competitive personality and accepts any challenge that she comes across without hesitation, regardless of difficulty or time constraint.<ref name=\"boredom\">Season 1 episode: ''The Boredom of Haruhi Suzumiya'' April 23, 2006.</ref> Her optimism and over-confidence causes others to view her as arrogant. While she is competitive and quite intelligent, her brashness leads to her being unable to make tactical decisions, and she often rushes head first into anything that she considers a worthy challenge. She has impossibly high standards and won't accept anything less than perfection from herself and her Brigade. She has fairly unrealistic expectations of her Brigade members, especially Kyon, to accomplish the tasks that she sets out for them.\n\nShe enjoys being the center of attention, and her schemes often stem from her desire to increase the SOS Brigade's notoriety and her view that things that are out of the ordinary are fun. She has very little regard for what constitutes 'normal' behavior, as seen when she actively changes clothes in public, even when surrounded by classmates.<ref name=\"melancholy1\" /> When she produced and directed the Brigade's amateur-movie ''The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina'' for the school arts festival, she did so without writing a script, showcasing her spontaneity.<ref>Season 1 episode: ''The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina Episode 00'' April 2, 2006.</ref><ref>Season 2 episode: ''The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya Part 1'' Aug. 14, 2009.</ref>\n\nHaruhi does her best to show no signs of weakness. The few times that she shows signs of vulnerability are when she's alone with Kyon. Following her concert performance at the school's culture festival when Yuki and she filled in for two members of the band ENOZ, Haruhi confesses to Kyon that she feels troubled and anxious. Kyon notes that Haruhi is not used to receiving thanks because she rarely acts in anyone's interest but her own.<ref>Episode 12 (season 1): ''Live Alive''</ref>\n\nAlthough a number of Haruhi's conscious efforts are devoted to the discovery of supernatural beings and events, she is a rational human being. While she hopes that supernatural phenomena exist, some part of her understands that belief in them is irrational. For example, although Haruhi attempts to contact aliens during the [[Tanabata]] holiday three years before the events of the series,<ref>Season 2 episode: ''Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody'' May 22, 2009.</ref> she dismisses Kyon when he posits that the other members of the SOS Brigade (Yuki, Mikuru, and Itsuki) are supernatural creatures, stating that it's 'too convenient' to be true.<ref>Season 2 episode: ''The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya Part 5'' Sept. 11, 2009.</ref>\n\nThough rude and disdainful towards Kyon, she often accepts and follows his reasoning even when it conflicts with her desires, such as forfeiting the baseball tournament in \"The Boredom of Haruhi Suzumiya\" and refraining from using embarrassing photos of Mikuru to promote the SOS Brigade in \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya\".\n\n==Reception==\nAlthough Felicity Hughes of ''[[The Japan Times]]'' describes Haruhi as having ''[[tsundere]]'' character traits in her treatment of Kyon, she notes that the opinion is controversial as fans consider her \"too energetic to be truly tsundere\".<ref>{{cite web|first=Felicity |last=Hughes|

Additionally, Asuna has featured in numerous official ''Sword Art Online'' merchandise, and has been the subject of mixed to mostly positive critical reception, with focus on her relationship with Kirito, attractiveness, and role in the series.\n\n==Creation and conception==\n[[File:Asuna character design.png|thumb|left|'''Left:''' Asuna's [[rapier]] \"Lambent Light\" as shown in the TV series.<br>'''Right:''' Official character design by abec for the light novels]]\nIn an interview with series creator [[Reki Kawahara]], the author noted that the female characters in ''Sword Art Online'' were not based on anyone he knew in the real world, with him stating \"I don\u2019t usually make a character, setting, or anything before I start writing. As I write the story, the girls become what they are now. So, somehow, I don\u2019t know exactly, but somehow, my subliminal idea or some hidden emotion creates the characters to be strong and capable.\" Kawahara also added that he wrote the series to demonstrate that he views online gaming not as a social ill or escape from real life, and thus decided to show games in a more positive light in his light novels.<ref name=\"inquisitr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.inquisitr.com/2055209/sword-art-online-season-3-and-2-kawahara-reki-talks-sao-accel-world-anime-and-future-plans/|title='Sword Art Online' Season 2 and 3: Kawahara Reki talks SAO, 'Accel World', anime, and future plans|author=Frye|first=Patrick|date=May 21, 2015|website=[[Inquisitr]]|accessdate=April 21, 2019}}</ref> In another interview with [[Anime News Network]], interviewer Lynzee Loveridge noted that Asuna is a \"very strong, capable female character\", likening her to Genji's mother in ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', to which Kawahara agreed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2013-04-12/interview-sword-art-online-reki-kawahara|title=Interview: Sword Art Online's Reki Kawahara|author=Loveridge|first=Lynzee|date=April 12, 2013|website=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=April 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAt [[Sakura-Con]] 2013, Kawahara noted that \"the character of Asuna I might have created a little too perfectly for ''Sword Art Online''.

Being one of the few girls that play ''SAO'' and extremely attractive, she receives many invitations and proposals. Asuna is a strong-willed, accomplished player known in-game as the \"Flash\" for her extraordinary fast sword skill. Later, she falls in love with Kirito and they [[Online wedding|marry in-game]]. Towards the end of the ''SAO'' arc, she saves Kirito from a killing blow by Heathcliff at the cost of her life. However, her death was only in-game and she is shortly reunited with Kirito shortly after the death of Heathcliff.\n\nDespite the completion of ''SAO'', Asuna remains unconscious and is instead detained in another virtual reality called ''Alfheim Online''. She is forced to play the role of \"Titania the Queen of Fairies\", with Nobuyuki Sug\u014d, the man responsible for imprisoning her, playing as Oberon the Fairy King. This is done so that Sug\u014d could marry Asuna in the real world, while she is unconscious and thus take over RCT Progress Inc. She attempts to escape the World Tree where she is imprisoned and manages to steal a GM card which she throws out of the window when she hears Yui's voice. Upon being released she creates two avatars for ''Alfheim'', Asuna (being the healer of the team) and Erika (a battle-type avatar), and went on to continue living together with Kirito. She enrolls at the SAO Survivor School with Kazuto Kirigaya in the real world after everything ended. In the real world, Asuna's parents want her to follow in their footsteps. However, after living in ''SAO'' and meeting Kirito, she gains a different perspective and looks back on her past with disgust. She officially becomes Kazuto's real-life girlfriend and dreams of marrying him and having a family with him in the future.\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical commentary===\n[[File:Cherami Leigh by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|[[Cherami Leigh]] has received praise for her performance as Asuna in the English dub.]]\n{{quote box|quote=Asuna finds that she feels more at home in the recreated ''Sword Art Online'' than in the real world.

In the second arc, she was powerless, locked in a literal bird cage and molested by her captor while waiting for her hero to rescue her.

Dictionary.com. Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary. Merriam-Webster, Inc. (accessed: November 24, 2007).</ref> are two flaps of skin on either side of the [[human]] [[vagina]]l opening in the [[vulva]], situated between the [[labia majora]] (Latin for ''larger lips;'' also called outer labia, or outer lips). The labia minora vary widely in size, color and shape from individual to individual.\n\nThe labia minora are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the male [[urethra]]l surface of the penis.<ref>http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/GrossAnatomy/pelvis/homology.html</ref>\n\n==Structure and functioning==\nThe labia minora extend from the [[clitoris]] obliquely downward, laterally, and backward on either side of the [[vulval vestibule]], ending between the bottom of the vulval vestibule and the labia majora. The [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] ends (bottom) of the labia minora are usually joined across the middle line by a fold of skin, named the [[frenulum of labia minora]] or fourchette.<ref name=\"Gray's\"/>\n\nOn the front, each lip forks dividing into two portions surrounding the clitoris. The upper part of each lip passes above the clitoris to meet the upper part of the other lip\u2014which will often be a little larger or smaller\u2014forming a fold which overhangs the [[glans clitoridis]] (clitoral tip or head); this fold is named the [[clitoral hood]]. The lower part passes beneath the glans clitoridis and becomes united to its under surface, forming, with the inner lip of the opposite side, the ''frenulum clitoridis''.<ref name=\"Gray's\"/>\n[[File:Vulva labeled english.jpg|thumb|left|Depilated human [[vulva]] with anatomical feature labels]]\nThe clitoral hood, analogously to the [[foreskin]] of the [[penis]] in men and also termed, like the latter, by the Latin word ''[[Clitoral hood|prepuce]]'', serves to cover most of the time the shaft and sometimes the glans (which is very sensitive to the touch) to protect the clitoris from mechanical irritation and from dryness. Yet the hood is movable and can slide during [[clitoral erection]] or be pulled upwards a little for greater exposure of the clitoris to sexual stimulation.\n\nThe frenulum (Latin for ''little bridle'') is an elastic band of tissue attached by its one end to the clitoral shaft and glans and by its other end to the prepuce. It allows two-way shifting of the clitoral hood: firstly, it can extend to let the hood be moved upwards to expose the glans for stimulation or hygienic cleansing, and secondly, it contracts to pull the hood back to protect it.\n\n===Histology===\nOn the opposed surfaces of the labia minora are numerous [[sebaceous gland]]s not associated with hair follicles.<ref name=\"Gray's\">{{Gray's|page=1265\u20131266|inline=1}}</ref> They are lined by [[stratified squamous epithelium]] on those surfaces.<ref name=\":0\">Manual of Obstetrics. (3rd ed.). Elsevier. pp. 1-16. {{ISBN|9788131225561}}.</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nLike the whole area of the vulval vestibule, the mucus secreted by those glands protects the labia from dryness and mechanical irritation.\n\n===Variation===\nBeing thinner than the outer labia, the inner labia can be also more narrow than the former, or wider than labia majora, thus protruding in the [[pudendal cleft]] and making the term ''minora'' (Latin for smaller) essentially inapplicable in these cases.\n\nThe reception of wider and/or longer labia varies considerably between different people, with some men and women stressing the beauty of bigger labia while other women who have such ones complain of some discomfort either from mechanical irritation by their tighter clothes or from their own or their peers' negative attitude to the image of less compact female genitalia than is stereotypical for them.\n\nThey can also be smooth or frilled, the latter being more typical of longer or wider inner labia.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2004, researchers from the Department of Gynaecology, Elizabeth Garret Anderson Hospital in London, measured the labia and other genital structures of 50 women from the age of 18 to 50, with a mean age of 35.6.

Stimulation of the clitoris may occur through tension of the clitoral hood and its frenulum by inner labia pulling at them. During sexual arousal they are lubricated by the mucus secreted in the vagina and around it to make penetration painless and protect them from irritation.\n\nAs the [[Urinary meatus|female]] [[Urinary meatus|external urethral opening (meatus)]] is also situated between labia minora, they may play a role in guiding the stream of the urine during [[Urination|female]] [[urination]].\n\n=== Medical conditions ===\nBeing very sensitive by their structure to any irritation, and situated in the excretion area where traces of urine, [[vaginal discharge]], [[smegma]] and even [[feces]] may be present, the inner lips may be susceptible to inflammatory infections of the vulva such as [[vulvitis]].\n\nThe likelihood of inflammation may be reduced through appropriate regular hygienic cleansing of the whole vulval vestibule, using water and medically tested cleansing agents designed for vulvas. To avoid contamination of the vulva with fecal bacteria, it is recommended that the vulva is washed only from front to back, from [[mons pubis]] to the [[perineum]] and [[anus]]. Apart from water and special liquid cleansing agents (lotions), there are commercially available [[wet wipe]]s for female intimate hygiene. Some women wipe the vulval vestibule dry with toilet tissue after urination to avoid irritation and infections from residual drops of the urine in the area.\n\nHowever, incorrect choice of cleansing agents, or their incorrect application, may itself cause labial irritation and require medical attention. Over-vigorous rubbing of the labia of little girls while washing, combined with the lack of [[estrogen]] in their bodies, may lead to the mostly pediatric condition known as [[labial fusion]]. If fused labia prevent urination, urine may accumulate and cause pain and inflammation.\n\nIn adult females, irritation of the area may be caused by wearing too-tight underwear (especially where wider inner labia protrude in the pudendal cleft); while [[G-string]]s, which rub against the labia during body movements, may cause irritation or lead to infection from bacteria transferred from either the external environment or the anus.\n\n==Additional images==\n<gallery>\nFile:Illu repdt female.jpg|Organs of the female reproductive system.\nFile:Clitoris_outer_anatomy.png|Outer anatomy of clitoris.\n</gallery>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* ''[[Femalia]]''\n* [[Labia pride]]\n* [[Labia stretching]]\n* [[Labiaplasty]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Labia minora}}\n\n{{Female reproductive system}}\n{{Portal bar|Anatomy}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Labia Minora}}\n[[Category:Mammal female reproductive system]]\n\n[[sn:Hwabvu hutete]]\n[[de:Schamlippe#Die kleinen (inneren) Schamlippen]]\n[[pl:Wargi sromowe mniejsze]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Flaps of skin on either side of the human vaginal opening in the vulva}}\n{{Infobox anatomy\n| Name        = Labia minora\n| Latin       = labium minus pudendi\n| Image       = Labiaminora.jpg\n| Caption     = Labia minora (inner labia) - vertical folds of skin in the very middle of the photo of a vulva (external female genitals) between rounded thicker labia majora (the outer labia).\n| Width       = 250px\n| Image2      = \n| Caption2    = \n| Precursor   = [[Urogenital folds]]\n| System      = \n| Artery      = \n| Vein        = \n| Nerve       = \n| Lymph       = \n}}\nThe '''labia minora''' (Latin for ''smaller lips,'' singular: ''labium minus'' \"smaller lip\"), also known as the '''inner labia''', '''inner lips''', '''vaginal lips''' or '''nymphae''',<ref>''[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nymphae nymphae]''. Dictionary.com. Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary. Merriam-Webster, Inc. (accessed: November 24, 2007).</ref> are two flaps of skin on either side of the [[human]] [[vagina]]l opening in the [[vulva]], situated between the [[labia majora]] (Latin for ''larger lips;'' also called outer labia, or outer lips). The labia minora vary widely in size, color and shape from individual to individual.\n\nThe labia minora are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the male [[urethra]]l surface of the penis.<ref>http://www.meddean.luc.edu/lumen/MedEd/GrossAnatomy/pelvis/homology.html</ref>\n\n==Structure and functioning==\nThe labia minora extend from the [[clitoris]] obliquely downward, laterally, and backward on either side of the [[vulval vestibule]], ending between the bottom of the vulval vestibule and the labia majora. The [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] ends (bottom) of the labia minora are usually joined across the middle line by a fold of skin, named the [[frenulum of labia minora]] or fourchette.<ref name=\"Gray's\"/>\n\nOn the front, each lip forks dividing into two portions surrounding the clitoris. The upper part of each lip passes above the clitoris to meet the upper part of the other lip\u2014which will often be a little larger or smaller\u2014forming a fold which overhangs the [[glans clitoridis]] (clitoral tip or head); this fold is named the [[clitoral hood]]. The lower part passes beneath the glans clitoridis and becomes united to its under surface, forming, with the inner lip of the opposite side, the ''frenulum clitoridis''.<ref name=\"Gray's\"/>\n[[File:Vulva labeled english.jpg|thumb|left|Depilated human [[vulva]] with anatomical feature labels]]\nThe clitoral hood, analogously to the [[foreskin]] of the [[penis]] in men and also termed, like the latter, by the Latin word ''[[Clitoral hood|prepuce]]'', serves to cover most of the time the shaft and sometimes the glans (which is very sensitive to the touch) to protect the clitoris from mechanical irritation and from dryness. Yet the hood is movable and can slide during [[clitoral erection]] or be pulled upwards a little for greater exposure of the clitoris to sexual stimulation.\n\nThe frenulum (Latin for ''little bridle'') is an elastic band of tissue attached by its one end to the clitoral shaft and glans and by its other end to the prepuce. It allows two-way shifting of the clitoral hood: firstly, it can extend to let the hood be moved upwards to expose the glans for stimulation or hygienic cleansing, and secondly, it contracts to pull the hood back to protect it.\n\n===Histology===\nOn the opposed surfaces of the labia minora are numerous [[sebaceous gland]]s not associated with hair follicles.<ref name=\"Gray's\">{{Gray's|page=1265\u20131266|inline=1}}</ref> They are lined by [[stratified squamous epithelium]] on those surfaces.<ref name=\":0\">Manual of Obstetrics.
