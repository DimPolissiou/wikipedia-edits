{"title_page": "Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Historical Record Survey", "text_new": "The 1934-1936 '''Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Historical Record Survey''' (also called \"cards\") was an early demographic review of the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith in the  United States]] and Canada. The backgrounds of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were later studied in a number of ways - racial and ethnic heritage, previous religious background, geographical spread and sometimes how these have changed over the years. Complimentary data sources have also been used to add to some of the reviews including US Census publications and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed directories published in periodicals of [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed literature]]. \n\nA couple of these studies look specifically at the burgeoning black population of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds amidst the wider society practice of continuing [[Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States#New_Deal_era|era of social segregation in the American society of the time]] which was against the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed teaching of the [[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of all humanity]]. The vast majority of the Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were white and mostly elder women, but the black segment of those states Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were in responded more to the religion than the white population of those states did. The religion was also initially attracting Protestants, especially Unitarian Universalists and also among other more mainstream liberal denominations, but as history approached 1936 and beyond it attracted a greater diversity of religious backgrounds as it continued to grow more by conversion than by migration. However intentional migration had been undertaken shortly after this time - the religion had only been present in a few states mostly in the Northeast to North Central and West Coast coming up to 1936 but a goal was set to spread the religion to every state by 1944. As it spread inward from the West coast this mere presence established recognizable proportional membership in the population while in the higher population of the South it did not. But there it did take root too, more so among the black communities along the coastal regions of the South. Indeed this wave of activity was undertaken during the first Seven Year Plan established by [[Shoghi Effendi]] which had the intranational goal of establishing a community in every state as well as establishing the religion in the countries of Latin America.\n\n==Development, context, and reviews of the Survey==\nThe 1934 American national convention affirmed the request of the national race amity committee for a survey of the racial makeup of the community affirming the request of the national amity committee work asking for localized amity committees and consolidation with concerned groups like the NAACP and Urban League.<ref name=GreenThesis>{{cite thesis |author=Jerome Green|date=2004 |title=Trial and Triumph: The Origins of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith in Black America |type=Senior Fellowship Thesis|publisher=Dartmouth College |oclc= 242842724 |url=http://bahai-library.com/green_bahai_black_america |access-date=Feb 9, 2020}}</ref>{{rp|p36}} The same year the national youth committee including [[Marion Holley]] recommended a census be taken of youth as well.<ref>{{cite magazine | title =Youth committee | magazine = Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed News | pages = 23\u20134 | date = May 1934|issue= 74 | url = http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=01&page=601 | access-date =Dec 29, 2017}}</ref> The Survey developed included historical information of the respondent - the date and place they were born, the date and place they joined the religion, and where they were living at the time of the Survey as well as their national and religious background.<ref name=GreenThesis/>{{rp|p66}}\n\nThe Survey was widespread by the summer of 1935.<ref name=GreenThesis/>{{rp|p37}} The complete collection of respondents is a little unclear.

The backgrounds of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were later studied in a number of ways - racial and ethnic heritage, previous religious background, geographical spread and sometimes how these have changed over the years. Complimentary data sources have also been used to add to some of the reviews including US Census publications and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed directories published in periodicals of [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed literature]]. \n\nA couple of these studies look specifically at the burgeoning black population of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds amidst the wider society practice of continuing [[Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States#New_Deal_era|era of social segregation in the American society of the time]] which was against the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed teaching of the [[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith and the unity of humanity|unity of all humanity]]. The vast majority of the Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were white and mostly elder women, but the black segment of those states Bah\u00e1'\u00eds were in responded more to the religion than the white population of those states did. The religion was also initially attracting Protestants, especially Unitarian Universalists and also among other more mainstream liberal denominations, but as history approached 1936 and beyond it attracted a greater diversity of religious backgrounds as it continued to grow more by conversion than by migration. However intentional migration had been undertaken shortly after this time - the religion had only been present in a few states mostly in the Northeast to North Central and West Coast coming up to 1936 but a goal was set to spread the religion to every state by 1944. As it spread inward from the West coast this mere presence established recognizable proportional membership in the population while in the higher population of the South it did not. But there it did take root too, more so among the black communities along the coastal regions of the South. Indeed this wave of activity was undertaken during the first Seven Year Plan established by [[Shoghi Effendi]] which had the intranational goal as well as a goal for establishing the religion in the countries of Latin America.\n\n==Development, context, and reviews of the Survey==\nThe 1934 American national convention affirmed the request of the national race amity committee for a survey of the racial makeup of the community affirming the request of the national amity committee work asking for localized amity committees and consolidation with concerned groups like the NAACP and Urban League.<ref name=GreenThesis>{{cite thesis |author=Jerome Green|date=2004 |title=Trial and Triumph: The Origins of the Bah\u00e1\u2019\u00ed Faith in Black America |type=Senior Fellowship Thesis|publisher=Dartmouth College |oclc= 242842724 |url=http://bahai-library.com/green_bahai_black_america |access-date=Feb 9, 2020}}</ref>{{rp|p36}} The same year the national youth committee including [[Marion Holley]] recommended a census be taken of youth as well.<ref>{{cite magazine | title =Youth committee | magazine = Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed News | pages = 23\u20134 | date = May 1934|issue= 74 | url = http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=01&page=601 | access-date =Dec 29, 2017}}</ref> The Survey developed included historical information of the respondent - the date and place they were born, the date and place they joined the religion, and where they were living at the time of the Survey as well as their national and religious background.<ref name=GreenThesis/>{{rp|p66}}\n\nThe Survey was widespread by the summer of 1935.<ref name=GreenThesis/>{{rp|p37}} The complete collection of respondents is a little unclear.

The team was officially formed in 1987 and is nicknamed the Eagles. \n\nAn international powerhouse during the 1990s\u2014 the Eagles won the inaugural [[1991 Women's Rugby World Cup|1991 Women's World Cup]] and finished second in the two following World Cups in [[1994 Women's Rugby World Cup|1994]] and [[1998 Women's Rugby World Cup|1998]]. The team finished fourth in the most recent Rugby World Cup 2017 in Ireland. \n\nIn May 2018, the Rob Cain was appointed full-time Head Coach. Cain joined the Eagles after winning the inaugural Tyrell Premier 15s title in England with [[Saracens Women]].\n\n==History==\n''(Source: [http://www.uswrf.org/History.aspx US Women's Rugby Foundation])''\n\nThe history of women's rugby in the United States can be traced back to three teams that existed in 1972 \u2013 the Colorado State University Hookers at Fort Collins; the University of Colorado, at Boulder; and the University of Illinois, at Champaign. During the mid-1970s women's teams began to spring up on college campuses across the United States. As those players graduated they went on to set up teams near cities and urban centers. At that time there was only one division for all women's rugby. In 1975 United States Rugby Football Union was formed and contained four territories. At this time the women had their own Board of Directors and followed in parallel USARFU with four territories (East, Midwest, West and Pacific). In 1978 the first Women's National Championships was held. The Chicago Women's Rugby Club in Chicago, Illinois hosted this event. The winner of that championship was Portland, Maine.{{citation needed|this could all be true, but we need sources for it to stay in Wikipedia|date=March 2019}}\n\n===1980s\u20131991===\nIn 1985 the first semblance of a national team was formed. An \u2018invitation-only\u2019 team was put together and made up of, arguably, the top women playing the game at the time. [http://womensrugbyhistory.blogspot.com/1985/11/times-nov-23-1985-pg.html The team was named WIVERN and toured throughout England and France]. The team finished the tour undefeated. Many of these players went on to be selected to the 1991 World Cup Team.\n\nIn 1987 the USA women's national team was officially born with their first match against the Canadian women's national team. Although the women were not permitted to wear the Eagle logo, this match was sanctioned by Rugby Canada and USA Rugby. USA and Canada began holding an annual match, which became known as the CanAm series. For ten years the Women Eagles went undefeated in this test series.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn 1990 the women's national team, competing under the name \u2018USA Presidents 15\u2019, traveled to New Zealand to compete in the historic Women's World Rugby Festival. The WNT posted a record of 3\u20131 with their only loss coming at the hands of New Zealand. In 1991 the first Women's Rugby World Cup was held in Cardiff, Wales. Coached by Beantown's Kevin O\u2019Brien, a Welshman himself, and Minnesota's Chris Leach, a South African the stage was set for the US women to bring home the Cup. Defeating New Zealand in semi-final play, the USA women advanced to the finals where they defeated England. \nAlso in 1991 the first woman was elected to serve on the USARFU Board of Directors. Jamie Jordan was elected Treasurer for the Board.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Present===\nThe USA Women's National Team XVs most recently finished fourth at Rugby World Cup 2017 in Ireland which earned them automatic qualification to the next World Cup in New Zealand in 2021. In early 2018, the program hired former Women's National Team player Emilie Bydwell to serve as its General Manager of Women's High Performance. Soon after in May, Rob Cain was appointed full-time Head Coach and has since helped lead the program in a new direction. \n\nThe Women's National Team Program fields a number of age-grade and development programs including the High School All-Americans (U18), Under-20s, Collegiate All-Americans and USA Selects. All age-grade and development programs are umbrellaed under the national team program and serve as a feeder to the senior Women's Eagles.\n\n==2019 Performance Squad==\nThe 2019 Performance Squad serves as the top tier of the USA Women's National Team XVs depth chart.

Known as the USA Women's Sevens or Eagles Sevens, the program had its most successful season of all-time in 2019, claiming five medals in six tournaments during the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series where they finished with a World No. 2 ranking, won their first-ever gold medal and qualified for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020. \n\nIn 1996 the first assembly of a National Women's 7s team was formed. Emil Signes held tryouts to pick a team to compete in the first Women's International 7s tournament to be held during the Hong Kong 7s event. The team competed under the name \u2018Atlantis\u2019, the National 7s program created by Emil, and finished their tour undefeated. Many of these players went on to compete for the USA Women's 7s Team in the Hong Kong 7s Women's Division.\n\nIn 1997 The U23 women's national team was formed. USA Women's National Team Head Coach Franck Boivert appointed Penn State Coach Peter Steinberg to be Head Coach for the U23 Women's National Team program. At an event in the CanAm Series the US Women's National Team celebrated their 10-year anniversary by cheering on the Women's U23 National Team in their first test against Canada.\n\n== Match List -

is the senior national team for the United States in the 15-a-side version of rugby. The team was officially formed in 1987 and is nicknamed the Eagles. \n\nAn international powerhouse during the 1990s\u2014 the Eagles won the inaugural [[1991 Women's Rugby World Cup|1991 Women's World Cup]] and finished second in the two following World Cups in [[1994 Women's Rugby World Cup|1994]] and [[1998 Women's Rugby World Cup|1998]]. The team finished fourth in the most recent Rugby World Cup 2017 in Ireland. \n\nIn May 2018, the Rob Cain was appointed full-time Head Coach. Cain joined the Eagles after winning the inaugural Tyrell Premier 15s title in England with [[Saracens Women]].\n\n==History==\n''(Source: [http://www.uswrf.org/History.aspx US Women's Rugby Foundation])''\n\nThe history of women's rugby in the United States can be traced back to three teams that existed in 1972 \u2013 the Colorado State University Hookers at Fort Collins; the University of Colorado, at Boulder; and the University of Illinois, at Champaign. During the mid-1970s women's teams began to spring up on college campuses across the United States. As those players graduated they went on to set up teams near cities and urban centers. At that time there was only one division for all women's rugby. In 1975 United States Rugby Football Union was formed and contained four territories. At this time the women had their own Board of Directors and followed in parallel USARFU with four territories (East, Midwest, West and Pacific). In 1978 the first Women's National Championships was held. The Chicago Women's Rugby Club in Chicago, Illinois hosted this event. The winner of that championship was Portland, Maine.{{citation needed|this could all be true, but we need sources for it to stay in Wikipedia|date=March 2019}}\n\n===1980s\u20131991===\nIn 1985 the first semblance of a national team was formed. An \u2018invitation-only\u2019 team was put together and made up of, arguably, the top women playing the game at the time. [http://womensrugbyhistory.blogspot.com/1985/11/times-nov-23-1985-pg.html The team was named WIVERN and toured throughout England and France]. The team finished the tour undefeated. Many of these players went on to be selected to the 1991 World Cup Team.\n\nIn 1987 the USA women's national team was officially born with their first match against the Canadian women's national team. Although the women were not permitted to wear the Eagle logo, this match was sanctioned by Rugby Canada and USA Rugby. USA and Canada began holding an annual match, which became known as the CanAm series. For ten years the Women Eagles went undefeated in this test series.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn 1990 the women's national team, competing under the name \u2018USA Presidents 15\u2019, traveled to New Zealand to compete in the historic Women's World Rugby Festival. The WNT posted a record of 3\u20131 with their only loss coming at the hands of New Zealand. In 1991 the first Women's Rugby World Cup was held in Cardiff, Wales. Coached by Beantown's Kevin O\u2019Brien, a Welshman himself, and Minnesota's Chris Leach, a South African the stage was set for the US women to bring home the Cup. Defeating New Zealand in semi-final play, the USA women advanced to the finals where they defeated England. \nAlso in 1991 the first woman was elected to serve on the USARFU Board of Directors. Jamie Jordan was elected Treasurer for the Board.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Present===\nThe USA Women's National Team XVs most recently finished fourth at Rugby World Cup 2017 in Ireland which earned them automatic qualification to the next World Cup in New Zealand in 2021. In early 2018, the program hired former Women's National Team player Emilie Bydwell to serve as its General Manager of Women's High Performance. Soon after in May, Rob Cain was appointed full-time Head Coach and has since helped lead the program in a new direction. \n\nThe Women's National Team Program fields a number of age-grade and development programs including the High School All-Americans (U18), Under-20s, Collegiate All-Americans and USA Selects. All age-grade and development programs are umbrellaed under the national team program and serve as a feeder to the senior Women's Eagles.\n\n==2019 Performance Squad==\nThe 2019 Performance Squad serves as the top tier of the USA Women's National Team XVs depth chart. Other tiers include the extended squad and the watchlist.

Known as the USA Women's Sevens or Eagles Sevens, the program had its most successful season of all-time in 2019, claiming five medals in six tournaments during the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series where they finished with a World No. 2 ranking, won their first-ever gold medal and qualified for the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020. \n\nIn 1996 the first assembly of a National Women's 7s team was formed. Emil Signes held tryouts to pick a team to compete in the first Women's International 7s tournament to be held during the Hong Kong 7s event. The team competed under the name \u2018Atlantis\u2019, the National 7s program created by Emil, and finished their tour undefeated. Many of these players went on to compete for the USA Women's 7s Team in the Hong Kong 7s Women's Division.\n\nIn 1997 The U23 women's national team was formed. USA Women's National Team Head Coach Franck Boivert appointed Penn State Coach Peter Steinberg to be Head Coach for the U23 Women's National Team program. At an event in the CanAm Series the US Women's National Team celebrated their 10-year anniversary by cheering on the Women's U23 National Team in their first test against Canada.\n\n== Match List -

It is the story of Saba ([[Mahira Khan]]) and the struggles she faces due to being in love with her best friend and cousin Irtiza ([[Humayun Saeed]]). From the very first episode it is established that Saba is madly in love with Irtiza, who she has grown up with. It is also established that Irtiza also cares a lot for Saba, and both have a very close bond. Saba is an extrovert, who lives life to the fullest, and expects Irtiza to fulfil all her childish demands. Irtiza happily does everything Saba asks for, and feels happy seeing her happy.\n\nThe story starts with Saba and Irtiza celebrating Eid, and enjoying their life in Pakistan. Soon after Irtiza decides to go to America for post-graduate studies. Saba is unhappy hearing about this and gets angry at Irtiza. Irtiza reasons with Saba and tells her that he will return in two years. Saba understands that post-graduate studies is important for his career and agrees for him to go. Irtiza goes to America and whilst studying there develops feelings for his cousin Saman ([[Armeena Khan]]).\n\nAfter completing his studies he comes back to Pakistan and Saba is extremely happy to see him. Soon Saman's parents die in a plane crash, and Saman comes to Pakistan along with Irtiza to her extended family for emotional support, Saba and Irtiza take care of her. Soon Saba learns that Saman is not her cousin, but her elder sister,  and that Saman was adopted by her uncle when she was a baby. This fact brings Saba and Saman closer to each other. Both Saman and Saba start sharing a very close sisterly bond. Until one day Saba realises that both Saman and Irtiza have feelings for each other. In spite of loving her sister she cannot help but feel jealousy and anger.\n\nSoon after Saba's realisation, Irtiza proposes marriage to Saman. Saba is heartbroken seeing this, but she collects herself and tries her best to be happy for her best friend and her sister. Saba happily participates in all wedding rituals, however Saba loses all patience when she finally sees Saman and Irtiza making their wedding vows. In the heat of the moment Saba goes off in a separate room and in a state of anger and shock curses Saman and wishes for the fact that she dies! Saba curses Saman and says that Saman should have died in that plane accident with the parents who adopted her, and she can still die! Why did she come here to ruin her life! Saba's Grandmother who is aware of the situation tells Saba to calm down but in vain!\n\nThe next morning Saba feels guilty about what she said about Saman, and apologises to her Grandma. After the marriage, Saba keeps a distance from Irtiza, Irtiza notices Saba's behaviour and questions her on a number of occasions. Saba also starts changing from a very full of life person to a very serious person, Irtiza again observes this and does not seem to like this change in her.\n\nAfter a while Irtiza and Saman go back to America and settle there for sometime. Saman gets pregnant and tells Saba about it, Saba gets very happy about the news and congratulates Saman. Irtiza and Saman decide to call Saba to America. Saba is very hesitant to go and meet them as she still has feelings for Irtiza, she politely declines, but is forced by the family to go and stay with them and help Saman while she is pregnant.\n\nSaba goes to America. Whilst she enjoys the company of her sister, she again feels very helpless, as her feelings for Irtiza do not die. Irtiza's concern for Saba and his friendliness does not help her helplessness either. One day Saba, Saman and Irtiza go to a party, there, a man named Amir ([[Adnan Malik]]) develops feelings for Saba. After the party, on a number of occasions the Amir comes over to Irtiza and Saman's place to try and meet Saba. Both Saman and Irtiza are overjoyed, and feel that the guy will be a great match for her. One day Irtiza sits Saba down and asks her if she is interested in marrying the guy, and she can tell him if she has feelings for him, Saba loses her patience and rudely reverts stating that he has no business meddling in her personal life and he should stay away! This behaviour of Saba makes Irtiza upset, for which later Saba also apologises!\n\nSoon Saman delivers a baby boy and Irtiza and her name him Maaz. Saba goes back to Pakistan. A few years pass and Saba does not accept the proposal of Amir, Irtiza feels disappointed, where else Saman tries to understand why Saba does not have any love interest in her life.\n\nSaman and Irtiza go to Pakistan for holidays with Maaz. Saman tells Saba that Amir is now getting married, Saba does not seem concerned and says \"congrats,\" Saman asks Saba about why she did not want to marry him? to which Saba replies \"He is not the person she can see her life with!\" Soon after she says this it starts raining, and Saba gets excited and carries Maaz out to the rain, and both of them start enjoying dancing in the rain! Saman closely observes Saba enjoying and dancing in the rain, and suddenly it hits her that even Irtiza loves the rain a lot! After which she starts reminiscing and realises that Saba has been in love with Irtiza all this while! Thinking this Saman feels quite guilty!\n\nThe next day it is Maaz's birthday, and Irtiza, Saman and Saba go out to the mall to shop for Maaz's birthday party. Irtiza goes inside the mall to buy Maaz's cake, and Saman gets excited seeing flowers, she tells Saba to wait for her in the car and she will get the flowers, Saba stops her and tells her that Irtiza can get the flowers, but she does not listen and heads off, when Saman is returning from getting the flowers she is hit by a car in front of Saba's eyes! Saba runs to Saman to see her covered in blood! Irtiza and Saba call the ambulance. Whilst Saman is being taken to the hospital, she tells Saba that she is sorry, and now both Irtiza and Maaz are hers, when Saba hears this she gets very anxious, and tells the driver of the ambulance to drive faster! However Saman does not survive the hit and run!\n\nSaba is shown to be extremely guilt-ridden and broken down after the accident. She keeps on getting flashbacks of Saman getting rammed in by the car coupled with the voice over of her cursing \"she should have died\" Saba feels that she is responsible for Saman's death as she cursed her on her wedding. Saba is completely broken but develops a very strong bond with Maaz.\n\nSoon the Grandmother feels that it would be good if Saba marries Irtiza, as this will benefit Irtiza and Maaz, as they are lonely, and it will also benefit Saba since she has always been in love with him. Saba gets very angry hearing this proposal, as she is extremely guilt ridden, and says that she will never marry Irtiza! When Irtiza is asked about the same proposal, he outright rejects it stating that Saba deserves a much better man, and not a man who was married and has a kid, and that he cannot even think like this. Irtiza soon realises that Saba is angry with him due to the proposal, Irtiza talks with Saba and reasons with her! He tells her that he cannot even think of marrying her in his dreams and that he wants the best man for her, and he is not the best, he also says that he loves her a lot, and to not be angry with him! Saba does not seem to care much for what Irtiza says, and says \"she is not angry with him\" and leaves.\n\nSoon after Saba gets a proposal for marriage. Saba does not care to meet the man in question, and says \"yes.\" Soon Saba is married off to him. On the wedding night the man in question confesses to Saba that he is already married and has a wife and a child in America, and that he married her due to family pressure, and no matter what he can never give her the love and the importance of a wife. Strangely Saba accepts this, and tells him that she is absolutely fine with this arrangement and that she will not be telling her parents about it, which gets the man quite confused. Soon the man leaves for America, leaving Saba behind.\n\nSaba stays back in Pakistan, and Irtiza starts getting concerned about why Saba is not going to America, and why is her visa taking so much time. He confronts Saba about it on a number of occasions but Saba rudely reverts stating that such things take time, and to not interfere in her personal matters. Irtiza's concern for Saba starts growing and he decides to take matters in his own hands, one day he goes to America for a business trip and goes to meet the husband there, where he sees him with his wife and children! Irtiza gets angry seeing this and starts insulting the husband, after which the husband tells Irtiza that Saba always knew about this, and that no one had stopped her from telling you guys! Irtiza gets angry hearing this!\n\nIrtiza goes back to Pakistan and tells the family about Saba's husband 's second wife and children! He confronts Saba and gets angry with her for keeping them in the dark about this! Soon out of family pressure Saba divorces her husband and goes back home! After the divorce Saba becomes even more depressed! Everyone tries to get her out of the depression but in vain! Saba gets extremely bitter with Irtiza, and tells him that she is no longer friends with him and to leave her alone! Irtiza is upset hearing this and tells her that he has always wanted the best for her, so how can she think about him like this?\n\nSaba's parents are concerned about Saba's future and become depressed. Soon Saba gets another proposal from a divorcee who is 20 years older than her and has two kids! Hearing this Irtiza gets very angry and tells Saba's father off for even paying heed to such a proposal! Saba's father explains to Irtiza that Saba will not be getting very good proposals anymore as she herself is a divorcee! Irtiza gets upset hearing this! One day Irtiza sees Saba's mother crying and stating what bad did her daughter did, and why is her life so difficult, Irtza hearing this tells Saba's mother that he wants to marry Saba! He also states that he cannot see Saba ruining her life anymore!\n\nSaba becomes infuriated upon learning that Irtiza has proposed marriage, she then confronts Irtiza. Irtiza listens to her anger but does not change his decision. Soon Saba's grandmother gets sick due to seeing Saba in such a state, she tells Saba to marry Irtiza, Saba agrees to the marriage half-heartedly.\n\nSaba and Irtiza marry in an intimate ceremony. but afterwards, Saba changes little and continues to isolate. Saba's parents are upset watching their daughter's condition. One day Irtiza loses his patience and forces Saba to come downstairs to his room. Saba gets furious and tells him off, and tells him that he has no right to humiliate her like this! Irtiza replies that he cannot see the family suffer like this, so please at least for their sake at least pretend to be happy with this marriage! He further tells Saba that she knows him for years, and that she should trust him enough to know that he will never force himself on her, Saba agrees to his request and tells him that she can pretend to be happy with this marriage for the family's sake.\n\nSoon Saba softens and begins to participate in family activities, to the delight of her parents. Irtiza then one day announces that he needs to go to America for a month or two for business. The family tell Irtiza that Saba should also go along with him! Saba tries to protest but in vain!\n\nBoth Saba and Irtiza go to America. Upon landing in America and in the house where Saman and Irtiza used to live, Saba starts to feel very disturbed! To the extent of nearly fainting, Irtiza observes this and helps her! Saba continues to act rudely with Irtiza in America, while Irtiza continues to be nice to her. Slowly Saba soften ups and starts going out with irtiza for outings. Irtiza starts to develop feelings for Saba, and tries his best to bring out the same chirpy Saba that she used to be!\n\nOne evening Irtiza finds Saba sleeping on the couch, he puts a blanket on her and observes her sleeping, soon Saba wakes up, and politely smiles at him, Irtiza looks deep into her eyes and holds her hands, which makes Saba very uncomfortable! Saba walks up to leave, but Irtiza stops her by holding her arm, Saba gets furious and starts shouting at Irtiza! And tells him point blank that she does not want to see his face, and why is that so hard for him to understand? Irtiza gets very hurt and angry hearing this and tells her that after they go back to Pakistan he will make the kind of arrangements that Saba will hardly have to see him at all! He gets angry and leaves, leaving Saba upset and anxious about hurting Irtiza!\n\nAfter the incident Saba tries hard to communicate with Irtiza, but in vain! One day Saba gets through to Irtiza and tells him to come early from work as she feels extremely lonely here all alone, Irtiza softens up and tells her that he will be back by 5pm. Irtiza leaves for office, after which a friend comes to meet him and tells him to visit a construction site with him. Irtiza obliges and goes with him, while coming back from the construction site Irtiza and the friend meet with an accident!\n\nSaba continues to wait for Irtiza at home, soon she gets a phone call informing her about the car accident, Saba gets extremely disturbed by the news and starts anxiously shivering, in the morning Saba hears a car pulling up in the driveway and she runs and finds Irtiza there! As soon as Saba sees Irtiza she starts pushing him, and starts hitting him, she yells at him and says \"Where have you been! You told me you will be home by the evening!\" Irtiza tries to explain that he met with an accident, Saba gets more hyper after hearing this and says \"All of you guys are planning to leave me, first Saman left and now even you are planning to leave me, all of you guys want to leave me here all alone!\" She gets hyper and starts shoving him, Irtiza loses his cool and holds her and shouts \"I am going nowhere! I am here with you!\"\n\nSaba and Irtiza return home. Saba confesses everything. She starts by telling him that she has loved him for years and if anything ever happens to him she will die. She then further starts confessing that it is because of this love she feels so guilty, because it is because of this love she cursed her sister and she is no longer in this world. She cries her heart out and blames Irtiza for always taking so much care of her. And always being there for her. And because of this she fell in love with him so deeply. She cries and questions him! \"Why did you care for me so much?\" After the confession Saba passes out and Irtiza lays her on the couch to sleep.\n\nWhile Saba is sleeping, Irtiza watches her, and remember all that Saba has confessed and has tears in his eyes! Soon after when Saba wakes up, Irtiza tells Saba that he has always cared for her, because he has always loved her! Seeing her happy has always been his priority in his life! He says that the love he has felt for her all these years is very pure, it is the kind of love that is not selfish but selfless, this love only wants to see her happy, the love he has for her cannot be shaken up no matter how rude she is with him, no matter what she does, he can never hate her, he says \"You expect me to hate you, but someone who has loved you all their life can never hate you! \" To which Saba replies that he lost his wife because of her! Irtiza tells her that no one can control destiny and life, and that she is not responsible for Saman's death! It is a bad incident that happened! And that she is not liable for it! He also says that he does not believe both of them have done any disservice to Saman! He further says that she needs to stop being ashamed of loving him, because no matter how much the try their love for each other can never die! Both Saba and Irtiza hug each other. Later they are shown to live happily ever after!\n\n== Cast ==\n\n===Main Cast===\n* [[Humayun Saeed]] as Irtaza Muzaffar\n* [[Mahira Khan]] as Saba Shafiq \n* [[Armeena Rana Khan]] as Saman Shafiq\n\n===Recurring Cast===\n* [[Adnan Malik]] as Aamir\n* [[Javed Sheikh]] as Shafiq (Saba and Saman's father)\n* [[Zeba Bakhtiar]] as Maliha Shafiq (Saba and Saman's mother) \n* [[Jahanzeb Khan]] as Zafar \n* [[Junaid Khan (singer)|Junaid Khan]] as Safir \n* Azra Mansoor as Saba and Saman's dadi\n* Aini Zaidi as Talat \n* Rashid Khawaja as Ansar (Maleeha's brother)\n* Aini Zaidi as Ansar's wife, Maleeha's sister-in-law\n* [[Huma Nawab]] as Safeer's mother (young)\n* Arjumand Azhar as Javed\n* Shazia Naz as Sonia\n* Saima Kanwal as Safeer's mother (old)\n* Sonia Nayyar\n\n===Guest Cast===\n* [[Zaheen Tahira]] as Rehmat Bi\n* [[Faiza Hassan]] as Singer (episode 1)\n* [[Adeel Hussain]] as a dancer in Ballay Ballay song\n* [[Saman Ansari]] as Hira Amir's sister (cameo)\n* [[Sidra Batool]] as Shiza (Saba's friend)\n\n== Production ==\n===Development=== \nIn 2013, it was announced that a drama series is being developed based on [[Farhat Ishtiaq]]'s novel ''[[Bin Roye Ansoo]]'', before the project went into [[development hell]] for almost half an year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bin Roye Starring Mahira Khan \u2013 Release Date & Official Poster |url=http://www.brandsynario.com/bin-roye-starring-mahira-khan-release-date-official-poster/|first=Yusra|last=Hussain|publisher=HIP|date=2 April 2015|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref> It was later revealed that ''Bin Roye'' will be released as a theatrical film and later on as TV series.<ref>{{Cite web|title=HUM Films presents BIN ROYE \u2013 the movie|url=http://blogs.humnetwork.com/hum-films-presents-bin-roye-the-movie/|last=Zarish| first=Gill|publisher=[[Hum TV]]|date=10 April 2015|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> Actor [[Humayun Saeed]] who played the lead role in film revealed, \"''Bin Roye'' is a romantic drama.

It is the story of Saba ([[Mahira Khan]]) and the struggles she faces due to being in love with her best friend and cousin Irtiza ([[Humayun Saeed]]). From the very first episode it is established that Saba is madly in love with Irtiza, who she has grown up with. It is also established that Irtiza also cares a lot for Saba, and both have a very close bond. Saba is an extrovert, who lives life to the fullest, and expects Irtiza to fulfil all her childish demands. Irtiza happily does everything Saba asks for, and feels happy seeing her happy.\n\nThe story starts with Saba and Irtiza celebrating Eid, and enjoying their life in Pakistan. Soon after Irtiza decides to go to America for post-graduate studies. Saba is unhappy hearing about this and gets angry at Irtiza. Irtiza reasons with Saba and tells her that he will be back in 2 years. Saba understands that post-graduate studies is important for his career and agrees for him to go. Irtiza goes to America and whilst studying there develops feelings for his cousin Saman ([[Armeena Khan]]).\n\nAfter completing his studies he comes back to Pakistan and Saba is extremely happy to see him. Soon Saman's parents die in a plane crash, and Saman comes to Pakistan along with Irtiza to her extended family for emotional support, Saba and Irtiza take care of her. Soon Saba learns that Saman is not her cousin, but her elder sister,  and that Saman was adopted by her uncle when she was a baby. This fact brings Saba and Saman closer to each other. Both Saman and Saba start sharing a very close sisterly bond. Until one day Saba realises that both Saman and Irtiza have feelings for each other. In spite of loving her sister she cannot help but feel jealousy and anger.\n\nSoon after Saba's realisation, Irtiza proposes marriage to Saman. Saba is heartbroken seeing this, but she collects herself and tries her best to be happy for her best friend and her sister. Saba happily participates in all wedding rituals, however Saba loses all patience when she finally sees Saman and Irtiza making their wedding vows. In the heat of the moment Saba goes off in a separate room and in a state of anger and shock curses Saman and wishes for the fact that she dies! Saba curses Saman and says that Saman should have died in that plane accident with the parents who adopted her, and she can still die! Why did she come here to ruin her life! Saba's Grandmother who is aware of the situation tells Saba to calm down but in vain!\n\nThe next morning Saba feels guilty about what she said about Saman, and apologises to her Grandma. After the marriage, Saba keeps a distance from Irtiza, Irtiza notices Saba's behaviour and questions her on a number of occasions. Saba also starts changing from a very full of life person to a very serious person, Irtiza again observes this and does not seem to like this change in her.\n\nAfter a while Irtiza and Saman go back to America and settle there for sometime. Saman gets pregnant and tells Saba about it, Saba gets very happy about the news and congratulates Saman. Irtiza and Saman decide to call Saba to America. Saba is very hesitant to go and meet them as she still has feelings for Irtiza, she politely declines, but is forced by the family to go and stay with them and help Saman while she is pregnant.\n\nSaba goes to America. Whilst she enjoys the company of her sister, she again feels very helpless, as her feelings for Irtiza do not die. Irtiza's concern for Saba and his friendliness does not help her helplessness either. One day Saba, Saman and Irtiza go for a party, there in the party a guy named Amir ([[Adnan Malik]])\nstarts to develop feelings for Saba. After the party, on a number of occasions the Amir comes over to Irtiza and Saman's place to try and meet Saba. Both Saman and Irtiza are overjoyed, and feel that the guy will be a great match for her. One day Irtiza sits Saba down and asks her if she is interested in marrying the guy, and she can tell him if she has feelings for him, Saba loses her patience and rudely reverts stating that he has no business meddling in her personal life and he should stay away! This behaviour of Saba makes Irtiza upset, for which later Saba also apologises!\n\nSoon Saman delivers a baby boy and Irtiza and her name him Maaz. Saba goes back to Pakistan. A few years pass and Saba does not accept the proposal of Amir, Irtiza feels disappointed, where else Saman tries to understand why Saba does not have any love interest in her life.\n\nSaman and Irtiza go to Pakistan for holidays with Maaz. Saman tells Saba that Amir is now getting married, Saba does not seem concerned and says \"congrats,\" Saman asks Saba about why she did not want to marry him? to which Saba replies \"He is not the person she can see her life with!\" Soon after she says this it starts raining, and Saba gets excited and carries Maaz out to the rain, and both of them start enjoying dancing in the rain! Saman closely observes Saba enjoying and dancing in the rain, and suddenly it hits her that even Irtiza loves the rain a lot! After which she starts reminiscing and realises that Saba has been in love with Irtiza all this while! Thinking this Saman feels quite guilty!\n\nThe next day it is Maaz's birthday, and Irtiza, Saman and Saba go out to the mall to shop for Maaz's birthday party. Irtiza goes inside the mall to buy Maaz's cake, and Saman gets excited seeing flowers, she tells Saba to wait for her in the car and she will get the flowers, Saba stops her and tells her that Irtiza can get the flowers, but she does not listen and heads off, when Saman is returning from getting the flowers she is hit by a car in front of Saba's eyes! Saba runs to Saman to see her covered in blood! Irtiza and Saba call the ambulance. Whilst Saman is being taken to the hospital, she tells Saba that she is sorry, and now both Irtiza and Maaz are hers, when Saba hears this she gets very anxious, and tells the driver of the ambulance to drive faster! However Saman does not survive the hit and run!\n\nSaba is shown to be extremely guilt ridden and broken down after the accident. She keeps on getting flashbacks of Saman getting rammed in by the car coupled with the voice over of her cursing \"she should have died\" Saba feels that she is responsible for Saman's death as she cursed her on her wedding. Saba is completely broken but develops a very strong bond with Maaz.\n\nSoon the Grandmother feels that it would be good if Saba gets married to Irtiza, as this will benefit Irtiza and Maaz, as they are lonely, and it will also benefit Saba since she has always been in love with him. Saba gets very angry hearing this proposal, as she is extremely guilt ridden, and says that she will never marry Irtiza! When Irtiza is asked about the same proposal, he outright rejects it stating that Saba deserves a much better man, and not a man who was married and has a kid, and that he cannot even think like this. Irtiza soon realises that Saba is angry with him due to the proposal, Irtiza talks with Saba and reasons with her! He tells her that he cannot even think of marrying her in his dreams and that he wants the best man for her, and he is not the best, he also says that he loves her a lot, and to not be angry with him! Saba does not seem to care much for what Irtiza says, and says \"she is not angry with him\" and leaves.\n\nSoon after Saba gets a proposal for marriage. Saba does not care to meet the man in question, and says \"yes.\" Soon Saba is married off to him. On the wedding night the man in question confesses to Saba that he is already married and has a wife and a child in America, and that he married her due to family pressure, and no matter what he can never give her the love and the importance of a wife. Strangely Saba accepts this, and tells him that she is absolutely fine with this arrangement and that she will not be telling her parents about it, which gets the man quite confused. Soon the man leaves for America, leaving Saba behind.\n\nSaba stays back in Pakistan, and Irtiza starts getting concerned about why Saba is not going to America, and why is her visa taking so much time. He confronts Saba about it on a number of occasions but Saba rudely reverts stating that such things take time, and to not interfere in her personal matters. Irtiza's concern for Saba starts growing and he decides to take matters in his own hands, one day he goes to America for a business trip and goes to meet the husband there, where he sees him with his wife and children! Irtiza gets angry seeing this and starts insulting the husband, after which the husband tells Irtiza that Saba always knew about this, and that no one had stopped her from telling you guys! Irtiza gets angry hearing this!\n\nIrtiza goes back to Pakistan and tells the family about Saba's husband 's second wife and children! He confronts Saba and gets angry with her for keeping them in the dark about this! Soon out of family pressure Saba divorces her husband and goes back home! After the divorce Saba becomes even more depressed! Everyone tries to get her out of the depression but in vain! Saba gets extremely bitter with Irtiza, and tells him that she is no longer friends with him and to leave her alone! Irtiza is upset hearing this and tells her that he has always wanted the best for her, so how can she think about him like this?\n\nSaba's parents are concerned about Saba's future and become depressed. Soon Saba gets another proposal from a divorcee who is 20 years older than her and has two kids! Hearing this Irtiza gets very angry and tells Saba's father off for even paying heed to such a proposal! Saba's father explains to Irtiza that Saba will not be getting very good proposals anymore as she herself is a divorcee! Irtiza gets upset hearing this! One day Irtiza sees Saba's mother crying and stating what bad did her daughter did, and why is her life so difficult, Irtza hearing this tells Saba's mother that he wants to marry Saba! He also states that he cannot see Saba ruining her life anymore!\n\nSaba becomes infuriated upon learning that Irtiza has proposed marriage, she then confronts Irtiza. Irtiza listens to her anger but does not change his decision. Soon Saba's grandmother gets sick due to seeing Saba in such a state, she tells Saba to marry Irtiza, Saba agrees to the marriage half-heartedly!\n\nSaba and Irtiza marry in an intimate ceremony. but afterwards, Saba changes little and continues to isolate. Saba's parents are upset watching their daughter's condition. One day Irtiza loses his patience and forces Saba to come downstairs to his room. Saba gets furious and tells him off, and tells him that he has no right to humiliate her like this! Irtiza replies that he cannot see the family suffer like this, so please at least for their sake at least pretend to be happy with this marriage! He further tells Saba that she knows him for years, and that she should trust him enough to know that he will never force himself on her, Saba agrees to his request and tells him that she can pretend to be happy with this marriage for the family's sake.\n\nSoon Saba softens and begins to participate in family activities, to the delight of her parents. Irtiza then one day announces that he needs to go to America for a month or two for business. The family tell Irtiza that Saba should also go along with him! Saba tries to protest but in vain!\n\nBoth Saba and Irtiza go to America. Upon landing in America and in the house where Saman and Irtiza used to live, Saba starts to feel very disturbed! To the extent of nearly fainting, Irtiza observes this and helps her! Saba continues to act rudely with Irtiza in America, while Irtiza continues to be nice to her. Slowly Saba soften ups and starts going out with irtiza for outings. Irtiza starts to develop feelings for Saba, and tries his best to bring out the same chirpy Saba that she used to be!\n\nOne evening Irtiza finds Saba sleeping on the couch, he puts a blanket on her and observes her sleeping, soon Saba wakes up, and politely smiles at him, Irtiza looks deep into her eyes and holds her hands, which makes Saba very uncomfortable! Saba walks up to leave, but Irtiza stops her by holding her arm, Saba gets furious and starts shouting at Irtiza! And tells him point blank that she does not want to see his face, and why is that so hard for him to understand? Irtiza gets very hurt and angry hearing this and tells her that after they go back to Pakistan he will make the kind of arrangements that Saba will hardly have to see him at all! He gets angry and leaves, leaving Saba upset and anxious about hurting Irtiza!\n\nAfter the incident Saba tries hard to communicate with Irtiza, but in vain! One day Saba gets through to Irtiza and tells him to come early from work as she feels extremely lonely here all alone, Irtiza softens up and tells her that he will be back by 5pm. Irtiza leaves for office, after which a friend comes to meet him and tells him to visit a construction site with him. Irtiza obliges and goes with him, while coming back from the construction site Irtiza and the friend meet with an accident!\n\nSaba continues to wait for Irtiza at home, soon she gets a phone call informing her about the car accident, Saba gets extremely disturbed by the news and starts anxiously shivering, in the morning Saba hears a car pulling up in the driveway and she runs and finds Irtiza there! As soon as Saba sees Irtiza she starts pushing him, and starts hitting him, she yells at him and says \"Where have you been! You told me you will be home by the evening!\" Irtiza tries to explain that he met with an accident, Saba gets more hyper after hearing this and says \"All of you guys are planning to leave me, first Saman left and now even you are planning to leave me, all of you guys want to leave me here all alone!\" She gets hyper and starts shoving him, Irtiza loses his cool and holds her and shouts \"I am going nowhere! I am here with you!\"\n\nSaba and Irtiza return home. Saba confesses everything. She starts by telling him that she has loved him for years and if anything ever happens to him she will die. She then further starts confessing that it is because of this love she feels so guilty, because it is because of this love she cursed her sister and she is no longer in this world. She cries her heart out and blames Irtiza for always taking so much care of her. And always being there for her. And because of this she fell in love with him so deeply. She cries and questions him! \"Why did you care for me so much?\" After the confession Saba passes out and Irtiza lays her on the couch to sleep.\n\nWhile Saba is sleeping, Irtiza watches her, and remember all that Saba has confessed and has tears in his eyes! Soon after when Saba wakes up, Irtiza tells Saba that he has always cared for her, because he has always loved her! Seeing her happy has always been his priority in his life! He says that the love he has felt for her all these years is very pure, it is the kind of love that is not selfish but selfless, this love only wants to see her happy, the love he has for her cannot be shaken up no matter how rude she is with him, no matter what she does, he can never hate her, he says \"You expect me to hate you, but someone who has loved you all their life can never hate you! \" To which Saba replies that he lost his wife because of her! Irtiza tells her that no one can control destiny and life, and that she is not responsible for Saman's death! It is a bad incident that happened! And that she is not liable for it! He also says that he does not believe both of them have done any disservice to Saman! He further says that she needs to stop being ashamed of loving him, because no matter how much the try their love for each other can never die! Both Saba and Irtiza hug each other. Later they are shown to live happily ever after!\n\n== Cast ==\n\n===Main Cast===\n* [[Humayun Saeed]] as Irtaza Muzaffar\n* [[Mahira Khan]] as Saba Shafiq \n* [[Armeena Rana Khan]] as Saman Shafiq\n\n===Recurring Cast===\n* [[Adnan Malik]] as Aamir\n* [[Javed Sheikh]] as Shafiq (Saba and Saman's father)\n* [[Zeba Bakhtiar]] as Maliha Shafiq (Saba and Saman's mother) \n* [[Jahanzeb Khan]] as Zafar \n* [[Junaid Khan (singer)|Junaid Khan]] as Safir \n* Azra Mansoor as Saba and Saman's dadi\n* Aini Zaidi as Talat \n* Rashid Khawaja as Ansar (Maleeha's brother)\n* Aini Zaidi as Ansar's wife, Maleeha's sister-in-law\n* [[Huma Nawab]] as Safeer's mother (young)\n* Arjumand Azhar as Javed\n* Shazia Naz as Sonia\n* Saima Kanwal as Safeer's mother (old)\n* Sonia Nayyar\n\n===Guest Cast===\n* [[Zaheen Tahira]] as Rehmat Bi\n* [[Faiza Hassan]] as Singer (episode 1)\n* [[Adeel Hussain]] as co-dancer in Ballay Ballay song\n* [[Saman Ansari]] as Hira Amir's sister (cameo)\n* [[Sidra Batool]] as Shiza (Saba's friend)\n\n== Production ==\n===Development=== \nIn 2013, it was announced that a drama series is being developed based on [[Farhat Ishtiaq]]'s novel ''[[Bin Roye Ansoo]]'', before the project went into [[development hell]] for almost half an year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bin Roye Starring Mahira Khan \u2013 Release Date & Official Poster |url=http://www.brandsynario.com/bin-roye-starring-mahira-khan-release-date-official-poster/|first=Yusra|last=Hussain|publisher=HIP|date=2 April 2015|accessdate=12 September 2016}}</ref> It was later revealed that ''Bin Roye'' will be released as a theatrical film and later on as TV series.<ref>{{Cite web|title=HUM Films presents BIN ROYE \u2013 the movie|url=http://blogs.humnetwork.com/hum-films-presents-bin-roye-the-movie/|last=Zarish| first=Gill|publisher=[[Hum TV]]|date=10 April 2015|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> Actor [[Humayun Saeed]] who played the lead role in film revealed, \"''Bin Roye'' is a romantic drama.

{"title_page": "Decoy effect", "text_new": "{{short description|Phenomenon in marketing}}\nIn [[marketing]], the '''decoy effect''' (or '''attraction effect''' or '''asymmetric dominance effect''') is the phenomenon whereby consumers will tend to have a specific change in preference between two options when also presented with a third option that is ''asymmetrically dominated''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Huber|first1=Joel|last2=Payne|first2=John W.|last3=Puto|first3=Christopher|title=Adding Asymmetrically Dominated Alternatives: Violations of Regularity and the Similarity Hypothesis|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=9|issue=1|year=1982|pages=90\u201398|doi=10.1086/208899|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/696cb1b066144e5aff70121b5de9b038685d5b94}}</ref> An option is asymmetrically dominated when it is inferior in all respects to one option; but, in comparison to the other option, it is inferior in some respects and superior in others. In other words, in terms of specific attributes determining preferences, it is completely dominated by (i.e., inferior to) one option and only partially dominated by the other. When the asymmetrically dominated option is present, a higher percentage of consumers will prefer the dominating option than when the asymmetrically dominated option is absent. The asymmetrically dominated option is therefore a [[decoy]] serving to increase preference for the dominating option. The decoy effect is also an example of the violation of the [[independence of irrelevant alternatives]] [[axiom]] of [[decision theory]].  More simply, when deciding between two options, an unattractive third option can change the perceived preference between the other two.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Robson |first1=David |title=The trick that makes you overspend |url=https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190801-the-trick-that-makes-you-overspend |website=www.bbc.com |accessdate=1 August 2019 |language=en |date=1 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe decoy effect is considered particularly important in choice theory because it is a violation of the assumption of \"regularity\" present in all axiomatic choice models, for example in a Luce model of choice.<ref>Luce, R. Duncan. \"The choice axiom after twenty years.\"(1977), Journal of mathematical psychology 15 (3) 215-233.</ref>  Regularity means that it should not be possible for the market share of any alternative to increase when another alternative is added to the choice set. The new alternative should reduce, or at best leave unchanged, the choice share of existing alternatives. Regularity is violated in the example shown below where a new alternative C not only changes the relative shares of A and B but actually increases the share of A in absolute terms.  Similarly, the introduction of a new alternative D increases the share of B in absolute terms.\n\n==Examples==\nSuppose there is a [[consideration set]] (options to choose from in a menu) that involves [[MP3 players]]. Consumers will generally see higher storage capacity (number of [[Gigabyte|GB]]) and lower price as positive attributes; while some consumers may want a player that can store more songs, other consumers will want a player that costs less. In Consideration Set 1, two devices are available:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Consideration Set 1\n|-\n! !! A !! B\n|-\n! price\n| $400 || $300\n|-\n! storage\n| 30GB || 20GB\n|}\n\nIn this case, some consumers will prefer ''A'' for its greater storage capacity, while others will prefer ''B'' for its lower price.\n\nNow suppose that a new player, ''C'', the \"decoy\", is added to the market; it is more expensive than both ''A'', the \"target\", and ''B'', the \"competitor\", and has more storage than ''B'' but less than ''A'':\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Consideration Set 2\n|-\n! !! A (target) !! B (competitor) !! C (decoy)\n|-\n! price\n| $400 || $300 || $450\n|-\n! storage\n| 30GB || 20GB || 25GB\n|}\n\nThe addition of decoy ''C'' \u2014 which consumers would presumably avoid, given that a lower price can be paid for a model with more storage\u2014causes ''A'', the dominating option, to be chosen more often than if only the two choices in Consideration Set 1 existed; ''C'' affects consumer preferences by acting as a basis of comparison for ''A'' and ''B''. Because ''A'' is better than ''C'' in both respects, while ''B'' is only partially better than ''C'', more consumers will prefer ''A'' now than did before. ''C'' is therefore a decoy whose sole purpose is to increase sales of ''A''.\n\nConversely, suppose that instead of ''C'', a player ''D'' is introduced that has less storage than both ''A'' and ''B'', and that is more expensive than ''B'' but not as expensive as ''A'':\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Consideration Set 3\n|-\n! !! A (competitor) !! B (target) !! D (decoy)\n|-\n! price\n| $400 || $300 || $350\n|-\n! storage\n| 30GB || 20GB || 15GB\n|}\n\nThe result here is similar: consumers will not prefer ''D'', because it is not as good as ''B'' in any respect. However, whereas ''C'' increased preference for ''A'', ''D'' has the opposite effect, increasing preference for ''B''.\n\nAnother example shown in Dan Ariely's book ''Predictably Irrational'' was a true case used by ''The Economist'' magazine.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=kApgNtTsAccC&pg=PT20 |title = Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces that Shape Our Decisions|isbn = 9780007319923|last1 = Ariely|first1 = Dan|date = 2009|at=Chapter 1|publisher=HarperCollins}}</ref> In a subscription screen is presented 3 options like below:\n\n# '''Economist.com subscription''' - US $59.00.

[[Kingdom of Spain|Spanish]] suppression of native revolts further reduced the population in northern Florida until the early 1600s, at which time the establishment of a series of [[Spanish missions in Florida|Spanish missions]] improved relations and stabilized the population.\n\nRaids from the newly-established English [[Province of Carolina]] beginning in the mid-1600s began another steep decline in the indigenous population. By 1707, English soldiers and their [[Yamasee|Yamasee Indian]] allies had killed, carried off, or driven away most of the remaining native inhabitants during a series of raids across the Florida panhandle and down the full length of the peninsula. In the first decade of the 18th century. 10,000\u201312,000 Indians were taken as slaves according to the governor of La Florida and by 1710, observers noted that north Florida was virtually depopulated. The Spanish missions all closed, as without natives, there was nothing for them to do. The few remaining natives fled west to [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] and beyond or east to the vicinity of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]. When Spain ceded Florida to [[Kingdom of Britain|Great Britain]] as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, the majority of surviving Florida Indians took passage with the Spanish to [[Cuba]] or [[New Spain]].<ref>{{Citation\n|last=Milanich\n|first=Jerald T.\n|year=1999\n|title=The Timucua\n|publisher=Blackwell Publishers\n|publication-place=Oxford, UK\n|isbn=0-631-21864-5\n|pages=209\u2013213}}<br>{{cite book|last=Milanich|first=Jerald T.|title=Laboring in the Fields of the Lord: Spanish Missions and Southeastern Indians|year=2006|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=0-8130-2966-X|pages=187\u20138, 191, 195}}<br>{{cite news|last=Horwitz|first=Tony|title=Apalachee Tribe, Missing for Centuries, Comes out of Hiding|url=http://www.weyanoke.org/doc/WSJ-ApalacheeTribe.doc|accessdate=23 October 2011|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=9 March 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106175341/http://www.weyanoke.org/doc/WSJ-ApalacheeTribe.doc|archive-date=6 November 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Origin of the Seminole====\nDuring the mid-1700s, small bands from various Native American tribes from the [[southeastern United States]] began moving into the unoccupied lands of Florida. In 1715, the [[Yamasee]] moved into Florida as allies of the Spanish, after conflicts with the English colonies.  [[Creek people]], at first primarily the [[Lower Creek]] but later including [[Upper Creek]], also started moving into Florida from the area of Georgia. The [[Mikasuki]], ''[[Hitchiti]]''-speakers, settled around what is now [[Lake Miccosukee]] near [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]]. (Descendants of this group have maintained a separate tribal identity as today's [[Miccosukee]].)\n\nAnother group of Hitchiti speakers, led by [[Cowkeeper]], settled in what is now [[Alachua County, Florida|Alachua County]], an area where the Spanish had maintained cattle ranches in the 17th century. Because one of the best-known ranches was called ''El Rancho de la Ch\u00faa'', the region became known as the \"[[Paynes Prairie|Alachua Prairie]]\". The Spanish in Saint Augustine began calling the Alachua Creek ''Cimarrones'', which roughly meant \"wild ones\" or \"runaways\". This was the probable origin of the term \"Seminole\".<ref>The Alachua Seminoles retained a separate identity at least through the Third Seminole War. Cowkeeper was succeeded by his nephew [[King Payne|Payne]] in 1784. Payne was killed in an attack on the Seminole by the Georgia militia in 1812. His brother [[Bolek|Billy Bowlegs]] (the first of that name) took most of the band to the Suwannee River. Disturbed by Andrew Jackson's campaign in 1818, the Alachua Seminole moved into central Florida. After the death of Bowlegs in 1821, his nephew [[Micanopy]] succeeded him. After he was captured and sent west, his nephew [[Billy Bowlegs]] (''Holata Micco'') led the remnants of the Seminole until his surrender in 1858. Weisman. pp. 22\u201324. Covington. p. 143.</ref><ref>[[Maroon (people)|Maroon]], the name for fugitive slaves in a number of locations throughout the [[Americas]], is also probably derived from the Spanish ''Cimarrones''.</ref>  This name was eventually applied to the other groups in Florida, although the Indians still regarded themselves as members of different tribes. Other Native American groups in Florida during the Seminole Wars included the [[Choctaw]], [[Yuchi]] or Spanish Indians, so called because it was believed that they were descended from [[Calusa]]s; and \"rancho Indians\", who lived at Spanish/Cuban fishing camps (ranchos) on the Florida coast.<ref>Missall. pp. 4\u20137, 128.<br>Knetsch. p. 13.<br>Buker. pp. 9\u201310.</ref>\n\nFugitive African and African-American slaves who could reach the fort were essentially free. Many were from Pensacola; some were free citizens though others had escaped from United States territory. The Spanish offered the slaves freedom and land in Florida; they recruited former slaves as militia to help defend Pensacola and [[Fort Mose Historic State Park|Fort Mos\u00e9]]. Other fugitive slaves joined Seminole bands as free members of the tribe.\n\nMost of the former slaves at Fort Mos\u00e9 went to Cuba with the Spanish when they left Florida in 1763, while others lived with or near various bands of Indians. Fugitive slaves from the Carolinas and Georgia continued to make their way to Florida, as the [[Underground Railway]] ran south. The blacks who stayed with or later joined the Seminoles became integrated into the tribes, learning the languages, adopting the dress, and inter-marrying. The blacks knew how to farm and served as interpreters between the Seminole and the whites. Some of the [[Black Seminoles]], as they were called, became important tribal leaders.<ref>Missall. pp. 10\u201312.</ref>\n\n===Early conflict===\nDuring the [[American Revolution]] (1775\u20131783), the British&mdash;who controlled Florida&mdash;recruited Seminoles to raid frontier settlements in Georgia. The confusion of war allowed more slaves to escape to Florida. The British promised slaves freedom for fighting with them. These events made the new United States enemies of the Seminoles. In 1783, as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|treaty]] ending the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], Florida was returned to Spain. Spain's grip on Florida was light, as it maintained only small [[garrison]]s at St. Augustine, [[St. Marks, Florida|St. Marks]] and [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]]. They did not control the border between Florida and the United States and were unable to act against the [[State of Muskogee]] established in 1799, envisioned as a single nation of American Indians independent of both Spain and the United States, until 1803 when both nations conspired to entrap its founder. Mikasukis and other Seminole groups still occupied towns on the United States side of the border, while American [[squatter]]s moved into Spanish Florida.<ref>Missall. pp. 12\u201313, 18</ref>\n\nThe British had divided Florida into [[East Florida]] and [[West Florida]] in 1763, a division retained by the Spanish when they regained Florida in 1783. West Florida extended from the [[Apalachicola River]] to the [[Mississippi River]]. Together with their possession of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]], the Spanish controlled the lower reaches of all of the rivers draining the United States west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. It prohibited the US from transport and trade on the lower Mississippi. In addition to its desire to expand west of the mountains, the United States wanted to acquire Florida. It wanted to gain free commerce on western rivers, and to prevent Florida from being used a base for possible invasion of the U.S. by a European country.<ref>Missall. pp. 13, 15\u201318.</ref>\n\n===The Louisiana Purchase===\nIn order to obtain a port on the Gulf of Mexico with secure access for Americans, United States diplomats in Europe were instructed to try to purchase the Isle of Orleans and West Florida from whichever country owned them. When [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert Livingston]] approached France in 1803 about buying the Isle of Orleans, the French government offered to sell it and all of Louisiana as well. While the purchase of Louisiana exceeded their authorization, Livingston and [[James Monroe]] (who had been sent to help him negotiate the sale) in the deliberations with France pursued a claim that the area east of the Mississippi to the [[Perdido River]] was part of Louisiana.  As part of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase treaty, France repeated verbatim Article 3 of its 1800 treaty with Spain, thus expressly subrogating the United States to the rights of France and Spain.<ref name=\"Curry\">{{cite journal|work=Magazine of American History|title=The Acquisition of Florida|first= J.

It was soon decided, however, that rather than paying for the colonies, the United States would offer to assume Spanish debts to American citizens{{refn|group=Note|American claims against Spain arose from the use of Spanish ports by French warships and privateers that had attacked American vessels during the [[Quasi-War]] of 1798\u20131800<ref>Stagg. p 43</ref>}} in return for Spain ceding the Floridas. The American position was that it was placing a lien on East Florida in lieu of seizing the colony to settle the debts.<ref>Stagg. p. 42\u201343</ref>\n\nIn 1808 Napoleon invaded Spain, forced [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], King of Spain, to abdicate, and installed his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]] as King. Resistance to the French invasion coalesced in a national government, the [[Cortes of C\u00e1diz]]. This government then entered into an alliance with Great Britain against France. This alliance raised fears in the United States that Britain would establish bases in or occupy Spanish colonies, including the Floridas, gravely compromising the security of the southern frontiers of the United States.<ref>Cusick. p. 14</ref>\n\n===West Florida===\n{{main|Republic of West Florida}}\n[[File:Westfloridaitsre00cham 0010.jpg|thumb|A 1903 map showing the territorial changes of \"West Florida\"]]\n\nBy 1810, during the [[Peninsular War]], Spain was largely overrun by the French army. Rebellions against the Spanish authorities broke out in many of its American colonies. Settlers in West Florida and in the adjacent [[Mississippi Territory]] started organizing in the summer of 1810 to seize Mobile and [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], the last of which was outside the part of West Florida claimed by the United States.\n\nResidents of westernmost West Florida (between the Mississippi and [[Pearl River (Mississippi\u2013Louisiana)|Pearl]] rivers) organized a convention at [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] in the summer of 1810. The convention was concerned about maintaining public order and preventing control of the district from falling into French hands; at first it tried to establish a government under local control that was nominally loyal to Ferdinand VII. After discovering that the Spanish governor of the district had appealed for military aid to put down an \"insurrection\", residents of the Baton Rouge District overthrew the local Spanish authorities on September 23 by seizing the Spanish fort in Baton Rouge. On September 26, the convention declared West Florida to be independent.<ref>Stagg. pp. 58\u201367</ref>\n\nPro-Spanish, pro-American, and pro-independence factions quickly formed in the newly proclaimed republic. The pro-American faction appealed to the United States to annex the area and to provide financial aid. On October 27, 1810, U.S. President [[James Madison]] proclaimed that the United States should take possession of West Florida between the Mississippi and Perdido Rivers, based on the tenuous claim that it was part of the Louisiana Purchase.<ref>[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=65912 \"Proclamation 16 \u2013 Taking Possession of Part of Louisiana (Annexation of West Florida)\"]</ref>\n\nMadison authorized [[William C. C. Claiborne]], governor of the [[Territory of Orleans]], to take possession of the territory. He entered the capital of St. Francisville with his forces on December 6, 1810, and [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] on December 10, 1810. The West Florida government opposed annexation, preferring to negotiate terms to join the Union. Governor [[Fulwar Skipwith]] proclaimed that he and his men would \"surround the Flag-Staff and die in its defense\".<ref name=\"Cox1912\">{{cite journal|title=The American Intervention in West Florida |first=Isaac Joslin |last= Cox| work=The American Historical Review|volume= 17| number= 2|date= Jan 1912|pages=290\u2013311|publisher= Oxford University Press on behalf of American Historical Association| jstor= 1833000 | doi = 10.1086/ahr/17.2.290 }}</ref>{{rp|308}}  Claiborne refused to recognize the legitimacy of the West Florida government, however, and Skipwith and the legislature eventually agreed to accept Madison's proclamation.

The United States would be authorized to either accept transfer of territory from \"local authorities\", or occupy territory to prevent it falling into the hands of a foreign power other than Spain.

Within several days the Patriots, along with a regiment of regular Army troops and Georgian volunteers, moved toward St. Augustine. On this march the Patriots were slightly in advance of the American troops. The Patriots would proclaim possession of some ground, raise the Patriot flag, and as the \"local authority\" surrender the territory to the United States troops, who would then substitute the American flag for the Patriot flag. The Patriots faced no opposition as they marched, usually with Gen. Mathews.<ref name=\"senate\"/> Accounts of witnesses state that the Patriots could have made no progress but for the protection of the U.S. forces and could not have maintained their position in the country without the aid of the U.S. troops. The American troops and Patriots acted in close concert, marching, camping, foraging and fighting together. In this way, the American troops sustained the Patriots,<ref name=\"senate\"/> who, however, were unable to take the [[Castillo de San Marcos]] in [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]. \n\nAs soon as the U.S. government was notified of these events, Congress became alarmed at the possibility of being drawn into war with Spain, and the effort fell apart. Secretary of State [[James Monroe]] promptly disavowed the actions and relieved Gen. Mathews of his commission on May 9, on the grounds that neither of the instructed contingencies had occurred.<ref name=\"Williams1837\"/> However, peace negotiations with the Spanish authorities were protracted and slow. Through the summer and autumn, the U.S. and Patriot troops foraged and plundered almost every plantation and farm, most of them having been abandoned by their owners. The troops helped themselves to everything they could find. Stored food was used up, growing crops destroyed or fed to horses, all types of movable property plundered or destroyed, buildings and fences burned, cattle and hogs killed or stolen for butchering, and slaves often dispersed or abducted. This continued until May 1813 and left the formerly inhabited parts in a state of desolation.<ref name=\"senate\"/>\n\nIn June 1812 George Mathews met with [[King Payne]] and other [[Seminole]] leaders. After the meeting, Mathews believed that the Seminoles would remain neutral in the conflict. [[Sebasti\u00e1n Kindel\u00e1n y O'Regan]], the governor of East Florida, tried to induce the Seminoles to fight on the Spanish side. Some of the Seminoles wanted to fight the Georgians in the Patriot Army, but King Payne and others held out for peace. The Seminoles were not happy with the Spanish, comparing their treatment under the Spanish unfavorably with that received from the British when they held Florida. [[Ahaya]], or Cowkeeper, King Payne's predecessor, had sworn to kill 100 Spaniards, and on his deathbed lamented having killed only 84. At a second conference with the Patriot Army leaders, the Seminoles again promised to remain neutral.<ref>Patrick. pp. 174, 176, 179\u201381.</ref>\n\nThe blacks living in Florida outside of St. Augustine, many of whom were former slaves from Georgia and South Carolina, were not disposed to be neutral. Often slaves in name only to Seminoles, they lived in freedom and feared loss of that freedom if the United States took Florida away from Spain. Many blacks enlisted in the defense of St. Augustine, while others urged the Seminoles to fight the Patriot Army. In a third meeting with Seminole leaders, the Patriot Army leaders threatened the Seminoles with destruction if they fought on the side of the Spanish. This threat gave the Seminoles favoring war, led by King Payne's brother [[Bolek]] (also known as Bowlegs) the upper hand. Joined by warriors from Alligator (near present-day [[Lake City, Florida|Lake City]]) and other towns, the Seminoles sent 200 Indians and 40 blacks to attack the Patriots.<ref>Patrick. pp. 183\u201385.</ref>\n\nIn retaliation for Seminole raids, in September 1812 Colonel [[Daniel Newnan]] led 117 Georgia militiamen in an attempt to seize the Alachua Seminole lands around [[Payne's Prairie]]. Newnan's force never reached the Seminole towns, losing eight men dead, eight missing, and nine wounded after battling Seminoles for more than a week. Four months later Lt. Colonel [[Thomas Adams Smith]] led 220 U.S. Army regulars and Tennessee volunteers in a raid on Payne's Town, the chief town of the Alachua Seminoles. Smith's force found a few Indians, but the Alachua Seminoles had abandoned Payne's Town and moved southward. After burning Payne's Town, Smith's force returned to American held territory.<ref>Patrick. pp. 184\u2013212, 230\u2013234.</ref><!-- Much of this paragraph was copied from my blog.

Harris petitioned the governor of Georgia for money, stating that a settlement of Americans in the Alachua Country would help keep the Seminoles away from the Georgia border, and would be able to intercept runaway slaves from Georgia before they could reach the Seminoles. Unfortunately for Harris, Georgia did not have funds available. Harris also hoped to acquire the land around the Alachua Prairie ([[Paynes Prairie]]) by treaty from the Seminoles, but could not persuade the Seminoles to meet with him. The Spanish were also not interested in dealing with Harris.<ref>Patrick. pp. 269\u201371, 277.</ref>\n\nIn January, 1814, 70 men led by Buckner Harris crossed from Georgia into East Florida, headed for the Alachua Country. More men joined them as they traveled through East Florida, with more than 90 in the group when they reached the site of Payne's Town, which had been burned in 1812. The men built a 25-foot square, two-story blockhouse, which they named Fort Mitchell, after [[David Brydie Mitchell|David Mitchell]], former governor of Georgia and a supporter of the Patriot invasion of East Florida.{{refn|group=Note|The location of the settlement at Fort Mitchell is disputed. Frederick Davis, based on its reported latitude, placed it east of present-day Ocala.<ref>Davis (January 1930). p. 145.</ref> Chris Monaco argues that the reported latitude was in error, and that other evidence supports a location on the south side of Paynes Prairie. The settlement was described as being next to a prairie \"7 or 8 miles wide and 20 long,\" which corresponds to the size of Payne's Prairie. Buckner Harris reported that the block house was \"on the Pirara, near Payne's former residence.\" Payne's Town, which had been the residence of King Payne until 1812, has been identified with an archaeological site about 1/2 mile from [[Micanopy, Florida|Micanopy]].<ref>Monaco. pp. 3\u20135.</ref>}} By the time the blockhouse was completed, there were reported to be more than 160 men present in Elotchaway. On January 25, 1814, the settlers established a government, titled \"The District of Elotchaway of the Republic of East Florida\", with Buckner Harris as Director. The Legislative Council then petitioned the United States Congress to accept the District of Elotchaway as a territory of the United States.<ref>Patrick, Pp. 279-80.</ref><ref>Monaco. pp. 11\u201312.</ref> The petition was signed by 106 \"citizens of Elotchaway.\" The Elotchaway settlers laid out farm plots and started planting crops.<ref>Patrick. p. 279.</ref><ref>Davis (January 1930). p. 155.</ref> Some of the men apparently had brought families with them, as a child was born in Elotchaway on March 15, 1814.<ref>Monaco. p. 12.</ref>\n\nBuckner Harris hoped to expand American settlement in the Alachua Country, and rode out alone to explore the area.

After his victory, Jackson forced the [[Treaty of Fort Jackson]] on the Creek, resulting in the loss of much Creek territory in what is today southern Georgia and central and southern Alabama. As a result, many Creek left Alabama and Georgia, and moved to Spanish West Florida. The Creek refugees joined the Seminole of Florida.<ref>Missall. pp. 21\u201322.</ref>\n\nIn 1814, Britain was still at [[War of 1812|war with the United States]], and saw merit in recruiting Indian allies. In May 1814, a British force entered the mouth of the Apalachicola River, and distributed arms to the Seminole and Creek warriors, and fugitive slaves. The British moved upriver and began building a fort at [[Fort Gadsden|Prospect Bluff]].<ref>Sugden, p.281</ref> A company of [[Royal Marines]], commanded by Lieutenant Colonel [[Edward Nicolls]], was to subsequently arrive, but was invited to relocate to Pensacola in late August 1814.<ref>Sugden, p.287</ref> It was estimated, by Captain Lockyer of {{HMS|Sophie|1809|6}}, that in August 1814 there were 1,000 Indians at Pensacola, of whom 700 were warriors.<ref>Sugden, p. 291</ref> Two months after the British and their Indian allies were beaten back from an attack on [[Fort Bowyer]] near [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], a US force led by General Jackson drove the British out of [[Battle of Pensacola (1814)|Pensacola]], and back to the Apalachicola River. They managed to continue work on the fort at Prospect Bluff.\n\nWhen the War of 1812 ended, all the British forces left the Gulf of Mexico except for Lieutenant Colonel Nicolls and his force in (neutral) Spanish West Florida. He directed the provisioning of the fort at Prospect Bluff with cannon, muskets, and ammunition. He told the Indians that the [[Treaty of Ghent]] guaranteed the return of all Indian lands lost during the War of 1812, including the Creek lands in Georgia and Alabama.<ref>Sugden, p. 306</ref> As the Seminole were not interested in holding a fort, they returned to their villages. Before Nicolls left in the spring of 1815, he turned the fort over to the fugitive slaves and Seminoles whom he had originally recruited for possible incursions into U.S. territory during the war. As word spread in the [[American Southeast]] about the fort, whites called it the \"[[Negro Fort]].\" The Americans worried that it would inspire their slaves to escape to Florida or revolt.<ref>Missall. pp. 24\u201327.</ref>\n\n[[File:EP Gaines.jpg|thumb|[[Edmund P.

Gaines directed Colonel [[Duncan Lamont Clinch]] to build [[Fort Scott (Flint River, Georgia)|Fort Scott]] on the [[Flint River (Georgia)|Flint River]] just north of the Florida border. Gaines said he intended to supply Fort Scott from New Orleans via the Apalachicola River. As this would mean passing through Spanish territory and past the Negro Fort, it would allow the U.S. Army to keep an eye on the Seminole and the Negro Fort. If the fort fired on the supply boats, the Americans would have an excuse to destroy it.<ref>Missall. pp. 27\u201328.</ref>\n\nIn July 1816, a supply fleet for Fort Scott reached the Apalachicola River.

The supply fleet met Clinch at the Negro Fort, and its two gunboats took positions across the river from the fort. The African Americans in the fort [[Battle of Negro Fort|fired]] their cannon at the white U.S. soldiers and the Creek, but had no training in aiming the weapon. The white Americans fired back. The gunboats' ninth shot, a \"[[Heated shot|hot shot]]\" (a cannonball heated to a red glow), landed in the fort's powder [[Magazine (artillery)|magazine]].

Chief [[Neamathla]] of Fowltown got into a dispute with the commander of Fort Scott over the use of land on the eastern side of the Flint River, essentially claiming Mikasuki sovereignty over the area. The land in southern Georgia had been ceded by the Creeks in the Treaty of Fort Jackson, but the Mikasukis did not consider themselves Creek, did not feel bound by the treaty which they had not signed, and did not accept that the Creeks had any right to cede Mikasuki land. In November 1817, General Gaines sent a force of 250 men to seize Fowltown. The first attempt was beaten off by the Mikasukis. The next day, November 22, 1817, the Mikasukis were driven from their village. Some historians date the start of the war to this attack on Fowltown. [[David Brydie Mitchell]], former governor of Georgia and Creek [[Indian agent]] at the time, stated in a report to [[United States Congress|Congress]] that the attack on Fowltown was the start of the First Seminole War.<ref>Missall.

On March 15, Jackson's army entered Florida, marching down the banks of the [[Apalachicola River]]. When they reached the site of the Negro Fort, Jackson had his men construct a new fort, [[Fort Gadsden]]. The army then set out for the Mikasuki villages around Lake Miccosukee. The Indian town of [[Anhaica]] (today's [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]]) was burned on March 31, and the town of [[Miccosukee, Florida|Miccosukee]] was taken the next day. More than 300 Indian homes were destroyed.

There he found [[Alexander George Arbuthnot]], a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] trader working out of the [[Bahamas]]. He traded with the Indians in Florida and had written letters to British and American officials on behalf of the Indians. He was rumored to be selling guns to the Indians and to be preparing them for war.

In the village, they found Elizabeth Stewart, the woman who had been captured in the attack on the supply boat on the [[Apalachicola River]] the previous November.

Ambrister threw himself on the mercy of the court, while Arbuthnot maintained his innocence, saying that he had only been engaged in legal trade. The tribunal sentenced both men to death but then relented and changed Ambrister's sentence to fifty lashes and a year at hard labor. Jackson, however, reinstated Ambrister's death penalty.

Jackson had first reported that all was peaceful and that he would be returning to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].\n\n====West Florida (west of the Apalachicola River)====\nGeneral Jackson later reported that Indians were gathering and being supplied by the Spanish, and he left Fort Gadsden with 1,000 men on May 7, headed for Pensacola. The governor of West Florida protested that most of the Indians at Pensacola were women and children and that the men were unarmed, but Jackson did not stop. When he reached Pensacola on May 23, the governor and the 175-man Spanish garrison retreated to [[Fort Barrancas]], leaving the city of Pensacola to Jackson. The two sides exchanged cannon fire for a couple of days, and then the Spanish surrendered Fort Barrancas on May 28. Jackson left Colonel [[William King (Governor of West Florida)|William King]] as military governor of West Florida and went home.<ref>Missall. pp. 42\u201343.</ref>\n\n===Consequences===\nThere were international repercussions to Jackson's actions. [[United States Department of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Quincy Adams]] had just started negotiations with Spain for the purchase of Florida. Spain protested the invasion and seizure of West Florida and suspended the negotiations. Spain did not have the means to retaliate against the United States or regain West Florida by force, so Adams let the Spanish officials protest, then issued a letter (with 72 supporting documents) blaming the war on the British, Spanish, and Indians. In the letter he also apologized for the seizure of West Florida, said that it had not been American policy to seize Spanish territory, and offered to give St. Marks and Pensacola back to Spain.\n\nSpain accepted and eventually resumed negotiations for the sale of Florida.<ref>Missall. pp. 46\u201347.</ref> Defending Jackson's actions as necessary, and sensing that they strengthened his diplomatic standing, Adams demanded Spain either control the inhabitants of East Florida or cede it to the United States. An agreement was then reached whereby [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|Spain ceded East Florida]] to the United States and renounced all claim to West.<ref>[https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/jd/16320.htm Acquisition of Florida: Treaty of Adams-Onis (1819) and Transcontinental Treaty (1821)<!-- Bot generated title -->] </ref>\n\nBritain protested the execution of two of its subjects who had never entered United States territory. There was talk in Britain of demanding reparations and taking reprisals. Americans worried about another war with Britain. In the end Britain, realizing how important the United States was to its economy, opted for maintaining good relations.<ref>Missall. p. 45.</ref>\n\nThere were also repercussions in America. Congressional committees held hearings into the irregularities of the Ambrister and Arbuthnot trials. While most Americans supported Jackson, some worried that Jackson could become a \"man on horseback\", a [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], and transform the United States into a military dictatorship. When Congress reconvened in December 1818, resolutions were introduced condemning Jackson's actions. Jackson was too popular, and the resolutions failed, but the Ambrister and Arbuthnot executions left a stain on his reputation for the rest of his life, although it was not enough to keep him from becoming President.<ref>Missall. pp. 44, 47\u201350.</ref>\n\n==First Interbellum==\nSpain ceded Florida to the United States in 1819 with the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]], and the United States took possession in 1821. Effective government was slow in coming to Florida. General Andrew Jackson was appointed military governor in March 1821, but he did not arrive in Pensacola until July. He resigned the post in September and returned home in October, having spent just three months in Florida. His successor, [[William Pope Duval|William P. Duval]], was not appointed until April 1822, and he left for an extended visit to his home in [[Kentucky]] before the end of the year. Other official positions in the territory had similar turn-over and absences.<ref>Missall. pp. 53\u201361.</ref>\n\nThe Seminoles were still a problem for the new government. In early 1822, Capt. John R. Bell, provisional secretary of the Florida territory and temporary agent to the Seminoles, prepared an estimate of the number of Indians in Florida. He reported about 22,000 Indians, and 5,000 slaves held by Indians. He estimated that two-thirds of them were refugees from the [[Creek War]], with no valid claim (in the U.S. view) to Florida. Indian settlements were located in the areas around the Apalachicola River, along the [[Suwannee River]], from there south-eastwards to the Alachua Prairie, and then south-westward to a little north of [[Tampa Bay]].<ref>Missall. p. 55.</ref>\n\nOfficials in Florida were concerned from the beginning about the situation with the Seminoles. Until a treaty was signed establishing a reservation, the Indians were not sure of where they could plant crops and expect to be able to harvest them, and they had to contend with white squatters moving into land they occupied. There was no system for licensing traders, and unlicensed traders were supplying the Seminoles with [[Distilled beverage|liquor]]. However, because of the part-time presence and frequent turnover of territorial officials, meetings with the Seminoles were canceled, postponed, or sometimes held merely to set a time and place for a new meeting.<ref>Missall. pp. 58\u201362.</ref>\n\n===Treaty of Moultrie Creek===\n{{main|Treaty of Moultrie Creek}}\n[[File:Moultriecreekreservation.PNG|thumb|250px|The [[Treaty of Moultrie Creek]] provided for a reservation in central Florida for the Seminoles.]]\n\nIn 1823, the government decided to settle the Seminole on a reservation in the central part of the territory. A meeting to negotiate a treaty was scheduled for early September 1823 at Moultrie Creek, south of St. Augustine. About 425 Seminole attended the meeting, choosing ''Neamathla'' to be their chief representative or Speaker. Under the terms of the treaty negotiated there, the Seminole were forced to go under the protection of the United States and give up all claim to lands in Florida, in exchange for a reservation of about four million acres (16,000&nbsp;km\u00b2). The reservation would run down the middle of the Florida peninsula from just north of present-day [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]] to a line even with the southern end of Tampa Bay. The boundaries were well inland from both coasts, to prevent contact with traders from [[Cuba]] and the [[Bahamas]]. Neamathla and five other chiefs were allowed to keep their villages along the [[Apalachicola River]].<ref>Missall. pp. 63\u2013-64.</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Treaty of Moultrie Creek]], the US was obligated to protect the Seminole as long as they remained law-abiding. The government was supposed to distribute farm implements, cattle and hogs to the Seminole, compensate them for travel and losses involved in relocating to the reservation, and provide rations for a year, until the Seminoles could plant and harvest new crops. The government was also supposed to pay the tribe US$5,000 per year for twenty years and provide an interpreter, a school and a blacksmith for twenty years. In turn, the Seminole had to allow roads to be built across the reservation and had to apprehend and return to US jurisdiction any runaway slaves or other fugitives.<ref>Missall. pp. 64\u201365.</ref>\n\n[[File:Fortbrooke.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Barracks and tents at [[Fort Brooke]] near [[Tampa Bay]]]]\n\nImplementation of the treaty stalled. [[Fort Brooke]], with four companies of infantry, was established on the site of present-day [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] in early 1824, to show the Seminole that the government was serious about moving them onto the reservation. However, by June [[James Gadsden]], who was the principal author of the treaty and charged with implementing it, was reporting that the Seminole were unhappy with the treaty and were hoping to renegotiate it. Fear of a new war crept in. In July, Governor DuVal mobilized the militia and ordered the [[Tallahassee]] and [[Miccosukee]] chiefs to meet him in St. Marks. At that meeting, he ordered the Seminole to move to the reservation by October 1, 1824.<ref>Missall. pp. 69\u201371.</ref>\n\nThe move had not begun, but DuVal began paying the Seminole compensation for the improvements they were having to leave as an incentive to move. He also had the promised rations sent to Fort Brooke on Tampa Bay for distribution. The Seminole finally began moving onto the reservation, but within a year some returned to their former homes between the Suwannee and Apalachicola rivers. By 1826, most of the Seminole had gone to the reservation, but were not thriving. They had to clear and plant new fields, and cultivated fields suffered in a long drought. Some of the tribe were reported to have starved to death. Both Col. George M. Brooke, commander of Fort Brooke, and Governor DuVal wrote to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] seeking help for the starving Seminole, but the requests got caught up in a debate over whether the people should be moved to west of the Mississippi River. For five months, no additional relief reached the Seminole.<ref>Missall. pp. 71\u201373.</ref>\n\n[[File:Seminolevillage.jpg|thumb|250px|View of a Seminole village shows the log cabins they lived in prior to the disruptions of the Second Seminole War]]\n\nThe Seminoles slowly settled into the reservation, although they had isolated clashes with whites. [[Fort King]] was built near the reservation agency, at the site of present-day Ocala, and by early 1827 the Army could report that the Seminoles were on the reservation and Florida was peaceful. During the five-year peace, some settlers continued to call for removal. The Seminole were opposed to any such move, and especially to the suggestion that they join their [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]] relations. Most whites regarded the Seminole as simply Creeks who had recently moved to Florida, while the Seminole claimed Florida as their home and denied that they had any connection with the Creeks.<ref>Missall. pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nThe Seminole and slave catchers argued over the ownership of slaves. New plantations in Florida increased the pool of slaves who could escape to Seminole territory. Worried about the possibility of an Indian uprising and/or a slave rebellion, Governor DuVal requested additional Federal troops for Florida, but in 1828 the US closed Fort King. Short of food and finding the hunting declining on the reservation, the Seminole wandered off to get food. In 1828, Andrew Jackson, the old enemy of the Seminoles, was elected [[President of the United States]]. In 1830, Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]] he promoted, which was to resolve the problems by moving the Seminole and other tribes west of the Mississippi.<ref>Missall. pp. 78\u201380.</ref>\n\n===Treaty of Payne's Landing===\n{{main|Treaty of Payne's Landing}}\nIn the spring of 1832, the Seminoles on the reservation were called to a meeting at Payne's Landing on the [[Oklawaha River]]. The treaty negotiated there called for the Seminoles to move west, if the land were found to be suitable. They were to settle on the Creek reservation and become part of the Creek tribe. The delegation of seven chiefs who were to inspect the new reservation did not leave Florida until October 1832. After touring the area for several months and conferring with the Creeks who had already been settled there, the seven chiefs signed a statement on March 28, 1833, that the new land was acceptable. Upon their return to Florida, however, most of the chiefs renounced the statement, claiming that they had not signed it, or that they had been forced to sign it, and in any case, that they did not have the power to decide for all the tribes and bands that resided on the reservation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seminolenationmuseum.org/history/seminole-nation/the-seminole-wars/|title=The Seminole Wars \u2013 Seminole Nation Museum|website=www.seminolenationmuseum.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-03}}</ref> The villages in the area of the Apalachicola River were more easily persuaded, however, and went west in 1834.<ref>Missall. pp. 83\u201385.</ref>\n\n[[File:Osceola.jpg|thumb|left|[[Osceola]], Seminole leader]]\n\nThe [[United States Senate]] finally ratified the [[Treaty of Payne's Landing]] in April 1834. The treaty had given the Seminoles three years to move west of the Mississippi. The government interpreted the three years as starting 1832 and expected the Seminoles to move in 1835. Fort King was reopened in 1834. A new Seminole agent, Wiley Thompson, had been appointed in 1834, and the task of persuading the Seminoles to move fell to him. He called the chiefs together at Fort King in October 1834 to talk to them about the removal to the west. The Seminoles informed Thompson that they had no intention of moving and that they did not feel bound by the Treaty of Payne's Landing. Thompson then requested reinforcements for Fort King and Fort Brooke, reporting that, \"the Indians after they had received the Annuity, purchased an unusually large quantity of Powder & Lead.\" General Clinch also warned Washington that the Seminoles did not intend to move and that more troops would be needed to force them to move. In March 1835, Thompson called the chiefs together to read a letter from Andrew Jackson to them. In his letter, Jackson said, \"Should you ... refuse to move, I have then directed the Commanding officer to remove you by force.\" The chiefs asked for thirty days to respond. A month later, the Seminole chiefs told Thompson that they would not move west. Thompson and the chiefs began arguing, and General Clinch had to intervene to prevent bloodshed. Eventually, eight of the chiefs agreed to move west but asked to delay the move until the end of the year, and Thompson and Clinch agreed.<ref>Missall. pp. 86\u201390.</ref>\n\nFive of the most important of the Seminole chiefs, including [[Micanopy]] of the Alachua Seminoles, had not agreed to the move. In retaliation, Thompson declared that those chiefs were removed from their positions. As relations with the Seminoles deteriorated, Thompson forbade the sale of guns and ammunition to the Seminoles. [[Osceola]], a young warrior beginning to be noticed by the whites, was particularly upset by the ban, feeling that it equated Seminoles with slaves and said, \"The white man shall not make me black. I will make the white man red with blood; and then blacken him in the sun and rain ... and the buzzard live upon his flesh.\" In spite of this, Thompson considered Osceola to be a friend and gave him a rifle. Later, though, when Osceola was causing trouble, Thompson had him locked up at Fort King for a night. The next day, in order to secure his release, Osceola agreed to abide by the Treaty of Payne's Landing and to bring his followers in.<ref>Missall. pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nThe situation grew worse. On June 19, 1835, a group of whites searching for lost cattle found a group of Indians sitting around a campfire cooking the remains of what they claimed was one of their herd. The whites disarmed and proceeded to whip the Indians, when two more arrived and opened fire on the whites. Three whites were wounded and one Indian was killed and one wounded, at what became known as the skirmish at Hickory Sink. After complaining to Indian Agent Thompson and not receiving a satisfactory response, the Seminoles became further convinced that they would not receive fair compensations for their complaints of hostile treatment by the settlers. Believed to be in response for the incident at Hickory Sink, in August 1835, Private Kinsley Dalton (for whom [[Dalton, Georgia]], is named) was killed by Seminoles as he was carrying the mail from Fort Brooke to Fort King.<ref>Tebeau. p. 158</ref>\n\nIn November 1835 Chief Charley Emathla, wanting no part of a war, agreed to removal and sold his cattle at Fort King in preparation for moving his people to Fort Brooke to emigrate to the west. This act was considered a betrayal by other Seminoles who months earlier declared in council that any Seminole chief who sold his cattle would be sentenced to death. Osceola met Charley Emathla on the trail back to his village and killed him, scattering the money from the cattle purchase across his body.<ref>Missall. pp. 91\u201392.</ref>\n\n==Second Seminole War==<!-- This section is linked from [[Miami, Florida]] -->\n{{Main|Second Seminole War}}\n[[File:Seminolesmassacreingwhites.jpg|thumb|Woodcut from ''A true and authentic account of the Indian war in Florida ... '' (1836)]]\n\nAs Florida officials realized the Seminole would resist relocation, preparations for war began. Settlers fled to safety as Seminole attacked plantations and a militia wagon train. Two companies totaling 110 men under the command of Major [[Francis L. Dade]] were sent from Fort Brooke to reinforce Fort King in mid-December 1835. On the morning of December 28, the train of troops was ambushed by a group of Seminole warriors under the command of Alligator near modern-day [[Bushnell, Florida]]. The entire command and their small cannon was destroyed, with only two badly wounded soldiers surviving to return to Fort Brooke. Over the next few months Generals [[Duncan Lamont Clinch|Clinch]], [[Edmund P. Gaines|Gaines]] and [[Winfield Scott]], as well as territorial governor [[Richard Keith Call]], led large numbers of troops in futile pursuits of the Seminoles. In the meantime the Seminoles struck throughout the state, attacking isolated farms, settlements, plantations and Army forts, even burning the [[Cape Florida Light|Cape Florida lighthouse]]. Supply problems and a high rate of illness during the summer caused the Army to abandon several forts.<ref>Missall. Pp. 94-121.</ref>\n\nOn Dec. 28, 1835 Major Benjamine A. Putnam with a force of soldiers occupied the [[Bulow Plantation Ruins Historic State Park|Bulow Plantation]] and fortified it with cotton bales and a stockade. Local planters took refuge with their slaves. The Major abandoned the site on January 23, 1836, and the [[Bulow Plantation Ruins Historic State Park|Bulow Plantation]] was later burned by the Seminoles. Now a State Park, the site remains a window into the destruction of the conflict; the massive stone ruins of the huge Bulow sugar mill stand little changed from the 1830s. By February 1836 the Seminole and black allies had attacked 21 plantations along the river.\n\nMajor [[Ethan A. Hitchcock (general)|Ethan Allen Hitchcock]] was among those who found the remains of the Dade party in February. In his journal he wrote of the discovery and expressed his discontent:\n\n<blockquote>The government is in the wrong, and this is the chief cause of the persevering opposition of the Indians, who have nobly defended their country against our attempt to enforce a fraudulent treaty. The natives used every means to avoid a war, but were forced into it by the tyranny of our government.<ref>Hitchcock. pp.120\u2013131.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn November 21, 1836 at the [[Battle of Wahoo Swamp]], the Seminole fought against American allied forces numbering 2500, successfully driving them back.; among the American dead was [[David Moniac]], the first Native American graduate of [[West Point]]. The skirmish restored Seminole confidence, showing their ability to hold their ground against their old enemies the Creek and white settlers.\n\nLate in 1836, Major General [[Thomas Jesup]], US Quartermaster, was placed in command of the war. Jesup brought a new approach to the war. He concentrated on wearing the Seminoles down rather than sending out large groups who were more easily ambushed. He needed a large military presence in the state to control it, and he eventually brought a force of more than 9,000 men into the state under his command. About half of the force were volunteers and militia. It also included a brigade of Marines, and Navy and [[United States Revenue Cutter Service|Revenue-Marine]] personnel patrolling the coast and inland rivers and streams.<ref>Missall. pp. 122\u2013125.</ref>\n[[Image:Osceolaseized.jpg|thumb|300|Osceola was seized at the orders of Gen. [[Thomas Jesup]] when he appeared for a meeting under a white peace or \"parley\" flag.]]\n\nIn January 1837, the Army began to achieve more tangible successes, capturing or killing numerous Indians and blacks. At the end of January, some Seminole chiefs sent messengers to Jesup, and arranged a truce. In March a \"Capitulation\" was signed by several chiefs, including Micanopy, stipulating that the Seminole could be accompanied by their allies and \"their negroes, their ''bona fide'' property\", in their removal to the West. By the end of May, many chiefs, including Micanopy, had surrendered. Two important leaders, Osceola and [[Ar-pi-uck-i (Sam Jones)|Sam Jones]] (a.k.a. Abiaca, Ar-pi-uck-i, Opoica, Arpeika, Aripeka, Aripeika), had not surrendered, however, and were known to be vehemently opposed to relocation. On June 2 these two leaders with about 200 followers entered the poorly guarded holding camp at Fort Brooke and led away the 700 Seminoles who had surrendered. The war was on again, and Jesup decided against trusting the word of an Indian again. On Jesup's orders, Brigadier General [[Joseph Marion Hern\u00e1ndez]] commanded an expedition that captured several Indian leaders, including [[Wild Cat (Seminole)|Coacoochee]] (Wild Cat), [[John Horse]], Osceola and Micanopy when they appeared for conferences under a [[white flag]] of truce. Coacoochee and other captives, including John Horse, escaped from their cell at [[Fort Marion]] in St. Augustine,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Phillip Thomas|title=John Horse: Forgotten African-American Leader of the Second Seminole War|journal=The Journal of Negro History|year=1992|volume=77|issue=2 (Spring)|pages=74\u201383|doi=10.2307/3031484|jstor=3031484}}</ref> but Osceola did not go with them. He died in prison, probably of [[malaria]].<ref>Missall. pp. 126\u2013134, 140\u2013141.</ref>\n\nJesup organized a sweep down the peninsula with multiple columns, pushing the Seminoles further south. On Christmas Day 1837, Colonel [[Zachary Taylor]]'s column of 800 men encountered a body of about 400 warriors on the north shore of [[Lake Okeechobee]]. The Seminole were led by Sam Jones, Alligator and the recently escaped Coacoochee; they were well positioned in a [[Hammock (ecology)|hammock]] surrounded by [[Cladium|sawgrass]] with half a mile of swamp in front of it. On the far side of the hammock was Lake Okeechobee. Here the saw grass stood five feet high. The mud and water were three feet deep. Horses would be of no use. The Seminole had chosen their battleground. They had sliced the grass to provide an open field of fire and had notched the trees to steady their rifles. Their scouts were perched in the treetops to follow every movement of the troops coming up. As Taylor's army came up to this position, he decided to attack.\n\nAt about half past noon, with the sun shining directly overhead and the air still and quiet, Taylor moved his troops squarely into the center of the swamp. His plan was to attack directly rather than try to encircle the Indians. All his men were on foot. In the first line were the Missouri volunteers. As soon as they came within range, the Seminoles opened fire. The volunteers broke, and their commander Colonel Gentry, fatally wounded, was unable to rally them. They fled back across the swamp. The fighting in the saw grass was deadliest for five companies of the Sixth Infantry; every officer but one, and most of their noncoms, were killed or wounded. When those units retired a short distance to re-form, they found only four men of these companies unharmed. The US eventually drove the Seminoles from the hammock, but they escaped across the lake. Taylor lost 26 killed and 112 wounded, while the Seminoles casualties were eleven dead and fourteen wounded. The US claimed the [[Battle of Lake Okeechobee]] as a great victory.<ref>Mahon. P. 228.</ref><ref>Missall. pp. 138\u2013139, 142\u2013143.</ref>\n\nAt the end of January, Jesup's troops caught up with a large body of Seminoles to the east of Lake Okeechobee. Originally positioned in a hammock, the Seminoles were driven across a wide stream by cannon and rocket fire, and made another stand. They faded away, having inflicted more casualties than they suffered, and the [[Battle of Loxahatchee]] was over. In February 1838, the Seminole chiefs Tuskegee and Halleck Hadjo approached Jesup with the proposal to stop fighting if they could stay in the area south of Lake Okeechobee, rather than relocating west. Jesup favored the idea but had to gain approval from officials in Washington for approval. The chiefs and their followers camped near the Army while awaiting the reply. When the secretary of war rejected the idea, Jesup seized the 500 Indians in the camp, and had them transported to the Indian Territory.<ref>Missall. pp. 144\u2013147, 151.</ref>\n\nIn May, Jesup's request to be relieved of command was granted, and [[Zachary Taylor]] assumed command of the Army in Florida. With reduced forces, Taylor concentrated on keeping the Seminole out of northern Florida by building many small posts at twenty-mile (30&nbsp;km) intervals across the peninsula, connected by a grid of roads. The winter season was fairly quiet, without major actions. In Washington and around the country, support for the war was eroding. Many people began to think the Seminoles had earned the right to stay in Florida. Far from being over, the war had become very costly. President [[Martin Van Buren]] sent the Commanding General of the Army, [[Alexander Macomb (general)|Alexander Macomb]], to negotiate a new treaty with the Seminoles. On May 19, 1839, Macomb announced an agreement. In exchange for a reservation in southern Florida, the Seminoles would stop fighting.<ref>Missall. pp. 152, 157\u2013164.</ref>\n\n[[File:Seminole War in Everglades.jpg|thumb|250px|[[U.S. Marine]]s searching for the Indians during the Seminole War]]\n\nAs the summer passed, the agreement seemed to be holding. However, on July 23, some 150 Indians attacked a trading post on the [[Caloosahatchee River]]; it was guarded by a detachment of 23 soldiers under the command of Colonel [[William S. Harney]]. He and some soldiers escaped by the river, but the Seminoles killed most of the garrison, as well as several civilians at the post. Many blamed the \"Spanish\" Indians, led by Chakaika, for the attack, but others suspected Sam Jones, whose band of Mikasuki had agreed to the treaty with Macomb. Jones, when questioned, promised to turn the men responsible for the attack over to Harney in 33 days. Before that time was up, two soldiers visiting Jones' camp were killed.<ref>Missall. pp. 165\u2013168.</ref>\n\nThe Army turned to [[bloodhound]]s to track the Indians, with poor results. Taylor's blockhouse and patrol system in northern Florida kept the Seminoles on the move but could not clear them out. In May 1839, Taylor, having served longer than any preceding commander in the Florida war, was granted his request for a transfer and replaced by Brig. Gen. [[Walker Keith Armistead]]. Armistead immediately went on the offensive, actively campaigning during the summer. Seeking hidden camps, the Army also burned fields and drove off livestock: horses, cattle and pigs. By the middle of the summer, the Army had destroyed {{convert|500|acre|km2}} of Seminole crops.<ref>Missall. pp. 169\u2013181, 182\u20134.</ref><ref>Covington. pp. 98\u201399.</ref>\n\nThe Navy sent its sailors and Marines up rivers and streams, and into the [[Everglades]]. In late 1839 Navy Lt. John T. McLaughlin was given command of a joint Army-Navy amphibious force to operate in Florida. McLaughlin established his base at [[Tea Table Key]] in the upper [[Florida Keys]]. Traveling from December 1840 to the middle of January 1841, McLaughlin's force crossed the Everglades from east to west in dugout canoes, the first group of whites to complete a crossing.<ref>Buker. pp. 99\u2013101.</ref><ref>Mahon. p. 289.</ref> The Seminoles kept out of their way.\n\n===Indian Key===\n[[Indian Key State Historic Site|Indian Key]] is a small island in the upper [[Florida Keys]]. In 1840, it was the [[county seat]] of the newly created [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]], and a [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|wrecking]] port. Early in the morning of August 7, 1840, a large party of \"Spanish\" Indians sneaked onto Indian Key. By chance, one man was up and raised the alarm after spotting the Indians. Of about fifty people living on the island, forty were able to escape. The dead included Dr. [[Henry Perrine]], former United States [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] in [[Campeche, Campeche|Campeche]], [[Mexico]], who was waiting at Indian Key until it was safe to take up a 36-square mile (93&nbsp;km\u00b2) grant on the mainland that Congress had awarded to him.\n\nThe naval base on the Key was manned by a doctor, his patients, and five sailors under a midshipman. They mounted a couple of cannon on barges to attack the Indians. The Indians fired back at the sailors with musket balls loaded in cannon on the shore. The recoil of the cannon broke them loose from the barges, sending them into the water, and the sailors had to retreat. The Indians looted and burned the buildings on Indian Key. In December 1840, Col. Harney at the head of ninety men found Chakaika's camp deep in the Everglades. His force killed the chief and hanged some of the men in his band.<ref>Buker. pp. 106\u2013107.</ref><ref>Viele. pp. 33\u201335.</ref><ref>Mahon. pp. 283\u20134.</ref>\n\n===War winds down===\nArmistead received US$55,000 to use for bribing chiefs to surrender. Echo Emathla, a Tallahassee chief, surrendered, but most of the Tallahassee, under Tiger Tail, did not. Coosa Tustenuggee finally accepted US$5,000 for bringing in his 60 people. Lesser chiefs received US$200, and every warrior got US$30 and a rifle. By the spring of 1841, Armistead had sent 450 Seminoles west. Another 236 were at Fort Brooke awaiting transportation. Armistead estimated that 120 warriors had been shipped west during his tenure and that no more than 300 warriors remained in Florida.<ref>Mahon. pp. 282, 285\u20137.</ref>\n\n[[File:1842seminolereservation.png|thumb|250px|The remaining Seminoles in Florida were allowed to stay on an informal reservation in southwest Florida at the end of the Second Seminole War in 1842.]]\n\nIn May 1841, Armistead was replaced by Col. [[William Jenkins Worth]] as commander of Army forces in Florida. Worth had to cut back on the unpopular war: he released nearly 1,000 civilian employees and consolidated commands. Worth ordered his men out on \"search and destroy\" missions during the summer, and drove the Seminoles out of much of northern Florida.<ref>Knetsch. Pp. 128-131.<br>Mahon. P. 298.</ref>\n\nThe Army's actions became a war of attrition; some Seminole surrendered to avoid starvation. Others were seized when they came in to negotiate surrender, including, for the second time, Coacoochee. A large bribe secured Coacoochee's cooperation in persuading others to surrender.<ref>Mahon. pp. 298\u2013300.</ref><ref>Covington. pp. 103\u20136.</ref>\n\nIn the last action of the war, General William Bailey and prominent planter Jack Bellamy led a posse of 52 men on a three-day pursuit of a small band of Tiger Tail's braves who had been attacking settlers, surprising their swampy encampment and killing all 24. William Wesley Hankins, at sixteen the youngest of the posse, accounted for the last of the kills and was acknowledged as having fired the last shot of the Second Seminole War.<ref>D.B.

Pp. 107-7.</ref> He announced it on August 14, 1842. In the same month, Congress passed the Armed Occupation Act, which provided free land to settlers who improved the land and were prepared to defend themselves from Indians. At the end of 1842, the remaining Indians in Florida living outside the reservation in southwest Florida were rounded up and shipped west. By April 1843, the Army presence in Florida had been reduced to one regiment. By November 1843, Worth reported that only about 95 Seminole men and some 200 women and children living on the reservation were left, and that they were no longer a threat.<ref>Mahon. pp. 313\u20134, 316\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nThe Second Seminole War may have cost as much as $40,000,000. More than 40,000 regular U.S. military, militiamen and volunteers served in the war. This Indian war cost the lives of 1,500 soldiers, mostly from disease. It is estimated that more than 300 regular U.S. Army, Navy and Marine Corps personnel were killed in action, along with 55 volunteers.<ref>Kohn, George Childs: ''Dictionary of Wars: Third Edition'' (p. 486)</ref> There is no record of the number of Seminole killed in action, but many homes and Indian lives were lost. A great many Seminole died of disease or starvation in Florida, on the journey west, and after they reached [[Indian Territory]]. An unknown but apparently substantial number of white civilians were killed by Seminole during the war.<ref>Mahon. pp. 321, 323, 325.<br>Missall. pp. 177, 204\u2013205.<br>Florida Board of State Institutions. P. 9.</ref>\n\n==Second Interbellum==\n[[File:Billy bowlegs harpers.jpg|thumb|[[Billy Bowlegs]], 1858]]\n\nPeace had come to Florida. The Indians were mostly staying on the reservation. Groups of ten or so men would visit Tampa to trade. Squatters were moving closer to the reservation, however, and in 1845 President [[James Polk]] established a {{convert|20|mi|km|adj=on}} wide buffer zone around the reservation. No land could be claimed within the buffer zone, no title would be issued for land there, and the [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] would remove squatters from the buffer zone upon request. In 1845, Thomas P. Kennedy, who operated a store at Fort Brooke, converted his fishing station on [[Pine Island (Lee County, Florida)|Pine Island]] into a trading post for the Indians. The post did not do well, however, because whites who sold whiskey to the Indians told them that they would be seized and sent west if they went to Kennedy's store.<ref>Covington. pp. 110\u20131.</ref>\n\nThe Florida authorities continued to press for removal of all Indians from Florida. The Indians for their part tried to limit their contacts with whites as much as possible. In 1846, Captain John T. Sprague was placed in charge of Indian affairs in Florida. He had great difficulty in getting the chiefs to meet with him. They were very distrustful of the Army since it had often seized chiefs while under a flag of truce. He did manage to meet with all of the chiefs in 1847, while investigating a report of a raid on a farm. He reported that the Indians in Florida then consisted of 120 warriors, including seventy Seminoles in [[Billy Bowlegs]]' band, thirty Mikasukis in Sam Jones' band, twelve Creeks (Muscogee speakers) in Chipco's band, 4 Yuchis and 4 Choctaws. He also estimated that there were 100 women and 140 children.<ref>Covington. pp. 112\u20134.</ref>\n\n===Indian attacks===\nThe trading post on Pine Island had burned down in 1848, and in 1849 Thomas Kennedy and his new partner, John Darling, were given permission to open a trading post on what is now [[Paynes Creek Historic State Park|Paynes Creek]], a tributary of the [[Peace River (Florida)|Peace River]]. One band of Indians was living outside the reservation at this time. Called \"outsiders\", it consisted of twenty warriors under the leadership of Chipco, and included five Muscogees, seven Mikasukis, six Seminoles, one Creek and one Yuchi. On July 12, 1849 four members of this band attacked a farm on the [[Indian River (Florida)|Indian River]] just north of Fort Pierce, killing one man and wounding another man and a woman. The news of this raid caused much of the population of the east coast of Florida to flee to St. Augustine. On July 17, four of the \"outsiders\" who had attacked the farm on the Indian River, plus a fifth man who had not been at Indian River, attacked the Kennedy and Darling store. Two workers at the store, including a Captain Payne, were killed, and another worker and his wife were wounded as they escorted their child into hiding.<ref>Covington. pp. 114\u20136.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Army was not prepared to engage the Indians. It had few men stationed in Florida and no means to move them quickly to where they could protect the white settlers and capture the Indians. The War Department began a new buildup in Florida, placing Major General [[David E. Twiggs]] in command, and the state called up two companies of mounted volunteers to guard settlements. Captain John Casey, who was in charge of the effort to move the Indians west, was able to arrange a meeting between General Twiggs and several of the Indian leaders at Charlotte Harbor. At that meeting, Billy Bowlegs promised, with the approval of other leaders, to deliver the five men responsible for the attacks to the Army within thirty days. On October 18, Bowlegs delivered three of the men to Twiggs, along with the severed hand of another who had been killed while trying to escape. The fifth man had been captured but had escaped.<ref>Covington. pp. 116\u20138.</ref>\n\nAfter Bowlegs had delivered the three murderers, General Twiggs told the Indians, much to their dismay, that he had been ordered to remove them from Florida. The government would apply three tactics to carry out the removal. The Army in Florida was increased to 1,500 men. One hundred thousand dollars was appropriated for bribing Indians to move. Finally, a delegation of Seminole chiefs was brought from the Indian Territory to negotiate with their counterparts in Florida. Eventually a Mikasuki sub-chief, Kapiktoosootse, agreed to lead his people west. In February 1850, 74 Indians boarded ship for [[New Orleans]]. They were paid a total of US$15,953 in bribes and compensation for property left behind in Florida. There were a couple of incidents that soured relations after that. A Muskogee and a Mikasuki who had gone in to trade at the same time as Kapiktoosootse and his band were surrendering were involuntarily shipped off to New Orleans with them. Then, in March a mounted detachment of the Seventh Infantry penetrated far in the reservation. As a result, the other Indians broke off contact with the negotiators. By April, Twiggs was reporting to Washington that there was no hope of convincing any more Indians to move.<ref>Covington. pp. 118\u201321.</ref>\n\nIn August 1850, an orphan boy living on a farm in north central Florida was apparently killed by Indians. Eventually enough complaints about the incident had reached Washington to cause the secretary of war to order the surrender of the Indians responsible, or the president would hold the whole tribe responsible. Captain Casey was able to get word to Bowlegs and arrange a meeting in April. Bowlegs promised to deliver the men responsible, although they apparently were members of Chipco's band, over whom Bowlegs had no authority. Chipco decided to surrender three men as the possible killers, and they were arrested when they showed up to trade in Fort Myers. Once in custody, the three protested their innocence, saying that Chipco did not like them and that other men in Chipco's band were the actual killers, and Captain Casey believed them. The three men tried to escape from the jail in Tampa but were caught and chained up in their cell. They were later found hanging from the bars in their cell. One was still alive when found but was not cut down until the next day, after he had died. It was noted in the community that the constable who had chained the three men in their cell was the father-in-law of a brother of one of the men killed at the Kennedy and Darling store in 1849 (the Paynes Creek Massacre).<ref>Covington. pp. 122-3.</ref>\n\n===Further Indian removal===\nIn 1851, General [[Luther Blake]] was appointed by the Secretary of the Interior [[Thomas McKean Thompson McKennan]] to move the Indians west. Blake had successfully removed the [[Cherokee]] from Georgia and was presumed capable of the task of removing the Seminole. He had funding to pay every adult male $800 and every woman and child $450. He went to the Indian Territory to find interpreters and returned to Florida in March 1852. Traveling into the field to meet with all of the Indian leaders, by July he had found sixteen Seminole to send west. Finding [[Billy Bowlegs]] insistent on staying in Florida, Blake took Bowlegs and several other chiefs to Washington. President [[Millard Fillmore]] presented Bowlegs with a medal, and he and three other chiefs were persuaded to sign an agreement promising to leave Florida. The chiefs were taken on a tour that included [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]] and New York City. Upon returning to Florida, the chiefs repudiated the agreement they had signed in Washington. Blake was fired in 1853, and Captain Casey was put back in charge of Indian removal.<ref>Covington. pp. 123\u20136.</ref>\n\nIn January 1851, the Florida Legislature had created the position of commander of the Florida Militia, and Governor [[Thomas Brown (Florida politician)|Thomas Brown]] appointed [[Benjamin Hopkins]] to it. Over the next two years, the Florida Militia pursued Seminole who were outside the reservation boundaries. During this period the militia captured one man and a few women, and 140 hogs. One Seminole woman elder committed suicide while being held by the militia, after the rest of her family had escaped. The whole operation cost the state US$40,000.<ref>Covington. p. 126.</ref>\n\nPressure from Florida officials pushed the federal government to take action. Captain Casey continued to try to persuade the Seminole to move west without success. He sent Billy Bowlegs and others to Washington again, but the chiefs refused to agree to move. In August 1854, Secretary of War [[Jefferson Davis]] initiated a program to force the Seminole into a final conflict. The plan included a trade embargo against them, the survey and sale of land in southern Florida to European-American settlers, and a stronger Army presence to protect the new settlers. Davis said that if the Seminole did not agree to leave, the Army would use force.<ref>Covington. pp. 126\u20137.</ref>\n\n==Third Seminole War==<!-- This section is linked from [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]] -->\n\n===Increased Army presence and Indian attacks===\nBy late 1855, there were more than 700 Army troops stationed on the Florida peninsula. Around that time the Seminoles decided that they would strike back at the increasing pressure being put on them and attack when an opportunity presented itself. Sam Jones may have been the instigator of this decision; Chipco was said to have been against it. On December 7, 1855, First Lieutenant George Hartsuff, who had led previous patrols into the reservation, left Fort Myers with ten men and two wagons. They found no Seminoles but did pass corn fields and three deserted villages, including Billy Bowlegs' village. On the evening of December 19, Hartsuff told his men that they would be returning to Fort Myers the next day. As the men were loading the wagons and saddling their horses the next morning (December 20, 1855), forty Seminoles led by Billy Bowlegs attacked the camp. Several soldiers were shot, including Lieutenant Hartsuff, who managed to hide himself. The Seminoles killed and scalped four men in the camp, killed the wagon mules, looted and burned the wagons and took several horses. Seven men, four of them wounded, made it back to Fort Myers.<ref>Covington. pp. 128\u20139.</ref>\n\nWhen the news of the attack reached Tampa, the men of the city elected militia officers and organized companies. The newly formed militia marched to the Peace River valley, recruited more men, and manned some forts along the river. Governor [[James Broome]] started organizing as many volunteer companies as he could. Because the state had limited funds, he tried to have the Army accept the volunteers. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis accepted two infantry companies and three mounted companies, about 260 men. Governor Broome kept another 400 men mobilized under state control. The state troops, both those accepted by the Army and those remaining under state control, had been partly armed and supplied by private donations. General Jesse Carter was appointed by Governor Broome as \"special agent ... without military rank\" to lead the state troops. Carter set half of the state troops to growing crops, and so only 200 of his men were available for patrols. A Tampa newspaper noted that the mounted patrols preferred to patrol in open country, which was easier for the horses, but it allowed the Seminoles to see them coming.<ref>Covington. pp. 129\u201330.</ref>\n\nOn January 6, 1856, two men gathering [[Zamia integrifolia|coontie]] south of the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]] were killed. The settlers in the area promptly fled to Fort Dallas and [[Key Biscayne]]. A party of some twenty Seminoles under Ocsen Tustenuggee attacked a wood-cutting patrol outside of Fort Denaud, killing five of the six men. Despite the positioning of militia units to defend the area, the Seminoles also raided along the coast south of Tampa Bay. They killed one man and burned a house in what is now [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]], and on March 31, 1856, they tried to attack the \"Braden Castle\", the plantation home of Dr. Joseph Braden, in what is now [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]]. The \"Castle\" was too strong for them, but they led away seven slaves and three mules. Burdened with prisoners and loot, the Seminoles did not move fast. While they were stopped at [[Big Charley Apopka Creek]] eating barbecued beef from a cow they had found and slaughtered, the militia caught up with them. The militiamen killed two of the Seminoles and recaptured the slaves and mules taken from Dr. Braden's plantation. The scalp of one of the dead Seminoles was displayed in Tampa, the other in Manatee.<ref>Covington. pp. 130\u20132.</ref>\n\nDuring April, regular Army and militiamen patrolled around and into the reservation but made little contact with the Seminoles. One six-hour battle was fought near Bowlegs Town in April, with four regulars killed and three wounded before the Seminoles withdrew. The Seminoles continued to carry out small raids around the state. On May 14, 1856, fifteen Seminoles attacked the farm house of Captain Robert Bradley north of Tampa, killing two of his young children. One Seminole was killed by Bradley. Bradley may have been targeted because he had killed Tiger Tail's brother during the Second Seminole War. On May 17, Seminoles attacked a wagon train in central Florida, killing three men. Mail and stagecoach service in and out of Tampa was suspended until the military could provide protection.<ref>Covington. pp. 132\u20133.</ref>\n\nOn June 14, 1856, Seminoles attacked a farm {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} from Fort Meade. All of the household made it safely into the house, and they were able to hold the Seminoles at bay. The gunfire was heard at Fort Meade, and seven mounted militiamen responded. Three of the militiamen were killed and two others wounded. More militiamen pursued the Seminoles but had to retreat when a sudden rain wet their powder. On June 16, twenty militiamen from [[Fort Fraser (Florida)|Fort Fraser]] surprised a group of Seminoles along the Peace River, killing some of the Seminoles. The militiamen withdrew after losing two dead and three wounded. They claimed to have killed as many as twenty Seminoles, but the Indians admitted to only four dead and two wounded. However, one of the dead was Ocsen Tustenuggee, who seems to have been the only chief who would actively lead attacks against settlements.<ref>Covington. pp. 133\u20134.</ref>\n\nThe citizens of Florida were becoming disenchanted with the militia. There were complaints that the militiamen would pretend to patrol for a day or two and then go home to work their fields, and that they were given to idleness, drunkenness, and thievery. The officers were reported to be unwilling to submit required paperwork. Most importantly, the militia had failed to prevent attacks against settlers.<ref>Covington. pp. 134\u20135.</ref>\n\n===New strategy===\nIn September 1856, Brigadier General [[William S. Harney]] returned to Florida as commander of the federal troops. Remembering the lessons he had learned in the Second Seminole War, he set up a system of forts in a line across Florida, and patrols moved deep into Seminole territory. He planned to confine the Seminoles to the Big Cypress Swamp and the Everglades, because he believed they would be unable to live there during the wet season. He anticipated being able to catch the Indians when they left their flooded sanctuaries seeking dry land for raising their crops. Part of Harney's plan involved using boats to reach islands and other dry spots in the swamps. He first made one more attempt to negotiate with the Seminoles but was unable to make contact with them. In early January 1857, he ordered his troops to actively pursue the Indians. Harney's plan, however, had shown few results by the time he and the Fifth Infantry were transferred to [[Kansas]] to aid in the [[Bleeding Kansas|uprisings]] there in April.<ref>Covington. pp. 135\u20136.</ref>\n\nColonel [[Gustavus Loomis]] replaced General Harney as commander in Florida, but the withdrawal of the Fifth Infantry left him with only ten companies of the Fourth Artillery, which was later reduced to just four companies. Loomis organized volunteers into boat companies, which were given metal \"alligator boats\" that had been built earlier specifically for use in the Big Cypress Swamp and Everglades. {{convert|30|ft|m|spell=In}} long, pointed at both ends, and drawing two to {{convert|3|ft|m|spell=in}} of water, the boats could carry up to sixteen men into the swamps. These boat companies were able to capture many Indians, primarily women and children. The regulars did not do as well. Some officers, including Captain [[Abner Doubleday]], observed that the Seminoles easily avoided the Army patrols. Doubleday attributed this to the fact that most of the enlisted men were recent immigrants who had no skills in [[wikt:woodcraft|woodcraft]].<ref>Covington. pp. 135\u201340.</ref>\n\nIn 1857, ten companies of Florida militia were taken into federal service, totaling almost 800 men by September. In November these troops captured eighteen women and children from Billy Bowlegs' band. The troops also found and destroyed several towns and fields of crops. The troops moved into the Big Cypress Swamp starting on [[New Year's Day]] 1858, again destroying the towns and cultivated fields they found. Another delegation from the Indian Territory arrived in Florida in January and attempted to contact Bowlegs. The troops stood down while the attempt was made, and Bowlegs was contacted. The previous year the Seminoles had finally been given their own reservation in Indian Territory separate from the Creeks. Cash payments of US$500 to each warrior (more to the chiefs) and $100 to each woman were promised. On March 15, Bowlegs' and Assinwar's bands accepted the offer and agreed to go west. On May 4, a total of 163 Seminoles (including some captured earlier) were shipped to New Orleans. On May 8, 1858, Colonel Loomis declared the war to be over.<ref>Covington. pp. 140\u20133.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nWhen Colonel Loomis declared an end to the Third Seminole War, the government believed that only about 100 Seminole were left in Florida, though there were probably more. In December 1858, the US recruited two bands totaling 75 people, who agreed to removal to the West; they were shipped out on February 15, 1859. Seminoles remained in Florida, however. Sam Jones' band was living in southeast Florida, inland from Miami and Fort Lauderdale. Chipco's band was living north of Lake Okeechobee, although the Army and militia had failed to locate it. And small bands consisting of a family or two were scattered across the wetlands of southern Florida.\n\nSince the war was officially over and the remaining Seminole carefully avoided contact with settlers, the government sent the militia home and reassigned most of the regular Army troops, leaving only small contingents in larger coastal forts such as Fort Brooke. Most of the smaller forts scattered across the Florida wilderness were decommissioned and soon stripped by settlers of any usable material.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate government of Florida]] contacted Sam Jones with promises of aid to keep the Seminole from fighting on the side of the Union. The state did not follow through on its promises, but the Seminole were not interested in fighting another war and remained neutral.\n\nThe [[Florida Constitution#The 1868 Florida Constitution|1868 Florida Constitution]], developed by the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] legislature, gave the Seminole one seat in the house and one seat in the senate of the state legislature. The Seminole never filled the positions. In 1885, legislature passed a new constitution removing the seats for Seminoles and established barriers to voter registration and electoral practices that essentially [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] most blacks and minorities, including Native Americans.<ref>Covington. pp. 145\u20136.</ref> This situation lasted until the passage of federal civil rights and voting legislation in the mid-1960s, which provided for the enforcement of citizens' constitutional rights, and the adoption of Florida's current state constitution in 1968.\n\n===Modern times===\nA small number of Seminoles continued to live in relative isolation in the Lake Okeechobee and Everglades region into the 20th Century. Flood control and drainage projects beginning in the late 1800s opened up more land for development and significantly altered the natural environment, inundating some areas while leaving former swamps dry and arable. These projects, along with the completion of the [[Tamiami Trail]] which bisected the Everglades in 1928, simultaneously ended old ways of life and introduced new opportunities. A steady stream of white developers and tourists came to the area, and the Seminoles began to work in local farms, ranches, and souvenir stands.\n\nIn the 1940s, Seminoles living across the state began moving to reservations and establishing official tribal governments to form ties with the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. In 1957, most Seminoles established formal relations with the US government as the [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]], which is headquartered in [[Hollywood, Florida]] and control the [[Big Cypress Indian Reservation]], [[Brighton Reservation]], Fort Pierce Reservation, [[Hollywood Reservation]], Immokalee Reservation, and [[Tampa Reservation]].<ref>''Atlas of the North American Indian'', 3rd ed. New York: Checkmark Books, 2009. Print.</ref>\n\nThe [[Miccosukee]] branch of the Seminoles held to a more traditional lifestyle in the Everglades region, simultaneously seeking privacy and serving as a tourist attraction, wrestling alligators, selling crafts, and giving [[Ecotourism|eco-tours]] of their land. They received federal recognition as a separate nation in 1962 and received their own reservation lands, collectively known as the [[Miccosukee Indian Reservation]], including a {{convert|333|acre|km2|adj=on}} reservation on the northern border of Everglades National Park, about {{convert|45|mi|km}} west of Miami.<ref name=\"miccosukee\">{{cite web\n|url=http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/resources/hii46735.000/hii46735_0.HTM\n|title=Concerning the Miccosukee Tribe's Ongoing Negotiations with the National Park Service Regarding the Special Use Permit Area\n|publisher=Resources Committee, US House of Representatives\n|date=September 25, 1997\n|accessdate=2011-03-02}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Seminole Wars}}\n* [[Trail of Tears]]\n* [[Ethnic cleansing]]\n* [[History of Florida]]\n* [[Indian Campaign Medal]]\n* [[Indian removal]]\n* [[Indian Removal Act]]\n* [[Indian Wars]]\n* [[Population transfer]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References and bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n* Belko, William S. ed.

As the Army became more deeply involved in the conflict, as the government sent more troops into the theater, and as the public saw more money appropriated for the war, people began to lose their interest. Jesup's capture of Osceola, and the treachery he used to get him, turned public sentiment against the Army. The use of blood hounds only created more hostility in the halls of Congress. It did not matter to the American people that some of Jesup's deceptive practices helped him achieve success militarily.

The fighting occurred between about 1816 and 1858, with two periods of uneasy truce between active conflict. Both in human and monetary terms, the Seminole Wars were the longest and most expensive of the [[American Indian Wars|Indian Wars]] in United States history.\n\n*The '''First Seminole War''' (c. 1816\u20131819) began with General [[Andrew Jackson]]'s excursions into [[West Florida]] and [[East Florida]] against the Seminoles after the conclusion of the [[War of 1812]]. The governments of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] and [[Spain]] both expressed outrage over the \"invasion\". However, Spain was unable to defend or control the territory, as several local uprisings and rebellions made clear. The Spanish Crown agreed to cede Florida to the United States per the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819, and the transfer took place in 1821.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Landers|first1=Jane|title=Atlantic Creoles in the Age of Revolutions|date=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=London|page=193}}</ref> According to the [[Treaty of Moultrie Creek]] of 1823, the Seminoles were required to leave northern Florida and were confined to a large reservation in the center of the Florida peninsula. The U.S. government enforced the treaty by building a series of forts and trading posts in the territory, mainly along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts.<ref name=\"FLMEM\"/>\n*The '''[[Second Seminole War]]''' (1835\u20131842) was the result of the United States government attempting to force the Seminoles to leave Florida altogether and move to [[Indian Territory]] per the [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830. Fighting began with the [[Dade Massacre]] in December 1835, and raids, skirmishes, and a handful of larger battles raged throughout the Florida peninsula over the next few years. At first, the outgunned and outnumbered Seminoles effectively used [[guerrilla warfare]] to frustrate the ever more numerous American military forces.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Seminole-Wars|title=Seminole Wars {{!}} United States history|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-03|language=en}}</ref> In October 1836, General [[Thomas Sidney Jesup]] was sent to Florida to take command of the campaign. After futilely chasing bands of Seminole warriors through the wilderness, Jesup changed tactics and began seeking out and destroying Seminole farms and villages, a strategy which eventually changed the course of the war. Jesup also authorized the controversial captures of Seminole leaders [[Osceola]] and [[Micanopy]] under signs of truce.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Osceola and the Great Seminole War|last=Hatch|first=Thom|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2012|location=New York|pages=219}}</ref> By the early 1840s, most of the Seminole population in Florida had been killed in battle, ravaged by starvation and disease, or relocated to Indian Territory.

After an army [[surveying]] crew found and destroyed a Seminole plantation west of the [[Everglades]] in December 1855, Chief [[Billy Bowlegs]] led a raid near [[Fort Myers]], setting off a conflict which consisted mainly of raids and reprisals, with no large battles fought. Once again, the American strategy was to destroy the Seminoles' food supply, and by 1858, most of the remaining Seminoles, weary of war and facing starvation, agreed to be sent to Oklahoma in exchange for promises of safe passage and cash payments. An estimated 500 Seminole still refused to leave and retreated deep into the Everglades and the [[Big Cypress Swamp]] to live on land that was unwanted by white settlers.<ref name=\"FLMEM\"/>\n\n==Background==\n\n===Colonial Florida===\n====Decline of indigenous cultures====\nThe original [[indigenous peoples of Florida]] declined significantly in number after the arrival of European explorers in the early 1500s, mainly because the Native Americans had little resistance to diseases newly introduced from Europe. [[Kingdom of Spain|Spanish]] suppression of native revolts further reduced the population in northern Florida until the early 1600s, at which time the establishment of a series of [[Spanish missions in Florida|Spanish missions]] improved relations and stabilized the population.\n\nRaids from the newly-established English [[Province of Carolina]] beginning in the mid-1600s began another steep decline in the indigenous population. By 1707, English soldiers and their [[Yamasee|Yamasee Indian]] allies had killed, carried off, or driven away most of the remaining native inhabitants during a series of raids across the Florida panhandle and down the full length of the peninsula. In the first decade of the 18th century. 10,000\u201312,000 Indians were taken as slaves according to the governor of La Florida and by 1710, observers noted that north Florida was virtually depopulated. The Spanish missions all closed, as without natives, there was nothing for them to do. The few remaining natives fled west to [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] and beyond or east to the vicinity of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]. When Spain ceded Florida to [[Kingdom of Britain|Great Britain]] as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, the majority of surviving Florida Indians took passage with the Spanish to [[Cuba]] or [[New Spain]].<ref>{{Citation\n|last=Milanich\n|first=Jerald T.\n|year=1999\n|title=The Timucua\n|publisher=Blackwell Publishers\n|publication-place=Oxford, UK\n|isbn=0-631-21864-5\n|pages=209\u2013213}}<br>{{cite book|last=Milanich|first=Jerald T.|title=Laboring in the Fields of the Lord: Spanish Missions and Southeastern Indians|year=2006|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, Florida|isbn=0-8130-2966-X|pages=187\u20138, 191, 195}}<br>{{cite news|last=Horwitz|first=Tony|title=Apalachee Tribe, Missing for Centuries, Comes out of Hiding|url=http://www.weyanoke.org/doc/WSJ-ApalacheeTribe.doc|accessdate=23 October 2011|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=9 March 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106175341/http://www.weyanoke.org/doc/WSJ-ApalacheeTribe.doc|archive-date=6 November 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Origin of the Seminole====\nDuring the mid-1700s, small bands from various Native American tribes from the [[southeastern United States]] began moving into the unoccupied lands of Florida. In 1715, the [[Yamasee]] moved into Florida as allies of the Spanish, after conflicts with the English colonies.  [[Creek people]], at first primarily the [[Lower Creek]] but later including [[Upper Creek]], also started moving into Florida from the area of Georgia. The [[Mikasuki]], ''[[Hitchiti]]''-speakers, settled around what is now [[Lake Miccosukee]] near [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]]. (Descendants of this group have maintained a separate tribal identity as today's [[Miccosukee]].)\n\nAnother group of Hitchiti speakers, led by [[Cowkeeper]], settled in what is now [[Alachua County, Florida|Alachua County]], an area where the Spanish had maintained cattle ranches in the 17th century. Because one of the best-known ranches was called ''El Rancho de la Ch\u00faa'', the region became known as the \"[[Paynes Prairie|Alachua Prairie]]\". The Spanish in Saint Augustine began calling the Alachua Creek ''Cimarrones'', which roughly meant \"wild ones\" or \"runaways\". This was the probable origin of the term \"Seminole\".<ref>The Alachua Seminoles retained a separate identity at least through the Third Seminole War. Cowkeeper was succeeded by his nephew [[King Payne|Payne]] in 1784. Payne was killed in an attack on the Seminole by the Georgia militia in 1812. His brother [[Bolek|Billy Bowlegs]] (the first of that name) took most of the band to the Suwannee River. Disturbed by Andrew Jackson's campaign in 1818, the Alachua Seminole moved into central Florida. After the death of Bowlegs in 1821, his nephew [[Micanopy]] succeeded him. After he was captured and sent west, his nephew [[Billy Bowlegs]] (''Holata Micco'') led the remnants of the Seminole until his surrender in 1858. Weisman. pp. 22\u201324. Covington. p. 143.</ref><ref>[[Maroon (people)|Maroon]], the name for fugitive slaves in a number of locations throughout the [[Americas]], is also probably derived from the Spanish ''Cimarrones''.</ref>  This name was eventually applied to the other groups in Florida, although the Indians still regarded themselves as members of different tribes. Other Native American groups in Florida during the Seminole Wars included the [[Choctaw]], [[Yuchi]] or Spanish Indians, so called because it was believed that they were descended from [[Calusa]]s; and \"rancho Indians\", who lived at Spanish/Cuban fishing camps (ranchos) on the Florida coast.<ref>Missall. pp. 4\u20137, 128.<br>Knetsch. p. 13.<br>Buker. pp. 9\u201310.</ref>\n\nFugitive African and African-American slaves who could reach the fort were essentially free. Many were from Pensacola; some were free citizens though others had escaped from United States territory. The Spanish offered the slaves freedom and land in Florida; they recruited former slaves as militia to help defend Pensacola and [[Fort Mose Historic State Park|Fort Mos\u00e9]]. Other fugitive slaves joined Seminole bands as free members of the tribe.\n\nMost of the former slaves at Fort Mos\u00e9 went to Cuba with the Spanish when they left Florida in 1763, while others lived with or near various bands of Indians. Fugitive slaves from the Carolinas and Georgia continued to make their way to Florida, as the [[Underground Railway]] ran south. The blacks who stayed with or later joined the Seminoles became integrated into the tribes, learning the languages, adopting the dress, and inter-marrying. The blacks knew how to farm and served as interpreters between the Seminole and the whites. Some of the [[Black Seminoles]], as they were called, became important tribal leaders.<ref>Missall. pp. 10\u201312.</ref>\n\n===Early conflict===\nDuring the [[American Revolution]] (1775\u20131783), the British&mdash;who controlled Florida&mdash;recruited Seminoles to raid frontier settlements in Georgia. The confusion of war allowed more slaves to escape to Florida. The British promised slaves freedom for fighting with them. These events made the new United States enemies of the Seminoles. In 1783, as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|treaty]] ending the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], Florida was returned to Spain. Spain's grip on Florida was light, as it maintained only small [[garrison]]s at St. Augustine, [[St. Marks, Florida|St. Marks]] and [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]]. They did not control the border between Florida and the United States and were unable to act against the [[State of Muskogee]] established in 1799, envisioned as a single nation of American Indians independent of both Spain and the United States, until 1803 when both nations conspired to entrap its founder. Mikasukis and other Seminole groups still occupied towns on the United States side of the border, while American [[squatter]]s moved into Spanish Florida.<ref>Missall. pp. 12\u201313, 18</ref>\n\nThe British had divided Florida into [[East Florida]] and [[West Florida]] in 1763, a division retained by the Spanish when they regained Florida in 1783. West Florida extended from the [[Apalachicola River]] to the [[Mississippi River]]. Together with their possession of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]], the Spanish controlled the lower reaches of all of the rivers draining the United States west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. It prohibited the US from transport and trade on the lower Mississippi. In addition to its desire to expand west of the mountains, the United States wanted to acquire Florida. It wanted to gain free commerce on western rivers, and to prevent Florida from being used a base for possible invasion of the U.S. by a European country.<ref>Missall. pp. 13, 15\u201318.</ref>\n\n===The Louisiana Purchase===\nIn order to obtain a port on the Gulf of Mexico with secure access for Americans, United States diplomats in Europe were instructed to try to purchase the Isle of Orleans and West Florida from whichever country owned them. When [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert Livingston]] approached France in 1803 about buying the Isle of Orleans, the French government offered to sell it and all of Louisiana as well. While the purchase of Louisiana exceeded their authorization, Livingston and [[James Monroe]] (who had been sent to help him negotiate the sale) in the deliberations with France pursued a claim that the area east of the Mississippi to the [[Perdido River]] was part of Louisiana.  As part of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase treaty, France repeated verbatim Article 3 of its 1800 treaty with Spain, thus expressly subrogating the United States to the rights of France and Spain.<ref name=\"Curry\">{{cite journal|work=Magazine of American History|title=The Acquisition of Florida|first= J.

Rebellions against the Spanish authorities broke out in many of its American colonies. Settlers in West Florida and in the adjacent [[Mississippi Territory]] started organizing in the summer of 1810 to seize Mobile and [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], the last of which was outside the part of West Florida claimed by the United States.\n\nResidents of westernmost West Florida (between the Mississippi and [[Pearl River (Mississippi\u2013Louisiana)|Pearl]] rivers) organized a convention at [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] in the summer of 1810. The convention was concerned about maintaining public order and preventing control of the district from falling into French hands; at first it tried to establish a government under local control that was nominally loyal to Ferdinand VII. After discovering that the Spanish governor of the district had appealed for military aid to put down an \"insurrection\", residents of the Baton Rouge District overthrew the local Spanish authorities on September 23 by seizing the Spanish fort in Baton Rouge. On September 26, the convention declared West Florida to be independent.<ref>Stagg. pp. 58\u201367</ref>\n\nPro-Spanish, pro-American, and pro-independence factions quickly formed in the newly proclaimed republic. The pro-American faction appealed to the United States to annex the area and to provide financial aid. On October 27, 1810, U.S. President [[James Madison]] proclaimed that the United States should take possession of West Florida between the Mississippi and Perdido Rivers, based on the tenuous claim that it was part of the Louisiana Purchase.<ref>[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=65912 \"Proclamation 16 \u2013 Taking Possession of Part of Louisiana (Annexation of West Florida)\"]</ref>\n\nMadison authorized [[William C.

The United States would be authorized to either accept transfer of territory from \"local authorities\", or occupy territory to prevent it falling into the hands of a foreign power other than Spain.

Within several days the Patriots, along with a regiment of regular Army troops and Georgian volunteers, moved toward St. Augustine. On this march the Patriots were slightly in advance of the American troops. The Patriots would proclaim possession of some ground, raise the Patriot flag, and as the \"local authority\" surrender the territory to the United States troops, who would then substitute the American flag for the Patriot flag. The Patriots faced no opposition as they marched, usually with Gen. Mathews.<ref name=\"senate\"/> Accounts of witnesses state that the Patriots could have made no progress but for the protection of the U.S. forces and could not have maintained their position in the country without the aid of the U.S. troops. The American troops and Patriots acted in close concert, marching, camping, foraging and fighting together. In this way, the American troops sustained the Patriots,<ref name=\"senate\"/> who, however, were unable to take the [[Castillo de San Marcos]] in [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]. \n\nAs soon as the U.S. government was notified of these events, Congress became alarmed at the possibility of being drawn into war with Spain, and the effort fell apart. Secretary of State [[James Monroe]] promptly disavowed the actions and relieved Gen. Mathews of his commission on May 9, on the grounds that neither of the instructed contingencies had occurred.<ref name=\"Williams1837\"/> However, peace negotiations with the Spanish authorities were protracted and slow. Through the summer and autumn, the U.S. and Patriot troops foraged and plundered almost every plantation and farm, most of them having been abandoned by their owners. The troops helped themselves to everything they could find. Stored food was used up, growing crops destroyed or fed to horses, all types of movable property plundered or destroyed, buildings and fences burned, cattle and hogs killed or stolen for butchering, and slaves often dispersed or abducted. This continued until May 1813 and left the formerly inhabited parts in a state of desolation.<ref name=\"senate\"/>\n\nIn June 1812 George Mathews met with [[King Payne]] and other [[Seminole]] leaders. After the meeting, Mathews believed that the Seminoles would remain neutral in the conflict. [[Sebasti\u00e1n Kindel\u00e1n y O'Regan]], the governor of East Florida, tried to induce the Seminoles to fight on the Spanish side. Some of the Seminoles wanted to fight the Georgians in the Patriot Army, but King Payne and others held out for peace. The Seminoles were not happy with the Spanish, comparing their treatment under the Spanish unfavorably with that received from the British when they held Florida. [[Ahaya]], or Cowkeeper, King Payne's predecessor, had sworn to kill 100 Spaniards, and on his deathbed lamented having killed only 84. At a second conference with the Patriot Army leaders, the Seminoles again promised to remain neutral.<ref>Patrick. pp. 174, 176, 179\u201381.</ref>\n\nThe blacks living in Florida outside of St. Augustine, many of whom were former slaves from Georgia and South Carolina, were not disposed to be neutral. Often slaves in name only to Seminoles, they lived in freedom and feared loss of that freedom if the United States took Florida away from Spain. Many blacks enlisted in the defense of St. Augustine, while others urged the Seminoles to fight the Patriot Army. In a third meeting with Seminole leaders, the Patriot Army leaders threatened the Seminoles with destruction if they fought on the side of the Spanish. This threat gave the Seminoles favoring war, led by King Payne's brother [[Bolek]] (also known as Bowlegs) the upper hand. Joined by warriors from Alligator (near present-day [[Lake City, Florida|Lake City]]) and other towns, the Seminoles sent 200 Indians and 40 blacks to attack the Patriots.<ref>Patrick. pp. 183\u201385.</ref>\n\nIn retaliation for Seminole raids, in September 1812 Colonel [[Daniel Newnan]] led 117 Georgia militiamen in an attempt to seize the Alachua Seminole lands around [[Payne's Prairie]]. Newnan's force never reached the Seminole towns, losing eight men dead, eight missing, and nine wounded after battling Seminoles for more than a week. Four months later Lt. Colonel [[Thomas Adams Smith]] led 220 U.S. Army regulars and Tennessee volunteers in a raid on Payne's Town, the chief town of the Alachua Seminoles. Smith's force found a few Indians, but the Alachua Seminoles had abandoned Payne's Town and moved southward.

Harris petitioned the governor of Georgia for money, stating that a settlement of Americans in the Alachua Country would help keep the Seminoles away from the Georgia border, and would be able to intercept runaway slaves from Georgia before they could reach the Seminoles. Unfortunately for Harris, Georgia did not have funds available. Harris also hoped to acquire the land around the Alachua Prairie ([[Paynes Prairie]]) by treaty from the Seminoles, but could not persuade the Seminoles to meet with him. The Spanish were also not interested in dealing with Harris.<ref>Patrick. pp. 269\u201371, 277.</ref>\n\nIn January, 1814, 70 men led by Buckner Harris crossed from Georgia into East Florida, headed for the Alachua Country. More men joined them as they traveled through East Florida, with more than 90 in the group when they reached the site of Payne's Town, which had been burned in 1812. The men built a 25-foot square, two-story blockhouse, which they named Fort Mitchell, after [[David Brydie Mitchell|David Mitchell]], former governor of Georgia and a supporter of the Patriot invasion of East Florida.{{refn|group=Note|The location of the settlement at Fort Mitchell is disputed. Frederick Davis, based on its reported latitude, placed it east of present-day Ocala.<ref>Davis (January 1930). p. 145.</ref> Chris Monaco argues that the reported latitude was in error, and that other evidence supports a location on the south side of Paynes Prairie. The settlement was described as being next to a prairie \"7 or 8 miles wide and 20 long,\" which corresponds to the size of Payne's Prairie.

On January 25, 1814, the settlers established a government, titled \"The District of Elotchaway of the Republic of East Florida\", with Buckner Harris as Director.

In May 1814, a British force entered the mouth of the Apalachicola River, and distributed arms to the Seminole and Creek warriors, and fugitive slaves. The British moved upriver and began building a fort at [[Fort Gadsden|Prospect Bluff]].<ref>Sugden, p.281</ref> A company of [[Royal Marines]], commanded by Lieutenant Colonel [[Edward Nicolls]], was to subsequently arrive, but was invited to relocate to Pensacola in late August 1814.<ref>Sugden, p.287</ref> It was estimated, by Captain Lockyer of {{HMS|Sophie|1809|6}}, that in August 1814 there were 1,000 Indians at Pensacola, of whom 700 were warriors.<ref>Sugden, p. 291</ref> Two months after the British and their Indian allies were beaten back from an attack on [[Fort Bowyer]] near [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]], a US force led by General Jackson drove the British out of [[Battle of Pensacola (1814)|Pensacola]], and back to the Apalachicola River.

He told the Indians that the [[Treaty of Ghent]] guaranteed the return of all Indian lands lost during the War of 1812, including the Creek lands in Georgia and Alabama.<ref>Sugden, p. 306</ref> As the Seminole were not interested in holding a fort, they returned to their villages. Before Nicolls left in the spring of 1815, he turned the fort over to the fugitive slaves and Seminoles whom he had originally recruited for possible incursions into U.S. territory during the war.

Chief [[Neamathla]] of Fowltown got into a dispute with the commander of Fort Scott over the use of land on the eastern side of the Flint River, essentially claiming Mikasuki sovereignty over the area. The land in southern Georgia had been ceded by the Creeks in the Treaty of Fort Jackson, but the Mikasukis did not consider themselves Creek, did not feel bound by the treaty which they had not signed, and did not accept that the Creeks had any right to cede Mikasuki land. In November 1817, General Gaines sent a force of 250 men to seize Fowltown. The first attempt was beaten off by the Mikasukis. The next day, November 22, 1817, the Mikasukis were driven from their village. Some historians date the start of the war to this attack on Fowltown. [[David Brydie Mitchell]], former governor of Georgia and Creek [[Indian agent]] at the time, stated in a report to [[United States Congress|Congress]] that the attack on Fowltown was the start of the First Seminole War.<ref>Missall. Pp. 33-37.</ref>\n\nA week later a boat carrying supplies for Fort Scott, under the command of Lt. Richard W. Scott, was attacked on the [[Apalachicola River]]. There were forty to fifty people on the boat, including twenty sick soldiers, seven wives of soldiers, and possibly some children. (While there are reports of four children being killed by the Seminoles, they were not mentioned in early reports of the massacre, and their presence has not been confirmed.) Most of the boat's passengers were killed by the Indians. One woman was taken prisoner, and six survivors made it to the fort.<ref>Missall. Pp. 36-37.<br> Knetsch. Pp. 26-27.</ref>\n\nWhile General Gaines had been under orders not to invade Florida, he later decided to allow short intrusions into Florida. When news of the [[Scott Massacre]] on the Apalachicola reached [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], Gaines was ordered to invade Florida and pursue the Indians but not to attack any Spanish installations. However, Gaines had left for East Florida to deal with pirates who had occupied [[Original Town of Fernandina Historic Site|Fernandina]]. [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[John C. Calhoun]] then ordered Andrew Jackson to lead the invasion of Florida.<ref>Missall.

On March 15, Jackson's army entered Florida, marching down the banks of the [[Apalachicola River]]. When they reached the site of the Negro Fort, Jackson had his men construct a new fort, [[Fort Gadsden]]. The army then set out for the Mikasuki villages around Lake Miccosukee. The Indian town of [[Anhaica]] (today's [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]]) was burned on March 31, and the town of [[Miccosukee, Florida|Miccosukee]] was taken the next day. More than 300 Indian homes were destroyed. Jackson then turned south, reaching [[San Marcos de Apalache Historic State Park|Fort St. Marks]] (''San Marcos'') on April 6.<ref>Missall. pp. 39\u201340.</ref>\n\nAt St. Marks Jackson seized the Spanish fort. There he found [[Alexander George Arbuthnot]], a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] trader working out of the [[Bahamas]]. He traded with the Indians in Florida and had written letters to British and American officials on behalf of the Indians. He was rumored to be selling guns to the Indians and to be preparing them for war. He probably was selling guns, since the main trade item of the Indians was deer skins, and they needed guns to hunt the deer.<ref name=\"Missall. pp. 33, 40-41\">Missall. pp. 33, 40\u201341.</ref> Two Indian leaders, [[Josiah Francis (Hillis Hadjo)]], a [[Red Sticks|Red Stick Creek]] also known as the \"Prophet\" (not to be confused with [[Tenskwatawa]]), and Homathlemico, had been captured when they had gone out to an American ship flying the British [[Union Flag]] that had anchored off of St. Marks. As soon as Jackson arrived at St. Marks, the two Indians were brought ashore and hanged without trial.<ref name=\"Missall. pp. 33, 40-41\"/>\n\nJackson left St. Marks to attack villages along the [[Suwannee River]], which were occupied primarily by fugitive slaves. On April 12, the army found a Red Stick village on the [[Econfina River]], and attacked it. Close to 40 [[Red Sticks]] were killed, and about 100 women and children were captured. In the village, they found Elizabeth Stewart, the woman who had been captured in the attack on the supply boat on the [[Apalachicola River]] the previous November. The army found the villages on the Suwannee empty, many of the [[Black Seminoles]] having escaped to Tampa Bay to the [[maroon]] community of [[Angola, Florida|Angola]].<ref>Canter Brown, Jr., 2005 Tales of Angola: Free Blacks, Red Stick Creeks, and International Intrigue in Spanish Southwest Florida, 1812\u20131821.

At St. Marks a [[military tribunal]] was convened, and Ambrister and Arbuthnot were charged with aiding the Seminoles and the Spanish, inciting them to war and leading them against the United States. Ambrister threw himself on the mercy of the court, while Arbuthnot maintained his innocence, saying that he had only been engaged in legal trade. The tribunal sentenced both men to death but then relented and changed Ambrister's sentence to fifty lashes and a year at hard labor. Jackson, however, reinstated Ambrister's death penalty. Ambrister was executed by a [[firing squad]] on April 29, 1818. Arbuthnot was hanged from the [[Yard (sailing)|yardarm]] of his own ship.<ref>Missall. p. 42.</ref>\n\nJackson left a garrison at Fort St. Marks and returned to [[Fort Gadsden]]. Jackson had first reported that all was peaceful and that he would be returning to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].\n\n====West Florida (west of the Apalachicola River)====\nGeneral Jackson later reported that Indians were gathering and being supplied by the Spanish, and he left Fort Gadsden with 1,000 men on May 7, headed for Pensacola. The governor of West Florida protested that most of the Indians at Pensacola were women and children and that the men were unarmed, but Jackson did not stop. When he reached Pensacola on May 23, the governor and the 175-man Spanish garrison retreated to [[Fort Barrancas]], leaving the city of Pensacola to Jackson. The two sides exchanged cannon fire for a couple of days, and then the Spanish surrendered Fort Barrancas on May 28. Jackson left Colonel [[William King (Governor of West Florida)|William King]] as military governor of West Florida and went home.<ref>Missall. pp. 42\u201343.</ref>\n\n===Consequences===\nThere were international repercussions to Jackson's actions. [[United States Department of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Quincy Adams]] had just started negotiations with Spain for the purchase of Florida. Spain protested the invasion and seizure of West Florida and suspended the negotiations. Spain did not have the means to retaliate against the United States or regain West Florida by force, so Adams let the Spanish officials protest, then issued a letter (with 72 supporting documents) blaming the war on the British, Spanish, and Indians. In the letter he also apologized for the seizure of West Florida, said that it had not been American policy to seize Spanish territory, and offered to give St. Marks and Pensacola back to Spain.\n\nSpain accepted and eventually resumed negotiations for the sale of Florida.<ref>Missall. pp. 46\u201347.</ref> Defending Jackson's actions as necessary, and sensing that they strengthened his diplomatic standing, Adams demanded Spain either control the inhabitants of East Florida or cede it to the United States. An agreement was then reached whereby [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|Spain ceded East Florida]] to the United States and renounced all claim to West.<ref>[https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/jd/16320.htm Acquisition of Florida: Treaty of Adams-Onis (1819) and Transcontinental Treaty (1821)<!-- Bot generated title -->] </ref>\n\nBritain protested the execution of two of its subjects who had never entered United States territory. There was talk in Britain of demanding reparations and taking reprisals. Americans worried about another war with Britain. In the end Britain, realizing how important the United States was to its economy, opted for maintaining good relations.<ref>Missall. p. 45.</ref>\n\nThere were also repercussions in America. Congressional committees held hearings into the irregularities of the Ambrister and Arbuthnot trials. While most Americans supported Jackson, some worried that Jackson could become a \"man on horseback\", a [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], and transform the United States into a military dictatorship. When Congress reconvened in December 1818, resolutions were introduced condemning Jackson's actions. Jackson was too popular, and the resolutions failed, but the Ambrister and Arbuthnot executions left a stain on his reputation for the rest of his life, although it was not enough to keep him from becoming President.<ref>Missall. pp. 44, 47\u201350.</ref>\n\n==First Interbellum==\nSpain ceded Florida to the United States in 1819 with the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]], and the United States took possession in 1821. Effective government was slow in coming to Florida. General Andrew Jackson was appointed military governor in March 1821, but he did not arrive in Pensacola until July. He resigned the post in September and returned home in October, having spent just three months in Florida. His successor, [[William Pope Duval|William P. Duval]], was not appointed until April 1822, and he left for an extended visit to his home in [[Kentucky]] before the end of the year. Other official positions in the territory had similar turn-over and absences.<ref>Missall. pp. 53\u201361.</ref>\n\nThe Seminoles were still a problem for the new government. In early 1822, Capt. John R. Bell, provisional secretary of the Florida territory and temporary agent to the Seminoles, prepared an estimate of the number of Indians in Florida. He reported about 22,000 Indians, and 5,000 slaves held by Indians. He estimated that two-thirds of them were refugees from the [[Creek War]], with no valid claim (in the U.S. view) to Florida. Indian settlements were located in the areas around the Apalachicola River, along the [[Suwannee River]], from there south-eastwards to the Alachua Prairie, and then south-westward to a little north of [[Tampa Bay]].<ref>Missall. p. 55.</ref>\n\nOfficials in Florida were concerned from the beginning about the situation with the Seminoles. Until a treaty was signed establishing a reservation, the Indians were not sure of where they could plant crops and expect to be able to harvest them, and they had to contend with white squatters moving into land they occupied. There was no system for licensing traders, and unlicensed traders were supplying the Seminoles with [[Distilled beverage|liquor]]. However, because of the part-time presence and frequent turnover of territorial officials, meetings with the Seminoles were canceled, postponed, or sometimes held merely to set a time and place for a new meeting.<ref>Missall. pp. 58\u201362.</ref>\n\n===Treaty of Moultrie Creek===\n{{main|Treaty of Moultrie Creek}}\n[[File:Moultriecreekreservation.PNG|thumb|250px|The [[Treaty of Moultrie Creek]] provided for a reservation in central Florida for the Seminoles.]]\n\nIn 1823, the government decided to settle the Seminole on a reservation in the central part of the territory. A meeting to negotiate a treaty was scheduled for early September 1823 at Moultrie Creek, south of St. Augustine. About 425 Seminole attended the meeting, choosing ''Neamathla'' to be their chief representative or Speaker. Under the terms of the treaty negotiated there, the Seminole were forced to go under the protection of the United States and give up all claim to lands in Florida, in exchange for a reservation of about four million acres (16,000&nbsp;km\u00b2). The reservation would run down the middle of the Florida peninsula from just north of present-day [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]] to a line even with the southern end of Tampa Bay. The boundaries were well inland from both coasts, to prevent contact with traders from [[Cuba]] and the [[Bahamas]]. Neamathla and five other chiefs were allowed to keep their villages along the [[Apalachicola River]].<ref>Missall. pp. 63\u2013-64.</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Treaty of Moultrie Creek]], the US was obligated to protect the Seminole as long as they remained law-abiding. The government was supposed to distribute farm implements, cattle and hogs to the Seminole, compensate them for travel and losses involved in relocating to the reservation, and provide rations for a year, until the Seminoles could plant and harvest new crops. The government was also supposed to pay the tribe US$5,000 per year for twenty years and provide an interpreter, a school and a blacksmith for twenty years. In turn, the Seminole had to allow roads to be built across the reservation and had to apprehend and return to US jurisdiction any runaway slaves or other fugitives.<ref>Missall. pp. 64\u201365.</ref>\n\n[[File:Fortbrooke.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Barracks and tents at [[Fort Brooke]] near [[Tampa Bay]]]]\n\nImplementation of the treaty stalled. [[Fort Brooke]], with four companies of infantry, was established on the site of present-day [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] in early 1824, to show the Seminole that the government was serious about moving them onto the reservation. However, by June [[James Gadsden]], who was the principal author of the treaty and charged with implementing it, was reporting that the Seminole were unhappy with the treaty and were hoping to renegotiate it. Fear of a new war crept in. In July, Governor DuVal mobilized the militia and ordered the [[Tallahassee]] and [[Miccosukee]] chiefs to meet him in St. Marks. At that meeting, he ordered the Seminole to move to the reservation by October 1, 1824.<ref>Missall. pp. 69\u201371.</ref>\n\nThe move had not begun, but DuVal began paying the Seminole compensation for the improvements they were having to leave as an incentive to move. He also had the promised rations sent to Fort Brooke on Tampa Bay for distribution. The Seminole finally began moving onto the reservation, but within a year some returned to their former homes between the Suwannee and Apalachicola rivers. By 1826, most of the Seminole had gone to the reservation, but were not thriving. They had to clear and plant new fields, and cultivated fields suffered in a long drought. Some of the tribe were reported to have starved to death. Both Col. George M. Brooke, commander of Fort Brooke, and Governor DuVal wrote to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] seeking help for the starving Seminole, but the requests got caught up in a debate over whether the people should be moved to west of the Mississippi River. For five months, no additional relief reached the Seminole.<ref>Missall. pp. 71\u201373.</ref>\n\n[[File:Seminolevillage.jpg|thumb|250px|View of a Seminole village shows the log cabins they lived in prior to the disruptions of the Second Seminole War]]\n\nThe Seminoles slowly settled into the reservation, although they had isolated clashes with whites. [[Fort King]] was built near the reservation agency, at the site of present-day Ocala, and by early 1827 the Army could report that the Seminoles were on the reservation and Florida was peaceful. During the five-year peace, some settlers continued to call for removal. The Seminole were opposed to any such move, and especially to the suggestion that they join their [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]] relations. Most whites regarded the Seminole as simply Creeks who had recently moved to Florida, while the Seminole claimed Florida as their home and denied that they had any connection with the Creeks.<ref>Missall. pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nThe Seminole and slave catchers argued over the ownership of slaves. New plantations in Florida increased the pool of slaves who could escape to Seminole territory. Worried about the possibility of an Indian uprising and/or a slave rebellion, Governor DuVal requested additional Federal troops for Florida, but in 1828 the US closed Fort King. Short of food and finding the hunting declining on the reservation, the Seminole wandered off to get food. In 1828, Andrew Jackson, the old enemy of the Seminoles, was elected [[President of the United States]]. In 1830, Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]] he promoted, which was to resolve the problems by moving the Seminole and other tribes west of the Mississippi.<ref>Missall. pp. 78\u201380.</ref>\n\n===Treaty of Payne's Landing===\n{{main|Treaty of Payne's Landing}}\nIn the spring of 1832, the Seminoles on the reservation were called to a meeting at Payne's Landing on the [[Oklawaha River]]. The treaty negotiated there called for the Seminoles to move west, if the land were found to be suitable. They were to settle on the Creek reservation and become part of the Creek tribe. The delegation of seven chiefs who were to inspect the new reservation did not leave Florida until October 1832. After touring the area for several months and conferring with the Creeks who had already been settled there, the seven chiefs signed a statement on March 28, 1833, that the new land was acceptable. Upon their return to Florida, however, most of the chiefs renounced the statement, claiming that they had not signed it, or that they had been forced to sign it, and in any case, that they did not have the power to decide for all the tribes and bands that resided on the reservation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seminolenationmuseum.org/history/seminole-nation/the-seminole-wars/|title=The Seminole Wars \u2013 Seminole Nation Museum|website=www.seminolenationmuseum.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-03}}</ref> The villages in the area of the Apalachicola River were more easily persuaded, however, and went west in 1834.<ref>Missall. pp. 83\u201385.</ref>\n\n[[File:Osceola.jpg|thumb|left|[[Osceola]], Seminole leader]]\n\nThe [[United States Senate]] finally ratified the [[Treaty of Payne's Landing]] in April 1834. The treaty had given the Seminoles three years to move west of the Mississippi. The government interpreted the three years as starting 1832 and expected the Seminoles to move in 1835. Fort King was reopened in 1834. A new Seminole agent, Wiley Thompson, had been appointed in 1834, and the task of persuading the Seminoles to move fell to him. He called the chiefs together at Fort King in October 1834 to talk to them about the removal to the west. The Seminoles informed Thompson that they had no intention of moving and that they did not feel bound by the Treaty of Payne's Landing. Thompson then requested reinforcements for Fort King and Fort Brooke, reporting that, \"the Indians after they had received the Annuity, purchased an unusually large quantity of Powder & Lead.\" General Clinch also warned Washington that the Seminoles did not intend to move and that more troops would be needed to force them to move. In March 1835, Thompson called the chiefs together to read a letter from Andrew Jackson to them. In his letter, Jackson said, \"Should you ... refuse to move, I have then directed the Commanding officer to remove you by force.\" The chiefs asked for thirty days to respond. A month later, the Seminole chiefs told Thompson that they would not move west. Thompson and the chiefs began arguing, and General Clinch had to intervene to prevent bloodshed. Eventually, eight of the chiefs agreed to move west but asked to delay the move until the end of the year, and Thompson and Clinch agreed.<ref>Missall. pp. 86\u201390.</ref>\n\nFive of the most important of the Seminole chiefs, including [[Micanopy]] of the Alachua Seminoles, had not agreed to the move. In retaliation, Thompson declared that those chiefs were removed from their positions. As relations with the Seminoles deteriorated, Thompson forbade the sale of guns and ammunition to the Seminoles. [[Osceola]], a young warrior beginning to be noticed by the whites, was particularly upset by the ban, feeling that it equated Seminoles with slaves and said, \"The white man shall not make me black. I will make the white man red with blood; and then blacken him in the sun and rain ... and the buzzard live upon his flesh.\" In spite of this, Thompson considered Osceola to be a friend and gave him a rifle. Later, though, when Osceola was causing trouble, Thompson had him locked up at Fort King for a night. The next day, in order to secure his release, Osceola agreed to abide by the Treaty of Payne's Landing and to bring his followers in.<ref>Missall. pp. 90\u201391.</ref>\n\nThe situation grew worse. On June 19, 1835, a group of whites searching for lost cattle found a group of Indians sitting around a campfire cooking the remains of what they claimed was one of their herd. The whites disarmed and proceeded to whip the Indians, when two more arrived and opened fire on the whites. Three whites were wounded and one Indian was killed and one wounded, at what became known as the skirmish at Hickory Sink. After complaining to Indian Agent Thompson and not receiving a satisfactory response, the Seminoles became further convinced that they would not receive fair compensations for their complaints of hostile treatment by the settlers. Believed to be in response for the incident at Hickory Sink, in August 1835, Private Kinsley Dalton (for whom [[Dalton, Georgia]], is named) was killed by Seminoles as he was carrying the mail from Fort Brooke to Fort King.<ref>Tebeau. p. 158</ref>\n\nIn November 1835 Chief Charley Emathla, wanting no part of a war, agreed to removal and sold his cattle at Fort King in preparation for moving his people to Fort Brooke to emigrate to the west. This act was considered a betrayal by other Seminoles who months earlier declared in council that any Seminole chief who sold his cattle would be sentenced to death. Osceola met Charley Emathla on the trail back to his village and killed him, scattering the money from the cattle purchase across his body.<ref>Missall. pp. 91\u201392.</ref>\n\n==Second Seminole War==<!-- This section is linked from [[Miami, Florida]] -->\n{{Main|Second Seminole War}}\n[[File:Seminolesmassacreingwhites.jpg|thumb|Woodcut from ''A true and authentic account of the Indian war in Florida ... '' (1836)]]\n\nAs Florida officials realized the Seminole would resist relocation, preparations for war began. Settlers fled to safety as Seminole attacked plantations and a militia wagon train. Two companies totaling 110 men under the command of Major [[Francis L. Dade]] were sent from Fort Brooke to reinforce Fort King in mid-December 1835. On the morning of December 28, the train of troops was ambushed by a group of Seminole warriors under the command of Alligator near modern-day [[Bushnell, Florida]]. The entire command and their small cannon was destroyed, with only two badly wounded soldiers surviving to return to Fort Brooke. Over the next few months Generals [[Duncan Lamont Clinch|Clinch]], [[Edmund P. Gaines|Gaines]] and [[Winfield Scott]], as well as territorial governor [[Richard Keith Call]], led large numbers of troops in futile pursuits of the Seminoles. In the meantime the Seminoles struck throughout the state, attacking isolated farms, settlements, plantations and Army forts, even burning the [[Cape Florida Light|Cape Florida lighthouse]]. Supply problems and a high rate of illness during the summer caused the Army to abandon several forts.<ref>Missall. Pp. 94-121.</ref>\n\nOn Dec. 28, 1835 Major Benjamine A. Putnam with a force of soldiers occupied the [[Bulow Plantation Ruins Historic State Park|Bulow Plantation]] and fortified it with cotton bales and a stockade. Local planters took refuge with their slaves. The Major abandoned the site on January 23, 1836, and the [[Bulow Plantation Ruins Historic State Park|Bulow Plantation]] was later burned by the Seminoles. Now a State Park, the site remains a window into the destruction of the conflict; the massive stone ruins of the huge Bulow sugar mill stand little changed from the 1830s. By February 1836 the Seminole and black allies had attacked 21 plantations along the river.\n\nMajor [[Ethan A. Hitchcock (general)|Ethan Allen Hitchcock]] was among those who found the remains of the Dade party in February. In his journal he wrote of the discovery and expressed his discontent:\n\n<blockquote>The government is in the wrong, and this is the chief cause of the persevering opposition of the Indians, who have nobly defended their country against our attempt to enforce a fraudulent treaty. The natives used every means to avoid a war, but were forced into it by the tyranny of our government.<ref>Hitchcock. pp.120\u2013131.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn November 21, 1836 at the [[Battle of Wahoo Swamp]], the Seminole fought against American allied forces numbering 2500, successfully driving them back.; among the American dead was [[David Moniac]], the first Native American graduate of [[West Point]]. The skirmish restored Seminole confidence, showing their ability to hold their ground against their old enemies the Creek and white settlers.\n\nLate in 1836, Major General [[Thomas Jesup]], US Quartermaster, was placed in command of the war. Jesup brought a new approach to the war. He concentrated on wearing the Seminoles down rather than sending out large groups who were more easily ambushed. He needed a large military presence in the state to control it, and he eventually brought a force of more than 9,000 men into the state under his command. About half of the force were volunteers and militia. It also included a brigade of Marines, and Navy and [[United States Revenue Cutter Service|Revenue-Marine]] personnel patrolling the coast and inland rivers and streams.<ref>Missall. pp. 122\u2013125.</ref>\n[[Image:Osceolaseized.jpg|thumb|300|Osceola was seized at the orders of Gen. [[Thomas Jesup]] when he appeared for a meeting under a white peace or \"parley\" flag.]]\n\nIn January 1837, the Army began to achieve more tangible successes, capturing or killing numerous Indians and blacks. At the end of January, some Seminole chiefs sent messengers to Jesup, and arranged a truce. In March a \"Capitulation\" was signed by several chiefs, including Micanopy, stipulating that the Seminole could be accompanied by their allies and \"their negroes, their ''bona fide'' property\", in their removal to the West. By the end of May, many chiefs, including Micanopy, had surrendered. Two important leaders, Osceola and [[Ar-pi-uck-i (Sam Jones)|Sam Jones]] (a.k.a. Abiaca, Ar-pi-uck-i, Opoica, Arpeika, Aripeka, Aripeika), had not surrendered, however, and were known to be vehemently opposed to relocation. On June 2 these two leaders with about 200 followers entered the poorly guarded holding camp at Fort Brooke and led away the 700 Seminoles who had surrendered. The war was on again, and Jesup decided against trusting the word of an Indian again. On Jesup's orders, Brigadier General [[Joseph Marion Hern\u00e1ndez]] commanded an expedition that captured several Indian leaders, including [[Wild Cat (Seminole)|Coacoochee]] (Wild Cat), [[John Horse]], Osceola and Micanopy when they appeared for conferences under a [[white flag]] of truce. Coacoochee and other captives, including John Horse, escaped from their cell at [[Fort Marion]] in St. Augustine,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Phillip Thomas|title=John Horse: Forgotten African-American Leader of the Second Seminole War|journal=The Journal of Negro History|year=1992|volume=77|issue=2 (Spring)|pages=74\u201383|doi=10.2307/3031484|jstor=3031484}}</ref> but Osceola did not go with them. He died in prison, probably of [[malaria]].<ref>Missall. pp. 126\u2013134, 140\u2013141.</ref>\n\nJesup organized a sweep down the peninsula with multiple columns, pushing the Seminoles further south. On Christmas Day 1837, Colonel [[Zachary Taylor]]'s column of 800 men encountered a body of about 400 warriors on the north shore of [[Lake Okeechobee]]. The Seminole were led by Sam Jones, Alligator and the recently escaped Coacoochee; they were well positioned in a [[Hammock (ecology)|hammock]] surrounded by [[Cladium|sawgrass]] with half a mile of swamp in front of it. On the far side of the hammock was Lake Okeechobee. Here the saw grass stood five feet high. The mud and water were three feet deep. Horses would be of no use. The Seminole had chosen their battleground. They had sliced the grass to provide an open field of fire and had notched the trees to steady their rifles. Their scouts were perched in the treetops to follow every movement of the troops coming up. As Taylor's army came up to this position, he decided to attack.\n\nAt about half past noon, with the sun shining directly overhead and the air still and quiet, Taylor moved his troops squarely into the center of the swamp. His plan was to attack directly rather than try to encircle the Indians. All his men were on foot. In the first line were the Missouri volunteers. As soon as they came within range, the Seminoles opened fire. The volunteers broke, and their commander Colonel Gentry, fatally wounded, was unable to rally them. They fled back across the swamp. The fighting in the saw grass was deadliest for five companies of the Sixth Infantry; every officer but one, and most of their noncoms, were killed or wounded. When those units retired a short distance to re-form, they found only four men of these companies unharmed. The US eventually drove the Seminoles from the hammock, but they escaped across the lake. Taylor lost 26 killed and 112 wounded, while the Seminoles casualties were eleven dead and fourteen wounded. The US claimed the [[Battle of Lake Okeechobee]] as a great victory.<ref>Mahon. P. 228.</ref><ref>Missall. pp. 138\u2013139, 142\u2013143.</ref>\n\nAt the end of January, Jesup's troops caught up with a large body of Seminoles to the east of Lake Okeechobee. Originally positioned in a hammock, the Seminoles were driven across a wide stream by cannon and rocket fire, and made another stand. They faded away, having inflicted more casualties than they suffered, and the [[Battle of Loxahatchee]] was over. In February 1838, the Seminole chiefs Tuskegee and Halleck Hadjo approached Jesup with the proposal to stop fighting if they could stay in the area south of Lake Okeechobee, rather than relocating west. Jesup favored the idea but had to gain approval from officials in Washington for approval. The chiefs and their followers camped near the Army while awaiting the reply. When the secretary of war rejected the idea, Jesup seized the 500 Indians in the camp, and had them transported to the Indian Territory.<ref>Missall. pp. 144\u2013147, 151.</ref>\n\nIn May, Jesup's request to be relieved of command was granted, and [[Zachary Taylor]] assumed command of the Army in Florida. With reduced forces, Taylor concentrated on keeping the Seminole out of northern Florida by building many small posts at twenty-mile (30&nbsp;km) intervals across the peninsula, connected by a grid of roads. The winter season was fairly quiet, without major actions. In Washington and around the country, support for the war was eroding. Many people began to think the Seminoles had earned the right to stay in Florida. Far from being over, the war had become very costly. President [[Martin Van Buren]] sent the Commanding General of the Army, [[Alexander Macomb (general)|Alexander Macomb]], to negotiate a new treaty with the Seminoles. On May 19, 1839, Macomb announced an agreement. In exchange for a reservation in southern Florida, the Seminoles would stop fighting.<ref>Missall. pp. 152, 157\u2013164.</ref>\n\n[[File:Seminole War in Everglades.jpg|thumb|250px|[[U.S. Marine]]s searching for the Indians during the Seminole War]]\n\nAs the summer passed, the agreement seemed to be holding. However, on July 23, some 150 Indians attacked a trading post on the [[Caloosahatchee River]]; it was guarded by a detachment of 23 soldiers under the command of Colonel [[William S. Harney]]. He and some soldiers escaped by the river, but the Seminoles killed most of the garrison, as well as several civilians at the post. Many blamed the \"Spanish\" Indians, led by Chakaika, for the attack, but others suspected Sam Jones, whose band of Mikasuki had agreed to the treaty with Macomb. Jones, when questioned, promised to turn the men responsible for the attack over to Harney in 33 days. Before that time was up, two soldiers visiting Jones' camp were killed.<ref>Missall. pp. 165\u2013168.</ref>\n\nThe Army turned to [[bloodhound]]s to track the Indians, with poor results. Taylor's blockhouse and patrol system in northern Florida kept the Seminoles on the move but could not clear them out. In May 1839, Taylor, having served longer than any preceding commander in the Florida war, was granted his request for a transfer and replaced by Brig. Gen. [[Walker Keith Armistead]]. Armistead immediately went on the offensive, actively campaigning during the summer. Seeking hidden camps, the Army also burned fields and drove off livestock: horses, cattle and pigs. By the middle of the summer, the Army had destroyed {{convert|500|acre|km2}} of Seminole crops.<ref>Missall. pp. 169\u2013181, 182\u20134.</ref><ref>Covington. pp. 98\u201399.</ref>\n\nThe Navy sent its sailors and Marines up rivers and streams, and into the [[Everglades]]. In late 1839 Navy Lt. John T. McLaughlin was given command of a joint Army-Navy amphibious force to operate in Florida. McLaughlin established his base at [[Tea Table Key]] in the upper [[Florida Keys]]. Traveling from December 1840 to the middle of January 1841, McLaughlin's force crossed the Everglades from east to west in dugout canoes, the first group of whites to complete a crossing.<ref>Buker. pp. 99\u2013101.</ref><ref>Mahon. p. 289.</ref> The Seminoles kept out of their way.\n\n===Indian Key===\n[[Indian Key State Historic Site|Indian Key]] is a small island in the upper [[Florida Keys]]. In 1840, it was the [[county seat]] of the newly created [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]], and a [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|wrecking]] port. Early in the morning of August 7, 1840, a large party of \"Spanish\" Indians sneaked onto Indian Key. By chance, one man was up and raised the alarm after spotting the Indians. Of about fifty people living on the island, forty were able to escape. The dead included Dr. [[Henry Perrine]], former United States [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] in [[Campeche, Campeche|Campeche]], [[Mexico]], who was waiting at Indian Key until it was safe to take up a 36-square mile (93&nbsp;km\u00b2) grant on the mainland that Congress had awarded to him.\n\nThe naval base on the Key was manned by a doctor, his patients, and five sailors under a midshipman. They mounted a couple of cannon on barges to attack the Indians. The Indians fired back at the sailors with musket balls loaded in cannon on the shore. The recoil of the cannon broke them loose from the barges, sending them into the water, and the sailors had to retreat. The Indians looted and burned the buildings on Indian Key. In December 1840, Col. Harney at the head of ninety men found Chakaika's camp deep in the Everglades. His force killed the chief and hanged some of the men in his band.<ref>Buker. pp. 106\u2013107.</ref><ref>Viele. pp. 33\u201335.</ref><ref>Mahon. pp. 283\u20134.</ref>\n\n===War winds down===\nArmistead received US$55,000 to use for bribing chiefs to surrender. Echo Emathla, a Tallahassee chief, surrendered, but most of the Tallahassee, under Tiger Tail, did not. Coosa Tustenuggee finally accepted US$5,000 for bringing in his 60 people. Lesser chiefs received US$200, and every warrior got US$30 and a rifle. By the spring of 1841, Armistead had sent 450 Seminoles west. Another 236 were at Fort Brooke awaiting transportation. Armistead estimated that 120 warriors had been shipped west during his tenure and that no more than 300 warriors remained in Florida.<ref>Mahon. pp. 282, 285\u20137.</ref>\n\n[[File:1842seminolereservation.png|thumb|250px|The remaining Seminoles in Florida were allowed to stay on an informal reservation in southwest Florida at the end of the Second Seminole War in 1842.]]\n\nIn May 1841, Armistead was replaced by Col. [[William Jenkins Worth]] as commander of Army forces in Florida. Worth had to cut back on the unpopular war: he released nearly 1,000 civilian employees and consolidated commands. Worth ordered his men out on \"search and destroy\" missions during the summer, and drove the Seminoles out of much of northern Florida.<ref>Knetsch. Pp. 128-131.<br>Mahon. P. 298.</ref>\n\nThe Army's actions became a war of attrition; some Seminole surrendered to avoid starvation. Others were seized when they came in to negotiate surrender, including, for the second time, Coacoochee. A large bribe secured Coacoochee's cooperation in persuading others to surrender.<ref>Mahon. pp. 298\u2013300.</ref><ref>Covington. pp. 103\u20136.</ref>\n\nIn the last action of the war, General William Bailey and prominent planter Jack Bellamy led a posse of 52 men on a three-day pursuit of a small band of Tiger Tail's braves who had been attacking settlers, surprising their swampy encampment and killing all 24. William Wesley Hankins, at sixteen the youngest of the posse, accounted for the last of the kills and was acknowledged as having fired the last shot of the Second Seminole War.<ref>D.B. McKay's \"Pioneer Florida\", \"Buckshot from 26 Shotguns Swept Band of Ferocious, Marauding Seminoles Off Face of The Earth\", The Tampa Tribune, June 27, 1954 p. 16-C</ref>\n\nAfter Colonel Worth recommended early in 1842 that the remaining Seminoles be left in peace, he received authorization to leave the remaining Seminoles on an informal reservation in southwestern Florida and to declare an end to the war.,<ref>Covington. Pp. 107-7.</ref> He announced it on August 14, 1842. In the same month, Congress passed the Armed Occupation Act, which provided free land to settlers who improved the land and were prepared to defend themselves from Indians. At the end of 1842, the remaining Indians in Florida living outside the reservation in southwest Florida were rounded up and shipped west. By April 1843, the Army presence in Florida had been reduced to one regiment. By November 1843, Worth reported that only about 95 Seminole men and some 200 women and children living on the reservation were left, and that they were no longer a threat.<ref>Mahon. pp. 313\u20134, 316\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nThe Second Seminole War may have cost as much as $40,000,000. More than 40,000 regular U.S. military, militiamen and volunteers served in the war. This Indian war cost the lives of 1,500 soldiers, mostly from disease. It is estimated that more than 300 regular U.S. Army, Navy and Marine Corps personnel were killed in action, along with 55 volunteers.<ref>Kohn, George Childs: ''Dictionary of Wars: Third Edition'' (p. 486)</ref> There is no record of the number of Seminole killed in action, but many homes and Indian lives were lost. A great many Seminole died of disease or starvation in Florida, on the journey west, and after they reached [[Indian Territory]]. An unknown but apparently substantial number of white civilians were killed by Seminole during the war.<ref>Mahon. pp. 321, 323, 325.<br>Missall. pp. 177, 204\u2013205.<br>Florida Board of State Institutions. P. 9.</ref>\n\n==Second Interbellum==\n[[File:Billy bowlegs harpers.jpg|thumb|[[Billy Bowlegs]], 1858]]\n\nPeace had come to Florida. The Indians were mostly staying on the reservation. Groups of ten or so men would visit Tampa to trade. Squatters were moving closer to the reservation, however, and in 1845 President [[James Polk]] established a {{convert|20|mi|km|adj=on}} wide buffer zone around the reservation. No land could be claimed within the buffer zone, no title would be issued for land there, and the [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] would remove squatters from the buffer zone upon request. In 1845, Thomas P. Kennedy, who operated a store at Fort Brooke, converted his fishing station on [[Pine Island (Lee County, Florida)|Pine Island]] into a trading post for the Indians. The post did not do well, however, because whites who sold whiskey to the Indians told them that they would be seized and sent west if they went to Kennedy's store.<ref>Covington. pp. 110\u20131.</ref>\n\nThe Florida authorities continued to press for removal of all Indians from Florida. The Indians for their part tried to limit their contacts with whites as much as possible. In 1846, Captain John T. Sprague was placed in charge of Indian affairs in Florida. He had great difficulty in getting the chiefs to meet with him. They were very distrustful of the Army since it had often seized chiefs while under a flag of truce. He did manage to meet with all of the chiefs in 1847, while investigating a report of a raid on a farm. He reported that the Indians in Florida then consisted of 120 warriors, including seventy Seminoles in [[Billy Bowlegs]]' band, thirty Mikasukis in Sam Jones' band, twelve Creeks (Muscogee speakers) in Chipco's band, 4 Yuchis and 4 Choctaws. He also estimated that there were 100 women and 140 children.<ref>Covington. pp. 112\u20134.</ref>\n\n===Indian attacks===\nThe trading post on Pine Island had burned down in 1848, and in 1849 Thomas Kennedy and his new partner, John Darling, were given permission to open a trading post on what is now [[Paynes Creek Historic State Park|Paynes Creek]], a tributary of the [[Peace River (Florida)|Peace River]]. One band of Indians was living outside the reservation at this time. Called \"outsiders\", it consisted of twenty warriors under the leadership of Chipco, and included five Muscogees, seven Mikasukis, six Seminoles, one Creek and one Yuchi. On July 12, 1849 four members of this band attacked a farm on the [[Indian River (Florida)|Indian River]] just north of Fort Pierce, killing one man and wounding another man and a woman. The news of this raid caused much of the population of the east coast of Florida to flee to St. Augustine. On July 17, four of the \"outsiders\" who had attacked the farm on the Indian River, plus a fifth man who had not been at Indian River, attacked the Kennedy and Darling store. Two workers at the store, including a Captain Payne, were killed, and another worker and his wife were wounded as they escorted their child into hiding.<ref>Covington. pp. 114\u20136.</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Army was not prepared to engage the Indians. It had few men stationed in Florida and no means to move them quickly to where they could protect the white settlers and capture the Indians. The War Department began a new buildup in Florida, placing Major General [[David E. Twiggs]] in command, and the state called up two companies of mounted volunteers to guard settlements. Captain John Casey, who was in charge of the effort to move the Indians west, was able to arrange a meeting between General Twiggs and several of the Indian leaders at Charlotte Harbor. At that meeting, Billy Bowlegs promised, with the approval of other leaders, to deliver the five men responsible for the attacks to the Army within thirty days. On October 18, Bowlegs delivered three of the men to Twiggs, along with the severed hand of another who had been killed while trying to escape. The fifth man had been captured but had escaped.<ref>Covington. pp. 116\u20138.</ref>\n\nAfter Bowlegs had delivered the three murderers, General Twiggs told the Indians, much to their dismay, that he had been ordered to remove them from Florida. The government would apply three tactics to carry out the removal. The Army in Florida was increased to 1,500 men. One hundred thousand dollars was appropriated for bribing Indians to move. Finally, a delegation of Seminole chiefs was brought from the Indian Territory to negotiate with their counterparts in Florida. Eventually a Mikasuki sub-chief, Kapiktoosootse, agreed to lead his people west. In February 1850, 74 Indians boarded ship for [[New Orleans]]. They were paid a total of US$15,953 in bribes and compensation for property left behind in Florida. There were a couple of incidents that soured relations after that. A Muskogee and a Mikasuki who had gone in to trade at the same time as Kapiktoosootse and his band were surrendering were involuntarily shipped off to New Orleans with them. Then, in March a mounted detachment of the Seventh Infantry penetrated far in the reservation. As a result, the other Indians broke off contact with the negotiators. By April, Twiggs was reporting to Washington that there was no hope of convincing any more Indians to move.<ref>Covington. pp. 118\u201321.</ref>\n\nIn August 1850, an orphan boy living on a farm in north central Florida was apparently killed by Indians. Eventually enough complaints about the incident had reached Washington to cause the secretary of war to order the surrender of the Indians responsible, or the president would hold the whole tribe responsible. Captain Casey was able to get word to Bowlegs and arrange a meeting in April. Bowlegs promised to deliver the men responsible, although they apparently were members of Chipco's band, over whom Bowlegs had no authority. Chipco decided to surrender three men as the possible killers, and they were arrested when they showed up to trade in Fort Myers. Once in custody, the three protested their innocence, saying that Chipco did not like them and that other men in Chipco's band were the actual killers, and Captain Casey believed them. The three men tried to escape from the jail in Tampa but were caught and chained up in their cell. They were later found hanging from the bars in their cell. One was still alive when found but was not cut down until the next day, after he had died. It was noted in the community that the constable who had chained the three men in their cell was the father-in-law of a brother of one of the men killed at the Kennedy and Darling store in 1849 (the Paynes Creek Massacre).<ref>Covington. pp. 122-3.</ref>\n\n===Further Indian removal===\nIn 1851, General [[Luther Blake]] was appointed by the Secretary of the Interior [[Thomas McKean Thompson McKennan]] to move the Indians west. Blake had successfully removed the [[Cherokee]] from Georgia and was presumed capable of the task of removing the Seminole. He had funding to pay every adult male $800 and every woman and child $450. He went to the Indian Territory to find interpreters and returned to Florida in March 1852. Traveling into the field to meet with all of the Indian leaders, by July he had found sixteen Seminole to send west. Finding [[Billy Bowlegs]] insistent on staying in Florida, Blake took Bowlegs and several other chiefs to Washington. President [[Millard Fillmore]] presented Bowlegs with a medal, and he and three other chiefs were persuaded to sign an agreement promising to leave Florida. The chiefs were taken on a tour that included [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]] and New York City. Upon returning to Florida, the chiefs repudiated the agreement they had signed in Washington. Blake was fired in 1853, and Captain Casey was put back in charge of Indian removal.<ref>Covington. pp. 123\u20136.</ref>\n\nIn January 1851, the Florida Legislature had created the position of commander of the Florida Militia, and Governor [[Thomas Brown (Florida politician)|Thomas Brown]] appointed [[Benjamin Hopkins]] to it. Over the next two years, the Florida Militia pursued Seminole who were outside the reservation boundaries. During this period the militia captured one man and a few women, and 140 hogs. One Seminole woman elder committed suicide while being held by the militia, after the rest of her family had escaped. The whole operation cost the state US$40,000.<ref>Covington. p. 126.</ref>\n\nPressure from Florida officials pushed the federal government to take action. Captain Casey continued to try to persuade the Seminole to move west without success. He sent Billy Bowlegs and others to Washington again, but the chiefs refused to agree to move. In August 1854, Secretary of War [[Jefferson Davis]] initiated a program to force the Seminole into a final conflict. The plan included a trade embargo against them, the survey and sale of land in southern Florida to European-American settlers, and a stronger Army presence to protect the new settlers. Davis said that if the Seminole did not agree to leave, the Army would use force.<ref>Covington. pp. 126\u20137.</ref>\n\n==Third Seminole War==<!-- This section is linked from [[Miami-Dade County, Florida]] -->\n\n===Increased Army presence and Indian attacks===\nBy late 1855, there were more than 700 Army troops stationed on the Florida peninsula. Around that time the Seminoles decided that they would strike back at the increasing pressure being put on them and attack when an opportunity presented itself. Sam Jones may have been the instigator of this decision; Chipco was said to have been against it. On December 7, 1855, First Lieutenant George Hartsuff, who had led previous patrols into the reservation, left Fort Myers with ten men and two wagons. They found no Seminoles but did pass corn fields and three deserted villages, including Billy Bowlegs' village. On the evening of December 19, Hartsuff told his men that they would be returning to Fort Myers the next day. As the men were loading the wagons and saddling their horses the next morning (December 20, 1855), forty Seminoles led by Billy Bowlegs attacked the camp. Several soldiers were shot, including Lieutenant Hartsuff, who managed to hide himself. The Seminoles killed and scalped four men in the camp, killed the wagon mules, looted and burned the wagons and took several horses. Seven men, four of them wounded, made it back to Fort Myers.<ref>Covington. pp. 128\u20139.</ref>\n\nWhen the news of the attack reached Tampa, the men of the city elected militia officers and organized companies. The newly formed militia marched to the Peace River valley, recruited more men, and manned some forts along the river. Governor [[James Broome]] started organizing as many volunteer companies as he could. Because the state had limited funds, he tried to have the Army accept the volunteers. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis accepted two infantry companies and three mounted companies, about 260 men. Governor Broome kept another 400 men mobilized under state control. The state troops, both those accepted by the Army and those remaining under state control, had been partly armed and supplied by private donations. General Jesse Carter was appointed by Governor Broome as \"special agent ... without military rank\" to lead the state troops. Carter set half of the state troops to growing crops, and so only 200 of his men were available for patrols. A Tampa newspaper noted that the mounted patrols preferred to patrol in open country, which was easier for the horses, but it allowed the Seminoles to see them coming.<ref>Covington. pp. 129\u201330.</ref>\n\nOn January 6, 1856, two men gathering [[Zamia integrifolia|coontie]] south of the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]] were killed. The settlers in the area promptly fled to Fort Dallas and [[Key Biscayne]]. A party of some twenty Seminoles under Ocsen Tustenuggee attacked a wood-cutting patrol outside of Fort Denaud, killing five of the six men. Despite the positioning of militia units to defend the area, the Seminoles also raided along the coast south of Tampa Bay. They killed one man and burned a house in what is now [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]], and on March 31, 1856, they tried to attack the \"Braden Castle\", the plantation home of Dr. Joseph Braden, in what is now [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]]. The \"Castle\" was too strong for them, but they led away seven slaves and three mules. Burdened with prisoners and loot, the Seminoles did not move fast. While they were stopped at [[Big Charley Apopka Creek]] eating barbecued beef from a cow they had found and slaughtered, the militia caught up with them. The militiamen killed two of the Seminoles and recaptured the slaves and mules taken from Dr. Braden's plantation. The scalp of one of the dead Seminoles was displayed in Tampa, the other in Manatee.<ref>Covington. pp. 130\u20132.</ref>\n\nDuring April, regular Army and militiamen patrolled around and into the reservation but made little contact with the Seminoles. One six-hour battle was fought near Bowlegs Town in April, with four regulars killed and three wounded before the Seminoles withdrew. The Seminoles continued to carry out small raids around the state. On May 14, 1856, fifteen Seminoles attacked the farm house of Captain Robert Bradley north of Tampa, killing two of his young children. One Seminole was killed by Bradley. Bradley may have been targeted because he had killed Tiger Tail's brother during the Second Seminole War. On May 17, Seminoles attacked a wagon train in central Florida, killing three men. Mail and stagecoach service in and out of Tampa was suspended until the military could provide protection.<ref>Covington. pp. 132\u20133.</ref>\n\nOn June 14, 1856, Seminoles attacked a farm {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} from Fort Meade. All of the household made it safely into the house, and they were able to hold the Seminoles at bay. The gunfire was heard at Fort Meade, and seven mounted militiamen responded. Three of the militiamen were killed and two others wounded. More militiamen pursued the Seminoles but had to retreat when a sudden rain wet their powder. On June 16, twenty militiamen from [[Fort Fraser (Florida)|Fort Fraser]] surprised a group of Seminoles along the Peace River, killing some of the Seminoles. The militiamen withdrew after losing two dead and three wounded. They claimed to have killed as many as twenty Seminoles, but the Indians admitted to only four dead and two wounded. However, one of the dead was Ocsen Tustenuggee, who seems to have been the only chief who would actively lead attacks against settlements.<ref>Covington. pp. 133\u20134.</ref>\n\nThe citizens of Florida were becoming disenchanted with the militia. There were complaints that the militiamen would pretend to patrol for a day or two and then go home to work their fields, and that they were given to idleness, drunkenness, and thievery. The officers were reported to be unwilling to submit required paperwork. Most importantly, the militia had failed to prevent attacks against settlers.<ref>Covington. pp. 134\u20135.</ref>\n\n===New strategy===\nIn September 1856, Brigadier General [[William S. Harney]] returned to Florida as commander of the federal troops. Remembering the lessons he had learned in the Second Seminole War, he set up a system of forts in a line across Florida, and patrols moved deep into Seminole territory. He planned to confine the Seminoles to the Big Cypress Swamp and the Everglades, because he believed they would be unable to live there during the wet season. He anticipated being able to catch the Indians when they left their flooded sanctuaries seeking dry land for raising their crops. Part of Harney's plan involved using boats to reach islands and other dry spots in the swamps. He first made one more attempt to negotiate with the Seminoles but was unable to make contact with them. In early January 1857, he ordered his troops to actively pursue the Indians. Harney's plan, however, had shown few results by the time he and the Fifth Infantry were transferred to [[Kansas]] to aid in the [[Bleeding Kansas|uprisings]] there in April.<ref>Covington. pp. 135\u20136.</ref>\n\nColonel [[Gustavus Loomis]] replaced General Harney as commander in Florida, but the withdrawal of the Fifth Infantry left him with only ten companies of the Fourth Artillery, which was later reduced to just four companies. Loomis organized volunteers into boat companies, which were given metal \"alligator boats\" that had been built earlier specifically for use in the Big Cypress Swamp and Everglades. {{convert|30|ft|m|spell=In}} long, pointed at both ends, and drawing two to {{convert|3|ft|m|spell=in}} of water, the boats could carry up to sixteen men into the swamps. These boat companies were able to capture many Indians, primarily women and children. The regulars did not do as well. Some officers, including Captain [[Abner Doubleday]], observed that the Seminoles easily avoided the Army patrols. Doubleday attributed this to the fact that most of the enlisted men were recent immigrants who had no skills in [[wikt:woodcraft|woodcraft]].<ref>Covington. pp. 135\u201340.</ref>\n\nIn 1857, ten companies of Florida militia were taken into federal service, totaling almost 800 men by September. In November these troops captured eighteen women and children from Billy Bowlegs' band. The troops also found and destroyed several towns and fields of crops. The troops moved into the Big Cypress Swamp starting on [[New Year's Day]] 1858, again destroying the towns and cultivated fields they found. Another delegation from the Indian Territory arrived in Florida in January and attempted to contact Bowlegs. The troops stood down while the attempt was made, and Bowlegs was contacted. The previous year the Seminoles had finally been given their own reservation in Indian Territory separate from the Creeks. Cash payments of US$500 to each warrior (more to the chiefs) and $100 to each woman were promised. On March 15, Bowlegs' and Assinwar's bands accepted the offer and agreed to go west. On May 4, a total of 163 Seminoles (including some captured earlier) were shipped to New Orleans. On May 8, 1858, Colonel Loomis declared the war to be over.<ref>Covington. pp. 140\u20133.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nWhen Colonel Loomis declared an end to the Third Seminole War, the government believed that only about 100 Seminole were left in Florida, though there were probably more. In December 1858, the US recruited two bands totaling 75 people, who agreed to removal to the West; they were shipped out on February 15, 1859. Seminoles remained in Florida, however. Sam Jones' band was living in southeast Florida, inland from Miami and Fort Lauderdale. Chipco's band was living north of Lake Okeechobee, although the Army and militia had failed to locate it. And small bands consisting of a family or two were scattered across the wetlands of southern Florida.\n\nSince the war was officially over and the remaining Seminole carefully avoided contact with settlers, the government sent the militia home and reassigned most of the regular Army troops, leaving only small contingents in larger coastal forts such as Fort Brooke. Most of the smaller forts scattered across the Florida wilderness were decommissioned and soon stripped by settlers of any usable material.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate government of Florida]] contacted Sam Jones with promises of aid to keep the Seminole from fighting on the side of the Union. The state did not follow through on its promises, but the Seminole were not interested in fighting another war and remained neutral.\n\nThe [[Florida Constitution#The 1868 Florida Constitution|1868 Florida Constitution]], developed by the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] legislature, gave the Seminole one seat in the house and one seat in the senate of the state legislature. The Seminole never filled the positions. In 1885, legislature passed a new constitution removing the seats for Seminoles and established barriers to voter registration and electoral practices that essentially [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] most blacks and minorities, including Native Americans.<ref>Covington. pp. 145\u20136.</ref> This situation lasted until the passage of federal civil rights and voting legislation in the mid-1960s, which provided for the enforcement of citizens' constitutional rights, and the adoption of Florida's current state constitution in 1968.\n\n===Modern times===\nA small number of Seminoles continued to live in relative isolation in the Lake Okeechobee and Everglades region into the 20th Century. Flood control and drainage projects beginning in the late 1800s opened up more land for development and significantly altered the natural environment, inundating some areas while leaving former swamps dry and arable. These projects, along with the completion of the [[Tamiami Trail]] which bisected the Everglades in 1928, simultaneously ended old ways of life and introduced new opportunities. A steady stream of white developers and tourists came to the area, and the Seminoles began to work in local farms, ranches, and souvenir stands.\n\nIn the 1940s, Seminoles living across the state began moving to reservations and establishing official tribal governments to form ties with the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]]. In 1957, most Seminoles established formal relations with the US government as the [[Seminole Tribe of Florida]], which is headquartered in [[Hollywood, Florida]] and control the [[Big Cypress Indian Reservation]], [[Brighton Reservation]], Fort Pierce Reservation, [[Hollywood Reservation]], Immokalee Reservation, and [[Tampa Reservation]].<ref>''Atlas of the North American Indian'', 3rd ed.

Quote: \"The greatest lesson of the Second Seminole War shows how a government can lose public support for a war that has simply lasted for too long. As the Army became more deeply involved in the conflict, as the government sent more troops into the theater, and as the public saw more money appropriated for the war, people began to lose their interest. Jesup's capture of Osceola, and the treachery he used to get him, turned public sentiment against the Army. The use of blood hounds only created more hostility in the halls of Congress. It did not matter to the American people that some of Jesup's deceptive practices helped him achieve success militarily. The public viewed his actions so negatively that he had undermined the political goals of the government.\"\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051214121412/http://floridamemory.com/FloridaHighlights/Seminole_War/ Letter Concerning the Outbreak of Hostilities in the Third Seminole War, 1856], from the State Library and Archives of Florida.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050129151754/http://fn1.tfn.net/~cdk901/index.html \"Tour of the Florida Territory during the Seminole (Florida) Wars, 1792-1859\"], from Jacob K.

Medical organizations have more than 40 thousand devices for artificial lung ventilation, 124 devices for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The government of the Russian Federation has allocated resources for the additional purchase of more than 500 devices, including 17 ECMO devices. Today, 6 thousand infectious diseases doctors and almost 2 thousand pulmonologists, more than 18 thousand nurses are ready to provide medical assistance.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://government.ru/news/39218/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200321055046/http://government.ru/news/39218/ |archive-date=21 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[OECD]], Russia ranks third in the number of beds per capita. However, bed equipment varies from hospital to hospital. In terms of equipment \u2014 for example, CT and MRI devices \u2014 Russia is in 28th place with a dramatic gap from the leaders. [[Rosstat]] does not publish data on the number of places in intensive care units and equipment. In total, there are 1 million 172 thousand beds in Russian hospitals, according to Rosstat data for 2018. These include intensive care units. Intensive care bed means a bed equipped with a set of equipment for resuscitation and intensive care, including ventilators. The Institute of Phthisiopulmonology and infectious diseases of the Ministry of Health estimated the number of intensive care beds at just 12 thousand, which is three times less than the Ministry of Health's standard. The proekt.media website was able to find data on the number of intensive care beds in only 23 regions. Only Moscow, Kalmykia, Altai and Komi reached the standard of 3%. Other regions are significantly below the standard.<br/>Separate ventilators in hospitals should be more than intensive care beds. The number of ventilators in a region should be at least 1.5 times more than the number of intensive care beds. There are no official statistics on the number of ventilators. Federal authorities with the beginning of the epidemic conducted their own calculations: Deputy Prime Minister [[Tatyana Golikova]] said that Russia has 40 thousand ventilators. This is 3.4% of the total number of beds in Russia, and more than 12 thousand devices are missing from the standards of the Ministry of health. This is a total deficit of 23%, but in some regions it is much larger. The website asks, can we be sure that all the devices included in the statistics are in working order? 58% of ventilators are more than 9 years old. Components may require more frequent replacement. For example, the oxygen sensor of the American model common in Russia, [[Puritan Bennett]], is subject to replacement every two years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.proekt.media/research/koronavirus-regiony/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200404095318/https://www.proekt.media/research/koronavirus-regiony/ |archive-date=4 April 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nData collected by the news website [[Meduza]] indicates that Russia's supply of ventilators is quite extensive: Even the number available per capita in some geographically peripheral regions, not to mention Moscow, significantly exceeds ventilator supplies in Western countries.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/03/21/the-ventilator-problem |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200326174233/https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/03/21/the-ventilator-problem |archive-date=26 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n{{Collapse top}}\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| label_type  = REGION\n| data_type   = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| bar_width   = 50\n| width_units = em\n| data_max    = 57\n\n| label1   = \nKhanty-Mansi AO\n| data1    = \n56.8\n\n| label2   = \nSamara region\n| data2    = \n42.6\n\n| label3   = \nAmur region\n| data3    = \n42.5\n\n| label4   = \nMoscow (city)\n| data4    = \n40\n\n| label5   = \nKirov region\n| data5    = \n39.6\n\n| label6   = \nArkhangelsk region\n| data6    = \n38.4\n\n| label7   = \nSakha Republic (Yakutia)\n| data7    = \n37.2\n\n| label8   = \nSakhalin region\n| data8    = \n37.1\n\n| label9   = \nTomsk region\n| data9    = \n37.1\n\n| label10   = \nSt. Petersburg (city)\n| data10    = \n35.2\n\n| label11   = \nLipetsk region\n| data11    = \n35.1\n\n| label12   = \nSverdlovsk region\n| data12    = \n35\n\n| label13   = \nChuvash Republic (Chuvashia)\n| data13    = \n34.7\n\n| label14   = \nAltai Krai\n| data14    = \n34.6\n\n| label15   = \nRepublic of Crimea (status disputed)\n| data15    = \n34.3\n\n| label16   = \nRepublic of Karelia\n| data16    = \n32.5\n\n| label17   = \nYaroslavl region\n| data17    = \n31.5\n\n| label18   = \nVladimir region\n| data18    = \n31.4\n\n| label19   = \nTambov region\n| data19    = \n31.2\n| label20   = \nPenza region\n| data20    = \n30.7\n\n| label21   = \nMurmansk region\n| data21    = \n30.5\n\n| label22   = \nPskov region\n| data22    = \n30.3\n\n| label23   = \nRepublic of Tatarstan\n| data23    = \n28.2\n| label24   = \nOrenburg region\n| data24    = \n27.7\n\n| label25   = \n'''Russia'''\n| data25    = \n27.3\n\n| label26   = \nKemerovo region\n| data26    = \n27.3\n\n| label27   = \nRyazan region\n| data27    = \n27.1\n\n| label28   = \nIrkutsk region\n| data28    = \n26.5\n\n| label29   = \nRepublic of Bashkortostan (Bashkiria)\n| data29    = \n25.5\n\n| label30   = \nRepublic of Buryatia\n| data30    = \n24.9\n\n}}\n\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| label_type  = REGION\n| data_type   = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| bar_width   = 50\n| width_units = em\n| data_max    = 57\n\n| label1   = \nKrasnoyarsk Krai\n| data1    = \n24.6\n\n| label2   = \nChelyabinsk region\n| data2    = \n24.5\n\n| label3   = \nAstrakhan region\n| data3    = \n23.9\n\n| label4   = \nZabaikalsky Krai\n| data4    = \n22.8\n\n| label5   = \nSaratov region\n| data5    = \n22.1\n\n| label6   = \nVologda region\n| data6    = \n22.1\n\n| label7   = \nKursk region\n| data7    = \n21.9\n\n| label8   = \nOrel region\n| data8    = \n21.8\n\n| label9   = \nMari El Republic\n| data9    = \n20.9\n\n| label10   = \nNovosibirsk region\n| data10    = \n20.4\n\n| label11   = \nTula region\n| data11    = \n20.3\n\n| label12   = \nUdmurt Republic (Udmurtia)\n| data12    = \n20.2\n\n| label13   = \nPerm Krai\n| data13    = \n20\n\n| label14   = \nKostroma region\n| data14    = \n19.1\n\n| label15   = \n'''United States'''\n| data15    = \n18.8\n\n| label16   = \nKaliningrad region\n| data16    = \n18.8\n\n| label17   = \nOmsk region\n| data17    = \n18.7\n\n| label18   = \nIvanovo region\n| data18    = \n17.9\n\n| label19   = \nKrasnodar Krai\n| data19    = \n17.6\n\n| label20   = \nBelgorod region\n| data20    = \n16.8\n\n| label21   = \nRostov region\n| data21    = \n15.3\n\n| label22   = \nVoronezh region\n| data22    = \n15\n\n| label23   = \nLeningrad region\n| data23    = \n14.3\n\n| label24   = \n'''United Kingdom'''\n| data24    = \n12.9\n\n| label25   = \nSevastopol (city;

plots above are charts showing the exponential growth of cases. The plots below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all y axes in order to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.\n\n{{Graph:Chart\n|type=line\n|linewidth=1\n|showSymbols=1\n|width=800\n|height=400<!--height = 80 X <no. of log10 cycles in y

Medical organizations have more than 40 thousand devices for artificial lung ventilation, 124 devices for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The government of the Russian Federation has allocated resources for the additional purchase of more than 500 devices, including 17 ECMO devices. Today, 6 thousand infectious diseases doctors and almost 2 thousand pulmonologists, more than 18 thousand nurses are ready to provide medical assistance.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://government.ru/news/39218/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200321055046/http://government.ru/news/39218/ |archive-date=21 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[OECD]], Russia ranks third in the number of beds per capita. However, bed equipment varies from hospital to hospital. In terms of equipment \u2014 for example, CT and MRI devices \u2014 Russia is in 28th place with a dramatic gap from the leaders. [[Rosstat]] does not publish data on the number of places in intensive care units and equipment. In total, there are 1 million 172 thousand beds in Russian hospitals, according to Rosstat data for 2018. These include intensive care units. Intensive care bed means a bed equipped with a set of equipment for resuscitation and intensive care, including ventilators. The Institute of Phthisiopulmonology and infectious diseases of the Ministry of Health estimated the number of intensive care beds at just 12 thousand, which is three times less than the Ministry of Health's standard. The proekt.media website was able to find data on the number of intensive care beds in only 23 regions. Only Moscow, Kalmykia, Altai and Komi reached the standard of 3%. Other regions are significantly below the standard.<br/>Separate ventilators in hospitals should be more than intensive care beds. The number of ventilators in a region should be at least 1.5 times more than the number of intensive care beds. There are no official statistics on the number of ventilators. Federal authorities with the beginning of the epidemic conducted their own calculations: Deputy Prime Minister [[Tatyana Golikova]] said that Russia has 40 thousand ventilators. This is 3.4% of the total number of beds in Russia, and more than 12 thousand devices are missing from the standards of the Ministry of health. This is a total deficit of 23%, but in some regions it is much larger.

plots above are charts showing the exponential growth of cases. The plots below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all y axes in order to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.\n\n{{Graph:Chart\n|type=line\n|linewidth=1\n|showSymbols=1\n|width=800\n|height=400<!--height = 80 X <no. of log10 cycles in y
