The two essential wings of the League were the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] and the [[International Labour Organization]].\n\nThe relations between the Assembly and the Council were not explicitly defined, and their competencies -- with a few exceptions -- were much the same. Each organ would deal with any matter within the sphere of competence of the League or affecting the peace in the world. Particular questions or tasks might be referred either to the Council or the Assembly. Reference might be passed on from one body to another.\n\n==Constitutional organs==\n\n===Permanent Secretariat ===\n\nThe Permanent Secretariat -- established at the seat of the League at Geneva -- comprised a body of experts in various spheres under the direction of the [[Secretary General|General Secretary]].\n\n====Organisation====\nThe principal Sections of the Secretariat were: Political; Financial and Economics; Communications and Transit; Minorities and Administration (Saar and Danzig); Mandates; Disarmament; Health; Social (Opium and Traffic in Women and Children); Intellectual Cooperation and International Bureaux; Legal; and Information. Each Section was responsible for all official secretarial work related to its particular subject and prepared and organized all meetings and conferences held in that connection.\n\n====Competencies====\nThe staff of the League's secretariat was responsible for preparing the agenda for the Council and Assembly and publishing reports of the meetings and other routine matters, effectively acting as the [[civil service]] for the League. The secretariat was often considered to be too small to handle all of the League's administrative affairs. For example, the total number of officials classed as members of the Secretariat was 75 in September 1924. The total staff, including all the clerical services, comprised about 400 persons.\n\n====Classification and distribution of documents====\nIn general, the League documents may be classified into the following categories: document on public sale, documents not on public sale, and classified, e.g., confidential and secret.\n\nThe specific feature of the documents emanating from the League of Nations was their classification according to the persons they were addressed to and not according to their subjects.\n\n=====General indications=====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In practice the Assembly had become the general directing force of League activities.\n\n====Organisation of the First Assembly====\nThe Plenary Meetings of the First Assembly were held from 15 November to 18 December in Geneva, Switzerland.<ref name=\"League of Nations 1920\"/> At the opening session, there were 41 states (out of 42 Member states). Six states were admitted during the meetings and consequently were represented during the session (Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Finland and Luxembourg). In total, thirty one plenary meeting were held. The principal questions during the first session were: organization of the Secretariat, establishment of a new Organization to deal with Health question, new organism to deal with Communication and transit, and a new Economic and Financial Organization, admission of new Member states, relations between the Council and the Assembly, nomination of the non-permanent Members of the Council, establishment of the Permanent Court of International Justice, the first and second budgets of the League, conflict between Poland and Soviet Russia, repatriation of prisoners of war, etc.\n\n=====President=====\nHE M.

This general regulation concerning unanimity was the recognition of national sovereignty.\n\nThe League sought solution by consent and not by dictation.\nHowever, in case of the dispute, the consent of the parties to the dispute was not required for unanimity. Where the reference of a dispute was made to the Assembly, a decision required the consent of the majority only of the Assembly, but including all the Members of the Council.\n\n==Other bodies==\nThe Covenant implied the establishment of auxiliary bodies for various questions of a more or less technical character.\nThe League oversaw the Permanent Court of International Justice, the [[International Labour Organization]] and several other agencies and commissions created to deal with pressing international problems. These included the [[arms control|Disarmament]] Commission, the [[World Health Organization|Health Organization]], the [[League of Nations mandate|Mandates]] Commission, the [[International Commission on Intellectual Cooperation]] (precursor to [[UNESCO]]), the Permanent Central [[Opium]] Board, the Commission for [[Refugee]]s, and the [[Slavery]] Commission.  Several of these institutions were transferred to the [[United Nations]] after the [[Second World War]]; the International Labour Organization, the Permanent Court of International Justice (as the [[International Court of Justice]]), and the Health Organization (restructured as the [[World Health Organization]]) all became UN institutions.\n\n===Permanent Court of International Justice===\nThe Permanent Court of International Justice was provided for by the Covenant, but not established by it. The Council and Assembly established its constitution. Its judges were elected by the Council and Assembly, and its budget was provided by the Assembly. The composition of the Court was of eleven judges and four deputy-judges, elected for nine years.\nThe Court had been competent to hear and to determine any international dispute which the parties concerned submitted to it. The Court might also give an advisory opinion upon any dispute or question referred to it by the Council or the Assembly.\nThe Court was open to all the nations of the world under certain broad conditions. Questions of fact as well as questions of law might be submitted.\n\n===International Labour Organization===\n{{Main|International Labour Organization}}\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO) was created in 1919 on the basis of part XIII of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and became part of the League's operations.<ref name=\"Northedge17980\">Northedge 1986, pp. 179\u201380</ref>\n\nThe ILO, although having the same Members as the League and subjected to the budget control of the Assembly, was an autonomous organisation with its own Governing Body, its own General Conference and its own Secretariat. Its constitution was different from that of the League: representation had been accorded not only to Governments but to representatives of employers and workers' organisations.\n\n===Organisations arising from the Covenant===\nThe Covenant left a broad discretion to the Council and the Assembly in constituting the auxiliary organs.\nThe accomplishment of the numerous tasks delegated to the League necessitated the creation of two main types of auxiliary bodies:<br />\n\u2022\tTechnical organizations dealing with finance and economics, transit, and health; and <br />\n\u2022\tAdvisory committees, dealing with military questions, disarmament, mandates, traffic in women and children, intellectual cooperation etc.\n\n====Health Organization====\nThe League's health organisation had three bodies, a Health Bureau, containing permanent officials of the League, an [[Executive (government)|executive]] section the General Advisory Council or Conference consisting of medical experts, and a Health Committee.  The Committee's purpose was to conduct inquiries, oversee the operation of the League's health work, and get work ready to be presented to the Council.<ref>Northedge 1986, p. 182</ref> This body focused on ending [[leprosy]], [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]], the latter two by starting an international campaign to exterminate [[mosquito]]es. The Health Section was also a body in the Health Organisation. The Health section worked with countries that were not members of the League of Nations. The Health Organisation also worked successfully with the government of the [[Soviet Union]] to prevent [[typhus]] epidemics including organising a large education campaign about the disease.<ref>Baumslag 2005, p. 8</ref> \n\n====[[Permanent Mandates Commission]]====\nSince the beginning of its work, the League has been called upon, as one of its political, administrative and humanitarian duties, to exercise a sort of indirect guardianship over certain people not yet able to stand by themselves. Indeed, the Art. 22 of the Covenant entrusted the mandate to administer these territories to \"advanced nations\" who \"can best undertake this responsibility\".\nThe principle of the \"well-being and development\" was to be the guideline of all the Powers governing native people.\n\nVarious mandates\n\nThe Mandate Commission\n\nSupervision and execution of the Mandates\n\nResults of the Mandate system\n\n====Economic and Financial Organization====\nAfter the end of the war, the economic and financial conditions in all European countries were close to total collapse. Within this context, the League organized a large conference in Brussels in September \u2013 October 1920. The goal was to find a solution to monetary problems and facilitate the circulation of goods and funds.\nFollowing the conference the League established an Economic and Financial Organisation, including several Committees (Financial, Economic, Fiscal, Statistical).\nDuring the following years the League assisted many European countries: Austria, Hungary, Greece, Bulgaria, etc.<br />\nThe Fiscal Committee discussed several general issues related to double taxation and tax evasion.\nThe works of the Economic Committee comprised the treatment of foreign nationals and enterprises, abolition of the prohibition and restrictions on imports and exports, unification of customs nomenclature, bill of exchange, unification of statistical methods, trade policy, veterinary medicines, international industrial agreements, problems of coal, sugar problems, issue of smuggling in general and alcohol, in particular, and indirect protectionism.<br />\nIn October 1929 the Great Depression started in the US and soon contaminated Europe. In 1933, the LON organized a new Economic Conference in London to find a common solution to the protection of national economies.\nThe conflict between the international political goals of the major powers and their views on economic welfare prevented from any concerted solution.\n\n====Transit, Transport and Communications====\nThe rapid growth in communications and transit, by land, sea and air, has led to rapidly expanding technical activities of the League regarding those issues. The introduction of mass production systems organised into assembly lines and based on standardised models, hugely contributed to the development of transport and communications. The LON created its Organisation for Communication and Transit in 1921. Its General Conference included all Member States while the Committee had 18 members.\nThe conferences of Barcelona 1921, and Geneva 1923 concluded with conventions on the international regulation of maritime ports, waterways, and railroads. Technical assistance was provided to Member states as well as help with arbitration disputes concerning transit. The Organisation for Communication and Transit accomplished useful works and made laws that will be retained in the future work of the United Nations.\n\n====International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation====\n{{Main|International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation}}\nThe League of Nations had devoted serious attention to the question of international intellectual cooperation since its creation. The First Assembly (December 1920) recommended that the Council should take action aiming at international organisation of intellectual work. The Council adopted report presented by the Fifth Committee of the Second Assembly and invited a distinguished Committee on Intellectual Cooperation to meet in Geneva, August 1922.\nThe Programme of work of the Committee included: enquiry into the conditions of intellectual life, assistance to countries whose intellectual life was endangered, creation of National Committees for intellectual cooperation, cooperation with international intellectual organisations, protection of intellectual property, inter-university cooperation, coordination of bibliographical work and international interchange of publications, and international cooperation in archaeological research.\n\nThe International Commission for Intellectual Cooperation was created in 1922. Its first president, [[Henri Bergson]], participated together with many distinguished people in improving conditions of intellectual workers and facilitating contacts.\nFrom 1926 the Commission was included in the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation, established in Paris.\nThe cinema was also considered as a useful tool to bring minds together. The International Educational Cinematographic Institute was created in Roma after a proposal from the Italian government and placed under the League's supervision. Although serving under a fascist government, it carried out considerable work promoting the peaceful ideal and the spirit of international cooperation.\n\n====Permanent Central Opium Board====\nThe supervision of the traffic in opium and other dangerous drugs may be considered as one of the most important social and humanitarian activity of the League.<br />\nBefore the creation of the League, there existed an international Convention \u2013 the Hague Convention of 1912 \u2013 that never entered into force.\n\nThe signatories of the Treaty of Versailles agreed by Art. 295 to ratify it, ipso facto. The Convention imposed, for the first time, certain obligations for regulating the trade in and production of drugs, on the contracting parties.<br />\nThe League appointed an Advisory Committee of Experts, and instructed the Secretariat to collect full information on the steps taken to apply the 1912 Convention.\n\nThe Geneva Convention of 1925 supplemented and extended that of The Hague. It rendered the import certificates compulsory, and provided for more effective supervision of production and international trade.<br />\nThe Convention further provided for the setting up of a Permanent Central Opium Board. The Board was set up in 1928, and build up the international system of control.\n\nIn 1931 the Assembly summoned a Conference that deliberated in favor of limiting the national manufacturing of narcotics as the only way to make sure that no margin was left for illicit traffic.\n\n====Advisory Committee on the Traffic in Women and Children====\nThe rapid development of international transport during the 19th century, not only increased the number of emigrants, but also enabled traffickers of women to organize their despicable trade on more ambitious, almost worldwide lines. <br />\nBy 1910 the states undertook to punish traffickers, even if they had committed offenses in other countries.<br />\nThe league joined its efforts to those of private organizations and governments. An enquiry was held and the league set to work to secure an extension of state obligations. <br />\nIn 1921 a convention was adopted strengthening the measures against trafficking. The Committee on the Traffic in Women and Children was created. The annual reports of governments, combined with those of big private organizations working on parallel lines, enabled the committee to carry on its work of coordination and supervision.\n\n====Slavery Commission====\nThe league has considered the problem of slavery and set about securing information from various governments since 1922. \nFew years later, a convention was drawn up in view of hastening the total abolition of slavery and the slave trade. The [[1926 Slavery Convention|Slavery Convention of 25 September 1926]] produced good results in many territories.<br />\nIn 1932, in the league review of the convention implementation, appeared that cases of capture of free men still occurred in some areas, and that slave-markets existed in several countries. \nThe assembly decided therefore to appoint a permanent advisory committee to study the facts and the institutions related to slavery, and to consider means of eliminating them.\n\n====Commission for Refugees====\nIn 1921 they helped to assist the approximately 1.5 million people who fled the Russian Revolution of 1917.\nIn April 1920, there were more than half a million [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], most of them in [[Russia]], waiting to be repatriated in extremely bad conditions. The Council of the League asked the famous explorer from [[Norway]], [[Fridtjof Nansen]] to examine the situation. Nansen took immediate steps and in less than two years managed to repatriate more than 427, 000 prisoners of war to 26 different countries. <br />\nThe League established a Commission for Refugees in 1921 and Nansen was the first High Commissioner. In autumn 1922 [[Fridtjof Nansen]] was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].<br />\nThe Commission also established the [[Nansen passport]] as a means of identification for [[Stateless person|stateless]] peoples.{{sfn|Torpey|2000|p=129}}\n\n====Disarmament Commission====\nThe Conference for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments of 1932\u20131934 (sometimes World Disarmament Conference or Geneva Disarmament Conference) was an effort by member states of the League of Nations, together with the U.S., to actualize the ideology of disarmament. It took place in the Swiss city of Geneva, ostensibly between 1930 and 1934, but more correctly until May 1937.\n\nThe first effort at international arms limitation was made at the Hague Conferences of 1899 and 1907, which had failed in their primary objective. Although many contemporary commentators (and Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles) had blamed the outbreak of the First World War on the war guilt of Germany, historians writing in the 1930s began to emphasize the fast-paced arms race preceding 1914. Further, all the major powers except the US had committed themselves to disarmament in both the Treaty of Versailles and the Covenant of the League of Nations. A substantial international non-governmental campaign to promote disarmament also developed in the 1920s and early 1930s.\n\nA preparatory commission was initiated by the League in 1925; by 1931, there was sufficient support to hold a conference, which duly began under the chairmanship of former British Foreign Secretary Arthur Henderson. The motivation behind the talks can be summed up by an extract from the message President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent to the conference: \"If all nations will agree wholly to eliminate from possession and use the weapons which make possible a successful attack, defences automatically will become impregnable and the frontiers and independence of every nation will become secure.\"\n\nThe talks were beset by a number of difficulties from the outset. Among these were disagreements over what constituted \"offensive\" and \"defensive\" weapons, and the polarization of France and Germany. The increasingly military-minded German governments could see no reason why their country could not enjoy the same level of armaments as other powers, especially France. The French, for their part, were equally insistent that German military inferiority was their only insurance from future conflict as serious as they had endured in the First World War. As for the British and US governments, they were unprepared to offer the additional security commitments that France requested in exchange for limitation of French armaments.\n\nThe talks broke down and Hitler withdrew Germany from both the Conference and the League of Nations in October 1933. The 1930s had proved far too self-interested an international period to accommodate multilateral action in favour of pacifism.\n\n====Committee for the Study of the Legal Status of Women====\n\nIn 1935, the League of Nations Assembly decided to conduct a study of women's legal status \"around the world\" as a response to pressure by women's organizations pressing for an international treaty of women's equal rights. The assembly resolved to consider how \"the terms of the Equal Rights Treaty should be examined in relation to existing political, civil and economic status of women under the laws of countries around the world.\"\n\nTo conduct this study, the Committee for the Study of the Legal Status of Women was appointed to design a questionnaire to submit to three scientific institutes: the Institut de Droit Compar\u00e9 and the Institut de Droit Penal in Paris and the Institute of Private Law at Rome. The Institute de Droit Compar\u00e9 was enlisted to study women's franchise, access to educational facilities and similar questions. The Institut de Droit Penal was assigned questions of penal and criminal laws related to women, and the Institute of Private Law focused on divorce, domicile rights and similar questions. Additionally, after much discussion, the Committee agreed to employ interested women's organizations who had already been conducting studies on the legal status of women for some time. While the work was left incomplete because of the outbreak of the Second World War, the study provided a foundation upon which the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women would organize its work after 1946.\n\nThe first meeting of the Committee of Experts for the Study of the Legal Status of Women Around the World was held in Geneva on 4 April 1938. They met again in January 1939 before disbanding. The members were Mme. [[Suzanne Bastid]] of France, professor of law at the University of Lyon; M. de Ruelle of Belgium, legal adviser for the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration; Mme. Anka Godjevac of Yugoslavia, adviser of the Yugoslav delegation at the 1930 Codification Conference; Mr. H. C. Gutteridge of the United Kingdom, professor of comparative law at the University of Cambridge. Gutteridge was elected chair of the Committee; Mlle. Kerstin Hesselgren of Sweden, member of the Second Chamber of the Swedish Riksdag and Rapporteur of the Committee; Ms. Dorothy Kenyon of the United States, doctor of law, member of the New York Bar and legal adviser to a number of national organizations; M. Paul Sebasteyan of Hungary, counselor and head of the Treatise Division the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Mr. McKinnon Wood of the United Kingdom who served as Secretariat of the Committee.\n<ref>{{cite book|last=See United States Department of Labor|title=International Documents on the Status of Women|year=1947|publisher=U.

These articles were replaced by Articles 37\u201345 of the new Treaty of Lausanne.\n\n==Finances of the League==\nThe [[League of Nations]] was maintained financially by the Member States.\nThe Assembly controlled the annual budget.\n\nThe total authorized League budgets for the four years 1921\u20131924 gave an average of 22 757 769 gold francs per year, equivalent to 4 391 187 American dollars.\nThis figure covered not only the League of Nations but also the cost of the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] and the [[International Labour Organization]].\n\nThe average share of the budget for this period was:\n\nLeague of Nations: 2 178 445 American dollars at par;\n\nInternational Labour Organization: 1 350 675 American dollars;\n\nPermanent Court of International Justice: 386 000 American dollars.<ref>{{Cite book|last=League of Nations |title=Official Journal, January, 1924|publisher=League of Nations |year=1924 }}</ref>\n\n==Final Years of the League==\nSince the critical setbacks in 1933, the League's political cooperation became more and more ineffective. Conversely, the technical activities continued to grow.\n\nThus the Council decided to evaluate the separation of technical and political activities. Committee presided by an Australian Stanley Bruce concluded that fundamental reforms were needed. However, these proposals come to an abrupt halt due to the resignation of the Secretary General, J. Avenol, and the outbreak of the Second World War.\n\nFollowing the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, the Secretariat prepared plans for withdrawal. The rapid advance of German armies in 1940 put pressure on the LON to transfer certain activities according to invitations by some government. While the Secretary General stayed in Geneva to symbolize the League's continuity and Swiss neutrality, the main activities were located elsewhere.\n\nThe High Commissioner for Refugees and the Treasury of the Secretariat were based in London; the Opium Committee was based in Washington D.C.; the Economic and Financial Organisation was moved to Princeton.\n\nNeither the Assembly nor the Council could meet after December, 1939, so the rest of the [[League of Nations|League]] was administered by a Control Commission.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Politics|World War I}}\n* [[Article X of the Covenant of the League of Nations]]\n* [[Atlantic Charter]]\n* [[Interwar period]]\n* [[Latin America and the League of Nations]]\n*[[League of Nations archives]]\n* [[Minority Treaties]]\n* [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]]\n* [[Palais des Nations]], built as the League's headquarters.\n* [[Ligue internationale de la paix]]\n*[[Total Digital Access to the League of Nations Archives Project (LONTAD)]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book|last=Archer |first=Clive |title=International Organizations |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=0-415-24690-3}}\n* {{cite book |last=Baumslag |first=Naomi |year=2005 |title=Murderous Medicine: Nazi Doctors, Human Experimentation, and Typhus |publisher=Praeger |isbn=978-0-275-98312-3 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/murderousmedicin0000baum }}\n* {{Cite book|last=League of Nations |title=The Records of the First Assembly, Plenary Meetings |publisher=League of Nations, Geneva |year=1920 }}\n* {{Cite book|last=League of Nations |title=Official Journal, January, 1924 |publisher=League of Nations, Geneva |year=1924 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Northedge |first=F.S |year=1986 |title=The League of Nations: Its Life and Times, 1920\u20131946 |publisher=Holmes & Meier|isbn= 0-7185-1316-9 }}\n* {{cite book|last=Torpey |first=John |authorlink=John Torpey|year=2000 |title=The Invention of the Passport: Surveillance, Citizenship and the State |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn= 0-521-63493-8 |ref=harv}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{Paris Peace Conference navbox|state=expanded}}\n{{United Nations}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Organisation of the League of Nations}}\n[[Category:League of Nations]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:League of Nations Organization.png|thumb|League of Nations Organisation chart (in 1930).<ref>{{Cite journal | volume = | issue = 2| last = Grandjean| first = Martin| title = Complex structures and international organizations| trans-title = Analisi e visualizzazioni delle reti in storia.

The two essential wings of the League were the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] and the [[International Labour Organization]].\n\nThe relations between the Assembly and the Council were not explicitly defined, and their competencies -- with a few exceptions -- were much the same. Each organ would deal with any matter within the sphere of competence of the League or affecting the peace in the world. Particular questions or tasks might be referred either to the Council or the Assembly. Reference might be passed on from one body to another.\n\n==Constitutional organs==\n\n===Permanent Secretariat ===\n\nThe Permanent Secretariat -- established at the seat of the League at Geneva -- comprised a body of experts in various spheres under the direction of the [[Secretary General|General Secretary]].\n\n====Organisation====\nThe principal Sections of the Secretariat were: Political; Financial and Economics; Communications and Transit; Minorities and Administration (Saar and Danzig); Mandates; Disarmament; Health; Social (Opium and Traffic in Women and Children); Intellectual Cooperation and International Bureaux; Legal; and Information. Each Section was responsible for all official secretarial work related to its particular subject and prepared and organized all meetings and conferences held in that connection.\n\n====Competencies====\nThe staff of the League's secretariat was responsible for preparing the agenda for the Council and Assembly and publishing reports of the meetings and other routine matters, effectively acting as the [[civil service]] for the League. The secretariat was often considered to be too small to handle all of the League's administrative affairs. For example, the total number of officials classed as members of the Secretariat was 75 in September 1924. The total staff, including all the clerical services, comprised about 400 persons.\n\n====Classification and distribution of documents====\nIn general, the League documents may be classified into the following categories: document on public sale, documents not on public sale, and classified, e.g., confidential and secret.\n\nThe specific feature of the documents emanating from the League of Nations was their classification according to the persons they were addressed to and not according to their subjects.\n\n=====General indications=====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In practice the Assembly had become the general directing force of League activities.\n\n====Organisation of the First Assembly====\nThe Plenary Meetings of the First Assembly were held from 15 November to 18 December in Geneva, Switzerland.<ref name=\"League of Nations 1920\"/> At the opening session, there were 41 states (out of 42 Member states). Six states were admitted during the meetings and consequently were represented during the session (Albania, Austria, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Finland and Luxembourg). In total, thirty one plenary meeting were held. The principal questions during the first session were: organization of the Secretariat, establishment of a new Organization to deal with Health question, new organism to deal with Communication and transit, and a new Economic and Financial Organization, admission of new Member states, relations between the Council and the Assembly, nomination of the non-permanent Members of the Council, establishment of the Permanent Court of International Justice, the first and second budgets of the League, conflict between Poland and Soviet Russia, repatriation of prisoners of war, etc.\n\n=====President=====\nHE M.

The first four non-permanent members were [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Greece]] and [[Spain]]. The United States was meant to be the fifth permanent member, but the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] voted on 19 March 1920 against the [[ratification]] of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], thus preventing American participation in the League.\n\n====List of Council Sessions, 1920 ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The following members of the League were represented: Belgium, Brazil, The British Empire, France, Greece, Italy, Japan, and Spain.  In accordance with Art. VI of the Covenant, M. Zamoisky, ambassador of Poland in Paris, sat as a member during the discussion concerning Poland, namely the typhus in Poland.\n<br />\nThe fourth session of the Council was held at the [[Palais du Petit-Luxembourg]] in Paris on 9\u201311 April 1920. The following members of the League were represented: Belgium, Brazil, The British Empire, France, Greece, Italy, Japan, and Spain. The main issues discussed were: the status of Armenia, the protection of minorities in Turkey, the repatriation of prisoners of war in Siberia, and the question of Danzig. \n<br />\nThe fifth session of the Council was held at the Palaso Chigi in Rome on 15 May 1920. The President of the session was the Italian representative, Mr Tittoni. The main issues discussed were:  the Traffic in Women and Children, the question of Eupen and Malmedy, prevention of disease in Central Europe, the International Committee of Jurists, and the Prisoners in Siberia. The second public meeting was held at the Capitol on 19 May 1920.\n\n====Permanent Members of the Council====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Period\n! Permanent Members\n!

This general regulation concerning unanimity was the recognition of national sovereignty.\n\nThe League sought solution by consent and not by dictation.\nHowever, in case of the dispute, the consent of the parties to the dispute was not required for unanimity. Where the reference of a dispute was made to the Assembly, a decision required the consent of the majority only of the Assembly, but including all the Members of the Council.\n\n==Other bodies==\nThe Covenant implied the establishment of auxiliary bodies for various questions of a more or less technical character.\nThe League oversaw the Permanent Court of International Justice, the [[International Labour Organization]] and several other agencies and commissions created to deal with pressing international problems. These included the [[arms control|Disarmament]] Commission, the [[World Health Organization|Health Organization]], the [[League of Nations mandate|Mandates]] Commission, the [[International Commission on Intellectual Cooperation]] (precursor to [[UNESCO]]), the Permanent Central [[Opium]] Board, the Commission for [[Refugee]]s, and the [[Slavery]] Commission.  Several of these institutions were transferred to the [[United Nations]] after the [[Second World War]]; the International Labour Organization, the Permanent Court of International Justice (as the [[International Court of Justice]]), and the Health Organization (restructured as the [[World Health Organization]]) all became UN institutions.\n\n===Permanent Court of International Justice===\nThe Permanent Court of International Justice was provided for by the Covenant, but not established by it. The Council and Assembly established its constitution. Its judges were elected by the Council and Assembly, and its budget was provided by the Assembly. The composition of the Court was of eleven judges and four deputy-judges, elected for nine years.\nThe Court had been competent to hear and to determine any international dispute which the parties concerned submitted to it. The Court might also give an advisory opinion upon any dispute or question referred to it by the Council or the Assembly.\nThe Court was open to all the nations of the world under certain broad conditions. Questions of fact as well as questions of law might be submitted.\n\n===International Labour Organization===\n{{Main|International Labour Organization}}\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO) was created in 1919 on the basis of part XIII of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and became part of the League's operations.<ref name=\"Northedge17980\">Northedge 1986, pp. 179\u201380</ref>\n\nThe ILO, although having the same Members as the League and subjected to the budget control of the Assembly, was an autonomous organisation with its own Governing Body, its own General Conference and its own Secretariat. Its constitution was different from that of the League: representation had been accorded not only to Governments but to representatives of employers and workers' organisations.\n\n===Organisations arising from the Covenant===\nThe Covenant left a broad discretion to the Council and the Assembly in constituting the auxiliary organs.\nThe accomplishment of the numerous tasks delegated to the League necessitated the creation of two main types of auxiliary bodies:<br />\n\u2022\tTechnical organizations dealing with finance and economics, transit, and health; and <br />\n\u2022\tAdvisory committees, dealing with military questions, disarmament, mandates, traffic in women and children, intellectual cooperation etc.\n\n====Health Organization====\nThe League's health organisation had three bodies, a Health Bureau, containing permanent officials of the League, an [[Executive (government)|executive]] section the General Advisory Council or Conference consisting of medical experts, and a Health Committee.  The Committee's purpose was to conduct inquiries, oversee the operation of the League's health work, and get work ready to be presented to the Council.<ref>Northedge 1986, p. 182</ref> This body focused on ending [[leprosy]], [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]], the latter two by starting an international campaign to exterminate [[mosquito]]es. The Health Section was also a body in the Health Organisation. The Health section worked with countries that were not members of the League of Nations. The Health Organisation also worked successfully with the government of the [[Soviet Union]] to prevent [[typhus]] epidemics including organising a large education campaign about the disease.<ref>Baumslag 2005, p. 8</ref> \n\n====[[Permanent Mandates Commission]]====\nSince the beginning of its work, the League has been called upon, as one of its political, administrative and humanitarian duties, to exercise a sort of indirect guardianship over certain people not yet able to stand by themselves. Indeed, the Art. 22 of the Covenant entrusted the mandate to administer these territories to \"advanced nations\" who \"can best undertake this responsibility\".\nThe principle of the \"well-being and development\" was to be the guideline of all the Powers governing native people.\n\nVarious mandates\n\nThe Mandate Commission\n\nSupervision and execution of the Mandates\n\nResults of the Mandate system\n\n====Economic and Financial Organization====\nAfter the end of the war, the economic and financial conditions in all European countries were close to total collapse. Within this context, the League organized a large conference in Brussels in September \u2013 October 1920. The goal was to find a solution to monetary problems and facilitate the circulation of goods and funds.\nFollowing the conference the League established an Economic and Financial Organisation, including several Committees (Financial, Economic, Fiscal, Statistical).\nDuring the following years the League assisted many European countries: Austria, Hungary, Greece, Bulgaria, etc.<br />\nThe Fiscal Committee discussed several general issues related to double taxation and tax evasion.\nThe works of the Economic Committee comprised the treatment of foreign nationals and enterprises, abolition of the prohibition and restrictions on imports and exports, unification of customs nomenclature, bill of exchange, unification of statistical methods, trade policy, veterinary medicines, international industrial agreements, problems of coal, sugar problems, issue of smuggling in general and alcohol, in particular, and indirect protectionism.<br />\nIn October 1929 the Great Depression started in the US and soon contaminated Europe. In 1933, the LON organized a new Economic Conference in London to find a common solution to the protection of national economies.\nThe conflict between the international political goals of the major powers and their views on economic welfare prevented from any concerted solution.\n\n====Transit, Transport and Communications====\nThe rapid growth in communications and transit, by land, sea and air, has led to rapidly expanding technical activities of the League regarding those issues. The introduction of mass production systems organised into assembly lines and based on standardised models, hugely contributed to the development of transport and communications. The LON created its Organisation for Communication and Transit in 1921. Its General Conference included all Member States while the Committee had 18 members.\nThe conferences of Barcelona 1921, and Geneva 1923 concluded with conventions on the international regulation of maritime ports, waterways, and railroads. Technical assistance was provided to Member states as well as help with arbitration disputes concerning transit. The Organisation for Communication and Transit accomplished useful works and made laws that will be retained in the future work of the United Nations.\n\n====International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation====\n{{Main|International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation}}\nThe League of Nations had devoted serious attention to the question of international intellectual cooperation since its creation. The First Assembly (December 1920) recommended that the Council should take action aiming at international organisation of intellectual work. The Council adopted report presented by the Fifth Committee of the Second Assembly and invited a distinguished Committee on Intellectual Cooperation to meet in Geneva, August 1922.\nThe Programme of work of the Committee included: enquiry into the conditions of intellectual life, assistance to countries whose intellectual life was endangered, creation of National Committees for intellectual cooperation, cooperation with international intellectual organisations, protection of intellectual property, inter-university cooperation, coordination of bibliographical work and international interchange of publications, and international cooperation in archaeological research.\n\nThe International Commission for Intellectual Cooperation was created in 1922. Its first president, [[Henri Bergson]], participated together with many distinguished people in improving conditions of intellectual workers and facilitating contacts.\nFrom 1926 the Commission was included in the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation, established in Paris.\nThe cinema was also considered as a useful tool to bring minds together. The International Educational Cinematographic Institute was created in Roma after a proposal from the Italian government and placed under the League's supervision. Although serving under a fascist government, it carried out considerable work promoting the peaceful ideal and the spirit of international cooperation.\n\n====Permanent Central Opium Board====\nThe supervision of the traffic in opium and other dangerous drugs may be considered as one of the most important social and humanitarian activity of the League.<br />\nBefore the creation of the League, there existed an international Convention \u2013 the Hague Convention of 1912 \u2013 that never entered into force.\n\nThe signatories of the Treaty of Versailles agreed by Art. 295 to ratify it, ipso facto. The Convention imposed, for the first time, certain obligations for regulating the trade in and production of drugs, on the contracting parties.<br />\nThe League appointed an Advisory Committee of Experts, and instructed the Secretariat to collect full information on the steps taken to apply the 1912 Convention.\n\nThe Geneva Convention of 1925 supplemented and extended that of The Hague. It rendered the import certificates compulsory, and provided for more effective supervision of production and international trade.<br />\nThe Convention further provided for the setting up of a Permanent Central Opium Board. The Board was set up in 1928, and build up the international system of control.\n\nIn 1931 the Assembly summoned a Conference that deliberated in favor of limiting the national manufacturing of narcotics as the only way to make sure that no margin was left for illicit traffic.\n\n====Advisory Committee on the Traffic in Women and Children====\nThe rapid development of international transport during the 19th century, not only increased the number of emigrants, but also enabled traffickers of women to organize their despicable trade on more ambitious, almost worldwide lines. <br />\nBy 1910 the states undertook to punish traffickers, even if they had committed offenses in other countries.<br />\nThe league joined its efforts to those of private organizations and governments. An enquiry was held and the league set to work to secure an extension of state obligations. <br />\nIn 1921 a convention was adopted strengthening the measures against trafficking. The Committee on the Traffic in Women and Children was created. The annual reports of governments, combined with those of big private organizations working on parallel lines, enabled the committee to carry on its work of coordination and supervision.\n\n====Slavery Commission====\nThe league has considered the problem of slavery and set about securing information from various governments since 1922. \nFew years later, a convention was drawn up in view of hastening the total abolition of slavery and the slave trade. The [[1926 Slavery Convention|Slavery Convention of 25 September 1926]] produced good results in many territories.<br />\nIn 1932, in the league review of the convention implementation, appeared that cases of capture of free men still occurred in some areas, and that slave-markets existed in several countries. \nThe assembly decided therefore to appoint a permanent advisory committee to study the facts and the institutions related to slavery, and to consider means of eliminating them.\n\n====Commission for Refugees====\nIn 1921 they helped to assist the approximately 1.5 million people who fled the Russian Revolution of 1917.\nIn April 1920, there were more than half a million [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]], most of them in [[Russia]], waiting to be repatriated in extremely bad conditions. The Council of the League asked the famous explorer from [[Norway]], [[Fridtjof Nansen]] to examine the situation. Nansen took immediate steps and in less than two years managed to repatriate more than 427, 000 prisoners of war to 26 different countries. <br />\nThe League established a Commission for Refugees in 1921 and Nansen was the first High Commissioner. In autumn 1922 [[Fridtjof Nansen]] was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].<br />\nThe Commission also established the [[Nansen passport]] as a means of identification for [[Stateless person|stateless]] peoples.{{sfn|Torpey|2000|p=129}}\n\n====Disarmament Commission====\nThe Conference for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments of 1932\u20131934 (sometimes World Disarmament Conference or Geneva Disarmament Conference) was an effort by member states of the League of Nations, together with the U.S., to actualize the ideology of disarmament. It took place in the Swiss city of Geneva, ostensibly between 1930 and 1934, but more correctly until May 1937.\n\nThe first effort at international arms limitation was made at the Hague Conferences of 1899 and 1907, which had failed in their primary objective. Although many contemporary commentators (and Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles) had blamed the outbreak of the First World War on the war guilt of Germany, historians writing in the 1930s began to emphasize the fast-paced arms race preceding 1914. Further, all the major powers except the US had committed themselves to disarmament in both the Treaty of Versailles and the Covenant of the League of Nations. A substantial international non-governmental campaign to promote disarmament also developed in the 1920s and early 1930s.\n\nA preparatory commission was initiated by the League in 1925; by 1931, there was sufficient support to hold a conference, which duly began under the chairmanship of former British Foreign Secretary Arthur Henderson. The motivation behind the talks can be summed up by an extract from the message President Franklin D. Roosevelt sent to the conference: \"If all nations will agree wholly to eliminate from possession and use the weapons which make possible a successful attack, defences automatically will become impregnable and the frontiers and independence of every nation will become secure.\"\n\nThe talks were beset by a number of difficulties from the outset. Among these were disagreements over what constituted \"offensive\" and \"defensive\" weapons, and the polarization of France and Germany. The increasingly military-minded German governments could see no reason why their country could not enjoy the same level of armaments as other powers, especially France. The French, for their part, were equally insistent that German military inferiority was their only insurance from future conflict as serious as they had endured in the First World War. As for the British and US governments, they were unprepared to offer the additional security commitments that France requested in exchange for limitation of French armaments.\n\nThe talks broke down and Hitler withdrew Germany from both the Conference and the League of Nations in October 1933. The 1930s had proved far too self-interested an international period to accommodate multilateral action in favour of pacifism.\n\n====Committee for the Study of the Legal Status of Women====\n\nIn 1935, the League of Nations Assembly decided to conduct a study of women's legal status \"around the world\" as a response to pressure by women's organizations pressing for an international treaty of women's equal rights. The assembly resolved to consider how \"the terms of the Equal Rights Treaty should be examined in relation to existing political, civil and economic status of women under the laws of countries around the world.\"\n\nTo conduct this study, the Committee for the Study of the Legal Status of Women was appointed to design a questionnaire to submit to three scientific institutes: the Institut de Droit Compar\u00e9 and the Institut de Droit Penal in Paris and the Institute of Private Law at Rome. The Institute de Droit Compar\u00e9 was enlisted to study women's franchise, access to educational facilities and similar questions. The Institut de Droit Penal was assigned questions of penal and criminal laws related to women, and the Institute of Private Law focused on divorce, domicile rights and similar questions. Additionally, after much discussion, the Committee agreed to employ interested women's organizations who had already been conducting studies on the legal status of women for some time. While the work was left incomplete because of the outbreak of the Second World War, the study provided a foundation upon which the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women would organize its work after 1946.\n\nThe first meeting of the Committee of Experts for the Study of the Legal Status of Women Around the World was held in Geneva on 4 April 1938. They met again in January 1939 before disbanding. The members were Mme. [[Suzanne Bastid]] of France, professor of law at the University of Lyon; M. de Ruelle of Belgium, legal adviser for the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and member of the Permanent Court of Arbitration; Mme. Anka Godjevac of Yugoslavia, adviser of the Yugoslav delegation at the 1930 Codification Conference; Mr. H. C. Gutteridge of the United Kingdom, professor of comparative law at the University of Cambridge. Gutteridge was elected chair of the Committee; Mlle. Kerstin Hesselgren of Sweden, member of the Second Chamber of the Swedish Riksdag and Rapporteur of the Committee; Ms. Dorothy Kenyon of the United States, doctor of law, member of the New York Bar and legal adviser to a number of national organizations; M. Paul Sebasteyan of Hungary, counselor and head of the Treatise Division the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Mr. McKinnon Wood of the United Kingdom who served as Secretariat of the Committee.\n<ref>{{cite book|last=See United States Department of Labor|title=International Documents on the Status of Women|year=1947|publisher=U.

These articles were replaced by Articles 37\u201345 of the new Treaty of Lausanne.\n\n==Finances of the League==\nThe [[League of Nations]] was maintained financially by the Member States.\nThe Assembly controlled the annual budget.\n\nThe total authorized League budgets for the four years 1921\u20131924 gave an average of 22 757 769 gold francs per year, equivalent to 4 391 187 American dollars.\nThis figure covered not only the League of Nations but also the cost of the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]] and the [[International Labour Organization]].\n\nThe average share of the budget for this period was:\n\nLeague of Nations: 2 178 445 American dollars at par;\n\nInternational Labour Organization: 1 350 675 American dollars;\n\nPermanent Court of International Justice: 386 000 American dollars.<ref>{{Cite book|last=League of Nations |title=Official Journal, January, 1924|publisher=League of Nations |year=1924 }}</ref>\n\n==Final Years of the League==\nSince the critical setbacks in 1933, the League's political cooperation became more and more ineffective. Conversely, the technical activities continued to grow.\n\nThus the Council decided to evaluate the separation of technical and political activities. Committee presided by an Australian Stanley Bruce concluded that fundamental reforms were needed. However, these proposals come to an abrupt halt due to the resignation of the Secretary General, J. Avenol, and the outbreak of the Second World War.\n\nFollowing the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, the Secretariat prepared plans for withdrawal. The rapid advance of German armies in 1940 put pressure on the LON to transfer certain activities according to invitations by some government. While the Secretary General stayed in Geneva to symbolize the League's continuity and Swiss neutrality, the main activities were located elsewhere.\n\nThe High Commissioner for Refugees and the Treasury of the Secretariat were based in London; the Opium Committee was based in Washington D.C.; the Economic and Financial Organisation was moved to Princeton.\n\nNeither the Assembly nor the Council could meet after December, 1939, so the rest of the [[League of Nations|League]] was administered by a Control Commission.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Politics|World War I}}\n* [[Article X of the Covenant of the League of Nations]]\n* [[Atlantic Charter]]\n* [[Interwar period]]\n* [[Latin America and the League of Nations]]\n*[[League of Nations archives]]\n* [[Minority Treaties]]\n* [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]]\n* [[Palais des Nations]], built as the League's headquarters.\n* [[Ligue internationale de la paix]]\n*[[Total Digital Access to the League of Nations Archives Project (LONTAD)]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n* {{Cite book|last=Archer |first=Clive |title=International Organizations |publisher=Routledge |year=2001 |isbn=0-415-24690-3}}\n* {{cite book |last=Baumslag |first=Naomi |year=2005 |title=Murderous Medicine: Nazi Doctors, Human Experimentation, and Typhus |publisher=Praeger |isbn=978-0-275-98312-3 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/murderousmedicin0000baum }}\n* {{Cite book|last=League of Nations |title=The Records of the First Assembly, Plenary Meetings |publisher=League of Nations, Geneva |year=1920 }}\n* {{Cite book|last=League of Nations |title=Official Journal, January, 1924 |publisher=League of Nations, Geneva |year=1924 }}\n* {{cite book |last=Northedge |first=F.S |year=1986 |title=The League of Nations: Its Life and Times, 1920\u20131946 |publisher=Holmes & Meier|isbn= 0-7185-1316-9 }}\n* {{cite book|last=Torpey |first=John |authorlink=John Torpey|year=2000 |title=The Invention of the Passport: Surveillance, Citizenship and the State |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn= 0-521-63493-8 |ref=harv}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2019}}\n{{Paris Peace Conference navbox|state=expanded}}\n{{United Nations}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Organisation of the League of Nations}}\n[[Category:League of Nations]]\n", "name_user": "\u674e\u77ac\u751f", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_the_League_of_Nations"}
