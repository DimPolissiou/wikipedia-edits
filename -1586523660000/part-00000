Anarchy for Olson is characterized by a number of \"roving bandits\" who travel around many different geographic areas extorting wealth from local populations leaving little incentive for populations to invest, and produce. As local populations lose the incentive to produce, there is little wealth for either the bandits to steal or the people to use. Olson theorizes autocrats as \"stationary bandits\" who solve this dilemma by establishing control over a small fiefdom and monopolize the extortion of wealth in the fiefdom in the form of taxes.  Once an autocracy is developed, Olson theorizes that both the autocrat and the local population will be better off as the autocrat will have an \"encompassing interest\" in the maintenance and growth of wealth in the fiefdom.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993-01-01|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=87|issue=3|pages=567\u2013576|doi=10.2307/2938736|jstor=2938736|url=http://revistas.up.edu.pe/index.php/apuntes/article/view/342}}</ref> Because violence threatens the creation of rents, the \"stationary bandit\" has incentives to monopolize violence and to create a peaceful order.\n\n[[Douglass North]], John Joseph Wallis and [[Barry R.

They describe the process of autocratic state formation as a bargaining process among individuals with access to violence. For them, these individuals form a dominant coalition that grants each other privileges such as the access to resources. As violence reduces the rents, members of the dominant coalition have incentives to cooperate and to avoid fighting. A limited access to privileges is necessary to avoid competition among the members of the dominant coalition, who then will credibly commit to cooperate and will form the state.\n\n== Maintenance ==\nBecause autocrats need a power structure to rule, it can be difficult to draw a clear line between historical autocracies and [[Oligarchy|oligarchies]]. Most historical autocrats depended on their [[Nobility|nobles]], the [[military]], the [[priest]]hood, or other elite groups.<ref name=\"Tullock\">Tullock, Gordon. \"Autocracy\", Springer Science+Business, 1987. {{ISBN|90-247-3398-7}}</ref> Some autocracies are rationalized by assertion of [[Divine right of kings|divine right]]; historically this has mainly been reserved for medieval kingdoms. he was gay\n\nAccording to [[Douglass North]], John Joseph Wallis and [[Barry R. Weingast]], in limited access orders the state is ruled by a dominant coalition formed by a small elite group that relates to each other by personal relationships. In order to remain in power, this elite hinders people outside the dominant coalition to access organizations and resources. Autocracy, then, is maintained as long as the personal relationships of the elite continue to forge the dominant coalition. These scholars further suggest that once the dominant coalition starts to become broader and allow for impersonal relationships, limited access orders can give place to open access orders.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nFor [[Daron Acemoglu]], [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]] and [[James A. Robinson (economist)|James Robinson]], the allocation of political power explains the maintenance of autocracies, which they usually refer to as \"extractive states\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Acemoglu|first1=Daron|last2=Johnson|first2=Simon|last3=Robinson|first3=James A.|title=Chapter 6 Institutions as a Fundamental Cause of Long-Run Growth|journal=Handbook of Economic Growth|date=2005|volume=1, Part A|pages=385\u2013472|url=|doi=10.1016/S1574-0684(05)01006-3|isbn=9780444520418}}</ref> For them, the [[de jure]] political power comes from political institutions, whereas the [[de facto]] political power is determined by the distribution of resources. Those holding the political power in the present will design the political and economic institutions in the future according to their interests. In autocracies, both de jure and de facto political powers are concentrated in one person or a small elite that will promote institutions for keeping the de jure political power as concentrated as the de facto political power, thereby maintaining autocratic regimes with extractive institutions.\n\n== Autocracy promotion ==\nIt has been argued that [[authoritarian]] regimes, such as [[China]] and [[Russia]] and totalitarian states like [[North Korea]], have attempted to export their system of government to other countries through \"autocracy promotion\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324685104578388550346881268|title=A New Axis of Autocracy|last=Kurlantzick|first=Joshua|date=2013-03-30|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-05-17|issn=0099-9660}}</ref> A number of scholars are skeptical that China and Russia have successfully exported authoritarianism abroad.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tansey|first=Ois\u00edn|date=2016-01-02|title=The problem with autocracy promotion|journal=Democratization|volume=23|issue=1|pages=141\u2013163|doi=10.1080/13510347.2015.1095736|issn=1351-0347|url=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-problem-with-autocracy-promotion(23cb62b7-e51a-4a52-8948-c04b5f353072).html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Way|first=Lucan|date=2016-01-27|title=Weaknesses of Autocracy Promotion|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=27|issue=1|pages=64\u201375|doi=10.1353/jod.2016.0009|issn=1086-3214}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brownlee|first=Jason|date=2017-05-15|title=The limited reach of authoritarian powers|journal=Democratization|volume=0|issue=7|pages=1326\u20131344|doi=10.1080/13510347.2017.1287175|issn=1351-0347}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=The limits of autocracy promotion: The case of Russia in the 'near abroad'|doi=10.1111/1475-6765.12092|volume=54|issue = 4|year=2015|journal=European Journal of Political Research|pages=691\u2013706 | last1 = Way | first1 = Lucan A.}}</ref>\n\n== Historical examples ==\n*[[United States|United States of America]]: The [[President of the United States]] as chief executive of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] which oversaw relations between the U.S. and [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|sovereign Native American nations]] through the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Office of Indian Affairs]] was widely regarded as autocratic. The U.S. government imposed complete control over the [[Native Americans in the United States|citizens of Native nations]] whose nations had [[Native American treaties|entered into treaties]] with the U.S. This was especially true in the second half of the 19th century when U.S. policy was to acquire territory from Native nations and then remove that nation's population to the [[Indian Territory]] and confine them there.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Stuart|first=Paul|title=The Indian Office|publisher=Research Press|year=1978|isbn=0-8357-1079-3|location=|pages=15}}</ref> The confined population retained the citizenship of their Native nation and were not eligible for American citizenship because they were considered \"Indians not taxed\" under [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I of the Constitution]]. Unable to acquire U.S. citizenship, this meant that the confined population had no civil rights because they were not recognized as \"persons\" under American law. This deprived them of all means of legal redress to challenge the autocratic rule of the U.S. government imposed over every aspect of their lives. Native Americans were specifically excluded from the grant of universal citizenship following the abolition of slavery under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in 1868. It was not until 1879 that the first Native American was recognized as a \"person\" in the landmark civil rights case [[Standing Bear|''Standing Bear v. Crook'']]. In the Standing Bear case, 29 citizens of the [[Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma|Ponca Nation]] led by Standing Bear were required to renounce their Ponca citizenship just to acquire the basic constitutional right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness following the illegal forced removal of the Ponca to the Indian Territory in 1877 by the U.S. government in violation of the Ponca Treaty of 1865. Public opinion following the Standing Bear case led to a push for Native American citizenship with many major U.S. newspapers criticizing the U.S. autocracy. In 1880, the [[New-York Tribune|''New York Tribune'']] editorialized, \"So long as the Indians remain without the protection of the law, we give the lie to our claim to be a republic as much as we did when we permitted slavery.

Once an autocracy is developed, Olson theorizes that both the autocrat and the local population will be better off as the autocrat will have an \"encompassing interest\" in the maintenance and growth of wealth in the fiefdom.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993-01-01|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=87|issue=3|pages=567\u2013576|doi=10.2307/2938736|jstor=2938736|url=http://revistas.up.edu.pe/index.php/apuntes/article/view/342}}</ref> Because violence threatens the creation of rents, the \"stationary bandit\" has incentives to monopolize violence and to create a peaceful order.\n\n[[Douglass North]], John Joseph Wallis and [[Barry R.

They describe the process of autocratic state formation as a bargaining process among individuals with access to violence. For them, these individuals form a dominant coalition that grants each other privileges such as the access to resources. As violence reduces the rents, members of the dominant coalition have incentives to cooperate and to avoid fighting. A limited access to privileges is necessary to avoid competition among the members of the dominant coalition, who then will credibly commit to cooperate and will form the state.\n\n== Maintenance ==\nBecause autocrats need a power structure to rule, it can be difficult to draw a clear line between historical autocracies and [[Oligarchy|oligarchies]]. Most historical autocrats depended on their [[Nobility|nobles]], the [[military]], the [[priest]]hood, or other elite groups.<ref name=\"Tullock\">Tullock, Gordon. \"Autocracy\", Springer Science+Business, 1987. {{ISBN|90-247-3398-7}}</ref> Some autocracies are rationalized by assertion of [[Divine right of kings|divine right]]; historically this has mainly been reserved for medieval kingdoms.\n\nAccording to [[Douglass North]], John Joseph Wallis and [[Barry R. Weingast]], in limited access orders the state is ruled by a dominant coalition formed by a small elite group that relates to each other by personal relationships. In order to remain in power, this elite hinders people outside the dominant coalition to access organizations and resources. Autocracy, then, is maintained as long as the personal relationships of the elite continue to forge the dominant coalition. These scholars further suggest that once the dominant coalition starts to become broader and allow for impersonal relationships, limited access orders can give place to open access orders.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nFor [[Daron Acemoglu]], [[Simon Johnson (economist)|Simon Johnson]] and [[James A.

Those holding the political power in the present will design the political and economic institutions in the future according to their interests. In autocracies, both de jure and de facto political powers are concentrated in one person or a small elite that will promote institutions for keeping the de jure political power as concentrated as the de facto political power, thereby maintaining autocratic regimes with extractive institutions.\n\n== Autocracy promotion ==\nIt has been argued that [[authoritarian]] regimes, such as [[China]] and [[Russia]] and totalitarian states like [[North Korea]], have attempted to export their system of government to other countries through \"autocracy promotion\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324685104578388550346881268|title=A New Axis of Autocracy|last=Kurlantzick|first=Joshua|date=2013-03-30|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-05-17|issn=0099-9660}}</ref> A number of scholars are skeptical that China and Russia have successfully exported authoritarianism abroad.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tansey|first=Ois\u00edn|date=2016-01-02|title=The problem with autocracy promotion|journal=Democratization|volume=23|issue=1|pages=141\u2013163|doi=10.1080/13510347.2015.1095736|issn=1351-0347|url=https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-problem-with-autocracy-promotion(23cb62b7-e51a-4a52-8948-c04b5f353072).html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Way|first=Lucan|date=2016-01-27|title=Weaknesses of Autocracy Promotion|journal=Journal of Democracy|volume=27|issue=1|pages=64\u201375|doi=10.1353/jod.2016.0009|issn=1086-3214}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brownlee|first=Jason|date=2017-05-15|title=The limited reach of authoritarian powers|journal=Democratization|volume=0|issue=7|pages=1326\u20131344|doi=10.1080/13510347.2017.1287175|issn=1351-0347}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=The limits of autocracy promotion: The case of Russia in the 'near abroad'|doi=10.1111/1475-6765.12092|volume=54|issue = 4|year=2015|journal=European Journal of Political Research|pages=691\u2013706 | last1 = Way | first1 = Lucan A.}}</ref>\n\n== Historical examples ==\n*[[United States|United States of America]]: The [[President of the United States]] as chief executive of the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] which oversaw relations between the U.S. and [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|sovereign Native American nations]] through the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Office of Indian Affairs]] was widely regarded as autocratic. The U.S. government imposed complete control over the [[Native Americans in the United States|citizens of Native nations]] whose nations had [[Native American treaties|entered into treaties]] with the U.S. This was especially true in the second half of the 19th century when U.S. policy was to acquire territory from Native nations and then remove that nation's population to the [[Indian Territory]] and confine them there.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Stuart|first=Paul|title=The Indian Office|publisher=Research Press|year=1978|isbn=0-8357-1079-3|location=|pages=15}}</ref> The confined population retained the citizenship of their Native nation and were not eligible for American citizenship because they were considered \"Indians not taxed\" under [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article I of the Constitution]]. Unable to acquire U.S. citizenship, this meant that the confined population had no civil rights because they were not recognized as \"persons\" under American law. This deprived them of all means of legal redress to challenge the autocratic rule of the U.S. government imposed over every aspect of their lives. Native Americans were specifically excluded from the grant of universal citizenship following the abolition of slavery under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] in 1868. It was not until 1879 that the first Native American was recognized as a \"person\" in the landmark civil rights case [[Standing Bear|''Standing Bear v. Crook'']]. In the Standing Bear case, 29 citizens of the [[Ponca Tribe of Indians of Oklahoma|Ponca Nation]] led by Standing Bear were required to renounce their Ponca citizenship just to acquire the basic constitutional right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness following the illegal forced removal of the Ponca to the Indian Territory in 1877 by the U.S. government in violation of the Ponca Treaty of 1865. Public opinion following the Standing Bear case led to a push for Native American citizenship with many major U.S. newspapers criticizing the U.S. autocracy. In 1880, the [[New-York Tribune|''New York Tribune'']] editorialized, \"So long as the Indians remain without the protection of the law, we give the lie to our claim to be a republic as much as we did when we permitted slavery.

The [[Baseball Writers' Association of America]] (BBWAA) held an election to select from recent players, voting [[Ryne Sandberg]] and [[Wade Boggs]] into the Hall. The [[Veterans Committee]] held a separate election to select from players retired more than 20 years, but did not elect anyone.\n\nInduction ceremonies in [[Cooperstown, New York|Cooperstown]] were held July 31 with Commissioner [[Bud Selig]] presiding.\n\n==BBWAA election==\nThe BBWAA was again authorized to elect players active in 1985 or later, but not after 1999; the ballot included candidates from the 2004 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1999. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\n\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Results of the 2005 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 4. The ballot consisted of 27 players; 516 ballots were cast, with 387 votes required for election. A total of 3263 individual votes were cast, an average of 6.32 per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote (26 votes) will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\n\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (\u2020). The two candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated in '''''bold italics'''''; candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in ''italics''. The candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\n\n{{col-begin}}<ref>{{cite web |title=2005 Hall of Fame Voting |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/hof_2005.shtml#all_hof_BBWAA}}</ref>\n{{col-break|width=50%}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Player\n!Votes\n!Percent\n!Change\n!Year\n|-bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"\n|\u2020'''''[[Wade Boggs]]'''''\n|align=center|'''474'''\n|align=center|'''91.8'''\n|align=center| -\n|align=\"center\"|1st\n|-bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"\n|'''''[[Ryne Sandberg]]'''''\n|align=center|'''393'''\n|align=center|'''76.1'''\n|align=\"left\"|{{increase}}{{0}} 15%\n|align=\"center\"|3rd\n|-bgcolor=\"#ccccff\"\n|''[[Bruce Sutter]]''\n|align=center|344\n|align=center|66.6\n|align=\"left\"|{{increase}}{{0}} 7.1%\n|align=\"center\"|12th\n|-bgcolor=\"#ccccff\"\n|''[[Jim Rice]]''\n|align=center|307\n|align=center|59.4\n|align=\"left\"|{{increase}}{{0}} 4.9%\n|align=\"center\"|11th\n|-bgcolor=\"#ccccff\"\n|''[[Rich Gossage|Rich \"Goose\" Gossage]]''\n|align=center|285\n|align=center|55.2\n|align=\"left\"|{{increase}}{{0}} 14.5%\n|align=\"center\"|6th\n|-bgcolor=\"#ccccff\"\n|''[[Andre Dawson]]''\n|align=center|270\n|align=center|52.3\n|align=\"left\"|{{increase}}{{0}} 2.3%\n|align=\"center\"|4th\n|-bgcolor=\"#ccccff\"\n|''[[Bert Blyleven]]''\n|align=center|211\n|align=center|40.8\n|align=\"left\"|{{increase}}{{0}} 5.4%\n|align=\"center\"|8th\n|-bgcolor=\"#ccccff\"\n|''[[Lee Smith (baseball player)|Lee Smith]]''\n|align=center|200\n|align=center|38.7\n|align=\"left\"|{{increase}}{{0}} 2.1%\n|align=\"center\"|3rd\n|-bgcolor=\"#ccccff\"\n|''[[Jack Morris]]''\n|align=center|172\n|align=center|33.3\n|align=\"left\"|{{increase}}{{0}} 7%\n|align=\"center\"|6th\n|-bgcolor=\"#ffffcc\"\n|[[Tommy John]]\n|align=center|123\n|align=center|23.8\n|align=\"left\"|{{increase}}{{0}} 1.9%\n|align=\"center\"|11th\n|-bgcolor=\"#ffffcc\"\n|[[Steve Garvey]]\n|align=center|106\n|align=center|20.5\n|align=\"left\"|{{decrease}}{{0}} 3.8%\n|align=\"center\"|13th\n|-bgcolor=\"#ccccff\"\n|''[[Alan Trammell]]''\n|align=center|87\n|align=center|16.9\n|align=\"left\"|{{increase}}{{0}} 3.1%\n|align=\"center\"|4th\n|-bgcolor=\"#ffffcc\"\n|[[Dave Parker (baseball player)|Dave Parker]]\n|align=center|65\n|align=center|12.5\n|align=\"left\"|{{increase}}{{0}} 2.1 %\n|align=\"center\"|9th\n|-bgcolor=\"#ffffcc\"\n|[[Don Mattingly]]\n|align=center|59\n|align=center|11.4\n|align=\"left\"|{{decrease}}{{0}} 1.4%\n|align=\"center\"|5th\n|-bgcolor=\"#ffffcc\"\n|[[Dave Concepci\u00f3n]]\n|align=center|55\n|align=center|10.6\n|align=\"left\"|{{decrease}}{{0}} 0.7%\n|align=\"center\"|12th\n|-bgcolor=\"#ffffcc\"\n|[[Dale Murphy]]\n|align=center|54\n|align=center|10.4\n|align=\"left\"|{{decrease}}{{0}} 1.9%\n|align=\"center\"|7th\n|-bgcolor=\"#ffffcc\"\n|\u2020[[Willie McGee]]\n|align=center|26\n|align=center|5.0\n|align=center| -\n|align=\"center\"|1st\n|-bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\"\n|\u2020[[Jim Abbott]]*\n|align=center|13\n|align=center|2.5\n|align=center| -\n|align=\"center\"|1st\n|-bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\"\n|\u2020[[Darryl Strawberry]]*\n|align=center|6\n|align=center|1.1\n|align=center| -\n|align=\"center\"|1st\n|-bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\"\n|\u2020[[Jack McDowell]]*\n|align=center|4\n|align=center|0.7\n|align=center| -\n|align=\"center\"|1st\n|-bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\"\n|\u2020[[Chili Davis]]*\n|align=center|3\n|align=center|0.5\n|align=center| -\n|align=\"center\"|1st\n|-bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\"\n|\u2020[[Tom Candiotti]]*\n|align=center|2\n|align=center|0.3\n|align=center| -\n|align=\"center\"|1st\n|-bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\"\n|\u2020[[Jeff Montgomery (baseball)|Jeff Montgomery]]*\n|align=center|2\n|align=center|0.3\n|align=center| -\n|align=\"center\"|1st\n|-bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\"\n|\u2020[[Tony Phillips]]*\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|0.1\n|align=center| -\n|align=\"center\"|1st\n|-bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\"\n|\u2020[[Terry Steinbach]]*\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|0.1\n|align=center| -\n|align=\"center\"|1st\n|-bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\"\n|\u2020[[Mark Langston]]*\n|align=center|0\n|align=center|0.0\n|align=center| -\n|align=\"center\"|1st\n|-bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\"\n|\u2020[[Otis Nixon]]*\n|align=center|0\n|align=center|0.0\n|align=center| -\n|align=\"center\"|1st\n|-\n|}\n{{col-break|width=50%}}\n{{BBWAA balloting 2|date=2006}}\n{{col-end}}\n\nThe newly-eligible candidates included 10 All Stars (two of whom were not on the ballot), who were selected for a combined total of 43 times. [[Wade Boggs]], a 12-time All Star, and [[Darryl Strawberry]], an eight-time All Star, were the only new candidates selected five or more times. The ballot included one Rookie of the Year (Strawberry), one Cy Young Award-winner ([[Jack McDowell]]), and one MVP ([[Willie McGee]]).\n\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were ''not'' included on the ballot were: [[Paul Assenmacher]], [[Jeff Blauser]], [[Mike Blowers]], [[John Cangelosi]], [[Jim Corsi (baseball)|Jim Corsi]], [[Rich DeLucia]], [[Tony Fossas]], [[Carlos Garc\u00eda (baseball)|Carlos Garc\u00eda]], [[Jack Howell (baseball)|Jack Howell]], [[Darrin Jackson]], [[Jeff King (baseball)|Jeff King]], [[Mike Macfarlane]], [[Kirt Manwaring]], [[Derrick May (baseball)|Derrick May]], [[Brian McRae]], [[Eric Plunk]], [[Mark Portugal]], [[Mel Rojas]], [[Paul Sorrento]], and [[Dale Sveum]].\n\nOf the new players on the ballot, only Wade Boggs was elected; Willie McGee was the only other first-timer to receive enough votes to remain on the ballot, receiving the exact minimum (26) to stay eligible.\n\n==Veterans Committee==\nRules enacted in August 2001 provided that the Veterans Committee would be expanded from its previous 15 members, elected to limited terms, to include the full living membership of the Hall. Elections for players retired over 20 years would be held every other year, with elections of non-players ([[manager (baseball)|managers]], [[umpire (baseball)|umpires]] and executives) held every fourth year. No candidates were elected from either ballot in 2003. Following 2004, when no Veterans election was held, the Committee voted in 2005 on players who were active no later than 1983; the next such election was in 2007. There was no 2005 election for non-players; the last such election was in 2003, and the next was held in 2007.\n\n===Preliminary phase===\nIn December 2003, a Historical Overview Committee of nine sportswriters appointed by the BBWAA's Board of Directors met at the Hall of Fame's library and nominated 200 players who were active in the major leagues no later than 1983. They were provided with statistical information by the [[Elias Sports Bureau]], official statistician for Major League Baseball since the 1920s, which also identified the 1,400 players with 10 or more years of play who were eligible.\n\nThe Historical Overview Committee comprised [[Bob Elliott (sportswriter)|Bob Elliott]] (''[[Toronto Sun]]''), [[Steve Hirdt]] (Elias Sports Bureau), [[Rick Hummel]] (''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]''), [[Moss Klein]] (Newark ''[[Star-Ledger]]''), [[Bill Madden (sportswriter)|Bill Madden]] (''[[New York Daily News]]''), [[Ken Nigro]] (former ''[[The Baltimore Sun|Baltimore Sun]]'' writer), [[Jack O'Connell (sportswriter)|Jack O'Connell]] (''[[The Hartford Courant]]''), [[Tracy Ringolsby]] (''[[Rocky Mountain News]]''), and [[Mark Whicker]] (''[[Orange Country Register]]''). Their list of 200 players was announced April 19, 2004.\n\n'''Players.''' (\u2020 marks those newly eligible since 2003 (eight).

Williams]] - [[Maury Wills]] - [[Smoky Joe Wood]] - [[Wilbur Wood]] - [[Glenn Wright]] - [[Jimmy Wynn]] - [[Rudy York]]</blockquote>\n\nThe 200 players were almost evenly divided between players retired less than 50 years (99 players retired from 1955 to 1983) and those retired over 50 years (101 players retired 1954 or earlier).\n\nThe list of 200 was almost identical to the list prepared for the 2003 election; apart from the eight players who were newly eligible, only [[Larry Doyle (baseball)|Larry Doyle]], [[Andy Pafko]] and [[Smoky Joe Wood]] were added to the list, for a net change of 11 individuals. Perhaps due to the reliance on ''official'' statistics &ndash; often incomplete in the sport's early years &ndash; provided by the [[Elias Sports Bureau]], the committee included very few players from the sport's first half-century, which remained poorly represented in the Hall; only 15 players were included who made their debut before 1893. Although the Hall's current membership included fewer than a dozen non-pitchers of the 1870s and 1880s, compared to nearly 50 from the 1930s and 1940s, the committee included nearly 50 more players from the period between 1920 and 1945, but only 7 who played primarily in the 25 years before 1893: first baseman/outfielder Harry Stovey, shortstop Jack Glasscock, outfielder Pete Browning, and pitchers Charlie Buffinton, Bob Caruthers, Tony Mullane and Will White. The inclusion of Will White was remarkable in that his brother [[Deacon White]] is widely accepted as having been a far greater player. In addition to Deacon White, stars of the 19th century who were omitted included [[Paul Hines]], [[Deacon McGuire]], [[Cupid Childs]], [[Bobby Lowe]], [[George Gore]], [[Hardy Richardson]], [[Ezra Sutton]], [[Arlie Latham]], [[Fred Pfeffer]] and [[Joe Start]].\n\nBy primary fielding position the nominees were starting pitchers (66), relief pitchers (9), catchers (10), first basemen (24), second basemen (8), third basemen (13), shortstops (19), left fielders (18), center fielders (17) and right fielders (16).\n\n===Phase two===\nThe Historical Overview nominations were forwarded to a 60-member BBWAA screening committee comprising two writers from each major league city. In summer 2004 they elected 25 players who would appear on the final ballot. (Everyone voted for 25 nominees.) Meanwhile, a committee of six Hall of Fame members independently selected five of the 200 nominees who would appear on the final ballot, which would thereby comprise 25 to 30 players.\n\nEvidently the writers named all of the Hall of Fame members' five selections, for there were 25 on the final ballot.\n\n===Final ballot===\nOn December 6, 2004, the final ballot of 25 candidates was announced. Those selected played primarily from the 1950s onward, with only 5 of the 25 candidates having retired before 1960, and only three pitchers &ndash; Smoky Joe Wood, Carl Mays and Wes Ferrell &ndash; having retired before 1950. The BBWAA screening committee had failed to include any candidates from the era before 1910. This likely reflected a tendency among the voting writers to vote only for those players they had seen themselves, and to withhold votes from earlier players.\n\nAll 60 living members of the Hall were eligible to cast ballots in the final election, along with the 8 living recipients of the [[J. G. Taylor Spink Award]], the 14 living recipients of the [[Ford C. Frick Award]], and the sole additional member of the pre-2001 Veterans Committee whose term had not yet expired ([[John McHale (baseball)|John McHale]]). Balloting was conducted by mail in January 2005, with voters permitted to vote for up to 10 candidates from the ballot of 25 individuals; ''all'' candidates who received at least 75% of the vote would be elected. Results of the voting by the Veterans Committee were announced on March 2.\n\nThere were 83 eligible voters, 80 of whom cast ballots; 60 votes were required for election. In all, 458 individual votes were cast, for an average of 5.73 votes per ballot. For the second consecutive Veterans Committee election, no player was elected. Of the 21 candidates who were also on the 2003 ballot, only 7 gained more votes in 2005, with only Joe Torre (7), Ron Santo (6) and Ken Boyer (4) increasing their totals by more than two votes. Candidates who were considered by the Committee for the first time are indicated here with a \u2020; candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in ''italics''. The complete ballot, with the number of votes cast for each candidate, was:\n\n*[[Gil Hodges]] - 52\n*''[[Ron Santo]]'' - 52\n*[[Tony Oliva]] - 45\n*\u2020[[Jim Kaat]] - 43\n*''[[Joe Torre]]'' - 36\n*[[Maury Wills]] - 26\n*[[Vada Pinson]] - 23\n*\u2020[[Luis Tiant]] - 20\n*[[Roger Maris]] - 19\n*[[Marty Marion]] - 16\n*[[Ken Boyer]] - 15\n*''[[Joe Gordon]]'' - 14\n*[[Dick Allen]] - 12\n*[[Carl Mays]] - 12\n*[[Minnie Mi\u00f1oso]] - 12\n*[[Curt Flood]] - 10\n*[[Wes Ferrell]] - 9\n*[[Mickey Lolich]] - 9\n*[[Don Newcombe]] - 8\n*\u2020[[Sparky Lyle]] - 7\n*[[Elston Howard]] - 6\n*[[Bobby Bonds]] - 4\n*[[Rocky Colavito]] - 4\n*[[Thurman Munson]] - 2\n*[[Smoky Joe Wood]] - 2\n\n===Reaction===\nHall of Fame chairwoman Jane Forbes Clark responded to the Committee's failure to elect anyone by saying: \"The results of the last two elections show that the writers &ndash; by and large &ndash; have done a great job of electing players to the Hall of Fame. The current process works by upholding the Hall of Fame's high standards for election and by providing a more open, more inclusive and more understandable process.\" Noting that the top candidates gained slightly from the 2003 voting, she added: \"What's encouraging for me is that this shows the process to be dynamic, not static.\"\n\nHall of Fame member [[Tom Seaver]], noting that he had voted for three candidates including Gil Hodges, said of the chances of future selections: \"I'm of the opinion it's going to be awfully hard, and maybe that's how it should be.\" He added: \"Will somebody make it out of this committee one day? Absolutely. I'm convinced they will.\"\n\nBut response from observers in the press and throughout baseball was widely critical. Stephen Cannella of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' wrote: \"Seaver's right. Hall of Fame standards should be high. But letting the inmates play gatekeeper allows them to make those standards unreachable. ... it might be too much to ask Hall of Famers to be guardians of their realm. ... Would you want to belong to a club that would have anyone else as a member?\"\n\nMike Downey of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' wrote: \"And once again these gentlemen made it crystal clear they like their society being extremely exclusive. They act as aristocratically as a board from a private school or a homeowners association in the Hamptons. ... if the vote were left strictly to former players, they might not let another soul in.\"\n\nDave Anderson wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'': \"It's time not only for the Cooperstown pooh-bahs to rethink this realigned committee's selection process, but also to question the responsibility of the do-nothing committee ... after two veterans committee shutouts, it's fair to wonder how responsibly do the Hall of Famers, especially the 58 ex-players among them, take their duty as voters? Do they really study the two pages of statistics, rankings and highlights supplied to them for each of the 25 candidates on the ballot &ndash; particularly those of players from other eras whom they never competed against and probably know nothing about? Do they just glance at the list and make a snap judgment?\"\n\nSome writers specifically lamented the failure to elect particular candidates. Ken Rosenthal wrote for ''[[The Sporting News]]'': \"The writers blew it, and now the Veterans Committee is blowing it. Former Cubs third baseman Ron Santo should be in the Hall of Fame. Santo's career .826 [[On-base plus slugging|OPS]] is more than 100 points higher than [[Brooks Robinson]]'s and is only 30 points lower than [[George Brett (baseball)|George Brett]]'s. Nine [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Games]], five [[Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]]s &ndash; what exactly is the problem?\" And Bill Madden of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' wrote: \"Another exercise in futility by the new and expanded Veterans Committee has again left Gil Hodges waiting on the Hall of Fame doorstep.\"\n\nCandidate Tony Oliva responded to the election by saying: \"It's almost impossible to go into the Hall of Fame the way the system is now. It's ridiculous.\" And Ron Santo said: \"It was a very tough day. ... I'm fortunate to have a wonderful family that puts everything into perspective. ... It was hard to believe no one got in. One thing I can say is the next time I won't be sitting at home waiting for the phone.\"\n\n==J.G. Taylor Spink Award==\n[[Peter Gammons]] received the [[J. G. Taylor Spink Award]] honoring a baseball writer. (The award was voted at the December 2004 meeting of the BBWAA, dated 2004, and conferred in the summer 2005 ceremonies.)\n\nThe Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962. It recognizes a [[sportswriting|sportswriter]] \"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing\". \nThe recipients are not members of the Hall of the Fame, merely featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum, but writers and broadcasters commonly call them \"Hall of Fame writers\" or words to that effect. Living recipients were members of the [[Veterans Committee]] for elections in odd years 2003 to 2007.\n\nThree final candidates, selected by a BBWAA committee, were named on July 13, 2004 in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] in conjunction with [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] activities; the finalists were: [[Peter Gammons]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' and ''ESPN The Magazine''; the late [[Vern Plagenhoef]], who covered the [[Detroit Tigers]] for Michigan's Booth Newspaper Group; and [[Tracy Ringolsby]], who has covered the [[Colorado Rockies]] for the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' since 1993 and has completed 30 seasons as a baseball writer. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to cast ballots in voting conducted by mail in November.\n\nOn December 12, '''Peter Gammons''' was announced as the recipient, having received 248 votes out of the 448 ballots cast, with Ringolsby receiving 134 votes and Plagenhoef receiving 66.\n\n==Ford C. Frick Award==\n[[Jerry Coleman]] received the [[Ford C. Frick Award]] honoring a baseball broadcaster.\n\nThe Frick Award has been presented at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1978. It recognizes a broadcaster for \"major contributions to baseball\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of the Fame, merely featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum, but writers and broadcasters commonly call them \"Hall of Fame broadcaster\" or words to that effect. Living honorees were members of the [[Veterans Committee]] for elections in odd years 2003 to 2007.\n\nTo be eligible, an active or retired broadcaster must have a minimum of 10 years of continuous major league broadcast service with a ball club, a network, or a combination of the two; more than 160 candidates were eligible.\n\nOn December 13, 2004, 10 finalists were announced. In accordance with guidelines established in 2003, seven were chosen by a research committee at the museum: [[Jerry Coleman]], [[Ken Coleman]], [[Dizzy Dean]], [[Gene Elston]], [[Tony Kubek]], [[France Laux]] and [[Graham McNamee]]. Three additional candidates &ndash; [[Dave Niehaus]], [[Tom Cheek]] and [[Ron Santo]] &ndash; were selected in voting by over 65,000 fans prior to November 2004 at the Hall's official website [https://web.archive.org/web/20050117032740/http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/whats_new/press_releases/2004/pr2004_12_13.htm].\n\nOn February 22, '''Jerry Coleman''' was announced as the 2005 recipient [https://web.archive.org/web/20060630152404/http://www.baseballhalloffame.com/history/2005/050222.htm]; a former major league infielder and the voice of the [[San Diego Padres]] almost continuously since [[1972 in sports|1972]], he was selected in a January vote by a 20-member committee composed of the 14 living recipients, along with six additional broadcasting historians or columnists: [[Bob Costas]] ([[NBC]]), [[Barry Horn (sportswriter)|Barry Horn]] (''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''), [[Stan Isaacs]] (formerly of New York ''[[Newsday]]''), [[Ted Patterson]] (historian), [[Curt Smith (historian)|Curt Smith]] (historian) and [[Larry Stewart (journalist)|Larry Stewart]] (''[[Los Angeles Times]]''). Committee members are asked to base the selection on the following criteria: longevity; continuity with a club; honors, including national assignments such as the [[World Series]] and [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Games]]; and popularity with fans.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091227075304/http://bbwaa.com/2009/02/05-hof/ 2005 Election] at www.bbwaa.com.\n\n{{Baseball Hall of Fame}}\n\n[[Category:Baseball Hall of Fame balloting]]\n[[Category:2005 in baseball|Hall of Fame balloting]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=October 2019}}\n{{infobox <!-- one-off usage here -->\n| above          = <span style=\"color:white;\"><small>2005 Balloting for the National</small></span>\n| abovestyle     = background:#EC1C40;\n| subheaderstyle = background:{{{hofcolor|#184071}}};\n| subheader      = [[File:Empty Star.svg|15px|link=]] [[File:Empty Star.svg|15px|link=]] [[File:Empty Star.svg|15px|link=]] &nbsp;<span style=\"color:white;\">'''Baseball Hall of Fame'''</span>&nbsp; [[File:Empty Star.svg|15px|link=]] [[File:Empty Star.svg|15px|link=]] [[File:Empty Star.svg|15px|link=]]\n| image   = \n| caption =\n|label1= New inductees\n| data1 = 2\n|label2= via BBWAA\n| data2 = 2\n|label3= Total inductees\n| data3 = 260\n|label4= Induction date\n| data4 = July 31, 2005\n| data5 = {{align|center|[[:Category:Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|Baseball Hall of Fame balloting]]}}\n| data6 = {{align|left|\u00ab[[2004 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2004]]}}{{align|right|[[2006 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2006]]\u00bb}}\n}}\n{{multiple image\n| footer    = 2005 inductees [[Wade Boggs]] (left) and [[Ryne Sandberg]]\n| align     = right\n| total_width=300\n| image1    = Boggs.JPG\n| image2    = Ryne Sandberg.jpg\n}}\n'''Elections to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] for 2005''' proceeded in keeping with rules enacted in 2001. The [[Baseball Writers' Association of America]] (BBWAA) held an election to select from recent players, voting [[Ryne Sandberg]] and [[Wade Boggs]] into the Hall. The [[Veterans Committee]] held a separate election to select from players retired more than 20 years, but did not elect anyone.\n\nInduction ceremonies in [[Cooperstown, New York|Cooperstown]] were held July 31 with Commissioner [[Bud Selig]] presiding.\n\n==BBWAA election==\nThe BBWAA was again authorized to elect players active in 1985 or later, but not after 1999; the ballot included candidates from the 2004 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1999. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\n\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Results of the 2005 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 4. The ballot consisted of 27 players; 516 ballots were cast, with 387 votes required for election. A total of 3263 individual votes were cast, an average of 6.32 per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote (26 votes) will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\n\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (\u2020).

[[Wade Boggs]], a 12-time All Star, and [[Darryl Strawberry]], an eight-time All Star, were the only new candidates selected five or more times. The ballot included one Rookie of the Year (Strawberry), one Cy Young Award-winner ([[Jack McDowell]]), and one MVP ([[Willie McGee]]).\n\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were ''not'' included on the ballot were: [[Paul Assenmacher]], [[Jeff Blauser]], [[Mike Blowers]], [[John Cangelosi]], [[Jim Corsi (baseball)|Jim Corsi]], [[Rich DeLucia]], [[Tony Fossas]], [[Carlos Garc\u00eda (baseball)|Carlos Garc\u00eda]], [[Jack Howell (baseball)|Jack Howell]], [[Darrin Jackson]], [[Jeff King (baseball)|Jeff King]], [[Mike Macfarlane]], [[Kirt Manwaring]], [[Derrick May (baseball)|Derrick May]], [[Brian McRae]], [[Eric Plunk]], [[Mark Portugal]], [[Mel Rojas]], [[Paul Sorrento]], and [[Dale Sveum]].\n\nOf the new players on the ballot, only Wade Boggs was elected; Willie McGee was the only other first-timer to receive enough votes to remain on the ballot, receiving the exact minimum (26) to stay eligible.\n\n==Veterans Committee==\nRules enacted in August 2001 provided that the Veterans Committee would be expanded from its previous 15 members, elected to limited terms, to include the full living membership of the Hall. Elections for players retired over 20 years would be held every other year, with elections of non-players ([[manager (baseball)|managers]], [[umpire (baseball)|umpires]] and executives) held every fourth year. No candidates were elected from either ballot in 2003. Following 2004, when no Veterans election was held, the Committee voted in 2005 on players who were active no later than 1983; the next such election was in 2007. There was no 2005 election for non-players; the last such election was in 2003, and the next was held in 2007.\n\n===Preliminary phase===\nIn December 2003, a Historical Overview Committee of nine sportswriters appointed by the BBWAA's Board of Directors met at the Hall of Fame's library and nominated 200 players who were active in the major leagues no later than 1983. They were provided with statistical information by the [[Elias Sports Bureau]], official statistician for Major League Baseball since the 1920s, which also identified the 1,400 players with 10 or more years of play who were eligible.\n\nThe Historical Overview Committee comprised [[Bob Elliott (sportswriter)|Bob Elliott]] (''[[Toronto Sun]]''), [[Steve Hirdt]] (Elias Sports Bureau), [[Rick Hummel]] (''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]''), [[Moss Klein]] (Newark ''[[Star-Ledger]]''), [[Bill Madden (sportswriter)|Bill Madden]] (''[[New York Daily News]]''), [[Ken Nigro]] (former ''[[The Baltimore Sun|Baltimore Sun]]'' writer), [[Jack O'Connell (sportswriter)|Jack O'Connell]] (''[[The Hartford Courant]]''), [[Tracy Ringolsby]] (''[[Rocky Mountain News]]''), and [[Mark Whicker]] (''[[Orange Country Register]]''). Their list of 200 players was announced April 19, 2004.\n\n'''Players.''' (\u2020 marks those newly eligible since 2003 (eight).

Williams]] - [[Maury Wills]] - [[Smoky Joe Wood]] - [[Wilbur Wood]] - [[Glenn Wright]] - [[Jimmy Wynn]] - [[Rudy York]]</blockquote>\n\nThe 200 players were almost evenly divided between players retired less than 50 years (99 players retired from 1955 to 1983) and those retired over 50 years (101 players retired 1954 or earlier).\n\nThe list of 200 was almost identical to the list prepared for the 2003 election; apart from the eight players who were newly eligible, only [[Larry Doyle (baseball)|Larry Doyle]], [[Andy Pafko]] and [[Smoky Joe Wood]] were added to the list, for a net change of 11 individuals. Perhaps due to the reliance on ''official'' statistics &ndash; often incomplete in the sport's early years &ndash; provided by the [[Elias Sports Bureau]], the committee included very few players from the sport's first half-century, which remained poorly represented in the Hall; only 15 players were included who made their debut before 1893. Although the Hall's current membership included fewer than a dozen non-pitchers of the 1870s and 1880s, compared to nearly 50 from the 1930s and 1940s, the committee included nearly 50 more players from the period between 1920 and 1945, but only 7 who played primarily in the 25 years before 1893: first baseman/outfielder Harry Stovey, shortstop Jack Glasscock, outfielder Pete Browning, and pitchers Charlie Buffinton, Bob Caruthers, Tony Mullane and Will White. The inclusion of Will White was remarkable in that his brother [[Deacon White]] is widely accepted as having been a far greater player. In addition to Deacon White, stars of the 19th century who were omitted included [[Paul Hines]], [[Deacon McGuire]], [[Cupid Childs]], [[Bobby Lowe]], [[George Gore]], [[Hardy Richardson]], [[Ezra Sutton]], [[Arlie Latham]], [[Fred Pfeffer]] and [[Joe Start]].\n\nBy primary fielding position the nominees were starting pitchers (66), relief pitchers (9), catchers (10), first basemen (24), second basemen (8), third basemen (13), shortstops (19), left fielders (18), center fielders (17) and right fielders (16).\n\n===Phase two===\nThe Historical Overview nominations were forwarded to a 60-member BBWAA screening committee comprising two writers from each major league city. In summer 2004 they elected 25 players who would appear on the final ballot. (Everyone voted for 25 nominees.) Meanwhile, a committee of six Hall of Fame members independently selected five of the 200 nominees who would appear on the final ballot, which would thereby comprise 25 to 30 players.\n\nEvidently the writers named all of the Hall of Fame members' five selections, for there were 25 on the final ballot.\n\n===Final ballot===\nOn December 6, 2004, the final ballot of 25 candidates was announced. Those selected played primarily from the 1950s onward, with only 5 of the 25 candidates having retired before 1960, and only three pitchers &ndash; Smoky Joe Wood, Carl Mays and Wes Ferrell &ndash; having retired before 1950. The BBWAA screening committee had failed to include any candidates from the era before 1910. This likely reflected a tendency among the voting writers to vote only for those players they had seen themselves, and to withhold votes from earlier players.\n\nAll 60 living members of the Hall were eligible to cast ballots in the final election, along with the 8 living recipients of the [[J. G. Taylor Spink Award]], the 14 living recipients of the [[Ford C. Frick Award]], and the sole additional member of the pre-2001 Veterans Committee whose term had not yet expired ([[John McHale (baseball)|John McHale]]). Balloting was conducted by mail in January 2005, with voters permitted to vote for up to 10 candidates from the ballot of 25 individuals; ''all'' candidates who received at least 75% of the vote would be elected. Results of the voting by the Veterans Committee were announced on March 2.\n\nThere were 83 eligible voters, 80 of whom cast ballots; 60 votes were required for election. In all, 458 individual votes were cast, for an average of 5.73 votes per ballot. For the second consecutive Veterans Committee election, no player was elected. Of the 21 candidates who were also on the 2003 ballot, only 7 gained more votes in 2005, with only Joe Torre (7), Ron Santo (6) and Ken Boyer (4) increasing their totals by more than two votes. Candidates who were considered by the Committee for the first time are indicated here with a \u2020; candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in ''italics''. The complete ballot, with the number of votes cast for each candidate, was:\n\n*[[Gil Hodges]] - 52\n*''[[Ron Santo]]'' - 52\n*[[Tony Oliva]] - 45\n*\u2020[[Jim Kaat]] - 43\n*''[[Joe Torre]]'' - 36\n*[[Maury Wills]] - 26\n*[[Vada Pinson]] - 23\n*\u2020[[Luis Tiant]] - 20\n*[[Roger Maris]] - 19\n*[[Marty Marion]] - 16\n*[[Ken Boyer]] - 15\n*''[[Joe Gordon]]'' - 14\n*[[Dick Allen]] - 12\n*[[Carl Mays]] - 12\n*[[Minnie Mi\u00f1oso]] - 12\n*[[Curt Flood]] - 10\n*[[Wes Ferrell]] - 9\n*[[Mickey Lolich]] - 9\n*[[Don Newcombe]] - 8\n*\u2020[[Sparky Lyle]] - 7\n*[[Elston Howard]] - 6\n*[[Bobby Bonds]] - 4\n*[[Rocky Colavito]] - 4\n*[[Thurman Munson]] - 2\n*[[Smoky Joe Wood]] - 2\n\n===Reaction===\nHall of Fame chairwoman Jane Forbes Clark responded to the Committee's failure to elect anyone by saying: \"The results of the last two elections show that the writers &ndash; by and large &ndash; have done a great job of electing players to the Hall of Fame. The current process works by upholding the Hall of Fame's high standards for election and by providing a more open, more inclusive and more understandable process.\" Noting that the top candidates gained slightly from the 2003 voting, she added: \"What's encouraging for me is that this shows the process to be dynamic, not static.\"\n\nHall of Fame member [[Tom Seaver]], noting that he had voted for three candidates including Gil Hodges, said of the chances of future selections: \"I'm of the opinion it's going to be awfully hard, and maybe that's how it should be.\" He added: \"Will somebody make it out of this committee one day? Absolutely. I'm convinced they will.\"\n\nBut response from observers in the press and throughout baseball was widely critical. Stephen Cannella of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' wrote: \"Seaver's right. Hall of Fame standards should be high. But letting the inmates play gatekeeper allows them to make those standards unreachable. ... it might be too much to ask Hall of Famers to be guardians of their realm. ... Would you want to belong to a club that would have anyone else as a member?\"\n\nMike Downey of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' wrote: \"And once again these gentlemen made it crystal clear they like their society being extremely exclusive. They act as aristocratically as a board from a private school or a homeowners association in the Hamptons. ... if the vote were left strictly to former players, they might not let another soul in.\"\n\nDave Anderson wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'': \"It's time not only for the Cooperstown pooh-bahs to rethink this realigned committee's selection process, but also to question the responsibility of the do-nothing committee ... after two veterans committee shutouts, it's fair to wonder how responsibly do the Hall of Famers, especially the 58 ex-players among them, take their duty as voters? Do they really study the two pages of statistics, rankings and highlights supplied to them for each of the 25 candidates on the ballot &ndash; particularly those of players from other eras whom they never competed against and probably know nothing about? Do they just glance at the list and make a snap judgment?\"\n\nSome writers specifically lamented the failure to elect particular candidates. Ken Rosenthal wrote for ''[[The Sporting News]]'': \"The writers blew it, and now the Veterans Committee is blowing it. Former Cubs third baseman Ron Santo should be in the Hall of Fame. Santo's career .826 [[On-base plus slugging|OPS]] is more than 100 points higher than [[Brooks Robinson]]'s and is only 30 points lower than [[George Brett (baseball)|George Brett]]'s. Nine [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Games]], five [[Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]]s &ndash; what exactly is the problem?\" And Bill Madden of the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' wrote: \"Another exercise in futility by the new and expanded Veterans Committee has again left Gil Hodges waiting on the Hall of Fame doorstep.\"\n\nCandidate Tony Oliva responded to the election by saying: \"It's almost impossible to go into the Hall of Fame the way the system is now. It's ridiculous.\" And Ron Santo said: \"It was a very tough day. ... I'm fortunate to have a wonderful family that puts everything into perspective. ... It was hard to believe no one got in. One thing I can say is the next time I won't be sitting at home waiting for the phone.\"\n\n==J.G. Taylor Spink Award==\n[[Peter Gammons]] received the [[J. G. Taylor Spink Award]] honoring a baseball writer. (The award was voted at the December 2004 meeting of the BBWAA, dated 2004, and conferred in the summer 2005 ceremonies.)\n\nThe Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962. It recognizes a [[sportswriting|sportswriter]] \"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing\". \nThe recipients are not members of the Hall of the Fame, merely featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum, but writers and broadcasters commonly call them \"Hall of Fame writers\" or words to that effect. Living recipients were members of the [[Veterans Committee]] for elections in odd years 2003 to 2007.\n\nThree final candidates, selected by a BBWAA committee, were named on July 13, 2004 in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] in conjunction with [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] activities; the finalists were: [[Peter Gammons]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' and ''ESPN The Magazine''; the late [[Vern Plagenhoef]], who covered the [[Detroit Tigers]] for Michigan's Booth Newspaper Group; and [[Tracy Ringolsby]], who has covered the [[Colorado Rockies]] for the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' since 1993 and has completed 30 seasons as a baseball writer. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to cast ballots in voting conducted by mail in November.\n\nOn December 12, '''Peter Gammons''' was announced as the recipient, having received 248 votes out of the 448 ballots cast, with Ringolsby receiving 134 votes and Plagenhoef receiving 66.\n\n==Ford C. Frick Award==\n[[Jerry Coleman]] received the [[Ford C. Frick Award]] honoring a baseball broadcaster.\n\nThe Frick Award has been presented at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1978. It recognizes a broadcaster for \"major contributions to baseball\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of the Fame, merely featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum, but writers and broadcasters commonly call them \"Hall of Fame broadcaster\" or words to that effect. Living honorees were members of the [[Veterans Committee]] for elections in odd years 2003 to 2007.\n\nTo be eligible, an active or retired broadcaster must have a minimum of 10 years of continuous major league broadcast service with a ball club, a network, or a combination of the two; more than 160 candidates were eligible.\n\nOn December 13, 2004, 10 finalists were announced. In accordance with guidelines established in 2003, seven were chosen by a research committee at the museum: [[Jerry Coleman]], [[Ken Coleman]], [[Dizzy Dean]], [[Gene Elston]], [[Tony Kubek]], [[France Laux]] and [[Graham McNamee]]. Three additional candidates &ndash; [[Dave Niehaus]], [[Tom Cheek]] and [[Ron Santo]] &ndash; were selected in voting by over 65,000 fans prior to November 2004 at the Hall's official website [https://web.archive.org/web/20050117032740/http://www.baseballhalloffame.org/whats_new/press_releases/2004/pr2004_12_13.htm].\n\nOn February 22, '''Jerry Coleman''' was announced as the 2005 recipient [https://web.archive.org/web/20060630152404/http://www.baseballhalloffame.com/history/2005/050222.htm]; a former major league infielder and the voice of the [[San Diego Padres]] almost continuously since [[1972 in sports|1972]], he was selected in a January vote by a 20-member committee composed of the 14 living recipients, along with six additional broadcasting historians or columnists: [[Bob Costas]] ([[NBC]]), [[Barry Horn (sportswriter)|Barry Horn]] (''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''), [[Stan Isaacs]] (formerly of New York ''[[Newsday]]''), [[Ted Patterson]] (historian), [[Curt Smith (historian)|Curt Smith]] (historian) and [[Larry Stewart (journalist)|Larry Stewart]] (''[[Los Angeles Times]]''). Committee members are asked to base the selection on the following criteria: longevity; continuity with a club; honors, including national assignments such as the [[World Series]] and [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Games]]; and popularity with fans.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091227075304/http://bbwaa.com/2009/02/05-hof/ 2005 Election] at www.bbwaa.com.\n\n{{Baseball Hall of Fame}}\n\n[[Category:Baseball Hall of Fame balloting]]\n[[Category:2005 in baseball|Hall of Fame balloting]]\n== References ==\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reflist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_balloting"}

For example, cellulose is a glycan (or, to be more specific, a [[glucan]]) composed of \u03b2-1,4-linked <small>D</small>-glucose, and chitin is a glycan composed of \u03b2-1,4-linked ''N''-acetyl-<small>D</small>-glucosamine. Glycans can be homo- or heteropolymers of monosaccharide residues, and can be linear or branched.\n\n== Glycans and proteins==\n\nGlycans can be found attached to proteins as in glycoproteins and proteoglycans. In general, they are found on the exterior surface of cells. O- and N-linked glycans are very common in [[eukaryotes]] but may also be found, although less commonly, in [[prokaryotes]].\n\n=== N-Linked glycans ===<!-- This section is linked from [[N-linked-Glycan]] -->\n{{See also|N-linked glycosylation}}\n\n==== Introduction ====\n\nN-Linked glycans are attached in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] to the nitrogen (N) in the side chain of [[asparagine]] in the [[sequon]]. The sequon is an Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr sequence, where X is any amino acid except [[proline]] and the glycan may be composed of [[N-acetylgalactosamine|''N''-acetylgalactosamine]], [[galactose]], [[neuraminic acid]], [[N-acetylglucosamine|''N''-acetylglucosamine]], [[fucose]], [[mannose]], and other monosaccharides.\n\n==== Assembly ====\n\nIn eukaryotes, N-linked glycans are derived from a core 14-[[sugar]] unit assembled in the [[cytoplasm]] and [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. First, two [[N-Acetylglucosamine|''N''-acetylglucosamine]] residues are attached to [[dolichol monophosphate]], a lipid, on the external side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Five mannose residues are then added to this structure. At this point, the partially finished core glycan is flipped across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, so that it is now located within the reticular lumen. Assembly then continues within the endoplasmic reticulum, with the addition of four more mannose residues. Finally, three glucose residues are added to this structure. Following full assembly, the glycan is transferred en bloc by the [[glycosyltransferase]] [[oligosaccharyltransferase]] to a nascent peptide chain, within the reticular lumen. This core structure of N-linked glycans, thus, consists of 14 residues (3 glucose, 9 mannose, and 2 ''N''-acetylglucosamine).\n\nImage: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=glyco.figgrp.469\n\nDark squares are ''N''-acetylglucosamine; light circles are mannose; dark triangles are glucose.\n\n==== Processing, modification, and diversity ====\n\nOnce transferred to the nascent peptide chain, N-linked glycans, in general, undergo extensive processing reactions, whereby the three glucose residues are removed, as well as several mannose residues, depending on the N-linked glycan in question. The removal of the glucose residues is dependent on proper protein folding. These processing reactions occur in the [[Golgi apparatus]]. Modification reactions may involve the addition of a phosphate or acetyl group onto the sugars, or the addition of new sugars, such as [[neuraminic acid]]. Processing and modification of N-linked glycans within the Golgi does not follow a linear pathway. As a result, many different variations of N-linked glycan structure are possible, depending on enzyme activity in the Golgi.\n\n==== Functions and importance ====\n\nN-linked glycans are extremely important in proper protein folding in eukaryotic cells. [[Chaperone (protein)|Chaperone]] proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, such as [[calnexin]] and [[calreticulin]], bind to the three glucose residues present on the core N-linked glycan. These chaperone proteins then serve to aid in the folding of the protein that the glycan is attached to. Following proper folding, the three glucose residues are removed, and the glycan moves on to further processing reactions. If the protein fails to fold properly, the three glucose residues are reattached, allowing the protein to re-associate with the chaperones. This cycle may repeat several times until a protein reaches its proper conformation. If a protein repeatedly fails to properly fold, it is excreted from the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded by cytoplasmic proteases.\n\nN-linked glycans also contribute to protein folding by steric effects. For example, [[cysteine]] residues in the peptide may be temporarily blocked from forming disulfide bonds with other cysteine residues, due to the size of a nearby glycan. Therefore, the presence of a N-linked glycan allows the cell to control which cysteine residues will form disulfide bonds.\n\nN-linked glycans also play an important role in cell-cell interactions. For example, tumour cells make N-linked glycans that are abnormal. These are recognized by the CD337 receptor on [[Natural Killer cell]]s as a sign that the cell in question is cancerous.\n\nWithin the immune system the N-linked glycans on an immune cell's surface will help dictate that migration pattern of the cell, e.g. immune cells that migrate to the skin have specific glycosylations that favor homing to that site.<ref name = \"immune_glycan\"/> The glycosylation patterns on the various immunoglobulins including IgE, IgM, IgD, IgE, IgA, and IgG bestow them with unique effector functions by altering their affinities for Fc and other immune receptors.<ref name = \"immune_glycan\"/>  Glycans may also be involved in \"self\" and \"non self\" discrimination, which may be relevant to the pathophysiology of various autoimmune diseases;<ref name = \"immune_glycan\"/> including rheumatoid arthritis <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nakagawa | first1 = S | last2 = Hato | first2 = M | last3 = Takegawa | first3 = Y | last4 = Deguchi | first4 = K | last5 = Ito | first5 = H | last6 = Takahata | first6 = M | last7 = Iwasaki | first7 = N | last8 = Minami | first8 = A | last9 = Nishimura | first9 = S-I | year = 2007 | title = Detection of altered N-glycan profiles in whole serum from rheumatoid arthritis patients | url = | journal = J.

The modification of an N-linked glycan with a [[mannose-6-phosphate]] residue serves as a signal that the protein to which this glycan is attached should be moved to the lysosome. This recognition and trafficking of lysosomal enzymes by the presence of mannose-6-phosphate is accomplished by two proteins: CI-MPR (cation-independent [[mannose 6-phosphate receptor|mannose-6-phosphate receptor]]) and CD-MPR (cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor).\n\n=== O-Linked glycans ===\n\n==== Introduction ====\n\nIn eukaryotes, O-linked glycans are assembled one sugar at a time on a [[serine]] or [[threonine]] residue of a peptide chain in the Golgi apparatus. Unlike N-linked glycans, there is no known consensus sequence yet. However, the placement of a [[proline]] residue at either -1 or +3 relative to the serine or threonine is favourable for O-linked glycosylation.\n\n==== Assembly ====\n\nThe first monosaccharide attached in the synthesis of O-linked glycans is N-acetyl-galactosamine. After this, several different pathways are possible. A Core 1 structure is generated by the addition of galactose. A Core 2 structure is generated by the addition of N-acetyl-glucosamine to the N-acetyl-galactosamine of the Core 1 structure. Core 3 structures are generated by the addition of a single N-acetyl-glucosamine to the original N-acetyl-galactosamine. Core 4 structures are generated by the addition of a second N-acetyl-glucosamine to the Core 3 structure. Other core structures are possible, though less common.\n\nImages:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=glyco.figgrp.561 : Core 1 and Core 2 generation. White square = N-acetyl-galactosamine; black circle = galactose; Black square = N-acetyl-glucosamine. Note: There is a mistake in this diagram. The bottom square should always be white in each image, not black.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=glyco.figgrp.562 : Core 3 and Core 4 generation.\n\nA common structural theme in O-linked glycans is the addition of [[polylactosamine]] units to the various core structures. These are formed by the repetitive addition of galactose and N-acetyl-glucosamine units. Polylactosamine chains on O-linked glycans are often capped by the addition of a [[sialic acid]] residue (similar to neuraminic acid). If a [[fucose]] residue is also added, to the next to penultimate residue, a [[Sialyl-Lewis X]] (SLex) structure is formed.\n\n==== Functions and importance ====\n\n[[Sialyl lewis x]] is important in [[ABO]] blood antigen determination.\n\nSLex is also important to proper immune response. P-[[selectin]] release from [[Weibel\u2013Palade body|Weibel-Palade bodies]], on blood vessel endothelial cells, can be induced by a number of factors. One such factor is the response of the endothelial cell to certain bacterial molecules, such as [[peptidoglycan]]. P-selectin binds to the SLex structure that is present on neutrophils in the blood stream, and helps to mediate the [[extravasation]] of these cells into the surrounding tissue during an infection.\n\nO-linked glycans, in particular [[mucin]], have been found to be important in developing normal intestinal microflora. Certain strains of intestinal bacteria bind specifically to mucin, allowing them to colonize the intestine.\n\nExamples of O-linked [[glycoprotein]]s are:\n\n*[[Glycophorin]], a protein in [[erythrocyte]] [[cell membranes]]\n*Mucin, a protein in [[saliva]] involved in formation of [[dental plaque]]\n*[[Notch signaling|Notch]], a transmembrane receptor involved in development and cell fate decisions\n*[[Thrombospondin]]\n*[[Factor VII]]\n*[[Factor IX]]\n*Urinary type [[plasminogen activator]]\n\n===Glycosaminoglycans===\n\nAnother type of cellular glycan is the [[glycosaminoglycan]]s. These comprise 2-aminosugars linked  in an alternating fashion with [[uronic acid]]s, and include polymers such as heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin, keratan, and dermatan. Some glycosaminoglycans are found attached to the cell surface, where they are linked through a single xylosyl residue to a protein (forming a [[glycoprotein]]).\n\n*[[heparin]]\n*[[heparan sulfate]]\n*[[dermatan]]\n*[[Keratan sulfate]]\n*[[chondroitin]]\n\n==Glycoscience==\n\nA 2012 report from the [[U.S. National Research Council]] calls for a new focus on glycoscience, a field that explores the structures and functions of glycans and promises great advances in areas as diverse as medicine, energy generation, and materials science.<ref>{{cite web | title=U.S. National Research Council Report, ''Transforming Glycoscience: A Roadmap for the Future'' | url=http://dels.nas.edu/Report/Transforming-Glycoscience-Roadmap/13446}}</ref> Until now, glycans have received little attention from the research community due to a lack of tools to probe their often complex structures and properties.<ref>{{cite web | title=U.S. National Research Council Report-in-Brief, ''Transforming Glycoscience: A Roadmap for the Future'' | url=http://dels.nas.edu/Materials/Report-In-Brief/4292-Glycoscience}}</ref> The report presents a roadmap for transforming glycoscience from a field dominated by specialists to a widely studied and integrated discipline.\n\n== Glycans and lipids ==\n\nSee [[glycolipids]]\n\n== GPI-Anchors ==\n\nSee [[glycophosphatidylinositol]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Glycosylation]]\n*[[Glycoside]]\n*[[Glycoside hydrolase]]\n*[[Glycosyltransferase]]\n\n==Tools used for glycan research==\nThe following are examples of the commonly used techniques in glycan analysis:<ref name=\"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press\">{{cite book |title=Essentials of Glycobiology |publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press |edition=2nd |year=2009 |isbn=978-087969770-9  |url=http://www.cshlpress.com/default.tpl?action=full&--eqskudatarq=666}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aizpurua-Olaizola|first=O.|last2=Tora\u00f1o|first2=J.

The sequon is an Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr sequence, where X is any amino acid except [[proline]] and the glycan may be composed of [[N-acetylgalactosamine|''N''-acetylgalactosamine]], [[galactose]], [[neuraminic acid]], [[N-acetylglucosamine|''N''-acetylglucosamine]], [[fucose]], [[mannose]], and other monosaccharides.\n\n==== Assembly ====\n\nIn eukaryotes, N-linked glycans are derived from a core 14-[[sugar]] unit assembled in the [[cytoplasm]] and [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. First, two [[N-Acetylglucosamine|''N''-acetylglucosamine]] residues are attached to [[dolichol monophosphate]], a lipid, on the external side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Five mannose residues are then added to this structure. At this point, the partially finished core glycan is flipped across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, so that it is now located within the reticular lumen. Assembly then continues within the endoplasmic reticulum, with the addition of four more mannose residues. Finally, three glucose residues are added to this structure. Following full assembly, the glycan is transferred en bloc by the [[glycosyltransferase]] [[oligosaccharyltransferase]] to a nascent peptide chain, within the reticular lumen. This core structure of N-linked glycans, thus, consists of 14 residues (3 glucose, 9 mannose, and 2 ''N''-acetylglucosamine).\n\nImage: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=glyco.figgrp.469\n\nDark squares are ''N''-acetylglucosamine; light circles are mannose; dark triangles are glucose.\n\n==== Processing, modification, and diversity ====\n\nOnce transferred to the nascent peptide chain, N-linked glycans, in general, undergo extensive processing reactions, whereby the three glucose residues are removed, as well as several mannose residues, depending on the N-linked glycan in question. The removal of the glucose residues is dependent on proper protein folding. These processing reactions occur in the [[Golgi apparatus]]. Modification reactions may involve the addition of a phosphate or acetyl group onto the sugars, or the addition of new sugars, such as [[neuraminic acid]]. Processing and modification of N-linked glycans within the Golgi does not follow a linear pathway. As a result, many different variations of N-linked glycan structure are possible, depending on enzyme activity in the Golgi.\n\n==== Functions and importance ====\n\nN-linked glycans are extremely important in proper protein folding in eukaryotic cells. [[Chaperone (protein)|Chaperone]] proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, such as [[calnexin]] and [[calreticulin]], bind to the three glucose residues present on the core N-linked glycan. These chaperone proteins then serve to aid in the folding of the protein that the glycan is attached to. Following proper folding, the three glucose residues are removed, and the glycan moves on to further processing reactions. If the protein fails to fold properly, the three glucose residues are reattached, allowing the protein to re-associate with the chaperones. This cycle may repeat several times until a protein reaches its proper conformation. If a protein repeatedly fails to properly fold, it is excreted from the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded by cytoplasmic proteases.\n\nN-linked glycans also contribute to protein folding by steric effects. For example, [[cysteine]] residues in the peptide may be temporarily blocked from forming disulfide bonds with other cysteine residues, due to the size of a nearby glycan. Therefore, the presence of a N-linked glycan allows the cell to control which cysteine residues will form disulfide bonds.\n\nN-linked glycans also play an important role in cell-cell interactions. For example, tumour cells make N-linked glycans that are abnormal. These are recognized by the CD337 receptor on [[Natural Killer cell]]s as a sign that the cell in question is cancerous.\n\nWithin the immune system the N-linked glycans on an immune cell's surface will help dictate that migration pattern of the cell, e.g. immune cells that migrate to the skin have specific glycosylations that favor homing to that site.<ref name = \"immune_glycan\"/> The glycosylation patterns on the various immunoglobulins including IgE, IgM, IgD, IgE, IgA, and IgG bestow them with unique effector functions by altering their affinities for Fc and other immune receptors.<ref name = \"immune_glycan\"/>  Glycans may also be involved in \"self\" and \"non self\" discrimination, which may be relevant to the pathophysiology of various autoimmune diseases;<ref name = \"immune_glycan\"/> including rheumatoid arthritis <ref>Nakagawa S, Hato M, Takegawa Y, Deguchi K, Ito H, Takahata M, Iwasaki N, Minami A, Nishimura S-I (June 2007). \"Detection of altered N-glycan profiles in whole serum from rheumatoid arthritis patients\".

Diabetes Care. 41(1):79-87. doi: 10.2337/dc17-1042. {{PMID|29146600}}.</ref>\n\nThe targeting of degradative [[lysosomal]] enzymes is also accomplished by N-linked glycans. The modification of an N-linked glycan with a [[mannose-6-phosphate]] residue serves as a signal that the protein to which this glycan is attached should be moved to the lysosome. This recognition and trafficking of lysosomal enzymes by the presence of mannose-6-phosphate is accomplished by two proteins: CI-MPR (cation-independent [[mannose 6-phosphate receptor|mannose-6-phosphate receptor]]) and CD-MPR (cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor).\n\n=== O-Linked glycans ===\n\n==== Introduction ====\n\nIn eukaryotes, O-linked glycans are assembled one sugar at a time on a [[serine]] or [[threonine]] residue of a peptide chain in the Golgi apparatus. Unlike N-linked glycans, there is no known consensus sequence yet. However, the placement of a [[proline]] residue at either -1 or +3 relative to the serine or threonine is favourable for O-linked glycosylation.\n\n==== Assembly ====\n\nThe first monosaccharide attached in the synthesis of O-linked glycans is N-acetyl-galactosamine. After this, several different pathways are possible. A Core 1 structure is generated by the addition of galactose. A Core 2 structure is generated by the addition of N-acetyl-glucosamine to the N-acetyl-galactosamine of the Core 1 structure. Core 3 structures are generated by the addition of a single N-acetyl-glucosamine to the original N-acetyl-galactosamine. Core 4 structures are generated by the addition of a second N-acetyl-glucosamine to the Core 3 structure. Other core structures are possible, though less common.\n\nImages:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=glyco.figgrp.561 : Core 1 and Core 2 generation. White square = N-acetyl-galactosamine; black circle = galactose; Black square = N-acetyl-glucosamine. Note: There is a mistake in this diagram. The bottom square should always be white in each image, not black.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=glyco.figgrp.562 : Core 3 and Core 4 generation.\n\nA common structural theme in O-linked glycans is the addition of [[polylactosamine]] units to the various core structures. These are formed by the repetitive addition of galactose and N-acetyl-glucosamine units. Polylactosamine chains on O-linked glycans are often capped by the addition of a [[sialic acid]] residue (similar to neuraminic acid). If a [[fucose]] residue is also added, to the next to penultimate residue, a [[Sialyl-Lewis X]] (SLex) structure is formed.\n\n==== Functions and importance ====\n\n[[Sialyl lewis x]] is important in [[ABO]] blood antigen determination.\n\nSLex is also important to proper immune response. P-[[selectin]] release from [[Weibel\u2013Palade body|Weibel-Palade bodies]], on blood vessel endothelial cells, can be induced by a number of factors. One such factor is the response of the endothelial cell to certain bacterial molecules, such as [[peptidoglycan]]. P-selectin binds to the SLex structure that is present on neutrophils in the blood stream, and helps to mediate the [[extravasation]] of these cells into the surrounding tissue during an infection.\n\nO-linked glycans, in particular [[mucin]], have been found to be important in developing normal intestinal microflora. Certain strains of intestinal bacteria bind specifically to mucin, allowing them to colonize the intestine.\n\nExamples of O-linked [[glycoprotein]]s are:\n\n*[[Glycophorin]], a protein in [[erythrocyte]] [[cell membranes]]\n*Mucin, a protein in [[saliva]] involved in formation of [[dental plaque]]\n*[[Notch signaling|Notch]], a transmembrane receptor involved in development and cell fate decisions\n*[[Thrombospondin]]\n*[[Factor VII]]\n*[[Factor IX]]\n*Urinary type [[plasminogen activator]]\n\n===Glycosaminoglycans===\n\nAnother type of cellular glycan is the [[glycosaminoglycan]]s. These comprise 2-aminosugars linked  in an alternating fashion with [[uronic acid]]s, and include polymers such as heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin, keratan, and dermatan. Some glycosaminoglycans are found attached to the cell surface, where they are linked through a single xylosyl residue to a protein (forming a [[glycoprotein]]).\n\n*[[heparin]]\n*[[heparan sulfate]]\n*[[dermatan]]\n*[[Keratan sulfate]]\n*[[chondroitin]]\n\n==Glycoscience==\n\nA 2012 report from the [[U.S. National Research Council]] calls for a new focus on glycoscience, a field that explores the structures and functions of glycans and promises great advances in areas as diverse as medicine, energy generation, and materials science.<ref>{{cite web | title=U.S. National Research Council Report, ''Transforming Glycoscience: A Roadmap for the Future'' | url=http://dels.nas.edu/Report/Transforming-Glycoscience-Roadmap/13446}}</ref> Until now, glycans have received little attention from the research community due to a lack of tools to probe their often complex structures and properties.<ref>{{cite web | title=U.S. National Research Council Report-in-Brief, ''Transforming Glycoscience: A Roadmap for the Future'' | url=http://dels.nas.edu/Materials/Report-In-Brief/4292-Glycoscience}}</ref> The report presents a roadmap for transforming glycoscience from a field dominated by specialists to a widely studied and integrated discipline.\n\n== Glycans and lipids ==\n\nSee [[glycolipids]]\n\n== GPI-Anchors ==\n\nSee [[glycophosphatidylinositol]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Glycosylation]]\n*[[Glycoside]]\n*[[Glycoside hydrolase]]\n*[[Glycosyltransferase]]\n\n==Tools used for glycan research==\nThe following are examples of the commonly used techniques in glycan analysis:<ref name=\"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press\">{{cite book |title=Essentials of Glycobiology |publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press |edition=2nd |year=2009 |isbn=978-087969770-9  |url=http://www.cshlpress.com/default.tpl?action=full&--eqskudatarq=666}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aizpurua-Olaizola|first=O.|last2=Tora\u00f1o|first2=J.

Portrayed as a snobbish and self-centered character, Rimmer is unpopular with his crewmates, and is often the target of insults and general ridicule.\n\nAfter he is killed by a radiation leak during an [[ellipsis (narrative device)|ellipsis]] in the series' first episode \"[[The End (Red Dwarf)|The End]]\" (1988) Rimmer is present for most of the series as a computer-generated [[Holography|hologram]], indicated by the \u2018H\u2019 symbol on his forehead. From series I-V, Rimmer is intangible as a hologram and unable to interact with his environment, referred to in-universe as 'soft-light'; come the series VI episode \"[[Legion (Red Dwarf)|Legion]]\" (1993), Rimmer is upgraded as a 'hard-light' hologram where he is now able to interact with his surroundings as well as being essentially indestructible, yet still able to feel pain. Following the character's departure in the series VII episode \"[[Stoke Me a Clipper]]\" (1997), Rimmer is absent from the show until series VIII, where a flesh and blood version of Rimmer is shown having been resurrected by [[nanobot]]s with no memory of the hologrammatic Rimmer's experiences and only those of Rimmer prior to the radiation leak in the first episode. However, following a ten-year hiatus after series VIII, the character reappeared as a hologram in the miniseries ''[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth|Back to Earth]]'' (2009) onward.\n\nIt remains unclear whether this incarnation of Rimmer seen in ''Back to Earth'' and later series is the original hologram from series I-VII or a hologram of the Rimmer introduced in series VIII that was resurrected through [[nanotechnology]]. The fictional world of ''Red Dwarf'' would also allow for the possibility of Rimmer's latest incarnation being an amalgamation of the memories of both.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=M-Corp |episode-link=M-Corp (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Doug (writer/director) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |network=[[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] |station= |date=9 November 2017 |season= |series-no=XII |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Grant Naylor|creators]] of the series acknowledge that Rimmer's [[surname]] comes from a snobby [[Prefect#Academic|prefect]] with whom they attended school.

As a technician, Rimmer does maintenance work on [[vending machine]]s that not even the robots are assigned to. Rimmer is shown having difficulty revising for his \"engineer's exam\" which he hopes to pass and become an officer after having failed before prior to the episode, and reveals that he wasn't academy educated unlike others who had become officers. After Lister is awakened from [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]], where he was put as punishment for bringing an unquarantined cat on board, the ship's computer [[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]] ([[Norman Lovett]]) tells Lister that the ship's crew died in a radiation leak from a drive plate Rimmer had improperly repaired and Lister was kept in stasis until the radiation levels returned to normal three million years later. Rimmer is depicted as having been brought back to life as a [[hologram]], having the same drives, feelings and emotions as the living Rimmer, but being unable to touch anything. The only other survivor on board ''Red Dwarf'' is a creature called \"[[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]]\" ([[Danny John-Jules]]), a descendant of Lister's pregnant cat who was safely sealed in the hold along with her unborn kittens during the radioactive crisis.<ref name=\"the end\">{{Cite episode |title=The End |episode-link=The End (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=15 February 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of \"[[Future Echoes]]\" (1988), Rimmer claims to have taken the \"astronavigation exam\" without passing nine times, or \"[t]en, if you count the time [he] had [his] spasm.\" He also claims in this episode that his father had said, \"Shiny clean boots and a spanking short haircut, and you can cope with anything,\" right before \"that unfortunate [[suicide]] business\".<ref name=\"future echoes\">{{Cite episode |title=Future Echoes |episode-link=Future Echoes |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=22 February 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=2 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Balance of Power (Red Dwarf)|Balance of Power]]\" (1988), Holly reveals that reason Rimmer was brought back as a hologram was because, in Holly's judgment, Rimmer was the best person to keep Lister sane because the two had shared fourteen million words between each other, making Rimmer the crew member with which Lister had the most interaction; in Holly's judgment, the fact that their interactions were almost entirely antagonistic was irrelevant.

Rimmer denies this, pointing out he went to bed with Yvonne McGruder, but Lister says she thought Rimmer was someone else due to her wonky vision from a [[concussion]].

Rimmer's double reveals that all of Rimmer's brothers, but not Rimmer, were academy educated. Rimmer claims that this was because his father couldn't afford it. Rimmer also mentions taking a film course at [[night school]], although he confuses a cartoon showing at the cinema in the episode with ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. Lister watches a video of Rimmer's death, where his last words are \"[[gazpacho soup]]\". Demonstrating intense, literal [[self-hatred]], the second cruelly insults and berates the first. Believing that Lister is going to wipe his hologram anyway because of the two Rimmers' constant arguing, Rimmer explained his dying remark as referring to  a dinner at the captain's table with six officers, during which he made a ''faux pas'' where he had his gazpacho soup taken away to be brought back hot, not realising that gazpacho soup is meant to be served cold. This caused the officers at the table to laugh at him, and he was never invited back. The incident haunted Rimmer for the rest of his life (and beyond). Gradually, his obsession over the incident caused him to remember it as the most disastrous, imbecilic action of his life, and it undermined his self-esteem out of all proportion. Lister, displaying deep empathy, tried to comfort Rimmer, assuring him that \"anybody could make a mistake like that.\" His confession complete, Rimmer prepares to be wiped, but Lister wipes the second Rimmer instead; Lister had allowed Rimmer to believe his \"death\" was imminent because Lister wanted to know what the \"gazpacho soup\" remark meant, and he knew that Rimmer would never tell him any other circumstances.<ref name=\"me squared\">{{Cite episode |title=Me\u00b2 |episode-link=Me\u00b2 |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=21 March 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nDespite \"Future Echoes\" having previously suggested that Rimmer's father killed himself, according to a letter received from Rimmer's mother in \"[[Better Than Life (Red Dwarf)|Better Than Life]]\" (1988), Rimmer's father (played by [[John Abineri]]) had died peacefully in his sleep and Rimmer appeared unaware about how his father had died before Lister read out to Rimmer what his letter said. Rimmer's backstory in this episode revealed that Rimmer had hated his father, who had fixated on Rimmer and his three brothers to join the Space Corps and become officers when Rimmer's father had been rejected for being an inch below regulation height. To this end, he refused to allow them to eat unless they could answer complicated astronavigation questions. This led to Rimmer almost dying of [[malnutrition]].

After Rimmer is late for a lecture, Lecturer Rimmer uses Rimmer as a test subject in a social experiment regarding [[peer pressure]]. Three million years later, the hologrammatic Rimmer is seen on board ''Blue Midget'' being given the task of planning out a defensive strategy against a Simulant attack fleet; after failing to come up with one, Rimmer plays a recorded message from Lecturer Rimmer in an attempt to escape his feeling of being weighed down by his father's expectations. In the message Lecturer Rimmer, thinking that by now Arnold has achieved enough, reveals that Arnold is not his son, but that his real father was the family gardener Dungo. This revelation liberates Rimmer from the spectre of his lineage on the grounds that he has accomplished a great deal by the standards set by his biological father, and he is able to formulate a successful plan of attack that destroys the Simulant vessels before returning to ''Red Dwarf''.\n\nIt is strongly implied in this episode that this version of Rimmer remembers dying from the radiation leak but also remembers saving the ship from the corrosive micro-organism that was devouring it in the episode \"Only the Good...\".

Instead the radiation leak is an entirely unrelated event caused by the negligence of a navigation officer.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Grant |author-link=Grant Naylor |date=2 November 1989 |title=Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers |title-link=Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers |url= |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=46 |isbn=0-14-012437-3  |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Better Than Life]]'' (1990), similar to the [[Better Than Life (Red Dwarf episode)|episode of the same name]], the crew play Better Than Life, an extremely addictive [[virtual reality]] video game that slowly kills the user through tantalizing their yearnings by utilizing the user's [[subconscious]] desires. The crew slowly become engrossed in their individual fantasies, with Rimmer imagining himself as gaining enormous fame and adoration upon the crew's return to Earth and earning billions from memoirs and other deals. However, Rimmer's subconscious, unable to cope with good things happening to him, corrupts the game to make Rimmer's fantasy and later the other crew's fantasies go terribly wrong and make them want to leave the game. After Lister is trapped on another planet for over thirty years while the rest of the crew are trapped in the time dilation of a black hole, the now-sixty-year-old Lister has a heart attack while confronting a Polymorph, but Holly gives Rimmer instructions on how they can bring Lister back to life by taking him to a universe where time flows backwards.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Grant |author-link=Grant Naylor |date=25 October 1990 |title=Better Than Life |title-link=Better Than Life |url= |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nThe two novels follow divergent paths after the crew retrieve Lister from the backwards reality. \n\nIn ''[[Last Human]]'' (1995), Rimmer's one-night stand with Yvonne McGruder led to the birth of a son. Unbeknownst to either, there truly was mutual attraction, but both decided to wait for the other to make the first move after that one night- Rimmer to prove a point and McGruder because she was delusional due to her concussion- leading to their going separate ways. Yvonne transferred off ''Red Dwarf'' where she had Michael McGruder, who was born prior to the radiation leak that killed Rimmer and most of the crew onboard ''Red Dwarf''. She would tell him false stories of his father's courageous acts of valour and through these fictitious tales McGruder was inspired to become a Space Corps Marine and sign-up for a dangerous mission on board the ''Mayflower'', a large spaceship with [[terraformation]] capabilities, with the potential prospect of meeting his father, who via the [[black box]] of ''Red Dwarf'' he learned was resurrected as a hologram to keep the sole survivor, Lister, sane.\n\nFollowing a series of events, Lister had spent a period of time alongside McGruder and a handful of survivors from the ''Mayflower'', separate from the main crew of Rimmer, Kochanski, Cat, and Kryten. Upon their reunion with Lister, Rimmer was introduced to McGruder by Lister, who fainted at first glimpse of Rimmer, who also fainted when told who McGruder was. Later, encouraged by Lister, Rimmer confessed he was not the hero McGruder was told he was by his mother and that he should look up to her instead. However, McGruder was distraught by this and left, later being held hostage by Lister's Other Self, an evil doppelganger of the real Lister. Rimmer would choke when given the opportunity to incapacitate Lister's Other Self and was also taken hostage, further disappointing McGruder.\n\nImprisoned, Rimmer, with the help of Kryten, escapes and equips himself with a weapon he uses to defend the crew from Lister's Other Self, gaining the respect of Lister, Kochanski, and McGruder, but is shot through the light-bee and critically injured in the process. The crew manage to dispatch of Lister's Other Self but are quickly confronted by the Rage, a [[holism|gestalt]] manifestation of pure anger, which threatens to destroy everything in its path, including the crew. Rimmer, via his light-bee, volunteers to deliver the Oblivion Virus, the antidote able to eliminate the Rage. Kryten uploads in onto Rimmer's light-bee and as the crew take refuge in nearby caves Rimmer flings himself into the gestalt, killing it. Following this, the crew set up a search-party, headed by McGruder, to retrieve Rimmer's light-bee and hopefully bring him back.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Doug |author-link=Doug Naylor |date=1995 |title=Last Human |title-link=Last Human |url= |location= |publisher=[[Viking Books]] |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Backwards (novel)|Backwards]]'' (1996), after the crew spend a decade trapped on the backwards Earth, they return to their universe to find that ''Red Dwarf'' has been stolen and Holly basically destroyed by the [[List of Red Dwarf concepts#Simulants|Agonoids]], a race of [[misanthropic]] robots. The crew gain a brief ally in the form of Ace Rimmer, an alternate and dynamic version of Rimmer who arrived in their world in a dimension-hopping prototype ship, but Ace subsequently sacrifices himself to save Lister from an Agonoid. When one Agonoid kills the rest of his race so that he can be the one to torture Lister, the crew are able to expel him into deep space, but the agonoid is able to infect ''Starbug'' with the Armageddon Virus before they can return to ''Red Dwarf''. In an attempt to fight it, Kryten purposely contracts it himself and, in a simulation of the [[American frontier|American wild west]], is the sheriff of a small town in a battle against the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|Apocalypse Boys]], the simulated manifestation of the Armageddon Virus. Rimmer, alongside Lister and Cat, enter the simulation to help Kryten. However, the Apocalypse Boys prove stronger than anticipated and end up melting Rimmer's light-bee and destroying Kryten, as well as rending ''Starbug'' inoperable. With nothing left to keep them in this reality, Lister and the Cat use Ace's ship to travel to another reality where their counterparts died while playing ''Better Than Life'' but Rimmer and Kryten are still alive. \n\nIn the abridged audiobook, as read by author [[Rob Grant]], the wild west simulation section is cut and instead Rimmer's light-bee is sucked into deep space following a hostage crisis with the Agonoid, Djuhn'Keep, onboard ''Starbug''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Grant |first=Rob |author-link=Rob Grant |date=1996 |title=Backwards |title-link=Backwards (Red Dwarf) |url= |location= |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nRimmer's primary character traits include [[anal retentive|anal-retentiveness]], over-adherence to protocol, [[cowardice]], bitterness and a severely inflated ego which is likely a coping mechanism for his deep-seated sense of [[self-loathing]], which he tries but sometimes fails to hide from others.

Portrayed as a snobbish and self-centered character, Rimmer is unpopular with his crewmates, and is often the target of insults and general ridicule.\n\nAfter he is killed by a radiation leak during an [[ellipsis (narrative device)|ellipsis]] in the series' first episode \"[[The End (Red Dwarf)|The End]]\" (1988) Rimmer is present for most of the series as a computer-generated [[Holography|hologram]], indicated by the \u2018H\u2019 symbol on his forehead. From series I-V, Rimmer is intangible as a hologram and unable to interact with his environment, referred to in-universe as 'soft-light'; come the series VI episode \"[[Legion (Red Dwarf)|Legion]]\" (1993), Rimmer is upgraded as a 'hard-light' hologram where he is now able to interact with his surroundings as well as being essentially indestructible, yet still able to feel pain. Following the character's departure in the series VII episode \"[[Stoke Me a Clipper]]\" (1997), Rimmer is absent from the show until series VIII, where a flesh and blood version of Rimmer is shown having been resurrected by [[nanobot]]s with no memory of the hologrammatic Rimmer's experiences and only those of Rimmer prior to the radiation leak in the first episode. However, following a ten-year hiatus after series VIII, the character reappeared as a hologram in the miniseries ''[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth|Back to Earth]]'' (2009) onward.\n\nIt remains unclear whether this incarnation of Rimmer seen in ''Back to Earth'' and later series is the original hologram from series I-VII or a hologram of the Rimmer introduced in series VIII that was resurrected through [[nanotechnology]]. The fictional world of ''Red Dwarf'' would also allow for the possibility of Rimmer's latest incarnation being an amalgamation of the memories of both.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=M-Corp |episode-link=M-Corp (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Doug (writer/director) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |network=[[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] |station= |date=9 November 2017 |season= |series-no=XII |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Grant Naylor|creators]] of the series acknowledge that Rimmer's [[surname]] comes from a snobby [[Prefect#Academic|prefect]] with whom they attended school.

As a technician, Rimmer does maintenance work on [[vending machine]]s that not even the robots are assigned to. Rimmer is shown having difficulty revising for his \"engineer's exam\" which he hopes to pass and become an officer after having failed before prior to the episode, and reveals that he wasn't academy educated unlike others who had become officers. After Lister is awakened from [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]], where he was put as punishment for bringing an unquarantined cat on board, the ship's computer [[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]] ([[Norman Lovett]]) tells Lister that the ship's crew died in a radiation leak from a drive plate Rimmer had improperly repaired and Lister was kept in stasis until the radiation levels returned to normal three million years later. Rimmer is depicted as having been brought back to life as a [[hologram]], having the same drives, feelings and emotions as the living Rimmer, but being unable to touch anything.

Lister later asks Rimmer where the disc which contains Navigation Officer [[Kristine Kochanski]]'s ([[Clare Grogan|C P Grogan]]) hologram has been hidden so that Lister could go on a date with her, but Rimmer refuses to switch his own disc off to bring back Kochanski for an evening due to the risk that Lister might not turn Rimmer's hologram on again.<ref name=\"balance\">{{Cite episode |title=Balance of Power |episode-link=Balance of Power (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |author-link2=Doug Naylor |last2=Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=29 February 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=3 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Holly has the ability to override Rimmer and switch his disc off but cannot do so because Rimmer outranks Lister and he is programmed to prioritise the former's orders over the latter's.<ref name=\"balance\" />\n\nIn \"[[Confidence and Paranoia]]\" (1988), Lister believes that the only reason that Rimmer became a part of the love celibacy society was because he couldn't get a date, and he could never get a date because Rimmer's mum bought all of Rimmer's casual clothes. Rimmer denies this, pointing out he went to bed with Yvonne McGruder, but Lister says she thought Rimmer was someone else due to her wonky vision from a [[concussion]]. Lister, with the help of a solid manifestation of Lister's confidence (played by [[Craig Ferguson]]), deduces where Kochanski's personality disc is hidden as well as a means of how the ship can power two holograms at once. Lister is still unable to go on a date with Kochanski, however, as the disc inside Kochanski's box has been swapped with one containing a duplicate of Rimmer.<ref name=\"confidence\">{{Cite episode |title=Confidence and Paranoia |episode-link=Confidence and Paranoia |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=14 March 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nIn \"[[Me\u00b2]]\" (1988), Rimmer is shown moving in with his double as better company in the next bunkroom over from Lister. Rimmer's double reveals that all of Rimmer's brothers, but not Rimmer, were academy educated. Rimmer claims that this was because his father couldn't afford it. Rimmer also mentions taking a film course at [[night school]], although he confuses a cartoon showing at the cinema in the episode with ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. Lister watches a video of Rimmer's death, where his last words are \"[[gazpacho soup]]\". Demonstrating intense, literal [[self-hatred]], the second cruelly insults and berates the first. Believing that Lister is going to wipe his hologram anyway because of the two Rimmers' constant arguing, Rimmer explained his dying remark as referring to  a dinner at the captain's table with six officers, during which he made a ''faux pas'' where he had his gazpacho soup taken away to be brought back hot, not realising that gazpacho soup is meant to be served cold. This caused the officers at the table to laugh at him, and he was never invited back. The incident haunted Rimmer for the rest of his life (and beyond). Gradually, his obsession over the incident caused him to remember it as the most disastrous, imbecilic action of his life, and it undermined his self-esteem out of all proportion. Lister, displaying deep empathy, tried to comfort Rimmer, assuring him that \"anybody could make a mistake like that.\" His confession complete, Rimmer prepares to be wiped, but Lister wipes the second Rimmer instead; Lister had allowed Rimmer to believe his \"death\" was imminent because Lister wanted to know what the \"gazpacho soup\" remark meant, and he knew that Rimmer would never tell him any other circumstances.<ref name=\"me squared\">{{Cite episode |title=Me\u00b2 |episode-link=Me\u00b2 |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=21 March 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nDespite \"Future Echoes\" having previously suggested that Rimmer's father killed himself, according to a letter received from Rimmer's mother in \"[[Better Than Life (Red Dwarf)|Better Than Life]]\" (1988), Rimmer's father (played by [[John Abineri]]) had died peacefully in his sleep and Rimmer appeared unaware about how his father had died before Lister read out to Rimmer what his letter said. Rimmer's backstory in this episode revealed that Rimmer had hated his father, who had fixated on Rimmer and his three brothers to join the Space Corps and become officers when Rimmer's father had been rejected for being an inch below regulation height. To this end, he refused to allow them to eat unless they could answer complicated astronavigation questions. This led to Rimmer almost dying of [[malnutrition]].

After Rimmer is late for a lecture, Lecturer Rimmer uses Rimmer as a test subject in a social experiment regarding [[peer pressure]]. Three million years later, the hologrammatic Rimmer is seen on board ''Blue Midget'' being given the task of planning out a defensive strategy against a Simulant attack fleet; after failing to come up with one, Rimmer plays a recorded message from Lecturer Rimmer in an attempt to escape his feeling of being weighed down by his father's expectations. In the message Lecturer Rimmer, thinking that by now Arnold has achieved enough, reveals that Arnold is not his son, but that his real father was the family gardener Dungo. This revelation liberates Rimmer from the spectre of his lineage on the grounds that he has accomplished a great deal by the standards set by his biological father, and he is able to formulate a successful plan of attack that destroys the Simulant vessels before returning to ''Red Dwarf''.\n\nIt is strongly implied in this episode that this version of Rimmer remembers dying from the radiation leak but also remembers saving the ship from the corrosive micro-organism that was devouring it in the episode \"Only the Good...\". This is a combination of the respective memories of the hologram Rimmer, who later became Ace, and the resurrected Rimmer who faced Death in the Series VIII cliffhanger.

Rimmer accidentally creates a monstrous amalgamation of Rimmers (also played by Barrie) that absorbs all the other Rimmers apart from the original.

After multiple attempts at finding a suitable universe, Rimmer arrives in a universe where he is alive, married and a navigation officer.

There, Rimmer is under the persona of \"Officer Christopher Todhunter\" and dons a phony admiral uniform and [[fake mustache|false mustache]]. He encounters Lister, who has stolen the Mimas-equivalent of a [[taxi]] known as a 'Hopper' to earn money, and pays him to take him to the [[red-light district]] of the city where Rimmer plans to frequent a droid [[brothel]], while lying and saying he intends to eat at a restaurant.\n\nUnlike in the television series, Rimmer's incompetence does not cause the radiation leak that kills the crew. Instead the radiation leak is an entirely unrelated event caused by the negligence of a navigation officer.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Grant |author-link=Grant Naylor |date=2 November 1989 |title=Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers |title-link=Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers |url= |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=46 |isbn=0-14-012437-3  |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Better Than Life]]'' (1990), similar to the [[Better Than Life (Red Dwarf episode)|episode of the same name]], the crew play Better Than Life, an extremely addictive [[virtual reality]] video game that slowly kills the user through tantalizing their yearnings by utilizing the user's [[subconscious]] desires. The crew slowly become engrossed in their individual fantasies, with Rimmer imagining himself as gaining enormous fame and adoration upon the crew's return to Earth and earning billions from memoirs and other deals. However, Rimmer's subconscious, unable to cope with good things happening to him, corrupts the game to make Rimmer's fantasy and later the other crew's fantasies go terribly wrong and make them want to leave the game. After Lister is trapped on another planet for over thirty years while the rest of the crew are trapped in the time dilation of a black hole, the now-sixty-year-old Lister has a heart attack while confronting a Polymorph, but Holly gives Rimmer instructions on how they can bring Lister back to life by taking him to a universe where time flows backwards.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Grant |author-link=Grant Naylor |date=25 October 1990 |title=Better Than Life |title-link=Better Than Life |url= |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nThe two novels follow divergent paths after the crew retrieve Lister from the backwards reality. \n\nIn ''[[Last Human]]'' (1995), Rimmer's one-night stand with Yvonne McGruder led to the birth of a son. Unbeknownst to either, there truly was mutual attraction, but both decided to wait for the other to make the first move after that one night- Rimmer to prove a point and McGruder because she was delusional due to her concussion- leading to their going separate ways. Yvonne transferred off ''Red Dwarf'' where she had Michael McGruder, who was born prior to the radiation leak that killed Rimmer and most of the crew onboard ''Red Dwarf''. She would tell him false stories of his father's courageous acts of valour and through these fictitious tales McGruder was inspired to become a Space Corps Marine and sign-up for a dangerous mission on board the ''Mayflower'', a large spaceship with [[terraformation]] capabilities, with the potential prospect of meeting his father, who via the [[black box]] of ''Red Dwarf'' he learned was resurrected as a hologram to keep the sole survivor, Lister, sane.\n\nFollowing a series of events, Lister had spent a period of time alongside McGruder and a handful of survivors from the ''Mayflower'', separate from the main crew of Rimmer, Kochanski, Cat, and Kryten. Upon their reunion with Lister, Rimmer was introduced to McGruder by Lister, who fainted at first glimpse of Rimmer, who also fainted when told who McGruder was. Later, encouraged by Lister, Rimmer confessed he was not the hero McGruder was told he was by his mother and that he should look up to her instead. However, McGruder was distraught by this and left, later being held hostage by Lister's Other Self, an evil doppelganger of the real Lister. Rimmer would choke when given the opportunity to incapacitate Lister's Other Self and was also taken hostage, further disappointing McGruder.\n\nImprisoned, Rimmer, with the help of Kryten, escapes and equips himself with a weapon he uses to defend the crew from Lister's Other Self, gaining the respect of Lister, Kochanski, and McGruder, but is shot through the light-bee and critically injured in the process. The crew manage to dispatch of Lister's Other Self but are quickly confronted by the Rage, a [[holism|gestalt]] manifestation of pure anger, which threatens to destroy everything in its path, including the crew. Rimmer, via his light-bee, volunteers to deliver the Oblivion Virus, the antidote able to eliminate the Rage. Kryten uploads in onto Rimmer's light-bee and as the crew take refuge in nearby caves Rimmer flings himself into the gestalt, killing it. Following this, the crew set up a search-party, headed by McGruder, to retrieve Rimmer's light-bee and hopefully bring him back.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Doug |author-link=Doug Naylor |date=1995 |title=Last Human |title-link=Last Human |url= |location= |publisher=[[Viking Books]] |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Backwards (novel)|Backwards]]'' (1996), after the crew spend a decade trapped on the backwards Earth, they return to their universe to find that ''Red Dwarf'' has been stolen and Holly basically destroyed by the [[List of Red Dwarf concepts#Simulants|Agonoids]], a race of [[misanthropic]] robots. The crew gain a brief ally in the form of Ace Rimmer, an alternate and dynamic version of Rimmer who arrived in their world in a dimension-hopping prototype ship, but Ace subsequently sacrifices himself to save Lister from an Agonoid. When one Agonoid kills the rest of his race so that he can be the one to torture Lister, the crew are able to expel him into deep space, but the agonoid is able to infect ''Starbug'' with the Armageddon Virus before they can return to ''Red Dwarf''. In an attempt to fight it, Kryten purposely contracts it himself and, in a simulation of the [[American frontier|American wild west]], is the sheriff of a small town in a battle against the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|Apocalypse Boys]], the simulated manifestation of the Armageddon Virus. Rimmer, alongside Lister and Cat, enter the simulation to help Kryten. However, the Apocalypse Boys prove stronger than anticipated and end up melting Rimmer's light-bee and destroying Kryten, as well as rending ''Starbug'' inoperable. With nothing left to keep them in this reality, Lister and the Cat use Ace's ship to travel to another reality where their counterparts died while playing ''Better Than Life'' but Rimmer and Kryten are still alive. \n\nIn the abridged audiobook, as read by author [[Rob Grant]], the wild west simulation section is cut and instead Rimmer's light-bee is sucked into deep space following a hostage crisis with the Agonoid, Djuhn'Keep, onboard ''Starbug''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Grant |first=Rob |author-link=Rob Grant |date=1996 |title=Backwards |title-link=Backwards (Red Dwarf) |url= |location= |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nRimmer's primary character traits include [[anal retentive|anal-retentiveness]], over-adherence to protocol, [[cowardice]], bitterness and a severely inflated ego which is likely a coping mechanism for his deep-seated sense of [[self-loathing]], which he tries but sometimes fails to hide from others.

Kryten further argues that Rimmer only felt guilty for causing the accident because of his delusions about his importance to the mission, comparing him to a front-gate security guard who considers himself corporate head. Kryten then went on to state that Rimmer's only crime is that of being Arnold J. Rimmer, which should also serve as a punishment.

FC Schweinfurt 05 was founded on 5 May 1905 by a number of sports enthusiasts around first chairman Pepi Popp, who also designed the still unchanged club's logo. Until beginning of the [[First World War]], the team played in various local leagues. At that time the home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], which later became the venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1. Fussball-Club Schweinfurt 1905, Verein f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen e.V.''<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nWhile FC 05 did not reap the expected benefits from the brief union, it improved dramatically after re-establishing itself as an independent club. Membership grew significantly and a number of new sports departments were formed within the organization. The football team yielded its first fruits in 1927 by winning the Unterfranken Cup championship.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\">{{cite web|title=Geschichte des FC 05 Schweinfurt | trans-title=FC Schweinfurt 05 History|publisher=www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de | url=https://www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de/geschichte/geschichte-des-fc-05-schweinfurt/ |accessdate=26 July 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Years of excellence: 1931\u20131963===\n[[File:Andreas Kupfer and Albin Kitzinger.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Andreas Kupfer]] (left) and [[Albin Kitzinger]]]]\n\nSchweinfurt 05 finally gained first class status again with its entry into the [[Bezirksliga Bayern]] in 1931. \nWith the introduction of the [[Gauliga]] system after the [[Machtergreifung|Nazi takeover of power]] in 1933, the club became member of the top-flight [[Gauliga Bayern]]. \nSchweinfurt had a couple of successful seasons in this era, winning the Gauliga Bayern in [[1938\u201339 Gauliga Bayern|1939]] and [[1941\u201342 Gauliga Bayern|1942]], and qualifying for the [[List of German football champions|German football championship]] round. \nIn the German football championship [[1939 German football championship|1939]] competition, the team barely missed the semi-final qualification games after 3 wins in the group stage, where it defeated later [[1943 German football championship|1943]] and [[1944 German football championship|1944]] German champion [[Dresdner SC]] 1\u20130 in the first leg, but then lost to Dresden 0\u20131 in the deceisive away match.<ref name=\"Stumpf\">{{cite web|title=Ehemaliger 05-Torwart Hans Stumpf gestorben|trans-title=Former 05 goalkeeper Hans Stumpf passed|publisher=mainpost.de|url=https://www.mainpost.de/sport/schweinfurt/Ehemaliger-05-Torwart-Hans-Stumpf-gestorben;art795,5487291?wt_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2F&wt_t=1585256396531|accessdate=26 March 2020|language=German}}</ref>\nThe club failed in the round of 16 of the [[1942 German football championship|1942]] German football championship after a 1\u20132 loss to [[SG SS Stra\u00dfburg]].\n\nSchweinfurt made a semi-final appearance in the [[1936 Tschammerpokal]], when it was defeated 2\u20133 by [[FC Schalke 04]], the closest it ever came to winning a national title.

In the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga|1965\u201366]] season, the club became Southern German champion and made it to the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga#Bundesliga promotion round|Bundesliga advancement games]], but was unable to ascend to the top tier.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[2.

Schweinfurt 05 became a [[yo-yo club]] ascending and descending between tiers III and IV, with just a pair of brief 2. Bundesliga appearances in [[1990\u201391 2.

In the [[1989\u201390 DFB-Pokal|1989\u201390]] season the team made it into the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal]], where it lost 0\u20132 to [[Eintracht Braunschweig]].\n\nDisasters happened in 2004 when FC Schweinfurt 05 was forced to leave the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III) because of financial reasons, and in 2005 when the club went bankrupt. The results in the Bayernliga (IV) were annulled and the team was relegated to the fifth tier Landesliga.\n\nA re-structured club successfully worked its way back into Bayernliga in 2008. After it was relegated again to the Landesliga in 2009, the team returned to the Bayerliga immediately the following year. At the end of the [[2011\u201312 Bayernliga|2011\u201312]] season the club managed to qualify for the promotion round to the new [[Regionalliga Bayern]] (IV) and advanced to the second round, where the club missed out on promotion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Das war die Relegation 2012 auf Verbandsebene |publisher=www.fupa.net|url=http://www.fupa.net/berichte/so-laeuft-die-relegation-auf-verbandsebene-21714.html |accessdate=13 June 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\nThe club finally earned direct promotion to tier-four Regionalliga Bayern in the [[2012\u201313 Bayernliga|2012\u201313]] season by taking the championship in the Bayernliga northern division.\nSchweinfurt's first three Regionalliga years, however, were characterized by a permanent struggle against relegation.\nFC Schweinfurt 05 finished the [[2013\u201314 Regionalliga#Regionalliga Bayern|2013\u201314]] Regionalliga with a relegation play-off rank only courtesy of a controversial final game of the season.

At that time the home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], which later became the venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1. Fussball-Club Schweinfurt 1905, Verein f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen e.V.''<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nWhile FC 05 did not reap the expected benefits from the brief union, it improved dramatically after re-establishing itself as an independent club. Membership grew significantly and a number of new sports departments were formed within the organization. The football team yielded its first fruits in 1927 by winning the Unterfranken Cup championship.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\">{{cite web|title=Geschichte des FC 05 Schweinfurt | trans-title=FC Schweinfurt 05 History|publisher=www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de | url=https://www.schweinfurtfuehrer.de/geschichte/geschichte-des-fc-05-schweinfurt/ |accessdate=26 July 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\n===Years of excellence: 1931\u20131963===\n[[File:Andreas Kupfer and Albin Kitzinger.jpg|thumb|280px|right|[[Andreas Kupfer]] (left) and [[Albin Kitzinger]]]]\n\nSchweinfurt 05 finally gained first class status again with its entry into the [[Bezirksliga Bayern]] in 1931. \nWith the introduction of the [[Gauliga]] system after the [[Machtergreifung|Nazi takeover of power]] in 1933, the club became member of the top-flight [[Gauliga Bayern]]. \nSchweinfurt had a couple of successful seasons in this era, winning the Gauliga Bayern in [[1938\u201339 Gauliga Bayern|1939]] and [[1941\u201342 Gauliga Bayern|1942]], and qualifying for the [[List of German football champions|German football championship]] round. \nIn the German football championship [[1939 German football championship|1939]] competition, the team barely missed the semi-final qualification games after 3 wins in the group stage, where it defeated later [[1943 German football championship|1943]] and [[1944 German football championship|1944]] German champion [[Dresdner SC]] 1\u20130 in the first leg, but then lost to Dresden 0\u20131 in the deceisive away match.<ref name=\"Stumpf\">{{cite web|title=Ehemaliger 05-Torwart Hans Stumpf gestorben|trans-title=Former 05 goalkeeper Hans Stumpf passed|publisher=mainpost.de|url=https://www.mainpost.de/sport/schweinfurt/Ehemaliger-05-Torwart-Hans-Stumpf-gestorben;art795,5487291?wt_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2F&wt_t=1585256396531|accessdate=26 March 2020|language=German}}</ref>\nThe club failed in the round of 16 of the [[1942 German football championship|1942]] German football championship after a 1\u20132 loss to [[SG SS Stra\u00dfburg]].\n\nSchweinfurt made a semi-final appearance in the [[1936 Tschammerpokal]], when it was defeated 2\u20133 by [[FC Schalke 04]], the closest it ever came to winning a national title. Again in 1936, the club moved into its newly constructed stadium, the [[Willy-Sachs-Stadion]], a donation by local industrialist and patron [[Willy Sachs]].<ref name=\"Cicero\">{{cite web|title=Der braune Schatten|trans-title=The brown shadow|publisher=cicero.de|url=http://cicero.de/wirtschaft/der-braune-schatten/37229|accessdate=25 July 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\nAt that time, FC 05 midfielders [[Albin Kitzinger]] and [[Andreas Kupfer|Andreas 'Ander' Kupfer]] became renowned in international football as they formed one of the best half-back duos in Europe. Kitzinger and Kupfer were an essential part of the famous [[Breslau Eleven|Germany national team]] who defeated [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] 8\u20130 in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau]] ([[Poland]]) on 16 May 1937.<ref name=\"Wunderteam\"/> One year later they competed at the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], and were both called up to represent Germany within the FIFA selection [[Europe XI]] in the [[The Football Association|FA]] 75th anniversary game against [[England national football team|England]] at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]] in [[London]].\n\nDue to the [[Second World War]], Schweinfurt 05 merged with Luftwaffen SV Schweinfurt into KSG Schweinfurt for the [[1943\u201344 Gauliga Bayern|1943\u201344]] and [[1944\u201345 Gauliga Bayern|1944\u201345]] Gauliga seasons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gauligisten| trans-title=Gauliga clubs|publisher=www.deutscherfussball.info | url=https://www.deutscherfussball.info/Gauligisten-S-d--Sa_Se.htm |accessdate=24 August 2017}}</ref> The club temporarily had been dissolved in May 1945 under pressure from the occupying powers.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/>\n\nAfter World War II, the re-established 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 was integrated into the first tier [[Oberliga S\u00fcd (1945\u201363)|Oberliga S\u00fcd]]. The club played in the Oberliga for the duration of the league's existence until the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional league, was founded in 1963. Schweinfurt reached the round of the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal 1954\u201355|1954\u201355]] DFB-Pokal, where the team lost 0\u20131 in the replay against FC Schalke 04.\nOn the occasion of the club's 50th anniversary in 1955, Schweinfurt could demonstrate its level when the team achieved a 1\u20131 draw against [[Everton FC]], and defeated German champion [[Rot-Weiss Essen]] 3\u20131.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/>\n\nIn 1950, Andreas Kupfer became the first [[Captain (sports)|captain]] of the [[West Germany]] national football team on the occasion of his very final [[List of Germany international footballers|44th]] appearance. FC 05 goalkeeper [[G\u00fcnter Bernard]] made two West Germany appearances in 1962, before he joined Bundesliga founding member [[SV Werder Bremen]] one year later and was named in Germany's squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n===Second tier years: 1963\u20131976===\nAs it did not qualify for the newly established Bundesliga in 1963, Schweinfurt 05 found itself playing in the second tier [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1963\u20131974)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]]. In the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga|1965\u201366]] season, the club became Southern German champion and made it to the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga#Bundesliga promotion round|Bundesliga advancement games]], but was unable to ascend to the top tier.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[2. Bundesliga]] in 1974, Schweinfurt was founding member of the [[2. Bundesliga S\u00fcd (1974\u201381)|southern division]] despite only finishing 15th in the last Regionalliga year. For its first 2. Bundesliga season in [[1974\u201375 2. Bundesliga|1974\u201375]], the club had signed-up former national team [[forward (association football)|striker]] and [[List of Bundesliga top scorers|Bundesliga top scorer]] [[Lothar Emmerich]]. The team earned an excellent third place and barely missed the advancement games for promotion to Bundesliga.\n\n===Yo-yo years: 1976\u20132016===\n[[File:Schweinfurt Performance Chart.png|280px|thumb|Historical chart of the 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 league performance after 1945]]\nAfter the 1974\u201375 season, FC 05 began to falter: poor results and financial problems saw the club descend first to the [[Bayernliga]] (III) and then, for the first time in 1983, to the [[Landesliga Bayern-Nord]] (IV). Schweinfurt 05 became a [[yo-yo club]] ascending and descending between tiers III and IV, with just a pair of brief 2. Bundesliga appearances in [[1990\u201391 2. Bundesliga|1990\u201391]] and in [[2001\u201302 2. Bundesliga|2001\u201302]]. In the [[1989\u201390 DFB-Pokal|1989\u201390]] season the team made it into the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal]], where it lost 0\u20132 to [[Eintracht Braunschweig]].\n\nDisasters happened in 2004 when FC Schweinfurt 05 was forced to leave the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III) because of financial reasons, and in 2005 when the club went bankrupt. The results in the Bayernliga (IV) were annulled and the team was relegated to the fifth tier Landesliga.\n\nA re-structured club successfully worked its way back into Bayernliga in 2008. After it was relegated again to the Landesliga in 2009, the team returned to the Bayerliga immediately the following year. At the end of the [[2011\u201312 Bayernliga|2011\u201312]] season the club managed to qualify for the promotion round to the new [[Regionalliga Bayern]] (IV) and advanced to the second round, where the club missed out on promotion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Das war die Relegation 2012 auf Verbandsebene |publisher=www.fupa.net|url=http://www.fupa.net/berichte/so-laeuft-die-relegation-auf-verbandsebene-21714.html |accessdate=13 June 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\nThe club finally earned direct promotion to tier-four Regionalliga Bayern in the [[2012\u201313 Bayernliga|2012\u201313]] season by taking the championship in the Bayernliga northern division.\nSchweinfurt's first three Regionalliga years, however, were characterized by a permanent struggle against relegation.\nFC Schweinfurt 05 finished the [[2013\u201314 Regionalliga#Regionalliga Bayern|2013\u201314]] Regionalliga with a relegation play-off rank only courtesy of a controversial final game of the season.
