Led by [[Pietism|pietistic]] Protestants, they aimed to heal what they saw as an ill society beset by alcohol-related problems such as [[alcoholism]], [[Domestic violence|family violence]] and saloon-based [[political corruption]]. Many communities introduced alcohol bans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and enforcement of these new prohibition laws became a topic of debate. Prohibition supporters, called \"drys\", presented it as a battle for [[Public morality|public morals]] and health. The movement was taken up by social [[Progressives]] in the [[Prohibition Party|Prohibition]], Democratic, and Republican parties and gained a national grassroots base through the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]]. After 1900, it was coordinated by the [[Anti-Saloon League]]. Opposition from the beer industry mobilized \"wet\" supporters from the wealthy Catholic and German Lutheran communities, but the influence of these groups receded from 1917 following the entry of the US into the [[First World War]] against Germany.\n\nThe brewing industry was curtailed by a succession of state legislatures, and finally ended nationwide under the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1920, which passed \"with a 68 percent supermajority in the House of Representatives and 76 percent support in the Senate\" as well as ratification by 46 out of 48 states.<ref name=\"Schrad2020\">{{cite web |last1=Schrad |first1=Mark Lawrence |title=Why Americans Supported Prohibition 100 Years Ago |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/17/opinion/prohibition-anniversary-100.html |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=19 January 2020 |language=English |date=17 January 2020}}</ref> Enabling legislation, known as the [[Volstead Act]], set down the rules for enforcing the federal ban and defined the types of alcoholic beverages that were prohibited. Not all alcohol was banned; for example, [[communion wine|religious use of wine]] was permitted. Private ownership and consumption of alcohol were not made illegal under federal law, but local laws were stricter in many areas, with some states banning possession outright.\n\nFollowing the ban, criminal gangs gained control of the beer and liquor supply in many cities. By the late 1920s, a new opposition to prohibition emerged nationwide. Critics attacked the policy as causing crime, lowering local revenues, and imposing \"rural\" Protestant religious values on \"urban\" America.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret Sands Orchowski|title=The Law that Changed the Face of America: The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0hKCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA32|year=2015|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|page=32|isbn=9781442251373}}</ref> Prohibition ended with the ratification of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-first Amendment]], which repealed the Eighteenth Amendment on December 5, 1933, though prohibition continued in some states. To date, this is the only time in American history in which a constitutional amendment was passed for the purpose of repealing another.\n\nSome research indicates that alcohol consumption declined substantially due to Prohibition.<ref name=\"Moore1989\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/16/opinion/actually-prohibition-was-a-success.html|title=Actually, Prohibition Was a Success|author=Mark H.

The words of Rush and other early temperance reformers served to dichotomize the use of alcohol for men and women. While men enjoyed drinking and often considered it vital to their health, women who began to embrace the ideology of \"true motherhood\" refrained from consumption of alcohol.

The late 19th century saw the [[temperance movement]] broaden its focus from abstinence to include all behavior and institutions related to alcohol consumption. Preachers such as [[Mark A.

Saloons were more often than not linked to a specific brewery, where the saloonkeeper's operation was financed by a brewer and contractually obligated to sell the brewer's product to the exclusion of competing brands.

This new norm established women as a notable new target demographic for alcohol marketeers, who sought to expand their clientele.<ref name=\"Blocker, Jr. 2006 233\u2013243\"/> Women thus found their way into the bootlegging business, with some discovering that they could make a living by selling alcohol with a minimal likelihood of suspicion by law enforcement.<ref>O'Donnell, Jack. \"The Ladies of Rum Row\".

Those who were determined to find liquor could still do so, but those who saw their drinking habits as destructive typically had difficulty in finding the help they sought. Self-help societies had withered away along with the alcohol industry. In 1935 a new self-help group called [[Alcoholics Anonymous|Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)]] was founded.<ref name=\"Blocker, Jr. 2006 233\u2013243\"/>\n\nProhibition also had an effect on the [[Music of the United States|music industry in the United States]], specifically with [[jazz]]. [[Speakeasy|Speakeasies]] became very popular, and the [[Great Depression|Great Depression's]] migratory effects led to the dispersal of jazz music, from [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] going north through [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] and to New York. This led to the development of different styles in different cities. Due to its popularity in speakeasies and the emergence of advanced recording technology, jazz's popularity skyrocketed. It was also at the forefront of the minimal integration efforts going on at the time, as it united mostly black musicians with mostly white audiences.<ref>{{cite book | author =Lewis A.

In the 1950s [[muscle cars]] became popular and various roads became known as \"Thunder Road\" for their use by moonshiners.

Large-scale alcohol producers were shut down, for the most part, and some individual citizens took it upon themselves to produce alcohol illegally, essentially reversing the efficiency of mass-producing and retailing alcoholic beverages. Closing the country's manufacturing plants and taverns also resulted in an economic downturn for the industry. While the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] did not have this effect on the industry due to its failure to define an \"intoxicating\" beverage, the [[Volstead Act]]'s definition of 0.5% or more alcohol by volume shut down the brewers, who expected to continue to produce beer of moderate strength.<ref name=\"Blocker, Jr. 2006 233\u2013243\" />\n\nIn 1930 the Prohibition Commissioner estimated that in 1919, the year before the Volstead Act became law, the average drinking American spent $17 per year on alcoholic beverages. By 1930, because enforcement diminished the supply, spending had increased to $35 per year (there was no inflation in this period). The result was an illegal alcohol beverage industry that made an average of $3 billion per year in illegal untaxed income.<ref>{{cite journal|author=E. E.

Among [[Jews]], four rabbinical groups were approved, which led to some competition for membership, since the supervision of sacramental licenses could be used to secure donations to support a religious institution.

Wine historians note that Prohibition destroyed what was a fledgling wine industry in the United States.

Led by [[Pietism|pietistic]] Protestants, they aimed to heal what they saw as an ill society beset by alcohol-related problems such as [[alcoholism]], [[Domestic violence|family violence]] and saloon-based [[political corruption]]. Many communities introduced alcohol bans in the late 19th and early 20th century, and enforcement of these new prohibition laws became a topic of debate. Prohibition supporters, called \"drys\", presented it as a battle for [[Public morality|public morals]] and health. The movement was taken up by social [[Progressives]] in the [[Prohibition Party|Prohibition]], Democratic, and Republican parties and gained a national grassroots base through the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]]. After 1900, it was coordinated by the [[Anti-Saloon League]]. Opposition from the beer industry mobilized \"wet\" supporters from the wealthy Catholic and German Lutheran communities, but the influence of these groups receded from 1917 following the entry of the US into the [[First World War]] against Germany.\n\nThe brewing industry was curtailed by a succession of state legislatures, and finally ended nationwide under the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] in 1920, which passed \"with a 68 percent supermajority in the House of Representatives and 76 percent support in the Senate\" as well as ratification by 46 out of 48 states.<ref name=\"Schrad2020\">{{cite web |last1=Schrad |first1=Mark Lawrence |title=Why Americans Supported Prohibition 100 Years Ago |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/17/opinion/prohibition-anniversary-100.html |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=19 January 2020 |language=English |date=17 January 2020}}</ref> Enabling legislation, known as the [[Volstead Act]], set down the rules for enforcing the federal ban and defined the types of alcoholic beverages that were prohibited. Not all alcohol was banned; for example, [[communion wine|religious use of wine]] was permitted.

This new norm established women as a notable new target demographic for alcohol marketeers, who sought to expand their clientele.<ref name=\"Blocker, Jr. 2006 233\u2013243\"/> Women thus found their way into the bootlegging business, with some discovering that they could make a living by selling alcohol with a minimal likelihood of suspicion by law enforcement.<ref>O'Donnell, Jack. \"The Ladies of Rum Row\".

Those who were determined to find liquor could still do so, but those who saw their drinking habits as destructive typically had difficulty in finding the help they sought. Self-help societies had withered away along with the alcohol industry. In 1935 a new self-help group called [[Alcoholics Anonymous|Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)]] was founded.<ref name=\"Blocker, Jr. 2006 233\u2013243\"/>\n\nProhibition also had an effect on the [[Music of the United States|music industry in the United States]], specifically with [[jazz]]. [[Speakeasy|Speakeasies]] became very popular, and the [[Great Depression|Great Depression's]] migratory effects led to the dispersal of jazz music, from [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] going north through [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] and to New York. This led to the development of different styles in different cities. Due to its popularity in speakeasies and the emergence of advanced recording technology, jazz's popularity skyrocketed. It was also at the forefront of the minimal integration efforts going on at the time, as it united mostly black musicians with mostly white audiences.<ref>{{cite book | author =Lewis A.

In the 1950s [[muscle cars]] became popular and various roads became known as \"Thunder Road\" for their use by moonshiners. A popular [[ballad]] was created and the legendary drivers, cars, and routes were depicted on film in ''[[Thunder Road (1958 film)|Thunder Road]]''.<ref>[http://www.oldcarmemories.com/content/view/63/76/ Thunder Road \u2013 the First Muscle Car Movie] by Pete Dunton July 20, 2010 Old Car Memories</ref><ref>[http://jacksonville.com/news/premium/metro/2012-11-16/story/legend-moonshiners-thunder-road-lives-baker-county Legend of moonshiners' 'Thunder Road' lives on in Baker County] November 16, 2012 Jacksonville Metro</ref><ref>[http://www.metropulse.com/news/2010/jun/30/driving-tennessees-white-lightnin-trail-it-real-th/ Driving Tennessee's \"White Lightnin' Trail\"\u2014is it the Real Thunder Road?]; Jack Neely retraces the infamous bootlegger's route as it becomes an official state tourist attraction by Jack Neely MetroPulse June 30, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2007/feb/13/appalachian-journal-the-end-of-thunder-road/ Appalachian Journal: The end of Thunder Road]; Man known for whiskey cars, moonshine and rare auto parts is selling out by Fred Brown Knoxville News Sentinel February 13, 2007</ref>\n\nAs a result of Prohibition, the advancements of [[industrialization]] within the alcoholic beverage industry were essentially reversed. Large-scale alcohol producers were shut down, for the most part, and some individual citizens took it upon themselves to produce alcohol illegally, essentially reversing the efficiency of mass-producing and retailing alcoholic beverages. Closing the country's manufacturing plants and taverns also resulted in an economic downturn for the industry. While the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] did not have this effect on the industry due to its failure to define an \"intoxicating\" beverage, the [[Volstead Act]]'s definition of 0.5% or more alcohol by volume shut down the brewers, who expected to continue to produce beer of moderate strength.<ref name=\"Blocker, Jr. 2006 233\u2013243\" />\n\nIn 1930 the Prohibition Commissioner estimated that in 1919, the year before the Volstead Act became law, the average drinking American spent $17 per year on alcoholic beverages. By 1930, because enforcement diminished the supply, spending had increased to $35 per year (there was no inflation in this period). The result was an illegal alcohol beverage industry that made an average of $3 billion per year in illegal untaxed income.<ref>{{cite journal|author=E. E.

Among [[Jews]], four rabbinical groups were approved, which led to some competition for membership, since the supervision of sacramental licenses could be used to secure donations to support a religious institution. There were known abuses in this system, with imposters or unauthorized agents using loopholes to purchase wine.<ref name=\"Last Call\"/><ref name=Sprecher>{{cite web|author=Hannah Sprecher |title=\"Let Them Drink and Forget Our Poverty\": Orthodox Rabbis React to Prohibition|url=http://americanjewisharchives.org/publications/journal/PDF/1991_43_02_00_sprecher.pdf|publisher=American Jewish Archives|accessdate=September 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nProhibition had a notable effect on the alcohol brewing industry in the United States. Wine historians note that Prohibition destroyed what was a fledgling wine industry in the United States. Productive, wine-quality grapevines were replaced by lower-quality vines that grew thicker-skinned grapes, which could be more easily transported. Much of the institutional knowledge was also lost as winemakers either emigrated to other wine-producing countries or left the business altogether.<ref>{{cite book | author =Karen MacNeil | title =The Wine Bible | publisher = | series = | volume = | edition = | year = | location = | pages =630\u201331 | url =  | isbn =| author-link =Karen MacNeil }}</ref> Distilled spirits became more popular during Prohibition.<ref name=\"Lusk, Rufus S 1932\"/> Because of its higher alcohol content in comparison to fermented wine and beer, it became common to mix and dilute the hard alcohol.<ref name=\"Lusk, Rufus S 1932\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|United States|Drink}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*Cultural and religious foundation\n** [[Timothy Shay Arthur]]\n** [[Bootleggers and Baptists]]\n** [[Ethnocultural politics in the United States]]\n** [[Christianity and alcohol]]\n** [[Teetotalism]]\n** [[Women's suffrage in the United States]]\n*Controlled substances\n** [[Beer in the United States]]\n** [[Ethanol]]\n** [[Moonshine]]\n*Legal foundation\n** [[Drug prohibition]]\n** [[Dry county]]\n** [[Dry state]]\n** [[Webb-Kenyon Act]]\n** [[Medicinal Liquor Prescriptions Act of 1933|Medicinal Liquor Prescriptions Act]]\n** [[Legal drinking age]]\n** [[Prohibition]]\n** [[Prohibition in Canada]]\n** [[Repeal of Prohibition]]\n** [[Rocco Perri]]\n*Lawbreakers and illegal practices\n** [[American gangsters during the 1920s]]\n** [[Chicago Outfit]]\n** [[Rum-running]]\n** [[Organized crime]]\n** [[The Purple Gang]]\n*Places involved in smuggling\n** [[Free State of Galveston]]\n** [[Govenlock, Saskatchewan]]\n** [[Whiskey Gap, Alberta]]\n*Law-enforcement organizations\n** [[Izzy Einstein and Moe Smith]]\n** [[Untouchables (law enforcement)|The Untouchables]]\n** [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF)\n** [[Bureau of Prohibition]]\n** [[United States Coast Guard]]\n** [[United States Customs and Border Protection]]\n** [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE)\n*Similar policies and institutions\n** [[War on Drugs]]\n** [[Controlled Substances Act]]\n** [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BuzNzm-x0l8C&pg=PA23|title=Alcohol and Temperance in Modern History: An International Encyclopedia|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2003|isbn=9781576078334|location=|page=23|author=Blocker, Jack S., et al. eds}}\n* {{cite video |first1=Ken|last1=Burns|first2=Lynn|last2=Novick|author-link1=Ken Burns|author-link2=Lynn Novick|date=October 2011\n|title=Prohibition |url=https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/prohibition/watch-video/#id=15393956 |publisher=PBS |isbn=978-1-60883-430-3 |oclc=738476083 |language=|type=}}\n* Haygood, Atticus G.

It was the 16th annual event and took place on July 24, 2005, at the [[KeyBank Center|HSBC Arena]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]. The event featured wrestlers and other talent that performed on the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]] program.\n\nThe [[main event]] was [[Dave Batista|Batista]] defending the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] against [[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] (JBL). JBL won the match after Batista was [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualified]], but did not win the title because a championship can only be won via [[pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission]]. One of the featured matches on the [[undercard]] was [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.|Rey Mysterio]] versus [[Eddie Guerrero]], which Mysterio won by pinfall. The other was [[Orlando Jordan]] versus [[Chris Benoit]] for the [[WWE United States Championship]], which Jordan won, also by pinfall.\n\nThe event grossed over US$375,000 in ticket sales from an attendance of 8,000, and received about 233,000&nbsp;pay-per-view buys, the same amount as the [[The Great American Bash (2006)|following year's event]]. This enabled WWE's pay-per-view revenue to increase by $4.7&nbsp;million from the previous year. When the 2005 event was released on [[DVD]], it reached a peak position of second on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s DVD Sales Chart. The event was also available free of charge for [[Military of the United States|Armed Forces]] members and their families.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2005/wwe-corporate-wwe-and-american-forces-network-partner-to-provide-the-great-american-bash-pay-per-view-free-to-troops|title=WWE and American Forces Network Partner To Provide The Great American Bash Pay-Per-View Free To Troops.|date=2005-07-19|publisher=WWE|accessdate=2008-08-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310103626/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2005/wwe-corporate-wwe-and-american-forces-network-partner-to-provide-the-great-american-bash-pay-per-view-free-to-troops|archivedate=2016-03-10}}</ref>\n\n==Storylines==\nThe Great American Bash event featured a [[card (professional wrestling)|card]], which contained matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing [[Teleplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative|storylines]]. Wrestlers portrayed either a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villainous]] or [[Face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] gimmick as they followed a series of events which generally built tension, leading to a wrestling match.

The buildup to the match began when [[WWE Championship|WWE Champion]] [[John Cena]] was drafted to the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] brand, taking the title with him and leaving SmackDown! without a top-tier championship for the heavyweight division. [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Managers 2|General Manager]] [[Theodore Long]], a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, announced a match between six wrestlers for a new top-tier SmackDown! championship. On the June 30 episode of the ''SmackDown!'' television program, the match took place between JBL, [[Chris Benoit]], [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]], [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]], [[Mark Copani|Muhammad Hassan]], and [[The Undertaker]]. JBL was victorious in the match, but Long announced that he was still not the champion.

It was followed by a spin-off sequel in 1976 entitled ''[[Yus, My Dear]]'', starring Mullard and Watts.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Arthur Mullard]] - Wally Briggs\n*[[Queenie Watts]] - Lily Briggs\n*[[James Beck]] - Bert Jones ''(series 1 and 2)''\n*[[Jo Rowbottom]] - Betty Jones ''(series 1 and 2)''\n*[[Kevin Brennan (actor)|Kevin Brennan]] - Mr Gibson ''(series 1 and 2)''\n*Maureen Sweeney as Val Finch ''(series 2-5)''\n*[[Jonathan Cecil]] - Jeremy Crichton-Jones ''(series 3 and 4)''\n*[[Gay Soper]] - Susan Crichton-Jones ''(series 3 and 4)''\n*[[Alan Ford (actor)|Alan Ford]] as Ken ''(series 3 and 4)''\n\n==Episodes==\n===Pilot (1972)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

At the August pay-per-view event, [[SummerSlam (2005)|SummerSlam]], Orton defeated The Undertaker, where he [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinned]] him after performing an [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|RKO]] following interference from his father, [[Bob Orton, Jr.|\"Cowboy\" Bob Orton]]. This led to a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|Handicap]] [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Casket match]] between Undertaker and Orton and his father at [[No Mercy (2005)|No Mercy]].

Orton, who won the match for SmackDown!, was able to escape the attack. Then, on the December 2 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Undertaker called Orton to face him inside Hell in a Cell at Armageddon, which was made official.\n\nThe pay-per-view event featured the buildup of a rivalry among two [[tag team]]s, a group of at least two wrestlers. The two groups were [[Dave Batista|Batista]] and [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.|Rey Mysterio]] versus [[Big Show and Kane]].

JBL would have most of the offense for the entire match, since at the beginning of the match, Hardy got caught up, neck first, between the top and middle rope, and stayed there for a little while as JBL proceeded to choke, punch and kick his head in. After attacking Hardy for a few minutes, JBL illegally ripped off a turnbuckle pad, sent Hardy into it and executed a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Lariat|Clothesline From Hell]] for the win.\n\nIn the second match, The Mexicools (Super Crazy and Psicosis) faced MNM ([[Adam Birch|Joey Mercury]] and [[John Morrison (wrestler)|Johnny Nitro]]) (with Melina). Psichosis and Crazy performed many high-flying moves, landing a corkscrew as well as a tope con hilo over the referee's back. Melina got involved, tripping up Psichosis and taking away his momentum. MNM used their double teaming tactics to wear down Psichosis, keeping him isolated from making the tag. Once the tag was made, Crazy controlled most of the offense for the rest of the match. Melina tried to get involved again, but was sent down for her troubles. Crazy executed a moonsault on Joey Mercury, but Johnny Nitro broke the pinfall, leading to [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Flapjack DDT|the Snapshot]] for the win.\n\nIn the third match, [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] (with [[Sharmell Sullivan-Huffman|Sharmell]]) faced [[Chris Benoit]] in match four of a best of seven series match for the vacant [[WWE United States Championship]]. There were multiple chops and suplexes from both wrestlers. They seemed to be a little off their game however, floundering a bit at times. Several Crossface attempts, as well as a low blow/scissor kick combination from Sharmell and Booker all failed to win the match for both wrestlers. With Booker down, Benoit executed a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving headbutt|Diving headbutt]], only for a near-fall. Benoit once again went for the [[crossface]], but this time Booker rolled through and hit referee [[Jim Korderas]]. Benoit was quick to apply the [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]], forcing Booker to submit but the referee was out. Sharmell came in and hit Benoit with the broom, but that did not affect him. As he was distracted, Booker attacked Benoit, setting up for the Book End, which was reversed into a DDT and Benoit forced Booker to submit with a Crossface for the victory.\n\nIn the fourth match, [[Bobby Lashley]] faced [[William Regal]] and [[Paul Burchill]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|2-on-1 Handicap Match]]. Lashley was in control for most of the match. He used the [[Powerbomb#Inverted powerbomb|Dominator]] on Burchill to win the match.\n\nIn the fifth match, [[Juventud Guerrera|Juventud]] faced [[Kid Kash]] for the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship (1991-2007)|WWE Cruiserweight Championship]]. In the end, Kash went for a springboard moonsault, but caught a pair of knees to the midsection. Juventud then executed a huricanrana off the top rope, and executed a Juvi Driver for the two count. Kash countered a front flip leg drop with a [[Brainbuster#Jumping brainbuster|Dead Level]] to win the title.\n\nIn the sixth match, [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Champions]] [[Rey Mysterio]] and [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] faced [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Champions]] [[Big Show]] and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] in an Interpromotional Tag Team Champions vs Champions match. Each team demonstrated their strength, with Mysterio being the only man out of place. The match evolved into a brawl, with Batista and Big Show wrestling over the broadcast table, as Mysterio executed [[Tiger Feint kick|619]] to Kane. He went for the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Springboard hurricanrana|West Coast Pop]], but Kane caught him in midair, [[chokeslamming]] him for the win.\n\n===Main event===\nIn the main event, [[The Undertaker]] faced [[Randy Orton]] (with [[Bob Orton, Jr.|Bob Orton]]) inside [[Hell in a Cell]]. During the match, Undertaker hit Orton with a steel chair, bloodying Orton. Orton hit Undertaker with the steel steps, bloodying Undertaker also. \"Cowboy\" Bob Orton tried intervening, but Undertaker executed a Big Boot, causing the Cell and Bob to collide, causing a laceration. Orton executed a Diving Splash through a table on Undertaker for a near-fall. Orton ducked a punch from Undertaker that caught referee [[Nick Hamilton|Nick Patrick]], bloodying him as well. As referees and EMTs came down, Bob entered the Cell. Orton executed an [[cutter (professional wrestling)#jumping cutter|RKO]], but there was no referee to make the count. [[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]] made the count, but Undertaker kicked out at two. The Undertaker executed a [[Powerbomb#Elevated powerbomb|Last Ride]] on Orton but Bob broke up the pinfall, leading Undertaker to attack Bob. Undertaker attempted a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Kneeling reverse piledriver|Tombstone Piledriver]] on Orton but Orton reversed into a Tombstone on Undertaker for a near-fall. Bob tried to get involved again but Undertaker attacked Bob. Undertaker hit Bob and Orton with an Urn and executed a Tombstone on Bob. Undertaker executed a Tombstone Piledriver on Orton to win the match.\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn the \"Best of Seven\" series, [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]] ended up winning the vacant [[WWE United States Championship]] on the January 13, 2006 edition of [[WWE Friday Night SmackDown|SmackDown]] in [[Philadelphia]], with the help of [[Randy Orton]]. The feud between [[Randy Orton]] and [[The Undertaker]] ended in the [[Hell in a Cell]] match after the feud ran for about nine months. [[Dave Batista|Batista]] and [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.|Rey Mysterio]], who were the [[WWE Tag Team Championship (2002\u20132010)|WWE Tag Team Championship]] holders at the time, lost the title to the team of [[MNM (wrestling)|MNM]] after Batista suffered a legitimate injury in early 2006, sidelining him for up to seven months. [[Big Show]] and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] continued to reign as World Tag Team Champions until April 2006.\n\n==Results==\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|results = <ref name=\"WWE results\"/>\n|times = <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=5062|title=WWE Armageddon 2005 \u00ab Events Database \u00ab CAGEMATCH - The Internet Wrestling Database|website=www.cagematch.net|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n|heat1  = yes\n|match1 = [[Jamie Noble]] defeated [[Shoichi Funaki|Funaki]]<ref name=\"PWH\"/><ref name=\"OWW\">{{cite web|date=2005-12-18|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/armageddon05.html|title=Armageddon 2005 results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-04-22| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506022257/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/armageddon05.html|archivedate=6 May 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|stip1  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]]\n|time1  = 03:30\n|match2 = [[John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] (with [[Jillian Hall]]) defeated [[Matt Hardy]]\n|stip2  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]]\n|time2  = 6:20\n|match3 = [[MNM (professional wrestling)|MNM]] ([[Joey Mercury]] and [[John Morrison (wrestler)|Johnny Nitro]]) (with [[Melina Perez|Melina]]) defeated [[The Mexicools]] ([[Psicosis]] and [[Super Crazy]])\n|stip3  = [[Tag team match]]\n|time3  = 8:50\n|match4 = [[Chris Benoit]] defeated [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] (with [[Sharmell]]) by submission\n|stip4  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]] for the vacant [[WWE United States Championship]]<br />Fourth in the best of seven series\n|time4  = 20:11\n|match5 = [[Bobby Lashley]] defeated [[Paul Burchill]] and [[William Regal]]\n|stip5  = 2-on-1 [[Handicap match]]\n|time5  = 3:30\n|match6 = [[Kid Kash]] defeated [[Juventud Guerrera|Juventud]] (c)\n|stip6  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]] for the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship (1991\u20132007)|WWE Cruiserweight Championship]]\n|time6  = 9:00\n|match7 = [[Big Show and Kane]] defeated [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] and [[Rey Mysterio]]\n|stip7  = [[Tag team match]]\n|time7  = 8:33\n|match8 = [[The Undertaker]] defeated [[Randy Orton]] (with [[Bob Orton Jr.|Bob Orton]])<ref name=\"Taker vs Orton\"/>\n|stip8  = [[Hell in a Cell match]]\n|time8  = 30:29\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080309231549/http://www.wwe.com/shows/armageddon/history/2005/ Official Armageddon 2005 website]\n\n{{WWEPPV|Armageddon}}\n{{2005 WWE pay-per-view events}}\n\n[[Category:WWE Armageddon|2006]]\n[[Category:2005 in Rhode Island]]\n[[Category:Events in Rhode Island]]\n[[Category:Professional wrestling in Providence, Rhode Island]]\n[[Category:2005 WWE pay-per-view events]]\n[[Category:December 2005 events in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2005 World Wrestling Entertainment pay-per-view event}}\n{{Infobox Wrestling event\n|name       = Armageddon (2005)\n|image      = Armageddon 2005.jpg\n|alt        =\n|caption    = Promotional poster featuring [[Dave Batista|Batista]]\n|promotion  = [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]\n|brand      = [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]]\n|date       = December 18, 2005\n|venue      = [[Dunkin' Donuts Center]]\n|city       = [[Providence, Rhode Island]]\n|attendance = 8,000<ref name=\"PWH\">{{cite web|url=http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/supercards/usa/wwf/armageddon.html#2005|title= Armageddon 2005 results|publisher=Pro Wrestling History|accessdate=2008-04-22}}</ref>\n|lastevent  = [[Survivor Series (2005)|Survivor Series]]\n|nextevent  = [[New Year's Revolution (2006)|New Year's Revolution]]\n|event      = [[WWE Armageddon|Armageddon]]\n|lastevent2 = [[Armageddon (2004)|2004]]\n|nextevent2 = [[Armageddon (2006)|2006]]\n}}\n'''Armageddon (2005)''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|event]] produced by [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE).

At the August pay-per-view event, [[SummerSlam (2005)|SummerSlam]], Orton defeated The Undertaker, where he [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinned]] him after performing an [[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|RKO]] following interference from his father, [[Bob Orton, Jr.|\"Cowboy\" Bob Orton]]. This led to a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|Handicap]] [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Casket match]] between Undertaker and Orton and his father at [[No Mercy (2005)|No Mercy]]. At the event, Orton and his father defeated Undertaker, and set the casket, which Orton locked Undertaker in, which was scripted to be on fire. The proceeding month, at [[Survivor Series (2005)|Survivor Series]], the Undertaker returned and attacked several SmackDown! superstars following a 5-on-5 [[Survivor Series match]] between Raw and SmackDown!. Orton, who won the match for SmackDown!, was able to escape the attack. Then, on the December 2 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Undertaker called Orton to face him inside Hell in a Cell at Armageddon, which was made official.\n\nThe pay-per-view event featured the buildup of a rivalry among two [[tag team]]s, a group of at least two wrestlers. The two groups were [[Dave Batista|Batista]] and [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.|Rey Mysterio]] versus [[Big Show and Kane]]. On the November 11 episode of ''SmackDown!'', an Interpromotional [[Professional wrestling match types#Hardcore-based variations|Street Fight]] match was scheduled between Batista and [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]].<ref name=\"November 11\">{{cite news|url= http://www.wrestleview.com/news2005/1131775217.shtml|title=Raw ambushes SmackDown|date=2005-11-11|work=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=2008-12-29|publisher=wrestleview.com| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081122063307/http://www.wrestleview.com/news2005/1131775217.shtml| archivedate= 22 November 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Edge, who earlier in the night, pleaded to Batista not go through the match.

JBL would have most of the offense for the entire match, since at the beginning of the match, Hardy got caught up, neck first, between the top and middle rope, and stayed there for a little while as JBL proceeded to choke, punch and kick his head in. After attacking Hardy for a few minutes, JBL illegally ripped off a turnbuckle pad, sent Hardy into it and executed a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Lariat|Clothesline From Hell]] for the win.\n\nIn the second match, The Mexicools (Super Crazy and Psicosis) faced MNM ([[Adam Birch|Joey Mercury]] and [[John Morrison (wrestler)|Johnny Nitro]]) (with Melina). Psichosis and Crazy performed many high-flying moves, landing a corkscrew as well as a tope con hilo over the referee's back. Melina got involved, tripping up Psichosis and taking away his momentum. MNM used their double teaming tactics to wear down Psichosis, keeping him isolated from making the tag. Once the tag was made, Crazy controlled most of the offense for the rest of the match. Melina tried to get involved again, but was sent down for her troubles. Crazy executed a moonsault on Joey Mercury, but Johnny Nitro broke the pinfall, leading to [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Flapjack DDT|the Snapshot]] for the win.\n\nIn the third match, [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] (with [[Sharmell Sullivan-Huffman|Sharmell]]) faced [[Chris Benoit]] in match four of a best of seven series match for the vacant [[WWE United States Championship]]. There were multiple chops and suplexes from both wrestlers. They seemed to be a little off their game however, floundering a bit at times. Several Crossface attempts, as well as a low blow/scissor kick combination from Sharmell and Booker all failed to win the match for both wrestlers. With Booker down, Benoit executed a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving headbutt|Diving headbutt]], only for a near-fall. Benoit once again went for the [[crossface]], but this time Booker rolled through and hit referee [[Jim Korderas]]. Benoit was quick to apply the [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]], forcing Booker to submit but the referee was out. Sharmell came in and hit Benoit with the broom, but that did not affect him. As he was distracted, Booker attacked Benoit, setting up for the Book End, which was reversed into a DDT and Benoit forced Booker to submit with a Crossface for the victory.\n\nIn the fourth match, [[Bobby Lashley]] faced [[William Regal]] and [[Paul Burchill]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Handicap match|2-on-1 Handicap Match]]. Lashley was in control for most of the match. He used the [[Powerbomb#Inverted powerbomb|Dominator]] on Burchill to win the match.\n\nIn the fifth match, [[Juventud Guerrera|Juventud]] faced [[Kid Kash]] for the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship (1991-2007)|WWE Cruiserweight Championship]]. In the end, Kash went for a springboard moonsault, but caught a pair of knees to the midsection. Juventud then executed a huricanrana off the top rope, and executed a Juvi Driver for the two count. Kash countered a front flip leg drop with a [[Brainbuster#Jumping brainbuster|Dead Level]] to win the title.\n\nIn the sixth match, [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Champions]] [[Rey Mysterio]] and [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] faced [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|World Tag Team Champions]] [[Big Show]] and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] in an Interpromotional Tag Team Champions vs Champions match. Each team demonstrated their strength, with Mysterio being the only man out of place. The match evolved into a brawl, with Batista and Big Show wrestling over the broadcast table, as Mysterio executed [[Tiger Feint kick|619]] to Kane. He went for the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Springboard hurricanrana|West Coast Pop]], but Kane caught him in midair, [[chokeslamming]] him for the win.\n\n===Main event===\nIn the main event, [[The Undertaker]] faced [[Randy Orton]] (with [[Bob Orton, Jr.|Bob Orton]]) inside [[Hell in a Cell]]. During the match, Undertaker hit Orton with a steel chair, bloodying Orton. Orton hit Undertaker with the steel steps, bloodying Undertaker also. \"Cowboy\" Bob Orton tried intervening, but Undertaker executed a Big Boot, causing the Cell and Bob to collide, causing a laceration. Orton executed a Diving Splash through a table on Undertaker for a near-fall. Orton ducked a punch from Undertaker that caught referee [[Nick Hamilton|Nick Patrick]], bloodying him as well. As referees and EMTs came down, Bob entered the Cell. Orton executed an [[cutter (professional wrestling)#jumping cutter|RKO]], but there was no referee to make the count. [[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]] made the count, but Undertaker kicked out at two. The Undertaker executed a [[Powerbomb#Elevated powerbomb|Last Ride]] on Orton but Bob broke up the pinfall, leading Undertaker to attack Bob. Undertaker attempted a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)#Kneeling reverse piledriver|Tombstone Piledriver]] on Orton but Orton reversed into a Tombstone on Undertaker for a near-fall. Bob tried to get involved again but Undertaker attacked Bob. Undertaker hit Bob and Orton with an Urn and executed a Tombstone on Bob. Undertaker executed a Tombstone Piledriver on Orton to win the match.\n\n==Aftermath==\nIn the \"Best of Seven\" series, [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]] ended up winning the vacant [[WWE United States Championship]] on the January 13, 2006 edition of [[WWE Friday Night SmackDown|SmackDown]] in [[Philadelphia]], with the help of [[Randy Orton]]. The feud between [[Randy Orton]] and [[The Undertaker]] ended in the [[Hell in a Cell]] match after the feud ran for about nine months. [[Dave Batista|Batista]] and [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.|Rey Mysterio]], who were the [[WWE Tag Team Championship (2002\u20132010)|WWE Tag Team Championship]] holders at the time, lost the title to the team of [[MNM (wrestling)|MNM]] after Batista suffered a legitimate injury in early 2006, sidelining him for up to seven months. [[Big Show]] and [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] continued to reign as World Tag Team Champions until April 2006.\n\n==Results==\n{{Pro Wrestling results table\n|results = <ref name=\"WWE results\"/>\n|times = <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=5062|title=WWE Armageddon 2005 \u00ab Events Database \u00ab CAGEMATCH - The Internet Wrestling Database|website=www.cagematch.net|access-date=2019-10-02}}</ref>\n|heat1  = yes\n|match1 = [[Jamie Noble]] defeated [[Shoichi Funaki|Funaki]]<ref name=\"PWH\"/><ref name=\"OWW\">{{cite web|date=2005-12-18|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/armageddon05.html|title=Armageddon 2005 results|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-04-22| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506022257/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/armageddon05.html|archivedate=6 May 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|stip1  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]]\n|time1  = 03:30\n|match2 = [[John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] (with [[Jillian Hall]]) defeated [[Matt Hardy]]\n|stip2  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]]\n|time2  = 6:20\n|match3 = [[MNM (professional wrestling)|MNM]] ([[Joey Mercury]] and [[Johnny Nitro]]) (with [[Melina Perez|Melina]]) defeated [[The Mexicools]] ([[Psicosis]] and [[Super Crazy]])\n|stip3  = [[Tag team match]]\n|time3  = 8:50\n|match4 = [[Chris Benoit]] defeated [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] (with [[Sharmell]]) by submission\n|stip4  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]] for the vacant [[WWE United States Championship]]<br />Fourth in the best of seven series\n|time4  = 20:11\n|match5 = [[Bobby Lashley]] defeated [[Paul Burchill]] and [[William Regal]]\n|stip5  = 2-on-1 [[Handicap match]]\n|time5  = 3:30\n|match6 = [[Kid Kash]] defeated [[Juventud Guerrera|Juventud]] (c)\n|stip6  = [[Singles match (professional wrestling)|Singles match]] for the [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship (1991\u20132007)|WWE Cruiserweight Championship]]\n|time6  = 9:00\n|match7 = [[Big Show and Kane]] defeated [[Dave Bautista|Batista]] and [[Rey Mysterio]]\n|stip7  = [[Tag team match]]\n|time7  = 8:33\n|match8 = [[The Undertaker]] defeated [[Randy Orton]] (with [[Bob Orton Jr.|Bob Orton]])<ref name=\"Taker vs Orton\"/>\n|stip8  = [[Hell in a Cell match]]\n|time8  = 30:29\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080309231549/http://www.wwe.com/shows/armageddon/history/2005/ Official Armageddon 2005 website]\n\n{{WWEPPV|Armageddon}}\n{{2005 WWE pay-per-view events}}\n\n[[Category:WWE Armageddon|2006]]\n[[Category:2005 in Rhode Island]]\n[[Category:Events in Rhode Island]]\n[[Category:Professional wrestling in Providence, Rhode Island]]\n[[Category:2005 WWE pay-per-view events]]\n[[Category:December 2005 events in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toJohnny Nitro(link changed toJohn Morrison (wrestler)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armageddon_(2005)"}
