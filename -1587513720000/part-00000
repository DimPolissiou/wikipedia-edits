He is currently signed to [[WWE]] where he performs under the [[ring name]] '''Edge'''.\n\nCopeland was trained by professional wrestlers [[Sweet Daddy Siki]] and [[Ron Hutchison]]. Throughout the 1990s, he wrestled in various United States [[Independent circuit|independent promotions]]. During his time in these promotions, he competed in singles and tag team competition, the latter with longtime best friend Jason Reso. In 1997, Copeland signed a developmental deal with the WWF and was rebranded as the storyline brother of [[Christian Cage|Christian]], Reso's WWF persona. He made his televised debut the following June under the ring name Edge. In July 1999, he won the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Championship]] at a [[house show]] in [[Toronto]], marking his first title reign with the company. [[Edge and Christian]], billed as brothers and later childhood friends in WWF/WWE [[Kayfabe|storylines]], went on to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] on seven different occasions. During this time, they gained notoriety in the tag team division, partly due to their participation in [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match]]es. He retired in April 2011 due to several neck injuries, but returned to competition in the [[Royal Rumble (2020)|2020 Royal Rumble match]] after a nine-year retirement.\n\nIn WWE Edge has won the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] a record [[List of World Heavyweight Champions (WWE)|seven times]], the [[WWE Championship]] [[List of WWE Champions|four times]], the Intercontinental Championship five times, the [[WWE United States Championship|United States Championship]] once, the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF/World Tag Team Championship]] a record twelve times, and the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]] [[list of WWE Raw Tag Team Champions|twice]]. He is WWE's [[Triple Crown (professional wrestling)#List of WWE Triple Crown Champions|14th Triple Crown Champion]] and [[Grand Slam (professional wrestling)#Current format|7th Grand Slam Champion]]. He also won the [[King of the Ring tournament]] in [[King of the Ring (2001)|2001]], was the first [[Money in the Bank ladder match]] winner in [[WrestleMania 21|2005]], and won the [[Royal Rumble|Royal Rumble match]] in [[Royal Rumble (2010)|2010]], making him the first wrestler in history to achieve all three of those accomplishments.<ref>{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Ryan|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/edge-career-history|title=WWE \"Living on the Edge: The Career of Adam Copeland\"|publisher=Wwe.com|date=April 14, 2011|accessdate=October 30, 2011}}</ref> He headlined multiple [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|pay-per-view events]] for WWE (including [[WrestleMania XXIV]]) and was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] by Christian in 2012.

[[Edge and Christian]], billed as brothers and later childhood friends in WWF/WWE [[Kayfabe|storylines]], went on to win the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] on seven different occasions. During this time, they gained notoriety in the tag team division, partly due to their participation in [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match]]es. He retired in April 2011 due to several neck injuries, but returned to competition in the [[Royal Rumble (2020)|2020 Royal Rumble match]] after a nine-year retirement.\n\nIn WWE Edge has won the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] a record [[List of World Heavyweight Champions (WWE)|seven times]], the [[WWE Championship]] [[List of WWE Champions|four times]], the Intercontinental Championship five times, the [[WWE United States Championship|United States Championship]] once, the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF/World Tag Team Championship]] a record twelve times, and the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]] [[list of WWE Raw Tag Team Champions|twice]].
