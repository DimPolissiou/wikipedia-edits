Without management, almost all of these grasslands would eventually turn into [[forests]] by [[succession]].\n\nNatural grasslands are maintained by [[natural grazers]], performing [[natural grazing]].\n\nIn Europe, grassland is usually linked to human management. Most grasslands are used as cultivated land for intensive agriculture. \nGrasslands within intensive agriculture show very little biodiversity.\n\nHistorical agriculture (before 1950 or earlier) was also based on mainly grazing grasslands. This resulted in high biodiversity, so part of the ancestral maintained grasslands has been designated as a [[nature reserve]]. \n\nFor historic [[grassland]]s, grazing livestock, [[herbivore]]s, were a crucial part of the ecosystem. When grazers are removed, historically grazed lands show a decline in the diversity of the vegetation, soil and fauna.  The history of the land, particular [[traditional ancient knowledge]], may help ecologists and conservationists determine the best approach to a conservation project.&nbsp;\n\nFor natural grasslands, knowledge of history can also help restoration and conservation.\n<ref name=\"ref3\">[https://archive.today/20130105203129/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118487870/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 History distribution and challenges to bison recovery in the northern Chihuahuan desert] ''Rurik, L., G.

Both showed that an intermediate approach is the best method.  The nonnatives did demonstrate that they were not as well adapted to the [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]]s, such as [[drought]].

Plants that are adapted to extensive grazing (such as that done by cattle) will respond quicker and more effectively to grazing than native species that have not had to cope with intense grazing pressure in the past. An experiment done by ''Kimball and Schiffman'' showed that grazing increased the cover of some [[Endemism|native]] species but did not decrease the cover of nonnative species. The species diversity of the native plants was able to respond to the grazing and increase diversity. The community would become denser than originally with the increased biodiversity.

Land management in the form of grazing tends to decrease diversity with increased intensity. ''Kruess and Tscharntke'' attribute this difference to the increased height of grasses in the ungrazed areas.  The study showed that the abundance and [[diversity of insects]] (such as butterfly adults, trap-nesting bees and wasps) were increased by increased grass height.  However, other insects such as grasshoppers responded better to [[heterogeneity]] of the vegetation.<ref name=\"ref13\">[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=14420971 Grazing Intensity and the Diversity of Grasshoppers, Butterflies, Trap-Nesting Bees and Wasps] ''Kruess, A. and T.

Crawley and S. Povembshi''. Diversity and Distributions, 2003, 9(6): 415-426.</ref> When rabbits graze in moderation they can create a more complex ecosystem, by creating more variable environments that will allow for more predator-competitor relationships between the various organisms.<ref name=\"ref16\" />  However, besides the effect on wild vegetation, rabbits destroy crops, compete with other herbivores, and can result in extreme ecological damage.  Competition can be direct or indirect.  The rabbits may specifically eat the competitions target food or it may inhibit the growth of grasses that other species eat. For example, rabbit grazing in the Netherlands inhibits tall grasses from becoming dominant. This in turn enhances the suitability of the pasture for [[brent goose]]. However, they may benefit predators that do better in open areas, because the rabbits reduce the amount of vegetation making it easier for those predators to spot their prey.<ref name=\"ref16\" />\n\nFinally, grazing has demonstrated use in clearing dry brush to reduce the fire hazard of drought-stricken areas.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.brownalumnimagazine.com/content/view/3251/40/ |title=American Pastoral |date=Sep\u2013Oct 2012 |publisher=Brown Alumni Monthly}}</ref>\n\n==Effect on ephemeral wetlands==\n\n[[Ephemeral]] [[wetlands]] degradation and [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] had, at one point in time, been blamed on mismanaged grazing of both native and non-native [[ungulates]] and other grazers.  A study done by Jaymee Marty of [[The Nature Conservancy]] examined the effects on the [[vernal pools]] formed in California when grazers were removed.<ref name=\"ref18\">[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=17172393 Effects of Cattle Grazing on Diversity in Ephemeral Wetlands] ''Marty, J.T''. Conservation Biology, 2005, 19(5): 1626-1632.</ref>  The results of the short study showed that areas where grazers were removed had a lower diversity of native grasses, invertebrates and vertebrates in the pools, with an increase in non-native grass abundance and distribution in the area.  The study also demonstrated reduced reproduction success of individual species in the area, such as the [[Spea hammondii|western spadefoot toad]] and [[California tiger salamander]].  Marty argues that this decrease is due to ecosystems adapting to historical changes in grazers and the effects they have.  In other words, the historic ecosystem, theoretically, would have responded positively to the removal of cattle grazing, however, the system has adapted to the European introduced species and now may require them for maintained diversity.<ref name=\"ref18\" /> In another study performed by ''Pyke and Marty'', measurements showed that on average, vernal ponds on grazed land pooled longer than ungrazed areas and soil was more resistant to water absorption in the grazed areas.<ref name=\"ref19\">[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=17172392 Cattle grazing Mediates Climate change impacts on Ephemeral Wetlands] ''Pyke, C.R. and J.

However, understanding livestock and plant responses to grazing are critical in developing a targeted grazing program.  The program should have a clear statement of the kind of animal, timing and rate of grazing necessary to suppress troublesome plants and maintain a healthy landscape.  The grazing application should 1) cause significant damage to the target plants 2) limit damage to desired vegetation and 3) be integrated with other control strategies.  First, to cause significant damage to targeted plants requires understanding when the target plant is most susceptible to grazing damage and when they are most palatable to livestock.  Target plant palatability depends on the grazing animals inherited and developed plant preferences (i.e. the shape of sheep and goat's mouths make them well suited for eating broad leaf weeds). Goats are also well designed for eating shrubs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Luginbuhl|first1=J. M.|title=Use of Goats as Biological Agents for the Control of Unwanted Vegetation|url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/an_sci/extension/animal/meatgoat/MGVeget.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Launchbaugh|first1=K|title=Targeted Grazing: A natural approach to vegetation management and landscape enhancement|date=2006|publisher=National Sheep Industry Improvement Center in Cooperation with the American Sheep Industry Association}}</ref> Second, target plants often exist in a plant community with many desirable plants.  The challenge is to select the correct animal, grazing time and grazing intensity to maximize the impact on the target plant while reducing it on the associated plant community. Finally, management objectives, target plant species, weather, topography, plant physiology, and associated plant communities are among the many variables that can determine treatment type and duration. Well-developed targeted grazing objectives and an [[adaptive management]] plan that takes into account other control strategies need to be in place.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ecology|Environment}}\n*[[Epping Forest]]\n*[[New Forest]]\n*[[Oostvaardersplassen]]\n*[[Milovice Nature Reserve]]\n*[[Holistic management (agriculture)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite news |title=Got Weeds?

Without management, almost all of these grasslands would eventually turn into [[forests]] by [[succession]].\n\nNatural grasslands are maintained by [[natural grazers]], performing [[natural grazing]].\n\nIn Europe, grassland is usually linked to human management. Most grasslands are used as cultivated land for intensive agriculture. \nGrasslands within intensive agriculture show very little biodiversity.\n\nHistorical agriculture (before 1950 or earlier) was also based on mainly grazing grasslands. This resulted in high biodiversity, so part of the ancestral maintained grasslands has been designated as a [[nature reserve]]. \n\nFor historic [[grassland]]s, grazing livestock, [[herbivore]]s, were a crucial part of the ecosystem. When grazers are removed, historically grazed lands show a decline in the diversity of the vegetation, soil and fauna.  The history of the land, particular [[traditional ancient knowledge]], may help ecologists and conservationists determine the best approach to a conservation project.&nbsp;\n\nFor natural grasslands, knowledge of history can also help restoration and conservation.\n<ref name=\"ref3\">[https://archive.today/20130105203129/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118487870/abstract?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0 History distribution and challenges to bison recovery in the northern Chihuahuan desert] ''Rurik, L., G.

The study showed that the abundance and [[diversity of insects]] (such as butterfly adults, trap-nesting bees and wasps) were increased by increased grass height.  However, other insects such as grasshoppers responded better to [[heterogeneity]] of the vegetation.<ref name=\"ref13\">[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=14420971 Grazing Intensity and the Diversity of Grasshoppers, Butterflies, Trap-Nesting Bees and Wasps] ''Kruess, A. and T.

''Kuhnert et al.'' observed that different bird species react in different ways to changes in grazing intensity.<ref name=\"ref14\">[https://archive.today/20130105070633/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/110500501/abstract Assessing the Impacts of grazing levels on bird density in woodland habitat: a Bayesian approach using expert opinion] ''Kuhnert, P.M, T.G. Martin, [[Kerrie Mengersen|K. Mengersen]], and H.P Possingham''. Environmetrics, 2005, 16(7): 717-747.</ref> Grazing has also been thought to decrease the abundance of vertebrates, such as the [[prairie dog]] and the [[desert tortoise]]. However, ''Kazmaier et al.'' found that moderate grazing by cattle had no effect on the [[Texas tortoise]].<ref name=\"ref7\" />\n\nRabbits have been widely discussed due to their influences on land composition. ''Bell and Watson'' found that rabbits show grazing preference for different plant species.<ref name=\"ref15\">[https://archive.today/20130105130645/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119289808/abstract Preferential grazing of five varieties of spring barley by wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus)] ''Bell, A.C. and S. Watson''.

Delibes, P. Ferreras, and R. Villafuerte''. Conservation Biology, 2008, 22(5): 1106-1117.</ref>  In some cases, if the preference is for a non-native, invasive plant, rabbit grazing may benefit the community by reducing non-native abundance and creating room for the native plant species to fill.<ref name=\"ref17\">[https://archive.today/20130105114805/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118852271/abstract The Effects of herbivory and competition on the invasive alien plant Senecio inaequidens (asteraceae)] ''Scherber, C., M.J. Crawley and S. Povembshi''. Diversity and Distributions, 2003, 9(6): 415-426.</ref> When rabbits graze in moderation they can create a more complex ecosystem, by creating more variable environments that will allow for more predator-competitor relationships between the various organisms.<ref name=\"ref16\" />  However, besides the effect on wild vegetation, rabbits destroy crops, compete with other herbivores, and can result in extreme ecological damage.  Competition can be direct or indirect.  The rabbits may specifically eat the competitions target food or it may inhibit the growth of grasses that other species eat. For example, rabbit grazing in the Netherlands inhibits tall grasses from becoming dominant. This in turn enhances the suitability of the pasture for [[brent goose]]. However, they may benefit predators that do better in open areas, because the rabbits reduce the amount of vegetation making it easier for those predators to spot their prey.<ref name=\"ref16\" />\n\nFinally, grazing has demonstrated use in clearing dry brush to reduce the fire hazard of drought-stricken areas.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.brownalumnimagazine.com/content/view/3251/40/ |title=American Pastoral |date=Sep\u2013Oct 2012 |publisher=Brown Alumni Monthly}}</ref>\n\n==Effect on ephemeral wetlands==\n\n[[Ephemeral]] [[wetlands]] degradation and [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] had, at one point in time, been blamed on mismanaged grazing of both native and non-native [[ungulates]] and other grazers.  A study done by Jaymee Marty of [[The Nature Conservancy]] examined the effects on the [[vernal pools]] formed in California when grazers were removed.<ref name=\"ref18\">[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=17172393 Effects of Cattle Grazing on Diversity in Ephemeral Wetlands] ''Marty, J.T''. Conservation Biology, 2005, 19(5): 1626-1632.</ref>  The results of the short study showed that areas where grazers were removed had a lower diversity of native grasses, invertebrates and vertebrates in the pools, with an increase in non-native grass abundance and distribution in the area.  The study also demonstrated reduced reproduction success of individual species in the area, such as the [[Spea hammondii|western spadefoot toad]] and [[California tiger salamander]].  Marty argues that this decrease is due to ecosystems adapting to historical changes in grazers and the effects they have.  In other words, the historic ecosystem, theoretically, would have responded positively to the removal of cattle grazing, however, the system has adapted to the European introduced species and now may require them for maintained diversity.<ref name=\"ref18\" /> In another study performed by ''Pyke and Marty'', measurements showed that on average, vernal ponds on grazed land pooled longer than ungrazed areas and soil was more resistant to water absorption in the grazed areas.<ref name=\"ref19\">[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=17172392 Cattle grazing Mediates Climate change impacts on Ephemeral Wetlands] ''Pyke, C.R. and J.

Targeted grazing can rival traditional herbicide and mechanical control methods for invasive plants from invasive forb to juniper trees, and has been used to reduce fine fuels in fire prone areas.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Longwell|first1=T|title=Weed control and fire hazard reduction in forest ecosystems with sheep grazing |url=http://ag.ansc.purdue.edu/sheep/ansc442/Semprojs/forest/sheep.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gordon|first1=K|title=Use targeted grazing to take aim at invasive weeds |journal=Beef Magazine |date=May 2007 |url=http://beefmagazine.com/cowcalfweekly/target-grazing-invasive-weeds}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=C.

However, understanding livestock and plant responses to grazing are critical in developing a targeted grazing program.  The program should have a clear statement of the kind of animal, timing and rate of grazing necessary to suppress troublesome plants and maintain a healthy landscape.  The grazing application should 1) cause significant damage to the target plants 2) limit damage to desired vegetation and 3) be integrated with other control strategies.  First, to cause significant damage to targeted plants requires understanding when the target plant is most susceptible to grazing damage and when they are most palatable to livestock.  Target plant palatability depends on the grazing animals inherited and developed plant preferences (i.e. the shape of sheep and goat's mouths make them well suited for eating broad leaf weeds). Goats are also well designed for eating shrubs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Luginbuhl|first1=J. M.|title=Use of Goats as Biological Agents for the Control of Unwanted Vegetation|url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/an_sci/extension/animal/meatgoat/MGVeget.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Launchbaugh|first1=K|title=Targeted Grazing: A natural approach to vegetation management and landscape enhancement|date=2006|publisher=National Sheep Industry Improvement Center in Cooperation with the American Sheep Industry Association}}</ref> Second, target plants often exist in a plant community with many desirable plants.  The challenge is to select the correct animal, grazing time and grazing intensity to maximize the impact on the target plant while reducing it on the associated plant community. Finally, management objectives, target plant species, weather, topography, plant physiology, and associated plant communities are among the many variables that can determine treatment type and duration. Well-developed targeted grazing objectives and an [[adaptive management]] plan that takes into account other control strategies need to be in place.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ecology|Environment}}\n*[[Epping Forest]]\n*[[New Forest]]\n*[[Oostvaardersplassen]]\n*[[Milovice Nature Reserve]]\n*[[Holistic management (agriculture)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite news |title=Got Weeds?
