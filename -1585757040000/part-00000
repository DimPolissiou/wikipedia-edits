Mundane science fiction works explore topics such as environmental degradation, robotics, virtual reality, enhanced genomes, nanotechnology, and quantum mechanics.\n\nIt rarely involves [[interstellar travel]] or communication with alien civilization. The genre's writers believe that [[Warp drive (Star Trek)|warp drives]], the use of [[wormhole]]s, and other forms of [[faster-than-light]] travel are [[science fantasy|scientific fantasies]] rather than serious speculation about a possible future.  According to them, unfounded speculation about interstellar travel can lead to an illusion of a universe abundant with planets as hospitable to life as Earth, which encourages wasteful attitude to the abundance on Earth.<ref>{{cite web | title=Controversial SciFi Realist Tells io9 Why Warp Drives Suck | website=io9 | first=Anders | last=Charlie Jane | date=14 December 2007 | url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/334172/controversial-scifi-realist-tells-io9-why-warp-drives-suck}}</ref>\n\nScientists have not uncovered any evidence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. Although absence of evidence is not necessarily [[evidence of absence]], mundane science fiction writers believe it is unlikely that [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien intelligence]] will overcome the physical constraints on interstellar travel any better than we can. As such, mundane science fiction writers imagine a future on Earth and within the solar system and believe it is highly unlikely that intelligent life survives elsewhere in this [[solar system]]. Alternative universes, parallel worlds, magic and the supernatural (including [[telepathy]] and [[telekinesis]]), time travel and teleportation are similarly avoided in mundane science fiction.\n\n==History==\n===Precursor movements: 1950-1960s===\nChris Nakashima-Brown's article in ''The New York Review of Science Fiction'' states that \"[n]otwithstanding the scientific gloss on which science fiction seems to depend, a great deal of the genre concerns \u201cfantasies about the escape from science \u2014 the escape from the subtly nihilistic dominion of reason in the post-Enlightenment West, into a generically unbound Jungian Disneyland...\u201d.<ref> Instead of Suns, the Earth BY CHRISTOPHER COKINOS JULY 15, 2010 </ref> In the Golden Age of Science Fiction, stodgy tales of [[space opera]]\nusing \"bland prose\" and \"formulas of planetary romances, \u00fcber-robots, and cold equations\" dominated. SF writer [[Thomas Disch]] says that the preference for weak, implausible depictions of science in sci fi is an \u201cAmerican aspect of our \u201clie-loving\u201d culture\u201d used by readers for escapism. That said, some Golden Age writers such as [[Theodore Sturgeon]], [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]], and [[Ray Bradbury]] had more of a gift for transcending these formulas and developing nuanced characters and stories.<ref> Instead of Suns, the Earth BY CHRISTOPHER COKINOS JULY 15, 2010 </ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, \"Disch, Aldiss, [[Harlan Ellison]], J. G.

The authors had a profound \"skepticism about science and technology\", and there was an examination of \u201cinner space\u201d \n(Ballard), \"feminist...critiques, and ecology ([[Frank Herbert]]\u2019s ''[[Dune]]'').<ref> Instead of Suns, the Earth BY CHRISTOPHER COKINOS JULY 15, 2010 </ref> \n\nJ.G. Ballard believed that the Golden Age of Science Fiction\u2019s focus on advanced interstellar spaceships was \u201cclich\u00e9d and unilluminating\u201d, preferring to write stories about humans\u2019 \u201cnext five minutes\u201d, the \u201cnear future\u201d, which is \u201cimmediately recognisable to us, but invariably with a pretty unpleasant twist or three.\u201d <ref> As startling new drama Years and Years follows a British family over the next 15 years, Hugh Montgomery explores TV\u2019s current fascination with what lies directly ahead for our planet. Hugh Montgomery, 14 May 2019</ref>\n\n\u201cMSF stories already existed before the term was coined\u201d; as such, its \u201cnaming\u201d by Ryman \u201c\u2026only marks (and encourages) a high point in SF\u2019s social and ecological consciousness and conscience.\u201d Maddelena says that Ryman developed his idea of the MSF subgenre by examining  \u201cwhat works best\u201d in science fiction classic stories and novels. She says setting MSF in the real world may help SF writers avoid having excess \u201cexplanation and exposition\u201d, an issue that often plagues poor SF writing.\n\n===2000s===\nThe goals of MSF were predated by sociologist Wayne Brekhus  in 2000, who published \u201cA Mundane Manifesto\u201d, calling for \u201canalytically interesting studies of the socially uninteresting.\u201d He argues for a focus on the \u201cmundane\u201d because the \u201cextraordinary draws disproportionate theoretical attention from researchers\u201d, which weakens the development of theory and creates a distorted image of reality. He stated that he hoped that the humanities would also focus on the mundane.\n\nAs well, in 2001, the sci-fi website SF Futurismic: Near Future Science Fiction and Fact \n(http://futurismic.com) is against the traditional forms of SF, and instead calls for an examination of the impact of scientific discoveries on human society. Futurismic is against all \u201cfantasy, horror, and space opera, as well as offworld SF, distant futures, aliens, alternate histories, and time travel\u201d. Futurismic accepts fiction that is mundane, \u201cpost-cyberpunk sf, satirical/gonzo futurism, and realistic near future hard sf.\u201d \nMSF describes a change \u201calready in effect\u201d and claims it has \u201cideological significance\u201d.\n\n===Launch of movement===\nThe mundane science fiction movement, inspired by an idea of [[Julian Todd]], was founded in 2004 during the [[Clarion workshop]] by novelist [[Geoff Ryman]] among others.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Geoff Ryman: The Mundane Fantastic: Interview excerpts | work = [[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] | publisher = | date = January 2006 | url = http://www.locusmag.com/2006/Issues/01Ryman.html | doi = | accessdate = 2007-09-23}}</ref><ref name=bbc>{{cite news | title=How sci-fi moves with the times | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/7948058.stm | date= 18 March 2009 | newspaper=BBC News}}</ref> Ryman claims that the MSF Manifesto was \u201cjokey\u201d and that it was not intended to be a \u201cserious\u201d statement. The authors of the MSF Manifesto, apart from Ryman, are anonymous. The beliefs of the movement were later codified as the Mundane Manifesto.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://orionmagazine.org/article/instead-of-suns-the-earth1/ | title=Instead of Suns, the Earth | first=Christopher | last =Cokinos | magazine=Orion Magazine}}</ref> \nThe authors of the Manifesto stated that they are \u201cpissed off and needing a tight girdle of discipline to restrain our sf imaginative silhouettes\u201d. Ryman explained the MSF Manifesto in a speech to BOR\u00c9AL\u2019s 2007 Science Fiction convention in Montreal.\n\nWriter Kate McKinney Maddalena states that the Canadian-born and now UK-based Ryman probably intends \u201cmundane\u201d to mean \u201cof the world\u201d, rather than \u201cboring\u201d, following the British sense of the word \u201cmundane\u201d. The MSF blog was first used as a forum for debate about the new subgenre. By 2009, blog participants were existent MSF from the SF literature, and looking for newly-published MSF (\u201cmundane spotting\u201d).\n\nRyman has contrasted mundane science fiction with most science fiction through the desire of teenagers to leave their parents' homes.<ref name=\"thirdstar\">\"Take the Third Star on the Left and on til Morning\" by Geoff Ryman, ''[[New York Review of Science Fiction]]'', June 2007.</ref> Ryman sees too much of regular science fiction being based on an \"adolescent desire to run away from our world\". However, Ryman notes that humans are not truly considered grown-up until they \"create a new home of their own\", which is what mundane science fiction aims to do.<ref name=\"thirdstar\"/>\n\nMike Brotherton defines mundane science fiction as \u201cscience fiction that improbably anticipates no new discoveries or technologies and makes some narrow-minded assumptions that are unwarranted\u201d.<ref> Mike Brotherton The Difference Between Hard Science Fiction and Mundane Science Fiction, January 25th, 2008, Mike Brotherton: Hard SF Writer http://www.mikebrotherton.com/2008/01/25/the-difference-between-hard-science-fiction-and-mundane-science-fiction/ </ref>\n\n==Publications==\n===Published as subgenre===\n<!--These are 2004 and later stories/novels explicitly published and marketed as \"mundane SF\"-->\nIn 2007 the British sci fi magazine ''[[Interzone (magazine)|Interzone]]'' devoted an issue to the subgenre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ttapress.com/439/interzone-216-published-on-8th-may/ |title=Interzone 216 published on 8th May |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=3 May 2008 |publisher= TTA Press |access-date=15 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe 2009 short story collection ''When It Changed: Science Into Fiction'', edited by Ryman, is a collection of mundane science fiction stories, each written by a science fiction author with advice from a scientist, and with an endnote by that scientist explaining the plausibility of the story.<ref>''[[Material World (radio programme)|Material World]]'', [[BBC Radio 4]], 28 Oct 2009</ref>\n===Other works considered in line with subgenre===\n<!--These are pre-2004 stories/novels subsequently considered \"mundane SF\" by reliable sources-->\nA review of the 1992 novel ''[[China Mountain Zhang]]'' noted that the story's world, while different, felt ordinary and believable.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/15/books/science-fiction.html |title=Science Fiction |last=Jonas |first=Gerald |date=March 15, 1992 |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=January 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n\n==Reception==\nScience fiction writer [[Rudy Rucker]] wrote a response to the Mundane Manifesto on his blog. Rucker says he \"prefer[s] to continue searching for ways to be less and less Mundane\" in his science fiction. He points out that alternate universes are \"quite popular in modern physics\", and he says perhaps there are other worlds in other dimensions. He notes that fiction writers outside of sci fi use stories about time travel, so it is of interest to him to explore it in fiction, even though it is implausible.<ref>http://www.rudyrucker.com/blog/2007/07/15/on-mundane-sf/</ref> While Rucker is somewhat aligned with the MSF, in that he too \u201crejects the \u201cescapist\u201d tendencies of science fiction\u201d, and he calls for [[transrealism (literature)|transrealism]], an approach in which art \u201cdeal[s] with the world the way it actually is\u201d, Rucker argues that the elements of SF that MSF advocates reject (time travel, parallel universes, and so on) are \u201csymbolic of [[archetypal]] modes of perception\u201d that are needed in SF.\n\nIn Jim Kelly's ''Asimov Science Fiction'' essay in January 2008,  he wondered, \u201chow was MundaneSF all that different from what had up until then been called hard science fiction?\u201d. Niall Harrison argues that the collection of MSF stories in ''Interzone'' #216 does not devleop \u201ca convincing case for mundane sf.\u201d Linda Nagata says the term \"mundane\" has the \"implication of \"boring\"?

While he agrees that faster than light travel is improbable, he says that interstellar travel and finding Earth-like planets may be possible. Brotherton disagrees with the Manifesto\u2019s emphasis on avoiding depictions of an \u201cabundance of resources\u201d, claiming that Malthusian scenarios have not arisen. \n\nThe Mundane Manifesto has been called anthropocentric.<ref> Instead of Suns, the Earth BY CHRISTOPHER COKINOS JULY 15, 2010 </ref> The concern in MSF about wasting the abundance of Earth is influenced by the \"...moral climate that permeates North American and British nature writing\". MSF is intended \"more as compass than chimera\". <ref> Instead of Suns, the Earth BY CHRISTOPHER COKINOS JULY 15, 2010 </ref> Ian McDonald agreed with many MSF tenets on his LiveJournal blog, but he points out that a lot of existing SF qualifies as MSF; as such, he asks, what is the point of creating a new subgenre for content that already exists. James Patrick Kelly wrote about MSF in his column in ''Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction'', stating that he agrees with many of its elements.\n\nScience fiction writer Claire L. Evans called it a \u201ccontroversial recent sub-genre\u201d in 2009.<ref> Not What If: What If Not, September 6, 2009 by Claire L. Evans, TaskNewsletter.jpg http://urbanhonking.com/spacecanon/2009/09/06/not_what_if_what_if_not/</ref> and she calls the Manifesto a \u201cmuch-attacked\u201d text. She calls MSF a \u201cuseful category for an already-existing genre of science fiction (that heady triad of postapocalyptic/utopian/dystopian\u201d fiction. Evans disagrees with Ryman\u2019s use of word \u201cunlikely\u201d; she says \u201c[o]ften, it\u2019s the wildest, least likely prognostications that come to pass\u201d. As well, she says, mundane SF does not use the \u201cmassive time-scales\u201d used in regular SF, which can be \u201chumbling\u201d and \u201cperspective-shifting\u201d for readers. She says Ryman \u201cdisrespects [SF\u2019s] tradition\u201d of creating prophecies, in which SF works interact with the real world by imaging the future, thus influencing real life, which she says means he \u201ccompletely misses the point of [science fiction]\u201d.<ref> Not What If: What If Not, September 6, 2009 by Claire L. Evans, TaskNewsletter.jpg http://urbanhonking.com/spacecanon/2009/09/06/not_what_if_what_if_not/</ref>\n\nIn 2009, science fiction writer Kate McKinney Maddalena called MSF \u201ca movement, supposedly a school, and most certainly a pragmatist wake-up call. She says that Ryman has a track record of \u201ctrying to flout the conventions\u201d, \u201cmaking people walk out\u201d, and exploring feminist and postcolonial approaches. She says his MSF Manifesto uses a \u201ctone of activist indictment\u201d full of what sci-fi writer [[S.M. Stirling]] calls \u201carrogance and conceit\u201d which created a \u201cvery geeky\u2026shitstorm\u201d and a \u201cbacklash\u201d. \n\nMaddalena argues that the \u201cscience\u201d element of science fiction is generally \u201cunderstood to be speculative\u201d extrapolations. She says that futures that seem \u201cunlikely\u201d have been predicted by authors such as [[Orson Scott Card]], [[William Gibson]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]]. Maddelena acknowledges that MSF\u2019s limits help to create a taxonomy, which could benefit the SF genre, as it assists academic critical work and it may stimulate publishing, because the industry is very trend-following, always looking for the \u201cnext big thing\u201d\n\nEven if a writer creates \u201cunlikely\u201d scenarios, Maddalena argues that this is an artistic technique used to transcend Earth-based analogies; as such, she says MSF \u201csell[s] human ingenuity short\u201d. She says the \u201cwell-intentioned social conscience\u201d of MSF is not clever, as she says it uses the [[argument fallacy]] that exposure to a concept in fiction causes the fictional depiction to occur in real life.\n\nMaddalena claims the \u201cnear-futuristic landscape is more likely to resemble [[John Steinbeck]]\u2019s dustbowl [in ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' ] than any of [Neal] Stephenson\u2019s cities, material or virtual\u201d in his novel [[Snow Crash]]. She says that \u201c[s]tories that look at possible \u2014 even probable \u2014 futures might be the best way to define the \u201cnew\u201d category\u201d of MSF. As well, she says MSF has an \u201cimpetus to social conscience\u201d.\n\nSome writers called Ryman\u2019s MSF idea invalid on the grounds that there was already a category for the type of near-future writing he described: \u201cpost-apocalyptic dystopias/utopias\u201d. Other writers argued that Ryman\u2019s MSF was \u201cnot technically SF\u201d (science fiction), calling MSF an \u201cembarrassing taxonomological mistake\u201d. Maddalena says that SF connoisseurs disagreed with MSF\u2019s call to avoid \u201cunlikely\u201d technologies or futures, as these speculative futures are sci-fi writers\u2019 \u201crebellious bread and butter\u201d. \n\nRoger Luckhurst, a professor in Modern and Contemporary Literature at London\u2019s Birkbeck College, says the MSF movement was developed because writers did not want \u201c\u2026to imagine shiny, hard futures [but [rather] give a] sense of sliding from one version of our present into something slightly alienated\u201d. <ref>As startling new drama Years and Years follows a British family over the next 15 years, Hugh Montgomery explores TV\u2019s current fascination with what lies directly ahead for our planet.

Mundane science fiction works explore topics such as environmental degradation, robotics, virtual reality, enhanced genomes, nanotechnology, and quantum mechanics.\n\nIt rarely involves [[interstellar travel]] or communication with alien civilization. The genre's writers believe that [[Warp drive (Star Trek)|warp drives]], the use of [[wormhole]]s, and other forms of [[faster-than-light]] travel are [[science fantasy|scientific fantasies]] rather than serious speculation about a possible future.  According to them, unfounded speculation about interstellar travel can lead to an illusion of a universe abundant with planets as hospitable to life as Earth, which encourages wasteful attitude to the abundance on Earth.<ref>{{cite web | title=Controversial SciFi Realist Tells io9 Why Warp Drives Suck | website=io9 | first=Anders | last=Charlie Jane | date=14 December 2007 | url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/334172/controversial-scifi-realist-tells-io9-why-warp-drives-suck}}</ref>\n\nScientists have not uncovered any evidence of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. Although absence of evidence is not necessarily [[evidence of absence]], mundane science fiction writers believe it is unlikely that [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien intelligence]] will overcome the physical constraints on interstellar travel any better than we can. As such, mundane science fiction writers imagine a future on Earth and within the solar system and believe it is highly unlikely that intelligent life survives elsewhere in this [[solar system]]. Alternative universes, parallel worlds, magic and the supernatural (including [[telepathy]] and [[telekinesis]]), time travel and teleportation are similarly avoided in mundane science fiction.\n\n==History==\n===Precursor movements: 1950-1960s===\nChris Nakashima-Brown's article in ''The New York Review of Science Fiction'' states that \"[n]otwithstanding the scientific gloss on which science fiction seems to depend, a great deal of the genre concerns \u201cfantasies about the escape from science \u2014 the escape from the subtly nihilistic dominion of reason in the post-Enlightenment West, into a generically unbound Jungian Disneyland...\u201d.<ref> Instead of Suns, the Earth BY CHRISTOPHER COKINOS JULY 15, 2010 </ref> In the Golden Age of Science Fiction, stodgy tales of [[space opera]]\nusing \"bland prose\" and \"formulas of planetary romances, \u00fcber-robots, and cold equations\" dominated.

She says setting MSF in the real world may help SF writers avoid having excess \u201cexplanation and exposition\u201d, an issue that often plagues poor SF writing.\n\n===2000s===\nThe goals of MSF were predated by sociologist Wayne Brekhus  in 2000, who published \u201cA Mundane Manifesto\u201d, calling for \u201canalytically interesting studies of the socially uninteresting.\u201d He argues for a focus on the \u201cmundane\u201d because the \u201cextraordinary draws disproportionate theoretical attention from researchers\u201d, which weakens the development of theory and creates a distorted image of reality. He stated that he hoped that the humanities would also focus on the mundane.\n\nAs well, in 2001, the sci-fi website SF Futurismic: Near Future Science Fiction and Fact \n(http://futurismic.com) is against the traditional forms of SF, and instead calls for an examination of the impact of scientific discoveries on human society. Futurismic is against all \u201cfantasy, horror, and space opera, as well as offworld SF, distant futures, aliens, alternate histories, and time travel\u201d. Futurismic accepts fiction that is mundane, \u201cpost-cyberpunk sf, satirical/gonzo futurism, and realistic near future hard sf.\u201d \nMSF describes a change \u201calready in effect\u201d and claims it has \u201cideological significance\u201d.\n\n===Launch of movement===\nThe mundane science fiction movement, inspired by an idea of [[Julian Todd]], was founded in 2004 during the [[Clarion workshop]] by novelist [[Geoff Ryman]] among others.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Geoff Ryman: The Mundane Fantastic: Interview excerpts | work = [[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] | publisher = | date = January 2006 | url = http://www.locusmag.com/2006/Issues/01Ryman.html | doi = | accessdate = 2007-09-23}}</ref><ref name=bbc>{{cite news | title=How sci-fi moves with the times | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/7948058.stm | date= 18 March 2009 | newspaper=BBC News}}</ref> Ryman claims that the MSF Manifesto was \u201cjokey\u201d and that it was not intended to be a \u201cserious\u201d statement.

Ryman explained the MSF Manifesto in a speech to BOR\u00c9AL\u2019s 2007 Science Fiction convention in Montreal.\n\nWriter Kate McKinney Maddalena states that the Canadian-born and now UK-based Ryman probably intends \u201cmundane\u201d to mean \u201cof the world\u201d, rather than \u201cboring\u201d, following the British sense of the word \u201cmundane\u201d. The MSF blog was first used as a forum for debate about the new subgenre. By 2009, blog participants were existent MSF from the SF literature, and looking for newly-published MSF (\u201cmundane spotting\u201d).\n\nRyman has contrasted mundane science fiction with most science fiction through the desire of teenagers to leave their parents' homes.<ref name=\"thirdstar\">\"Take the Third Star on the Left and on til Morning\" by Geoff Ryman, ''[[New York Review of Science Fiction]]'', June 2007.</ref> Ryman sees too much of regular science fiction being based on an \"adolescent desire to run away from our world\".

Rucker says he \"prefer[s] to continue searching for ways to be less and less Mundane\" in his science fiction. He points out that alternate universes are \"quite popular in modern physics\", and he says perhaps there are other worlds in other dimensions. He notes that fiction writers outside of sci fi use stories about time travel, so it is of interest to him to explore it in fiction, even though it is implausible.<ref>http://www.rudyrucker.com/blog/2007/07/15/on-mundane-sf/</ref> While Rucker is somewhat aligned with the MSF, in that he too \u201crejects the \u201cescapist\u201d tendencies of science fiction\u201d, and he calls for [[transrealism]], an approach in which art \u201cdeal[s] with the world the way it actually is\u201d, Rucker argues that the elements of SF that MSF advocates reject (time travel, parallel universes, and so on) are \u201csymbolic of [[archetypal]] modes of perception\u201d that are needed in SF.\n\nIn Jim Kelly's ''Asimov Science Fiction'' essay in January 2008,  he wondered, \u201chow was MundaneSF all that different from what had up until then been called hard science fiction?\u201d. Niall Harrison argues that the collection of MSF stories in ''Interzone'' #216 does not devleop \u201ca convincing case for mundane sf.\u201d Linda Nagata says the term \"mundane\" has the \"implication of \"boring\"?

While he agrees that faster than light travel is improbable, he says that interstellar travel and finding Earth-like planets may be possible. Brotherton disagrees with the Manifesto\u2019s emphasis on avoiding depictions of an \u201cabundance of resources\u201d, claiming that Malthusian scenarios have not arisen. \n\nThe Mundane Manifesto has been called anthropocentric.<ref> Instead of Suns, the Earth BY CHRISTOPHER COKINOS JULY 15, 2010 </ref> The concern in MSF about wasting the abundance of Earth is influenced by the \"...moral climate that permeates North American and British nature writing\". MSF is intended \"more as compass than chimera\". <ref> Instead of Suns, the Earth BY CHRISTOPHER COKINOS JULY 15, 2010 </ref> Ian McDonald agreed with many MSF tenets on his LiveJournal blog, but he points out that a lot of existing SF qualifies as MSF; as such, he asks, what is the point of creating a new subgenre for content that already exists. James Patrick Kelly wrote about MSF in his column in ''Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction'', stating that he agrees with many of its elements.\n\nScience fiction writer Claire L. Evans called it a \u201ccontroversial recent sub-genre\u201d in 2009.<ref> Not What If: What If Not, September 6, 2009 by Claire L.

She calls MSF a \u201cuseful category for an already-existing genre of science fiction (that heady triad of postapocalyptic/utopian/dystopian\u201d fiction. Evans disagrees with Ryman\u2019s use of word \u201cunlikely\u201d; she says \u201c[o]ften, it\u2019s the wildest, least likely prognostications that come to pass\u201d. As well, she says, mundane SF does not use the \u201cmassive time-scales\u201d used in regular SF, which can be \u201chumbling\u201d and \u201cperspective-shifting\u201d for readers. She says Ryman \u201cdisrespects [SF\u2019s] tradition\u201d of creating prophecies, in which SF works interact with the real world by imaging the future, thus influencing real life, which she says means he \u201ccompletely misses the point of [science fiction]\u201d.<ref> Not What If: What If Not, September 6, 2009 by Claire L. Evans, TaskNewsletter.jpg http://urbanhonking.com/spacecanon/2009/09/06/not_what_if_what_if_not/</ref>\n\nIn 2009, science fiction writer Kate McKinney Maddalena called MSF \u201ca movement, supposedly a school, and most certainly a pragmatist wake-up call. She says that Ryman has a track record of \u201ctrying to flout the conventions\u201d, \u201cmaking people walk out\u201d, and exploring feminist and postcolonial approaches. She says his MSF Manifesto uses a \u201ctone of activist indictment\u201d full of what sci-fi writer [[S.M. Stirling]] calls \u201carrogance and conceit\u201d which created a \u201cvery geeky\u2026shitstorm\u201d and a \u201cbacklash\u201d. \n\nMaddalena argues that the \u201cscience\u201d element of science fiction is generally \u201cunderstood to be speculative\u201d extrapolations. She says that futures that seem \u201cunlikely\u201d have been predicted by authors such as [[Orson Scott Card]], [[William Gibson]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]]. Maddelena acknowledges that MSF\u2019s limits help to create a taxonomy, which could benefit the SF genre, as it assists academic critical work and it may stimulate publishing, because the industry is very trend-following, always looking for the \u201cnext big thing\u201d\n\nEven if a writer creates \u201cunlikely\u201d scenarios, Maddalena argues that this is an artistic technique used to transcend Earth-based analogies; as such, she says MSF \u201csell[s] human ingenuity short\u201d. She says the \u201cwell-intentioned social conscience\u201d of MSF is not clever, as she says it uses the [[argument fallacy]] that exposure to a concept in fiction causes the fictional depiction to occur in real life.\n\nMaddalena claims the \u201cnear-futuristic landscape is more likely to resemble [[John Steinbeck]]\u2019s dustbowl [in ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' ] than any of [Neal] Stephenson\u2019s cities, material or virtual\u201d in his novel [[Snow Crash]]. She says that \u201c[s]tories that look at possible \u2014 even probable \u2014 futures might be the best way to define the \u201cnew\u201d category\u201d of MSF. As well, she says MSF has an \u201cimpetus to social conscience\u201d.\n\nSome writers called Ryman\u2019s MSF idea invalid on the grounds that there was already a category for the type of near-future writing he described: \u201cpost-apocalyptic dystopias/utopias\u201d. Other writers argued that Ryman\u2019s MSF was \u201cnot technically SF\u201d (science fiction), calling MSF an \u201cembarrassing taxonomological mistake\u201d. Maddalena says that SF connoisseurs disagreed with MSF\u2019s call to avoid \u201cunlikely\u201d technologies or futures, as these speculative futures are sci-fi writers\u2019 \u201crebellious bread and butter\u201d. \n\nRoger Luckhurst, a professor in Modern and Contemporary Literature at London\u2019s Birkbeck College, says the MSF movement was developed because writers did not want \u201c\u2026to imagine shiny, hard futures [but [rather] give a] sense of sliding from one version of our present into something slightly alienated\u201d. <ref>As startling new drama Years and Years follows a British family over the next 15 years, Hugh Montgomery explores TV\u2019s current fascination with what lies directly ahead for our planet.

End-uses from land recycling may include: mixed-use, residential, commercial, or industrial developments; and/or [[Public space|public open space]] such as [[urban open space]] use by [[urban park]]s, [[community garden]]s; or larger [[open space reserve]]s such as [[regional park]]s.\n\nSince many abandoned and underutilized properties lie within economically distressed and disadvantaged communities, land recycling often benefits and stimulates re-investment in historically under-served areas. The real or perceived presence of [[xenobiotic]] [[hazardous substance]]s from historical previous uses or ''in situ'' [[land pollution]], causing [[soil contamination]] and [[groundwater pollution]], may complicate the redevelopment of such properties. Such environmentally distressed properties, with site cleanup and mitigation considerations, are commonly referred to as [[brownfield]]s.\n\n==Synonyms==\nOther commonly used terms can relate to or serve as synonyms of land recycling:\n\n* '''[[Infill|Infill development]]''': development that takes place within existing communities, making maximum use of the existing [[infrastructure]] instead of building on previously undeveloped land; \n* '''[[Sustainable development]]''': Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs; and\n* '''[[Brownfield land|Brownfield development]]''': development of [[real property]] for which its reuse may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a [[dangerous goods|hazardous substance]], pollutant or contaminant.\n\n== Types of Land Recycling ==\n<br />\n\n=== Building Reuse ===\nThe most common form of land recycling is the redevelopment of abandoned or unused building properties. This involves\n\n=== Brownfields ===\nThe EPA classifies a brownfield as \"A brownfield is a property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.\" Currently in the United States there are more than 450,000 brownfields.\n\n=== Non-Infrastructure ===\nLand Recycling can also include those spaces that are not within urbanized environments are involve a building. Agricultural reuse is a very important part of Land reuse where an existing field might have been abandoned due to nutrient depletion, and can be developed into something else. In addition to this the redevelopment of underutilized land into parks, community gardens and open space reservoirs are also prominent.\n\n==Benefits==\n\nThe US Government [[Accountability Office]] estimates that there are over 450,000 brownfields and almost {{convert|15|e6acre|km2}} of potentially contaminated properties across the United States.<ref>Brownfield Redevelopment: Stakeholders Report That EPA's Program Helps to Redevelop Sites, but Additional Measures Could Complement Agency Efforts\nGAO-05-94; December 2, 2004</ref> These sites sit idle and neglected, serving as desolate eyesores within their communities. By putting these barren infill sites to use, land recycling revitalizes communities, promotes [[sustainable development]], and preserves precious [[land resource|resources]]. The social, economic, environmental, and other benefits of land recycling include:\n\n* Social and economic [[revitalization]]\n* Sustainability\n* An alternative to [[urban sprawl|sprawl]]\n* Direction of [[economic development|development]] to urban cores\n* Addressing [[climate change]]{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===Social and economic revitalization===\n\nLand recycling helps clean up and revitalize inner cities by returning abandoned, idle, or underused sites to productive use, bolstering [[community spirit]], creating jobs and boosting local tax-revenues.\n\nThe re-use of land revitalizes communities and renews economic activity, particularly in under-served urban areas. Abandoned, idled, and vacant properties often lie in former industrial and commercial areas, typically in urban and historically disadvantaged areas. These sites can be community eyesores, negatively impacting social and economic development, and often human and [[environmental health]]. The failure to redevelop brownfields in particular translates into potentially more exposure to toxics and the loss of economic and housing benefits that can come from appropriate redevelopment.\n\nBy putting these properties to new and productive use, land recycling encourages growth of [[business]]es and services in such areas, helping to break up concentrations of [[poverty]], creating jobs, and stimulating additional private investment and local tax-revenue. An abandoned, well-situated, factory site can be cleaned up and redeveloped into a much-needed mixed-use development with a grocery store, senior housing, and access to public transportation. The addition of neighborhood-serving retail, affordable housing, or a clean public park in a disadvantaged community can boost local spirit and improve overall quality of life.\n\n===Sustainability===\n[[Sustainability]] involves meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n\nLand recycling expresses an inherently sustainable idea, based on the same common-sense as recycling an aluminum can. Like other natural resources, land represents a shared investment that should be reused and recycled, rather than [[land consumption|consumed]] and abandoned after use. [[Recycling paper]] saves trees, reusing land saves land.\n\nBy encouraging the recycling rather than the consumption of land, land recycling promotes [[smart growth]] and responsible, sustainable patterns of development. A 2001 study by George Washington University shows that for every acre of brownfield redeveloped, {{convert|4.5|acre|m2}} of undeveloped land is conserved.\n[http://www.gwu.edu/~eem/Brownfields/project_report/chapters-html.htm#chapter5 Public Policies and Private Decisions Affecting the Redevelopment of Brownfields: An Analysis of Critical Factors, Relative Weights and Areal Differentials]. As most brownfields and other abandoned sites are typically situated in urban areas, they tap into existing nearby infrastructure, limiting the need to build new roads, gridlines, and amenities, thereby reducing further land consumption. Each infill development prevents sprawl into open space, forests and agricultural land, preserving acres of undeveloped land.\n\n===An alternative to sprawl===\nLand recycling increases density in urban areas, by reducing [[urban sprawl]] and unplanned, low-density, [[automobile]]-dependent developments.\n\nSprawl development scatters housing, public transit, jobs and other amenities farther apart, demanding more frequent use of cars for travel. The increase in vehicle-miles traveled (VMTs) produces a range of health and environmental problems, including air pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions, and increased incidence of traffic jams and asthma. This results in a lower quality of life for residents, ever-increasing commute times, and the health implications of smog.\n\nBy moving new jobs, economic opportunities and community amenities farther from established populations, sprawl development can cripple once-thriving cities. This trend takes a toll on the socio-economic health of urban communities as growth retreats from the urban center.\n\nRather than take advantage of existing infrastructure such as roads, public transit, and public works, building sprawl projects abandons these resources and demands further consumption of land and resources.\n\nLand recycling offers an intelligent alternative to sprawl development. It reuses vital infrastructure and public resources and creates compact, full-service neighborhoods that reduce [[vehicle use]] and [[carbon dependence]]. Rebuilding in urban neighborhoods generates reinvestment in vibrant economic and cultural centers, rather than drawing away much-needed resources. Compact, urban development through land recycling is essential to sustainable development and is key to managing rapid population growth across the United States and beyond. As daily commute times decrease, the general quality of life improves as residents have more time to enjoy the world around them.\n\n===Directing development to urban cores===\nRedirecting population growth and growth of businesses to already urbanized areas is integral to fostering sustainable communities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Applying sustainable principles to land use and growth management requires that growth be redirected from scattered fringe areas back to our urban cores, where people, services and infrastructure already exist. Building up our urban areas positively increases population density, providing the critical mass to support local services from coffee shops to grocery stores, public transit to libraries and symphony halls. Land recycling provides opportunities for urban renewal and to build truly livable communities: efficient, compact, vibrant urban neighborhoods integrated with public transit systems, which offer a mix of uses as well as affordable housing.\n\n===Addressing climate change===\nLand recycling effectively curbs [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse-gas]] emissions by encouraging smart, compact growth that reduces [[vehicle dependence]]. Redevelopment within an urban core reduces commuting distances and therefore average vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by creating residential, office, and other amenities within close proximity. Since transportation alone accounts for a third of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted in the United States, land recycling offers a key tool in any fight against climate change.  A recent Urban Land Institute study found that compact urban developments reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by 20 to 40 percent <ref>Urban Land Institute.  Growing Cooler: The Evidence of Urban Development and Climate Change.  Available at  {{cite web|url=http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224212241/http://smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |archivedate=2010-12-24 }}</ref> because users are closer to amenities and can more easily rely on public transportation. Smart urban planning is therefore crucial to maximizing energy savings and overall reduction of greenhouse gases.\n\n=== '''Leaders in Energy and Environmental Design Certification''' ===\n{{As of | 2009}} the green movement has started to emphasize the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) Green Building Rating System, a certification system that rewards the design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings. LEED certification signifies incorporation of smart building design and technology to reduce energy use and minimize waste. However, even if a building is energy-efficient, the energy required to travel to and from a LEED certified site may well exceed the energy saved through energy-efficient features. LEED certified buildings and other developments best benefit climate change when they reuse infill sites and access existing resources.\n\nLEED Certification can also benefit the occupant of the reused building. As sustainability becomes more prioritized within the building movement, having a LEED certified building becomes more desirable This certification may persuade public opinion and encourage more of the population to seek services by a company that prioritizes sustainability. In addition to this, some governmental bodies provide monetary benefits for prioritizing a sustainable cite such as tax breaks and stipends. \n\n==Challenges==\nWhile land recycling has great economic and environmental benefits, without the right tools, skills, and knowledge, reusing land can produce certain challenges.  Obstacles to redevelopment may include lack of funding and increased scrutiny. These can particularly impede projects on brownfields, which carry the stigma of contamination. Because of these concerns, the perceived ease of developing on open land, or [[greenfield land|greenfields]], remains alluring to many. Factors that hinder land recycling include:\n\n* market factors\n* environmental-liability risks\n* uncertainty and cost\n* complicated/confusing regulatory requirements\n* difficulty in obtaining project financing\n* the lure of greenfields\n\n===Market factors===\nAs the saying goes, in [[real estate]] only three things matter: location, location, location. Because idled and underused infill sites are often located in distressed urban areas concerns arise about crime, safety, and access to quality education and services. These and other market factors frequently pull development to open land near traditionally desirable communities and away from urban infill sites.\n\n====Greenfields competition====\nBrownfields and infill sites must compete with attractive, undeveloped suburban and rural land, also called [[greenfield land]]. When considering the real or perceived risks and costs of land recycling, a greenfield development may seem more economically sensible as the immediate costs are typically less than developing on an infill or brownfield site. However, it is important to consider the long-term economic gain of land recycling and the added social and environmental rewards of sustainable development.\n\n===Brownfields===\nAs defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency, a [[brownfield]] site is \u201creal property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant\u201d. In other words, brownfield sites comprise abandoned, idled, or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.\n\n====Uncertainty and costs====\nAssessing whether or not a site is contaminated can be a costly process that deters land reuse. Potential purchasers are often unwilling or unable to risk an investment in a site assessment for a property that may require cleanup they cannot afford. Even if a site has been purchased, concerns over cleanup costs may further stall redevelopment. Uncertainty over time, cost or a high price for cleanup leaves many brownfield sites in development limbo.\n\n====Project financing====\nObtaining private front-end financing for brownfield cleanup can be a difficult process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wolf|first=Michael Allan|date=1997-1998|title=Dangerous Crossing: State Brownfields Recycling and Federal Enterprise Zoning|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/frdmev9&id=503&div=&collection=|journal=Fordham Environmental Law Journal|volume=9|pages=495}}</ref> Since financing is more readably available for development on greenfields, infill and brownfield sites are often passed over.\n\n==== '''Environmental Justice''' ====\nThe concern for contamination of new occupants of a redeveloped brownfield is a concern. Communities of color and low income are disproportionately affected by pollution and brownfield sites offer a higher risk to the communities surrounding them. Many suggest that brownfield programs are a good alternative to the Superfund Act, but the standards of cleanup need to be highly considered in order to avoid future contamination. \n\n===Environmental-liability risks===\nAlthough recent changes in some country's federal laws provide some liability relief to new purchasers of contaminated properties, the law remains very complex and many state laws still have strict liability covering real property. Thus, in many cases, any current or past property owner can potentially be legally and financially liable regardless of who is responsible for contamination. This liability web continues to throw a chill on many brownfield projects even in the presence of regulatory reforms designed to encourage redevelopment. A common belief among many brownfield owners is that it is less risky and cheaper to abandon or \u201cmothball\u201d a facility than to conduct a site assessment that could trigger large cleanup costs and potential liability.\n\n====Regulatory requirements====\nThe potentially complex process of successfully redeveloping an infill site, particularly a brownfield, can challenge land recycling interest and proposals.  Understanding and complying with federal, state, and local legal and regulatory requirements can be daunting for some property owners and developers. Guidance from legal specialists and environmental cleanup consultants is often needed to design, develop, and guide a project through the process of regulatory requirements and permitting approvals.\n\n=== Gentrification ===\nBecause most communities with underutilized buildings are those in poverty, an existing company coming in and investing in reimagining it can raise a concern of gentrification. The new building can lead to wealthier people coming in and causing displacement of existing residents. Depending on the building occupancy, such as a new apartment complex charging a higher rent, this can drive for higher priced services to come in and eventually push out existing residents who can no longer afford to live in the area.\n\n== Global Land Recycling ==\n\n=== Developed Countries  ===\n\n==== Land Recycling in the EU ====\nAn in-depth examination of land recycling in different countries shows many different perspectives on implementations of land recycling.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trefzer|first=Annette|last2=Jackson|first2=Jeffrey T.|last3=McKee|first3=Kathryn|last4=Dellinger|first4=Kirsten|date=2014|title=Introduction: The Global South and/in the Global North: Interdisciplinary Investigations|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585671|journal=The Global South|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=1\u201315|issn=1932-8656}}</ref> The general European focus looked at land use in the EU and the importance of reducing new land use as well as reducing addition of impervious surface which disrupts natural ecosystems.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/land-recycling-in-europe|title=Land recycling in Europe|website=European Environment Agency|language=en|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> Beginning with research, a main database called Copernicus is used in the EU to monitor land use changes, its main components are Corine Land Cover (CLC) and Urban Atlas (UA).<ref name=\":0\" /> Each of these has its own indicators for measuring increasing land use and increasing urbanization, for Corine Land Cover the flows of land recycling are split based on previously developed and undeveloped land because they each have different potential to produce green urban infrastructure.<ref name=\":0\" /> For the Urban Atlas database, the focus is the same but more geographically and theme specific accuracy so it used to test more of the land recycling indicators.<ref name=\":0\" /> The indicators were tested in all the countries in Europe from 1990-2002 in three sections, the tests were used to compare projections and determine the meaningfulness of land recycling using data from the CLC and UA datasets.<ref name=\":0\" /> The results of the data analysis showed little to no trends in land recycling and more variation in between the different European countries.<ref name=\":0\" /> The approach of the EU then focused more on the large scale environmental impacts of land recycling by quantification and identification of places where land use could be improved.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Land Development in Germany ====\nOn a smaller scale, Germany focused on limiting the amount of land conversion specifically for settling and traffic to 30ha per day starting in 2002 as a part of the National Sustainability Strategy.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Dillmann|first=Oliver|last2=Beckmann|first2=Volker|date=2018-12-12|title=Do Administrative Incentives for the Containment of Cities Work?

This program was established in 1995 and is also known as the Voluntary Cleanup Program. This program aims to set four main standards, the first is to set structured standards. This allows for public knowledge of the cost of cleaning up a site, and ensures the protection of the present and future use of the site. The second standard is granted liability relief. The third standard promotes transparency by giving specific time frames for clean ups and routine reporting of what is being done on the site. Lastly, the fourth standard for this land recycling program is providing financial assistance for cleanups. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dep.pa.gov:443/Business/Land/LandRecycling/Pages/default.aspx|title=Land Recycling Program|website=Department of Environmental Protection|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bioremediation]]\n*[[Green development]]\n*[[Land banking]]\n*[[New Urbanism]]\n*[[Sustainable design]]\n*[[Sustainable development]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.cclr.org Center for Creative Land Recycling]\n* {{cite book\n|editor-last=Fleming\n|editor-first=George\n|title= Recycling derelict land\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IEKC60pckAQC\n|accessdate= 2009-11-08\n|year= 1991\n|publisher= Thomas Telford\n|isbn= 978-0-7277-1318-6\n}}\n\n{{recycling|state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Land use]]\n[[Category:Sustainable development]]\n[[Category:Sustainable urban planning]]\n[[Category:New Urbanism]]\n[[Category:Urban studies and planning terminology]]\n[[Category:Environmental issues with soil]]\n[[Category:Redevelopment]]\n[[Category:Recycling]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2009}}\n{{tone|date=November 2009}}\n{{cleanup|date=November 2009}}\n}}\n\n'''Land recycling''' is the reuse of abandoned, vacant, or underused properties for [[redevelopment]] or repurposing.\n\nLand recycling aims to ensure the reuse of [[developed land]] as part of: new developments; [[decontamination|cleaning up]] contaminated properties; reuse and/or making use of used land surrounded by development or nearby infrastructure.

This involves\n\n=== Brownfields ===\nThe EPA classifies a brownfield as \"A brownfield is a property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.\" Currently in the United States there are more than 450,000 brownfields.\n\n=== Non-Infrastructure ===\nLand Recycling can also include those spaces that are not within urbanized environments are involve a building. Agricultural reuse is a very important part of Land reuse where an existing field might have been abandoned due to nutrient depletion, and can be developed into something else. In addition to this the redevelopment of underutilized land into parks, community gardens and open space reservoirs are also prominent.\n\n==Benefits==\n\nThe US Government [[Accountability Office]] estimates that there are over 450,000 brownfields and almost {{convert|15|e6acre|km2}} of potentially contaminated properties across the United States.<ref>Brownfield Redevelopment: Stakeholders Report That EPA's Program Helps to Redevelop Sites, but Additional Measures Could Complement Agency Efforts\nGAO-05-94; December 2, 2004</ref> These sites sit idle and neglected, serving as desolate eyesores within their communities. By putting these barren infill sites to use, land recycling revitalizes communities, promotes [[sustainable development]], and preserves precious [[land resource|resources]]. The social, economic, environmental, and other benefits of land recycling include:\n\n* Social and economic [[revitalization]]\n* Sustainability\n* An alternative to [[urban sprawl|sprawl]]\n* Direction of [[economic development|development]] to urban cores\n* Addressing [[climate change]]{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===Social and economic revitalization===\n\nLand recycling helps clean up and revitalize inner cities by returning abandoned, idle, or underused sites to productive use, bolstering [[community spirit]], creating jobs and boosting local tax-revenues.\n\nThe re-use of land revitalizes communities and renews economic activity, particularly in under-served urban areas. Abandoned, idled, and vacant properties often lie in former industrial and commercial areas, typically in urban and historically disadvantaged areas. These sites can be community eyesores, negatively impacting social and economic development, and often human and [[environmental health]]. The failure to redevelop brownfields in particular translates into potentially more exposure to toxics and the loss of economic and housing benefits that can come from appropriate redevelopment.\n\nBy putting these properties to new and productive use, land recycling encourages growth of [[business]]es and services in such areas, helping to break up concentrations of [[poverty]], creating jobs, and stimulating additional private investment and local tax-revenue. An abandoned, well-situated, factory site can be cleaned up and redeveloped into a much-needed mixed-use development with a grocery store, senior housing, and access to public transportation. The addition of neighborhood-serving retail, affordable housing, or a clean public park in a disadvantaged community can boost local spirit and improve overall quality of life.\n\n===Sustainability===\n[[Sustainability]] involves meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\n\nLand recycling expresses an inherently sustainable idea, based on the same common-sense as recycling an aluminum can. Like other natural resources, land represents a shared investment that should be reused and recycled, rather than [[land consumption|consumed]] and abandoned after use. [[Recycling paper]] saves trees, reusing land saves land.\n\nBy encouraging the recycling rather than the consumption of land, land recycling promotes [[smart growth]] and responsible, sustainable patterns of development. A 2001 study by George Washington University shows that for every acre of brownfield redeveloped, {{convert|4.5|acre|m2}} of undeveloped land is conserved.\n[http://www.gwu.edu/~eem/Brownfields/project_report/chapters-html.htm#chapter5 Public Policies and Private Decisions Affecting the Redevelopment of Brownfields: An Analysis of Critical Factors, Relative Weights and Areal Differentials]. As most brownfields and other abandoned sites are typically situated in urban areas, they tap into existing nearby infrastructure, limiting the need to build new roads, gridlines, and amenities, thereby reducing further land consumption. Each infill development prevents sprawl into open space, forests and agricultural land, preserving acres of undeveloped land.\n\n===An alternative to sprawl===\nLand recycling increases density in urban areas, by reducing [[urban sprawl]] and unplanned, low-density, [[automobile]]-dependent developments.\n\nSprawl development scatters housing, public transit, jobs and other amenities farther apart, demanding more frequent use of cars for travel. The increase in vehicle-miles traveled (VMTs) produces a range of health and environmental problems, including air pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions, and increased incidence of traffic jams and asthma. This results in a lower quality of life for residents, ever-increasing commute times, and the health implications of smog.\n\nBy moving new jobs, economic opportunities and community amenities farther from established populations, sprawl development can cripple once-thriving cities. This trend takes a toll on the socio-economic health of urban communities as growth retreats from the urban center.\n\nRather than take advantage of existing infrastructure such as roads, public transit, and public works, building sprawl projects abandons these resources and demands further consumption of land and resources.\n\nLand recycling offers an intelligent alternative to sprawl development. It reuses vital infrastructure and public resources and creates compact, full-service neighborhoods that reduce [[vehicle use]] and [[carbon dependence]]. Rebuilding in urban neighborhoods generates reinvestment in vibrant economic and cultural centers, rather than drawing away much-needed resources. Compact, urban development through land recycling is essential to sustainable development and is key to managing rapid population growth across the United States and beyond. As daily commute times decrease, the general quality of life improves as residents have more time to enjoy the world around them.\n\n===Directing development to urban cores===\nRedirecting population growth and growth of businesses to already urbanized areas is integral to fostering sustainable communities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Applying sustainable principles to land use and growth management requires that growth be redirected from scattered fringe areas back to our urban cores, where people, services and infrastructure already exist. Building up our urban areas positively increases population density, providing the critical mass to support local services from coffee shops to grocery stores, public transit to libraries and symphony halls. Land recycling provides opportunities for urban renewal and to build truly livable communities: efficient, compact, vibrant urban neighborhoods integrated with public transit systems, which offer a mix of uses as well as affordable housing.\n\n===Addressing climate change===\nLand recycling effectively curbs [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse-gas]] emissions by encouraging smart, compact growth that reduces [[vehicle dependence]]. Redevelopment within an urban core reduces commuting distances and therefore average vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by creating residential, office, and other amenities within close proximity. Since transportation alone accounts for a third of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted in the United States, land recycling offers a key tool in any fight against climate change.  A recent Urban Land Institute study found that compact urban developments reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by 20 to 40 percent <ref>Urban Land Institute.  Growing Cooler: The Evidence of Urban Development and Climate Change.  Available at  {{cite web|url=http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224212241/http://smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |archivedate=2010-12-24 }}</ref> because users are closer to amenities and can more easily rely on public transportation. Smart urban planning is therefore crucial to maximizing energy savings and overall reduction of greenhouse gases.\n\n=== '''Leaders in Energy and Environmental Design Certification''' ===\n{{As of | 2009}} the green movement has started to emphasize the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) Green Building Rating System, a certification system that rewards the design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings. LEED certification signifies incorporation of smart building design and technology to reduce energy use and minimize waste. However, even if a building is energy-efficient, the energy required to travel to and from a LEED certified site may well exceed the energy saved through energy-efficient features. LEED certified buildings and other developments best benefit climate change when they reuse infill sites and access existing resources.\n\nLEED Certification can also benefit the occupant of the reused building. As sustainability becomes more prioritized within the building movement, having a LEED certified building becomes more desirable This certification may persuade public opinion and encourage more of the population to seek services by a company that prioritizes sustainability. In addition to this, some governmental bodies provide monetary benefits for prioritizing a sustainable cite such as tax breaks and stipends. \n\n==Challenges==\nWhile land recycling has great economic and environmental benefits, without the right tools, skills, and knowledge, reusing land can produce certain challenges.  Obstacles to redevelopment may include lack of funding and increased scrutiny. These can particularly impede projects on brownfields, which carry the stigma of contamination. Because of these concerns, the perceived ease of developing on open land, or [[greenfield land|greenfields]], remains alluring to many. Factors that hinder land recycling include:\n\n* market factors\n* environmental-liability risks\n* uncertainty and cost\n* complicated/confusing regulatory requirements\n* difficulty in obtaining project financing\n* the lure of greenfields\n\n===Market factors===\nAs the saying goes, in [[real estate]] only three things matter: location, location, location. Because idled and underused infill sites are often located in distressed urban areas concerns arise about crime, safety, and access to quality education and services. These and other market factors frequently pull development to open land near traditionally desirable communities and away from urban infill sites.\n\n====Greenfields competition====\nBrownfields and infill sites must compete with attractive, undeveloped suburban and rural land, also called [[greenfield land]]. When considering the real or perceived risks and costs of land recycling, a greenfield development may seem more economically sensible as the immediate costs are typically less than developing on an infill or brownfield site. However, it is important to consider the long-term economic gain of land recycling and the added social and environmental rewards of sustainable development.\n\n===Brownfields===\nAs defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency, a [[brownfield]] site is \u201creal property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant\u201d. In other words, brownfield sites comprise abandoned, idled, or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.\n\n====Uncertainty and costs====\nAssessing whether or not a site is contaminated can be a costly process that deters land reuse. Potential purchasers are often unwilling or unable to risk an investment in a site assessment for a property that may require cleanup they cannot afford. Even if a site has been purchased, concerns over cleanup costs may further stall redevelopment. Uncertainty over time, cost or a high price for cleanup leaves many brownfield sites in development limbo.\n\n====Project financing====\nObtaining private front-end financing for brownfield cleanup can be a difficult process.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wolf|first=Michael Allan|date=1997-1998|title=Dangerous Crossing: State Brownfields Recycling and Federal Enterprise Zoning|url=https://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/frdmev9&id=503&div=&collection=|journal=Fordham Environmental Law Journal|volume=9|pages=495}}</ref> Since financing is more readably available for development on greenfields, infill and brownfield sites are often passed over.\n\n'''Environmental Justice'''\n\nThe concern for contamination of new occupants of a redeveloped brownfield is a concern. Communities of color and low income are disproportionately affected by pollution and brownfield sites offer a higher risk to the communities surrounding them. Many suggest that brownfield programs are a good alternative to the Superfund Act, but the standards of cleanup need to be highly considered in order to avoid future contamination. \n\n===Environmental-liability risks===\nAlthough recent changes in some country's federal laws provide some liability relief to new purchasers of contaminated properties, the law remains very complex and many state laws still have strict liability covering real property. Thus, in many cases, any current or past property owner can potentially be legally and financially liable regardless of who is responsible for contamination. This liability web continues to throw a chill on many brownfield projects even in the presence of regulatory reforms designed to encourage redevelopment. A common belief among many brownfield owners is that it is less risky and cheaper to abandon or \u201cmothball\u201d a facility than to conduct a site assessment that could trigger large cleanup costs and potential liability.\n\n====Regulatory requirements====\nThe potentially complex process of successfully redeveloping an infill site, particularly a brownfield, can challenge land recycling interest and proposals.  Understanding and complying with federal, state, and local legal and regulatory requirements can be daunting for some property owners and developers. Guidance from legal specialists and environmental cleanup consultants is often needed to design, develop, and guide a project through the process of regulatory requirements and permitting approvals.\n\n=== Gentrification ===\nBecause most communities with underutilized buildings are those in poverty, an existing company coming in and investing in reimagining it can raise a concern of gentrification. The new building can lead to wealthier people coming in and causing displacement of existing residents. Depending on the building occupancy, such as a new apartment complex charging a higher rent, this can drive for higher priced services to come in and eventually push out existing residents who can no longer afford to live in the area.\n\n== Global Land Recycling ==\n\n=== Developed Countries  ===\n\n==== Land Recycling in the EU ====\nAn in-depth examination of land recycling in different countries shows many different perspectives on implementations of land recycling.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trefzer|first=Annette|last2=Jackson|first2=Jeffrey T.|last3=McKee|first3=Kathryn|last4=Dellinger|first4=Kirsten|date=2014|title=Introduction: The Global South and/in the Global North: Interdisciplinary Investigations|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/585671|journal=The Global South|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=1\u201315|issn=1932-8656}}</ref> The general European focus looked at land use in the EU and the importance of reducing new land use as well as reducing addition of impervious surface which disrupts natural ecosystems.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/land-recycling-in-europe|title=Land recycling in Europe|website=European Environment Agency|language=en|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> Beginning with research, a main database called Copernicus is used in the EU to monitor land use changes, its main components are Corine Land Cover (CLC) and Urban Atlas (UA).<ref name=\":0\" /> Each of these has its own indicators for measuring increasing land use and increasing urbanization, for Corine Land Cover the flows of land recycling are split based on previously developed and undeveloped land because they each have different potential to produce green urban infrastructure.<ref name=\":0\" /> For the Urban Atlas database, the focus is the same but more geographically and theme specific accuracy so it used to test more of the land recycling indicators.<ref name=\":0\" /> The indicators were tested in all the countries in Europe from 1990-2002 in three sections, the tests were used to compare projections and determine the meaningfulness of land recycling using data from the CLC and UA datasets.<ref name=\":0\" /> The results of the data analysis showed little to no trends in land recycling and more variation in between the different European countries.<ref name=\":0\" /> The approach of the EU then focused more on the large scale environmental impacts of land recycling by quantification and identification of places where land use could be improved.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Land Development in Germany ====\nOn a smaller scale, Germany focused on limiting the amount of land conversion specifically for settling and traffic to 30ha per day starting in 2002 as a part of the National Sustainability Strategy.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Dillmann|first=Oliver|last2=Beckmann|first2=Volker|date=2018-12-12|title=Do Administrative Incentives for the Containment of Cities Work?

This allows for public knowledge of the cost of cleaning up a site, and ensures the protection of the present and future use of the site. The second standard is granted liability relief. The third standard promotes transparency by giving specific time frames for clean ups and routine reporting of what is being done on the site. Lastly, the fourth standard for this land recycling program is providing financial assistance for cleanups. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dep.pa.gov:443/Business/Land/LandRecycling/Pages/default.aspx|title=Land Recycling Program|website=Department of Environmental Protection|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bioremediation]]\n*[[Green development]]\n*[[Land banking]]\n*[[New Urbanism]]\n*[[Sustainable design]]\n*[[Sustainable development]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.cclr.org Center for Creative Land Recycling]\n* {{cite book\n|editor-last=Fleming\n|editor-first=George\n|title= Recycling derelict land\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IEKC60pckAQC\n|accessdate= 2009-11-08\n|year= 1991\n|publisher= Thomas Telford\n|isbn= 978-0-7277-1318-6\n}}\n\n{{recycling|state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Land use]]\n[[Category:Sustainable development]]\n[[Category:Sustainable urban planning]]\n[[Category:New Urbanism]]\n[[Category:Urban studies and planning terminology]]\n[[Category:Environmental issues with soil]]\n[[Category:Redevelopment]]\n[[Category:Recycling]]\n", "name_user": "Milleanr", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_recycling"}
{"title_page": "Drone (bee)", "text_new": "[[File:Drone_bee_(32-image_macro_stack).jpg|thumb|Drone [[bee]]]]\nA '''drone''' is a male honey [[bee]]. Unlike the female [[worker bee]], drones do not have stingers and gather neither nectar nor pollen. A drone's primary role is to mate with an unfertilized queen.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Haplodiploid Sex Determination in Honey Bees.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Drones are [[haploid]], growing from unfertilised eggs by [[arrhenotoky]].]]\n\nDrones carry only one type of [[allele]] at each chromosomal position, because they are [[haploid]] (containing only one set of [[chromosomes]] from the mother). During the development of eggs within a [[Queen bee|queen]], a diploid cell with 32 chromosomes divides to generate haploid cells called [[gametes]] with 16 chromosomes. The result is a haploid egg, with chromosomes having a new combination of alleles at the various [[Locus (genetics)|loci]]. This process is called arrhenotokous parthenogenesis or simply [[arrhenotoky]].\n\nBecause the male bee technically has only a mother, and no father, its genealogical tree is unusual. The first generation has one member (the male). One generation back also has one member (the mother). Two generations back are two members (the mother and father of the mother). Three generations back are three members. Four back are five members. That is, the numbers in each generation going back are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... \u2013 the [[Fibonacci sequence]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Nickel |first=J. |year=2001 |edition=Revised |title=Mathematics: Is God Silent? |page=242 |location=Vallecito, CA |publisher=Ross House Books |isbn=1-879998-22-X}}</ref>\n\nMuch debate and controversy exist in the scientific literature about the dynamics and apparent benefit of the combined forms of reproduction in honey bees and other social insects, known as the [[Haplodiploidy|haplodiploid]] [[sex-determination system]]. The drones have two reproductive functions: Each drone grows from the queen's unfertilized haploid egg and produces some 10 million male [[Spermatozoon|sperm cells]], each genetically identical to the egg. Drones also serve as a vehicle to mate with a new queen to fertilize her eggs. Female [[worker bee]]s develop from fertilized eggs and are [[diploid]] in origin, which means that the sperm from a father provides a second set of 16 chromosomes for a total of 32: one set from each parent. Since all the sperm cells produced by a particular drone are genetically identical, full sisters are more closely related than full sisters of other animals where the sperm is not genetically identical.\n\nA [[laying worker bee]] exclusively produces totally unfertilized eggs, which develop into drones. As an exception to this rule, laying worker bees in some subspecies of honey bees may also produce diploid (and therefore female) fertile offspring in a process called [[thelytoky]], in which the second set of chromosomes comes not from sperm, but from one of the three [[Polar body|polar bodies]] during [[anaphase II]] of [[meiosis]].\n\nIn honey bees, the genetics of offspring can best be controlled by artificially inseminating (referred to in beekeeping as 'instrumental insemination') a queen with drones collected from a single hive, where the drones' mother is known. In the natural mating process, a queen mates with multiple drones,<ref>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118734</ref> which may not come from the same hive. Therefore, batches of female offspring have fathers of a completely different genetic origin.\n\n==Anatomy==\nA drone is characterized by eyes that are twice the size of those of worker bees and queens, and a body size greater than that of worker bees, though usually smaller than the [[queen bee]]. His abdomen is stouter than the abdomen of workers or queen. Although heavy bodied, the drone must be able to fly fast enough to accompany the queen in flight. The average flight time for a drone is about 20 minutes.\n\nAn ''[[Apis cerana]]'' colony has about 200 drones during high summer peak time.\nDrones depend on worker bees to feed them.\n\nDrones die off or are ejected from the hive by the worker bees in late autumn, and do not reappear in the bee hive until late spring. They would deplete the hive's resources too quickly if they were allowed to stay.\n\n==Role==\nThe drones' main function is to be ready to fertilize a receptive queen. Drones in a hive do not usually mate with a [[Virgin queen bee|virgin queen]] of the same hive because the queen flies further to a drone congregation area than the drones do. Mating generally takes place in or near drone congregation areas. How these areas are selected is poorly understood, but they do exist. When a drone mates with a queen of the same hive, the resultant queen will have a spotty brood pattern (numerous empty cells on a brood frame) due to the removal of diploid drone larvae by nurse bees (i.e., a fertilized egg with two identical sex genes will develop into a drone instead of a worker). The worker bees remove the inbred brood and consume it to recycle the protein.\n\n[[File:Drohn im Flug 08-3.jpg|thumb|In flight]]\n\nMating occurs in flight, which accounts for drones needing better vision, which is provided by their large eyes. Should a drone succeed in mating, the first thing that happens is all of the drone's blood in his body rushes to his endophallus which causes him to lose control over his entire body. His body falls away, leaving a portion of his endophallus attached to the queen which helps guide the next drone in the queen.\n\nHoney bee queen breeders may breed drones to be used for instrumental insemination <ref>https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/CAT87209055/PDF</ref> or open mating. A queen [[mating yard]] must have many drones to be successful.\n\nIn areas with severe winters, all drones are driven out of the hive in the autumn. A colony begins to rear drones in spring and drone population reaches its peak coinciding with the [[Swarming (honey bee)|swarm]] season in late spring and early summer. The life expectancy of a drone is about 90 days.\n\nAlthough the drone is highly specialized to perform one function, mating and continuing the propagation of the hive, it is not completely without side benefit to it. All bees, when they sense the hive's temperature deviating from proper limits, either generate heat by shivering, or exhaust heat by moving air with their wings\u2014behaviours which drones share with worker bees.\n\n==Behavior==\nDrones do not exhibit typical worker bee behaviours such as nectar and pollen gathering, nursing, or hive construction. While drones are unable to sting, if picked up, they may swing their tails in an attempt to frighten the disturber.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Reuber |first1=Brant |title=21st Century Homestead: Beekeeping |date=February 2015 |publisher=LuLu.com |isbn=9781312937338 |page=80 }}</ref>  In some species, drones buzz around intruders in an attempt to disorient them if the nest is disturbed.\n\nDrones fly in abundance in the early afternoon and are known to congregate in drone congregation areas a good distance away from the hive.\n\n==Mating and the drone reproductive organ==\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | footer = \n | image1 = Drone honey bee reproductive organ- cornua.JPG\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = The everted endophallus, with the cornua in focus, resembling hooks.\n | image2 = Drone honey bee reproductive organ- penis bulb.JPG\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 = The extended bulbus of the endophallus, containing sperm, is in focus.\n }}\n\nThe drone endophallus is designed to disperse a large quantity of seminal fluid and spermatozoa with great speed and force.  The endophallus is held internally in the drone.  During mating, the organ is everted (turned inside out), into the queen. The eversion of the endophallus is achieved by contracting abdominal muscles, which increases hemolymph pressure, effectively \"inflating\" the endophallus.  Cornua claspers at the base of the endophallus help to grip the queen.\n\nMating between a single drone and the queen lasts less than 5 seconds, and it is often completed within 1\u20132 seconds. Mating occurs mid-flight, and 10\u201340&nbsp;m above ground.  Since the queen mates with 5\u2013\u206019 drones, and drones die after mating, each drone must make the most of his single shot. The drone makes first contact from above the queen, his thorax above her abdomen, straddling her.  He then grasps her with all six legs, and everts the endophallus into her opened sting chamber. If the queen\u2019s sting chamber is not fully opened, mating is unsuccessful, so some males that mount the queen do not transfer semen. Once the endophallus has been everted, the drone is paralyzed, flipping backwards as he ejaculates.  The process of ejaculation is explosive\u2014semen is blasted through the queen\u2019s sting chamber and into the oviduct. The process is sometimes audible to the human ear, akin to a \"popping\" sound. The ejaculation is so powerful that it ruptures the endophallus, disconnecting the drone from the queen. The bulb of the endophallus is broken off inside of the queen during mating\u2014so drones mate only once, and die shortly after. The leftover endophallus remaining in the queen\u2019s vagina is referred to as the \u201cmating sign\u201d.

These mating sites, called \u2018congregation areas\u2019, are specific locations, where drones wait for the arrival of virgin queens.  A congregation area is typically 10\u201340 m above ground, and can have a diameter of 30\u2013200 m.  The boundaries of a congregation area are distinct; queens flying a few meters outside the boundaries are mostly ignored by the drones.  Congregation areas are typically used year after year, with some spots showing little change over 12 years.  Since drones are expelled from a colony during the winter, and new drones are raised each spring, inexperienced drones must find these congregation areas anew. This suggests some environmental cues  define a congregation area, although the actual cues are unknown.\n\nCongregation areas are typically located above open ground, away from trees or hills, where flight is somewhat protected from the wind (calm winds may be helpful during mating flight).  At the same time, many congregation areas do not show such characteristics, such as those located above water or the forest canopy.  Some studies have suggested that magnetic orientation could play a role, since drones older than 6 days contain cells in the abdomen that are rich in magnetite.\n\nCongregation areas can be located by attaching a virgin queen (in a cage) to a balloon floating above ground.  The person then moves around, taking note of where drones are attracted to the caged queen.  Congregation areas are not found closer than 90&nbsp;m from an [[apiary]], and congregation areas located farther away from apiaries receive more drones.  In a congregation area, drones accumulate from as many as 200 colonies, with estimates of up to 25,000 individual drones.  This broad mixing of drones is how a virgin queen can ensure she will receive the genetic diversity needed for her colony.  By flying to congregation areas further away from her colony, she further increases the probability of out-breeding\n.\n\nA single drone visits multiple congregation areas during his lifetime, often taking multiple trips per afternoon.  A drone\u2019s mating flight averages 20\u201325 minutes, before he must return to the colony to refuel with honey.  While at the site, the drones fly around passively, waiting for the arrival of a virgin.  When the virgin queen arrives to the congregation area, the drones locate her by visual and olfactory cues.  At this point, it is a race to mate with the virgin queen, to be genetically represented in the newly founded colony.  The swarming drones, as they actively follow the queen, reportedly resemble a \u201cdrone comet\u201d, dissolving and reforming as the drones chase the virgin queen.  Drones greatly outnumber the quantity of virgin queens produced per season, so even with multiple mating by the queen, very few drones mate successfully (estimated at less than one in 1000).  If needed, a virgin queen can embark on multiple \u2018nuptial flights\u2019, to be sure to receive enough semen from enough drones.\n\n==''Varroa destructor''==\n[[File:Varroa on larvae.jpg|thumb|right|''Varroa'' mite on a honey bee drone larva]]\n\n''[[Varroa destructor]]'', a parasitic [[mite]], propagates within the [[Brood (honey bee)|brood cell]] of bees.

Unlike the female [[worker bee]], drones do not have stingers and gather neither nectar nor pollen. A drone's primary role is to mate with an unfertilized queen.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:Haplodiploid Sex Determination in Honey Bees.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Drones are [[haploid]], growing from unfertilised eggs by [[arrhenotoky]].]]\n\nDrones carry only one type of [[allele]] at each chromosomal position, because they are [[haploid]] (containing only one set of [[chromosomes]] from the mother). During the development of eggs within a [[Queen bee|queen]], a diploid cell with 32 chromosomes divides to generate haploid cells called [[gametes]] with 16 chromosomes. The result is a haploid egg, with chromosomes having a new combination of alleles at the various [[Locus (genetics)|loci]]. This process is called arrhenotokous parthenogenesis or simply [[arrhenotoky]].\n\nBecause the male bee technically has only a mother, and no father, its genealogical tree is unusual. The first generation has one member (the male). One generation back also has one member (the mother). Two generations back are two members (the mother and father of the mother). Three generations back are three members. Four back are five members. That is, the numbers in each generation going back are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ... \u2013 the [[Fibonacci sequence]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Nickel |first=J. |year=2001 |edition=Revised |title=Mathematics: Is God Silent? |page=242 |location=Vallecito, CA |publisher=Ross House Books |isbn=1-879998-22-X}}</ref>\n\nMuch debate and controversy exist in the scientific literature about the dynamics and apparent benefit of the combined forms of reproduction in honey bees and other social insects, known as the [[Haplodiploidy|haplodiploid]] [[sex-determination system]]. The drones have two reproductive functions: Each drone grows from the queen's unfertilized haploid egg and produces some 10 million male [[Spermatozoon|sperm cells]], each genetically identical to the egg. Drones also serve as a vehicle to mate with a new queen to fertilize her eggs. Female [[worker bee]]s develop from fertilized eggs and are [[diploid]] in origin, which means that the sperm from a father provides a second set of 16 chromosomes for a total of 32: one set from each parent. Since all the sperm cells produced by a particular drone are genetically identical, full sisters are more closely related than full sisters of other animals where the sperm is not genetically identical.\n\nA [[laying worker bee]] exclusively produces totally unfertilized eggs, which develop into drones. As an exception to this rule, laying worker bees in some subspecies of honey bees may also produce diploid (and therefore female) fertile offspring in a process called [[thelytoky]], in which the second set of chromosomes comes not from sperm, but from one of the three [[Polar body|polar bodies]] during [[anaphase II]] of [[meiosis]].\n\nIn honey bees, the genetics of offspring can best be controlled by artificially inseminating a queen with drones collected from a single hive, where the drones' mother is known. In the natural mating process, a queen mates with multiple drones,<ref>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118734</ref> which may not come from the same hive. Therefore, batches of female offspring have fathers of a completely different genetic origin.\n\n==Anatomy==\nA drone is characterized by eyes that are twice the size of those of worker bees and queens, and a body size greater than that of worker bees, though usually smaller than the [[queen bee]]. His abdomen is stouter than the abdomen of workers or queen. Although heavy bodied, the drone must be able to fly fast enough to accompany the queen in flight. The average flight time for a drone is about 20 minutes.\n\nAn ''[[Apis cerana]]'' colony has about 200 drones during high summer peak time.\nDrones depend on worker bees to feed them.\n\nDrones die off or are ejected from the hive by the worker bees in late autumn, and do not reappear in the bee hive until late spring. They would deplete the hive's resources too quickly if they were allowed to stay.\n\n==Role==\nThe drones' main function is to be ready to fertilize a receptive queen. Drones in a hive do not usually mate with a [[Virgin queen bee|virgin queen]] of the same hive because the queen flies further to a drone congregation area than the drones do. Mating generally takes place in or near drone congregation areas. How these areas are selected is poorly understood, but they do exist. When a drone mates with a queen of the same hive, the resultant queen will have a spotty brood pattern (numerous empty cells on a brood frame) due to the removal of diploid drone larvae by nurse bees (i.e., a fertilized egg with two identical sex genes will develop into a drone instead of a worker). The worker bees remove the inbred brood and consume it to recycle the protein.\n\n[[File:Drohn im Flug 08-3.jpg|thumb|In flight]]\n\nMating occurs in flight, which accounts for drones needing better vision, which is provided by their large eyes. Should a drone succeed in mating, the first thing that happens is all of the drone's blood in his body rushes to his endophallus which causes him to lose control over his entire body. His body falls away, leaving a portion of his endophallus attached to the queen which helps guide the next drone in the queen.\n\nHoney bee queen breeders may breed drones to be used for instrumental insemination <ref>https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/download/CAT87209055/PDF</ref> or open mating. A queen [[mating yard]] must have many drones to be successful.\n\nIn areas with severe winters, all drones are driven out of the hive in the autumn. A colony begins to rear drones in spring and drone population reaches its peak coinciding with the [[Swarming (honey bee)|swarm]] season in late spring and early summer. The life expectancy of a drone is about 90 days.\n\nAlthough the drone is highly specialized to perform one function, mating and continuing the propagation of the hive, it is not completely without side benefit to it. All bees, when they sense the hive's temperature deviating from proper limits, either generate heat by shivering, or exhaust heat by moving air with their wings\u2014behaviours which drones share with worker bees.\n\n==Behavior==\nDrones do not exhibit typical worker bee behaviours such as nectar and pollen gathering, nursing, or hive construction. While drones are unable to sting, if picked up, they may swing their tails in an attempt to frighten the disturber.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Reuber |first1=Brant |title=21st Century Homestead: Beekeeping |date=February 2015 |publisher=LuLu.com |isbn=9781312937338 |page=80 }}</ref>  In some species, drones buzz around intruders in an attempt to disorient them if the nest is disturbed.\n\nDrones fly in abundance in the early afternoon and are known to congregate in drone congregation areas a good distance away from the hive.\n\n==Mating and the drone reproductive organ==\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | footer = \n | image1 = Drone honey bee reproductive organ- cornua.JPG\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = The everted endophallus, with the cornua in focus, resembling hooks.\n | image2 = Drone honey bee reproductive organ- penis bulb.JPG\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 = The extended bulbus of the endophallus, containing sperm, is in focus.\n }}\n\nThe drone endophallus is designed to disperse a large quantity of seminal fluid and spermatozoa with great speed and force.  The endophallus is held internally in the drone.  During mating, the organ is everted (turned inside out), into the queen. The eversion of the endophallus is achieved by contracting abdominal muscles, which increases hemolymph pressure, effectively \"inflating\" the endophallus.  Cornua claspers at the base of the endophallus help to grip the queen.\n\nMating between a single drone and the queen lasts less than 5 seconds, and it is often completed within 1\u20132 seconds. Mating occurs mid-flight, and 10\u201340&nbsp;m above ground.  Since the queen mates with 5\u2013\u206019 drones, and drones die after mating, each drone must make the most of his single shot. The drone makes first contact from above the queen, his thorax above her abdomen, straddling her.  He then grasps her with all six legs, and everts the endophallus into her opened sting chamber. If the queen\u2019s sting chamber is not fully opened, mating is unsuccessful, so some males that mount the queen do not transfer semen. Once the endophallus has been everted, the drone is paralyzed, flipping backwards as he ejaculates.  The process of ejaculation is explosive\u2014semen is blasted through the queen\u2019s sting chamber and into the oviduct. The process is sometimes audible to the human ear, akin to a \"popping\" sound. The ejaculation is so powerful that it ruptures the endophallus, disconnecting the drone from the queen. The bulb of the endophallus is broken off inside of the queen during mating\u2014so drones mate only once, and die shortly after. The leftover endophallus remaining in the queen\u2019s vagina is referred to as the \u201cmating sign\u201d.

The club's nickname throughout its history has been \"The Sweeney\".\n\n==History==\n\nFormed in Perth in 1973 by Barry Nesbitt, Tim Neville, John-Joe Moran and Father Eugene O'Sullivan (aka the shinty priest) the club drew upon the number of Highlanders living in the [[Central Belt]] as well as the Irish community in Perth.\n\nOver the years the team has had a second team, run successfully by Roy Whitehead (Rector,Perth High School) who would invariably kid, cajole and extol the virtues of shinty compared with less manly sports to his pupils. However, with Roys retirement the second team consisted mainly of veterans, newcomers and veteran newcomers.  \n\nA great figure in the history of the club was the late Willie Dowds, whose son Cahal would play and more often than not end up in A&E for Tayforth. Willie was also responsible for helping form teams in Dundee and Glenrothes.\nA visionary, he once nearly caused a riot at the Camanachd Associations AGM by suggesting not only Sunday shinty but summer shinty. Some 30 years later the Camanachd Association would introduce summer shinty. Without doubt a character a great man and a sad loss to the shinty community. \nAnother character in those early years was Fr. Eugene O'Sullivan who famously appeared on the front page of the Daily Star in 1982, having been sent-off for punching his opponent. It was only a Kyles athletic player and the Kyles player was lucky that John-Joe Moran was restrained by Sam \"the vet\" Mansley from doing further damage. \nHowever, the return fixture in Perth entered shinty folklore when once again Fr. O'Sullivan was on the receiving end of some extremely unsavoury treatment but didn't rise to the provocation this time. At half time following a discussion between Willie Dowds, John-Joe Moran & Sam Mansley they decided to invoke Willie John McBrides \"99\" call. Thus, the next time Fr O'Sullivan was hit the \"99\" call went out. Within seconds mayhem descended on the South Inch and not one kyles player was left standing. It should be noted there were no sending-offs and Tayforth ran-out 4-1 winners.\n\nWithout doubt, that team of the late 1970s and early 1980s was littered with characters, none more so than Hugh O'Kane who along with Fr. Eugene would lead the team over to Kilkenny, Ireland to participate in \"The Faire Cities Cup\". Stories of missed ferries, flights and lost players would make that era legendary. One player from that era, Bill Adams was last seen entering the Guinness distillery @ St James Gate, Dublin in 1989 and never seen again!!  The legend that is Hugh O'Kane was responsible for landing a sea-king helicopter on the South Inch, Perth, 10 minutes from the end of a Frews Cup match. \nLast known sightings of Hugh were in Helmand province, Afghanistan, where he is stationed with UN. \nHowever, in early January 2016 Hugh passed away. A great servant of Tayforth but more importantly a great man. \nGod bless and rest in peace.\n\nHowever, following the retirement of stalwarts Hugh Macmaster, Terry \"Butcher\" Wade, truly one of Tayforths dirtiest & meanest players and John-Joe Moran a period of decline began. Only for a new breed of players to emerge, none moreso than Donald Kinnear whose dominant displays in midfield would herald the start of a new era. The club reached the [[Camanachd Cup]] semi-final in 1988 and won the national Aviemore sixes in 1990.\n\nThe club ran the annual shinty competition at the [[Blairgowrie and Rattray|Blairgowrie]] Highland Games.  The club has links with Linlithgow Shinty Club at Junior level.\n\nThe club narrowly missed out on promotion to South Division One in 2011 after a winner-takes-all game with Strachur.  Due to the poor state of the pitch at the North Inch during season 2011, many games were played at Edinburgh East Lothian's old park, Levenhall Links.  Tayforth made a move to Levenhall on a more continuous basis for season 2012.[http://www.flickr.com/photos/leith/6997930951/in/photostream/]\n\nTayforth have continued into their 40th year and will be marking this with a series of events towards the end of 2013 culminating in a  dinner at The Caves, in Edinburgh\u2019s Cowgate, with guest speaker Hugh Dan MacLennan and music from The Occasionals. Prior to the dinner  the deep heat will be in plentiful supply  as Tayforth players past and present turn out for a match in celebration of the Club\u2019s 40th Anniversary. \nUnfortunately Terry Wade is unable to play due him still serving a suspension.\nThe match, which takes place at Levenhall Links, Musselburgh \u2013 throw up 1pm \u2013 will feature Badenoch stars Stuart Ferrier and Rory Fraser (really), as well as Father and Son combo Derry and Calum Barton. Staying true to the Irish roots of Tayforth, Brendan Duggan, the latest in a long line of Hurlers turned Shinty players, will also take to the field.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/1052/Tayforth_look_to_the_strath_for_new_blood.html Tayforth search for New Blood]\n*[http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/alba/radio/rapal/andj.shtml Sgioba Iomain Oifigeil Rapal - Official Shinty Team of BBC RnaG's RAPAL]\n\n{{Shinty teams}}\n\n[[Category:Shinty teams]]\n[[Category:Perth, Scotland]]\n[[Category:Sport in East Lothian]]\n[[Category:Sport in Perth and Kinross]]\n[[Category:Sport in Dundee]]\n[[Category:1873 establishments in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Sports clubs established in 1873]]\n", "name_user": "Dl2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "restore to last undamaged version; rv unref and nonimprovement", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tayforth_Camanachd"}
