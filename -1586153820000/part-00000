Note that a particular group may warrant listing under more than one region, either because the group is distributed in more than one region (example: [[Inuit]] in North America and eastern Russia), or there may be some overlap of the regions themselves (that is, the boundaries of each region are not always clear, and some locations may commonly be associated with more than one region).\n\n== Definition ==\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples#Definitions}}\n\nIndigenous communities, peoples and nations are those which, having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing on those territories, or parts of them. They form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as coples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal system.<ref>Jose R. Martinez Cobo</ref>\n\nThis historical continuity may consist of the continuation, for an extended period reaching into the present of one or more of the following factors:\n\n* Occupation of ancestral lands, or at least of part of them\n* Common ancestry with the original occupants of these lands\n* Culture in general, or in specific manifestations (such as religion, living under a tribal system, membership of an indigenous community, dress, means of livelihood, lifestyle, etc.)\n* Language (whether used as the only language, as mother-tongue, as the habitual means of communication at home or in the family, or as the main, preferred, habitual, general or normal language)\n* Residence in certain parts of the country, or in certain regions of the world\n* Other relevant factors.\n* On an individual basis, an indigenous person is one who belongs to these indigenous populations through self-identification as indigenous (group consciousness) and is recognized and accepted by these populations as one of its members (acceptance by the group). This preserves for these communities the sovereign right and power to decide who belongs to them, without external interference.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110809174257/http://www.indigenouspeoples.nl/indigenous-peoples/definition-indigenous Definition of indigenous peoples]</ref>\n\n== Afro-Eurasia

Note that a particular group may warrant listing under more than one region, either because the group is distributed in more than one region (example: [[Inuit]] in North America and eastern Russia), or there may be some overlap of the regions themselves (that is, the boundaries of each region are not always clear, and some locations may commonly be associated with more than one region).\n\n== Definition ==\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples#Definitions}}\nIndigenous communities, peoples and nations are those which, having a historical continuity with pre-invasion and pre-colonial societies that developed on their territories, consider themselves distinct from other sectors of the societies now prevailing on those territories, or parts of them. They form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as coples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal system.<ref>Jose R. Martinez Cobo</ref>\n\nThis historical continuity may consist of the continuation, for an extended period reaching into the present of one or more of the following factors:\n* Occupation of ancestral lands, or at least of part of them\n* Common ancestry with the original occupants of these lands\n* Culture in general, or in specific manifestations (such as religion, living under a tribal system, membership of an indigenous community, dress, means of livelihood, lifestyle, etc.)\n* Language (whether used as the only language, as mother-tongue, as the habitual means of communication at home or in the family, or as the main, preferred, habitual, general or normal language)\n* Residence in certain parts of the country, or in certain regions of the world\n* Other relevant factors.\n* On an individual basis, an indigenous person is one who belongs to these indigenous populations through self-identification as indigenous (group consciousness) and is recognized and accepted by these populations as one of its members (acceptance by the group). This preserves for these communities the sovereign right and power to decide who belongs to them, without external interference.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110809174257/http://www.indigenouspeoples.nl/indigenous-peoples/definition-indigenous Definition of indigenous peoples]</ref>\n\n== Africa
