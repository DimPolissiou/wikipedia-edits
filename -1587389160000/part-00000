Immediately after this, they follow him ([[Luke 5]]:4\u201311). The [[Gospel of John]] gives a comparable account of \"The First Disciples\" ([[John 1]]:35\u201342). In John, the readers are told that it was two disciples of [[John the Baptist]] (Andrew and an unnamed disciple) who heard John the Baptist announce Jesus as the \"[[Lamb of God]]\" and then followed Jesus. Andrew then went to his brother Simon, saying, \"We have found the [[Messiah]]\", and then brought Simon to Jesus.\n\n[[File:Cavalier d'Arpino - Christ Taken Prisoner - WGA04690.jpg|thumb|right|Apostle Peter striking the [[High Priest]]s' servant [[Malchus]] with a sword in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], by [[Giuseppe Cesari]] c. 1597]]\n\nThree of the four gospels\u2014Matthew, Mark and John\u2014recount the story of Jesus [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]].

Peter initially refused to let Jesus wash his feet, but when Jesus threatened him with: \"If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me\", Peter replied: \"Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head\" ([[John 13]]:2\u201311). The [[foot washing|washing of feet]] is often repeated in the [[service of worship]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] by some [[Christian denominations]].\n\nThe three [[Synoptic Gospels]] all mention that, when Jesus was arrested, one of his companions cut off the ear of a servant of the [[High Priest of Israel]] ([[Matthew 26]]:51, [[Mark 14]]:47, [[Luke 22]]:50). The Gospel of John also includes this event and names Peter as the swordsman and [[Malchus]] as the victim ([[John 18]]:10). Luke adds that Jesus touched the ear and miraculously healed it ([[Luke 22]]:49\u201351).

After receiving a vision from [[God]] that allowed for the eating of previously unclean animals, Peter takes a missionary journey to [[Lod|Lydda]], [[Jaffa, Israel|Joppa]] and [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] ([[Acts 9]]:32\u2013[[Acts 10]]:2), becoming instrumental in the decision to evangelise the [[Gentile]]s ([[Acts 10]]).

Peter features again in Galatians, fourteen years later, when Paul (now with [[Barnabas]] and [[Saint Titus|Titus]]) returned to Jerusalem ([[Galatians 2]]:7-9).

The three Synoptics and John describe the three denials as follows:\n# A denial when a female servant of the high priest spots Simon Peter, saying that he had been with Jesus. According to Mark (but not in all manuscripts), \"the rooster crowed\". Only Luke and John mention a fire by which Peter was warming himself among other people: according to Luke, Peter was \"sitting\"; according to John, he was \"standing\".\n# A denial when Simon Peter had gone out to the gateway, away from the firelight, but the same servant girl (Mark) or another servant girl (Matthew) or a man (Luke and also John, for whom, though, this is the third denial) told the bystanders he was a follower of Jesus. According to John, \"the rooster crowed\". The Gospel of John places the second denial while Peter was still warming himself at the fire, and gives as the occasion of the third denial a claim by someone to have seen him in the garden of [[Gethsemane]] when [[arrest of Jesus|Jesus was arrested]].\n# A denial came when Peter's Galilean accent was taken as proof that he was indeed a disciple of Jesus. According to Matthew, Mark and Luke, \"the rooster crowed\". Matthew adds that it was his [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] that gave him away as coming from Galilee. Luke deviates slightly from this by stating that, rather than a crowd accusing Simon Peter, it was a third individual.

This took place three months after the disastrous fire that destroyed Rome for which the emperor (Nero) wished to blame the Christians. This \"dies imperii\" (regnal day anniversary) was an important one, exactly ten years after Nero ascended to the throne, and it was \"as usual\" accompanied by much bloodshed. Traditionally, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities sentenced him to death by [[crucifixion]]. In accordance with the [[apocryphal]] [[Acts of Peter]], he was crucified head down.<ref>[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/actspeter.html Apocryphal ''Acts of Peter Chapter 37''].</ref> Tradition also locates his burial place where the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica of Saint Peter]] was later built, directly beneath the Basilica's high altar.\n\n[[File:Crucifixion of Saint Peter-Caravaggio (c.1600).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Crucifixion of Saint Peter (Caravaggio)|The Crucifixion of Saint Peter]]'' (1601) by [[Caravaggio]]]]\n\n[[Pope Clement I]] (d.99), in his ''Letter to the Corinthians'' (Chapter 5), written c. 80\u201398, speaks of Peter's martyrdom in the following terms: \"Let us take the noble examples of our own generation.

([[Vercelli manuscript|Vercelli]] Acts XXXV<ref>[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/actspeter.html The Acts of Peter], by M. R.

According to the story, Peter, fleeing Rome to avoid execution meets the risen Jesus. In the Latin translation, Peter asks Jesus, \"Quo vadis?\" He replies, \"''Romam eo iterum crucifigi\"'' (\"I am going to Rome to be crucified again\"). Peter then gains the courage to continue his ministry and returns to the city, where he is martyred. This story is commemorated in an [[Annibale Carracci]] painting. The [[Quo Vadis (church)|Church of Quo Vadis]], near the [[Catacombs]] of [[Pope Callistus I|Saint Callistus]], contains a stone in which Jesus' footprints from this event are supposedly preserved, though this was apparently an ''[[ex-voto]]'' from a [[pilgrim]], and indeed a copy of the original housed in the [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura|Basilica of St Sebastian]].\n\nThe death of Peter is attested to by [[Tertullian]] (c. 155\u2013c. 240) at the end of the 2nd century in his ''Prescription Against Heretics'', noting that Peter endured a passion like his Lord's.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Quintus Septimius Florens|first1=Tertullian|title=Prescription Against Heretics Chapter XXXVI|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.v.iii.xxxvi.html|publisher=ccel.org|accessdate=1 June 2015}} \"Since, moreover, you are close upon Italy, you have Rome, from which there comes even into our own hands the very authority (of apostles themselves).

[[Augustine of Hippo]] says in his Sermon 295: \"One day is assigned for the celebration of the martyrdom of the two apostles. But those two were one. Although their martyrdom occurred on different days, they were one.\"\n\nThis is also the feast of both [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] in the calendar of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\nIn the [[Roman Rite]], the feast of the [[Chair of Saint Peter]] is celebrated on 22 February, and the anniversary of the dedication of the two [[Papal Basilica|papal basilicas]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul outside the Walls]] is held on 18 November.\n\nBefore [[Pope John XXIII]]'s revision in 1960, the Roman Calendar also included on 18 January another feast of the Chair of Saint Peter (denominated the Chair of Saint Peter in Rome, while the February feast was then called that of the Chair of Saint Peter at Antioch), and on 1 August the feast of [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Saint Peter in Chains]].\n\nIn the Orthodox [[Daily Office]] every Thursday throughout the year is dedicated to the Holy Apostles, including St. Peter. There are also two [[feast day]]s in the year which are dedicated to him:\n\n* June 29, [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]]\u2014This is a major feast day and is preceded by a period of Lenten fasting known as the [[Apostles' Fast]].\n* January 16, [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Veneration of the Precious Chains of the Holy and All-Glorious Apostle Peter]]\u2014commemorating both the chains which {{Bibleref2|Acts|12:1\u201311}} says miraculously fell from him, and the chains in which he was held before his [[martyr]]dom by [[Nero]].\n\n==Primacy of Peter==\nChristians of different theological backgrounds are in disagreement as to the exact significance of Peter's ministry. For instance: \n* Catholics view Peter as the first pope. The Catholic Church asserts that Peter's ministry, conferred upon him by Jesus of Nazareth in the gospels, lays down the theological foundation for the pope's exercise of pastoral authority over the Church.\n* Eastern Orthodox also believe that Peter's ministry points to an underlying theology wherein a special primacy ought to be granted to Peter's successors above other Church leaders but see this as merely a \"primacy of honor\", rather than the right to exercise pastoral authority.\n* Protestant denominations assert that Peter's apostolic work in Rome does not imply a connection between him and the papacy.\nSimilarly, historians of various backgrounds also offer differing interpretations of the Apostle's presence in Rome.\n\n===Catholic Church===\n{{Main|Primacy of Simon Peter|Papal primacy}}\n[[File:Statua di San Pietro realizzata da Giuseppe De Fabris - Piazza di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of St. Peter in [[St. Peter's Square]] at the Vatican]]\n\nAccording to Catholic belief, Simon Peter was distinguished by Jesus to hold the [[Primacy of Simon Peter|first place of honor and authority]]. Also in Catholic belief, Peter was, as the first Bishop of Rome, the first [[Pope]]. Furthermore, they consider every Pope to be Peter's successor and the rightful superior of all other [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]].<ref name=CEPope>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope|author=Joyce, G.

He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that \"Kepha\" was the Aramaic word for \"rock\", and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter.<ref name=Time/>\n\nYet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: \"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \"warrant of the papal succession.\"<ref name=Time>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html |title=Religion: Peter & the Rock |publisher=Time |date=1953-12-07 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref> Cullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.<ref name=\"Time\" />\n\nThere are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \"Rock.\"<ref>D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).</ref> Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.<ref name=\"keating\" />\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means \"this very\" or \"this same\", when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.<ref>''Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''</ref>\n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of \"Rock\" by looking at the Aramaic language. While the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual, which is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, ''not'' Aramaic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203191915/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|url-status=dead|title=''The Doctrine of Church and Ministry in the Life of the Church Today''|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203192344/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Cross-Cultural And Multicultural Ministry In the New Testament|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.graceway.com/articles/article_017.html|title=Some Thoughts on Matthew 16:18|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nLutheran historians even report that the Catholic church itself didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the rock until the 1870s:\n{{quote|Rome's rule for explaining the Scriptures and determining doctrine is the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)#Tridentine Creed|Creed]] of [[Pius IV]].

Another title used for Peter is ''Coryphaeus'', which could be translated as \"Choir-director\", or lead singer.<ref>[[John Meyendorff]], et al. (1963), ''The Primacy of Peter in the Orthodox Church'' ([[St. Vladimir's Seminary]] Press, Crestwood NY, {{ISBN|978-0-88141-125-6}})</ref> The church recognizes Apostle Peter's leadership role in the [[early church]], especially in the very early days at Jerusalem, but does not consider him to have had any \"princely\" role over his fellow Apostles.\n\nThe New Testament is not seen by the Orthodox as supporting any extraordinary authority for Peter with regard to faith or morals. The Orthodox also hold that Peter did not act as leader at the [[Council of Jerusalem]], but as merely one of a number who spoke. The final decision regarding the non-necessity of [[circumcision]] (and certain prohibitions) was spelled out by [[James, the Brother of the Lord]] (though Catholics hold James merely reiterated and fleshed out what Peter had said, regarding the latter's earlier divine revelation regarding the inclusion of Gentiles).\n\nEastern and Oriental Orthodox do not recognize the Bishop of Rome as the successor of St. Peter but the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul. In the [[declaration of Ravenna|Ravenna Document]] of 13 October 2007, the representatives of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] agreed that \"Rome, as the Church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St. Ignatius of Antioch (\"To the Romans\", Prologue), occupied the first place in the ''taxis'', and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the ''protos'' among the patriarchs, if the Papacy unites with the Orthodox Church. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the bishop of Rome as ''protos'', a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium.\"\n\nWith regard to Jesus' words to Peter, \"Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church\", the Orthodox hold Christ is referring to the confession of faith, ''not'' the person of Peter as that upon which he will build the church. This is allegedly shown by the fact that the original Greek uses the feminine demonstrative pronoun when he says \"upon this rock\" (\u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u1fc3 \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u1fb3); whereas, grammatically, if he had been referring to Peter, he would allegedly have used the masculine.<ref>Holy Apostles Convent (1999) ''The Orthodox New Testament'', Vol. I: The Holy Gospels (Dormition Skete, Buena Vista CO, {{ISBN|0-944359-13-2}}) p. 105</ref> This \"gender distinction\" argument is also held by some Protestants.\n\n===Syriac Orthodox Church===\n[[File:Antonio de Bellis - La liberazione di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Saint Peter and the angel'', by [[Antonio de Bellis]] ]] \nThe Fathers of the Syriac Orthodox Church tried to give a theological interpretation to the primacy of Apostle Peter. They were fully convinced of the unique office of Peter in the primitive Christian community. [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]], [[Aphrahat]] and [[Maruthas]] who were supposed to have been the best exponents of the early [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac tradition]] unequivocally acknowledge the office of Peter.\n\nThe Syriac Fathers, following the rabbinic tradition, call Jesus \"Kepha\" for they see \"rock\" in the Old Testament as a messianic Symbol (yet the Old Maronite Syriacs of Lebanon still refer to Saint Peter as \"Saint Simon the Generous\" or Simon Karam\"). When Christ gave his own name \"Kepha\" to Simon he was giving him participation in the person and office of Christ. Christ who is the Kepha and shepherd made Simon the chief shepherd in his place and gave him the very name Kepha and said that on Kepha he would build the Church. [[Aphrahat]] shared the common Syriac tradition. For him Kepha is in fact another name of Jesus, and Simon was given the right to share the name. The person who receives somebody else's name also obtains the rights of the person who bestows the name. Aphrahat makes the stone taken from Jordan a type of Peter. He wrote: \"Jesus son of Nun set up the stones for a witness in Israel; Jesus our Saviour called Simon Kepha Sarirto and set him as the faithful witness among nations.\"\n\nAgain he wrote in his commentary on [[Deuteronomy]] that [[Moses]] brought forth water from \"rock\" (Kepha) for the people and Jesus sent Simon Kepha to carry his teachings among nations. God accepted him and made him the foundation of the Church and called him Kepha. When he speaks about the transfiguration of Christ he calls him [[Simon Peter]], the foundation of the Church. Ephrem also shared the same view. The Armenian version of [[De Virginitate]] records that [[Peter the rock]] shunned honour. A ''mimro'' of Efrem found in Holy Week Liturgy points to the importance of Peter.\n\nBoth [[Aphrahat]] and [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]] represent the authentic tradition of the Syrian Church. The different orders of liturgies used for sanctification of Church buildings, marriage, ordination, ''et cetera'', reveal that the primacy of Peter is a part of living faith of the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syrianchurch.org/Articles/PrimacyofStPeter.htm |title=\"Primacy of St. Peter\" \u2013 by Dr. Thomas Athanasius |publisher=Syrianchurch.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>\n\n===New Apostolic Church===\nThe [[New Apostolic Church]], which believes in the re-established Apostle ministry, sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]].\n\n===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===\n[[File:Saint Peter by Gr\u00e3o Vasco.jpg|thumb|''Saint Peter'' by [[Gr\u00e3o Vasco|Vasco Fernandes]], 1506]]\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] teaches that Peter was the first leader of the early Christian church after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Both demonstrate a high quality of cultured and urban Greek, at odds with the linguistic skill that would ordinarily be expected of an [[Aramaic]]-speaking fisherman, who would have learned Greek as a second or third language.

Wallace]] (who maintains that Peter was the author) writes that, for many scholars, \"the issue of authorship is already settled, at least negatively: the apostle Peter did not write this letter\" and that \"the vast bulk of NT scholars adopts this perspective without much discussion\". However, he later states, \"Although a very strong case has been made against Petrine authorship of 2 Peter, we believe it is deficient. ...Taken together, these external and internal arguments strongly suggest the traditional view, viz., that Peter was indeed the author of the second epistle which bears his name.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20031209164253/http://www.bible.org/docs/soapbox/2petotl.htm ''Second Peter: Introduction, Argument, and Outline''].

The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] and the biographer [[Suetonius]] do both record that Nero persecuted Christians, and Tacitus dates this to immediately after the fire that burned Rome in 64. Christian tradition, for example Eusebius of Caesarea (''History'' book 2, 24.1), has maintained that Peter was killed in Nero's persecution, and thus had to assume that the Roman persecution alluded to in First Peter must be this Neronian persecution.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> On the other hand, many modern scholars argue that First Peter refers to the persecution of Christians in Asia Minor during the reign of the emperor [[Domitian]] (81\u201396), as the letter is explicitly addressed to Jewish Christians from that region:\n\n{{quote|Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to God's elect, strangers in the world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance.{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|1:1\u20132}}}}\n\nThose scholars who believe that the epistle dates from the time of Domitian argue that Nero's persecution of Christians was confined to the city of Rome itself, and did not extend to the Asian provinces mentioned in 1 Pet 1:1\u20132.\n \nThe [[Second Epistle of Peter]], on the other hand, appears to have been copied, in part, from the [[Epistle of Jude]], and some modern scholars date its composition as late as ''c.'' 150. Some scholars argue the opposite, that the Epistle of Jude copied Second Peter, while others contend an early date for Jude and thus observe that an early date is not incompatible with the text.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> Many scholars have noted the similarities between the [[apocrypha]]l [[Second Epistle of Clement]] (2nd century) and Second Peter. Second Peter may be earlier than 150; there are a few possible references to it that date back to the 1st century or early 2nd century, e.g., [[1 Clement]] written in ''c.'' AD 96, and the later church historian Eusebius wrote that [[Origen]] had made reference to the epistle before 250.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Eusebius|title=Church History Book VI, Chapter 25|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nJerome says that Peter \"wrote two epistles which are called Catholic, the second of which, on account of its difference from the first in style, is considered by many not to be by him\"''(De Viris Illustribus 1).''<ref>{{cite web|last1=saint|first1=Jerome|title=De Viris Illustribus (On Illustrious Men) Chapter 1|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> But he himself received the epistle, and explained the difference in style, character, and structure of words by the assumption that Peter used different interpreters in the composition of the two epistles;<ref name=\"Jerome\" /> and from his time onward the epistle was generally regarded as a part of the New Testament.\n\nEven in early times there was controversy over its authorship, and Second Peter was often not included in the [[biblical canon]]; it was only in the 4th century that it gained a firm foothold in the New Testament, in a series of synods. In the East the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] still did not admit it into the canon until the 6th century.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/>\n\n====Mark====\nTraditionally, the [[Gospel of Mark#Authorship and sources|Gospel of Mark]] was said to have been written by a person named [[John Mark]], and that this person was an assistant to Peter; hence its content was traditionally seen as the closest to Peter's viewpoint. According to Eusebius' ''Ecclesiastical History'', [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] recorded this belief from [[John the Presbyter]]:\n\n{{quote|Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a normal or chronological narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictional into the statements.<ref>Eusebius,'' Ecclesiastical History'', 3.39.14\u201316</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nClement of Alexandria in the fragments of his work ''Hypotyposes'' (A.D. 190) preserved and cited by the historian Eusebius in his ''Church History'' (VI, 14: 6) writes that:\n\n{{quote|As Peter had preached the Word publicly at Rome, and declared the Gospel by the Spirit, many who were present requested that [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], who had followed him for a long time and remembered his sayings, should write them out. And having composed the Gospel he gave it to those who had requested it.<ref name=\"CL\" />}}\n\nAlso Irenaeus wrote about this tradition:\n\n{{quote|After their (Peter and Paul's) passing, Mark also, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, transmitted to us in writing the things preached by Peter.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III. 1.2.; quoted by Eusebius in ''Ecclesiastical History'', book 5, 7.6</ref>}}\n\nBased on these quotes, and on the Christian tradition, the information in Mark's gospel about Peter would be based on eyewitness material.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> The gospel itself is [[Anonymous work|anonymous]], and the above passages are the oldest surviving written testimony to its authorship.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/>\n\n===Pseudepigrapha and apocrypha===\n[[File:Muenster-100725-15996-\u00dcberwasserkirche-Schl\u00fcssel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|The [[Key (lock)|key]] as symbol of St. Peter]]\nThere are also a number of other [[apocrypha]]l writings, that have been either attributed to or written about Peter.

The account is similar to that of the canonical gospels, especially the [[Gospel of Mark]]. It is unclear whether the fragment is an abridged version of the accounts in the [[synoptic gospels]], or a source text on which they were based, perhaps the apocryphal Gospel of Peter.<ref>''Das Evangelium nach Petrus.

He thus contrasts with [[Paul the Apostle]] who is bald except at the sides, with a longer beard and often black hair, and thinner in the face. One exception to this is in [[Anglo-Saxon art]], where he typically lacks a beard. Both Peter and Paul are shown thus as early as the 4th century [[Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter]] in Rome.<ref>Higgitt, John, \"The Iconography of Saint Peter in Anglo-Saxon England, and Saint Cuthbert's Coffin\", pp. 267\u2013272, 270 quoted, in: Bonner, Gerald, Rollason, David & Stancliffe, Clare, eds., ''St. Cuthbert, his Cult and his Community to AD 1200''.

By the 15th century Peter is more likely to be bald on the top of his head in the Western church, but he continues to have a good head of hair in Orthodox icons.\n\nThe depiction of Saint Peter as literally the keeper of the gates of heaven, popular with modern cartoonists, is not found in traditional religious art, but Peter usually heads groups of saints flanking God in heaven, on the right hand side (viewer's left) of God. Narrative images of Peter include several scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' where he is mentioned in the gospels, and he is often identifiable in scenes where his presence is not specifically mentioned. Usually he stands nearest to Christ. In particular, depictions of the ''[[Arrest of Christ]]'' usually include Peter cutting off the ear of one of the soldiers. Scenes without Jesus include his distinctive martyrdom, his rescue from prison, and sometimes his trial. In the [[Counter-Reformation]] scenes of Peter hearing the cock crow for the third time became popular, as a representation of [[repentance]] and hence the Catholic [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (sacrament)|Confession]] or Reconciliation.\n\n==Patronage==\n<!-- This section is linked from the Christian leader infobox at top -->\n[[File:Peter in Chora.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Medieval mosaic of Saint Peter in the [[Chora Church]], Istanbul]]\n[[File:Ancient icon of sts peter & paul.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Icon of Saint Peter and Paul]]\n[[File:Llanbeblig Hours (f. 2v.)

Jesus then amazes Simon and his companions James and John (Andrew is not mentioned) by telling them to lower their nets, whereupon they catch a huge number of fish. Immediately after this, they follow him ([[Luke 5]]:4\u201311). The [[Gospel of John]] gives a comparable account of \"The First Disciples\" ([[John 1]]:35\u201342). In John, the readers are told that it was two disciples of [[John the Baptist]] (Andrew and an unnamed disciple) who heard John the Baptist announce Jesus as the \"[[Lamb of God]]\" and then followed Jesus. Andrew then went to his brother Simon, saying, \"We have found the [[Messiah]]\", and then brought Simon to Jesus.\n\n[[File:Cavalier d'Arpino - Christ Taken Prisoner - WGA04690.jpg|thumb|right|Apostle Peter striking the [[High Priest]]s' servant [[Malchus]] with a sword in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], by [[Giuseppe Cesari]] c. 1597]]\n\nThree of the four gospels\u2014Matthew, Mark and John\u2014recount the story of Jesus [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]]. Matthew additionally describes Peter walking on water for a moment but beginning to sink when his faith wavers ([[Matthew 14]]:28\u201331).\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Last Supper]], Jesus washed his disciples' feet. Peter initially refused to let Jesus wash his feet, but when Jesus threatened him with: \"If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me\", Peter replied: \"Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head\" ([[John 13]]:2\u201311). The [[foot washing|washing of feet]] is often repeated in the [[service of worship]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] by some [[Christian denominations]].\n\nThe three [[Synoptic Gospels]] all mention that, when Jesus was arrested, one of his companions cut off the ear of a servant of the [[High Priest of Israel]] ([[Matthew 26]]:51, [[Mark 14]]:47, [[Luke 22]]:50). The Gospel of John also includes this event and names Peter as the swordsman and [[Malchus]] as the victim ([[John 18]]:10). Luke adds that Jesus touched the ear and miraculously healed it ([[Luke 22]]:49\u201351). This healing of the servant's ear is the last of the [[Miracles of Jesus|37 miracles attributed to Jesus]] in the Bible.\n\nSimon Peter was twice arraigned, with John, before the [[Sanhedrin]] and directly defied them ([[Acts 4]]:7\u201322, [[Acts 5]]:18\u201342). After receiving a vision from [[God]] that allowed for the eating of previously unclean animals, Peter takes a missionary journey to [[Lod|Lydda]], [[Jaffa, Israel|Joppa]] and [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] ([[Acts 9]]:32\u2013[[Acts 10]]:2), becoming instrumental in the decision to evangelise the [[Gentile]]s ([[Acts 10]]).

Peter/Cephas is mentioned briefly in the opening chapter of one of the [[Pauline epistles]], [[Epistle to the Galatians]], which mentions a trip by [[Paul the Apostle]] to [[Jerusalem]] where he meets Peter ([[Galatians 1]]:18). Peter features again in Galatians, fourteen years later, when Paul (now with [[Barnabas]] and [[Saint Titus|Titus]]) returned to Jerusalem ([[Galatians 2]]:7-9).

The three Synoptics and John describe the three denials as follows:\n# A denial when a female servant of the high priest spots Simon Peter, saying that he had been with Jesus. According to Mark (but not in all manuscripts), \"the rooster crowed\". Only Luke and John mention a fire by which Peter was warming himself among other people: according to Luke, Peter was \"sitting\"; according to John, he was \"standing\".\n# A denial when Simon Peter had gone out to the gateway, away from the firelight, but the same servant girl (Mark) or another servant girl (Matthew) or a man (Luke and also John, for whom, though, this is the third denial) told the bystanders he was a follower of Jesus. According to John, \"the rooster crowed\". The Gospel of John places the second denial while Peter was still warming himself at the fire, and gives as the occasion of the third denial a claim by someone to have seen him in the garden of [[Gethsemane]] when [[arrest of Jesus|Jesus was arrested]].\n# A denial came when Peter's Galilean accent was taken as proof that he was indeed a disciple of Jesus. According to Matthew, Mark and Luke, \"the rooster crowed\". Matthew adds that it was his [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] that gave him away as coming from Galilee. Luke deviates slightly from this by stating that, rather than a crowd accusing Simon Peter, it was a third individual.

This took place three months after the disastrous fire that destroyed Rome for which the emperor (Nero) wished to blame the Christians. This \"dies imperii\" (regnal day anniversary) was an important one, exactly ten years after Nero ascended to the throne, and it was \"as usual\" accompanied by much bloodshed. Traditionally, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities sentenced him to death by [[crucifixion]]. In accordance with the [[apocryphal]] [[Acts of Peter]], he was crucified head down.<ref>[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/actspeter.html Apocryphal ''Acts of Peter Chapter 37''].</ref> Tradition also locates his burial place where the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica of Saint Peter]] was later built, directly beneath the Basilica's high altar.\n\n[[File:Crucifixion of Saint Peter-Caravaggio (c.1600).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Crucifixion of Saint Peter (Caravaggio)|The Crucifixion of Saint Peter]]'' (1601) by [[Caravaggio]]]]\n\n[[Pope Clement I]] (d.99), in his ''Letter to the Corinthians'' (Chapter 5), written c. 80\u201398, speaks of Peter's martyrdom in the following terms: \"Let us take the noble examples of our own generation.

([[Vercelli manuscript|Vercelli]] Acts XXXV<ref>[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/actspeter.html The Acts of Peter], by M. R.

According to the story, Peter, fleeing Rome to avoid execution meets the risen Jesus. In the Latin translation, Peter asks Jesus, \"Quo vadis?\" He replies, \"''Romam eo iterum crucifigi\"'' (\"I am going to Rome to be crucified again\"). Peter then gains the courage to continue his ministry and returns to the city, where he is martyred. This story is commemorated in an [[Annibale Carracci]] painting. The [[Quo Vadis (church)|Church of Quo Vadis]], near the [[Catacombs]] of [[Pope Callistus I|Saint Callistus]], contains a stone in which Jesus' footprints from this event are supposedly preserved, though this was apparently an ''[[ex-voto]]'' from a [[pilgrim]], and indeed a copy of the original housed in the [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura|Basilica of St Sebastian]].\n\nThe death of Peter is attested to by [[Tertullian]] (c. 155\u2013c. 240) at the end of the 2nd century in his ''Prescription Against Heretics'', noting that Peter endured a passion like his Lord's.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Quintus Septimius Florens|first1=Tertullian|title=Prescription Against Heretics Chapter XXXVI|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.v.iii.xxxvi.html|publisher=ccel.org|accessdate=1 June 2015}} \"Since, moreover, you are close upon Italy, you have Rome, from which there comes even into our own hands the very authority (of apostles themselves).

[[Augustine of Hippo]] says in his Sermon 295: \"One day is assigned for the celebration of the martyrdom of the two apostles. But those two were one. Although their martyrdom occurred on different days, they were one.\"\n\nThis is also the feast of both [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] in the calendar of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\nIn the [[Roman Rite]], the feast of the [[Chair of Saint Peter]] is celebrated on 22 February, and the anniversary of the dedication of the two [[Papal Basilica|papal basilicas]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul outside the Walls]] is held on 18 November.\n\nBefore [[Pope John XXIII]]'s revision in 1960, the Roman Calendar also included on 18 January another feast of the Chair of Saint Peter (denominated the Chair of Saint Peter in Rome, while the February feast was then called that of the Chair of Saint Peter at Antioch), and on 1 August the feast of [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Saint Peter in Chains]].\n\nIn the Orthodox [[Daily Office]] every Thursday throughout the year is dedicated to the Holy Apostles, including St. Peter. There are also two [[feast day]]s in the year which are dedicated to him:\n\n* June 29, [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]]\u2014This is a major feast day and is preceded by a period of Lenten fasting known as the [[Apostles' Fast]].\n* January 16, [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Veneration of the Precious Chains of the Holy and All-Glorious Apostle Peter]]\u2014commemorating both the chains which {{Bibleref2|Acts|12:1\u201311}} says miraculously fell from him, and the chains in which he was held before his [[martyr]]dom by [[Nero]].\n\n==Primacy of Peter==\nChristians of different theological backgrounds are in disagreement as to the exact significance of Peter's ministry. For instance: \n* Catholics view Peter as the first pope. The Catholic Church asserts that Peter's ministry, conferred upon him by Jesus of Nazareth in the gospels, lays down the theological foundation for the pope's exercise of pastoral authority over the Church.\n* Eastern Orthodox also believe that Peter's ministry points to an underlying theology wherein a special primacy ought to be granted to Peter's successors above other Church leaders but see this as merely a \"primacy of honor\", rather than the right to exercise pastoral authority.\n* Protestant denominations assert that Peter's apostolic work in Rome does not imply a connection between him and the papacy.\nSimilarly, historians of various backgrounds also offer differing interpretations of the Apostle's presence in Rome.\n\n===Catholic Church===\n{{Main|Primacy of Simon Peter|Papal primacy}}\n[[File:Statua di San Pietro realizzata da Giuseppe De Fabris - Piazza di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of St. Peter in [[St. Peter's Square]] at the Vatican]]\n\nAccording to Catholic belief, Simon Peter was distinguished by Jesus to hold the [[Primacy of Simon Peter|first place of honor and authority]]. Also in Catholic belief, Peter was, as the first Bishop of Rome, the first [[Pope]]. Furthermore, they consider every Pope to be Peter's successor and the rightful superior of all other [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]].<ref name=CEPope>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope|author=Joyce, G.

He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that \"Kepha\" was the Aramaic word for \"rock\", and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter.<ref name=Time/>\n\nYet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: \"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \"warrant of the papal succession.\"<ref name=Time>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html |title=Religion: Peter & the Rock |publisher=Time |date=1953-12-07 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref> Cullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.<ref name=\"Time\" />\n\nThere are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \"Rock.\"<ref>D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).</ref> Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.<ref name=\"keating\" />\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means \"this very\" or \"this same\", when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.<ref>''Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''</ref>\n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of \"Rock\" by looking at the Aramaic language. While the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual, which is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, ''not'' Aramaic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203191915/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|url-status=dead|title=''The Doctrine of Church and Ministry in the Life of the Church Today''|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203192344/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Cross-Cultural And Multicultural Ministry In the New Testament|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.graceway.com/articles/article_017.html|title=Some Thoughts on Matthew 16:18|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nLutheran historians even report that the Catholic church itself didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the rock until the 1870s:\n{{quote|Rome's rule for explaining the Scriptures and determining doctrine is the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)#Tridentine Creed|Creed]] of [[Pius IV]].

Another title used for Peter is ''Coryphaeus'', which could be translated as \"Choir-director\", or lead singer.<ref>[[John Meyendorff]], et al. (1963), ''The Primacy of Peter in the Orthodox Church'' ([[St. Vladimir's Seminary]] Press, Crestwood NY, {{ISBN|978-0-88141-125-6}})</ref> The church recognizes Apostle Peter's leadership role in the [[early church]], especially in the very early days at Jerusalem, but does not consider him to have had any \"princely\" role over his fellow Apostles.\n\nThe New Testament is not seen by the Orthodox as supporting any extraordinary authority for Peter with regard to faith or morals. The Orthodox also hold that Peter did not act as leader at the [[Council of Jerusalem]], but as merely one of a number who spoke. The final decision regarding the non-necessity of [[circumcision]] (and certain prohibitions) was spelled out by [[James, the Brother of the Lord]] (though Catholics hold James merely reiterated and fleshed out what Peter had said, regarding the latter's earlier divine revelation regarding the inclusion of Gentiles).\n\nEastern and Oriental Orthodox do not recognize the Bishop of Rome as the successor of St. Peter but the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul. In the [[declaration of Ravenna|Ravenna Document]] of 13 October 2007, the representatives of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] agreed that \"Rome, as the Church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St. Ignatius of Antioch (\"To the Romans\", Prologue), occupied the first place in the ''taxis'', and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the ''protos'' among the patriarchs, if the Papacy unites with the Orthodox Church. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the bishop of Rome as ''protos'', a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium.\"\n\nWith regard to Jesus' words to Peter, \"Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church\", the Orthodox hold Christ is referring to the confession of faith, ''not'' the person of Peter as that upon which he will build the church. This is allegedly shown by the fact that the original Greek uses the feminine demonstrative pronoun when he says \"upon this rock\" (\u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u1fc3 \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u1fb3); whereas, grammatically, if he had been referring to Peter, he would allegedly have used the masculine.<ref>Holy Apostles Convent (1999) ''The Orthodox New Testament'', Vol. I: The Holy Gospels (Dormition Skete, Buena Vista CO, {{ISBN|0-944359-13-2}}) p. 105</ref> This \"gender distinction\" argument is also held by some Protestants.\n\n===Syriac Orthodox Church===\n[[File:Antonio de Bellis - La liberazione di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Saint Peter and the angel'', by [[Antonio de Bellis]] ]] \nThe Fathers of the Syriac Orthodox Church tried to give a theological interpretation to the primacy of Apostle Peter. They were fully convinced of the unique office of Peter in the primitive Christian community. [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]], [[Aphrahat]] and [[Maruthas]] who were supposed to have been the best exponents of the early [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac tradition]] unequivocally acknowledge the office of Peter.\n\nThe Syriac Fathers, following the rabbinic tradition, call Jesus \"Kepha\" for they see \"rock\" in the Old Testament as a messianic Symbol (yet the Old Maronite Syriacs of Lebanon still refer to Saint Peter as \"Saint Simon the Generous\" or Simon Karam\"). When Christ gave his own name \"Kepha\" to Simon he was giving him participation in the person and office of Christ. Christ who is the Kepha and shepherd made Simon the chief shepherd in his place and gave him the very name Kepha and said that on Kepha he would build the Church. [[Aphrahat]] shared the common Syriac tradition. For him Kepha is in fact another name of Jesus, and Simon was given the right to share the name. The person who receives somebody else's name also obtains the rights of the person who bestows the name. Aphrahat makes the stone taken from Jordan a type of Peter. He wrote: \"Jesus son of Nun set up the stones for a witness in Israel; Jesus our Saviour called Simon Kepha Sarirto and set him as the faithful witness among nations.\"\n\nAgain he wrote in his commentary on [[Deuteronomy]] that [[Moses]] brought forth water from \"rock\" (Kepha) for the people and Jesus sent Simon Kepha to carry his teachings among nations. God accepted him and made him the foundation of the Church and called him Kepha. When he speaks about the transfiguration of Christ he calls him [[Simon Peter]], the foundation of the Church. Ephrem also shared the same view. The Armenian version of [[De Virginitate]] records that [[Peter the rock]] shunned honour. A ''mimro'' of Efrem found in Holy Week Liturgy points to the importance of Peter.\n\nBoth [[Aphrahat]] and [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]] represent the authentic tradition of the Syrian Church. The different orders of liturgies used for sanctification of Church buildings, marriage, ordination, ''et cetera'', reveal that the primacy of Peter is a part of living faith of the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syrianchurch.org/Articles/PrimacyofStPeter.htm |title=\"Primacy of St. Peter\" \u2013 by Dr. Thomas Athanasius |publisher=Syrianchurch.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>\n\n===New Apostolic Church===\nThe [[New Apostolic Church]], which believes in the re-established Apostle ministry, sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]].\n\n===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===\n[[File:Saint Peter by Gr\u00e3o Vasco.jpg|thumb|''Saint Peter'' by [[Gr\u00e3o Vasco|Vasco Fernandes]], 1506]]\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] teaches that Peter was the first leader of the early Christian church after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Both demonstrate a high quality of cultured and urban Greek, at odds with the linguistic skill that would ordinarily be expected of an [[Aramaic]]-speaking fisherman, who would have learned Greek as a second or third language.

Wallace]] (who maintains that Peter was the author) writes that, for many scholars, \"the issue of authorship is already settled, at least negatively: the apostle Peter did not write this letter\" and that \"the vast bulk of NT scholars adopts this perspective without much discussion\". However, he later states, \"Although a very strong case has been made against Petrine authorship of 2 Peter, we believe it is deficient. ...Taken together, these external and internal arguments strongly suggest the traditional view, viz., that Peter was indeed the author of the second epistle which bears his name.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20031209164253/http://www.bible.org/docs/soapbox/2petotl.htm ''Second Peter: Introduction, Argument, and Outline''].

The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] and the biographer [[Suetonius]] do both record that Nero persecuted Christians, and Tacitus dates this to immediately after the fire that burned Rome in 64. Christian tradition, for example Eusebius of Caesarea (''History'' book 2, 24.1), has maintained that Peter was killed in Nero's persecution, and thus had to assume that the Roman persecution alluded to in First Peter must be this Neronian persecution.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> On the other hand, many modern scholars argue that First Peter refers to the persecution of Christians in Asia Minor during the reign of the emperor [[Domitian]] (81\u201396), as the letter is explicitly addressed to Jewish Christians from that region:\n\n{{quote|Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to God's elect, strangers in the world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance.{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|1:1\u20132}}}}\n\nThose scholars who believe that the epistle dates from the time of Domitian argue that Nero's persecution of Christians was confined to the city of Rome itself, and did not extend to the Asian provinces mentioned in 1 Pet 1:1\u20132.\n \nThe [[Second Epistle of Peter]], on the other hand, appears to have been copied, in part, from the [[Epistle of Jude]], and some modern scholars date its composition as late as ''c.'' 150. Some scholars argue the opposite, that the Epistle of Jude copied Second Peter, while others contend an early date for Jude and thus observe that an early date is not incompatible with the text.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> Many scholars have noted the similarities between the [[apocrypha]]l [[Second Epistle of Clement]] (2nd century) and Second Peter. Second Peter may be earlier than 150; there are a few possible references to it that date back to the 1st century or early 2nd century, e.g., [[1 Clement]] written in ''c.'' AD 96, and the later church historian Eusebius wrote that [[Origen]] had made reference to the epistle before 250.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Eusebius|title=Church History Book VI, Chapter 25|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nJerome says that Peter \"wrote two epistles which are called Catholic, the second of which, on account of its difference from the first in style, is considered by many not to be by him\"''(De Viris Illustribus 1).''<ref>{{cite web|last1=saint|first1=Jerome|title=De Viris Illustribus (On Illustrious Men) Chapter 1|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> But he himself received the epistle, and explained the difference in style, character, and structure of words by the assumption that Peter used different interpreters in the composition of the two epistles;<ref name=\"Jerome\" /> and from his time onward the epistle was generally regarded as a part of the New Testament.\n\nEven in early times there was controversy over its authorship, and Second Peter was often not included in the [[biblical canon]]; it was only in the 4th century that it gained a firm foothold in the New Testament, in a series of synods. In the East the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] still did not admit it into the canon until the 6th century.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/>\n\n====Mark====\nTraditionally, the [[Gospel of Mark#Authorship and sources|Gospel of Mark]] was said to have been written by a person named [[John Mark]], and that this person was an assistant to Peter; hence its content was traditionally seen as the closest to Peter's viewpoint. According to Eusebius' ''Ecclesiastical History'', [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] recorded this belief from [[John the Presbyter]]:\n\n{{quote|Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a normal or chronological narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictional into the statements.<ref>Eusebius,'' Ecclesiastical History'', 3.39.14\u201316</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nClement of Alexandria in the fragments of his work ''Hypotyposes'' (A.D. 190) preserved and cited by the historian Eusebius in his ''Church History'' (VI, 14: 6) writes that:\n\n{{quote|As Peter had preached the Word publicly at Rome, and declared the Gospel by the Spirit, many who were present requested that [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], who had followed him for a long time and remembered his sayings, should write them out. And having composed the Gospel he gave it to those who had requested it.<ref name=\"CL\" />}}\n\nAlso Irenaeus wrote about this tradition:\n\n{{quote|After their (Peter and Paul's) passing, Mark also, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, transmitted to us in writing the things preached by Peter.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III. 1.2.; quoted by Eusebius in ''Ecclesiastical History'', book 5, 7.6</ref>}}\n\nBased on these quotes, and on the Christian tradition, the information in Mark's gospel about Peter would be based on eyewitness material.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> The gospel itself is [[Anonymous work|anonymous]], and the above passages are the oldest surviving written testimony to its authorship.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/>\n\n===Pseudepigrapha and apocrypha===\n[[File:Muenster-100725-15996-\u00dcberwasserkirche-Schl\u00fcssel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|The [[Key (lock)|key]] as symbol of St. Peter]]\nThere are also a number of other [[apocrypha]]l writings, that have been either attributed to or written about Peter.

The account is similar to that of the canonical gospels, especially the [[Gospel of Mark]]. It is unclear whether the fragment is an abridged version of the accounts in the [[synoptic gospels]], or a source text on which they were based, perhaps the apocryphal Gospel of Peter.<ref>''Das Evangelium nach Petrus.

He thus contrasts with [[Paul the Apostle]] who is bald except at the sides, with a longer beard and often black hair, and thinner in the face. One exception to this is in [[Anglo-Saxon art]], where he typically lacks a beard. Both Peter and Paul are shown thus as early as the 4th century [[Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter]] in Rome.<ref>Higgitt, John, \"The Iconography of Saint Peter in Anglo-Saxon England, and Saint Cuthbert's Coffin\", pp. 267\u2013272, 270 quoted, in: Bonner, Gerald, Rollason, David & Stancliffe, Clare, eds., ''St. Cuthbert, his Cult and his Community to AD 1200''.

By the 15th century Peter is more likely to be bald on the top of his head in the Western church, but he continues to have a good head of hair in Orthodox icons.\n\nThe depiction of Saint Peter as literally the keeper of the gates of heaven, popular with modern cartoonists, is not found in traditional religious art, but Peter usually heads groups of saints flanking God in heaven, on the right hand side (viewer's left) of God. Narrative images of Peter include several scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' where he is mentioned in the gospels, and he is often identifiable in scenes where his presence is not specifically mentioned. Usually he stands nearest to Christ. In particular, depictions of the ''[[Arrest of Christ]]'' usually include Peter cutting off the ear of one of the soldiers. Scenes without Jesus include his distinctive martyrdom, his rescue from prison, and sometimes his trial. In the [[Counter-Reformation]] scenes of Peter hearing the cock crow for the third time became popular, as a representation of [[repentance]] and hence the Catholic [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (sacrament)|Confession]] or Reconciliation.\n\n==Patronage==\n<!-- This section is linked from the Christian leader infobox at top -->\n[[File:Peter in Chora.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Medieval mosaic of Saint Peter in the [[Chora Church]], Istanbul]]\n[[File:Ancient icon of sts peter & paul.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Icon of Saint Peter and Paul]]\n[[File:Llanbeblig Hours (f. 2v.)

Her life was characterised by the political crises surrounding the [[Italian Wars]]. Isabella often found herself torn between her native [[Kingdom of Naples]] and her marital home of the [[Duchy of Milan]], causing her to suffer personal and political difficulties.  After a difficult marriage and lack of support in Milan, she received the Duchy of Bari. This change in circumstances gave Isabella the opportunity to form her own court as well as build up political support and security against the ongoing wars. These reforms along with her interest in arts and literature, resulted in Bari undergoing revival and refurbishment. During this period, she also concentrated on the education of her daughter [[Bona Sforza|Bona]], who became [[List of Polish consorts|Queen of Poland]].\n\n==Life==\n===Childhood and Family===\nIsabella was born in the Kingdom of Naples, during the reign of her paternal grandfather [[Ferdinand I of Naples]]. She was the daughter of his heir, [[Alfonso II of Naples|Prince Alfonso]] and his first wife, [[Ippolita Maria Sforza]]. During her childhood, Isabella's parents had a rough relationship, which was characterised by rivalry and contempt. Alfonso, perhaps threatened by Ippolita's high level of education or disdainful of her pedigree, treated his wife with a lack of respect throughout the marriage.<ref>Tribble, 'A Trusting Partnership: Sentiment and Politics in Quattrocento Dynastic Unions'</ref> Alfonso preferred the company of his mistress, Trogia Gazzela, by whom he had two illegitimate children during Isabella's childhood. Her grandfather was a courageous ruler, who did not hold back when it came to dealing with his enemies. Being raised at this ruthless court in Naples certainly would have had an effect on Isabella, affecting her character as an adult.<ref name=\"Lev\">''The Tigerless Foli</ref>\n\nIsabella was the only daughter from the marriage, though she had two brothers: the elder was [[Ferdinand II of Naples|Prince Ferdinand]], who would succeed their father to throne in 1495 and the younger was Piero, who was Lieutenant General of Apulia, but died young of an infection following leg surgery. The siblings were raised alongside their cousins, the children of [[Eleanor of Naples, Duchess of Ferrara|Eleanor of Naples]], who included [[Isabella d'Este|Isabella]] and [[Beatrice d'Este]]. Isabella had a particularly close relationship with the latter, developing into something of a sisterhood.<ref>Leonie Frieda, ''The Deadly Sisterhood: A story of Women, Power and Intrigue in the Italian Renaissance'' (Hachette UK: 2012)</ref> When the children were just adolescents, Ippolita died.\n\n===Wedding===\n[[Image:Female bust (An ideal portrait of Laura) by Francesco Laurana.JPG|thumb|Marble bust of Isabella by [[Francesco Laurana]] (c.1490).<ref>Mona Lisa Foundation, p.55</ref> [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], [[Vienna]]]]  \nIsabella's destiny was not to be in the Kingdom of Naples but in the [[Duchy of Milan]]. A marriage was arranged for her to a [[first cousin]] on her mother's side, [[Gian Galeazzo Sforza]]. On 1 May 1480, when Isabella was nine years of age, her betrothal was celebrated within the Duchy.<ref>Jane Black, 'The Duchy of Milan in Contemporary Historical Writing, ca 1400-1540', in Christian Thorsten Callisen (ed.) ''Reading and Writing History from Bruni to Windschuttle: Essays in Honour of Gary Ianziti'' (Routledge: 2016)</ref> It would not be until nine years later that the planned wedding took place. On 26 December 1488, the eighteen-year-old Isabella left her childhood home by sea for [[Genoa]] and from there, she travelled to Milan to join her husband.<ref>Capasso, B. (ed.) \u00b4Le chronache de li antique ri del regno di Napoli di D. Gaspare Fuscolillo\u00b4, ''Archivio storico per le province Napoletane, Anno Primo, Fascicolo I'' (Naples, 1876) (\"Gaspare Fuscolillo\"), I, p.57</ref> The couple officially married on 2 February 1489.\n\nGreat celebrations followed the marriage. A masque or operetta was held, it was entitled ''Il Paradiso'', with words by [[Bernardo Bellincioni]] and sets and costumes by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].<ref>Charles Nicholl, ''Leonardo Da Vinci: The Flights of the Mind'' (Penguin, 2005)</ref> Isabella was praised for her beauty, the Ferrarese ambassador commented: ''\"she was so beautiful and radiant that she seemed like the sun\"''.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> The operetta was written very much with this praise for Isabella in mind. ''Il Paradiso'' was the representation of the seven planets orbiting round. A man portrayed each of the planets and all would speak praise of Isabella.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> Therefore, the operetta depicted Isabella as being at the centre of the universe. In addition to the acknowledgment of her physical appearance, Isabella was also noted for having an energetic personality.\n\nThe bridegroom was quite a contrast to his wife; Gian Galeazzo was pale, studious and melancholy.<ref>Nicholl, ''Leonardo Da Vinci''</ref> The differences of personality would certainly affect the marriage as well as in politics during the 1490s.\n\n===Unhappy duchess===\n\nGian Galeazzo had been duke since he was aged seven; due to his youth, his uncle, [[Ludovico Sforza]], had been acting as regent. By the time of the wedding, Ludovico had been in power for almost thirteen years and showed no sign of relinquishing the reins of government to his nephew. He viewed the young couple with suspicion, as potential figureheads for opposition to his position. This was worsened in 1491, when Isabella gave birth to a son and heir [[Francesco Sforza (il Duchetto)|Francesco]]. In order to weaken any coup attempts made by Isabella and her husband, Ludovico had her Neapolitan retinue returned home and restricted the young duchess from appointing and rewarding followers.<ref>Evelyn S. Welch, ''Art and Authority in Renaissance Milan'' (Yale University Press, 1995), p.219</ref>\n\nOne source of comfort to Isabella was the presence of Beatrice, who married Ludovico in 1491. The young cousins socialised regularly: they went hunting, played endless games of ''palla'' and designed dresses that they wished to have made.<ref>Leonie Frieda, ''The Deadly Sisterhood''</ref> Beatrice was regarded as naughtier than Isabella, often persuading her cousin to participate in other activities, such as wandering around the market place dressed in disguise and without a chaperone.<ref>''Ibid''</ref>  \n[[Image:Gian Galeazzo e Ludovico Maria Sforza (La Sforziade).png|thumb|Gian Galeazzo Sforza with his uncle and regent Ludovico Sforza]]\nDespite this early warmth between the cousins, their relationship suffered due to Ludovico's political schemes. The birth of Beatrice's son, [[Maximilian Sforza|Maximilian]], was greeted by great pomp and ceremony, befitting an heir, something that had been denied to Isabella's son.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> In addition, Leonardo da Vinci was active in creating pageants and decorations in honour of Beatrice, despite the fact that she was not the highest ranking woman at the Milanese court. Beatrice was even given a political role, acting as ducal ambassador to Venice in 1492.\n<ref>Elizabeth Lev, ''Tigress of Forli''</ref> In contrast, Isabella and her growing family were starved of household funds and she was forced to make petitions for allowance increases.<ref>Evelyn S. Wlch, ''Art and Authority in Renaissance Milan'', p.219</ref> It is of little surprise that she wrote to her father, asking him to intervene on her behalf.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> Ludovico used the Neapolitan connection to his advantage, portraying Isabella as working in the interests of her Neapolitan family or indeed in her own desire to dominate her husband and obtain power in Milan.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> In the same year that Beatrice travelled to Venice, Isabella was accused of attempting to poison [[Galeazzo da San Severino]], her husband's favourite courtier and Ludovico's captain.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> As Gian Galeazzo was malleable to the scheming of his uncle, he did not defend his wife and so the scandal placed relations with Isabella under enormous pressure.<ref>''Translation from equivalent article in Polish''</ref>\n\n[[File:Giovanni Bilivert.- Isabelle d'Aragon implorant Charles VIII, Naples, 1494.png|thumb|left|Isabella pleads before King Charles]]\n\nLudovico was now openly pursuing his ambition for absolute control over Milan. An important aspect of this was foreign policy, and his anti-Aragonese policy was far from favourable to Isabella or her Neapolitan family. In response to Ludovico's actions, Isabella's father had encouraged French ambitions over Milan. Understanding the weight of this threat, Ludovico severed diplomatic ties with the Neapolitan court and built an alliance with [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. The reason for this particular alliance was that the Emperor had the power to grant the Dukedom to Ludovico.<ref>Evelyn S. Wlch, ''Art and Authority in Renaissance Milan'', p.219</ref> Meanwhile, Isabella found herself confined to [[Castello Visconteo (Pavia)|Castello Visconteo]] in [[Pavia]], the disputed duchess was essentially a prisoner.<ref>Charles Nicholl, ''Leonardo Da Vinci: The Flights of the Mind''</ref>\n\nLudovico encouraged [[Charles VIII of France]] to attack Naples and remove the threat of Isabella's father. When the French King arrived in the Duchy of Milan in October 1494, on his way to Naples, he was well-received by Ludovico and Beatrice.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> Around this time, Isabella made a move and appealed to Charles. She tearfully pleaded for the King to have mercy on her father; Charles was embarrassed by Isabella's actions but he did have sympathy for her husband, who was dying.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> Isabella's pleading was in vain, the [[Italian Wars]] were underway and her father would be ousted from his throne by the French in 1495. In his infamous work ''[[The Prince]]'', [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] blamed Ludovico for the devastation, claiming that it was down to him inviting the French to attack Naples.<ref>Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, ''The Prince'' (Penguin Books, 2011)</ref>\n\n===Widowhood===\n[[File:Isabella of Aragon.jpg|thumb|Purported painting of Isabella as the Virgin by [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]]]]\nWhen Isabella appealed to the French King, the historian [[Philippe de Commines]] had been a part of his retinue. He had the following to say about her actions: \"She had better have prayed for herself, who was still a young and fair lady.\"<ref>Charles Nicholl, ''Leonardo Da Vinci: The Flights of the Mind''</ref> This quote has particular relevance when observing that the fall of Naples was not the only tragedy to befall her at this time. The sickly Gian Galeazzo died on 21 October 1494, in the confinement that he shared with Isabella in Pavia. Until the end, he was completely in his uncle's thrall.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> The couple had been married for just five years and like the marriage of Isabella's parents, theirs had been a difficult one. Gian Galeazzo appeared to have no interest in exerting his authority in Milan nor did he support his wife when she became the target of Ludovico's schemes.\n\nThe aftermath of this loss led to another problem. Having built up his support base over the years, Ludovico could easily bypass the claims of Isabella's son and obtain the dukedom which he had been the [[de facto]] ruler of for eighteen years. Isabella was at a low point; Ludovico may have allowed her to live in the ducal apartment with all her honours intact, but she had lost the father of her children, her Neapolitan family support had been destroyed by the French and her son had been denied his birthright.<ref>''Translation from Italian Wikipedia article on her son''</ref>\n\nDuring the remaining years of the 1490s, Isabella and her children were under the watchful eye of Ludovico at [[Sforza Castle]]. Further deaths followed. In 1496, Isabella's brother Ferdinand died, this made her the heir of the Brienne claim to the title [[King of Jerusalem]]. In 1497, Beatrice, Isabella's one-time friend and rival died in childbirth, aged twenty-one. This was only the beginning of Ludovico's misfortunes. Two years later, he was toppled from power by [[Louis XII of France]]. However, any satisfaction that Isabella could have gained from witnessing the downfall of her rival was minimised. Isabella petitioned Louis to name her son the Duke of Bari, a title that belonged to the Milanese family.<ref>Leonie Frieda, ''The Deadly Sisterhood''</ref> Louis responded by taking the young boy to France, assuring Isabella that he planned to marry him with his daughter. In reality, Louis deceived Isabella by placing Francesco in a monastery.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> She refused to give up hope for her son's return and petitioned Emperor Maximilian to liberate him from France. However, this effort proved fruitless.<ref>Leonie Frieda, ''The Deadly Sisterhood''</ref> She never saw her son again.<ref>Desmond Seward and Susan Mountgarret, ''Old Puglia: A Cultural Companion to South-Eastern Italy'' (Haus Publishing, 2016)</ref> This, along with the destruction of her family in Naples, led to Isabella developing a hatred for the French.<ref>''Ibid''</ref>\n\nHaving unsuccessfully petitioned Louis and fearing for her safety in Milan, Isabella left for Naples, where her uncle [[Frederick of Naples|Frederick]] had succeeded her childless brother as king.<ref>Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, p.397</ref><ref>Leonie Frieda, <nowiki>''Deadly Sisterhood''</nowiki>, Chapter 19</ref> She took Bona and Ippolita with her. However, the situation was not safe, Louis was determined to once again press the French claim on Naples. The representatives of Louis XII and those of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella of Castile]] signed a  secret treaty in [[Granada]] on November 11, 1500.<ref>Frederic J. Baumgartner, ''Louis XII'', p. 122</ref> The French and Aragonese sovereigns agreed to attack Naples, conquer it and immediately divide it between themselves. Louis XII would receive Naples, Terra di Lavoro and Abruzzo and the titles of King of Jerusalem and King of Naples; Jerusalem was Isabella's by right.\n\nReflecting upon the tragedies that had befallen her, Isabella began signing herself off in letters as ''Isabella, unique in misfortune''.<ref>''Ibid''</ref>\n\n===Duchess of Bari===\n[[Image:Bari, castello 02.jpg|thumb|[[Castello Normanno-Svevo (Bari)|Castello Normanno-Svevo]], Isabella's residence during her tenure as Duchess of Bari]]\nAfter the collapse of the Sforzas in Milan and her family in Naples, Isabella was granted the title of ''[[suo jure]]'' Duchess of [[Bari]], Princess of [[Rossano]] and Lady of [[Ostuni]], which Louis had denied to her son.<ref>Mona Lisa Foundation, ''Mona Lisa: Leonardo's Earlier Version'' (The Mona Lisa Foundation, 2012), p.55</ref> She ruled there from 1500 until her death twenty-four years later. Ironically, Isabella now appeared as a usurper herself as Bari should have passed to Maximilian, the son of Ludovico and Beatrice.<ref>Leonie Frieda, ''The Deadly Sisterhood''</ref> Her acquisition of the Duchy appears to be a form of compensation for her previous struggles.\n\nIsabella's life in Bari was one of splendour.<ref>Desmond Seward and Susan Mountgarret, ''Old Puglia: A Cultural Companion to South-Eastern Italy''</ref> She lived in [[Castello Normanno-Svevo (Bari)|Castello Normanno-Svevo]] and spent her spare time working on music and literature. She summoned the writer [[Amedeo Cornale]] to her court, which witnessed the printing of Bari's first book.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> Her administration greatly benefited the Duchy, which entered into a period of revival, refurbishment and cultural florescence, which it had not enjoyed under the earlier administration of Isabella's Aragonese relatives.<ref>Christopher Kleinhenz, ''Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia'' (Routledge, 2004), p.96</ref>\n\nKeeping in mind her previous life experiences, Isabella made it her priority to enhance the castle's defences, ensuring that it was up to date with the form of warfare that had harmed Milan and Naples.<ref>Leonie Frieda, ''The Deadly Sisterhood''</ref> This emphasis on security turned out to be well placed. In July 1502, [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]] distributed a small portion of his forces to Bari, under Isabella's protection. This led to the French considering an attack on Isabella's Duchy, some argued it would be an advantageous way of conducting war against the Spanish.<ref>William Hickling Prescott, ''History of the Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic'', Volume 3, Issue 2, (Charles C. Little and James Brown, 1840), p.43</ref> However, this was avoided when ideas of chivalry were taken into consideration.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> Whilst Isabella may have avoided danger on the count of her gender, it was a reminder that her hold on Bari was far from secure and her gender may not always excuse her.\nAside from building up defences, the situation in Milan had taught Isabella that political security was also essential; her will needed to be upheld at all times, never weakened or undermined. Therefore, she introduced more vigorous surveillance of public officials, ensuring that their notorious corruption was combated.<ref>Leonie Frieda, ''The Deadly Sisterhood''</ref>        \n[[File:Bona Sforza in 1517.jpg|thumb|left|Isabella's daughter Bona, depicted here in the year that she married (1517)]]\nAlthough it may appear that Isabella had finally found fortune, these later years were also plagued with family tragedies. In 1501, her elder daughter and namesake of her mother, [[Ippolita Maria Sforza (1493\u20131501)|Ippolita]] died around the age of eight. In 1512, her nephew, [[Rodrigo of Aragon|Rodrigo]], whom Isabella had fostered since 1506, died aged twelve. Eleven years after young Ippolita's death, Francesco followed his sister to the grave. Isabella then dedicated herself to raising her sole surviving child, [[Bona Sforza|Bona]].<ref>Desmond Seward and Susan Mountgarret, ''Old Puglia: A Cultural Companion to South-Eastern Italy''</ref> Under Isabella's direction, Bona received a [[humanism|humanist]] education, which included the teaching of statecraft.<ref>Peter G. Bietenholz & Thomas Brian Deutscher, ''Contemporaries of Erasmus: A Biographical Register of the Renaissance and Reformation, Volumes 1-3, A-Z, Volumes 1-3'' (University of Toronto Press, 2003), p.165</ref> This education prepared Bona for her future role as [[List of Polish consorts|Queen consort of Poland]].\n\nInitially, Isabella desired for Bona to wed her cousin, Maximilian Sforza, in the hope of uniting their two rival branches of the family.<ref>Leonie Frieda, ''The Deadly Sisterhood''</ref> However, Sforza control over the duchy proved too weak at this point and the French took it over once again in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Marignano]] in 1515.\n\nIn the same year, [[Barbara Z\u00e1polya]], wife of [[Sigismund I the Old]] died. The marriage had not produced male issue and so it was expected that the Polish king would remarry. Z\u00e1polya came from an anti-Habsburg family, something Emperor Maximilian was conscious of. In order to eliminate anti-Habsburg sentiments within Poland, the Emperor requested that Sigismund marry a bride selected by him.<ref>Jacqueline Glomski, ''Patronage and Humanist Literature in the Age of the Jagiellons: Court and Career in the Writings of Rudolf Agricola Junior, Valentin Eck, and Leonard Cox'' (University of Toronto Press, 2007), p.186</ref> Bona was on the list of selected candidates. As the other candidates were ruled out for various reasons, Sigismund consented to marrying Bona in the spring of 1517.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> Isabella raised extra taxes in Bari to pay for the wedding.<ref>Leonie Frieda, ''The Deadly Sisterhood''</ref>\n\nLike her mother, Bona was known for her energetic personality; she was not afraid to openly disagree with her husband and acted as a patron to artists.<ref>Peter G. Bietenholz & Thomas Brian Deutscher, ''Contemporaries of Erasmus: A Biographical Register of the Renaissance and Reformation'', p.165</ref> However, unlike Isabella, Bona was able to build up her own political faction in her marital homeland.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> In her final years, Isabella saw her daughter become a mother to four of her six children, amongst them were [[Isabella Jagiellon|Isabella]] and [[Anna of Poland|Anna Jagiellon]]. Not giving up on uniting the rival branches of the Sforza family, Isabella sent envoys to Poland to propose marriage of her granddaughter, the younger Isabella, to [[Francesco II Sforza]], newly installed Duke of Milan.<ref>Ma\u0142gorzata Duczmal, Jogailai\u010diai (in Lithuanian). Translated by Birut\u0117 Mikalonien\u0117 and Vyturys Jarutis. (Vilnius: Mokslo ir enciklopedij\u0173 leidybos centras, 2012) p.206</ref> However, Sigismund refused as the duchy was contested and Francesco's hold was tenuous.\n\n===Death===\nIsabella died in [[Bari]] on 1 February 1524, aged fifty-three. She had been Duchess for twenty-four years and a widow for thirty. The Italian Wars were still ongoing at the time. Her body was returned to Naples and buried in [[San Domenico Maggiore]].<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/154755505/isabella-of_aragon Isabella of Aragon, Find a Grave]</ref> Bona succeeded her in Bari, returning years later as a widow, during the final year of her own life in 1557.\n\nIn 2012, anthropologists excavated the body of Isabella, and concluded that she had syphilis. Her teeth had a high level of mercury, which was used (ineffectively) to treat syphilis, and had given a black color to the tooth enamel, most of which had been removed by abrading. They concluded that she was poisoned by her own medicine. \n<ref name=\"Gibbons\">{{cite journal\n| title =The Thousand-Year Graveyard\n| journal =Science \n| date =13 December 2013\n| author =Ann Gibbons\n| coauthors =\n| volume =342 \n| issue =6164 \n| pages =1306\u20131310\n| url =http://spark.sciencemag.org/the-thousand-year-graveyard/4\n| doi =10.1126/science.342.6164.1306\n| pmid =24337272\n| pmc =\n| doi-access =free\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Fornaciari\">{{cite journal\n| title =The Aragonese mummies of the Basilica of Saint Domenico Maggiore in Naples\n| journal =Med Secoli\n| year =2006\n| author =Fornaciari G.\n| coauthors =\n| volume =18\n| issue =3\n| pages =843\u201364\n| url =\n| doi =\n| pmid =18175625\n| pmc =\n}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nIsabella was first suggested as the subject of da Vinci's ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' in 1979. This presupposes that the painting took place in the 1490s, during da Vinci's Milanese period. However, the painting has officially been dated as later, likely ruling Isabella out as the subject.<ref>The Mona Lisa Foundation, p.55</ref> Additionally, Isabella was never recognised during her lifetime as the subject of the painting.

Her life was characterised by the political crises surrounding the [[Italian Wars]]. Isabella often found herself torn between her native [[Kingdom of Naples]] and her marital home of the [[Duchy of Milan]], causing her to suffer personal and political difficulties.  After a difficult marriage and lack of support in Milan, she received the Duchy of Bari. This change in circumstances gave Isabella the opportunity to form her own court as well as build up political support and security against the ongoing wars. These reforms along with her interest in arts and literature, resulted in Bari undergoing revival and refurbishment. During this period, she also concentrated on the education of her daughter [[Bona Sforza|Bona]], who became [[List of Polish consorts|Queen of Poland]].\n\n==Life==\n===Childhood and Family===\nIsabella was born in the Kingdom of Naples, during the reign of her paternal grandfather [[Ferdinand I of Naples]]. She was the daughter of his heir, [[Alfonso II of Naples|Prince Alfonso]] and his first wife, [[Ippolita Maria Sforza]]. During her childhood, Isabella's parents had a rough relationship, which was characterised by rivalry and contempt. Alfonso, perhaps threatened by Ippolita's high level of education or disdainful of her pedigree, treated his wife with a lack of respect throughout the marriage.<ref>Tribble, 'A Trusting Partnership: Sentiment and Politics in Quattrocento Dynastic Unions'</ref> Alfonso preferred the company of his mistress, Trogia Gazzela, by whom he had two illegitimate children during Isabella's childhood. Her grandfather was a courageous ruler, who did not hold back when it came to dealing with his enemies. Being raised at this ruthless court in Naples certainly would have had an effect on Isabella, affecting her character as an adult.<ref name=\"Lev\">''The Tigerless Foli</ref>\n\nIsabella was the only daughter from the marriage, though she had two brothers: the elder was [[Ferdinand II of Naples|Prince Ferdinand]], who would succeed their father to throne in 1495 and the younger was Piero, who was Lieutenant General of Apulia, but died young of an infection following leg surgery. The siblings were raised alongside their cousins, the children of [[Eleanor of Naples, Duchess of Ferrara|Eleanor of Naples]], who included [[Isabella d'Este|Isabella]] and [[Beatrice d'Este]]. Isabella had a particularly close relationship with the latter, developing into something of a sisterhood.<ref>Leonie Frieda, ''The Deadly Sisterhood: A story of Women, Power and Intrigue in the Italian Renaissance'' (Hachette UK: 2012)</ref> When the children were just adolescents, Ippolita died.\n\n===Wedding===\n[[Image:Female bust (An ideal portrait of Laura) by Francesco Laurana.JPG|thumb|Marble bust of Isabella by [[Francesco Laurana]] (c.1490).<ref>Mona Lisa Foundation, p.55</ref> [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], [[Vienna]]]]  \nIsabella's destiny was not to be in the Kingdom of Naples but in the [[Duchy of Milan]]. A marriage was arranged for her to a [[first cousin]] on her mother's side, [[Gian Galeazzo Sforza]]. On 1 May 1480, when Isabella was nine years of age, her betrothal was celebrated within the Duchy.<ref>Jane Black, 'The Duchy of Milan in Contemporary Historical Writing, ca 1400-1540', in Christian Thorsten Callisen (ed.) ''Reading and Writing History from Bruni to Windschuttle: Essays in Honour of Gary Ianziti'' (Routledge: 2016)</ref> It would not be until nine years later that the planned wedding took place. On 26 December 1488, the eighteen-year-old Isabella left her childhood home by sea for [[Genoa]] and from there, she travelled to Milan to join her husband.<ref>Capasso, B. (ed.) \u00b4Le chronache de li antique ri del regno di Napoli di D. Gaspare Fuscolillo\u00b4, ''Archivio storico per le province Napoletane, Anno Primo, Fascicolo I'' (Naples, 1876) (\"Gaspare Fuscolillo\"), I, p.57</ref> The couple officially married on 2 February 1489.\n\nGreat celebrations followed the marriage. A masque or operetta was held, it was entitled ''Il Paradiso'', with words by [[Bernardo Bellincioni]] and sets and costumes by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].<ref>Charles Nicholl, ''Leonardo Da Vinci: The Flights of the Mind'' (Penguin, 2005)</ref> Isabella was praised for her beauty, the Ferrarese ambassador commented: ''\"she was so beautiful and radiant that she seemed like the sun\"''.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> The operetta was written very much with this praise for Isabella in mind. ''Il Paradiso'' was the representation of the seven planets orbiting round. A man portrayed each of the planets and all would speak praise of Isabella.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> Therefore, the operetta depicted Isabella as being at the centre of the universe. In addition to the acknowledgment of her physical appearance, Isabella was also noted for having an energetic personality.\n\nThe bridegroom was quite a contrast to his wife; Gian Galeazzo was pale, studious and melancholy.<ref>Nicholl, ''Leonardo Da Vinci''</ref> The differences of personality would certainly affect the marriage as well as in politics during the 1490s.\n\n===Unhappy duchess===\n\nGian Galeazzo had been duke since he was aged seven; due to his youth, his uncle, [[Ludovico Sforza]], had been acting as regent. By the time of the wedding, Ludovico had been in power for almost thirteen years and showed no sign of relinquishing the reins of government to his nephew. He viewed the young couple with suspicion, as potential figureheads for opposition to his position. This was worsened in 1491, when Isabella gave birth to a son and heir [[Francesco Sforza (il Duchetto)|Francesco]]. In order to weaken any coup attempts made by Isabella and her husband, Ludovico had her Neapolitan retinue returned home and restricted the young duchess from appointing and rewarding followers.<ref>Evelyn S. Welch, ''Art and Authority in Renaissance Milan'' (Yale University Press, 1995), p.219</ref>\n\nOne source of comfort to Isabella was the presence of Beatrice, who married Ludovico in 1491. The young cousins socialised regularly: they went hunting, played endless games of ''palla'' and designed dresses that they wished to have made.<ref>Leonie Frieda, ''The Deadly Sisterhood''</ref> Beatrice was regarded as naughtier than Isabella, often persuading her cousin to participate in other activities, such as wandering around the market place dressed in disguise and without a chaperone.<ref>''Ibid''</ref>  \n[[Image:Gian Galeazzo e Ludovico Maria Sforza (La Sforziade).png|thumb|Gian Galeazzo Sforza with his uncle and regent Ludovico Sforza]]\nDespite this early warmth between the cousins, their relationship suffered due to Ludovico's political schemes. The birth of Beatrice's son, [[Maximilian Sforza|Maximilian]], was greeted by great pomp and ceremony, befitting an heir, something that had been denied to Isabella's son.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> In addition, Leonardo da Vinci was active in creating pageants and decorations in honour of Beatrice, despite the fact that she was not the highest ranking woman at the Milanese court. Beatrice was even given a political role, acting as ducal ambassador to Venice in 1492.\n<ref>Elizabeth Lev, ''Tigress of Forli''</ref> In contrast, Isabella and her growing family were starved of household funds and she was forced to make petitions for allowance increases.<ref>Evelyn S. Wlch, ''Art and Authority in Renaissance Milan'', p.219</ref> It is of little surprise that she wrote to her father, asking him to intervene on her behalf.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> Ludovico used the Neapolitan connection to his advantage, portraying Isabella as working in the interests of her Neapolitan family or indeed in her own desire to dominate her husband and obtain power in Milan.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> In the same year that Beatrice travelled to Venice, Isabella was accused of attempting to poison [[Galeazzo da San Severino]], her husband's favourite courtier and Ludovico's captain.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> As Gian Galeazzo was malleable to the scheming of his uncle, he did not defend his wife and so the scandal placed relations with Isabella under enormous pressure.<ref>''Translation from equivalent article in Polish''</ref>\n\n[[File:Giovanni Bilivert.- Isabelle d'Aragon implorant Charles VIII, Naples, 1494.png|thumb|left|Isabella pleads before King Charles]]\n\nLudovico was now openly pursuing his ambition for absolute control over Milan. An important aspect of this was foreign policy, and his anti-Aragonese policy was far from favourable to Isabella or her Neapolitan family. In response to Ludovico's actions, Isabella's father had encouraged French ambitions over Milan. Understanding the weight of this threat, Ludovico severed diplomatic ties with the Neapolitan court and built an alliance with [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. The reason for this particular alliance was that the Emperor had the power to grant the Dukedom to Ludovico.<ref>Evelyn S. Wlch, ''Art and Authority in Renaissance Milan'', p.219</ref> Meanwhile, Isabella found herself confined to [[Castello Visconteo (Pavia)|Castello Visconteo]] in [[Pavia]], the disputed duchess was essentially a prisoner.<ref>Charles Nicholl, ''Leonardo Da Vinci: The Flights of the Mind''</ref>\n\nLudovico encouraged [[Charles VIII of France]] to attack Naples and remove the threat of Isabella's father. When the French King arrived in the Duchy of Milan in October 1494, on his way to Naples, he was well-received by Ludovico and Beatrice.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> Around this time, Isabella made a move and appealed to Charles. She tearfully pleaded for the King to have mercy on her father; Charles was embarrassed by Isabella's actions but he did have sympathy for her husband, who was dying.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> Isabella's pleading was in vain, the [[Italian Wars]] were underway and her father would be ousted from his throne by the French in 1495. In his infamous work ''[[The Prince]]'', [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] blamed Ludovico for the devastation, claiming that it was down to him inviting the French to attack Naples.<ref>Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, ''The Prince'' (Penguin Books, 2011)</ref>\n\n===Widowhood===\n[[File:Isabella of Aragon.jpg|thumb|Purported painting of Isabella as the Virgin by [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]]]]\nWhen Isabella appealed to the French King, the historian [[Philippe de Commines]] had been a part of his retinue. He had the following to say about her actions: \"She had better have prayed for herself, who was still a young and fair lady.\"<ref>Charles Nicholl, ''Leonardo Da Vinci: The Flights of the Mind''</ref> This quote has particular relevance when observing that the fall of Naples was not the only tragedy to befall her at this time. The sickly Gian Galeazzo died on 21 October 1494, in the confinement that he shared with Isabella in Pavia. Until the end, he was completely in his uncle's thrall.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> The couple had been married for just five years and like the marriage of Isabella's parents, theirs had been a difficult one. Gian Galeazzo appeared to have no interest in exerting his authority in Milan nor did he support his wife when she became the target of Ludovico's schemes.\n\nThe aftermath of this loss led to another problem. Having built up his support base over the years, Ludovico could easily bypass the claims of Isabella's son and obtain the dukedom which he had been the [[de facto]] ruler of for eighteen years. Isabella was at a low point; Ludovico may have allowed her to live in the ducal apartment with all her honours intact, but she had lost the father of her children, her Neapolitan family support had been destroyed by the French and her son had been denied his birthright.<ref>''Translation from Italian Wikipedia article on her son''</ref>\n\nDuring the remaining years of the 1490s, Isabella and her children were under the watchful eye of Ludovico at [[Sforza Castle]]. Further deaths followed. In 1496, Isabella's brother Ferdinand died, this made her the heir of the Brienne claim to the title [[King of Jerusalem]]. In 1497, Beatrice, Isabella's one-time friend and rival died in childbirth, aged twenty-one. This was only the beginning of Ludovico's misfortunes. Two years later, he was toppled from power by [[Louis XII of France]]. However, any satisfaction that Isabella could have gained from witnessing the downfall of her rival was minimised. Isabella petitioned Louis to name her son the Duke of Bari, a title that belonged to the Milanese family.<ref>Leonie Frieda, ''The Deadly Sisterhood''</ref> Louis responded by taking the young boy to France, assuring Isabella that he planned to marry him with his daughter. In reality, Louis deceived Isabella by placing Francesco in a monastery.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> She refused to give up hope for her son's return and petitioned Emperor Maximilian to liberate him from France. However, this effort proved fruitless.<ref>Leonie Frieda, ''The Deadly Sisterhood''</ref> She never saw her son again.<ref>Desmond Seward and Susan Mountgarret, ''Old Puglia: A Cultural Companion to South-Eastern Italy'' (Haus Publishing, 2016)</ref> This, along with the destruction of her family in Naples, led to Isabella developing a hatred for the French.<ref>''Ibid''</ref>\n\nHaving unsuccessfully petitioned Louis and fearing for her safety in Milan, Isabella left for Naples, where her uncle [[Frederick of Naples|Frederick]] had succeeded her childless brother as king.<ref>Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, p.397</ref><ref>Leonie Frieda, <nowiki>''Deadly Sisterhood''</nowiki>, Chapter 19</ref> She took Bona and Ippolita with her. However, the situation was not safe, Louis was determined to once again press the French claim on Naples. The representatives of Louis XII and those of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella of Castile]] signed a  secret treaty in [[Granada]] on November 11, 1500.<ref>Frederic J. Baumgartner, ''Louis XII'', p. 122</ref> The French and Aragonese sovereigns agreed to attack Naples, conquer it and immediately divide it between themselves. Louis XII would receive Naples, Terra di Lavoro and Abruzzo and the titles of King of Jerusalem and King of Naples; Jerusalem was Isabella's by right.\n\nReflecting upon the tragedies that had befallen her, Isabella began signing herself off in letters as ''Isabella, unique in misfortune''.<ref>''Ibid''</ref>\n\n===Duchess of Bari===\n[[Image:Bari, castello 02.jpg|thumb|[[Castello Normanno-Svevo (Bari)|Castello Normanno-Svevo]], Isabella's residence during her tenure as Duchess of Bari]]\nAfter the collapse of the Sforzas in Milan and her family in Naples, Isabella was granted the title of ''[[suo jure]]'' Duchess of [[Bari]], Princess of [[Rossano]] and Lady of [[Ostuni]], which Louis had denied to her son.<ref>Mona Lisa Foundation, ''Mona Lisa: Leonardo's Earlier Version'' (The Mona Lisa Foundation, 2012), p.55</ref> She ruled there from 1500 until her death twenty-four years later. Ironically, Isabella now appeared as a usurper herself as Bari should have passed to Maximilian, the son of Ludovico and Beatrice.<ref>Leonie Frieda, ''The Deadly Sisterhood''</ref> Her acquisition of the Duchy appears to be a form of compensation for her previous struggles.\n\nIsabella's life in Bari was one of splendour.<ref>Desmond Seward and Susan Mountgarret, ''Old Puglia: A Cultural Companion to South-Eastern Italy''</ref> She lived in [[Castello Normanno-Svevo (Bari)|Castello Normanno-Svevo]] and spent her spare time working on music and literature. She summoned the writer [[Amedeo Cornale]] to her court, which witnessed the printing of Bari's first book.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> Her administration greatly benefited the Duchy, which entered into a period of revival, refurbishment and cultural florescence, which it had not enjoyed under the earlier administration of Isabella's Aragonese relatives.<ref>Christopher Kleinhenz, ''Medieval Italy: An Encyclopedia'' (Routledge, 2004), p.96</ref>\n\nKeeping in mind her previous life experiences, Isabella made it her priority to enhance the castle's defences, ensuring that it was up to date with the form of warfare that had harmed Milan and Naples.<ref>Leonie Frieda, ''The Deadly Sisterhood''</ref> This emphasis on security turned out to be well placed. In July 1502, [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]] distributed a small portion of his forces to Bari, under Isabella's protection. This led to the French considering an attack on Isabella's Duchy, some argued it would be an advantageous way of conducting war against the Spanish.<ref>William Hickling Prescott, ''History of the Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic'', Volume 3, Issue 2, (Charles C. Little and James Brown, 1840), p.43</ref> However, this was avoided when ideas of chivalry were taken into consideration.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> Whilst Isabella may have avoided danger on the count of her gender, it was a reminder that her hold on Bari was far from secure and her gender may not always excuse her.\nAside from building up defences, the situation in Milan had taught Isabella that political security was also essential; her will needed to be upheld at all times, never weakened or undermined. Therefore, she introduced more vigorous surveillance of public officials, ensuring that their notorious corruption was combated.<ref>Leonie Frieda, ''The Deadly Sisterhood''</ref>        \n[[File:Bona Sforza in 1517.jpg|thumb|left|Isabella's daughter Bona, depicted here in the year that she married (1517)]]\nAlthough it may appear that Isabella had finally found fortune, these later years were also plagued with family tragedies. In 1501, her elder daughter and namesake of her mother, [[Ippolita Maria Sforza (1493\u20131501)|Ippolita]] died around the age of eight. In 1512, her nephew, [[Rodrigo of Aragon|Rodrigo]], whom Isabella had fostered since 1506, died aged twelve. Eleven years after young Ippolita's death, Francesco followed his sister to the grave. Isabella then dedicated herself to raising her sole surviving child, [[Bona Sforza|Bona]].<ref>Desmond Seward and Susan Mountgarret, ''Old Puglia: A Cultural Companion to South-Eastern Italy''</ref> Under Isabella's direction, Bona received a [[humanism|humanist]] education, which included the teaching of statecraft.<ref>Peter G. Bietenholz & Thomas Brian Deutscher, ''Contemporaries of Erasmus: A Biographical Register of the Renaissance and Reformation, Volumes 1-3, A-Z, Volumes 1-3'' (University of Toronto Press, 2003), p.165</ref> This education prepared Bona for her future role as [[List of Polish consorts|Queen consort of Poland]].\n\nInitially, Isabella desired for Bona to wed her cousin, Maximilian Sforza, in the hope of uniting their two rival branches of the family.<ref>Leonie Frieda, ''The Deadly Sisterhood''</ref> However, Sforza control over the duchy proved too weak at this point and the French took it over once again in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Marignano]] in 1515.\n\nIn the same year, [[Barbara Z\u00e1polya]], wife of [[Sigismund I the Old]] died. The marriage had not produced male issue and so it was expected that the Polish king would remarry. Z\u00e1polya came from an anti-Habsburg family, something Emperor Maximilian was conscious of. In order to eliminate anti-Habsburg sentiments within Poland, the Emperor requested that Sigismund marry a bride selected by him.<ref>Jacqueline Glomski, ''Patronage and Humanist Literature in the Age of the Jagiellons: Court and Career in the Writings of Rudolf Agricola Junior, Valentin Eck, and Leonard Cox'' (University of Toronto Press, 2007), p.186</ref> Bona was on the list of selected candidates. As the other candidates were ruled out for various reasons, Sigismund consented to marrying Bona in the spring of 1517.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> Isabella raised extra taxes in Bari to pay for the wedding.<ref>Leonie Frieda, ''The Deadly Sisterhood''</ref>\n\nLike her mother, Bona was known for her energetic personality; she was not afraid to openly disagree with her husband and acted as a patron to artists.<ref>Peter G. Bietenholz & Thomas Brian Deutscher, ''Contemporaries of Erasmus: A Biographical Register of the Renaissance and Reformation'', p.165</ref> However, unlike Isabella, Bona was able to build up her own political faction in her marital homeland.<ref>''Ibid''</ref> In her final years, Isabella saw her daughter become a mother to four of her six children, amongst them were [[Isabella Jagiellon|Isabella]] and [[Anna of Poland|Anna Jagiellon]]. Not giving up on uniting the rival branches of the Sforza family, Isabella sent envoys to Poland to propose marriage of her granddaughter, the younger Isabella, to [[Francesco II Sforza]], newly installed Duke of Milan.<ref>Ma\u0142gorzata Duczmal, Jogailai\u010diai (in Lithuanian). Translated by Birut\u0117 Mikalonien\u0117 and Vyturys Jarutis. (Vilnius: Mokslo ir enciklopedij\u0173 leidybos centras, 2012) p.206</ref> However, Sigismund refused as the duchy was contested and Francesco's hold was tenuous.\n\n===Death===\nIsabella died in [[Bari]] on 1 February 1524, aged fifty-three. She had been Duchess for twenty-four years and a widow for thirty. The Italian Wars were still ongoing at the time. Her body was returned to Naples and buried in [[San Domenico Maggiore]].<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/154755505/isabella-of_aragon Isabella of Aragon, Find a Grave]</ref> Bona succeeded her in Bari, returning years later as a widow, during the final year of her own life in 1557.\n\nIn 2012, anthropologists excavated the body of Isabella, and concluded that she had syphilis. Her teeth had a high level of mercury, which was used (ineffectively) to treat syphilis, and had given a black color to the tooth enamel, most of which had been removed by abrading. They concluded that she was poisoned by her own medicine. \n<ref name=\"Gibbons\">{{cite journal\n| title =The Thousand-Year Graveyard\n| journal =Science \n| date =13 December 2013\n| author =Ann Gibbons\n| coauthors =\n| volume =342 \n| issue =6164 \n| pages =1306\u20131310\n| url =http://spark.sciencemag.org/the-thousand-year-graveyard/4\n| doi =10.1126/science.342.6164.1306\n| pmid =24337272\n| pmc =\n| doi-access =free\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Fornaciari\">{{cite journal\n| title =The Aragonese mummies of the Basilica of Saint Domenico Maggiore in Naples\n| journal =Med Secoli\n| year =2006\n| author =Fornaciari G.\n| coauthors =\n| volume =18\n| issue =3\n| pages =843\u201364\n| url =\n| doi =\n| pmid =18175625\n| pmc =\n}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nIsabella was first suggested as the subject of da Vinci's ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' in 1979.
