It seems clear that the ancestor of the Anatolian subgroup (which includes Hittite) separated from the other dialects of PIE first, so from a cladistic point of view Anatolian is half the IE family (e.g., Jasanoff 2003). Within the non-Anatolian half, it appears that the ancestor of the Tocharian subgroup (whose attested languages were spoken in Xinjiang, today in western China, until approximately the tenth century CE) separated from the other dialects before the latter had diverged much (e.g.,Winter 1998, Ringe 2000).

Rivals competed publicly through the size and complexity of their feasts, and alliances were confirmed by gift-giving and promises made during those public gatherings. The host of the feast was called the *''ghosti''-''potis'', the \"lord of the guests\", who honored the immortal gods and his mortal guests with gifts of food, drink, and poetry.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015|p=212}}\n\n=== Guest-host ===\nVertical power differences were partly balanced by horizontal mutual obligations of hospitality between guest and hosts.{{sfn|Anthony|Ringe|2015|p=213}} According to [[David W. Anthony]], the domestication of horses and the introduction of the wagon in the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe|Pontic-Caspian steppe]] between 4500 and 3500 BC led to an increase in mobility across the Yamnaya horizon, and eventually to the emergence of a guest-host political structure. As various herding clans began to move across the steppes, especially in harsh seasons, it became necessary to regulate local migrations on the territories of tribes which had likely restricted these obligations to their kins or co-residents (*''h\u2084er\u00f3s'') until then.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=303}} In Proto-Indo-European, the term *''gh\u00f3s-ti''-, whose original meaning must have been \"table companion\",<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garnier|first=Romain|author-link=Romain Garnier|date=2013|title=Le nom indo-europ\u00e9en de l'h\u00f4te|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7817/jameroriesoci.133.1.0057|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=133|issue=1|pages=57\u201369|doi=10.7817/jameroriesoci.133.1.0057|via=}}</ref> could either mean a ''host'' or a ''guest.''{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=303}} The connotation of an obligatory reciprocity between both guests and hosts has persisted in descendant [[Cognate|cognates]]: Latin ''hosp\u0113s'' (\"foreigner, guest; host\"), Old English ''\u0121iest'' (\"stranger, guest\"), or [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''gost\u012d'' (\"guest\") and ''gospod\u012d'' (\"master\").{{Sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=269}}\n\nGuests and hosts were indeed involved in a mutual and reciprocal relationship bound by oaths and sacrifices. The giving and receiving of favors was accompanied by a set of ritual actions that indebted the guest to show hospitality to his host at any time in the future. The obligation could even be heritable: [[Homer]]\u2019s warriors, [[Glaucus_of_Lycia|Glaukos]] and [[Diomedes]], stopped fighting and presented gifts to each other when they learned that their ''grandfathers'' had shared a guest-host relationship.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=303}}{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=19\u201320}} Violations of the guest-host obligations were immoral, illegal and unholy: in [[Early Irish law|Irish law]], refusing hospitality was deemed a crime as serious as murder.

Contractual obligations were protected by private individuals acting as sureties: they pledged to be responsible for payments of debts incurred by someone else if the latter defaulted. In case of litigation, one could either take matter into their own hands, for instance by barring someone from accessing their property to compel payment, or bring the case before judges (perhaps kings) that featured witnesses.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=21\u201322}} The word for \"oath\", ''*h\u2081\u00f3itos'', derives from the verb ''*h\u2081ei-'' (\"to go\"), after the practice of walking between slaughtered animals as part of taking an oath.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=277}}\n\nThe root ''*h\u2090\u00e9rtus'' (from ''*h\u2090er-'', \"to fit\") is associated with the concept of a [[Cosmos|cosmic order]], i.e. which is \"fitting, right, ordered\".

It seems clear that the ancestor of the Anatolian subgroup (which includes Hittite) separated from the other dialects of PIE first, so from a cladistic point of view Anatolian is half the IE family (e.g., Jasanoff 2003). Within the non-Anatolian half, it appears that the ancestor of the Tocharian subgroup (whose attested languages were spoken in Xinjiang, today in western China, until approximately the tenth century CE) separated from the other dialects before the latter had diverged much (e.g.,Winter 1998, Ringe 2000). It follows that an item inherited by two or more of the daughter subgroups can be reconstructed for \"early\" PIE only if it is attested in at least one Anatolian language and at least one non-Anatolian language, and such an item can be reconstructed for the ancestor of the non-Anatolian subgroups only if it is attested in one or both of the Tocharian languages and in some other IE language.

As various herding clans began to move across the steppes, especially in harsh seasons, it became necessary to regulate local migrations on the territories of tribes which had likely restricted these obligations to their kins or co-residents (*''h\u2084er\u00f3s'') until then.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=303}} In Proto-Indo-European, the term *''gh\u00f3s-ti''-, whose original meaning must have been \"table companion\",<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garnier|first=Romain|author-link=Romain Garnier|date=2013|title=Le nom indo-europ\u00e9en de l'h\u00f4te|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7817/jameroriesoci.133.1.0057|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|volume=133|issue=1|pages=57\u201369|doi=10.7817/jameroriesoci.133.1.0057|via=}}</ref> could either mean a ''host'' or a ''guest.''{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=303}} The connotation of an obligatory reciprocity between both guests and hosts has persisted in descendant [[Cognate|cognates]]: Latin ''hosp\u0113s'' (\"foreigner, guest; host\"), Old English ''\u0121iest'' (\"stranger, guest\"), or [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''gost\u012d'' (\"guest\") and ''gospod\u012d'' (\"master\").{{Sfn|Mallory|Adams|2006|p=269}}\n\nGuests and hosts were indeed involved in a mutual and reciprocal relationship bound by oaths and sacrifices. The giving and receiving of favors was accompanied by a set of ritual actions that indebted the guest to show hospitality to his host at any time in the future. The obligation could even be heritable: [[Homer]]\u2019s warriors, [[Glaucus_of_Lycia|Glaukos]] and [[Diomedes]], stopped fighting and presented gifts to each other when they learned that their ''grandfathers'' had shared a guest-host relationship.{{sfn|Anthony|2007|p=303}}{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=19\u201320}} Violations of the guest-host obligations were immoral, illegal and unholy: in [[Early Irish law|Irish law]], refusing hospitality was deemed a crime as serious as murder.

Contractual obligations were protected by private individuals acting as sureties: they pledged to be responsible for payments of debts incurred by someone else if the latter defaulted. In case of litigation, one could either take matter into their own hands, for instance by barring someone from accessing their property to compel payment, or bring the case before judges (perhaps kings) that featured witnesses.{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=21\u201322}} The word for \"oath\", ''*h\u2081\u00f3itos'', derives from the verb ''*h\u2081ei-'' (\"to go\"), after the practice of walking between slaughtered animals as part of taking an oath.{{snf|Mallory|Adams|2006|page=277}}\n\nThe root ''*h\u2090\u00e9rtus'' (from ''*h\u2090er-'', \"to fit\") is associated with the concept of a [[Cosmos|cosmic order]], i.e. which is \"fitting, right, ordered\".
