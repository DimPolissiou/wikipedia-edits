They encounter a mermaid who they discover is actually Ula in the form of a Mermaid. After showing her the Kalliope Crystal, Ula shows them her workshop where she makes Genie Gems.

The Mermaid Gem is also mentioned to have been created by Ula as the Divina Gem possesses its power, allowing Ula to use it in the same manner as the Mermaid Gem and is implied to be how Ula transformed into her mermaid form that the girls first encounter her in.\n| LineColor       = 37B700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 50\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n| Title           = Dance Magic\n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = Carin-Anne Anderson & Enrico Vilbar Santana\n| WrittenBy       = Dustin Ferrer\n| Aux2            = Kate Brusk & Lee-Roy Lahey\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|17}}\n| AltDate         = February 4, 2018<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treehousetv.com/clocal_schedule/nojs/20180204/eastern|title=2018-02-04 on Treehouse TV|work=treehousetv.com|accessdate=March 25, 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180202211448/http://www.treehousetv.com/clocal_schedule/nojs/20180204/eastern|archive-date=February 2, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| ProdCode        = 308\n| Viewers         = 0.88<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-friday-cable-originals-network-finals-11-17-2017.html|title=UPDATED:  SHOWBUZZDAILY\u2019s Top 150 Friday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 11.17.2017 - Showbuzz Daily|author=|date=|website=www.showbuzzdaily.com|accessdate=February 18, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Princess Samira and the girls travel to Rainbow Zahramay so Samira can introduce them to the Dance Magic Instructor, Sarah so they can learn some Dance Magic.

Samira then shows them the wish room which contains wish magic which Samira uses to create wish items for Leah and Zac's world. When a bunch of wish ladybugs, Samira leaves to chase after them with other genies in the room leaving Zac and the girls to explore the wish room, though she warns them not to make any wishes as the magic in the room will cause any wish to be granted over and over. The girls and Zac have fun in the room, until Zac remembers he is still hungry and accidentally wishes he had a Zazzle berry causing large Zazzle berries to start filling the room. Samira returns and attempts to stop the wish using her staff but it gets caught in one of the Zazzle berries. The girls suggest they use the Caliana Crystal to soak up the wish magic and return to the library, while Zac and Samira try to recover Samira's staff. However Shimmer opens one of the magic books which unleashes a powerful gust of wind that creates a huge mess. They manage to close the book but have to search for the crystal in the mess.

The twins suggest to Leah that they take it to Princess Ula, the Ruler of Rainbow Zahramay who is responsible for making Genie Gems. They travel to Ula's Palace. They encounter a mermaid who they discover is actually Ula in the form of a Mermaid. After showing her the Kalliope Crystal, Ula shows them her workshop where she makes Genie Gems. She demonstrates how a Kaliope Crystal is turned into a Genie Gem, by using one over her Kaliope Crystals breaking it apart to create a blank gem and then imbue it with the power of Music to create a Music Gem. She then offers to let the girls create their own gem using the crystal they found. Leah wants to create a Flight Gem, while Shine wants to create a Speedy Gem, and Shimmer wants to create a gem that makes things bright and shiny. Ula however explains that they can only add on magic power to the gem. Though the girls think they are in agreement they end up imbuing different powers into the gem which results in an unstable Chaos Gem, which randomly produces the magic it is imbued with causing havoc. However Ula explains she can turn it back into a blank gem, though they need to put it on her gem pedestal to remove the magic before it becomes a Chaos Gem permanently. They chase it through the palace, but it goes into the water and the girls reveal that they could get it if they had their Genie Gem, causing Ula to show them her Divina Gem which possesses the power of all the gems Ula created including the Mermaid Gem, allowing them to transform into Mermaids to chase after it. They follow it back to Ula's workshop, where it causes Leah and objects to levitate. Eventually Shine manages to catch the Chaos Gem and Ula uses her staff to remove its magic, turning it back into a blank gem. The girls try again and decide to create a Rainbow Gem which has all the powers they wanted as it allows them to create rainbows to ride on.  \n*'''Genie Gems:''' This episode introduces how Genie Gems are created from Kaliope Crystals which are crystals used to create Blank Gems which are then imbued with magic using Ula's staff and gem pedestal to create Genie Gems. Several different gems are introduced:  Blank Gems which are gems that have not yet been imbued with magic, Music Gem which is imbued with the power of music, Chaos Gems which are unstable gems created by imbuing a gem with separate powers (such as the Chaos Gem created by the girls which had the power of Flight, Speed, and Color Changing), the Divina Gem which is a gem created by Ula that contains the power of all the gems she has created and is implied to be the one of the most powerful genie gem that exists, and the Rainbow Gem created by the girls which has the power to create rainbows which the girls can ride on using rainbow boards. The Mermaid Gem is also mentioned to have been created by Ula as the Divina Gem possesses its power, allowing Ula to use it in the same manner as the Mermaid Gem and is implied to be how Ula transformed into her mermaid form that the girls first encounter her in.\n| LineColor       = 37B700\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 50\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n| Title           = Dance Magic\n| RTitle          = \n| DirectedBy      = Carin-Anne Anderson & Enrico Vilbar Santana\n| WrittenBy       = Dustin Ferrer\n| Aux2            = Kate Brusk & Lee-Roy Lahey\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|11|17}}\n| AltDate         = February 4, 2018<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treehousetv.com/clocal_schedule/nojs/20180204/eastern|title=2018-02-04 on Treehouse TV|work=treehousetv.com|accessdate=March 25, 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180202211448/http://www.treehousetv.com/clocal_schedule/nojs/20180204/eastern|archive-date=February 2, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| ProdCode        = 308\n| Viewers         = 0.88<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-friday-cable-originals-network-finals-11-17-2017.html|title=UPDATED:  SHOWBUZZDAILY\u2019s Top 150 Friday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 11.17.2017 - Showbuzz Daily|author=|date=|website=www.showbuzzdaily.com|accessdate=February 18, 2018}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Princess Samira and the girls travel to Rainbow Zahramay so Samira can introduce them to the Dance Magic Instructor, Sarah so they can learn some Dance Magic.

[[Research in lithium-ion batteries]] focuses on improving [[energy density]], [[power density]], safety, durability and cost.\n\n== Research areas ==\n\n=== Energy density ===\nIncreased energy density requires inserting/extracting more [[ion]]s from the [[electrode]]s. Electrode capacities are compared through three different measures: capacity per unit of mass (known as \"[[specific energy]]\" or \"gravimetric capacity\"), capacity per unit volume (\"volumetric capacity\"), and area-normalized specific capacity (\"areal capacity\").\n\n=== Power density ===\nSeparate efforts focus on improving power density (rate of charge/discharge). Power density is based upon mass and charge transport, electronic and ionic [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]], and electron-transfer kinetics; easy transport through shorter distance and greater surface area improve the rates.<ref name=\"NatMat2005\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Aric\u00f2 | first1 = A.

However, the increase also increases side reactions between the electrode and the electrolyte, causing higher self-discharge, reduced charge/discharge cycles and lower calendar life. Some recent work focused on developing materials that are electrochemically active within the range where electrolyte decomposition or electrolyte/electrode reactions do not occur.<ref name=\"NatMat2005\" />\n\n=== Nonconventional architectures ===\nA research concept has been proposed, in which the major parts of lithium-ion batteries, that is, anode, electrolyte and cathode are combined in one functional molecule.

Three-dimensional thin-films use the third dimension to increase the electrochemically active area. Thin film two dimensional batteries are restricted to between 2-5 micrometres, limiting areal capacity to significantly less than that of three-dimensional geometries.\n\nDimensionality is increased by using a perforated substrate. One way to create perforations is through inductive coupled plasma etching on silicon.<ref name=JMS2005>{{Cite journal | last1 = Nathan | first1 = M. | last2 = Golodnitsky | first2 = D. | last3 = Yufit | first3 = V. | last4 = Strauss | first4 = E. | last5 = Ripenbein | first5 = T. | last6 = Shechtman | first6 = I. | last7 = Menkin | first7 = S. | last8 = Peled | first8 = E. | doi = 10.1109/JMEMS.2005.851860 | title = Three-dimensional thin-film Li-ion microbatteries for autonomous MEMS | journal = Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 879\u2013885 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref>\n\nAnother approached used highly [[anisotropic]] etching of a silicon substrate through electrochemical or reactive ion etching to create deep trenches. The requisite layers, an anode, separator, and cathode, for a battery were then added by low-pressure [[chemical vapor deposition]]. The battery consists of a thin active silicon layer separated from a thin cathodic layer by a solid-state electrolyte. The electrochemically active area consists of 50&nbsp;nm nanoparticles, smaller than the critical size for crack propagation.<ref name=\"AD2007\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Pikul | first1 = J.

For this design power and energy density is maximized by minimizing electrode separation. An innate non-uniform current density occurs and lowers cell efficiencies, reduces stability and produces non-uniform heating within the cell. Relative to a two dimensional battery the length (L) over which transport must occur is decreased by two-thirds, which improves kinetics and reduces ohmic loses. Optimization of L can lead to significant improvement in areal capacity; an L on the size scale of 500 micrometres results in a 350% increase in capacity over a comparable two dimensional battery. However, ohmic losses increase with L, eventually offsetting the enhancement achieved through increasing L.\n\nFor this geometry, four main designs were proposed: rows of anodes and cathodes, alternating anodes and cathodes, hexagonally packed 1:2 anodes:cathodes, and alternating anodic and cathodic triangular poles where the nearest neighbors in the row are rotated 180 degrees.\n\nThe row design has a large, non-uniform current distribution. The alternating design exhibits better uniformity, given a high number of electrodes of opposite [[Electrical polarity|polarity]]. For systems with an anode or cathode that is sensitive to non-uniform current density, non-equal numbers of cathodes and anodes can be used; the 2:1 hexagonal design allows for a uniform current density at the anode but a non-uniform current distribution at the cathode. Performance can be increased through changing the shape of the poles. The triangular design improves cell capacity and power by sacrificing current uniformity.<ref name=\"CR2006\" />  A similar system uses interdigitated plates instead of poles.<ref name=\"CR2006\" />\n\nIn 2013 researchers used [[additive manufacturing]] to create stacked, interdigitated electrodes. The battery was no larger than a grain of sand. The process placed anodes and cathodes closer to each other than before. The ink for the anode was nanoparticles of one lithium metal oxide compound, and the ink for the cathode from nanoparticles of another. The printer deposited the inks onto the teeth of two gold combs, forming an interlaced stack of anodes and cathodes.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Sun | first1 = K. | last2 = Wei | first2 = T.

Instead of discrete anode and cathode poles, the anode or cathode is kept as a pole that is coated by electrolyte. The other electrode serves as the continuous phase in which the anode/cathode resides. The main advantage is that the amount of electrolyte is reduced, increasing energy density. This design maintains a short transport distance like the interdigitated system and thus has a similar benefit to charge and mass transport, while minimizing ohmic loses.<ref name = CR2006/>\n\n===Inverse opal===\n\nA version of the concentric cylinder packed particles or close-packed polymer to create a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) carbon anode. This system is fabricated by using colloidal crystal templating, electrochemical thin-film growth, and soft sol\u2013gel chemistry. 3DOM materials have a unique structure of nanometer thick walls that surround interconnected and closed-packed sub-micrometer voids. The 3DOM structure is coated with a thin polymer layer and then filled with second conducting phase. This method leads to a battery with short transport lengths, high ionic conductivity and reasonable electrical conductivity. It removes the need for additives that do not contribute to electrochemical performance. Performance can be improved by coating with tin oxide nanoparticles to enhance the initial capacity.<ref name = AM2006>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ergang | first1 = N. S. | last2 = Lytle | first2 = J.

The reason for this interest is because of shortened transport lengths, resistance to degradation and storage. For carbon nanotubes (CNT), lithium-ions can be stored on the exterior surface, in the interstitial sites between the nanotubes and on the tube's interior.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Landi | first1 = B.

As geometries become more complex, non-line-of-sight methods to in-fill the design with electrolyte materials supply the oppositely charged electrode is essential. These batteries can be coated with various materials to improve their performance and stability. However, chemical and physical heterogeneity leaves molecular-level control a significant challenge, especially since the electrochemistry for energy storage is not defect-tolerant.<ref name = ACR2007/>\n\n===Layer-by-layer (LbL)===\n\n[[Layer by layer|LbL]] approaches are used to coat 3d nanoarchitecture. Electrostatically binding a charged polymer to an oppositely charged surface coats the surface with polymer. Repeated steps of oppositely charged polymer build up a well-controlled thick layer. [[Polyelectrolyte]] films and ultrathin (less than 5&nbsp;nm) of electroactive polymers have been deposited on planar substrates using this method. However, problems exist with the deposition of polymers within complex geometries, e.g. pores, on the size scale of 50-300&nbsp;nm, resulting in defective coatings. One potential solution is to use self-limiting approaches.<ref name = ACR2007/>\n\n===Atomic layer deposition (ALD)===\n\nAnother approach to coating is [[Atomic layer deposition|ALD]] which coats the substrate layer-by-layer with atomic precision. The precision is because reactions are confined to the surface containing an active chemical [[moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] that reacts with a precursor; this limits thickness to one monolayer. This self-limiting growth is essential for complete coatings since deposition does not inhibit the access by other polymeric units to non-coated sites. Thicker samples can be produced by cycling gases in a similar manner to alternating with oppositely charged polymers in LbL. In practice ALD may require a few cycles in order to achieve the desired coverage and can result in varied morphologies such as islands, isolated crystallites, or nanoparticles. Morphology can alter electrochemical behavior and therefore must be carefully controlled.<ref name = ACR2007/>\n\nALD was also used to deposit iron oxide on 3DOM carbon to enhance reactivity between lithium and oxygen. The iron was then coatedwith palladium nanoparticles, which effectively reduced carbon's destructive reaction with oxygen and improved the discharge cycle. Wang said the findings show 3DOm carbon can meet new performance standards when it is stabilized.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Boosting carbon\u2019s stability for better lithium-air batteries|last = Hayward|first = Ed|date = 2015-02-25|work = R&D}}</ref>\n\n===Electropolymerization===\n\nElectropolymerization supplies a thin polymer film, 10 to 100&nbsp;nm. The electropolymerization of an insulating polymer results in self-limiting deposition as the active moiety is protected; the deposition can also be self-limiting if the polymer can block the solubilized monomer and prohibit continued growth. Through the control of electrochemical variables, [[polyaniline]] and [[polythiophene]] can be deposited in a controlled manner. [[Styrene]], [[methyl methacrylate]], [[phenols]] and other electrically insulating polymers have been deposited on the electrodes to act as a separator that allows ionic transport, but inhibits electrical transport to prevent shorts. Mesoporous manganese dioxide ambigels have been protected by 7-9&nbsp;nm films of polymer such that dissolution of the manganese dioxide in aqueous acid was avoided. Uniform coatings require the architecture to be wetted by the monomer solution; this can be achieved through a solution that displays a similar surface energy to that of the porous solid. As the scale continuous to decrease and transport through the solid becomes more difficult, pre-equilibration is needed to ensure coating uniformity.<ref name =CSR2009/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Lithium-ion batteries]]\n[[Category:Nanotechnology]]\n", "text_old": "'''Nanoarchitectures for lithium-ion batteries''' are attempts to employ [[nanotechnology]] to improve the design of [[lithium-ion batteries]].

For this design power and energy density is maximized by minimizing electrode separation. An innate non-uniform current density occurs and lowers cell efficiencies, reduces stability and produces non-uniform heating within the cell. Relative to a two dimensional battery the length (L) over which transport must occur is decreased by two-thirds, which improves kinetics and reduces ohmic loses. Optimization of L can lead to significant improvement in areal capacity; an L on the size scale of 500 micrometres results in a 350% increase in capacity over a comparable two dimensional battery. However, ohmic losses increase with L, eventually offsetting the enhancement achieved through increasing L.\n\nFor this geometry, four main designs were proposed: rows of anodes and cathodes, alternating anodes and cathodes, hexagonally packed 1:2 anodes:cathodes, and alternating anodic and cathodic triangular poles where the nearest neighbors in the row are rotated 180 degrees.\n\nThe row design has a large, non-uniform current distribution. The alternating design exhibits better uniformity, given a high number of electrodes of opposite [[Electrical polarity|polarity]]. For systems with an anode or cathode that is sensitive to non-uniform current density, non-equal numbers of cathodes and anodes can be used; the 2:1 hexagonal design allows for a uniform current density at the anode but a non-uniform current distribution at the cathode. Performance can be increased through changing the shape of the poles. The triangular design improves cell capacity and power by sacrificing current uniformity.<ref name=\"CR2006\" />  A similar system uses interdigitated plates instead of poles.<ref name=\"CR2006\" />\n\nIn 2013 researchers used [[additive manufacturing]] to create stacked, interdigitated electrodes. The battery was no larger than a grain of sand. The process placed anodes and cathodes closer to each other than before. The ink for the anode was nanoparticles of one lithium metal oxide compound, and the ink for the cathode from nanoparticles of another. The printer deposited the inks onto the teeth of two gold combs, forming an interlaced stack of anodes and cathodes.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Sun | first1 = K. | last2 = Wei | first2 = T.

Instead of discrete anode and cathode poles, the anode or cathode is kept as a pole that is coated by electrolyte. The other electrode serves as the continuous phase in which the anode/cathode resides. The main advantage is that the amount of electrolyte is reduced, increasing energy density. This design maintains a short transport distance like the interdigitated system and thus has a similar benefit to charge and mass transport, while minimizing ohmic loses.<ref name = CR2006/>\n\n===Inverse opal===\n\nA version of the concentric cylinder packed particles or close-packed polymer to create a three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) carbon anode. This system is fabricated by using colloidal crystal templating, electrochemical thin-film growth, and soft sol\u2013gel chemistry. 3DOM materials have a unique structure of nanometer thick walls that surround interconnected and closed-packed sub-micrometer voids. The 3DOM structure is coated with a thin polymer layer and then filled with second conducting phase. This method leads to a battery with short transport lengths, high ionic conductivity and reasonable electrical conductivity. It removes the need for additives that do not contribute to electrochemical performance. Performance can be improved by coating with tin oxide nanoparticles to enhance the initial capacity.<ref name = AM2006>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ergang | first1 = N. S. | last2 = Lytle | first2 = J.

As geometries become more complex, non-line-of-sight methods to in-fill the design with electrolyte materials supply the oppositely charged electrode is essential. These batteries can be coated with various materials to improve their performance and stability. However, chemical and physical heterogeneity leaves molecular-level control a significant challenge, especially since the electrochemistry for energy storage is not defect-tolerant.<ref name = ACR2007/>\n\n===Layer-by-layer (LbL)===\n\n[[Layer by layer|LbL]] approaches are used to coat 3d nanoarchitecture. Electrostatically binding a charged polymer to an oppositely charged surface coats the surface with polymer. Repeated steps of oppositely charged polymer build up a well-controlled thick layer. [[Polyelectrolyte]] films and ultrathin (less than 5&nbsp;nm) of electroactive polymers have been deposited on planar substrates using this method. However, problems exist with the deposition of polymers within complex geometries, e.g. pores, on the size scale of 50-300&nbsp;nm, resulting in defective coatings. One potential solution is to use self-limiting approaches.<ref name = ACR2007/>\n\n===Atomic layer deposition (ALD)===\n\nAnother approach to coating is [[Atomic layer deposition|ALD]] which coats the substrate layer-by-layer with atomic precision. The precision is because reactions are confined to the surface containing an active chemical [[moiety (chemistry)|moiety]] that reacts with a precursor; this limits thickness to one monolayer. This self-limiting growth is essential for complete coatings since deposition does not inhibit the access by other polymeric units to non-coated sites. Thicker samples can be produced by cycling gases in a similar manner to alternating with oppositely charged polymers in LbL. In practice ALD may require a few cycles in order to achieve the desired coverage and can result in varied morphologies such as islands, isolated crystallites, or nanoparticles. Morphology can alter electrochemical behavior and therefore must be carefully controlled.<ref name = ACR2007/>\n\nALD was also used to deposit iron oxide on 3DOM carbon to enhance reactivity between lithium and oxygen. The iron was then coatedwith palladium nanoparticles, which effectively reduced carbon's destructive reaction with oxygen and improved the discharge cycle. Wang said the findings show 3DOm carbon can meet new performance standards when it is stabilized.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Boosting carbon\u2019s stability for better lithium-air batteries|last = Hayward|first = Ed|date = 2015-02-25|work = R&D}}</ref>\n\n===Electropolymerization===\n\nElectropolymerization supplies a thin polymer film, 10 to 100&nbsp;nm. The electropolymerization of an insulating polymer results in self-limiting deposition as the active moiety is protected; the deposition can also be self-limiting if the polymer can block the solubilized monomer and prohibit continued growth. Through the control of electrochemical variables, [[polyaniline]] and [[polythiophene]] can be deposited in a controlled manner. [[Styrene]], [[methyl methacrylate]], [[phenols]] and other electrically insulating polymers have been deposited on the electrodes to act as a separator that allows ionic transport, but inhibits electrical transport to prevent shorts. Mesoporous manganese dioxide ambigels have been protected by 7-9&nbsp;nm films of polymer such that dissolution of the manganese dioxide in aqueous acid was avoided. Uniform coatings require the architecture to be wetted by the monomer solution; this can be achieved through a solution that displays a similar surface energy to that of the porous solid. As the scale continuous to decrease and transport through the solid becomes more difficult, pre-equilibration is needed to ensure coating uniformity.<ref name =CSR2009/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Lithium-ion batteries]]\n[[Category:Nanotechnology]]\n", "name_user": "Bellowhead678", "label": "safe", "comment": "Aperoidic->Aperiodic -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanoarchitectures_for_lithium-ion_batteries"}

The maqama contains elements of social criticism, that aims to draw attention to the neglected agricultural system in eighteenth-century Iraq; however, it comes in the form of a playful petition to a patron, and the rural point of view is there to make the listeners or readers laugh, as well as relatively awaken them to the social melancholy in the countryside.\n\nNasrallah's maqama widens the perspectives of maqama by its rural setting. Plants had their say in many earlier maqamas but always remained within the refined urban culture.

Nader believed that if the names of the four caliphs would be read in the proper Sunni order by a Shi'i [[Imam]], it would provide a public stamp of approval to the agreement. \n\nSo in his sermon, Nasrallah decided to use his exceptional literary skills when pronouncing the [[Islamic honorifics|tardiya]], i.e ''Radi Allahu anhu'' (may Allah be pleased with him), after the names of [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]], as Sunni Muslims usually do upon mentioning the names of the [[Companions of the Prophet|sahaba]]. He had done what was expected, but he made a \"mistake\" and pronounced Umar's name with a\u00a0triptote ending ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0645\u0631\u0650}}), turning the meaning of the formula into \"may Allah be pleased with anyone named 'Umar'\". Playing, in addition, on the two inflectional terms ''<nowiki/>'adl'' (justice) and ''ma'rifa'' (knowledge), which are commonly known to grammarians, he made an extremely sublime pun that only a listener with advanced grammatical expertise, i.e al-Suwaydi, would grasp. He thus surreptitiously fulminated against the second caliph twisting the usual meanings of ''<nowiki/>'adl'' and ''ma'rifa'' and unequivocally declared Umar void of these two virtues without explicitly uttering it. He also carried out the prayer in the Shi'i way.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikisource/ar/3/35/%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%AC%D9%81.pdf|title=Mu'tamar an-Najaf|last=al-Suwaydi|first=Abdullah|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=45|language=Arabic|trans-title=The Conference Of Najaf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aqaed.com/book/473/confrance-02.html#sim29/|title=Mu'tamar 'Ulama' Baghdad (li-Maqatel Bin Atiyah al-Bakri)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aqaed.com|language=Arabic|trans-title=The Conference Of Baghdad (Reports of Bin Atiyah al-Bakri)|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Br\u00fcnner|first=Rainer|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jH5PyxCkeUkC&printsec|title=Islamic Ecumenism In The 20th Century: The Azhar And Shiism Between Rapprochement And Restraint|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|year=|isbn=978-90-04-12548-3|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThis way, Nasrallah managed to vent the true feelings of the Shia's, and restore their dignity, without angering Nader, who was oblivious to the grammatical subtleties. \n\nDespite what seemed like a positive conclusion to the meeting<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikisource/ar/3/35/%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%AC%D9%81.pdf|title=Mu'tamar an-Najaf|last=al-Suwaydi|first=Abdullah|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=46|trans-title=The Conference Of Najaf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=al-Karkukli|first=Rasool|title=Dowhat al-Wuzara' Fi Tarikh Baghdad al-Zawraa'|publisher=Dar al-Katib al-Arabi|year=|isbn=|location=Cairo, Egypt|pages=63|language=Arabic|trans-title=The Circle of Ministers In The History of Baghdad}}</ref>, the conference represented an early instructional example of the complicated relationship between politics and theology, especially as far as inner-Islamic rapprochement is concerned.<ref>{{Cite book|last=al-Karkukli|first=Rasool|title=Dowhat al-Wuzara' Fi Tarikh Baghdad al-Zawraa'|publisher=Dar al-Katib al-Arabi|year=|isbn=|location=Cairo, Egypt|pages=64\u201365|language=Arabic|trans-title=The Circle of Ministers In The History of Baghdad}}</ref>\n\n=== Assassination ===\nThe year following the Najaf conference, Nader Shah sent Nasrallah, as the Shia's representative to [[Mecca]], with a letter to the [[Sharif of Mecca|Sharif]] of Mecca Mas'ood b.

The maqama contains elements of social criticism, that aims to draw attention to the neglected agricultural system in eighteenth-century Iraq; however, it comes in the form of a playful petition to a patron, and the rural point of view is there to make the listeners or readers laugh, as well as relatively awaken them to the social melancholy in the countryside.\n\nNasrallah's maqama widens the perspectives of maqama by its rural setting. Plants had their say in many earlier maqamas but always remained within the refined urban culture.

Nader believed that if the names of the four caliphs would be read in the proper Sunni order by a Shi'i [[Imam]], it would provide a public stamp of approval to the agreement. \n\nSo in his sermon, Nasrallah decided to use his exceptional literary skills when pronouncing the [[Islamic honorifics|tardiya]], i.e ''Radi Allahu anhu'' (may Allah be pleased with him), after the names of [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]], as Sunni Muslims usually do upon mentioning the names of the [[Companions of the Prophet|sahaba]]. He had done what was expected, but he made a \"mistake\" and pronounced Umar's name with a\u00a0triptote ending ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0645\u0631\u0650}}), turning the meaning of the formula into \"may Allah be pleased with anyone named 'Umar'\". Playing, in addition, on the two inflectional terms ''<nowiki/>'adl'' (justice) and ''ma'rifa'' (knowledge), which are commonly known to grammarians, he made an extremely sublime pun that only a listener with advanced grammatical expertise, i.e al-Suwaydi, would grasp. He thus surreptitiously fulminated against the second caliph twisting the usual meanings of ''<nowiki/>'adl'' and ''ma'rifa'' and unequivocally declared Umar void of these two virtues without explicitly uttering it. He also carried out the prayer in the Shi'i way.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikisource/ar/3/35/%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%AC%D9%81.pdf|title=Mu'tamar an-Najaf|last=al-Suwaydi|first=Abdullah|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=45|language=Arabic|trans-title=The Conference Of Najaf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aqaed.com/book/473/confrance-02.html#sim29/|title=Mu'tamar 'Ulama' Baghdad (li-Maqatel Bin Atiyah al-Bakri)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.aqaed.com|language=Arabic|trans-title=The Conference Of Baghdad (Reports of Bin Atiyah al-Bakri)|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Br\u00fcnner|first=Rainer|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jH5PyxCkeUkC&printsec|title=Islamic Ecumenism In The 20th Century: The Azhar And Shiism Between Rapprochement And Restraint|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|year=|isbn=978-90-04-12548-3|location=|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThis way, Nasrallah managed to vent the true feelings of the Shia's, and restore their dignity, without angering Nader, who was oblivious to the grammatical subtleties. \n\nDespite what seemed like a positive conclusion to the meeting<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikisource/ar/3/35/%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%AA%D9%85%D8%B1_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%AC%D9%81.pdf|title=Mu'tamar an-Najaf|last=al-Suwaydi|first=Abdullah|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=46|trans-title=The Conference Of Najaf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=al-Karkukli|first=Rasool|title=Dowhat al-Wuzara' Fi Tarikh Baghdad al-Zawraa'|publisher=Dar al-Katib al-Arabi|year=|isbn=|location=Cairo, Egypt|pages=63|language=Arabic|trans-title=The Circle of Ministers In The History of Baghdad}}</ref>, the conference represented an early instructional example of the complicated relationship between politics and theology, especially as far as inner-Islamic rapprochement is concerned.<ref>{{Cite book|last=al-Karkukli|first=Rasool|title=Dowhat al-Wuzara' Fi Tarikh Baghdad al-Zawraa'|publisher=Dar al-Katib al-Arabi|year=|isbn=|location=Cairo, Egypt|pages=64\u201365|language=Arabic|trans-title=The Circle of Ministers In The History of Baghdad}}</ref>\n\n=== Assassination ===\nThe year following the Najaf conference, Nader Shah sent Nasrallah, as the Shia's representative to [[Mecca]], with a letter to the [[Sharif of Mecca|Sharif]] of Mecca Mas'ood b.

The main character is Zeno Cosini, and the book is the fictional character's [[memoir]]s that he keeps at the insistence of his [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]]. Throughout the novel, we learn about his father, his business, his wife, and his [[tobacco]] habit. The novel was self-published in 1923. The original English translation was published under the title '''''Confessions of Zeno'''''.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe novel is presented as a diary written by Zeno (who claims that it is full of lies), published by his doctor. The doctor has left a little note in the beginning, saying he had Zeno write an autobiography to help him in his [[psychoanalysis]]. The doctor has published the work as revenge for Zeno discontinuing his visits.\n\nThe diary, however, does not follow the chronological order; instead, it is structured in large chapters, each one developing a particular theme (The smoke addiction, My father's death, History of my marriage and so on). Only the last chapter is a real diary, with pages related to single dates in the period of the First World War.\n\nZeno first writes about his [[cigarette]] addiction and cites the first times he smoked. In his first few paragraphs, he remembers his life as a child. One of his friends bought cigarettes for his brother and him. Soon, he steals money from his father to buy tobacco, but finally decides not to do this out of shame. Eventually, he starts to smoke his father's half-smoked [[cigar]]s instead.\n\nThe problem with his \"last cigarette\" starts when he is twenty. He contracts a fever and his doctor tells him that to heal he must abstain from smoking. He decides smoking is bad for him and smokes his \"last cigarette\" so he can quit. However, this is not his last and he soon becomes plagued with \"last cigarettes.\" He attempts to quit on days of important events in his life and soon obsessively attempts to quit on the basis of the harmony in the numbers of dates. Each time, the cigarette fails to truly be the last. He goes to doctors and asks friends to help him give up the habit, but to no avail. He even commits himself into a clinic, but escapes. The whole theme, while objectively serious, is often treated in a humorous way.\n\nWhen Zeno reaches middle age, his father's health begins to deteriorate. He starts to live closer to his father in case he passes away. Zeno is very different from his father, who is a serious man, while Zeno likes to joke. For instance, when his father states that Zeno is crazy, Zeno goes to the doctor and gets an official certification that he is sane. He shows this to his father who is hurt by this joke and becomes even more convinced that Zeno must be crazy. His father is also afraid of death, being very uncomfortable with the drafting of his will. One night, his father falls gravely ill and loses consciousness. The doctor comes and works on the patient, who is brought out of the clutches of death momentarily. Over the next few days, his father is able to get up and regains a bit of his self. He is restless and shifts positions for comfort often, even though the doctor says that staying in bed would be good for his circulation. One night, as his father tries to roll out of bed, Zeno blocks him from moving, to do as the doctor wished. His angry father then stands up and accidentally slaps Zeno in the face before dying.\n\nHis memoirs then trace how he meets his wife. When he is starting to learn about the business world, he meets his future father-in-law Giovanni Malfenti, an intelligent and successful businessman, whom Zeno admires. Malfenti has four daughters, Ada, Augusta, Alberta, and Anna, and when Zeno meets them, he decides that he wants to court Ada because of her beauty and since Alberta is quite young, while he regards Augusta as too plain, and Anna is only a little girl. He is unsuccessful and the Malfentis think that he is actually trying to court Augusta, who had fallen in love with him. He soon meets his rival for Ada's love, who is Guido Speier. Guido speaks perfect [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] (while Zeno speaks the dialect of [[Trieste]]), is handsome, and has a full head of hair (compared with Zeno's bald head). That evening, while Guido and Zeno both visit the Malfentis, Zeno proposes to Ada and she rejects him for Guido. Zeno then proposes to Alberta, who is not interested in marrying, and he is rejected by her also. Finally, he proposes to Augusta (who knows that Zeno first proposed to the other two) and she accepts, because she loves him.\n\nVery soon, the couples get married and Zeno starts to realize that he can love Augusta. This surprises him as his love for her does not diminish. However, he meets Carla, a poor aspiring singer, and they start an affair, with Carla thinking that Zeno does not love his wife. Meanwhile, Ada and Guido marry and Mr. Malfenti gets sick. Zeno's affection for both Augusta and Carla increases and he has a daughter named Antonia around the time Giovanni passes away. Finally, one day, Carla expresses a sudden whim to see Augusta. Zeno deceives Carla and causes her to meet Ada instead. Carla misrepresents Ada as Zeno's wife, and moved by her beauty and sadness, breaks off the affair.\n\nZeno goes on to relate the business partnership between him and Guido. The two men set up a merchant business together in Trieste. They hire two workers named Luciano and Carmen (who becomes Guido's mistress) and they attempt to make as much profit as possible. However, due to Guido's obsession with debts and credit as well as with the notion of profit, the company does poorly. Guido and Ada's marriage begins to crumble as does Ada's health and beauty, due to ''Morbus Basedowii'' ([[Graves' disease]]).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Svevo|first=Italo|title=Zeno's Conscience: A Novel|publisher=Vintage|year=2003|isbn=0-375-72776-0|location=|pages=315\u2013321|translator-last=Weaver|translator-first=William}}</ref> Guido fakes a suicide attempt to gain Ada's compassion and she asks Zeno to help Guido's failing company. Guido starts playing on the [[Stock exchange|Bourse]] (stock exchange) and loses even more money. On a fishing trip, he asks Zeno about the differences in effects between sodium [[veronal]] and veronal and Zeno answers that sodium veronal is fatal while veronal is not. Guido's gambling on the Bourse becomes very destructive and he finally tries to fake another suicide to gain Ada's compassion. However, he takes a fatal amount of veronal and dies. Soon thereafter, Zeno misses Guido's funeral because he himself gambles Guido's money on the Bourse and recovers three quarters of the losses.\n\nZeno describes his current life. It is during the [[World War I|Great War]] and his daughter Antonia (who greatly resembles Ada) and son Alfio have grown up. He spends his time visiting doctors, looking for a cure to his imagined sickness. One of the doctors claims he is suffering from the [[Oedipus complex]], but Zeno does not believe it to be true. Not a single doctor is able to treat him.\n\nIn May 1915 \u2013 Italy is still neutral, as Zeno wants it to be \u2013 Zeno and his family spend a vacation on the green banks of the [[Isonzo]].

The main character is Zeno Cosini, and the book is the fictional character's [[memoir]]s that he keeps at the insistence of his [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]]. Throughout the novel, we learn about his father, his business, his wife, and his [[tobacco]] habit. The novel was self-published in 1923. The original English translation was published under the title '''''Confessions of Zeno'''''.\n\n==Plot summary==\nThe novel is presented as a diary written by Zeno (who claims that it is full of lies), published by his doctor. The doctor has left a little note in the beginning, saying he had Zeno write an autobiography to help him in his [[psychoanalysis]]. The doctor has published the work as revenge for Zeno discontinuing his visits.\n\nThe diary, however, does not follow the chronological order; instead, it is structured in large chapters, each one developing a particular theme (The smoke addiction, My father's death, History of my marriage and so on). Only the last chapter is a real diary, with pages related to single dates in the period of the First World War.\n\nZeno first writes about his [[cigarette]] addiction and cites the first times he smoked. In his first few paragraphs, he remembers his life as a child. One of his friends bought cigarettes for his brother and him. Soon, he steals money from his father to buy tobacco, but finally decides not to do this out of shame. Eventually, he starts to smoke his father's half-smoked [[cigar]]s instead.\n\nThe problem with his \"last cigarette\" starts when he is twenty. He contracts a fever and his doctor tells him that to heal he must abstain from smoking. He decides smoking is bad for him and smokes his \"last cigarette\" so he can quit. However, this is not his last and he soon becomes plagued with \"last cigarettes.\" He attempts to quit on days of important events in his life and soon obsessively attempts to quit on the basis of the harmony in the numbers of dates. Each time, the cigarette fails to truly be the last. He goes to doctors and asks friends to help him give up the habit, but to no avail. He even commits himself into a clinic, but escapes. The whole theme, while objectively serious, is often treated in a humorous way.\n\nWhen Zeno reaches middle age, his father's health begins to deteriorate. He starts to live closer to his father in case he passes away. Zeno is very different from his father, who is a serious man, while Zeno likes to joke. For instance, when his father states that Zeno is crazy, Zeno goes to the doctor and gets an official certification that he is sane. He shows this to his father who is hurt by this joke and becomes even more convinced that Zeno must be crazy. His father is also afraid of death, being very uncomfortable with the drafting of his will. One night, his father falls gravely ill and loses consciousness. The doctor comes and works on the patient, who is brought out of the clutches of death momentarily. Over the next few days, his father is able to get up and regains a bit of his self. He is restless and shifts positions for comfort often, even though the doctor says that staying in bed would be good for his circulation. One night, as his father tries to roll out of bed, Zeno blocks him from moving, to do as the doctor wished. His angry father then stands up and accidentally slaps Zeno in the face before dying.\n\nHis memoirs then trace how he meets his wife. When he is starting to learn about the business world, he meets his future father-in-law Giovanni Malfenti, an intelligent and successful businessman, whom Zeno admires. Malfenti has four daughters, Ada, Augusta, Alberta, and Anna, and when Zeno meets them, he decides that he wants to court Ada because of her beauty and since Alberta is quite young, while he regards Augusta as too plain, and Anna is only a little girl. He is unsuccessful and the Malfentis think that he is actually trying to court Augusta, who had fallen in love with him. He soon meets his rival for Ada's love, who is Guido Speier. Guido speaks perfect [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] (while Zeno speaks the dialect of [[Trieste]]), is handsome, and has a full head of hair (compared with Zeno's bald head). That evening, while Guido and Zeno both visit the Malfentis, Zeno proposes to Ada and she rejects him for Guido. Zeno then proposes to Alberta, who is not interested in marrying, and he is rejected by her also. Finally, he proposes to Augusta (who knows that Zeno first proposed to the other two) and she accepts, because she loves him.\n\nVery soon, the couples get married and Zeno starts to realize that he can love Augusta. This surprises him as his love for her does not diminish. However, he meets Carla, a poor aspiring singer, and they start an affair, with Carla thinking that Zeno does not love his wife. Meanwhile, Ada and Guido marry and Mr. Malfenti gets sick. Zeno's affection for both Augusta and Carla increases and he has a daughter named Antonia around the time Giovanni passes away. Finally, one day, Carla expresses a sudden whim to see Augusta. Zeno deceives Carla and causes her to meet Ada instead. Carla misrepresents Ada as Zeno's wife, and moved by her beauty and sadness, breaks off the affair.\n\nZeno goes on to relate the business partnership between him and Guido. The two men set up a merchant business together in Trieste. They hire two workers named Luciano and Carmen (who becomes Guido's mistress) and they attempt to make as much profit as possible. However, due to Guido's obsession with debts and credit as well as with the notion of profit, the company does poorly. Guido and Ada's marriage begins to crumble as does Ada's health and beauty, due to ''Morbus Basedowii'' ([[Graves' disease]])<ref>{{Cite book|last=Svevo|first=Italo|title=Zeno's Conscience: A Novel|publisher=Vintage|year=2003|isbn=0-375-72776-0|location=|pages=315-321|translator-last=Weaver|translator-first=William}}</ref>. Guido fakes a suicide attempt to gain Ada's compassion and she asks Zeno to help Guido's failing company. Guido starts playing on the [[Stock exchange|Bourse]] (stock exchange) and loses even more money. On a fishing trip, he asks Zeno about the differences in effects between sodium [[veronal]] and veronal and Zeno answers that sodium veronal is fatal while veronal is not. Guido's gambling on the Bourse becomes very destructive and he finally tries to fake another suicide to gain Ada's compassion. However, he takes a fatal amount of veronal and dies. Soon thereafter, Zeno misses Guido's funeral because he himself gambles Guido's money on the Bourse and recovers three quarters of the losses.\n\nZeno describes his current life. It is during the [[World War I|Great War]] and his daughter Antonia (who greatly resembles Ada) and son Alfio have grown up. He spends his time visiting doctors, looking for a cure to his imagined sickness. One of the doctors claims he is suffering from the [[Oedipus complex]], but Zeno does not believe it to be true. Not a single doctor is able to treat him. \n\nIn May 1915 \u2013 Italy is still neutral, as Zeno wants it to be \u2013 Zeno and his family spend a vacation on the green banks of the [[Isonzo]]. Zeno does not yet guess that area will soon become a major battlefield. Renting a house in the village of [[Lucinico]], Zeno sets out on a casual morning stroll without his hat and jacket \u2013 when the outbreak of the [[Italian Front (World War I)|war between Italy and Austro-Hungary]] turns the area into a war zone and Zeno is separated from his wife and children by the frontline. He must go back alone to [[Trieste]], only much later finding that Augusta and the children reached [[Turin]] safely. \n\nThe final entry is written in March 1916, when Zeno \u2013 left alone in wartime Trieste \u2013 had made much money out of speculation and hoarding, but it did  not make him feel happy or pleased with life.
