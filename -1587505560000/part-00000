Large laboratory fires are rare. However, the risk of severe injury or death is significant because fuel load and hazard levels in labs are typically very high.

The hands must be protected.  \n* Tubing should be cut from a barbed connection so as not to shatter the connection.  A quick disconnect is preferable to a barbed fitting.\n* Ground glass joints can become a breaking hazard if they freeze.\n\n* Broken and other waste glass should be discarded in a separate container specially marked to indicate its contents.\n* Glassware should always be labeled as to its contents.\n* Rapid heating (or cooling) may cause uneven [[thermal expansion]] putting too much [[Stress (mechanics)|mechanical stress]] on the surface and cause it to [[fracture]]. Fracturing is a concern when people new to laboratory become impatient and heat glassware, especially the larger pieces, too fast. Heating of glassware should be slowed using an insulating material, such as metal foil or wool, or specialized equipment such as [[heated bath]]s, [[heating mantle]]s or laboratory grade [[hot plate]]s to avoid fracturing.\n* Hot glass looks like cold glass, so a person must be careful to avoid grabbing hot glassware.\n* Glassware can explode if the exhaust is in any way restricted, so any apparatus should be vented.  \n* Glassware can implode under negative pressure\n* When connecting joints, it is the responsibility of the person overseeing the experiment to select the correct seal.

Damaged electrical cords can lead to possible shocks or electrocutions. A flexible electrical cord may be damaged by door or window edges, by staples and fastenings, by equipment rolling over it, or simply by aging.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/laboratory/OSHAquickfacts-lab-safety-electrical-hazards.pdf | title=Electrical Hazards | publisher=OSHA | accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe potential for possible electrocution or electric shock or contact with electrical hazards can result from a number of factors, including the following:\n*Faulty electrical equipment/instrumentation or wiring;<ref name=\"Electrical\">https://www.lanl.gov/safety/electrical/docs/elec_hazard_awareness_study_guide.pdf</ref>\n*Damaged receptacles and connectors;<ref name=\"Electrical\" /> and\n*Unsafe work practices.<ref name=\"Electrical\" />\n\n=== Fire ===\n[[File:Segnale incendio.svg|thumb|Fire|154x154px]]\n'''[[Fire]]''' is the most common serious hazard that one faces in a typical laboratory. While proper procedures and training can minimize the chances of an accidental fire, laboratory workers should still be prepared to deal with a fire emergency should it occur. In dealing with a laboratory fire, all containers of infectious materials should be placed into autoclaves, incubators, refrigerators, or freezers for containment.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://uwaterloo.ca/safety-office/programs-and-procedures/hazard-recognition-control/fire-hazards | title=Fire Hazards control | accessdate=6 February 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206165139/https://uwaterloo.ca/safety-office/programs-and-procedures/hazard-recognition-control/fire-hazards | archive-date=6 February 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nSmall bench-top fires in laboratory spaces are not uncommon. Large laboratory fires are rare. However, the risk of severe injury or death is significant because fuel load and hazard levels in labs are typically very high. Laboratories, especially those using solvents in any quantity, have the potential for flash fires, explosion, rapid spread of fire, and high toxicity of products of combustion (heat, smoke, and flame)\n[[File:Fire blanket.jpeg|thumb|215x215px|Fire blanket]]\n\n===Glassware===\n* Broken glass is a hazard for a sharps \n* Correct eye protection should be worn in most experiments involving glassware.\n* Inserting a glass rod through a stopper can introduce the possibility of a stab wound or sharps injury if the rod breaks.  The hands must be protected.  \n* Tubing should be cut from a barbed connection so as not to shatter the connection.  A quick disconnect is preferable to a barbed fitting.\n* Ground glass joints can become a breaking hazard if they freeze.\n\n* Broken and other waste glass should be discarded in a separate container specially marked to indicate its contents.\n* Glassware should always be labeled as to its contents.\n* Rapid heating (or cooling) may cause uneven [[thermal expansion]] putting too much [[Stress (mechanics)|mechanical stress]] on the surface and cause it to [[fracture]]. Fracturing is a concern when people new to laboratory become impatient and heat glassware, especially the larger pieces, too fast. Heating of glassware should be slowed using an insulating material, such as metal foil or wool, or specialized equipment such as [[heated bath]]s, [[heating mantle]]s or laboratory grade [[hot plate]]s to avoid fracturing.\n* Hot glass looks like cold glass, so a person must be careful to avoid grabbing hot glassware.\n* Glassware can explode if the exhaust is in any way restricted, so any apparatus should be vented.  \n* Glassware can implode under negative pressure\n* When connecting joints, it is the responsibility of the person overseeing the experiment to select the correct seal.

Inspired by these photographs, in 2015 the Geneva-based [[International Organization for Migration (IOM) Mission in Ukraine|International Organization for Migration]] (IOM) launched a social media campaign under the tag #MigrantHeroes \"to invite people around the world to identify and tell the stories of migrant heroes.\"<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Loteria===\nDulce Pinz\u00f3n was inspired by the dualistic culture within Mexicans in New York. She demonstrated this concept of dualism in her project \"Loteria.\" By using images of the well known Mexican card game, she projected these images on the naked bodies of her New York friends and loved ones. This is also representative of Fernando Ortiz's concept of [[transculturation]]. By using the images of \"Loteria\" onto the human bodies of New York residents, she demonstrates how culture [[counter-flows]] through people's migration patterns, which is a form of [[cultural remittances]].\n\n== Awards ==\n2012 -

The Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship\". The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Gandhi supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that he intended to dislodge Gandhi, and the trio stood to prevent that. Gandhi's Congress party was soundly crushed in the elections. The Janata Party's democracy or dictatorship claim seemed to resonate with the public. Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi lost their seats, and Congress was reduced to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of Morarji Desai, came to power after the State of Emergency was lifted.

The main reason was the perceived bias of the United States and [[China]], rivals of USSR, towards Pakistan. The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and the casting of a veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Before the war, Gandhi signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. They were unhappy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was unhappy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept her from criticising the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Gandhi years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Gandhi, by the early 1980s, the Soviets had become India's largest trading partner.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1969.

The main reason was the perceived bias of the United States and [[China]], rivals of USSR, towards Pakistan. The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and the casting of a veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Before the war, Gandhi signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. They were unhappy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Indira was unhappy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept her from criticising the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Gandhi years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Gandhi, by the early 1980s, the Soviets had become India's largest trading partner.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

The situation was normalized in the years following the war after Abdullah [[1975 Indira\u2013Sheikh accord|agreed to an accord]] with Gandhi, by giving up the demand for a plebiscite in return for a [[Article 370 of the Constitution of India|special autonomous status for Kashmir]]. In 1975, Gandhi declared the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir (state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] as a constituent unit of India. The Kashmir conflict remained largely peaceful if frozen under Gandhi's premiership.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jayanta|last=Kumar Ray|title=Aspects of India's International Relations, 1700 to 2000: South Asia and the World|location=|publisher=Pearson|year=2007|page=493|isbn=978-8131708347}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, Gandhi granted statehood to [[Meghalaya]], [[Manipur]] and [[Tripura]], while the [[North-East Frontier Agency]] was declared a union territory and renamed [[Arunachal Pradesh]].

She argued the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The nobility responded by rallying around the [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh|Jana Sangh]] and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles, was originally brought before the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] in 1970. It was passed in the [[Lok Sabha]] but felt short of the two-thirds majority in the [[Rajya Sabha]] by a single vote.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} Gandhi responded by having a [[Presidential proclamation]] issued; de-recognizing the princes; with this withdrawal of recognition, their claims to privy purses were also legally lost.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} However, the proclamation was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of India]].{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} In 1971, Gandhi again motioned to abolish the privy purse. This time, it was successfully passed as the [[List of amendments of the Constitution of India|26th Amendment to the Constitution of India]].<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> Many royals tried to protest the abolition of the privy purse, primarily through campaigns to contest seats in elections.

The political economist, Jyotindra Das Gupta, cryptically questioned \"...whether or not the real supporters of land-holders were in jail or in power?\"<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> Critics also accused Gandhi of choosing to \"talk left and act right\", referring to her concurrent pro-business decisions and endeavours.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> [[J.

This was not acceptable to many non-Hindi speaking states, who wanted the continued use of English in government.

Wars continued intermittently after independence, and an [[ethnic cleansing]] campaign known as [[Indian removal]] gained for ethnically European settlers more valuable territory on the eastern side of the continent.\n\n[[File:U.S. Territorial Acquisitions.png|thumb|[[United States territorial acquisitions|U.S. westward expansion]]{{endash}}portions of each territory were granted statehood since the 18th century.]]\n[[File:Mitchell A New Map of Texas, Oregon, and California 1846 UTA.jpg|thumb|''A New Map of Texas, Oregon, and California'', [[Samuel Augustus Mitchell]], 1846]]\n\n[[George Washington]] began a policy of [[United States non-interventionism]] which lasted into the 1800s. The United States promulgated the [[Monroe Doctrine]] in 1821, in order to stop further European colonialism and to allow the American colonies to grow further, but desire for territorial expansion to the Pacific Ocean was explicit in the doctrine of [[Manifest Destiny]].

Senator Sam Houston of Texas even proposed a resolution in the Senate for the \"United States to declare and maintain an efficient protectorate over the States of Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and San Salvador.\" The idea of U.S. expansion into Mexico and the Caribbean was popular among politicians of the slave states, and also among some business tycoons in the Nicarauguan Transit (the semi-overland and main trade route connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans before the Panama Canal). President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] attempted to [[Annexation of Santo Domingo|Annex the Dominican Republic]] in 1870, but failed to get the support of the Senate.\n\nNon-interventionism was wholly abandoned with the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. The United States acquired the remaining island colonies of Spain, with President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] defending the acquisition of the [[Philippines]]. The U.S. policed Latin America under [[Roosevelt Corollary]], and sometimes using the military to favor American commercial interests (such as intervention in the [[banana republics]] and the [[annexation of Hawaii]]).  Imperialist foreign policy was controversial with the American public, and domestic opposition allowed Cuban independence, though in the early 20th century the U.S. obtained the [[Panama Canal Zone]] and occupied Haiti and the Dominican Republic.  The United States returned to strong non-interventionist policy after World War I, including with the [[Good Neighbor policy]] for Latin America. After fighting World War II, it administered many Pacific islands captured during the fight against Japan. Partly to prevent the militaries of those countries from growing threateningly large, and partly to contain the Soviet Union, the United States promised to defend Germany (which is also part of [[NATO]]) and Japan (through the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan]]) which it had formerly defeated in war and which are now independent democracies. It maintains substantial military bases in both.\n\nThe [[Cold War]] reoriented American foreign policy towards opposing communism, and prevailing U.S. foreign policy embraced its role as a nuclear-armed global [[superpower]]. Though the [[Truman Doctrine]] and [[Reagan Doctrine]] framed the mission as protecting free peoples against an undemocratic system, anti-Soviet foreign policy became coercive and occasionally covert. [[United States involvement in regime change]] included [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|overthrowing the democratically elected government of Iran]], the [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] in Cuba, occupation of [[Grenada]], and interference in various foreign elections. The long and bloody [[Vietnam War]] led to widespread criticism of an \"[[J. William Fulbright#Vietnam War and U.S. foreign policy|arrogance of power]]\" and [[United States war crimes#Vietnam War|violations of international law]] emerging from an \"[[imperial presidency]],\" with [[Martin Luther King]], among others, accusing the US of a [[Martin Luther King Jr.#Opposition to the Vietnam War|new form of colonialism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/beyond-vietnam|title=Beyond Vietnam|last=University|first=\u00a9 Stanford|last2=Stanford|date=2017-04-25|website=The Martin Luther King, Jr., Research and Education Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-05-09|last3=California 94305}}</ref>\n\nMany saw the post-Cold War 1990\u201391 [[Gulf War]] as motivated by U.S. oil interests, though it reversed the hostile invasion of [[Kuwait]].

Walker failed in all his escapades and never had official U.S. backing. Historian Michel Gobat, however, presents a strongly revisionist interpretation. He argues that Walker was invited in by Nicaraguan liberals who were trying to force economic modernization and political liberalism. Walker's government comprised those liberals, as well as Yankee colonizers, and European radicals. Walker even included some local Catholics as well as indigenous peoples, Cuban revolutionaries, and local peasants. His coalition was much too complex and diverse to survive long, but it was not the attempted projection of American power, concludes Gobat.<ref>Michel Gobat, ''Empire by Invitation:  William Walker and Manifest Destiny in Central America'' (Harvard UP, 2018).

American rule in Haiti continued through 1942, but was initiated during World War I. The historian Mary Renda in her book, ''Taking Haiti'', talks about the American invasion of Haiti to bring about political stability through U.S. control. The American government did not believe Haiti was ready for self-government or democracy, according to Renda. In order to bring about political stability in Haiti, the United States secured control and integrated the country into the international capitalist economy, while preventing Haiti from practicing self-governance or democracy. While Haiti had been running their own government for many years before American intervention, the U.S. government regarded Haiti as unfit for self-rule. In order to convince the American public of the justice in intervening, the United States government used [[paternalism|paternalist]] propaganda, depicting the Haitian political process as uncivilized. The Haitian government would come to agree to U.S. terms, including American overseeing of the Haitian economy. This direct supervision of the Haitian economy would reinforce U.S. propaganda and further entrench the perception of Haitians' being incompetent of self-governance.<ref>Renda, \"Introduction,\" in ''Taking Haiti: Military Occupation & the Culture of U.S. Imperialism, 1915\u20131940'', pp. 10\u201322, 29\u201334</ref>\n\nIn [[World War I]], the US, Britain, and Russia had been allies for seven months, from April 1917 until the [[Bolshevik]]s seized power in Russia in November.

In a wide sense, commerce is the mother of all wars.\u201d In 1942 this economic globalism was articulated as the \u201cGrand Area\u201d concept in secret documents. The US would have to have control over the \u201cWestern Hemisphere, Continental Europe and Mediterranean Basin (excluding Russia), the Pacific Area and the Far East, and the [[British Empire in World War II|British Empire]] (excluding Canada).\u201d The Grand Area encompassed all known major oil-bearing areas outside the Soviet Union, largely at the behest of corporate partners like the Foreign Oil Committee and the Petroleum Industry War Council.<ref>George A.

This postwar vision originated in the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] (CFR), an economic elite-led organization that became integrated into the government leadership. CFR's [[War and Peace Studies]] group offered its services to the State Department in 1939 and a secret partnership for post-war planning developed. CFR leaders [[Hamilton Fish Armstrong]] and Walter H. Mallory saw World War II as a \u201cgrand opportunity\u201d for the U.S. to emerge as \"the premier power in the world.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/americanempirero0000smit|url-access=registration|quote=grand opportunity.|title=American Empire: Roosevelt's Geographer and the Prelude to Globalization|first=Neil|last=Smith|date=October 29, 2004|publisher=University of California Press|via=Internet Archive|isbn=9780520243385}}</ref>\n\nThis vision of empire assumed the necessity of the U.S. to \u201cpolice the world\u201d in the aftermath of the war. This was not done primarily out of altruism, but out of economic interest. [[Isaiah Bowman]], a key liaison between the CFR and the State Department, proposed an \u201cAmerican economic [[Lebensraum]].\u201d This built upon the ideas of [[Time-Life]] publisher [[Henry Luce]], who (in his \u201c[[American Century]]\u201d essay) wrote, \u201cTyrannies may require a large amount of living space [but] freedom requires and will require far greater living space than Tyranny.\u201d According to Bowman's biographer, [[Neil Smith (geographer)|Neil Smith]]:\n\n<blockquote>Better than the American Century or the Pax Americana, the notion of an American Lebensraum captures the specific and global historical geography of U.S. ascension to power. After World War II, global power would no longer be measured in terms of colonized land or power over territory. Rather, global power was measured in directly economic terms. Trade and markets now figured as the economic nexuses of global power, a shift confirmed in the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement, which not only inaugurated an international currency system but also established two central banking institutions\u2014the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank\u2014to oversee the global economy.

Soviet actions in Poland and Czechoslovakia led his successor Harry Truman to reconsider. Heavily influenced by [[George Kennan]], Washington policymakers believed that the Soviet Union was an expansionary dictatorship that threatened American interests. In their theory, Moscow's weakness was that it had to keep expanding to survive; and that, by containing or stopping its growth, stability could be achieved in Europe. The result was the [[Truman Doctrine]] (1947) regarding Greece and Turkey. A second equally important consideration was the need to restore the world economy, which required the rebuilding and reorganizing of Europe for growth. This matter, more than the Soviet threat, was the main impetus behind the [[Marshall Plan]] of 1948. A third factor was the realization, especially by Britain and the three [[Benelux]] nations, that American military involvement was needed {{for what?|date=July 2019}}.

The United States decision to colonize some of the Pacific islands (which had formerly been held by the Japanese) in the 1940s ran directly counter to America's rhetoric against imperialism. The functioning of the Grand Area and the Open Door in Asia meant a new \u201cimperial internationalism\u201d wherein wars were fought to ensure a steady supply of raw materials from the [[world-system|global periphery]] to the core society in the United States and Western Europe. In this spirit, General Douglas MacArthur described the Pacific as an \u201cAnglo-Saxon lake.\u201d At the same time, the U.S. did not claim state control over much mainland territory but cultivated friendly members of the elites of decolonized countries\u2014elites which were usually dictatorial, as in South Korea, [[Suharto|Indonesia]], and South Vietnam.\n\nIn South Korea, the U.S. quickly allied with [[Syngman Rhee]], leader of the fight against the [[People's Republic of Korea|popularly established committees]] that proclaimed a provisional government. The mass call for an independent and unified Korean government was bloodily repressed by Rhee's forces, which were overseen by the U.S. Army.

Imperialist foreign policy was controversial with the American public, and domestic opposition allowed Cuban independence, though in the early 20th century the U.S. obtained the [[Panama Canal Zone]] and occupied Haiti and the Dominican Republic.  The United States returned to strong non-interventionist policy after World War I, including with the [[Good Neighbor policy]] for Latin America. After fighting World War II, it administered many Pacific islands captured during the fight against Japan. Partly to prevent the militaries of those countries from growing threateningly large, and partly to contain the Soviet Union, the United States promised to defend Germany (which is also part of [[NATO]]) and Japan (through the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan]]) which it had formerly defeated in war and which are now independent democracies. It maintains substantial military bases in both.\n\nThe [[Cold War]] reoriented American foreign policy towards opposing communism, and prevailing U.S. foreign policy embraced its role as a nuclear-armed global [[superpower]]. Though the [[Truman Doctrine]] and [[Reagan Doctrine]] framed the mission as protecting free peoples against an undemocratic system, anti-Soviet foreign policy became coercive and occasionally covert. [[United States involvement in regime change]] included [[1953 Iranian coup d'\u00e9tat|overthrowing the democratically elected government of Iran]], the [[Bay of Pigs invasion]] in Cuba, occupation of [[Grenada]], and interference in various foreign elections.

The remainder of acquired territories have become independent with varying degrees of cooperation, ranging from three [[freely associated states]] which participate in federal government programs in exchange for military basing rights, to Cuba which severed diplomatic relations during the Cold War. The United States was a public advocate for European [[decolonization]] after World War II (having started a ten-year independence transition for the Philippines in 1934 with the [[Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act]]).

Walker failed in all his escapades and never had official U.S. backing. Historian Michel Gobat, however, presents a strongly revisionist interpretation. He argues that Walker was invited in by Nicaraguan liberals who were trying to force economic modernization and political liberalism. Walker's government comprised those liberals, as well as Yankee colonizers, and European radicals. Walker even included some local Catholics as well as indigenous peoples, Cuban revolutionaries, and local peasants. His coalition was much too complex and diverse to survive long, but it was not the attempted projection of American power, concludes Gobat.<ref>Michel Gobat, ''Empire by Invitation:  William Walker and Manifest Destiny in Central America'' (Harvard UP, 2018).

American rule in Haiti continued through 1942, but was initiated during World War I. The historian Mary Renda in her book, ''Taking Haiti'', talks about the American invasion of Haiti to bring about political stability through U.S. control. The American government did not believe Haiti was ready for self-government or democracy, according to Renda. In order to bring about political stability in Haiti, the United States secured control and integrated the country into the international capitalist economy, while preventing Haiti from practicing self-governance or democracy. While Haiti had been running their own government for many years before American intervention, the U.S. government regarded Haiti as unfit for self-rule. In order to convince the American public of the justice in intervening, the United States government used [[paternalism|paternalist]] propaganda, depicting the Haitian political process as uncivilized. The Haitian government would come to agree to U.S. terms, including American overseeing of the Haitian economy. This direct supervision of the Haitian economy would reinforce U.S. propaganda and further entrench the perception of Haitians' being incompetent of self-governance.<ref>Renda, \"Introduction,\" in ''Taking Haiti: Military Occupation & the Culture of U.S. Imperialism, 1915\u20131940'', pp. 10\u201322, 29\u201334</ref>\n\nIn [[World War I]], the US, Britain, and Russia had been allies for seven months, from April 1917 until the [[Bolshevik]]s seized power in Russia in November.

Ultimately, Soviet head of state [[V.I. Lenin]] decided the Bolsheviks would settle peacefully with the [[Central Powers]] at the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. This separate peace led to Allied disdain for the Soviets, since it left the [[Allies of World War I|Western Allies]] to fight Germany without a strong Eastern partner.

In a wide sense, commerce is the mother of all wars.\u201d In 1942 this economic globalism was articulated as the \u201cGrand Area\u201d concept in secret documents. The US would have to have control over the \u201cWestern Hemisphere, Continental Europe and Mediterranean Basin (excluding Russia), the Pacific Area and the Far East, and the [[British Empire in World War II|British Empire]] (excluding Canada).\u201d The Grand Area encompassed all known major oil-bearing areas outside the Soviet Union, largely at the behest of corporate partners like the Foreign Oil Committee and the Petroleum Industry War Council.<ref>George A.

This postwar vision originated in the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] (CFR), an economic elite-led organization that became integrated into the government leadership. CFR's [[War and Peace Studies]] group offered its services to the State Department in 1939 and a secret partnership for post-war planning developed. CFR leaders [[Hamilton Fish Armstrong]] and Walter H. Mallory saw World War II as a \u201cgrand opportunity\u201d for the U.S. to emerge as \"the premier power in the world.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/americanempirero0000smit|url-access=registration|quote=grand opportunity.|title=American Empire: Roosevelt's Geographer and the Prelude to Globalization|first=Neil|last=Smith|date=October 29, 2004|publisher=University of California Press|via=Internet Archive|isbn=9780520243385}}</ref>\n\nThis vision of empire assumed the necessity of the U.S. to \u201cpolice the world\u201d in the aftermath of the war. This was not done primarily out of altruism, but out of economic interest. [[Isaiah Bowman]], a key liaison between the CFR and the State Department, proposed an \u201cAmerican economic [[Lebensraum]].\u201d This built upon the ideas of [[Time-Life]] publisher [[Henry Luce]], who (in his \u201c[[American Century]]\u201d essay) wrote, \u201cTyrannies may require a large amount of living space [but] freedom requires and will require far greater living space than Tyranny.\u201d According to Bowman's biographer, [[Neil Smith (geographer)|Neil Smith]]:\n\n<blockquote>Better than the American Century or the Pax Americana, the notion of an American Lebensraum captures the specific and global historical geography of U.S. ascension to power. After World War II, global power would no longer be measured in terms of colonized land or power over territory. Rather, global power was measured in directly economic terms. Trade and markets now figured as the economic nexuses of global power, a shift confirmed in the 1944 Bretton Woods agreement, which not only inaugurated an international currency system but also established two central banking institutions\u2014the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank\u2014to oversee the global economy.

Soviet actions in Poland and Czechoslovakia led his successor Harry Truman to reconsider. Heavily influenced by [[George Kennan]], Washington policymakers believed that the Soviet Union was an expansionary dictatorship that threatened American interests. In their theory, Moscow's weakness was that it had to keep expanding to survive; and that, by containing or stopping its growth, stability could be achieved in Europe. The result was the [[Truman Doctrine]] (1947) regarding Greece and Turkey. A second equally important consideration was the need to restore the world economy, which required the rebuilding and reorganizing of Europe for growth. This matter, more than the Soviet threat, was the main impetus behind the [[Marshall Plan]] of 1948. A third factor was the realization, especially by Britain and the three [[Benelux]] nations, that American military involvement was needed {{for what?|date=July 2019}}.

The United States decision to colonize some of the Pacific islands (which had formerly been held by the Japanese) in the 1940s ran directly counter to America's rhetoric against imperialism. The functioning of the Grand Area and the Open Door in Asia meant a new \u201cimperial internationalism\u201d wherein wars were fought to ensure a steady supply of raw materials from the [[world-system|global periphery]] to the core society in the United States and Western Europe. In this spirit, General Douglas MacArthur described the Pacific as an \u201cAnglo-Saxon lake.\u201d At the same time, the U.S. did not claim state control over much mainland territory but cultivated friendly members of the elites of decolonized countries\u2014elites which were usually dictatorial, as in South Korea, [[Suharto|Indonesia]], and South Vietnam.\n\nIn South Korea, the U.S. quickly allied with [[Syngman Rhee]], leader of the fight against the [[People's Republic of Korea|popularly established committees]] that proclaimed a provisional government.

{"title_page": "Oilseed press", "text_new": "{{Orphan|date=December 2014}}\n\nAn '''oilseed press''' is a machine that lies at the center of [[vegetable oil]] extraction. This is due to the fact that this technology is designed to release oil from [[oilseeds]]. Multiple oilseed press layouts have been developed over time to complete this process, with each having its own distinct set of advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, the products that are created by oilseed presses, namely oil and oilseed meal, possess great nutritive benefits for humans and livestock respectively. The oilseed press, being at the center of the oil-extraction process, is joined with various other pieces of equipment and procedures that form a pre- and post-extraction system.\n\n== Oilseed press designs ==\nBreaking it down to its simplest formulation, the process that oilseed presses carry out appears is quite simple. Oilseed presses essentially extrude or \u2018press\u2019 [[vegetable oil]] from oil-bearing seeds, which include [[soybean]], [[sunflower]], [[peanut]], [[safflower]], [[canola]], [[sesame]], [[Guizotia abyssinica|niger]], [[castor bean]], [[linseed]], [[Mustard plant|mustard]], [[coconut]], [[olive]], and [[oil palm]].<ref name=\"FAO 2010a\">{{cite web|last1=FAO|title=Classification of Crops|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/ess/documents/world_census_of_agriculture/appendix3_r7.pdf|publisher=FAO|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=2010}}</ref> The simplicity of this procedure is shadowed by the diversity of oilseed press designs that perform it. As seen in Table 1, oilseed press designs can be placed into the three major classes of traditional, manual, and mechanical presses.<ref name=\"Axtell & Fairman, 1992\">{{cite web|last1=Axtell|first1=B|last2=Fairman|first2=R|title=Principles of Extraction|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5043e/x5043E03.htm|website=Minor Oil Crops|publisher=FAO|accessdate=1 November 2014|date=1992}}</ref> \n \nTraditional presses include ghanis, water extraction systems, and other methods.<ref name=\"Axtell & Fairman, 1992\" /> Aside from the ghani, these designs are generally low yielding and particularly labour intensive.<ref name=\"Axtell & Fairman, 1992\" /><ref name=\"(Head et al., 1995)\">{{cite web|last1=Head|first1=S|last2=Swetman|first2=A|last3=Hammonds|first3=T|last4=Gordon|first4=A|last5=Southwell|first5=K|last6=Harris|first6=R|title=Small Scale Vegetable Oil Extraction|url=http://collections.infocollections.org/ukedu/en/d/Jnr18se/1.html|website=Ukrainian Library for Schools|publisher=NRI|date=195}}</ref> Moreover, all the traditional forms mentioned operate on a batch system. This entails that only a given amount of oilseed can be processed at a given time and, when the oil has been extracted, the pressed oilseed must be cleaned out of the machine.<ref name=\"Herkes et al., 2012\">{{cite web|last1=Herkes|first1=J|last2=Grubinger|first2=V|last3=Schumacher|first3=J|last4=Thompson|first4=J|title=Mechanical Extraction Processing Technology for Biodiesel|url=http://www.extension.org/pages/26911/mechanical-extraction-processing-technology-for-biodiesel#.VHNEG4vF-YL|website=eXtension|publisher=Extension|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=2012}}</ref> Despite these setbacks, traditional oilseed presses are basic in their design and are composed of easily obtainable or easy-to-manufacture equipment.<ref name=\"(Head et al., 1995)\" />\n\nAs for manual presses, cage style and [[ram press (food)|ram presses]] are the general layouts.<ref name=\"Axtell & Fairman, 1992\" /> While cage presses operate on a tedious batch system,<ref name=\"(Head et al., 1995)\" /> the operation of ram presses is continuous.<ref name=\"(Head et al., 1995)\" /><ref name=\"Herkes et al., 2012\" /> The latter point about the ram press design is joined by multiple other advantages that are listed in Table 1. These advantages are especially attractive for developing nations.\n\nThe final major class of oilseed presses, the powered press, is dominated by the expeller.

Multiple oilseed press layouts have been developed over time to complete this process, with each having its own distinct set of advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, the products that are created by oilseed presses, namely oil and oilseed meal, possess great nutritive benefits for humans and livestock respectively.
