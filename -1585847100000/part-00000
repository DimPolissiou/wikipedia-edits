As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution as there could be a false-positive reaction if someone is previously exposed to non-pathogenic ''B. thailandensis''.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> [[Latex agglutination]] is useful in screening for suspected ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> A commercial [[ELISA]] kit for melioidosis appears to perform well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Limmathurotsakul D, Chantratita N, Teerawattanasook N, et al |title= Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Diagnosis of Melioidosis: Better Than We Thought|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1024&ndash;1028|pmid=21460318|doi=10.1093/cid/cir080|pmc=3070030}}</ref> but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Peacock SJ, Cheng AC, Currie BJ, Dance DA|title=The Use of Positive Serological Tests as Evidence of Exposure to ''Burkholderia pseudomallei''|journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2011|volume=84|issue=6|pages= 1021&ndash;1022|pmid=21633045|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2011.11-0114a| pmc=3110358}}</ref>\n\nIt is not possible to diagnose melioidosis on imaging studies alone<ref name=\"Lim2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Lim KS, Chong VH |title=Radiological manifestations of melioidosis|journal=Clinical Radiology|year=2010|volume=65|issue=1|pmid=20103424|pages=66&ndash;72|doi=10.1016/j.crad.2009.08.008}}</ref> (such as [[X-rays]], ultrasound, and CT scans),<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/><ref name=\"Lim2010\"/> but imaging is routinely performed to assess the extent of disease spread.<ref name=\"Muttarak2008\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Muttarak M, Peh WC, Euathrongchit J, Lin SE, Tan AG, Lerttumnongtum P, Sivasomboon C |title=Spectrum of imaging findings in melioidosis|journal= British Journal of Radiology|year=2008|pmid=19098086|volume=82|issue=978|pages=514\u2013521|doi=10.1259/bjr/15785231}}</ref> Imaging of the abdomen using CT scans or ultrasound is recommended routinely, as abscesses may not be clinically apparent and may coexist with disease elsewhere.

They subsequently developed melioidosis pneumonia. Involvement of lymph nodes in the [[mediastinum]] can occur in pneumonia caused by melioidosis. Animal studies have also shown that inhalation is associated with a high rate of death.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''B. pseudomallei'' has the ability to infect various types of cells and to evade human immune responses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial_secretion_system#Type_III_secretion_system_(T3SS_or_TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type_V_secretion_system_.28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> \n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow.

The earliest symptoms may include a [[failure to thrive]] and a localized [[scleroderma]]-like skin condition. As a child ages past infancy, additional conditions become apparent usually around 18\u201324 months. Limited growth, full-body [[alopecia]] (hair loss), and a distinctive appearance (a small face with a shallow recessed jaw, and a pinched nose) are all characteristics of progeria.<ref name=NORD2014/> Signs and symptoms of this progressive disease tend to become more marked as the child ages. Later, the condition causes wrinkled skin, [[atherosclerosis]], kidney failure, loss of eyesight, and [[cardiovascular]] problems. Scleroderma, a hardening and tightening of the skin on trunk and extremities of the body, is prevalent. People diagnosed with this disorder usually have small, fragile bodies, like those of elderly people. The head is usually large in relation to the body, with a narrow, wrinkled face and a beak nose. Prominent scalp veins are noticeable (made more obvious by alopecia), as well as prominent eyes. Musculoskeletal degeneration causes loss of body fat and muscle, stiff joints, hip dislocations, and other symptoms generally absent in the non-elderly population. Individuals usually retain typical mental and motor development.\n\n==Cause==\nProgeria is caused by mutations that weaken the structure of the cell nucleus, making normal cell division difficult. The histone mark [[H4K20me3]] is involved in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome  caused by de novo mutations that occurs in a gene that encodes [[lamin A]]. Lamin A is made but isn't processed properly. This poor processing creates an abnormal nuclear morphology and disorganized [[heterochromatin]]. Patients also don't have appropriate DNA repair, and they also have increased genomic instability.<ref name=\"aging\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000357206 |pmid=24603298 |title=Epigenetic Involvement in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome: A Mini-Review |journal=Gerontology |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=197\u2013203 |year=2014 |last1=Arancio |first1=Walter |last2=Pizzolanti |first2=Giuseppe |last3=Genovese |first3=Swonild I. |last4=Pitrone |first4=Maria |last5=Giordano |first5=Carla }}</ref>\n\nIn normal conditions, the ''[[LMNA]]'' gene codes for a structural protein called prelamin A, which undergoes a series of processing steps before attaining its final form, called lamin A.<ref name=ghr>[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/LMNA LMNA] {{color|green|At}} [http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/BrowseGenes Genes] {{color|green|At}} [http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/ Genetics Home Reference]</ref> Prelamiln A contains a \u201cCAAX\u201dwhere C is a cysteine, an aliphatic amino acid, and X any amino acid. This motif at the [[Carboxyl-terminal|carboxyl-termini]] of proteins triggers three sequential enzymatic modifications. First, protein [[farnesyltransferase]] catalyzes the addition of a farnesyl moiety to the cysteine. Second, an endoprotease that recognizes the farnesylated protein catalyzes cleavage of the peptide bond between the cysteine and -aaX. In the third step, isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase catalyzes methylation of the carboxyl-terminal farnesylcysteine. The [[Farnesylation|farnesylated]] and methylated protein is [[Protein transport|transported]] through a [[nuclear pore]] to the [[Nucleoplasm|interior of the nucleus]]. Once in the nucleus, the protein is [[Proteolysis|cleaved]] by a [[protease]] called zinc metallopeptidase STE24 ([[ZMPSTE24]]), which removes the last 15 amino acids, which includes the farnesylated cysteine. After cleavage by the protease, prelamin A is referred to as [[lamin A]]. In most mammalian cells, lamin A, along with lamin B1, lamin B2 and lamin C, makes up the [[nuclear lamina]], which provides structural support to the nucleus.\n\nBefore the late 20th century, research on progeria yielded very little information about the syndrome. In 2003, the cause of progeria was discovered to be a [[point mutation]] in position 1824 of the ''LMNA'' gene, which replaces a cytosine with thymine.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = De Sandre-Giovannoli | first1 = A. | last2 = Bernard | first2 = R. | last3 = Cau | first3 = P. | last4 = Navarro | first4 = C. | last5 = Amiel | first5 = J. | last6 = Boccaccio | first6 = I. | last7 = Lyonnet | first7 = S. | last8 = Stewart | first8 = CL. | last9 = Munnich | first9 = A. | last10 = Le Merrer | first10 = M. | last11 = L\u00e9vy | first11 = N | title = Lamin a truncation in Hutchinson\u2013Gilford progeria | journal = Science | volume = 300 | issue = 5628 | page = 2055 |date=Jun 2003 | doi = 10.1126/science.1084125 | pmid = 12702809 | display-authors = 8 }}</ref> This mutation creates a 5' [[cryptic splice site]] within [[exon]] 11, resulting in a shorter than normal mRNA transcript.

The earliest symptoms may include a [[failure to thrive]] and a localized [[scleroderma]]-like skin condition. As a child ages past infancy, additional conditions become apparent usually around 18\u201324 months. Limited growth, full-body [[alopecia]] (hair loss), and a distinctive appearance (a small face with a shallow recessed jaw, and a pinched nose) are all characteristics of progeria.<ref name=NORD2014/> Signs and symptoms of this progressive disease tend to become more marked as the child ages. Later, the condition causes wrinkled skin, [[atherosclerosis]], kidney failure, loss of eyesight, and [[cardiovascular]] problems. Scleroderma, a hardening and tightening of the skin on trunk and extremities of the body, is prevalent. People diagnosed with this disorder usually have small, fragile bodies, like those of elderly people. The head is usually large in relation to the body, with a narrow, wrinkled face and a beak nose. Prominent scalp veins are noticeable (made more obvious by alopecia), as well as prominent eyes. Musculoskeletal degeneration causes loss of body fat and muscle, stiff joints, hip dislocations, and other symptoms generally absent in the non-elderly population. Individuals usually retain typical mental and motor development.\n\n==Cause==\nProgeria is caused by mutations that weaken the structure of the cell nucleus, making normal cell division difficult. The histone mark [[H4K20me3]] is involved in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria syndrome  caused by de novo mutations that occurs in a gene that encodes [[lamin A]]. Lamin A is made but isn't processed properly. This poor processing creates an abnormal nuclear morphology and disorganized [[heterochromatin]]. Patients also don't have appropriate DNA repair, and they also have increased genomic instability.<ref name=\"aging\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000357206 |pmid=24603298 |title=Epigenetic Involvement in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome: A Mini-Review |journal=Gerontology |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=197\u2013203 |year=2014 |last1=Arancio |first1=Walter |last2=Pizzolanti |first2=Giuseppe |last3=Genovese |first3=Swonild I. |last4=Pitrone |first4=Maria |last5=Giordano |first5=Carla }}</ref>\n\nIn normal conditions, the ''[[LMNA]]'' gene codes for a structural protein called prelamin A, which undergoes a series of processing steps before attaining its final form, called lamin A.<ref name=ghr>[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/LMNA LMNA] {{color|green|At}} [http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/BrowseGenes Genes] {{color|green|At}} [http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/ Genetics Home Reference]</ref> Prelamiln A contains a \u201cCAAX\u201dwhere C is a cysteine, an aliphatic amino acid, and X any amino acid. This motif at the [[Carboxyl-terminal|carboxyl-termini]] of proteins triggers three sequential enzymatic modifications. First, protein [[farnesyltransferase]] catalyzes the addition of a farnesyl moiety to the cysteine. Second, an endoprotease that recognizes the farnesylated protein catalyzes cleavage of the peptide bond between the cysteine and -aaX. In the third step, isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase catalyzes methylation of the carboxyl-terminal farnesylcysteine. The [[Farnesylation|farnesylated]] and methylated protein is [[Protein transport|transported]] through a [[nuclear pore]] to the [[Nucleoplasm|interior of the nucleus]]. Once in the nucleus, the protein is [[Proteolysis|cleaved]] by a [[protease]] called zinc metallopeptidase STE24 ([[ZMPSTE24]]), which removes the last 15 amino acids, which includes the farnesylated cysteine. After cleavage by the protease, prelamin A is referred to as [[lamin A]]. In most mammalian cells, lamin A, along with lamin B1, lamin B2 and lamin C, makes up the [[nuclear lamina]], which provides structural support to the nucleus.\n\nBefore the late 20th century, research on progeria yielded very little information about the syndrome. In 2003, the cause of progeria was discovered to be a [[point mutation]] in position 1824 of the ''LMNA'' gene, which replaces a cytosine with thymine.<ref>{{Cite journal  | last1 = De Sandre-Giovannoli | first1 = A. | last2 = Bernard | first2 = R. | last3 = Cau | first3 = P. | last4 = Navarro | first4 = C. | last5 = Amiel | first5 = J. | last6 = Boccaccio | first6 = I. | last7 = Lyonnet | first7 = S. | last8 = Stewart | first8 = CL. | last9 = Munnich | first9 = A. | last10 = Le Merrer | first10 = M. | last11 = L\u00e9vy | first11 = N | title = Lamin a truncation in Hutchinson\u2013Gilford progeria | journal = Science | volume = 300 | issue = 5628 | page = 2055 |date=Jun 2003 | doi = 10.1126/science.1084125 | pmid = 12702809 | display-authors = 8 }}</ref> This mutation creates a 5' [[cryptic splice site]] within [[exon]] 11, resulting in a shorter than normal mRNA transcript.

{"title_page": "Rundling", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2017}}\nA '''''Rundling''''' is a form of circular village, mainly in Germany, typical of settlements in the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]]-[[Slavic peoples|Slav]] contact zone in the [[Early Medieval]] period.<ref>{{Dickinson's Germany|page=146}}</ref>\n[[File:RundlingSatemin2.jpg|thumb|View of the ''Rundling'' Satemin, 3 km west of [[L\u00fcchow]] in the [[L\u00fcchow-Dannenberg|Wendland]]]]\nThe ''Rundling'' was a relatively common village form used by the [[Slavs]]. It usually comprises a central, circular [[village green]] owned in common with individually owned [[farm house|farmstead]]s radiating out around it like the spokes of a wheel. The best examples are now only in a small area of [[Lower Saxony]] in Germany near to the town of [[L\u00fcchow]]. 15 of these villages have been put forward as an ensemble for consideration as possible World Heritage Sites, and a decision is expected in the next few years.\n\nAt the City Hall Oslo on 11 June 2015 the Rundlingsverein were awarded the Grand Prix for the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage/Europa Nostra Award 2015. This was in recognition of 46 years of voluntary work in preserving these ancient settlements.\n\nSuch villages were originally found across a strip of central Germany from [[Kiel]] to [[Bohemia]] (where they are variously referred to as a ''Rundling, Runddorf, Rundlingsdorf, Rundplatzdorf'' or ''Platzdorf''), often indicated by village names ending in ''-itz'', ''-ow'' and ''-thin''. Virtually all such Rundlinge are now only to be found in the small area of Wendland.\n\n==History and origins ==\n\nThere are no contemporary historical records of the founding of these circular villages, but a consensus has arisen in recent decades that they were founded in the 12th century, on land that had not been previously cultivated, probably because of its essentially low lying boggy nature, its tendency to be flooded and the relative poverty of its sandy soil. The current leading theory is that of Professor Dr Wolfgang Meibeyer, who believes that all the ''Rundlinge'' were developed at more or less the same time in the 12th century, to a model developed by the then [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[German nobility|nobility]] as suitable for small groups of mainly [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[farm-settler]]s. Whether these [[settler]]s were there by choice, by conquest or by forced settlement is no longer known. It does seem to have happened without much bloodshed, and the following centuries showed a living together of Germans and Slavs. This eventually led to an assimilation and eventual disappearance of the Slavs as a separate ethnic group with their own language, [[Sorbian languages|Wendish]] (''Wendisch'') or [[Polabian language|Polabian]] (''drav\u00e4nopolabisch''), which is the language used for the majority of the ''Rundling'' names, and still to this day for certain unusual features of local rural architecture and land-use. This separate Slavic language did however remain more generally in use in the region of L\u00fcchow until the 18th century, and there is a written chronicle and dictionary still in existence drawn up by Johann Parum Schultze of the village of S\u00fcthen, in around 1725, which marks the increasing loss of the old language. The area of its historical use is now often called [[Wends|Wendland]] after those Slavic peoples who were called the [[Wends]], and it corresponds more or less with the current administrative boundaries of the district of [[L\u00fcchow-Dannenberg]]. Two related Slavic ethnic groups were the ''Wenden'' of the [[Spreewald]] and the [[Lusatian Sorbs]] of [[Upper Lusatia]] (''Oberlausitz''), together making a group of about 60,000 who still are said to be able to speak [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] in the Spreewald, an area of Eastern Germany near the Polish border around the towns of [[Bautzen]] and [[Cottbus]].\n\n== Slavic or German? ==\n\n''Rundlinge'' are therefore closely related to the existence of the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] ethnic group of the [[Wends]], but seem to have been a German invention. There is absolutely no evidence that the round form of those early settlements was essentially Slavic in origin, as many once assumed. They arose as part of [[Henry the Lion]]'s eastern [[colonization]] (''[[Ostsiedlung]]'') in the mid 12th century. It seems that the [[German nobility]] hit upon the idea of creating new villages in the form of a half circle or a horseshoe shape, with the wide entrance to the central village green opening out to the fields. It has been speculated though that this model could have been based on a form of settlement dating from at least the 7th century. In our later form each farmer would have an equally sized wedge-shaped piece of land on which to build their houses, so that the basic outline of the village is that of a half a circular cake cut into slices. Behind each farmer's plot would be their own personal wood as a source of firewood, foraging for farm animals and at times of crisis for building materials. This would usually be on somewhat lower ground, and often had a stream running through it, or by it. Slavic [[Pottery|ceramics]] have been found but not directly in the ''Rundlinge'', more usually a few hundred metres outside of them. A continuation of Slavic settlement perhaps in a new Germanic form remains therefore a possibility. Proof one way or another will only come from more comprehensive [[archaeological]] examinations perhaps of those ''Rundlinge'' known to have been deserted in earlier centuries.\n\n== Appearance ==\n[[File:Rundplatzdorf.svg|thumb|Schematic diagram of a ''Rundling'' with its access track]]\nThese villages were usually small, with only a few [[farm house|farmsteads]], averaging perhaps around 5\u20137, and built away from tracks or roads, around an open central [[village green]], which was a part of the [[commons]], not allocated to any one particular farmer. The leading farmer, called a ''Schulze'', had a slightly better plot, set in the centre opposite the entrance to the village, and usually extra land outside the circle called by its Wendish name ''G\u00fcsteneitz''. They are almost always to be found on the border between low-lying wetter land near to water and higher drier land more suitable for cultivation, called here [[geest]]. The villages were fairly densely scattered across the area to be colonized, with each one barely a kilometre from its neighbour. This means that there were very many, fairly small, settlements. In very very few cases have they been amalgamated into larger villages or subsumed as suburbs of towns.\nEven today this pattern has continued. Of the 324 named settlements in today's [[L\u00fcchow-Dannenberg]], over 200 are or were once ''Rundlinge'', and virtually none have been swallowed up by the encroachment of towns, or have been amalgamated into larger villages, although since the reforms of 1972, most have lost their political separateness. Prior to 1972 each village had its own separate political status, which led to there being 230 entities, ''[[Gemeinde (Germany)|Gemeinden]]'', in what was then and still is one of the most sparsely settled areas of modern Germany, East or West. The smallest of the 230 was [[Liepeh\u00f6fen]], which had the princely number of 3 adult voters! Instead of 230 there are today a more reasonable 27 ''Gemeinden''.\n\n== Subsequent circular shape ==\n\nThe original shape of the ''Rundlinge'' was semi-circular or horse-shoe shaped. Most became circular through a period of time in the later [[Middle Ages]], probably between 1500 and 1550, when population densities increased. This led to the original farmsteads being split into two, three or four, and additional wedge-shaped land being made available at the open entrance to the village, in effect closing the village in and allowing only one track in from outside. This development appears to have been ordained from above, rather than being the result of more than one son taking over a farmstead. This gives us the tightly packed Rundling of today with up to 20 farmsteads. The greater prosperity, and therefore greater population density of the ''Rundlinge'' of those times may have been related to the increasing addition of [[flax]]-[[weaving]] to the incomes of the farmers. In any event most of the originally semi-circular villages became more nearly circular, although there were in fact many slightly differently shaped solutions. Some of the ''Rundlinge'' today are more oval in shape, others more irregularly shaped. The original \"one entrance to the village green\" model was in some cases altered to take account, say, of a path to the local church or one to the local [[watermill|mill]], and in later years these paths may have been widened to take vehicles, and may today form a route through the village.\nAlthough very many ''Rundlinge'' of today have retained their separateness, many have expanded during the last century and have modern houses added, typically in one direction away from the original round. This occasionally leads to an elongated village with the old ''Rundling'' at the end.\n\n== External location of churches ==\n\nOne anomaly, which marks out these villages from others in other parts of Europe, is that the ''Rundling'' villages virtually never have a church in them. There are churches, even quite ancient ones, but they and their [[burial ground]]s are almost always well outside the ''Rundling'' itself. This could have come about because the ''Rundlinge'' were usually built only just above the water-table, whereas the churches needed higher ground to give enough depth for their burials. It could also be as a result of each village being too small to maintain a church, so the church had to serve several villages. However most researchers believe that it shows that [[Christianisation]] came late to the villages, after their basic structure had been created. There are reports by the church authorities of {{linktext|heathen}} practices well into modern times.\nIt also suggests that, even where it had been possible to add a church to the village circle (even in the middle \u2013 why not?), they did not do so. There must have been a sense that it was not appropriate to do so, or there would be examples among the 200+ villages in Wendland, and there are not, even in the villages set on higher ground.\nNot only are there no churches, there are no schools or communal buildings, no shops and virtually no trade outlets. The villages are made up entirely of farm dwellings.\n\n== Rundling and Lower German Hall House ==\n[[File:Rundling Schreyahn.jpg|thumb|400px|The ''Rundling'' village of [[Schreyahn]] with its [[Low German hall house]]s]]\nAlthough the ''Rundling'' shape and the ''Rundling'' farmhouse architecture are two separate developments, with several hundred years between them, and which therefore need to be kept separate in our minds, it is the interplay between the two which makes the [[Wends|Wendland]] ''Rundlinge'' of today so attractive to the visitor.\nWe have seen that the ''Rundling'' form seems to have been a planned form of division of property in newly [[colonization|colonized]] areas east of [[Germanic peoples|Germanic lands]], and there are historically examples in a wide strip of land running from the [[Baltic Sea]] near [[Kiel]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]] down both sides of the [[Elbe]] river right down to the [[Czech Lands]] in the south. This corresponds to the [[Eastern Colonisation]] of [[Henry the Lion]] after 1147 and others in the so-called ''Wendenkreuzzug'', or [[Wendish crusade]], where the Pope had given his agreement to a northern crusade to conquer and convert the [[pagan]] Slavs, at the same time as others were taking part in southern crusades to retake [[Jerusalem]] from the [[Muslim Turks]].\nHowever the architecture of the much later mediaeval farmhouses to the south of [[Wittenberg]] was different from those in the north, and so different parts of the north\u2013south ''Rundling'' strip through Germany looked different as a result. The farmhouses of Wendland were a part of an enormous east\u2013west area running from parts of Eastern [[Netherlands]] across the [[North German plain]] to [[Poland]], where one form of [[farmhouse]] predominated. This was the area of the [[Low German Hall House]] (''Niederdeutsches Hallenhaus''), an all-in-one building of considerable size which housed not only the farmer and his family, but also most of his [[farmyard animal]]s, his [[hay loft]] and his implements. Typically the hall house had the animals and the [[barn]] buildings at the front facing the [[village green]], whereas the farmer lived at the back facing his garden or [[smallholding]]. The design of the house put the main open fire in the middle at the back of the barn area, the smoke disappearing through small apertures in the front facade.\nThe [[hall house]] was an invention of the North German plains, and did not exist to the south of a line from [[Dortmund]] to [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] to [[Wittenberg]] to [[Stettin]]. This meant that only about one tenth of its entire width crossed the strip of land running north to south that was part of the 12th century ''Wendenkreuzzug'', which created the ''Rundling'' form. Within this strip were the cities of Kiel, L\u00fcbeck and [[Hamburg]] and the four rural areas of [[Uelzen]], [[Wends|Wendland]], [[Prignitz]] and the [[Altmark]] around [[Salzwedel]].\n\n== Types of Lower German hall house ==\n\nThe three types of hall house are called after the number of rows of pillars which carry the roof construction. The oldest form, which would also have the lowest roof, was called a ''[[Zweist\u00e4nderhaus]]'' because the whole construction rested on two rows of pillars (front to back) carrying beams across the centre. They were pillars and not posts because they rested on stones and were not set in holes in the ground as their predecessors had been. A typical house might have 14 rows of pillars, with a corresponding 14 beams, each of them being originally a single oak tree. Nothing else is load-bearing, although the [[half-timbered]] construction with infill does give some extra stability. The infill these days is likely to be [[brickwork]], but was originally [[wattle and daub]], covered with a [[lime (material)|lime]] mixture. The oldest house in Wendland of this construction is around 1611, but only about 10 are 17th century in origin, most of the others being 18th century. They are comparatively rare, as less than 80 remain in Wendland.\nThe more recent form which became common throughout the 19th century is called in German ''[[Vierst\u00e4nderhaus]]'' which means that the roof construction is carried by four rows of pillars carrying beams. This means that the central barn area is narrower than for ''Zweist\u00e4nderh\u00e4user'' but the two single storey sides are larger. The overall building will also be larger, and are sometimes three stories high, or have two stories with much larger hay lofts and storage above the barn.\nThere is a third form which is called a ''[[Dreist\u00e4nderhaus]]'', with three rows of pillars. This looks like a two pillar-row house on one side, with lower eaves, and a four pillar-row house with higher eaves on the other. It also looks lopsided because the barn door is no longer central under the roof apex. This hybrid form can be found across all the eras but was commoner during the 18th century. It is commoner in Wendland than almost anywhere else across Northern Germany (although even here there are only 40 surviving examples), and there are two Wendland villages, Prie\u00dfeck and P\u00fcggen, where it is the commonest form. It does not appear to be a transition between the two and the four pillar-row models but a genuine attempt to get the best of two different models, an experiment which ultimately did not make it through to the very end of the 19th century when almost the last hall houses were being built.\n\n== Present extent ==\n\nWhy only Wendland should retain the ''Rundling'' form, plus the [[Lower German Hall House]], is not immediately clear, but will have more to do with the relative wealth of the cities to the north, which would have swallowed up the \"primitive\" ''Rundlinge'' and its \"primitive\" rural architecture over the centuries.\nIt is less easy to see why Uelzen, Prignitz and Salzwedel should have so few existing ''Rundlinge'', as they did have them as recently as the 1820\u20131850 series of enclosure maps, ''Verkoppelungskarten''. Prignitz, Salzwedel and the Altmark were politically parts of Prussia, and Wendland and Uelzen parts of the Kingdom of Hannover at this time. We know that the Government of Prussia had become alarmed at the numbers of fires caused by putting an open fire in the same building as the hay loft and a thatched roof, as well as the animals. They had therefore issued a decree in the early 18th century forbidding the building of traditional hall houses, and requiring farmers to separate out the functions of cooking and storage. This seems to have led to different solutions in [[Prussia]] from those traditional to the wider area, favouring ''[[Querdielenh\u00e4user]]'' or transverse farmhouses, with the barn entrance to the side. In the Altmark they also had the tradition of putting gatehouses across the fronts of their farmsteads, thus blocking the view of the large barn doors from the centre of the village green. \nIt is however probably as much poverty as decrees that led farmers to \"make do and mend\" rather than demolish their old houses and build new ones in their stead. And Wendland has always been at the poor end of the scale. This has continued right up to the present day, with its unfortunate position as part of the old [[West Germany]] sticking out into the old [[East Germany]], so that it was bound on three sides by an electric fence which was the barrier to the [[Communist]] East for most of the second half of the 20th century. Wendland has always somehow been passed by, right from the times of the early [[Christianisation]], and even today it has no motorways, virtually no railways, very little industry, very little employment and a shrinking population. If it is known for anything today, it is known for its decades-long fight against the deposit of radioactive waste in [[Gorleben]], a site chosen by the politicians of a generation ago precisely because so few people live there.\n\n== 20th century ==\n\nFrom the 1880s onwards began a time of greater prosperity in Germany, and this was reflected in Wendland too with the arrival of some industry. A few large brick buildings typical of the time called the ''[[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]]'' were built in the modern style, and were often faced sideways to the village green, but these were the exceptions. Most farmers had only enough spare to renovate their houses, occasionally replacing the half-timbering with brick, or tiling the outside to give better warmth inside. Most ''Rundlinge'' survived intact.\nUp to the [[Second World War]], the small scale farming of areas such as the Wendland was still just sustainable, although the domestic [[flax]] industry had by then disappeared. Briefly in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Wendland became home to very many refugees from the east, but the increasing pull of the industrialised parts of the new Federal Germany led to many moving on. The subsequent division of Germany into East and West affected Wendland a great deal, as it became isolated to the north, east and south by the [[Inner German Border]] for almost 40 years until 1989. This development, whilst largely negative for the region, had two major positives. Firstly the rural isolation of the ''Rundling'' villages was not affected negatively by industry or motorways, and secondly Wendland became a second home for a large number of [[West Berlin]]ers, who were anxious about their position, surrounded as they were on all sides by an unfriendly state. It was largely Berliners who invested in the old property of the Wendland, which was cheap and spacious. They rescued whole villages from certain ruin.\nAt the same time the local population, reflecting post-war prosperity, was embracing modernization, and pulling down old hall houses to replace them with far less sympathetic modern housing, which was cheaper to maintain and warmer in winter! This trend was noticed with alarm by many lovers of the old hall houses in their picturesque circular villages, and the ''Rundlingsverein'' was brought into existence in 1969 to educate the population to the potential loss of a heritage that had become unique not only in Germany but in the whole of Europe. It was those early pioneers that eventually stopped the old houses being demolished, thought through alternative uses for the buildings and supported the initiatives of the ''Denkmalpflege''<!-- is this the right name? Denkmalpflege is just a genera term for historic monument preservation... --> (the government agency for the protection of monuments in Germany) to preserve the [[cultural heritage]] of the ''Rundlinge'' and their [[Low German hall house|hall houses]].\n\n== ''Rundlinge'' today ==\n[[File:Museum Wendlandhof L\u00fcbeln.jpg|thumb|The ''Rundling'' museum of ''Wendlandhof'' in [[L\u00fcbeln]]]]\nHow many ''Rundlinge'' there are is a more difficult question to answer than one might think. Originally there were perhaps a thousand such villages created in the 12th and 13th centuries, perhaps 400 of which survived into the 19th century. In [[Hanoverian Wendland]] alone there is over 200 which were clearly still ''Rundlinge'' at the time of the ''Verkopplungskarten'' (a type of enclosure map, marking the ownership of land and property) in the early parts of the 19th century. Many had already succumbed to catastrophic fires, and been fully or partially rebuilt, not always as ''Rundlinge''. Modernization has led to the destruction of many of the older hall houses, and their replacement by modern housing, sometimes but not always affecting the circular structure of the villages.\n\nAt present the best guess{{or|date=November 2014}} is that about 80\u2013100 of these 200 villages in Wendland are still recognizable as ''Rundlinge'' to an untrained eye, and of these about 30 are of sufficient interest to tourists to warrant developing a tourist plan. This is currently a major interest because of the so far successful attempt by the [[Samtgemeinde L\u00fcchow]] to have the ''Rundlinge'' recognized by the [[UNESCO]] as a part of their [[World Heritage]] portfolio. The ''Rundlingsverein'', which has long supported the preservation of these unique villages for posterity, has recently put its weight behind the bid from the Samtgemeinde, and in a parallel action will take a structured analysis of all 200+ existing ''Rundlinge'' and former ''Rundlinge'', to record how much has been retained, and what corrective action needs to be taken to preserve them.\n\n==References==\n{{ref improve|date=May 2013}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Literature ==\n* [[Wolfgang Meibeyer]]: ''Rundlinge und andere D\u00f6rfer im Wendland'', Weddel, 2005, {{ISBN|3-9810610-0-4}}\n* Wolfgang Meibeyer: Rundlinge, Wendland-Lexikon, Band 2, L\u00fcchow 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-926322-45-6}}, pages 306\u2013312.\n* ''Rundlinge und Slawen, Beitr\u00e4ge zur Rundlingsforschung'', Hrsg.: Wolfgang J\u00fcrries, L\u00fcchow, 2004, {{ISBN|3-9806364-0-2}}\n* ''Rundlinge im Hannoverschen Wendland'' by the Society for the Preservation of Rundlings in the Hanoverian Wendland (''Verein zur Erhaltung von Rundlingen im Hannoverschen Wendland'')\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Rundlings}}\n*[http://www.rundlingsverein.de/html/80-Rundling_circular-village.htm Rundlinge \u2013 Circular Villages in Wendland], Adrian Greenwood, 25 September 2012\n\n{{European village types}}\n[[Category:Villages in Germany|*]]\n[[Category:Rural geography]]\n[[Category:Wendland]]\n[[Category:Settlement geography]]\n[[Category:Types of village]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2017}}\nA '''''Rundling''''' is a form of circular village, mainly in Germany, typical of settlements in the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]]-[[Slavic peoples|Slav]] contact zone in the [[Early Medieval]] period.<ref>{{Dickinson's Germany|page=146}}</ref>\n[[File:RundlingSatemin2.jpg|thumb|View of the ''Rundling'' Satemin, 3 km west of [[L\u00fcchow]] in the [[L\u00fcchow-Dannenberg|Wendland]]]]\nThe ''Rundling'' was a relatively common village form used by the [[Slavs]]. It usually comprises a central, circular [[village green]] owned in common with individually owned [[farm house|farmstead]]s radiating out around it like the spokes of a wheel.The best examples are now only in a small area of [[Lower Saxony]] in Germany near to the town of [[L\u00fcchow]]. 15 of these villages have been put forward as an ensemble for consideration as possible World Heritage Sites, and a decision is expected in the next few years.\n\nAt the City Hall Oslo on 11 June 2015 the Rundlingsverein were awarded the Grand Prix for the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage/Europa Nostra Award 2015. This was in recognition of 46 years of voluntary work in preserving these ancient settlements.\n\nSuch villages were originally found across a strip of central Germany from [[Kiel]] to [[Bohemia]] (where they are variously referred to as a ''Rundling, Runddorf, Rundlingsdorf, Rundplatzdorf'' or ''Platzdorf''), often indicated by village names ending in ''-itz'', ''-ow'' and ''-thin''. Virtually all such Rundlinge are now only to be found in the small area of Wendland.\n\n==History and origins ==\n\nThere are no contemporary historical records of the founding of these circular villages, but a consensus has arisen in recent decades that they were founded in the 12th century, on land that had not been previously cultivated, probably because of its essentially low lying boggy nature, its tendency to be flooded and the relative poverty of its sandy soil. The current leading theory is that of Professor Dr Wolfgang Meibeyer, who believes that all the ''Rundlinge'' were developed at more or less the same time in the 12th century, to a model developed by the then [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[German nobility|nobility]] as suitable for small groups of mainly [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[farm-settler]]s. Whether these [[settler]]s were there by choice, by conquest or by forced settlement is no longer known. It does seem to have happened without much bloodshed, and the following centuries showed a living together of Germans and Slavs. This eventually led to an assimilation and eventual disappearance of the Slavs as a separate ethnic group with their own language, [[Sorbian languages|Wendish]] (''Wendisch'') or [[Polabian language|Polabian]] (''drav\u00e4nopolabisch''), which is the language used for the majority of the ''Rundling'' names, and still to this day for certain unusual features of local rural architecture and land-use. This separate Slavic language did however remain more generally in use in the region of L\u00fcchow until the 18th century, and there is a written chronicle and dictionary still in existence drawn up by Johann Parum Schultze of the village of S\u00fcthen, in around 1725, which marks the increasing loss of the old language. The area of its historical use is now often called [[Wends|Wendland]] after those Slavic peoples who were called the [[Wends]], and it corresponds more or less with the current administrative boundaries of the district of [[L\u00fcchow-Dannenberg]]. Two related Slavic ethnic groups were the ''Wenden'' of the [[Spreewald]] and the [[Lusatian Sorbs]] of [[Upper Lusatia]] (''Oberlausitz''), together making a group of about 60,000 who still are said to be able to speak [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] in the Spreewald, an area of Eastern Germany near the Polish border around the towns of [[Bautzen]] and [[Cottbus]].\n\n== Slavic or German? ==\n\n''Rundlinge'' are therefore closely related to the existence of the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] ethnic group of the [[Wends]], but seem to have been a German invention.

The farmhouses of Wendland were a part of an enormous East-West area running from parts of Eastern [[Netherlands]] across the [[North German plain]] to [[Poland]], where one form of [[farmhouse]] predominated. This was the area of the [[Low German Hall House]] (''Niederdeutsches Hallenhaus''), an all-in-one building of considerable size which housed not only the farmer and his family, but also most of his [[farmyard animal]]s, his [[hay loft]] and his implements. Typically the hall house had the animals and the [[barn]] buildings at the front facing the [[village green]], whereas the farmer lived at the back facing his garden or [[smallholding]]. The design of the house put the main open fire in the middle at the back of the barn area, the smoke disappearing through small apertures in the front facade.\nThe [[hall house]] was an invention of the North German plains, and did not exist to the south of a line from [[Dortmund]] to [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] to [[Wittenberg]] to [[Stettin]]. This meant that only about one tenth of its entire width crossed the strip of land running north to south that was part of the 12th century ''Wendenkreuzzug'', which created the ''Rundling'' form. Within this strip were the cities of Kiel, L\u00fcbeck and [[Hamburg]] and the four rural areas of [[Uelzen]], [[Wends|Wendland]], [[Prignitz]] and the [[Altmark]] around [[Salzwedel]].\n\n== Types of Lower German hall house ==\n\nThe three types of hall house are called after the number of rows of pillars which carry the roof construction. The oldest form, which would also have the lowest roof, was called a ''[[Zweist\u00e4nderhaus]]'' because the whole construction rested on two rows of pillars (front to back) carrying beams across the centre. They were pillars and not posts because they rested on stones and were not set in holes in the ground as their predecessors had been. A typical house might have 14 rows of pillars, with a corresponding 14 beams, each of them being originally a single oak tree. Nothing else is load-bearing, although the [[half-timbered]] construction with infill does give some extra stability. The infill these days is likely to be [[brickwork]], but was originally [[wattle and daub]], covered with a [[lime (material)|lime]] mixture. The oldest house in Wendland of this construction is around 1611, but only about 10 are 17th century in origin, most of the others being 18th century. They are comparatively rare, as less than 80 remain in Wendland.\nThe more recent form which became common throughout the 19th century is called in German ''[[Vierst\u00e4nderhaus]]'' which means that the roof construction is carried by four rows of pillars carrying beams. This means that the central barn area is narrower than for ''Zweist\u00e4nderh\u00e4user'' but the two single storey sides are larger. The overall building will also be larger, and are sometimes three stories high, or have two stories with much larger hay lofts and storage above the barn.\nThere is a third form which is called a ''[[Dreist\u00e4nderhaus]]'', with three rows of pillars. This looks like a two pillar-row house on one side, with lower eaves, and a four pillar-row house with higher eaves on the other. It also looks lopsided because the barn door is no longer central under the roof apex. This hybrid form can be found across all the eras but was commoner during the 18th century. It is commoner in Wendland than almost anywhere else across Northern Germany (although even here there are only 40 surviving examples), and there are two Wendland villages, Prie\u00dfeck and P\u00fcggen, where it is the commonest form. It does not appear to be a transition between the two and the four pillar-row models but a genuine attempt to get the best of two different models, an experiment which ultimately did not make it through to the very end of the 19th century when almost the last hall houses were being built.\n\n== Present extent ==\n\nWhy only Wendland should retain the ''Rundling'' form, plus the [[Lower German Hall House]], is not immediately clear, but will have more to do with the relative wealth of the cities to the north, which would have swallowed up the \"primitive\" ''Rundlinge'' and its \"primitive\" rural architecture over the centuries.\nIt is less easy to see why Uelzen, Prignitz and Salzwedel should have so few existing ''Rundlinge'', as they did have them as recently as the 1820\u20131850 series of enclosure maps, ''Verkoppelungskarten''. Prignitz, Salzwedel and the Altmark were politically parts of Prussia, and Wendland and Uelzen parts of the Kingdom of Hannover at this time. We know that the Government of Prussia had become alarmed at the numbers of fires caused by putting an open fire in the same building as the hay loft and a thatched roof, as well as the animals. They had therefore issued a decree in the early 18th century forbidding the building of traditional hall houses, and requiring farmers to separate out the functions of cooking and storage. This seems to have led to different solutions in [[Prussia]] from those traditional to the wider area, favouring ''[[Querdielenh\u00e4user]]'' or transverse farmhouses, with the barn entrance to the side. In the Altmark they also had the tradition of putting gatehouses across the fronts of their farmsteads, thus blocking the view of the large barn doors from the centre of the village green. \nIt is however probably as much poverty as decrees that led farmers to \"make do and mend\" rather than demolish their old houses and build new ones in their stead. And Wendland has always been at the poor end of the scale. This has continued right up to the present day, with its unfortunate position as part of the old [[West Germany]] sticking out into the old [[East Germany]], so that it was bound on three sides by an electric fence which was the barrier to the [[Communist]] East for most of the second half of the 20th century. Wendland has always somehow been passed by, right from the times of the early [[Christianisation]], and even today it has no motorways, virtually no railways, very little industry, very little employment and a shrinking population. If it is known for anything today, it is known for its decades-long fight against the deposit of radioactive waste in [[Gorleben]], a site chosen by the politicians of a generation ago precisely because so few people live there.\n\n== 20th century ==\n\nFrom the 1880s onwards began a time of greater prosperity in Germany, and this was reflected in Wendland too with the arrival of some industry. A few large brick buildings typical of the time called the ''[[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]]'' were built in the modern style, and were often faced sideways to the village green, but these were the exceptions. Most farmers had only enough spare to renovate their houses, occasionally replacing the half-timbering with brick, or tiling the outside to give better warmth inside. Most ''Rundlinge'' survived intact.\nUp to the [[Second World War]], the small scale farming of areas such as the Wendland was still just sustainable, although the domestic [[flax]] industry had by then disappeared. Briefly in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Wendland became home to very many refugees from the east, but the increasing pull of the industrialised parts of the new Federal Germany led to many moving on. The subsequent division of Germany into East and West affected Wendland a great deal, as it became isolated to the north, east and south by the [[Inner German Border]] for almost 40 years until 1989. This development, whilst largely negative for the region, had two major positives. Firstly the rural isolation of the ''Rundling'' villages was not affected negatively by industry or motorways, and secondly Wendland became a second home for a large number of [[West Berlin]]ers, who were anxious about their position, surrounded as they were on all sides by an unfriendly state. It was largely Berliners who invested in the old property of the Wendland, which was cheap and spacious. They rescued whole villages from certain ruin.\nAt the same time the local population, reflecting post-war prosperity, was embracing modernization, and pulling down old hall houses to replace them with far less sympathetic modern housing, which was cheaper to maintain and warmer in winter! This trend was noticed with alarm by many lovers of the old hall houses in their picturesque circular villages, and the ''Rundlingsverein'' was brought into existence in 1969 to educate the population to the potential loss of a heritage that had become unique not only in Germany but in the whole of Europe. It was those early pioneers that eventually stopped the old houses being demolished, thought through alternative uses for the buildings and supported the initiatives of the ''Denkmalpflege''<!-- is this the right name? Denkmalpflege is just a genera term for historic monument preservation... --> (the government agency for the protection of monuments in Germany) to preserve the [[cultural heritage]] of the ''Rundlinge'' and their [[Low German hall house|hall houses]].\n\n== ''Rundlinge'' today ==\n[[File:Museum Wendlandhof L\u00fcbeln.jpg|thumb|The ''Rundling'' museum of ''Wendlandhof'' in [[L\u00fcbeln]]]]\nHow many ''Rundlinge'' there are is a more difficult question to answer than one might think. Originally there were perhaps a thousand such villages created in the 12th and 13th centuries, perhaps 400 of which survived into the 19th century. In [[Hanoverian Wendland]] alone there is over 200 which were clearly still ''Rundlinge'' at the time of the ''Verkopplungskarten'' (a type of enclosure map, marking the ownership of land and property) in the early parts of the 19th century. Many had already succumbed to catastrophic fires, and been fully or partially rebuilt, not always as ''Rundlinge''. Modernization has led to the destruction of many of the older hall houses, and their replacement by modern housing, sometimes but not always affecting the circular structure of the villages.\n\nAt present the best guess{{or|date=November 2014}} is that about 80\u2013100 of these 200 villages in Wendland are still recognizable as ''Rundlinge'' to an untrained eye, and of these about 30 are of sufficient interest to tourists to warrant developing a tourist plan. This is currently a major interest because of the so far successful attempt by the [[Samtgemeinde L\u00fcchow]] to have the ''Rundlinge'' recognized by the [[UNESCO]] as a part of their [[World Heritage]] portfolio. The ''Rundlingsverein'', which has long supported the preservation of these unique villages for posterity, has recently put its weight behind the bid from the Samtgemeinde, and in a parallel action will take a structured analysis of all 200+ existing ''Rundlinge'' and former ''Rundlinge'', to record how much has been retained, and what corrective action needs to be taken to preserve them.\n\n==References==\n{{ref improve|date=May 2013}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Literature ==\n* [[Wolfgang Meibeyer]]: ''Rundlinge und andere D\u00f6rfer im Wendland'', Weddel, 2005, {{ISBN|3-9810610-0-4}}\n* Wolfgang Meibeyer: Rundlinge, Wendland-Lexikon, Band 2, L\u00fcchow 2008, {{ISBN|978-3-926322-45-6}}, pages 306\u2013312.\n* ''Rundlinge und Slawen, Beitr\u00e4ge zur Rundlingsforschung'', Hrsg.: Wolfgang J\u00fcrries, L\u00fcchow, 2004, {{ISBN|3-9806364-0-2}}\n* ''Rundlinge im Hannoverschen Wendland'' by the Society for the Preservation of Rundlings in the Hanoverian Wendland (''Verein zur Erhaltung von Rundlingen im Hannoverschen Wendland'')\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Rundlings}}\n*[http://www.rundlingsverein.de/html/80-Rundling_circular-village.htm Rundlinge \u2013 Circular Villages in Wendland], Adrian Greenwood, 25 September 2012\n\n{{European village types}}\n[[Category:Villages in Germany|*]]\n[[Category:Rural geography]]\n[[Category:Wendland]]\n[[Category:Settlement geography]]\n[[Category:Types of village]]\n", "name_user": "Chris the speller", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo(s) fixed: north-south \u2192 north\u2013south, East-West \u2192 east\u2013west; spaces", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rundling"}
{"title_page": "Alternatives to general relativity", "text_new": "{{Short description|Proposed theories of gravity}}\n\n{{disputed|date=February 2016}}\n\n'''Alternatives to general relativity''' are [[Physical theory|physical theories]] that attempt to describe the phenomenon of [[gravitation]] in competition to Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]]. There have been many different attempts at constructing an ideal theory of [[gravity]].<ref name=\"Clifton\">{{cite journal | first =Timothy|last=Clifton|author2=Pedro G. Ferreira|author3=Antonio Padilla|author4=Constantinos Skordis|title=Modified Gravity and Cosmology|journal=Physics Reports|volume=513 num.3|issue=1|year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2012.01.001|pages=1\u2013189|arxiv=1106.2476|bibcode=2012PhR...513....1C}}</ref>\n\nThese attempts can be split into four broad categories based on their scope. In this article, we discuss straightforward alternatives to general relativity, which do not involve quantum mechanics or force unification. Other theories which do attempt to construct a theory using the principles of quantum mechanics are known as theories of [[Quantum gravity|quantized gravity]]. Thirdly, there are theories which attempt to explain gravity and other forces at the same time; these are known as [[classical unified field theories]]. Finally, the most ambitious theories attempt to both put gravity in quantum mechanical terms and unify forces; these are called [[theory of everything|theories of everything]].\n\nNone of these alternatives to general relativity have gained wide acceptance. Despite many [[tests of general relativity]], general relativity has remained consistent with all observations so far. In contrast, many of the early alternatives have been definitively disproven. However, some of the alternative theories of gravity are supported by a minority of physicists, and the topic remains the subject of intense study in [[theoretical physics]].\n\n==History of gravitational theory through general relativity==\n{{Main|History of gravitational theory|History of general relativity}}\n\nEarly theories of gravity attempted to explain planetary orbits ([[Newtonian gravity|Newton]]) and more complicated orbits (e.g. [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]). Then came unsuccessful attempts to [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|combine gravity and either wave or corpuscular theories]] of gravity. The whole landscape of physics was changed with the discovery of [[Lorentz transformations]], and this led to attempts to reconcile it with gravity. At the same time, experimental physicists started testing the foundations of gravity and relativity \u2013 [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariance]], the [[Tests of general relativity|gravitational deflection of light]], the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment]]. These considerations led to and past the development of [[general relativity]].\n\n===Newtonian gravity===\n{{Main|Newton's law of universal gravitation|Gauss's law for gravity}}\nIn Newton's theory<ref>Newton, I. (1686) ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''</ref> (rewritten using more modern mathematics) the density of mass <math>\\rho\\,</math> generates a scalar field, the gravitational potential <math>\\varphi\\,</math> in joules per kilogram, by\n:<math>{\\partial^2 \\varphi \\over \\partial x^j \\, \\partial x^j} = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nUsing the [[Nabla operator]] <math>\\nabla</math> for the [[gradient]] and [[divergence]] (partial derivatives), this can be conveniently written as:\n:<math>\\nabla^2 \\varphi = 4 \\pi G \\rho \\,.</math>\n\nThis scalar field governs the motion of a [[free-fall]]ing particle by:\n:<math>{ d^2x^j\\over dt^2} = -{\\partial\\varphi\\over\\partial x^j\\,}.</math>\n\nAt distance ''r'' from an isolated mass ''M'', the scalar field is\n:<math>\\varphi = -\\frac{GM} r \\,.</math>\n\nThe [[Newtonian gravity|theory of Newton]], and Lagrange's improvement on the calculation (applying the variational principle), completely fails to take into account relativistic effects of course, and so can be rejected as a viable theory of gravity. Even so, Newton's theory is thought to be exactly correct in the limit of weak gravitational fields and low speeds and all other theories of gravity need to reproduce Newton's theory in the appropriate limits.\n\n===Mechanical explanations (1650\u20131900)===\nTo explain Newton's theory, some [[mechanical explanations of gravitation]] (including [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|Le Sage's theory]]) were created between 1650 and 1900, but they were overthrown because most of them lead to an unacceptable amount of [[Drag (physics)|drag]], which is not observed. Other models are violating the [[energy conservation law]] and are incompatible with modern [[thermodynamics]].\n\n===Electrostatic models (1870\u20131900)===\nAt the end of the 19th century, many tried to combine Newton's force law with the established laws of electrodynamics, like those of [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Weber]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. Those models were used to explain the [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|perihelion advance of Mercury]]. In 1890, L\u00e9vy succeeded in doing so by combining the laws of Weber and Riemann, whereby the [[speed of gravity]] is equal to the speed of light in his theory. And in another attempt, [[Paul Gerber]] (1898) even succeeded in deriving the correct formula for the Perihelion shift (which was identical to that formula later used by Einstein). However, because the basic laws of Weber and others were wrong (for example, Weber's law was superseded by Maxwell's theory), those hypothesis were rejected.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zenneck, J. |authorlink=Jonathan Zenneck |title=Gravitation |journal=Encyklop\u00e4die der Mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss Ihrer Anwendungen |date=1903 |volume=5 |pages=25\u201367 |language=German |doi=10.1007/978-3-663-16016-8_2 |isbn=978-3-663-15445-7 }}</ref> In 1900, [[Hendrik Lorentz]] tried to explain gravity on the basis of his [[Lorentz ether theory]] and the [[Maxwell equations]].

The resulting net force is exactly what is known as universal gravitation, in which the speed of gravity is that of light.

By then he knew of the gravitational redshift and the deflection of light. He had realized that [[Lorentz transformations]] are not generally applicable, but retained them.

Hilbert was the first to correctly state the [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]] for general relativity, which is:\n\n:<math>S = {c^4 \\over 16 \\pi G} \\int R \\sqrt{-g} \\ d^4 x + S_m \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>G \\,</math> is Newton's gravitational constant, <math>R = R_{\\mu}^{~\\mu} \\,</math> is the [[Ricci curvature]] of space, <math>g = \\det ( g_{\\mu \\nu} ) \\,</math> and <math>S_m \\,</math> is the [[action (physics)|action]] due to mass.\n\nGeneral relativity is a tensor theory, the equations all contain tensors. Nordstr\u00f6m's theories, on the other hand, are scalar theories because the gravitational field is a scalar. Later in this article you will see scalar-tensor theories that contain a scalar field in addition to the tensors of general relativity, and other variants containing vector fields as well have been developed recently.\n\n== Motivations ==\nAfter general relativity, attempts were made either to improve on theories developed before general relativity, or to improve general relativity itself. Many different strategies were attempted, for example the addition of spin to general relativity, combining a general relativity-like metric with a spacetime that is static with respect to the expansion of the universe, getting extra freedom by adding another parameter. At least one theory was motivated by the desire to develop an alternative to general relativity that is free of singularities.\n\nExperimental tests improved along with the theories. Many of the different strategies that were developed soon after general relativity were abandoned, and there was a push to develop more general forms of the theories that survived, so that a theory would be ready when any test showed a disagreement with general relativity.\n\nBy the 1980s, the increasing accuracy of experimental tests had all confirmed general relativity; no competitors were left except for those that included general relativity as a special case. Further, shortly after that, theorists switched to string theory which was starting to look promising, but has since lost popularity. In the mid-1980s a few experiments were suggesting that gravity was being modified by the addition of a fifth force (or, in one case, of a fifth, sixth and seventh force) acting in the range of a few meters. Subsequent experiments eliminated these.\n\nMotivations for the more recent alternative theories are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"[[Cosmic inflation|inflation]]\", \"[[dark matter]]\" and \"[[dark energy]]\". Investigation of the [[Pioneer anomaly]] has caused renewed public interest in alternatives to general relativity.\n\n== Notation in this article ==\n{{Main|Mathematics of general relativity|Ricci calculus}}\n\n<math>c\\;</math> is the [[speed of light]], <math>G\\;</math> is the [[gravitational constant]]. \"[[Natural units|Geometric variables]]\" are not used.\n\nLatin indices go from 1 to 3, Greek indices go from 0 to 3. The [[Einstein notation|Einstein summation convention]] is used.\n\n<math>\\eta_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> is the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski metric]]. <math>g_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> is a tensor, usually the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]]. These have [[Metric signature|signature]] (\u2212,+,+,+).\n\n[[Partial derivative|Partial differentiation]] is written <math>\\partial_\\mu \\varphi\\;</math> or <math>\\varphi_{,\\mu}\\;</math>. [[Covariant differentiation]] is written <math>\\nabla_\\mu \\varphi\\;</math> or <math>\\varphi_{;\\mu}\\;</math>.\n\n== Classification of theories ==\nTheories of gravity can be classified, loosely, into several categories. Most of the theories described here have:\n* an '[[Action (physics)|action]]' (see the [[principle of least action]], a [[variational principle]] based on the concept of action)\n* a [[Lagrangian density]]\n* a [[metric tensor|metric]]\n\nIf a theory has a Lagrangian density for gravity, say <math>L\\,</math>, then the gravitational part of the action <math>S\\,</math> is the integral of that:\n:<math>S = \\int L \\sqrt{-g} \\, \\mathrm{d}^4x </math>\n\nIn this equation it is usual, though not essential, to have <math>g = -1\\,</math> at spatial infinity when using Cartesian coordinates. For example, the [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]] uses\n:<math>L\\,\\propto\\, R </math>\n\nwhere ''R'' is the [[scalar curvature]], a measure of the curvature of space.\n\nAlmost every theory described in this article has an [[Action (physics)|action]]. It is the only known way to guarantee that the necessary conservation laws of energy, momentum and angular momentum are incorporated automatically; although it is easy to construct an action where those conservation laws are violated. The original 1983 version of [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|MOND]] did not have an action.\n\nA few theories have an action but not a Lagrangian density. A good example is Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922>Whitehead, A.N. (1922) ''The Principles of Relativity'', Cambridge Univ. Press</ref>, the action there is termed non-local.\n\nA theory of gravity is a \"metric theory\" if and only if it can be given a mathematical representation in which two conditions hold:<br />\n''Condition 1'': There exists a symmetric [[metric tensor]] <math>g_{\\mu\\nu}\\,</math> of [[Metric signature|signature]] (\u2212, +, +, +), which governs proper-length and proper-time measurements in the usual manner of special and general relativity:\n\n:<math>{d\\tau}^2 = - g_{\\mu \\nu} \\, dx^\\mu \\, dx^\\nu \\,</math>\n\nwhere there is a summation over indices <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\nu</math>.<br />\n''Condition 2'': Stressed matter and fields being acted upon by gravity respond in accordance with the equation:\n\n:<math>0 = \\nabla_\\nu T^{\\mu \\nu} = {T^{\\mu \\nu}}_{,\\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\sigma \\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\nu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\mu \\sigma} \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>T^{\\mu \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]] for all matter and non-gravitational fields, and where <math>\\nabla_{\\nu}</math> is the [[covariant derivative]] with respect to the metric and <math>\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\sigma \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[Christoffel symbol]]. The stress\u2013energy tensor should also satisfy an [[energy condition]].\n\nMetric theories include (from simplest to most complex):\n* [[#Scalar field theories|Scalar field theories]] (includes Conformally flat theories & Stratified theories with conformally flat space slices)\n** Bergman\n** Coleman\n** Einstein (1912)\n** Einstein\u2013Fokker theory\n** [[David L.

Given that variable c and zero deflection of light are both in conflict with experiment, the prospect for a successful scalar theory of gravity looks very unlikely.

The status of Cartan's theory is uncertain. Will<ref name=Will1981 /> claims that all non-metric theories are eliminated by Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Will (2001) tempers that by explaining experimental criteria for testing non-metric theories against Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> claims that Cartan's theory is the only non-metric theory to survive all experimental tests up to that date and Turyshev<ref name=Turyshev2006>Turyshev, S. G. (2006) Testing gravity in the solar system, http://star-www.st-and.ac.uk/~hz4/workshop/workshopppt/turyshev.pdf</ref> lists Cartan's theory among the few that have survived all experimental tests up to that date. The following is a quick sketch of Cartan's theory as restated by Trautman.<ref name=Trautman1972>Trautman, A. (1972) On the Einstein\u2013Cartan equations I, Bulletin de l'Academie Polonaise des Sciences 20, 185-190</ref>\n\nCartan<ref name=Cartan1922 /><ref name=Cartan1923 /> suggested a simple generalization of Einstein's theory of gravitation. He proposed a model of space time with a metric tensor and a linear \"connection\" compatible with the metric but not necessarily symmetric. The torsion tensor of the connection is related to the density of intrinsic angular momentum. Independently of Cartan, similar ideas were put forward by Sciama, by Kibble in the years 1958 to 1966, culminating in a 1976 review by Hehl et al.\n\nThe original description is in terms of differential forms, but for the present article that is replaced by the more familiar language of tensors (risking loss of accuracy). As in general relativity, the Lagrangian is made up of a massless and a mass part. The Lagrangian for the massless part is:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nL & ={1\\over 32\\pi G}\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu g^{\\nu\\xi}x^\\eta x^\\zeta \\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta} \\\\[5pt]\n\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu & =d \\omega^\\mu_\\nu + \\omega^\\eta_\\xi \\\\[5pt]\n\\nabla x^\\mu & =-\\omega^\\mu_\\nu x^\\nu\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe <math>\\omega^\\mu_\\nu\\;</math> is the linear connection. <math>\\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta}\\;</math> is the completely antisymmetric pseudo-tensor ([[Levi-Civita symbol]]) with <math>\\varepsilon_{0123}=\\sqrt{-g}\\;</math>, and <math>g^{\\nu\\xi}\\,</math> is the metric tensor as usual. By assuming that the linear connection is metric, it is possible to remove the unwanted freedom inherent in the non-metric theory. The stress\u2013energy tensor is calculated from:\n\n:<math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 16\\pi G} (g^{\\mu\\nu}\\eta^\\xi_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\mu}\\eta^\\nu_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\nu} \\eta^\\mu_\\eta) \\Omega^\\eta_\\xi\\;</math>\n\nThe space curvature is not Riemannian, but on a Riemannian space-time the Lagrangian would reduce to the Lagrangian of general relativity.\n\nSome equations of the non-metric theory of Belinfante and Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> have already been discussed in the section on [[#Bimetric theories|bimetric theories]].\n\nA distinctively non-metric theory is given by [[gauge theory gravity]], which replaces the metric in its field equations with a pair of gauge fields in flat spacetime.  On the one hand, the theory is quite conservative because it is substantially equivalent to Einstein\u2013Cartan theory (or general relativity in the limit of vanishing spin), differing mostly in the nature of its global solutions.  On the other hand, it is radical because it replaces differential geometry with [[geometric algebra]].\n\n== Modern theories 1980s to present ==\nThis section includes alternatives to general relativity published after the observations of galaxy rotation that led to the hypothesis of \"dark matter\". There is no known reliable list of comparison of these theories.

These theories are presented with a cosmological constant or added scalar or vector potential.\n\n=== Motivations ===\nMotivations for the more recent alternatives to general relativity are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"inflation\", \"dark matter\" and \"dark energy\". The basic idea is that gravity agrees with general relativity at the present epoch but may have been quite different in the early universe.\n\nThere was a slow dawning realisation in the physics world that there were several problems inherent in the then big bang scenario, two of these were the [[horizon problem]] and the observation that at early times when quarks were first forming there was not enough space on the universe to contain even one quark. Inflation theory was developed to overcome these. Another alternative was constructing an alternative to general relativity in which the speed of light was larger in the early universe. The discovery of unexpected rotation curves for galaxies took everyone by surprise. Could there be more mass in the universe than we are aware of, or is the theory of gravity itself wrong? The consensus now is that the missing mass is \"cold dark matter\", but that consensus was only reached after trying alternatives to general relativity and some physicists still believe that alternative models of gravity might hold the answer.\n\nIn the 1990s, supernova surveys discovered the accelerated expansion of the universe, usually attributed to [[dark energy]]. This led to the rapid reinstatement of Einstein's cosmological constant, and quintessence arrived as an alternative to the cosmological constant. At least one new alternative to general relativity attempted to explain the supernova surveys' results in a completely different way. The measurement of the speed of gravity with the gravitational wave event [[GW170817]] ruled out many alternative theories of gravity as explanation for the accelerated expansion.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Challenges to Self-Acceleration in Modified Gravity from Gravitational Waves and Large-Scale Structure |journal=Phys.

It was quickly discovered that alternatives to general relativity could explain this anomaly. This is now believed to be accounted for by non-uniform thermal radiation.\n\n=== Cosmological constant and quintessence ===\n{{see also|Cosmological constant|Einstein\u2013Hilbert action|Quintessence (physics)}}\n\nThe cosmological constant <math>\\Lambda\\;</math> is a very old idea, going back to Einstein in 1917.<ref name=Einstein1917 /> The success of the Friedmann model of the universe in which <math>\\Lambda=0\\;</math> led to the general acceptance that it is zero, but the use of a non-zero value came back with a vengeance when data from supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating\n\nFirst, let's see how it influences the equations of Newtonian gravity and General Relativity. In Newtonian gravity, the addition of the cosmological constant changes the Newton\u2013Poisson equation from:\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi=4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi + \\frac{1}{2}\\Lambda c^2 = 4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nIn general relativity, it changes the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action from\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int R\\sqrt{-g} \\, d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int (R-2\\Lambda)\\sqrt{-g}\\,d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nwhich changes the field equation\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G} \\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R \\right)\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G}\\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R + g^{\\mu\\nu} \\Lambda \\right)\\;</math>\n\nIn alternative theories of gravity, a cosmological constant can be added to the action in exactly the same way.\n\nThe cosmological constant is not the only way to get an accelerated expansion of the universe in alternatives to general relativity. We've already seen how the scalar potential <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> can be added to scalar tensor theories. This can also be done in every alternative the general relativity that contains a scalar field <math>\\varphi\\;</math> by adding the term <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> inside the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action, the <math>L_\\varphi\\;</math> part of\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int d^4x \\, \\sqrt{-g} \\, L_\\varphi+S_m\\;</math>\n\nBecause <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> is an arbitrary function of the scalar field, it can be set to give an acceleration that is large in the early universe and small at the present epoch. This is known as quintessence.\n\nA similar method can be used in alternatives to general relativity that use vector fields, including Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> and vector-tensor theories. A term proportional to\n\n: <math>K^\\mu K^\\nu g_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math>\n\nis added to the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action.\n\n=== Farnes' theories === \nIn December 2018, the astrophysicist [[Jamie Farnes]] from the [[University of Oxford]] proposed a [[dark fluid]] theory, related to notions of gravitationally repulsive negative masses that were presented earlier by [[Albert Einstein]]. The theory may help to better understand the considerable amounts of unknown [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] in the [[universe]].<ref name=\"ARX-2018\">{{cite journal |last=Farnes |first=J.S. |title=A Unifying Theory of Dark Energy and Dark Matter: Negative Masses and Matter Creation within a Modified \u039bCDM Framework |journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics |volume=620 |pages=A92 |arxiv=1712.07962 |year=2018 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201832898 |bibcode=2018A&A...620A..92F }}</ref>\n\nThe theory relies on the concept of [[negative mass]] and reintroduces [[Fred Hoyle]]'s creation tensor in order to allow [[matter creation]] for only negative mass particles. In this way, the negative mass particles surround galaxies and apply a pressure onto them, thereby resembling dark matter. As these hypothesised particles mutually repel one another, they push apart the Universe, thereby resembling dark energy. The creation of matter allows the density of the exotic negative mass particles to remain constant as a function of time, and so appears like a [[cosmological constant]]. Einstein's field equations are modified to:\n: <math>R_{\\mu \\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} R g_{\\mu \\nu} = \\frac{8 \\pi G}{c^4} \\left( T_{\\mu \\nu}^{+} + T_{\\mu \\nu}^{-} + C_{\\mu \\nu} \\right)</math>\n\nAccording to Occam's razor, Farnes' theory is a simpler alternative to the conventional LambdaCDM model, as both dark energy and dark matter (two hypotheses) are solved using a single negative mass fluid (one hypothesis). The theory will be directly testable using the world's largest radio telescope, the [[Square Kilometre Array]] which should come online in 2022.<ref name=\"EA-20181205\">{{cite web |author=University of Oxford |title=Bringing balance to the universe: New theory could explain missing 95 percent of the cosmos |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-12/uoo-bbt120318.php |date=5 December 2018 |work=[[EurekAlert!]] |accessdate=6 December 2018 |author-link=University of Oxford }}</ref>\n\n=== Relativistic MOND ===\n{{main|Modified Newtonian dynamics|Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|Extended theories of gravity}}\n\nThe original theory of MOND by Milgrom was developed in 1983 as an alternative to \"dark matter\". Departures from Newton's law of gravitation are governed by an acceleration scale, not a distance scale. MOND successfully explains the Tully-Fisher observation that the luminosity of a galaxy should scale as the fourth power of the rotation speed. It also explains why the rotation discrepancy in dwarf galaxies is particularly large.\n\nThere were several problems with MOND in the beginning.\n# It did not include relativistic effects\n# It violated the conservation of energy, momentum and angular momentum\n# It was inconsistent in that it gives different galactic orbits for gas and for stars\n# It did not state how to calculate gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters.\n\nBy 1984, problems 2 and 3 had been solved by introducing a Lagrangian ([[AQUAL]]). A relativistic version of this based on scalar-tensor theory was rejected because it allowed waves in the scalar field to propagate faster than light. The Lagrangian of the non-relativistic form is:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}f\\left\\lbrack \\frac{|\\nabla\\varphi|^2}{a_0^2}\\right\\rbrack-\\rho\\varphi</math>\n\nThe relativistic version of this has:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}\\tilde f \\left( \\ell_0^2 g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\partial_\\mu\\varphi\\, \\partial_\\nu\\varphi \\right )</math>\n\nwith a nonstandard mass action. Here <math>f</math> and <math>\\tilde f</math> are arbitrary functions selected to give Newtonian and MOND behaviour in the correct limits, and <math>l_0 = c^2/a_0\\;</math> is the MOND length scale. By 1988, a second scalar field (PCC) fixed problems with the earlier scalar-tensor version but is in conflict with the perihelion precession of Mercury and gravitational lensing by galaxies and clusters. By 1997, MOND had been successfully incorporated in a stratified relativistic theory [Sanders], but as this is a preferred frame theory it has problems of its own. Bekenstein<ref name=Bekenstein2004 /> introduced a [[Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|tensor-vector-scalar]] model (TeVeS). This has two scalar fields <math>\\varphi</math>  and <math>\\sigma\\;</math> and vector field <math>U_\\alpha</math>.

The action is split into: <math> S=S_G+S_K+S_S+S_M</math> with terms for gravity, vector field <math>K_\\mu,</math> scalar fields <math>G, \\omega, \\mu</math> and mass. <math>S_G</math> is the standard gravity term with the exception that <math>G</math> is moved inside the integral.\n\n: <math>S_K=-\\int d^4x\\,\\sqrt{-g}\\omega \\left( \\frac14 B_{\\mu\\nu} B^{\\mu\\nu} + V(K) \\right), \\qquad \\text{where } \\quad B_{\\mu\\nu}=\\partial_\\mu K_\\nu-\\partial_\\nu K_\\mu.</math>\n\n: <math>S_S = -\\int d^4x\\,\\sqrt{-g} \\frac{1}{G^3} \\left( \\frac12g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\nabla_\\mu G\\,\\nabla_\\nu G -V(G) \\right) + \\frac{1}{G} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\nabla_\\mu\\omega\\,\\nabla_\\nu\\omega -V(\\omega) \\right) +{1\\over\\mu^2G} \\left( \\frac12g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\nabla_\\mu\\mu\\,\\nabla_\\nu\\mu - V(\\mu) \\right).</math>\n\nThe potential function for the vector field is chosen to be:\n\n: <math>V(K) = -\\frac12\\mu^2\\varphi^\\mu\\varphi_\\mu - \\frac14g \\left (\\varphi^\\mu \\varphi_\\mu \\right )^2</math>\n\nwhere <math>g</math> is a coupling constant.

For in-depth coverage of these tests, see Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> Ch.39, Will <ref name=Will1981 /> Table 2.1, and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 />.  Most such tests can be categorized as in the following subsections.\n\n=== Self-consistency ===\nSelf-consistency among non-metric theories includes eliminating theories allowing [[tachyon]]s, ghost poles and higher order poles, and those that have problems with behaviour at infinity. Among metric theories, self-consistency is best illustrated by describing several theories that fail this test. The classic example is the spin-two field theory of Fierz and Pauli<ref name=Fierz1939 />); the field equations imply that gravitating bodies move in straight lines, whereas the equations of motion insist that gravity deflects bodies away from straight line motion. Yilmaz (1971)<ref name=Yilmaz1973 /> contains a tensor gravitational field used to construct a metric; it is mathematically inconsistent because the functional dependence of the metric on the tensor field is not well defined.\n\n=== Completeness ===\nTo be complete, a theory of gravity must be capable of analysing the outcome of every experiment of interest. It must therefore mesh with electromagnetism and all other physics. For instance, any theory that cannot predict from first principles the movement of planets or the behaviour of atomic clocks is incomplete.\n\nMany early theories are incomplete in that it is unclear whether the density <math>\\rho</math> used by the theory should be calculated from the stress\u2013energy tensor <math>T</math> as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}u^\\mu u^\\nu</math> or as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}\\delta^{\\mu \\nu}</math>, where <math>u</math> is the [[four-velocity]], and <math>\\delta</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]]. The theories of Thirry (1948) and Jordan<ref name=Jordan1955 /> are incomplete unless Jordan's parameter <math>\\eta\\;</math> is set to -1, in which case they match the theory of Brans\u2013Dicke<ref name=Brans1961 /> and so are worthy of further consideration. Milne<ref name=Milne1948 /> is incomplete because it makes no gravitational red-shift prediction. The theories of Whitrow and Morduch<ref name=Whitrow1960 /><ref name=Whitrow1965 />, Kustaanheimo<ref name=Kustaanheimo1966 /> and Kustaanheimo and Nuotio<ref name=Kustaanheimo1967 /> are either incomplete or inconsistent. The incorporation of Maxwell's equations is incomplete unless it is assumed that they are imposed on the flat background space-time, and when that is done they are inconsistent, because they predict zero gravitational redshift when the wave version of light (Maxwell theory) is used, and nonzero redshift when the particle version (photon) is used. Another more obvious example is Newtonian gravity with Maxwell's equations; light as photons is deflected by gravitational fields (by half that of general relativity) but light as waves is not.\n\n=== Classical tests ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\nThere are three \"classical\" tests (dating back to the 1910s or earlier) of the ability of gravity theories to handle relativistic effects; they are [[gravitational redshift]], [[gravitational lensing]] (generally tested around the Sun), and anomalous perihelion advance of the planets. Each theory should reproduce the observed results in these areas, which have to date always aligned with the predictions of general relativity. In 1964, [[Irwin I. Shapiro]] found a fourth test, called the [[Shapiro delay]]. It is usually regarded as a \"classical\" test as well.\n\n=== Agreement with Newtonian mechanics and special relativity ===\nAs an example of disagreement with Newtonian experiments, Birkhoff<ref name=Birkhoff1943>{{cite journal | last1 = Birkhoff | first1 = G. D. | year = 1943 | title = Matter, electricity and gravitation in flat space-time | url = | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. | volume = 29 | issue = 8| pages = 231\u2013239 | doi=10.1073/pnas.29.8.231| pmid = 16578082 |bibcode = 1943PNAS...29..231B | pmc = 1078600}}</ref> theory predicts relativistic effects fairly reliably but demands that sound waves travel at the speed of light. This was the consequence of an assumption made to simplify handling the collision of masses.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== The Einstein equivalence principle ===\n{{Main|Equivalence principle}}\n\nEinstein's Equivalence Principle has three components. The first is the uniqueness of free fall, also known as the Weak Equivalence Principle. This is satisfied if inertial mass is equal to gravitational mass. ''\u03b7'' is a parameter used to test the maximum allowable violation of the Weak Equivalence Principle. The first tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle were done by E\u00f6tv\u00f6s before 1900 and limited ''\u03b7'' to less than 5{{e|-9}}. Modern tests have reduced that to less than 5{{e|-13}}. The second is Lorentz invariance. In the absence of gravitational effects the speed of light is constant. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b4''. The first tests of Lorentz invariance were done by Michelson and Morley before 1890 and limited ''\u03b4'' to less than 5{{e|-3}}. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-21}}. The third is local position invariance, which includes spatial and temporal invariance. The outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment is independent of where and when it is performed. Spatial local position invariance is tested using gravitational redshift measurements. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b1''. Upper limits on this found by Pound and Rebka in 1960 limited ''\u03b1'' to less than 0.1. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-4}}.\n\n[[Leonard I. Schiff|Schiff]]'s conjecture states that any complete, self-consistent theory of gravity that embodies the Weak Equivalence Principle necessarily embodies Einstein's Equivalence Principle. This is likely to be true if the theory has full energy conservation. Metric theories satisfy the Einstein Equivalence Principle. Extremely few non-metric theories satisfy this. For example, the non-metric theory of Belinfante & Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> is eliminated by the ''TH\u03b5\u03bc'' formalism for testing Einstein's Equivalence Principle.  Gauge theory gravity is a notable exception, where the strong equivalence principle is essentially the [[minimal coupling]] of the [[gauge covariant derivative]].\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian formalism ===\n{{Main|Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism}}\n\nSee also [[Tests of general relativity]], Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> and Will<ref name=Will1981 /> for more information.\n\nWork on developing a standardized rather than ad-hoc set of tests for evaluating alternative gravitation models began with Eddington in 1922 and resulted in a standard set of Parametric post-Newtonian numbers in Nordtvedt and Will<ref name=Nordtvedt1972>{{cite journal | last1 = Nordtvedt Jr | first1 = K. | last2 = Will | first2 = C. M. | year = 1972 | title = Conservation laws and preferred frames in relativistic gravity II | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 177 | issue = | page = 775 | bibcode = 1972ApJ...177..775N | doi = 10.1086/151755 }}</ref> and Will and Nordtvedt<ref name=Will1972 />. Each parameter measures a different aspect of how much a theory departs from Newtonian gravity. Because we are talking about deviation from Newtonian theory here, these only measure weak-field effects. The effects of strong gravitational fields are examined later.\n\nThese ten are: <math>\\gamma, \\beta,\\eta,\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3,\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4.</math>\n\n*<math>\\gamma</math> is a measure of space curvature, being zero for Newtonian gravity and one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\beta</math> is a measure of nonlinearity in the addition of gravitational fields, one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\eta</math> is a check for preferred location effects.\n*<math>\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of \"preferred-frame effects\". Any theory of gravity in which at least one of the three is nonzero is called a preferred-frame theory.\n*<math>\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of breakdowns in global conservation laws. A theory of gravity possesses 4 conservation laws for energy-momentum and 6 for angular momentum only if all five are zero.\n\n=== Strong gravity and gravitational waves ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\n\nParametric post-Newtonian is only a measure of weak field effects. Strong gravity effects can be seen in compact objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Experimental tests such as the stability of white dwarfs, spin-down rate of pulsars, orbits of binary pulsars and the existence of a black hole horizon can be used as tests of alternative to general relativity. General relativity predicts that gravitational waves travel at the speed of light. Many alternatives to general relativity say that gravitational waves travel faster than light, possibly breaking of causality. After the multi-messaging detection of the GW170817 coalescence of neutron stars, where light and gravitational waves were measured to travel at the same speed with an error of 1/10<sup>15</sup>, many of those modified theory of gravity were excluded.\n\n=== Cosmological tests ===\nMany of these have been developed recently. For those theories that aim to replace [[dark matter]], the [[galaxy rotation curve]], the [[Tully-Fisher relation]], the faster rotation rate of dwarf galaxies, and the [[gravitational lens]]ing due to galactic clusters act as constraints. For those theories that aim to replace [[Cosmic inflation|inflation]], the size of ripples in the spectrum of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] is the strictest test. For those theories that incorporate or aim to replace [[dark energy]], the supernova brightness results and the age of the universe can be used as tests. Another test is the flatness of the universe. With general relativity, the combination of baryonic matter, dark matter and dark energy add up to make the universe exactly flat. As the accuracy of experimental tests improve, alternatives to general relativity that aim to replace dark matter or dark energy will have to explain why.\n\n== Results of testing theories ==\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian parameters for a range of theories ===\n(See Will<ref name=Will1981 /> and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 /> for more details. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> gives a table for translating parameters from the notation of Ni to that of Will)\n\nGeneral Relativity is now more than 100 years old, during which one alternative theory of gravity after another has failed to agree with ever more accurate observations. One illustrative example is [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism]]. The following table lists Parametric post-Newtonian values for a large number of theories. If the value in a cell matches that in the column heading then the full formula is too complicated to include here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !!Width=\"45\"|<math>\\gamma</math>\n!

The value closest to zero is listed.\n\nAll experimental tests agree with general relativity so far, and so Parametric post-Newtonian analysis immediately eliminates all the scalar field theories in the table. A full list of Parametric post-Newtonian parameters is not available for Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922 />, Deser-Laurent<ref name=Deser1968 />, Bollini-Giambiagi-Tiomino<ref name=Bollini1970 />, but in these three cases <math>\\beta=\\xi</math>,{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} which is in strong conflict with general relativity and experimental results. In particular, these theories predict incorrect amplitudes for the Earth's tides.  (A minor modification of [[Whitehead's theory of gravitation|Whitehead's theory]] avoids this problem.  However, the modification predicts the [[Nordtvedt effect]], which has been experimentally constrained.)\n\n=== Theories that fail other tests ===\nThe stratified theories of Ni<ref name=Ni1973 />, Lee Lightman and Ni<ref name=Lee1974 /> are non-starters because they all fail to explain the perihelion advance of Mercury. The bimetric theories of Lightman and Lee<ref name=Lightman1973 />, Rosen<ref name=Rosen1975 />, Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> all fail some of the tests associated with strong gravitational fields. The scalar-tensor theories include general relativity as a special case, but only agree with the Parametric post-Newtonian values of general relativity when they are equal to general relativity to within experimental error. As experimental tests get more accurate, the deviation of the scalar-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. The same is true of vector-tensor theories, the deviation of the vector-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. Further, vector-tensor theories are semi-conservative; they have a nonzero value for <math>\\alpha_2</math> which can have a measurable effect on the Earth's tides. Non-metric theories, such as Belinfante and Swihart,<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> usually fail to agree with experimental tests of Einstein's equivalence principle. And that leaves, as a likely valid alternative to general relativity, nothing except possibly Cartan.<ref name=Cartan1922 /> That was the situation until cosmological discoveries pushed the development of modern alternatives.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* Carroll, Sean.

There have been many different attempts at constructing an ideal theory of [[gravity]].<ref name=\"Clifton\">{{cite journal | first =Timothy|last=Clifton|author2=Pedro G. Ferreira|author3=Antonio Padilla|author4=Constantinos Skordis|title=Modified Gravity and Cosmology|journal=Physics Reports|volume=513 num.3|issue=1|year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.physrep.2012.01.001|pages=1\u2013189|arxiv=1106.2476|bibcode=2012PhR...513....1C}}</ref>\n\nThese attempts can be split into four broad categories based on their scope. In this article, we discuss straightforward alternatives to general relativity, which do not involve quantum mechanics or force unification. Other theories which do attempt to construct a theory using the principles of quantum mechanics are known as theories of [[Quantum gravity|quantized gravity]]. Thirdly, there are theories which attempt to explain gravity and other forces at the same time; these are known as [[classical unified field theories]]. Finally, the most ambitious theories attempt to both put gravity in quantum mechanical terms and unify forces; these are called [[theory of everything|theories of everything]].\n\nNone of these alternatives to general relativity have gained wide acceptance. Despite many [[tests of general relativity]], general relativity has remained consistent with all observations so far. In contrast, many of the early alternatives have been definitively disproven. However, some of the alternative theories of gravity are supported by a minority of physicists, and the topic remains the subject of intense study in [[theoretical physics]].\n\n==History of gravitational theory through general relativity==\n{{Main|History of gravitational theory|History of general relativity}}\n\nEarly theories of gravity attempted to explain planetary orbits ([[Newtonian gravity|Newton]]) and more complicated orbits (e.g. [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]). Then came unsuccessful attempts to [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|combine gravity and either wave or corpuscular theories]] of gravity. The whole landscape of physics was changed with the discovery of [[Lorentz transformations]], and this led to attempts to reconcile it with gravity. At the same time, experimental physicists started testing the foundations of gravity and relativity \u2013 [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariance]], the [[Tests of general relativity|gravitational deflection of light]], the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment]]. These considerations led to and past the development of [[general relativity]].\n\n===Newtonian gravity===\n{{Main|Newton's law of universal gravitation|Gauss's law for gravity}}\nIn Newton's theory<ref>Newton, I.

Even so, Newton's theory is thought to be exactly correct in the limit of weak gravitational fields and low speeds and all other theories of gravity need to reproduce Newton's theory in the appropriate limits.\n\n===Mechanical explanations (1650\u20131900)===\nTo explain Newton's theory, some [[mechanical explanations of gravitation]] (including [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|Le Sage's theory]]) were created between 1650 and 1900, but they were overthrown because most of them lead to an unacceptable amount of [[Drag (physics)|drag]], which is not observed. Other models are violating the [[energy conservation law]] and are incompatible with modern [[thermodynamics]].\n\n===Electrostatic models (1870\u20131900)===\nAt the end of the 19th century, many tried to combine Newton's force law with the established laws of electrodynamics, like those of [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Weber]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. Those models were used to explain the [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|perihelion advance of Mercury]]. In 1890, L\u00e9vy succeeded in doing so by combining the laws of Weber and Riemann, whereby the [[speed of gravity]] is equal to the speed of light in his theory. And in another attempt, [[Paul Gerber]] (1898) even succeeded in deriving the correct formula for the Perihelion shift (which was identical to that formula later used by Einstein). However, because the basic laws of Weber and others were wrong (for example, Weber's law was superseded by Maxwell's theory), those hypothesis were rejected.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zenneck, J. |authorlink=Jonathan Zenneck |title=Gravitation |journal=Encyklop\u00e4die der Mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss Ihrer Anwendungen |date=1903 |volume=5 |pages=25\u201367 |language=German |doi=10.1007/978-3-663-16016-8_2 |isbn=978-3-663-15445-7 }}</ref> In 1900, [[Hendrik Lorentz]] tried to explain gravity on the basis of his [[Lorentz ether theory]] and the [[Maxwell equations]].

The resulting net force is exactly what is known as universal gravitation, in which the speed of gravity is that of light. But Lorentz calculated that the value for the perihelion advance of Mercury was much too low.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Lorentz, H.A. | authorlink = Hendrik Lorentz | title=Considerations on Gravitation | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) | date=1900 | volume=2 | pages=559\u2013574 | url=https://www.dwc.knaw.nl/DL/publications/PU00014433.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Lorentz-invariant models (1905\u20131910)===\nBased on the [[principle of relativity]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] (1905, 1906), [[Hermann Minkowski]] (1908), and [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] (1910) tried to modify Newton's theory and to establish a [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariant]] gravitational law, in which the speed of gravity is that of light.

See [[relativity priority dispute]].

Nordstr\u00f6m's theories, on the other hand, are scalar theories because the gravitational field is a scalar. Later in this article you will see scalar-tensor theories that contain a scalar field in addition to the tensors of general relativity, and other variants containing vector fields as well have been developed recently.\n\n== Motivations ==\nAfter general relativity, attempts were made either to improve on theories developed before general relativity, or to improve general relativity itself. Many different strategies were attempted, for example the addition of spin to general relativity, combining a general relativity-like metric with a spacetime that is static with respect to the expansion of the universe, getting extra freedom by adding another parameter. At least one theory was motivated by the desire to develop an alternative to general relativity that is free of singularities.\n\nExperimental tests improved along with the theories. Many of the different strategies that were developed soon after general relativity were abandoned, and there was a push to develop more general forms of the theories that survived, so that a theory would be ready when any test showed a disagreement with general relativity.\n\nBy the 1980s, the increasing accuracy of experimental tests had all confirmed general relativity; no competitors were left except for those that included general relativity as a special case. Further, shortly after that, theorists switched to string theory which was starting to look promising, but has since lost popularity. In the mid-1980s a few experiments were suggesting that gravity was being modified by the addition of a fifth force (or, in one case, of a fifth, sixth and seventh force) acting in the range of a few meters. Subsequent experiments eliminated these.\n\nMotivations for the more recent alternative theories are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"[[Cosmic inflation|inflation]]\", \"[[dark matter]]\" and \"[[dark energy]]\". Investigation of the [[Pioneer anomaly]] has caused renewed public interest in alternatives to general relativity.\n\n== Notation in this article ==\n{{Main|Mathematics of general relativity|Ricci calculus}}\n\n<math>c\\;</math> is the [[speed of light]], <math>G\\;</math> is the [[gravitational constant]]. \"[[Natural units|Geometric variables]]\" are not used.\n\nLatin indices go from 1 to 3, Greek indices go from 0 to 3.

[[Covariant differentiation]] is written <math>\\nabla_\\mu \\varphi\\;</math> or <math>\\varphi_{;\\mu}\\;</math>.\n\n== Classification of theories ==\nTheories of gravity can be classified, loosely, into several categories. Most of the theories described here have:\n* an '[[Action (physics)|action]]' (see the [[principle of least action]], a [[variational principle]] based on the concept of action)\n* a [[Lagrangian density]]\n* a [[metric tensor|metric]]\n\nIf a theory has a Lagrangian density for gravity, say <math>L\\,</math>, then the gravitational part of the action <math>S\\,</math> is the integral of that:\n:<math>S = \\int L \\sqrt{-g} \\, \\mathrm{d}^4x </math>\n\nIn this equation it is usual, though not essential, to have <math>g = -1\\,</math> at spatial infinity when using Cartesian coordinates. For example, the [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]] uses\n:<math>L\\,\\propto\\, R </math>\n\nwhere ''R'' is the [[scalar curvature]], a measure of the curvature of space.\n\nAlmost every theory described in this article has an [[Action (physics)|action]]. It is the only known way to guarantee that the necessary conservation laws of energy, momentum and angular momentum are incorporated automatically; although it is easy to construct an action where those conservation laws are violated. The original 1983 version of [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|MOND]] did not have an action.\n\nA few theories have an action but not a Lagrangian density. A good example is Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922>Whitehead, A.N. (1922) ''The Principles of Relativity'', Cambridge Univ. Press</ref>, the action there is termed non-local.\n\nA theory of gravity is a \"metric theory\" if and only if it can be given a mathematical representation in which two conditions hold:<br />\n''Condition 1'': There exists a symmetric [[metric tensor]] <math>g_{\\mu\\nu}\\,</math> of [[Metric signature|signature]] (\u2212, +, +, +), which governs proper-length and proper-time measurements in the usual manner of special and general relativity:\n\n:<math>{d\\tau}^2 = - g_{\\mu \\nu} \\, dx^\\mu \\, dx^\\nu \\,</math>\n\nwhere there is a summation over indices <math>\\mu</math> and <math>\\nu</math>.<br />\n''Condition 2'': Stressed matter and fields being acted upon by gravity respond in accordance with the equation:\n\n:<math>0 = \\nabla_\\nu T^{\\mu \\nu} = {T^{\\mu \\nu}}_{,\\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\mu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\sigma \\nu} + \\Gamma^{\\nu}_{\\sigma \\nu} T^{\\mu \\sigma} \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>T^{\\mu \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]] for all matter and non-gravitational fields, and where <math>\\nabla_{\\nu}</math> is the [[covariant derivative]] with respect to the metric and <math>\\Gamma^{\\alpha}_{\\sigma \\nu} \\,</math> is the [[Christoffel symbol]].

How to add a [[#Cosmological constant and quintessence|cosmological constant or quintessence]] to a theory is discussed under Modern Theories (see also [[Einstein\u2013Hilbert action]]).\n\n=== Scalar field theories ===\n{{See also|Scalar theories of gravitation}}\n\nThe scalar field theories of Nordstr\u00f6m<ref name=Nordstr\u00f6m1912 /><ref name=Nordstr\u00f6m1913 /> have already been discussed.

Given that variable c and zero deflection of light are both in conflict with experiment, the prospect for a successful scalar theory of gravity looks very unlikely. Further, if the parameters of a scalar theory are adjusted so that the deflection of light is correct then the gravitational redshift is likely to be wrong.\n\nNi<ref name=Ni1972 /> summarised some theories and also created two more. In the first, a pre-existing special relativity space-time and universal time coordinate acts with matter and non-gravitational fields to generate a scalar field.  This scalar field acts together with all the rest to generate the metric.\n\nThe action is:\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int d^4 x \\sqrt{-g}L_\\varphi+S_m</math>\n\n: <math>L_\\varphi=\\varphi R-2g^{\\mu\\nu} \\, \\partial_\\mu\\varphi \\, \\partial_\\nu\\varphi</math>\n\nMisner et al.<ref name=Misner1973>Misner, C.

When <math>\\omega=\\eta=\\epsilon=\\tau=0</math> they reduce to general relativity so, so long as general relativity is confirmed by experiment, general vector-tensor theories can never be ruled out.\n\n=== Other metric theories ===\nOthers metric theories have been proposed; that of [[Jacob Bekenstein|Bekenstein]] <ref name=Bekenstein2004>{{cite journal | last1 = Bekenstein | first1 = J.

The status of Cartan's theory is uncertain. Will<ref name=Will1981 /> claims that all non-metric theories are eliminated by Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Will (2001) tempers that by explaining experimental criteria for testing non-metric theories against Einstein's Equivalence Principle. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> claims that Cartan's theory is the only non-metric theory to survive all experimental tests up to that date and Turyshev<ref name=Turyshev2006>Turyshev, S. G. (2006) Testing gravity in the solar system, http://star-www.st-and.ac.uk/~hz4/workshop/workshopppt/turyshev.pdf</ref> lists Cartan's theory among the few that have survived all experimental tests up to that date. The following is a quick sketch of Cartan's theory as restated by Trautman.<ref name=Trautman1972>Trautman, A. (1972) On the Einstein\u2013Cartan equations I, Bulletin de l'Academie Polonaise des Sciences 20, 185-190</ref>\n\nCartan<ref name=Cartan1922 /><ref name=Cartan1923 /> suggested a simple generalization of Einstein's theory of gravitation. He proposed a model of space time with a metric tensor and a linear \"connection\" compatible with the metric but not necessarily symmetric. The torsion tensor of the connection is related to the density of intrinsic angular momentum. Independently of Cartan, similar ideas were put forward by Sciama, by Kibble in the years 1958 to 1966, culminating in a 1976 review by Hehl et al.\n\nThe original description is in terms of differential forms, but for the present article that is replaced by the more familiar language of tensors (risking loss of accuracy). As in general relativity, the Lagrangian is made up of a massless and a mass part. The Lagrangian for the massless part is:\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nL & ={1\\over 32\\pi G}\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu g^{\\nu\\xi}x^\\eta x^\\zeta \\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta} \\\\[5pt]\n\\Omega_\\nu^\\mu & =d \\omega^\\mu_\\nu + \\omega^\\eta_\\xi \\\\[5pt]\n\\nabla x^\\mu & =-\\omega^\\mu_\\nu x^\\nu\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nThe <math>\\omega^\\mu_\\nu\\;</math> is the linear connection. <math>\\varepsilon_{\\xi\\mu\\eta\\zeta}\\;</math> is the completely antisymmetric pseudo-tensor ([[Levi-Civita symbol]]) with <math>\\varepsilon_{0123}=\\sqrt{-g}\\;</math>, and <math>g^{\\nu\\xi}\\,</math> is the metric tensor as usual. By assuming that the linear connection is metric, it is possible to remove the unwanted freedom inherent in the non-metric theory. The stress\u2013energy tensor is calculated from:\n\n:<math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 16\\pi G} (g^{\\mu\\nu}\\eta^\\xi_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\mu}\\eta^\\nu_\\eta-g^{\\xi\\nu} \\eta^\\mu_\\eta) \\Omega^\\eta_\\xi\\;</math>\n\nThe space curvature is not Riemannian, but on a Riemannian space-time the Lagrangian would reduce to the Lagrangian of general relativity.\n\nSome equations of the non-metric theory of Belinfante and Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> have already been discussed in the section on [[#Bimetric theories|bimetric theories]].\n\nA distinctively non-metric theory is given by [[gauge theory gravity]], which replaces the metric in its field equations with a pair of gauge fields in flat spacetime.  On the one hand, the theory is quite conservative because it is substantially equivalent to Einstein\u2013Cartan theory (or general relativity in the limit of vanishing spin), differing mostly in the nature of its global solutions.  On the other hand, it is radical because it replaces differential geometry with [[geometric algebra]].\n\n== Modern theories 1980s to present ==\nThis section includes alternatives to general relativity published after the observations of galaxy rotation that led to the hypothesis of \"dark matter\". There is no known reliable list of comparison of these theories.

These theories are presented with a cosmological constant or added scalar or vector potential.\n\n=== Motivations ===\nMotivations for the more recent alternatives to general relativity are almost all cosmological, associated with or replacing such constructs as \"inflation\", \"dark matter\" and \"dark energy\". The basic idea is that gravity agrees with general relativity at the present epoch but may have been quite different in the early universe.\n\nThere was a slow dawning realisation in the physics world that there were several problems inherent in the then big bang scenario, two of these were the [[horizon problem]] and the observation that at early times when quarks were first forming there was not enough space on the universe to contain even one quark. Inflation theory was developed to overcome these. Another alternative was constructing an alternative to general relativity in which the speed of light was larger in the early universe. The discovery of unexpected rotation curves for galaxies took everyone by surprise. Could there be more mass in the universe than we are aware of, or is the theory of gravity itself wrong? The consensus now is that the missing mass is \"cold dark matter\", but that consensus was only reached after trying alternatives to general relativity and some physicists still believe that alternative models of gravity might hold the answer.\n\nIn the 1990s, supernova surveys discovered the accelerated expansion of the universe, usually attributed to [[dark energy]]. This led to the rapid reinstatement of Einstein's cosmological constant, and quintessence arrived as an alternative to the cosmological constant. At least one new alternative to general relativity attempted to explain the supernova surveys' results in a completely different way. The measurement of the speed of gravity with the gravitational wave event [[GW170817]] ruled out many alternative theories of gravity as explanation for the accelerated expansion.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Challenges to Self-Acceleration in Modified Gravity from Gravitational Waves and Large-Scale Structure |journal=Phys.

It was quickly discovered that alternatives to general relativity could explain this anomaly. This is now believed to be accounted for by non-uniform thermal radiation.\n\n=== Cosmological constant and quintessence ===\n{{see also|Cosmological constant|Einstein\u2013Hilbert action|Quintessence (physics)}}\n\nThe cosmological constant <math>\\Lambda\\;</math> is a very old idea, going back to Einstein in 1917.<ref name=Einstein1917 /> The success of the Friedmann model of the universe in which <math>\\Lambda=0\\;</math> led to the general acceptance that it is zero, but the use of a non-zero value came back with a vengeance when data from supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating\n\nFirst, let's see how it influences the equations of Newtonian gravity and General Relativity. In Newtonian gravity, the addition of the cosmological constant changes the Newton\u2013Poisson equation from:\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi=4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>\\nabla^2\\varphi + \\frac{1}{2}\\Lambda c^2 = 4\\pi\\rho\\ G;</math>\n\nIn general relativity, it changes the Einstein\u2013Hilbert action from\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int R\\sqrt{-g} \\, d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int (R-2\\Lambda)\\sqrt{-g}\\,d^4x \\, +S_m\\;</math>\n\nwhich changes the field equation\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G} \\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R \\right)\\;</math>\n\nto\n\n: <math>T^{\\mu\\nu}={1\\over 8\\pi G}\\left(R^{\\mu\\nu}-\\frac {1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu} R + g^{\\mu\\nu} \\Lambda \\right)\\;</math>\n\nIn alternative theories of gravity, a cosmological constant can be added to the action in exactly the same way.\n\nThe cosmological constant is not the only way to get an accelerated expansion of the universe in alternatives to general relativity. We've already seen how the scalar potential <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> can be added to scalar tensor theories. This can also be done in every alternative the general relativity that contains a scalar field <math>\\varphi\\;</math> by adding the term <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> inside the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action, the <math>L_\\varphi\\;</math> part of\n\n: <math>S={1\\over 16\\pi G}\\int d^4x \\, \\sqrt{-g} \\, L_\\varphi+S_m\\;</math>\n\nBecause <math>\\lambda(\\varphi)\\;</math> is an arbitrary function of the scalar field, it can be set to give an acceleration that is large in the early universe and small at the present epoch. This is known as quintessence.\n\nA similar method can be used in alternatives to general relativity that use vector fields, including Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> and vector-tensor theories. A term proportional to\n\n: <math>K^\\mu K^\\nu g_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math>\n\nis added to the Lagrangian for the gravitational part of the action.\n\n=== Farnes' theories === \nIn December 2018, the astrophysicist [[Jamie Farnes]] from the [[University of Oxford]] proposed a [[dark fluid]] theory, related to notions of gravitationally repulsive negative masses that were presented earlier by [[Albert Einstein]]. The theory may help to better understand the considerable amounts of unknown [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] in the [[universe]].<ref name=\"ARX-2018\">{{cite journal |last=Farnes |first=J.S. |title=A Unifying Theory of Dark Energy and Dark Matter: Negative Masses and Matter Creation within a Modified \u039bCDM Framework |journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics |volume=620 |pages=A92 |arxiv=1712.07962 |year=2018 |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201832898 |bibcode=2018A&A...620A..92F }}</ref>\n\nThe theory relies on the concept of [[negative mass]] and reintroduces [[Fred Hoyle]]'s creation tensor in order to allow [[matter creation]] for only negative mass particles. In this way, the negative mass particles surround galaxies and apply a pressure onto them, thereby resembling dark matter. As these hypothesised particles mutually repel one another, they push apart the Universe, thereby resembling dark energy. The creation of matter allows the density of the exotic negative mass particles to remain constant as a function of time, and so appears like a [[cosmological constant]]. Einstein's field equations are modified to:\n: <math>R_{\\mu \\nu} - \\frac{1}{2} R g_{\\mu \\nu} = \\frac{8 \\pi G}{c^4} \\left( T_{\\mu \\nu}^{+} + T_{\\mu \\nu}^{-} + C_{\\mu \\nu} \\right)</math>\n\nAccording to Occam's razor, Farnes' theory is a simpler alternative to the conventional LambdaCDM model, as both dark energy and dark matter (two hypotheses) are solved using a single negative mass fluid (one hypothesis).

Departures from Newton's law of gravitation are governed by an acceleration scale, not a distance scale. MOND successfully explains the Tully-Fisher observation that the luminosity of a galaxy should scale as the fourth power of the rotation speed. It also explains why the rotation discrepancy in dwarf galaxies is particularly large.\n\nThere were several problems with MOND in the beginning.\n# It did not include relativistic effects\n# It violated the conservation of energy, momentum and angular momentum\n# It was inconsistent in that it gives different galactic orbits for gas and for stars\n# It did not state how to calculate gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters.\n\nBy 1984, problems 2 and 3 had been solved by introducing a Lagrangian ([[AQUAL]]). A relativistic version of this based on scalar-tensor theory was rejected because it allowed waves in the scalar field to propagate faster than light. The Lagrangian of the non-relativistic form is:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}f\\left\\lbrack \\frac{|\\nabla\\varphi|^2}{a_0^2}\\right\\rbrack-\\rho\\varphi</math>\n\nThe relativistic version of this has:\n\n: <math>L=-{a_0^2\\over 8\\pi G}\\tilde f \\left( \\ell_0^2 g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\partial_\\mu\\varphi\\, \\partial_\\nu\\varphi \\right )</math>\n\nwith a nonstandard mass action. Here <math>f</math> and <math>\\tilde f</math> are arbitrary functions selected to give Newtonian and MOND behaviour in the correct limits, and <math>l_0 = c^2/a_0\\;</math> is the MOND length scale. By 1988, a second scalar field (PCC) fixed problems with the earlier scalar-tensor version but is in conflict with the perihelion precession of Mercury and gravitational lensing by galaxies and clusters. By 1997, MOND had been successfully incorporated in a stratified relativistic theory [Sanders], but as this is a preferred frame theory it has problems of its own. Bekenstein<ref name=Bekenstein2004 /> introduced a [[Tensor-vector-scalar gravity|tensor-vector-scalar]] model (TeVeS). This has two scalar fields <math>\\varphi</math>  and <math>\\sigma\\;</math> and vector field <math>U_\\alpha</math>.

It has variable <math>G\\;</math>, increasing to a final constant value about a million years after the big bang.\n \nThe theory seems to contain an asymmetric tensor <math>A_{\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> field and a source current <math>J_\\mu\\;</math> vector. The action is split into:\n\n: <math>S=S_G+S_F+S_{FM}+S_M\\;</math>\n\nBoth the gravity and mass terms match those of general relativity with cosmological constant. The skew field action and the skew field matter coupling are:\n\n: <math>S_F=\\int d^4x\\,\\sqrt{-g} \\left( \\frac1{12}F_{\\mu\\nu\\rho}F^{\\mu\\nu\\rho} - \\frac14\\mu^2 A_{\\mu\\nu}A^{\\mu\\nu} \\right)\\;</math>\n\n: <math>S_{FM}=\\int d^4x\\,\\epsilon^{\\alpha\\beta\\mu\\nu}A_{\\alpha\\beta}\\partial_\\mu J_\\nu\\;</math>\n\nwhere\n\n: <math>F_{\\mu\\nu\\rho}=\\partial_\\mu A_{\\nu\\rho}+\\partial_\\rho A_{\\mu\\nu}</math>\n\nand <math>\\epsilon^{\\alpha\\beta\\mu\\nu}\\;</math> is the Levi-Civita symbol. The skew field coupling is a Pauli coupling and is gauge invariant for any source current. The source current looks like a matter fermion field associated with baryon and lepton number.\n\n====Scalar-tensor-vector gravity====\n{{main|Scalar\u2013tensor\u2013vector gravity}}\n\nMoffat's [[Scalar\u2013tensor\u2013vector gravity]]<ref name=Moffat2006 /> contains a tensor, vector and three scalar fields. But the equations are quite straightforward. The action is split into: <math> S=S_G+S_K+S_S+S_M</math> with terms for gravity, vector field <math>K_\\mu,</math> scalar fields <math>G, \\omega, \\mu</math> and mass. <math>S_G</math> is the standard gravity term with the exception that <math>G</math> is moved inside the integral.\n\n: <math>S_K=-\\int d^4x\\,\\sqrt{-g}\\omega \\left( \\frac14 B_{\\mu\\nu} B^{\\mu\\nu} + V(K) \\right), \\qquad \\text{where } \\quad B_{\\mu\\nu}=\\partial_\\mu K_\\nu-\\partial_\\nu K_\\mu.</math>\n\n: <math>S_S = -\\int d^4x\\,\\sqrt{-g} \\frac{1}{G^3} \\left( \\frac12g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\nabla_\\mu G\\,\\nabla_\\nu G -V(G) \\right) + \\frac{1}{G} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\nabla_\\mu\\omega\\,\\nabla_\\nu\\omega -V(\\omega) \\right) +{1\\over\\mu^2G} \\left( \\frac12g^{\\mu\\nu}\\,\\nabla_\\mu\\mu\\,\\nabla_\\nu\\mu - V(\\mu) \\right).</math>\n\nThe potential function for the vector field is chosen to be:\n\n: <math>V(K) = -\\frac12\\mu^2\\varphi^\\mu\\varphi_\\mu - \\frac14g \\left (\\varphi^\\mu \\varphi_\\mu \\right )^2</math>\n\nwhere <math>g</math> is a coupling constant.

For in-depth coverage of these tests, see Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> Ch.39, Will <ref name=Will1981 /> Table 2.1, and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 />.  Most such tests can be categorized as in the following subsections.\n\n=== Self-consistency ===\nSelf-consistency among non-metric theories includes eliminating theories allowing [[tachyon]]s, ghost poles and higher order poles, and those that have problems with behaviour at infinity. Among metric theories, self-consistency is best illustrated by describing several theories that fail this test. The classic example is the spin-two field theory of Fierz and Pauli<ref name=Fierz1939 />); the field equations imply that gravitating bodies move in straight lines, whereas the equations of motion insist that gravity deflects bodies away from straight line motion. Yilmaz (1971)<ref name=Yilmaz1973 /> contains a tensor gravitational field used to construct a metric; it is mathematically inconsistent because the functional dependence of the metric on the tensor field is not well defined.\n\n=== Completeness ===\nTo be complete, a theory of gravity must be capable of analysing the outcome of every experiment of interest. It must therefore mesh with electromagnetism and all other physics. For instance, any theory that cannot predict from first principles the movement of planets or the behaviour of atomic clocks is incomplete.\n\nMany early theories are incomplete in that it is unclear whether the density <math>\\rho</math> used by the theory should be calculated from the stress\u2013energy tensor <math>T</math> as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}u^\\mu u^\\nu</math> or as <math>\\rho=T_{\\mu\\nu}\\delta^{\\mu \\nu}</math>, where <math>u</math> is the [[four-velocity]], and <math>\\delta</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]]. The theories of Thirry (1948) and Jordan<ref name=Jordan1955 /> are incomplete unless Jordan's parameter <math>\\eta\\;</math> is set to -1, in which case they match the theory of Brans\u2013Dicke<ref name=Brans1961 /> and so are worthy of further consideration. Milne<ref name=Milne1948 /> is incomplete because it makes no gravitational red-shift prediction. The theories of Whitrow and Morduch<ref name=Whitrow1960 /><ref name=Whitrow1965 />, Kustaanheimo<ref name=Kustaanheimo1966 /> and Kustaanheimo and Nuotio<ref name=Kustaanheimo1967 /> are either incomplete or inconsistent. The incorporation of Maxwell's equations is incomplete unless it is assumed that they are imposed on the flat background space-time, and when that is done they are inconsistent, because they predict zero gravitational redshift when the wave version of light (Maxwell theory) is used, and nonzero redshift when the particle version (photon) is used. Another more obvious example is Newtonian gravity with Maxwell's equations; light as photons is deflected by gravitational fields (by half that of general relativity) but light as waves is not.\n\n=== Classical tests ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\nThere are three \"classical\" tests (dating back to the 1910s or earlier) of the ability of gravity theories to handle relativistic effects; they are [[gravitational redshift]], [[gravitational lensing]] (generally tested around the Sun), and anomalous perihelion advance of the planets. Each theory should reproduce the observed results in these areas, which have to date always aligned with the predictions of general relativity. In 1964, [[Irwin I. Shapiro]] found a fourth test, called the [[Shapiro delay]]. It is usually regarded as a \"classical\" test as well.\n\n=== Agreement with Newtonian mechanics and special relativity ===\nAs an example of disagreement with Newtonian experiments, Birkhoff<ref name=Birkhoff1943>{{cite journal | last1 = Birkhoff | first1 = G. D. | year = 1943 | title = Matter, electricity and gravitation in flat space-time | url = | journal = Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This was the consequence of an assumption made to simplify handling the collision of masses.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n=== The Einstein equivalence principle ===\n{{Main|Equivalence principle}}\n\nEinstein's Equivalence Principle has three components. The first is the uniqueness of free fall, also known as the Weak Equivalence Principle. This is satisfied if inertial mass is equal to gravitational mass. ''\u03b7'' is a parameter used to test the maximum allowable violation of the Weak Equivalence Principle. The first tests of the Weak Equivalence Principle were done by E\u00f6tv\u00f6s before 1900 and limited ''\u03b7'' to less than 5{{e|-9}}. Modern tests have reduced that to less than 5{{e|-13}}. The second is Lorentz invariance. In the absence of gravitational effects the speed of light is constant. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b4''. The first tests of Lorentz invariance were done by Michelson and Morley before 1890 and limited ''\u03b4'' to less than 5{{e|-3}}. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-21}}. The third is local position invariance, which includes spatial and temporal invariance. The outcome of any local non-gravitational experiment is independent of where and when it is performed. Spatial local position invariance is tested using gravitational redshift measurements. The test parameter for this is ''\u03b1''. Upper limits on this found by Pound and Rebka in 1960 limited ''\u03b1'' to less than 0.1. Modern tests have reduced this to less than 1{{e|-4}}.\n\n[[Leonard I. Schiff|Schiff]]'s conjecture states that any complete, self-consistent theory of gravity that embodies the Weak Equivalence Principle necessarily embodies Einstein's Equivalence Principle. This is likely to be true if the theory has full energy conservation. Metric theories satisfy the Einstein Equivalence Principle. Extremely few non-metric theories satisfy this. For example, the non-metric theory of Belinfante & Swihart<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> is eliminated by the ''TH\u03b5\u03bc'' formalism for testing Einstein's Equivalence Principle.  Gauge theory gravity is a notable exception, where the strong equivalence principle is essentially the [[minimal coupling]] of the [[gauge covariant derivative]].\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian formalism ===\n{{Main|Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism}}\n\nSee also [[Tests of general relativity]], Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> and Will<ref name=Will1981 /> for more information.\n\nWork on developing a standardized rather than ad-hoc set of tests for evaluating alternative gravitation models began with Eddington in 1922 and resulted in a standard set of Parametric post-Newtonian numbers in Nordtvedt and Will<ref name=Nordtvedt1972>{{cite journal | last1 = Nordtvedt Jr | first1 = K. | last2 = Will | first2 = C. M. | year = 1972 | title = Conservation laws and preferred frames in relativistic gravity II | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 177 | issue = | page = 775 | bibcode = 1972ApJ...177..775N | doi = 10.1086/151755 }}</ref> and Will and Nordtvedt<ref name=Will1972 />. Each parameter measures a different aspect of how much a theory departs from Newtonian gravity. Because we are talking about deviation from Newtonian theory here, these only measure weak-field effects. The effects of strong gravitational fields are examined later.\n\nThese ten are: <math>\\gamma, \\beta,\\eta,\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3,\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4.</math>\n\n*<math>\\gamma</math> is a measure of space curvature, being zero for Newtonian gravity and one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\beta</math> is a measure of nonlinearity in the addition of gravitational fields, one for general relativity.\n*<math>\\eta</math> is a check for preferred location effects.\n*<math>\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of \"preferred-frame effects\". Any theory of gravity in which at least one of the three is nonzero is called a preferred-frame theory.\n*<math>\\zeta_1,\\zeta_2,\\zeta_3,\\zeta_4,\\alpha_3</math> measure the extent and nature of breakdowns in global conservation laws. A theory of gravity possesses 4 conservation laws for energy-momentum and 6 for angular momentum only if all five are zero.\n\n=== Strong gravity and gravitational waves ===\n{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}\n\nParametric post-Newtonian is only a measure of weak field effects. Strong gravity effects can be seen in compact objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes. Experimental tests such as the stability of white dwarfs, spin-down rate of pulsars, orbits of binary pulsars and the existence of a black hole horizon can be used as tests of alternative to general relativity. General relativity predicts that gravitational waves travel at the speed of light. Many alternatives to general relativity say that gravitational waves travel faster than light, possibly breaking of causality. After the multi-messaging detection of the GW170817 coalescence of neutron stars, where light and gravitational waves were measured to travel at the same speed with an error of 1/10<sup>15</sup>, many of those modified theory of gravity were excluded.\n\n=== Cosmological tests ===\nMany of these have been developed recently. For those theories that aim to replace [[dark matter]], the [[galaxy rotation curve]], the [[Tully-Fisher relation]], the faster rotation rate of dwarf galaxies, and the [[gravitational lens]]ing due to galactic clusters act as constraints. For those theories that aim to replace [[Cosmic inflation|inflation]], the size of ripples in the spectrum of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] is the strictest test. For those theories that incorporate or aim to replace [[dark energy]], the supernova brightness results and the age of the universe can be used as tests. Another test is the flatness of the universe. With general relativity, the combination of baryonic matter, dark matter and dark energy add up to make the universe exactly flat. As the accuracy of experimental tests improve, alternatives to general relativity that aim to replace dark matter or dark energy will have to explain why.\n\n== Results of testing theories ==\n\n=== Parametric post-Newtonian parameters for a range of theories ===\n(See Will<ref name=Will1981 /> and Ni<ref name=Ni1972 /> for more details. Misner et al.<ref name=Misner1973 /> gives a table for translating parameters from the notation of Ni to that of Will)\n\nGeneral Relativity is now more than 100 years old, during which one alternative theory of gravity after another has failed to agree with ever more accurate observations. One illustrative example is [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism]]. The following table lists Parametric post-Newtonian values for a large number of theories. If the value in a cell matches that in the column heading then the full formula is too complicated to include here.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !!Width=\"45\"|<math>\\gamma</math>\n!

The value closest to zero is listed.\n\nAll experimental tests agree with general relativity so far, and so Parametric post-Newtonian analysis immediately eliminates all the scalar field theories in the table. A full list of Parametric post-Newtonian parameters is not available for Whitehead<ref name=Whitehead1922 />, Deser-Laurent<ref name=Deser1968 />, Bollini-Giambiagi-Tiomino<ref name=Bollini1970 />, but in these three cases <math>\\beta=\\xi</math>,{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} which is in strong conflict with general relativity and experimental results. In particular, these theories predict incorrect amplitudes for the Earth's tides.  (A minor modification of [[Whitehead's theory of gravitation|Whitehead's theory]] avoids this problem.  However, the modification predicts the [[Nordtvedt effect]], which has been experimentally constrained.)\n\n=== Theories that fail other tests ===\nThe stratified theories of Ni<ref name=Ni1973 />, Lee Lightman and Ni<ref name=Lee1974 /> are non-starters because they all fail to explain the perihelion advance of Mercury. The bimetric theories of Lightman and Lee<ref name=Lightman1973 />, Rosen<ref name=Rosen1975 />, Rastall<ref name=Rastall1979 /> all fail some of the tests associated with strong gravitational fields. The scalar-tensor theories include general relativity as a special case, but only agree with the Parametric post-Newtonian values of general relativity when they are equal to general relativity to within experimental error. As experimental tests get more accurate, the deviation of the scalar-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. The same is true of vector-tensor theories, the deviation of the vector-tensor theories from general relativity is being squashed to zero. Further, vector-tensor theories are semi-conservative; they have a nonzero value for <math>\\alpha_2</math> which can have a measurable effect on the Earth's tides. Non-metric theories, such as Belinfante and Swihart,<ref name=Belinfante1957a /><ref name=Belinfante1957b /> usually fail to agree with experimental tests of Einstein's equivalence principle. And that leaves, as a likely valid alternative to general relativity, nothing except possibly Cartan.<ref name=Cartan1922 /> That was the situation until cosmological discoveries pushed the development of modern alternatives.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* Carroll, Sean.
