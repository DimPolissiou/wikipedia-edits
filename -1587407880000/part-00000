It was released in April 1972 by [[RCA Records]] as the lead [[Single (music)|single]] of his fifth studio album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded the song with his backing band known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising guitarist [[Mick Ronson]], bassist [[Trevor Bolder]] and drummer [[Mick Woodmansey]]. A late addition to the album, it was included at the insistence of [[RCA Records|RCA]]'s Dennis Katz, who heard a demo and loved the track, believing it would make a great single. It replaced the [[Chuck Berry]] cover \"[[Around and Around|Round and Round]]\" on the album.\n\n==Overview==\n\"Starman\" was written as a direct response to the head of RCA Dennis Katz's request for a single. It was recorded on 4 February 1972 at [[Trident Studios]] in London,{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} towards the end of the ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]]'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=477}} Also recorded during this session was \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Suicide]]\" and \"[[Suffragette City]]\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded it with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]].<ref name=\"Blum PopMatters\">{{cite magazine|last=Blum|first=Jordan|date=12 July 2012|title=David Bowie \u2013 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/160406-david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from|magazine=[[PopMatters]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101090527/http://www.popmatters.com/review/160406-david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from|archivedate=1 January 2017|accessdate=8 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The song begins on twelve-string acoustic guitar\u2014a \"subdominant\" chord followed by \"the major 7th of the root\" according to author [[Peter Doggett]]\u2014that is played across both channels. There are strums of a six-string electric guitar at certain points until the verse begins, then both guitars merge into one channel.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=169}} The lyrics describe Ziggy Stardust bringing a message of hope to Earth's youth through the radio, salvation by an alien 'Starman'. The story is told from the point of view of one of the youths who hears Ziggy. The song has inspired interpretations ranging from an allusion to the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Christ]],{{sfn|Buckley|1999|pp=148\u2013151}} to an accurate prediction of the plot for the film ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977).{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}} According to Bowie himself, speaking to [[William S. Burroughs]] for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 1973:<ref name=\"Burroughs interview RS\">{{cite web |last1=Copetas |first1=Craig |title=Beat Godfather Meets Glitter Mainman: William Burroughs Interviews David Bowie |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/beat-godfather-meets-glitter-mainman-william-burroughs-interviews-david-bowie-92508/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=19 April 2020 |date=28 February 1974}}</ref> \n\n{{blockquote|\"Ziggy is advised in a dream by the infinites to write the coming of a starman, so he writes \"Starman\", which is the first news of hope that the people have heard. So they latch onto it immediately. The starmen that he is talking about are called the infinites, and they are black-hole jumpers. Ziggy has been talking about this amazing spaceman who will be coming down to save the earth. They arrive somewhere in [[Greenwich Village]]. They don\u2019t have a care in the world and are of no possible use to us. They just happened to stumble into our universe by black-hole jumping. Their whole life is traveling from universe to universe. In the stage show, one of them resembles [[Marlon Brando|Brando]], another one is a black New Yorker. I even have one called Queenie the Infinite Fox.\"}}\n\nThe music is in a gentle [[pop rock]] vein, featuring prominent [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] and a [[String instrument|string]] arrangement by [[Mick Ronson]], not dissimilar to the style of Bowie's previous album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' (1971). Doggett writes that it's similar to \"[[Space Oddity]]\" in that it's a \"space-age novelty hit\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=169}} The chorus is loosely based on \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" from the film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', alluding to the \"Starman\"'s extraterrestrial origins (over the rainbow) (the octave leap on (\"Star-''man''\") is identical to that of [[Judy Garland]]'s (\"some-''where''\") in \"Over the Rainbow\").{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=169}} Doggett states that whereas \"Over the Rainbow\" \"used its cathartic rise to introduce a refrain that was emotionally, and melodically, expansive\", the leap in \"Starman\" \"was followed by a more uncertain melody, reflecting his character's innate lack of confidence.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=169}} Other influences cited for the track are the [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] songs \"[[Telegram Sam]]\" and \"[[Hot Love (Marc Bolan song)|Hot Love]]\" (the \"boogie\" references and \"la la la\" chorus) and [[the Supremes]]' \"[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]\" (the [[morse code]]-esque guitar and piano breaks).{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=169}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=462}}\n\n==Release and critical reception==\n\"Starman\" was released as the lead single of the album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' on 28 April 1972 by [[RCA Records]] (as RCA 2199) with \"[[Suffragette City]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"single liner notes\" /> According to Cann, the single was released in the US on 20 May with a slightly different mix than the UK single: Bowie's spoken intro is edited out and \"to comply with the preferred duration among American radio stations,\" was shortened by ten seconds.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=249}} It subsequently appeared as the fourth track on the album, between \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"It Ain't Easy\", released on 16 June 1972 by RCA.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1972|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8287}}</ref> It was a late addition to the album, replacing a cover of American singer-songwriter [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Around and Around|Round and Round]]\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} According to Rob Sheffield of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', \"Round and Round\" would have fit the concept of the album but it was excessive, as side two featured multiple Berry-style tracks.<ref name=\"Sheffield RS\">{{cite web |last1=Sheffield |first1=Rob |title=How David Bowie Became the 'Starman' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/how-david-bowie-became-the-starman-87301/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=18 April 2020 |date=6 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190627215734/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/how-david-bowie-became-the-starman-87301/ |archive-date=27 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> From a commercial point of view, \"Starman\" was a milestone in Bowie's career, his first hit since 1969's \"[[Space Oddity]]\" three years before. ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] reported that \"many thought it was his first ''record'' since 'Space Oddity'\", and assumed that it was a sequel to the earlier single.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=8}}\n\nThe single initially sold steadily rather than spectacularly but earned many positive reviews. BBC broadcaster [[John Peel]], in his ''Disc & Music Echo'' column wrote: \"Now this is magnificent \u2013 quite superb. \"David Bowie is, with [[Kevin Ayers]], the most important, under-acknowledged innovator in contemporary popular music in Britain and if this record is overlooked it will be nothing less than stark tragedy.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=460\u2013461}} [[Chris Welch]] of ''[[Melody Maker]]'' predicted: \"[Bowie] is taking longer than most to become a superstar, but he should catch up with Rod and [[Marc Bolan|Marc]] soon.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=247}} On 15 June, Bowie and the Spiders from Mars performed \"Starman\" on the [[ITV Granada|Granada]] children's music programme ''[[Lift Off with Ayshea]]'', which was presented by [[Ayshea|Ayshea Brough]], whom Bowie had met as a performer in 1969. Joined by [[Nicky Graham]] on keyboards, according to Pegg, they performed against a \"backdrop of coloured stars\"; Woodmansey had at this point not \"peroxided\" his hair.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=461}} The performance was broadcast on 21 June in a \"post-school\" time slot, where it was witnessed by thousands of British children.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=256}} By 1 July, \"Starman\" rose to number 41 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], earning Bowie an invitation to perform on the BBC television programme ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=258}}\n\n===''Top of the Pops'' performance===\nOn 5 July 1972, Bowie, the Spiders and Graham appeared on ''Top of the Pops'' and performed \"Starman\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=460}} The group played to a pre-recorded backing track, four takes of which were recorded on 29 June, and sang live as per Musicians Union rules.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=257}} Bowie appeared in a brightly-colored rainbow jumpsuit, \"shocking\" red hair and astronaut boots while the Spiders wore blue, pink, scarlet and gold velvet attire.<ref name=\"Sheffield RS\" />{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=258}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=460}} During the performance, Bowie was relaxed and confident and wrapped his arm around Ronson's shoulder, revealing his white-coloured fingernails and, in Cann's words, \"driving home the ambiguous glamour of the Ziggy persona.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=258}} He altered the line \"Some cat was laying down some rock 'n' roll\" to \"Some cat was laying down some get-it-on rock 'n' roll\" as a tribute to Marc Bolan.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=192}} Upon singing the line \"I had to phone someone so I picked on you ooh ooh\", Bowie pointed at the camera, engaging the audience directly, which one fan recalled, \"It was as if Bowie actually singled me out...a chosen one...it was almost a religious experience.\"{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=126}}<ref name=\"Hepworth Guardian\">{{cite web |last1=Hepworth |first1=David |title=How performing Starman on Top of the Pops sent Bowie into the stratosphere |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jan/15/david-bowie-starman-top-of-the-pops |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=19 April 2020 |date=15 January 2016}}</ref> Transmitted the following day,<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/events/art-rock/bowie-performs-starman-on-top-of-the-pops/ |website=Seven Ages of Rock |title=Bowie performs 'Starman' on 'Top of the Pops' |date=5 July 1972 |publisher=[[BBC]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321010546/http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/events/art-rock/bowie-performs-starman-on-top-of-the-pops/ |archivedate=21 March 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> the three minute performance launched Bowie to stardom.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=460}} David Hepworth of ''[[The Guardian]]'' calls the moment he points to the camera the exact moment in which he became a star.<ref name=\"Hepworth Guardian\" /> According to author David Buckley, \"Many fans date their conversion to all things Bowie to this ''Top of the Pops'' appearance\".{{sfn|Buckley|1999|pp=148\u2013151}} It embedded Ziggy Stardust in the nation's consciousness, helping push \"Starman\" to number 10 and the album, released the previous month, to number five.

It was released in April 1972 by [[RCA Records]] as the lead [[Single (music)|single]] of his fifth studio album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded the song with his backing band known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising guitarist [[Mick Ronson]], bassist [[Trevor Bolder]] and drummer [[Mick Woodmansey]]. A late addition to the album, it was included at the insistence of [[RCA Records|RCA]]'s Dennis Katz, who heard a demo and loved the track, believing it would make a great single. It replaced the [[Chuck Berry]] cover \"[[Around and Around|Round and Round]]\" on the album.\n\n==Overview==\n\"Starman\" was written as a direct response to the head of RCA Dennis Katz's request for a single. It was recorded on 4 February 1972 at [[Trident Studios]] in London,{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} towards the end of the ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]]'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=477}} Also recorded during this session was \"[[Rock 'n' Roll Suicide]]\" and \"[[Suffragette City]]\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]], Bowie recorded it with his backing band [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]].<ref name=\"Blum PopMatters\">{{cite magazine|last=Blum|first=Jordan|date=12 July 2012|title=David Bowie \u2013 The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/160406-david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from|magazine=[[PopMatters]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101090527/http://www.popmatters.com/review/160406-david-bowie-the-rise-and-fall-of-ziggy-stardust-and-the-spiders-from|archivedate=1 January 2017|accessdate=8 January 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The song begins on twelve-string acoustic guitar\u2014a \"subdominant\" chord followed by \"the major 7th of the root\" according to author [[Peter Doggett]]\u2014that is played across both channels. There are strums of a six-string electric guitar at certain points until the verse begins, then both guitars merge into one channel.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=169}} The lyrics describe Ziggy Stardust bringing a message of hope to Earth's youth through the radio, salvation by an alien 'Starman'. The story is told from the point of view of one of the youths who hears Ziggy. The song has inspired interpretations ranging from an allusion to the [[Second Coming|Second Coming of Christ]],{{sfn|Buckley|1999|pp=148\u2013151}} to an accurate prediction of the plot for the film ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977).{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}} According to Bowie himself, speaking to [[William S. Burroughs]] for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in 1973:<ref name=\"Burroughs interview RS\">{{cite web |last1=Copetas |first1=Craig |title=Beat Godfather Meets Glitter Mainman: William Burroughs Interviews David Bowie |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/beat-godfather-meets-glitter-mainman-william-burroughs-interviews-david-bowie-92508/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=19 April 2020 |date=28 February 1974}}</ref> \n\n{{blockquote|\"Ziggy is advised in a dream by the infinites to write the coming of a starman, so he writes \"Starman\", which is the first news of hope that the people have heard. So they latch onto it immediately. The starmen that he is talking about are called the infinites, and they are black-hole jumpers. Ziggy has been talking about this amazing spaceman who will be coming down to save the earth. They arrive somewhere in [[Greenwich Village]]. They don\u2019t have a care in the world and are of no possible use to us. They just happened to stumble into our universe by black-hole jumping. Their whole life is traveling from universe to universe. In the stage show, one of them resembles [[Marlon Brando|Brando]], another one is a black New Yorker. I even have one called Queenie the Infinite Fox.\"}}\n\nThe music is in a gentle [[pop rock]] vein, featuring prominent [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] and a [[String instrument|string]] arrangement by [[Mick Ronson]], not dissimilar to the style of Bowie's previous album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' (1971). Doggett writes that it's similar to \"[[Space Oddity]]\" in that it's a \"space-age novelty hit\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=169}} The chorus is loosely based on \"[[Over the Rainbow]]\" from the film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', alluding to the \"Starman\"'s extraterrestrial origins (over the rainbow) (the octave leap on (\"Star-''man''\") is identical to that of [[Judy Garland]]'s (\"some-''where''\") in \"Over the Rainbow\").{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=169}} Doggett states that whereas \"Over the Rainbow\" \"used its cathartic rise to introduce a refrain that was emotionally, and melodically, expansive\", the leap in \"Starman\" \"was followed by a more uncertain melody, reflecting his character's innate lack of confidence.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=169}} Other influences cited for the track are the [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] songs \"[[Telegram Sam]]\" and \"[[Hot Love (Marc Bolan song)|Hot Love]]\" (the \"boogie\" references and \"la la la\" chorus) and [[the Supremes]]' \"[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]\" (the [[morse code]]-esque guitar and piano breaks).{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=169}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=462}}\n\n==Release and critical reception==\n\"Starman\" was released as the lead single of the album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' on 28 April 1972 by [[RCA Records]] (as RCA 2199) with \"[[Suffragette City]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"single liner notes\" /> According to Cann, the single was released in the US on 20 May with a slightly different mix than the UK single: Bowie's spoken intro is edited out and \"to comply with the preferred duration among American radio stations,\" was shortened by ten seconds.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=249}} It subsequently appeared as the fourth track on the album, between \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"It Ain't Easy\", released on 16 June 1972 by RCA.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1972|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SF 8287}}</ref> It was a late addition to the album, replacing a cover of American singer-songwriter [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Around and Around|Round and Round]]\".{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=242}} According to Rob Sheffield of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', \"Round and Round\" would have fit the concept of the album but it was excessive, as side two featured multiple Berry-style tracks.<ref name=\"Sheffield RS\">{{cite web |last1=Sheffield |first1=Rob |title=How David Bowie Became the 'Starman' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/how-david-bowie-became-the-starman-87301/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=18 April 2020 |date=6 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190627215734/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/how-david-bowie-became-the-starman-87301/ |archive-date=27 June 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> From a commercial point of view, \"Starman\" was a milestone in Bowie's career, his first hit since 1969's \"[[Space Oddity]]\" three years before. ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] reported that \"many thought it was his first ''record'' since 'Space Oddity'\", and assumed that it was a sequel to the earlier single.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=8}}\n\nThe single initially sold steadily rather than spectacularly but earned many positive reviews. BBC broadcaster [[John Peel]], in his ''Disc & Music Echo'' column wrote: \"Now this is magnificent \u2013 quite superb. \"David Bowie is, with [[Kevin Ayers]], the most important, under-acknowledged innovator in contemporary popular music in Britain and if this record is overlooked it will be nothing less than stark tragedy.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=460\u2013461}} [[Chris Welch]] of ''[[Melody Maker]]'' predicted: \"[Bowie] is taking longer than most to become a superstar, but he should catch up with Rod and [[Marc Bolan|Marc]] soon.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=247}} On 15 June, Bowie and the Spiders from Mars performed \"Starman\" on the [[ITV Granada|Granada]] children's music programme ''[[Lift Off with Ayshea]]'', which was presented by [[Ayshea|Ayshea Brough]], whom Bowie had met as a performer in 1969.

Despite being a very broad term, applicable to almost every synthetic drug, it is often used to connote synthetic recreational drugs, sometimes even those which have not been designed at all (e.g. [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], the psychedelic side effects of which were discovered unintentionally).\n\nIn some jurisdictions, drugs that are highly similar in structure to a prohibited drug are illegal to trade regardless of that drug's legal status. In other jurisdictions, their trade is a legal grey area, making them [[grey market]] goods.

The most notable of these were [[dibenzoylmorphine]] and [[acetylpropionylmorphine]], which have virtually identical effects to heroin but were not covered by the Opium Convention. This then led the Health Committee of the [[League of Nations]] to pass several resolutions attempting to bring these new drugs under control, ultimately leading in 1930 to the first broad analogues provisions extending legal control to all esters of morphine, oxycodone, and hydromorphone.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1953-01-01_2_page009.html |title=Esters of Morphine |journal=UNODC Bulletin on Narcotics |year=1953 |issue=2 |pages=36\u201338}}</ref> Another early example of what could loosely be termed designer drug use, was during the [[Prohibition era]] in the 1930s, when [[diethyl ether]] was sold and used as an alternative to illegal [[alcoholic beverage]]s in a number of countries.<ref>{{cite book |last=Brecher |first=Edward M. |title=The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs |publisher=Consumer Reports Magazine. |year=1972 |name-list-format=vanc }}</ref>\n\n====1960s\u20131970s====\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, a number of new synthetic hallucinogens were introduced, with a notable example being the sale of highly potent tablets of [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine|DOM]] in [[San Francisco]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Snyder SH, Faillace L, Hollister L |title=2,5-dimethoxy-4-methyl-amphetamine (STP): a new hallucinogenic drug |journal=Science |volume=158 |issue=3801 |pages=669\u201370 |year=1967 |pmid=4860952 |doi=10.1126/science.158.3801.669 }}</ref> There was little scope to prosecute people over drug analogues at this time, with new compounds instead being added to the controlled drug schedules one by one as they became a problem.

Drug Enforcement Administration, McLean, Virginia]</ref> The term gained widespread popularity when [[MDMA]] (ecstasy) experienced a popularity boom in the mid-1980s. When the term was coined in the 1980s, a wide range of [[narcotics]] were being sold as heroin on the black market. Many were based on fentanyl or [[meperidine]]. One, [[Desmethylprodine|MPPP]], was found in some cases to contain an impurity called [[MPTP]], which caused brain damage that could result in a syndrome identical to full-blown [[Parkinson's disease]], from only a single dose.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Case of the Frozen Addicts: How the Solution of an Extraordinary Medical Mystery Spawned a Revolution in the Understanding and Treatment of Parkinson's Disease |year=1996 |volume=335 |issue=26 |pages=2002\u20132003 |vauthors=Fahn S |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |doi=10.1056/NEJM199612263352618}}</ref> Other problems were highly potent fentanyl analogues, which were sold as [[Fentanyl#Illicit use|China White]], that caused many accidental overdoses.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Henderson GL |title=Designer drugs: past history and future prospects |journal=J.

Emergency-scheduling power was used for the first time for [[MDMA]]. In this case, the DEA scheduled MDMA as a Schedule I drug and retained this classification after review, even though their own judge ruled that MDMA should be classified Schedule III on the basis of its demonstrated uses in medicine.<ref>[http://www.thedea.org/drughistory.html TheDEA.org: The History of MDMA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The emergency scheduling power has subsequently been used for a variety of other drugs including [[2C-B]], [[Alphamethyltryptamine|AMT]], and [[Benzylpiperazine|BZP]]. In 2004, a [[piperazine]] drug, [[Trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine|TFMPP]], became the first drug that had been emergency-scheduled to be denied permanent scheduling and revert to legal status.\n\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s also saw the re-emergence of [[methamphetamine]] in the United States as a widespread public health issue, leading to increasing controls on precursor chemicals in an attempt to cut down on domestic manufacture of the drug. This led to several alternative stimulant drugs emerging, the most notable ones being [[methcathinone]] and [[4-methylaminorex]], but, despite attracting enough attention from authorities to provoke legal scheduling of these compounds, their distribution was relatively limited in extent and methamphetamine continued to dominate the illicit synthetic stimulant market overall.<ref>Philip Jenkins.

The idea was that, by selling the chemicals as for \"scientific research\" rather than human consumption, the [[Mens rea|intent]] clause of the U.S. [[analogue drug]] laws would be avoided. Nonetheless, the DEA raided multiple suppliers, first JLF Primary Materials, and then multiple vendors (such as [[RAC Research]]) several years later in [[Operation Web Tryp]]. This process was accelerated greatly when vendors began advertising via search engines like [[Google]] by linking their sites to searches on key words such as chemical names and terms like [[psychedelic drugs|psychedelic]] or [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogen]]. Widespread discussion of consumptive use and the sources for the chemicals in public forums also drew the attention of the media and authorities.\n\nIn 2004, the US Drug Enforcement Administration raided and shut down several Internet-based research chemical vendors in an operation called ''Web Tryp''. With help from the authorities in India and China, two chemical manufacturers were also closed. Many other internet-based vendors promptly stopped doing business, even though their products were still legal throughout much of the world.\n\nMost substances that were sold as \"research chemicals\" in this period of time are hallucinogens and bear a chemical resemblance to drugs such as [[psilocybin]] and [[mescaline]]. As with other hallucinogens, these substances are often taken for the purposes of facilitating [[spirituality|spiritual]] [[entheogen|processes]], [[Psychedelic drug|mental reflection]] or [[recreational drug|recreation]]. Some research chemicals on the market were not psychoactive, but can be used as [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] in the [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of other potentially psychoactive substances, for example, [[2C-H]], which could be used to make [[2C-B]] and [[2C-I]] among others. Extensive surveys of structural variations have been conducted by pharmaceutical corporations, universities and independent researchers over the last century, from which some of the presently available research chemicals derive. One particularly notable researcher is Dr. [[Alexander Shulgin]], who presented syntheses and [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] explorations of hundreds of substances in the books ''[[TiHKAL]]'' and ''[[PiHKAL]]'' (co-authored with [[Ann Shulgin]]), and has served as an expert witness for the defense in several court cases against manufacturers of psychoactive drugs.\n\nThe majority of chemical suppliers sold research chemicals in bulk form as powder, not as pills, as selling in pill form would invalidate the claims that they were being sold for non-consumptive research. Active dosages vary widely from substance to substance, ranging from micrograms to hundreds of milligrams, but while it is critical for the end user to weigh doses with a precision scale, instead of guessing (\"eyeballing\"), many users did not do this and this led to many emergency room visits and several deaths, which were a prominent factor leading to the emergency scheduling of several substances and eventually Operation Web Tryp. Some compounds such as [[2C-B]] and [[5-Meo-DiPT]] did eventually increase in popularity to the point that they were sold in pill form to reach a wider market, and acquired popular street names (\"Nexus\" and \"Foxy,\" respectively). Once a chemical reaches this kind of popularity, it is usually just a matter of time before it is added to the list of scheduled (i.e., illegal) drugs.\n\nThe late 1990s and early 2000s also saw the first widespread use of novel [[anabolic steroid]]s by athletes in competition. Steroids had been banned by the [[International Olympic Committee]] since 1976, but due to the large number of different anabolic agents available for human and veterinary use, the ability of laboratories to test for all available drugs had always lagged behind the ability of athletes to find new compounds to use. The introduction of increasingly formalised testing procedures, especially with the creation of the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] in 1999, made it much more difficult for athletes to get away with using these drugs without detection, which then led to the synthesis of novel and potent anabolic steroid drugs such as [[tetrahydrogestrinone]] (THG), which were not detectable by the standard tests.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Malvey TC, Armsey TD |title=Tetrahydrogestrinone: the discovery of a designer steroid |journal=Curr Sports Med Rep |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=227\u201330 |year=2005 |pmid=16004834 |doi=10.1097/01.csmr.0000306213.87433.11 }}</ref>\n\n====2005\u20132016====\n[[File:Designer_Drugs.jpg|thumb|right|Popular designer drugs, 1990s-2016]]\nWhile through recent history most designer drugs had been either opioids, hallucinogens, or anabolic steroids, the range of possible compounds is limited only by the scientific and patent literature, and recent years have been characterised by a broadening of the range of compounds sold as designer drugs.

In other jurisdictions, their trade is a legal grey area, making them [[grey market]] goods.

The most notable of these were [[dibenzoylmorphine]] and [[acetylpropionylmorphine]], which have virtually identical effects to heroin but were not covered by the Opium Convention. This then led the Health Committee of the [[League of Nations]] to pass several resolutions attempting to bring these new drugs under control, ultimately leading in 1930 to the first broad analogues provisions extending legal control to all esters of morphine, oxycodone, and hydromorphone.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1953-01-01_2_page009.html |title=Esters of Morphine |journal=UNODC Bulletin on Narcotics |year=1953 |issue=2 |pages=36\u201338}}</ref> Another early example of what could loosely be termed designer drug use, was during the [[Prohibition era]] in the 1930s, when [[diethyl ether]] was sold and used as an alternative to illegal [[alcoholic beverage]]s in a number of countries.<ref>{{cite book |last=Brecher |first=Edward M. |title=The Consumers Union Report on Licit and Illicit Drugs |publisher=Consumer Reports Magazine. |year=1972 |name-list-format=vanc }}</ref>\n\n====1960s\u20131970s====\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, a number of new synthetic hallucinogens were introduced, with a notable example being the sale of highly potent tablets of [[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine|DOM]] in [[San Francisco]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Snyder SH, Faillace L, Hollister L |title=2,5-dimethoxy-4-methyl-amphetamine (STP): a new hallucinogenic drug |journal=Science |volume=158 |issue=3801 |pages=669\u201370 |year=1967 |pmid=4860952 |doi=10.1126/science.158.3801.669 }}</ref> There was little scope to prosecute people over drug analogues at this time, with new compounds instead being added to the controlled drug schedules one by one as they became a problem. One significant court case from this period was in 1973, when [[Tim Scully]] and [[Nicholas Sand]] were prosecuted for making the acetyl amide of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], known as [[ALD-52]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}} At this time ALD-52 was not a controlled drug, but they were convicted on the grounds that in order to make ALD-52, they would have had to be in possession of LSD, which was illegal.

When the term was coined in the 1980s, a wide range of [[narcotics]] were being sold as heroin on the black market. Many were based on fentanyl or [[meperidine]]. One, [[Desmethylprodine|MPPP]], was found in some cases to contain an impurity called [[MPTP]], which caused brain damage that could result in a syndrome identical to full-blown [[Parkinson's disease]], from only a single dose.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Case of the Frozen Addicts: How the Solution of an Extraordinary Medical Mystery Spawned a Revolution in the Understanding and Treatment of Parkinson's Disease |year=1996 |volume=335 |issue=26 |pages=2002\u20132003 |vauthors=Fahn S |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine |doi=10.1056/NEJM199612263352618}}</ref> Other problems were highly potent fentanyl analogues, which were sold as [[Fentanyl#Illicit use|China White]], that caused many accidental overdoses.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Henderson GL |title=Designer drugs: past history and future prospects |journal=J.

Emergency-scheduling power was used for the first time for [[MDMA]]. In this case, the DEA scheduled MDMA as a Schedule I drug and retained this classification after review, even though their own judge ruled that MDMA should be classified Schedule III on the basis of its demonstrated uses in medicine.<ref>[http://www.thedea.org/drughistory.html TheDEA.org: The History of MDMA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The emergency scheduling power has subsequently been used for a variety of other drugs including [[2C-B]], [[Alphamethyltryptamine|AMT]], and [[Benzylpiperazine|BZP]]. In 2004, a [[piperazine]] drug, [[Trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine|TFMPP]], became the first drug that had been emergency-scheduled to be denied permanent scheduling and revert to legal status.\n\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s also saw the re-emergence of [[methamphetamine]] in the United States as a widespread public health issue, leading to increasing controls on precursor chemicals in an attempt to cut down on domestic manufacture of the drug. This led to several alternative stimulant drugs emerging, the most notable ones being [[methcathinone]] and [[4-methylaminorex]], but, despite attracting enough attention from authorities to provoke legal scheduling of these compounds, their distribution was relatively limited in extent and methamphetamine continued to dominate the illicit synthetic stimulant market overall.<ref>Philip Jenkins.

The idea was that, by selling the chemicals as for \"scientific research\" rather than human consumption, the [[Mens rea|intent]] clause of the U.S. [[analogue drug]] laws would be avoided. Nonetheless, the DEA raided multiple suppliers, first JLF Primary Materials, and then multiple vendors (such as [[RAC Research]]) several years later in [[Operation Web Tryp]]. This process was accelerated greatly when vendors began advertising via search engines like [[Google]] by linking their sites to searches on key words such as chemical names and terms like [[psychedelic drugs|psychedelic]] or [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogen]]. Widespread discussion of consumptive use and the sources for the chemicals in public forums also drew the attention of the media and authorities.\n\nIn 2004, the US Drug Enforcement Administration raided and shut down several Internet-based research chemical vendors in an operation called ''Web Tryp''. With help from the authorities in India and China, two chemical manufacturers were also closed. Many other internet-based vendors promptly stopped doing business, even though their products were still legal throughout much of the world.\n\nMost substances that were sold as \"research chemicals\" in this period of time are hallucinogens and bear a chemical resemblance to drugs such as [[psilocybin]] and [[mescaline]]. As with other hallucinogens, these substances are often taken for the purposes of facilitating [[spirituality|spiritual]] [[entheogen|processes]], [[Psychedelic drug|mental reflection]] or [[recreational drug|recreation]]. Some research chemicals on the market were not psychoactive, but can be used as [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursors]] in the [[chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of other potentially psychoactive substances, for example, [[2C-H]], which could be used to make [[2C-B]] and [[2C-I]] among others. Extensive surveys of structural variations have been conducted by pharmaceutical corporations, universities and independent researchers over the last century, from which some of the presently available research chemicals derive. One particularly notable researcher is Dr. [[Alexander Shulgin]], who presented syntheses and [[pharmacology|pharmacological]] explorations of hundreds of substances in the books ''[[TiHKAL]]'' and ''[[PiHKAL]]'' (co-authored with [[Ann Shulgin]]), and has served as an expert witness for the defense in several court cases against manufacturers of psychoactive drugs.\n\nThe majority of chemical suppliers sold research chemicals in bulk form as powder, not as pills, as selling in pill form would invalidate the claims that they were being sold for non-consumptive research. Active dosages vary widely from substance to substance, ranging from micrograms to hundreds of milligrams, but while it is critical for the end user to weigh doses with a precision scale, instead of guessing (\"eyeballing\"), many users did not do this and this led to many emergency room visits and several deaths, which were a prominent factor leading to the emergency scheduling of several substances and eventually Operation Web Tryp. Some compounds such as [[2C-B]] and [[5-Meo-DiPT]] did eventually increase in popularity to the point that they were sold in pill form to reach a wider market, and acquired popular street names (\"Nexus\" and \"Foxy,\" respectively). Once a chemical reaches this kind of popularity, it is usually just a matter of time before it is added to the list of scheduled (i.e., illegal) drugs.\n\nThe late 1990s and early 2000s also saw the first widespread use of novel [[anabolic steroid]]s by athletes in competition. Steroids had been banned by the [[International Olympic Committee]] since 1976, but due to the large number of different anabolic agents available for human and veterinary use, the ability of laboratories to test for all available drugs had always lagged behind the ability of athletes to find new compounds to use. The introduction of increasingly formalised testing procedures, especially with the creation of the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] in 1999, made it much more difficult for athletes to get away with using these drugs without detection, which then led to the synthesis of novel and potent anabolic steroid drugs such as [[tetrahydrogestrinone]] (THG), which were not detectable by the standard tests.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Malvey TC, Armsey TD |title=Tetrahydrogestrinone: the discovery of a designer steroid |journal=Curr Sports Med Rep |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=227\u201330 |year=2005 |pmid=16004834 |doi=10.1097/01.csmr.0000306213.87433.11 }}</ref>\n\n====2005\u20132016====\n[[File:Designer_Drugs.jpg|thumb|right|Popular designer drugs, 1990s-2016]]\nWhile through recent history most designer drugs had been either opioids, hallucinogens, or anabolic steroids, the range of possible compounds is limited only by the scientific and patent literature, and recent years have been characterised by a broadening of the range of compounds sold as designer drugs.

Since many designer drugs sold in recent years have had little or no published research that could help inform such a decision, they have been widely sold as \"legal highs\", often for months, before sufficient evidence accumulates to justify placing them on the controlled drug schedules.\n\n===Common names===\nIn the UK to avoid being controlled by the [[Medicines Act 1968|Medicines Act]], designer drugs such as [[mephedrone]] have been described as '''\"plant food,\"''' despite the compounds having no history of being used for these purposes.<ref name=acmdreport>{{cite web|url= http://drugs.homeoffice.gov.uk/publication-search/acmd/ACMD-cathinones-report.pdf |archive-url= http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100402214933/http%3A//drugs.homeoffice.gov.uk/publication%2Dsearch/acmd/ACMD%2Dcathinones%2Dreport.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 April 2010 |title=Consideration of the cathinones |date=31 March 2010 |publisher=Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs |page=25 |accessdate=1 April 2010}}</ref><ref name=bbc2711>{{Cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tees/8370130.stm |title=Police warning over 'bubble' drug |date=20 November 2009 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2009-11-27}}</ref><ref name=reed1301>{{Cite news|last=Reed |first=Jim |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/health/newsid_10000000/newsid_10004300/10004366.stm |title=Clubbers are 'turning to new legal high mephedrone' |publisher=BBC News |date=13 January 2010|accessdate=2010-07-04}}</ref>\n\nIn the US, similar descriptions ('''\"[[Bath salts (drug)|bath salts]]\"''' is the most common) have been used to describe mephedrone as well as [[methylone]] and [[methylenedioxypyrovalerone]] (MDPV).<ref>{{cite news|url= http://blog.al.com/breaking/2011/02/synthetic_form_of_cocaine_and.html|title=Synthetic form of cocaine and methamphetamine being packaged as bath salts|publisher=The Huntsville Times |first=Victoria |last=Cumbow |name-list-format=vanc |date=2011-02-06|accessdate=2011-02-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/29/reports-miami-zombie-attacker-may-have-been-using-bath-salts |title=Reports: Miami 'zombie' attacker may have been using 'bath salts' |publisher=CNN |date=May 29, 2012 }}</ref> Combined with labeling that they are \"not for human consumption,\" these descriptions are an attempt to skirt the [[Federal Analog Act]] which forbids drugs that are \"substantially similar\" to already classified drugs from being sold for human use.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/17/us/17salts.html|title=An Alarming New Stimulant, Legal in Many States |work=New York Times |first1=Abby |last1=Goodnough |first2=Katie |last2=Zezima |name-list-format=vanc |date=2011-07-16|accessdate=2012-01-15}}</ref>\n\n[[Synthetic cannabinoids]] are known under a variety of names including K2, Spice, Black Mamba, Bombay Blue, Genie, Zohai,<ref name=\"webmd\">{{Cite news|url= https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/news/20120924/k2-trend-not-slowing-down#1|title=K2 Trend Not Slowing Down|work=WebMD|access-date=2018-05-12 }}</ref> Banana Cream Nuke, Krypton, and Lava Red.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fattore L, Fratta W |title=Beyond THC: The New Generation of Cannabinoid Designer Drugs |journal=Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience |volume=5 |pages=60 |date=2011-09-21 |pmid=22007163 |pmc=3187647 |doi=10.3389/fnbeh.2011.00060 }}</ref> They are often called \"synthetic marijuana,\" \"herbal incense,\" or \"herbal smoking blends\" and often labeled \"not for human consumption.\"<ref name=\"webmd\" />\n\n==List==\n{{Main|List of designer drugs}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Controlled Substances Act]]\n* [[Controlled Substance Analogue Enforcement of 1986]]\n* [[New chemical entity]]\n* [[Operation Web Tryp]]\n* [[Pharmaceutical company]]\n* [[Psychoactive Substances Act 2013]] \u2013 New Zealand\n* [[Psychoactive Substances Act 2016]] \u2013 UK ban on all drugs based on psychoactive effect\n* [[Research chemical]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Designer drugs}}\n*[http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index5733EN.html Substances and classifications table (31/10/2008) \u2013 European Legal Database on Drugs] Report on all substances controlled in at least one EU country in XLS format\n*[https://www.chemograph.de/dd2017/substanceListing.html Designer Drug Compound List] at Chemograph Plus, DigiLab Software GmbH\n\n{{Drug use}}\n\n[[Category:Designer drugs| ]]\n[[Category:Ethically disputed business practices]]\n[[Category:Drug culture]]\n", "name_user": "Maddtroller", "label": "safe", "comment": "Wikilinked mention of LSD to appropriate article", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designer_drug"}

For this reason, he sometimes took a voice memo or simply just ended up writing the whole song if it was something he desired to dive deeper into.<ref name=\"Maduakolam\">{{cite web | author=Maduakolam, Emmanuel| title=Juice WRLD Talks &quot;Lucid Dreams&quot; and Emo Rap| url=https://hypebeast.com/2018/7/juice-wrld-interview-goodbye-and-good-riddance|work=Hypebeast|publisher=Hypebeast Limited| date=July 31, 2018| accessdate=August 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Lyrical themes===\nHiggins saw the value in his position as one of very few contemporary [[SoundCloud]] artists who could compose soul-bearing [[ballad]]s and [[ode]]s but remain comfortable [[freestyle rap]]ping over classic hip hop beats.<ref name=\"Rindner\"/> Rather than eschewing it, his freestyles emphasize [[wordplay]] and feel indebted to the art form's tradition.<ref name=\"Rindner\"/> He was asked for his opinion on why freestyles no longer are considered the [[rite of passage]] in [[hip hop culture]] as they once were.
