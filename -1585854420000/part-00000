In 1832, Dr. JJ Hjort conducted the first leprosy survey, thus establishing a basis for epidemiological surveys. Subsequent surveys resulted in the establishment of a national leprosy registry to study the causes of leprosy and for tracking of the rate of infection.\n\nEarly leprosy research throughout Europe was conducted by Norwegian scientists [[Daniel Cornelius Danielssen]] and [[Carl Wilhelm Boeck]]. Their work resulted in the establishment of the National Leprosy Research and Treatment Center. Danielssen and Boeck believed the cause of leprosy transmission was hereditary.

In 1832, Dr. JJ Hjort conducted the first leprosy survey, thus establishing a basis for epidemiological surveys.

The armed conflict started when the Greek forces landed in [[Smyrna]] (now [[Izmir]]), on 15 May 1919. They advanced inland and took control of the western and northwestern part of Anatolia, including the cities of [[Manisa]], [[Bal\u0131kesir]], [[Ayd\u0131n]], [[K\u00fctahya]], [[Bursa]] and [[Eski\u015fehir]]. Their advance was checked by Turkish forces at the [[Battle of Sakarya]] in 1921. The Greek front collapsed with the [[Great Offensive|Turkish counter-attack]] in August 1922, and the war effectively ended with the [[Turkish capture of Smyrna|recapture of Smyrna]] by Turkish forces and the [[great fire of Smyrna]].\n\nAs a result, the Greek government accepted the demands of the Turkish National Movement and returned to its pre-war borders, thus leaving [[East Thrace]] and Western Anatolia to Turkey. The Allies abandoned the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] to negotiate a new treaty at Lausanne with the Turkish National Movement. The [[Treaty of Lausanne]] recognized the independence of the Republic of Turkey and its sovereignty over Asia Minor, [[Istanbul]], and Eastern [[Thrace]]. The Greek and Turkish governments agreed to engage in [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|a population exchange]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Geopolitical context===\n{{Main|Partition of the Ottoman Empire}}\n{{Further|Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne}}\n[[File:ParisPeace-Venizelos-Map.png|thumb|left|158px|Map of [[Megali idea|Megali Idea]]]]\nThe geopolitical context of this conflict is linked to the partitioning of the [[Ottoman Empire]] which was a direct consequence of [[World War I]] and involvement of the Ottomans in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle Eastern theatre]]. The Greeks received an order to land in [[Izmir|Smyrna]] by the [[Triple Entente]] as part of the partition. During this war, the Ottoman government collapsed completely and the Ottoman Empire was divided amongst the victorious Entente powers with the signing of the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] on August 10, 1920.\n\nThere were a number of secret agreements regarding the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I. The Triple Entente had made contradictory promises about post-war arrangements concerning Greek hopes in [[Asia Minor]].<ref name = \"Steven W.

Before the occupation the Italian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, angry about the possibility of the Greek occupation of Western Anatolia, left the conference and did not return to Paris until May 5. The absence of the Italian delegation from the Conference ended up facilitating Lloyd George's efforts to persuade France and the United States to support Greece and prevent Italian operations in Western Anatolia.\n\nAccording to some historians, it was the Greek occupation of Smyrna that created the Turkish National movement. [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] argues: \"The war between Turkey and Greece which burst out at this time was a defensive war for safeguarding of the Turkish homelands in Anatolia. It was a result of the Allied policy of imperialism operating in a foreign state, the military resources and powers of which were seriously under-estimated; it was provoked by the unwarranted invasion of a Greek army of occupation.\"<ref name=\"Arnold J 1926, p. 94\">{{Citation | first1 = Arnold J | last1 = Toynbee | author1-link = Arnold J.

Greeks had lived in Asia Minor since antiquity, and before the outbreak of World War I, up to 2.5 million Greeks lived in the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"Turkey Page 79\">Roberts, Thomas Duval. ''Area Handbook for the Republic of Turkey''. p. 79</ref> The suggestion that the Greeks constituted the majority of the population in the lands claimed by Greece has been contested by a number of historians. Cedric James Lowe and Michael L. Dockrill also argued that Greek claims about Smyrna were at best debatable, since Greeks constituted perhaps a bare majority, more likely a large minority in the [[Smyrna Vilayet]], \"which lay in an overwhelmingly Turkish Anatolia.\"{{Sfn | Lowe | Dockrill | 2002 | p = 367}} Precise demographics are further obscured by the Ottoman policy of dividing the population according to religion rather than descent, language, or self-identification. On the other hand, contemporaneous British and American statistics (1919) support the point that the Greek element was the most numerous in the region of Smyrna, counting 375,000, while Muslims were 325,000.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Zamir|first= Meir| title= Population Statistics of the Ottoman Empire in 1914 and 1919 | journal = Middle Eastern Studies|year=1981|volume=7|issue=1|pages= 85\u2013106|jstor= 4282818| doi=10.1080/00263208108700459}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Montgomery |first= AE |title= The Making of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres of 10 August 1920|journal = The Historical Journal | year=1972|volume=15|issue= 4|page=775|doi= 10.1017/S0018246X0000354X}}</ref>\n\nGreek Prime Minister Venizelos stated to a British newspaper that \"Greece is not making war against Islam, but against the anachronistic Ottoman Government, and its corrupt, ignominious, and bloody administration, with a view to expelling it from those territories where the majority of the population consists of Greeks.\"<ref>{{Citation | title = Not War Against Islam \u2013 Statement by Greek Prime Minister | newspaper = [[The Scotsman]] | date = June 29, 1920 | page = 5}}.</ref>\n\nTo an extent, the above danger may have been overstated by Venizelos as a negotiating card on the table of S\u00e8vres, in order to gain the support of the Allied governments. For example, the [[Young Turks]] were not in power at the time of the war, which makes such a justification less straightforward. Most of the leaders of that regime had fled the country at the end of World War I and the Ottoman government in [[Constantinople]] was already under British control. Furthermore, Venizelos had already revealed his desires for annexation of territories from the Ottoman Empire in the early stages of World War I, before these massacres had taken place. In a letter sent to Greek [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine]] in January 1915, he wrote that: \"I have the impression that the concessions to Greece in Asia Minor&nbsp;... would be so extensive that another equally large and not less rich Greece will be added to the doubled Greece which emerged from the victorious Balkan wars.\"{{Sfn | Smith | 1999 | p = 35}}\n\nThrough its failure, the Greek invasion may have instead exacerbated the atrocities that it was supposed to prevent.

Toynbee blamed the policies pursued by Great Britain and Greece, and the decisions of the Paris Peace conference as factors leading to the atrocities committed by both sides during and after the war: \"The Greeks of 'Pontus' and the Turks of the Greek occupied territories, were in some degree victims of Mr. Venizelos's and Mr. Lloyd George's original miscalculations at Paris.\"{{Sfn | Toynbee | 1922 | pp = 312\u201313}}\n\n===Greek irredentism===\n{{Main|Megali Idea}}\n[[File:Hellenism in the Near East 1918.jpg|thumb|right|195px|The Greek Kingdom and the Greek diaspora in the Balkans and western Asia Minor, according to a 1919 Greek map submitted to the Paris Peace Conference]]\nOne of the main motivations for initiating the war was to realize the Megali (Great) Idea, a core concept of Greek nationalism. The Megali Idea was an [[irredentist]] vision of a restoration of a Greater Greece on both sides of the Aegean that would incorporate territories with Greek populations outside the borders of the [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]], which was initially very small \u2014 roughly half the size of the present-day [[Republic of Greece]]. From the time of Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1830, the Megali Idea had played a major role in Greek politics. Greek politicians, since the independence of the Greek state, had made several speeches on the issue of the \"historic inevitability of the expansion of the Greek Kingdom.\"{{Sfn | Smith | 1999 | p = 3}} For instance, Greek politician Ioannis Kolettis voiced this conviction in the assembly in 1844: \"There are two great centres of Hellenism. Athens is the capital of the Kingdom. Constantinople is the great capital, the City, the dream and hope of all Greeks.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe Great Idea was not merely the product of 19th century nationalism. It was, in one of its aspects, deeply rooted in many Greeks' religious consciousnesses. This aspect was the recovery of Constantinople for Christendom and the reestablishment of the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]] which had fallen in 1453. \"Ever since this time the recovery of [[Hagia Sophia|St. Sophia]] and the City had been handed down from generation to generation as the destiny and aspiration of the Greek Orthodox.\"{{Sfn | Smith | 1999 | p = 3}} The Megali Idea, besides Constantinople, included most traditional lands of the Greeks including [[Crete]], [[Thessaly]], [[Epirus]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Thrace]], the [[Aegean Islands]], [[Cyprus]], the coastlands of [[Asia Minor]] and [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] on the [[Black Sea]]. Asia Minor was an essential part of the Greek world and an area of enduring Greek cultural dominance. In antiquity, from late [[Bronze Age]] up to the [[Roman empire|Roman conquest]], Greek city-states had even exercised political control of most of the region, except the period ca. 550\u2013470 BC when it was part of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaimenid Persian Empire]]. Later, during Middle Ages, the region had belonged to the Byzantine Empire until the 12th century, when the first [[Seljuk Turk]] raids reached it.\n\n===The National Schism in Greece===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n{{See also|National Schism}}\nThe National Schism in Greece was the deep split of Greek politics and society between two factions, the one led by Eleftherios Venizelos and the other by King Constantine, that predated World War I but escalated significantly over the decision on which side Greece should support during the war.\n\nThe United Kingdom had hoped that strategic considerations might persuade Constantine to join the cause of the Allies, but the King and his supporters insisted on strict neutrality, especially whilst the outcome of the conflict was hard to predict. In addition, family ties and emotional attachments made it difficult for Constantine to decide which side to support during World War I. The King's dilemma was further increased when the [[Ottomans]] and the [[Bulgarians]], both having grievances and aspirations against the Greek Kingdom, joined the [[Central Powers]].\n\nThough Constantine did remain decidedly neutral, [[List of Prime Ministers of Greece|Prime Minister of Greece]] Eleftherios Venizelos had from an early point decided that Greece's interests would be best served by joining the Entente and started diplomatic efforts with the Allies to prepare the ground for concessions following an eventual victory. The disagreement and the subsequent dismissal of Venizelos by the King resulted in a deep personal rift between the two, which spilled over into their followers and the wider Greek society. Greece became divided into two radically opposed political camps, as Venizelos set up a separate state in Northern Greece, and eventually, with Allied support, forced the King to abdicate. In May 1917, after the exile of Constantine, Veniz\u00e9los returned to [[Athens]] and allied with the Entente. Greek military forces (though divided between supporters of the monarchy and supporters of \"[[Venizelism]]\") began to take part in military operations against the [[Military of Bulgaria|Bulgarian Army]] on the border.\n\nThe act of entering the war and the preceding events resulted in a deep political and social division in post\u2013World War I Greece. The country's foremost political formations, the Venizelist Liberals and the Royalists, already involved in a long and bitter rivalry over pre-war politics, reached a state of outright hatred towards each other. Both parties viewed the other's actions during the First World War as politically illegitimate and treasonous. This enmity inevitably spread throughout Greek society, creating a deep rift that contributed decisively to the failed [[Asia Minor]] campaign and resulted in much social unrest in the inter war years.\n\n==Greek expansion==\n[[File:Greco Turkish War 1919-1922.svg|right|thumb|240px|Map of the military developments until August 1922]]\nThe military aspect of the war began with the [[Armistice of Mudros]]. The military operations of the Greco-Turkish war can be roughly divided into three main phases: the first phase, spanning the period from May 1919 to October 1920, encompassed the Greek Landings in Asia Minor and their consolidation along the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] Coast. The second phase lasted from October 1920 to August 1921, and was characterised by Greek offensive operations. The third and final phase lasted until August 1922, when the strategic initiative was held by the Turkish Army.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Landing at Smyrna (May 1919)===\n{{Main|Greek landing at Smyrna}}\n[[File:Greek occupation troops landing on Smyrna.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Arrival of Crown Prince [[George II of Greece|George]] in Smyrna, 1919]]\n[[File:Izmir15Mayis1919.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] soldiers taking their posts in Smyrna ({{lang-tr|Izmir}}) amidst the jubilant ethnic Greek population of the city, 15 May 1919]]\nOn May 15, 1919, twenty thousand{{Sfn |Kinross|1960|p= 154}} Greek soldiers landed in Smyrna and took control of the city and its surroundings under cover of the Greek, French, and British navies.

The overall strategic objective of these operations, which were met by increasingly stiff Turkish resistance, was to provide strategic depth to the defence of Izmir (Smyrna). To that end, the Greek zone of occupation was extended over all of Western and most of North-Western Anatolia.\n\n===Treaty of S\u00e8vres (August 1920)===\n{{Main|Treaty of S\u00e8vres}}\n[[File:Treaty of S\u00e8vres 1920.svg|left|270px|thumb|Partition of the [[Ottoman Empire]] according to the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]]]]\nIn return for the contribution of the Greek army on the side of the Allies, the Allies supported the assignment of eastern Thrace and the millet of Smyrna to Greece. This treaty ended the First World War in Asia Minor and, at the same time, sealed the fate of the Ottoman Empire. Henceforth, the Ottoman Empire would no longer be a European power.\n\nOn August 10, 1920, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of S\u00e8vres ceding to Greece Thrace, up to the [[\u00c7atalca#Modern period|Chatalja lines]]. More importantly, Turkey renounced to Greece all rights over Imbros and Tenedos, retaining the small territories of Constantinople, the islands of Marmara, and \"a tiny strip of European territory\". The Straits of Bosporus were placed under an International Commission, as they were now open to all.\n\nTurkey was furthermore forced to transfer to Greece \"the exercise of her rights of sovereignty\" over Smyrna in addition to \"a considerable Hinterland, merely retaining a 'flag over an outer fort'.\" Though Greece administered the Smyrna enclave, its sovereignty remained, nominally, with the Sultan. According to the provisions of the Treaty, Smyrna was to maintain a local parliament and, if within five years time she asked to be incorporated within the Kingdom of Greece, the provision was made that the League of Nations would hold a plebiscite to decide on such matters.\n\nThe treaty was never ratified by the Ottoman Empire<ref name=\"Sunga\">{{cite book| last = Sunga| first = Lyal S.| title = Individual Responsibility in International Law for Serious Human Rights Violations| date = 1992-01-01| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff| isbn = 978-0-7923-1453-0 }}</ref><ref name=\"Bernhardsson\">{{cite book|last = Bernhardsson |first=Magnus |title=Reclaiming a Plundered Past: Archaeology and Nation Building in Modern Iraq | date =2005-12-20 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0-292-70947-8}}</ref> nor Greece.<ref name=\"www2.mfa.gr\">{{Citation|place=[[Kingdom of Greece|GR]] |url=http://www2.mfa.gr/NR/rdonlyres/3E053BC1-EB11-404A-BA3E-A4B861C647EC/0/1923_lausanne_treaty.doc |title=Treaty of Lausanne |date=24 July 1923 |publisher=MFA |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629163221/http://www2.mfa.gr/NR/rdonlyres/3E053BC1-EB11-404A-BA3E-A4B861C647EC/0/1923_lausanne_treaty.doc |archivedate=29 June 2007 }}.</ref>{{Better source|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Greek advance (October 1920)===\nIn October 1920, the Greek army advanced further east into Anatolia, with the encouragement of Lloyd George, who intended to increase pressure on the Turkish and Ottoman governments to sign the Treaty of S\u00e8vres. This advance began under the Liberal government of Eleftherios Venizelos, but soon after the offensive began, Venizelos fell from power and was replaced by [[Dimitrios Gounaris]]. The strategic objective of these operations was to defeat the Turkish Nationalists and force [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]] into peace negotiations. The advancing Greeks, still holding superiority in numbers and modern equipment at this point, had hoped for an early battle in which they were confident of breaking up ill-equipped Turkish forces. Yet they met with little resistance, as the Turks managed to retreat in an orderly fashion and avoid encirclement. Churchill said: \"The Greek columns trailed along the country roads passing safely through many ugly [[Defile (geography)|defiles]], and at their approach the Turks, under strong and sagacious leadership, vanished into the recesses of Anatolia.\"{{Sfn | Kinross|1960| p = 233}}\n\n===Change in Greek government (November 1920)===\n[[File:Papoulas Anastasios.JPG|thumb|240px|right|[[Anastasios Papoulas]], commander-in-chief of the Greek [[Army of Asia Minor]]]]\nDuring October 1920, [[Alexander of Greece|King Alexander]], who had been installed on the Greek throne on 11 June 1917 when his father Constantine was pushed into exile by the Venizelists, was bitten by a monkey kept at the Royal Gardens and died within days from [[sepsis]].<ref name= \"ahistoryofgreece.com\">{{cite web| url = http://www.ahistoryofgreece.com/venizelos.htm | work = A history of Greece | title = Venizelos and the Asia Minor Catastrophe |accessdate = 2008-09-03}}{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2008}}</ref> After King Alexander died without heirs, the general elections scheduled to be held on November 1, 1920, suddenly became the focus of a new conflict between the supporters of Venizelos and the Royalists. The anti-Venizelist faction campaigned on the basis of accusations of internal mismanagement and authoritarian attitudes of the government, which, due to the war, had stayed in power without elections since 1915. At the same time they promoted the idea of disengagement in Asia Minor, without though presenting a clear plan as to how this would happen. On the contrary, Venizelos was identified with the continuation of a war that did not seem to go anywhere. The majority of the Greek people were both war-weary and tired of the almost dictatorial regime of the Venizelists, so opted for change. To the surprise of many, Venizelos won only 118 out of the total 369 seats. The crushing defeat obliged Venizelos and a number of his closest supporters to leave the country. To this day his rationale to call elections at that time is questioned.\n\nThe new government under Dimitrios Gounaris prepared for a plebiscite on the return of [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine]]. Noting the King's hostile stance during World War I, the Allies warned the Greek government that if he should be returned to the throne they would cut off all financial and military aid to Greece .{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nA month later a plebiscite called for the return of King Constantine. Soon after his return, the King replaced many of the World War I Venizelist officers and appointed inexperienced monarchist officers to senior positions. The leadership of the campaign was given to [[Anastasios Papoulas]], while King Constantine himself assumed nominally the overall command. The High Commissioner in Smyrna, [[Aristeidis Stergiadis]], however was not removed. In addition, many of the remaining Venizelist officers resigned, appalled by the regime change.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nA group of officers, headed by [[Georgios Kondylis]], formed in Constantinople a \"National Defence\" organization, which reinforced with Venizelist deserters, soon started to criticize the royalist government of Athens.\n\nThe Greek Army which had secured Smyrna and the Asia Minor coast was purged of most of Venizelos's supporters, while it marched on Ankara. However, tension inside the Army between the two factions remained.\n\n===Battles of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc (December 1920&nbsp;\u2013 March 1921)===\n{{Main|First Battle of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc|Second Battle of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc}}\n[[File:Fronts during the Turkish War of Independence.jpg|260px|left|thumb|Map showing the advance of the Greek army on the western front]]\nBy December 1920, the Greeks had advanced on two fronts, approaching Eski\u015fehir from the North West and from Smyrna, and had consolidated their occupation zone. In early 1921 they resumed their advance with small scale reconnaissance incursions that met stiff resistance from entrenched Turkish Nationalists, who were increasingly better prepared and equipped as a regular army.\n\nThe Greek advance was halted for the first time at the [[First Battle of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] on January 11, 1921. Even though this was a minor confrontation involving only one Greek division, it held political significance for the fledgling Turkish revolutionaries. This development led to Allied proposals to amend the Treaty of S\u00e8vres at a [[Conference of London|conference in London]] where both the Turkish Revolutionary and Ottoman governments were represented.\n\nAlthough some agreements were reached with Italy, France and Britain, the decisions were not agreed to by the Greek government, who believed that they still retained the strategic advantage and could yet negotiate from a stronger position. The Greeks initiated another attack on March 27, the [[Second Battle of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]], where the Turkish troops fiercely resisted and finally defeated the Greeks on March 30. The British favoured a Greek territorial expansion but refused to offer any military assistance in order to avoid provoking the French.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The Turkish forces received arms assistance from [[Soviet Russia]].<ref>Stone, David R., \"Soviet Arms Exports in the 1920s,\" 'Journal of Contemporary History,' 2013, Vol.48(1), pp.57-77</ref>\n\n===Shift of support towards Turkish Revolutionaries===\n{{Main|Conference of London (1920)}}\n{{See also|Treaty of Alexandropol|Treaty of Ankara (1921)|Treaty of Moscow (1921)}}\nBy this time all other fronts had been settled in favour of the Turks,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} freeing more resources for the main threat of the Greek Army.

The plan of the Greeks was to cut Anatolia in two, as the above towns were on the main rail-lines connecting the hinterland with the coast. Eventually, after breaking the stiff Turkish defences, they occupied these strategically important centres. Instead of pursuing and decisively crippling the nationalists' military capacity, the Greek Army halted. In consequence, and despite their defeat, the Turks managed to avoid encirclement and made a strategic retreat on the east of the [[Sakarya River]], where they organised their last line of defence.\n\nThis was the major decision that sealed the fate of the Greek campaign in Anatolia. The state and Army leadership, including King Constantine, Prime Minister Dimitrios Gounaris, and General [[Anastasios Papoulas]], met at K\u00fctahya where they debated the future of the campaign. The Greeks, with their faltering morale rejuvenated, failed to appraise the strategic situation that favoured the defending side; instead, pressed for a 'final solution', the leadership was polarised into the risky decision to pursue the Turks and attack their last line of defence close to Ankara. The military leadership was cautious and requested for more reinforcements and time to prepare, but did not go against the politicians. Only a few voices supported a defensive stance, including [[Ioannis Metaxas]]. Constantine by this time had little actual power and did not argue either way. After a delay of almost a month that gave time to the Turks to organise their defence, seven of the Greek divisions crossed east of the Sakarya River.\n\n===Battle of Sakarya (August and September 1921)===\n{{Main|Battle of Sakarya}}\n[[File:Battle of Sangarios 1921.png|thumb|240px|Greek lithograph depicting the Battle of Sakarya]]\nFollowing the retreat of the Turkish troops under Ismet In\u00f6n\u00fc in the battle of K\u00fctahya-Eski\u015fehir the Greek Army advanced afresh to the Sakarya River (Sangarios in Greek), less than {{convert|100|km|mi}} west of [[Ankara]].

The Turkish defense positions were centred on series of heights, and the Greeks had to storm and occupy them. The Turks held certain hilltops and lost others, while some were lost and recaptured several times over. Yet the Turks had to conserve men, for the Greeks held the numerical advantage.{{Sfn | Kinross | 1960|p=277}} The crucial moment came when the Greek army tried to take [[Haymana, Ankara|Haymana]], {{convert|40|km|mi}} south of Ankara, but the Turks held out. Greek advances into Anatolia had lengthened their lines of supply and communication and they were running out of ammunition. The ferocity of the battle exhausted both sides but the Greeks were the first to withdraw to their previous lines. The thunder of cannon was plainly heard in Ankara throughout the battle.\n\nThat was the furthest in Anatolia the Greeks would advance, and within a few weeks they withdrew in an orderly manner back to the lines that they had held in June. The Turkish Parliament awarded both Mustafa Kemal and [[Fevzi \u00c7akmak]] with the title of [[Field Marshal]] for their service in this battle.

In accordance with this decision, under successive treaties, the Italian and French troops evacuated their positions, leaving the Greeks exposed.\n\nIn March 1922, the Allies proposed an armistice. Feeling that he now held the strategic advantage, Mustafa Kemal declined any settlement while the Greeks remained in Anatolia and intensified his efforts to re-organise the Turkish military for the final offensive against the Greeks. At the same time, the Greeks strengthened their defensive positions, but were increasingly demoralised by the inactivity of remaining on the defensive and the prolongation of the war. The Greek government was desperate to get some military support by the British or at least secure a loan, so it developed an ill-thought plan to force the British diplomatically, by threatening their positions in Constantinople, but this never materialised. The occupation of Constantinople would have been an easy task at this time because the Allied troops garrisoned there were much fewer than the Greek forces in Thrace (two divisions). The end result though was instead to weaken the Greek defences in Smyrna by withdrawing troops. The Turkish forces, on the other hand, were recipients of significant assistance from Soviet Russia. On 29 April, the Soviet authorities supplied the Turkish consul critical quantities of arms and ammunition, sufficient for three Turkish divisions. On 3 May, the Soviet government handed over 33,500,000 gold rubles to Turkey\u2014the balance of the credit of 10,000,000 gold rubles.<ref name=\"Kapur\">Kapur, H. ''Soviet Russia and Asia, 1917\u20131927, p. 114''.</ref>\n\nVoices in Greece increasingly called for withdrawal, and demoralizing propaganda spread among the troops. Some of the removed Venizelist officers organised a movement of \"National Defense\" and planned a coup to secede from Athens, but never gained Venizelos's endorsement and all their actions remained fruitless.\n\nHistorian [[Malcolm Yapp]] wrote that:<ref name=\"M.E.

The British cabinet was divided on the matter but eventually any possible armed conflict was prevented. British General [[Charles Harington Harington|Charles Harington]], allied commander in Constantinople, kept his men from firing on Turks and warned the British cabinet against any rash adventure. The Greek fleet left Constantinople upon his request. The British finally decided to force the Greeks to withdraw behind the [[Maritsa]] in Thrace.

The agreement came into force starting October 15, 1922, one day after the Greek side agreed to sign it.\n\nThe Armistice of Mudanya was followed by the Treaty of Lausanne. Separate from this treaty, Turkey and Greece came to an [[Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations|agreement]] covering [[Exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey|an exchange of populations]]. Over one million [[Greek Orthodox]] Christians were displaced; most of them were resettled in [[Attica]] and the newly incorporated Greek territories of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Western Thrace|Thrace]] and were exchanged with about 500,000 Muslims displaced from Greek territories.\n\n===Factors contributing to the outcome===\nThe Greeks estimated, despite warnings from the French and British not to underestimate the enemy, that they would need only three months to defeat the already weakened Turks on their own.{{Sfn | Friedman | 2012 | pp = 238, 248}} Exhausted from four years of bloodshed, no Allied power had the will to engage in a new war and relied on Greece.

The armed conflict started when the Greek forces landed in [[Smyrna]] (now [[Izmir]]), on 15 May 1919. They advanced inland and took control of the western and northwestern part of Anatolia, including the cities of [[Manisa]], [[Bal\u0131kesir]], [[Ayd\u0131n]], [[K\u00fctahya]], [[Bursa]] and [[Eski\u015fehir]]. Their advance was checked by Turkish forces at the [[Battle of Sakarya]] in 1921. The Greek front collapsed with the [[Great Offensive|Turkish counter-attack]] in August 1922, and the war effectively ended with the [[Turkish capture of Smyrna|recapture of Smyrna]] by Turkish forces and the [[great fire of Smyrna]].\n\nAs a result, the Greek government accepted the demands of the Turkish National Movement and returned to its pre-war borders, thus leaving [[East Thrace]] and Western Anatolia to Turkey. The Allies abandoned the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] to negotiate a new treaty at Lausanne with the Turkish National Movement. The [[Treaty of Lausanne]] recognized the independence of the Republic of Turkey and its sovereignty over Asia Minor, [[Istanbul]], and Eastern [[Thrace]]. The Greek and Turkish governments agreed to engage in [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|a population exchange]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Geopolitical context===\n{{Main|Partition of the Ottoman Empire}}\n{{Further|Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne}}\n[[File:ParisPeace-Venizelos-Map.png|thumb|left|158px|Map of [[Megali idea|Megali Idea]]]]\nThe geopolitical context of this conflict is linked to the partitioning of the [[Ottoman Empire]] which was a direct consequence of [[World War I]] and involvement of the Ottomans in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle Eastern theatre]]. The Greeks received an order to land in [[Izmir|Smyrna]] by the [[Triple Entente]] as part of the partition. During this war, the Ottoman government collapsed completely and the Ottoman Empire was divided amongst the victorious Entente powers with the signing of the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] on August 10, 1920.\n\nThere were a number of secret agreements regarding the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I. The Triple Entente had made contradictory promises about post-war arrangements concerning Greek hopes in [[Asia Minor]].<ref name = \"Steven W.

Before the occupation the Italian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, angry about the possibility of the Greek occupation of Western Anatolia, left the conference and did not return to Paris until May 5. The absence of the Italian delegation from the Conference ended up facilitating Lloyd George's efforts to persuade France and the United States to support Greece and prevent Italian operations in Western Anatolia.\n\nAccording to some historians, it was the Greek occupation of Smyrna that created the Turkish National movement. [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] argues: \"The war between Turkey and Greece which burst out at this time was a defensive war for safeguarding of the Turkish homelands in Anatolia. It was a result of the Allied policy of imperialism operating in a foreign state, the military resources and powers of which were seriously under-estimated; it was provoked by the unwarranted invasion of a Greek army of occupation.\"<ref name=\"Arnold J 1926, p. 94\">{{Citation | first1 = Arnold J | last1 = Toynbee | author1-link = Arnold J.

Greeks had lived in Asia Minor since antiquity, and before the outbreak of World War I, up to 2.5 million Greeks lived in the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"Turkey Page 79\">Roberts, Thomas Duval. ''Area Handbook for the Republic of Turkey''. p. 79</ref> The suggestion that the Greeks constituted the majority of the population in the lands claimed by Greece has been contested by a number of historians. Cedric James Lowe and Michael L. Dockrill also argued that Greek claims about Smyrna were at best debatable, since Greeks constituted perhaps a bare majority, more likely a large minority in the [[Smyrna Vilayet]], \"which lay in an overwhelmingly Turkish Anatolia.\"{{Sfn | Lowe | Dockrill | 2002 | p = 367}} Precise demographics are further obscured by the Ottoman policy of dividing the population according to religion rather than descent, language, or self-identification. On the other hand, contemporaneous British and American statistics (1919) support the point that the Greek element was the most numerous in the region of Smyrna, counting 375,000, while Muslims were 325,000.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Zamir|first= Meir| title= Population Statistics of the Ottoman Empire in 1914 and 1919 | journal = Middle Eastern Studies|year=1981|volume=7|issue=1|pages= 85\u2013106|jstor= 4282818| doi=10.1080/00263208108700459}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Montgomery |first= AE |title= The Making of the Treaty of S\u00e8vres of 10 August 1920|journal = The Historical Journal | year=1972|volume=15|issue= 4|page=775|doi= 10.1017/S0018246X0000354X}}</ref>\n\nGreek Prime Minister Venizelos stated to a British newspaper that \"Greece is not making war against Islam, but against the anachronistic Ottoman Government, and its corrupt, ignominious, and bloody administration, with a view to expelling it from those territories where the majority of the population consists of Greeks.\"<ref>{{Citation | title = Not War Against Islam \u2013 Statement by Greek Prime Minister | newspaper = [[The Scotsman]] | date = June 29, 1920 | page = 5}}.</ref>\n\nTo an extent, the above danger may have been overstated by Venizelos as a negotiating card on the table of S\u00e8vres, in order to gain the support of the Allied governments. For example, the [[Young Turks]] were not in power at the time of the war, which makes such a justification less straightforward. Most of the leaders of that regime had fled the country at the end of World War I and the Ottoman government in [[Constantinople]] was already under British control. Furthermore, Venizelos had already revealed his desires for annexation of territories from the Ottoman Empire in the early stages of World War I, before these massacres had taken place. In a letter sent to Greek [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine]] in January 1915, he wrote that: \"I have the impression that the concessions to Greece in Asia Minor&nbsp;... would be so extensive that another equally large and not less rich Greece will be added to the doubled Greece which emerged from the victorious Balkan wars.\"{{Sfn | Smith | 1999 | p = 35}}\n\nThrough its failure, the Greek invasion may have instead exacerbated the atrocities that it was supposed to prevent. Arnold J. Toynbee blamed the policies pursued by Great Britain and Greece, and the decisions of the Paris Peace conference as factors leading to the atrocities committed by both sides during and after the war: \"The Greeks of 'Pontus' and the Turks of the Greek occupied territories, were in some degree victims of Mr. Venizelos's and Mr. Lloyd George's original miscalculations at Paris.\"{{Sfn | Toynbee | 1922 | pp = 312\u201313}}\n\n===Greek irredentism===\n{{Main|Megali Idea}}\n[[File:Hellenism in the Near East 1918.jpg|thumb|right|195px|The Greek Kingdom and the Greek diaspora in the Balkans and western Asia Minor, according to a 1919 Greek map submitted to the Paris Peace Conference]]\nOne of the main motivations for initiating the war was to realize the Megali (Great) Idea, a core concept of Greek nationalism. The Megali Idea was an [[irredentist]] vision of a restoration of a Greater Greece on both sides of the Aegean that would incorporate territories with Greek populations outside the borders of the [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Kingdom of Greece]], which was initially very small \u2014 roughly half the size of the present-day [[Republic of Greece]]. From the time of Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1830, the Megali Idea had played a major role in Greek politics. Greek politicians, since the independence of the Greek state, had made several speeches on the issue of the \"historic inevitability of the expansion of the Greek Kingdom.\"{{Sfn | Smith | 1999 | p = 3}} For instance, Greek politician Ioannis Kolettis voiced this conviction in the assembly in 1844: \"There are two great centres of Hellenism. Athens is the capital of the Kingdom. Constantinople is the great capital, the City, the dream and hope of all Greeks.\"{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe Great Idea was not merely the product of 19th century nationalism. It was, in one of its aspects, deeply rooted in many Greeks' religious consciousnesses. This aspect was the recovery of Constantinople for Christendom and the reestablishment of the Christian [[Byzantine Empire]] which had fallen in 1453. \"Ever since this time the recovery of [[Hagia Sophia|St. Sophia]] and the City had been handed down from generation to generation as the destiny and aspiration of the Greek Orthodox.\"{{Sfn | Smith | 1999 | p = 3}} The Megali Idea, besides Constantinople, included most traditional lands of the Greeks including [[Crete]], [[Thessaly]], [[Epirus]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Thrace]], the [[Aegean Islands]], [[Cyprus]], the coastlands of [[Asia Minor]] and [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] on the [[Black Sea]]. Asia Minor was an essential part of the Greek world and an area of enduring Greek cultural dominance. In antiquity, from late [[Bronze Age]] up to the [[Roman empire|Roman conquest]], Greek city-states had even exercised political control of most of the region, except the period ca. 550\u2013470 BC when it was part of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaimenid Persian Empire]]. Later, during Middle Ages, the region had belonged to the Byzantine Empire until the 12th century, when the first [[Seljuk Turk]] raids reached it.\n\n===The National Schism in Greece===\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n{{See also|National Schism}}\nThe National Schism in Greece was the deep split of Greek politics and society between two factions, the one led by Eleftherios Venizelos and the other by King Constantine, that predated World War I but escalated significantly over the decision on which side Greece should support during the war.\n\nThe United Kingdom had hoped that strategic considerations might persuade Constantine to join the cause of the Allies, but the King and his supporters insisted on strict neutrality, especially whilst the outcome of the conflict was hard to predict. In addition, family ties and emotional attachments made it difficult for Constantine to decide which side to support during World War I. The King's dilemma was further increased when the [[Ottomans]] and the [[Bulgarians]], both having grievances and aspirations against the Greek Kingdom, joined the [[Central Powers]].\n\nThough Constantine did remain decidedly neutral, [[List of Prime Ministers of Greece|Prime Minister of Greece]] Eleftherios Venizelos had from an early point decided that Greece's interests would be best served by joining the Entente and started diplomatic efforts with the Allies to prepare the ground for concessions following an eventual victory. The disagreement and the subsequent dismissal of Venizelos by the King resulted in a deep personal rift between the two, which spilled over into their followers and the wider Greek society. Greece became divided into two radically opposed political camps, as Venizelos set up a separate state in Northern Greece, and eventually, with Allied support, forced the King to abdicate. In May 1917, after the exile of Constantine, Veniz\u00e9los returned to [[Athens]] and allied with the Entente. Greek military forces (though divided between supporters of the monarchy and supporters of \"[[Venizelism]]\") began to take part in military operations against the [[Military of Bulgaria|Bulgarian Army]] on the border.\n\nThe act of entering the war and the preceding events resulted in a deep political and social division in post\u2013World War I Greece. The country's foremost political formations, the Venizelist Liberals and the Royalists, already involved in a long and bitter rivalry over pre-war politics, reached a state of outright hatred towards each other. Both parties viewed the other's actions during the First World War as politically illegitimate and treasonous. This enmity inevitably spread throughout Greek society, creating a deep rift that contributed decisively to the failed [[Asia Minor]] campaign and resulted in much social unrest in the inter war years.\n\n==Greek expansion==\n[[File:Greco Turkish War 1919-1922.svg|right|thumb|240px|Map of the military developments until August 1922]]\nThe military aspect of the war began with the [[Armistice of Mudros]]. The military operations of the Greco-Turkish war can be roughly divided into three main phases: the first phase, spanning the period from May 1919 to October 1920, encompassed the Greek Landings in Asia Minor and their consolidation along the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] Coast. The second phase lasted from October 1920 to August 1921, and was characterised by Greek offensive operations. The third and final phase lasted until August 1922, when the strategic initiative was held by the Turkish Army.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Landing at Smyrna (May 1919)===\n{{Main|Greek landing at Smyrna}}\n[[File:Greek occupation troops landing on Smyrna.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Arrival of Crown Prince [[George II of Greece|George]] in Smyrna, 1919]]\n[[File:Izmir15Mayis1919.jpg|right|thumb|240px|[[Kingdom of Greece|Greek]] soldiers taking their posts in Smyrna ({{lang-tr|Izmir}}) amidst the jubilant ethnic Greek population of the city, 15 May 1919]]\nOn May 15, 1919, twenty thousand{{Sfn |Kinross|1960|p= 154}} Greek soldiers landed in Smyrna and took control of the city and its surroundings under cover of the Greek, French, and British navies.

The overall strategic objective of these operations, which were met by increasingly stiff Turkish resistance, was to provide strategic depth to the defence of Izmir (Smyrna). To that end, the Greek zone of occupation was extended over all of Western and most of North-Western Anatolia.\n\n===Treaty of S\u00e8vres (August 1920)===\n{{Main|Treaty of S\u00e8vres}}\n[[File:Treaty of S\u00e8vres 1920.svg|left|270px|thumb|Partition of the [[Ottoman Empire]] according to the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]]]]\nIn return for the contribution of the Greek army on the side of the Allies, the Allies supported the assignment of eastern Thrace and the millet of Smyrna to Greece. This treaty ended the First World War in Asia Minor and, at the same time, sealed the fate of the Ottoman Empire. Henceforth, the Ottoman Empire would no longer be a European power.\n\nOn August 10, 1920, the Ottoman Empire signed the Treaty of S\u00e8vres ceding to Greece Thrace, up to the [[\u00c7atalca#Modern period|Chatalja lines]]. More importantly, Turkey renounced to Greece all rights over Imbros and Tenedos, retaining the small territories of Constantinople, the islands of Marmara, and \"a tiny strip of European territory\". The Straits of Bosporus were placed under an International Commission, as they were now open to all.\n\nTurkey was furthermore forced to transfer to Greece \"the exercise of her rights of sovereignty\" over Smyrna in addition to \"a considerable Hinterland, merely retaining a 'flag over an outer fort'.\" Though Greece administered the Smyrna enclave, its sovereignty remained, nominally, with the Sultan. According to the provisions of the Treaty, Smyrna was to maintain a local parliament and, if within five years time she asked to be incorporated within the Kingdom of Greece, the provision was made that the League of Nations would hold a plebiscite to decide on such matters.\n\nThe treaty was never ratified by the Ottoman Empire<ref name=\"Sunga\">{{cite book| last = Sunga| first = Lyal S.| title = Individual Responsibility in International Law for Serious Human Rights Violations| date = 1992-01-01| publisher = Martinus Nijhoff| isbn = 978-0-7923-1453-0 }}</ref><ref name=\"Bernhardsson\">{{cite book|last = Bernhardsson |first=Magnus |title=Reclaiming a Plundered Past: Archaeology and Nation Building in Modern Iraq | date =2005-12-20 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=978-0-292-70947-8}}</ref> nor Greece.<ref name=\"www2.mfa.gr\">{{Citation|place=[[Kingdom of Greece|GR]] |url=http://www2.mfa.gr/NR/rdonlyres/3E053BC1-EB11-404A-BA3E-A4B861C647EC/0/1923_lausanne_treaty.doc |title=Treaty of Lausanne |date=24 July 1923 |publisher=MFA |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629163221/http://www2.mfa.gr/NR/rdonlyres/3E053BC1-EB11-404A-BA3E-A4B861C647EC/0/1923_lausanne_treaty.doc |archivedate=29 June 2007 }}.</ref>{{Better source|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Greek advance (October 1920)===\nIn October 1920, the Greek army advanced further east into Anatolia, with the encouragement of Lloyd George, who intended to increase pressure on the Turkish and Ottoman governments to sign the Treaty of S\u00e8vres. This advance began under the Liberal government of Eleftherios Venizelos, but soon after the offensive began, Venizelos fell from power and was replaced by [[Dimitrios Gounaris]]. The strategic objective of these operations was to defeat the Turkish Nationalists and force [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]] into peace negotiations. The advancing Greeks, still holding superiority in numbers and modern equipment at this point, had hoped for an early battle in which they were confident of breaking up ill-equipped Turkish forces. Yet they met with little resistance, as the Turks managed to retreat in an orderly fashion and avoid encirclement. Churchill said: \"The Greek columns trailed along the country roads passing safely through many ugly [[Defile (geography)|defiles]], and at their approach the Turks, under strong and sagacious leadership, vanished into the recesses of Anatolia.\"{{Sfn | Kinross|1960| p = 233}}\n\n===Change in Greek government (November 1920)===\n[[File:Papoulas Anastasios.JPG|thumb|240px|right|[[Anastasios Papoulas]], commander-in-chief of the Greek [[Army of Asia Minor]]]]\nDuring October 1920, [[Alexander of Greece|King Alexander]], who had been installed on the Greek throne on 11 June 1917 when his father Constantine was pushed into exile by the Venizelists, was bitten by a monkey kept at the Royal Gardens and died within days from [[sepsis]].<ref name= \"ahistoryofgreece.com\">{{cite web| url = http://www.ahistoryofgreece.com/venizelos.htm | work = A history of Greece | title = Venizelos and the Asia Minor Catastrophe |accessdate = 2008-09-03}}{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2008}}</ref> After King Alexander died without heirs, the general elections scheduled to be held on November 1, 1920, suddenly became the focus of a new conflict between the supporters of Venizelos and the Royalists. The anti-Venizelist faction campaigned on the basis of accusations of internal mismanagement and authoritarian attitudes of the government, which, due to the war, had stayed in power without elections since 1915. At the same time they promoted the idea of disengagement in Asia Minor, without though presenting a clear plan as to how this would happen. On the contrary, Venizelos was identified with the continuation of a war that did not seem to go anywhere. The majority of the Greek people were both war-weary and tired of the almost dictatorial regime of the Venizelists, so opted for change. To the surprise of many, Venizelos won only 118 out of the total 369 seats. The crushing defeat obliged Venizelos and a number of his closest supporters to leave the country. To this day his rationale to call elections at that time is questioned.\n\nThe new government under Dimitrios Gounaris prepared for a plebiscite on the return of [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine]]. Noting the King's hostile stance during World War I, the Allies warned the Greek government that if he should be returned to the throne they would cut off all financial and military aid to Greece .{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nA month later a plebiscite called for the return of King Constantine. Soon after his return, the King replaced many of the World War I Venizelist officers and appointed inexperienced monarchist officers to senior positions. The leadership of the campaign was given to [[Anastasios Papoulas]], while King Constantine himself assumed nominally the overall command. The High Commissioner in Smyrna, [[Aristeidis Stergiadis]], however was not removed. In addition, many of the remaining Venizelist officers resigned, appalled by the regime change.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nA group of officers, headed by [[Georgios Kondylis]], formed in Constantinople a \"National Defence\" organization, which reinforced with Venizelist deserters, soon started to criticize the royalist government of Athens.\n\nThe Greek Army which had secured Smyrna and the Asia Minor coast was purged of most of Venizelos's supporters, while it marched on Ankara. However, tension inside the Army between the two factions remained.\n\n===Battles of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc (December 1920&nbsp;\u2013 March 1921)===\n{{Main|First Battle of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc|Second Battle of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc}}\n[[File:Fronts during the Turkish War of Independence.jpg|260px|left|thumb|Map showing the advance of the Greek army on the western front]]\nBy December 1920, the Greeks had advanced on two fronts, approaching Eski\u015fehir from the North West and from Smyrna, and had consolidated their occupation zone. In early 1921 they resumed their advance with small scale reconnaissance incursions that met stiff resistance from entrenched Turkish Nationalists, who were increasingly better prepared and equipped as a regular army.\n\nThe Greek advance was halted for the first time at the [[First Battle of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] on January 11, 1921. Even though this was a minor confrontation involving only one Greek division, it held political significance for the fledgling Turkish revolutionaries. This development led to Allied proposals to amend the Treaty of S\u00e8vres at a [[Conference of London|conference in London]] where both the Turkish Revolutionary and Ottoman governments were represented.\n\nAlthough some agreements were reached with Italy, France and Britain, the decisions were not agreed to by the Greek government, who believed that they still retained the strategic advantage and could yet negotiate from a stronger position. The Greeks initiated another attack on March 27, the [[Second Battle of \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]], where the Turkish troops fiercely resisted and finally defeated the Greeks on March 30. The British favoured a Greek territorial expansion but refused to offer any military assistance in order to avoid provoking the French.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The Turkish forces received arms assistance from [[Soviet Russia]].<ref>Stone, David R., \"Soviet Arms Exports in the 1920s,\" 'Journal of Contemporary History,' 2013, Vol.48(1), pp.57-77</ref>\n\n===Shift of support towards Turkish Revolutionaries===\n{{Main|Conference of London (1920)}}\n{{See also|Treaty of Alexandropol|Treaty of Ankara (1921)|Treaty of Moscow (1921)}}\nBy this time all other fronts had been settled in favour of the Turks,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} freeing more resources for the main threat of the Greek Army.

The plan of the Greeks was to cut Anatolia in two, as the above towns were on the main rail-lines connecting the hinterland with the coast. Eventually, after breaking the stiff Turkish defences, they occupied these strategically important centres. Instead of pursuing and decisively crippling the nationalists' military capacity, the Greek Army halted. In consequence, and despite their defeat, the Turks managed to avoid encirclement and made a strategic retreat on the east of the [[Sakarya River]], where they organised their last line of defence.\n\nThis was the major decision that sealed the fate of the Greek campaign in Anatolia. The state and Army leadership, including King Constantine, Prime Minister Dimitrios Gounaris, and General [[Anastasios Papoulas]], met at K\u00fctahya where they debated the future of the campaign. The Greeks, with their faltering morale rejuvenated, failed to appraise the strategic situation that favoured the defending side; instead, pressed for a 'final solution', the leadership was polarised into the risky decision to pursue the Turks and attack their last line of defence close to Ankara. The military leadership was cautious and requested for more reinforcements and time to prepare, but did not go against the politicians. Only a few voices supported a defensive stance, including [[Ioannis Metaxas]]. Constantine by this time had little actual power and did not argue either way. After a delay of almost a month that gave time to the Turks to organise their defence, seven of the Greek divisions crossed east of the Sakarya River.\n\n===Battle of Sakarya (August and September 1921)===\n{{Main|Battle of Sakarya}}\n[[File:Battle of Sangarios 1921.png|thumb|240px|Greek lithograph depicting the Battle of Sakarya]]\nFollowing the retreat of the Turkish troops under Ismet In\u00f6n\u00fc in the battle of K\u00fctahya-Eski\u015fehir the Greek Army advanced afresh to the Sakarya River (Sangarios in Greek), less than {{convert|100|km|mi}} west of [[Ankara]]. Constantine's battle cry was \"to Angira\" and the British officers were invited, in anticipation, to a victory dinner in the city of Kemal.{{Sfn |Kinross|1960|p=275}} It was envisaged that the Turkish Revolutionaries, who had consistently avoided encirclement would be drawn into battle in defence of their capital and destroyed in a battle of attrition.\n\nDespite the Soviet help, supplies were short as the Turkish army prepared to meet the Greeks. Owners of private rifles, guns and ammunition had to surrender them to the army and every household was required to provide a pair of underclothing and sandals.{{Sfn |Shaw|Shaw|1977|p=360}} Meanwhile, the Turkish parliament, not happy with the performance of Ismet In\u00f6n\u00fc as the Commander of the Western Front, wanted Mustafa Kemal and Chief of General Staff [[Fevzi \u00c7akmak]] to take control.\n\n[[File:Turkish prisoners at work in a POW camp Aug 1921.jpg|thumb|left|Turkish prisoners at work in a POW camp, August 1921]]\n\nGreek forces marched {{convert|200|km|mi}} for a week through the desert to reach attack positions, so the Turks could see them coming. Food supplies were 40 tons of bread and salt, sugar and tea, the rest to be found on the way.<ref>Greek Army General Staff, The Minor Asia Campagne, volume 5th, The Angora Campagne, Athens, 1986</ref>\n\nThe advance of the Greek Army faced fierce resistance which culminated in the 21-day [[Battle of Sakarya]] (August 23 \u2013 September 13, 1921). The Turkish defense positions were centred on series of heights, and the Greeks had to storm and occupy them. The Turks held certain hilltops and lost others, while some were lost and recaptured several times over. Yet the Turks had to conserve men, for the Greeks held the numerical advantage.{{Sfn | Kinross | 1960|p=277}} The crucial moment came when the Greek army tried to take [[Haymana, Ankara|Haymana]], {{convert|40|km|mi}} south of Ankara, but the Turks held out. Greek advances into Anatolia had lengthened their lines of supply and communication and they were running out of ammunition. The ferocity of the battle exhausted both sides but the Greeks were the first to withdraw to their previous lines. The thunder of cannon was plainly heard in Ankara throughout the battle.\n\nThat was the furthest in Anatolia the Greeks would advance, and within a few weeks they withdrew in an orderly manner back to the lines that they had held in June. The Turkish Parliament awarded both Mustafa Kemal and [[Fevzi \u00c7akmak]] with the title of [[Field Marshal]] for their service in this battle. To this day no other person has received this five-star general title from the [[Turkish Republic]].\n\n===Stalemate (September 1921&nbsp;\u2013 August 1922)===\n{{Main|Conference of London#Second stage}}\n[[File:Western Front 31 March 1922.jpg|thumb|right|265px|Mustafa Kemal's visit to [[\u00c7ay]].

In accordance with this decision, under successive treaties, the Italian and French troops evacuated their positions, leaving the Greeks exposed.\n\nIn March 1922, the Allies proposed an armistice. Feeling that he now held the strategic advantage, Mustafa Kemal declined any settlement while the Greeks remained in Anatolia and intensified his efforts to re-organise the Turkish military for the final offensive against the Greeks. At the same time, the Greeks strengthened their defensive positions, but were increasingly demoralised by the inactivity of remaining on the defensive and the prolongation of the war. The Greek government was desperate to get some military support by the British or at least secure a loan, so it developed an ill-thought plan to force the British diplomatically, by threatening their positions in Constantinople, but this never materialised. The occupation of Constantinople would have been an easy task at this time because the Allied troops garrisoned there were much fewer than the Greek forces in Thrace (two divisions). The end result though was instead to weaken the Greek defences in Smyrna by withdrawing troops. The Turkish forces, on the other hand, were recipients of significant assistance from Soviet Russia. On 29 April, the Soviet authorities supplied the Turkish consul critical quantities of arms and ammunition, sufficient for three Turkish divisions. On 3 May, the Soviet government handed over 33,500,000 gold rubles to Turkey\u2014the balance of the credit of 10,000,000 gold rubles.<ref name=\"Kapur\">Kapur, H. ''Soviet Russia and Asia, 1917\u20131927, p. 114''.</ref>\n\nVoices in Greece increasingly called for withdrawal, and demoralizing propaganda spread among the troops. Some of the removed Venizelist officers organised a movement of \"National Defense\" and planned a coup to secede from Athens, but never gained Venizelos's endorsement and all their actions remained fruitless.\n\nHistorian [[Malcolm Yapp]] wrote that:<ref name=\"M.E.

Established by the [[European Commission]] in 2007, the ERC is composed of an independent Scientific Council, its governing body consisting of distinguished researchers, and an Executive Agency, in charge of the implementation. It forms part of the framework programme of the union dedicated to research and innovation, [[Horizon 2020]], preceded by the [[Seventh Research Framework Programme]] (FP7). The ERC budget is over \u20ac13 billion from 2014 \u2013 2020 and comes from the [[Horizon 2020]] programme, a part of the European Union's budget. Under Horizon 2020 it is estimated that around 7,000 ERC grantees will be funded and 42,000 team members supported, including 11,000 doctoral students and almost 16,000 post-doctoral researchers.\n\nResearchers from any field can compete for the grants that support pioneering projects.  The ERC competitions are open to top researchers also from outside the union. The average success rate is about 12%.<ref>{{Citation| title=basic statistics for ERC funding activities| url=http://erc.europa.eu/statistics-0}}</ref> Five ERC grantees have won Nobel Prizes.<ref>http://era.gv.at/object/news/1469</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencebusiness.net/news/67734/ERC-starting-grant-holder-wins-Nobel-physics-prize|title=ERC starting grant holder wins Nobel physics prize - Science-Business|website=www.sciencebusiness.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idconsortium.es/en/news/erc-grant-holder-awarded-nobel-prize-physics |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304130551/http://www.idconsortium.es/en/news/erc-grant-holder-awarded-nobel-prize-physics |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Grant applications are assessed by qualified experts. Excellence is the sole criterion for selection; there are neither thematic priorities, nor geographical quotas for funding. The aim is to recognise the best ideas, and confer status and visibility to the best research in Europe, while also attracting talent from abroad.\n\nAlong with national funding bodies, the ERC aims to improve the climate for European frontier research. The Scientific Council has been keen to learn from the ERC\u2019s peers in national research councils (European and overseas) and to engage in dialogue and appropriate collaboration. Also, some countries \u2013 such as Poland \u2013 have used the ERC model to establish national basic research funding bodies.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n== Background==\nThe idea of having a pan-European funding mechanism for basic research has been discussed and supported for a long time. However, its realisation was held back at the political level because the founding treaties of the European Union was interpreted as allowing union funding only to strengthen the scientific and technological base of European industry \u2013 that is, only funding for applied research rather than basic research. In conjunction with the Lisbon declaration in 2000, leaders of the EU, in particular the European Commissioner for Research at the time, [[Philippe Busquin]], realised that the European Treaty had to be reinterpreted; a transformation of European economy from traditional manufacturing to a knowledge-based economy has to involve the enhanced support at the European level for science of all kinds, including both fundamental and applied research.\n\nIn 2003, a report from the ERC Expert Group (ERCEG), chaired by Professor Federico Mayor, described how the ERC could take shape. In 2004, a high-level expert group was commissioned to further explore the possibilities of creating a European Research Council. This group concluded that the EU should establish an institution to support frontier research. A number of other expert groups, such as one commissioned by the European Science Foundation, another charged with the task of analysing the economic implications of the Lisbon declaration and a high level group commissioned by the European Commission, also arrived at a similar conclusion and boosted the idea. With the ice broken, scientists and politicians have since strongly supported the establishment of an ERC. In 2006, the European Parliament and EU Council of Ministers accepted the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for the European Union's support for research, of which the ERC was a flagship component. In the ERC kick-off conference in Berlin, various speakers talked of 'an idea whose time has come', 'a European factory of ideas', 'a champions' league\u2019, 'a great day for Europe and a great day for science', and the beginning of a 'snowball effect'.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Winnacker E.-L. | year = 2008 | title = On Excellence through Competition | url = | journal = European Educational Research Journal | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 124 | doi=10.2304/eerj.2008.7.2.124}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Heldin C.-H. | year = 2008 | title = The European Research Council \u2013 a new opportunity for European science | url = | journal = Nat.

The ScC acts on behalf of the scientific community in Europe to promote creativity and innovative research. It is responsible for setting the ERC's scientific strategy, including establishing the annual Work Programmes, designing the peer review systems, identifying the peer review experts, and communicating with the scientific community. The first Scientific Council members were nominated by Commissioner [[Janez Poto\u010dnik|Poto\u010dnik]] in July 2005 and worked intensively to define the key principles and scientific operating practices of the ERC in preparation for the start-up.\n\nThe members of the Scientific Council are selected by an Identification Committee, consisting of highly respected personalities in European research, and appointed by the European Commission. The ScC members term of office lasts four years.\n\n====President====\nFollowing its formal establishment, the Scientific Council reaffirmed the election of its Chair and ERC president, Professor [[Fotis Kafatos]], and the two Vice-Chairs and ERC Vice-Presidents, Professor [[Helga Nowotny]] and Dr. [[Daniel Est\u00e8ve]]. After the highly successful Presidency of Fotis Kafatos, Helga Nowotny took over as President in March 2010 with Prof. [[Carl-Henrik Heldin]] and Prof. [[Pavel Exner]] as Vice-Presidents. In January 2014, after the end of Helga Nowotny's term of office, Professor [[Jean-Pierre Bourguignon]] became ERC President. Since then, the ERC also has a third Vice-President, Professor Nuria Sebastian Galles, alongside the two vice-presidents already in office (each of them in charge of one of the ERC scientific domains). In May 2019, internationally-recognized nanomedicine scientist Dr. Mauro Ferrari was named the next president of the European Research Council.\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of presidents\n!

The implementing pillar of the ERC, the ERC Executive Agency (ERCEA), is responsible for supporting the peer review process, implementing the ERC strategy as set by the ScC, executing all financial operations and communicating about the ERC. The ERCEA is currently headed by the Director, Pablo Amor. It employs some 400 staff of which more than 50 hold PhDs.\n\nThe fact that most Scientific staff hold a PhD, have done post-docs and/or have been academics reinforces the feeling among panellists and the Scientific Community as a whole that ERC Schemes are implemented by scientists understanding the pitfalls and hurdles of Research and who are constantly working to better their procedures in order to simplify the application as well as the granting processes, hand in hand with their colleagues from financial units.\n\n====Steering Committee====\nThere is also a five-member [http://erc.europa.eu/organisation/steering-committee ERCEA Steering Committee], chaired by the European Commission's Director-General for Research and Innovation, two ScC members, and two Commission officials.\n\n===Measures to ensure an integrated institution===\nTo create an integrated institution consisting of the ScC and the ERCEA, two integrative mechanisms were initially put in place:<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Antonoyiannakis M. |author2=Hemmelskamp J. |author3=Kafatos F. C. | year = 2009 | title = The European Research Council Takes Flight | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 136 | issue = | pages = 805\u2013809 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.02.031 | pmid=19269357}}</ref>\n\n# The Secretary General (SG), selected by the ScC, was located in Brussels with the goal of interacting closely with the ERCEA.  This post no longer exists. The first SG was Professor [[Ernst-Ludwig Winnacker]] (2007 \u2013 2009). The second SG was Professor [[Andreu Mas-Colell]] (2009 \u2013 2010). The third and the last SG was Professor [[Donald B. Dingwell|Donald Bruce Dingwell]] (2010 \u2013 2013). The Secretaries General have been instrumental in the successful setting-up of the ERC, and have worked closely and fruitfully together with the two consecutive Directors ad interim of the ERCEA, Jack Metthey and thereafter Pablo Amor. During the first half of 2011, a Task Force chaired by the European Commission's Research Director-General, Robert-Jan Smits, decided to give further suggestions regarding the governance structure of the ERC in the European Commission's Framework Programme (Horizon 2020), 2014 - 2020. It ''inter alia'' suggested to merge the positions of the President and of the Secretary General into a full-time President based in Brussels. This recommendation was implemented as of January 2014; since then, the ERC President is permanently based in Brussels and there is no Secretary General.\n# The '''ERC Board''' currently consists of the ERC President, the three Vice-Presidents, and the Director of the ERCEA.\n\n=== Budget and peer review ===\nUnder the EU's Framework Programme for Research and Innovation Horizon 2020 the ERC has a budget of \u20ac13.1 billion for the period 2014 - 2020. That is a substantial increase from its initial seven-year budget under the EU's seventh Research Framework Programme (2007-2013), when the total allocated to the ERC was \u20ac7.5 billion. The ERC budget is supported by the European Commission and is supplemented by contributions from the EU associated countries. Together, the 27 EU member states and the associated countries comprise the European Research Area (ERA).\n\nThe ERC's peer-review evaluation process must command the confidence of the research community and is central to the achievement of the ERC's objectives. The ERC Scientific Council divided the full range of scientific disciplines into three major domains, with budgets allotted as follows. The peer review in the three domains is carried out by a total of 25 panels led by Panel Chairs whose scientific status gives credibility to the selection process. The peer review experts come from all over the world, which makes the ERC peer review process one of the most international of its kind on this scale. There are currently about 900 ERC panel members; together with the 2000 external reviewers, they constitute the backbone of the ERC evaluation structure.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Domain\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Allotment of budget<ref>Decided by the Scientific Council</ref>\n! colspan=\"3\" | Panel\n|-\n!

All ERC competitions for funding are open to top researchers from any country in the world, as long as they are committed to work at least half of their time in Europe. The quality and originality of the research project and the qualifications of the applicant( as shown, for example, by their publication record) are the only evaluation criteria. This means that there will be no ''juste retour'', in other words there are no guarantees that the individual countries contributing to the programme will receive any part of the funding.\n#'''Frontier research'''<ref>{{Citation| author=H. Nowotny| title=Frontier Research in the Social Sciences and Humanities: what does it mean, what can it mean? (PDF)| url=http://www.helga-nowotny.eu/documents/frontier_research.pdf}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> should be targeted by encouraging high-risk, high-reward proposals that may revolutionise science and potentially lead to innovation if successful. With its bottom-up approach, the Scientific Council does not pre-determine thematic priorities, but challenges applicants to identify them themselves. Funding is provided for individual projects initiated in an investigator-driven, \u2018bottom\u2011up\u2019 process. Although collaborations within a project are welcome, there is no formal demand to collaborate.\n\nThe ERC asks researchers to think big, and provides generous support for ambitious projects. It does not want its carefully selected grantees to waste their time by taking on numerous peripheral projects, or constantly having to seek additional money to fund their research. The grants are flexible, so that all costs for a specific project can be covered, and portable, meaning that if grant holders move to another university or institute, the grant moves with them.\n\nThe applicant can be of any nationality and age, and needs to demonstrate an excellent track record and present a ground-breaking research proposal.

Established by the [[European Commission]] in 2007, the ERC is composed of an independent Scientific Council, its governing body consisting of distinguished researchers, and an Executive Agency, in charge of the implementation. It forms part of the framework programme of the union dedicated to research and innovation, [[Horizon 2020]], preceded by the [[Seventh Research Framework Programme]] (FP7). The ERC budget is over \u20ac13 billion from 2014 \u2013 2020 and comes from the [[Horizon 2020]] programme, a part of the European Union's budget. Under Horizon 2020 it is estimated that around 7,000 ERC grantees will be funded and 42,000 team members supported, including 11,000 doctoral students and almost 16,000 post-doctoral researchers.\n\nResearchers from any field can compete for the grants that support pioneering projects.  The ERC competitions are open to top researchers also from outside the union. The average success rate is about 12%.<ref>{{Citation| title=basic statistics for ERC funding activities| url=http://erc.europa.eu/statistics-0}}</ref> Five ERC grantees have won Nobel Prizes.<ref>http://era.gv.at/object/news/1469</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencebusiness.net/news/67734/ERC-starting-grant-holder-wins-Nobel-physics-prize|title=ERC starting grant holder wins Nobel physics prize - Science-Business|website=www.sciencebusiness.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idconsortium.es/en/news/erc-grant-holder-awarded-nobel-prize-physics |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304130551/http://www.idconsortium.es/en/news/erc-grant-holder-awarded-nobel-prize-physics |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Grant applications are assessed by qualified experts. Excellence is the sole criterion for selection; there are neither thematic priorities, nor geographical quotas for funding. The aim is to recognise the best ideas, and confer status and visibility to the best research in Europe, while also attracting talent from abroad.\n\nAlong with national funding bodies, the ERC aims to improve the climate for European frontier research. The Scientific Council has been keen to learn from the ERC\u2019s peers in national research councils (European and overseas) and to engage in dialogue and appropriate collaboration. Also, some countries \u2013 such as Poland \u2013 have used the ERC model to establish national basic research funding bodies.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n== Background==\nThe idea of having a pan-European funding mechanism for basic research has been discussed and supported for a long time. However, its realisation was held back at the political level because the founding treaties of the European Union was interpreted as allowing union funding only to strengthen the scientific and technological base of European industry \u2013 that is, only funding for applied research rather than basic research. In conjunction with the Lisbon declaration in 2000, leaders of the EU, in particular the European Commissioner for Research at the time, [[Philippe Busquin]], realised that the European Treaty had to be reinterpreted; a transformation of European economy from traditional manufacturing to a knowledge-based economy has to involve the enhanced support at the European level for science of all kinds, including both fundamental and applied research.\n\nIn 2003, a report from the ERC Expert Group (ERCEG), chaired by Professor Federico Mayor, described how the ERC could take shape. In 2004, a high-level expert group was commissioned to further explore the possibilities of creating a European Research Council. This group concluded that the EU should establish an institution to support frontier research. A number of other expert groups, such as one commissioned by the European Science Foundation, another charged with the task of analysing the economic implications of the Lisbon declaration and a high level group commissioned by the European Commission, also arrived at a similar conclusion and boosted the idea. With the ice broken, scientists and politicians have since strongly supported the establishment of an ERC. In 2006, the European Parliament and EU Council of Ministers accepted the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) for the European Union's support for research, of which the ERC was a flagship component. In the ERC kick-off conference in Berlin, various speakers talked of 'an idea whose time has come', 'a European factory of ideas', 'a champions' league\u2019, 'a great day for Europe and a great day for science', and the beginning of a 'snowball effect'.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Winnacker E.-L. | year = 2008 | title = On Excellence through Competition | url = | journal = European Educational Research Journal | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 124 | doi=10.2304/eerj.2008.7.2.124}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Heldin C.-H. | year = 2008 | title = The European Research Council \u2013 a new opportunity for European science | url = | journal = Nat.

The ScC acts on behalf of the scientific community in Europe to promote creativity and innovative research. It is responsible for setting the ERC's scientific strategy, including establishing the annual Work Programmes, designing the peer review systems, identifying the peer review experts, and communicating with the scientific community. The first Scientific Council members were nominated by Commissioner [[Janez Poto\u010dnik|Poto\u010dnik]] in July 2005 and worked intensively to define the key principles and scientific operating practices of the ERC in preparation for the start-up.\n\nThe members of the Scientific Council are selected by an Identification Committee, consisting of highly respected personalities in European research, and appointed by the European Commission. The ScC members term of office lasts four years.\n\n====President====\nFollowing its formal establishment, the Scientific Council reaffirmed the election of its Chair and ERC president, Professor [[Fotis Kafatos]], and the two Vice-Chairs and ERC Vice-Presidents, Professor [[Helga Nowotny]] and Dr. [[Daniel Est\u00e8ve]]. After the highly successful Presidency of Fotis Kafatos, Helga Nowotny took over as President in March 2010 with Prof. [[Carl-Henrik Heldin]] and Prof. [[Pavel Exner]] as Vice-Presidents. In January 2014, after the end of Helga Nowotny's term of office, Professor [[Jean-Pierre Bourguignon]] became ERC President. Since then, the ERC also has a third Vice-President, Professor Nuria Sebastian Galles, alongside the two vice-presidents already in office (each of them in charge of one of the ERC scientific domains). In May 2019, internationally-recognized nanomedicine scientist Dr. Mauro Ferrari was named the next president of the European Research Council.\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of presidents\n!

The implementing pillar of the ERC, the ERC Executive Agency (ERCEA), is responsible for supporting the peer review process, implementing the ERC strategy as set by the ScC, executing all financial operations and communicating about the ERC. The ERCEA is currently headed by the Director, Pablo Amor. It employs some 400 staff of which more than 50 hold PhDs.\n\nThe fact that most Scientific staff hold a PhD, have done post-docs and/or have been academics reinforces the feeling among panellists and the Scientific Community as a whole that ERC Schemes are implemented by scientists understanding the pitfalls and hurdles of Research and who are constantly working to better their procedures in order to simplify the application as well as the granting processes, hand in hand with their colleagues from financial units.\n\n====Steering Committee====\nThere is also a five-member [http://erc.europa.eu/organisation/steering-committee ERCEA Steering Committee], chaired by the European Commission's Director-General for Research and Innovation, two ScC members, and two Commission officials.\n\n===Measures to ensure an integrated institution===\nTo create an integrated institution consisting of the ScC and the ERCEA, two integrative mechanisms were initially put in place:<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Antonoyiannakis M. |author2=Hemmelskamp J. |author3=Kafatos F. C. | year = 2009 | title = The European Research Council Takes Flight | url = | journal = Cell | volume = 136 | issue = | pages = 805\u2013809 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.02.031 | pmid=19269357}}</ref>\n\n# The Secretary General (SG), selected by the ScC, was located in Brussels with the goal of interacting closely with the ERCEA.  This post no longer exists. The first SG was Professor [[Ernst-Ludwig Winnacker]] (2007 \u2013 2009). The second SG was Professor [[Andreu Mas-Colell]] (2009 \u2013 2010). The third and the last SG was Professor [[Donald B. Dingwell|Donald Bruce Dingwell]] (2010 \u2013 2013). The Secretaries General have been instrumental in the successful setting-up of the ERC, and have worked closely and fruitfully together with the two consecutive Directors ad interim of the ERCEA, Jack Metthey and thereafter Pablo Amor. During the first half of 2011, a Task Force chaired by the European Commission's Research Director-General, Robert-Jan Smits, decided to give further suggestions regarding the governance structure of the ERC in the European Commission's Framework Programme (Horizon 2020), 2014 - 2020. It ''inter alia'' suggested to merge the positions of the President and of the Secretary General into a full-time President based in Brussels. This recommendation was implemented as of January 2014; since then, the ERC President is permanently based in Brussels and there is no Secretary General.\n# The '''ERC Board''' currently consists of the ERC President, the three Vice-Presidents, and the Director of the ERCEA.\n\n=== Budget and peer review ===\nUnder the EU's Framework Programme for Research and Innovation Horizon 2020 the ERC has a budget of \u20ac13.1 billion for the period 2014 - 2020. That is a substantial increase from its initial seven-year budget under the EU's seventh Research Framework Programme (2007-2013), when the total allocated to the ERC was \u20ac7.5 billion. The ERC budget is supported by the European Commission and is supplemented by contributions from the EU associated countries. Together, the 27 EU member states and the associated countries comprise the European Research Area (ERA).\n\nThe ERC's peer-review evaluation process must command the confidence of the research community and is central to the achievement of the ERC's objectives. The ERC Scientific Council divided the full range of scientific disciplines into three major domains, with budgets allotted as follows. The peer review in the three domains is carried out by a total of 25 panels led by Panel Chairs whose scientific status gives credibility to the selection process. The peer review experts come from all over the world, which makes the ERC peer review process one of the most international of its kind on this scale. There are currently about 900 ERC panel members; together with the 2000 external reviewers, they constitute the backbone of the ERC evaluation structure.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Domain\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Allotment of budget<ref>Decided by the Scientific Council</ref>\n! colspan=\"3\" | Panel\n|-\n!

All ERC competitions for funding are open to top researchers from any country in the world, as long as they are committed to work at least half of their time in Europe. The quality and originality of the research project and the qualifications of the applicant( as shown, for example, by their publication record) are the only evaluation criteria. This means that there will be no ''juste retour'', in other words there are no guarantees that the individual countries contributing to the programme will receive any part of the funding.\n#'''Frontier research'''<ref>{{Citation| author=H. Nowotny| title=Frontier Research in the Social Sciences and Humanities: what does it mean, what can it mean? (PDF)| url=http://www.helga-nowotny.eu/documents/frontier_research.pdf}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> should be targeted by encouraging high-risk, high-reward proposals that may revolutionise science and potentially lead to innovation if successful. With its bottom-up approach, the Scientific Council does not pre-determine thematic priorities, but challenges applicants to identify them themselves. Funding is provided for individual projects initiated in an investigator-driven, \u2018bottom\u2011up\u2019 process. Although collaborations within a project are welcome, there is no formal demand to collaborate.\n\nThe ERC asks researchers to think big, and provides generous support for ambitious projects. It does not want its carefully selected grantees to waste their time by taking on numerous peripheral projects, or constantly having to seek additional money to fund their research. The grants are flexible, so that all costs for a specific project can be covered, and portable, meaning that if grant holders move to another university or institute, the grant moves with them.\n\nThe applicant can be of any nationality and age, and needs to demonstrate an excellent track record and present a ground-breaking research proposal. The research must be conducted in a Host Institution located within the [[European Union]] or an associated country.\n\n===Schemes===\nThe council offers the following grant schemes, with funding for up to five years:<ref>{{cite web | title = ERC Starting Grants | url = https://erc.europa.eu/funding/starting-grants}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = ERC Consolidator Grants | url = https://erc.europa.eu/funding/consolidator-grants}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = ERC Advanced Grants | url = https://erc.europa.eu/funding/advanced-grants}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The other major highways in Connecticut are the [[Merritt Parkway]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], which together form [[Connecticut Route 15|Route&nbsp;15]], traveling from the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] in [[New York State]] parallel to I-95 before turning north of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and traveling parallel to I-91, finally becoming a surface road in [[Berlin, Connecticut|Berlin]]. Route&nbsp;15 and I-95 were originally [[toll road]]s; they relied on a system of [[toll plaza]]s at which all traffic stopped and paid fixed tolls. A series of terrible crashes at these plazas eventually contributed to the decision to remove the tolls in 1988.<ref>[http://www.nycroads.com/roads/ct-turnpike/ Connecticut Turnpike (I-95)] nycroads.com</ref> Other major arteries in the state include [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|U.S. Route 7]] (US&nbsp;7) in the west traveling parallel to the NY state line, [[Connecticut Route 8|Route&nbsp;8]] farther east near the industrial city of [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] and traveling south to north along the [[Naugatuck River Valley]] nearly parallel with US&nbsp;7, and [[Connecticut Route 9|Route&nbsp;9]] in the east.\n\nBetween New Haven and New York City, I-95 is one of the most congested highways in the United States. Many people now drive longer distances to work in the New York City area. This strains the three lanes of traffic capacity, resulting in lengthy [[rush hour]] delays. Frequently, the congestion spills over to clog the parallel Merritt Parkway. The state has encouraged traffic reduction schemes, including rail use and [[ride-sharing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctrides.com/ |title=ctrides.com |publisher=ctrides.com |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2010-07-25}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut also has a very active bicycling community, with one of the highest rates of bicycling ownership and use in the United States. New Haven's cycling community, organized in a local advocacy group called [[ElmCityCycling]], is particularly active. According to the U.S. Census 2006 American Community Survey, New Haven has the highest percentage of commuters who bicycle to work of any major metropolitan center on the East Coast.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Bridges and tunnels===\nThe [[Heroes Tunnel]] on the [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]] is the only tunnel in Connecticut to pass under a natural obstacle, though there are other vehicular tunnels in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and New Haven. Connecticut has many bridges, especially along the coast of [[Long Island Sound]].\n\n===Rules of the road===\nSpecific rules of the road in Connecticut, especially those that may differ from [[Traffic code in the Unites States|those of the United States in general]], include:\n\n;Passengers\n*Drivers aged 16 to 17 years are not allowed to have any other passengers besides a driving instructor, parents or legal guardians, or a licensed driver 20 years or older during the first 6 months of having a license.<ref name=CTmanual>{{cite web|url=https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/DMV/20/29/r12eng122019.pdf?la=en|title=Driver\u2019s Manual|publisher=State of Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles}} Revised December 2019</ref><ref name=Yourmechanic2016>{{cite web|url=https://www.yourmechanic.com/article/rules-of-the-road-for-connecticut-drivers-by-valerie-mellema|title=Rules of the Road For Connecticut Drivers|author=Valerie Johnston|date=2016-05-04}}</ref>\n*After 6 months of holding a driver\u2019s license, drivers aged 16 to 17 years are only permitted to have immediate family members as passengers.<ref name=CTmanual/><ref name=Yourmechanic2016/>\n\n;Seat belts\n*The driver and front seat passengers are required to wear seat belts.<ref name=CTmanual/><ref name=Yourmechanic2016/>\n*Drivers who are 16 or 17 years old and each of their passengers are required to wear seat belts.<ref name=CTmanual/><ref name=Yourmechanic2016/>\n*People aged 15 years or younger, or who weigh less than 60 pounds, must be in a safety seat designed for their height and weight.<ref name=CTmanual/>\n\n;Cell phones\n*It is illegal to use a handheld cell phone or other mobile electronic device while driving or when temporarily stopped.<ref name=CTmanual/> Hands-free devices are permitted.<ref name=Yourmechanic2016/>\n*Drivers aged 16 or 17 years are not permitted to use a cell phone or other electronic device, including hands-free options, while driving unless there is an emergency situation requiring fire or police.<ref name=Yourmechanic2016/>\n\n;Right-of-way\n*Generally, pedestrians have the right-of-way in crosswalks.

The state also operates [[CTfastrak]], a [[bus rapid transit]] line linking [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]] and Hartford.<ref name=march28>{{cite press release |url=http://ctfastrak.com/about/news/news-releases/13-media-releases/279-03-28-15-despite-snow-thousands-of-riders-many-first-timers-experience-ctfastrak-on-first-day-of-service |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911222239/http://ctfastrak.com/about/news/news-releases/13-media-releases/279-03-28-15-despite-snow-thousands-of-riders-many-first-timers-experience-ctfastrak-on-first-day-of-service |archivedate=11 September 2015 |title=Despite Snow, Thousands of Riders, Many First-Timers, Experience CTfastrak on First Day of Service |publisher=Connecticut Department of Transportation |date=28 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=CTfastrak>{{cite web|title=What Is CTfastrak|url=http://www.ctfastrak.com/about/what-is-ctfastrak|publisher=State of Connecticut|accessdate=18 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=LaPorte|first1=Mike|title=The Busway to the Future: Insider to CTfastrak before Opening to Public|url=http://livewiremcc.org/2014/11/05/the-busway-to-the-future-insider-to-ctfastrak-before-opening-to-public/|accessdate=11 December 2014|work=The Live Wire|agency=Manchester Community College|date=5 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Roads and freeways==\n{{main|List of state routes in Connecticut}}\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|300px|right|thumb|Map of Connecticut showing major highways.]]\nThe [[Interstate highway]]s in the state are [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|I-95]] (the majority of the [[Connecticut Turnpike]]) traveling southwest to northeast along the coast, [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]] traveling southwest to northeast in the center of the state, [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]] traveling south to north in the center of the state, and [[Interstate 395 in Connecticut|I-395]] (the rest of the Connecticut Turnpike) traveling south to north near the eastern edge of the state. The other major highways in Connecticut are the [[Merritt Parkway]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], which together form [[Connecticut Route 15|Route&nbsp;15]], traveling from the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] in [[New York State]] parallel to I-95 before turning north of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and traveling parallel to I-91, finally becoming a surface road in [[Berlin, Connecticut|Berlin]]. Route&nbsp;15 and I-95 were originally [[toll road]]s; they relied on a system of [[toll plaza]]s at which all traffic stopped and paid fixed tolls. A series of terrible crashes at these plazas eventually contributed to the decision to remove the tolls in 1988.<ref>[http://www.nycroads.com/roads/ct-turnpike/ Connecticut Turnpike (I-95)] nycroads.com</ref> Other major arteries in the state include [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|U.S. Route 7]] (US&nbsp;7) in the west traveling parallel to the NY state line, [[Connecticut Route 8|Route&nbsp;8]] farther east near the industrial city of [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] and traveling south to north along the [[Naugatuck River Valley]] nearly parallel with US&nbsp;7, and [[Connecticut Route 9|Route&nbsp;9]] in the east.\n\nBetween New Haven and New York City, I-95 is one of the most congested highways in the United States. Many people now drive longer distances to work in the New York City area. This strains the three lanes of traffic capacity, resulting in lengthy [[rush hour]] delays. Frequently, the congestion spills over to clog the parallel Merritt Parkway. The state has encouraged traffic reduction schemes, including rail use and [[ride-sharing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctrides.com/ |title=ctrides.com |publisher=ctrides.com |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2010-07-25}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut also has a very active bicycling community, with one of the highest rates of bicycling ownership and use in the United States. New Haven's cycling community, organized in a local advocacy group called [[ElmCityCycling]], is particularly active. According to the U.S. Census 2006 American Community Survey, New Haven has the highest percentage of commuters who bicycle to work of any major metropolitan center on the East Coast.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\n===Bridges and tunnels===\nThe [[Heroes Tunnel]] on the [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]] is the only tunnel in Connecticut to pass under a natural obstacle, though there are other vehicular tunnels in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and New Haven.

The [[64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot]] was created on 21 April 1758 from the 2nd Battalion of the [[Devonshire Regiment|11th Regiment of Foot]].<ref name=LG31583/> In 1881, under the [[Childers Reforms]], the 64th Regiment of Foot was merged with the [[98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot]] (originally raised in 1824) to form the '''Prince of Wales's (North Staffordshire Regiment)'''. In 1921 the regimental title was altered to the '''North Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's)'''.\n\nFormed at a time when the [[British Empire]] was reaching its peak, the regiment served all over the Empire, in times of both peace and war, and in many theatres of war outside the Empire. It fought with distinction in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], as well as in other smaller conflicts around the world. These other wars included the [[Mahdist War#Return of the British|Second Sudanese War]], the [[Second Boer War]], the [[Irish War of Independence|Anglo-Irish War]] and the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]].\n\nIn 1959, as part of a defence review, the North Staffordshire Regiment, by now reduced to only a single regular battalion, was amalgamated with the [[South Staffordshire Regiment]] to form the [[Staffordshire Regiment|Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's)]] which was, in 2006, amalgamated with the [[Cheshire Regiment]] and the [[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot)]] to form the [[Mercian Regiment]]. Today the traditions of the North Staffordshire Regiment are continued by the [[Mercian Regiment]].\n\n==Formation history==\n{{Main|64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot|98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot}}\n\nThe '''Prince of Wales's (North Staffordshire) Regiment''' was formed under the [[Childers Reforms]] on 1 July 1881, by the amalgamation of the [[64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot]] and [[98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot]].{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=62}} These two regular regiments became, respectively, the 1st and 2nd battalions of the new regiment.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=62}} The [[Militia (United Kingdom)|Militia]] and [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Rifle Volunteers]] forces of North Staffordshire were also incorporated into this new regiment, and a permanent [[Regimental depot|depot]] was established at [[Whittington Barracks]], [[Lichfield]], which also housed the newly formed [[South Staffordshire Regiment]].{{sfn|The brief history of the Staffordshire Regiment, part 1|2010|p=3}}\n\nThe 64th Regiment of Foot was originally raised in 1756 as the 2nd Battalion of the [[Devonshire Regiment|11th (Devonshire) Foot]], and was renumbered the 64th in 1758. It had a long history of overseas service with much less time spent in Europe. It had served in the [[West Indies]] during the [[Seven Years' War]], America during the [[American War of Independence]], South America, the West Indies and Canada during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Subsequent long periods were spent in Ireland and the West Indies before action was seen in India during the [[Indian Mutiny]]. At the time of the forming of the amalgamation with the 98th Foot, the 64th was based in Ireland.{{sfn|Cook|1970|pp=127\u2013128}}\n\nThe 98th Regiment of Foot, raised in 1824 in [[Chichester]], had a much shorter history, but like the 64th had spent the majority of its time overseas spending a long time in South Africa before seeing action in China in the [[First Opium War|First Anglo-Chinese (or Opium) War]] and India on the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North West Frontier]]. It was based in Afghanistan when the amalgamation occurred.{{sfn|Cook|1970|pp=127\u2013128}}\n\nThe battalions that constituted the regiment in 1881 were as follows:\n\n* 1st Battalion: the [[64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot]];\n* 2nd Battalion: the [[98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot]];\n* 3rd (Militia) Battalion: The King's Own (2nd Staffordshire) Light Infantry Militia, based in [[Stafford]];\n* 4th (Militia) Battalion: The King's Own (3rd Staffordshire) Rifles Militia, based in [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]];\n* 1st Volunteer Battalion: 2nd Staffordshire ([[Staffordshire Rangers]]) Rifle Volunteer Corps, based in [[Stoke-on-Trent]];\n* 2nd Volunteer Battalion: 5th Staffordshire Rifle Volunteer Corps, based in Lichfield but later moved to [[Burton-on-Trent]].{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=62}}\n\n==Volunteers and Territorials==\nThe 2nd and 5th Staffordshire Rifle Volunteer Corps were designated the 1st and 2nd Volunteer battalions, North Staffordshire Regiment, in 1883. Together with the Volunteer battalions of the [[South Staffordshire Regiment]], they formed the [[Staffordshire Brigade|Staffordshire Volunteer Infantry Brigade]] in 1888. This brigade was intended to assemble at [[Wolverhampton]] in time of war, while in peacetime it acted as a focus for collective training of the Volunteers. On the formation of the [[Territorial Force]] in 1908, the two Volunteer battalions were renumbered as the 5th and 6th battalions of the North Staffordshire Regiment, forming part of the Staffordshire Brigade in the [[46th (North Midland) Division|North Midland Division]].{{sfn|Westlake|2010|pages=217\u201322}}{{sfn|Becke|2007|pages=61\u201367}}\n\nThe reserve battalions of the regiment were also reorganised in 1908 by the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]], with the two [[Militia (United Kingdom)|militia]] battalions being re-designated the 3rd (Special) and 4th (Special Reserve) battalions, and the volunteer battalions being re-designated as Territorial Force and renumbered as the 5th and 6th battalions (TF): they were based at [[College Road drill hall, Hanley|College Road]] in [[Hanley, Staffordshire|Hanley]] and [[Horninglow Street drill hall, Burton upon Trent|Horninglow Street]] in [[Burton upon Trent]] respectively.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=72}}\n\n==Early service (1881\u20131914)==\n\n===Garrison duties and the Mahdist War===\n[[File:North Staffordshire Regiment Officers.jpg|thumb|300px|Officers of the 2nd Battalion, India 1908]]\nThe 1st Battalion was stationed in Ireland at the time of the amalgamation. It moved to England in 1883, and the following year to the [[West Indies]], based mainly in [[Barbados]], but with detachments on other islands. It moved to [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] in 1887, to [[Mauritius]] in 1890, to [[Malta]] in 1893 and to [[Egypt]] in 1895. From there the 1st Battalion took part in operations in the [[Mahdist War#Return of the British|Second Sudanese War]] under [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]].{{sfn|Cook|1970|pp=67\u201371}} During the campaign, the 1st Battalion were based initially at [[Wadi Halfa]] but moved to [[Gemai]] to avoid a [[cholera]] outbreak. In September the battalion took part in the action against the [[Dervish]] Army at Hafir, which was decisive in ending the campaign. As a result, the North Staffordshire Regiment received the unique \"Hafir\" [[battle honour]], given to no other British regiment.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=71}}{{sfn|Rodger|2003|p=64}}\n\n===Second Boer War===\nThe 2nd Battalion was stationed in [[British Raj|India]] in 1881 when the North Staffordshire Regiment was formed, and remained there until 1886. During this time period, it took part in an expedition to the [[Zhob]] Valley in 1884, thus making it the first battalion in the regiment to see active service.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=62}} In 1886, it returned to England via [[Aden]], and then deployed to Ireland in 1893. In 1899, 2nd Battalion mobilised and moved to [[South Africa]], where it took part in the [[Second Boer War]]. Forming part of [[15th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|15th Brigade]] in the [[7th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|7th Division]],{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=73}} the majority of the battalion saw little action throughout the conflict, being mostly occupied in garrison duties in [[Johannesburg]] in 1900.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=75}} In 1901, the battalion was part of a mobile column under [[Brigadier-General Dartnell]] in the Eastern [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] which carried out a [[scorched earth]] campaign.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=75}}\n\nMore action was seen by the [[mounted infantry]] [[Company (military unit)|company]] of the regiment that had been formed on arrival in South Africa. In January 1900 [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]], commander of the British forces in South Africa, ordered that every infantry battalion in South Africa was to raise a company of mounted infantry. These companies were to be detached from their parent units and operate as part of eight independent mounted infantry battalions.{{sfn|Badsey|2008|p=97}} The North Staffords company thus formed became part of the 8th Battalion, Mounted Infantry. This unit was involved in the pursuit of [[Koos de la Rey]] and was present when he was captured at [[Wildfontein]].{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=76}} The militia and volunteer battalions also saw service in the Second Boer War. The 4th Battalion was deployed in the Cape Colony and later the [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]] before being replaced by the 3rd Battalion.{{sfn|Cook|1970|pp=77\u201378}} Additionally, the two volunteer companies which formed from the 1st and 2nd Volunteer battalions served alongside the 2nd Battalion at various times.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=78}} As a result of these contributions and those of the two regular battalions, the regiment was awarded the \"South Africa 1900\u20131902\" battle honour.{{sfn|Rodger|2003|p=69}}\n\nAt the war's end in June 1902, the 2nd battalion returned to England on the SS ''Galeka'' in October that year,<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Army in South Africa - Troops returning home| day_of_week=Wednesday |date=24 September 1902 |page_number=7 |issue=36881}}</ref> but the home posting was brief. In the following year, it returned to India, remaining there until 1919.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=128}}\n\n===Meeting in India===\nThe 1st Battalion was stationed in India from 1897 until 1903. The battalion was divided between barracks in [[Jhansi]] and [[Nowgong, Chhatarpur|Nowgong]] until late 1902, when it was reunited at [[Bombay]].<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Naval & Military intelligence - The Army in India|day_of_week=Saturday |date=11 October 1902 |page_number=12 |issue=36896| }}</ref> The following year, the 1st and 2nd Battalions met for the first time, and no fewer than 590 men from the 1st Battalion were transferred to the 2nd Battalion.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=71}} Thus 1st Battalion was reduced to a small cadre, which served for nine years upon its return to Lichfield and other stations in England, before moving to [[Buttevant]] in Ireland in 1912.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/nstaffs.htm|title=The North Staffordshire Regiment|author=Chris Baker|publisher=|accessdate=21 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==First World War (1914\u20131918)==\nThe North Staffordshire Regiment was heavily committed to the fighting during the First World War, and over the course of the conflict, was expanded to 18 battalions, some by duplication of the Territorial Force battalions and others, labelled \"service\" battalions raised as part of [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener's]] [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]]. These battalions saw service in a number of theatres including on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle East]], and [[World War I#Southern theatres|India]].{{sfn|Chappell|2009|loc=[http://warpath.orbat.com/regts/n_staffs.htm Prince of Wales's (North Staffordshire Regiment)]}} The following list details the involvement of these battalions:\n\n* 1st Battalion \u2013 served in France from September 1914 until November 1918;\n* 2nd Battalion \u2013 served in India throughout the war;\n* 3rd (Reserve) Battalion \u2013 operated as a training battalion in the United Kingdom throughout the war;\n* 4th (Extra Reserve) Battalion \u2013 garrison battalion in Guernsey 1914\u20131916.

On joining the Territorial Force men were asked if they would serve overseas (foreign service) or just volunteered for service in the United Kingdom (home service) and their service records amended accordingly. At the declaration of war all Territorial battalions were mobilised and on 15 August 1914 the War Office issued instructions for those men who had volunteered for foreign service to be separated out into what were called first line battalions. Home service men were placed in second line battalions. Thus there would now be a first line 5th Battalion and a second line 5th Battalion. On 24 November 1914, as the first line battalions began to go overseas, additional instructions were issued allowing the raising of a third line battalion once the first line battalion was on foreign service. In January 1915 these designations were simplified and the battalions called the 1/5th, 2/5th and 3/5th battalions respectively.{{sfn|Baker|2009|loc=[http://www.1914-1918.net/tf.htm The Territorial Force 1914\u20131918]}}{{sfn|Beckett|1991|p=229}}\n\nThe battalions that served in France took part in many of the major actions of the war including the 1915 [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]], the 1915 [[Battle of Loos]], the [[Battle of the Somme]] in 1916, the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Third Battle of Ypres]] in 1917 and the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] in 1918.{{sfn|Cook|1970|loc=Chapter 10}}\n\n[[File:North Staffs 1 Bn officers 1914.jpg|thumb|300px|Officers of the 1st Battalion, photographed in Cambridge in August 1914, shortly before embarking for France on 8 September.

When AA Command was disbanded in 1955 and the number of air defence units reduced, 576 LAA/SL Regiment was amalgamated with [[Lancashire Hussars|349 (Lancashire Yeomanry) LAA]] and [[93rd Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery|493 Heavy Anti-Aircraft]] Regiments as 441 LAA/SL Regiment.{{sfn|Litchfield|1992|p=32}}\n\nThe 6th Battalion continued as a Territorial unit of the new regiment without a change of title. In 1961, it merged with the 441st Light Anti Aircraft Regiment, [[Royal Artillery]], the successor to the 5th North Staffords, to become the 5th/6th Battalion.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=124}} The combined battalion was abolished in 1967 on the creation of the [[Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve]] in 1967.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=124}}\n\nThe Staffordshire Regiment only had a separate existence from 1959\u20132007. As part of the reforms proposed in the 2003 Defence White Paper, ''[[Delivering Security in a Changing World]]'', the regiment was merged with the [[Cheshire Regiment]] and the [[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment]] to form the [[Mercian Regiment]]. The amalgamation took place on 1 September 2007 in Tamworth Castle Grounds, when the Staffordshire Regiment became the 3rd Battalion, the Mercian Regiment. Subsequently, in 2014, The Mercian Regiment reduced its number of regular battalions from three to two, with the 3rd Battalion being disbanded and the personnel being redeployed into the 1st and 2nd Battalions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-27988491 |title=Mercian Regiment: Final marches for disbanded battalion |date=24 June 2014 |accessdate=30 August 2015 |work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==Regimental museum==\nThe [[Staffordshire Regiment Museum]] is based at [[Whittington Barracks]] near [[Lichfield]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staffordshireregimentmuseum.com/ |title=No frills but plenty of guts|publisher=The Staffordshire Regiment Museum|accessdate= 22 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Battle honours==\nThe following lists all battle honours awarded to the Regiment or inherited by the regiment from the 64th Foot and 98th Foot.{{sfn|Cook|1970|loc=various}}\n\nPrior to 1914 all battle honours awarded to a unit were displayed upon the colours.{{sfn|Rodger|2003|p=9}} However the number of battle honours awarded during the First World War was such that it was ordered that no more than 24 honours were to be carried on the colours, of which no more than 10 were to be honours relating to the First World War.<ref>Army Order 338/1922 paragraph 1(d).</ref>  Similarly, following the Second World War it was ordered that up to 10 honours relating to that conflict could be displayed on the colours, in addition to honours already carried.<ref>Army Council Instruction 58/1956 paragraph 5.</ref> The choice of the honours to be displayed were at the discretion of regimental committees.

The [[64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot]] was created on 21 April 1758 from the 2nd Battalion of the [[Devonshire Regiment|11th Regiment of Foot]].<ref name=LG31583/> In 1881, under the [[Childers Reforms]], the 64th Regiment of Foot was merged with the [[98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot]] (originally raised in 1824) to form the '''Prince of Wales's (North Staffordshire Regiment)'''. In 1921 the regimental title was altered to the '''North Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's)'''.\n\nFormed at a time when the [[British Empire]] was reaching its peak, the regiment served all over the Empire, in times of both peace and war, and in many theatres of war outside the Empire. It fought with distinction in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], as well as in other smaller conflicts around the world. These other wars included the [[Mahdist War#Return of the British|Second Sudanese War]], the [[Second Boer War]], the [[Irish War of Independence|Anglo-Irish War]] and the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]].\n\nIn 1959, as part of a defence review, the North Staffordshire Regiment, by now reduced to only a single regular battalion, was amalgamated with the [[South Staffordshire Regiment]] to form the [[Staffordshire Regiment|Staffordshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's)]] which was, in 2006, amalgamated with the [[Cheshire Regiment]] and the [[Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment|Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot)]] to form the [[Mercian Regiment]]. Today the traditions of the North Staffordshire Regiment are continued by the [[Mercian Regiment]].\n\n==Formation history==\n{{Main|64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot|98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot}}\n\nThe '''Prince of Wales's (North Staffordshire) Regiment''' was formed under the [[Childers Reforms]] on 1 July 1881, by the amalgamation of the [[64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot]] and [[98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot]].{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=62}} These two regular regiments became, respectively, the 1st and 2nd battalions of the new regiment.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=62}} The [[Militia (United Kingdom)|Militia]] and [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Rifle Volunteers]] forces of North Staffordshire were also incorporated into this new regiment, and a permanent [[Regimental depot|depot]] was established at [[Whittington Barracks]], [[Lichfield]], which also housed the newly formed [[South Staffordshire Regiment]].{{sfn|The brief history of the Staffordshire Regiment, part 1|2010|p=3}}\n\nThe 64th Regiment of Foot was originally raised in 1756 as the 2nd Battalion of the [[Devonshire Regiment|11th (Devonshire) Foot]], and was renumbered the 64th in 1758. It had a long history of overseas service with much less time spent in Europe. It had served in the [[West Indies]] during the [[Seven Years' War]], America during the [[American War of Independence]], South America, the West Indies and Canada during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Subsequent long periods were spent in Ireland and the West Indies before action was seen in India during the [[Indian Mutiny]]. At the time of the forming of the amalgamation with the 98th Foot, the 64th was based in Ireland.{{sfn|Cook|1970|pp=127\u2013128}}\n\nThe 98th Regiment of Foot, raised in 1824 in [[Chichester]], had a much shorter history, but like the 64th had spent the majority of its time overseas spending a long time in South Africa before seeing action in China in the [[First Opium War|First Anglo-Chinese (or Opium) War]] and India on the [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North West Frontier]]. It was based in Afghanistan when the amalgamation occurred.{{sfn|Cook|1970|pp=127\u2013128}}\n\nThe battalions that constituted the regiment in 1881 were as follows:\n\n* 1st Battalion: the [[64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot]];\n* 2nd Battalion: the [[98th (Prince of Wales's) Regiment of Foot]];\n* 3rd (Militia) Battalion: The King's Own (2nd Staffordshire) Light Infantry Militia, based in [[Stafford]];\n* 4th (Militia) Battalion: The King's Own (3rd Staffordshire) Rifles Militia, based in [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]];\n* 1st Volunteer Battalion: 2nd Staffordshire ([[Staffordshire Rangers]]) Rifle Volunteer Corps, based in [[Stoke-on-Trent]];\n* 2nd Volunteer Battalion: 5th Staffordshire Rifle Volunteer Corps, based in Lichfield but later moved to [[Burton-on-Trent]].{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=62}}\n\n==Volunteers and Territorials==\nThe 2nd and 5th Staffordshire Rifle Volunteer Corps were designated the 1st and 2nd Volunteer battalions, North Staffordshire Regiment, in 1883. Together with the Volunteer battalions of the [[South Staffordshire Regiment]], they formed the [[Staffordshire Brigade|Staffordshire Volunteer Infantry Brigade]] in 1888. This brigade was intended to assemble at [[Wolverhampton]] in time of war, while in peacetime it acted as a focus for collective training of the Volunteers. On the formation of the [[Territorial Force]] in 1908, the two Volunteer battalions were renumbered as the 5th and 6th battalions of the North Staffordshire Regiment, forming part of the Staffordshire Brigade in the [[46th (North Midland) Division|North Midland Division]].{{sfn|Westlake|2010|pages=217\u201322}}{{sfn|Becke|2007|pages=61\u201367}}\n\nThe reserve battalions of the regiment were also reorganised in 1908 by the [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]], with the two [[Militia (United Kingdom)|militia]] battalions being re-designated the 3rd (Special) and 4th (Special Reserve) battalions, and the volunteer battalions being re-designated as Territorial Force and renumbered as the 5th and 6th battalions (TF): they were based at [[College Road drill hall, Hanley|College Road]] in [[Hanley, Staffordshire|Hanley]] and [[Horninglow Street drill hall, Burton upon Trent|Horninglow Street]] in [[Burton upon Trent]] respectively.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=72}}\n\n==Early service (1881\u20131914)==\n\n===Garrison duties and the Mahdist War===\n[[File:North Staffordshire Regiment Officers.jpg|thumb|300px|Officers of the 2nd Battalion, India 1908]]\nThe 1st Battalion was stationed in Ireland at the time of the amalgamation. It moved to England in 1883, and the following year to the [[West Indies]], based mainly in [[Barbados]], but with detachments on other islands. It moved to [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] in 1887, to [[Mauritius]] in 1890, to [[Malta]] in 1893 and to [[Egypt]] in 1895. From there the 1st Battalion took part in operations in the [[Mahdist War#Return of the British|Second Sudanese War]] under [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]].{{sfn|Cook|1970|pp=67\u201371}} During the campaign, the 1st Battalion were based initially at [[Wadi Halfa]] but moved to [[Gemai]] to avoid a [[cholera]] outbreak. In September the battalion took part in the action against the [[Dervish]] Army at Hafir, which was decisive in ending the campaign. As a result, the North Staffordshire Regiment received the unique \"Hafir\" [[battle honour]], given to no other British regiment.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=71}}{{sfn|Rodger|2003|p=64}}\n\n===Second Boer War===\nThe 2nd Battalion was stationed in [[British Raj|India]] in 1881 when the North Staffordshire Regiment was formed, and remained there until 1886. During this time period, it took part in an expedition to the [[Zhob]] Valley in 1884, thus making it the first battalion in the regiment to see active service.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=62}} In 1886, it returned to England via [[Aden]], and then deployed to Ireland in 1893. In 1899, 2nd Battalion mobilised and moved to [[South Africa]], where it took part in the [[Second Boer War]]. Forming part of [[15th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|15th Brigade]] in the [[7th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|7th Division]],{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=73}} the majority of the battalion saw little action throughout the conflict, being mostly occupied in garrison duties in [[Johannesburg]] in 1900.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=75}} In 1901, the battalion was part of a mobile column under [[Brigadier-General Dartnell]] in the Eastern [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] which carried out a [[scorched earth]] campaign.{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=75}}\n\nMore action was seen by the [[mounted infantry]] [[Company (military unit)|company]] of the regiment that had been formed on arrival in South Africa. In January 1900 [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]], commander of the British forces in South Africa, ordered that every infantry battalion in South Africa was to raise a company of mounted infantry. These companies were to be detached from their parent units and operate as part of eight independent mounted infantry battalions.{{sfn|Badsey|2008|p=97}} The North Staffords company thus formed became part of the 8th Battalion, Mounted Infantry. This unit was involved in the pursuit of [[Koos de la Rey]] and was present when he was captured at [[Wildfontein]].{{sfn|Cook|1970|p=76}} The militia and volunteer battalions also saw service in the Second Boer War.

On joining the Territorial Force men were asked if they would serve overseas (foreign service) or just volunteered for service in the United Kingdom (home service) and their service records amended accordingly. At the declaration of war all Territorial battalions were mobilised and on 15 August 1914 the War Office issued instructions for those men who had volunteered for foreign service to be separated out into what were called first line battalions. Home service men were placed in second line battalions. Thus there would now be a first line 5th Battalion and a second line 5th Battalion. On 24 November 1914, as the first line battalions began to go overseas, additional instructions were issued allowing the raising of a third line battalion once the first line battalion was on foreign service.

The amalgamation took place on 1 September 2007 in Tamworth Castle Grounds, when the Staffordshire Regiment became the 3rd Battalion, the Mercian Regiment.
