Published in 2012, the story follows dual narratives by Eleanor and Park, two misfits living in Omaha, Nebraska from 1986 to 1987. Eleanor, a chubby<ref>{{cite | url=https://lauraoosterbeek.wordpress.com/2015/07/04/the-problem-with-eleanor-park/ | title=Rainbow Rowell interview comments | accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref> 16-year-old girl with curly red hair, and Park, a half-Korean, 16-year-old boy, meet on a school bus on Eleanor's first day at the school and gradually connect through comic books and mix tapes of '80s music, sparking a love story. Park grows to love Eleanor and Eleanor learns to understand Park.\n\n==\u0422\u0440\u043e\u0445\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0443 ==\nEleanor Douglas is beginning 10th grade. She is the oldest in a family of two girls and three boys. All the children live with their mother and stepfather, Richie, in a tiny two-bedroom house. The children share one bedroom. There is one bathroom, and Richie has removed the door and will not allow a curtain for privacy. Richie is physically and emotionally abusive to the mother and often drunk. The children live in terror of him. Eleanor does not own a toothbrush or properly fitting clothes. She patches her clothes in bright colors, wears ribbons in her hair, and creates strange clothing combinations, over which her fellow students bully her. Eleanor has just returned after sleeping on the couch of a family friend since Richie threw her out a year earlier.\n\nPark Sheridan has lived in Omaha his whole life. While his family is not affluent, and his parents come from very different backgrounds, his home is filled with love. While his father is tall and \"masculine\", Park takes after his mother in appearance and is shorter than his younger brother. Park believes he is a disappointment and is unenthusiastic about taekwondo, which his father values. Park is instead interested in alternative music and comics. He feels insecure about his size and Asian heritage, despite getting along with the popular kids at school.\n\nOn Eleanor's first day at her new school, the students find her weird. They rearrange their seats on the school bus to get her yelled at by the driver. When Eleanor is about to cry, Park rudely offers her a seat. They have a few classes together during which Park notices Eleanor is one of the smartest students in class. They begin to connect.\n\nEleanor is regularly bullied at school. Girls cover her gym locker with sanitary pads, and someone writes crude remarks in her school books. At home, Richie frequently screams at Eleanor's mother while drunk. One night, Eleanor hears gunshots and calls 911, but the police believe Richie's lies over her report. Eleanor tries to conceal her living situation from Park, but gets frustrated when he takes some things for granted, like a telephone, batteries, or safety. She tries to reject Park's gifts, believing herself unworthy. The two spend more time together in secret, since Richie won't allow Eleanor to have a boyfriend, and her mother and siblings' loyalties have shifted to Richie. Park professes his love for Eleanor, making her uncomfortable. Her first meeting with his parents, especially his mother, does not go well.\n\nPark gets into a fight with Steve, who was bullying Eleanor, and lands a taekwondo kick to Steve's mouth. Park's nose is broken in return. His mother grounds him \"forever\", thinking Eleanor is leading Park into trouble. Park's father, on the other hand, is proud of Park and understands that Richie is an abusive alcoholic. After seeing Eleanor's family, Park's mother invites Eleanor to stay at their house. Eleanor accepts and lies to her family about it. Eleanor's uncle offers to take Eleanor to Minnesota for the summer so she can attend a program for gifted teens, but Richie says no.\n\nOne night, Park's mom tells the kids to go on a date. Eleanor returns home to a fight between Richie and her mother and she finds her personal possessions destroyed. She matches a hateful message written by Richie to the handwriting of the perverted notes in her school books. Eleanor flees and ends up in Steve's garage with him and Tina, who turn out to not be as bad as she had thought. She goes to Park's house and tries to formulate a way to get to her uncle in St. Paul, Minnesota. Park insists upon driving her. His father sees him sneaking out of the house, but, surprisingly, gives Park money and tells him to take the truck. Park leaves Eleanor at her uncle's house. Eleanor's aunt and uncle welcome her and plan to remove her siblings as well.\n\nPark sends Eleanor letters, but she does not respond. Park tries to forget her, but can't. Soon, Eleanor's siblings and mother disappear from Richie's house, leaving Richie alone once again. Park passes by Eleanor's former house frequently, longing for her. Park encounters Richie one day as he is coming back from one of his drinking binges. Park fantasizes about killing Richie, because he \"can\" and \"should,\" but ends up only kicking the ground in front of Richie's face, who had fallen in the snow. Six months later, Park receives a postcard from Eleanor with three words on it.\n\n==Themes==\n===Escape===\nEleanor desperately seeks for a way to get out of her everyday house and Richie, even though she knows that would mean leaving Park behind. She gets what she wants when Park offers to drive her to Minnesota, away from Richie and her house but what he gets in return is that Eleanor's mother and siblings also go to where she is, leaving Park with just memories the two have made together.\n\n===Domestic abuse===\nA key issue revolves around Eleanor and her stepfather, Richie. There are countless times when Eleanor notices bruising on her mother's face. Richie abuses Eleanor\u2019s mother both physically \u2013 though Rowell never shows us Richie hitting Eleanor\u2019s mother, Sabrina \u2013 and emotionally. Richie yells at and controls Sabrina throughout most of the novel, and Eleanor is so used to it that she can \"sleep through the screaming.\" Sabrina treads lightly around Richie, so as not to spike his anger, making sure everything is right so Richie won\u2019t hurt her or the kids. Later in the novel we can see some of Richies disgusting notes heading towards Eleanor.\n\n===Child abuse===\nRichie physically abuses the kids, hitting them when they do something wrong, as well as verbally abusing them, calling them insults. The kids go without new clothes or shoes, wearing the few items Eleanor\u2019s mother can get at Goodwill. The children don\u2019t have toothbrushes or toothpaste, nor shampoo or conditioner to wash their hair; they only have access to dish washing soap. They don\u2019t have much to eat, either. All five children sleep in a small bedroom with a bunk bed, the boys on the floor, Eleanor on the top bunk and Eleanor's younger sister on the bottom.\n\n===Bullying===\nEleanor deals with bullying at school and at home. At school, her classmate Tina and other students bully her about her size, her hair, and her clothes. Eleanor's father makes comments about her size, as well as Richie, whose comments are much more vulgar.\n\n===Body image===\nEleanor is constantly bullied about her size. She wears large clothing because her cast-off Goodwill clothing is seldom in her size. In one brief moment with her father, Eleanor says he used to drop \"hints about her weight.\" Richie hurls insults at Eleanor about her appearance. Eleanor does not hate being fat, but dislikes how much of an outcast she becomes because she looks different than anyone else. Park loves everything about Eleanor, body type included.\n\nTall height is described in a positive manner while short height is described negatively in characters' thoughts.\n\n==Reception and honors==\nThe critical reception for the book has been mostly positive.

The battalion earned three [[European\u2013African\u2013Middle Eastern Campaign Medal|campaigns]] streamers in the European Theater of Operations:  \n\n# Normandy     \n# Northern France     \n# Rhineland campaigns.      \n\nThe battalion arrived in [[Lydney]], England in late 1943 and was redesignated the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Base Depot) or \"64th QMBD,\" under the command structure of the Advanced Section ([[ADSEC]]) throughout the war in support of the [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|European Theater of Operations]] (ETO). The battalion participated in [[Operation Overlord]] in Normandy under the command of LTC Albert Barden. For the period from D+41 through D+90, ADSEC had requisitioned enough spare parts to maintain a 30-day level in each using unit and an additional 30-day supply in the army Class II depot. QM units were to carry a 90-day supply of special-purpose spare parts, which would last until the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Base Depot) could establish a central parts depot on the Continent. As the first major sustainment organization to arrive on the beachhead of Normandy, the battalion followed the axis of advance by pushing classes of supply across the [[English Channel]].  \n\nOn 13 July 1944 at [[Isigny-sur-Mer]], the battalion was specifically tasked with collecting personal effects and baggage for the safe return to the United States, management of graves registration following the [[invasion of Normandy]], and managing the captured German prisoner of war population.  \n\nOn 29 September 1944, the battalion established a base depot, Q-256, in [[Reims]], in order to conduct salvage operations for the [[Twelfth United States Army Group|12th Army Group]] with whom the battalion supported for the remainder of the war. It became the largest single salvage installation in the ETO with the purpose of undertaking fifth echelon maintenance and manufacturing projects never contemplated by the War Department. Depot Q-256 was administered by the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Base Depot) and operated by the 696th QM Salvage Repair Company (Fixed); these two units had been trained together at Lydney, and combined a total of 586 attached service troops or civilian employees, not including employed German prisoners of war, whose numbers swelled twenty times that number. Depot Q-256, with its facilities scattered throughout the city of Reims, received overflow salvage directly from the armies. In addition to routine processing and packaging, the depot conducted a program of manufacturing, remodeling, and improvisation. Scrap materials were used to reinforce paratroop trousers, fabricate BAR belts and rocket ammunition pouches, and patch tent-age. Materials ostensibly destined for scrap were converted into other types of end items: old tires were used to make soles for prisoners' shoes, badly torn shirts and raincoats were transformed into wiping rags, aprons, and typewriter covers, and old wool was converted into \"shoddy\" blankets. Besides the fixed repair activities at Reims salvage depot, twelve mobile repair teams and two technical crews worked out of this installation in answer to calls from the field. Ultimately, Q-256 also had to operate a complete machine shop where motors and other heavy equipment, including QM equipment trailers, were rebuilt, although this was originally a responsibility of Ordnance. Such activities were performed in rented French shops with captured German lathes, presses, and other heavy duty machinery. Sufficient machine tools were available to permit the occasional manufacture of badly needed spare parts such as flame cups for one-burner stoves and rotors for gasoline dispensers. By the end of March 1945 the Reims salvage depot occupied 500,000 square feet of closed space and 350,000 feet of open space; this was more than double the total space set aside for Quartermaster salvage and reclamation in all the U.K. depots as of January 1944. At the close of 1944, the depot had processed nine million items, and in March 1945 it was handling 160,000 pieces per day. Items processed in the United Kingdom shortly after D-day for shipment to the continent were in particularly chaotic condition. During the second half of November 1944, combat units of [[First United States Army|First Army]] complained that items arriving in the forward areas marked Class B clothing were not suitable for issue, and also reports from its own field liaison officers that 80 percent of the clothing located at UTAH Beach marked Class X was actually combat serviceable and included such scarce items as field jackets. COL Beny Rosaler, chief of the Field Service Division, had a solution: assign the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Base Depot), which was in [[Reims|Riems]] at that time, with the task of sorting out the confusion. COL Rosaler commented that \"it required highly qualified personnel with good judgment.\"   \n[[File:64QMBD.png|alt=|left|thumb|Sign posted outside Dolhain, Belgium next to the typewriter factor]]\nDuring the [[German occupation of Belgium during World War II|German occupation of Belgium]], following the [[Battle of Belgium]], occupying German forces turned [[Dolhain|Dolhain, Belgium]] into a wartime production factory for German-made Olympia brand typewriters for their war effort. Typewriters had become scarce as the war raged on, and the US government had started a domestic campaign to collect old typewriters for use by allied forces. The [[allied advance from Paris to the Rhine]] led to the liberation of cities in the vicinity of the city of [[Li\u00e8ge|Liege]], including Dolhain, and subsequent the German destruction of the town as they retreated across the [[Rhine]]. The 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Base Depot) reestablished a base depot in Liege and Dolhain, repaired the heavily damaged typewriter factory in order to have typewriters reproduced, this time for the allies' war effort.     \n\nOn 25 March 1944, four \"XYZ express routes\" were established; the four XYZ routes extended eastward from Li\u00e8ge, Dueren, Luxembourg, and Nancy to support the 12th Army Group in the final push of the Rhineland Campaign.    \n\nMonths before V-E Day, Office of the Theater Chief Quartermaster had started to plan the post-hostilities organization of Quartermaster activities. Cherbourg, Li\u00e8ge - including the battalion's base of operations, Reims, and Nancy-Metz were to be closed down as soon as their stocks were exhausted and Paris was to be reduced to a minor issue depot for the rear headquarters. 12th Army Group inactivated in July 1945 along with the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Base Depot) following the Rhineland Campaign and defeat of the axis powers.\n\n== Cold War & Vietnam War ==\nFrom 1950 to 1953, the battalion was briefly reactivated during heightened tensions during the [[Cold War]] but did not see combat in Korea. In 1963, the battalion was reactivated and redesignated as the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Petroleum Operations) in support of the [[Vietnam War]]. From 15 April 1966 to 28 February 1970, the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Petroleum Operations) was deployed to [[Long Binh Post|Long Binh, Vietnam]] under the 53rd General Support Group,  United States Army Support Command Saigon, 1st Logistical Command, United States Army Vietnam. The battalion provided transportation and petroleum support through ten of 17 campaigns including: \n\n# Counteroffensive 25 December 1965-30 June 1966\n# Counteroffensive, Phase II 1 July 1966-31 May 1967\n# Counteroffensive, Phase III 1 June 1967-29 January 1968\n# Tet Counteroffensive 30 January-1 April 1968\n# Counteroffensive, Phase IV 2 April-30 June 1968\n# Counteroffensive, Phase V 1 July-1 November 1968\n# Counteroffensive, Phase VI 2 November 1968-22 February 1969\n# Tet 69/Counteroffensive 23 February-8 June 1969\n# Summer-Fall 1969 9 June-31 October 1969 \n# Winter-Spring 1970 1 November 1969-30 April 1970 \n\nBecause of their resolute courage in the face of the enemy, no operation was delayed because of petroleum unavailability. Further, the Binh Loi-Tan Son Nhut pipeline operated by the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Petroleum Operations) supplied more than 190,000,000 gallons of fuel to the Ton Son Nhut areas with remarkable efficiency. III Corps Tactical Zone. During this period the battalion delivered more than 300,000,000 gallons of bulk fuel in tank vehicles and drove more than 7,000,000 miles under the most adverse and hazardous conditions in support of major tactical maneuvers. The battalion had 10 Soldiers killed in the four years it was deployed. Through their unrelenting perseverance, consummate knowledge and devotion to mission accomplishment, the members of the unit contributed immeasurably to the free world struggle against Communist aggression in the Republic of Vietnam.\n\n== Post-Vietnam Cold War ==\nOn 1 December 1975, the battalion was reactivated as the 64th Forward Support Battalion and assigned to the Division Support Command (DISCOM) of the 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) at Fort Carson, where it began its long association with the 4th Infantry Division. It deployed as a unit, with 550 personnel to [[Wiesbaden|Wiesbaden,]] [[West Germany]], as part of \"[[4th Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division (United States)|Brigade 76]]\" in April 1976. This deployment was a task force used as a rapid deployment unit with a mechanized brigade made up of units from Fort Carson all of which were on a rotational assignment basis. When expected cost savings from the use of rotation force failed to materialize, the brigade was permanently reassigned to Europe and served in Germany until its deactivation in 1984. On 15 May 1987, the battalion was reactivated under the DISCOM, 4th Infantry Division with a support relationship with 3d Brigade, 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized). It moved to [[Fort Hood]], Texas in 1995 with the rest of the 4th Infantry Division.\n\n== Global War on Terrorism ==\nSince the beginning of the [[Global War on Terrorism]], the battalion has deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom from 2003 to 2004, 2005 to 2006, 2007 to 2009, and 2010 to 2011; Operation Inherent Resolve in 2015; and Operation Spartan Shield in 2019. \nIn December 2004 in accordance with the [[Reorganization plan of United States Army#Modular combat brigades|transformation of the Army]], the battalion was redesignated the 64th Brigade Support Battalion with a direct-support relationship with the redesignated 3d Armored Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division. In 2009, the battalion returned to Fort Carson with the 4th Infantry Division.\n\n== Operation Atlantic Resolve ==\nThe 64th Brigade Support Battalion deployed to Europe in support of [[Operation Atlantic Resolve]] from 4 January to 15 November 2017 in response to renewed Russian aggression in eastern Europe. The battalion provided continuous sustainment support for the brigade across the European continent from Germany to eastern Europe. \n\n== Distinctive Unit Insignia ==\nThe distinctive unit insignia worn by the soldiers of this battalion is the primary buff and scarlet, colors symbolic of support units. Black refers to the petroleum capability of the battalion. The fleur-de-lis and the three battlements allude to the three campaigns credited to the battalion in France and Europe in World War II. The original rice motif symbolized service in Vietnam. The turned down inner blades of the wreath, crossing diagonally simulate the Roman numeral X and refer to participation in the ten campaigns in Vietnam.

The battalion earned three [[European\u2013African\u2013Middle Eastern Campaign Medal|campaigns]] streamers in the European Theater of Operations:  \n\n# Normandy     \n# Northern France     \n# Rhineland campaigns.      \n\nThe battalion arrived in [[Lydney]], England in late 1943 and was redesignated the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Base Depot) or \"64th QMBD,\" under the command structure of the Advanced Section ([[ADSEC]]) throughout the war in support of the [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|European Theater of Operations]] (ETO). The battalion participated in [[Operation Overlord]] in Normandy under the command of LTC Albert Barden. For the period from D+41 through D+90, ADSEC had requisitioned enough spare parts to maintain a 30-day level in each using unit and an additional 30-day supply in the army Class II depot. QM units were to carry a 90-day supply of special-purpose spare parts, which would last until the 64th Quartermaster Battalion (Base Depot) could establish a central parts depot on the Continent.
