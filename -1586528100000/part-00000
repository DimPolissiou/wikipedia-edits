Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own.

What followed, despite another decent Champions League performance, was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club's history, with the team as low as 15th in February 2003. This led to Van Gaal's resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by [[Radomir Anti\u0107]], though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage. At the end of the season, Anti\u0107's short-term contract was not renewed, and club president [[Joan Gaspart]] resigned, his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club's overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior.<ref>Ball, Phil. pp. 109\u2013110</ref>\n\n[[File:Ronaldinho 11feb2007.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Ronaldinho]]'s arrival in 2003 revitalized the club.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/news/2013-2014/when-barca-got-their-smile-back-documentary-about-ronaldinho |title='When Bar\u00e7a got their smile back' \u2013 documentary about Ronaldinho|publisher=FC Barcelona |date=9 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/feb/09/europeanfootball.sport |title=Ronaldinho brings smile to Barca's face |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=9 February 2004}}</ref>]]\n\nAfter the disappointment of the Gaspart era, the combination of a new young president, Joan Laporta, and a young new manager, former [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch]] and [[A.C.

After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a larger number of spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950.

The first stone of the future stadium was laid in place under the auspices of Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego. Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288&nbsp;million [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]], 336% over budget.<ref name=\"fcbarcelona6\"/>\n\n[[File:2014.

The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain's transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco's dictatorship. The new president's main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch. His presidency was to last for 22 years, and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona, as N\u00fa\u00f1ez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline, letting go of such players as [[Diego Maradona]], [[Rom\u00e1rio]] and [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] rather than meeting their demands.<ref name=\"fcbarcelona4\">{{cite web |url=http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_4.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121204143800/http://www.fcbarcelona.com/web/english/club/historia/etapes_historia/etapa_4.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 December 2012 |title=History part IV |publisher=FC Barcelona |accessdate=15 March 2010 }}</ref><ref>Ball, Phil p. 85</ref>\n\nOn 16 May 1979, the club won its first [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] by beating [[Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf]] 4\u20133 in [[Basel]] in a final watched by more than 30,000 travelling ''blaugrana'' fans.

The group, identified with a left-wing separatism, repeatedly demanded the resignation of N\u00fa\u00f1ez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches. At the same time, Barcelona experienced an eruption in [[skinheads]], who often identified with a right-wing separatism. The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois' ideology from [[liberalism]] to [[fascism]], which caused division within the group and a sudden support for N\u00fa\u00f1ez's presidency.<ref>Spaaij, Ram\u00f3n pp. 291\u2013292</ref> Inspired by British hooligans, the remaining Boixos Nois became violent, causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests.<ref>Spaaij, Ram\u00f3n p. 293</ref>\n\nAfter the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], Barcelona signed the English top scorer [[Gary Lineker]], along with goalkeeper [[Andoni Zubizarreta]], but the team could not achieve success, as Schuster was excluded from the team.

It is part of the [[comarca]] of [[La Axarqu\u00eda]]. It is on the country's southern [[Mediterranean]] coast, about 50&nbsp;km east of [[M\u00e1laga]].\n\nUnder Muslim rule, wasnt named\n ''Narixa'', which means \"abundant source\" and is the origin of the current name.\n\n==History==\nNerja has a long history, evidenced by the primitive paintings found in its famous [[Nerja caves]], discovered in 1959. These caves are now believed to be just one entrance to a linked series of sinkholes{{clarify|date=February 2017}} stretching many miles into the mountains between Nerja and Granada, and which may yet prove to be one of the most extensive unexplored systems in [[Europe]]. Visitors to the caves will be able to view the remains of one of the ancient inhabitants of Nerja.\n\nThe [[ancient Rome|Romans]] built here three settlements, including  ''Detunda'', of which now large remains can be seen. The area was later taken over by the [[Arab]]s in the early 8th century. Under the [[al-Andalus|Moors]], the town was known as  ''Narixa'', which means \"abundant spring\", from which the present name derives.\n\n[[Image:Nerja Andalousie (1).JPG|left|thumb|[[Aqueduct (bridge)|Aqueduct]] of Nerja.]]\nIts agricultural and silk products are said{{by whom|date=February 2012}} to have been famed throughout the Muslim world and in the markets of [[Damascus]] as early as the 10th century.\n\n[[File:Nerja Capistrano.jpg|right|240px|thumb|Capistrano Playa, Nerja.]]\nThe ''Balc\u00f3n de Europa'', a ''mirador'' or viewpoint which gives stunning views across the sea, is in the centre of the old town. Its name is popularly believed to have been coined by [[Alfonso XII of Spain|King Alfonso XII]], who visited the area in 1885 following a disastrous earthquake and was captivated by the scene. Local folklore says that he stood upon the site where the Balc\u00f3n now stands, and said \"This is the balcony of Europe\". Local archive documents are said to show that its name predated this visit, but this has not prevented the authorities from placing a life-sized (and much photographed) statue of the king standing by the railing.\n\nThe Balc\u00f3n area was originally known as La Bater\u00eda, a reference to the gun battery which existed there in a fortified tower. This emplacement and a similar tower nearby were destroyed during the [[Peninsular War]]. In May 1812, the British vessels [[HMS Hyacinth (1806)|''Hyacinth'']], [[HMS Termagant (1796)|''Termagant'']] and [[HMS Basilisk (1801)|''Basilisk'']] supported Spanish guerrillas on the coast of Granada, against the French. On 20 May, ''Termagant'' or ''Hyacinth'' opened fire and the forts were destroyed. Two rusty guns positioned at the end of the Balc\u00f3n are reminders of these violent times. The huge lumps of rock, the remains of La Bater\u00eda, visible in the sea at the end of the Balc\u00f3n, are further evidence of this action.\n\n[[File:NerjaPanormatotheEast.png|thumb|Panorama looking out to the East of Nerja with the mountains in the background]]\n\n==Main sights==\n* [[Caves of Nerja]]\n* [[Sierras of Tejeda, Almijara and Alhama Natural Park]]\n* [[Navachica]], highest peak in the [[Sierra de Almijara]]\n*Balc\u00f3n of Europa\n*The Aqueduct, built in the 19th century\n*Baroque Hermitage of ''las Angustias'' (17th century)\n*Church of ''El Salvador'', in Baroque and Mud\u00e9jar style (17th century)\n*Maro, a coastal village within Nerja's municipal term\n*[[Chillar River]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://biglovelyday.com/walk-rio-chillar-nerja/|title=GREAT FAMILY WALK The R\u00edo Ch\u00edllar in Nerja \u2013 Big Lovely Day|website=biglovelyday.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref>\n\n==Beaches==\n* Burriana<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nerjatoday.com/nerjabeachguide/burriana/|title=Nerja Beach Guide - Burriana Beach {{!}} Nerja Today|website=www.nerjatoday.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref>\n* Carabeillo<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nerjatoday.com/nerjabeachguide/carabeillo/|title=Nerja Beach Guide - Carabeillo beach {{!}} Nerja Today|website=www.nerjatoday.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref>\n* Carabeo<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nerjatoday.com/nerjabeachguide/carabeo/|title=Nerja Beach Guide - Carabeo beach {{!}} Nerja Today|website=www.nerjatoday.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref>\n*Chucho\n*Torrecilla\n*El Sal\u00f3n\n*Playazo\n*Calahonda\n*Caletilla\n\n== Sports ==\n* Enrique L\u00f3pez Cuenca Sports Stadium -\nCombined Football and Athletics stadium, home to the local semi-professional soccer team  ''C.D Nerja''  (Club deportivo Nerja)\n\n* Watersports\n\nSea-Kayaking and Scuba-diving are based at Burriana beach<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.explorenerja.com/things_to_do/water_sports.htm|title=Water Sports in Nerja {{!}} Explore Nerja|website=www.explorenerja.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref>\n\n== Public transport ==\n\nNerja is not integrated in the [[M\u00e1laga Metropolitan Transport Consortium]].\n\nAs well as two local bus routes, around town (from the Ri\u00fa M\u00f3nica Hotel), there are buses from the top of the High Street by the Alsa ticket office to [[M\u00e1laga]], [[Caves of Nerja]], [[Frigiliana]], [[Maro, Nerja|Maro]], [[Almu\u00f1\u00e9car]], [[V\u00e9lez-M\u00e1laga]], [[Torre del Mar]], [[Granada]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]], [[Seville]], [[Almer\u00eda]] and [[Motril]].\n\n==Twin towns==\n[[File:Balcon van Europa.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Tour into of the Balc\u00f3n de Europa.]]\n\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Pescia]], Italy\n*{{flagicon|ARG}} [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]], Argentina\n\n==Cultural references==\n\nNerja has been a source of inspiration for expatriate writers and artists, such as [[List of Scottish novelists|Scottish novelist]] [[Joan Lingard]] and French-born author [[Andr\u00e9 Launay]]; [[Jorge Guill\u00e9n]] and [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] were longtime visitors and residents of the town.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\nThe town was also the main setting for the filming of ''[[Verano azul]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Localizaciones de rodaje de la serie Verano Azul|url=http://www.veranoazul.org/?page_id=2}}</ref> a popular Spanish television series later exported to several countries, a replica of the boat the featured in the series can be found in a park of the same name (as the series), near the centre of town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nerjatoday.com/nerja/parque-verano-azul/|title=Nerja - Parque Verano Azul {{!}} Nerja Today|website=www.nerjatoday.com|access-date=2016-12-22}}</ref>\n\nIn popular fiction\nThe Enigmatic Mr Phelps<ref>{{Cite book|title=The enigmatic Mr Phelps|last=B.|first=Green, David|date=2005|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781420853698|location=Bloomington, Ind.|oclc=948804742}}</ref> (pub.1997-2003-2005), which combines the first two international crime fiction novels in a continuing series along with a screenplay Mr Phelps (2016 - co-written by Award-winning Canadian Film Director and screenwriter Jason C.

The huge lumps of rock, the remains of La Bater\u00eda, visible in the sea at the end of the Balc\u00f3n, are further evidence of this action.\n\n[[File:NerjaPanormatotheEast.png|thumb|Panorama looking out to the East of Nerja with the mountains in the background]]\n\n==Main sights==\n* [[Caves of Nerja]]\n* [[Sierras of Tejeda, Almijara and Alhama Natural Park]]\n* [[Navachica]], highest peak in the [[Sierra de Almijara]]\n*Balc\u00f3n of Europa\n*The Aqueduct, built in the 19th century\n*Baroque Hermitage of ''las Angustias'' (17th century)\n*Church of ''El Salvador'', in Baroque and Mud\u00e9jar style (17th century)\n*Maro, a coastal village within Nerja's municipal term\n*[[Chillar River]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://biglovelyday.com/walk-rio-chillar-nerja/|title=GREAT FAMILY WALK The R\u00edo Ch\u00edllar in Nerja \u2013 Big Lovely Day|website=biglovelyday.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref>\n\n==Beaches==\n* Burriana<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nerjatoday.com/nerjabeachguide/burriana/|title=Nerja Beach Guide - Burriana Beach {{!}} Nerja Today|website=www.nerjatoday.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref>\n* Carabeillo<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nerjatoday.com/nerjabeachguide/carabeillo/|title=Nerja Beach Guide - Carabeillo beach {{!}} Nerja Today|website=www.nerjatoday.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref>\n* Carabeo<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nerjatoday.com/nerjabeachguide/carabeo/|title=Nerja Beach Guide - Carabeo beach {{!}} Nerja Today|website=www.nerjatoday.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref>\n*Chucho\n*Torrecilla\n*El Sal\u00f3n\n*Playazo\n*Calahonda\n*Caletilla\n\n== Sports ==\n* Enrique L\u00f3pez Cuenca Sports Stadium -\nCombined Football and Athletics stadium, home to the local semi-professional soccer team  ''C.D Nerja''  (Club deportivo Nerja)\n\n* Watersports\n\nSea-Kayaking and Scuba-diving are based at Burriana beach<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.explorenerja.com/things_to_do/water_sports.htm|title=Water Sports in Nerja {{!}} Explore Nerja|website=www.explorenerja.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-04-08}}</ref>\n\n== Public transport ==\n\nNerja is not integrated in the [[M\u00e1laga Metropolitan Transport Consortium]].\n\nAs well as two local bus routes, around town (from the Ri\u00fa M\u00f3nica Hotel), there are buses from the top of the High Street by the Alsa ticket office to [[M\u00e1laga]], [[Caves of Nerja]], [[Frigiliana]], [[Maro, Nerja|Maro]], [[Almu\u00f1\u00e9car]], [[V\u00e9lez-M\u00e1laga]], [[Torre del Mar]], [[Granada]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]], [[Seville]], [[Almer\u00eda]] and [[Motril]].\n\n==Twin towns==\n[[File:Balcon van Europa.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Tour into of the Balc\u00f3n de Europa.]]\n\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Pescia]], Italy\n*{{flagicon|ARG}} [[San Juan, Argentina|San Juan]], Argentina\n\n==Cultural references==\n\nNerja has been a source of inspiration for expatriate writers and artists, such as [[List of Scottish novelists|Scottish novelist]] [[Joan Lingard]] and French-born author [[Andr\u00e9 Launay]]; [[Jorge Guill\u00e9n]] and [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]] were longtime visitors and residents of the town.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\nThe town was also the main setting for the filming of ''[[Verano azul]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Localizaciones de rodaje de la serie Verano Azul|url=http://www.veranoazul.org/?page_id=2}}</ref> a popular Spanish television series later exported to several countries, a replica of the boat the featured in the series can be found in a park of the same name (as the series), near the centre of town.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nerjatoday.com/nerja/parque-verano-azul/|title=Nerja - Parque Verano Azul {{!}} Nerja Today|website=www.nerjatoday.com|access-date=2016-12-22}}</ref>\n\nIn popular fiction\nThe Enigmatic Mr Phelps<ref>{{Cite book|title=The enigmatic Mr Phelps|last=B.|first=Green, David|date=2005|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781420853698|location=Bloomington, Ind.|oclc=948804742}}</ref> (pub.1997-2003-2005), which combines the first two international crime fiction novels in a continuing series along with a screenplay Mr Phelps (2016 - co-written by Award-winning Canadian Film Director and screenwriter Jason C.

Every week they start off with no food to make things fair for all the teams who must make do with whatever cash Tyler Florence provides (seed money) at the start of each episode, in each new city. The trucks all convene in [[Los Angeles]].\n\n===Truck Teams===\n{{Great Food Truck Race Labelled Map 1|float=right}}\n\n'''Grill 'Em All''' \u2013 A [[Los Angeles]] food truck with a theme inspired by Metallica's album ''Kill 'Em All''. The three heavy metal enthusiasts, Ryan, Matt and Joel cook gourmet hamburgers with names like \"the hatchet\" (with sausage gravy and maple syrup) and \"the behemoth\" (with cheese sandwiches for buns).\n\n'''Nana Queens''' \u2013 Sisters Janel and Shanel, along with their friend Rick, representing [[Compton, California]] and dishing up hot wings and banana pudding. They even have a banana costume to promote their signature dish.\n\n'''Ragin' Cajun''' \u2013 Generations of old family recipes are used to serve authentic Cajun food. The team is made up of [[Lafayette, Louisiana]] natives Stephen, Joey and Jazmin, with Stephen playing up his crazy, outlandish personality to bring in customers.\n\n'''Austin Daily Press''' \u2013 A food truck from [[Austin, Texas]] led by Cory, his business partner Amy, and his girlfriend Melani. They started their business with the idea to tap into the less serviced market for late night delivery. They serve hot, pressed sandwiches.\n\n'''Crepes Bonaparte''' \u2013 Coming from [[Fullerton, California]], this team is headed by engaged couple, Christian and Danielle as well as their best friend, Matt. This truck serves sweet and savory Parisian-style crepes.\n\n'''Nom Nom Truck''' \u2013 The second Los Angeles food truck and specializes in Vietnamese b\u00e1nh mi sandwiches. The trio consisted of UCLA business graduates Misa, Jennifer, and David. Their plan was to partner up with local businesses in every city.\n\n'''Spencer on the Go''' \u2013 A [[San Francisco]] food truck led by chefs Laurent, John, and Jesse. Their aim is to serve high-end, French cuisine, going so far as to set up a folding table so patrons can enjoy a sit-down dining experience.\n\n===Episodes===\n'''Let's Get Rolling (Week 1)'''\n\nThe established trucks began the first ever race in Los Angeles and they were given $500 to buy their ingredients before being sent to San Diego to sell their food over the weekend. This was meant to level the playing field because some of the food trucks were already from Los Angeles and had a loyal customer base. Most of the teams faced a slow first day; propane issues doubly affected Nana Queens. Both Nana Queens and Ragin' Cajun paid fees to get into a festival, with Nana Queens paying for the full two days and Ragin Cajun only finding out about the festival, and getting in, on the second day.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The \"Truck Stop\" is a challenge described by Tyler as a twist to keep things interesting that will make them \"stop what [they're] doing and take a new direction\". There were no unusual challenges or hurdles beyond moving to a new, unfamiliar location. Since they made the most profit at the end of the episode, the technical winner is: '''Nom Nom Truck'''\n\n'''Chile Santa Fe (Week 2)'''\n\nThe truck teams had to consider changing their menus when they reached Santa Fe during a light snowfall. They were given $300 seed money. Spencer on the Go suffered from engine trouble that delayed them in buying their ingredients and making sales in the first day. Grill Em All opted to pair up with Austin Daily Press, thinking two trucks would be more eye-catching than one.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: On the beginning of the second day, Tyler called all the trucks for their first official truck stop challenge. The teams had to make and sell a new dish with chili peppers. A Santa Fe chef, Eric Distefano, went around undercover to taste all the chili pepper specials and pick the best one. The Nom Nom Truck opted not to do the challenge. Winner received immunity from elimination. Winner was '''Spencer on the Go'''.\n\n'''Truckin' To Texas (Week 3)'''\n\nThe trucks faced a drastic temperature change, where last week there was snow, this week they faced the Texas sun. They received $400 in seed money. Despite having the most expensive menu, Spencer on the Go has been calling up local French restaurants in every city to get wholesale prices. Nom Nom Truck's strategy of partnering up with local business was also helping them out. The Austin Daily Press set up on a little league baseball field and donated 15% of their profits (>$200) to the little league.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: A quarter cow was delivered to all the teams who had to butcher it and make a new dish with it. A Fort Worth chef, Tim Love, went undercover to sample each food-truck beef special, and select the best one. Winner received a Texan Rodeo Buckle, which represented $1,000 that was added towards their final tally. Winner was '''Grill 'Em All'''.\n\n'''Big Trouble In The Big Easy (Week 4)'''\n\nAll the teams planned to streamline and adapt their menus to suit the local tastes. They received $400 seed money and an extra 24 hours to do late night sales at New Orleans, one of the biggest cities for night life and partying. Once again, Austin Daily Press and Grill Em All teamed up. Spencer on the Go waited so long for a restaurant owner, to get wholesale groceries, that they didn't get a chance to make sales on the first day. A torrential storm on the second day slowed down sales for many of the trucks, and generator troubles affected Austin Daily Press. Partway into Day 2's late-night sales, they were told by Tyler to close up because their Truck Stop challenge would be in the early morning.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: At the docks, each team was given 30 minutes to fillet a catfish and create a dish from it. A local chef, Jacques Leonardi, tasted and selected the best dish that would win $500 toward their final tally. For the first time, the losing chefs got a punishment; they had to work together to fillet 700 lbs of catfish before they were allowed to start selling again. Winner was '''Spencer on the Go'''.\n\n'''Small Town Trouble (Week 5)'''\n\nWith a population of only 5,000, this was the smallest town in this season's race, and all three trucks had to sell in one downtown spot. They were given $400 seed money and an extra 24 hours to sell but unlike the night crowds of other large cities, the townspeople of Jonesborough didn't stay out after 8pm.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: At a rustic farm, the teams had two hours to create a \"five-course\" meal (bread, beans, potatoes, meat, and dessert) using frontier-era cooking utensils and supplies. Two experienced chuckwagoners tasted and judged who created the best overall meal. The winner received a spot at a nearby auto show and access to thousands of potential customers. Winner was '''Grill 'Em All'''.\n\n'''New York Plate of Mind (Week 6)'''\n\nThe final two trucks arrived in Lower Manhattan, with Grill Em All essentially being supported by previously eliminated Spencer on the Go who gave the burger boys a chef's jacket and the name of a restaurant wholesaler. The two trucks got $500 seed money and were given special instructions: they had to sell $500 in each of the five New York City boroughs, unable to move to the next borough until they hit the 500 limit in each (first the [[Bronx]], then [[Queens]], [[Brooklyn]], [[Staten Island]] and finally [[Manhattan]] where the sales needed were doubled to $1,000). The first team to finish their necessary sales in all five boroughs would race to the top of the [[Flatiron Building]] to win $50,000. The Nom Nom Truck did slow sales, lagging behind Grill Em All, until they won the truck stop, allowing them to skip Staten Island and catch up to the other team in Manhattan.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: Tyler called the teams late into day 2 and told them to stop selling, and get some sleep so they'd be ready for their final challenge in the morning at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn (at that point, Grill Em All was ahead in Manhattan while Nom Nom Truck was just getting into Staten Island). They had an hour to prepare the opposing team's signature dish for judge Chef Nate Appleman. The winners got a $500 bonus, meaning they could skip one of the boroughs. Winner was '''Nom Nom Truck'''.\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Food Truck Elimination Table\n|-\n! ''Truck''\n!

They all met in Malibu, California, but were immediately sent to Las Vegas, Nevada, to officially start the race. The ''Truck Stops'' are outlined as little competitions to offer an advantage and ''Speed Bumps'' are introduced as twists meant to provide a disadvantage and force the teams to think on their feet. The grand prize was raised to $100,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/fn-dish/shows/2011/08/tyler-florence-dishes-on-the-new-season-of-food-trucks|title=Tyler Florence Dishes on the New Season of The Great Food Truck Race}}</ref> for this season only.\n\n===Truck Teams===\n{{Great Food Truck Race Labelled Map 2|float=right}}\n\n'''Roxy's Grilled Cheese''' \u2013 A [[Boston]] food truck run by brothers James and Mike, along with experienced Chef Marc. They aim to bring upscale versions of grilled cheese by using high-end cheeses, confit vegetables and local breads.\n\n'''Seabirds''' \u2013 Representing [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], this all-woman, all-vegan truck is run by friends Stephanie, Raya, and Nicole. They plan to bring Cali freshness to the country in the form of beer battered avocado tacos and BBQ jackfruit sandwiches.\n\n'''Hodge Podge''' \u2013 Hailing from [[Cleveland]], this truck is led by Chef Chris along with his sister Catie and his girlfriend Jacquelyn. Their food is a self-professed \"hodge podge\" with ingredients thrown together to make tasty dishes.\n\n'''The Lime Truck''' \u2013 The second Orange Country truck, it's manned by Jason, Daniel, and Jesse. They take a less-organized approach to menu building with different dishes for every stop. As long as it's fresh and delicious, they aim to make it.\n\n'''Sky's Gourmet Tacos''' \u2013 a food truck from Los Angeles that serves Mexican/soul fusion cuisine. The truck is operated by Chef Barbara, her son Victor, and their friend Kevin.\n\n'''Cafe Con Leche''' \u2013 Operated by lifelong friends Gabriel, Maria, and Frankie, this truck from [[Van Nuys, California]] is dedicated to serving authentic Cuban cuisine and coffee.\n\n'''Devilicious''' \u2013 A [[San Diego]] truck that's run by engaged couple Dyann and Mark, along with their friend Kristina. They specialize in over the top, twisted comfort food served with a \"devilish\" attitude.\n\n'''[[Korilla BBQ]]''' \u2013 Coming all the way from [[New York City]], Eddie, Paul, and Steve were Columbia graduates who turned to their Korean roots when they couldn't find jobs in their chosen field. They dish out tacos and burritos with modern Korean tastes.\n\n===Episodes===\n'''What Happens In Vegas (Week 1)'''\n\nThe food trucks all convened at the Malibu Pier before being directed to go northeast to Las Vegas, Nevada. They got $500 seed money. The Lime Truck partnered up with a local Vegas food truck they knew, and invited the Seabirds truck into the partnership. Korilla also called a friend who owned a food truck in Vegas to partner up. Sky's Gourmet Tacos blew out a tire on the way to Vegas, costing them time and money ($185) to fix, as well as an exclusive appearance at a festival. Roxy's Grilled Cheese clashed with The Lime Truck when they ended up at the same lot.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: There was no truck stop in this episode. Instead the \"Speed Bump\" was introduced. It's a challenge that required all the teams to handle a sudden, unpleasant twist in a creative way.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: In honor of Las Vegas, Tyler spun a wheel of different problems that would hinder their truck (including \"two flat tires\", and \"one man down\"). The wheel landed on \"out of propane\" which meant all the trucks had to stop using propane with six hours of the day left. They could sell cold food, raw food, or find another way to cook (like butane burners or electric griddles).\n\n'''A Pinch Of Salt Lake City (Week 2)'''\n\nAs soon as everyone arrived in Salt Lake City, they were given $100 seed money and their first truck stop challenge. All the trucks had to simplify their menus because of the small budget, some opting not to buy meat. The first day, Cafe Con Leche ended up booking a catering gig through the city's Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. Roxy's partnered up with a local food truck serving out of a large parking lot but was soon sent away by the property manager. Lime Truck opted to go vegetarian and went behind Seabird's back to sign an exclusive deal at a pet event. The second day brought varying degrees of success for all the trucks, with their customers following them when they had to move due to the speed bump.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The food trucks had to make their own sausages by hand at a special sausage facility, then drive back 12 miles to pick five ingredients from a basic pantry table, meaning the last truck to arrive would get slim pickings. Local Chef Ryan Lowder picked the best dish, which would earn extra $100 (doubling their seed money). Korilla opted not to do the challenge but keep the meat to supplement their meager seed money. The Seabirds opted not to go to the sausage factory because they were vegan, so they were the first to pick ingredients off the table. Winner was '''Hodge Podge'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: The trucks were required to relocate at least one mile away from their current location. Since Hodge Podge won the truck stop, they didn't have to move.\n\n'''Rocky Mountain Highs And Lows (Week 3)'''\n\n[[Robin Roberts (newscaster)|Robin Roberts]] of ''Good Morning America'' was there to greet the trucks and help present part of the prize for the truck stop cooking challenge which was done as soon as they arrived. With only the truck stop winners getting seed money, the other trucks had to buy their groceries on credit. A partnership came about when Hodge Podge offered their location connections in exchange for Lime Truck promoting them on their TV spot. Cafe Con Leche had the fewest customers and got overcharged by a Cuban restaurant they partnered with.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The teams had to forage for wild mushrooms in the mountains outside Denver and create a dish featuring the local mushrooms, with a box of pantry staples provided by Tyler. Local Chef Frank Bonnano picked the winning truck, who would do an exclusive interview with the local ABC news affiliate to promote their truck, and get $200 of seed money. The remaining trucks received no seed money. Winner was '''The Lime Truck'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: On day 2, the trucks received a call from Tyler and [[John Elway]] who told them the trucks could only be handled by one member of the team.\n\n'''Big Bites, Little Apple (Week 4)'''\n\nThe college town of Manhattan, Kansas meant a more modest, low-priced menu for heartland Americans. Even so, the teams got a generous $400 seed money. On the first day, Hodge Podge, Lime Truck, and Korilla ended up in the city park, while Roxy's parked near a smaller college. Word traveled fast and all the trucks got huge crowds. Seabirds had a very slow start leaving many customers waiting. The Lime Truck started with an upscale menu but after the speed bump, had to close down and buy ingredients to make cheaper dishes.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The trucks were given a $5 debit card to buy what they could at a nearby market and make a dish. Kansas City food critic Charles Ferruzza would be judging. The winning truck would be the only team allowed to park in Aggieville, a popular restaurant area near the university campus. Winner was '''Seabirds'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: The trucks were required to sell everything on their menus for less than $1.00 (a challenge they got on Saturday instead of the usual Sunday).\n\n'''Hog Wild In Memphis (Week 5)'''\n\nOnce everyone arrived at the Memphis Court Square, as in previous episodes, they had to do a truck stop challenge. They got $500 seed money. Independent of the official 'Speed Bump' and 'Truck Stop', Tyler sent a local food blogger, \"The Chubby Vegetarian\", around to sample their dishes. The best dish was granted immunity, which was The Lime Truck. Korilla, Hodge Podge, and the Lime Truck had many ups and downs, in terms of customers. Towards the end of the second day, the power gave out in Hodge Podge's truck. In the end, Tyler disqualified Korilla BBQ for putting $2700 of their own money in the till; had they not cheated, they would've moved on with the third highest sales and Hodge Podge would've gone home.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The teams had three hours to butcher and prepare a 100-pound pig, and prepare a barbecue sauce to go with it. They were judged by Jim Neely, well known in the Memphis BBQ circuit. The winning truck earned an additional $500, doubling their seed money and they could go sell right away, while the losing teams had to butcher the remainder of the pigs (including the winning truck's pig) to donate to a local food bank. Winner was '''Roxy's Grilled Cheese'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: Partway into their first day, the trucks were told they couldn't serve anymore meat and had to remake their menus into vegetarian ones.\n\n'''Midnight Truck To Georgia (Week 6)'''\n\nThe trucks pulled into the Centennial Olympic Park and received $500 seed money before being sent out to get started on their truck stop cooking challenge. Hodge Podge had a strong first day thanks to getting exclusive access at Atlantic Station mall while Lime Truck and Roxy's picked poor locations with little foot traffic. Lime Truck managed to get the mall location on the second day, making up for some lost sales the first day; the only truck that didn't get the mall rush was Roxy's Grilled Cheese.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The trucks had one hour to find the nearest place to buy peaches and peanuts, then run back to create a dish using mystery ingredients from 1 of 3 baskets. The peach retrieval had mixed results with Roxy's buying fresh peaches, Lime Truck only able to find dried peaches, and Hodge Podge having to settle on a free peach cobbler before time ran out. A local chef, Kevin Rathbun, judged who best used the peanuts and peaches and the winning team received $1,000 (and a large golden peach). The winner was '''Roxy's Grilled Cheese'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: The lead chefs on each truck were removed (and sent to enjoy a day at the [[High Museum of Art|High Museum]]), while the two remaining teammates had to operate the truck. With approximately 45 minutes left of selling in day 2, the chefs were allowed to return.\n\n'''Miami Heat (Week 7)'''\n\nThe final two arrived at Watson Island to learn their goal was to reach $15,000 profit before rushing to [[South Pointe Park]]; first team there wins the grand prize. To start, they got $500 seed money. Hodge Podge was able to get product from an old boss of his while Lime Truck didn't get a chance to call their usual contacts, expecting a truck stop to delay them, so they just shopped at a big box store. Hodge Podge ended up at a car lot with other local food trucks. Midway into day 1, they got their first speed bump, disabling use of their trucks so Lime Truck cooked mussels on a portable burner and Hodge Podge sold high end sashimi with foie gras. Tyler put a stop to Day 1's late night sales because their truck stop was going to be in the morning. Then he shut them down again during the evening of Day 2 for the second speed bump.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The teams had to venture out 5 miles into the Atlantic Ocean by boat and go fishing. They had 30 minutes to catch a fish and 30 minutes to prepare it. Local chef Michael Schwartz judged their dishes and the winning truck received $1,500 towards their till. Winner was '''The Lime Truck'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump #1</u>: The teams had 5 minutes to grab whatever they needed off their trucks before they were towed. To get their trucks back, they needed to make $200 from the food they grabbed. Hodge Podge was first to hit their target with Lime Truck catching up a little later.\n\n<u>Speed Bump #2</u>: The teams were required to shut down for the latter part of Day 2. Then for the first two hours of day 3, the trucks only sold desserts.\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Food Truck Elimination Table\n|-\n! ''Truck''\n!

Instead they were all amateurs who wanted their own food-truck business. Food Network designed each team's truck based on their proposed concept.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/great-food-truck-race-tyler-florence-1052078/|title=Novices Can \"Lose Everything\" in Season 3}}</ref> The winning team would get $50,000 and got to keep their truck.\n\n===Truck Teams===\n{{Great Food Truck Race Labelled Map|float=right}}\n\n'''Pizza Mike's''' \u2013 Veteran pizza makers with years of restaurant experience, Mike, Pat, and Carlo come all the way from [[Columbus, Ohio]], hoping to get back into the food business after Mike lost his restaurant in a fire. Their background is Italian food and their specialty is pizza.\n\n'''Momma's Grizzly Grub''' \u2013 After being inspired by previous seasons of the show, former financial analyst Angela recruited her daughter Adriane, and her best friend Tiffany to join her in the third season of the race. They come all the way from [[Wasilla, Alaska]] to serve homestyle comfort food.\n\n'''Pop-A-Waffle''' \u2013 Friends Bobaloo and Scott, with no kitchen experience, brought in chef Anthony to help realize their dream of making their own gourmet waffles. They're from [[Los Angeles]] and they're excited to work for themselves.\n\n'''Barbie Babes''' \u2013 This is the second all-female team made up of Hayley, Jasmin, and Skye. The three friends moved from [[Australia]] to Los Angeles and started a catering company to make ends meet. They developed a love for cooking and they want to bring Australian barbecue all across the states.\n\n'''Under the Crust''' \u2013 The theme of this team is sweet and savory pies. Chef Hannah, her mother Sheri, and her friend Gary, have experience selling pies at farmer's markets in [[San Diego]]. Hannah wanted to start a food truck with her fianc\u00e9 Keith but lost him to cancer.\n\n'''Coast of Atlanta''' \u2013 Hailing from [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], this is an all-chef team made up of Lena, her boyfriend Mike, and their friend Tawanaca. They want to leave the restaurant world to work for themselves with their southern style seafood dishes like shrimp & grits and fried catfish.\n\n'''Seoul Sausage''' \u2013 This is the third Los Angeles team, made up of brothers Ted and Yong with their friend Chris. They have experience and a following from selling their sausages at events but want their own truck to regularly serve their Korean-style sausages and kimchi-fried rice balls.\n\n'''Nonna's Kitchenette''' \u2013 Jaclyn, Lisa, and Jessica are best friends from [[Parsippany, New Jersey]] and the third all-female team of the race. Their plan is to make traditional Italian food using recipes passed down from their grandmothers, including meatball subs and pizzelle ice cream sandwiches.\n\n===Episodes===\n'''3,559 Miles to a Dream (Week 1)'''\n\nThe teams all met at Long Beach, California to get their first look at the food trucks they will be using for the race. However, the new trucks are bare and they had to stock it with not just food but cookware, utensils, and sanitary equipment (as mandated by the health department). They received $1500 seed money to fully stock their truck, then they had to go to Los Angeles to sell. Pop-A-Waffle teamed up with Barbie Babes who took so long to shop that they used their first day just to prep. Under the Crust didn't find a good parking location in the first day so they had no sales. After Under the Crust's elimination, Tyler announced that Food Network would donate $5,000 to the [[American Cancer Society]] in honor of Hannah's deceased fianc\u00e9, Keith.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: There was no cooking challenge for the amateur food-truck owners in their first weekend. They had enough to do trying to figure out how to maneuver their trucks.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: With six hours left in the second day, the teams had to relocate to Hollywood Boulevard to compete against each other in a sell-off.\n\n'''Attitude at High Altitude (Week 2)'''\n\nOn the way to northern Arizona, Momma's Grizzly Grub called up Nonna's Kitchenette and Seoul Sausage to propose a team up. The teams were advised to look over their menu and selling strategies because every city is different. They were given $400 seed money. Momma Grizzly's partnership worked well as Lisa from Nonna Kitchenette knew someone who lived in Flagstaff and allowed them to set up three spots downtown, attracting a huge crowd. Pizza Mike's stumbled onto the trucks and set up nearby, as did Barbie Babes later on, who priced their food too low the first day and adjusted for the second day's sales but were hampered by a slow shop and a bad spot. When Mamma Grizzly's sold out and closed early, Barbie Babes took their parking spot.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: Their first cooking challenge came halfway into the first day of selling. It required them to make a dish out of cactus and put it on their menu to be judged by local chef, [[Beau MacMillan]]. The winner got immunity. Winner was '''Pop-A-Waffle'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: At the beginning of the second day, the trucks were required to serve only vegan food.\n\n'''Even Food Trucks Are Bigger In Texas (Week 3)'''\n\nThe trucks arrived at a baseball stadium in Amarillo which set the theme for the weekend. After getting $500 in seed money, they were told to shop and return to the stadium lot to compete head to head for the baseball crowds. They also got a chance to promote their truck during the seventh inning stretch. In the midst of preparing for their chosen ballpark customers, they got a truck stop. Pizza Mike didn't buy enough product for the ballgame and sold out early. On the second day Momma's Grizzly, Pop-A-Waffle, Seoul Sausage, and Coast of Atlanta all ended up at a large grocery store parking lot. Nonna's Kitchenette got steady business at a hardware store, and thanks to this week's speed bump Pizza Mike's got stuck at a park they only meant to serve until 5pm. Seoul Sausage was the only truck who could leave and opted to go back to the baseball stadium after serving the lunch rush at the grocery store.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The teams had to include a ballpark special, a food that could be found in any stadium. They were judged by stadium concessionaire, John Ciarrachi. The winning team earned $500 and a mysterious key which ended up being useful for the Speed Bump. Winner was '''Seoul Sausage'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: On day 2, everyone had boots put on their trucks and were immobilized for the whole day. (Except Seoul Sausage who won a key in the truck stop that unlocked the boot, and allowed them to leave their spot when the crowds died down.)\n\n'''Baby Got Razorback (Week 4)'''\n\nAnother stadium was the destination for the trucks this week. They got $300 seed money and were advised that the Arkansas college town meant lower pricing and a more streamlined menu was necessary. The trucks were told to close early on day 1 for an early morning truck stop challenge. They were again told to close early on day 2 for a speed bump challenge. Nonna's Kitchenette, Seoul Sausage, and Pop-A-Waffle managed to secure the only three spots at a farmer's market so Coast of Atlanta and Momma's Grizzly parked nearby. Momma's Grizzly accidentally knocked over a street lamp and had to pay a $250 penalty.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: In the morning of day 2, the teams had to create a breakfast dish that included a secret ingredient, [[Pop-Tarts]], to be judged by teen chef, Jeremy Salamon. They all got strawberry and a second flavor, different for each truck. The winner received a token that was worth $750. Winner was '''Nonna's Kitchenette'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: On day 2, the teams had to close their doors after serving breakfast, and reopen at 1:00 am that night for the college-bar crowd. They would continue making sales until sunrise.\n\n'''Music City Madness (Week 5)'''\n\nThe trucks rolled into Pottsville, Tennessee and finally got a truck stop challenge upon arrival. They were given $300 seed money. Three trucks had moderate customer turnout; the fourth, Pop-A-Waffle, had tons of customers after winning their truck stop. On the second day, Nonna's Kitchenette accidentally backed into a car with their truck and was penalized $250. Momma Grizzly's joined Pop-A-Waffle later in the day but business continued to be slow for most of the trucks.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The trucks had to create a picnic basket, featuring their takes on classic Southern dishes. The winner earned $1,000 toward their till and the exclusive rights to serve 1,500 people at an event hosted by [[Joey + Rory]]. Winner was '''Pop-A-Waffle'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: On the second day, two members of each truck had to sit out, leaving behind the head chef. Two culinary students replaced the two team members and the chefs had to train them on the menu.\n\n'''Mistake By The Lake? (Week 6)'''\n\nAfter arriving at Voinovich Park in Cleveland, the teams got $100 in seed money and an assignment: buy three local Ohio tomatoes for a truck stop. Later in the day, Seoul Sausage and Nonna's Kitchenette partnered up with local businesses to recoup their losses from being shut down for three hours. Near the end of day 2, Pop-A-Waffle got a tip on serving concert-goers but they got stuck in traffic and missed any sort of crowd by the time they arrived. At the end of this episode, Tyler proclaimed they would continue on to the finale and gave them their seed money, $500, and instructions to start selling as soon as they get into the next town.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The teams had to make a simple dish featuring a previously purchased Ohio-grown beefsteak tomato, judged by [[Outback Steakhouse]] founder, Tim Gannon. The winner got $250 added to their till, and got to sell for three hours, while the other teams had to shut down their trucks during those hours. Winner was '''Pop-A-Waffle'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: On the second day, the teams had to take what they could out of their trucks before closing them down and selling on foot from a hot dog cart until 6:00 PM.\n\n'''Where In The World is Lubec? (Week 7)'''\n\nThe final two set out to conquer three cities across two states in the finale that started at the end of the previous episode. They started in Boston with large crowds but late into the day, they got a truck stop. The winner of the truck stop was announced early on day 2 and got a headstart on moving to the second city: Portland, Maine. Seoul Sausage followed and parked beside Nonna's Kitchenette on day 2 and day 3, serving up tons of people and earning almost the same amount of money from people who wanted to try both trucks' food. At the end of day 3, they were directed to drive to the little town of Lubec, Maine with a population of 1,600 people. The race ended on day 4 at [[West Quoddy Head Lighthouse]] where the team with the highest sales were given $50,000 and the keys to their food truck.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: Three fresh lobsters were delivered to both trucks and the teams had to make a New England style dish featuring the lobster. The dishes would be judged by two local fishermen, Christian Rodolosi and Clark Sandler. The winner got $500 added to their till, and got to move on to the next city, while the losing team had to shuck six bushels (600 pounds) of clams. Winner was '''Nonna's Kitchenette'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: An unofficial \"speed bump\" was given to the teams when they were on their way to Lubec. They had to sell everything for $2 or less.\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Food Truck Elimination Table\n|-\n! ''Truck''\n!

This season reinforced the \"race\" part of the title by awarding varying amounts of monetary bonuses counted towards their tally for winning the challenges. That means that in each episode, the team who finished a special \"Truck Stop\" challenge goal the fastest, and drove to a preset destination, would get \"first place\" (and there would be \"second place\" and sometimes even \"third place\" bonuses worth less). Food Network designed each team's truck based on their proposed concept. The winning team earned $50,000 and got to keep their truck.\n\n===Truck Teams===\n'''Boardwalk Breakfast Empire''' \u2013 This truck from [[Sea Bright, New Jersey]] serves breakfast comfort food. Joanne had experience working at her family's coastal cafe for years until Hurricane Sandy destroyed the restaurant. Unable to raise enough funds to rebuild, she recruited her friends Tim and Ilene to help her win her own food truck.\n\n'''Bowled and Beautiful''' \u2013 A [[Los Angeles]] team that creates California style bowls. Heather, Jessica and Liza are three single moms who met in culinary school and want to have their own business for their children. They serve up couscous, rice, and even nachos in bowls with various toppings.\n\n'''The Frankfoota Truck''' \u2013 Led by enthusiastic friends Mirlinda, Dana and Victoria, and representing [[Brooklyn]], this truck is focused on one thing: hot dogs \u2012 and the many, different toppings that can be put on their childhood favorite food.\n\n'''Aloha Plate''' \u2013 Brothers Adam and Lanai are joined by their friend Shawn. They grew up in [[Lanai, Hawaii]] and Adam was sent to culinary school thanks to a man he saved from drowning. The three have left the islands to serve authentic Hawaiian dishes to the mainland.\n\n'''Murphy's Spud Truck''' \u2013 Culinary student Nicole, her mother Suellen, and her brother James are from Los Angeles; making them the second LA team. After graduating culinary school, Nicole got seriously ill. She hopes her specialty stuffed potato truck is her ticket to achieving her culinary dreams after her brief medical setback.\n\n'''Philly's Finest Sambonis''' \u2013 Straight out of [[Philadelphia]], childhood friends Erik, Joe, and Chris serve authentic Philly cheesesteaks and sandwiches known as sambonis. Erik used to work as an electrician before a car accident caused nerve damage and left him unable to go back to that trade.\n\n'''The Slide Show''' \u2013 The third Los Angeles team of the season features trained chefs Das, Ahren and Mo. Das appeared on [[The Next Food Network Star (season 6)|Food Network Star]] and even opened his own restaurant but his business partner double crossed him. Now he's ready to get back in the game with gourmet sliders and fries.\n\n'''Tikka Tikka Taco''' \u2013 Brothers Michael and Shaun have brought their Uncle Sam, from [[St. Louis]] to travel across the country and bring modern Indian street food to the masses. Their signature dish is their tikka marinated chicken tacos.\n\n===Episodes===\n'''I Left My Food Cart in San Francisco (Week 1)'''\n\nThe Hollywood sign overlooks the park where eight teams set eyes on the food truck of their dreams. Unlike last season, they had kitchen equipment. After being given $250 seed money, they were instructed to go to Beverly Hills where they had to make and sell one signature dish for no less than $20. On the second day, the trucks were sent to San Francisco (in a certain order thanks to a Speed Bump). They couldn't make the same dish they sold in Beverly Hills and they sold side by side at SOMA StrEat Food Park. Murphy's Spud Truck initially couldn't get their propane working, which meant they couldn't cook their potatoes so they were forced to make inexpensive salads.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: There was no cooking challenge for the food-truck novices in the first week.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: Early evening of day 1 had the trucks stop selling in Beverly Hills. They had to move to San Francisco early morning of day 2, but they would leave in 15 minute increments based on how much money they earned in Beverly Hills. '''Bowled and Beautiful''' made the most and left first, while ''The Frankfoota Truck'' made the least and left last (1 hour and 45 minutes after the first truck).\n\n'''A Strange Brew in Portland (Week 2)'''\n\nEveryone arrived in northern Oregon and learned that they would have to partner up with local businesses with private lots because they weren't allowed to park on city streets. They received $350 seed money. Rainy weather on the first day affected most of the trucks by limiting foot traffic. After the speed bump was announced, all the trucks raised their prices to stretch the food they got. Frankfoota, Tikka Taco, and Philly's Finest ran out of food before the second day. Everyone was able to restock mid-way into the second day and they got a Truck Stop challenge that had them changing their menu (they could only sell dishes with geoduck in it) and their prices (their dishes  had to be $10 or less). The Franfoota truck got a $60 ticket on their car.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The teams got 6 pounds of local geoduck and had to sell $200 worth (bumped up from an initial $100 goal). Once the $200 threshold was met, the teams had to race to [[Council Crest Park]] to find a token. The first team to retrieve the token won $500 towards their till. If they couldn't hit the $100 mark by 7 pm, they had to shut down for the night. Winner was '''Bowled and Beautiful'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: After their first day shop, the trucks could not restock until Tyler called them and told them so, which didn't happen until around 2:30 pm of the second day. This affected some trucks who planned to shop light with the intention of buying more food if they ran out.\n\n'''Pocatello Is All About Potatoes, You Dig? (Week 3)'''\n\nSince Idaho is known for its potatoes, the teams were told to meet at a potato farm that would prove to be important for later. They got $300 seed money and were sent into Pocatello to start selling. On day 1, Tikka Taco partnered up with Philly's Finest to sell at a farmer's market. They were joined by Bowled and Beautiful and Slide Show. Before any food got served, they got a Speed Bump that forced them to change their menu. Frankfoota joined Aloha Plate at a location that ended up being outside the city limits, so both trucks got penalized $50 for every hour they sold outside of Pocatello. On the day 2, the Philly's Finest truck hit a hanging sign and they had to pay a $500 deductible.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: On the second day, the teams were sent to the farm they visited when they first arrived, and they had to dig up their own potatoes to sell on their truck. After selling $750 worth of potato dishes, they had to race to the City Creek Trailhead for the chance to win one of three tokens that will add to their till; one large token worth $500, one medium token worth $250, and one small token worth $50. ''Winner'' was '''Bowled and Beautiful''', ''1st Runner Up'' was ''Aloha Plate'', ''2nd Runner Up'' was '''Philly's Finest Sambonis'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: Early on in the first day, the teams were ordered to remove all items containing starch (including bread, potatoes, and pasta) from their trucks and donate them.\n\n'''About Face in South Dakota (Week 4)'''\n\nThe teams gathered at the base of the [[Crazy Horse Memorial]] where they received $50 seed money. They were sent to Rapid City and had to shop wisely because they got a Speed Bump right away. All trucks stationed themselves close to a store to replenish their stock and cut down on travel time, with some teams running and others hitching a ride from customers. Philly's Finest got into an argument on day 2 that was kickstarted by half their bread order being frozen. Aloha Truck has been using their \"coconut wireless\" Hawaiian connections to secure parking spots and bring in Hawaiian transplants to support them.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: On day 2, the teams had to go to the Wild Idea Buffalo Company one by one in 15 minutes increments based on how much money they made on day 1 (most money earned went first). There, they spent 15 minutes butchering their own quarter rack of buffalo. Aloha Plate was the first team to go and Philly's Finest Sambonis was last. After selling $1,500 of worth of buffalo dishes (with a $10 limit on each dish), the teams raced to Vista Point for the chance to win one of the three tokens to add to their till: one large token worth $750, one medium token worth $500, and one small token worth $250. ''Winner'' was Aloha Plate, ''1st Runner Up'' was '''Tikka Tikka Taco''', and ''2nd Runner Up'' was '''The Slide Show'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: While the teams shopped, their cars got towed. Since only two people were allowed to safely ride in the truck, they had to figure out how the third person would be traveling when they had to move to their selling location and back to the grocery store to restock. At the end of the first day, each team had $100 taken out of their till to get their car back.\n\n'''Double Trouble in the Twin Cities (Week 5)'''\n\nOnce again, the teams will be selling their food in two different locations; Minnesota's twin cities. They got $400 seed money and were sent to Minneapolis first. Philly's Finest accidentally ordered bread from two branches of the same market and had to pay $120 for the extra bread ordered and wasted. They were sent to St Paul on the second day but heavy rain hampered sales for all the trucks except for Aloha Plate who continue to get the word out to Hawaiian customers in every city they visit. Philly's Finest also had troubles on day 2 in the form of truck engine trouble but eventually someone with jumper cables helped them out.\n\n<u>Truck Stop #1</u>: On day 1, the teams had to serve all of their food on a stick, and sell $1,500 worth of it by 8PM. After hitting their goal, they had to race to [[Stone Arch Bridge (Minneapolis)|Stone Arch Bridge]] to grab one of the two tokens to add to their till: one large token worth $750 and one small token worth $250. However, no team completed the challenge.\n\n<u>Truck Stop #2</u>: On day 2, the teams had to create a special dish on their menu out of [[Spam (food)|Spam]]. After selling $500 worth of food with their Spam menus, the teams had to race to the Peace Officers Memorial at the [[Minnesota State Capitol]]. The first team to arrive would win immunity and the other teams that completed the challenge by 8:30 pm would win $500 toward their till. ''Immunity Winner'' was '''Aloha Plate''', '''$500 Winners''' were '''Tikka Tikka Taco''' and '''Philly's Finest Sambonis'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: The teams were required to move from Minneapolis to Saint Paul.\n\n'''A Food Truck Kind of Town, Chicago Is (Week 6)'''\n\nThe trucks pulled into Grant Park to cook in a Truck Stop challenge. After that, they got a Speed Bump that would stick with them for the rest of the race. They got $500 seed money and were told that the finale had technically already started. Philly's Finest went out of their way to secure authentic rolls and when they drove back to find a selling spot, they were stuck in traffic, putting them behind. On day 2, they got their second Truck Stop. Tikka Taco got a parking ticket and Philly's Finest drove around without finding a decent location the whole day. Only Tikka Taco completed the second truck stop in time. There was no elimination this week and for the first time, three trucks headed into the finale.\n\n<u>Truck Stop #1</u>: The teams had to create their own deep dish Chicago-style pizza using a portable wood-fired oven to be judged by Chicago Mayor [[Rahm Emanuel]]. The winning team got a proclamation from the Mayor and earned $1,000 toward their till. Winner was '''Tikka Tikka Taco'''.\n\n<u>Truck Stop #2</u>: A sixth item had to be added to every truck's menu: a Chicago-style hot beef Polish sausage sandwich for $7 each. They had until 3:00 pm to sell 300 sausage sandwiches, then race to [[Mike Ditka]]'s restaurant. The first team to arrive got signed footballs from Mike Ditka and a five-hour head start to the next city: Annapolis, Maryland. The losing trucks spent the five hours washing dishes at the restaurant. Winner was '''Tikka Tikka Taco'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: At the beginning of day 1, the teams were required to have a minimum of five dishes on their menu for the rest of the race.\n\n'''Capital Gains (Week 7)'''\n\nContinuing from the last episode, there were three teams headed for Maryland, with Tikka Taco having five-hour headstart. Philly's Finest got their friends and family to drive out and support them while Aloha Plate continued to bring out the Hawaiians as well as curious onlookers, and Tikka Taco pulled in crowds at a prime location by the docks. After the first truck stop, Tyler made a mid-episode elimination. The final two headed to Arlington, Virginia were Tikka Tikka Taco ($9,129) and Aloha Plate ($8,562). Leaving the race mid-episode was Philly's Finest Sambonis ($5,685). On the \"fifth day\" of the two episode finale, the two trucks had to go to the [[United States Capitol|U.S Capitol Building]] in Washington D.C. where the winner would be declared. Food Network donated $2,500 to the Fallen Patriot Fund in honor of a fallen veteran friend of Shaun from Tikka Tikka Taco.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: On their second day in Annapolis, the teams were told to go to Kent Island, where they were required to haul their own crab and create an original crab dish. They were judged by Navy Culinary Specialist Jamar Hargress. The winning team received $1,500 toward their till. Winner was '''Aloha Plate'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: On their second day in Arlington, the trucks had to add a special dish to their menu that honored the other team. Tikka Tikka Taco added a teriyaki burger to their menu, while Aloha Plate added chicken tikka tacos with yogurt sauce. Both had to be priced at $10, and if they sold 50 specials before the race ended, an extra $1,000 was added to their till.\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Food Truck Elimination Table\n|-\n!

This season was treated as a \"food-truck boot camp\" for the contestants with each week focusing on a different topic. \nThere were several tokens of various values awarded for most of the challenges, making it so the fastest team to get to the tokens, got to choose the highest valued one (which was applied to their final tally). Food Network designed each team's truck based on their proposed concept. The winning team will earn $50,000 and keep the truck.\n\n===Truck Teams===\n'''Lone Star Chuck Wagon''' \u2013 Hailing from [[Houston]], Lance and his wife Rachel have a home business where they've sold BBQ sauces and rubs for years. Now they want to expand their business so they brought their friend Andrea to help make BBQ and Tex-Mex.\n\n'''Military Moms''' \u2013 Carol, Michele, and Wendy are from [[Fort Drum, New York]] and they've bonded through having husbands deployed in the military as well as their love of comfort food, which is their truck's staple menu.\n\n'''The Middle Feast''' \u2013 Emigrating from [[Israel]] to [[Los Angeles]], Tommy had a promised restaurant job before it folded. Now he's brought his sister Hilla, and his friend Arkadi to dish out Middle Eastern classics like falafel and shawarma.\n\n'''Chatty Chicken''' \u2013 A family truck run by Greg Sr., his son Greg Jr. and daughter Megan. They've been having troubles with their roadside food stand in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] so they hope a new food truck will help realize their southern chicken dreams.\n\n'''Beach Cruiser''' \u2013 This truck comes from [[Venice, California]]. It's the brainchild of Gretta who had bought a truck before but couldn't get it approved by the city. Along with her friends Shane and Nicole, they want to bring \"fish tacos and fried avos\" to the masses.\n\n'''Let There Be Bacon''' \u2013 The selling point of this [[Cleveland]] truck is bacon. Chefs Dylan, Matt and Jon have worked together for 10 years but after a bout with cancer, Matt couldn't work full-time and his restaurant job so he and his friends want a food truck to set their own schedule and menu.\n\n'''The Gourmet Graduates''' \u2013 Roberto, Keese, and Julius are from [[Providence, Rhode Island]] and just as their name suggests, this trio is made up of culinary school graduates. They aim to serve dorm food with a gourmet twist.\n\n'''Madres Mexican Meals''' \u2013 From [[Norwalk, California]], Chef Javier wants to prove to his father that he made the right decision in pursuing culinary. Along with his mother Luisa, and his wife Senorina, this trio aims to make authentic Mexican dishes.\n\n===Episodes===\n'''Venice Beach Brawl (Week 1)'''\n\nThe food-truck hopefuls converged on the docks of Santa Barbara to get acquainted with their trucks and get their first assignment: make three dishes with $200 seed money and start selling in Santa Barbara. Each truck got a metal briefcase that they weren't allowed to open until the time was right (the end of this season). Chatty Chicken didn't buy enough oil for their deep fryer so they had to pan fry everything which took longer. Everyone had to move spots because of a speed bump, which thrilled Beach Cruiser \u2012 who teamed up with Let There Be Bacon \u2012 since everyone would be moving to Beach Cruiser's home turf. Chatty Chicken had to go back to their truck twice while doing a re-stock grocery run. Let There Be Bacon closed early because their water wasn't running.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: In a blind challenge where none of the teams were informed, two local food-truck operators, Sabin and Jim (from Cousins Maine Lobster), went to each truck and asked for their best dish. They picked their top three favorites; the first place team got an extra $500 in their till, the second place team got an extra $200, and the third place team got $100. Winner: Madres Mexican Meals, 1st Runner Up: Beach Cruiser, 2nd Runner Up: Gourmet Graduates\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: Late into the first day, every truck had to move from Santa Barbara, California to Venice Beach, California.\n\n<u>Theme This Week</u>: Branding the Truck\n\n'''Hot Doggin' It in Tucson (Week 2)'''\n\nThe trucks pulled into a veritable wild west set known as Old Tucson and got $300 seed money but had to spend $100 on marketing. Tyler gave each team a flag with their truck logo on it as a brand awareness and marketing starting point. While some teams bought props to get attention (Beach Cruiser and Gourmet Graduates), others paid for advertising (Madres Mexican Meals and Middle Feast), and others offered discounts or raffles (Military Moms and Lone Star Chuck Wagon). On day 2, all the trucks had to go to a local food festival for a speed bump.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: Partway into the first day, the teams had to add a $5 Sonoran hot dog as a fourth menu item. The team that sold the most Sonoran hot dogs would be awarded $500 toward their till, the second-highest seller would get $250, and third place would get $100. Winner was '''Beach Cruiser''', 1st Runner Up was '''Military Moms''', and 2nd Runner Up was '''The Middle Feast'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump #1</u>: The teams had to move from their current locations to a local folk festival and sell head to head, adjacent to each other.\n\n<u>Speed Bump #2</u>: The teams had to create a jingle within a 30-minute time frame, then perform in front of a large crowd at the aforementioned folk festival.\n\n<u>Theme This Week</u>: Marketing\n\n'''Dinner Dates, Austin Style (Week 3)'''\n\nThe teams rolled into Austin where they got $250 seed money and a lesson in partnerships. Everyone's keys were put into a pot and the first key picked out got a chance to choose their partner. Lone Star chose Military Moms, Let There Be Bacon chose Middle Feast, and Beach Cruiser ended up with Madres Mexican. They didn't share sales but they did have to stick together in buying and finding parking spots. Middle Feast and Let There Be Bacon had good sales by securing a location at a gelato festival on Day 1, while the rest of the trucks had very slow foot traffic. On day 2, Beach Cruiser and Madres Mexican made a deal to join the festival, upsetting Middle Feast who was promised exclusivity by someone else at the festival.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The teams had to switch trucks with their partners for part of the second day, and cook their opponent's menu but the money they made went into their own cash till. Lone Star swapped with Military Moms, Let There Be Bacon swapped with Middle Feast, and Beach Cruiser swapped with Madres Mexican. The team who sold the most of their opponent's food earned $500 toward their till, second got $250, and third got $100. Winner was '''Let There be Bacon''', 1st Runner Up was '''Beach Cruiser''', 2nd Runners Up was a tie between '''The Middle Feast''' and '''Madres Mexican Meals'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: Mid-way into the first day, the teams had to relocate to a [[match.com]] dating event until 7 pm and vie for the attention of the participants who each had one $25 token to award their preferred truck (the object being to get the most tokens for their truck).\n\n<u>Theme This Week</u>: Partnerships\n\n'''High Steaks in OKC (Week 4)'''\n\nAfter arriving at botanical gardens of Oklahoma's capital, the teams were told to add a beef dish to their menu, and they were given $400 seed money. To reinforce this week's theme about how \"time is money\", there was a secret speed bump at the very beginning that Tyler didn't tell the teams about until after the fact. All the trucks ended up at the same neighborhood in the center of town and had huge lines the first day. The second day had various degrees of success with initial slower foot traffic for Madres Mexican after they parked at a race track. Madres Mexican also had trouble with a meat grinder for their truck stop challenge, slowing them down.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: On day 2, the trucks were told they had to sell fried onion burgers and fries for $10 for the rest of the day. The first team to sell 50 burgers would get $500 and the second team would get $250. Winner was '''Beach Cruiser''', Runner Up was '''The Middle Feast'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: As soon as the teams left to buy their groceries, Tyler timed them to see who shopped, prepped, and opened the quickest. The teams had to shut down and reopen in 15 minutes increments in the order that they started selling. First open was Madres Mexican Meals (who didn't have to shut down), then Lone Star Chuck Wagon, then Middle Feast, then Let There Be Bacon, and lastly, Beach Cruiser.\n\n<u>Theme This Week</u>: Time Management\n\n'''St. Louis Upsell (Week 5)'''\n\nThe gateway arch in St Louis greeted the incoming food trucks and so did a speed bump. Every truck partnered up with a local business and every truck had huge crowds of people waiting for them. Lone Star raised their prices figuring people who waited on line would be willing to pay a premium price. Tyler made surprise visits to each truck to check on their timing and the quality of their food. He chastised Lone Star on their high prices in relation to skimpy portions.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: On the second day they were challenged to make their best dish. They would put it on their menu and sell it, then at 5:30 pm, they would go to the botanical gardens to have Tyler judge what they came up with. The winner of best dish got whatever profit they made so far, doubled. Winner was '''Lone Star Chuck Wagon''' (additional $5,000).\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: The teams were given no seed money to start with, so they had to make their money by selling toasted ravioli.\n\n<u>Theme This Week</u>: Food Quality\n\n'''Shrimpin' Ain't Easy (Week 6)'''\n\nThe docks of Bayou La Batre was the inspiration for the theme of cooking locally. Since they were near the Gulf of Mexico, the teams were told to add three seafood dishes to their menu, using local ingredients. They got $400 seed money and a Speed Bump that allowed them to potentially get a lot of shrimp. Both Lone Star and Let There Be Bacon used local shrimp but peeling and prepping the shrimp slowed them down. Middle Feast chose not to get shrimp and did three different fish dishes. Lone Star planned to buy some higher quality fish for a potential seafood cook challenge, and to sell for a high profit, but they forgot to buy it.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The second day brought a two-part cooking challenge where the three trucks were told to make a brunch dish which was bought by a random secret shopper and judged by Tyler. The best two dishes (Let There Be Bacon and Lone Star Chuck Wagon) would qualify to compete in a 20-minute Gulf Seafood challenge judged by Tyler and chef Pete Blohme. The best seafood dish would get $1,000 toward their till. Winner was '''Let There Be Bacon'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: On the first day, before shopping, the teams went to a warehouse freezer and had to guess and collect 100 pounds of shrimp by feel alone. Whoever got closest to 100 pounds got the shrimp they collected for free. The other teams were given a chance to purchase shrimp at wholesale prices. Winner was '''Lone Star Chuck Wagon'''.\n\n<u>Theme This Week</u>: Local Ingredients\n\n'''Finale at Mile 0 \u2012 Winning Keys in Key West (Week 7)'''\n\nThe final two made it to Tampa, the first of five stops across southwest Florida. They revisited everything they learned in their food-truck boot camp. Both had to pick five dishes that best represented their brand: one dish had to be sold for $5, three dishes were to be priced at $10, and one dish for $15. They were tasked to record a 30-second radio commercial in the second city, Bonita Springs, that would play in their final destination. They were partnered up and sent to Naples, Florida to sell pre-chosen food to get their seed money. Alligator Alley was a bit of a detour and the setting for their last Truck Stop challenge, while Key West was the fifth and final city where they would sell their menu over the course of two days. Middle Feast stuck close to Lone Star during their final two selling days. At the end of the race, the two teams gathered at [[Key West]]'s White Street Pier and the winners were announced by opening a briefcase (every truck got a briefcase all the way back in Venice Beach and inside the briefcase was the corresponding truck's logo).\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The teams took airboats all the way to Captain Gerald's House in the middle of the Everglades. There, they received some local alligator and frog's legs that they had to cook to be judged by Tyler. The winning dish got their seed money doubled. Winner: The Middle Feast (from $184.50 to $369)\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: There were no official \"Speed Bumps\" but there were several challenges over the course of the finale. The major challenge was when the two trucks had to partner up in Naples and sell pre-determined ingredients; they would split whatever profit they made together and that would be their seed money moving onto Alligator Alley (Lone Star made $200 and Middle Feast made $169).\n\n<u>Theme This Week</u>: All of the Above: Marketing and Branding in the commercial, Partnerships in selling for their seed money, Local Ingredients in the Truck Stop, and Time Management and Food Quality in their final city.\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Food Truck Elimination Table\n|-\n!

The winning team earned $50,000 for their business.\n\n===Truck Teams===\n'''Spice It Up''' \u2013 This trio is made up of working moms Nichole, Chris and Keri. Joining the race from [[Phoenix, Arizona]], these women have a passion for bold flavors and spice-filled curries.\n\n'''Postcards''' \u2013 A Zagat-rated soul-food truck from [[Los Angeles]], this team is led by Greg who wants to open his own restaurant. Supporting him are his daughter, Grae and his friend Monique.\n\n'''Pho Nomenal Dumplings''' \u2013 Friends Sunny, Sophia, and Becca come from [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. They left their corporate jobs to operate a truck serving Asian fusion cuisine including Taiwanese pork dumplings and corn dog bahn mi.\n\n'''Waffle Love''' \u2013 Coming from a big Mormon family out in [[Provo, Utah]], brothers Adam, Steven, and Jared rely on their faith and their food to guide them to victory. They want to bring Belgian [[Li\u00e8ge]] waffle creations to the masses.\n\n'''Diso's Italian Sandwich Society''' \u2013 A [[New York City]] truck that serves fresh Italian sandwiches. Adam was inspired by his grandfather to start up the business and brought in Chef Danamarie and Chef Benny to see it through.\n\n'''The Guava Tree Truck''' \u2013 Authentic Cuban cuisine is dished up by this [[Dallas, Texas]] truck. The team is led by Onel, his wife Pam, and their daughter Mariah.\n\n'''GD Bro Truck''' \u2013  Globally Delicious Stuffed Burgers is the full name of this [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] truck. True to the name, Mark, Kevin, and Geoffrey serve up gourmet, stuffed burgers and fries.\n\n===Episodes===\n'''All-American Road Trip (Week 1)'''\n\nSince the contestants are all professional food-truck owners, they immediately get their first task: sell $200 worth of their most popular item on the Santa Monica Pier. The first team to hit their goal was Spice It Up so an extra $100 was added to the $200 they made. The other trucks made various amounts of money (from $140 to $20) which ended being their seed money, along with an extra $66 given by Tyler in honor of the route they would be traveling: Route 66. They all got a map directing them to Lake Havasu City, Arizona. Pho Nomenal Dumplings' truck broke down before they could start selling in Arizona so they had to get towed around to their selling destinations that weekend. The Guava Truck had a bit of trouble with their generator on day 2 but managed to fix it.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: In honor of Lake Havasu's London Bridge, the trucks were given cod and potatoes, and told they had to serve their version of fish and chips. First team to sell 20 orders received an additional $500 for their till. Winner was '''Diso's Italian Sandwich Society'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: There was no official speed bump in the first episode.\n\n'''Off-Road Eats in Arizona (Week 2)'''\n\nStaying in Arizona, the trucks drive to Flagstaff (with Pho Nomenal Dumplings having rented a new truck to replace their old one). Everyone got $200 seed money and were told to sell as much as possible for a potential advantage later on. All the trucks had trouble selling in cold, rainy weather the first day but Waffle Love sold the most and got a one-hour head start on day 2 when they would all be moving a few miles south to Sedona. All the trucks ended up selling at a large supermarket parking lot. There was a sizable vegetarian community in Sedona which prompted Spice It Up and GD Bro to add a vegetarian dish to their menu.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: Late morning on the third day, the teams had to sell rattlesnake rabbit sausage dishes while riding around in pink jeeps. At 2:00 pm, they had to return to pay $100 for the sausage. All profits from selling the sausage dishes would be doubled for every team. After paying for the sausage, Spice It Up sold the most with $435, Diso's Italian sold $265, GD Bro sold $199, Postcards sold $135, Phonomenal Dumpling sold $20, and Waffle Love was the only truck to lose money (-$10).\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: There was no official speed bump but on the first day there was an early \"Quick Fire challenge\" which consisted of the teams competing to get the most sales of their signature dish. The winner got an hour advantage the next day. Winner was '''Waffle Love'''.\n\n'''Spicy Showdown In Santa Fe (Week 3)'''\n\nAs soon as everyone arrived at Santa Fe, they were given a Truck Stop cooking challenge. The trucks had a steady stream of customers in the first day and were mostly busy at the farmers market on the second day, except for Spice It Up whose menu was presumed too complex for the morning crowd. They did manage to get an afternoon rush but they sold out with four hours left in the day, and couldn't restock thanks to a speed bump. Postcards accidentally dinged the bumper of a parked car and got fined $500 for leaving the accident and for the actual damage.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The teams had to create a dish using New Mexican chiles and they were given $50 for additional ingredients. They were judged by local Chef Martin Rios and the best dish would get $1,000 towards their till. Winner was '''Postcards'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump #1</u>: In the middle of day 1 sales, the teams had to buy all the food they thought they would need for the rest of the weekend. They were not allowed to shop again even if they sold out.\n\n<u>Speed Bump #2</u>: At the beginning of day 2, the teams were given spots next to each other at the Santa Fe Railyard Farmers Market and had to stay until the farmers market closed.\n\n'''High Steaks in Texas (Week 4)'''\n\nEveryone drove to The Big Texan Steak Ranch restaurant in Amarillo were they were given an initial $50 in seed money and the chance to earn more by completing a 20-minute eating challenge where they had to eat 72 oz of steak, a salad, a baked potato, three fried shrimp, and a dinner roll. The first to finish was Pho Nomenal Dumplings, followed by GD Bro, and Waffle Love. They received an extra $250 each. Postcards did not finish 11 oz of their steak and therefore only earned $150 for the steak and $50 for the sides. All four trucks ended up at the same supermarket parking lot on day 1 and they were all busy, though Postcards was slow to open due to their prep time. On day 2, GD Bro and Pho Nomenal sold in one parking lot and Waffle Love and Postcards ended up at another lot. Every Sunday thus far, the Waffle Love team went to church before selling their food so Postcards took advantage and sold to the people waiting there.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: While not officially identified as a truck stop, their culinary challenge was to make and sell a steak dish. The team that sold the most steak dishes would win an extra $500. Winner was '''GD Bro'''. There was a second part to the steak selling contest where all the steak dishes were secretly tasted and judged by the Big Texas Steakhouse owner Bobby Lee. The best steak dish would get an extra $500. Winner was '''Pho Nomenal Dumplings'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: On the second day, two of each truck's team members had to leave for 30 minutes to go shopping for new supplies, leaving one team member to run the food truck by themselves.\n\n'''Roadside Attractions (Week 5)'''\n\nThe remaining teams convened at the Blue Whale of Catoosa and immediately got their unofficial Speed Bump and $500 to spend on it and their food. Midway into day 1, Tyler and a local classic car club member, Dick McGuire, went to the three attractions to admire the attractions and taste each dish. Tyler told them where to go the next day then returned their phones.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: On day 2, the trucks arrived at the Admiral Twin Drive-in to serve to members of a classic car club. They had 20 minutes to go to as many cars and pitch their roadside special dish. Each club member then drove by the truck (getting food drive-thru style) and used a $25 chip to buy their preferred dish. The team who got the most chips was Waffle Love, with $925 total. Both GD Bro and Pho Nominal got $450 each.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: Upon arrival, the teams got their cell phones taken away and were required to have roadside attractions to market their trucks instead of utilizing social media. They also had to make a $15 lunch dish to complement their attraction.\n\n'''Showdown In Chi-Town (Week 6)'''\n\nThe final two faced off under the St. Louis arch in one final truck stop cooking challenge. After getting $150 seed money, they were told to make a 3-hour pitstop in Springfield, Illinois to make more money for their final destination: Chicago. Pho Nomenal earned $796 for Chicago supplies and Waffle Love earned $755. The final challenge was to sell 50 dishes customized to three different neighborhoods: Chinatown, Little Italy, and Greektown. After selling all 150 dishes, they had to be first across the finish line at [[Buckingham Fountain]]. Waffle Love kept tabs on Pho-Nomenal via social media. Despite winning the truck stop, initially allowing Pho Nomenal to sell only 20 dishes in Chinatown (120 dishes across three neighborhoods), they were penalized for selling outside of Greektown's small boundaries, meaning they had to re-sell 50 dishes in Greektown (total of 170 dishes sold by Pho Nomenal in Chicago).\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: Upon arrival, the teams were given chicken, ground beef, and pork steak to create three winning dishes in 90 minutes. Pitmasters Adam and Frank from Adam's Smokehouse served as judges. The winner would be able to sell 30 fewer dishes in Chicago. Winner: Pho-Nomenal Dumplings.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: Not dubbed as an official speed bump but a challenge: since Springfield was the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln, they were only allowed to collect $5 bills as their form of payment, requiring all dishes to be priced at either $5, $10, or $15.\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Food Truck Elimination Table\n|-\n!

The race also stayed mainly in the state of California. The \"Speed Bump\" and \"Truck Stop\" challenges were no longer identified as such, but there's still at least one inter-truck competition in each episode. The winners received $50,000.\n\n===Truck Teams===\n'''Carretto Siciliano''' \u2013 Noted for having Vinny<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/790447/your-jersey-shore-fave-is-now-competing-on-the-great-food-truck-race|title=Your Jersey Shore Fave Is Now Competing on The Great Food Truck Race | work=eonline.com}}</ref> from [[Jersey Shore (TV series)|The Jersey Shore]], this truck specializes in homemade Sicilian food prepared by Vinny's mom, Paola, and his uncle Angelo. Paola wants to open up her own restaurant and Vinny aims to use his reality show fame to bring attention, and customers, to her cause.\n\n'''Grilled Cheese All-Stars''' \u2013 Twin brothers Michael and Charlie, from [[Northern California]], want to open a truck devoted to cheesy foods and they have serious experience having trained as cheesemakers in France and worked on dairy farms across Europe. Their college friend, Bryce join them to make their dreams come true.\n\n'''Lei-Away Leidies''' \u2013 Having moved from [[Laie, Hawaii]] to Utah, sisters Carey and Summer never forgot their Hawaiian roots and want to bring poke bowls and teriyaki burgers to the masses via food truck. Summer's daughter, Autumn is there to help the women achieve their dreams.\n\n'''BigMista's Fatty Wagon''' \u2013 Barbecue master Neil and his wife Phyllis own restaurants in [[Long Beach, California]] but believe a food truck is the way to expand their business. They're joined by their \"adopted BBQ son\", Eric and together they serve up southern food, with an emphasis on BBQ.\n\n'''Fortune Cooking''' \u2013 All the way from [[Milford, Michigan]], this team is led by self-proclaimed Samurai Chef Tom, his wife, Julie, and Julie's friend, Tiffany. Though Tom owns several restaurants specializing in Asian fusion, and has competed in other Food Network shows, he wants to get into the food-truck business.\n\n'''Sweet Southern Soul''' Tiffany is a police officer from [[Chicago]] who has a passion for cooking and seeks to open her own restaurant one day, dishing out quinoa and chicken southern bowls. She's joined by her sister Tikia and her friend Kizzma making them the second all-female truck in the race.\n\n===Episodes===\n'''A Family Affair (Week 1)'''\n\nThe six teams arrive via large bus to Six Flags Magic Mountain where they had to find the key to their food truck under one of twelve plates of funnel cakes; if they chose a plate with no key underneath, they had to eat the funnel cake. They got $300 seed money before being sent into Los Angeles to sell. Sweet Southern Soul had some trouble with their truck's pilot light and they couldn't make any sales on the first day. Vinny from Carretto Siciliano got a parking ticket which ate into most of his day 1 profits. On the morning of day 2, they got a phone auction/challenge. Tom from Fortune Cooking accidentally sideswiped two parked Los Angeles food trucks, damaging a mirror and cooler cover.\n\n<u>Challenge</u>: Tyler offered a spot for one food truck inside Six Flags and each team had to bid for the spot, in the hopes that they would be able to make back the money they spent for exclusive access inside the theme park. Carretto Siciliano bid $400 and got the spot. The gamble paid off because they ended up with first place at elimination.\n\n'''Things Get Berry Interesting (Week 2)'''\n\nUp north in Oxnard, the teams discover there's a strawberry festival and after getting $200 seed money, they are given their first cooking challenge of the season. Lei-Away Ladies used a familiar past season technique of \"coconut wireless\" (first mentioned by season 04's ''Aloha Plate''); calling in all Hawaiian locals in every city to support them. They got lost for a bit following a local Hawaiian to a parking spot but ended up at the spot and all his friends and family came to buy their food. On day 2, four of the five trucks started off at a farmer's market (Lei-Away stuck with their previous parking spot and got the repeat Hawaiian customers). Grilled Cheese sold their food for lower prices which meant more sales but an overall lower profit. Big Mista's overfilled their propane tank so they had to wait for the excess to leak out before they could cook, then later on, after picking a slow location they decided to close early.\n\n<u>Challenge</u>: The teams had to buy strawberries from the local Oxnard strawberry festival and make two dishes, one sweet and one savory (this was like a \"Truck Stop\" cooking challenge). Bonnie Atmore, a spokeswoman for the strawberry festival, visited each truck to taste their strawberry dishes and the one she deemed the best would win $300 towards their till. The winner was '''Sweet Southern Soul'''.\n\n'''An Egg-cellent Adventure (Week 3)'''\n\nFurther north in wine country, the teams rolled up to an ostrich farm (Ostrichland USA) where they were challenged to participate in an egg hunt inside a large ostrich pen. Each team member had to find an ostrich egg that was dyed a specific color related to their team. Once they found their three eggs, they could go start selling in Solvang. They got their $300 seed money and all parked relatively close to one another. All the trucks had huge lines on both days since Solvang is a tourist destination with Danish-style architecture.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: While they were shopping, the teams got a phone call telling them they had to make a family recipe dish using their three collected ostrich eggs. A secret shopper, Chef Seth, was sent around the trucks to try the dishes. The winner would get immunity; '''Carretto Siciliano''' won.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: Partway through the second day, they were thrown a curveball (akin to a \"Speed Bump\") in the form of little [[aebleskiver]] pans that were delivered to all the food trucks. All the teams' pots and pans were replaced with the special Danish pans for a few hours.\n\n'''A Dessert In The Desert (Week 4)'''\n\nOn the outskirts of Palm springs, the teams met near the Cabazon Dinosaurs tourist attractions and got $500 seed money. Since they were in the desert, the teams had to retool their menus to feature lighter fare and cooling desserts. That's where Tyler came in with another phone auction challenge. On the first day, the Lei-Away ladies took a long time finding a good spot and ultimately ended up downtown along with the other two trucks. On the second day, after a potential locaton didn't yield any customers, Grilled Cheese tried to park near Caretto's but since it was a private lot, they parked just far enough away while still being close to the customers attracted by Carettos. The finale was kickstarted at the end of elimination with the final two given instructions to begin selling as soon as they reach their final destination. They were given $400 seed money.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: Before they went shopping, the teams got a phone call. They had to sell desserts priced at $6 but they had to bid on chocolate, fresh fruit, and nuts with each team getting exclusive use of the ingredient they bid the most on. Grilled Cheese All-Stars won exclusive use of chocolate for $25, Lei-Away Leidies paid $45 for fresh fruit, and Carretto Siciliano were left with nuts for $25. The team who sold the most desserts got $200 towards their till. '''Grilled Cheese All-Stars''' won.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: On day 2, inspired by the Cabazon Dinosaurs roadside attraction, the three teams were challenged to become human roadside attractions for their food trucks. The team who took the most photos/selfies with people got an additional $200 towards their till. '''Carretto Siciliano''' won.\n\n'''The Island (Week 5)'''\n\nThe final two teams were ready to start selling right off the heels of the last episode. Upon arriving at San Pedro harbor they had one hour to shop, prep, and load their trucks onto a barge heading to their final destination: Catalina Island. Then they encountered their final selling challenge. Once on the island, they competed head to head, side by side, and had 12 hours to sell as much as possible (instead of the past finales that ranged from 2 days to more). Tyler personally took the truck's cash boxes to count them up and announce the winner in front of the Catalina Casino. After the winner was announced, it was revealed that both finalists got their own miniseries on Food Network; Caretta Siciliano got '[https://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/vinny-and-ma-eat-america/episodes Vinny & Ma Eat America]' and Grilled Cheese All-Stars got '[https://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/big-cheese/on-the-set-of-big-cheese-in-los-angeles Big Cheese]'.\n\nChallenge: While their trucks were transported, the teams had to sell hot dogs out of carts in San Pedro for about two hours. The team who made the most money selling hot dogs were taken to Catalina Island by helicopter, earning them an hour head start, while the other team had to travel by boat. The Grilled Cheese All-Stars won.\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Food Truck Elimination Table\n|-\n\n! ''Truck''\n!

Once again, there's no \"Speed Bumps\" and \"Truck Stops\" but there are still challenges worth money and occasional curveballs. The winning team gets a $50,000 prize courtesy of [[Farmer's Insurance]].\n\n===Truck Teams===\n'''Stick 'Em Up''' A straightforward theme of food on a stick from [[Rogersville, Tennessee]]. Shona has a successful catering business back home and has brought her two sons Justin and Landon to help realize her dream of expanding her business.\n\n'''The Breakfast Club''' \u2013 All three in this team are young, self-proclaimed millennials from [[Philadelphia]]. Mikey leads the team with best friends Taylor and Ashanti. They dish up breakfast and brunch inspired dishes like loaded breakfast nachos and mocha doughnuts.\n\n'''Braised in the South''' \u2013 Nick, Steven, and Brandon are a group of classically trained chefs and best friends from [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. They serve up food with a southern flair like BBQ Shrimp Tacos and Cajun Chicken \"Tatchos\".\n\n'''Mr. Po' Boys''' \u2013 Running a successful food stand at their [[Dallas, Texas]] farmer's market, Cedric and Ryan are culinary school graduates with business know-how. They are joined by another culinary graduate, Esther, and their specialty is gourmet po' boy sandwiches.\n\n'''The Southern Frenchie''' \u2013 All the way from [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], Chef Donnie owned a restaurant for ten years before losing it due to debt. Along with his wife Meaghan and sous chef Amanda, he hopes a food truck will be his second chance to show off his southern food with restaurant flair.\n\n'''Wicked Good Seafood''' \u2013 Bill, Ryan, and Dan are a group of friends from [[Falmouth, Massachusetts]] with restaurant backgrounds in a seaside town where business is slow during the off-season. They have a passion and knowledge for New England style seafood.\n\n'''Papi Chulo's Empanadas''' \u2013 A family business on wheels; Luis, his daughter, Carleena, and his niece, Sarah are the second Philadelphia team. Luis worked his way up in U.S kitchens since he immigrated from the Dominican Republic, and he cooks what he knows best: Dominican empanadas.\n\n===Episodes===\n'''The Big 'Not So Easy' (Week 1)'''\n\nThe newest batch of contestants converged on New Orleans to meet with Tyler and receive a beignet cooking challenge right off the bat. After a few hours of selling beignets, they were sent shopping to make their signature menu. Braised in the South spent a long time looking for a parking spot and Papi Chulo's Empanadas had a trouble making their empanads due to the heat. Some trucks had a good flow of customers (Brunch Squad & Wicked Good Seafood) while others hardly got anyone the first day (Braised in the South & Southern Frenchie). The second day saw a little improvement in customers for everyone.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: Each food truck had to sell their version of a decadent beignet in New Orleans. Ingredients were provided and any profit made was added to their $300 seed money. The truck who made the most was Stick Em Up ($131) and the least sold was Wicked Good Seafood ($35).\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: On day 2, the trucks had to make a special of the day using ingredients from the town's popular \"Hurricane\" drink (passionfruit, orange, and lime). New Orleans Chef Susan Spicer went to each food truck to pick best dish, which would get $100 towards their till. The winner was '''Mr Po' Boys'''.\n\n'''New Marching Orders (Week 2)'''\n\nThe trucks headed east and arrived at the [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]] where they immediately get a \"kickoff\" cooking challenge. During the challenge, Papi Chulo's ran out of their tortillas before they could serve all the troops. Afterwards, they got $200 seed money and left to go shop and sell. Papi Chulo's couldn't find empanada dough at the store so they opted to sell tacos. Southern Frenchie won a monetary challenge so they initially didn't worry about first day sales, wanting to focus on prep for the second day. But when they saw other trucks with plenty of customers, they quickly scrambled to make sandwiches to sell. Po' Boys found out, via social media, that Stick Em' Up had a good spot at City Hall and parked nearby. On day 2, Southern Frenchie joined the other two trucks at City Hall.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: Working in pairs, the food trucks had to make cohesive dishes to serve 50 aviation service members and the troops would choose their favorite dish of the three teams. The two winning trucks each got $200 towards their till. The Breakfast Club paired with Stick 'Em Up, Braised in the South picked Southern Frenchie, and the remaining Mr. Po' Boys worked with Papi Chulo's Empanadas. The winning teams were '''Braised in the South''' and '''Southern Frenchie'''.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: The mayor of Pensacola, [[Ashton Hayward]], wanted the teams to incorporate red snapper into a dish. The truck that sold the most fish dishes would win immunity. The winner was '''Stick Em' Up'''.\n\n'''Sweet Home Alabama (Week 3)'''\n\nLooping up north, the teams reached the Tuscaloosa courthouse and were met with a physical challenge, then told of an additional pecan dessert challenge. They got $200 dollars seed money. Braised in the South and Southern Frenchie decided to park near breweries and got huge crowds. Most of the trucks, save for Stick Em Up (who chose to park at the supermarket parking lot), ended up with lots of sales. Early on the second day, Tyler assigned them a \"happy hour\" special where they had to sell their pecan desserts for $1. Stick Em Up ended up snagging the spot that Mr Po' Boys had the day before but they underestimated the crowds there and quickly sold out. Mr Po' Boys also sold out. All the trucks had waves of customers during the lunch hour.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: Two people from each food truck had 15 minutes to crack pecans. The team who cracked the most pecans in 15 minutes got mentored by baker Jan Potter and the rest of the teams had to cleanup the pecan shells. '''Braised in the South''' won.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: Everyone had to add pecan desserts to their menu. The team who sold the most pecan dessert dishes got $300 towards their till. '''The Breakfast Club''' won.\n\n'''Hot Chicken in the City (Week 4)'''\n\nHome of the Grand Ole Opry and hot chicken, Nashville was the destination for the remaining teams. They had to do a taste and cooking challenge before they were given $300 seed money. On the first day, Mr Po' Boys drove around for hours looking for a good parking spot. They weren't the only ones with troubles; all the trucks had low sales and sparse foot traffic. The second day was better all around in terms of sales and customers, and it had Tyler and a guest judge going around to taste the food and determine the winner of the second challenge.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: The truck teams had to make their version of fried, spicy hot chicken but could not use chicken. Chef Aqui Hines went to each truck to taste and chose the best dish. The winning team got $500 in their till. '''Mr Po' Boys''' won.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: On the second day, the teams were challenged to do self-promotion for their truck. Tyler and country singer [[Craig Wayne Boyd]] went around and judged which team was best representing and promoting their truck. The winning team got immunity (the second immunity prize of this season). '''The Breakfast Club''' won.\n\n'''Fresh Off the Farm (Week 5)'''\n\nArriving at Thomas Orchards in Athens, the teams were greeted by Tyler and a peach challenge. They got $300 seed money and were told to partner up with local business because, by law, the Georgia college town had no street parking. Braised in the South partnered with a brewery, Mr Po Boys used a print shop's parking lot, and Breakfast Club paired up with a bar & grill. One of the chefs from Braised in the South, Nick, got a surprise visit from his wife who offered support. The trucks all had ups and downs in terms of customers. Tyler went to each truck to talk to the teams, offering encouragement and advice.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: The teams had 30 minutes to make a savory peach appetizer for Tyler and Chef Mimi Maumus to taste. Then winners could choose to shut down their competitors for one hour at any point during their time in Georgia. '''Braised in the South''' won (and they shut down the other two trucks in the middle of day 2).\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: As they were shopping, Tyler texted the teams and told them to change their menus for the weekend. They were not allowed to make anything they've sold in the last four cities.\n\n'''The Race Through Savannah (Week 6)'''\n\nThe final two were on their way to the oldest city in Georgia when they got a call from Tyler telling them to start shopping and selling. They received $300 seed money at the supermarket. Mr Po' Boys immediately got a prime parking spot in front of a bar and it took Braised in the South a little while to find a spot. The teams were side tracked by a selling challenge then returned to a steady flow of customers. The second day had the trucks moving to different areas for a seafood cook challenge, parked side by side, and competing head to head. They met at the Savannah riverfront to find out the winners by opening a briefcase; the winning team would have a case filled with the money.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: In the middle of day 1, the final two got a call and were told to sell their food out of pedicabs for one hour. The team that sold the most got $500 in their till. The winners were '''Braised in the South'''.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: At the beginning of day 2, Tyler gave both teams a location to go to. Every few hours the location would change and they had to cook a different type of shellfish. The team who sold the most shellfish dishes got an additional $500 in their till. The winners were again '''Braised in the South'''.\n\n* ''1st location'' \u2013 [[Squares of Savannah, Georgia#Johnson Square|Johnson Square]] (shrimp)\n* ''2nd location'' \u2013 [[Savannah Civic Center]] (scallops)\n* ''3rd location'' \u2013 [[Forsyth Park]] (clams)\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Food Truck Elimination Table\n|-\n!

They begin in Los Angeles, California and the final two return there to finish the race. There are various challenges throughout the competition as well as the occasional curveball. The winning team gets $50,000.\n\n===Truck Teams===\n'''Sassy Soul''' \u2013 Three friends from [[Washington D.C.]], Sassy, Carson, and Paris, make up this all-women team who dish out comforting soul food. Chef Sassy started out cooking shrimp over rice for her friends to make some money and soon found she had a passion for it.\n\n'''Just Wing It''' \u2013 Kevin, Sharon and Steven met as contestants on season 12 of [[Worst Cooks in America]]. They were impressed by Kevin's chicken wings and based their food gimmick on that. They hope to prove to viewers that they can really cook now.\n\n'''Buns N' Thighs''' \u2013 Chef Ian has brought his girlfriend, Victoria, and her mother, Marla, to try and make his dream of a food truck come true, hoping that their experience running a business in [[Chicago]] will give them an edge over the other teams.\n\n'''New England Grill''' \u2013 Chef Kevin from [[Rhode Island]], Chef Eddie from [[New York (state)|New York]], and comedian Christine from [[Massachusetts]] form a trio with a common goal; to bring the flavors of New England, from lobster to scallops to Yankee pot roast, out to the west.\n\n'''Mobile Moo Shu''' \u2013 The second all-women team is made up of three friends from [[Michigan]] who specialize in Asian fusion food. Michelle and Marley started cooking together in college, and Chelsea learned Asian flavors while teaching in China.\n\n'''Heroes on a Half Shell''' \u2013 From [[Frederick, Maryland]], Donna leads this truck along with her oldest son, CJ, and youngest daughter Danni. They specialize in submarine sandwiches, scooping out a good amount of soft bread and leaving behind the \"shell\" to hold more of their fillings.\n\n'''Chops' Shop''' \u2013 Chef Bryan \"Chop\", a professional caterer, joins the race from [[Pearland, Texas]] and he's brought his mother Sandra, and his aunt Sonia to help serve up tasty Tex-Mex dishes like elote creamed corn and pulled pork nachos.\n\n===Episodes===\n'''Wagons Ho! (Week 1)'''\n\nEveryone gathered at Watt Ranch, outside Los Angeles and had to complete a little challenge before they got their seed money ($500) and food truck. They had to hand-squeeze enough oranges to fill a pitcher before going to Los Angeles to start selling. New England Grill got to their truck first and Buns N' Thighs were the last to fill up their pitchers. Most of the teams converged on Hollywoood on the first day but New England Grill was a few miles away and they accidentally broke their generator leaving them without lights. On day 2, most of the trucks had trouble finding a steady stream of customers with Sassy Soul spending most of their three-hour challenge window driving around.\n\n<u>Challenge</u>: At the start of day 2, the teams had to sell beef dishes for $12 a plate in three hours. The most beef dishes sold garnered $200 towards their till. However, they had to bid from a choice of six prime cuts of beef (since there were seven teams, the loser would get a mystery cut from Tyler). Heroes on the Half Shell bought ground chuck for $30, Chops' Shop bought beef ribs for $45, Sassy Soul bought New York strip for $100, Mobile Moo Shu bought flank steak for $80, and New England Grill bought filet mignon for $100. Neither Buns N' Thighs or Just Wing It bid on top round so they were given oxtail. The winner of the beef challenge was '''Mobile Moo Shu'''.\n\n'''Shrimp and Glitz (Week 2)'''\n\nSin City welcomed the teams with a shrimp challenge. Michelle from Mobile Moo Shu had family in Las Vegas who came to buy food and support her truck. On day 2, they got $200 seed money and were able to buy things to sell (besides the free shrimp in the previous day). Because almost all the food trucks lost money in the first episode, Tyler and restaurant-business consultant, Elizabeth Blau, went to each truck to taste their signature dish and offered menu tips and financial advice. Heroes on the Half Shell paired up with Chops' Shop and many of the trucks went through lulls and high-selling periods.\n\n<u>Challenge</u>: As soon as they arrived in town, the teams were given shrimp and pantry staples, and told to make a signature shrimp dish to sell head to head on Fremont Street. The team who sold the most in four hours got a prime, exclusive selling spot next to the Las Vegas strip the next day (no one else could park on the strip). The winners were '''Mobile Moo Shu'''.\n\n'''An Oasis in the Desert (Week 3)'''\n\nThe teams converged at a [[Sonic Drive-In|Sonic]] drive-thru restaurant in Phoenix and met with Tyler and Sonic's Senior Director of Culinary Innovation, Mackenzie Gibson, where they got a tasting challenge that preceded a cooking challenge. Just Wing It sneakily followed Mobile Moo Shu's online location posts and decided to park near them since they were the strongest team thus far. Victoria and Marla, from Buns N' Thighs, had to leave the competition to take care of a home business and an ailing father, respectively. That left Chef Ian alone to handle the food truck for the two days in Phoenix, a first on this show. The teams got $300 seed money and their \"challenge flavors\" for free (strawberries, lemons, iced tea etc.) Ian of Buns N' Thighs recruited a passerby to help on the first day and went at it alone the second day. On day 2, Mobile Moo Shu and Just Wing It were parked illegally so they had to move.\n\n<u>Challenge</u>: Part 1 of the Sonic challenge involved a blind taste test of three specially chosen Sonic drinks. '''Mobile Moo Shu''' guessed the most flavors correctly and won. Part 2 had the teams making a dish inspired by one of five Sonic drinks: mango limeade, ocean water, cherry limeade, raspberry lemon iced tea, and strawberry lemonade. As winners of the first part, Mobile Moo Shu got first pick of their flavor: mango limeade. Just Wing It were given strawberry lemonade, New England Grill were given ocean water flavor (coconut and lime), Chops' Shop were given cherry limeade. Buns N' Thighs got raspberry lemon iced tea. Later on, Tyler and Senior Director Mackenzie judged which truck utilized the drink flavors in their dish the best,  and awarded $200 to the winner. The winner was '''Chops' Shop'''.\n\n'''Bordertown Boom (Week 4)'''\n\nThe teams arrived at the Arizona Territory Prison and got a brief history lesson on the food provisions that passed through there, including artichokes and bacon. They all participated in an artichoke peeling relay race where each team member had to peel five artichokes. After fifteen artichokes were peeled, the teams could get their seed money ($300) and a cooking challenge. Just Wing It finished peeling first and Chops' Shop finished last. The first day, all the trucks ended up getting huge crowds and selling out of food; it affected Chops' Shop the worst because they decided not to buy too much initially, recalling their slow sales in past cities. Christine from the New England Grill truck suffered a head injury and had to be taken to the hospital, missing out on half the second day of selling. All four trucks were sent to a main street festival partway into day 2, and once again sold out, forcing them all to make a second shopping trip.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: Since bacon and artichokes were featured in the beginning of the episode, the teams were tasked to combine the two ingredients into a tasty dish. Whoever sold the most bacon and artichoke dishes would win immunity. The winners were '''New England Grill'''.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: A quick phone call from Tyler on the second day instructed the teams to get rid of their most popular menu dish and replace it with something new.\n\n'''First Dates (Week 5)'''\n\nEveryone met up at Hadley Date Gardens for another quick challenge before they got their seed money ($400) and the go-ahead to sell in Coachella Valley. They had to remove the pits from a pound of dates, without splitting the fruit, using wooden skewers. Just Wing It were the first ones to finish and New England Grill were last. All three trucks ended up on the same block on day 1 and had steady sales. On day 2, the trucks managed to get into a pre-music festival resort pool party for the lunch rush but when they left they had a slower dinner service, except for Just Wing It who opted to close early.\n\n<u>Challenge</u>: The three trucks had to make a dish using the dates they pitted. The dishes would be judged by the co-owners of the Hadley Date Gardens. The best dish got an additional $600 in their till. The winners were '''Just Wing It'''.\n\n'''The Whole Enchilada (Week 6)'''\n\nThe final two teams return to where they first started; Los Angeles. At the downtown plaza, they met Mexican restaurateur [[Bricia Lopez]] and found out they had to use Mexican ingredients, then they got $400 seed money. The first day, Just Wing It immediately got a parking space while New England Grill had some initial problems finding foot traffic. The second day had a slow start but there were steady sales, including some word of mouth attention for Just Wing It. Tyler personally visited both trucks to talk to them and give them an emotional pep talk. Later on, Mobile Moo Shu came by to visit Just Wing It. The final elimination took place at a western movie set in [[Paramount Ranch]].\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: On Day 1, they had to use chayote squash in a special dish. The truck with the best chayote dish got $350 in their till. The winners were '''New England Grill'''.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: On Day 2, the teams got a second Mexican ingredient, habanero peppers. The trucks had to sell habanero dishes for $10 and whoever sold the most dishes got their habanero profits doubled. The winners were '''Just Wing It'''.\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Food Truck Elimination Table\n|-\n! ''Truck''\n!

The teams begin in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. There are various challenges throughout the competition. The winning team gets $50,000.\n\n===Truck Teams===\n'''Baby Got Mac''' \u2014 A team from [[Los Angeles]], married couple Clinton and Samma started a catering company after cooking for friends at [[Dungeons & Dragons]] games. Along with their friend Rosa, these 90's children serve up varying styles of macaroni and cheese. Spending all of their money for renovation of a shuttle bus, the couple want to use the race to finish their project and restart their business on the road.\n\n'''Brunch Babes''' - A family affair and all-female trio from [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] dishes out unique and decadent brunch dishes. Composed of dance coach Lara, anesthetic nurse/cousin Lydia, and aspiring medical student Mariah, Lara's sister and a newlywed to a Marine, these ladies have a competitive nature inherited from their family. They look to stand out from the rest of the pack by busting out dance ribbons, acrobatic flips, and even a pineapple suit.\n\n'''Frank-N-Slides''' \u2014 Based in [[Boise, Idaho]], Chef Steve, with military vet Craig and energetic hype-man Kyle, serve gourmet hot dogs and sliders with specialty sauces that are, as they say, \u2018punch you in the face\u2019 bold. Steve also wrote a gourmet cookbook for the outdoors and portable cooking anywhere is his specialty. The team even have a hot dog costume to attract customers.\n\n'''Madea Made''' - Residing in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], former deputies and twin sisters Hope and Faith, along with Hope's husband Andre, with whom she runs a catering business with, showcase the home-cooking skills their family has taught through the years. This team is serving up dishes described as \"Southern soul food with innovation.\" Their truck name honors Hope and Faith's own grandmother Madea and the legacy of generations that came before them.\n\n'''Make It Maple''' \u2014 From [[Montpelier, Vermont]], Sue, her son Charles, and best friend Paulette, are passionate about cooking with local maple right from their Vermont backyards. So as such, the team features both sweet and savory dishes with maple flavors. The ladies know their sweet and savory dishes are crowd-pleasers from experience, as they have been catering to large groups for years.\n\n'''NOLA Creations''' \u2014 Hailing from [[Atlanta]], accomplished chef and Le Cordon Bleu graduate Darrell, his wife Anna, and sous chef Terrell, are serving up New Orleans dishes just like home. Born and bred in Louisiana, Darrell and Anna were successful restaurant owners only for [[Hurricane Katrina]] to destroy his business and a deadbeat contractor wiping them out financially. Even after all those years, Darrell and Anna will never leave behind their love for authentic Creole and Cajun food.\n\n'''The People's Fry''' \u2014 All the way from [[Nashville]], food service director Dareka, her pit-master husband Terrance and her \"spice queen\" sister Mahdi,  have teamed up to create a menu serving every kind of loaded french fry imaginable. Blending Dareka's classical training, Terrance's BBQ mastery, and Mahdi's West African flavors, their food can satisfy every taste.\n\n'''Rolling Indulgence''' \u2014 This team from [[Dayton, Ohio]] features three co-workers from the same restaurant. Head chef Drew, his high school sweetheart-turned-fianc\u00e9e Jess, who works as a cocktail waitress, and best friend/bartender Travis, have a family dynamic \u2013 they not only work together, they live together. They are ready to hit the road in a classic 1950s diner food truck, serving diner classics and indulgent cheat day dishes, and win it all to create their own path in the food industry.\n\n'''Sol Food Collective''' \u2014 Another team from [[Los Angeles]], private chef, health and wellness practitioner, animal activist and food blogger Jacquelyn looks to spread her message of delicious vegan food after her own experience changing to a plant-based diet changed her life. Health issues caused Jacquelyn to have mobility problems, but since going vegan she is active and feeling better than ever. Joining her is friend Malyssa, who stood by her during her illness, and Stephanie, who she met via social media, in her determination to spread the healing powers of her healthy and delicious menu from town to town.\n\n===Episodes===\n'''Rumble on the Boardwalk (Week One)'''\n\nTyler and the nine teams kick off the race at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, beginning their first challenge at Pyler Park. After the challenge, teams were given $400 shopping money and instructed to return to the park to sell their food head-to-head with the other trucks continuing the challenge the next day. On the way to the store, Sol Food Collective had accidentally sideswiped the front of Rolling Indulgence's truck with their own, popping up Rolling's bumper and lifting a side of their overhang. The weather eventually turned rainy, though everyone was able to get shopping done quick. Except Make It Maple, who had trouble finding key ingredients. Once back at the beach, water began leaking into some of the trucks, causing some of their appliances to not work. And it got worse for Make It Maple after Sue spilled all their milk for their Maple Dumpling dough, their most popular item. Once the rain stopped, the teams did everything to bring customers to their trucks for the rest of the weekend, from Terrence's infectious hollering, to the Brunch Babes flipping and ribbon dancing, and Kyle wearing a hot dog suit.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: The challenge was to make \"Boardwalk Bites\" in 40 minutes. Ten beachgoers were guest judges, including Tyler. The winning team received $300 to add to their till. The winner was '''Sol Food Collective'''.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: The following day, teams were back in the same location and given three pounds of crab meat donated by The Giant Crab Restaurant. Each team had to create a brand new dish incorporating the crab meat. The team that made the most money from their dishes wins immunity. Sol Food Collective, being a vegan team, decided not to do the challenge, even pulling out a god's card to know if they should not participate. The winner was '''The People's Fry'''.\n\n'''Back Nine Barbecue (Week Two)'''\n\nStaying in the home state of host Tyler Florence, the teams arrive in the golfer community of Hilton Head Island, driving on golf carts to the 18th hole of [[Harbour Town Golf Links]]. There, the first challenge of the weekend begins. After teams received their side dishes from said challenge, they take $300 in seed money, and head to the store. Parked at Shelter Cove Community Park to begin selling for the day, Tyler had the teams sell barbecue that was incorporated into their main dishes. As a gift, they were given five pounds Carolina pulled pork for their main dish given to them by One Hot Mama's. As teams began their prep, several problems began to arise. NOLA can't ignite their pilot lights, Baby Got Mac's water isn't boiling, leaving them with no noodles, and Frank-N-Slides opening early despite being behind a=on both prep and now tickets. The Brunch Babes also experienced problems, receiving tickets with modifications they can't keep up with. Anna wasn't feeling energetic self, so Darrell decides to step off the truck and help. In contrast to that, Terrence turned up his volume and began yelling out orders, which was heard throughout the park. He goes as far as to walk to Frank-n-Slides to promote their fries, but gets called out by Kyle and they engage in a fresh vs. frozen debate. Upon Day 2, Tyler asked customers how long they've been waiting in line and many described a long wait, so Tyler lectured on getting food out fast at elimination.\n\nChallenge #1</u>: For this challenge, a person from each team had to take a five-foot putt to determine the side dish they will be making for the rest of the day. Last week's final totals and the possibility of sinking the putt determines the order in which they could choose from the side dishes shown to them. Everyone missed except for '''Baby Got Mac''' who won and got first choice of their side dish, macaroni and cheese. For the rest of the teams, in order from second to eighth, '''NOLA Creations''' picked fried pickles, '''Brunch Babes''' chose collard greens, '''Madea Made''' picked coleslaw, '''The People's Fry''' chose mashed potatoes, '''Frank-N-Slides''' picked hush puppies, '''Rolling Indulgence''' chose baked beans, and '''Sol Food Collective''' were left with green beans.\n\nChallenge #2</u>: Teams were given two pounds of boiled peanuts, the state snack of South Carolina, and had to incorporate into an existing menu item. The team that sold the most peanut-infused dishes received and extra $400 in their till. The winner was '''Baby Got Mac'''.\n\n'''Fast and Furious (Week Three)'''\n\nTeams drove onto Daytona International Speedway, meeting Tyler on the infield. While thinking about last week and how they can do better this week, Sol Food Collective announced that Stephanie would be leaving the race. She was the one driving the truck when they crashed into Rolling on Week 1, affecting her emotionally. To shift some positive energy into the fold, Tyler asked, \"What the drivers do on the infield when they win?\" Donuts! Tyler introduced Donnie Summerlin, owner of Donnie's Donuts, to the teams as the guest judge for the first challenge. LA\\ater, they arrived at Daytona Beach Boardwalk to sell. As they prep, the health inspector came in and fined NOLA Creations $600 after finding some of last week's pork tucked in the back of their cooler. Meanwhile, the Brunch Babes, winners of the \"Donut Dash\", plan on calling the pit stop as soon as the others open their doors and steal the first sales. However, once the pit stop was initiated, everyone finished it in 15 minutes. After a short wave of customers, it was dead. On Day 2, Sol Collective lost another member when Malyssa began feeling pain and believed she had a kidney stone. With Malyssa going to the hospital, deja vu from last season came as Jacquelyn was left alone. Still with no customers, Travis heads to the beach, meeting the leader of Arizona State Men's Gymnastics team; giving them an order for 16 people. Meanwhile, Samma decided to help Jacquelyn with her prep, which later evolved to one member of each team helping advertise Sol Food Collective.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: Teams parked on the boardwalk and participated in a \"Donut Dash\", where the challenge was to craft one type of [[donut]] and make as many as possible in one hour. Donuts were worth one point each. The team judged for having the best-looking donut received two points per donut, and the best tasting donut was worth three points each. The winning team was able to call an \"Audible Pit Stop\" whenever they wanted, in which all sales and cooking stopped for the other food trucks while the winner continued to cook and sell. During the pit stop, the other teams had to play a game of [[Cornhole]] to earn their way back into the competition by scoring 50 points. '''Brunch Babes''' won both \"best-looking donut\" and \"best tasting donut\" and received five points per donut. They made 27 donuts for a total score of 135. '''Madea Made''' made the most donuts with 51 total.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: Local Atlantic white shrimp was sent to the teams and they were given one hour to create and sell a shrimp dish. The team that sold the most shrimp dishes received an extra $10 per dish added to their till. Sol Food Collective and Rolling Indulgence decided to not do the challenge due to their vegan beliefs and confidence in sales respectively. The winner was '''Madea Made''', selling 19 shrimp specials and adding $190 to their till.\n\n'''Tampa 911 (Week Four)'''\n\nAs teams arrive in Tampa, Craig reveals that he once lived in Tampa before moving to Boise, so he knows a bit about the city. As they all convene in Downtown, the Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister and his deputy squadron come out, to which Tyler asks if someone was speeding. Sheriff Chronister came up to Tyler, saying that he should've contacted him, before it was revealed to be a facade and that the two are great friends. Sheriff Chronister and the deputies served as judges for today's challenge. The teams went shopping afterwards. This was the first week that the teams had to find their own locations. Brunch Babes secured a spot at a brewery, while Lara also revealed she is currently pregnant with her third child, a series first. Baby Got Mac parked at a community college, and Rolling Indulgence get selling in a parking lot across [[Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park]], but both have trouble finding foot traffic. Travis, however, found another big group of people in a bridal party. NOLA Creations get a spot at a winery, and Frank-n-Slides park at the Sparkman Wharf. However, Frank-n-Slides aren't able to sell their sliders at the Wharf. Madea Made are having a tough time finding a spot, so Brunch Babes invite them over to theirs; but with people not wanting to give up their spots in line, they leave quickly to an intersection. Baby Got Mac move to a spot by a Farmer's Market of the main strip of [[Ybor City]]. Day 2 rolls in, and it starts to raining. Rolling Indulgence and Baby Got Mac team up, and Brunch Babes goes back to their original spot, only to find no one. With their original spot on the waterfront for today being a mess, Rolling Indulgence and Baby Got Mac separately begin looking for a new spot. Frank-n-Slides start selling at a bar, where they get a visit from Craig's family.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: The six teams had 30 minutes to create their twist on a [[Cuban sandwich]], a Tampa invention, and sell their dish to Tyler, Chad and the deputies; the deputy squadron will vote on the winner. The teams were also given some roasted pork to work with, courtesy of The Columbia Restaurant. The winner receives a sheriff star badge that allows them to steal $100 dollars from one team's final total at elimination and \"not get arrested\". The winner was '''Madea Made''', who chose to steal from '''Frank-n-Slides'''.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: Fresh grouper from the Gulf of Mexico was given to the teams from Big Ray's Fish Camp, and they all had to incorporate it into a dish. The team who makes the most profit off the dish wins $400 in their till. '''Frank-n-Slides''' won the challenge and the week.\n\n'''Burger Brawl (Week Five)'''\n\nTeams pulled into Florida's premiere [[alligator]] park, Gatorama. Tyler wants the teams to start taking risks, so he has provided them with gator tail and sausage to work with while prepping their menus; and for the first challenge, also have them be zookeepers for the park. With Frank-n-Slides' challenge advantage, the team start early on prepping and selling. After an hour passed, the others call up local businesses, with the Brunch Babes, Rolling Indulgence, and NOLA Creations securing spots at the same brewery. Meanwhile, Madea Made goes hardcore local by partnering with one of the top food trucks in Fort Myers. As several teams take Tyler's risky advice by cooking the gator tail and sausage, Rolling think that taking risks will risk their chances of going home. Rolling, NOLA, and the Babes get slammed with customers and fall behind on their orders. Frank-n-Slides have a moderate line at their location, and Madea Made's crowd with their partner starts to dwindle after a rush of patrons. Tyler comes aboard the trucks to see if they took risks, while letting Madea Made know that they need a better location tomorrow. Day 2: Tyler gives the teams their taste challenge for the weekend: The \"Risky Road Trip\" Burger challenge. While shopping, Hope and Faith argue, with Hope just wanting to get everything on her shopping list. All the teams later park on First Street in Downtown Fort Myers. With people beginning to flock to the trucks, NOLA Creations are unfortunately still behind on prep as orders are being taken. As several teams start driving to new locations after the lunch rush, the secret shopper for the burger challenge tastes each burger. For Madea and Rolling, and NOLA and Babes, the two pairs park at the same locations.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: One team member acts as zookeeper, and has to move an alligator from a wet enclosure to a dry one; the team with the shortest time handling their gator gets a one-hour head-start ahead of the other teams to prep and sell. The winner was '''Frank-n-Slides''' with 9.22 seconds.\n\n<u> Challenge #2</u>: Tyler had the teams create a \"Risky Road Trip\" burger to sell on their trucks. A mystery judge from Sarasota, Chef Joe DiMaggio Jr., will go under the alias \"Nick\" and try all five burgers. The burger Chef DiMaggio thinks is the riskiest and tastiest wins immunity. The winner was '''NOLA Creations'''.\n\n'''Shake Showdown (Week Six)'''\n\nThe final four meet Tyler on Lauderdale Beach where he gives them their first challenge, an on-brand skewer. After the challenge, the two pairs of trucks as a result of the challenges (NOLA Babes and Frank Indulgence), begin selling. NOLA attempts to fuse the Babes' marketing skills with their culinary training, while Rolling and Frank's similarities are what they think will help them. Frank Indulgence hit up a surf shop, while NOLA Babes both have a brewery and a mall to go to. Unfortunately, both of the NOLA Babes' spots are totally dead at first. With Frank Indulgence, they split the market with Frank-n-Slides handling burgers, and Rolling handling desserts and drinks. Both pairs move to new locations, Frank Indulgence at a crowded brewery, and NOLA Babes at the mall lot; where there are more people than there was at first. On Day 2, the teams sell separately, but like last time, NOLA, Rolling, and the Babes all park at the beach. Meanwhile, Frank-n-Slides get a spot at a mechanics' shop, but sales start slowly. The Babes and Frank's use their respective pineapple and hot dog suits to draw business, with respective successful and not-so-successful results. For the second challenge, the four teams convene at the beach, and were greeted by a call from Tyler and Senior Director of Culinary Innovation for [[Sonic Drive-In]], Mackenzie Gibson. They sent two waiters to give the teams one of the four real ice-cream milkshakes in their hands. The flavors of their milkshakes would be utilized in a dessert challenge.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: Tyler had the teams create a signature skewer in 30 minutes to define their brand. But first, he had them throw javelins at four targets (2 with Surf, 2 with Turf) to determine their protein. Brunch Babes and NOLA Creations had Surf and Frank-n-Slides and Rolling Indulgence had Turf. The winner would be free to select one team to be their business partner for the day, which includes a shared dish and splitting the combined profits 50\u201350. The winner was '''NOLA Creations''', who chose '''Brunch Babes''' as their partner, meaning '''Frank-n-Slides''' and '''Rolling Indulgence''' would team up.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: The teams set up a food truck park at the beach, charging $5 for admission, and selling a dessert inspired by the flavor of their milkshakes ('''Babes''' - ''Strawberry Cheesecake, '''Frank-N-Slides''' - ''Banana, '''NOLA''' - Caramel, '''Rolling''' - Peanut Butter). Patrons vote on their favorite dessert, and the winner had to choose between two options at elimination: Receive $200 overall or get $25 for every vote that was cast for them. The winner was '''Brunch Babes''', who chose the overall $200, which put them in first and saved them from elimination.\n\n'''Miami Meltdown (Week Seven)'''\n\nThe teams meet Tyler and Chef Jorge Alverez of the Stuffed Cuban Restaurant on the beach, standing with a whole slow-roasted crispy pig. That roasted pig will be utilized in the first challenge. Once teams got their pork, Tyler sends them shopping and selling. Rolling Indulgence park at a newly opened beer garden, NOLA Creations lock down an exclusive spot at Panther Coffee on the strip of 2nd Avenue, and a couple blocks down is Brunch Babes at Concrete Beach Winery. With NOLA having grabbed a spot that they wanted, Brunch Babes prepare a batch of doughnuts and take them to the coffee shop. NOLA and the Babes confront each other as the Babes question if NOLA actually have exclusivity, which they do. Tyler pulls up at the trucks and asks what it would mean to win ''The Great Food Truck Race''. NOLA to restart their business after [[Hurricane Katrina]], Rolling Indulgence for Drew and Jess to start their lives together, and Brunch Babes for Lara to show her children that you keep chasing your dreams. NOLA begins to party thanks to a trumpeter playing \"[[When The Saints Go Marching In]]\" as Day 1 ends. Day 2 rolls in: Rolling gets a spot at a classic car club, NOLA goes back to Panther Coffee, and Brunch Babes prep their menu, yet have no location. The Babes later call up Rolling to partner up at the car club, hoping two trucks can drum up customers to both of them. Tyler calls the teams for the second challenge, which involves coffee. While Rolling and the Babes have sweet desserts and drinks to use the beans, NOLA attempted to go savory, but problems with the grinder leaves them with the sweet route. And to get more business, Travis and Mariah borrow the club owner's golf cart to advertise the trucks. When that fails, the Babes get a spot at at the winery, while Rolling is still left with no patrons. And in the last hour with no one at the coffee shop, Anna brings 30 French-Ghanaian students to NOLA.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: To determine which team gets which part, the three tams had to build a tower with the full 56 amount of [[dominoes]] they had at their station. The team that completes their tower the fastest gets first pick of the pig. From fastest to slowest, '''NOLA Creations''' was the fastest and chose the Saddle, '''Brunch Babes''' was second and picked the Ham, and '''Rolling Indulgence''' were the slowest and were left with the Shoulder.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: The teams would use their meat in a challenge to sell the most pork dishes for $300 in their till. The team that sold the most dishes was '''Brunch Babes'''.\n\n<u>Challenge #3</u>: The teams were given [[Cuban coffee]] beans, a [[burr-grinder]], and a [[moka pot]] courtesy of Panther Coffee. The challenge ordered the teams to use coffee in one of their dishes, with the team selling the most coffee-infused plates winning another $300. '''Brunch Babes''' won the challenge and the week.\n\n'''Key Lime Clash (Week Eight)'''\n\nThe final two convene at the piers to meet Tyler and his friend, Kelly Friend, with Kelly's family and four conch shells in front of them. Tyler gives the two teams a little history about the [[Florida Keys]] and that the early natives came up with 27 ways to eat [[conch]], which was involved in the first challenge. Once done, the teams hit the stores, and seem to have trouble; NOLA Creations can't seem to find the right boiled peanut, so they were left with a peanut sauce, while the Brunch Babes have trouble complying with the high protein prices. Luckily, the butcher gives them restaurant prices. With a small city that has small streets, food truck driving is tough, but the teams pull through. NOLA lands a spot in front of a rum distillery, and the Babes get into a parking lot behind a jewelry store on Duval Street, but have trouble getting in thanks to a tree with low branches. Nonetheless, they get into the lot, and both teams start selling. However, for NOLA, Anna starts taking orders early again, but they catch up with demand. Brunch Babes has a crowd of the lot owner's friends and are selling, but it later goes quiet for a short time. As Lara works on the menu, she gets a surprise visit from her and Mariah's mother and Lydia's aunt/Godmother. The lunch rush dies down, but the finalists do what they can to draw people in; from NOLA's beads to the Babes' flips, ribbons, and pineapple suit. On Day 2, NOLA Creations decide to add an omelet to the menu as an homage to the Brunch Babes. But again, Anna brings in early orders. Tyler later approaches the trucks with friend and Miami restaurateur Michael Schwartz, and a box with four spiny lobster tails that they had to use in another challenge. NOLA feels as if they keep undermining the Brunch Babes, so now they begin to hustle it. With a dessert challenge now initiated and $1,100 in challenges on the line, the final two need to push themselves to the limit if they want to win $50,000.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: The two teams chose one of their members to blow one of the conch shells, and Kelly would judge them on three categories: Tone Quality, Creativity and Loudness. The winner would choose one challenge dish they and their opponent had sold in the past to sell as a special. '''Brunch Babes''' won and chose their ''Babes Burger'' from Fort Myers, while '''NOLA Creations''' were given the ''Blackened Chicken Sandwich w/ Boiled Peanut Vinaigrette'' from Hilton Head Island.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</U>: The two teams had to sell their \"Greatest Hits\" special that was chosen for them on Day 1 of Key West, and the team that makes the most profit from their special gets $400 in the till. The winner was '''Brunch Babes'''.\n\n<u>Challenge #3</u>: The finalists were given one hour to make them a dish with the [[spiny lobster]] tails that Tyler and Michael would taste. The dish doesn't have to go on the menu, and will be given an extra $300 in their till. The winner was '''NOLA Creations'''.\n\n<u>Challenge #4</u>: The teams were delivered the ingredients for a [[key lime pie]], courtesy of the Key West Key Lime Pie Company, and had to make a dessert with them that isn't a pie. The teams also had to make sure their dessert is worth at least $3. The team who sold the most key lime not-a-pie desserts gets another $400 added to their till. The winner was '''NOLA Creations''' by nine orders, resulting them in winning the \"Summer Beach Battle\".\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Food Truck Elimination Table\n|-\n!

With a hanger housing their food trucks, a private plane, and seven covered plates of proteins, the first challenge of the season begins. Once the challenge was over, Everyone received $400 in seed money and made their way to the grocery store. After a little Black Friday-like shopping spree, they drove to their arranged spots on [[Ocean Avenue (Santa Monica)|Ocean Ave.]] by [[Palisades Park (Santa Monica)|Palisades Park]]. As they prep, with Mystikka Masala having a one hour head-start, Tyler stops by to see how the rookies are doing. As he does, he notices the mess Bachelor Kitchen has made, lecturing them on sanitation and threatening to relieve them of their ruck if they don't treat it with respect. Day 1 gets rolling, and so does everyone. The Lunch Ladies' message, Bachelor Kitchen's samples, and Navin bringing out his drag queen persona are utilized in order to find customers. Before tomorrow comes by, Tyler gifts everyone a bottle of champagne, but not for what they think. Day 2: Everyone's on their own, finding their own spots in Los Angeles. As they work on their menu and the challenge dish, the teams start to find the struggles as food truck vendors, having a hard time finding customers. But that won't stop them from getting a rush or clientele before the first elimination\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: The seven teams have 30 minutes to make an hors d'oeuvre fit for a private jet. At the start of the challenge, teams will grab one covered plate that features the main protein ([[Sirloin steak]]).

(Week 2)'''\n\nTeams roll in to the Navy town of San Diego for the second leg of the race, convening at the Southwestern Yacht Club for their first challenge. And in the aftermath, Dooley, Carina, Crystal, and Stephan were to be pulled of their respective trucks. The teams get prepping and selling as four of them wait for their penalty to be called upon. And while most teams were able to have successful partnerships and crowds with local businesses, Crystal's eats up more time to sell as they move from spot to spot. It gets worse when Crystal and the other chosen members is pulled off near the end of the day. Tomorrow: The teams come aboard their trucks with a crate of octopus, which they will use for their next challenge. As they battle with time, for customers, for turf, the judge for the octopus challenge arrives earlier than some teams expect, especially for those who plan on cooking the mollusk for a long time. As the teams take on the lunch rush, Stephan suddenly gets a personal call, something that will affect the whole team.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: The teams must team up in pairs and have one hour to create a meal consisting of an entree, side, and signature beverage for 60 members of the club.

So thy decide to lighten the load with a simple menu. But it doesn't seem simple when John caused an accidental flare-up, due to the propane switches being left on; searing some of John's arm hair, too. Team Fat Kid find themselves in the same boat as they have to put up with modifications in their orders. The next day, after some restocking and forcibly paying with out of their income, Tyler surprises them with a call for their next challenge involving cacti (but it's technically agave). Bachelor's go back to their challenge strategy of selling the special, and the Lunch Ladies prep in an empty parking lot waiting for the promised customers their location guaranteed, and Mariah of Season 10's Brunch Babes Truck visits Team Fat Kid.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: The teams will have 9 minutes to create an elegant, signature salad that they will make on a tramcar of the [[Palm Springs Aerial Tramway]] to the top of the mountain.

Every week they start off with no food to make things fair for all the teams who must make do with whatever cash Tyler Florence provides (seed money) at the start of each episode, in each new city. The trucks all convene in [[Los Angeles]].\n\n===Truck Teams===\n{{Great Food Truck Race Labelled Map 1|float=right}}\n\n'''Grill 'Em All''' \u2013 A [[Los Angeles]] food truck with a theme inspired by Metallica's album ''Kill 'Em All''. The three heavy metal enthusiasts, Ryan, Matt and Joel cook gourmet hamburgers with names like \"the hatchet\" (with sausage gravy and maple syrup) and \"the behemoth\" (with cheese sandwiches for buns).\n\n'''Nana Queens''' \u2013 Sisters Janel and Shanel, along with their friend Rick, representing [[Compton, California]] and dishing up hot wings and banana pudding. They even have a banana costume to promote their signature dish.\n\n'''Ragin' Cajun''' \u2013 Generations of old family recipes are used to serve authentic Cajun food. The team is made up of [[Lafayette, Louisiana]] natives Stephen, Joey and Jazmin, with Stephen playing up his crazy, outlandish personality to bring in customers.\n\n'''Austin Daily Press''' \u2013 A food truck from [[Austin, Texas]] led by Cory, his business partner Amy, and his girlfriend Melani. They started their business with the idea to tap into the less serviced market for late night delivery. They serve hot, pressed sandwiches.\n\n'''Crepes Bonaparte''' \u2013 Coming from [[Fullerton, California]], this team is headed by engaged couple, Christian and Danielle as well as their best friend, Matt. This truck serves sweet and savory Parisian-style crepes.\n\n'''Nom Nom Truck''' \u2013 The second Los Angeles food truck and specializes in Vietnamese b\u00e1nh mi sandwiches. The trio consisted of UCLA business graduates Misa, Jennifer, and David. Their plan was to partner up with local businesses in every city.\n\n'''Spencer on the Go''' \u2013 A [[San Francisco]] food truck led by chefs Laurent, John, and Jesse. Their aim is to serve high-end, French cuisine, going so far as to set up a folding table so patrons can enjoy a sit-down dining experience.\n\n===Episodes===\n'''Let's Get Rolling (Week 1)'''\n\nThe established trucks began the first ever race in Los Angeles and they were given $500 to buy their ingredients before being sent to San Diego to sell their food over the weekend. This was meant to level the playing field because some of the food trucks were already from Los Angeles and had a loyal customer base. Most of the teams faced a slow first day; propane issues doubly affected Nana Queens. Both Nana Queens and Ragin' Cajun paid fees to get into a festival, with Nana Queens paying for the full two days and Ragin Cajun only finding out about the festival, and getting in, on the second day.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The \"Truck Stop\" is a challenge described by Tyler as a twist to keep things interesting that will make them \"stop what [they're] doing and take a new direction\". There were no unusual challenges or hurdles beyond moving to a new, unfamiliar location. Since they made the most profit at the end of the episode, the technical winner is: '''Nom Nom Truck'''\n\n'''Chile Santa Fe (Week 2)'''\n\nThe truck teams had to consider changing their menus when they reached Santa Fe during a light snowfall. They were given $300 seed money. Spencer on the Go suffered from engine trouble that delayed them in buying their ingredients and making sales in the first day. Grill Em All opted to pair up with Austin Daily Press, thinking two trucks would be more eye-catching than one.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: On the beginning of the second day, Tyler called all the trucks for their first official truck stop challenge. The teams had to make and sell a new dish with chili peppers. A Santa Fe chef, Eric Distefano, went around undercover to taste all the chili pepper specials and pick the best one. The Nom Nom Truck opted not to do the challenge. Winner received immunity from elimination. Winner was '''Spencer on the Go'''.\n\n'''Truckin' To Texas (Week 3)'''\n\nThe trucks faced a drastic temperature change, where last week there was snow, this week they faced the Texas sun. They received $400 in seed money. Despite having the most expensive menu, Spencer on the Go has been calling up local French restaurants in every city to get wholesale prices. Nom Nom Truck's strategy of partnering up with local business was also helping them out. The Austin Daily Press set up on a little league baseball field and donated 15% of their profits (>$200) to the little league.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: A quarter cow was delivered to all the teams who had to butcher it and make a new dish with it. A Fort Worth chef, Tim Love, went undercover to sample each food-truck beef special, and select the best one. Winner received a Texan Rodeo Buckle, which represented $1,000 that was added towards their final tally. Winner was '''Grill 'Em All'''.\n\n'''Big Trouble In The Big Easy (Week 4)'''\n\nAll the teams planned to streamline and adapt their menus to suit the local tastes. They received $400 seed money and an extra 24 hours to do late night sales at New Orleans, one of the biggest cities for night life and partying. Once again, Austin Daily Press and Grill Em All teamed up. Spencer on the Go waited so long for a restaurant owner, to get wholesale groceries, that they didn't get a chance to make sales on the first day. A torrential storm on the second day slowed down sales for many of the trucks, and generator troubles affected Austin Daily Press. Partway into Day 2's late-night sales, they were told by Tyler to close up because their Truck Stop challenge would be in the early morning.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: At the docks, each team was given 30 minutes to fillet a catfish and create a dish from it. A local chef, Jacques Leonardi, tasted and selected the best dish that would win $500 toward their final tally. For the first time, the losing chefs got a punishment; they had to work together to fillet 700 lbs of catfish before they were allowed to start selling again. Winner was '''Spencer on the Go'''.\n\n'''Small Town Trouble (Week 5)'''\n\nWith a population of only 5,000, this was the smallest town in this season's race, and all three trucks had to sell in one downtown spot. They were given $400 seed money and an extra 24 hours to sell but unlike the night crowds of other large cities, the townspeople of Jonesborough didn't stay out after 8pm.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: At a rustic farm, the teams had two hours to create a \"five-course\" meal (bread, beans, potatoes, meat, and dessert) using frontier-era cooking utensils and supplies. Two experienced chuckwagoners tasted and judged who created the best overall meal. The winner received a spot at a nearby auto show and access to thousands of potential customers. Winner was '''Grill 'Em All'''.\n\n'''New York Plate of Mind (Week 6)'''\n\nThe final two trucks arrived in Lower Manhattan, with Grill Em All essentially being supported by previously eliminated Spencer on the Go who gave the burger boys a chef's jacket and the name of a restaurant wholesaler. The two trucks got $500 seed money and were given special instructions: they had to sell $500 in each of the five New York City boroughs, unable to move to the next borough until they hit the 500 limit in each (first the [[Bronx]], then [[Queens]], [[Brooklyn]], [[Staten Island]] and finally [[Manhattan]] where the sales needed were doubled to $1,000). The first team to finish their necessary sales in all five boroughs would race to the top of the [[Flatiron Building]] to win $50,000. The Nom Nom Truck did slow sales, lagging behind Grill Em All, until they won the truck stop, allowing them to skip Staten Island and catch up to the other team in Manhattan.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: Tyler called the teams late into day 2 and told them to stop selling, and get some sleep so they'd be ready for their final challenge in the morning at Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn (at that point, Grill Em All was ahead in Manhattan while Nom Nom Truck was just getting into Staten Island). They had an hour to prepare the opposing team's signature dish for judge Chef Nate Appleman. The winners got a $500 bonus, meaning they could skip one of the boroughs. Winner was '''Nom Nom Truck'''.\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Food Truck Elimination Table\n|-\n! ''Truck''\n!

They all met in Malibu, California, but were immediately sent to Las Vegas, Nevada, to officially start the race. The ''Truck Stops'' are outlined as little competitions to offer an advantage and ''Speed Bumps'' are introduced as twists meant to provide a disadvantage and force the teams to think on their feet. The grand prize was raised to $100,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodnetwork.com/fn-dish/shows/2011/08/tyler-florence-dishes-on-the-new-season-of-food-trucks|title=Tyler Florence Dishes on the New Season of The Great Food Truck Race}}</ref> for this season only.\n\n===Truck Teams===\n{{Great Food Truck Race Labelled Map 2|float=right}}\n\n'''Roxy's Grilled Cheese''' \u2013 A [[Boston]] food truck run by brothers James and Mike, along with experienced Chef Marc. They aim to bring upscale versions of grilled cheese by using high-end cheeses, confit vegetables and local breads.\n\n'''Seabirds''' \u2013 Representing [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], this all-woman, all-vegan truck is run by friends Stephanie, Raya, and Nicole. They plan to bring Cali freshness to the country in the form of beer battered avocado tacos and BBQ jackfruit sandwiches.\n\n'''Hodge Podge''' \u2013 Hailing from [[Cleveland]], this truck is led by Chef Chris along with his sister Catie and his girlfriend Jacquelyn. Their food is a self-professed \"hodge podge\" with ingredients thrown together to make tasty dishes.\n\n'''The Lime Truck''' \u2013 The second Orange Country truck, it's manned by Jason, Daniel, and Jesse. They take a less-organized approach to menu building with different dishes for every stop. As long as it's fresh and delicious, they aim to make it.\n\n'''Sky's Gourmet Tacos''' \u2013 a food truck from Los Angeles that serves Mexican/soul fusion cuisine. The truck is operated by Chef Barbara, her son Victor, and their friend Kevin.\n\n'''Cafe Con Leche''' \u2013 Operated by lifelong friends Gabriel, Maria, and Frankie, this truck from [[Van Nuys, California]] is dedicated to serving authentic Cuban cuisine and coffee.\n\n'''Devilicious''' \u2013 A [[San Diego]] truck that's run by engaged couple Dyann and Mark, along with their friend Kristina. They specialize in over the top, twisted comfort food served with a \"devilish\" attitude.\n\n'''[[Korilla BBQ]]''' \u2013 Coming all the way from [[New York City]], Eddie, Paul, and Steve were Columbia graduates who turned to their Korean roots when they couldn't find jobs in their chosen field. They dish out tacos and burritos with modern Korean tastes.\n\n===Episodes===\n'''What Happens In Vegas (Week 1)'''\n\nThe food trucks all convened at the Malibu Pier before being directed to go northeast to Las Vegas, Nevada. They got $500 seed money. The Lime Truck partnered up with a local Vegas food truck they knew, and invited the Seabirds truck into the partnership. Korilla also called a friend who owned a food truck in Vegas to partner up. Sky's Gourmet Tacos blew out a tire on the way to Vegas, costing them time and money ($185) to fix, as well as an exclusive appearance at a festival. Roxy's Grilled Cheese clashed with The Lime Truck when they ended up at the same lot.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: There was no truck stop in this episode. Instead the \"Speed Bump\" was introduced. It's a challenge that required all the teams to handle a sudden, unpleasant twist in a creative way.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: In honor of Las Vegas, Tyler spun a wheel of different problems that would hinder their truck (including \"two flat tires\", and \"one man down\"). The wheel landed on \"out of propane\" which meant all the trucks had to stop using propane with six hours of the day left. They could sell cold food, raw food, or find another way to cook (like butane burners or electric griddles).\n\n'''A Pinch Of Salt Lake City (Week 2)'''\n\nAs soon as everyone arrived in Salt Lake City, they were given $100 seed money and their first truck stop challenge. All the trucks had to simplify their menus because of the small budget, some opting not to buy meat. The first day, Cafe Con Leche ended up booking a catering gig through the city's Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. Roxy's partnered up with a local food truck serving out of a large parking lot but was soon sent away by the property manager. Lime Truck opted to go vegetarian and went behind Seabird's back to sign an exclusive deal at a pet event. The second day brought varying degrees of success for all the trucks, with their customers following them when they had to move due to the speed bump.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The food trucks had to make their own sausages by hand at a special sausage facility, then drive back 12 miles to pick five ingredients from a basic pantry table, meaning the last truck to arrive would get slim pickings. Local Chef Ryan Lowder picked the best dish, which would earn extra $100 (doubling their seed money). Korilla opted not to do the challenge but keep the meat to supplement their meager seed money. The Seabirds opted not to go to the sausage factory because they were vegan, so they were the first to pick ingredients off the table. Winner was '''Hodge Podge'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: The trucks were required to relocate at least one mile away from their current location. Since Hodge Podge won the truck stop, they didn't have to move.\n\n'''Rocky Mountain Highs And Lows (Week 3)'''\n\n[[Robin Roberts (newscaster)|Robin Roberts]] of ''Good Morning America'' was there to greet the trucks and help present part of the prize for the truck stop cooking challenge which was done as soon as they arrived. With only the truck stop winners getting seed money, the other trucks had to buy their groceries on credit. A partnership came about when Hodge Podge offered their location connections in exchange for Lime Truck promoting them on their TV spot. Cafe Con Leche had the fewest customers and got overcharged by a Cuban restaurant they partnered with.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The teams had to forage for wild mushrooms in the mountains outside Denver and create a dish featuring the local mushrooms, with a box of pantry staples provided by Tyler. Local Chef Frank Bonnano picked the winning truck, who would do an exclusive interview with the local ABC news affiliate to promote their truck, and get $200 of seed money. The remaining trucks received no seed money. Winner was '''The Lime Truck'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: On day 2, the trucks received a call from Tyler and [[John Elway]] who told them the trucks could only be handled by one member of the team.\n\n'''Big Bites, Little Apple (Week 4)'''\n\nThe college town of Manhattan, Kansas meant a more modest, low-priced menu for heartland Americans. Even so, the teams got a generous $400 seed money. On the first day, Hodge Podge, Lime Truck, and Korilla ended up in the city park, while Roxy's parked near a smaller college. Word traveled fast and all the trucks got huge crowds. Seabirds had a very slow start leaving many customers waiting. The Lime Truck started with an upscale menu but after the speed bump, had to close down and buy ingredients to make cheaper dishes.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The trucks were given a $5 debit card to buy what they could at a nearby market and make a dish. Kansas City food critic Charles Ferruzza would be judging. The winning truck would be the only team allowed to park in Aggieville, a popular restaurant area near the university campus. Winner was '''Seabirds'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: The trucks were required to sell everything on their menus for less than $1.00 (a challenge they got on Saturday instead of the usual Sunday).\n\n'''Hog Wild In Memphis (Week 5)'''\n\nOnce everyone arrived at the Memphis Court Square, as in previous episodes, they had to do a truck stop challenge. They got $500 seed money. Independent of the official 'Speed Bump' and 'Truck Stop', Tyler sent a local food blogger, \"The Chubby Vegetarian\", around to sample their dishes. The best dish was granted immunity, which was The Lime Truck. Korilla, Hodge Podge, and the Lime Truck had many ups and downs, in terms of customers. Towards the end of the second day, the power gave out in Hodge Podge's truck. In the end, Tyler disqualified Korilla BBQ for putting $2700 of their own money in the till; had they not cheated, they would've moved on with the third highest sales and Hodge Podge would've gone home.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The teams had three hours to butcher and prepare a 100-pound pig, and prepare a barbecue sauce to go with it. They were judged by Jim Neely, well known in the Memphis BBQ circuit. The winning truck earned an additional $500, doubling their seed money and they could go sell right away, while the losing teams had to butcher the remainder of the pigs (including the winning truck's pig) to donate to a local food bank. Winner was '''Roxy's Grilled Cheese'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: Partway into their first day, the trucks were told they couldn't serve anymore meat and had to remake their menus into vegetarian ones.\n\n'''Midnight Truck To Georgia (Week 6)'''\n\nThe trucks pulled into the Centennial Olympic Park and received $500 seed money before being sent out to get started on their truck stop cooking challenge. Hodge Podge had a strong first day thanks to getting exclusive access at Atlantic Station mall while Lime Truck and Roxy's picked poor locations with little foot traffic. Lime Truck managed to get the mall location on the second day, making up for some lost sales the first day; the only truck that didn't get the mall rush was Roxy's Grilled Cheese.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The trucks had one hour to find the nearest place to buy peaches and peanuts, then run back to create a dish using mystery ingredients from 1 of 3 baskets. The peach retrieval had mixed results with Roxy's buying fresh peaches, Lime Truck only able to find dried peaches, and Hodge Podge having to settle on a free peach cobbler before time ran out. A local chef, Kevin Rathbun, judged who best used the peanuts and peaches and the winning team received $1,000 (and a large golden peach). The winner was '''Roxy's Grilled Cheese'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: The lead chefs on each truck were removed (and sent to enjoy a day at the [[High Museum of Art|High Museum]]), while the two remaining teammates had to operate the truck. With approximately 45 minutes left of selling in day 2, the chefs were allowed to return.\n\n'''Miami Heat (Week 7)'''\n\nThe final two arrived at Watson Island to learn their goal was to reach $15,000 profit before rushing to [[South Pointe Park]]; first team there wins the grand prize. To start, they got $500 seed money. Hodge Podge was able to get product from an old boss of his while Lime Truck didn't get a chance to call their usual contacts, expecting a truck stop to delay them, so they just shopped at a big box store. Hodge Podge ended up at a car lot with other local food trucks. Midway into day 1, they got their first speed bump, disabling use of their trucks so Lime Truck cooked mussels on a portable burner and Hodge Podge sold high end sashimi with foie gras. Tyler put a stop to Day 1's late night sales because their truck stop was going to be in the morning. Then he shut them down again during the evening of Day 2 for the second speed bump.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The teams had to venture out 5 miles into the Atlantic Ocean by boat and go fishing. They had 30 minutes to catch a fish and 30 minutes to prepare it. Local chef Michael Schwartz judged their dishes and the winning truck received $1,500 towards their till. Winner was '''The Lime Truck'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump #1</u>: The teams had 5 minutes to grab whatever they needed off their trucks before they were towed. To get their trucks back, they needed to make $200 from the food they grabbed. Hodge Podge was first to hit their target with Lime Truck catching up a little later.\n\n<u>Speed Bump #2</u>: The teams were required to shut down for the latter part of Day 2. Then for the first two hours of day 3, the trucks only sold desserts.\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Food Truck Elimination Table\n|-\n! ''Truck''\n!

They come all the way from [[Wasilla, Alaska]] to serve homestyle comfort food.\n\n'''Pop-A-Waffle''' \u2013 Friends Bobaloo and Scott, with no kitchen experience, brought in chef Anthony to help realize their dream of making their own gourmet waffles. They're from [[Los Angeles]] and they're excited to work for themselves.\n\n'''Barbie Babes''' \u2013 This is the second all-female team made up of Hayley, Jasmin, and Skye. The three friends moved from [[Australia]] to Los Angeles and started a catering company to make ends meet. They developed a love for cooking and they want to bring Australian barbecue all across the states.\n\n'''Under the Crust''' \u2013 The theme of this team is sweet and savory pies. Chef Hannah, her mother Sheri, and her friend Gary, have experience selling pies at farmer's markets in [[San Diego]]. Hannah wanted to start a food truck with her fianc\u00e9 Keith but lost him to cancer.\n\n'''Coast of Atlanta''' \u2013 Hailing from [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], this is an all-chef team made up of Lena, her boyfriend Mike, and their friend Tawanaca. They want to leave the restaurant world to work for themselves with their southern style seafood dishes like shrimp & grits and fried catfish.\n\n'''Seoul Sausage''' \u2013 This is the third Los Angeles team, made up of brothers Ted and Yong with their friend Chris. They have experience and a following from selling their sausages at events but want their own truck to regularly serve their Korean-style sausages and kimchi-fried rice balls.\n\n'''Nonna's Kitchenette''' \u2013 Jaclyn, Lisa, and Jessica are best friends from [[Parsippany, New Jersey]] and the third all-female team of the race. Their plan is to make traditional Italian food using recipes passed down from their grandmothers, including meatball subs and pizzelle ice cream sandwiches.\n\n===Episodes===\n'''3,559 Miles to a Dream (Week 1)'''\n\nThe teams all met at Long Beach, California to get their first look at the food trucks they will be using for the race. However, the new trucks are bare and they had to stock it with not just food but cookware, utensils, and sanitary equipment (as mandated by the health department). They received $1500 seed money to fully stock their truck, then they had to go to Los Angeles to sell. Pop-A-Waffle teamed up with Barbie Babes who took so long to shop that they used their first day just to prep. Under the Crust didn't find a good parking location in the first day so they had no sales. After Under the Crust's elimination, Tyler announced that Food Network would donate $5,000 to the [[American Cancer Society]] in honor of Hannah's deceased fianc\u00e9, Keith.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: There was no cooking challenge for the amateur food-truck owners in their first weekend. They had enough to do trying to figure out how to maneuver their trucks.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: With six hours left in the second day, the teams had to relocate to Hollywood Boulevard to compete against each other in a sell-off.\n\n'''Attitude at High Altitude (Week 2)'''\n\nOn the way to northern Arizona, Momma's Grizzly Grub called up Nonna's Kitchenette and Seoul Sausage to propose a team up. The teams were advised to look over their menu and selling strategies because every city is different. They were given $400 seed money. Momma Grizzly's partnership worked well as Lisa from Nonna Kitchenette knew someone who lived in Flagstaff and allowed them to set up three spots downtown, attracting a huge crowd. Pizza Mike's stumbled onto the trucks and set up nearby, as did Barbie Babes later on, who priced their food too low the first day and adjusted for the second day's sales but were hampered by a slow shop and a bad spot. When Mamma Grizzly's sold out and closed early, Barbie Babes took their parking spot.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: Their first cooking challenge came halfway into the first day of selling. It required them to make a dish out of cactus and put it on their menu to be judged by local chef, [[Beau MacMillan]]. The winner got immunity. Winner was '''Pop-A-Waffle'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: At the beginning of the second day, the trucks were required to serve only vegan food.\n\n'''Even Food Trucks Are Bigger In Texas (Week 3)'''\n\nThe trucks arrived at a baseball stadium in Amarillo which set the theme for the weekend. After getting $500 in seed money, they were told to shop and return to the stadium lot to compete head to head for the baseball crowds. They also got a chance to promote their truck during the seventh inning stretch. In the midst of preparing for their chosen ballpark customers, they got a truck stop. Pizza Mike didn't buy enough product for the ballgame and sold out early. On the second day Momma's Grizzly, Pop-A-Waffle, Seoul Sausage, and Coast of Atlanta all ended up at a large grocery store parking lot. Nonna's Kitchenette got steady business at a hardware store, and thanks to this week's speed bump Pizza Mike's got stuck at a park they only meant to serve until 5pm. Seoul Sausage was the only truck who could leave and opted to go back to the baseball stadium after serving the lunch rush at the grocery store.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The teams had to include a ballpark special, a food that could be found in any stadium. They were judged by stadium concessionaire, John Ciarrachi. The winning team earned $500 and a mysterious key which ended up being useful for the Speed Bump. Winner was '''Seoul Sausage'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: On day 2, everyone had boots put on their trucks and were immobilized for the whole day. (Except Seoul Sausage who won a key in the truck stop that unlocked the boot, and allowed them to leave their spot when the crowds died down.)\n\n'''Baby Got Razorback (Week 4)'''\n\nAnother stadium was the destination for the trucks this week. They got $300 seed money and were advised that the Arkansas college town meant lower pricing and a more streamlined menu was necessary. The trucks were told to close early on day 1 for an early morning truck stop challenge. They were again told to close early on day 2 for a speed bump challenge. Nonna's Kitchenette, Seoul Sausage, and Pop-A-Waffle managed to secure the only three spots at a farmer's market so Coast of Atlanta and Momma's Grizzly parked nearby. Momma's Grizzly accidentally knocked over a street lamp and had to pay a $250 penalty.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: In the morning of day 2, the teams had to create a breakfast dish that included a secret ingredient, [[Pop-Tarts]], to be judged by teen chef, Jeremy Salamon. They all got strawberry and a second flavor, different for each truck. The winner received a token that was worth $750. Winner was '''Nonna's Kitchenette'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: On day 2, the teams had to close their doors after serving breakfast, and reopen at 1:00 am that night for the college-bar crowd. They would continue making sales until sunrise.\n\n'''Music City Madness (Week 5)'''\n\nThe trucks rolled into Pottsville, Tennessee and finally got a truck stop challenge upon arrival. They were given $300 seed money. Three trucks had moderate customer turnout; the fourth, Pop-A-Waffle, had tons of customers after winning their truck stop. On the second day, Nonna's Kitchenette accidentally backed into a car with their truck and was penalized $250. Momma Grizzly's joined Pop-A-Waffle later in the day but business continued to be slow for most of the trucks.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The trucks had to create a picnic basket, featuring their takes on classic Southern dishes. The winner earned $1,000 toward their till and the exclusive rights to serve 1,500 people at an event hosted by [[Joey + Rory]]. Winner was '''Pop-A-Waffle'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: On the second day, two members of each truck had to sit out, leaving behind the head chef. Two culinary students replaced the two team members and the chefs had to train them on the menu.\n\n'''Mistake By The Lake? (Week 6)'''\n\nAfter arriving at Voinovich Park in Cleveland, the teams got $100 in seed money and an assignment: buy three local Ohio tomatoes for a truck stop. Later in the day, Seoul Sausage and Nonna's Kitchenette partnered up with local businesses to recoup their losses from being shut down for three hours. Near the end of day 2, Pop-A-Waffle got a tip on serving concert-goers but they got stuck in traffic and missed any sort of crowd by the time they arrived. At the end of this episode, Tyler proclaimed they would continue on to the finale and gave them their seed money, $500, and instructions to start selling as soon as they get into the next town.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The teams had to make a simple dish featuring a previously purchased Ohio-grown beefsteak tomato, judged by [[Outback Steakhouse]] founder, Tim Gannon. The winner got $250 added to their till, and got to sell for three hours, while the other teams had to shut down their trucks during those hours. Winner was '''Pop-A-Waffle'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: On the second day, the teams had to take what they could out of their trucks before closing them down and selling on foot from a hot dog cart until 6:00 PM.\n\n'''Where In The World is Lubec? (Week 7)'''\n\nThe final two set out to conquer three cities across two states in the finale that started at the end of the previous episode. They started in Boston with large crowds but late into the day, they got a truck stop. The winner of the truck stop was announced early on day 2 and got a headstart on moving to the second city: Portland, Maine. Seoul Sausage followed and parked beside Nonna's Kitchenette on day 2 and day 3, serving up tons of people and earning almost the same amount of money from people who wanted to try both trucks' food. At the end of day 3, they were directed to drive to the little town of Lubec, Maine with a population of 1,600 people. The race ended on day 4 at [[West Quoddy Head Lighthouse]] where the team with the highest sales were given $50,000 and the keys to their food truck.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: Three fresh lobsters were delivered to both trucks and the teams had to make a New England style dish featuring the lobster. The dishes would be judged by two local fishermen, Christian Rodolosi and Clark Sandler. The winner got $500 added to their till, and got to move on to the next city, while the losing team had to shuck six bushels (600 pounds) of clams. Winner was '''Nonna's Kitchenette'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: An unofficial \"speed bump\" was given to the teams when they were on their way to Lubec. They had to sell everything for $2 or less.\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Food Truck Elimination Table\n|-\n! ''Truck''\n!

This season reinforced the \"race\" part of the title by awarding varying amounts of monetary bonuses counted towards their tally for winning the challenges. That means that in each episode, the team who finished a special \"Truck Stop\" challenge goal the fastest, and drove to a preset destination, would get \"first place\" (and there would be \"second place\" and sometimes even \"third place\" bonuses worth less). Food Network designed each team's truck based on their proposed concept. The winning team earned $50,000 and got to keep their truck.\n\n===Truck Teams===\n'''Boardwalk Breakfast Empire''' \u2013 This truck from [[Sea Bright, New Jersey]] serves breakfast comfort food. Joanne had experience working at her family's coastal cafe for years until Hurricane Sandy destroyed the restaurant. Unable to raise enough funds to rebuild, she recruited her friends Tim and Ilene to help her win her own food truck.\n\n'''Bowled and Beautiful''' \u2013 A [[Los Angeles]] team that creates California style bowls. Heather, Jessica and Liza are three single moms who met in culinary school and want to have their own business for their children. They serve up couscous, rice, and even nachos in bowls with various toppings.\n\n'''The Frankfoota Truck''' \u2013 Led by enthusiastic friends Mirlinda, Dana and Victoria, and representing [[Brooklyn]], this truck is focused on one thing: hot dogs \u2012 and the many, different toppings that can be put on their childhood favorite food.\n\n'''Aloha Plate''' \u2013 Brothers Adam and Lanai are joined by their friend Shawn. They grew up in [[Lanai, Hawaii]] and Adam was sent to culinary school thanks to a man he saved from drowning. The three have left the islands to serve authentic Hawaiian dishes to the mainland.\n\n'''Murphy's Spud Truck''' \u2013 Culinary student Nicole, her mother Suellen, and her brother James are from Los Angeles; making them the second LA team. After graduating culinary school, Nicole got seriously ill. She hopes her specialty stuffed potato truck is her ticket to achieving her culinary dreams after her brief medical setback.\n\n'''Philly's Finest Sambonis''' \u2013 Straight out of [[Philadelphia]], childhood friends Erik, Joe, and Chris serve authentic Philly cheesesteaks and sandwiches known as sambonis. Erik used to work as an electrician before a car accident caused nerve damage and left him unable to go back to that trade.\n\n'''The Slide Show''' \u2013 The third Los Angeles team of the season features trained chefs Das, Ahren and Mo. Das appeared on [[The Next Food Network Star (season 6)|Food Network Star]] and even opened his own restaurant but his business partner double crossed him. Now he's ready to get back in the game with gourmet sliders and fries.\n\n'''Tikka Tikka Taco''' \u2013 Brothers Michael and Shaun have brought their Uncle Sam, from [[St. Louis]] to travel across the country and bring modern Indian street food to the masses. Their signature dish is their tikka marinated chicken tacos.\n\n===Episodes===\n'''I Left My Food Cart in San Francisco (Week 1)'''\n\nThe Hollywood sign overlooks the park where eight teams set eyes on the food truck of their dreams. Unlike last season, they had kitchen equipment. After being given $250 seed money, they were instructed to go to Beverly Hills where they had to make and sell one signature dish for no less than $20. On the second day, the trucks were sent to San Francisco (in a certain order thanks to a Speed Bump). They couldn't make the same dish they sold in Beverly Hills and they sold side by side at SOMA StrEat Food Park. Murphy's Spud Truck initially couldn't get their propane working, which meant they couldn't cook their potatoes so they were forced to make inexpensive salads.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: There was no cooking challenge for the food-truck novices in the first week.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: Early evening of day 1 had the trucks stop selling in Beverly Hills. They had to move to San Francisco early morning of day 2, but they would leave in 15 minute increments based on how much money they earned in Beverly Hills. '''Bowled and Beautiful''' made the most and left first, while ''The Frankfoota Truck'' made the least and left last (1 hour and 45 minutes after the first truck).\n\n'''A Strange Brew in Portland (Week 2)'''\n\nEveryone arrived in northern Oregon and learned that they would have to partner up with local businesses with private lots because they weren't allowed to park on city streets. They received $350 seed money. Rainy weather on the first day affected most of the trucks by limiting foot traffic. After the speed bump was announced, all the trucks raised their prices to stretch the food they got. Frankfoota, Tikka Taco, and Philly's Finest ran out of food before the second day. Everyone was able to restock mid-way into the second day and they got a Truck Stop challenge that had them changing their menu (they could only sell dishes with geoduck in it) and their prices (their dishes  had to be $10 or less). The Franfoota truck got a $60 ticket on their car.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The teams got 6 pounds of local geoduck and had to sell $200 worth (bumped up from an initial $100 goal). Once the $200 threshold was met, the teams had to race to [[Council Crest Park]] to find a token. The first team to retrieve the token won $500 towards their till. If they couldn't hit the $100 mark by 7 pm, they had to shut down for the night. Winner was '''Bowled and Beautiful'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: After their first day shop, the trucks could not restock until Tyler called them and told them so, which didn't happen until around 2:30 pm of the second day. This affected some trucks who planned to shop light with the intention of buying more food if they ran out.\n\n'''Pocatello Is All About Potatoes, You Dig? (Week 3)'''\n\nSince Idaho is known for its potatoes, the teams were told to meet at a potato farm that would prove to be important for later. They got $300 seed money and were sent into Pocatello to start selling. On day 1, Tikka Taco partnered up with Philly's Finest to sell at a farmer's market. They were joined by Bowled and Beautiful and Slide Show. Before any food got served, they got a Speed Bump that forced them to change their menu. Frankfoota joined Aloha Plate at a location that ended up being outside the city limits, so both trucks got penalized $50 for every hour they sold outside of Pocatello. On the day 2, the Philly's Finest truck hit a hanging sign and they had to pay a $500 deductible.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: On the second day, the teams were sent to the farm they visited when they first arrived, and they had to dig up their own potatoes to sell on their truck. After selling $750 worth of potato dishes, they had to race to the City Creek Trailhead for the chance to win one of three tokens that will add to their till; one large token worth $500, one medium token worth $250, and one small token worth $50. ''Winner'' was '''Bowled and Beautiful''', ''1st Runner Up'' was ''Aloha Plate'', ''2nd Runner Up'' was '''Philly's Finest Sambonis'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: Early on in the first day, the teams were ordered to remove all items containing starch (including bread, potatoes, and pasta) from their trucks and donate them.\n\n'''About Face in South Dakota (Week 4)'''\n\nThe teams gathered at the base of the [[Crazy Horse Memorial]] where they received $50 seed money. They were sent to Rapid City and had to shop wisely because they got a Speed Bump right away. All trucks stationed themselves close to a store to replenish their stock and cut down on travel time, with some teams running and others hitching a ride from customers. Philly's Finest got into an argument on day 2 that was kickstarted by half their bread order being frozen. Aloha Truck has been using their \"coconut wireless\" Hawaiian connections to secure parking spots and bring in Hawaiian transplants to support them.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: On day 2, the teams had to go to the Wild Idea Buffalo Company one by one in 15 minutes increments based on how much money they made on day 1 (most money earned went first). There, they spent 15 minutes butchering their own quarter rack of buffalo. Aloha Plate was the first team to go and Philly's Finest Sambonis was last. After selling $1,500 of worth of buffalo dishes (with a $10 limit on each dish), the teams raced to Vista Point for the chance to win one of the three tokens to add to their till: one large token worth $750, one medium token worth $500, and one small token worth $250. ''Winner'' was Aloha Plate, ''1st Runner Up'' was '''Tikka Tikka Taco''', and ''2nd Runner Up'' was '''The Slide Show'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: While the teams shopped, their cars got towed. Since only two people were allowed to safely ride in the truck, they had to figure out how the third person would be traveling when they had to move to their selling location and back to the grocery store to restock. At the end of the first day, each team had $100 taken out of their till to get their car back.\n\n'''Double Trouble in the Twin Cities (Week 5)'''\n\nOnce again, the teams will be selling their food in two different locations; Minnesota's twin cities. They got $400 seed money and were sent to Minneapolis first. Philly's Finest accidentally ordered bread from two branches of the same market and had to pay $120 for the extra bread ordered and wasted. They were sent to St Paul on the second day but heavy rain hampered sales for all the trucks except for Aloha Plate who continue to get the word out to Hawaiian customers in every city they visit. Philly's Finest also had troubles on day 2 in the form of truck engine trouble but eventually someone with jumper cables helped them out.\n\n<u>Truck Stop #1</u>: On day 1, the teams had to serve all of their food on a stick, and sell $1,500 worth of it by 8PM. After hitting their goal, they had to race to [[Stone Arch Bridge (Minneapolis)|Stone Arch Bridge]] to grab one of the two tokens to add to their till: one large token worth $750 and one small token worth $250. However, no team completed the challenge.\n\n<u>Truck Stop #2</u>: On day 2, the teams had to create a special dish on their menu out of [[Spam (food)|Spam]]. After selling $500 worth of food with their Spam menus, the teams had to race to the Peace Officers Memorial at the [[Minnesota State Capitol]]. The first team to arrive would win immunity and the other teams that completed the challenge by 8:30 pm would win $500 toward their till. ''Immunity Winner'' was '''Aloha Plate''', '''$500 Winners''' were '''Tikka Tikka Taco''' and '''Philly's Finest Sambonis'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: The teams were required to move from Minneapolis to Saint Paul.\n\n'''A Food Truck Kind of Town, Chicago Is (Week 6)'''\n\nThe trucks pulled into Grant Park to cook in a Truck Stop challenge. After that, they got a Speed Bump that would stick with them for the rest of the race. They got $500 seed money and were told that the finale had technically already started. Philly's Finest went out of their way to secure authentic rolls and when they drove back to find a selling spot, they were stuck in traffic, putting them behind. On day 2, they got their second Truck Stop. Tikka Taco got a parking ticket and Philly's Finest drove around without finding a decent location the whole day. Only Tikka Taco completed the second truck stop in time. There was no elimination this week and for the first time, three trucks headed into the finale.\n\n<u>Truck Stop #1</u>: The teams had to create their own deep dish Chicago-style pizza using a portable wood-fired oven to be judged by Chicago Mayor [[Rahm Emanuel]]. The winning team got a proclamation from the Mayor and earned $1,000 toward their till. Winner was '''Tikka Tikka Taco'''.\n\n<u>Truck Stop #2</u>: A sixth item had to be added to every truck's menu: a Chicago-style hot beef Polish sausage sandwich for $7 each. They had until 3:00 pm to sell 300 sausage sandwiches, then race to [[Mike Ditka]]'s restaurant. The first team to arrive got signed footballs from Mike Ditka and a five-hour head start to the next city: Annapolis, Maryland. The losing trucks spent the five hours washing dishes at the restaurant. Winner was '''Tikka Tikka Taco'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: At the beginning of day 1, the teams were required to have a minimum of five dishes on their menu for the rest of the race.\n\n'''Capital Gains (Week 7)'''\n\nContinuing from the last episode, there were three teams headed for Maryland, with Tikka Taco having five-hour headstart. Philly's Finest got their friends and family to drive out and support them while Aloha Plate continued to bring out the Hawaiians as well as curious onlookers, and Tikka Taco pulled in crowds at a prime location by the docks. After the first truck stop, Tyler made a mid-episode elimination. The final two headed to Arlington, Virginia were Tikka Tikka Taco ($9,129) and Aloha Plate ($8,562). Leaving the race mid-episode was Philly's Finest Sambonis ($5,685). On the \"fifth day\" of the two episode finale, the two trucks had to go to the [[United States Capitol|U.S Capitol Building]] in Washington D.C. where the winner would be declared. Food Network donated $2,500 to the Fallen Patriot Fund in honor of a fallen veteran friend of Shaun from Tikka Tikka Taco.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: On their second day in Annapolis, the teams were told to go to Kent Island, where they were required to haul their own crab and create an original crab dish. They were judged by Navy Culinary Specialist Jamar Hargress. The winning team received $1,500 toward their till. Winner was '''Aloha Plate'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: On their second day in Arlington, the trucks had to add a special dish to their menu that honored the other team. Tikka Tikka Taco added a teriyaki burger to their menu, while Aloha Plate added chicken tikka tacos with yogurt sauce. Both had to be priced at $10, and if they sold 50 specials before the race ended, an extra $1,000 was added to their till.\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Food Truck Elimination Table\n|-\n!

This season was treated as a \"food-truck boot camp\" for the contestants with each week focusing on a different topic. \nThere were several tokens of various values awarded for most of the challenges, making it so the fastest team to get to the tokens, got to choose the highest valued one (which was applied to their final tally). Food Network designed each team's truck based on their proposed concept. The winning team will earn $50,000 and keep the truck.\n\n===Truck Teams===\n'''Lone Star Chuck Wagon''' \u2013 Hailing from [[Houston]], Lance and his wife Rachel have a home business where they've sold BBQ sauces and rubs for years. Now they want to expand their business so they brought their friend Andrea to help make BBQ and Tex-Mex.\n\n'''Military Moms''' \u2013 Carol, Michele, and Wendy are from [[Fort Drum, New York]] and they've bonded through having husbands deployed in the military as well as their love of comfort food, which is their truck's staple menu.\n\n'''The Middle Feast''' \u2013 Emigrating from [[Israel]] to [[Los Angeles]], Tommy had a promised restaurant job before it folded. Now he's brought his sister Hilla, and his friend Arkadi to dish out Middle Eastern classics like falafel and shawarma.\n\n'''Chatty Chicken''' \u2013 A family truck run by Greg Sr., his son Greg Jr. and daughter Megan. They've been having troubles with their roadside food stand in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] so they hope a new food truck will help realize their southern chicken dreams.\n\n'''Beach Cruiser''' \u2013 This truck comes from [[Venice, California]]. It's the brainchild of Gretta who had bought a truck before but couldn't get it approved by the city. Along with her friends Shane and Nicole, they want to bring \"fish tacos and fried avos\" to the masses.\n\n'''Let There Be Bacon''' \u2013 The selling point of this [[Cleveland]] truck is bacon. Chefs Dylan, Matt and Jon have worked together for 10 years but after a bout with cancer, Matt couldn't work full-time and his restaurant job so he and his friends want a food truck to set their own schedule and menu.\n\n'''The Gourmet Graduates''' \u2013 Roberto, Keese, and Julius are from [[Providence, Rhode Island]] and just as their name suggests, this trio is made up of culinary school graduates. They aim to serve dorm food with a gourmet twist.\n\n'''Madres Mexican Meals''' \u2013 From [[Norwalk, California]], Chef Javier wants to prove to his father that he made the right decision in pursuing culinary. Along with his mother Luisa, and his wife Senorina, this trio aims to make authentic Mexican dishes.\n\n===Episodes===\n'''Venice Beach Brawl (Week 1)'''\n\nThe food-truck hopefuls converged on the docks of Santa Barbara to get acquainted with their trucks and get their first assignment: make three dishes with $200 seed money and start selling in Santa Barbara. Each truck got a metal briefcase that they weren't allowed to open until the time was right (the end of this season). Chatty Chicken didn't buy enough oil for their deep fryer so they had to pan fry everything which took longer. Everyone had to move spots because of a speed bump, which thrilled Beach Cruiser \u2012 who teamed up with Let There Be Bacon \u2012 since everyone would be moving to Beach Cruiser's home turf. Chatty Chicken had to go back to their truck twice while doing a re-stock grocery run. Let There Be Bacon closed early because their water wasn't running.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: In a blind challenge where none of the teams were informed, two local food-truck operators, Sabin and Jim (from Cousins Maine Lobster), went to each truck and asked for their best dish. They picked their top three favorites; the first place team got an extra $500 in their till, the second place team got an extra $200, and the third place team got $100. Winner: Madres Mexican Meals, 1st Runner Up: Beach Cruiser, 2nd Runner Up: Gourmet Graduates\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: Late into the first day, every truck had to move from Santa Barbara, California to Venice Beach, California.\n\n<u>Theme This Week</u>: Branding the Truck\n\n'''Hot Doggin' It in Tucson (Week 2)'''\n\nThe trucks pulled into a veritable wild west set known as Old Tucson and got $300 seed money but had to spend $100 on marketing. Tyler gave each team a flag with their truck logo on it as a brand awareness and marketing starting point. While some teams bought props to get attention (Beach Cruiser and Gourmet Graduates), others paid for advertising (Madres Mexican Meals and Middle Feast), and others offered discounts or raffles (Military Moms and Lone Star Chuck Wagon). On day 2, all the trucks had to go to a local food festival for a speed bump.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: Partway into the first day, the teams had to add a $5 Sonoran hot dog as a fourth menu item. The team that sold the most Sonoran hot dogs would be awarded $500 toward their till, the second-highest seller would get $250, and third place would get $100. Winner was '''Beach Cruiser''', 1st Runner Up was '''Military Moms''', and 2nd Runner Up was '''The Middle Feast'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump #1</u>: The teams had to move from their current locations to a local folk festival and sell head to head, adjacent to each other.\n\n<u>Speed Bump #2</u>: The teams had to create a jingle within a 30-minute time frame, then perform in front of a large crowd at the aforementioned folk festival.\n\n<u>Theme This Week</u>: Marketing\n\n'''Dinner Dates, Austin Style (Week 3)'''\n\nThe teams rolled into Austin where they got $250 seed money and a lesson in partnerships. Everyone's keys were put into a pot and the first key picked out got a chance to choose their partner. Lone Star chose Military Moms, Let There Be Bacon chose Middle Feast, and Beach Cruiser ended up with Madres Mexican. They didn't share sales but they did have to stick together in buying and finding parking spots. Middle Feast and Let There Be Bacon had good sales by securing a location at a gelato festival on Day 1, while the rest of the trucks had very slow foot traffic. On day 2, Beach Cruiser and Madres Mexican made a deal to join the festival, upsetting Middle Feast who was promised exclusivity by someone else at the festival.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The teams had to switch trucks with their partners for part of the second day, and cook their opponent's menu but the money they made went into their own cash till. Lone Star swapped with Military Moms, Let There Be Bacon swapped with Middle Feast, and Beach Cruiser swapped with Madres Mexican. The team who sold the most of their opponent's food earned $500 toward their till, second got $250, and third got $100. Winner was '''Let There be Bacon''', 1st Runner Up was '''Beach Cruiser''', 2nd Runners Up was a tie between '''The Middle Feast''' and '''Madres Mexican Meals'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: Mid-way into the first day, the teams had to relocate to a [[match.com]] dating event until 7 pm and vie for the attention of the participants who each had one $25 token to award their preferred truck (the object being to get the most tokens for their truck).\n\n<u>Theme This Week</u>: Partnerships\n\n'''High Steaks in OKC (Week 4)'''\n\nAfter arriving at botanical gardens of Oklahoma's capital, the teams were told to add a beef dish to their menu, and they were given $400 seed money. To reinforce this week's theme about how \"time is money\", there was a secret speed bump at the very beginning that Tyler didn't tell the teams about until after the fact. All the trucks ended up at the same neighborhood in the center of town and had huge lines the first day. The second day had various degrees of success with initial slower foot traffic for Madres Mexican after they parked at a race track. Madres Mexican also had trouble with a meat grinder for their truck stop challenge, slowing them down.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: On day 2, the trucks were told they had to sell fried onion burgers and fries for $10 for the rest of the day. The first team to sell 50 burgers would get $500 and the second team would get $250. Winner was '''Beach Cruiser''', Runner Up was '''The Middle Feast'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: As soon as the teams left to buy their groceries, Tyler timed them to see who shopped, prepped, and opened the quickest. The teams had to shut down and reopen in 15 minutes increments in the order that they started selling. First open was Madres Mexican Meals (who didn't have to shut down), then Lone Star Chuck Wagon, then Middle Feast, then Let There Be Bacon, and lastly, Beach Cruiser.\n\n<u>Theme This Week</u>: Time Management\n\n'''St. Louis Upsell (Week 5)'''\n\nThe gateway arch in St Louis greeted the incoming food trucks and so did a speed bump. Every truck partnered up with a local business and every truck had huge crowds of people waiting for them. Lone Star raised their prices figuring people who waited on line would be willing to pay a premium price. Tyler made surprise visits to each truck to check on their timing and the quality of their food. He chastised Lone Star on their high prices in relation to skimpy portions.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: On the second day they were challenged to make their best dish. They would put it on their menu and sell it, then at 5:30 pm, they would go to the botanical gardens to have Tyler judge what they came up with. The winner of best dish got whatever profit they made so far, doubled. Winner was '''Lone Star Chuck Wagon''' (additional $5,000).\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: The teams were given no seed money to start with, so they had to make their money by selling toasted ravioli.\n\n<u>Theme This Week</u>: Food Quality\n\n'''Shrimpin' Ain't Easy (Week 6)'''\n\nThe docks of Bayou La Batre was the inspiration for the theme of cooking locally. Since they were near the Gulf of Mexico, the teams were told to add three seafood dishes to their menu, using local ingredients. They got $400 seed money and a Speed Bump that allowed them to potentially get a lot of shrimp. Both Lone Star and Let There Be Bacon used local shrimp but peeling and prepping the shrimp slowed them down. Middle Feast chose not to get shrimp and did three different fish dishes. Lone Star planned to buy some higher quality fish for a potential seafood cook challenge, and to sell for a high profit, but they forgot to buy it.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The second day brought a two-part cooking challenge where the three trucks were told to make a brunch dish which was bought by a random secret shopper and judged by Tyler. The best two dishes (Let There Be Bacon and Lone Star Chuck Wagon) would qualify to compete in a 20-minute Gulf Seafood challenge judged by Tyler and chef Pete Blohme. The best seafood dish would get $1,000 toward their till. Winner was '''Let There Be Bacon'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: On the first day, before shopping, the teams went to a warehouse freezer and had to guess and collect 100 pounds of shrimp by feel alone. Whoever got closest to 100 pounds got the shrimp they collected for free. The other teams were given a chance to purchase shrimp at wholesale prices. Winner was '''Lone Star Chuck Wagon'''.\n\n<u>Theme This Week</u>: Local Ingredients\n\n'''Finale at Mile 0 \u2012 Winning Keys in Key West (Week 7)'''\n\nThe final two made it to Tampa, the first of five stops across southwest Florida. They revisited everything they learned in their food-truck boot camp. Both had to pick five dishes that best represented their brand: one dish had to be sold for $5, three dishes were to be priced at $10, and one dish for $15. They were tasked to record a 30-second radio commercial in the second city, Bonita Springs, that would play in their final destination. They were partnered up and sent to Naples, Florida to sell pre-chosen food to get their seed money. Alligator Alley was a bit of a detour and the setting for their last Truck Stop challenge, while Key West was the fifth and final city where they would sell their menu over the course of two days. Middle Feast stuck close to Lone Star during their final two selling days. At the end of the race, the two teams gathered at [[Key West]]'s White Street Pier and the winners were announced by opening a briefcase (every truck got a briefcase all the way back in Venice Beach and inside the briefcase was the corresponding truck's logo).\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The teams took airboats all the way to Captain Gerald's House in the middle of the Everglades. There, they received some local alligator and frog's legs that they had to cook to be judged by Tyler. The winning dish got their seed money doubled. Winner: The Middle Feast (from $184.50 to $369)\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: There were no official \"Speed Bumps\" but there were several challenges over the course of the finale. The major challenge was when the two trucks had to partner up in Naples and sell pre-determined ingredients; they would split whatever profit they made together and that would be their seed money moving onto Alligator Alley (Lone Star made $200 and Middle Feast made $169).\n\n<u>Theme This Week</u>: All of the Above: Marketing and Branding in the commercial, Partnerships in selling for their seed money, Local Ingredients in the Truck Stop, and Time Management and Food Quality in their final city.\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Food Truck Elimination Table\n|-\n!

The winning team earned $50,000 for their business.\n\n===Truck Teams===\n'''Spice It Up''' \u2013 This trio is made up of working moms Nichole, Chris and Keri. Joining the race from [[Phoenix, Arizona]], these women have a passion for bold flavors and spice-filled curries.\n\n'''Postcards''' \u2013 A Zagat-rated soul-food truck from [[Los Angeles]], this team is led by Greg who wants to open his own restaurant. Supporting him are his daughter, Grae and his friend Monique.\n\n'''Pho Nomenal Dumplings''' \u2013 Friends Sunny, Sophia, and Becca come from [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. They left their corporate jobs to operate a truck serving Asian fusion cuisine including Taiwanese pork dumplings and corn dog bahn mi.\n\n'''Waffle Love''' \u2013 Coming from a big Mormon family out in [[Provo, Utah]], brothers Adam, Steven, and Jared rely on their faith and their food to guide them to victory. They want to bring Belgian [[Li\u00e8ge]] waffle creations to the masses.\n\n'''Diso's Italian Sandwich Society''' \u2013 A [[New York City]] truck that serves fresh Italian sandwiches. Adam was inspired by his grandfather to start up the business and brought in Chef Danamarie and Chef Benny to see it through.\n\n'''The Guava Tree Truck''' \u2013 Authentic Cuban cuisine is dished up by this [[Dallas, Texas]] truck. The team is led by Onel, his wife Pam, and their daughter Mariah.\n\n'''GD Bro Truck''' \u2013  Globally Delicious Stuffed Burgers is the full name of this [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] truck. True to the name, Mark, Kevin, and Geoffrey serve up gourmet, stuffed burgers and fries.\n\n===Episodes===\n'''All-American Road Trip (Week 1)'''\n\nSince the contestants are all professional food-truck owners, they immediately get their first task: sell $200 worth of their most popular item on the Santa Monica Pier. The first team to hit their goal was Spice It Up so an extra $100 was added to the $200 they made. The other trucks made various amounts of money (from $140 to $20) which ended being their seed money, along with an extra $66 given by Tyler in honor of the route they would be traveling: Route 66. They all got a map directing them to Lake Havasu City, Arizona. Pho Nomenal Dumplings' truck broke down before they could start selling in Arizona so they had to get towed around to their selling destinations that weekend. The Guava Truck had a bit of trouble with their generator on day 2 but managed to fix it.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: In honor of Lake Havasu's London Bridge, the trucks were given cod and potatoes, and told they had to serve their version of fish and chips. First team to sell 20 orders received an additional $500 for their till. Winner was '''Diso's Italian Sandwich Society'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: There was no official speed bump in the first episode.\n\n'''Off-Road Eats in Arizona (Week 2)'''\n\nStaying in Arizona, the trucks drive to Flagstaff (with Pho Nomenal Dumplings having rented a new truck to replace their old one). Everyone got $200 seed money and were told to sell as much as possible for a potential advantage later on. All the trucks had trouble selling in cold, rainy weather the first day but Waffle Love sold the most and got a one-hour head start on day 2 when they would all be moving a few miles south to Sedona. All the trucks ended up selling at a large supermarket parking lot. There was a sizable vegetarian community in Sedona which prompted Spice It Up and GD Bro to add a vegetarian dish to their menu.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: Late morning on the third day, the teams had to sell rattlesnake rabbit sausage dishes while riding around in pink jeeps. At 2:00 pm, they had to return to pay $100 for the sausage. All profits from selling the sausage dishes would be doubled for every team. After paying for the sausage, Spice It Up sold the most with $435, Diso's Italian sold $265, GD Bro sold $199, Postcards sold $135, Phonomenal Dumpling sold $20, and Waffle Love was the only truck to lose money (-$10).\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: There was no official speed bump but on the first day there was an early \"Quick Fire challenge\" which consisted of the teams competing to get the most sales of their signature dish. The winner got an hour advantage the next day. Winner was '''Waffle Love'''.\n\n'''Spicy Showdown In Santa Fe (Week 3)'''\n\nAs soon as everyone arrived at Santa Fe, they were given a Truck Stop cooking challenge. The trucks had a steady stream of customers in the first day and were mostly busy at the farmers market on the second day, except for Spice It Up whose menu was presumed too complex for the morning crowd. They did manage to get an afternoon rush but they sold out with four hours left in the day, and couldn't restock thanks to a speed bump. Postcards accidentally dinged the bumper of a parked car and got fined $500 for leaving the accident and for the actual damage.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: The teams had to create a dish using New Mexican chiles and they were given $50 for additional ingredients. They were judged by local Chef Martin Rios and the best dish would get $1,000 towards their till. Winner was '''Postcards'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump #1</u>: In the middle of day 1 sales, the teams had to buy all the food they thought they would need for the rest of the weekend. They were not allowed to shop again even if they sold out.\n\n<u>Speed Bump #2</u>: At the beginning of day 2, the teams were given spots next to each other at the Santa Fe Railyard Farmers Market and had to stay until the farmers market closed.\n\n'''High Steaks in Texas (Week 4)'''\n\nEveryone drove to The Big Texan Steak Ranch restaurant in Amarillo were they were given an initial $50 in seed money and the chance to earn more by completing a 20-minute eating challenge where they had to eat 72 oz of steak, a salad, a baked potato, three fried shrimp, and a dinner roll. The first to finish was Pho Nomenal Dumplings, followed by GD Bro, and Waffle Love. They received an extra $250 each. Postcards did not finish 11 oz of their steak and therefore only earned $150 for the steak and $50 for the sides. All four trucks ended up at the same supermarket parking lot on day 1 and they were all busy, though Postcards was slow to open due to their prep time. On day 2, GD Bro and Pho Nomenal sold in one parking lot and Waffle Love and Postcards ended up at another lot. Every Sunday thus far, the Waffle Love team went to church before selling their food so Postcards took advantage and sold to the people waiting there.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: While not officially identified as a truck stop, their culinary challenge was to make and sell a steak dish. The team that sold the most steak dishes would win an extra $500. Winner was '''GD Bro'''. There was a second part to the steak selling contest where all the steak dishes were secretly tasted and judged by the Big Texas Steakhouse owner Bobby Lee. The best steak dish would get an extra $500. Winner was '''Pho Nomenal Dumplings'''.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: On the second day, two of each truck's team members had to leave for 30 minutes to go shopping for new supplies, leaving one team member to run the food truck by themselves.\n\n'''Roadside Attractions (Week 5)'''\n\nThe remaining teams convened at the Blue Whale of Catoosa and immediately got their unofficial Speed Bump and $500 to spend on it and their food. Midway into day 1, Tyler and a local classic car club member, Dick McGuire, went to the three attractions to admire the attractions and taste each dish. Tyler told them where to go the next day then returned their phones.\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: On day 2, the trucks arrived at the Admiral Twin Drive-in to serve to members of a classic car club. They had 20 minutes to go to as many cars and pitch their roadside special dish. Each club member then drove by the truck (getting food drive-thru style) and used a $25 chip to buy their preferred dish. The team who got the most chips was Waffle Love, with $925 total. Both GD Bro and Pho Nominal got $450 each.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: Upon arrival, the teams got their cell phones taken away and were required to have roadside attractions to market their trucks instead of utilizing social media. They also had to make a $15 lunch dish to complement their attraction.\n\n'''Showdown In Chi-Town (Week 6)'''\n\nThe final two faced off under the St. Louis arch in one final truck stop cooking challenge. After getting $150 seed money, they were told to make a 3-hour pitstop in Springfield, Illinois to make more money for their final destination: Chicago. Pho Nomenal earned $796 for Chicago supplies and Waffle Love earned $755. The final challenge was to sell 50 dishes customized to three different neighborhoods: Chinatown, Little Italy, and Greektown. After selling all 150 dishes, they had to be first across the finish line at [[Buckingham Fountain]]. Waffle Love kept tabs on Pho-Nomenal via social media. Despite winning the truck stop, initially allowing Pho Nomenal to sell only 20 dishes in Chinatown (120 dishes across three neighborhoods), they were penalized for selling outside of Greektown's small boundaries, meaning they had to re-sell 50 dishes in Greektown (total of 170 dishes sold by Pho Nomenal in Chicago).\n\n<u>Truck Stop</u>: Upon arrival, the teams were given chicken, ground beef, and pork steak to create three winning dishes in 90 minutes. Pitmasters Adam and Frank from Adam's Smokehouse served as judges. The winner would be able to sell 30 fewer dishes in Chicago. Winner: Pho-Nomenal Dumplings.\n\n<u>Speed Bump</u>: Not dubbed as an official speed bump but a challenge: since Springfield was the birthplace of Abraham Lincoln, they were only allowed to collect $5 bills as their form of payment, requiring all dishes to be priced at either $5, $10, or $15.\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Food Truck Elimination Table\n|-\n!

The race also stayed mainly in the state of California. The \"Speed Bump\" and \"Truck Stop\" challenges were no longer identified as such, but there's still at least one inter-truck competition in each episode. The winners received $50,000.\n\n===Truck Teams===\n'''Carretto Siciliano''' \u2013 Noted for having Vinny<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/790447/your-jersey-shore-fave-is-now-competing-on-the-great-food-truck-race|title=Your Jersey Shore Fave Is Now Competing on The Great Food Truck Race | work=eonline.com}}</ref> from [[Jersey Shore (TV series)|The Jersey Shore]], this truck specializes in homemade Sicilian food prepared by Vinny's mom, Paola, and his uncle Angelo. Paola wants to open up her own restaurant and Vinny aims to use his reality show fame to bring attention, and customers, to her cause.\n\n'''Grilled Cheese All-Stars''' \u2013 Twin brothers Michael and Charlie, from [[Northern California]], want to open a truck devoted to cheesy foods and they have serious experience having trained as cheesemakers in France and worked on dairy farms across Europe. Their college friend, Bryce join them to make their dreams come true.\n\n'''Lei-Away Leidies''' \u2013 Having moved from [[Laie, Hawaii]] to Utah, sisters Carey and Summer never forgot their Hawaiian roots and want to bring poke bowls and teriyaki burgers to the masses via food truck. Summer's daughter, Autumn is there to help the women achieve their dreams.\n\n'''BigMista's Fatty Wagon''' \u2013 Barbecue master Neil and his wife Phyllis own restaurants in [[Long Beach, California]] but believe a food truck is the way to expand their business. They're joined by their \"adopted BBQ son\", Eric and together they serve up southern food, with an emphasis on BBQ.\n\n'''Fortune Cooking''' \u2013 All the way from [[Milford, Michigan]], this team is led by self-proclaimed Samurai Chef Tom, his wife, Julie, and Julie's friend, Tiffany. Though Tom owns several restaurants specializing in Asian fusion, and has competed in other Food Network shows, he wants to get into the food-truck business.\n\n'''Sweet Southern Soul''' Tiffany is a police officer from [[Chicago]] who has a passion for cooking and seeks to open her own restaurant one day, dishing out quinoa and chicken southern bowls. She's joined by her sister Tikia and her friend Kizzma making them the second all-female truck in the race.\n\n===Episodes===\n'''A Family Affair (Week 1)'''\n\nThe six teams arrive via large bus to Six Flags Magic Mountain where they had to find the key to their food truck under one of twelve plates of funnel cakes; if they chose a plate with no key underneath, they had to eat the funnel cake. They got $300 seed money before being sent into Los Angeles to sell. Sweet Southern Soul had some trouble with their truck's pilot light and they couldn't make any sales on the first day. Vinny from Carretto Siciliano got a parking ticket which ate into most of his day 1 profits. On the morning of day 2, they got a phone auction/challenge. Tom from Fortune Cooking accidentally sideswiped two parked Los Angeles food trucks, damaging a mirror and cooler cover.\n\n<u>Challenge</u>: Tyler offered a spot for one food truck inside Six Flags and each team had to bid for the spot, in the hopes that they would be able to make back the money they spent for exclusive access inside the theme park. Carretto Siciliano bid $400 and got the spot. The gamble paid off because they ended up with first place at elimination.\n\n'''Things Get Berry Interesting (Week 2)'''\n\nUp north in Oxnard, the teams discover there's a strawberry festival and after getting $200 seed money, they are given their first cooking challenge of the season. Lei-Away Ladies used a familiar past season technique of \"coconut wireless\" (first mentioned by season 04's ''Aloha Plate''); calling in all Hawaiian locals in every city to support them. They got lost for a bit following a local Hawaiian to a parking spot but ended up at the spot and all his friends and family came to buy their food. On day 2, four of the five trucks started off at a farmer's market (Lei-Away stuck with their previous parking spot and got the repeat Hawaiian customers). Grilled Cheese sold their food for lower prices which meant more sales but an overall lower profit. Big Mista's overfilled their propane tank so they had to wait for the excess to leak out before they could cook, then later on, after picking a slow location they decided to close early.\n\n<u>Challenge</u>: The teams had to buy strawberries from the local Oxnard strawberry festival and make two dishes, one sweet and one savory (this was like a \"Truck Stop\" cooking challenge). Bonnie Atmore, a spokeswoman for the strawberry festival, visited each truck to taste their strawberry dishes and the one she deemed the best would win $300 towards their till. The winner was '''Sweet Southern Soul'''.\n\n'''An Egg-cellent Adventure (Week 3)'''\n\nFurther north in wine country, the teams rolled up to an ostrich farm (Ostrichland USA) where they were challenged to participate in an egg hunt inside a large ostrich pen. Each team member had to find an ostrich egg that was dyed a specific color related to their team. Once they found their three eggs, they could go start selling in Solvang. They got their $300 seed money and all parked relatively close to one another. All the trucks had huge lines on both days since Solvang is a tourist destination with Danish-style architecture.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: While they were shopping, the teams got a phone call telling them they had to make a family recipe dish using their three collected ostrich eggs. A secret shopper, Chef Seth, was sent around the trucks to try the dishes. The winner would get immunity; '''Carretto Siciliano''' won.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: Partway through the second day, they were thrown a curveball (akin to a \"Speed Bump\") in the form of little [[aebleskiver]] pans that were delivered to all the food trucks. All the teams' pots and pans were replaced with the special Danish pans for a few hours.\n\n'''A Dessert In The Desert (Week 4)'''\n\nOn the outskirts of Palm springs, the teams met near the Cabazon Dinosaurs tourist attractions and got $500 seed money. Since they were in the desert, the teams had to retool their menus to feature lighter fare and cooling desserts. That's where Tyler came in with another phone auction challenge. On the first day, the Lei-Away ladies took a long time finding a good spot and ultimately ended up downtown along with the other two trucks. On the second day, after a potential locaton didn't yield any customers, Grilled Cheese tried to park near Caretto's but since it was a private lot, they parked just far enough away while still being close to the customers attracted by Carettos. The finale was kickstarted at the end of elimination with the final two given instructions to begin selling as soon as they reach their final destination. They were given $400 seed money.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: Before they went shopping, the teams got a phone call. They had to sell desserts priced at $6 but they had to bid on chocolate, fresh fruit, and nuts with each team getting exclusive use of the ingredient they bid the most on. Grilled Cheese All-Stars won exclusive use of chocolate for $25, Lei-Away Leidies paid $45 for fresh fruit, and Carretto Siciliano were left with nuts for $25. The team who sold the most desserts got $200 towards their till. '''Grilled Cheese All-Stars''' won.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: On day 2, inspired by the Cabazon Dinosaurs roadside attraction, the three teams were challenged to become human roadside attractions for their food trucks. The team who took the most photos/selfies with people got an additional $200 towards their till. '''Carretto Siciliano''' won.\n\n'''The Island (Week 5)'''\n\nThe final two teams were ready to start selling right off the heels of the last episode. Upon arriving at San Pedro harbor they had one hour to shop, prep, and load their trucks onto a barge heading to their final destination: Catalina Island. Then they encountered their final selling challenge. Once on the island, they competed head to head, side by side, and had 12 hours to sell as much as possible (instead of the past finales that ranged from 2 days to more). Tyler personally took the truck's cash boxes to count them up and announce the winner in front of the Catalina Casino. After the winner was announced, it was revealed that both finalists got their own miniseries on Food Network; Caretta Siciliano got '[https://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/vinny-and-ma-eat-america/episodes Vinny & Ma Eat America]' and Grilled Cheese All-Stars got '[https://www.foodnetwork.com/shows/big-cheese/on-the-set-of-big-cheese-in-los-angeles Big Cheese]'.\n\nChallenge: While their trucks were transported, the teams had to sell hot dogs out of carts in San Pedro for about two hours. The team who made the most money selling hot dogs were taken to Catalina Island by helicopter, earning them an hour head start, while the other team had to travel by boat. The Grilled Cheese All-Stars won.\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Food Truck Elimination Table\n|-\n\n! ''Truck''\n!

Once again, there's no \"Speed Bumps\" and \"Truck Stops\" but there are still challenges worth money and occasional curveballs. The winning team gets a $50,000 prize courtesy of [[Farmer's Insurance]].\n\n===Truck Teams===\n'''Stick 'Em Up''' A straightforward theme of food on a stick from [[Rogersville, Tennessee]]. Shona has a successful catering business back home and has brought her two sons Justin and Landon to help realize her dream of expanding her business.\n\n'''The Breakfast Club''' \u2013 All three in this team are young, self-proclaimed millennials from [[Philadelphia]]. Mikey leads the team with best friends Taylor and Ashanti. They dish up breakfast and brunch inspired dishes like loaded breakfast nachos and mocha doughnuts.\n\n'''Braised in the South''' \u2013 Nick, Steven, and Brandon are a group of classically trained chefs and best friends from [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. They serve up food with a southern flair like BBQ Shrimp Tacos and Cajun Chicken \"Tatchos\".\n\n'''Mr. Po' Boys''' \u2013 Running a successful food stand at their [[Dallas, Texas]] farmer's market, Cedric and Ryan are culinary school graduates with business know-how. They are joined by another culinary graduate, Esther, and their specialty is gourmet po' boy sandwiches.\n\n'''The Southern Frenchie''' \u2013 All the way from [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], Chef Donnie owned a restaurant for ten years before losing it due to debt. Along with his wife Meaghan and sous chef Amanda, he hopes a food truck will be his second chance to show off his southern food with restaurant flair.\n\n'''Wicked Good Seafood''' \u2013 Bill, Ryan, and Dan are a group of friends from [[Falmouth, Massachusetts]] with restaurant backgrounds in a seaside town where business is slow during the off-season. They have a passion and knowledge for New England style seafood.\n\n'''Papi Chulo's Empanadas''' \u2013 A family business on wheels; Luis, his daughter, Carleena, and his niece, Sarah are the second Philadelphia team. Luis worked his way up in U.S kitchens since he immigrated from the Dominican Republic, and he cooks what he knows best: Dominican empanadas.\n\n===Episodes===\n'''The Big 'Not So Easy' (Week 1)'''\n\nThe newest batch of contestants converged on New Orleans to meet with Tyler and receive a beignet cooking challenge right off the bat. After a few hours of selling beignets, they were sent shopping to make their signature menu. Braised in the South spent a long time looking for a parking spot and Papi Chulo's Empanadas had a trouble making their empanads due to the heat. Some trucks had a good flow of customers (Brunch Squad & Wicked Good Seafood) while others hardly got anyone the first day (Braised in the South & Southern Frenchie). The second day saw a little improvement in customers for everyone.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: Each food truck had to sell their version of a decadent beignet in New Orleans. Ingredients were provided and any profit made was added to their $300 seed money. The truck who made the most was Stick Em Up ($131) and the least sold was Wicked Good Seafood ($35).\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: On day 2, the trucks had to make a special of the day using ingredients from the town's popular \"Hurricane\" drink (passionfruit, orange, and lime). New Orleans Chef Susan Spicer went to each food truck to pick best dish, which would get $100 towards their till. The winner was '''Mr Po' Boys'''.\n\n'''New Marching Orders (Week 2)'''\n\nThe trucks headed east and arrived at the [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]] where they immediately get a \"kickoff\" cooking challenge. During the challenge, Papi Chulo's ran out of their tortillas before they could serve all the troops. Afterwards, they got $200 seed money and left to go shop and sell. Papi Chulo's couldn't find empanada dough at the store so they opted to sell tacos. Southern Frenchie won a monetary challenge so they initially didn't worry about first day sales, wanting to focus on prep for the second day. But when they saw other trucks with plenty of customers, they quickly scrambled to make sandwiches to sell. Po' Boys found out, via social media, that Stick Em' Up had a good spot at City Hall and parked nearby. On day 2, Southern Frenchie joined the other two trucks at City Hall.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: Working in pairs, the food trucks had to make cohesive dishes to serve 50 aviation service members and the troops would choose their favorite dish of the three teams. The two winning trucks each got $200 towards their till. The Breakfast Club paired with Stick 'Em Up, Braised in the South picked Southern Frenchie, and the remaining Mr. Po' Boys worked with Papi Chulo's Empanadas. The winning teams were '''Braised in the South''' and '''Southern Frenchie'''.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: The mayor of Pensacola, [[Ashton Hayward]], wanted the teams to incorporate red snapper into a dish. The truck that sold the most fish dishes would win immunity. The winner was '''Stick Em' Up'''.\n\n'''Sweet Home Alabama (Week 3)'''\n\nLooping up north, the teams reached the Tuscaloosa courthouse and were met with a physical challenge, then told of an additional pecan dessert challenge. They got $200 dollars seed money. Braised in the South and Southern Frenchie decided to park near breweries and got huge crowds. Most of the trucks, save for Stick Em Up (who chose to park at the supermarket parking lot), ended up with lots of sales. Early on the second day, Tyler assigned them a \"happy hour\" special where they had to sell their pecan desserts for $1. Stick Em Up ended up snagging the spot that Mr Po' Boys had the day before but they underestimated the crowds there and quickly sold out. Mr Po' Boys also sold out. All the trucks had waves of customers during the lunch hour.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: Two people from each food truck had 15 minutes to crack pecans. The team who cracked the most pecans in 15 minutes got mentored by baker Jan Potter and the rest of the teams had to cleanup the pecan shells. '''Braised in the South''' won.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: Everyone had to add pecan desserts to their menu. The team who sold the most pecan dessert dishes got $300 towards their till. '''The Breakfast Club''' won.\n\n'''Hot Chicken in the City (Week 4)'''\n\nHome of the Grand Ole Opry and hot chicken, Nashville was the destination for the remaining teams. They had to do a taste and cooking challenge before they were given $300 seed money. On the first day, Mr Po' Boys drove around for hours looking for a good parking spot. They weren't the only ones with troubles; all the trucks had low sales and sparse foot traffic. The second day was better all around in terms of sales and customers, and it had Tyler and a guest judge going around to taste the food and determine the winner of the second challenge.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: The truck teams had to make their version of fried, spicy hot chicken but could not use chicken. Chef Aqui Hines went to each truck to taste and chose the best dish. The winning team got $500 in their till. '''Mr Po' Boys''' won.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: On the second day, the teams were challenged to do self-promotion for their truck. Tyler and country singer [[Craig Wayne Boyd]] went around and judged which team was best representing and promoting their truck. The winning team got immunity (the second immunity prize of this season). '''The Breakfast Club''' won.\n\n'''Fresh Off the Farm (Week 5)'''\n\nArriving at Thomas Orchards in Athens, the teams were greeted by Tyler and a peach challenge. They got $300 seed money and were told to partner up with local business because, by law, the Georgia college town had no street parking. Braised in the South partnered with a brewery, Mr Po Boys used a print shop's parking lot, and Breakfast Club paired up with a bar & grill. One of the chefs from Braised in the South, Nick, got a surprise visit from his wife who offered support. The trucks all had ups and downs in terms of customers. Tyler went to each truck to talk to the teams, offering encouragement and advice.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: The teams had 30 minutes to make a savory peach appetizer for Tyler and Chef Mimi Maumus to taste. Then winners could choose to shut down their competitors for one hour at any point during their time in Georgia. '''Braised in the South''' won (and they shut down the other two trucks in the middle of day 2).\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: As they were shopping, Tyler texted the teams and told them to change their menus for the weekend. They were not allowed to make anything they've sold in the last four cities.\n\n'''The Race Through Savannah (Week 6)'''\n\nThe final two were on their way to the oldest city in Georgia when they got a call from Tyler telling them to start shopping and selling. They received $300 seed money at the supermarket. Mr Po' Boys immediately got a prime parking spot in front of a bar and it took Braised in the South a little while to find a spot. The teams were side tracked by a selling challenge then returned to a steady flow of customers. The second day had the trucks moving to different areas for a seafood cook challenge, parked side by side, and competing head to head. They met at the Savannah riverfront to find out the winners by opening a briefcase; the winning team would have a case filled with the money.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: In the middle of day 1, the final two got a call and were told to sell their food out of pedicabs for one hour. The team that sold the most got $500 in their till. The winners were '''Braised in the South'''.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: At the beginning of day 2, Tyler gave both teams a location to go to. Every few hours the location would change and they had to cook a different type of shellfish. The team who sold the most shellfish dishes got an additional $500 in their till. The winners were again '''Braised in the South'''.\n\n* ''1st location'' \u2013 [[Squares of Savannah, Georgia#Johnson Square|Johnson Square]] (shrimp)\n* ''2nd location'' \u2013 [[Savannah Civic Center]] (scallops)\n* ''3rd location'' \u2013 [[Forsyth Park]] (clams)\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Food Truck Elimination Table\n|-\n!

They begin in Los Angeles, California and the final two return there to finish the race. There are various challenges throughout the competition as well as the occasional curveball. The winning team gets $50,000.\n\n===Truck Teams===\n'''Sassy Soul''' \u2013 Three friends from [[Washington D.C.]], Sassy, Carson, and Paris, make up this all-women team who dish out comforting soul food. Chef Sassy started out cooking shrimp over rice for her friends to make some money and soon found she had a passion for it.\n\n'''Just Wing It''' \u2013 Kevin, Sharon and Steven met as contestants on season 12 of [[Worst Cooks in America]]. They were impressed by Kevin's chicken wings and based their food gimmick on that. They hope to prove to viewers that they can really cook now.\n\n'''Buns N' Thighs''' \u2013 Chef Ian has brought his girlfriend, Victoria, and her mother, Marla, to try and make his dream of a food truck come true, hoping that their experience running a business in [[Chicago]] will give them an edge over the other teams.\n\n'''New England Grill''' \u2013 Chef Kevin from [[Rhode Island]], Chef Eddie from [[New York (state)|New York]], and comedian Christine from [[Massachusetts]] form a trio with a common goal; to bring the flavors of New England, from lobster to scallops to Yankee pot roast, out to the west.\n\n'''Mobile Moo Shu''' \u2013 The second all-women team is made up of three friends from [[Michigan]] who specialize in Asian fusion food. Michelle and Marley started cooking together in college, and Chelsea learned Asian flavors while teaching in China.\n\n'''Heroes on a Half Shell''' \u2013 From [[Frederick, Maryland]], Donna leads this truck along with her oldest son, CJ, and youngest daughter Danni. They specialize in submarine sandwiches, scooping out a good amount of soft bread and leaving behind the \"shell\" to hold more of their fillings.\n\n'''Chops' Shop''' \u2013 Chef Bryan \"Chop\", a professional caterer, joins the race from [[Pearland, Texas]] and he's brought his mother Sandra, and his aunt Sonia to help serve up tasty Tex-Mex dishes like elote creamed corn and pulled pork nachos.\n\n===Episodes===\n'''Wagons Ho! (Week 1)'''\n\nEveryone gathered at Watt Ranch, outside Los Angeles and had to complete a little challenge before they got their seed money ($500) and food truck. They had to hand-squeeze enough oranges to fill a pitcher before going to Los Angeles to start selling. New England Grill got to their truck first and Buns N' Thighs were the last to fill up their pitchers. Most of the teams converged on Hollywoood on the first day but New England Grill was a few miles away and they accidentally broke their generator leaving them without lights. On day 2, most of the trucks had trouble finding a steady stream of customers with Sassy Soul spending most of their three-hour challenge window driving around.\n\n<u>Challenge</u>: At the start of day 2, the teams had to sell beef dishes for $12 a plate in three hours. The most beef dishes sold garnered $200 towards their till. However, they had to bid from a choice of six prime cuts of beef (since there were seven teams, the loser would get a mystery cut from Tyler). Heroes on the Half Shell bought ground chuck for $30, Chops' Shop bought beef ribs for $45, Sassy Soul bought New York strip for $100, Mobile Moo Shu bought flank steak for $80, and New England Grill bought filet mignon for $100. Neither Buns N' Thighs or Just Wing It bid on top round so they were given oxtail. The winner of the beef challenge was '''Mobile Moo Shu'''.\n\n'''Shrimp and Glitz (Week 2)'''\n\nSin City welcomed the teams with a shrimp challenge. Michelle from Mobile Moo Shu had family in Las Vegas who came to buy food and support her truck. On day 2, they got $200 seed money and were able to buy things to sell (besides the free shrimp in the previous day). Because almost all the food trucks lost money in the first episode, Tyler and restaurant-business consultant, Elizabeth Blau, went to each truck to taste their signature dish and offered menu tips and financial advice. Heroes on the Half Shell paired up with Chops' Shop and many of the trucks went through lulls and high-selling periods.\n\n<u>Challenge</u>: As soon as they arrived in town, the teams were given shrimp and pantry staples, and told to make a signature shrimp dish to sell head to head on Fremont Street. The team who sold the most in four hours got a prime, exclusive selling spot next to the Las Vegas strip the next day (no one else could park on the strip). The winners were '''Mobile Moo Shu'''.\n\n'''An Oasis in the Desert (Week 3)'''\n\nThe teams converged at a [[Sonic Drive-In|Sonic]] drive-thru restaurant in Phoenix and met with Tyler and Sonic's Senior Director of Culinary Innovation, Mackenzie Gibson, where they got a tasting challenge that preceded a cooking challenge. Just Wing It sneakily followed Mobile Moo Shu's online location posts and decided to park near them since they were the strongest team thus far. Victoria and Marla, from Buns N' Thighs, had to leave the competition to take care of a home business and an ailing father, respectively. That left Chef Ian alone to handle the food truck for the two days in Phoenix, a first on this show. The teams got $300 seed money and their \"challenge flavors\" for free (strawberries, lemons, iced tea etc.) Ian of Buns N' Thighs recruited a passerby to help on the first day and went at it alone the second day. On day 2, Mobile Moo Shu and Just Wing It were parked illegally so they had to move.\n\n<u>Challenge</u>: Part 1 of the Sonic challenge involved a blind taste test of three specially chosen Sonic drinks. '''Mobile Moo Shu''' guessed the most flavors correctly and won. Part 2 had the teams making a dish inspired by one of five Sonic drinks: mango limeade, ocean water, cherry limeade, raspberry lemon iced tea, and strawberry lemonade. As winners of the first part, Mobile Moo Shu got first pick of their flavor: mango limeade. Just Wing It were given strawberry lemonade, New England Grill were given ocean water flavor (coconut and lime), Chops' Shop were given cherry limeade. Buns N' Thighs got raspberry lemon iced tea. Later on, Tyler and Senior Director Mackenzie judged which truck utilized the drink flavors in their dish the best,  and awarded $200 to the winner. The winner was '''Chops' Shop'''.\n\n'''Bordertown Boom (Week 4)'''\n\nThe teams arrived at the Arizona Territory Prison and got a brief history lesson on the food provisions that passed through there, including artichokes and bacon. They all participated in an artichoke peeling relay race where each team member had to peel five artichokes. After fifteen artichokes were peeled, the teams could get their seed money ($300) and a cooking challenge. Just Wing It finished peeling first and Chops' Shop finished last. The first day, all the trucks ended up getting huge crowds and selling out of food; it affected Chops' Shop the worst because they decided not to buy too much initially, recalling their slow sales in past cities. Christine from the New England Grill truck suffered a head injury and had to be taken to the hospital, missing out on half the second day of selling. All four trucks were sent to a main street festival partway into day 2, and once again sold out, forcing them all to make a second shopping trip.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: Since bacon and artichokes were featured in the beginning of the episode, the teams were tasked to combine the two ingredients into a tasty dish. Whoever sold the most bacon and artichoke dishes would win immunity. The winners were '''New England Grill'''.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: A quick phone call from Tyler on the second day instructed the teams to get rid of their most popular menu dish and replace it with something new.\n\n'''First Dates (Week 5)'''\n\nEveryone met up at Hadley Date Gardens for another quick challenge before they got their seed money ($400) and the go-ahead to sell in Coachella Valley. They had to remove the pits from a pound of dates, without splitting the fruit, using wooden skewers. Just Wing It were the first ones to finish and New England Grill were last. All three trucks ended up on the same block on day 1 and had steady sales. On day 2, the trucks managed to get into a pre-music festival resort pool party for the lunch rush but when they left they had a slower dinner service, except for Just Wing It who opted to close early.\n\n<u>Challenge</u>: The three trucks had to make a dish using the dates they pitted. The dishes would be judged by the co-owners of the Hadley Date Gardens. The best dish got an additional $600 in their till. The winners were '''Just Wing It'''.\n\n'''The Whole Enchilada (Week 6)'''\n\nThe final two teams return to where they first started; Los Angeles. At the downtown plaza, they met Mexican restaurateur [[Bricia Lopez]] and found out they had to use Mexican ingredients, then they got $400 seed money. The first day, Just Wing It immediately got a parking space while New England Grill had some initial problems finding foot traffic. The second day had a slow start but there were steady sales, including some word of mouth attention for Just Wing It. Tyler personally visited both trucks to talk to them and give them an emotional pep talk. Later on, Mobile Moo Shu came by to visit Just Wing It. The final elimination took place at a western movie set in [[Paramount Ranch]].\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: On Day 1, they had to use chayote squash in a special dish. The truck with the best chayote dish got $350 in their till. The winners were '''New England Grill'''.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: On Day 2, the teams got a second Mexican ingredient, habanero peppers. The trucks had to sell habanero dishes for $10 and whoever sold the most dishes got their habanero profits doubled. The winners were '''Just Wing It'''.\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Food Truck Elimination Table\n|-\n! ''Truck''\n!

The teams begin in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. There are various challenges throughout the competition. The winning team gets $50,000.\n\n===Truck Teams===\n'''Baby Got Mac''' \u2014 A team from [[Los Angeles]], married couple Clinton and Samma started a catering company after cooking for friends at [[Dungeons & Dragons]] games. Along with their friend Rosa, these 90's children serve up varying styles of macaroni and cheese. Spending all of their money for renovation of a shuttle bus, the couple want to use the race to finish their project and restart their business on the road.\n\n'''Brunch Babes''' - A family affair and all-female trio from [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] dishes out unique and decadent brunch dishes. Composed of dance coach Lara, anesthetic nurse/cousin Lydia, and aspiring medical student Mariah, Lara's sister and a newlywed to a Marine, these ladies have a competitive nature inherited from their family. They look to stand out from the rest of the pack by busting out dance ribbons, acrobatic flips, and even a pineapple suit.\n\n'''Frank-N-Slides''' \u2014 Based in [[Boise, Idaho]], Chef Steve, with military vet Craig and energetic hype-man Kyle, serve gourmet hot dogs and sliders with specialty sauces that are, as they say, \u2018punch you in the face\u2019 bold. Steve also wrote a gourmet cookbook for the outdoors and portable cooking anywhere is his specialty. The team even have a hot dog costume to attract customers.\n\n'''Madea Made''' - Residing in [[Virginia Beach, Virginia]], former deputies and twin sisters Hope and Faith, along with Hope's husband Andre, with whom she runs a catering business with, showcase the home-cooking skills their family has taught through the years. This team is serving up dishes described as \"Southern soul food with innovation.\" Their truck name honors Hope and Faith's own grandmother Madea and the legacy of generations that came before them.\n\n'''Make It Maple''' \u2014 From [[Montpelier, Vermont]], Sue, her son Charles, and best friend Paulette, are passionate about cooking with local maple right from their Vermont backyards. So as such, the team features both sweet and savory dishes with maple flavors. The ladies know their sweet and savory dishes are crowd-pleasers from experience, as they have been catering to large groups for years.\n\n'''NOLA Creations''' \u2014 Hailing from [[Atlanta]], accomplished chef and Le Cordon Bleu graduate Darrell, his wife Anna, and sous chef Terrell, are serving up New Orleans dishes just like home. Born and bred in Louisiana, Darrell and Anna were successful restaurant owners only for [[Hurricane Katrina]] to destroy his business and a deadbeat contractor wiping them out financially. Even after all those years, Darrell and Anna will never leave behind their love for authentic Creole and Cajun food.\n\n'''The People's Fry''' \u2014 All the way from [[Nashville]], food service director Dareka, her pit-master husband Terrance and her \"spice queen\" sister Mahdi,  have teamed up to create a menu serving every kind of loaded french fry imaginable. Blending Dareka's classical training, Terrance's BBQ mastery, and Mahdi's West African flavors, their food can satisfy every taste.\n\n'''Rolling Indulgence''' \u2014 This team from [[Dayton, Ohio]] features three co-workers from the same restaurant. Head chef Drew, his high school sweetheart-turned-fianc\u00e9e Jess, who works as a cocktail waitress, and best friend/bartender Travis, have a family dynamic \u2013 they not only work together, they live together. They are ready to hit the road in a classic 1950s diner food truck, serving diner classics and indulgent cheat day dishes, and win it all to create their own path in the food industry.\n\n'''Sol Food Collective''' \u2014 Another team from [[Los Angeles]], private chef, health and wellness practitioner, animal activist and food blogger Jacquelyn looks to spread her message of delicious vegan food after her own experience changing to a plant-based diet changed her life. Health issues caused Jacquelyn to have mobility problems, but since going vegan she is active and feeling better than ever. Joining her is friend Malyssa, who stood by her during her illness, and Stephanie, who she met via social media, in her determination to spread the healing powers of her healthy and delicious menu from town to town.\n\n===Episodes===\n'''Rumble on the Boardwalk (Week One)'''\n\nTyler and the nine teams kick off the race at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, beginning their first challenge at Pyler Park. After the challenge, teams were given $400 shopping money and instructed to return to the park to sell their food head-to-head with the other trucks continuing the challenge the next day. On the way to the store, Sol Food Collective had accidentally sideswiped the front of Rolling Indulgence's truck with their own, popping up Rolling's bumper and lifting a side of their overhang. The weather eventually turned rainy, though everyone was able to get shopping done quick. Except Make It Maple, who had trouble finding key ingredients. Once back at the beach, water began leaking into some of the trucks, causing some of their appliances to not work. And it got worse for Make It Maple after Sue spilled all their milk for their Maple Dumpling dough, their most popular item. Once the rain stopped, the teams did everything to bring customers to their trucks for the rest of the weekend, from Terrence's infectious hollering, to the Brunch Babes flipping and ribbon dancing, and Kyle wearing a hot dog suit.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: The challenge was to make \"Boardwalk Bites\" in 40 minutes. Ten beachgoers were guest judges, including Tyler. The winning team received $300 to add to their till. The winner was '''Sol Food Collective'''.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: The following day, teams were back in the same location and given three pounds of crab meat donated by The Giant Crab Restaurant. Each team had to create a brand new dish incorporating the crab meat. The team that made the most money from their dishes wins immunity. Sol Food Collective, being a vegan team, decided not to do the challenge, even pulling out a god's card to know if they should not participate. The winner was '''The People's Fry'''.\n\n'''Back Nine Barbecue (Week Two)'''\n\nStaying in the home state of host Tyler Florence, the teams arrive in the golfer community of Hilton Head Island, driving on golf carts to the 18th hole of [[Harbour Town Golf Links]]. There, the first challenge of the weekend begins. After teams received their side dishes from said challenge, they take $300 in seed money, and head to the store. Parked at Shelter Cove Community Park to begin selling for the day, Tyler had the teams sell barbecue that was incorporated into their main dishes. As a gift, they were given five pounds Carolina pulled pork for their main dish given to them by One Hot Mama's. As teams began their prep, several problems began to arise. NOLA can't ignite their pilot lights, Baby Got Mac's water isn't boiling, leaving them with no noodles, and Frank-N-Slides opening early despite being behind a=on both prep and now tickets. The Brunch Babes also experienced problems, receiving tickets with modifications they can't keep up with. Anna wasn't feeling energetic self, so Darrell decides to step off the truck and help. In contrast to that, Terrence turned up his volume and began yelling out orders, which was heard throughout the park. He goes as far as to walk to Frank-n-Slides to promote their fries, but gets called out by Kyle and they engage in a fresh vs. frozen debate. Upon Day 2, Tyler asked customers how long they've been waiting in line and many described a long wait, so Tyler lectured on getting food out fast at elimination.\n\nChallenge #1</u>: For this challenge, a person from each team had to take a five-foot putt to determine the side dish they will be making for the rest of the day. Last week's final totals and the possibility of sinking the putt determines the order in which they could choose from the side dishes shown to them. Everyone missed except for '''Baby Got Mac''' who won and got first choice of their side dish, macaroni and cheese. For the rest of the teams, in order from second to eighth, '''NOLA Creations''' picked fried pickles, '''Brunch Babes''' chose collard greens, '''Madea Made''' picked coleslaw, '''The People's Fry''' chose mashed potatoes, '''Frank-N-Slides''' picked hush puppies, '''Rolling Indulgence''' chose baked beans, and '''Sol Food Collective''' were left with green beans.\n\nChallenge #2</u>: Teams were given two pounds of boiled peanuts, the state snack of South Carolina, and had to incorporate into an existing menu item. The team that sold the most peanut-infused dishes received and extra $400 in their till. The winner was '''Baby Got Mac'''.\n\n'''Fast and Furious (Week Three)'''\n\nTeams drove onto Daytona International Speedway, meeting Tyler on the infield. While thinking about last week and how they can do better this week, Sol Food Collective announced that Stephanie would be leaving the race. She was the one driving the truck when they crashed into Rolling on Week 1, affecting her emotionally. To shift some positive energy into the fold, Tyler asked, \"What the drivers do on the infield when they win?\" Donuts! Tyler introduced Donnie Summerlin, owner of Donnie's Donuts, to the teams as the guest judge for the first challenge. LA\\ater, they arrived at Daytona Beach Boardwalk to sell. As they prep, the health inspector came in and fined NOLA Creations $600 after finding some of last week's pork tucked in the back of their cooler. Meanwhile, the Brunch Babes, winners of the \"Donut Dash\", plan on calling the pit stop as soon as the others open their doors and steal the first sales. However, once the pit stop was initiated, everyone finished it in 15 minutes. After a short wave of customers, it was dead. On Day 2, Sol Collective lost another member when Malyssa began feeling pain and believed she had a kidney stone. With Malyssa going to the hospital, deja vu from last season came as Jacquelyn was left alone. Still with no customers, Travis heads to the beach, meeting the leader of Arizona State Men's Gymnastics team; giving them an order for 16 people. Meanwhile, Samma decided to help Jacquelyn with her prep, which later evolved to one member of each team helping advertise Sol Food Collective.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: Teams parked on the boardwalk and participated in a \"Donut Dash\", where the challenge was to craft one type of [[donut]] and make as many as possible in one hour. Donuts were worth one point each. The team judged for having the best-looking donut received two points per donut, and the best tasting donut was worth three points each. The winning team was able to call an \"Audible Pit Stop\" whenever they wanted, in which all sales and cooking stopped for the other food trucks while the winner continued to cook and sell. During the pit stop, the other teams had to play a game of [[Cornhole]] to earn their way back into the competition by scoring 50 points. '''Brunch Babes''' won both \"best-looking donut\" and \"best tasting donut\" and received five points per donut. They made 27 donuts for a total score of 135. '''Madea Made''' made the most donuts with 51 total.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: Local Atlantic white shrimp was sent to the teams and they were given one hour to create and sell a shrimp dish. The team that sold the most shrimp dishes received an extra $10 per dish added to their till. Sol Food Collective and Rolling Indulgence decided to not do the challenge due to their vegan beliefs and confidence in sales respectively. The winner was '''Madea Made''', selling 19 shrimp specials and adding $190 to their till.\n\n'''Tampa 911 (Week Four)'''\n\nAs teams arrive in Tampa, Craig reveals that he once lived in Tampa before moving to Boise, so he knows a bit about the city. As they all convene in Downtown, the Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister and his deputy squadron come out, to which Tyler asks if someone was speeding. Sheriff Chronister came up to Tyler, saying that he should've contacted him, before it was revealed to be a facade and that the two are great friends. Sheriff Chronister and the deputies served as judges for today's challenge. The teams went shopping afterwards. This was the first week that the teams had to find their own locations. Brunch Babes secured a spot at a brewery, while Lara also revealed she is currently pregnant with her third child, a series first. Baby Got Mac parked at a community college, and Rolling Indulgence get selling in a parking lot across [[Curtis Hixon Waterfront Park]], but both have trouble finding foot traffic. Travis, however, found another big group of people in a bridal party. NOLA Creations get a spot at a winery, and Frank-n-Slides park at the Sparkman Wharf. However, Frank-n-Slides aren't able to sell their sliders at the Wharf. Madea Made are having a tough time finding a spot, so Brunch Babes invite them over to theirs; but with people not wanting to give up their spots in line, they leave quickly to an intersection. Baby Got Mac move to a spot by a Farmer's Market of the main strip of [[Ybor City]]. Day 2 rolls in, and it starts to raining. Rolling Indulgence and Baby Got Mac team up, and Brunch Babes goes back to their original spot, only to find no one. With their original spot on the waterfront for today being a mess, Rolling Indulgence and Baby Got Mac separately begin looking for a new spot. Frank-n-Slides start selling at a bar, where they get a visit from Craig's family.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: The six teams had 30 minutes to create their twist on a [[Cuban sandwich]], a Tampa invention, and sell their dish to Tyler, Chad and the deputies; the deputy squadron will vote on the winner. The teams were also given some roasted pork to work with, courtesy of The Columbia Restaurant. The winner receives a sheriff star badge that allows them to steal $100 dollars from one team's final total at elimination and \"not get arrested\". The winner was '''Madea Made''', who chose to steal from '''Frank-n-Slides'''.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: Fresh grouper from the Gulf of Mexico was given to the teams from Big Ray's Fish Camp, and they all had to incorporate it into a dish. The team who makes the most profit off the dish wins $400 in their till. '''Frank-n-Slides''' won the challenge and the week.\n\n'''Burger Brawl (Week Five)'''\n\nTeams pulled into Florida's premiere [[alligator]] park, Gatorama. Tyler wants the teams to start taking risks, so he has provided them with gator tail and sausage to work with while prepping their menus; and for the first challenge, also have them be zookeepers for the park. With Frank-n-Slides' challenge advantage, the team start early on prepping and selling. After an hour passed, the others call up local businesses, with the Brunch Babes, Rolling Indulgence, and NOLA Creations securing spots at the same brewery. Meanwhile, Madea Made goes hardcore local by partnering with one of the top food trucks in Fort Myers. As several teams take Tyler's risky advice by cooking the gator tail and sausage, Rolling think that taking risks will risk their chances of going home. Rolling, NOLA, and the Babes get slammed with customers and fall behind on their orders. Frank-n-Slides have a moderate line at their location, and Madea Made's crowd with their partner starts to dwindle after a rush of patrons. Tyler comes aboard the trucks to see if they took risks, while letting Madea Made know that they need a better location tomorrow. Day 2: Tyler gives the teams their taste challenge for the weekend: The \"Risky Road Trip\" Burger challenge. While shopping, Hope and Faith argue, with Hope just wanting to get everything on her shopping list. All the teams later park on First Street in Downtown Fort Myers. With people beginning to flock to the trucks, NOLA Creations are unfortunately still behind on prep as orders are being taken. As several teams start driving to new locations after the lunch rush, the secret shopper for the burger challenge tastes each burger. For Madea and Rolling, and NOLA and Babes, the two pairs park at the same locations.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: One team member acts as zookeeper, and has to move an alligator from a wet enclosure to a dry one; the team with the shortest time handling their gator gets a one-hour head-start ahead of the other teams to prep and sell. The winner was '''Frank-n-Slides''' with 9.22 seconds.\n\n<u> Challenge #2</u>: Tyler had the teams create a \"Risky Road Trip\" burger to sell on their trucks. A mystery judge from Sarasota, Chef Joe DiMaggio Jr., will go under the alias \"Nick\" and try all five burgers. The burger Chef DiMaggio thinks is the riskiest and tastiest wins immunity. The winner was '''NOLA Creations'''.\n\n'''Shake Showdown (Week Six)'''\n\nThe final four meet Tyler on Lauderdale Beach where he gives them their first challenge, an on-brand skewer. After the challenge, the two pairs of trucks as a result of the challenges (NOLA Babes and Frank Indulgence), begin selling. NOLA attempts to fuse the Babes' marketing skills with their culinary training, while Rolling and Frank's similarities are what they think will help them. Frank Indulgence hit up a surf shop, while NOLA Babes both have a brewery and a mall to go to. Unfortunately, both of the NOLA Babes' spots are totally dead at first. With Frank Indulgence, they split the market with Frank-n-Slides handling burgers, and Rolling handling desserts and drinks. Both pairs move to new locations, Frank Indulgence at a crowded brewery, and NOLA Babes at the mall lot; where there are more people than there was at first. On Day 2, the teams sell separately, but like last time, NOLA, Rolling, and the Babes all park at the beach. Meanwhile, Frank-n-Slides get a spot at a mechanics' shop, but sales start slowly. The Babes and Frank's use their respective pineapple and hot dog suits to draw business, with respective successful and not-so-successful results. For the second challenge, the four teams convene at the beach, and were greeted by a call from Tyler and Senior Director of Culinary Innovation for [[Sonic Drive-In]], Mackenzie Gibson. They sent two waiters to give the teams one of the four real ice-cream milkshakes in their hands. The flavors of their milkshakes would be utilized in a dessert challenge.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: Tyler had the teams create a signature skewer in 30 minutes to define their brand. But first, he had them throw javelins at four targets (2 with Surf, 2 with Turf) to determine their protein. Brunch Babes and NOLA Creations had Surf and Frank-n-Slides and Rolling Indulgence had Turf. The winner would be free to select one team to be their business partner for the day, which includes a shared dish and splitting the combined profits 50\u201350. The winner was '''NOLA Creations''', who chose '''Brunch Babes''' as their partner, meaning '''Frank-n-Slides''' and '''Rolling Indulgence''' would team up.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: The teams set up a food truck park at the beach, charging $5 for admission, and selling a dessert inspired by the flavor of their milkshakes ('''Babes''' - ''Strawberry Cheesecake, '''Frank-N-Slides''' - ''Banana, '''NOLA''' - Caramel, '''Rolling''' - Peanut Butter). Patrons vote on their favorite dessert, and the winner had to choose between two options at elimination: Receive $200 overall or get $25 for every vote that was cast for them. The winner was '''Brunch Babes''', who chose the overall $200, which put them in first and saved them from elimination.\n\n'''Miami Meltdown (Week Seven)'''\n\nThe teams meet Tyler and Chef Jorge Alverez of the Stuffed Cuban Restaurant on the beach, standing with a whole slow-roasted crispy pig. That roasted pig will be utilized in the first challenge. Once teams got their pork, Tyler sends them shopping and selling. Rolling Indulgence park at a newly opened beer garden, NOLA Creations lock down an exclusive spot at Panther Coffee on the strip of 2nd Avenue, and a couple blocks down is Brunch Babes at Concrete Beach Winery. With NOLA having grabbed a spot that they wanted, Brunch Babes prepare a batch of doughnuts and take them to the coffee shop. NOLA and the Babes confront each other as the Babes question if NOLA actually have exclusivity, which they do. Tyler pulls up at the trucks and asks what it would mean to win ''The Great Food Truck Race''. NOLA to restart their business after [[Hurricane Katrina]], Rolling Indulgence for Drew and Jess to start their lives together, and Brunch Babes for Lara to show her children that you keep chasing your dreams. NOLA begins to party thanks to a trumpeter playing \"[[When The Saints Go Marching In]]\" as Day 1 ends. Day 2 rolls in: Rolling gets a spot at a classic car club, NOLA goes back to Panther Coffee, and Brunch Babes prep their menu, yet have no location. The Babes later call up Rolling to partner up at the car club, hoping two trucks can drum up customers to both of them. Tyler calls the teams for the second challenge, which involves coffee. While Rolling and the Babes have sweet desserts and drinks to use the beans, NOLA attempted to go savory, but problems with the grinder leaves them with the sweet route. And to get more business, Travis and Mariah borrow the club owner's golf cart to advertise the trucks. When that fails, the Babes get a spot at at the winery, while Rolling is still left with no patrons. And in the last hour with no one at the coffee shop, Anna brings 30 French-Ghanaian students to NOLA.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: To determine which team gets which part, the three tams had to build a tower with the full 56 amount of [[dominoes]] they had at their station. The team that completes their tower the fastest gets first pick of the pig. From fastest to slowest, '''NOLA Creations''' was the fastest and chose the Saddle, '''Brunch Babes''' was second and picked the Ham, and '''Rolling Indulgence''' were the slowest and were left with the Shoulder.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</u>: The teams would use their meat in a challenge to sell the most pork dishes for $300 in their till. The team that sold the most dishes was '''Brunch Babes'''.\n\n<u>Challenge #3</u>: The teams were given [[Cuban coffee]] beans, a [[burr-grinder]], and a [[moka pot]] courtesy of Panther Coffee. The challenge ordered the teams to use coffee in one of their dishes, with the team selling the most coffee-infused plates winning another $300. '''Brunch Babes''' won the challenge and the week.\n\n'''Key Lime Clash (Week Eight)'''\n\nThe final two convene at the piers to meet Tyler and his friend, Kelly Friend, with Kelly's family and four conch shells in front of them. Tyler gives the two teams a little history about the [[Florida Keys]] and that the early natives came up with 27 ways to eat [[conch]], which was involved in the first challenge. Once done, the teams hit the stores, and seem to have trouble; NOLA Creations can't seem to find the right boiled peanut, so they were left with a peanut sauce, while the Brunch Babes have trouble complying with the high protein prices. Luckily, the butcher gives them restaurant prices. With a small city that has small streets, food truck driving is tough, but the teams pull through. NOLA lands a spot in front of a rum distillery, and the Babes get into a parking lot behind a jewelry store on Duval Street, but have trouble getting in thanks to a tree with low branches. Nonetheless, they get into the lot, and both teams start selling. However, for NOLA, Anna starts taking orders early again, but they catch up with demand. Brunch Babes has a crowd of the lot owner's friends and are selling, but it later goes quiet for a short time. As Lara works on the menu, she gets a surprise visit from her and Mariah's mother and Lydia's aunt/Godmother. The lunch rush dies down, but the finalists do what they can to draw people in; from NOLA's beads to the Babes' flips, ribbons, and pineapple suit. On Day 2, NOLA Creations decide to add an omelet to the menu as an homage to the Brunch Babes. But again, Anna brings in early orders. Tyler later approaches the trucks with friend and Miami restaurateur Michael Schwartz, and a box with four spiny lobster tails that they had to use in another challenge. NOLA feels as if they keep undermining the Brunch Babes, so now they begin to hustle it. With a dessert challenge now initiated and $1,100 in challenges on the line, the final two need to push themselves to the limit if they want to win $50,000.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: The two teams chose one of their members to blow one of the conch shells, and Kelly would judge them on three categories: Tone Quality, Creativity and Loudness. The winner would choose one challenge dish they and their opponent had sold in the past to sell as a special. '''Brunch Babes''' won and chose their ''Babes Burger'' from Fort Myers, while '''NOLA Creations''' were given the ''Blackened Chicken Sandwich w/ Boiled Peanut Vinaigrette'' from Hilton Head Island.\n\n<u>Challenge #2</U>: The two teams had to sell their \"Greatest Hits\" special that was chosen for them on Day 1 of Key West, and the team that makes the most profit from their special gets $400 in the till. The winner was '''Brunch Babes'''.\n\n<u>Challenge #3</u>: The finalists were given one hour to make them a dish with the [[spiny lobster]] tails that Tyler and Michael would taste. The dish doesn't have to go on the menu, and will be given an extra $300 in their till. The winner was '''NOLA Creations'''.\n\n<u>Challenge #4</u>: The teams were delivered the ingredients for a [[key lime pie]], courtesy of the Key West Key Lime Pie Company, and had to make a dessert with them that isn't a pie. The teams also had to make sure their dessert is worth at least $3. The team who sold the most key lime not-a-pie desserts gets another $400 added to their till. The winner was '''NOLA Creations''' by nine orders, resulting them in winning the \"Summer Beach Battle\".\n\n===Results===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+Food Truck Elimination Table\n|-\n!

With a hanger housing their food trucks, a private plane, and seven covered plates of proteins, the first challenge of the season begins. Once the challenge was over, Everyone received $400 in seed money and made their way to the grocery store. After a little Black Friday-like shopping spree, they drove to their arranged spots on [[Ocean Avenue (Santa Monica)|Ocean Ave.]] by [[Palisades Park (Santa Monica)|Palisades Park]]. As they prep, with Mystikka Masala having a one hour head-start, Tyler stops by to see how the rookies are doing. As he does, he notices the mess Bachelor Kitchen has made, lecturing them on sanitation and threatening to relieve them of their ruck if they don't treat it with respect. Day 1 gets rolling, and so does everyone. The Lunch Ladies' message, Bachelor Kitchen's samples, and Navin bringing out his drag queen persona are utilized in order to find customers. Before tomorrow comes by, Tyler gifts everyone a bottle of champagne, but not for what they think. Day 2: Everyone's on their own, finding their own spots in Los Angeles. As they work on their menu and the challenge dish, the teams start to find the struggles as food truck vendors, having a hard time finding customers. But that won't stop them from getting a rush or clientele before the first elimination\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: The seven teams have 30 minutes to make an hors d'oeuvre fit for a private jet. At the start of the challenge, teams will grab one covered plate that features the main protein ([[Sirloin steak]]).

And in the aftermath, Dooley, Carina, Crystal, and Stephan were to be pulled of their respective trucks. The teams get prepping and selling as four of them wait for their penalty to be called upon. And while most teams were able to have successful partnerships and crowds with local businesses, Crystal's eats up more time to sell as they move from spot to spot. It gets worse when Crystal and the other chosen members is pulled off near the end of the day. Tomorrow: The teams come aboard their trucks with a crate of octopus, which they will use for their next challenge. As they battle with time, for customers, for turf, the judge for the octopus challenge arrives earlier than some teams expect, especially for those who plan on cooking the mollusk for a long time. As the teams take on the lunch rush, Stephan suddenly gets a personal call, something that will affect the whole team.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: The teams must team up in pairs and have one hour to create a meal consisting of an entree, side, and signature beverage for 60 members of the club.

So thy decide to lighten the load with a simple menu. But it doesn't seem simple when John caused an accidental flare-up, due to the propane switches being left on; searing some of John's arm hair, too. Team Fat Kid find themselves in the same boat as they have to put up with modifications in their orders. The next day, after some restocking and forcibly paying with out of their income, Tyler surprises them with a call for their next challenge involving cacti (but it's technically agave). Bachelor's go back to their challenge strategy of selling the special, and the Lunch Ladies prep in an empty parking lot waiting for the promised customers their location guaranteed, and Mariah of Season 10's Brunch Babes Truck visits Team Fat Kid.\n\n<u>Challenge #1</u>: The teams will have 9 minutes to create an elegant, signature salad that they will make on a tramcar of the [[Palm Springs Aerial Tramway]] to the top of the mountain.

In early May 1854, four men\u2014Thomas W. and Oliver P. Barber, Samuel Walker, and Thomas M. Pearson\u2014made a tour of the new territory with the intention of finding a good place to settle. These men passed over what would become Lawrence, passing up on the spur of the hill of what is now Mt. Oread. The Kansas-Nebraska Act passed while they were in the territory, and they were instrumental in convincing others to come.<ref name=cordley2and3>Cordley (1895), pp. 2{{en dash}}3.</ref> In his book ''A History of Lawrence'' (1895), Cordley wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The most systematic and extensive movement [to populate Kansas], however, was made [by] \"[[New England Emigrant Aid Company|The New England Emigrant Aid Company]]\" ... The men engaged in it, [[Eli Thayer]] [a Republican in the United States House of Representatives], [[Amos Adams Lawrence|Amos A. Lawrence]] [a [[GOP|Republican]] abolitionist and businessman], and others, began their work at once, arousing public interest and making arrangements to facilitate emigration to Kansas. As early as June, 1854, they sent Dr. [[Charles L. Robinson|Charles Robinson]], of [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts|Fitchburg]], and Mr. [[Charles Branscomb|Charles H. Branscomb]], of [[Holyoke]], to explore the territory and select a site for a colony ... [Previously] Robinson [had journeyed to Kansas, during which] his party climbed the hill along this spur, and looked off over what was afterwards the site of Lawrence. They marked the beauty of the spot and the magnificence of the view. Whether they thought then of what might afterwards occur is not known; but when the time came to select a location for the first colony, Dr. Robinson remembered this view from the hilltop, and this doubtless had much to do in the final decision. When he was asked, therefore, to go and explore the country with a view to locating colonies, it was not altogether an unknown land to him.<ref name=cordley3and4>Cordley (1895), pp. 3{{en dash}}4.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBranscomb was tasked with exploring the Kansas River up to about the location of [[Fort Riley]], whereas Robinson scouted land near [[Fort Leavenworth]] and the nearby [[Leavenworth, KS|city of the same name]]; after assessing the territory that they had surveyed, the two recommended that the New England Emigrant Aid Company (NEEAC) send its settlers to claim territory along the Oregon Trail near Hogback Ridge.<ref name=cordley4and5>Cordley (1895), pp. 4{{en dash}}5.</ref><ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Lawrence\">Andreas (1883), pp. 312{{en dash}}14.</ref> The two likely chose this site because it was the \"first desirable location where emigrant Indians had ceded their land rights.\"<ref>Freedom's Frontier (n.d.), p. 21.</ref> The area was also attractive because it was close to not only on the Oregon Trail, but also the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]] and the 1846 Military Trails.<ref>[[Federal Highway Administration]] (2002), p.

Unfortunately, a [[cholera]] outbreak in the [[Missouri River Valley|Missouri Valley]] prevented this from happening.<ref>Andreas (1883), p. 312.</ref> In the end, a small group of only twenty-nine men{{em dash}}a group that Eli Thayer would later call the \"pioneer colony\"{{em dash}}volunteered for the job.<ref name=cordley4and5 /> Led by Branscomb, these pioneers left [[Boston]], Massachusetts and set out for Kansas Territory on July 17, 1854; according to Thayer's antislavery newspaper the ''Kansas Crusader for Freedom'': \"Immense crowds had gathered [in Boston] at the station to give them a parting God-speed.

Thomas J. Ferril, a free-state Methodist preacher from Missouri; however, his assailants had surrounded his house, threatening violence and to destroy his property, had retreated upon seeing a body of armed free-staters without injury to either side. The next day, a free-state man's tent was torn down by a woman. Pro-slavery men rallied to prevent the tent's reconstruction, which was being performed by a group of about 20 armed free-staters, but it was completed without any violence. However, the next day, a considerable band of pro-slavery men had appeared threatening a repeat of the attack, but upon seeing their opponents ready, the pro-slavery men retreated with renewed threats of vengeance.<ref name=biennialreport />\n\nWhen the settlers first arrived, most had referred to their fledgling city simply as \"Wakarusa\" (after the nearby river of the same name), but other names were being considered, like \"New Boston\" (in recognition of both the NEEAC's city of operation and the hometown of many early settlers)<ref name=biennialreport /> and \"Plymouth\" (after [[Plymouth Rock]]).<ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Lawrence\" /><ref name=cordley10>Cordley (1895), p. 10.</ref> Meanwhile, settlers from Missouri derisively referred to it as \"[[Yankee]] Town\", due to its New England connections.<ref name=biennialreport /> Another name considered around this time was \"Lawrence\".<ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Lawrence\" /> Many approved of this name because it would honor [[Amos Adams Lawrence]], an [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]]-based businessman and noted abolitionist, who, Cordley writes, was \"a man of wide personal influence\" and \"one of the first men of means\" to fund the Emigrant Aid Company.<ref name=cordley10 /> Others hoped that by giving their town Lawrence's name, he would be inclined to support them with monetary donations, which supposition proved correct.<ref>Bisel (2012), p. 32.</ref> Another factor that made \"Lawrence\" a popular choice was that it was unbesmirched, having \"no bad odor attached to it in any part of the Union.\"<ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Lawrence\" /> Consequently, on October 1,<ref name=biennialreport /> the settlement's leaders voted to approve \"Lawrence\" as the name of their new city, and on October 17, the citizens drew territory lots so as to begin erecting homes and businesses.<ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Lawrence\" /><ref name=\"claims\" /> Around this time, the Lawrence settlers got into a heated argument with proslavery land-squatters, who were hoping to establish a city named \"Excelsior\" on the land where Lawrence was being constructed.

Secret societies, called Blue Lodges, were created, and their sole purpose was to make Kansas a slave state. Their plan was to come into Kansas on the day of the election and vote so as to gain control of the legislature.<ref name=cordley28and29>Cordley (1895), p. 28{{endash}}29.</ref> Before the election, a census was conducted.

There were only 2,905 legal voters in the territory, but 6,307 votes were cast.<ref name=cordley32>Cordley (1895), p. 32.</ref> The people appealed to Governor Andrew Reeder to set the election aside, to which he agreed initially, but after being threatened by pro-slavery people, he decided instead to hold another election in districts in which there were protests, such as Lawrence. The people of Lawrence felt this did nothing, and many were uncertain about what would happen or what they needed to do.<ref name=cordley33>Cordley (1895), p. 33.</ref> \n\nIn June 1855, a meeting was held in Lawrence, at which resolutions were adopted intending to resist any laws that may be passed by the legislature, and they declared that the legislature was elected by \"armed usurpers from Missouri.\"<ref name=biennialreport /> This paved the way for a larger convention on June 25. Between June 8 and August 15, 1855, seven meetings were held in Lawrence for the purposes of resisting the legislature.<ref name=cordley35>Cordley (1895), p. 35.</ref> The free-state leaders sent George W.

Then on November 21, 1855, the proslavery settler Franklin N. Coleman shot the Free-Stater [[Charles W.

The sheriff sided with his proslavery compatriot and chose to instead arrest Dow's free state affiliate Jacob Branson for [[Breach of the peace|disturbing the peace]]. Branson was quickly rescued by [[Samuel Newitt Wood]] and a gang of Free-Staters by breaking him out of jail.<ref name=wakwarcyc/><ref name=wakwarcyc1/><ref>Bisel (2012), pp. 55{{en dash}}56.</ref> He was rescued at one in the morning, just two hours after the arrest. As the gang of free-staters were heading back, they were unsure of what to do.<ref name=cordley50>Cordley (1895), p. 50.</ref> They consulted with Charles Robinson, and they all realized that the pro-slavery people would label this act of breaking someone out of jail as an insurrection. They realized that the militia would be called to carry out the arrests of those who broke Branson out of jail, but that they would likely use it as an excuse to destroy Lawrence. The rest of the city was unaware of the rescue at this time. It was decided that the men who broke Branson out of jail would need to keep out of the way. Robinson informed the others at a meeting of citizens that morning, to which they agreed.<ref name=cordley51>Cordley (1895), p. 51.</ref> They then started preparing the city for defense.<ref name=crodley52>Cordley (1895), p. 52.</ref>\n\nTo calm the increasingly belligerent settlers, the governor of the Kansas Territory, [[Wilson Shannon]], called on the Kansas militia to intervene and keep the peace. Shannon had intended for the militia to be composed of Kansans, but Jones mustered a small army of 1,200\u20131,500 proslavery men, all but about 50 came from Missouri.<ref name=biennialreport /><ref>Litteer (1987), pp. 13{{en dash}}14.</ref><ref name=wakwarcyc1/><ref name=cordley54>Cordley (1895), p. 54.</ref> When the citizens of Lawrence learned of Jones's army, they raised up a defensive militia of 600\u2013800 men armed with \"[[Beecher's Bibles]]\". Robinson was chosen to direct the city's military operations, the future state senator [[James H. Lane (politician)|James Lane]] was selected as his second-in-command, and a \"committee of safety\" was also created, which organized squads of about 20 men to keep watch over the city. Lawrence was additionally aided by John Brown and his four sons: John Jr., Oliver, Owen, and Watson. Five forts of earthwork or rifle pits were constructed, and a solid defense was prepared. While both sides were ready for a fight, an outright clash between the two militias was prevented at least in part by the harsh Kansas winter. On December 8, Shannon had had enough and ordered representatives from both sides to meet at the proslavery stronghold of Franklin to sign a peace treaty. Terms were agreed to, and eventually, after much persuading, the Missouri army reluctantly left the area.<ref name=biennialreport /><ref name=wakwarcyc>{{cite web|last1=Mullis|first1=Tony|title=Wakarusa War|url=http://www.civilwaronthewesternborder.org/content/wakarusa-war|website=Civil War on the Western Border: The Missouri-Kansas Conflict, 1854\u20131865|accessdate=September 5, 2015|date=April 22, 2013}}</ref><ref name=wakwarcyc1>{{cite web|url=http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/1912/w/wakarusa_war.html |title=Wakarusa War {{en dash}} KS-Cyclopedia {{en dash}} 1912 |publisher=Skyways.Lib.KS.us |accessdate=May 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512061914/http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/1912/w/wakarusa_war.html |archivedate=May 12, 2012 }}</ref><ref>Fitzgerald (1988), pp. 74{{en dash}}75.</ref> This conflict, despite its rather diminutive size and scale, would later be known as the \"[[Wakarusa War]]\".<ref name=wakwarcyc1 />\n\n[[File:Sacking-lawrence.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[The Eldridge Hotel|Free State Hotel]] after the 1856 [[Sacking of Lawrence]]]]\n\nIn the spring of 1856, the proslavery forces, hoping to diminish the power of the anti-slavery settlers, singled out the ''Kansas Free State'', the ''Herald of Freedom'', and the [[The Eldridge Hotel|Free State Hotel]] (the latter of which was owned and operated by the NEEAC) as \"nuisances\" that needed to be stopped.<ref name=\"Cutler Newspapers\" /> On April 23, 1856 Sheriff Jones entered into Lawrence and attempted to arrest about a dozen members of the extralegal [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-State]] legislature (a [[Opposition (politics)|rogue governing body]] which had been set up in opposition to the official proslavery territorial government).

During the [[American Civil War]] it was also the site of the [[Lawrence massacre]] (1863).\n\nLawrence began as a center of [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|free-state]] politics. Its economy diversified into many industries, including agriculture, manufacturing, and education, beginning with the founding of the University of Kansas in 1865 and Haskell Indian Nations University in 1884.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|History of Kansas}}\n\n===Settlement and early years===\nPrior to [[Kansas Territory]] being established in May 1854, most of [[Douglas County, Kansas|Douglas County]] was part of the [[Shawnee]] [[Shawnee Methodist Mission|Indian Reservation]], which had been created in 1830.<ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Settlers\" /><ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.shawnee-tribe.com/History.html |website=[[Shawnee Tribe|The Shawnee Tribe]] |accessdate=August 13, 2018}}</ref> During this period, the [[Oregon Trail]] ran parallel to the [[Kansas River]], roughly through the area where Lawrence would eventually be situated.

In early May 1854, four men\u2014Thomas W. and Oliver P. Barber, Samuel Walker, and Thomas M. Pearson\u2014made a tour of the new territory with the intention of finding a good place to settle. These men passed over what would become Lawrence, passing up on the spur of the hill of what is now Mt. Oread. The Kansas-Nebraska Act passed while they were in the territory, and they were instrumental in convincing others to come.<ref name=cordley2and3>Cordley (1895), pp. 2{{en dash}}3.</ref> In his book ''A History of Lawrence'' (1895), Cordley wrote:\n\n<blockquote>The most systematic and extensive movement [to populate Kansas], however, was made [by] \"[[New England Emigrant Aid Company|The New England Emigrant Aid Company]]\" ... The men engaged in it, [[Eli Thayer]] [a Republican in the United States House of Representatives], [[Amos Adams Lawrence|Amos A. Lawrence]] [a [[GOP|Republican]] abolitionist and businessman], and others, began their work at once, arousing public interest and making arrangements to facilitate emigration to Kansas. As early as June, 1854, they sent Dr. [[Charles L. Robinson|Charles Robinson]], of [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts|Fitchburg]], and Mr. [[Charles Branscomb|Charles H. Branscomb]], of [[Holyoke]], to explore the territory and select a site for a colony ... [Previously] Robinson [had journeyed to Kansas, during which] his party climbed the hill along this spur, and looked off over what was afterwards the site of Lawrence. They marked the beauty of the spot and the magnificence of the view. Whether they thought then of what might afterwards occur is not known; but when the time came to select a location for the first colony, Dr. Robinson remembered this view from the hilltop, and this doubtless had much to do in the final decision. When he was asked, therefore, to go and explore the country with a view to locating colonies, it was not altogether an unknown land to him.<ref name=cordley3and4>Cordley (1895), pp. 3{{en dash}}4.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBranscomb was tasked with exploring the Kansas River up to about the location of [[Fort Riley]], whereas Robinson scouted land near [[Fort Leavenworth]] and the nearby [[Leavenworth, KS|city of the same name]]; after assessing the territory that they had surveyed, the two recommended that the New England Emigrant Aid Company (NEEAC) send its settlers to claim territory along the Oregon Trail near Hogback Ridge.<ref name=cordley4and5>Cordley (1895), pp. 4{{en dash}}5.</ref><ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Lawrence\">Andreas (1883), pp. 312{{en dash}}14.</ref> The two likely chose this site because it was the \"first desirable location where emigrant Indians had ceded their land rights.\"<ref>Freedom's Frontier (n.d.), p. 21.</ref> The area was also attractive because it was close to not only on the Oregon Trail, but also the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]] and the 1846 Military Trails.<ref>[[Federal Highway Administration]] (2002), p.

Unfortunately, a [[cholera]] outbreak in the [[Missouri River Valley|Missouri Valley]] prevented this from happening.<ref>Andreas (1883), p. 312.</ref> In the end, a small group of only twenty-nine men{{em dash}}a group that Eli Thayer would later call the \"pioneer colony\"{{em dash}}volunteered for the job.<ref name=cordley4and5 /> Led by Branscomb, these pioneers left [[Boston]], Massachusetts and set out for Kansas Territory on July 17, 1854; according to Thayer's antislavery newspaper the ''Kansas Crusader for Freedom'': \"Immense crowds had gathered [in Boston] at the station to give them a parting God-speed.

Thomas J. Ferril, a free-state Methodist preacher from Missouri; however, his assailants had surrounded his house, threatening violence and to destroy his property, had retreated upon seeing a body of armed free-staters without injury to either side. The next day, a free-state man's tent was torn down by a woman. Pro-slavery men rallied to prevent the tent's reconstruction, which was being performed by a group of about 20 armed free-staters, but it was completed without any violence. However, the next day, a considerable band of pro-slavery men had appeared threatening a repeat of the attack, but upon seeing their opponents ready, the pro-slavery men retreated with renewed threats of vengeance.<ref name=biennialreport />\n\nWhen the settlers first arrived, most had referred to their fledgling city simply as \"Wakarusa\" (after the nearby river of the same name), but other names were being considered, like \"New Boston\" (in recognition of both the NEEAC's city of operation and the hometown of many early settlers)<ref name=biennialreport /> and \"Plymouth\" (after [[Plymouth Rock]]).<ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Lawrence\" /><ref name=cordley10>Cordley (1895), p. 10.</ref> Meanwhile, settlers from Missouri derisively referred to it as \"[[Yankee]] Town\", due to its New England connections.<ref name=biennialreport /> Another name considered around this time was \"Lawrence\".<ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Lawrence\" /> Many approved of this name because it would honor [[Amos Adams Lawrence]], an [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]]-based businessman and noted abolitionist, who, Cordley writes, was \"a man of wide personal influence\" and \"one of the first men of means\" to fund the Emigrant Aid Company.<ref name=cordley10 /> Others hoped that by giving their town Lawrence's name, he would be inclined to support them with monetary donations, which supposition proved correct.<ref>Bisel (2012), p. 32.</ref> Another factor that made \"Lawrence\" a popular choice was that it was unbesmirched, having \"no bad odor attached to it in any part of the Union.\"<ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Lawrence\" /> Consequently, on October 1,<ref name=biennialreport /> the settlement's leaders voted to approve \"Lawrence\" as the name of their new city, and on October 17, the citizens drew territory lots so as to begin erecting homes and businesses.<ref name=\"Cutler Douglas Lawrence\" /><ref name=\"claims\" /> Around this time, the Lawrence settlers got into a heated argument with proslavery land-squatters, who were hoping to establish a city named \"Excelsior\" on the land where Lawrence was being constructed.

Their plan was to come into Kansas on the day of the election and vote so as to gain control of the legislature.<ref name=cordley28and29>Cordley (1895), p. 28{{endash}}29.</ref> Before the election, a census was conducted.

They realized that the militia would be called to carry out the arrests of those who broke Branson out of jail, but that they would likely use it as an excuse to destroy Lawrence. The rest of the city was unaware of the rescue at this time. It was decided that the men who broke Branson out of jail would need to keep out of the way. Robinson informed the others at a meeting of citizens that morning, to which they agreed.<ref name=cordley51>Cordley (1895), p. 51.</ref> They then started preparing the city for defense.<ref name=crodley52>Cordley (1895), p. 52.</ref>\n\nTo calm the increasingly belligerent settlers, the governor of the Kansas Territory, [[Wilson Shannon]], called on the Kansas militia to intervene and keep the peace. Shannon had intended for the militia to be composed of Kansans, but Jones mustered a small army of 1,200\u20131,500 proslavery men, all but about 50 came from Missouri.<ref name=biennialreport /><ref>Litteer (1987), pp. 13{{en dash}}14.</ref><ref name=wakwarcyc1/><ref name=cordley54>Cordley (1895), p. 54.</ref> When the citizens of Lawrence learned of Jones's army, they raised up a defensive militia of 600\u2013800 men armed with \"[[Beecher's Bibles]]\". Robinson was chosen to direct the city's military operations, the future state senator [[James H. Lane (politician)|James Lane]] was selected as his second-in-command, and a \"committee of safety\" was also created, which organized squads of about 20 men to keep watch over the city. Lawrence was additionally aided by John Brown and his four sons: John Jr., Oliver, Owen, and Watson. Five forts of earthwork or rifle pits were constructed, and a solid defense was prepared. While both sides were ready for a fight, an outright clash between the two militias was prevented at least in part by the harsh Kansas winter. On December 8, Shannon had had enough and ordered representatives from both sides to meet at the proslavery stronghold of Franklin to sign a peace treaty. Terms were agreed to, and eventually, after much persuading, the Missouri army reluctantly left the area.<ref name=biennialreport /><ref name=wakwarcyc>{{cite web|last1=Mullis|first1=Tony|title=Wakarusa War|url=http://www.civilwaronthewesternborder.org/content/wakarusa-war|website=Civil War on the Western Border: The Missouri-Kansas Conflict, 1854\u20131865|accessdate=September 5, 2015|date=April 22, 2013}}</ref><ref name=wakwarcyc1>{{cite web|url=http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/1912/w/wakarusa_war.html |title=Wakarusa War {{en dash}} KS-Cyclopedia {{en dash}} 1912 |publisher=Skyways.Lib.KS.us |accessdate=May 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512061914/http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/1912/w/wakarusa_war.html |archivedate=May 12, 2012 }}</ref><ref>Fitzgerald (1988), pp. 74{{en dash}}75.</ref> This conflict, despite its rather diminutive size and scale, would later be known as the \"[[Wakarusa War]]\".<ref name=wakwarcyc1 />\n\n[[File:Sacking-lawrence.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[The Eldridge Hotel|Free State Hotel]] after the 1856 [[Sacking of Lawrence]]]]\n\nIn the spring of 1856, the proslavery forces, hoping to diminish the power of the anti-slavery settlers, singled out the ''Kansas Free State'', the ''Herald of Freedom'', and the [[The Eldridge Hotel|Free State Hotel]] (the latter of which was owned and operated by the NEEAC) as \"nuisances\" that needed to be stopped.<ref name=\"Cutler Newspapers\" /> On April 23, 1856 Sheriff Jones entered into Lawrence and attempted to arrest about a dozen members of the extralegal [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-State]] legislature (a [[Opposition (politics)|rogue governing body]] which had been set up in opposition to the official proslavery territorial government).
