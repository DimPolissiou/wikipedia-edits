At first, nobody made a connection to the killings, but Mirenkov decided to temporarily hide.

It is one of two species in the genus ''[[Azadirachta]]'', and is native to the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It is typically grown in [[tropical]] and semi-tropical regions. Neem trees also grow in islands located in the southern part of [[Iran]]. Its fruits and seeds are the source of [[neem oil]].\n\n==Description==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=May 2019}}\nNeem is a fast-growing [[tree]] that can reach a height of {{convert|15|\u2013|20|m|ft}}, and rarely {{convert|35|\u2013|40|m|ft}}. It is [[evergreen]], but in severe [[drought]] it may shed most or nearly all of its leaves. The branches are wide and spreading. The fairly dense crown is roundish and may reach a diameter of {{convert|20|\u2013|25|m|ft}}. The neem tree is very similar in appearance to its relative, the [[Chinaberry]] (''[[Melia azedarach]]'').<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234651/ |title = The Tree|publisher = National Academies Press (US)|year = 1992}}</ref>\n\nThe opposite, [[pinnate]] leaves are {{convert|20|-|40|cm|in}} long, with 20 to 30 medium to dark green leaflets about {{convert|3|\u2013|8|cm|in}} long. The terminal leaflet often is missing. The [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]s are short.\n\nThe (white and fragrant) [[flower]]s are arranged in more-or-less drooping [[Axillary bud|axillary]] [[panicle]]s which are up to {{convert|25|cm|in}} long. The [[inflorescence]]s, which branch up to the third degree, bear from 250 to 300 flowers. An individual flower is {{convert|5|\u2013|6|mm|in}} long and {{convert|8|\u2013|11|mm|in}} wide. [[Protantrism|Protandrous]], bisexual flowers and male flowers exist on the same individual tree.\n\nThe [[fruit]] is a smooth ([[Glossary of botanical terms#glabrous|glabrous]]), olive-like [[drupe]] which varies in shape from elongate oval to nearly roundish, and when ripe is {{convert|1.4|-|2.8|cm|in}} by {{convert|1.0|-|1.5|cm|in}}. The fruit skin (exocarp) is thin and the bitter-sweet pulp (mesocarp) is yellowish-white and very fibrous. The mesocarp is {{convert|0.3|-|0.5|cm|in}} thick. The white, hard inner shell (endocarp) of the fruit encloses one, rarely two, or three, elongated [[seed]]s (kernels) having a brown seed coat.\n\n[[File:Azadirachta-indica-2019-5-3 14-14-55-01.jpg|thumb|Pollen grains of ''Azadirachta indica'']]\n\nThe neem tree is often confused with a similar looking tree called [[Melia azedarach|bakain]]. Bakain also has toothed leaflets and similar looking fruit. One difference is that neem leaves are [[Pinnation|pinnate]] but bakain leaves are [[Pinnation#Iteration of divisions|twice- and thrice-pinnate]].\n\n==Etymology==\nNeem (\u0928\u0940\u092e) is a [[Hindi]] noun derived from [[Sanskrit]] Nimba (\u0928\u093f\u0902\u092c).<ref>Compact Oxford English Dictionary (2013), Neem, page 679, Third Edition 2008 reprinted with corrections 2013, Oxford University Press.</ref><ref>[[Henry Yule]] and [[A. C. Burnell]] (1996), [[Hobson-Jobson]], Neem, page 622, The Anglo-Indian Dictionary, Wordsworth Reference. (This work was first published in 1886)</ref><ref>[[Encarta]] World English Dictionary (1999), Neem, page 1210, St. Martin's Press, New York.</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\nThe neem tree is noted for its [[drought resistance]]. Normally it thrives in areas with sub-arid to sub-humid conditions, with an annual rainfall of {{convert|400|-|1200|mm|in}}. It can grow in regions with an annual rainfall below 400&nbsp;mm, but in such cases it depends largely on [[ground water]] levels. Neem can grow in many different types of [[soil]], but it thrives best on well drained deep and sandy soils. It is a typical tropical to subtropical tree and exists at annual mean temperatures of {{convert|21|-|32|C|F}}. It can tolerate high to very high temperatures and does not tolerate temperature below {{convert|4|C|F}}. Neem is one of a very few shade-giving trees that thrive in drought-prone areas e.g. the dry coastal, southern districts of India, and Pakistan. The trees are not at all delicate about water quality and thrive on the merest trickle of water, whatever the quality. In India and tropical countries where the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]] has reached, it is very common to see neem trees used for shade lining streets, around temples, schools and other such public buildings or in most people's back yards. In very dry areas the trees are planted on large tracts of land.\n\n===Weed status===\nNeem is considered a [[weed]] in many areas, including some parts of the [[Middle East]], most of Sub-[[Sahara]]n [[Africa]] including [[West Africa]] and [[Indian Ocean]] states, and some parts of [[Australia]].  Ecologically, it survives well in similar environments to its own, but its weed potential has not been fully assessed.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.daff.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/63168/IPA-Neem-Tree-Risk-Assessment.pdf |title=Plant Risk Assessment, Neem Tree, ''Azadirachta indica'' | year=2008 |accessdate=24 January 2014 |publisher=Biosecurity Queensland}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2015, ''A. indica'' was declared a class B and C weed in the [[Northern Territory]], [[Australia]], meaning its growth and spread must be controlled and plants or propagules are not allowed to be brought into the NT. It is illegal to buy, sell, or transport the plants or seeds. Its declaration as a weed came in response to its invasion of waterways in the \"[[Top End]]\" of the territory.<ref>{{citation|url=http://lrm.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/353104/Neem-declaration_Q-and-A_page-1.pdf |title=Neem has been declared: what you need to know |year=2015 |accessdate=17 March 2015 |publisher=Department of Land Resource Management |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324041536/http://lrm.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/353104/Neem-declaration_Q-and-A_page-1.pdf |archivedate=24 March 2015  }}</ref>\n\nAfter being introduced into Australia, possibly in the 1940s, ''A. indica'' was originally planted in the [[Northern Territory]] to provide shade for cattle. Trial plantations were established between the 1960s and 1980s in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Queensland]], and [[Western Australia]], but the Australian neem industry did not prove viable. The tree has now spread into the savanna, particularly around waterways, and naturalised populations exist in several areas.<ref>{{citation|url=http://lrm.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/353108/Weed-Note-Neem-2014.pdf |title=''Neem'' Azadirachta indica |year=2015 |accessdate=17 March 2015 |publisher=Department of Land Resource Management |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324041528/http://lrm.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/353108/Weed-Note-Neem-2014.pdf |archivedate=24 March 2015  }}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Neem tree farm in south india.jpg|thumb|Neem Tree farm from south India]]\n[[File:Neem.jpg|thumb|A large tree]]\n[[File:Neem tree leaves.JPG|thumb|Leaves]]\n[[File:Bark (5059231711).jpg|thumb|Bark]]\n[[File:Ineem seeds .jpg|thumb|Neem seeds]]\nNeem leaves are dried in India and placed in cupboards to prevent insects eating the clothes, and also in tins where rice is stored.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4916044.stm|title=Neem: India's tree of life|author=Anna Horsbrugh Porter|date=17 April 2006|work=BBC News}}</ref> These flowers are also used in many [[Indian festivals]] like [[Ugadi]].

Neem seeds are ground into powder that is soaked overnight in water and sprayed onto the crop. To be effective, it must be applied repeatedly, at least every ten days. Neem does not directly kill [[insect]]s on the crop. It acts as an anti-feedant, repellent, and egg-laying deterrent and thus protect the crop from damage. The insects starve and die within a few days. Neem also suppresses the hatching of pest insects from their eggs. Neem-based fertilizeres have been effective against the pest [[Spodoptera eridania|southern armyworm]]. Neem cake is often sold as a fertilizer.<ref>[http://web.pppmb.cals.cornell.edu/resourceguide/mfs/08neem.php Material Fact Sheets \u2013 Neem] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212005801/http://web.pppmb.cals.cornell.edu/resourceguide/mfs/08neem.php |date=12 February 2013 }}</ref>\n\n'''Neem oil''' has been shown to avert [[termite]] attack as an ecofriendly and economical agent.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = YashRoy | first1 = R.C. | last2 = Gupta | first2 = P.K. | year = 2000 | title = Neem-seed oil inhibits growth of termite surface-tunnels | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230822367 | journal = Indian Journal of Toxicology | volume = 7 | issue = 1| pages = 49\u201350 }}</ref>\n\n===Neem oil for polymeric resins===\nApplications of neem oil in the preparation of polymeric resins have been documented in the recent reports.

Last updated on 2 October 2015</ref>\n\n==Association with Hindu festivals in India==\nNeem leaf or bark is considered an effective [[Ayurveda|pitta]] pacifier because of its bitter taste. Hence, it is traditionally recommended during early summer in Ayurveda (that is, the month of [[Chaitra]] as per the [[Hindu Calendar]] which usually falls in the month of March \u2013 April).\n\nIn the Indian states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Telangana]], Neem flowers are very popular for their use in 'Ugadi Pachhadi' (soup-like pickle), which is made on [[Ugadi]] day.\nIn [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], and [[Telangana]], a small amount of Neem and [[Jaggery]] (Bevu-Bella) is consumed on [[Ugadi]] day, the [[Telugu people|Telugu]] and [[Kannada people|Kannada]] new year, indicating that one should take both bitter and sweet things in life, joy and sorrow.\n\nDuring [[Gudi Padva]], which is the New Year in the state of Maharashtra, the ancient practice of drinking a small quantity of neem juice or paste on that day, before starting festivities, is found. As in many Hindu festivals and their association with some food to avoid negative side-effects of the season or change of seasons, neem juice is associated with [[Gudi Padwa|Gudi Padva]] to remind people to use it during that particular month or season to pacify summer pitta.\n\nIn [[Tamil Nadu]] during the summer months of April to June, the [[Mariamman]] temple festival is a thousand-year-old tradition. The Neem leaves and flowers are the most important part of the Mariamman festival. The statue of the goddess Mariamman will be garlanded with Neem leaves and flowers. Thus, it is regarded as holy leaves. During most occasions of celebrations and weddings the people of [[Tamil Nadu]] adorn their surroundings with the Neem leaves and flowers as a form of decoration and also to ward off evil spirits and infections. The Tamil people traditionally consider that the various diseases of [[Poxviridae|pox]] and [[measles]] are caused directly by the deity Mariamman herself and use the Neem leaves alone to relieve from infection.\n\nIn the eastern coastal state of [[Odisha]] the famous [[Jagannath]] temple deities are made up of Neem heart wood along with some other essential oils and powders.\n\n==Chemical compounds==\n[[Ayurveda]] was the first to bring the [[anthelmintic]], [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]], [[antibacterial]], and [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]] constituents of the [[neem]] tree to the attention of natural products [[chemist]]s. The process of extracting neem oil involves extracting the water-insoluble components with [[diethyl ether|ether]], [[petrol ether]], [[ethyl acetate]], and dilute [[ethanol|alcohol]]. The provisional naming was ''nimbin'' ([[sulphur]]-free [[crystalline]] product with [[melting point]] at 205&nbsp;\u00b0C, [[empirical]] composition C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), ''nimbinin'' (with similar principle, melting at 192&nbsp;\u00b0C), and ''nimbidin'' (cream-coloured containing [[amorphous]] sulphur, melting at 90\u2013100&nbsp;\u00b0C). Siddiqui identified ''nimbidin'' as the main active [[antibacterial]] ingredient, and the highest yielding bitter component in the neem oil.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Siddiqui, S. |date=1942 |title=A note on the isolation of three new bitter principles from the nim oil |journal=Current Science |volume=11 |issue=7 |pages=278-279 }}</ref> These compounds are stable and found in substantial quantities in the neem.

It is one of two species in the genus ''[[Azadirachta]]'', and is native to the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It is typically grown in [[tropical]] and semi-tropical regions. Neem trees also grow in islands located in the southern part of [[Iran]]. Its fruits and seeds are the source of [[neem oil]].\n\n==Description==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=May 2019}}\nNeem is a fast-growing [[tree]] that can reach a height of {{convert|15|\u2013|20|m|ft}}, and rarely {{convert|35|\u2013|40|m|ft}}. It is [[evergreen]], but in severe [[drought]] it may shed most or nearly all of its leaves. The branches are wide and spreading. The fairly dense crown is roundish and may reach a diameter of {{convert|20|\u2013|25|m|ft}}. The neem tree is very similar in appearance to its relative, the [[Chinaberry]] (''[[Melia azedarach]]'').<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234651/ |title = The Tree|publisher = National Academies Press (US)|year = 1992}}</ref>\n\nThe opposite, [[pinnate]] leaves are {{convert|20|-|40|cm|in}} long, with 20 to 30 medium to dark green leaflets about {{convert|3|\u2013|8|cm|in}} long. The terminal leaflet often is missing. The [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]]s are short.\n\nThe (white and fragrant) [[flower]]s are arranged in more-or-less drooping [[Axillary bud|axillary]] [[panicle]]s which are up to {{convert|25|cm|in}} long. The [[inflorescence]]s, which branch up to the third degree, bear from 250 to 300 flowers. An individual flower is {{convert|5|\u2013|6|mm|in}} long and {{convert|8|\u2013|11|mm|in}} wide. [[Protantrism|Protandrous]], bisexual flowers and male flowers exist on the same individual tree.\n\nThe [[fruit]] is a smooth ([[Glossary of botanical terms#glabrous|glabrous]]), olive-like [[drupe]] which varies in shape from elongate oval to nearly roundish, and when ripe is {{convert|1.4|-|2.8|cm|in}} by {{convert|1.0|-|1.5|cm|in}}. The fruit skin (exocarp) is thin and the bitter-sweet pulp (mesocarp) is yellowish-white and very fibrous. The mesocarp is {{convert|0.3|-|0.5|cm|in}} thick. The white, hard inner shell (endocarp) of the fruit encloses one, rarely two, or three, elongated [[seed]]s (kernels) having a brown seed coat.\n\n[[File:Azadirachta-indica-2019-5-3 14-14-55-01.jpg|thumb|Pollen grains of ''Azadirachta indica'']]\n\nThe neem tree is often confused with a similar looking tree called [[Melia azedarach|bakain]]. Bakain also has toothed leaflets and similar looking fruit. One difference is that neem leaves are [[Pinnation|pinnate]] but bakain leaves are [[Pinnation#Iteration of divisions|twice- and thrice-pinnate]].\n\n==Etymology==\nNeem (\u0928\u0940\u092e) is a [[Hindi]] noun derived from [[Sanskrit]] Nimba (\u0928\u093f\u0902\u092c).<ref>Compact Oxford English Dictionary (2013), Neem, page 679, Third Edition 2008 reprinted with corrections 2013, Oxford University Press.</ref><ref>[[Henry Yule]] and [[A. C. Burnell]] (1996), [[Hobson-Jobson]], Neem, page 622, The Anglo-Indian Dictionary, Wordsworth Reference. (This work was first published in 1886)</ref><ref>[[Encarta]] World English Dictionary (1999), Neem, page 1210, St. Martin's Press, New York.</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\nThe neem tree is noted for its [[drought resistance]]. Normally it thrives in areas with sub-arid to sub-humid conditions, with an annual rainfall of {{convert|400|-|1200|mm|in}}. It can grow in regions with an annual rainfall below 400&nbsp;mm, but in such cases it depends largely on [[ground water]] levels. Neem can grow in many different types of [[soil]], but it thrives best on well drained deep and sandy soils. It is a typical tropical to subtropical tree and exists at annual mean temperatures of {{convert|21|-|32|C|F}}. It can tolerate high to very high temperatures and does not tolerate temperature below {{convert|4|C|F}}. Neem is one of a very few shade-giving trees that thrive in drought-prone areas e.g. the dry coastal, southern districts of India, and Pakistan. The trees are not at all delicate about water quality and thrive on the merest trickle of water, whatever the quality. In India and tropical countries where the [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]] has reached, it is very common to see neem trees used for shade lining streets, around temples, schools and other such public buildings or in most people's back yards. In very dry areas the trees are planted on large tracts of land.\n\n===Weed status===\nNeem is considered a [[weed]] in many areas, including some parts of the [[Middle East]], most of Sub-[[Sahara]]n [[Africa]] including [[West Africa]] and [[Indian Ocean]] states, and some parts of [[Australia]].  Ecologically, it survives well in similar environments to its own, but its weed potential has not been fully assessed.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.daff.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/63168/IPA-Neem-Tree-Risk-Assessment.pdf |title=Plant Risk Assessment, Neem Tree, ''Azadirachta indica'' | year=2008 |accessdate=24 January 2014 |publisher=Biosecurity Queensland}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2015, ''A. indica'' was declared a class B and C weed in the [[Northern Territory]], [[Australia]], meaning its growth and spread must be controlled and plants or propagules are not allowed to be brought into the NT.

Neem seeds are ground into powder that is soaked overnight in water and sprayed onto the crop. To be effective, it must be applied repeatedly, at least every ten days. Neem does not directly kill [[insect]]s on the crop. It acts as an anti-feedant, repellent, and egg-laying deterrent and thus protect the crop from damage. The insects starve and die within a few days. Neem also suppresses the hatching of pest insects from their eggs. Neem-based fertilizeres have been effective against the pest [[Spodoptera eridania|southern armyworm]].

Hence, it is traditionally recommended during early summer in Ayurveda (that is, the month of [[Chaitra]] as per the [[Hindu Calendar]] which usually falls in the month of March \u2013 April).\n\nIn the Indian states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Telangana]], Neem flowers are very popular for their use in 'Ugadi Pachhadi' (soup-like pickle), which is made on [[Ugadi]] day.\nIn [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], and [[Telangana]], a small amount of Neem and [[Jaggery]] (Bevu-Bella) is consumed on [[Ugadi]] day, the [[Telugu people|Telugu]] and [[Kannada people|Kannada]] new year, indicating that one should take both bitter and sweet things in life, joy and sorrow.\n\nDuring [[Gudi Padva]], which is the New Year in the state of Maharashtra, the ancient practice of drinking a small quantity of neem juice or paste on that day, before starting festivities, is found. As in many Hindu festivals and their association with some food to avoid negative side-effects of the season or change of seasons, neem juice is associated with [[Gudi Padwa|Gudi Padva]] to remind people to use it during that particular month or season to pacify summer pitta.\n\nIn [[Tamil Nadu]] during the summer months of April to June, the [[Mariamman]] temple festival is a thousand-year-old tradition. The Neem leaves and flowers are the most important part of the Mariamman festival. The statue of the goddess Mariamman will be garlanded with Neem leaves and flowers. Thus, it is regarded as holy leaves. During most occasions of celebrations and weddings the people of [[Tamil Nadu]] adorn their surroundings with the Neem leaves and flowers as a form of decoration and also to ward off evil spirits and infections. The Tamil people traditionally consider that the various diseases of [[Poxviridae|pox]] and [[measles]] are caused directly by the deity Mariamman herself and use the Neem leaves alone to relieve from infection.\n\nIn the eastern coastal state of [[Odisha]] the famous [[Jagannath]] temple deities are made up of Neem heart wood along with some other essential oils and powders.\n\n==Chemical compounds==\n[[Ayurveda]] was the first to bring the [[anthelmintic]], [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]], [[antibacterial]], and [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]] constituents of the [[neem]] tree to the attention of natural products [[chemist]]s. The process of extracting neem oil involves extracting the water-insoluble components with [[diethyl ether|ether]], [[petrol ether]], [[ethyl acetate]], and dilute [[ethanol|alcohol]]. The provisional naming was ''nimbin'' ([[sulphur]]-free [[crystalline]] product with [[melting point]] at 205&nbsp;\u00b0C, [[empirical]] composition C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), ''nimbinin'' (with similar principle, melting at 192&nbsp;\u00b0C), and ''nimbidin'' (cream-coloured containing [[amorphous]] sulphur, melting at 90\u2013100&nbsp;\u00b0C). Siddiqui identified ''nimbidin'' as the main active [[antibacterial]] ingredient, and the highest yielding bitter component in the neem oil.<ref>Siddiqui (1942). pp. 278\u2013279</ref>{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}} These compounds are stable and found in substantial quantities in the Neem.

Dirkhising''' (May 24, 1986 \u2013 September 26, 1999), also known as '''Jesse Yates''', was an American teenager from [[Prairie Grove, Arkansas]]. He was staying with two men (with his parents\u2019 permission) who bound, drugged, [[torture]]d, and repeatedly [[rape]]d him. He died from drugging and [[positional asphyxia]] during the ordeal.<ref name=\"Lieb\">Lieb</ref><ref name=\"Lawyer to request change\">\"Lawyer to request...\", ''The Washington Times'', Nov. 20, 1999</ref>\n\nDespite his being at their home with approval from his parents, the defense argued he was complicit in the sexual acts, and therefore the death was accidental.  Considering how he was a minor and the men were adults, this was considered unlikely.  Further details revealed in the court case depicted a gruesome death.\n\nDirkhising's death received only regional media coverage until a ''[[Washington Times]]'' article ran a story nearly a month after his death, noting the lack of national coverage in contrast to that given to the 1998 death of [[Matthew Shepard]].<ref name=\"Press Bias and Politics\">Kuypers</ref>{{page needed|date=June 2013}}<!--Maybe near p. 228-229--><ref name=\"Contrasts in media coverage\"/> The Shepard murder was approaching its first anniversary and was getting another round of national attention, coupled with updates on pending [[hate crime laws in the United States|hate crime legislation]].<ref name=\"Why One Murder Make\"/> Prompted by coverage in ''The Washington Times'', the Dirkhising case gained notoriety as [[conservative]] commentators compared [[media coverage]] of the two cases and explored the issues of what was considered a [[hate crime]].<ref name=\"Contrasts in media coverage\"/> The added attention resulted in mainstream media also reporting the Dirkhising case in relation to the coverage of the Shepard case, with many attempting to explain why the two were handled differently by the media, and perhaps received differently by readers.<ref name=\"Press Bias and Politics\"/>{{page needed|date=June 2013}}<!--Maybe near p. 228-229--><ref name=\"Why One Murder Make\"/><ref name=\"Bozell: No Media Spotlight\">Bozell, \"No Media Spotlight ...\"</ref>\n\nThe media coverage of the Dirkhising case was repeatedly and consistently contrasted with that of the high-profile Shepard case, although the cases were dissimilar in several important details.

He was sentenced to [[life in prison]], and this sentence was upheld on [[appeal]] by the Arkansas Supreme Court in September 2003.

It was her ninth World Cup victory of the season, and extended her lead in the overall standings. She has more World Cup victories before the age of 22 than [[Ingemar Stenmark]], the record holder for number of World Cup victories. In [[Squaw Valley Ski Resort|Squaw Valley]], the first World Cup races there since [[1969 Alpine Skiing World Cup|1969]], she won the giant slalom on March 10 and the slalom the following day, taking her to 31 World Cup victories and 11 for the season. This secured her her fourth slalom world cup. In [[Aspen, Colorado]], the World Cup finals of the season took place. Shiffrin secured her first overall World Cup, but did not win the giant slalom World Cup that year. After the season, she received the \"Skieur d\u2019Or\" (golden skier) award, given by the international ski journalist association to the best alpine skier of the year (one award for both genders).{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n===2018 season===\nShiffrin started the 2018 season with a 5th place finish in giant slalom at [[S\u00f6lden]]. In early December she competed in downhill at [[Lake Louise, Alberta|Lake Louise]], where she reached her first downhill podium (3rd place) and the next day she won her first downhill race in her fourth ever start.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:2018 PyeongChang Womens Giant Slalom.jpg|thumb|Giant Slalom, Pyeongchang 2018: [[Ragnhild Mowinckel]] (silver), Shiffrin (gold) and [[Federica Brignone]] (bronze)]]\nBetween December 19 and January 9, Shiffrin won 8 of the 9 races on the World Cup circuit (4 SL, 2 GS, and 2 PSL). She made history winning the very first FIS parallel slalom with the win in [[Courchevel]], [[France]]. Then she won the slalom in Lienz, Austria to finish her 2017 year. She started 2018 with the win in the City Event in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] and became the first women ever with 2 wins in City Event. Two days later she won the slalom in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. With wins in both the giant slalom and slalom at [[Kranjska Gora]], [[Slovenia]], Shiffrin clocked up her 39th and 40th World Cup wins at age 22. She then won the slalom in [[Flachau]], [[Austria]] to equal [[Annemarie Moser-Pr\u00f6ll]]'s record of 41 World Cup wins before 23rd birthday. She also became the first woman in history to win the first 5 World Cup races of a calendar year and the first one in 20 years (since [[Katja Seizinger]]) to win 5 straight World Cup races. After a third place in downhill, things stopped going her way. The rest of January had two 7th places and three races where she did not finish.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAt the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], in [[Pyeongchang]], [[South Korea]] \u2013 after several days of weather postponements, which caused the first three and final two races to be held on consecutive days, Shiffrin won gold in giant slalom as well as silver in super combined. In the giant slalom she finished second after the first run behind Italian Manuela Moelgg, but was able to secure the gold when Moelgg made mistakes on the second run. Due to weather delays, the slalom was contested the day after the giant slalom. Shiffrin entered the heavy favorite as the reigning Olympic champion, three-time consecutive world champion, reigning World Cup champion and the world cup leader in the event. She finished the first run in fourth, and was unable to improve her ranking after the second run, missing the podium after winning every single major slalom title that she entered in her career beforehand. Although she had originally intended to run at least 4 races, she pulled out of the super-G due to it being held the day after slalom, believing that she would not be able to perform well if she did 3 races in as many days. The weather delays also caused the downhill and the super combined to be held on consecutive days, choosing to run only one of the two. Believing she had her best chance at a medal in super combined, she pulled out of the downhill after running all three training runs, her best finish being 5th in the 3rd and final training run. In the super combined, the final individual alpine event on the Olympic schedule, she finished 6th after downhill. However, she was far behind the leader, 1.98 seconds behind compatriot [[Lindsey Vonn]]. However, due to having the 3rd fastest slalom run\u2014and many of the leaders of the first run having mistakes in the second\u2014she was able to move up to the silver medal position behind Michelle Gisin of Switzerland. Her gold and silver medals coming out of the Olympics made her the most decorated American Olympian, the most decorated female alpine skier, and the second most decorated alpine skier overall, only behind Marcel Hirscher of Austria who won two gold medals.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nShiffrin secured her second consecutive [[2018 Alpine Skiing World Cup|World Cup overall title]] on March 9, 2018 with 5 races left in the season. At the World Cup Finals in \u00c5re, Sweden she won the slalom by 1.58 seconds over [[Wendy Holdener]] of Switzerland, her 12th win of the season.

These include slalom, giant slalom, downhill, super-G, combined, and the most recently added, parallel slalom (also called a city event).\n[[Tina Maze]] and [[Lindsey Vonn]] never won a parallel slalom race since its introduction into World Cup competition. With her 1st super-G World Cup win at Lake Louise, Shiffrin become the seventh woman to win in the five more traditional disciplines (not including parallel slalom).

This marked her 5th win out of 9 season races to start the 2018/2019 season. On December 22, 2018, she won the slalom in Courchevel, France and became the youngest skier ever \u2013 female or male \u2013 to win 50 World Cup ski races, at the age of 23 years and nine months.

Shiffrin secured her first overall World Cup, but did not win the giant slalom World Cup that year.

She made history winning the very first FIS parallel slalom with the win in [[Courchevel]], [[France]]. Then she won the slalom in Lienz, Austria to finish her 2017 year. She started 2018 with the win in the City Event in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] and became the first women ever with 2 wins in City Event. Two days later she won the slalom in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. With wins in both the giant slalom and slalom at [[Kranjska Gora]], [[Slovenia]], Shiffrin clocked up her 39th and 40th World Cup wins at age 22. She then won the slalom in [[Flachau]], [[Austria]] to equal [[Annemarie Moser-Pr\u00f6ll]]'s record of 41 World Cup wins before 23rd birthday. She also became the first woman in history to win the first 5 World Cup races of a calendar year and the first one in 20 years (since [[Katja Seizinger]]) to win 5 straight World Cup races. After a third place in downhill, things stopped going her way. The rest of January had two 7th places and three races where she did not finish.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAt the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], in [[Pyeongchang]], [[South Korea]] \u2013 after several days of weather postponements, which caused the first three and final two races to be held on consecutive days, Shiffrin won gold in giant slalom as well as silver in super combined. In the giant slalom she finished second after the first run behind Italian Manuela Moelgg, but was able to secure the gold when Moelgg made mistakes on the second run. Due to weather delays, the slalom was contested the day after the giant slalom. Shiffrin entered the heavy favorite as the reigning Olympic champion, three-time consecutive world champion, reigning World Cup champion and the world cup leader in the event. She finished the first run in fourth, and was unable to improve her ranking after the second run, missing the podium after winning every single major slalom title that she entered in her career beforehand. Although she had originally intended to run at least 4 races, she pulled out of the super-G due to it being held the day after slalom, believing that she would not be able to perform well if she did 3 races in as many days. The weather delays also caused the downhill and the super combined to be held on consecutive days, choosing to run only one of the two. Believing she had her best chance at a medal in super combined, she pulled out of the downhill after running all three training runs, her best finish being 5th in the 3rd and final training run. In the super combined, the final individual alpine event on the Olympic schedule, she finished 6th after downhill. However, she was far behind the leader, 1.98 seconds behind compatriot [[Lindsey Vonn]]. However, due to having the 3rd fastest slalom run\u2014and many of the leaders of the first run having mistakes in the second\u2014she was able to move up to the silver medal position behind Michelle Gisin of Switzerland. Her gold and silver medals coming out of the Olympics made her the most decorated American Olympian, the most decorated female alpine skier, and the second most decorated alpine skier overall, only behind Marcel Hirscher of Austria who won two gold medals.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nShiffrin secured her second consecutive [[2018 Alpine Skiing World Cup|World Cup overall title]] on March 9, 2018 with 5 races left in the season.

In the 5th century, Tolosa fell to the [[Visigothic kingdom]] and became one of its major cities, in the early 6th century even serving as its capital, before it fell to the [[Francia|Franks]] under [[Clovis I|Clovis]] in 507 ([[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]).\nFrom this time, Toulouse was the capital of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] within the Frankish realm. {{Cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 721, [[Odo the Great|Duke Odo]] of [[Aquitaine]] defeated an invading [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Muslim]] army at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]]. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into [[Christendom|Christian Europe]], incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with [[Charles Martel]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Tours]], also called the Battle of Poitiers)<ref>https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k415420b/f39.</ref>. \n\nThe Frankish conquest of [[Septimania]] followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent [[County of Toulouse]] emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The [[Battle of Toulouse (844)|Battle of Toulouse of 844]], pitting [[Charles the Bald]] against [[Pepin II of Aquitaine]], was key in the Carolingian Civil War.\n\n===County of Toulouse===\n{{further|County of Toulouse}}\n[[File:Raymond IV of Toulouse.jpg|thumb|[[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]] was a leader of the [[First Crusade]]]]\nThe town became the capital of the [[County of Toulouse]] during the [[Carolingian era]].\n\nIn 1096, [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse]], left with his army at the call of the Pope to join the [[First Crusade]], of which he was one of the main leaders.\n\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth century the county of Toulouse was taken in another crusade, of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of [[Catharism]] in the south of France, which the Pope wanted to eradicate by all possible means. This struggle took on several aspects, going beyond the [[Albigensian Crusade|military crusade]], such as the creation of an original and militant Gothic architecture: the [[Southern French Gothic]]. \n\nIn 1215 the [[Dominican Order]] was founded in Toulouse by [[Saint Dominic]] in the context of struggle against the Cathar heresy.\n\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1229)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress [[Joan, Countess of Toulouse|Joan]] was engaged to [[Alphonse, Count of Poitiers]], a younger brother of [[Louis IX of France]]. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance.\nAlso in 1229, [[University of Toulouse]] was established after the [[University of Paris|Parisian model]], intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nVarious monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of ''fr\u00e8res pr\u00eacheurs'', were started. They found home in [[Church of the Jacobins|''Les Jacobins'']]. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}} In parallel, a long period of inquisition began inside the Toulouse walls.

(Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.) \n\nBaudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its [[Airbus]] operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of [[Languedoc]] and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the [[fleur de lis]] of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the [[History of Toulouse|counts of Toulouse]] were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (''Halle aux Grains'') was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the [[Bemberg Foundation]] (European paintings and [[Bronze sculpture|bronzes]] from the [[Renaissance]] to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (''Z\u00e9nith'', the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park ''[[Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace]]'' was founded, etc.\n\nTo deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched. Line A of the [[Rapid transit|underground]] was opened in 1993, and line B opened in 2007. The creation of a system of underground car parking structures in Toulouse city centre was sharply criticised by the [[The Greens (France)|Green Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonjourlafrance.com/france-city/toulouse-france/toulouse-politics.htm |title=Toulouse politics information |publisher=Bonjourlafrance.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, Dominique Baudis was at the zenith of his popularity, with approval rates of 85%. {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} He announced that he would not run for a fourth (6-year) term in 2001. He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the [[French Revolution]]; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]], then [[Union for French Democracy|UDF]] mayor of [[Lourdes]] as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA (''[[Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel]]'') in Paris, the French equivalent of the American [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]].\n\nPhilippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the [[AZF (factory)|AZF]] plant in late 2001.\n\nIn March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command [[Jean-Luc Moudenc]], elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate [[Pierre Cohen]].\n\nAt the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes.\n\n===Mayors===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

With more than two hundred relics (including six apostles), most of them donated by [[Charlemagne]] to the sanctuary that preceded the present church, Saint-Sernin makes Toulouse the second city in Europe after Rome for the number of relics. The church was built at the end of the 11th century and at the beginning of the 12th century to welcome the crowds of pilgrims, its double-sided aisles and the ambulatory surrounding the apse make it the archetype of the great pilgrimage church, where pilgrims could make the circuit around the church and were able to stop for meditation and prayer at the apsidal chapels of the transept and the radiating chapels of the choir.\n\n[[Toulouse Cathedral|Cathedral of Saint Stephen]] is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toulouse]]. Its construction, which was mainly done at the beginning and then at the end of the 13th century, reflects the history of this decisive century which saw the city lose its independence to become a French city. The single nave is the very first example of [[Southern French Gothic]], at 19 metres wide it probably was at its completion the largest in Western Europe (1210-1220). The higher choir that adjoins it was built in the Gothic style of northern France shortly after the city became part of the Crown of France in 1271.\n\nThe [[Church of the Jacobins|convent of the Jacobins]] (late 13th century / early 14th century) is considered to be, together with the [[Albi Cathedral]], the pinnacle of [[Southern French Gothic]] architecture. Like all Southern French Gothic churches it has a deliberately austere exterior, but it reveals the beauty of its architecture on the inside with an alignment of columns that are said to be the highest in Gothic architecture (28 metres high). The masterpiece of this church is the column that closes the choir (1292), its palm tree shape was a hundred years ahead of the flamboyant gothic fan vaults. Because he thought it was the most beautiful Dominican church in Europe, and perhaps also to compensate Toulouse, the birthplace of the [[Dominican order]], for not having obtained the relics of [[Saint Dominic]] kept in Bologna, [[Pope Urban V]] made the church of the Jacobins the burial place of the Dominican friar [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]], one of the most famous philosophers and theologians of the Middle Ages.\n\n===Civilian buildings===\n[[File:Vx-raisin_(2).jpg|thumb|Renaissance windows at the [[H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin]] (16th C.)]]\n\nThe [[Capitole de Toulouse]] (mainly 18th century), houses the H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) and the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole]] (opera house). It is located on the [[Place du Capitole]], a large 19th century square that has the size of a royal square (''place royale''). The large neo-classical facade of the 18th century (1750-1760) hides elements from various periods: the Henri IV courtyard of the early 17th century with a remarkable Renaissance portal; a 16th century tower, called \u00abthe keep\u00bb (''le donjon''), which housed the archives of the [[Capitouls]]; vast rooms and galleries with walls painted to the glory of the history of Toulouse (late 19th century)...\n\nToulouse has also preserved a rich civil architectural heritage from the medieval and Renaissance periods. Forty or so Gothic and Renaissance stair towers still dot the city, mostly hidden in inner courtyards. More than two hundred mansions (called ''[[h\u00f4tel particulier|h\u00f4tels particuliers]]'') or remains of mansions give an account of the evolution of civil architecture since the 12th century. The most remarkable are those of the Renaissance, a period which constitutes a golden age for Toulouse. Among these are the [[H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat]], the [[H\u00f4tel de Bernuy]], the [[H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin]], the [[H\u00f4tel de Bagis]]...\n\n=== Some other sights ===\n[[File:Le_pont_Neuf_\u00e0_Toulouse.jpg|thumb|The [[Pont Neuf, Toulouse|Pont-Neuf]] (16th-17th c.)]]\n\nThe banks of the [[Garonne|Garonne river]] offer an interesting urban panorama of the city. Red brick dykes from the 18th century enclose the river which is subject to violent floods. The only bridge to have withstood the floods of the past is the [[Pont Neuf, Toulouse|Pont-Neuf]], it took almost a century to build it as the project was so ambitious (1545-1632). Further downstream, the [[Bazacle]] is a ford across the [[Garonne]] river, in the 12th century the [[Bazacle Milling Company]] was the first recorded European joint-stock company. On the left bank of the river, historically a flood-prone bank, stand two former hospitals whose origins date back to the 12th century: the H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques and the [[H\u00f4pital de La Grave]]. This is how the plague victims and other sick people were kept away from the city by the river.\n\nBuilt at the end of the 17th century, the [[Canal du Midi]] bypasses the city centre and has linked Toulouse to the Mediterranean Sea ever since. Its 240 kilometres were inscribed as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 1996.\n\nThe ''[[Jardin des Plantes, Toulouse|Jardin des Plantes]]'' is a large park spanning several blocks, including the museum of Natural History, caf\u00e9s, activities for children and a [[botanical garden]] (early 19th century). \n\nThe [[Cit\u00e9 de l'espace]] (Space City) is a [[theme park]] of space exploration.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Sights and monuments of Toulouse\">\nSaint_Sernin.jpg|[[Saint-Sernin basilica]] and [[church of the Jacobins]]\nBasilique Saint-Sernin de Toulouse - exposition ouest-1-.jpg|[[Saint-Sernin basilica]] (11th\u201313th c.)\nChevet de St Sernin.jpg|[[Saint-Sernin basilica]] (11th\u201313th c.)\nFa\u00e7ade nord de la cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Toulouse.jpg|[[Toulouse Cathedral|Saint \u00c9tienne cathedral]] (13th\u201317th c.)\nNef-jacobins-toulouse.jpg|[[Church of the Jacobins]] (13th c.)\nEglise des Jacobins toulouse.jpg|[[Church of the Jacobins]] \"palm tree\" vault (13th c.)\nClo\u00eetre et clocher des Jacobins.jpg|[[Church of the Jacobins]] bell tower (13th c.) and cloister (14th c.)\nImmeuble dit Maison romano-gothique - Toulouse.jpg|Romano-gothic house (14th c.)\nAugustins - Grand clo\u00eetre et clocher des Augustins de Toulouse.jpg|[[Mus\u00e9e des Augustins]] former convent (14th c.) housing a fine arts museum \nAugustins - Gargouilles de l'ancienne \u00e9glise des Cordeliers.jpg|[[Mus\u00e9e des Augustins]] cloister (14th c.) with display of [[gargoyles]] salvaged from demolished churches\nEglise Notre-Dame du Taur - Facade.jpg|Church of [[Notre-Dame du Taur]]: clocher-mur facade (14th c.)\n2 rue Saint-Rome - Tour Serta.jpg|Serta tower (15th\u201316th c.)\nToulouse - Maison Pierre Delfau - Fa\u00e7ade.jpg|H\u00f4tel Delfau (15th c.)\nMus\u00e9e_Saint-Raymond_-_Toulouse.jpg|Saint-Raymond museum, former college of the university (1523)\nCapitole Toulouse - Le donjon.jpg|Former tower of the [[Capitouls]] (1525)\nBachelier - H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat - Toulouse - La cour d'honneur.jpg|Renaissance courtyard of the [[H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat]] (16th c.)\nAssezat-02(12).jpg|Renaissance portal of the [[h\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat]] (16th c.)\nFelzins-facade.jpg|Renaissance portal of the [[H\u00f4tel de Felzins|h\u00f4tel Molinier]](16th c.)\nAncien petit S\u00e9minaire de l'Esquile.jpg|Renaissance portal (16th c.) of a college of the [[University of Toulouse|University]]\nToulouse-portail-dalbade.jpg|Renaissance Portal of the Dalbade Church (16th c.)\nHotel_de_Bagis_-_Porte_des_vieillards.jpg|[[H\u00f4tel de Bagis]]' Renaissance door (16th or 17th c.)\nCapitole de Toulouse - Cour Henri IV - portail de Nicolas Bachelier.jpg|[[Capitole de Toulouse|Capitole]]'s Renaissance portal in the courtyard (16th-17th c.)\nToulouse-portail-Fermat.jpg|Renaissance portal of the former Jesuit college (1605)\nToulouse-portail-bernuy.jpg|Gothic and Renaissance portal of the [[h\u00f4tel de Bernuy]] (16th c.)\nCour de Bernuy.jpg|Renaissance courtyard of the [[H\u00f4tel de Bernuy]] (16th c.)\nBernuy-tour1.jpg|[[H\u00f4tel de Bernuy]] tower (16th c.)\nH\u00f4tel d'Arnaud de Brucelles - La tour.jpg|[[H\u00f4tel de Brucelles]] tower (16th c.)\nH\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin.jpg|[[H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin]] (16th c.)\nL'h\u00f4tel du vieux raisin.jpg|[[H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin]] Renaissance courtyard (16th c.)\nLe Pont-Neuf de Toulouse.jpg|[[Pont Neuf, Toulouse|Pont neuf]] (16th\u201317th c.)\nH\u00f4tel Pierre Com\u00e8re.jpg|H\u00f4tel Com\u00e8re (17th c.)\nHotel de Caulet-Resseguier (Toulouse).jpg|H\u00f4tel de Resseguier (17th c.)\nBonfontan-06(1).jpg|H\u00f4tel de Bonfontan (18th c.)\nH\u00f4tel d'Espie.JPG|H\u00f4tel d'Espie (18th c.)\nCapitole-27.jpg|[[Capitole de Toulouse|Capitole]] \u2013 city hall (18th c.)\nJuin 012(1).jpg|Capitole square (19th c.)\nMaison en terre cuite de Virebent, rue des Marchands.jpg|Immeuble des Cariatides, terracotta fa\u00e7ade by [[:fr:Auguste Virebent]] (19th c.)\nMaison Lamothe (Toulouse).jpg|Lamothe house, terracotta fa\u00e7ade (19th c.)\nHalle aux grains Toulouse.jpg|Halle aux Grains concert hall (19th c.)

In the 5th century, Tolosa fell to the [[Visigothic kingdom]] and became one of its major cities, in the early 6th century even serving as its capital, before it fell to the [[Francia|Franks]] under [[Clovis I|Clovis]] in 507 ([[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]]).\nFrom this time, Toulouse was the capital of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] within the Frankish realm. {{Cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn 721, [[Odo the Great|Duke Odo]] of [[Aquitaine]] defeated an invading [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Muslim]] army at the [[Battle of Toulouse (721)|Battle of Toulouse]]. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into [[Christendom|Christian Europe]], incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with [[Charles Martel]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Tours]], also called the Battle of Poitiers)<ref>https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k415420b/f39.</ref>. \n\nThe Frankish conquest of [[Septimania]] followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent [[County of Toulouse]] emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century.

The reason for this was the development of [[Catharism]] in the south of France, which the Pope wanted to eradicate by all possible means. This struggle took on several aspects, going beyond the [[Albigensian Crusade|military crusade]], such as the creation of an original and militant Gothic architecture: the [[Southern French Gothic]]. \n\nIn 1215 the [[Dominican Order]] was founded in Toulouse by [[Saint Dominic]] in the context of struggle against the Cathar heresy.\n\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1229)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress [[Joan, Countess of Toulouse|Joan]] was engaged to [[Alphonse, Count of Poitiers]], a younger brother of [[Louis IX of France]]. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance.\nAlso in 1229, [[University of Toulouse]] was established after the [[University of Paris|Parisian model]], intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nVarious monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of ''fr\u00e8res pr\u00eacheurs'', were started.

(Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.) \n\nBaudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its [[Airbus]] operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of [[Languedoc]] and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the [[fleur de lis]] of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the [[History of Toulouse|counts of Toulouse]] were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (''Halle aux Grains'') was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the [[Bemberg Foundation]] (European paintings and [[Bronze sculpture|bronzes]] from the [[Renaissance]] to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (''Z\u00e9nith'', the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park ''[[Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace]]'' was founded, etc.\n\nTo deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched.

He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the [[French Revolution]]; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]], then [[Union for French Democracy|UDF]] mayor of [[Lourdes]] as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA (''[[Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel]]'') in Paris, the French equivalent of the American [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]].\n\nPhilippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the [[AZF (factory)|AZF]] plant in late 2001.\n\nIn March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command [[Jean-Luc Moudenc]], elected mayor by the municipal council.

With more than two hundred relics (including six apostles), most of them donated by [[Charlemagne]] to the sanctuary that preceded the present church, Saint-Sernin makes Toulouse the second city in Europe after Rome for the number of relics. The church was built at the end of the 11th century and at the beginning of the 12th century to welcome the crowds of pilgrims, its double-sided aisles and the ambulatory surrounding the apse make it the archetype of the great pilgrimage church, where pilgrims could make the circuit around the church and were able to stop for meditation and prayer at the apsidal chapels of the transept and the radiating chapels of the choir.\n\n[[Toulouse Cathedral|Cathedral of Saint Stephen]] is the seat of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toulouse]]. Its construction, which was mainly done at the beginning and then at the end of the 13th century, reflects the history of this decisive century which saw the city lose its independence to become a French city. The single nave is the very first example of [[Southern French Gothic]], at 19 metres wide it probably was at its completion the largest in Western Europe (1210-1220). The higher choir that adjoins it was built in the Gothic style of northern France shortly after the city became part of the Crown of France in 1271.\n\nThe [[Church of the Jacobins|convent of the Jacobins]] (late 13th century / early 14th century) is considered to be, together with the [[Albi Cathedral]], the pinnacle of [[Southern French Gothic]] architecture. Like all Southern French Gothic churches it has a deliberately austere exterior, but it reveals the beauty of its architecture on the inside with an alignment of columns that are said to be the highest in Gothic architecture (28 metres high). The masterpiece of this church is the column that closes the choir (1292), its palm tree shape was a hundred years ahead of the flamboyant gothic fan vaults. Because he thought it was the most beautiful Dominican church in Europe, and perhaps also to compensate Toulouse, the birthplace of the [[Dominican order]], for not having obtained the relics of [[Saint Dominic]] kept in Bologna, [[Pope Urban V]] made the church of the Jacobins the burial place of the Dominican friar [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]], one of the most famous philosophers and theologians of the Middle Ages.\n\n===Civilian buildings===\n[[File:Vx-raisin_(2).jpg|thumb|Renaissance windows at the [[H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin]] (16th C.)]]\n\nThe [[Capitole de Toulouse]] (mainly 18th century), houses the H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) and the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole]] (opera house). It is located on the [[Place du Capitole]], a large 19th century square that has the size of a royal square (''place royale''). The large neo-classical facade of the 18th century (1750-1760) hides elements from various periods: the Henri IV courtyard of the early 17th century with a remarkable Renaissance portal; a 16th century tower, called \u00abthe keep\u00bb (''le donjon''), which housed the archives of the [[Capitouls]]; vast rooms and galleries with walls painted to the glory of the history of Toulouse (late 19th century)...\n\nToulouse has also preserved a rich civil architectural heritage from the medieval and Renaissance periods. Forty or so Gothic and Renaissance stair towers still dot the city, mostly hidden in inner courtyards. More than two hundred mansions (called ''[[h\u00f4tel particulier|h\u00f4tels particuliers]]'') or remains of mansions give an account of the evolution of civil architecture since the 12th century. The most remarkable are those of the Renaissance, a period which constitutes a golden age for Toulouse. Among these are the [[H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat]], the [[H\u00f4tel de Bernuy]], the [[H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin]], the [[H\u00f4tel de Bagis]]...\n\n=== Some other sights ===\n[[File:Le_pont_Neuf_\u00e0_Toulouse.jpg|thumb|The [[Pont Neuf, Toulouse|Pont-Neuf]] (16th-17th c.)]]\n\nThe banks of the [[Garonne|Garonne river]] offer an interesting urban panorama of the city. Red brick dykes from the 18th century enclose the river which is subject to violent floods. The only bridge to have withstood the floods of the past is the [[Pont Neuf, Toulouse|Pont-Neuf]], it took almost a century to build it as the project was so ambitious (1545-1632). Further downstream, the [[Bazacle]] is a ford across the [[Garonne]] river, in the 12th century the [[Bazacle Milling Company]] was the first recorded European joint-stock company. On the left bank of the river, historically a flood-prone bank, stand two former hospitals whose origins date back to the 12th century: the H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques and the [[H\u00f4pital de La Grave]]. This is how the plague victims and other sick people were kept away from the city by the river.\n\nBuilt at the end of the 17th century, the [[Canal du Midi]] bypasses the city centre and has linked Toulouse to the Mediterranean Sea ever since. Its 240 kilometres were inscribed as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 1996.\n\nThe ''[[Jardin des Plantes, Toulouse|Jardin des Plantes]]'' is a large park spanning several blocks, including the museum of Natural History, caf\u00e9s, activities for children and a [[botanical garden]] (early 19th century). \n\nThe [[Cit\u00e9 de l'espace]] (Space City) is a [[theme park]] of space exploration.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Sights and monuments of Toulouse\">\nSaint_Sernin.jpg|[[Saint-Sernin basilica]] and [[church of the Jacobins]]\nBasilique Saint-Sernin de Toulouse - exposition ouest-1-.jpg|[[Saint-Sernin basilica]] (11th\u201313th c.)\nChevet de St Sernin.jpg|[[Saint-Sernin basilica]] (11th\u201313th c.)\nFa\u00e7ade nord de la cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Toulouse.jpg|[[Toulouse Cathedral|Saint \u00c9tienne cathedral]] (13th\u201317th c.)\nNef-jacobins-toulouse.jpg|[[Church of the Jacobins]] (13th c.)\nEglise des Jacobins toulouse.jpg|[[Church of the Jacobins]] \"palm tree\" vault (13th c.)\nClo\u00eetre et clocher des Jacobins.jpg|[[Church of the Jacobins]] bell tower (13th c.) and cloister (14th c.)\nImmeuble dit Maison romano-gothique - Toulouse.jpg|Romano-gothic house (14th c.)\nAugustins - Grand clo\u00eetre et clocher des Augustins de Toulouse.jpg|[[Mus\u00e9e des Augustins]] former convent (14th c.) housing a fine arts museum \nAugustins - Gargouilles de l'ancienne \u00e9glise des Cordeliers.jpg|[[Mus\u00e9e des Augustins]] cloister (14th c.) with display of [[gargoyles]] salvaged from demolished churches\nEglise Notre-Dame du Taur - Facade.jpg|Church of [[Notre-Dame du Taur]]: clocher-mur facade (14th c.)\n2 rue Saint-Rome - Tour Serta.jpg|Serta tower (15th\u201316th c.)\nToulouse - Maison Pierre Delfau - Fa\u00e7ade.jpg|H\u00f4tel Delfau (15th c.)\nMus\u00e9e_Saint-Raymond_-_Toulouse.jpg|Saint-Raymond museum, former college of the university (1523)\nCapitole Toulouse - Le donjon.jpg|Former tower of the [[Capitouls]] (1525)\nBachelier - H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat - Toulouse - La cour d'honneur.jpg|Renaissance courtyard of the[[H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat]] (16th c.)\nAssezat-02(12).jpg|Renaissance portal of the [[h\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat]] (16th c.)\nFelzins-facade.jpg|Renaissance portal of the [[H\u00f4tel de Felzins|h\u00f4tel Molinier]](16th c.)\nAncien petit S\u00e9minaire de l'Esquile.jpg|Renaissance portal (16th c.) of a college of the [[University of Toulouse|University]]\nToulouse-portail-dalbade.jpg|Renaissance Portal of the Dalbade Church (16th c.)\nHotel_de_Bagis_-_Porte_des_vieillards.jpg|[[H\u00f4tel de Bagis]]' Renaissance door (16th or 17th c.)\nCapitole de Toulouse - Cour Henri IV - portail de Nicolas Bachelier.jpg|[[Capitole de Toulouse|Capitole]]'s Renaissance portal in the courtyard (16th-17th c.)\nToulouse-portail-Fermat.jpg|Renaissance portal of the former Jesuit college (1605)\nToulouse-portail-bernuy.jpg|Gothic and Renaissance portal of the [[h\u00f4tel de Bernuy]] (16th c.)\nCour de Bernuy.jpg|Renaissance courtyard of the [[H\u00f4tel de Bernuy]] (16th c.)\nBernuy-tour1.jpg|[[H\u00f4tel de Bernuy]] tower (16th c.)\nH\u00f4tel d'Arnaud de Brucelles - La tour.jpg|[[H\u00f4tel de Brucelles]] tower (16th c.)\nH\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin.jpg|[[H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin]] (16th c.)\nL'h\u00f4tel du vieux raisin.jpg|[[H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin]] Renaissance courtyard (16th c.)\nLe Pont-Neuf de Toulouse.jpg|[[Pont Neuf, Toulouse|Pont neuf]] (16th\u201317th c.)\nH\u00f4tel Pierre Com\u00e8re.jpg|H\u00f4tel Com\u00e8re (17th c.)\nHotel de Caulet-Resseguier (Toulouse).jpg|H\u00f4tel de Resseguier (17th c.)\nBonfontan-06(1).jpg|H\u00f4tel de Bonfontan (18th c.)\nH\u00f4tel d'Espie.JPG|H\u00f4tel d'Espie (18th c.)\nCapitole-27.jpg|[[Capitole de Toulouse|Capitole]] \u2013 city hall (18th c.)\nJuin 012(1).jpg|Capitole square (19th c.)\nMaison en terre cuite de Virebent, rue des Marchands.jpg|Immeuble des Cariatides, terracotta fa\u00e7ade by [[:fr:Auguste Virebent]] (19th c.)\nMaison Lamothe (Toulouse).jpg|Lamothe house, terracotta fa\u00e7ade (19th c.)\nHalle aux grains Toulouse.jpg|Halle aux Grains concert hall (19th c.)
