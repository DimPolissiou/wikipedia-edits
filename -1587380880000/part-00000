On devices sporting the needed sensor, heart activity can be sampled automatically through the day or on demand (\"OK Google, what's my heart rate\"). Step-counting, calorie expenditure etc. are also monitored. These features work within the Fit ecosystem, allowing integration with companion devices and applications.

Currently new [[Text messaging|SMS]] can be initiated from the watch. Wear OS 5.1.1 supports drawing to reply, which uses AI to interpret the user's sketch as an emoji character.  Search by voice is fully supported. [[Google Now]] searches such as \"How tall is [[Nicole Kidman]]\" result in [[Knowledge Graph]] cards appearing on screen, with options to open the search result on another device.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIf the phone's camera app is activated, the screen is relayed to the watch, and the user can control the shutter, and view photos on the watch. Third-party applications support using the phone camera as a streaming device, or more varied camera control.\n\nEvents appear as cards on screen. \"OK Google, show my agenda\" will display the user's agenda. Watch faces also support marking out appointments (for instance with contrasting color to show periods with an appointment, and/or illuminating a lighted \"count-down\" line for upcoming appointments.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNote taking is fully supported via [[Google Keep]] and other note-apps, as is marking-off check lists etc. Via voice commands such as \"OK Google, remind me to call Roy at work\", or \"Remind me to baste the chicken in 25 minutes\" the user can create location and time-based reminders, set alarms, timers etc. which appear on the watch at the appropriate time or place.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMany applications have been released, with developers such as [[Evernote]] etc. creating new functionality on the watch: for instance, handing off notes to the watch screen when the user turns off their phone screen.

On devices sporting the needed sensor, heart activity can be sampled automatically through the day or on demand (\"OK Google, what's my heart rate\").

Currently new [[Text messaging|SMS]] can be initiated from the watch. Wear OS 5.1.1 supports drawing to reply, which uses AI to interpret the user's sketch as an emoji character.  Search by voice is fully supported. [[Google Now]] searches such as \"How tall is [[Nicole Kidman]]\" result in [[Knowledge Graph]] cards appearing on screen, with options to open the search result on another device.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIf the phone's camera app is activated, the screen is relayed to the watch, and the user can control the shutter, and view photos on the watch. Third-party applications support using the phone camera as a streaming device, or more varied camera control.\n\nEvents appear as cards on screen. \"OK Google, show my agenda\" will display the user's agenda. Watch faces also support marking out appointments (for instance with contrasting color to show periods with an appointment, and/or illuminating a lighted \"count-down\" line for upcoming appointments.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nNote taking is fully supported via [[Google Keep]] and other note-apps, as is marking-off check lists etc. Via voice commands such as \"OK Google, remind me to call Roy at work\", or \"Remind me to baste the chicken in 25 minutes\" the user can create location and time-based reminders, set alarms, timers etc. which appear on the watch at the appropriate time or place.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMany applications have been released, with developers such as [[Evernote]] etc. creating new functionality on the watch: for instance, handing off notes to the watch screen when the user turns off their phone screen.

It was released on October 4, 2007, by [[Epic Records]]. Inspired by her marriage with [[Marc Anthony]] and taking influences by [[Jamiroquai]] and [[Sade (band)|Sade]], ''Brave'' features prominently samples from 1970s songs, and incorporates [[funk]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] music. ''Brave'' sees Lopez working with new collaborators, such as [[Ryan Tedder]], [[Midi Mafia]], [[Jonathan Rotem|J.R. Rotem]], [[Bloodshy]], Lynn & Wade LLP, [[The Clutch]] and others, while also working with long-time collaborator [[Cory Rooney]] throughout the album.\n\nThe album received a mixed reception from critics, with some complimenting its production, calling the album one of her strongest albums to date, while many called it a formulaic and bland album. The album underperformed commercially, becoming her first album to miss the top ten on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, while also missing the top twenty in the UK, Australia, and other markets. It has sold only 650,000 copies worldwide.\n\nThe album spawned two worldwide singles: \"[[Do It Well]]\" and \"[[Hold It Don't Drop It]]\".

It was released on October 4, 2007, by [[Epic Records]]. Inspired by her marriage with [[Marc Anthony]] and taking influences by [[Jamiroquai]] and [[Sade (band)|Sade]], ''Brave'' features prominently samples from 1970s songs, and incorporates [[funk]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] music. ''Brave'' sees Lopez working with new collaborators, such as [[Ryan Tedder]], [[Midi Mafia]], [[Jonathan Rotem|J.R. Rotem]], [[Bloodshy]], Lynn & Wade LLP, [[The Clutch]] and others, while also working with long-time collaborator [[Cory Rooney]] throughout the album.\n\nThe album received a mixed reception from critics, with some complimenting its production, calling the album one of her strongest albums to date, while many called it a formulaic and bland album. The album underperformed commercially, becoming her first album to miss the top ten on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, while also missing the top twenty in the UK, Australia, and other markets. It has sold only 650,000 copies worldwide.\n\nThe album spawned two worldwide singles: \"[[Do It Well]]\" and \"[[Hold It Don't Drop It]]\". The first received generally favorable reviews, but peaked modesty on the charts, reaching the top-twenty in some countries, but only peaking at number 31 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, while the latter also received positive reaction, but did not make any significant impact on the charts.

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of

A year later, Japanese Prime Minister [[Nobusuke Kishi]] announced that Japan intended to sponsor the establishment of a regional development fund with resources largely from Japan and other industrial countries. But the US did not warm to the plan and the concept was shelved. See full account in  \"[https://www.adb.org/publications/50-years-adb Banking on the Future of Asia and the Pacific: 50 Years of the Asian Development Bank],\" July 2017.\n\nThe idea came up again late in 1962 when Kaoru Ohashi, an economist from a research institute in Tokyo, visited [[Takeshi Watanabe (bureaucrat)|Takeshi Watanabe]], then a private financial consultant in Tokyo, and proposed a study group to form a development bank for the Asian region. The group met regularly in 1963, examining various scenarios for setting up a new institution and drew on Watanabe's experiences with the [[World Bank]]. However, the idea received a cool reception from the World Bank itself and the study group became discouraged.\n\nIn parallel, the concept was formally proposed at a trade conference organized by the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) in 1963 by a young Thai economist, Paul Sithi-Amnuai. (ESCAP, United Nations Publication March 2007, \"The first parliament of Asia\" pp.&nbsp;65). Despite an initial mixed reaction, support for the establishment of a new bank soon grew.\n\nAn expert group was convened to study the idea, with Japan invited to contribute to the group. When Watanabe was recommended, the two streams proposing a new bank\u2014from ECAFE and Japan\u2014came together. Initially, the US was on the fence, not opposing the idea but not ready to commit financial support. But a new bank for Asia was soon seen to fit in with a broader program of assistance to Asia planned by U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in the wake of the escalating US military support for the government of South Vietnam.\n\nAs a key player in the concept, Japan hoped that the ADB offices would be in Tokyo. However, eight other cities had also expressed an interest\u2014Bangkok, Colombo, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Phnom Penh, Singapore, and Tehran. To decide, the 18 prospective regional members of the new bank held three rounds of votes at a ministerial conference in Manila in November/December 1965. In the first round on 30 November, Tokyo failed to win a majority, so a second ballot was held the next day at noon. Although Japan was in the lead, it was still inconclusive, so a final vote was held after lunch. In the third poll, Tokyo gained eight votes to Manila's nine, with one abstention. Therefore, Manila was declared the host of the new development bank. The Japanese were mystified and deeply disappointed. Watanabe later wrote in his personal history of ADB: \"I felt as if the child I had so carefully reared had been taken away to a distant country.\" (Asian Development Bank publication, \"Towards a New Asia\", 1977, p.&nbsp;16)\n\nAs intensive work took place during 1966 to prepare for the opening of the new bank in Manila, high on the agenda was choice of president. Japanese Prime Minister [[Eisaku Sat\u014d]] asked Watanabe to be a candidate. Although he initially declined, pressure came from other countries and Watanabe agreed. In the absence of any other candidates, Watanabe was elected first President of the Asian Development Bank at its Inaugural Meeting on 24 November 1966.\n\nBy the end of 1972, Japan had contributed $173.7 million (22.6% of the total) to the ordinary capital resources and $122.6 million (59.6% of the total) to the special funds. In contrast, the United States contributed only $1.25 million to the special fund.<ref name=\"Ming Wan\" />\n\nAfter its creation in the 1960s, ADB focused much of its assistance on food production and rural development. At the time, Asia was one of the poorest regions in the world.<ref name=\"admin\">{{Cite web|title = ADB History|url = http://www.adb.org/about/history|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}</ref>\n\nEarly loans went largely to [[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[South Korea]] and the [[Philippines]]; these nations accounted for 78.48% of the total ADB loans between 1967 and 1972. Moreover, Japan received tangible benefits, 41.67% of the total procurements between 1967 and 1976. Japan tied its special funds contributions to its preferred sectors and regions and procurements of its goods and services, as reflected in its $100 million donation for the Agricultural Special Fund in April 1968.<ref name=\"Ming Wan\" />\n\nWatanabe served as the first ADB president to 1972.<ref name=\"KapurLewis\">{{cite book|author1=Devesh Kapur|author2=John Prior Lewis|author3=Richard Charles Webb|title=The World Bank: Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=suOGRlBoPgQC&pg=PA304|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=0-8157-2014-9|pages=304\u2013|date=2010-12-01}}</ref><ref name=\"Magill2014\">{{cite book|author=Frank N.

The gradual emergence of Asian economies in the latter part of the decade spurred demand for better infrastructure to support economic growth. ADB focused on improving roads and providing electricity. When the world suffered its first oil price shock, ADB shifted more of its assistance to support energy projects, especially those promoting the development of domestic energy sources in member countries.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nFollowing considerable pressure from the Reagan Administration in the 1980s, ADB reluctantly began working with the private sector in an attempt to increase the impact of its development assistance to poor countries in Asia and the Pacific. In the wake of the second oil crisis, ADB expanded its assistance to energy projects. In 1982, ADB opened its first field office, in [[Bangladesh]], and later in the decade it expanded its work with non-government organizations (NGOs).<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nJapanese presidents Inoue Shiro (1972\u201376) and Yoshida Taroichi (1976\u201381) took the spotlight in the 1970s. Fujioka Masao, the fourth president (1981\u201390), adopted an assertive leadership style, launching an ambitious plan to expand the ADB into a high-impact development agency.\n\n===1990s===\nIn the 1990s, ADB began promoting regional cooperation by helping the countries on the Mekong River to trade and work together. The decade also saw an expansion of ADB's membership with the addition of several Central Asian countries following the end of the Cold War.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nIn mid-1997, ADB responded to the financial crisis that hit the region with projects designed to strengthen financial sectors and create social safety nets for the poor. During the crisis, ADB approved its largest single loan \u2013 a $4 billion emergency loan to the South Korea. In 1999, ADB adopted poverty reduction as its overarching goal.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\n===2000s===\n\nThe early years of 2000s saw a dramatic expansion of private sector finance. While the institution had such operations since the 1980s (under pressure from the Reagan Administration) the early attempts were highly unsuccessful with low lending volumes, considerable losses and financial scandals associated with an entity named AFIC. However, beginning in 2002, the ADB undertook a dramatic expansion of private sector lending under a new team. Over the course of the next six years, the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) grew by a factor of 41 times the 2001 levels of new financings and earnings for the ADB. This culminated with the Board's formal recognition if these achievements in March 2008, when the Board of Directors formally adopted the Long Term Strategic Framework (LTSF). That document formally stated that assistance to private sector development was the lead priority of the ADB and that it should constitute 50% of the bank's lending by 2020.\n\nIn 2003, the [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS) epidemic hit the region and ADB responded with programs to help the countries in the region work together to address infectious diseases, including [[avian influenza]] and HIV/[[AIDS]]. ADB also responded to a multitude of natural disasters in the region, committing more than $850 million for recovery in areas of India, Indonesia, Maldives, and Sri Lanka which were impacted by the December 2004 Asian tsunami. In addition, $1 billion in loans and grants was provided to the victims of the October 2005 earthquake in Pakistan.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nIn 2009, ADB's Board of Governors agreed to triple ADB's capital base from $55 billion to $165 billion, giving it much-needed resources to respond to the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|global economic crisis]]. The 200% increase is the largest in ADB's history, and was the first since 1994.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\n===2010s===\nAsia moved beyond the economic crisis and by 2010 had emerged as a new engine of global economic growth though it remained home to two-thirds of the world's poor. In addition, the increasing prosperity of many people in the region created a widening [[income gap]] that left many people behind. ADB responded to this with loans and grants that encouraged economic growth.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nIn early 2012, the ADB began to re-engage with [[Myanmar]] in response to reforms initiated by the government. In April 2014, ADB opened an office in Myanmar and resumed making loans and grants to the country.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nIn 2017, ADB combined the lending operations of its Asian Development Fund (ADF) with its ordinary capital resources (OCR).  The result was to expand the OCR balance sheet to permit increasing annual lending and grants to $20 billion by 2020 \u2014 50% more than the previous level.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\n==Objectives and activities==\n\n===Aim===\nThe ADB defines itself as a [[Social change|social development]] organization that is dedicated to reducing [[poverty]] in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive [[economic growth]], environmentally [[sustainable growth]], and [[regional integration]]. This is carried out through [[investment]]s \u2013 in the form of loans, grants and information sharing \u2013 in infrastructure, health care services, financial and public administration systems, helping nations prepare for the impact of [[climate change]] or better [[natural resource management|manage their natural resources]], as well as other areas.\n\n===Focus areas===\nEighty percent of ADB's lending is concentrated public sector lending in five operational areas.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Core Operational Areas|url = http://www.adb.org/about/core-operational-areas|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* [[Education]] \u2013 Most developing countries in Asia and the Pacific have earned high marks for a dramatic rise in primary education enrollment rates in the last three decades, but daunting challenges remain, threatening economic and social growth.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Education|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/education/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Environment, Climate Change, and Disaster Risk Management \u2013 [[Environmental sustainability]] is a prerequisite for economic growth and poverty reduction in Asia and the Pacific.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Environment, Climate Change, and Disaster Risk Management|url = http://www.adb.org/themes/environment/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Finance Sector Development \u2013 The financial system is the lifeline of a country's economy. It creates prosperity that can be shared throughout society and benefit the poorest and most vulnerable people. Financial sector and capital market development, including microfinance, small and medium-sized enterprises, and regulatory reforms, is vital to decreasing poverty in Asia and the Pacific.This has been a key priority of the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD)since 2002. One of the most active sub-sectors of finance is the PSOD's support for trade finance. Each year the PSOD finances billions of dollars in letters of credit across all of Asia and the rest of the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Finance Sector Development|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/finance/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Infrastructure, including transport<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sustainable Transport for All|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/transport/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> and communications,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Information and Communications Technology|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/ict/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> energy,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Energy|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/energy/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> water supply and sanitation,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Water for All|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/water/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> and urban development.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Urban Development|url = http://www.adb.org/themes/urban-development/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Regional Cooperation and Integration \u2013 Regional cooperation and integration (RCI) was introduced by President Kuroda when he joined the ADB in 2004. It was seen as a long-standing priority of the Japanese government as a process by which national economies become more regionally connected. It plays a critical role in accelerating economic growth, reducing poverty and economic disparity, raising productivity and employment, and strengthening institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Regional Cooperation and Integration|url = http://www.adb.org/themes/regional-cooperation/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Private Sector Lending \u2013 This priority was introduced into the ADB's activities at the insistence of the Reagan Administration. However, that effort was never a true priority until the administration of President Tadeo Chino who in turn brought in a seasoned American banker \u2013 Robert Bestani. From then on, the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) grew at a very rapid pace, growing from the smallest financing unit of the ADB to the largest in terms of financing volume. As noted earlier, this culminated in the Long Term Strategic Framework (LTSF) which was adopted by the Board in March 2008.\n\n==Financings==\nThe ADB offers \"hard\" loans on commercial terms primarily to middle income countries in Asia and \"[[Soft loan|soft\" loans]] with lower interest rates to poorer countries in the region. Based on a new policy, both types of loans will be sourced starting January 2017 from the bank's ordinary capital resources (OCR), which functions as its general operational fund.<ref>{{Cite web|title = ADF-OCR Merger to Boost Support for Region\u2019s Poor|url = http://www.adb.org/news/adf-ocr-merger-boost-support-region-s-poor|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-11-27|first = Asian Development|last = Bank}}</ref>\n\nThe ADB's Private Sector Department (PSOD) can and does offer a broader range of financings beyond commercial loans. They also have the capability to provide guarantees, equity and mezzanine finance (a combination of debt and equity).\n\nIn 2017, ADB lent $19.1 billion of which $3.2 billion went to private enterprises, as part of its \"nonsovereign\" operations. ADB's operations in 2017, including grants and cofinancing, totaled $28.9 billion.<ref>{{Cite web|title = ADB news release|url = https://www.adb.org/news/adb-2017-operations-reach-289-billion|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2018-01-12|first = Asian Development|last = Bank}}</ref>\n\nADB obtains its funding by issuing bonds on the world's capital markets.

Critics also point out that the PSOD is the only Department that actually makes money for the ADB. Hence, with the vast majority of loans going to concessionary (sub-market) loans to the public sector, the ADB is facing considerable financial difficulty and continuous operating losses.\n\n==Largest countries and regions by subscribed capital and voting power==\nThe following table are amounts for 20 largest countries by subscribed capital and voting power at the Asian Development Bank as of December 2014.<ref name=\"adb.org1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/158032/oi-appendix1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Members, Capital Stock, and Voting Power |date=December 2014|publisher=adb.org}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: right\"\n|+ The 20 largest countries and regions by subscribed capital and voting power at the Asian Development Bank\n!

A year later, Japanese Prime Minister [[Nobusuke Kishi]] announced that Japan intended to sponsor the establishment of a regional development fund with resources largely from Japan and other industrial countries. But the US did not warm to the plan and the concept was shelved. See full account in  \"[https://www.adb.org/publications/50-years-adb Banking on the Future of Asia and the Pacific: 50 Years of the Asian Development Bank],\" July 2017.\n\nThe idea came up again late in 1962 when Kaoru Ohashi, an economist from a research institute in Tokyo, visited [[Takeshi Watanabe (bureaucrat)|Takeshi Watanabe]], then a private financial consultant in Tokyo, and proposed a study group to form a development bank for the Asian region. The group met regularly in 1963, examining various scenarios for setting up a new institution and drew on Watanabe's experiences with the [[World Bank]]. However, the idea received a cool reception from the World Bank itself and the study group became discouraged.\n\nIn parallel, the concept was formally proposed at a trade conference organized by the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East (ECAFE) in 1963 by a young Thai economist, Paul Sithi-Amnuai. (ESCAP, United Nations Publication March 2007, \"The first parliament of Asia\" pp.&nbsp;65). Despite an initial mixed reaction, support for the establishment of a new bank soon grew.\n\nAn expert group was convened to study the idea, with Japan invited to contribute to the group. When Watanabe was recommended, the two streams proposing a new bank\u2014from ECAFE and Japan\u2014came together. Initially, the US was on the fence, not opposing the idea but not ready to commit financial support. But a new bank for Asia was soon seen to fit in with a broader program of assistance to Asia planned by U.S. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in the wake of the escalating US military support for the government of South Vietnam.\n\nAs a key player in the concept, Japan hoped that the ADB offices would be in Tokyo. However, eight other cities had also expressed an interest\u2014Bangkok, Colombo, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Phnom Penh, Singapore, and Tehran. To decide, the 18 prospective regional members of the new bank held three rounds of votes at a ministerial conference in Manila in November/December 1965. In the first round on 30 November, Tokyo failed to win a majority, so a second ballot was held the next day at noon. Although Japan was in the lead, it was still inconclusive, so a final vote was held after lunch. In the third poll, Tokyo gained eight votes to Manila's nine, with one abstention. Therefore, Manila was declared the host of the new development bank. The Japanese were mystified and deeply disappointed. Watanabe later wrote in his personal history of ADB: \"I felt as if the child I had so carefully reared had been taken away to a distant country.\" (Asian Development Bank publication, \"Towards a New Asia\", 1977, p.&nbsp;16)\n\nAs intensive work took place during 1966 to prepare for the opening of the new bank in Manila, high on the agenda was choice of president. Japanese Prime Minister [[Eisaku Sat\u014d]] asked Watanabe to be a candidate. Although he initially declined, pressure came from other countries and Watanabe agreed. In the absence of any other candidates, Watanabe was elected first President of the Asian Development Bank at its Inaugural Meeting on 24 November 1966.\n\nBy the end of 1972, Japan had contributed $173.7 million (22.6% of the total) to the ordinary capital resources and $122.6 million (59.6% of the total) to the special funds. In contrast, the United States contributed only $1.25 million to the special fund.<ref name=\"Ming Wan\" />\n\nAfter its creation in the 1960s, ADB focused much of its assistance on food production and rural development. At the time, Asia was one of the poorest regions in the world.<ref name=\"admin\">{{Cite web|title = ADB History|url = http://www.adb.org/about/history|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-21}}</ref>\n\nEarly loans went largely to [[Indonesia]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[South Korea]] and the [[Philippines]]; these nations accounted for 78.48% of the total ADB loans between 1967 and 1972. Moreover, Japan received tangible benefits, 41.67% of the total procurements between 1967 and 1976. Japan tied its special funds contributions to its preferred sectors and regions and procurements of its goods and services, as reflected in its $100 million donation for the Agricultural Special Fund in April 1968.<ref name=\"Ming Wan\" />\n\nWatanabe served as the first ADB president to 1972.<ref name=\"KapurLewis\">{{cite book|author1=Devesh Kapur|author2=John Prior Lewis|author3=Richard Charles Webb|title=The World Bank: Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=suOGRlBoPgQC&pg=PA304|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|isbn=0-8157-2014-9|pages=304\u2013|date=2010-12-01}}</ref><ref name=\"Magill2014\">{{cite book|author=Frank N.

The gradual emergence of Asian economies in the latter part of the decade spurred demand for better infrastructure to support economic growth. ADB focused on improving roads and providing electricity. When the world suffered its first oil price shock, ADB shifted more of its assistance to support energy projects, especially those promoting the development of domestic energy sources in member countries.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nFollowing considerable pressure from the Reagan Administration in the 1980s, ADB reluctantly began working with the private sector in an attempt to increase the impact of its development assistance to poor countries in Asia and the Pacific. In the wake of the second oil crisis, ADB expanded its assistance to energy projects. In 1982, ADB opened its first field office, in [[Bangladesh]], and later in the decade it expanded its work with non-government organizations (NGOs).<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nJapanese presidents Inoue Shiro (1972\u201376) and Yoshida Taroichi (1976\u201381) took the spotlight in the 1970s. Fujioka Masao, the fourth president (1981\u201390), adopted an assertive leadership style, launching an ambitious plan to expand the ADB into a high-impact development agency.\n\n===1990s===\nIn the 1990s, ADB began promoting regional cooperation by helping the countries on the Mekong River to trade and work together. The decade also saw an expansion of ADB's membership with the addition of several Central Asian countries following the end of the Cold War.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nIn mid-1997, ADB responded to the financial crisis that hit the region with projects designed to strengthen financial sectors and create social safety nets for the poor. During the crisis, ADB approved its largest single loan \u2013 a $4 billion emergency loan to the South Korea. In 1999, ADB adopted poverty reduction as its overarching goal.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\n===2000s===\n\nThe early years of 2000s saw a dramatic expansion of private sector finance. While the institution had such operations since the 1980s (under pressure from the Reagan Administration) the early attempts were highly unsuccessful with low lending volumes, considerable losses and financial scandals associated with an entity named AFIC. However, beginning in 2002, the ADB undertook a dramatic expansion of private sector lending under a new team. Over the course of the next six years, the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) grew by a factor of 41 times the 2001 levels of new financings and earnings for the ADB. This culminated with the Board's formal recognition if these achievements in March 2008, when the Board of Directors formally adopted the Long Term Strategic Framework (LTSF). That document formally stated that assistance to private sector development was the lead priority of the ADB and that it should constitute 50% of the bank's lending by 2020.\n\nIn 2003, the [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS) epidemic hit the region and ADB responded with programs to help the countries in the region work together to address infectious diseases, including [[avian influenza]] and HIV/[[AIDS]]. ADB also responded to a multitude of natural disasters in the region, committing more than $850 million for recovery in areas of India, Indonesia, Maldives, and Sri Lanka which were impacted by the December 2004 Asian tsunami. In addition, $1 billion in loans and grants was provided to the victims of the October 2005 earthquake in Pakistan.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nIn 2009, ADB's Board of Governors agreed to triple ADB's capital base from $55 billion to $165 billion, giving it much-needed resources to respond to the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|global economic crisis]]. The 200% increase is the largest in ADB's history, and was the first since 1994.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\n===2010s===\nAsia moved beyond the economic crisis and by 2010 had emerged as a new engine of global economic growth though it remained home to two-thirds of the world's poor. In addition, the increasing prosperity of many people in the region created a widening [[income gap]] that left many people behind. ADB responded to this with loans and grants that encouraged economic growth.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nIn early 2012, the ADB began to re-engage with [[Myanmar]] in response to reforms initiated by the government. In April 2014, ADB opened an office in Myanmar and resumed making loans and grants to the country.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\nIn 2017, ADB combined the lending operations of its Asian Development Fund (ADF) with its ordinary capital resources (OCR).  The result was to expand the OCR balance sheet to permit increasing annual lending and grants to $20 billion by 2020 \u2014 50% more than the previous level.<ref name=\"admin\"/>\n\n==Objectives and activities==\n\n===Aim===\nThe ADB defines itself as a [[Social change|social development]] organization that is dedicated to reducing [[poverty]] in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive [[economic growth]], environmentally [[sustainable growth]], and [[regional integration]]. This is carried out through [[investment]]s \u2013 in the form of loans, grants and information sharing \u2013 in infrastructure, health care services, financial and public administration systems, helping nations prepare for the impact of [[climate change]] or better [[natural resource management|manage their natural resources]], as well as other areas.\n\n===Focus areas===\nEighty percent of ADB's lending is concentrated public sector lending in five operational areas.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Core Operational Areas|url = http://www.adb.org/about/core-operational-areas|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* [[Education]] \u2013 Most developing countries in Asia and the Pacific have earned high marks for a dramatic rise in primary education enrollment rates in the last three decades, but daunting challenges remain, threatening economic and social growth.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Education|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/education/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Environment, Climate Change, and Disaster Risk Management \u2013 [[Environmental sustainability]] is a prerequisite for economic growth and poverty reduction in Asia and the Pacific.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Environment, Climate Change, and Disaster Risk Management|url = http://www.adb.org/themes/environment/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Finance Sector Development \u2013 The financial system is the lifeline of a country's economy. It creates prosperity that can be shared throughout society and benefit the poorest and most vulnerable people. Financial sector and capital market development, including microfinance, small and medium-sized enterprises, and regulatory reforms, is vital to decreasing poverty in Asia and the Pacific.This has been a key priority of the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD)since 2002. One of the most active sub-sectors of finance is the PSOD's support for trade finance. Each year the PSOD finances billions of dollars in letters of credit across all of Asia and the rest of the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Finance Sector Development|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/finance/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Infrastructure, including transport<ref>{{Cite web|title = Sustainable Transport for All|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/transport/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> and communications,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Information and Communications Technology|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/ict/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> energy,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Energy|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/energy/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> water supply and sanitation,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Water for All|url = http://www.adb.org/sectors/water/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref> and urban development.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Urban Development|url = http://www.adb.org/themes/urban-development/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Regional Cooperation and Integration \u2013 Regional cooperation and integration (RCI) was introduced by President Kuroda when he joined the ADB in 2004. It was seen as a long-standing priority of the Japanese government as a process by which national economies become more regionally connected. It plays a critical role in accelerating economic growth, reducing poverty and economic disparity, raising productivity and employment, and strengthening institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Regional Cooperation and Integration|url = http://www.adb.org/themes/regional-cooperation/main|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}</ref>\n* Private Sector Lending \u2013 This priority was introduced into the ADB's activities at the insistence of the Reagan Administration. However, that effort was never a true priority until the administration of President Tadeo Chino who in turn brought in a seasoned American banker \u2013 Robert Bestani. From then on, the Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) grew at a very rapid pace, growing from the smallest financing unit of the ADB to the largest in terms of financing volume. As noted earlier, this culminated in the Long Term Strategic Framework (LTSF) which was adopted by the Board in March 2008.\n\n==Financings==\nThe ADB offers \"hard\" loans on commercial terms primarily to middle income countries in Asia and \"[[Soft loan|soft\" loans]] with lower interest rates to poorer countries in the region. Based on a new policy, both types of loans will be sourced starting January 2017 from the bank's ordinary capital resources (OCR), which functions as its general operational fund.<ref>{{Cite web|title = ADF-OCR Merger to Boost Support for Region\u2019s Poor|url = http://www.adb.org/news/adf-ocr-merger-boost-support-region-s-poor|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2015-11-27|first = Asian Development|last = Bank}}</ref>\n\nThe ADB's Private Sector Department (PSOD) can and does offer a broader range of financings beyond commercial loans. They also have the capability to provide guarantees, equity and mezzanine finance (a combination of debt and equity).\n\nIn 2017, ADB lent $19.1 billion of which $3.2 billion went to private enterprises, as part of its \"nonsovereign\" operations. ADB's operations in 2017, including grants and cofinancing, totaled $28.9 billion.<ref>{{Cite web|title = ADB news release|url = https://www.adb.org/news/adb-2017-operations-reach-289-billion|website = Asian Development Bank|publisher = adb.org|accessdate = 2018-01-12|first = Asian Development|last = Bank}}</ref>\n\nADB obtains its funding by issuing bonds on the world's capital markets.

One of the most controversial ADB-related projects is [[Thailand]]'s Mae Moh [[coal-fired power station]]. Environmental and human rights activists say ADB's environmental safeguards policy as well as policies for [[indigenous peoples]] and [[involuntary resettlement]], while usually up to international standards on paper, are often ignored in practice, are too vague or weak to be effective, or are simply not enforced by bank officials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070508a5.html|title=Large-scale ADB projects draw criticism|work=The Japan Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rfi.fr/actuen/articles/113/article_3679.asp|title=RFI \u2013 NGO criticises ADB and questions its ability to reduce poverty|publisher=rfi.fr}}</ref>\n\nThe bank has been criticized over its role and relevance in the [[food crisis]].

Critics also point out that the PSOD is the only Department that actually makes money for the ADB. Hence, with the vast majority of loans going to concessionary (sub-market) loans to the public sector, the ADB is facing considerable financial difficulty and continuous operating losses.\n\n==Largest countries and regions by subscribed capital and voting power==\nThe following table are amounts for 20 largest countries by subscribed capital and voting power at the Asian Development Bank as of December 2014.<ref name=\"adb.org1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/158032/oi-appendix1.pdf|format=PDF|title=Members, Capital Stock, and Voting Power |date=December 2014|publisher=adb.org}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: right\"\n|+ The 20 largest countries and regions by subscribed capital and voting power at the Asian Development Bank\n!

Additionally, the same qualification was required in order to exercise public offices, such as [[Provost of the merchants of Paris|provost of the merchants]], [[alderman]] or [[consul]]. To be a [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] of Paris, according to Article 173 of the [[Custom of Paris in New France|Custom of Paris]], one had to have held [[Domicile (law)|domicile]] in Paris as a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] or as [[Ownership|owner]] for at least a year and a day. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Division|first=Library of Congress European Law division|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=ln8tTxwXiQoC&redir_esc=y|title=The Coutumes of France in the Library of Congress: An Annotated Bibliography - Article 173|last2=|first2=|last3=|first3=|date=|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.|year=|isbn=978-1-58477-627-7|location=|pages=|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nThe bourgeois of Paris had privileges as well as duties: they were free from having to pay the [[taille]], however they were required to pay the city [[taxes]], they had to contribute to public [[Charity (practice)|charity]], they had to arm themselves at their own expense, and needed to join the urban [[militia]]. <ref name=\":0\" /> Unlike the aristocracy, the genealogies of the bourgeois families of Paris are difficult to track down. The names of original families have been diluted and mixed to similar, more common names. {{Original research inline|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Definition ==\n\nAccording to article 173 (previously 129) of the [[Custom of Paris in New France|Custom of Paris]], the \"right of the bourgeoisie\" is acquired in Paris by any person \"living and residing there for a year and a day,\" that is to say, having a personal home and staying there continuously with family, and not making temporary stays for business. This was to be proven by a receipt of rent or personal capitation, and not by renting a room or staying in a furnished hotel. Unlike the bourgeois or citizens of other free cities, Parisians did not need ''[[Letters of Bourgeoisie]]'' to prove their status. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn other words, anyone who owned a home in Paris intra-muros as [[Ownership|owner]] or [[Leasehold estate|tenant]], and who resided there for over a year, was a bourgeois of Paris. There were no other conditions such as heritage, [[oath]] or other, unlike in [[Bourgeois of Brussels|Brussels]] at the same period. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Duties and privileges of the bourgeois of Paris ==\n\nThese privileges were numerous, diverse, varying greatly from decade to decade. The list published in 1884 in ''[[L'Interm\u00e9diaire des chercheurs et curieux]] (''The Intermediate of the Researchers and Curious) gives a glimpse into the variety of these privileges. Laurence Croq, who has dedicated a thesis to studying the notion of the bourgeois of Paris in the 18th century, explains that this status had a [[wikt:polymorphous|polymorphous]] characteristic.<ref>Laurence Croq, ''Les \u00ab Bourgeois de Paris \u00bb au <abbr>xviii<sup>e</sup></abbr> si\u00e8cle.

They had received from the [[List of French monarchs|king]] certain privileges, such as the right to have a seal, a common fund, and a \"parlour for Bourgeois\" (city hall); the right to defend itself, to close itself, and to administer itself; and the right to have its own justice and its own police force.\n\n=== Privilege of jurisdiction ===\n\nAccording to Article 112 of the [[Custom of Paris in New France|Custom of Paris]], the bourgeois of Paris can not be forced to [[Pleading|plead]] in [[Defense (legal)|defense]] anywhere other than Paris, including in civil matters for purely [[Ius in re|real rights]].\n\n=== Fiscal privileges ===\n\nFiscal privileges were numerous; those maintained until the [[Estates General of 1789|Meeting of the Estates-General in 1789]] include:\n\n* Exemption from the [[Taille]], including income from property in the countryside in the jurisdiction of the ''Vicomt\u00e9 de Paris'' (the bourgeois of [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], [[Poissy]], [[Lyon]]s, [[Amiens]], [[Bordeaux]], and several other large cities had the same privilege);\n* Exemption from the right of freehold, granted by [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] in July 1409 and suppressed by [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]];\n* Right to [[Wholesaling|wholesale]] the wine of one's own home without the ministry of ''jur\u00e9s-crieurs'' and without being required to register the sale, and to import it into Paris without paying the [[tariff]]s;\n* Exemption from the [[mortmain]] and the right of mortmain on property in mortmain throughout the kingdom.\n\n=== Some privileges identical to those of the Nobility ===\nThe quality of bourgeois of Paris gave some privileges almost equal to those of the [[French nobility|nobility]], the oldest being the exemption from [[mortmain]], then from the [[Taille]]<ref>''L'Interm\u00e9diaire des chercheurs et curieux'', 1864, ''ibidem''.</ref> and freehold, to benefit from the noble guard.

But [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] restricted this privilege in 1577 to the [[Provost of the merchants of Paris|Provost of the Merchants]] and the [[Alderman|Aldermen]] alone. It was suppressed in 1667, restored in 1707; suppressed again in 1715, and finally restored in 1716, as it stands today. \"<ref>Fran\u00e7ois Alexandre Aubert de La Chesnaye-Desbois, Dictionary of the nobility, Foreword, Volume I, Paris, 1770, p. IX.</ref>\n\nThe bourgeois of Paris enjoyed the right to the noble guard, called for them the bourgeois guard.\n\n== Birth of the bourgeoisie in Paris ==\nThe oldest [[Corporation (feudal Europe)|corporations]] or [[guild]]s in Paris were [[Tailor|clothiers]], [[grocers]], [[haberdasher]]s, and [[Fur clothing|furriers]].\n\nWith the water merchants, heirs of the ''nautes of Lut\u00e8ce'' who exercise the [[monopoly]] that holds the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis|Abbey of Saint-Denis]] for the trade along the [[Seine]], and the ''Grande Boucherie'' (Big Butchery), which reunites the owners of farms of the suburbs and those of salting workshops intra and extramurals, they constitute alongside the [[clergy]] and the [[French nobility|nobility]] a [[Third estate|third power]] that will consecrate in 1357 the Great Ordinance of the [[Provost of the merchants of Paris|provost of the merchants]], [[\u00c9tienne Marcel|Etienne Marcel]], and which will become financially decisive, as the will illustrate the [[Cabochien revolt]].\n\nIn 1190, before going on a crusade, [[Philip II of France|King Philippe Auguste]] wrote his [[Will and testament|will]] and placed six \"loyal men\" at the head of the provost: Thibaut Le Riche, Athon de Greve, Evrouin Le Changeur, Robert de Chartres, Baudouin Bruneau and Nicolas Boucel.<ref>Alfred Fierro, ''Histoire et dictionnaire de Paris'', \u00c9ditions Robert Laffont, coll. \u00ab Bouquins \u00bb, 1996, 1 590 <abbr>p.</abbr> ({{ISBN|978-2221078624}}).</ref>\n\nThe ''Livre des m\u00e9tiers'' (Book of [[Tradesman|Trades]]) and the ''Livre de la taille'' (Book of the [[Taille]]), written under the provost of [[\u00c9tienne Boileau]], allow us to better understand this rising bourgeoisie.

To be a [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] of Paris, according to Article 173 of the [[Custom of Paris in New France|Custom of Paris]], one had to have held [[Domicile (law)|domicile]] in Paris as a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] or as [[Ownership|owner]] for at least a year and a day. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Division|first=Library of Congress European Law division|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=ln8tTxwXiQoC&redir_esc=y|title=The Coutumes of France in the Library of Congress: An Annotated Bibliography - Article 173|last2=|first2=|last3=|first3=|date=|publisher=The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.|year=|isbn=978-1-58477-627-7|location=|pages=|language=fr}}</ref>\n\nThe bourgeois of Paris had privileges as well as duties: they were free from having to pay the [[taille]], however they were required to pay the city [[taxes]], they had to contribute to public [[Charity (practice)|charity]], they had to arm themselves at their own expense, and needed to join the urban [[militia]]. <ref name=\":0\" /> Unlike the aristocracy, the genealogies of the bourgeois families of Paris are difficult to track down.

This was to be proven by a receipt of rent or personal capitation, and not by renting a room or staying in a furnished hotel. Unlike the bourgeois or citizens of other free cities, Parisians did not need ''[[Letters of Bourgeoisie]]'' to prove their status. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn other words, anyone who owned a home in Paris intra-muros as [[Ownership|owner]] or [[Leasehold estate|tenant]], and who resided there for over a year, was a bourgeois of Paris. There were no other conditions such as heritage, [[oath]] or other, unlike in [[Bourgeois of Brussels|Brussels]] at the same period. {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Duties and privileges of the bourgeois of Paris ==\n\nThese privileges were numerous, diverse, varying greatly from decade to decade. The list published in 1884 in ''[[L'Interm\u00e9diaire des chercheurs et curieux]] (''The Intermediate of the Researchers and Curious) gives a glimpse into the variety of these privileges. Laurence Croq, who has dedicated a thesis to studying the notion of the bourgeois of Paris in the 18th century, explains that this status had a [[wikt:polymorphous|polymorphous]] characteristic.<ref>Laurence Croq, ''Les \u00ab Bourgeois de Paris \u00bb au <abbr>xviii<sup>e</sup></abbr> si\u00e8cle.
