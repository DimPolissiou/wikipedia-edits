When one of the robot policemen, known as the Electric Warriors, or Leks, develops self-awareness, it begins to question the correctness of the social order and decides to help the Zigs. This robot is called 9-03, and it falls in love with a Zig crone called Kinsolving, whom he protects from any and all harm.\nHe then helps the Zigs by giving them food and supplies taken from the Elites up above.\n\nAt the same time, a man named Derek Two-Shadow is living in the forest with a tribe of natural born natives called {{Not a typo|Primmies}}. They have rejected all forms of modern technology. A female scholar, Quintana, is sent into the forest to live with the {{Not a typo|Primmies}} and study them. She gets to know Derek Two-Shadow, and learns of his history and life. He was born as a Zig, but escaped to the wilderness when he was still a child. One night, a group of genetic mutants (Genidiots) sneaks into the{{Not a typo|Primmie}} camp to steal food. Quintana is startled to see one, and she shoots and kills three of them with her laser pistol. She did not know that the Genidiots were allowed to steal food in exchange for peace between the two factions. With the killing of the three intruders, the peace is broken and the Genidiots will attack. She offers her weapons to defend the village, but since this goes against the {{Not a typo|Primmie}} principle of rejecting technology, she is told to leave and never come back. \n\nWhen the Leks sent to capture 9-03 learn of Kinsolving's close relationship with 9-03, they decide to kidnap her and take her to headquarters for further questioning. 9-03 storms into the Elite leader's office and demands he release Kinsolving. The leader's name is Magistrate Marder. He agrees to free Kinsolving in exchange for letting his techs examine 9-03 and figure out how he became sentient. 9-03 manages to free Kinsolving, but when a group of gunships sent to pursue them fires a warning shot, 9-03 sees that the shot is going to kill a Zig family. He throws himself in front of the shot and saves the Zigs, but he is blown to pieces. \n\nMagistrate Marder has learned about a fleet of what appear to be alien vessels and wishes to fuse man and machine to create a new breed of Electric Warrior, the Synthoids. He had hoped to duplicate 9-03's autonomy and intelligence, but since that failed, he has the {{Not a typo|Primmies}} rounded up, captured, then taken to the city where they are converted into cyborgs and most of them die from the shock. Two-Shadow, however, is one of the lucky ones: the components of 9-03 are fused to his body after most of it has been amputated. Upon awakening after his surgery, Derek feels the essence of 9-03 within his altered body, escapes, and finds a component of the robot at Kinsolving's home that he uses to flood his body with nanites and merge 9-03's mind with his own; although they retain their independent brain patterns, they can never again be separated.\n\nThe Electric Warrior forces an alliance between the {{Not a typo|Primmies}}, Zigs, Genidiots, and Elites to fight the invasion, but when the \"aliens\" come, they are revealed to be very human \u2013 the Electric Warrior's planet had been an experiment set up to determine how civilizations develop. Derek Two-Shadow was actually a resident of Earth who had signed up for the experiment after discovering that his wife had had herself rendered cybernetically immortal. This disgusted him into leaving her forever due to the fact that the surgery required had left horrible scars on her back and her body had been changed so that they could no longer enjoy a normal physical relationship. The Electric Warrior agrees to go back to Earth with the \"aliens\" to give them their experimental data, while the rest of the people remain behind but in a more mutually beneficial and cooperative peace.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{gcdb series|id=3146|title=Electric Warrior}}\n* {{comicbookdb|type=title|id=4624|title=''Electric Warrior''}}\n\n\n[[Category:1986 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:1987 comics endings]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1986]]\n[[Category:Comics by Doug Moench]]\n[[Category:Science fiction comics]]\n[[Category:Dystopian comics]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox comic book title\n<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| title = Electric Warrior\n| image = ElectricWarrior1.jpg\n|imagesize=200\n| caption = Cover to issue #1<br>Art by [[Jim Baikie]]\n| schedule = Monthly\n| format = [[Limited series (comics)|Limited series]]\n| publisher = [[DC Comics]]\n| date = May 1986 \u2013 October 1987\n| issues = 18\n| main_char_team =\n| writers = [[Doug Moench]]\n| artists = [[Jim Baikie]]\n| pencillers =\n| inkers = [[Jim Baikie]], [[Pablo Marcos]], [[Dennis Janke]]\n| colorists = [[Tom Ziuko]]\n| creative_team_month =\n| creative_team_year =\n| creators =\n|subcat=DC Comics\n|sort=Electric Warrior (comics)\n}}\n'''''Electric Warrior''''' is an [[American comic book]] series, published by [[DC Comics]] in 1986 and 1987.

The series only lasted for two seasons.\n\n==History==\nThe Grand National East Series was created in 1972 by [[NASCAR]] as a reaction to the contraction of the Grand National Division (renamed the Winston Cup Series) schedule and in response to the desires of new series sponsor [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston]]. The previous 50-to-60-race schedules were considered too large, and therefore the schedule was trimmed to approximately thirty races. This left many tracks that had previously hosted NASCAR's premier series without their headliner events, however, and NASCAR created the Grand National East Division to fill the gap.<ref>Latford 1999, p. 19</ref>\n\nA similar Grand National West, then Winston West Series, was also formed from the former Pacific Coast Late Model Division,<ref>Lazarus 2004, p. 170</ref> and would continue to the present as the [[K&N Pro Series West]]. However, the first version of a Grand National East Series would only last two seasons before being abandoned by NASCAR.  \n\nEventually, NASCAR would develop by the 1980s the [[NASCAR North Tour]] before eventually abandoning it for the ''Busch Grand National North Series'' in 1987, which in 2003 became the ''Busch East Series'' when the West and North (renamed East as the tour began traveling to the Southeast) series rules were unified, and eventually became the East version of the current [[K&N Pro Series East]].<ref name=\"Field\">Fielden 2004, p. 238</ref>\n\n==Competition==\nThe Grand National East Series used a mixture of former Grand National/Winston Cup cars, as well as cars from NASCAR's [[Grand American]] series, which had also folded after the series' 1971 season.<ref>Donovan 2008, p. 215</ref> The cars raced in the series were allowed to be up to four years old.<ref>Jackson 1973, p. 13</ref> A significant number of events of the series' 1973 season took place outside of NASCAR's traditional southeastern stronghold;<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?ei=JYyXT6r8Caiu6AGBz4y-Bg&id=mI49AQAAIAAJ&dq=%22Grand+National+East%22+NASCAR&q=%22Grand+National+East%22#search_anchor \"U.S. Racing Showdown\". ''Motor Trend'', 1973, p. 124]</ref> in addition, eight of the season's fifteen races were co-sanctioned with the [[Automobile Racing Club of America]].

The series only lasted for two seasons.\n\n==History==\nThe Grand National East Series was created in 1972 by [[NASCAR]] as a reaction to the contraction of the Grand National Division (renamed the Winston Cup Series) schedule and in response to the desires of new series sponsor [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston]]. The previous 50-to-60-race schedules were considered too large, and therefore the schedule was trimmed to approximately thirty races. This left many tracks that had previously hosted NASCAR's premier series without their headliner events, however, and NASCAR created the Grand National East Division to fill the gap.<ref>Latford 1999, p. 19</ref>\n\nA similar Grand National West, then Winston West Series, was also formed from the former Pacific Coast Late Model Division,<ref>Lazarus 2004, p. 170</ref> and would continue to the present as the [[K&N Pro Series West]]. However, the first version of a Grand National East Series would only last two seasons before being abandoned by NASCAR.  \n\nEventually, NASCAR would develop by the 1980s the [[NASCAR North Tour]] before eventually abandoning it for the ''Busch Grand National North Series'' in 1987, which in 2003 became the ''Busch East Series'' when the West and North (renamed East as the tour began traveling to the Southeast) series rules were unified, and eventually became the East version of the current [[K&N Pro Series East]].<ref name=\"Field\">Fielden 2004, p. 238</ref>\n\n==Competition==\nThe Grand National East Series used a mixture of former Grand National/Winston Cup cars, as well as cars from NASCAR's [[Grand American]] series, which had also folded after the series' 1971 season.<ref>Donovan 2008, p. 215</ref> The cars raced in the series were allowed to be up to four years old.<ref>Jackson 1973, p. 13</ref> A significant number of events of the series' 1973 season took place outside of NASCAR's traditional southeastern stronghold;<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?ei=JYyXT6r8Caiu6AGBz4y-Bg&id=mI49AQAAIAAJ&dq=%22Grand+National+East%22+NASCAR&q=%22Grand+National+East%22#search_anchor \"U.S. Racing Showdown\". ''Motor Trend'', 1973, p. 124]</ref> in addition, eight of the season's fifteen races were co-sanctioned with the [[Automobile Racing Club of America]].
