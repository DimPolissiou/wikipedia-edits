While there is still some debate about the historical significance of the style, Rococo is now often considered as a distinct period in the development of [[European art]].\n\n==Characteristics==\nRococo features exuberant decoration, with an abundance of curves, counter-curves, undulations and elements modeled on nature. The exteriors of Rococo buildings are often simple, while the interiors are entirely dominated by their ornament. The style was highly theatrical, designed to impress and awe at first sight. Floor plans of churches were often complex, featuring interlocking ovals; In palaces, grand stairways became centrepieces, and offered different points of view of the decoration.{{Sfn|Hopkins|2014|page=92}} The main ornaments of Rococo are: asymmetrical shells, [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] and other leaves, birds, bouquets of flowers, fruits, musical instruments, angels and [[Chinoiserie|Far Eastern elements]] ([[pagoda]]s, dragons, monkeys, bizarre flowers and Chinese people).<ref>{{cite book |last1= Graur|first1=Neaga|title=Stiluri \u00een arta decorativ\u0103|date=1970|publisher=Cerces|page=193 & 194|url=|language=ro}}</ref>\n\nThe style often integrated painting, molded stucco, and wood carving, and ''[[quadratura]]'', or illusionist ceiling paintings, which were designed to give the impression that those entering the room were looking up at the sky, where cherubs and other figures were gazing down at them. Materials used included stucco, either painted or left white; combinations of different colored woods (usually oak, beech or walnut); lacquered wood in the Japanese style, ornament of gilded bronze, and marble tops of commodes or tables.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Graur|first1=Neaga|title=Stiluri \u00een arta decorativ\u0103|date=1970|publisher=Cerces|page=194|url=|language=ro}}</ref> The intent was to create an impression of surprise, awe and wonder on first view.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=144}}\n\n==Differences between Baroque and Rococo==\nThe following are characteristics that Rococo has, and Baroque does not:\n*The partial abandonment of symmetry, everything being composed of graceful lines and curves, similar to [[Art Nouveau]]\n*The huge quantity of asymmetrical curves and C-shaped [[volute]]s\n*The very wide use of flowers in ornamentation, an example being [[festoon]]s made of flowers\n*Chinese and Japanese motifs (see also: [[chinoiserie]] and [[Japonism]])\n*Warm pastel colours<ref>{{cite book |last1= Graur|first1=Neaga|title=Stiluri \u00een arta decorativ\u0103|date=1970|publisher=Cerces|page=160 & 163|url=|language=ro}}</ref> (whitish-yellow, cream-colored, pearl greys, very light blues)<ref>{{cite book |last1= Graur|first1=Neaga|title=Stiluri \u00een arta decorativ\u0103|date=1970|publisher=Cerces|page=192|url=|language=ro}}</ref>\n\n==France==\n{{See also|Rocaille|Louis Quinze}}\n\nThe ''[[Rocaille]]'' style, or French Rococo, appeared in Paris during the reign of [[Louis XV]], and flourished between about 1723 and 1759.<ref>Lovreglio, Aur\u00e9lia and Anne, ''Dictionnaire des Mobiliers et des Objets d'art'', Le Robert, Paris, 2006, p. 369</ref> The style was used particularly in salons, a new style of room designed to impress and entertain guests. The most prominent example was the salon of the Princess in [[H\u00f4tel de Soubise]] in Paris, designed by [[Germain Boffrand]] and [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]] (1735\u201340). The characteristics of French Rococo included exceptional artistry, especially in the complex frames made for mirrors and paintings, which were sculpted in plaster and often gilded; and the use of vegetal forms (vines, leaves, flowers) intertwined in complex designs.{{Sfn|Hopkins|2014|pp. 92-93}} The furniture also featured sinuous curves and vegetal designs. The leading furniture designers and craftsmen in the style included [[Juste-Aurele Meissonier]], [[Charles Cressent]], and [[Nicolas Pineau]].{{Sfn|De Morant|1970|page=382}}<ref name=\"Kleiner2010\">{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred|title=Gardner's art through the ages: the western perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJrN8rDirxkC&pg=PA587|accessdate=21 February 2011|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-57355-5|pages=583\u2013584}}</ref>\n\nThe Rocaille style lasted in France until the mid-18th century, and while it became more curving and vegetal, it never achieved the extravagant exuberance of the Rococo in Bavaria, Austria and Italy. The discoveries of Roman antiquities beginning in 1738 at [[Herculanum]] and especially at [[Pompeii]] in 1748 turned French architecture in the direction of the more symmetrical and less flamboyant [[Neoclassicism in France#Architecture|neo-classicism]].\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Salon de la princesse hotel de soubise.jpg|Salon of the [[H\u00f4tel de Soubise]] in Paris (1735\u201340) by [[Germain Boffrand]]\nFile:MeissonnierTable.jpg|Table design by [[Juste-Aurele Meissonier]] (1730)\nFile:Hotel de Soubise - Grande chambre de la princesse 3.JPG|Grand Chamber of the Prince, Hotel de Soubise (1735\u201340)\nFile:Boiserie from the H\u00f4tel de Varengeville MET DP214174.jpg|Woodwork in the H\u00f4tel de Varengeville by [[Nicolas Pineau]] (1735)\nFile:Charles Cressent, Chest of drawers, c. 1730 at Waddesdon Manor.jpg|Commode by [[Charles Cressent]] (1730), Waddleston Manor\n</gallery>\n\n==Italy==\nArtists in Italy, particularly [[Venice]], also produced an exuberant rococo style. Venetian commodes imitated the curving lines and carved ornament of the French rocaille, but with a particular Venetian variation; the pieces were painted, often with landscapes or flowers or scenes from [[Guardi]] or other painters, or [[Chinoiserie]], against a blue or green background, matching the colours of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]] of painters whose work decorated the salons. Notable decorative painters included [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], who painted ceilings and murals of both churches and palazzos, and [[Giovanni Battista Crosato]] who painted the ballroom ceiling of the [[Ca Rezzonico]] in the [[illusionistic ceiling painting|quadraturo]] manner, giving the illusion of three dimensions. Tiepelo travelled to Germany with his son during 1752\u20131754, decorating the ceilings of the [[W\u00fcrzburg Residence]], one of the major landmarks of the Bavarian rococo. An earlier celebrated Venetian painter was [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]], who painted several notable church ceilings. {{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=383}}\n\nThe Venetian Rococo also featured exceptional glassware, particularly [[Murano glass]], often engraved and coloured, which was exported across Europe. Works included multicolour chandeliers and mirrors with extremely ornate frames. {{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=383}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Interior of Santi Giovanni e Paolo (Venice) - The Glory of St. Dominic by Piazzetta.jpg|Ceiling of church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice, by [[Piazzetta]] (1727)\nFile:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Juno and Luna - Google Art Project.jpg|''Juno and Luna'' by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] (1735\u201345)\nFile:Lampadario in vetro di Murano - Ca' Rezzonico, Venice.jpg|[[Murano glass]] chandelier at the [[Ca Rezzonico]] (1758)\nFile:Ca' Rezzonico (Venice) - Ceiling of the Ballroom.jpeg|Ballroom ceiling of the [[Ca Rezzonico]] with ceiling by [[Giovanni Battista Crosato]] (1753)\n</gallery>\n\n==Southern Germany==\n{{see also|Frederician Rococo}}\nThe Rococo decorative style reached its summit in southern Germany and central Europe from the 1730s until the 1770s. It was first introduced from France through the publications and works of French architects and decorators, including the sculptor [[Claude III Audran]], the interior designer [[Gilles-Marie Oppenordt]], the architect [[Germain Boffrand]], the sculptor Jean Mondon, and the draftsman and engraver [[Pierre Lepautre (1652\u20131716)|Pierre Lepautre]]. Their work had an important influence on the German Rococo style.<ref>De Morant, Henry, ''Histoire des arts d\u00e9coratifs'' (1977), pp. 354\u2013355</ref>\n\nGerman architects adapted the Rococo style but made it far more asymmetric and loaded with more ornate decoration than the French original. The German style was characterized by an explosion of forms that cascaded down the walls. It featured molding formed into curves and counter-curves, twisting and turning patterns, ceilings and walls with no right angles, and stucco foliage which seemed to be creeping up the walls and across the ceiling. The decoration was often gilded or silvered to give it contrast with the white or pale pastel walls.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=150-153}}\n\nThe Belgian-born architect and designer [[Fran\u00e7ois de Cuvilli\u00e9s]] was one of the first to create a Rococo building in Germany, with the pavilion of [[Amalienburg]] in Munich, (1734-1739), inspired by the pavilions of the [[Grand Trianon|Trianon]] and [[Ch\u00e2teau de Marly|Marly]] in France. It was built as a hunting lodge, with a platform on the roof for shooting pheasants. The Hall of Mirrors in the interior, by the painter and stucco sculptor [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]], was far more exuberant than any French Rococo.<ref>Ducher, ''Caract\u00e9ristique des Styles'' (1988), p. 150</ref>\n\nAnother notable example of the early German Rococo is [[W\u00fcrzburg Residence]] (1737\u20131744) constructed for the Prince-Bishop of Wurzburg by [[Balthasar Neumann]]. Neumann had traveled to Paris and consulted with the French rocaille decorative artists [[Germain Boffrand]] and [[Robert de Cotte]]. While the exterior was in more sober Baroque style, the interior, particularly the stairways and ceilings, was much lighter and decorative. The Prince-Bishop imported the Italian Rococo painter [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] in 1750\u201353 to create a mural over the top of the three-level ceremonial stairway.<ref name=\"Demartini 2006 pp. 222\">Prina and Demartini (2006) pp. 222\u2013223</ref><ref>https://www.bavaria.by/experiences/city-country-culture/castles-palaces/wuerzburg-residence; https://www.bavaria.by/experiences/city-country-culture/castles-palaces/wuerzburg-residence; B.M. Field ''The World's Greatest Architecture: Past and Present'', Regency House Publishing Ltd, 2001.</ref> Neumann described the interior of the residence as \"a theater of light\". The stairway was also the central element in a residence Neumann built at the [[Augustusburg and Falkenlust Palaces, Br\u00fchl|Augustusburg Palace in Br\u00fchl]] (1743\u20131748). In that building the stairway led the visitors up through a stucco fantasy of paintings, sculpture, ironwork and decoration, with surprising views at every turn.<ref name=\"Demartini 2006 pp. 222\"/>\n\nIn the 1740s and 1750s, a number of notable pilgrimage churches were constructed in [[Bavaria]], with interiors decorated in a distinctive variant of the rococo style. One of the most notable examples is the [[Wieskirche]] (1745\u20131754) designed by [[Dominikus Zimmermann]]. Like most of the Bavarian pilgrimage churches, the exterior is very simple, with pastel walls, and little ornament. Entering the church the visitor encounters an astonishing theater of movement and light. It features an oval-shaped sanctuary, and a deambulatory in the same form, filling in the church with light from all sides. The white walls contrasted with columns of blue and pink stucco in the choir, and the domed ceiling surrounded by plaster angels below a dome representing the heavens crowded with colorful Biblical figures. Other notable pilgrimage churches include the [[Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers]] by [[Balthasar Neumann]] (1743\u20131772).{{Sfn|Ducher|1988| page=152}}{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|pp. 89\u201394}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Schloss Amalienburg (6317867213).jpg|[[Amalienburg]] pavilion in Munich by [[Fran\u00e7ois de Cuvilli\u00e9s]] (1734\u20131739)\nFile:Amalienburg Spiegelsaal-1.jpg|Hall of Mirrors of [[Amalienburg]] by [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]] (1734\u20131739)\nFile:NRW, Bruhl, Augustusburg 01.jpg|Looking up the central stairway at [[Augustusburg and Falkenlust Palaces, Br\u00fchl|Augustusburg Palace in Br\u00fchl]] by [[Balthasar Neumann]] (1741\u20131744)\nFile:Wieskirche 003.JPG|The [[Wieskirche]] by [[Dominikus Zimmermann]] (1745\u20131754)\nFile:Vierzehnheiligen-Basilika3-Asio.JPG|Interior of the [[Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers]] by [[Balthasar Neumann]] (1743\u20131772)\nFile:Kaisersaal W\u00fcrzburg.jpg|The Kaisersaal in the [[W\u00fcrzburg Residence]] by [[Balthasar Neumann]] (1749\u20131751)\nFile:Festsaal Schaetzlerpalais.JPG|Festival Hall of the [[Schaezlerpalais]] in [[Augsburg]] by [[Carl Albert von Lespilliez]] (1765\u20131770)\nFile:\u041a\u0418\u0422\u0410\u0419\u0421\u041a\u0418\u0419 \u0414\u0412\u041e\u0420\u0415\u0426. \u0417\u041e\u041b\u041e\u0422\u041e\u0419 \u041a\u0410\u0411\u0418\u041d\u0415\u0422.jpg|Golden Cabinet of the Chinese Palace, [[Oranienbaum, Russia]], built by [[Antonio Rinaldi (architect)|Antonio Rinaldi]] for [[Catherine the Great]] (1762\u20131778)\n</gallery>\n\n[[Johann Michael Fischer]] was the architect of [[Ottobeuren Abbey]] (1748\u20131766), another Bavarian Rococo landmark. The church features, like much of the rococo architecture in Germany, a remarkable contrast between the regularity of the facade and the overabundance of decoration in the interior.<ref name=\"Demartini 2006 pp. 222\"/>\n\n==Britain==\nIn Great Britain, rococo was called the \"French taste\" and had less influence on design and the decorative arts than in continental Europe, although its influence was felt in such areas as silverwork, porcelain, and silks. [[William Hogarth]] helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not mentioning rococo by name, he argued in his ''Analysis of Beauty'' (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in [[Classicism]]).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dummies.com/education/art-appreciation/the-rococo-influence-in-british-art/|title=The Rococo Influence in British Art - dummies|work=dummies|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nRococo was slow in arriving in England. Before entering the Rococo, British furniture for a time followed the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] [[Palladian]] model under designer [[William Kent]], who designed for Lord Burlington and other important patrons of the arts. Kent travelled to Italy with Lord Burlington between 1712 and 1720, and brought back many models and ideas from Palladio. He designed the furniture for [[Hampton Court Palace]] (1732), Lord Burlington's [[Chiswick House]] (1729), London, Thomas Coke's [[Holkham Hall]], Norfolk, Robert Walpole's pile at [[Houghton Hall|Houghton]], for [[Devonshire House]] in London, and at Rousham.{{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=382}}\n\n[[Mahogany]] made its appearance in England in about 1720, and immediately became popular for furniture, along with [[walnut]] wood. The Rococo began to make an appearance in England between 1740 and 1750. The furniture of [[Thomas Chippendale]] was the closest to the Rococo style, In 1754 he published \"Gentleman's and Cabinet-makers' directory\", a catalog of designs for rococo, ''chinoiserie'' and even Gothic furniture, which achieved wide popularity, going through three editions. Unlike French designers, Chippendale did not employ marquetry or inlays in his furniture. The predominant designer of inlaid furniture were Vile and Cob, the cabinet-makers for King George III. Another important figure in British furniture was [[Thomas Johnson (designer)|Thomas Johnson]], who in 1761, very late in the period, published a catalog of Rococo furniture designs. These include furnishings based on rather fantastic Chinese and Indian motifs, including a canopy bed crowned by a Chinese pagoda (now in the Victoria and Albert Museum).{{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=383}}\n\nOther notable figures in the British Rococo included the silversmith Charles Friedrich Kandler.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:A Design for a State Bed From Chippendale's Director.jpg|Design for a State Bed by [[Thomas Chippendale]] (1753\u201354)\nFile:Chinese Sopha -Sofa-, in Chippendale Drawings, Vol. I MET DP104166.jpg|Proposed Chinese sofa by [[Thomas Chippendale]] (1753\u201354)\nFile:French Commode and Lamp Stands.jpg|Design for Commode and lamp stands by Thomas Chippendale (1753\u201354)\nFile:Pair of side chairs MET DP111238.jpg|Side chair; Thomas Chippendale; circa 1755\u20131760; mahogany; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nFile:Thomas Johnson - Three Designs for Torcheres in the Chinese Taste (Plate 13 of \"One Hundred and Fifty New Designs\") - Google Art Project.jpg|Design for candlesticks in the \"Chinese Taste\" by [[Thomas Johnson (designer)|Thomas Johnson]] (1756)\nFile:Set of fourteen side chairs MET DP110781.jpg|Chippendale chair (1772), Metropolitan Museum\nFile:Brazier MET 202187.jpg|Brazier by silversmith Charles Friedrich Kander (1735), Metropolitan Museum\n</gallery>\n\n==Russia==\nThe Russian Empress [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]] was another admirer of the Rococo; The Golden Cabinet of the Chinese Palace in the palace complex of [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]] near Saint Petersburg, designed by the Italian [[Antonio Rinaldi (architect)|Antonio Rinaldi]], is an example of the Russian Rococo.\n\n==Decline and end==\n{{See also|Neoclassicism|Empire style}}\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align = \n| total_width = 350\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer = Comparison between an 18th century [[etching]], by [[Jacques de Lajoue]], of a Rococo [[Krater#Calyx krater|calyx krater]]; and a 1st century [[Roman Empire|Roman]] calyx krater which has the exactly same shape like a [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] stone garden vase\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 = Title Page from Book of Vases MET DP290845.jpg\n| width1 = \n| height1 = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2 = Marble calyx-krater with reliefs of maidens and dancing maenads MET DT4541.jpg\n| width2 = \n| height2 = \n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\n\nThe art of [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher|Boucher]] and other painters of the period, with its emphasis on decorative mythology and gallantry, soon inspired a reaction, and a demand for more \"noble\" themes. While the Rococo continued in Germany and Austria, the French Academy in Rome began to teach the classic style. This was confirmed by the nomination of [[Le Troy]] as director of the Academy in 1738, and then in 1751 by [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]].\n\n[[Madame de Pompadour]], the mistress of Louis XV contributed to the decline of the Rococo style. In 1750 she sent her brother, [[Abel-Fran\u00e7ois Poisson|Abel-Fran\u00e7ois Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res]], on a two-year mission to study artistic and archeological developments in Italy. He was accompanied by several artists, including the engraver [[Charles-Nicolas Cochin]] and the architect [[Soufflot]]. They returned to Paris with a passion for classical art. Vandi\u00e9res became the Marquis of Marigny, and was named director general of the King's Buildings. He turned official French architecture toward the neoclassical. Cochin became an important art critic; he denounced the ''petit style'' of Boucher, and called for a grand style with a new emphasis on antiquity and nobility in the academies of painting and architecture.{{sfn|Cabanne|1988|p. 106}}\n\nThe beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel]] began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art. Blondel decried the \"ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants\" in contemporary interiors.<ref>[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung6/allg/buch.xml?docname=blondel1737]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref>\n\nBy 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of Neoclassical artists like [[Jacques-Louis David]]. In Germany, late 18th-century Rococo was ridiculed as ''Zopf und Per\u00fccke'' (\"pigtail and periwig\"), and this phase is sometimes referred to as ''Zopfstil''. Rococo remained popular in certain German provincial states and in Italy, until the second phase of neoclassicism, \"[[Empire style]]\", arrived with Napoleonic governments and swept Rococo away.\n\n==Furniture and decoration==\nThe ornamental style called ''[[rocaille]]'' emerged in France between 1710 and 1750, mostly during the regency and reign of [[Louis XV]]; the style was also called ''[[Louis Quinze]]''. Its principal characteristics were picturesque detail, curves and counter-curves, asymmetry, and a theatrical exuberance. On the walls of new Paris salons, the twisting and winding designs, usually made of gilded or painted stucco, wound around the doorways and mirrors like vines. One of the earliest examples was the [[H\u00f4tel Soubise]] in Paris (1704\u201305), with its famous oval salon decorated with paintings by Boucher, and [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]].{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=102}}\n\nThe best known French furniture designer of the period was [[Juste-Aur\u00e8le Meissonnier]] (1695\u20131750), who was also a sculptor, painter. and goldsmith for the royal household. He held the title of official designer to the Chamber and Cabinet of Louis XV. His work is well known today because of the enormous number of engravings made of his work which popularized the style throughout Europe. He designed works for the royal families of Poland and Portugal.\n\nItaly was another place where the Rococo flourished, both in its early and later phases. Craftsmen in Rome, Milan and Venice all produced lavishly decorated furniture and decorative items.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Juste-aur\u00e8lie messonier, candelabro d'argento, Parigi, 1734-1735 , 02.JPG|Candlelabra by [[Juste-Aur\u00e8le Meissonnier]] (1735\u201340)\nFile:Juste-Aur\u00e8le Meissonnier - \"Chariot of Apollo,\" Ceiling Design for Count Bielinski's Cabinet, Warsaw, Poland - Google Art Project.jpg|''Chariot of Apollo'' design for a ceiling of Count Bielinski by [[Meissonier]], Warsaw, Poland (1734)\nFile:Juste-Aur\u00e8le Meissonnier - Canap\u00e9 execut\u00e9 pour Mr. le Comte de Bielinski Grand M.al de la Couronne de Pologne, en 1735.; Canap\u00e9... - Google Art Project.jpg|Canap\u00e9 designed by Meissonnier for Count Bielinski, Warsaw, Poland (1735)\nFile:Bottega romana, console, 1710 ca., base in legno e piano di marmo.JPG|Console table, Rome, Italy (circa 1710)\n</gallery>\n\nThe sculpted decoration included fleurettes, palmettes, seashells, and foliage, carved in wood. The most extravagant rocaille forms were found in the consoles, tables designed to stand against walls. The Commodes, or chests, which had first appeared under Louis XIV, were richly decorated with rocaille ornament made of gilded bronze. They were made by master craftsmen including [[Jean-Pierre Latz]] and also featured marquetry of different-coloured woods, sometimes placed in checkerboard cubic patterns, made with light and dark woods. The period also saw the arrival of [[Chinoiserie]], often in the form of lacquered and gilded commodes, called ''falcon de Chine'' of ''Vernis Martin'', after the ebenist who introduced the technique to France. [[Ormolu]], or gilded bronze, was used by master craftsmen including [[Jean-Pierre Latz]]. Latz made a particularly ornate clock mounted atop a cartonnier for [[Frederick the Great]] for his palace in [[Potsdam]]. Pieces of [[Chinese export porcelain|imported Chinese porcelain]] were often mounted in [[ormolu]] (gilded bronze) rococo settings for display on tables or consoles in salons. Other craftsmen imitated the [[Japanese lacquer|Japanese art of lacquered furniture]], and produced commodes with Japanese motifs.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=144}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Secretaire - Bernard II van Risamburgh - M\u00fcnchner Residenz - DSC07490.JPG|Desk for the [[M\u00fcnchner Residenz]] by [[Bernard II van Risamburgh]] (1737)\nFile:Kambli Cartonnier with a clock of Frederick II.jpg|Clock-chest for [[Frederick the Great]] (1742)\nFile:Chinese - Bowl Mounted with Two Fish - Walters 492266.jpg|A Chinese porcelain bowl and two fish mounted in gilded bronze, France (1745\u201349)\nFile:LatzEncoignure1a.jpg|An [[encoignure]] by royal cabinetmaker [[Jean-Pierre Latz]] (circa 1750)\nFile:Commode.jpg|Lacquered Commode in Chinoiserie style, by [[Bernard II van Risamburgh]], Victoria and Albert Museum (1750\u20131760)\n</gallery>\n\n[[Great Britain|British]] Rococo tended to be more restrained. Thomas Chippendale's furniture designs kept the curves and feel, but stopped short of the French heights of whimsy. The most successful exponent of British Rococo was probably [[Thomas Johnson (designer)|Thomas Johnson]], a gifted carver and furniture designer working in London in the mid-18th century.\n\n==Painting==\nElements of the ''Rocaille'' style appeared in the work of some French painters, including a taste for the picturesque in details; curves and counter-curves; and dissymmetry which replaced the movement of the baroque with exuberance, though the French ''rocaille'' never reached the extravagance of the Germanic rococo.{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=98}} The leading proponent was [[Antoine Watteau]], particularly in [[Embarkation for Cythera|''Pilgrimage on the Isle of Cythera'']] (1717), [[Louvre Museum|Louvre]], in a genre called ''[[F\u00eate galante|F\u00eate Galante]]'' depicting scenes of young nobles gathered together to celebrate in a pastoral setting. Watteau died in 1721 at the age of thirty-seven, but his work continued to have influence through the rest of the century. The ''Pilgrimage to Cythera'' painting was purchased by [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia in 1752 or 1765 to decorate his palace of [[Charlottenberg]] in Berlin.{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=98}}\n\nThe successor of Watteau and the ''F\u00e9te Galante'' in decorative painting was [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]] (1703\u20131770), the favorite painter of [[Madame de Pompadour]]. His work included the sensual ''Toilette de Venus'' (1746), which became one of the best known examples of the style. Boucher participated in all of the genres of the time, designing tapestries, models for porcelain sculpture, set decorations for the Paris opera and ''opera-comique'', and decor for the Fair of Saint-Laurent. {{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=104}} Other important painters of the ''F\u00eate Galante'' style included [[Nicolas Lancret]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Pater]]. The style particularly influenced [[Fran\u00e7ois Lemoyne]], who painted the lavish decoration of the ceiling of the Salon of Hercules at the [[Palace of Versailles]], completed in 1735.{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=98}} Paintings with f\u00e9tes gallant and mythological themes by Boucher, [[Pierre-Charles Tr\u00e9moli\u00e8res]] and [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]] decorated the famous salon of the [[H\u00f4tel Soubise]] in Paris (1735\u201340).{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=104}} Other Rococo painters include: [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois de Troy]] (1679\u20131752), [[Jean-Baptiste van Loo]] (1685\u20131745), his two sons [[Louis-Michel van Loo]] (1707\u20131771) and [[Charles-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Philippe van Loo]] (1719\u20131795), his younger brother [[Charles-Andr\u00e9 van Loo]] (1705\u20131765), and [[Nicolas Lancret]] (1690\u20131743).\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:L'Embarquement pour Cythere, by Antoine Watteau, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|[[Antoine Watteau]], [[Embarkation for Cythera|''Pilgrimage on the Isle of Cythera'']] (1717)\nFile:D\u00e9jeuner de jambon - Nicolas Lancret - mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9.jpg|\"[[The Ham Dinner|Luncheon with Ham]]\" by [[Nicolas Lancret]] (1735)\nFile:Fran\u00e7ois Lemoyne - L'Apoth\u00e9ose d'Hercule - Google Art Project.jpg|Ceiling of the Salon of Hercules by [[Fran\u00e7ois Lemoyne]] (1735)\nFile:The Toilet of Venus, by Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.jpg|''The Toilet of Venus'' by [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]] (1746) \n</gallery>\n\nIn Austria and Southern Germany, Italian painting had the largest effect on the Rococo style.

It was most commonly found in the interiors of churches, usually closely integrated with painting and the architecture. Religious sculpture followed the Italian baroque style, as exemplified in the theatrical altarpiece of the [[Karlskirche]] in Vienna.\n\nEarly Rococo or [[Rocaille]] sculpture in France sculpture was lighter and offered more movement than the classical style of Louis XIV. It was encouraged in particular by [[Madame de Pompadour]], mistress of Louis XV, who commissioned many works for her chateaux and gardens. The sculptor [[Edm\u00e9 Bouchardon]] represented [[Cupid]] engaged in carving his darts of love from the club of [[Hercules]]. Rococo figures also crowded the later fountains at Versailles, such as the Fountain of Neptune by [[Lambert-Sigisbert Adam]] and [[Nicolas-Sebastien Adam]] (1740). Based on their success at Versailles, they were invited to Prussia by [[Frederick the Great]] to create fountain sculpture for [[Sanssouci]] Palace, Prussia (1740s).<ref>Duby, Georges and Daval, Jean-Luc, ''La Sculpture de l'Antiquit\u00e9 au XXe Si\u00e8cle'', (2013) pp. 789-791</ref>\n\n[[\u00c9tienne-Maurice Falconet]] (1716\u20131791) was another leading French sculptor during the period. Falconet was most famous for his statue of [[Peter the Great]] on horseback in St. Petersburg, but he also created a series of smaller works for wealthy collectors, which could be reproduced in a series in [[terra-cotta]] or cast in bronze. The French sculptors, [[Jean-Louis Lemoyne]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne]], [[Louis-Simon Boizot]], [[Michel Clodion]], [[Lambert-Sigisbert Adam]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Pigalle]] all produced sculpture in series for collectors.<ref>Duby, Georges and Daval, Jean-Luc, ''La Sculpture de l'Antiquit\u00e9 au XXe Si\u00e8cle'', (2013) p. 819</ref>\n\nIn Italy, [[Antonio Corradini]] was among the leading sculptors of the Rococo style. A Venetian, he travelled around Europe, working for [[Peter the Great]] in St. Petersburg, for the imperial courts in Austria and Naples. He preferred sentimental themes and made several skilled works of women with faces covered by veils, one of which is now in the [[Louvre]].<ref>Duby, Georges and Daval, Jean-Luc, ''La Sculpture de l'Antiquit\u00e9 au XXe Si\u00e8cle'', (2013) pp. 781-832</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Wien-Landstra\u00dfe, Oberes Belvedere, Tr\u00e4gerfigur.JPG|Atlantides in the upper [[Belvedere Palace]], Vienna, by [[Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt]] (1721\u201322)\nFile:Kloster Rohr in Nby Detail Hochaltar.JPG|[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]] scene by [[Egid Quirin Asam]] (1722\u201323) former monastery church, [[Rohr in Niederbayern]]\nFile:El Transparente.jpg|''El Transparente'' altar in [[Toledo Cathedral]] by [[Narciso Tom\u00e9]] (1721\u201332)\nFile:Fa\u00e7ana del Palau del Marqu\u00e9s de Dosaig\u00fces.JPG|Portal of the Palace of the Marquis de Dos Aguas, Valencia, Spain (1740-1744)\nFile:Versalles Fuente de Neptuno 02.JPG|Fountain of Neptune and Amphitrite [[Palace of Versailles]], by [[Lambert-Sigisbert Adam]] and [[Nicolas-Sebastien Adam]] (1740)\nFile:8002.Element Luft-2 Nymphen mit erlegtem Reiher(1739)-Lambert Sigisbert Adam-Sanssouci Steffen Heilfort.JPG|Fountain nymphs by [[Lambert Sigisbert Adam]] at [[Sanssouci]] palace, Prussia (1740s)\n</gallery>\n\nThe most elaborate examples of rococo sculpture were found in Spain, Austria and southern Germany, in the decoration of palaces and churches. The sculpture was closely integrated with the architecture; it was impossible to know where one stopped and the other began. In the [[Belvedere Palace]] in Vienna, (1721-1722), the vaulted ceiling of the Hall of the Atlantes is held up on the shoulders of muscular figures designed by [[Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt]]. The portal of the Palace of the Marquis of Dos Aguas in Valencia (1715-1776) was completely drenched in sculpture carved in marble, from designs by Hipolito Rovira Brocandel.<ref>Duby, Georges and Daval, Jean-Luc, ''La Sculpture de l'Antiquit\u00e9 au XXe Si\u00e8cle'', (2013) pp. 782-783</ref>\n\nThe ''El Transparente'' altar, in the major chapel of [[Toledo Cathedral]] is a towering sculpture of polychrome marble and gilded stucco, combined with paintings, statues and symbols. It was made by Narciso Tom\u00e9 (1721\u201332), Its design allows light to pass through, and in changing light it seems to move.<ref>Duby, Georges and Daval, Jean-Luc, ''La Sculpture de l'Antiquit\u00e9 au XXe Si\u00e8cle'', (2013) pp. 802-803</ref>\n\n==Porcelain==\nA new form of small-scale sculpture appeared, the [[porcelain]] figure, or small group of figures, initially replacing sugar sculptures on grand dining room tables, but soon popular for placing on mantelpieces and furniture. The number of European factories grew steadily through the century, and some made porcelain that the expanding middle classes could afford. The amount of colourful [[overglaze decoration]] used on them also increased. They were usually modelled by artists who had trained in sculpture. Common subjects included figures from the [[commedia dell'arte]], city street vendors, lovers and figures in fashionable clothes, and pairs of birds.\n\n[[Johann Joachim K\u00e4ndler]] was the most important modeller of [[Meissen porcelain]], the earliest European factory, which remained the most important until about 1760. The Swiss-born German sculptor [[Franz Anton Bustelli]] produced a wide variety of colourful figures for the [[Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory]] in Bavaria, which were sold throughout Europe. The French sculptor [[\u00c9tienne-Maurice Falconet]] (1716\u20131791) followed this example. While also making large-scale works, he became director of the [[Sevres Porcelain]] manufactory and produced small-scale works, usually about love and gaiety, for production in series.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:The Music Lesson MET DP-14272-001 (cropped).jpg|''The Music Lesson'', [[Chelsea porcelain]], Metropolitican Museum (c. 1765)\nFile:Karlskirche October 2006 005.jpg|High altar of the [[Karlskirche]] in Vienna (1737)\nFile:Cup and Saucer LACMA 47.35.6a-b (1 of 3).jpg|Cup with saucer; circa 1753; soft-paste porcelain with glaze and enamel; [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]\nFile:Mezzetin, Johann Joachim Kaendler, Meissen Porcelain Factory, c. 1739, hard-paste porcelain - Wadsworth Atheneum - Hartford, CT - DSC05311.jpg|[[Mezzetin]], by [[Johann Joachim Kaendler|Kaendler]], [[Meissen porcelain|Meissen]], c. 1739\nFile:Harlequin and Columbine MET DP169015 (cropped).jpg|''[[Harlequin]] and [[Columbina|Columbine]]'', [[Capodimonte porcelain]], c. 1745\nFile:Bustelli Liebesgruppe Der gest\u00f6rte Schl\u00e4fer BNM.jpg|''Pair of lovers'' group of [[Nymphenburg porcelain]], c. 1760, modelled by [[Franz Anton Bustelli]]\nFile:Bustelli K\u00e4smann BNM.jpg|Figure of a cheese seller by Bustelli, [[Nymphenburg porcelain]] (1755)\n</gallery>\n\n==Music==\nA Rococo period existed in [[music history]], although it is not as well known as the earlier Baroque and later Classical forms. The Rococo music style itself developed out of baroque music both in France, where the new style was referred to as [[Galante music|''style galante'']] (\"gallant\" or \"elegant\" style), and in Germany, where it was referred to as ''empfindsamer Stil'' (\"sensitive style\"). It can be characterized as light, intimate music with extremely elaborate and refined forms of [[ornamentation (music)|ornamentation]]. Exemplars include [[Jean Philippe Rameau]], [[Louis-Claude Daquin]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Couperin]] in France; in Germany, the style's main proponents were [[C. P. E. Bach]] and [[Johann Christian Bach]], two sons of [[J.S. Bach]].\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, a reaction against the Rococo style occurred, primarily against its perceived overuse of ornamentation and decoration. Led by [[C.P.E. Bach]] (an accomplished Rococo composer in his own right), [[Domenico Scarlatti]], and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], this reaction ushered in the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]]. By the early 19th century, Catholic opinion had turned against the suitability of the style for ecclesiastical contexts because it was \"in no way conducive to sentiments of devotion\".<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13106a.htm Rococo Style \u2013 Catholic Encyclopedia].

This gown had the features of a bodice with large pleats flowing down the back to the ground over a rounded petticoat. The colour palate was rich, dark fabrics accompanied by elaborate, heavy design features. After the death of Louis XIV the clothing styles began to change. The fashion took a turn to a lighter, more frivolous style, transitioning from the baroque period to the well-known style of Rococo.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2016/09-10/daily-life-france-fashion-marie-antoinette/|title=Marie Antoinette's Style Revolution|last=|first=|date=|website=National Geographic|access-date=22 April 2018}}</ref> The later period was known for their pastel colours, more revealing frocks, and the plethora of frills, ruffles, bows, and lace as trims. Shortly after the typical women's Rococo gown was introduced, ''robe \u00e0 la Fran\u00e7oise,''<ref name=\":0\" /> a gown with a tight bodice that had a low cut neckline, usually with a large ribbon bows down the centre front, wide panniers, and was lavishly trimmed in large amounts of lace, ribbon, and flowers.\n\nThe ''Watteau pleats''<ref name=\":0\" /> also became more popular, named after the painter Jean-Antoine Watteau, who painted the details of the gowns down to the stitches of lace and other trimmings with immense accuracy. Later, the ''<nowiki/>'pannier'<nowiki/>'' and ''<nowiki/>'mantua''<nowiki/>' became fashionable around 1718, they were wide hoops under the dress to extend the hips out sideways and they soon became a staple in formal wear. This gave the Rococo period the iconic dress of wide hips combined with the large amount of decoration on the garments. Wide panniers were worn for special occasions, and could reach up to 16 feet (4.8 metres) in diameter,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/18sil/hd_18sil.htm|title=Eighteenth-Century Silhouette and Support|last=Glasscock|first=J.|date=|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=22 April 2018}}</ref> and smaller hoops were worn for the everyday settings. These features originally came from seventeenth-century Spanish fashion, known as ''guardainfante'', initially designed to hide the pregnant stomach, then reimagined later as the pannier.<ref name=\":2\" /> 1745 became the Golden Age of the Rococo with the introduction of a more exotic, oriental culture in France called ''a la turque''.<ref name=\":0\" /> This was made popular by Louis XV's mistress, Madame Pompadour, who commissioned the artist, Charles Andre Van Loo, to paint her as a Turkish sultana.\n\nIn the 1760s, a style of less formal dresses emerged and one of these was the ''polonaise'', with inspiration taken from Poland. It was shorter than the French dress, allowing the underskirt and ankles to be seen, which made it easier to move around in. Another dress that came into fashion was the ''robe a l'anglais'', which included elements inspired by the males' fashion; a short jacket, broad lapels and long sleeves.<ref name=\":1\" /> It also had a snug bodice, a full skirt without panniers but still a little long in the back to form a small train, and often some type of lace kerchief worn around the neck. Another piece was the 'redingote', halfway between a cape and an overcoat.\n\nAccessories were also important to all women during this time, as they added to the opulence and the decor of the body to match their gowns. At any official ceremony ladies were required to cover their hands and arms with gloves if their clothes were sleeveless.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Gallery==\n\n===Architecture===\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Igreja de S\u00e3o Francisco de Assis, Ouro Preto.JPG|[[Church of S\u00e3o Francisco de Assis, Ouro Preto|Church of S\u00e3o Francisco de Assis]] in [[Ouro Preto]], Brazil, 1749\u20131774, by [[Aleijadinho]]\nFile:Fine arts academy - panoramio.jpg|[[Czapski Palace]] in [[Warsaw]], Poland, 1712\u20131721, reflects rococo's fascinations of [[orient]]al architecture\nFile:St. Andriy's Church in Kyiv.jpg|[[St Andrew's Church, Kiev|St. Andrew's Church]] in [[Kiev]], 1744\u20131767, designed by [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli]]\nFile:Dresden-Zwinger-Wallpavillion-gp.jpg|[[Zwinger (Dresden)|Zwinger]] in Dresden\nFile:Esterh\u00e1zy-kast\u00e9ly (4051. sz\u00e1m\u00fa m\u0171eml\u00e9k) 2.jpg|[[Eszterh\u00e1za]] in [[Fert\u0151d]], [[Hungary]], 1720\u20131766, sometimes called the \"''Hungarian Versailles''\"\nFile:150913 Branicki Palace in Bia\u0142ystok - 09.jpg|The Rococo [[Branicki Palace, Bia\u0142ystok|Branicki Palace in Bia\u0142ystok]], sometimes referred to as the \"''Polish Versailles''\"\nTrier Kurfuerstliches Palais BW 1.JPG|Electoral Palace of [[Trier]]\nFile:Convento Santo Domingo - Lima.jpg|[[Basilica of Santo Domingo, Lima|Basilica of Santo Domingo]] in [[Lima]], Peru, completed in 1766, by [[Manuel de Amat y Junyent|Manuel d'Amat i de Junyent]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Engravings===\n<gallery widths=\"220px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:Allegories of astronomy and geography.jpg|Unknown artist.

While there is still some debate about the historical significance of the style, Rococo is now often considered as a distinct period in the development of [[European art]].\n\n==Characteristics==\nRococo features exuberant decoration, with an abundance of curves, counter-curves, undulations and elements modeled on nature. The exteriors of Rococo buildings are often simple, while the interiors are entirely dominated by their ornament. The style was highly theatrical, designed to impress and awe at first sight. Floor plans of churches were often complex, featuring interlocking ovals; In palaces, grand stairways became centrepieces, and offered different points of view of the decoration.{{Sfn|Hopkins|2014|page=92}} The main ornaments of Rococo are: asymmetrical shells, [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] and other leaves, birds, bouquets of flowers, fruits, musical instruments, angels and [[Chinoiserie|Far Eastern elements]] ([[pagoda]]s, dragons, monkeys, bizarre flowers and Chinese people).<ref>{{cite book |last1= Graur|first1=Neaga|title=Stiluri \u00een arta decorativ\u0103|date=1970|publisher=Cerces|page=193 & 194|url=|language=ro}}</ref>\n\nThe style often integrated painting, molded stucco, and wood carving, and ''[[quadratura]]'', or illusionist ceiling paintings, which were designed to give the impression that those entering the room were looking up at the sky, where cherubs and other figures were gazing down at them. Materials used included stucco, either painted or left white; combinations of different colored woods (usually oak, beech or walnut); lacquered wood in the Japanese style, ornament of gilded bronze, and marble tops of commodes or tables.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Graur|first1=Neaga|title=Stiluri \u00een arta decorativ\u0103|date=1970|publisher=Cerces|page=194|url=|language=ro}}</ref> The intent was to create an impression of surprise, awe and wonder on first view.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=144}}\n\n==Differences between Baroque and Rococo==\nThe following are characteristics that Rococo has, and Baroque does not:\n*The partial abandonment of symmetry, everything being composed of graceful lines and curves, similar to [[Art Nouveau]]\n*The huge quantity of asymmetrical curves and C-shaped [[volute]]s\n*The very wide use of flowers in ornamentation, an example being [[festoon]]s made of flowers\n*Chinese and Japanese motifs (see also: [[chinoiserie]] and [[Japonism]])\n*Warm pastel colours<ref>{{cite book |last1= Graur|first1=Neaga|title=Stiluri \u00een arta decorativ\u0103|date=1970|publisher=Cerces|page=160 & 163|url=|language=ro}}</ref> (whitish-yellow, cream-colored, pearl greys, very light blues)<ref>{{cite book |last1= Graur|first1=Neaga|title=Stiluri \u00een arta decorativ\u0103|date=1970|publisher=Cerces|page=192|url=|language=ro}}</ref>\n\n==France==\n{{See also|Rocaille|Louis Quinze}}\n\nThe ''[[Rocaille]]'' style, or French Rococo, appeared in Paris during the reign of [[Louis XV]], and flourished between about 1723 and 1759.<ref>Lovreglio, Aur\u00e9lia and Anne, ''Dictionnaire des Mobiliers et des Objets d'art'', Le Robert, Paris, 2006, p. 369</ref> The style was used particularly in salons, a new style of room designed to impress and entertain guests. The most prominent example was the salon of the Princess in [[H\u00f4tel de Soubise]] in Paris, designed by [[Germain Boffrand]] and [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]] (1735\u201340). The characteristics of French Rococo included exceptional artistry, especially in the complex frames made for mirrors and paintings, which were sculpted in plaster and often gilded; and the use of vegetal forms (vines, leaves, flowers) intertwined in complex designs.{{Sfn|Hopkins|2014|pp. 92-93}} The furniture also featured sinuous curves and vegetal designs. The leading furniture designers and craftsmen in the style included [[Juste-Aurele Meissonier]], [[Charles Cressent]], and [[Nicolas Pineau]].{{Sfn|De Morant|1970|page=382}}<ref name=\"Kleiner2010\">{{cite book|last=Kleiner|first=Fred|title=Gardner's art through the ages: the western perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IJrN8rDirxkC&pg=PA587|accessdate=21 February 2011|year=2010|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-57355-5|pages=583\u2013584}}</ref>\n\nThe Rocaille style lasted in France until the mid-18th century, and while it became more curving and vegetal, it never achieved the extravagant exuberance of the Rococo in Bavaria, Austria and Italy. The discoveries of Roman antiquities beginning in 1738 at [[Herculanum]] and especially at [[Pompeii]] in 1748 turned French architecture in the direction of the more symmetrical and less flamboyant [[Neoclassicism in France#Architecture|neo-classicism]].\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Salon de la princesse hotel de soubise.jpg|Salon of the [[H\u00f4tel de Soubise]] in Paris (1735\u201340) by [[Germain Boffrand]]\nFile:MeissonnierTable.jpg|Table design by [[Juste-Aurele Meissonier]] (1730)\nFile:Hotel de Soubise - Grande chambre de la princesse 3.JPG|Grand Chamber of the Prince, Hotel de Soubise (1735\u201340)\nFile:Boiserie from the H\u00f4tel de Varengeville MET DP214174.jpg|Woodwork in the H\u00f4tel de Varengeville by [[Nicolas Pineau]] (1735)\nFile:Charles Cressent, Chest of drawers, c. 1730 at Waddesdon Manor.jpg|Commode by [[Charles Cressent]] (1730), Waddleston Manor\n</gallery>\n\n==Italy==\nArtists in Italy, particularly [[Venice]], also produced an exuberant rococo style. Venetian commodes imitated the curving lines and carved ornament of the French rocaille, but with a particular Venetian variation; the pieces were painted, often with landscapes or flowers or scenes from [[Guardi]] or other painters, or [[Chinoiserie]], against a blue or green background, matching the colours of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]] of painters whose work decorated the salons. Notable decorative painters included [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]], who painted ceilings and murals of both churches and palazzos, and [[Giovanni Battista Crosato]] who painted the ballroom ceiling of the [[Ca Rezzonico]] in the [[illusionistic ceiling painting|quadraturo]] manner, giving the illusion of three dimensions. Tiepelo travelled to Germany with his son during 1752\u20131754, decorating the ceilings of the [[W\u00fcrzburg Residence]], one of the major landmarks of the Bavarian rococo. An earlier celebrated Venetian painter was [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]], who painted several notable church ceilings. {{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=383}}\n\nThe Venetian Rococo also featured exceptional glassware, particularly [[Murano glass]], often engraved and coloured, which was exported across Europe. Works included multicolour chandeliers and mirrors with extremely ornate frames. {{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=383}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Interior of Santi Giovanni e Paolo (Venice) - The Glory of St. Dominic by Piazzetta.jpg|Ceiling of church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice, by [[Piazzetta]] (1727)\nFile:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Juno and Luna - Google Art Project.jpg|''Juno and Luna'' by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] (1735\u201345)\nFile:Lampadario in vetro di Murano - Ca' Rezzonico, Venice.jpg|[[Murano glass]] chandelier at the [[Ca Rezzonico]] (1758)\nFile:Ca' Rezzonico (Venice) - Ceiling of the Ballroom.jpeg|Ballroom ceiling of the [[Ca Rezzonico]] with ceiling by [[Giovanni Battista Crosato]] (1753)\n</gallery>\n\n==Southern Germany==\n{{see also|Frederician Rococo}}\nThe Rococo decorative style reached its summit in southern Germany and central Europe from the 1730s until the 1770s. It was first introduced from France through the publications and works of French architects and decorators, including the sculptor [[Claude III Audran]], the interior designer [[Gilles-Marie Oppenordt]], the architect [[Germain Boffrand]], the sculptor Jean Mondon, and the draftsman and engraver [[Pierre Lepautre (1652\u20131716)|Pierre Lepautre]]. Their work had an important influence on the German Rococo style.<ref>De Morant, Henry, ''Histoire des arts d\u00e9coratifs'' (1977), pp. 354\u2013355</ref>\n\nGerman architects adapted the Rococo style but made it far more asymmetric and loaded with more ornate decoration than the French original. The German style was characterized by an explosion of forms that cascaded down the walls. It featured molding formed into curves and counter-curves, twisting and turning patterns, ceilings and walls with no right angles, and stucco foliage which seemed to be creeping up the walls and across the ceiling. The decoration was often gilded or silvered to give it contrast with the white or pale pastel walls.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|pages=150-153}}\n\nThe Belgian-born architect and designer [[Fran\u00e7ois de Cuvilli\u00e9s]] was one of the first to create a Rococo building in Germany, with the pavilion of [[Amalienburg]] in Munich, (1734-1739), inspired by the pavilions of the [[Grand Trianon|Trianon]] and [[Ch\u00e2teau de Marly|Marly]] in France. It was built as a hunting lodge, with a platform on the roof for shooting pheasants. The Hall of Mirrors in the interior, by the painter and stucco sculptor [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]], was far more exuberant than any French Rococo.<ref>Ducher, ''Caract\u00e9ristique des Styles'' (1988), p. 150</ref>\n\nAnother notable example of the early German Rococo is [[W\u00fcrzburg Residence]] (1737\u20131744) constructed for the Prince-Bishop of Wurzburg by [[Balthasar Neumann]]. Neumann had traveled to Paris and consulted with the French rocaille decorative artists [[Germain Boffrand]] and [[Robert de Cotte]]. While the exterior was in more sober Baroque style, the interior, particularly the stairways and ceilings, was much lighter and decorative. The Prince-Bishop imported the Italian Rococo painter [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] in 1750\u201353 to create a mural over the top of the three-level ceremonial stairway.<ref name=\"Demartini 2006 pp. 222\">Prina and Demartini (2006) pp. 222\u2013223</ref><ref>https://www.bavaria.by/experiences/city-country-culture/castles-palaces/wuerzburg-residence; https://www.bavaria.by/experiences/city-country-culture/castles-palaces/wuerzburg-residence; B.M. Field ''The World's Greatest Architecture: Past and Present'', Regency House Publishing Ltd, 2001.</ref> Neumann described the interior of the residence as \"a theater of light\". The stairway was also the central element in a residence Neumann built at the [[Augustusburg and Falkenlust Palaces, Br\u00fchl|Augustusburg Palace in Br\u00fchl]] (1743\u20131748). In that building the stairway led the visitors up through a stucco fantasy of paintings, sculpture, ironwork and decoration, with surprising views at every turn.<ref name=\"Demartini 2006 pp. 222\"/>\n\nIn the 1740s and 1750s, a number of notable pilgrimage churches were constructed in [[Bavaria]], with interiors decorated in a distinctive variant of the rococo style. One of the most notable examples is the [[Wieskirche]] (1745\u20131754) designed by [[Dominikus Zimmermann]]. Like most of the Bavarian pilgrimage churches, the exterior is very simple, with pastel walls, and little ornament. Entering the church the visitor encounters an astonishing theater of movement and light. It features an oval-shaped sanctuary, and a deambulatory in the same form, filling in the church with light from all sides. The white walls contrasted with columns of blue and pink stucco in the choir, and the domed ceiling surrounded by plaster angels below a dome representing the heavens crowded with colorful Biblical figures. Other notable pilgrimage churches include the [[Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers]] by [[Balthasar Neumann]] (1743\u20131772).{{Sfn|Ducher|1988| page=152}}{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|pp. 89\u201394}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Schloss Amalienburg (6317867213).jpg|[[Amalienburg]] pavilion in Munich by [[Fran\u00e7ois de Cuvilli\u00e9s]] (1734\u20131739)\nFile:Amalienburg Spiegelsaal-1.jpg|Hall of Mirrors of [[Amalienburg]] by [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]] (1734\u20131739)\nFile:NRW, Bruhl, Augustusburg 01.jpg|Looking up the central stairway at [[Augustusburg and Falkenlust Palaces, Br\u00fchl|Augustusburg Palace in Br\u00fchl]] by [[Balthasar Neumann]] (1741\u20131744)\nFile:Wieskirche 003.JPG|The [[Wieskirche]] by [[Dominikus Zimmermann]] (1745\u20131754)\nFile:Vierzehnheiligen-Basilika3-Asio.JPG|Interior of the [[Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers]] by [[Balthasar Neumann]] (1743\u20131772)\nFile:Kaisersaal W\u00fcrzburg.jpg|The Kaisersaal in the [[W\u00fcrzburg Residence]] by [[Balthasar Neumann]] (1749\u20131751)\nFile:Festsaal Schaetzlerpalais.JPG|Festival Hall of the [[Schaezlerpalais]] in [[Augsburg]] by [[Carl Albert von Lespilliez]] (1765\u20131770)\nFile:\u041a\u0418\u0422\u0410\u0419\u0421\u041a\u0418\u0419 \u0414\u0412\u041e\u0420\u0415\u0426. \u0417\u041e\u041b\u041e\u0422\u041e\u0419 \u041a\u0410\u0411\u0418\u041d\u0415\u0422.jpg|Golden Cabinet of the Chinese Palace, [[Oranienbaum, Russia]], built by [[Antonio Rinaldi (architect)|Antonio Rinaldi]] for [[Catherine the Great]] (1762\u20131778)\n</gallery>\n\n[[Johann Michael Fischer]] was the architect of [[Ottobeuren Abbey]] (1748\u20131766), another Bavarian Rococo landmark. The church features, like much of the rococo architecture in Germany, a remarkable contrast between the regularity of the facade and the overabundance of decoration in the interior.<ref name=\"Demartini 2006 pp. 222\"/>\n\n==Britain==\nIn Great Britain, rococo was called the \"French taste\" and had less influence on design and the decorative arts than in continental Europe, although its influence was felt in such areas as silverwork, porcelain, and silks. [[William Hogarth]] helped develop a theoretical foundation for Rococo beauty. Though not mentioning rococo by name, he argued in his ''Analysis of Beauty'' (1753) that the undulating lines and S-curves prominent in Rococo were the basis for grace and beauty in art or nature (unlike the straight line or the circle in [[Classicism]]).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dummies.com/education/art-appreciation/the-rococo-influence-in-british-art/|title=The Rococo Influence in British Art - dummies|work=dummies|access-date=2017-06-23|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nRococo was slow in arriving in England. Before entering the Rococo, British furniture for a time followed the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] [[Palladian]] model under designer [[William Kent]], who designed for Lord Burlington and other important patrons of the arts. Kent travelled to Italy with Lord Burlington between 1712 and 1720, and brought back many models and ideas from Palladio. He designed the furniture for [[Hampton Court Palace]] (1732), Lord Burlington's [[Chiswick House]] (1729), London, Thomas Coke's [[Holkham Hall]], Norfolk, Robert Walpole's pile at [[Houghton Hall|Houghton]], for [[Devonshire House]] in London, and at Rousham.{{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=382}}\n\n[[Mahogany]] made its appearance in England in about 1720, and immediately became popular for furniture, along with [[walnut]] wood. The Rococo began to make an appearance in England between 1740 and 1750. The furniture of [[Thomas Chippendale]] was the closest to the Rococo style, In 1754 he published \"Gentleman's and Cabinet-makers' directory\", a catalog of designs for rococo, ''chinoiserie'' and even Gothic furniture, which achieved wide popularity, going through three editions. Unlike French designers, Chippendale did not employ marquetry or inlays in his furniture. The predominant designer of inlaid furniture were Vile and Cob, the cabinet-makers for King George III. Another important figure in British furniture was [[Thomas Johnson (designer)|Thomas Johnson]], who in 1761, very late in the period, published a catalog of Rococo furniture designs. These include furnishings based on rather fantastic Chinese and Indian motifs, including a canopy bed crowned by a Chinese pagoda (now in the Victoria and Albert Museum).{{Sfn|de Morant|1970|page=383}}\n\nOther notable figures in the British Rococo included the silversmith Charles Friedrich Kandler.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:A Design for a State Bed From Chippendale's Director.jpg|Design for a State Bed by [[Thomas Chippendale]] (1753\u201354)\nFile:Chinese Sopha -Sofa-, in Chippendale Drawings, Vol. I MET DP104166.jpg|Proposed Chinese sofa by [[Thomas Chippendale]] (1753\u201354)\nFile:French Commode and Lamp Stands.jpg|Design for Commode and lamp stands by Thomas Chippendale (1753\u201354)\nFile:Pair of side chairs MET DP111238.jpg|Side chair; Thomas Chippendale; circa 1755\u20131760; mahogany; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nFile:Thomas Johnson - Three Designs for Torcheres in the Chinese Taste (Plate 13 of \"One Hundred and Fifty New Designs\") - Google Art Project.jpg|Design for candlesticks in the \"Chinese Taste\" by [[Thomas Johnson (designer)|Thomas Johnson]] (1756)\nFile:Set of fourteen side chairs MET DP110781.jpg|Chippendale chair (1772), Metropolitan Museum\nFile:Brazier MET 202187.jpg|Brazier by silversmith Charles Friedrich Kander (1735), Metropolitan Museum\n</gallery>\n\n==Russia==\nThe Russian Empress [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]] was another admirer of the Rococo; The Golden Cabinet of the Chinese Palace in the palace complex of [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]] near Saint Petersburg, designed by the Italian [[Antonio Rinaldi (architect)|Antonio Rinaldi]], is an example of the Russian Rococo.\n\n==Decline and end==\n{{See also|Neoclassicism|Empire style}}\n\n{{multiple image\n<!-- Essential parameters -->\n| align = \n| total_width = 350\n| direction = horizontal\n| footer = Comparison between an 18th century [[etching]], by [[Jacques de Lajoue]], of a Rococo [[Krater#Calyx krater|calyx krater]]; and a 1st century [[Roman Empire|Roman]] calyx krater which has the exactly same shape like a [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] stone garden vase\n<!-- Image 1 -->\n| image1 = Title Page from Book of Vases MET DP290845.jpg\n| width1 = \n| height1 = \n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n<!-- Image 2 -->\n| image2 = Marble calyx-krater with reliefs of maidens and dancing maenads MET DT4541.jpg\n| width2 = \n| height2 = \n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n}}\n\nThe art of [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher|Boucher]] and other painters of the period, with its emphasis on decorative mythology and gallantry, soon inspired a reaction, and a demand for more \"noble\" themes. While the Rococo continued in Germany and Austria, the French Academy in Rome began to teach the classic style. This was confirmed by the nomination of [[Le Troy]] as director of the Academy in 1738, and then in 1751 by [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]].\n\n[[Madame de Pompadour]], the mistress of Louis XV contributed to the decline of the Rococo style. In 1750 she sent her brother, [[Abel-Fran\u00e7ois Poisson|Abel-Fran\u00e7ois Poisson de Vandi\u00e8res]], on a two-year mission to study artistic and archeological developments in Italy. He was accompanied by several artists, including the engraver [[Charles-Nicolas Cochin]] and the architect [[Soufflot]]. They returned to Paris with a passion for classical art. Vandi\u00e9res became the Marquis of Marigny, and was named director general of the King's Buildings. He turned official French architecture toward the neoclassical. Cochin became an important art critic; he denounced the ''petit style'' of Boucher, and called for a grand style with a new emphasis on antiquity and nobility in the academies of painting and architecture.{{sfn|Cabanne|1988|p. 106}}\n\nThe beginning of the end for Rococo came in the early 1760s as figures like [[Voltaire]] and [[Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Blondel]] began to voice their criticism of the superficiality and degeneracy of the art. Blondel decried the \"ridiculous jumble of shells, dragons, reeds, palm-trees and plants\" in contemporary interiors.<ref>[http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/sammlung6/allg/buch.xml?docname=blondel1737]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref>\n\nBy 1785, Rococo had passed out of fashion in France, replaced by the order and seriousness of Neoclassical artists like [[Jacques-Louis David]]. In Germany, late 18th-century Rococo was ridiculed as ''Zopf und Per\u00fccke'' (\"pigtail and periwig\"), and this phase is sometimes referred to as ''Zopfstil''. Rococo remained popular in certain German provincial states and in Italy, until the second phase of neoclassicism, \"[[Empire style]]\", arrived with Napoleonic governments and swept Rococo away.\n\n==Furniture and decoration==\nThe ornamental style called ''[[rocaille]]'' emerged in France between 1710 and 1750, mostly during the regency and reign of [[Louis XV]]; the style was also called ''[[Louis Quinze]]''. Its principal characteristics were picturesque detail, curves and counter-curves, asymmetry, and a theatrical exuberance. On the walls of new Paris salons, the twisting and winding designs, usually made of gilded or painted stucco, wound around the doorways and mirrors like vines. One of the earliest examples was the [[H\u00f4tel Soubise]] in Paris (1704\u201305), with its famous oval salon decorated with paintings by Boucher, and [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]].{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=102}}\n\nThe best known French furniture designer of the period was [[Juste-Aur\u00e8le Meissonnier]] (1695\u20131750), who was also a sculptor, painter. and goldsmith for the royal household. He held the title of official designer to the Chamber and Cabinet of Louis XV. His work is well known today because of the enormous number of engravings made of his work which popularized the style throughout Europe. He designed works for the royal families of Poland and Portugal.\n\nItaly was another place where the Rococo flourished, both in its early and later phases. Craftsmen in Rome, Milan and Venice all produced lavishly decorated furniture and decorative items.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Juste-aur\u00e8lie messonier, candelabro d'argento, Parigi, 1734-1735 , 02.JPG|Candlelabra by [[Juste-Aur\u00e8le Meissonnier]] (1735\u201340)\nFile:Juste-Aur\u00e8le Meissonnier - \"Chariot of Apollo,\" Ceiling Design for Count Bielinski's Cabinet, Warsaw, Poland - Google Art Project.jpg|''Chariot of Apollo'' design for a ceiling of Count Bielinski by [[Meissonier]], Warsaw, Poland (1734)\nFile:Juste-Aur\u00e8le Meissonnier - Canap\u00e9 execut\u00e9 pour Mr. le Comte de Bielinski Grand M.al de la Couronne de Pologne, en 1735.; Canap\u00e9... - Google Art Project.jpg|Canap\u00e9 designed by Meissonnier for Count Bielinski, Warsaw, Poland (1735)\nFile:Bottega romana, console, 1710 ca., base in legno e piano di marmo.JPG|Console table, Rome, Italy (circa 1710)\n</gallery>\n\nThe sculpted decoration included fleurettes, palmettes, seashells, and foliage, carved in wood. The most extravagant rocaille forms were found in the consoles, tables designed to stand against walls. The Commodes, or chests, which had first appeared under Louis XIV, were richly decorated with rocaille ornament made of gilded bronze. They were made by master craftsmen including [[Jean-Pierre Latz]] and also featured marquetry of different-coloured woods, sometimes placed in checkerboard cubic patterns, made with light and dark woods. The period also saw the arrival of [[Chinoiserie]], often in the form of lacquered and gilded commodes, called ''falcon de Chine'' of ''Vernis Martin'', after the ebenist who introduced the technique to France. [[Ormolu]], or gilded bronze, was used by master craftsmen including [[Jean-Pierre Latz]]. Latz made a particularly ornate clock mounted atop a cartonnier for [[Frederick the Great]] for his palace in [[Potsdam]]. Pieces of [[Chinese export porcelain|imported Chinese porcelain]] were often mounted in [[ormolu]] (gilded bronze) rococo settings for display on tables or consoles in salons. Other craftsmen imitated the [[Japanese lacquer|Japanese art of lacquered furniture]], and produced commodes with Japanese motifs.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=144}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Secretaire - Bernard II van Risamburgh - M\u00fcnchner Residenz - DSC07490.JPG|Desk for the [[M\u00fcnchner Residenz]] by [[Bernard II van Risamburgh]] (1737)\nFile:Kambli Cartonnier with a clock of Frederick II.jpg|Clock-chest for [[Frederick the Great]] (1742)\nFile:Chinese - Bowl Mounted with Two Fish - Walters 492266.jpg|A Chinese porcelain bowl and two fish mounted in gilded bronze, France (1745\u201349)\nFile:LatzEncoignure1a.jpg|An [[encoignure]] by royal cabinetmaker [[Jean-Pierre Latz]] (circa 1750)\nFile:Commode.jpg|Lacquered Commode in Chinoiserie style, by [[Bernard II van Risamburgh]], Victoria and Albert Museum (1750\u20131760)\n</gallery>\n\n[[Great Britain|British]] Rococo tended to be more restrained. Thomas Chippendale's furniture designs kept the curves and feel, but stopped short of the French heights of whimsy. The most successful exponent of British Rococo was probably [[Thomas Johnson (designer)|Thomas Johnson]], a gifted carver and furniture designer working in London in the mid-18th century.\n\n==Painting==\nElements of the ''Rocaille'' style appeared in the work of some French painters, including a taste for the picturesque in details; curves and counter-curves; and dissymmetry which replaced the movement of the baroque with exuberance, though the French ''rocaille'' never reached the extravagance of the Germanic rococo.{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=98}} The leading proponent was [[Antoine Watteau]], particularly in [[Embarkation for Cythera|''Pilgrimage on the Isle of Cythera'']] (1717), [[Louvre Museum|Louvre]], in a genre called ''[[F\u00eate galante|F\u00eate Galante]]'' depicting scenes of young nobles gathered together to celebrate in a pastoral setting. Watteau died in 1721 at the age of thirty-seven, but his work continued to have influence through the rest of the century. The ''Pilgrimage to Cythera'' painting was purchased by [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia in 1752 or 1765 to decorate his palace of [[Charlottenberg]] in Berlin.{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=98}}\n\nThe successor of Watteau and the ''F\u00e9te Galante'' in decorative painting was [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]] (1703\u20131770), the favorite painter of [[Madame de Pompadour]]. His work included the sensual ''Toilette de Venus'' (1746), which became one of the best known examples of the style. Boucher participated in all of the genres of the time, designing tapestries, models for porcelain sculpture, set decorations for the Paris opera and ''opera-comique'', and decor for the Fair of Saint-Laurent. {{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=104}} Other important painters of the ''F\u00eate Galante'' style included [[Nicolas Lancret]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Pater]]. The style particularly influenced [[Fran\u00e7ois Lemoyne]], who painted the lavish decoration of the ceiling of the Salon of Hercules at the [[Palace of Versailles]], completed in 1735.{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=98}} Paintings with f\u00e9tes gallant and mythological themes by Boucher, [[Pierre-Charles Tr\u00e9moli\u00e8res]] and [[Charles-Joseph Natoire]] decorated the famous salon of the [[H\u00f4tel Soubise]] in Paris (1735\u201340).{{Sfn|Cabanne|1988|page=104}} Other Rococo painters include: [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois de Troy]] (1679\u20131752), [[Jean-Baptiste van Loo]] (1685\u20131745), his two sons [[Louis-Michel van Loo]] (1707\u20131771) and [[Charles-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Philippe van Loo]] (1719\u20131795), his younger brother [[Charles-Andr\u00e9 van Loo]] (1705\u20131765), and [[Nicolas Lancret]] (1690\u20131743).\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:L'Embarquement pour Cythere, by Antoine Watteau, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|[[Antoine Watteau]], [[Embarkation for Cythera|''Pilgrimage on the Isle of Cythera'']] (1717)\nFile:D\u00e9jeuner de jambon - Nicolas Lancret - mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9.jpg|\"[[The Ham Dinner|Luncheon with Ham]]\" by [[Nicolas Lancret]] (1735)\nFile:Fran\u00e7ois Lemoyne - L'Apoth\u00e9ose d'Hercule - Google Art Project.jpg|Ceiling of the Salon of Hercules by [[Fran\u00e7ois Lemoyne]] (1735)\nFile:The Toilet of Venus, by Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.jpg|''The Toilet of Venus'' by [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]] (1746) \n</gallery>\n\nIn Austria and Southern Germany, Italian painting had the largest effect on the Rococo style.

It was most commonly found in the interiors of churches, usually closely integrated with painting and the architecture. Religious sculpture followed the Italian baroque style, as exemplified in the theatrical altarpiece of the [[Karlskirche]] in Vienna.\n\nEarly Rococo or [[Rocaille]] sculpture in France sculpture was lighter and offered more movement than the classical style of Louis XIV. It was encouraged in particular by [[Madame de Pompadour]], mistress of Louis XV, who commissioned many works for her chateaux and gardens. The sculptor [[Edm\u00e9 Bouchardon]] represented [[Cupid]] engaged in carving his darts of love from the club of [[Hercules]]. Rococo figures also crowded the later fountains at Versailles, such as the Fountain of Neptune by [[Lambert-Sigisbert Adam]] and [[Nicolas-Sebastien Adam]] (1740). Based on their success at Versailles, they were invited to Prussia by [[Frederick the Great]] to create fountain sculpture for [[Sanssouci]] Palace, Prussia (1740s).<ref>Duby, Georges and Daval, Jean-Luc, ''La Sculpture de l'Antiquit\u00e9 au XXe Si\u00e8cle'', (2013) pp. 789-791</ref>\n\n[[\u00c9tienne-Maurice Falconet]] (1716\u20131791) was another leading French sculptor during the period. Falconet was most famous for his statue of [[Peter the Great]] on horseback in St. Petersburg, but he also created a series of smaller works for wealthy collectors, which could be reproduced in a series in [[terra-cotta]] or cast in bronze. The French sculptors, [[Jean-Louis Lemoyne]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne]], [[Louis-Simon Boizot]], [[Michel Clodion]], [[Lambert-Sigisbert Adam]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Pigalle]] all produced sculpture in series for collectors.<ref>Duby, Georges and Daval, Jean-Luc, ''La Sculpture de l'Antiquit\u00e9 au XXe Si\u00e8cle'', (2013) p. 819</ref>\n\nIn Italy, [[Antonio Corradini]] was among the leading sculptors of the Rococo style. A Venetian, he travelled around Europe, working for [[Peter the Great]] in St. Petersburg, for the imperial courts in Austria and Naples. He preferred sentimental themes and made several skilled works of women with faces covered by veils, one of which is now in the [[Louvre]].<ref>Duby, Georges and Daval, Jean-Luc, ''La Sculpture de l'Antiquit\u00e9 au XXe Si\u00e8cle'', (2013) pp. 781-832</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Wien-Landstra\u00dfe, Oberes Belvedere, Tr\u00e4gerfigur.JPG|Atlantides in the upper [[Belvedere Palace]], Vienna, by [[Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt]] (1721\u201322)\nFile:Kloster Rohr in Nby Detail Hochaltar.JPG|[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]] scene by [[Egid Quirin Asam]] (1722\u201323) former monastery church, [[Rohr in Niederbayern]]\nFile:El Transparente.jpg|''El Transparente'' altar in [[Toledo Cathedral]] by [[Narciso Tom\u00e9]] (1721\u201332)\nFile:Fa\u00e7ana del Palau del Marqu\u00e9s de Dosaig\u00fces.JPG|Portal of the Palace of the Marquis de Dos Aguas, Valencia, Spain (1740-1744)\nFile:Versalles Fuente de Neptuno 02.JPG|Fountain of Neptune and Amphitrite [[Palace of Versailles]], by [[Lambert-Sigisbert Adam]] and [[Nicolas-Sebastien Adam]] (1740)\nFile:8002.Element Luft-2 Nymphen mit erlegtem Reiher(1739)-Lambert Sigisbert Adam-Sanssouci Steffen Heilfort.JPG|Fountain nymphs by [[Lambert Sigisbert Adam]] at [[Sanssouci]] palace, Prussia (1740s)\n</gallery>\n\nThe most elaborate examples of rococo sculpture were found in Spain, Austria and southern Germany, in the decoration of palaces and churches. The sculpture was closely integrated with the architecture; it was impossible to know where one stopped and the other began. In the [[Belvedere Palace]] in Vienna, (1721-1722), the vaulted ceiling of the Hall of the Atlantes is held up on the shoulders of muscular figures designed by [[Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt]]. The portal of the Palace of the Marquis of Dos Aguas in Valencia (1715-1776) was completely drenched in sculpture carved in marble, from designs by Hipolito Rovira Brocandel.<ref>Duby, Georges and Daval, Jean-Luc, ''La Sculpture de l'Antiquit\u00e9 au XXe Si\u00e8cle'', (2013) pp. 782-783</ref>\n\nThe ''El Transparente'' altar, in the major chapel of [[Toledo Cathedral]] is a towering sculpture of polychrome marble and gilded stucco, combined with paintings, statues and symbols.

The number of European factories grew steadily through the century, and some made porcelain that the expanding middle classes could afford. The amount of colourful [[overglaze decoration]] used on them also increased. They were usually modelled by artists who had trained in sculpture. Common subjects included figures from the [[commedia dell'arte]], city street vendors, lovers and figures in fashionable clothes, and pairs of birds.\n\n[[Johann Joachim K\u00e4ndler]] was the most important modeller of [[Meissen porcelain]], the earliest European factory, which remained the most important until about 1760. The Swiss-born German sculptor [[Franz Anton Bustelli]] produced a wide variety of colourful figures for the [[Nymphenburg Porcelain Manufactory]] in Bavaria, which were sold throughout Europe. The French sculptor [[\u00c9tienne-Maurice Falconet]] (1716\u20131791) followed this example. While also making large-scale works, he became director of the [[Sevres Porcelain]] manufactory and produced small-scale works, usually about love and gaiety, for production in series.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:The Music Lesson MET DP-14272-001 (cropped).jpg|''The Music Lesson'', [[Chelsea porcelain]], Metropolitican Museum (c. 1765)\nFile:Karlskirche October 2006 005.jpg|High altar of the [[Karlskirche]] in Vienna (1737)\nFile:Cup and Saucer LACMA 47.35.6a-b (1 of 3).jpg|Cup with saucer; circa 1753; soft-paste porcelain with glaze and enamel; [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]\nFile:Mezzetin, Johann Joachim Kaendler, Meissen Porcelain Factory, c. 1739, hard-paste porcelain - Wadsworth Atheneum - Hartford, CT - DSC05311.jpg|[[Mezzetin]], by [[Johann Joachim Kaendler|Kaendler]], [[Meissen porcelain|Meissen]], c. 1739\nFile:Harlequin and Columbine MET DP169015 (cropped).jpg|''[[Harlequin]] and [[Columbina|Columbine]]'', [[Capodimonte porcelain]], c. 1745\nFile:Bustelli Liebesgruppe Der gest\u00f6rte Schl\u00e4fer BNM.jpg|''Pair of lovers'' group of [[Nymphenburg porcelain]], c. 1760, modelled by [[Franz Anton Bustelli]]\nFile:Bustelli K\u00e4smann BNM.jpg|Figure of a cheese seller by Bustelli, [[Nymphenburg porcelain]] (1755)\n</gallery>\n\n==Music==\nA Rococo period existed in [[music history]], although it is not as well known as the earlier Baroque and later Classical forms. The Rococo music style itself developed out of baroque music both in France, where the new style was referred to as [[Galante music|''style galante'']] (\"gallant\" or \"elegant\" style), and in Germany, where it was referred to as ''empfindsamer Stil'' (\"sensitive style\"). It can be characterized as light, intimate music with extremely elaborate and refined forms of [[ornamentation (music)|ornamentation]]. Exemplars include [[Jean Philippe Rameau]], [[Louis-Claude Daquin]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Couperin]] in France; in Germany, the style's main proponents were [[C. P. E. Bach]] and [[Johann Christian Bach]], two sons of [[J.S. Bach]].\n\nIn the second half of the 18th century, a reaction against the Rococo style occurred, primarily against its perceived overuse of ornamentation and decoration. Led by [[C.P.E. Bach]] (an accomplished Rococo composer in his own right), [[Domenico Scarlatti]], and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], this reaction ushered in the [[Classical period (music)|Classical era]]. By the early 19th century, Catholic opinion had turned against the suitability of the style for ecclesiastical contexts because it was \"in no way conducive to sentiments of devotion\".<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13106a.htm Rococo Style \u2013 Catholic Encyclopedia]. Newadvent.org (1912-02-01). Retrieved on 2014-02-11.</ref>\n\nRussian composer of the Romantic era [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] wrote The [[Variations on a Rococo Theme]], Op. 33, for cello and orchestra in 1877. Although the theme is not Rococo in origin, it is written in Rococo style.\n\n== Fashion ==\n[[File:Sackbackgown.jpg|thumb|Sack-back gown and petticoat, 1775-1780 V&A Museum no. T.180&A-1965]]\n\nRococo fashion was based on extravagance, elegance, refinement and decoration. Women's fashion of the seventeenth-century was contrasted by the fashion of the eighteenth-century, which was ornate and sophisticated, the true style of Rococo.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Fashion: A history from the 18th to the 20th century|last=Fukui, A., & Suoh, T.|first=|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> \nThese fashions spread beyond the royal court into the salons and caf\u00e9s of the ascendant bourgeoisie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://historyofeuropeanfashion.wordpress.com/category/baroquerococo-1650-1800/|title=Posts about Baroque/Rococo 1650-1800 on History of Costume|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The exuberant, playful, elegant style of decoration and design that we now know to be 'Rococo' was then known as ''le style rocaille, le style moderne, le gout.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rococo: The continuing curve, 1730-2008|last=Coffin|first=S.|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>\n\nA style that appeared in the early eighteenth-century was the ''robe volante'',<ref name=\":0\" /> a flowing gown, that became popular towards the end of King Louis XIV's reign. This gown had the features of a bodice with large pleats flowing down the back to the ground over a rounded petticoat. The colour palate was rich, dark fabrics accompanied by elaborate, heavy design features. After the death of Louis XIV the clothing styles began to change. The fashion took a turn to a lighter, more frivolous style, transitioning from the baroque period to the well-known style of Rococo.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and-history/magazine/2016/09-10/daily-life-france-fashion-marie-antoinette/|title=Marie Antoinette's Style Revolution|last=|first=|date=|website=National Geographic|access-date=22 April 2018}}</ref> The later period was known for their pastel colours, more revealing frocks, and the plethora of frills, ruffles, bows, and lace as trims. Shortly after the typical women's Rococo gown was introduced, ''robe \u00e0 la Fran\u00e7oise,''<ref name=\":0\" /> a gown with a tight bodice that had a low cut neckline, usually with a large ribbon bows down the centre front, wide panniers, and was lavishly trimmed in large amounts of lace, ribbon, and flowers.\n\nThe ''Watteau pleats''<ref name=\":0\" /> also became more popular, named after the painter Jean-Antoine Watteau, who painted the details of the gowns down to the stitches of lace and other trimmings with immense accuracy. Later, the ''<nowiki/>'pannier'<nowiki/>'' and ''<nowiki/>'mantua''<nowiki/>' became fashionable around 1718, they were wide hoops under the dress to extend the hips out sideways and they soon became a staple in formal wear. This gave the Rococo period the iconic dress of wide hips combined with the large amount of decoration on the garments. Wide panniers were worn for special occasions, and could reach up to 16 feet (4.8 metres) in diameter,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/18sil/hd_18sil.htm|title=Eighteenth-Century Silhouette and Support|last=Glasscock|first=J.|date=|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=22 April 2018}}</ref> and smaller hoops were worn for the everyday settings. These features originally came from seventeenth-century Spanish fashion, known as ''guardainfante'', initially designed to hide the pregnant stomach, then reimagined later as the pannier.<ref name=\":2\" /> 1745 became the Golden Age of the Rococo with the introduction of a more exotic, oriental culture in France called ''a la turque''.<ref name=\":0\" /> This was made popular by Louis XV's mistress, Madame Pompadour, who commissioned the artist, Charles Andre Van Loo, to paint her as a Turkish sultana.\n\nIn the 1760s, a style of less formal dresses emerged and one of these was the ''polonaise'', with inspiration taken from Poland. It was shorter than the French dress, allowing the underskirt and ankles to be seen, which made it easier to move around in. Another dress that came into fashion was the ''robe a l'anglais'', which included elements inspired by the males' fashion; a short jacket, broad lapels and long sleeves.<ref name=\":1\" /> It also had a snug bodice, a full skirt without panniers but still a little long in the back to form a small train, and often some type of lace kerchief worn around the neck. Another piece was the 'redingote', halfway between a cape and an overcoat.\n\nAccessories were also important to all women during this time, as they added to the opulence and the decor of the body to match their gowns. At any official ceremony ladies were required to cover their hands and arms with gloves if their clothes were sleeveless.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Gallery==\n\n===Architecture===\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Igreja de S\u00e3o Francisco de Assis, Ouro Preto.JPG|[[Church of S\u00e3o Francisco de Assis, Ouro Preto|Church of S\u00e3o Francisco de Assis]] in [[Ouro Preto]], Brazil, 1749\u20131774, by [[Aleijadinho]]\nFile:Fine arts academy - panoramio.jpg|[[Czapski Palace]] in [[Warsaw]], Poland, 1712\u20131721, reflects rococo's fascinations of [[orient]]al architecture\nFile:St. Andriy's Church in Kyiv.jpg|[[St Andrew's Church, Kiev|St. Andrew's Church]] in [[Kiev]], 1744\u20131767, designed by [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli]]\nFile:Dresden-Zwinger-Wallpavillion-gp.jpg|[[Zwinger (Dresden)|Zwinger]] in Dresden\nFile:Esterh\u00e1zy-kast\u00e9ly (4051. sz\u00e1m\u00fa m\u0171eml\u00e9k) 2.jpg|[[Eszterh\u00e1za]] in [[Fert\u0151d]], [[Hungary]], 1720\u20131766, sometimes called the \"''Hungarian Versailles''\"\nFile:150913 Branicki Palace in Bia\u0142ystok - 09.jpg|The Rococo [[Branicki Palace, Bia\u0142ystok|Branicki Palace in Bia\u0142ystok]], sometimes referred to as the \"''Polish Versailles''\"\nTrier Kurfuerstliches Palais BW 1.JPG|Electoral Palace of [[Trier]]\nFile:Convento Santo Domingo - Lima.jpg|[[Basilica of Santo Domingo, Lima|Basilica of Santo Domingo]] in [[Lima]], Peru, completed in 1766, by [[Manuel de Amat y Junyent|Manuel d'Amat i de Junyent]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Engravings===\n<gallery widths=\"220px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:Allegories of astronomy and geography.jpg|Unknown artist.

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore. Ruth enters the vacant hotel room and steals part of the $8 million Marty is supposed to launder. Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago.

Roy pressures Rachel for useful information, including pretending to be a Blue Cat bar customer. Rachel has bathroom sex with a bar pickup and calls him Marty to irritate Roy, who is monitoring her transmitter. To deflect Marty's suspicion from her, Rachel suggests the man from the Blue Cat (Roy) might be a police officer. An infuriated Roy threatens her with a violent end if she does not produce evidence. The Byrdes' planned bribe of a state gaming official ends when Wendy correctly suspects a trap. Wendy tries to provide money to Mason, who angrily refuses.

Roy makes Ruth look like an informant, and Helen asks the Byrdes whether she can be trusted. Marty hesitates before saying yes, then races to the Langmores to warn Ruth. Ruth admits she tried to kill Marty, but says she will not try again because circumstances have changed, so he vouches for her to Helen, but Helen's associates subject Ruth to [[waterboarding]] interrogation. Ruth does not crack, and Helen tells Marty she is impressed with Ruth's willpower. Marty reminds Wendy that she cheated on him, and Charlotte overhears and informs Jonah. Charlotte and Jonah discuss using what is left of their money took to buy a van and run away. Helen tells the Snells to burn their poppies so Roy will not find any evidence, but Darlene resists.

Marty and the Snells disinter several Snell ancestors and use their remains to replace the bones the FBI found, throwing off the test results and enabling Jacob to claim authorities desecrated his family's ancient burial places. Roy interrogates Wilkes, who offers to inform on Marty in exchange for Wendy's protection, but she refuses to leave Marty. Ruth agrees to help her father with his illegal activities, deciding that working with Marty will not produce the long term benefits she hoped for.

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Ricardo''' is an American author, filmmaker, musician, and media philosopher, best known for establishing Boston University<nowiki>'s Digital Video Research Archive and founding the book series ''</nowiki>''International Texts in Critical Media Aesthetics.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/series/international-texts-in-critical-media-aesthetics/?pg=1|title=Bloomsbury - International Texts in Critical Media Aesthetics|last=Bloomsbury.com|publisher=}}</ref> His most recent book is ''The Engagement Aesthetic''. He is well known for his podcasts, \"The Mind of Francisco Ricardo,''\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.spreaker.com/show/the-mind-of-francisco-ricardo|title=The Mind of Francisco Ricardo}}</ref> his involvement in Indie films, his electronic music, and his many publications.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nRicardo was born in 1962 in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. When he was seven, his family moved to [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], and two years later, to [[New York City]]. His father, an architect and professor at the [[University of Havana]], had studied under [[Josef Albers]] during Albers's residency in Havana. His mother had been a gymnast and had founded a \"Health Bauhaus\" based on alternative nutrition in the United States.\n\nRicardo studied at [[Harvard University]], receiving an [[Master of Education|Ed.M.]] Ricardo then transferred during his doctoral work at Harvard and received a PhD in Humanities Computing conferred through the [[University Professors Program]] of [[Boston University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cybertext.hum.jyu.fi/contributors.php|title=CyberText Yearbook|publisher=}}</ref> At Boston University, he worked as a Research Associate and later taught art theory at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]].\n\n== Views ==\nRicardo's scholarly writing has focused on how to critique and understand new media art using methods from Continental philosophy and contemporary art history. In his book ''The Engagement Aesthetic,'' for example, Ricardo argues that interactivity is not a sufficiently comprehensive principle by which to distinguish the contribution of new media art, particularly as many artworks are not interactive. Instead, he applied the term ''engagement'' in numerous separate forms as the operational and aesthetic aim of electronic works. In this manner, he argued, new media can be understood as an extension of contemporary art, rather than as an unrelated break from the artistic directions explored by many conceptual artists in the 1970s.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s Ricardo examined epistemological frameworks for new media studies and knowledge representation. He posed several criteria for new media studies in the article ''Interaction Science: A General Meta-Framework for Digital Representation'' (2001), and joined hypertext and knowledge management (e.g., ''Hypertext and Knowledge Management'', 2001)\n\nRicardo has frequently collaborated with German theorists such as [[Roberto Simanowski]] and J\u00f6rgen Sch\u00e4fer (<nowiki>https://www.uni-siegen.de/phil/germanistik/mitarbeiter/schaefer_joergen/</nowiki>). Ricardo and Sch\u00e4fer have edited books in the International Texts in Critical Media Aesthetics, a series of books of which Ricardo is Founding Editor. These texts treat contemporary and new media art as a related line of creative effort by arguing that aesthetics is now a form of critique of media and that aesthetics and critique have become synonymous terms in new media and contemporary art and literature. At the Rhode Island School of Design, Ricardo wrote about forms of media art, including [[digital art]].\n\nHe left teaching and formed his own documentary film studio, Conceptualist Films in 2014. The subject of his documentary, named ''F for Franco''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fforfranco.com/|title=HOME|website=fforfranco|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> '' examines the process of acting and the effects of Hollywood film and celebrity on coming-of-age identity formation as symbolized through the art and performance works of the actor/artist [[James Franco]]. Franco, who was once Ricardo's student, had a wide body of his own experimental art and film work, which is explored in the film. ''F for Franco'' had its premiere at the Hollywood Film Festival in 2015 and was reviewed by Neon Tommy<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/neon-tommy/film-review-f-for-franco-ac92640b0fa6|title=Film Review: 'F For Franco'|first=Sierra|last=Lai|date=27 September 2015|publisher=}}</ref> and by ''The Hollywood Reporter.''<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/f-franco-film-review-748389 | title='F for Franco': Film Review}}</ref> ''\n\n== Reception ==\nRicardo's approach has been acknowledged as contrary in process to narrative methods used in conventional filmmaking, often driven by his perspective as a scholar. Of\u00a0F for Franco, the phenomenological approach to generating James Franco's subjective experience is an explicitly visual part of the content, suggesting that experiences rather \"facts\" are being recounted. One reviewer found that\u00a0 \"Ricardo\u2019s expertise in art theory and new media is highlighted in the film. The documentary itself is not set up according to conventional methods. It was cited as a challenge to how narratives are presented and that is extremely relevant in the structure of the film, as well as the visual effects the audience digests.\"[5]\u00a0 Calling it \"an astute examination of the driving themes in Franco\u2019s work and a cohesive portrait of the artist,\" The Hollywood Reporter found that \"Ricardo\u2019s excitement about digital-media opportunities for new forms of synthesis is persuasive\"\u00a0[6]. In research work, Ricardo's work has been described as one that \"seeks to facilitate interdisciplinary projects and inquiry that are innovative, imaginative and creatively interactive.\"<ref>LEONARDO Reviews, Vol. 44, No. 1, pp. 77, 2011\n</ref>\n\n== Podcasts==\nRicardo is known for his podcast, \"The Mind of Francisco Ricardo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spreaker.com/show/the-mind-of-francisco-ricardo|title=The Mind of Francisco Ricardo|website=Spreaker|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>\" This podcast covers weekly or bi-weekly topics including film reviews and film theory critiques of popular cinema.\n\n== Metaphysics ==\nRicardo's metaphysics has scrutinized both language and visual art. Following a linguistic direction, Ricardo examined Derrida's views on grammatology, the study of the relationship between written and oral language, in view of writing forms that emerged at the dawn of digital media, such as blogs and emails. Derrida had critiqued the linguistic view that written and oral language were largely independent of each other, with writing being a support for oral communication, as Saussure claimed:  \u201cLanguage and writing are two distinct systems of signs; the second exists for the sole purpose of representing the first.\" (q3, p.&nbsp;30). For Derrida, writing and orality were interrelated differently, and he asserted that \"writing up to the present has not only not contradicted, but indeed confirmed the linguistics of the word.\" (Ibid.). Ricardo's work departs from both Saussure and Derrida by denying that such clean separations exist between these two modalities, and that, instead, something like a codependent blend between orality and literacy had begun to emerge with the rise of globally networked interactive media. Through statistical analysis of lexical density and mean length of utterance (MLU) across blog posts, email messages, printed text (e.g., literary fiction), speech, Ricardo demonstrated that this new hybrid form, which he called \"conversational writing,\" exists between orality and print, by showing high sentence length correlations between blog and email messages (98.5%), between blogs and speech (75.4%), and between emails and speech (70.7%), but significantly lower correlation between email and print (28.4%). Similarly, average lexical density of blogs (9.0%) and emails (10.7%) was located between that of speech (6.0%) and print (17.2%). [q4]\n\nRicardo also examined and argued for the intersection between expressive forms in research and creative work that fuses literary genres and visual art in digital media, a hybridity of expression that he termed \"literary art\" and which had historical foundations in 20th century poetry and visual art, but which had not been seen as a throughline in literary or art history:\n\nIf a name could convey the fusion of literature and art beyond media, it would connect to earlier traditions that harbored the same aesthetic and poetic aspirations. For what might still too imprecisely be called \u201cLiterary Art\u201d in digital media follows significant forays into lettristic exploration that began with Mallarm\u00e9, Marinetti, Picabia, Chagall, and later returned with Broodthaers, Holzer, Kruger, Bochner, Kosuth, Nauman, Horn, and Weiner. This spectrum encompasses and has navigated through whole movements that swept within concrete poetry, Futurism, Dada, Fluxus, conceptual art, and even postart, to use Donald Kuspit\u2019s term. [q5]\n\n== Musical works ==\nRicardo has recorded content for several albums and singles.

The film is filled with personal interviews between the director and James Franco that was recorded over the course of four years. These conversations became the foundation for a journey that takes audiences through years of creative works with footage from Franco\u2019s personal archives unveiling works never-before- seen by the public. The film also includes appearances by poet Frank Bidart, Seth Rogan, and Michael Shannon. He has an upcoming film about Cuban jazz trumpeter, Arturo Sandoval, set for release in late 2019.

He is well known for his podcasts, \"The Mind of Francisco Ricardo,''\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.spreaker.com/show/the-mind-of-francisco-ricardo|title=The Mind of Francisco Ricardo}}</ref> his involvement in Indie films, his electronic music, and his many publications.\n== Early life and education ==\nRicardo was born in 1962 in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. When he was seven, his family moved to [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], and two years later, to [[New York City]]. His father, an architect and professor at the [[University of Havana]], had studied under [[Josef Albers]] during Albers's residency in Havana. His mother had been a gymnast and had founded a \"Health Bauhaus\" based on alternative nutrition in the United States. \n\nRicardo studied at [[Harvard University]], receiving an [[Master of Education|Ed.M.]] Ricardo then transferred during his doctoral work at Harvard and received a PhD in Humanities Computing conferred through the [[University Professors Program]] of [[Boston University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cybertext.hum.jyu.fi/contributors.php|title=CyberText Yearbook|publisher=}}</ref> At Boston University, he worked as a Research Associate and later taught art theory at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]].\n\n== Views ==\nRicardo's scholarly writing has focused on how to critique and understand new media art using methods from Continental philosophy and contemporary art history. In his book ''The Engagement Aesthetic,'' for example, Ricardo argues that interactivity is not a sufficiently comprehensive principle by which to distinguish the contribution of new media art, particularly as many artworks are not interactive. Instead, he applied the term ''engagement'' in numerous separate forms as the operational and aesthetic aim of electronic works. In this manner, he argued, new media can be understood as an extension of contemporary art, rather than as an unrelated break from the artistic directions explored by many conceptual artists in the 1970s.\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s Ricardo examined epistemological frameworks for new media studies and knowledge representation. He posed several criteria for new media studies in the article ''Interaction Science: A General Meta-Framework for Digital Representation'' (2001), and joined hypertext and knowledge management (e.g., ''Hypertext and Knowledge Management'', 2001)\n\nRicardo has frequently collaborated with German theorists such as [[Roberto Simanowski]] and J\u00f6rgen Sch\u00e4fer (<nowiki>https://www.uni-siegen.de/phil/germanistik/mitarbeiter/schaefer_joergen/</nowiki>). Ricardo and Sch\u00e4fer have edited books in the International Texts in Critical Media Aesthetics, a series of books of which Ricardo is Founding Editor. These texts treat contemporary and new media art as a related line of creative effort by arguing that aesthetics is now a form of critique of media and that aesthetics and critique have become synonymous terms in new media and contemporary art and literature. At the Rhode Island School of Design, Ricardo wrote about forms of media art, including [[digital art]]. \n\nHe left teaching and formed his own documentary film studio, Conceptualist Films in 2014. The subject of his documentary, named ''F for Franco''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fforfranco.com/|title=HOME|website=fforfranco|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> '' examines the process of acting and the effects of Hollywood film and celebrity on coming-of-age identity formation as symbolized through the art and performance works of the actor/artist [[James Franco]]. Franco, who was once Ricardo's student, had a wide body of his own experimental art and film work, which is explored in the film. ''F for Franco'' had its premiere at the Hollywood Film Festival in 2015 and was reviewed by Neon Tommy<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/neon-tommy/film-review-f-for-franco-ac92640b0fa6|title=Film Review: 'F For Franco'|first=Sierra|last=Lai|date=27 September 2015|publisher=}}</ref> and by ''The Hollywood Reporter.''<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/f-franco-film-review-748389 | title='F for Franco': Film Review}}</ref> ''\n\n== Reception ==\nRicardo's approach has been acknowledged as contrary in process to narrative methods used in conventional filmmaking, often driven by his perspective as a scholar. Of\u00a0F for Franco, the phenomenological approach to generating James Franco's subjective experience is an explicitly visual part of the content, suggesting that experiences rather \"facts\" are being recounted. One reviewer found that\u00a0 \"Ricardo\u2019s expertise in art theory and new media is highlighted in the film. The documentary itself is not set up according to conventional methods. It was cited as a challenge to how narratives are presented and that is extremely relevant in the structure of the film, as well as the visual effects the audience digests.\"[5]\u00a0 Calling it \"an astute examination of the driving themes in Franco\u2019s work and a cohesive portrait of the artist,\" The Hollywood Reporter found that \"Ricardo\u2019s excitement about digital-media opportunities for new forms of synthesis is persuasive\"\u00a0[6]. In research work, Ricardo's work has been described as one that \"seeks to facilitate interdisciplinary projects and inquiry that are innovative, imaginative and creatively interactive.\"<ref>LEONARDO Reviews, Vol. 44, No. 1, pp. 77, 2011\n</ref>\n\n== Podcasts==\nRicardo is known for his podcast, \"The Mind of Francisco Ricardo<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spreaker.com/show/the-mind-of-francisco-ricardo|title=The Mind of Francisco Ricardo|website=Spreaker|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>.\" This podcast covers weekly or bi-weekly topics including film reviews and film theory critiques of popular cinema. \n== Metaphysics ==\nRicardo's metaphysics has scrutinized both language and visual art. Following a linguistic direction, Ricardo examined Derrida's views on grammatology, the study of the relationship between written and oral language, in view of writing forms that emerged at the dawn of digital media, such as blogs and emails. Derrida had critiqued the linguistic view that written and oral language were largely independent of each other, with writing being a support for oral communication, as Saussure claimed:  \u201cLanguage and writing are two distinct systems of signs; the second exists for the sole purpose of representing the first.\" (q3, p. 30). For Derrida, writing and orality were interrelated differently, and he asserted that \"writing up to the present has not only not contradicted, but indeed confirmed the linguistics of the word.\" (Ibid.). Ricardo's work departs from both Saussure and Derrida by denying that such clean separations exist between these two modalities, and that, instead, something like a codependent blend between orality and literacy had begun to emerge with the rise of globally networked interactive media. Through statistical analysis of lexical density and mean length of utterance (MLU) across blog posts, email messages, printed text (e.g., literary fiction), speech, Ricardo demonstrated that this new hybrid form, which he called \"conversational writing,\" exists between orality and print, by showing high sentence length correlations between blog and email messages (98.5%), between blogs and speech (75.4%), and between emails and speech (70.7%), but significantly lower correlation between email and print (28.4%). Similarly, average lexical density of blogs (9.0%) and emails (10.7%) was located between that of speech (6.0%) and print (17.2%). [q4]\n\nRicardo also examined and argued for the intersection between expressive forms in research and creative work that fuses literary genres and visual art in digital media, a hybridity of expression that he termed \"literary art\" and which had historical foundations in 20th century poetry and visual art, but which had not been seen as a throughline in literary or art history:\n\nIf a name could convey the fusion of literature and art beyond media, it would connect to earlier traditions that harbored the same aesthetic and poetic aspirations. For what might still too imprecisely be called \u201cLiterary Art\u201d in digital media follows significant forays into lettristic exploration that began with Mallarm\u00e9, Marinetti, Picabia, Chagall, and later returned with Broodthaers, Holzer, Kruger, Bochner, Kosuth, Nauman, Horn, and Weiner. This spectrum encompasses and has navigated through whole movements that swept within concrete poetry, Futurism, Dada, Fluxus, conceptual art, and even postart, to use Donald Kuspit\u2019s term. [q5]\n== Musical works ==\nRicardo has recorded content for several albums and singles.

The film is filled with personal interviews between the director and James Franco that was recorded over the course of four years. These conversations became the foundation for a journey that takes audiences through years of creative works with footage from Franco\u2019s personal archives unveiling works never-before- seen by the public. The film also includes appearances by poet Frank Bidart, Seth Rogan, and Michael Shannon. He has an upcoming film about Cuban jazz trumpeter, Arturo Sandoval, set for release in late 2019.
