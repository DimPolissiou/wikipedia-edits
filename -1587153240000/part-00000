'''[[Environmental impact]]s''' affect the [[carrying capacity]] of the area, vegetation, air quality, bodies of water, the [[water table]], wildlife, and natural phenomena. '''Sociocultural impacts''' are associated with interactions between people with differing cultural backgrounds, attitudes and behaviors, and relationships to material goods.<ref name=\"Mason\" />  The introduction of tourists to sensitive areas can be detrimental, cause a loss of culture, or, alternatively, contribute to the preservation of culture and cultural sites through increased resources. '''[[Economic impact]]s''' are usually seen as positive, contributing to employment, better services, and social stability. Cultural education may also be improved, which can be overlooked.<ref name=\"Rollins et al 2016\">Rollins, R., Dearden P. and Fennell, D. (2016) \"Tourism, Ecotourism and Protected Areas\". In P. Dearden, R. Rollins and M.

Peoples' desire for more authentic and challenging experiences results in their destinations becoming more remote, to the few remaining pristine and natural environments left on the planet. The positive impact of this can be an increased [[environmental awareness|awareness]] of environmental stewardship.<ref>Moghimehfar, F., & Halpenny, E. A. (2016). \"How do people negotiate through their constraints to engage in pro-environmental behavior? A study of front-country campers in Alberta, Canada\". ''Tourism Management'', 57, 362\u2013372.</ref> The negative impact can be a destruction of the very experience that people are seeking. There are direct and indirect impacts, immediate and long-term impacts, and there are impacts that are both proximal and distal to the tourist destination. These impacts can be separated into three categories: facility impacts, tourist activities, and the transit effect.\n\n=== Facility impacts ===\nFacility impacts occur when a regional area evolves from \"exploration\" to \"involvement\" and then into the \"development\" stage of the tourist area life cycle.<ref>Butler, R. W. (1980). \"The concept of a tourist area cycle of evolution: implications for management of resources\". ''The Canadian Geographer/Le G\u00e9ographe canadien'', 24(1), 5\u201312.</ref> During the latter phase there can be both direct and indirect environmental impacts through the construction of [[superstructure]] such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, and infrastructure such as roads and power supply. As the destination develops, more tourists seek out the experience. Their impacts increase accordingly. The requirement for water for washing, [[waste disposal]], and drinking increases. Rivers can be altered, excessively extracted, and polluted by the demands of tourists. [[Noise pollution]] has the capacity to disturb wildlife and alter behavior, and [[light pollution]] can disrupt the feeding and [[reproductive behaviour]] of many creatures. When power is supplied by diesel or gasoline generators there is additional noise and pollution. General [[waste]] and garbage are also a result of the facilities. As more tourists arrive there is an increase in food and beverages consumed, which in turn creates [[waste plastic]] and [[non-biodegradable]] products.\n\n=== Tourist activities ===\n[[File:Turtle riding, Great Barrier Reef (7687773596).jpg|right|thumb|Turtle riding was a popular tourist activity in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anmm.wordpress.com/2013/08/10/the-sport-of-turtle-riding-and-the-greatest-liar-on-earth/|title=The sport of turtle riding  'the Greatest Liar on Earth'|work=[[Australian National Maritime Museum]]|date=10 August 2013}}</ref>]]\nPractically all tourist activities have an ecological impact on the host destination. In rural destinations activities, such as [[hiking]] the local ecology.\n\nThere are a range of impacts from hiking, trekking, and [[camping]] that directly affect the activity area. The most obvious is the erosion and compaction of [[trail]]<nowiki/>s through daily use. With the presence of obstacles such as fallen trees or puddles, trails becomes widened or informal trails are created to bypass the obstacle.<ref>Marion, J.L. (1998). \"Recreation Ecology Research Findings: Implications for Wilderness and Park Managers\". ''Proceedings of the National Outdoor Ethics Conference'', 18\u201321 April 1996, St. Louis, MO. Gaithersburg, MD: Izaak Walton League of America. pp. 188\u2013196.</ref> Other direct impacts include damage or removal of vegetation, loss of vegetation height, reduction in foliage cover, exposure of tree root systems, migration of trampled vegetation, and introduction of [[non-native species]].<ref>Marion, J. L., & Leung, Y. F. (2001). \"Trail Resource Impacts and an Examination of Alternative Assessment Techniques\". ''Journal of Park and Recreation Administration'', 19(3), 17\u201337.</ref> Indirect impacts on trails include changes in [[soil porosity]], changes to [[Microbiota|microflora]] composition, problems with seed dispersion and germination, and degradation of soil nutrient composition.<ref>Hammitt, W. E., Cole, D. N., & Monz, C. A. (2015). ''Wildland Recreation: Ecology and Management''. John Wiley & Sons.</ref> \n\nAs many hikers and trekkers take multi-day trips, a large number will camp overnight either in formal or random [[Campsite|campsites]]. There are similar impacts on campsites, such as soil compaction, erosion and composition, loss of vegetation and foliage, and the additional issues regarding [[campfires]]. Informal trails are created around the campsite in order to collect firewood and water, and trees and saplings can be trampled, damaged, or cut-down for fuel. The heat of campfires may damage tree-root systems.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Marion, J. L., & Cole, D. N.|year=1996|title=Spatial and temporal variation in soil and vegetation impacts on campsites|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=6|issue=2|pages=520\u2013530|doi=10.2307/2269388 |jstor=2269388|hdl=10919/46861|hdl-access=free}}</ref> In formal campgrounds, tent pad areas are normally devoid of vegetation, while random camping can damage sensitive plants and grasses during a single overnight stay.\n\nAs with most recreational activities, hiking and camping generate waste, including food scraps and human waste. Habituation of wildlife to human contact and to unusual food sources can have a detrimental effect on the wildlife and pose dangers for humans. Provision for deposit, collection, and removal of waste will also have a direct impact on the local environment.\n\nTourism can act as a vector in the spread of non-native species. With tourism comes an increase and concentration of human activity in specific localized regions of the landscape especially protected wildernesses and parks. Because of the increase in human visitation from many different geographical regions, non-native species are observed at a higher propagation rate in these areas. Typical recreation activities such as hiking, biking, and off-road driving can act as habitat disturbances which may increase the spread of aggressive invasive species, harming the natural ecosystem. Nature-based tourism (i.e., wildlife viewing and outdoor recreation) are thought to be increasing and often happen in more pristine habitats. With the disturbance from human activities, open niches may become available giving opportunity for aggressive non-native species to become established and take advantage of new resource availability. This can have dire consequences on local flora and fauna as invasives tend to be particularly successful in colonizing disturbed areas where the local biotic communities have been affected and potentially harmed.\n\nExamples of invasive species spread by tourism:\n* Bigheaded ant (Pheidole megacephala): Is one of the worst invasives and classified under the \u201cworld's 100 worst\u201d invasive species. Originally found in the Galapagos Islands in 2007 within ship cargo for tourist supplies. Ants can be spread with the movement of people from one island to another. \n* Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum): Spread fast, don\u2019t allow native species to grow, can cause forest fires to spread rapidly. Can be carried by people through shoes and gear; pets and other animals can spread the seeds through their travel as well. \n* Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha): These are believed to have come from the Caspian Sea in Europe in a ship's ballast water. They are spread by uncleansed boats from one body of water to another as tourists move to different locations.\n\nThere are ways to decrease the spread of non-native species such as taking care in removing seeds from shoes and pants after hiking or biking. Thoroughly cleaning boats when moving from one body of water to another and creating designated pathway management plans are other ways in which one can decrease the impacts of invasive species on local habitats.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schaeffer |first1=S.

This happens in a range of formats, on land and in the ocean. Wildlife safaris in African countries such as [[Kenya]], [[Botswana]], and [[Tanzania]] have been popular for many years. Their focus are the [[big five game]] megafauna: the [[African lion]], [[African elephant]], [[African leopard]], [[cape buffalo]], and [[rhinoceros]]. As with every human-wildlife interaction, there is a change in the natural interaction of the species. The mere presence of humans can increase the heart rate and [[stress hormones]] of even the largest animal.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2193/2006-015 |title=Stress Response of Working African Elephants to Transportation and Safari Adventures |journal=Journal of Wildlife Management |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=1257\u20131260 |year=2007 |last1=Millspaugh |first1=Joshua J. |last2=Burke |first2=Tarryne |last3=Van Dyk |first3=GUS |last4=Slotow |first4=ROB |last5=Washburn |first5=Brian E. |last6=Woods |first6=Rami J. |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1721&context=icwdm_usdanwrc }}</ref> Other changes in behavior have been recognized. For example, [[baboons]] and [[hyenas]] have learnt to track tourist [[safari]] vehicles to lead them to [[cheetah]] kills, which they then steal.<ref>Roe, D., Leader-Williams, N., & Dalal-Clayton, D. B. (1997). \"Take only photographs, leave only footprints: the environmental impacts of wildlife tourism\", (No. 10). Iied.</ref> This direct impact of can severely damage the delicate balance of the [[food webs]] and [[keystone species]].\n\nThere is a small but significant number of tourists who pay considerable sums of money in order to [[Trophy hunting|trophy hunt]] lions, [[rhino]], [[leopard]]s, and even [[giraffes]]. It has been argued that there is a positive and negative, direct and indirect, environmental impact caused by [[trophy hunting]]. There is a continued discussion at federal and international government level as to the ethics of funding conservation efforts through hunting activities.<ref>Ripple, W. J., Newsome, T. M., & Kerley, G. I. (2016). \"Does Trophy Hunting Support Biodiversity? A Response to Di Minin, et al.\". ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution''.</ref>\n\nAnother tourism destination activity is [[scuba diving]]. There are many negative direct environmental impacts caused by [[recreational diving]]. The most apparent is the damage caused by poorly skilled divers standing on the reef itself or by accidentally hitting the fragile coral with their fins. Studies have shown that \"na\u00efve\" divers who engage in [[underwater photography]] are considerably more likely to accidentally damage the reef.<ref>Sorice, M. G., Oh, C. O., & Ditton, R. B.

(1994). \"The growth of coastal tourism in the Red Sea: present and future effects on coral reefs\".

There are also indirect impacts such as shoreline construction of superstructure and infrastructure.\n\n=== Transit effects ===\n{{see|Environmental impact of transport}}\nSince 2009 there has been a steady yearly increase in the number of tourist arrivals worldwide of approximately 4.4 percent.

[[Anthropogenic climate change]] has both a direct and indirect impact on tourism.\n\n== Sociocultural impacts of tourism ==\nAn inherent aspect of tourism is the seeking of [https://www.andamanbliss.com/ authenticity], the desire to experience a different cultural setting in its natural environment.<ref name=\"Manzar Bashir\">([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi8EVNFYBWJndysMb9QdzEQ/cabebooks/FullTextPDF/2013/20133092981.pdf Fernandes])</ref><ref name=\"Manzar Bashir2\">(Fagence, http://https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi8EVNFYBWJndysMb9QdzEQ/FullTextPDF/2003/20033017728.pdf){{|date=April 2020}}</ref> Although cultural tourism provides opportunities for understanding and education, there are serious impacts that arise as a result. It is not only the volume of tourism at work, but the types of [[social interaction]]s that occur between tourist and host. There are three broad effects at the local level: the commodification of culture, the demonstration effect, and the acculturation of another culture.\n\n===Commodification of culture===\n[[Commodification]] of culture refers to the use of a cultural traditions and artifacts in order to sell and profit for the local economy. With the rise of tourism, authors argue that commodification is inevitable.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Shepard|first=Robert|date=August 2002|title=Commodification, culture and tourism|journal=Tourist Studies}}</ref> There are both positive and negative sociocultural impacts of commodification on a culture. One positive is the creation of business and jobs for local craftsmen, who are able to sell their goods to tourists. [[Rural tourism]] is seen as a \"cure\" for poverty and leads to the improvement of transportation and development of telecommunications in an area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh4RcWlsMZ0.htm|title=Ulfat ki ksi dahleez per, west regions|website=english.gov.cn|access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref> For the tourist, commodification creates an interest for traditional arts and social practices.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, critics of commodification believe that tourists are not interested in cultural beliefs and traditions of the locals, but are rather obsessed with owning a part of it. The argument that by monetizing cultural artifacts locals lose the value to their culture also exists. It then leads to the belief that tours are no longer authentic experiences. However, development economists will argue that culture can be utilized just as any other natural resource.\n\nResearchers look at the impact of tourists on a culture and in short, many argue that the contact with the secular West leads to the destruction of pre-tourist cultures.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition, the \"development cure\", the idea that increasing tourism will spur economic change while strengthening local culture, is claimed to lead to new diseases, such as \"[[Addiction|drug addiction]], crime, pollution, prostitution, and a decline in social stability\" as well as growth of capitalist values and a [[Consumer Culture]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Demonstration effect===\nThe [[demonstration effect]] was introduced to tourism when researchers were looking into the effects of social influences from tourism on local communities. The demonstration effect argues that local inhabitants copy the behavioral patterns of tourists.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=David|title=The Demonstration Effect Revisited|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=31|issue=2|pages=428\u2013446|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2004.01.001|year=2004}}</ref> There are a number of social, economic and [[behavior]]al reasons as to why the demonstration effect comes into play. One economic and social reason is that locals copy the consumption patterns of those higher up the social scale in order to improve their [[social status]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Tourism has also been accused of affecting social behavior of the younger members of a host community, who may imitate what tourists do, impacting traditional value systems.\n\n==== Criticisms of the demonstration effect ====\nThere are many criticisms of the demonstration effect in tourism. Firstly, tourism is seen as only one aspect of change in society. Local people also see examples of foreign lifestyles and consumption in [[Advertising|advertisements]], magazines, television, and films, and therefore tourism is not the only influence on local culture.<ref name=\":1\" /> In addition, the demonstration effect implies that a culture is \"weak\" and needs to be protected by outside influences. In many cases, the demonstrative effect is seen as a negative consequence, but it is argued that \"all cultures are in a continual process of change\", therefore tourism should not be considered destructive.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Community participation ===\n[[Public participation|Community participation]] refers to the collaboration between community members for the purposes of achieving common goals, improving their local community and pursuing individual benefits.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Jaafar|first=Mastura|last2=Rasoolimanesh|first2=S Mostafa|last3=Ismail|first3=Safura|title=Perceived sociocultural impacts of tourism and community participation: A case study of Langkawi Island|journal=Tourism and Hospitality Research|volume=17|issue=2|pages=123\u2013134|doi=10.1177/1467358415610373|year=2017}}</ref> Local community members are actively involved in tourism, rather than passively benefiting from it. Community participation strengthens communities and help to create a sense of belonging, trust and credibility among members.<ref name=\":2\" /> By involving local community members, tourism can become more authentic. The community and the tourists both benefit from community participation, as it boosts their respect for the traditional lifestyle and values of the destination community. Most destination community members are also the ones most impacted by tourism, therefore there is an importance in their involvement in tourism planning. Some researchers will argue that some of the negative impacts of tourism might be avoided and the positive impacts maximized through community participation in the planning process.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Acculturation===\n[[Acculturation]] is the process of modifying an existing culture through borrowing from the more dominant of cultures. Typically in tourism, the community being acculturated is the destination community, which then experiences dramatic shifts in social structure and world view. Societies adapt to acculturation in one of two ways. Innovation diffusion is when the community adopts practices that are developed by another group; whereas cultural adaptation is less adoption of a new culture and more the process of changing when the existing culture is changed.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web |last=KASTAMU|first=MATATIZO PETER|title=Tourism as Acculturation Process and a Modern Leisure Activity|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh4RcWlsMZ0/14883309}}</ref> Acculturation is often seen as a method of modernizing a community and there are many opposing views to the concept of modernization. One argument against modernization is that it contributes to the \"homogenization of cultural differences and the decline of traditional societies\".<ref name=\":3\" /> This means that communities will advertise their modernity to attract tourists, and will disregard their traditional customs and values. On the other hand, others argue that acculturation and modernization will help traditional communities adjust in a modern world. The idea being that teaching people to adapt will save the community from future extinction.\n\n=== Positive socio-cultural impacts===\n\nThere are number of benefits for the host community as a result of tourism. This includes economic benefits such as opportunities for local businesses which allows for increased trade among the increased number of visitors and then develops a variety of local businesses. In addition, tourism also brings employment opportunities, enhances the economy of the region, and creates revenue for the local government. Tourists also use [[public service]]s, creating funding for public services, such as health, the police and the fire department, as well as increasing the demand for public transport. Other public facilities, such as parks and benches are also well kept by the community for the tourists, improving the overall [[aesthetics]] of the host community. On a more social level, tourism leads to intercultural interaction. Tourists often engage and learn from the locals. Tourism can also increase pride in locals. They want to show off their community that tourists have chosen to visit. The increase in people also leads to creating more social venues and experiences where locals and tourists can interact in. Entertainment and [[recreation]]al facilities will allow for more opportunity to socialize and engage with each other.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Deery|first=Margaret|last2=Jago|first2=Leo|last3=Fredline|first3=Liz|title=Rethinking social impacts of tourism research: A new research agenda|journal=Tourism Management|volume=33|issue=1|pages=64\u201373|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2011.01.026|year=2012}}</ref> Tourism can be beneficial for the host community as it provides the financial means and the incentive to preserve cultural histories, [[local heritage]] sites, and customs. It stimulates interest in local crafts, traditional activities, songs, dance, and [[oral histories]]. It also opens up the community to the wider world, new ideas, new experiences, and new ways of thinking.<ref name=\"Ryan\">Ryan, C. (2003).

(1999). \"Techniques for socially [[sustainable tourism]] development: lessons from Mexico\". ''Department of Geography Publication Series'', University of Waterloo, 52, 193\u2013212.</ref> In terms of economic disadvantages, local communities need to be able to fund the tourist demands, which leads to an increase of taxes. The overall price of living increases in tourist destinations in terms of rent and rates, as well as property values going up. This can be problematic for locals looking to buy property or others on a fixed income.<ref name=\":4\" /> In addition, to balance out tourist destinations, the number of locals to tourists must be relatively equal. This can be more problematic for tourists as their access could be denied. Other negative sociocultural impacts are differences in social and moral values among the local host community and the visiting tourist. Outside of affecting the relationship between tourist and local, it can also cause friction between groups of the local population. In addition, it can cause drifts in the dynamics between the old and new generations. Tourism has also correlated to the rise of delinquent behaviors in local host communities. Crime rates have been seen to rise with the increase of tourists. Crimes are typically those of rowdy behavior, alcohol and illegal [[drug user|drug use]], and loud noise. In addition, gambling and prostitution is increased due to tourists looking for a \"good time\".<ref name=\":4\" /> Tourism has also caused more disruption in host communities. Crowding of locals and tourists may create a vibrant ambiance, it also causes frustration and leads to the withdrawal of local residents in many places.

This investment may not explicitly be related to tourism, but benefits the tourist and local [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] all the same.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> Indirect impacts of tourism are exemplified by the purchase and sale of intermediary items like additional supplies for restaurants during the high tourism season, or widened sidewalks in busy downtown centres.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /> Indirect economic impacts (the supply chain, investment, and government collective) account for 50.7 percent of the total GDP contribution from travel and tourism in 2014.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\nInduced spending, the re-circulation of a tourist dollar within a community, is another way that tourism indirectly has an impact on a community.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\">Rollins, R., Dearden, P. and Fennell, D.

Tourism provides the economic stimulus to allow for diversification of employment and income potential, and develop resources within the community. Improvements in infrastructure and services can benefit both the locals and the tourists.<ref name=\"Fernandes\">([http://www.cabi.org/cabebooks/FullTextPDF/2013/20133092981.pdf Fernandes]) {{dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Fagence\" /><ref name=\"Mason\"/> Whereas, [[heritage tourism]] focuses on local history or historical events that occurred in the area, and tends to promote education.<ref>Pigram, J.

Routledge, London, 156\u2013174.</ref> Positive impacts begin when there is an increase in job opportunities for locals as the tourism industry becomes more developed. There is also an increase in average income that spreads throughout the community when tourism is capitalized on.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> In addition, the local economy is stimulated and diversified, goods are manufactured more locally, and new markets open for local business owners to expand to.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> Unfortunately, these benefits are not universal nor invulnerable.

Tourist destinations seem to discover that many of the negative impacts are found in the development stage of the tourism area life cycle (TALC).<ref name=\"Nelson\" />\n\nAdditionally, the economics of tourism have been shown to push out local tourism business owners in favour of strangers to the region.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Mason\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/> Foreign ownership creates leakage (revenues leaving the host community for another nation or multinational business) which strips away the opportunity for locals to make meaningful profits.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\">Tyrrell, T.

'''[[Environmental impact]]s''' affect the [[carrying capacity]] of the area, vegetation, air quality, bodies of water, the [[water table]], wildlife, and natural phenomena. '''Sociocultural impacts''' are associated with interactions between people with differing cultural backgrounds, attitudes and behaviors, and relationships to material goods.<ref name=\"Mason\" />  The introduction of tourists to sensitive areas can be detrimental, cause a loss of culture, or, alternatively, contribute to the preservation of culture and cultural sites through increased resources.

Peoples' desire for more authentic and challenging experiences results in their destinations becoming more remote, to the few remaining pristine and natural environments left on the planet. The positive impact of this can be an increased [[environmental awareness|awareness]] of environmental stewardship.<ref>Moghimehfar, F., & Halpenny, E. A. (2016). \"How do people negotiate through their constraints to engage in pro-environmental behavior? A study of front-country campers in Alberta, Canada\". ''Tourism Management'', 57, 362\u2013372.</ref> The negative impact can be a destruction of the very experience that people are seeking. There are direct and indirect impacts, immediate and long-term impacts, and there are impacts that are both proximal and distal to the tourist destination. These impacts can be separated into three categories: facility impacts, tourist activities, and the transit effect.\n\n=== Facility impacts ===\nFacility impacts occur when a regional area evolves from \"exploration\" to \"involvement\" and then into the \"development\" stage of the tourist area life cycle.<ref>Butler, R. W. (1980). \"The concept of a tourist area cycle of evolution: implications for management of resources\". ''The Canadian Geographer/Le G\u00e9ographe canadien'', 24(1), 5\u201312.</ref> During the latter phase there can be both direct and indirect environmental impacts through the construction of [[superstructure]] such as hotels, restaurants, and shops, and infrastructure such as roads and power supply. As the destination develops, more tourists seek out the experience. Their impacts increase accordingly. The requirement for water for washing, [[waste disposal]], and drinking increases. Rivers can be altered, excessively extracted, and polluted by the demands of tourists. [[Noise pollution]] has the capacity to disturb wildlife and alter behavior, and [[light pollution]] can disrupt the feeding and [[reproductive behaviour]] of many creatures. When power is supplied by diesel or gasoline generators there is additional noise and pollution. General [[waste]] and garbage are also a result of the facilities. As more tourists arrive there is an increase in food and beverages consumed, which in turn creates [[waste plastic]] and [[non-biodegradable]] products.\n\n=== Tourist activities ===\n[[File:Turtle riding, Great Barrier Reef (7687773596).jpg|right|thumb|Turtle riding was a popular tourist activity in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anmm.wordpress.com/2013/08/10/the-sport-of-turtle-riding-and-the-greatest-liar-on-earth/|title=The sport of turtle riding  'the Greatest Liar on Earth'|work=[[Australian National Maritime Museum]]|date=10 August 2013}}</ref>]]\nPractically all tourist activities have an ecological impact on the host destination. In rural destinations activities, such as [[hiking]] the local ecology.\n\nThere are a range of impacts from hiking, trekking, and [[camping]] that directly affect the activity area. The most obvious is the erosion and compaction of [[trail]]<nowiki/>s through daily use. With the presence of obstacles such as fallen trees or puddles, trails becomes widened or informal trails are created to bypass the obstacle.<ref>Marion, J.L. (1998). \"Recreation Ecology Research Findings: Implications for Wilderness and Park Managers\". ''Proceedings of the National Outdoor Ethics Conference'', 18\u201321 April 1996, St. Louis, MO. Gaithersburg, MD: Izaak Walton League of America. pp. 188\u2013196.</ref> Other direct impacts include damage or removal of vegetation, loss of vegetation height, reduction in foliage cover, exposure of tree root systems, migration of trampled vegetation, and introduction of [[non-native species]].<ref>Marion, J. L., & Leung, Y. F. (2001). \"Trail Resource Impacts and an Examination of Alternative Assessment Techniques\". ''Journal of Park and Recreation Administration'', 19(3), 17\u201337.</ref> Indirect impacts on trails include changes in [[soil porosity]], changes to [[Microbiota|microflora]] composition, problems with seed dispersion and germination, and degradation of soil nutrient composition.<ref>Hammitt, W. E., Cole, D. N., & Monz, C. A. (2015). ''Wildland Recreation: Ecology and Management''. John Wiley & Sons.</ref> \n\nAs many hikers and trekkers take multi-day trips, a large number will camp overnight either in formal or random [[Campsite|campsites]]. There are similar impacts on campsites, such as soil compaction, erosion and composition, loss of vegetation and foliage, and the additional issues regarding [[campfires]]. Informal trails are created around the campsite in order to collect firewood and water, and trees and saplings can be trampled, damaged, or cut-down for fuel. The heat of campfires may damage tree-root systems.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Marion, J. L., & Cole, D. N.|year=1996|title=Spatial and temporal variation in soil and vegetation impacts on campsites|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=6|issue=2|pages=520\u2013530|doi=10.2307/2269388 |jstor=2269388|hdl=10919/46861|hdl-access=free}}</ref> In formal campgrounds, tent pad areas are normally devoid of vegetation, while random camping can damage sensitive plants and grasses during a single overnight stay.\n\nAs with most recreational activities, hiking and camping generate waste, including food scraps and human waste. Habituation of wildlife to human contact and to unusual food sources can have a detrimental effect on the wildlife and pose dangers for humans. Provision for deposit, collection, and removal of waste will also have a direct impact on the local environment.\n\nTourism can act as a vector in the spread of non-native species. With tourism comes an increase and concentration of human activity in specific localized regions of the landscape especially protected wildernesses and parks. Because of the increase in human visitation from many different geographical regions, non-native species are observed at a higher propagation rate in these areas. Typical recreation activities such as hiking, biking, and off-road driving can act as habitat disturbances which may increase the spread of aggressive invasive species, harming the natural ecosystem. Nature-based tourism (i.e., wildlife viewing and outdoor recreation) are thought to be increasing and often happen in more pristine habitats. With the disturbance from human activities, open niches may become available giving opportunity for aggressive non-native species to become established and take advantage of new resource availability. This can have dire consequences on local flora and fauna as invasives tend to be particularly successful in colonizing disturbed areas where the local biotic communities have been affected and potentially harmed.\n\nExamples of invasive species spread by tourism:\n* Bigheaded ant (Pheidole megacephala): Is one of the worst invasives and classified under the \u201cworld's 100 worst\u201d invasive species. Originally found in the Galapagos Islands in 2007 within ship cargo for tourist supplies. Ants can be spread with the movement of people from one island to another. \n* Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum): Spread fast, don\u2019t allow native species to grow, can cause forest fires to spread rapidly. Can be carried by people through shoes and gear; pets and other animals can spread the seeds through their travel as well. \n* Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha): These are believed to have come from the Caspian Sea in Europe in a ship's ballast water. They are spread by uncleansed boats from one body of water to another as tourists move to different locations.\n\nThere are ways to decrease the spread of non-native species such as taking care in removing seeds from shoes and pants after hiking or biking. Thoroughly cleaning boats when moving from one body of water to another and creating designated pathway management plans are other ways in which one can decrease the impacts of invasive species on local habitats.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schaeffer |first1=S.

This happens in a range of formats, on land and in the ocean. Wildlife safaris in African countries such as [[Kenya]], [[Botswana]], and [[Tanzania]] have been popular for many years. Their focus are the [[big five game]] megafauna: the [[African lion]], [[African elephant]], [[African leopard]], [[cape buffalo]], and [[rhinoceros]]. As with every human-wildlife interaction, there is a change in the natural interaction of the species. The mere presence of humans can increase the heart rate and [[stress hormones]] of even the largest animal.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.2193/2006-015 |title=Stress Response of Working African Elephants to Transportation and Safari Adventures |journal=Journal of Wildlife Management |volume=71 |issue=4 |pages=1257\u20131260 |year=2007 |last1=Millspaugh |first1=Joshua J. |last2=Burke |first2=Tarryne |last3=Van Dyk |first3=GUS |last4=Slotow |first4=ROB |last5=Washburn |first5=Brian E. |last6=Woods |first6=Rami J. |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1721&context=icwdm_usdanwrc }}</ref> Other changes in behavior have been recognized. For example, [[baboons]] and [[hyenas]] have learnt to track tourist [[safari]] vehicles to lead them to [[cheetah]] kills, which they then steal.<ref>Roe, D., Leader-Williams, N., & Dalal-Clayton, D. B. (1997). \"Take only photographs, leave only footprints: the environmental impacts of wildlife tourism\", (No. 10). Iied.</ref> This direct impact of can severely damage the delicate balance of the [[food webs]] and [[keystone species]].\n\nThere is a small but significant number of tourists who pay considerable sums of money in order to [[Trophy hunting|trophy hunt]] lions, [[rhino]], [[leopard]]s, and even [[giraffes]]. It has been argued that there is a positive and negative, direct and indirect, environmental impact caused by [[trophy hunting]]. There is a continued discussion at federal and international government level as to the ethics of funding conservation efforts through hunting activities.<ref>Ripple, W. J., Newsome, T. M., & Kerley, G. I. (2016). \"Does Trophy Hunting Support Biodiversity? A Response to Di Minin, et al.\". ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution''.</ref>\n\nAnother tourism destination activity is [[scuba diving]]. There are many negative direct environmental impacts caused by [[recreational diving]]. The most apparent is the damage caused by poorly skilled divers standing on the reef itself or by accidentally hitting the fragile coral with their fins. Studies have shown that \"na\u00efve\" divers who engage in [[underwater photography]] are considerably more likely to accidentally damage the reef.<ref>Sorice, M. G., Oh, C. O., & Ditton, R. B.

[[Anthropogenic climate change]] has both a direct and indirect impact on tourism.\n\n== Sociocultural impacts of tourism ==\nAn inherent aspect of tourism is the seeking of [https://www.andamanbliss.com/ authenticity], the desire to experience a different cultural setting in its natural environment.<ref name=\"Manzar Bashir\">([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi8EVNFYBWJndysMb9QdzEQ/cabebooks/FullTextPDF/2013/20133092981.pdf Fernandes])</ref><ref name=\"Manzar Bashir2\">(Fagence, http://https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi8EVNFYBWJndysMb9QdzEQ/FullTextPDF/2003/20033017728.pdf){{|date=April 2020}}</ref> Although cultural tourism provides opportunities for understanding and education, there are serious impacts that arise as a result. It is not only the volume of tourism at work, but the types of [[social interaction]]s that occur between tourist and host. There are three broad effects at the local level: the commodification of culture, the demonstration effect, and the acculturation of another culture.\n\n===Commodification of culture===\n[[Commodification]] of culture refers to the use of a cultural traditions and artifacts in order to sell and profit for the local economy. With the rise of tourism, authors argue that commodification is inevitable.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Shepard|first=Robert|date=August 2002|title=Commodification, culture and tourism|journal=Tourist Studies}}</ref> There are both positive and negative sociocultural impacts of commodification on a culture. One positive is the creation of business and jobs for local craftsmen, who are able to sell their goods to tourists. [[Rural tourism]] is seen as a \"cure\" for poverty and leads to the improvement of transportation and development of telecommunications in an area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh4RcWlsMZ0.htm|title=Ulfat ki ksi dahleez per, west regions|website=english.gov.cn|access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref> For the tourist, commodification creates an interest for traditional arts and social practices.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, critics of commodification believe that tourists are not interested in cultural beliefs and traditions of the locals, but are rather obsessed with owning a part of it. The argument that by monetizing cultural artifacts locals lose the value to their culture also exists. It then leads to the belief that tours are no longer authentic experiences. However, development economists will argue that culture can be utilized just as any other natural resource.\n\nResearchers look at the impact of tourists on a culture and in short, many argue that the contact with the secular West leads to the destruction of pre-tourist cultures.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition, the \"development cure\", the idea that increasing tourism will spur economic change while strengthening local culture, is claimed to lead to new diseases, such as \"[[Addiction|drug addiction]], crime, pollution, prostitution, and a decline in social stability\" as well as growth of capitalist values and a [[Consumer Culture]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Demonstration effect===\nThe [[demonstration effect]] was introduced to tourism when researchers were looking into the effects of social influences from tourism on local communities. The demonstration effect argues that local inhabitants copy the behavioral patterns of tourists.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=David|title=The Demonstration Effect Revisited|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|volume=31|issue=2|pages=428\u2013446|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2004.01.001|year=2004}}</ref> There are a number of social, economic and [[behavior]]al reasons as to why the demonstration effect comes into play. One economic and social reason is that locals copy the consumption patterns of those higher up the social scale in order to improve their [[social status]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Tourism has also been accused of affecting social behavior of the younger members of a host community, who may imitate what tourists do, impacting traditional value systems.\n\n==== Criticisms of the demonstration effect ====\nThere are many criticisms of the demonstration effect in tourism. Firstly, tourism is seen as only one aspect of change in society. Local people also see examples of foreign lifestyles and consumption in [[Advertising|advertisements]], magazines, television, and films, and therefore tourism is not the only influence on local culture.<ref name=\":1\" /> In addition, the demonstration effect implies that a culture is \"weak\" and needs to be protected by outside influences. In many cases, the demonstrative effect is seen as a negative consequence, but it is argued that \"all cultures are in a continual process of change\", therefore tourism should not be considered destructive.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Community participation ===\n[[Public participation|Community participation]] refers to the collaboration between community members for the purposes of achieving common goals, improving their local community and pursuing individual benefits.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Jaafar|first=Mastura|last2=Rasoolimanesh|first2=S Mostafa|last3=Ismail|first3=Safura|title=Perceived sociocultural impacts of tourism and community participation: A case study of Langkawi Island|journal=Tourism and Hospitality Research|volume=17|issue=2|pages=123\u2013134|doi=10.1177/1467358415610373|year=2017}}</ref> Local community members are actively involved in tourism, rather than passively benefiting from it. Community participation strengthens communities and help to create a sense of belonging, trust and credibility among members.<ref name=\":2\" /> By involving local community members, tourism can become more authentic. The community and the tourists both benefit from community participation, as it boosts their respect for the traditional lifestyle and values of the destination community. Most destination community members are also the ones most impacted by tourism, therefore there is an importance in their involvement in tourism planning. Some researchers will argue that some of the negative impacts of tourism might be avoided and the positive impacts maximized through community participation in the planning process.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Acculturation===\n[[Acculturation]] is the process of modifying an existing culture through borrowing from the more dominant of cultures. Typically in tourism, the community being acculturated is the destination community, which then experiences dramatic shifts in social structure and world view. Societies adapt to acculturation in one of two ways. Innovation diffusion is when the community adopts practices that are developed by another group; whereas cultural adaptation is less adoption of a new culture and more the process of changing when the existing culture is changed.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web |last=KASTAMU|first=MATATIZO PETER|title=Tourism as Acculturation Process and a Modern Leisure Activity|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jh4RcWlsMZ0/14883309}}</ref> Acculturation is often seen as a method of modernizing a community and there are many opposing views to the concept of modernization. One argument against modernization is that it contributes to the \"homogenization of cultural differences and the decline of traditional societies\".<ref name=\":3\" /> This means that communities will advertise their modernity to attract tourists, and will disregard their traditional customs and values. On the other hand, others argue that acculturation and modernization will help traditional communities adjust in a modern world. The idea being that teaching people to adapt will save the community from future extinction.\n\n=== Positive socio-cultural impacts===\n\nThere are number of benefits for the host community as a result of tourism. This includes economic benefits such as opportunities for local businesses which allows for increased trade among the increased number of visitors and then develops a variety of local businesses. In addition, tourism also brings employment opportunities, enhances the economy of the region, and creates revenue for the local government. Tourists also use [[public service]]s, creating funding for public services, such as health, the police and the fire department, as well as increasing the demand for public transport. Other public facilities, such as parks and benches are also well kept by the community for the tourists, improving the overall [[aesthetics]] of the host community. On a more social level, tourism leads to intercultural interaction. Tourists often engage and learn from the locals. Tourism can also increase pride in locals. They want to show off their community that tourists have chosen to visit. The increase in people also leads to creating more social venues and experiences where locals and tourists can interact in. Entertainment and [[recreation]]al facilities will allow for more opportunity to socialize and engage with each other.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Deery|first=Margaret|last2=Jago|first2=Leo|last3=Fredline|first3=Liz|title=Rethinking social impacts of tourism research: A new research agenda|journal=Tourism Management|volume=33|issue=1|pages=64\u201373|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2011.01.026|year=2012}}</ref> Tourism can be beneficial for the host community as it provides the financial means and the incentive to preserve cultural histories, [[local heritage]] sites, and customs. It stimulates interest in local crafts, traditional activities, songs, dance, and [[oral histories]]. It also opens up the community to the wider world, new ideas, new experiences, and new ways of thinking.<ref name=\"Ryan\">Ryan, C. (2003).

(1999). \"Techniques for socially [[sustainable tourism]] development: lessons from Mexico\". ''Department of Geography Publication Series'', University of Waterloo, 52, 193\u2013212.</ref> In terms of economic disadvantages, local communities need to be able to fund the tourist demands, which leads to an increase of taxes. The overall price of living increases in tourist destinations in terms of rent and rates, as well as property values going up. This can be problematic for locals looking to buy property or others on a fixed income.<ref name=\":4\" /> In addition, to balance out tourist destinations, the number of locals to tourists must be relatively equal. This can be more problematic for tourists as their access could be denied. Other negative sociocultural impacts are differences in social and moral values among the local host community and the visiting tourist. Outside of affecting the relationship between tourist and local, it can also cause friction between groups of the local population. In addition, it can cause drifts in the dynamics between the old and new generations. Tourism has also correlated to the rise of delinquent behaviors in local host communities. Crime rates have been seen to rise with the increase of tourists. Crimes are typically those of rowdy behavior, alcohol and illegal [[drug user|drug use]], and loud noise. In addition, gambling and prostitution is increased due to tourists looking for a \"good time\".<ref name=\":4\" /> Tourism has also caused more disruption in host communities. Crowding of locals and tourists may create a vibrant ambiance, it also causes frustration and leads to the withdrawal of local residents in many places. Increased tourists also results in increased traffic which can hinder daily life of the local residents.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Economic impacts ==\nGlobal tourism in 2014 contributed 3.7 percent (US$2.5&nbsp;billion) to the world's GDP, with its total contribution rising to almost 10 percent of world GDP.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\">Turner, R. (2015). ''Travel and Tourism: Economic Impact 2015 World'' (pp. 1\u201320).

(2007). \"Regional economic impacts of tourism: The case of Denmark\". ''Regional Studies'', 41(6), 839\u2013854.</ref>\n\nThe economic contribution of tourism is felt in both direct and indirect ways, where direct economic impacts are created when commodities like the following are sold: accommodation and entertainment, food and beverages services, and retail opportunities.  Residents, visitors, businesses, and various levels of governments (municipal to federal) all influence direct tourism impacts through their spending in or near a given tourism area.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/><ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Goeldner and Ritchie 2007\">Goeldner, C. R., & Ritchie, J. B. (2007). ''Tourism Principles, Practices, Philosophies''. John Wiley & Sons.</ref> The key component of direct economic impacts of tourism is that they occur within a country's borders and are implemented by \"residents and non-residents for business and leisure purposes\".<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\nIn contrast, indirect economic impacts of tourism can be found in investment spending surrounding a tourism offering from private and governmental interests. This investment may not explicitly be related to tourism, but benefits the tourist and local [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] all the same.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> Indirect impacts of tourism are exemplified by the purchase and sale of intermediary items like additional supplies for restaurants during the high tourism season, or widened sidewalks in busy downtown centres.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /> Indirect economic impacts (the supply chain, investment, and government collective) account for 50.7 percent of the total GDP contribution from travel and tourism in 2014.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\nInduced spending, the re-circulation of a tourist dollar within a community, is another way that tourism indirectly has an impact on a community.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\">Rollins, R., Dearden, P. and Fennell, D.

Toronto: Oxford University Press</ref> For example, a foreign tourist injects money into the local economy when he spends a dollar on a souvenir made by a local at the tourism destination.

(1997). \"Estimating the economic impacts of tourism\". ''Annals of Tourism Research'', 24(3), 592\u2013608.</ref>\n\n=== Positive and negative economic impacts of tourism ===\nThere are both positive and negative effects on communities related to the economic impacts of tourism in their communities.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/>  A positive impact can refer to the increase in jobs, a higher quality of life for locals, and an increase in wealth of an area. Tourism also has the advantage of rebuilding and restoring historic sites and encouraging the revitalization of cultures.<ref name=\"Wyllie\">Robert W. Wyllie. 2000. ''Tourism and Society; A guide to problems and issues''. Venture Publishing. State College, Pennsylvania. Chapters 01-03</ref> A positive impact is to increase or to make better either for the tourist, the host community and residence and/or the tourist destination. Positive impacts are related more to the materialistic well-being, rather than to the happiness of a host community or tourist.<ref>Kyungmi K. (2002) Doctor of Philosophy in Hospitality and Tourism and Management: [https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/29954/Title_and_Text.pdf?sequence=1 The Effects of Tourism Impacts upon Quality of Life of Residents in the community], Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. Retrieved from: 28 November 2016</ref>\n\nThe tourist destination enjoys positive impacts, if there have been improvements to the natural environment such as protection, [[national parks]], or man-made infrastructure, waste-treatment plants. Tourism provides the economic stimulus to allow for diversification of employment and income potential, and develop resources within the community. Improvements in infrastructure and services can benefit both the locals and the tourists.<ref name=\"Fernandes\"/><ref name=\"Fagence\" /><ref name=\"Mason\"/> Whereas, [[heritage tourism]] focuses on local history or historical events that occurred in the area, and tends to promote education.<ref>Pigram, J. J. (1993). \"Planning for Tourism in Rural Areas: Bridging the Policy Implementation Gap\". ''Tourism Research: Critiques and Challenges. Routledge, London, 156\u2013174.</ref> Positive impacts begin when there is an increase in job opportunities for locals as the tourism industry becomes more developed. There is also an increase in average income that spreads throughout the community when tourism is capitalized on.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> In addition, the local economy is stimulated and diversified, goods are manufactured more locally, and new markets open for local business owners to expand to.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> Unfortunately, these benefits are not universal nor invulnerable. While more employment may be available, tourism-related jobs are often seasonal and low-paying.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/> Prices are known to fluctuate throughout the year. They rise in the high tourist season to take advantage of more tourist dollars, but have the side effect of pricing goods above the economic reach of local residents, effectively starving them out of a place that was once their home.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/>\n\nNegative impacts are the effects, that are caused in most cases, at the tourist destination site with detrimental impacts to the social and cultural area, as well as the natural environment. As the population increases so do the impacts, [[resources]] become unsustainable and exhausted, the carrying capacity for tourists in a destination site may become depleted.<ref name=\"Nelson\">J.G Nelson, R. Butler, G. Wall. (1999). \"Tourism and Sustainable Development; A Civic Approach\". ''Heritage Resource Centre Joint Publication'', Number 2. ''University of Waterloo and Department of Geography Publication Series'', Number 52. University of Waterloo</ref> Often, when negative impacts occur, it is too late to impose restrictions and [[regulations]]. Tourist destinations seem to discover that many of the negative impacts are found in the development stage of the tourism area life cycle (TALC).<ref name=\"Nelson\" />\n\nAdditionally, the economics of tourism have been shown to push out local tourism business owners in favour of strangers to the region.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Mason\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/> Foreign ownership creates leakage (revenues leaving the host community for another nation or multinational business) which strips away the opportunity for locals to make meaningful profits.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\">Tyrrell, T. J., & Johnston, R. J. (2006). \"The Economic Impacts of Tourism: A Special Issue\". ''Journal of Travel Research'', 45(1), 3\u20137.</ref> Foreign companies are also known to hire non-resident seasonal workers because they can pay those individuals lower wages, which further contributes to economic leakage. Tourism can raise property values near the tourism area, effectively pushing out locals and encouraging businesses to migrate inwards to encourage and take advantage of more tourist spending.<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/>\n\n=== Employment ===\nEmployment, and both its availability and exclusivity, are subsets of economic impacts of tourism.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Travel and tourism create 10.7 percent of the total available jobs worldwide, in both the direct and indirect tourism sectors.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Direct tourism jobs, those that provide the visitor with their tourism experience include, but are not limited to: accommodation (building, cleaning, managing), food and drink services, entertainment, manufacturing, and shopping<ref name=\"Rollins et al\"/><ref name=\"Wagner 1997\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Indirect tourism employment opportunities include the manufacturing of aircraft, boats, and other transportation, as well as the construction of additional [[superstructure]] and infrastructure necessary to accommodate these travel products (airports, harbours, etc.)<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\n===Tourism satellite account===\nThe [[World Travel and Tourism Council]] (WTTC) tourism satellite account (TSA) is a system of measurement recognized by the United Nations to define the extent of an economic sector that is not so easily defined as industries like [[forest industry|forestry]] or [[oil and gas industry|oil and gas]]<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Tourism does not fit neatly into a statistical model; because it is not so much dependent on the physical movement of products and services, as it is on the position of the consumer.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/><ref name=\"Buhalis\"/> Therefore, TSAs were designed to standardize these many offerings for an international scale to facilitate better understanding of current tourism circumstances locally and abroad.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> The standardization includes concepts, classifications, and definitions, and is meant to enable researchers, industry professionals, and the average tourism business owner to view international comparisons.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\nBefore TSAs were widely implemented, a gap existed in the available knowledge about tourism as an economic driver for GDP, employment, investment, and industry consumption; indicators were primarily approximations and therefore lacking in scientific and analytical viewpoints.<ref name=\"Goeldner and Ritchie 2007\"/><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/><ref name=\"Buhalis\">Buhalis, D., & Costa, C. (2006). ''Tourism Management Dynamics: Trends, Management, and Tools''. Routledge.</ref> This gap meant missed opportunities for development, as tourism stakeholders were unable to understand where they might be able to better establish themselves in the tourism economy. For example, a TSA can measure tax revenues related to tourism, which is a key contributor to the level of enthusiasm any level of government might have towards potential tourism investment.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> In addition, Tyrrell and Johnston<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> suggest that stakeholders in tourism benefit from the TSA because it:\n\n* provides credible data on the impact of tourism and the associated employment\n* is a framework for organizing statistical data on tourism\n* is an international standard endorsed by the UN Statistical Commission\n* is an instrument for designing economic policies related to tourism development\n* provides data on tourism's impact on a nation's balance of payments\n* provides information on tourism human resource characteristics\n\nThrough collection of more qualitative data and translating it into a more concise and effective form for tourism providers, TSAs are able to fill the previous knowledge gap.<ref name=\"Buhalis\"/> Information delivered and measured by a TSA includes tax revenues, economic impact on national balances, human resources, employment, and \"tourism's contribution to gross domestic product\".<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/>\n\n=== Projections for 2020 ===\nPredictions for the extent to which impacts of tourism will impact the [[world economy|world's economic system]] appear to agree that the number of international tourist arrivals will reach approximately 1.6&nbsp;billion by the year 2020.<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Of those tourists, 1.18&nbsp;billion are expected to be intra-regional, and 377 million to be long-haul.<ref name=\"Tyrrell\"/> Of these travelers, arrivals in [[developing countries]] are expected to continue growing from the recorded 47% of total arrivals recorded in 2011 as access to these more remote locations becomes easier<ref name=\"Muchapondwa 2013\" /><ref name=\"Norjana et al., 2014\"/><ref name=\"Zhang et al\" />\nDirect contributions of travel and tourism to the world economy and GDP are expected to rise from 3.09 percent in 2015 to 3.3 percent in 2025, with most impacts found in the investment and supply chain sectors.<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> [[employment rate|Employment]] is anticipated to rise parallel to GDP contributions; reaching 3.9 percent of world employment in 2025 (up from 3.6 percent in 2015).<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/> Direct tourism employment in 2025 will be an estimated 3.9 percent of total world employment (up from approximately 3.6 percent in 2015), while indirect tourism employment will be at approximately 4.5 percent (up from 3.6 percent in 2015).<ref name=\"Turner 2015\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Sustainable tourism]]\n*[[Overtourism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite journal|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325376012|first1= A.|last1= Gorrini|first2= V.|last2=Bertini |title= Walkability assessment and tourism cities: the case of Venice|date= 31 May 2018|quote= Tourism-based assessment in the historical Venice.

Further formulas are specific to parallelograms:\n\nA parallelogram with base ''b'' and height ''h'' can be divided into a [[trapezoid]] and a [[right triangle]], and rearranged into a [[rectangle]], as shown in the figure to the left. This means that the [[area]] of a parallelogram is the same as that of a rectangle with the same base and height:\n\n:<math>K = bh.</math>\n\n[[File:Parallelogram area.svg|thumb|The area of the parallelogram is the area of the blue region, which is the interior of the parallelogram]]\nThe base \u00d7 height area formula can also be derived using the figure to the right. The area ''K'' of the parallelogram to the right (the blue area) is the total area of the rectangle less the area of the two orange triangles. The area of the rectangle is\n\n:<math>K_\\text{rect} = (B+A) \\times H\\,</math>\n\nand the area of a single orange triangle is\n\n:<math>K_\\text{tri} = \\frac{1}{2} A \\times H. \\,</math>\n\nTherefore, the area of the parallelogram is\n\n:<math>K = K_\\text{rect} - 2 \\times K_\\text{tri} = ( (B+A) \\times H) - ( A \\times H) = B \\times H.</math>\n\nAnother area formula, for two sides ''B'' and ''C'' and angle \u03b8, is\n\n:<math>K = B \\cdot C \\cdot \\sin \\theta.\\,</math>\n\nThe area of a parallelogram with sides ''B'' and ''C'' (''B'' \u2260 ''C'') and angle <math>\\gamma</math> at the intersection of the diagonals is given by<ref>Mitchell, Douglas W., \"The area of a quadrilateral\", ''Mathematical Gazette'', July 2009.</ref>\n\n:<math>K = \\frac{|\\tan \\gamma|}{2} \\cdot \\left| B^2 - C^2 \\right|.</math>\n\nWhen the parallelogram is specified from the lengths ''B'' and ''C'' of two adjacent sides together with the length ''D''<sub>1</sub> of either diagonal, then the area can be found from [[Heron's formula]]. Specifically it is\n\n:<math>K=2\\sqrt{S(S-B)(S-C)(S-D_1)}</math>\n\nwhere <math>S=(B+C+D_1)/2</math> and the leading factor 2 comes from the fact that the chosen diagonal divides the parallelogram into ''two'' congruent triangles.\n\n===Area in terms of Cartesian coordinates of vertices===\nLet vectors <math>\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b}\\in\\R^2</math> and let <math>V = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2 \\\\ b_1 & b_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\in\\R^{2 \\times 2}</math> denote the matrix with elements of '''a''' and '''b'''.

Then the area of the parallelogram generated by '''a''' and '''b''' is equal to <math>\\sqrt{\\det(V V^\\mathrm{T})}</math>.\n\nLet points <math>a,b,c\\in\\R^2</math>. Then the area of the parallelogram with vertices at ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' is equivalent to the absolute value of the determinant of a matrix built using ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' as rows with the last column padded using ones as follows:\n:<math>K = \\left| \\det \\begin{bmatrix}\n        a_1 & a_2 & 1 \\\\\n        b_1 & b_2 & 1 \\\\\n        c_1 & c_2 & 1\n \\end{bmatrix} \\right|. </math>\n\n==Proof that diagonals bisect each other==\n[[File:Parallelogram1.svg|right|Parallelogram ABCD]]\nTo prove that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, we will use [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] [[Triangle#Basic facts|triangle]]s:\n:<math>\\angle ABE \\cong \\angle CDE</math> ''(alternate interior angles are equal in measure)''\n:<math>\\angle BAE \\cong \\angle DCE</math>  ''(alternate interior angles are equal in measure)''.\n\n(since these are angles that a transversal makes with [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel lines]] ''AB'' and ''DC'').\n\nAlso, side ''AB'' is equal in length to side ''DC'', since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length.\n\nTherefore, triangles ''ABE'' and ''CDE'' are congruent (ASA postulate, ''two corresponding angles and the included side'').\n\nTherefore,\n:<math>AE = CE</math>\n:<math>BE = DE.</math>\n\nSince the diagonals ''AC'' and ''BD'' divide each other into segments of equal length, the diagonals bisect each other.\n\nSeparately, since the diagonals ''AC'' and ''BD'' bisect each other at point ''E'', point ''E'' is the midpoint of each diagonal.\n\n== Lattice of parallelograms==\nParallelograms can tile the plane by translation.

If ''ABC'' is an automedian triangle in which vertex ''A'' stands opposite the side ''a'',  ''G'' is the [[centroid]] (where the three medians of ''ABC'' intersect), and ''AL'' is one of the extended medians of ''ABC'' with ''L'' lying on the circumcircle of ''ABC'', then ''BGCL'' is a parallelogram.\n\n===Varignon parallelogram===\n\nThe [[midpoint]]s of the sides of an arbitrary quadrilateral are the vertices of a parallelogram, called its Varignon parallelogram.

Further formulas are specific to parallelograms:\n\nA parallelogram with base ''b'' and height ''h'' can be divided into a [[trapezoid]] and a [[right triangle]], and rearranged into a [[rectangle]], as shown in the figure to the left. This means that the [[area]] of a parallelogram is the same as that of a rectangle with the same base and height:\n\n:<math>K = bh.</math>\n\n[[File:Parallelogram area.svg|thumb|The area of the parallelogram is the area of the blue region, which is the interior of the parallelogram]]\nThe base \u00d7 height area formula can also be derived using the figure to the right. The area ''K'' of the parallelogram to the right (the blue area) is the total area of the rectangle less the area of the two orange triangles. The area of the rectangle is\n\n:<math>K_\\text{rect} = (B+A) \\times H\\,</math>\n\nand the area of a single orange triangle is\n\n:<math>K_\\text{tri} = \\frac{1}{2} A \\times H. \\,</math>\n\nTherefore, the area of the parallelogram is\n\n:<math>K = K_\\text{rect} - 2 \\times K_\\text{tri} = ( (B+A) \\times H) - ( A \\times H) = B \\times H.</math>\n\nAnother area formula, for two sides ''B'' and ''C'' and angle \u03b8, is\n\n:<math>K = B \\cdot C \\cdot \\sin \\theta.\\,</math>\n\nThe area of a parallelogram with sides ''B'' and ''C'' (''B'' \u2260 ''C'') and angle <math>\\gamma</math> at the intersection of the diagonals is given by<ref>Mitchell, Douglas W., \"The area of a quadrilateral\", ''Mathematical Gazette'', July 2009.</ref>\n\n:<math>K = \\frac{|\\tan \\gamma|}{2} \\cdot \\left| B^2 - C^2 \\right|.</math>\n\nWhen the parallelogram is specified from the lengths ''B'' and ''C'' of two adjacent sides together with the length ''D''<sub>1</sub> of either diagonal, then the area can be found from [[Heron's formula]]. Specifically it is\n\n:<math>K=2\\sqrt{S(S-B)(S-C)(S-D_1)}</math>\n\nwhere <math>S=(B+C+D_1)/2</math> and the leading factor 2 comes from the fact that the chosen diagonal divides the parallelogram into ''two'' congruent triangles.\n\n===Area in terms of Cartesian coordinates of vertices===\nLet vectors <math>\\mathbf{a},\\mathbf{b}\\in\\R^2</math> and let <math>V = \\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_2 \\\\ b_1 & b_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\in\\R^{2 \\times 2}</math> denote the matrix with elements of '''a''' and '''b'''.

Then the area of the parallelogram with vertices at ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' is equivalent to the absolute value of the determinant of a matrix built using ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' as rows with the last column padded using ones as follows:\n:<math>K = \\left| \\det \\begin{bmatrix}\n        a_1 & a_2 & 1 \\\\\n        b_1 & b_2 & 1 \\\\\n        c_1 & c_2 & 1\n \\end{bmatrix} \\right|. </math>\n\n==Proof that diagonals bisect each other==\n[[File:Parallelogram1.svg|right|Parallelogram ABCD]]\nTo prove that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, we will use [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] [[Triangle#Basic facts|triangle]]s:\n:<math>\\angle ABE \\cong \\angle CDE</math> ''(alternate interior angles are equal in measure)''\n:<math>\\angle BAE \\cong \\angle DCE</math>  ''(alternate interior angles are equal in measure)''.\n\n(since these are angles that a transversal makes with [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel lines]] ''AB'' and ''DC'').\n\nAlso, side ''AB'' is equal in length to side ''DC'', since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length.\n\nTherefore, triangles ''ABE'' and ''CDE'' are congruent (ASA postulate, ''two corresponding angles and the included side'').\n\nTherefore,\n:<math>AE = CE</math>\n:<math>BE = DE.</math>\n\nSince the diagonals ''AC'' and ''BD'' divide each other into segments of equal length, the diagonals bisect each other.\n\nSeparately, since the diagonals ''AC'' and ''BD'' bisect each other at point ''E'', point ''E'' is the midpoint of each diagonal.\n\n== Lattice of parallelograms==\nParallelograms can tile the plane by translation.

He has just finished shooting his latest film ''[[Sal\u00f2, or the 120 Days of Sodom]]'', a film that has shocked both critics and audiences. Pasolini is increasingly opposed by the people, critics and politicians, both for his [[homosexuality]], and because he is considered impulsive and scandalous in showing his reality to the public. Pasolini is going to shoot a new film (which was never made), in which he cast [[Ninetto Davoli]] as the famous Italian actor [[Eduardo De Filippo]] and [[Riccardo Scamarcio]] as the young De Fillipo - with whom he has a special relationship. While Pasolini is working on the film, his mother ([[Adriana Asti]]) and his sister try to dissuade him from the project, because it would be too wild and visionary for the Italian public to accept.\n\nPasolini continues with his work, missing many interviews with journalists. He begins a relationship with a boy from the suburbs of Rome, Pino Pelosi, and takes him to a restaurant in the seaside village of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]]. Pasolini wants to be with him in a loving relationship, but the boy gets mad at him, attacking him and some other companions. Pasolini is later beaten up, and then run over with his own car. In the days following, the press says Pasolini's murder was politically motivated by the police and those whom the poet had always loved and immortalized in his works.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]\n* [[Ninetto Davoli]] as [[Eduardo De Filippo]]\n* [[Riccardo Scamarcio]] as [[Ninetto Davoli]]\n* [[Valerio Mastandrea]] as Domenico \"Nico\" Naldini\n* [[Adriana Asti]] as Susanna Pasolini\n* [[Giada Colagrande]] as Graziella Chiarcossi\n* [[Maria de Medeiros]] as [[Laura Betti]]\n* Francesco Siciliano as [[Furio Colombo]]\n* [[Luca Lionello]] as narrator\n\n==Production==\nAccording to Ferrara, his plans to make a film about Pasolini have gone far back as the 1990s.

He has just finished shooting his latest film ''[[Sal\u00f2, or the 120 Days of Sodom]]'', a film that has shocked both critics and audiences. Pasolini is increasingly opposed by the people, critics and politicians, both for his [[homosexuality]], and because he is considered impulsive and scandalous in showing his reality to the public. Pasolini is going to shoot a new film (which was never made), in which he cast [[Ninetto Davoli]] as the famous Italian actor [[Eduardo De Filippo]] and [[Riccardo Scamarcio]] as the young De Fillipo - with whom he has a special relationship. While Pasolini is working on the film, his mother ([[Adriana Asti]]) and his sister try to dissuade him from the project, because it would be too wild and visionary for the Italian public to accept.\n\nPasolini continues with his work, missing many interviews with journalists. He begins a relationship with a boy from the suburbs of Rome, Pino Pelosi, and takes him to a restaurant in the seaside village of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]]. Pasolini wants to be with him in a loving relationship, but the boy gets mad at him, attacking him and some other companions. Pasolini is later beaten up, and then run over with his own car. In the days following, the press says Pasolini's murder was politically motivated by the police and those whom the poet had always loved and immortalized in his works.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Willem Dafoe]] as [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]]\n* [[Ninetto Davoli]] as [[Eduardo De Filippo]]\n* [[Riccardo Scamarcio]] as [[Ninetto Davoli]]\n* [[Valerio Mastandrea]] as Domenico \"Nico\" Naldini\n* [[Adriana Asti]] as Susanna Pasolini\n* [[Giada Colagrande]] as Graziella Chiarcossi\n* [[Maria de Medeiros]] as [[Laura Betti]]\n* Francesco Siciliano as [[Furio Colombo]]\n* [[Luca Lionello]] as narrator\n\n==Production==\nAccording to Ferrara, his plans to make a film about Pasolini have gone far back as the 1990s. Originally, the project was not meant to have been an actual biopic of Pasolini's life.  Instead, it was to have starred [[Zo\u00eb Tamerlis Lund]] as \"a female director living the life that Pasolini lived.\" However, Lund's death prevented this idea.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vestby|first=Ethan|title=Abel Ferrara On Artistic Freedom, Collaboration, \u2018Ms. 45,\u2019 Pier Paolo Pasolini & More|date=9 December 2013|url=http://thefilmstage.com/features/abel-ferrara-on-artistic-freedom-collaboration-ms-45-pier-paolo-pasolini-more/|accessdate=23 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn the review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has a 78% approval rating, based on 51 reviews, with a [[weighted arithmetic mean|weighted average]] of 6.89/10.

Their musical style shifted in the direction of progressive rock with the albums ''[[Aqualung (Jethro Tull album)|Aqualung]]'' (1971), ''[[Thick as a Brick]]'' (1972) and ''[[A Passion Play]]'' (1973), and shifted again to hard rock mixed with [[folk rock]] with ''[[Songs from the Wood]]'' (1977) and ''[[Heavy Horses]]'' (1978). After an excursion into [[electronic rock]] in the early-to-mid 1980s, the band won its sole [[Grammy Award]] with the 1987 album ''[[Crest of a Knave]]''.

The current band line-up includes musicians who have been members of Anderson's solo band since 2012.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[Ian Anderson]], [[Jeffrey Hammond]] and [[John Evan]] (originally Evans), who would become members of Jethro Tull, attended [[grammar school]] together in [[Blackpool]]. Anderson was born in [[Dunfermline]], [[Scotland]] and grew up in [[Edinburgh]] before moving to Blackpool in January 1960.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=4}} Evans had become a fan of [[the Beatles]] after seeing them play \"[[Love Me Do]]\" on [[Granada Television]]'s ''Scene at 6:30''. Though he was an accomplished pianist, he decided to take up the drums, as it was an instrument featured in the Beatles' line-up.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=5\u20136}} Anderson had acquired a [[Classical guitar|Spanish guitar]] and taught himself how to play it, and the pair decided to form a band.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=7}} The pair recruited Hammond on bass, who brought along his collection of [[blues music|blues]] records to listen to.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=8}}\n\nThe group initially played as a three piece at local clubs and venues, before Evans became influenced by [[Georgie Fame]] and [[the Animals]] and switched to organ, recruiting drummer [[Barriemore Barlow|Barrie Barlow]]{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=14\u201315}} and guitarist Mike Stephens from local band the Atlantics.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=12}}{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=12}} By 1964 the band had recruited guitarist Chris Riley{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=12}} and developed into a six-piece [[blue-eyed soul]] band called the John Evan Band (later the John Evan Smash). Evans had shortened his surname to \"Evan\" at the insistence of Hammond, who thought it sounded better and more unusual. The group recruited Johnny Taylor as a booking agent and played gigs further afield around northwest England,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=15}} playing a mixture of blues and [[Motown]] covers.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=14}} Hammond subsequently quit the band to go to [[art school]].{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=15}} He was briefly replaced by Derek Ward, then by [[Glenn Cornick]].{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=17}} Riley also quit and was replaced by Neil Smith.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=17}} The group recorded three songs at Regent Sound Studios in [[Denmark Street]], London in April 1967, and appeared at [[The Marquee]] club in June.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=27}}\n\nIn November 1967, the band moved to the London area, basing themselves in [[Luton]]. They signed a management deal with Terry Ellis and Chris Wright and replaced Smith with guitarist [[Mick Abrahams]],{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=19}} but quickly realised that supporting a 6-piece band was financially impractical, and the group split up. Anderson, Abrahams and Cornick decided to stay together, recruiting Abrahams' friend [[Clive Bunker]] on drums{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=18}} and becoming a [[British blues]] band.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=26}} Cornick recalled that although Evan left, the band said he was welcome to rejoin at a later date.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=27}} Anderson shared a ground-floor flat with Cornick in a large house at the top of Studley Road in Luton,<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/zzjul76.htm Zigzag, July 1976]</ref> and worked as a cleaner for the Luton Ritz Cinema to pay the rent.<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/bbc79a.htm BBC Radio interview, March 1979]</ref> According to Cornick, \"we were so poor that we would share one can of stew or soup between us each evening.\" <ref>[https://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2011/12/glenn-cornick-interview-about-jethro.html Psychedelic Baby Magazine, 13 December 2011] Retrieved 22 September 2019</ref>\n\n===Early years (1967\u20131968)===\nAt first, the new band had trouble getting repeat bookings and they took to changing their name frequently to continue playing the London club circuit, names which included \"Navy Blue\", \"Ian Henderson's Bag o' Nails\", and \"Candy Coloured Rain\". Anderson recalled looking at a poster at a club and concluding that the band name he didn't recognise was his.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=22}} Band names were often supplied by their booking agents' staff, one of whom, a history enthusiast, eventually christened them \"Jethro Tull\" after [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|the 18th-century agriculturist]]. The name stuck because they happened to be using it the first time a club manager liked their show enough to invite them to return.<ref name=\"billboard end\"/> They recorded a session with producer [[Derek Lawrence]], which resulted in the single \"Sunshine Day\". The B-side \"Aeroplane\" was an old John Evan Band track with the saxophones mixed out. It was released in February 1968 on [[MGM Records]], miscredited to \"Jethro Toe\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|pp=23\u201323}} Anderson has since questioned the misnomer as a way to avoid paying royalties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austindaze.com/2006/08/29/jethro-tull-ian-anderson/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108173613/http://www.austindaze.com/2006/08/29/jethro-tull-ian-anderson/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 November 2011 |title=Jethro Tull (Ian Anderson) |publisher=Austin Daze |date=29 August 2006 |accessdate=11 November 2012 }}</ref> The more common version, with the name spelled correctly, is actually a [[counterfeit]] made in New York.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dag Sandbu |url=http://www.collecting-tull.com/Collectibles/7_JethroToe.htm |title=MGM Jethro Toe |publisher=Collecting-tull.com |accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref> Anderson later met Hammond while in London and the two renewed their friendship, while Anderson moved into a [[bedsit]] in Chelsea with Evan.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=35}} Hammond became the subject of several songs, beginning with their next single, \"A Song for Jeffrey\".{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=36}}\n\nAnderson possessed a large [[overcoat]], his father having given it to him with the words \"You'd better take this. It's going to be a cold winter\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Ballad of Jethro Tull |date=2019 |publisher=Rocket 88 |location=London |isbn=9781910978429 |page=25}}</ref> This overcoat, and slightly later on the flute, became part of his early stage image. It was around this time that Anderson purchased a flute after becoming frustrated with his inability to play guitar as well as Abrahams, and because their managers thought he should remain a rhythm guitarist, with Abrahams becoming the front man.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=24}} \n\n<blockquote>I didn't want to be just another third-rate guitar player who sounded like a bunch of other third-rate guitar players. I wanted to do something that was a bit more idiosyncratic, hence the switch to another instrument. When Jethro Tull began, I think I'd been playing the flute for about two weeks. It was a quick learning curve&nbsp;... literally every night I walked onstage was a flute lesson.<ref name=\"Newsome\">Newsome, Jim. \"Living in the Present\". Interview with Ian Anderson, 23 April 2002. [http://www.jimnewsom.com/IanAndersonInterview.html jimnewsom.com]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe group's first major break occurred at the [[National Jazz and Blues Festival]] at [[Sunbury-on-Thames]] in August 1968, where the band drew a rapturous reception and positive reviews in the music press. The band have since claimed that the success at Sunbury was a result of their persistent touring, which had generated a grassroots following who had all assembled at the festival and encouraged the rest of the audience. Cornick recalled, \"from that moment on, we were a big band\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe group recorded their first album, ''[[This Was]]'', between June and August 1968, and it was released in October, reaching number 10 in the charts.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=41,42}} In addition to original material, the album included the traditional \"Cat's Squirrel\", which highlighted Abrahams' blues-rock style, while the [[Rahsaan Roland Kirk]]-penned jazz piece \"Serenade to a Cuckoo\" gave Anderson a showcase for his growing talents on the flute.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=42}} The overall sound of the group at this time was described in the ''[[Record Mirror]]'' by Anderson in 1968 as \"a sort of progressive blues with a bit of jazz\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tullpress.com/rm12oct68.htm |title=Record Mirror, 12 October, 1968 |access-date=11 February 2007 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61DN3yU3K?url=http://www.tullpress.com/rm12oct68.htm |archive-date=26 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the album's release, Abrahams left the band in December to form his own group, [[Blodwyn Pig]].{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=43}} There were a number of reasons given for his departure. Abrahams had heard that Ellis wanted Anderson to be the frontman and group leader, at his expense, and realised he was unlikely to have the majority share in songwriting.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=37}} Other reasons given were that Abrahams was a blues purist while Anderson wanted to branch out into other forms of music, and that Abrahams was unwilling to travel internationally or play more than three nights a week.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themarqueeclub.net/jethro-tull |title=Jethro Tull biography at themarquee.net |publisher=Themarqueeclub.net |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175356/http://www.themarqueeclub.net/jethro-tull |archivedate=19 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.squirrelmusic.com/ |title=Mick's Bio at Mick Abrahams' official website |publisher=Squirrelmusic.com |date=}}</ref> Abrahams himself described his reasons more succinctly: \"I was fed up with all the nonsense, and I wanted to form a band like Blodwyn Pig.\"<ref>Rock Guitar Daily blog. [rockguitardaily.blogspot.com/mick-abrahams]</ref>\n\nThe group tried several replacements for Abrahams. The first was [[David O'List]], who had recently left [[the Nice]]. After a week's rehearsal, O'List didn't show up and lost contact with the group. The next choice was [[Mick Taylor]], who turned the group down because he felt his current gig with [[John Mayall's Bluesbreakers]] was a better deal.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=43}} Following this, the group put an advertisement in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' which was answered by [[Tony Iommi]]. After a few rehearsals, the group appeared in ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' on 11 December. The group performed \"A Song for Jeffrey\", but only Anderson's singing and flute were live; the rest was [[mime]]d. Iommi felt closer to his old band, 'Earth' (now known as Black Sabbath), so he returned to Birmingham to rejoin them. \n\nThe next choice was [[Martin Barre]], who had seen the band perform at Sunbury,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=47}} and had been tried out at the same audition as Iommi. Barre arranged a second audition with Anderson, who showed him some new songs that were in a different style to the blues they had been recording. Anderson was impressed by Barre's technique, and offered him the job as the new guitarist.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=44}} Barre played his first gig with Jethro Tull on 30 December 1968 at the Winter Gardens, Penzance.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=30}}\n\n===''Stand Up'' through ''Aqualung'' (1969\u20131971)===\nAfter Barre joined, the group did a few shows supporting [[Jimi Hendrix]] in Scandinavia,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=49}} then set out on an extensive tour of the US, supporting [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Vanilla Fudge]].{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=31}} Having attracted a substantial live following, Ellis and Wright asked Anderson, who had become the dominant songwriter, to write a hit single. The result was \"[[Living in the Past (song)|Living in the Past]]\", which reached No. 3 in May on the UK singles chart and No. 11 in the US,{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=31}} and resulted in an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. Although other so-called \"serious\" groups actively resisted issuing stand-alone singles at the time, Jethro Tull felt a hit single was a positive move for the group, if not their priority.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=32}}\n\n[[File:Jethro-Tull-9-73(2).jpg|thumb|140px|[[John Evan]], an old schoolfriend and bandmate, joined the band in April 1970, after several invitations to do so]]\nThe next album was ''[[Stand Up (Jethro Tull album)|Stand Up]]'', recorded during April\u2013May and August 1969.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=52}} It was released in September, and quickly reached No. 1 in the UK charts, the only album by the group to do so.

On a \"banter\" track that accompanies the 2005 ''Aqualung Live'' album recorded for [[XM Satellite Radio]], Anderson insisted, \"I always said at the time, this is not a concept album. It's an album of varied songs...in which three or four are kind of the keynote pieces for the album, but it doesn't make it a concept album.\"\n\nIn response to the many critics who called ''Aqualung'' a concept album, Anderson decided to \"come up with something that really is the mother of all concept albums\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=48}} He had become influenced by [[Monty Python]]'s humour, and wrote a suite that combined complex musical ideas with a sense of humour to make fun of the band, its audience and its critics.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=84,85}} The album, released in 1972, became ''[[Thick as a Brick]]'', which was co-credited to a fictional schoolboy, [[Gerald Bostock]].{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=48}} It consisted of a single track running over 43 minutes, split over two sides, which was uncommon for rock albums.{{sfn|Smith|1997|p=113}} Although the finished album was a continuous piece of music, it was written and recorded in stages, with the whole band helping with the arrangements.{{sfn|Nollen|2002|p=83}} ''Thick as a Brick'' was the first Tull album to reach number one on the (US) Billboard Pop Albums chart{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=82}} with the following year's ''[[A Passion Play]]'' being the only other to do so.<ref>{{AllMusic |class=album|id=r10373|tab=charts-awards|label=Billboard chart info ''A Passion Play''|accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jethro-Tull-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Ian Anderson and Martin Barre of Jethro Tull in Chicago, 1973]]\n\n1972 also saw the release of ''[[Living in the Past (album)|Living in the Past]]'', a double-[[compilation album|album compilation]] of remixed singles, [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]s and outtakes (including the entirety of the ''Life Is a Long Song'' EP, which closes the album),{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=87}} with the third side recorded live in 1970 at New York's [[Carnegie Hall]] concert on 4 November 1970.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=67}} The album was successful, as it allowed new fans to catch up with early singles, particularly in the US where they had not been popular on initial release.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=87}} ''[[New Musical Express]]'' called Jethro Tull one of \"Britain's most important and successful 2nd generation progressive bands\".<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/nme1jul72.htm NME, 1 July, 1972]</ref>\n\nIn 1973, while in [[tax exile]], the band attempted to produce a double album at France's [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]] studios, something [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[Elton John]] among others were doing at the time, but supposedly they were unhappy with the quality of the recording studio and abandoned the effort, subsequently mocking the studio as the \"Chateau d'Isaster\". They returned to England, and Anderson did some rewriting before Jethro Tull quickly recorded and released ''[[A Passion Play]]'' (1973), another single-track concept album, with allegorical lyrics focusing on the afterlife. Like ''Thick as a Brick'', ''A Passion Play'' contained instrumentation rather uncommon in rock music. The album also featured an eccentric interlude, \"The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles\", which was co-written (along with Anderson and Evan) and narrated by bassist Hammond.  ''A Passion Play'' sold well but received generally poor reviews, including a particularly damning review of its live performance by Chris Welch of ''[[Melody Maker]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tullpress.com/mm30jun73.htm |title=Melody Maker, 30 June, 1973 |access-date=19 June 2006 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61DN4r5MA?url=http://www.tullpress.com/mm30jun73.htm |archive-date=26 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEven as the band's popularity with critics began to wane around this time, their popularity with the public remained strong, as evidenced by high sales of their follow-up album, 1974's ''[[War Child (album)|War Child]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=16870 |title=\"Bungle in the Jungle by Jethro Tull\" at |publisher=Songfacts.com |date=}}</ref> Originally intended to be a companion piece for a film, it reached number two on the US [[Billboard charts]] and received some critical acclaim, and produced the radio mainstays \"[[Bungle in the Jungle]]\" (#12 on the US singles chart) and \"[[Skating Away on the Thin Ice of the New Day]]\". It also included a short [[Acoustic music|acoustic song]], \"Only Solitaire\", widely thought to be aimed at ''L.A. Times'' rock music critic [[Robert Hilburn]], who had written a harsh review of the ''A Passion Play'' concerts at the [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]]. However, Anderson said the song was written before Hilburn's review and was aimed at music critics in general. The ''War Child'' tour also featured a female [[string quartet]] playing along with the group on the new material.\n\nIn 1975, the band released ''[[Minstrel in the Gallery]]'', an album which resembled ''Aqualung'' (1971) in that it contrasted softer, acoustic-guitar-based pieces with lengthier, more bombastic works headlined by Barre's electric guitar. Written and recorded during Anderson's divorce from his first wife [[Jennie Franks]], the album is characterised by a markedly more introspective tone than their previous album, and critics gave it mixed reviews.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} By this point Jethro Tull had been awarded six [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] gold records for sales of ''Stand Up'' (1969), ''Aqualung'' (1971), ''Thick as a Brick'' (1972), ''Living in the Past'' (1972), ''A Passion Play'' (1973), and ''Minstrel in the Gallery'' (1975).{{sfn|Murrells|1978|p=295}} For the 1975 tour, [[Dee Palmer|David Palmer]], who had long been the band's orchestra arranger, officially joined the band's stage show on keyboards and synthesisers.

[[John Glascock]], who earlier was playing with [[flamenco]]-rock band [[Carmen (rock band)|Carmen]], a support band on the previous Jethro Tull tour, became the band's new bassist.\n\n1976's ''[[Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die!]]'' was another concept album, this time about the life of an ageing rocker. Glascock made his first appearance on this album, contributing harmony and second vocals in addition to the bass lines. Palmer continued to arrange, and he recorded as a guest on two songs. For the 1976 tour, Jethro Tull became one of the first bands to use giant projection screens for the larger stadium shows.<ref name=\"jethrotull.com\"/> Although ''Too Old...'' did not sell as well as the other 1970s albums, the 1976 compilation ''[[M.U. - The Best of Jethro Tull]]'', achieved Platinum Album in US and Gold record in UK. A television special was recorded showing the development of the album's concept in a live show with the band (fully dressed in the most rock-hard-tongue-in-cheek outfits), but the programme was never officially released.\n\n===Folk rock (1977\u20131979)===\n[[File:Jethro Tull 5.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ian Anderson]] playing with Jethro Tull, [[Hammersmith Odeon]], March 1978]]\nIn the late 1970s, Jethro Tull released a trio of [[folk rock]] albums, ''[[Songs from the Wood]]'' (1977), ''[[Heavy Horses]]'' (1978), and ''[[Stormwatch (album)|Stormwatch]]'' (1979). ''Songs from the Wood'' (1977) was the first Tull album to receive generally positive reviews since the release of ''Living in the Past'' (1972).\n\nThe band had long ties to folk rockers [[Steeleye Span]] (Tull were the backing band on Steeleye Span front woman [[Maddy Prior]]'s 1978 solo album ''[[Woman in the Wings]]'' as a way of repaying her for contributing vocals on the ''Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die!'' album) and with [[Fairport Convention]] (Fairport members [[Dave Pegg]], [[Martin Allcock]], [[Dave Mattacks]] and Ric Sanders have all played with Tull at one point or another, as well as folk drummer [[Gerry Conway (musician)|Gerry Conway]] who became a Fairport member after playing with Tull). Although not formally considered a part of the folk rock movement (which had actually begun nearly a decade earlier with the advent of [[Fairport Convention]]), there was clearly an exchange of musical ideas among Tull and the folk rockers.<ref name=\"ArtistWiki\" /> By this time, Anderson had moved to a farm in the countryside, and his new bucolic lifestyle was clearly reflected in his songwriting, as in the title track of ''[[Heavy Horses]]'' (1978), a paean to [[Draft horse|draught horses]].\n\nThe band continued to tour, and released a live double album in 1978, titled ''[[Bursting Out]]'', which was recorded during the European leg of the ''Heavy Horses'' tour. During the US leg of this tour, John Glascock suffered health problems and was replaced by Anderson's friend and former [[Stealers Wheel]] bassist, [[Tony Williams (English musician)|Tony Williams]].\n\nTheir third folk influenced album, ''[[Stormwatch (album)|Stormwatch]]'', was released in 1979.  During the making of the album, Glascock suffered major health issues related to open heart surgery from the previous year, so Anderson played bass on much of the album.  After the release of ''Stormwatch'', due to Glascock's continued health issues, Fairport Convention bassist [[Dave Pegg]] was hired for the ensuing tour, during which Glascock died from heart complications at his home in England.<ref>\"A Tull Tale: Groovemaker in Jon Noyce\".

Different stories have been given over the years for the various reasons behind the band's restructuring, including that Barlow was depressed and withdrawn after Glascock's death and that Evan and Palmer found their futures in the band to be murky with Anderson's announcement that he wanted to work on a solo album. \nIn the 2008 Classic Artists documentary ''Jethro Tull: Their Fully Authorised Story'', Barlow claimed that he left the band on a mutual agreement with Anderson while Evan and Palmer both recalled being dismissed by a letter in the mail, with no prior contact.<ref>{{cite AV media| people = Al-Issawi, Omar (Director)| title = Jethro Tull: Their Fully Authorised Story | medium = DVD| publisher = Classic Artists| location = United Kingdom| date = 2008 }}</ref> \nFollowing their termination from Jethro Tull, Evan and Palmer briefly collaborated in a classical-based pop/rock band called Tallis.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://prod.whinc.net/tullrevision/musicians/pastmembers/johnevan.html| title=Past Members-John Evan| work=prod.whinc.net| accessdate=23 May 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523230652/http://prod.whinc.net/tullrevision/musicians/pastmembers/johnevan.html| archive-date=23 May 2014| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Jethro Tull was left with Anderson (the only original member), Martin Barre and Dave Pegg.\n\nTull's first album of the 1980s was intended to be Ian Anderson's first solo album. Anderson retained Barre on electric guitar and Pegg on bass, while adding [[Mark Craney]] on drums, and special guest keyboardist/violinist [[Eddie Jobson]] (ex\u2013[[Roxy Music]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[Curved Air]] and [[U.K. (band)|U.K.]], the last of which had opened for several shows on Tull's ''Stormwatch'' tour). Highlighted by the prominent use of synthesisers, it contrasted sharply with the established \"Tull sound\".  After pressure from [[Chrysalis Records]], Anderson agreed to release it as a Jethro Tull album. Entitled ''[[A (Jethro Tull album)|A]]'' (taken from the labels on the master tapes for his scrapped solo album, marked simply \"A\" for \"Anderson\"), it was released in mid-1980.\n\nIn keeping with the mood of innovation surrounding the album, Jethro Tull developed a music video titled ''[[Slipstream (video)|Slipstream]]''.<ref>[http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v26124 ''Slipstream'' at allmovie.com] Retrieved 3 September 2014.</ref> Four staged and separately filmed music videos are mixed with concert footage from the ''A'' tour. London's [[HMV Hammersmith Apollo|Hammersmith Odeon]] was used for exterior scenes, but the main concert footage was actually from an American performance in Los Angeles, at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena|Los Angeles Sports Arena]] (as heard on the Magic Piper ROIO), filmed in November 1980. The video, released in 1981, was directed by [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]], who has directed numerous music videos, including the pioneering \"[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]\" video for [[David Bowie]].\n\nJobson and Craney returned to their own work following the ''A'' tour and Jethro Tull entered a period of revolving drummers: [[Gerry Conway (musician)|Gerry Conway]], who left after deciding he couldn't be the one to replace Barlow {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}, [[Phil Collins]] (as a fill-in for the recently departed Gerry Conway, played with the band at the first [[The Prince's Trust|Prince's Trust]] concert in 1982), [[Paul Burgess (musician)|Paul Burgess]] (for the US leg of the Broadsword and the Beast tour, and who left to settle down with his family) and permanent drummer [[Doane Perry]].\n\n1981 was the first year in their career that the band did not release an album; however, some recording sessions took place (Anderson, Barre, Pegg, and Conway, with Anderson playing the keyboards). Some of these tracks were released on the ''[[Nightcap (album)|Nightcap]]'' compilation in 1993.\n\nIn 1982, [[Peter-John Vettese]] joined on keyboards, and the band returned to a somewhat folkier sound\u2014albeit with synthesisers\u2014for 1982's ''[[The Broadsword and the Beast]]''. The ensuing concert tour for the album was well attended and the shows featured what was to be one of the group's last indulgences in full-dress theatricality. The stage was built to resemble a [[Longship|Viking longship]] and the band performed in faux-medieval regalia.\n\nAn Anderson solo album, which was in fact a collaborative Anderson-Vettese effort, appeared in 1983, in the form of the heavily electronic ''[[Walk into Light]]''.  As with later solo efforts by Anderson and Barre, some of the ''Walk into Light'' songs\u2014such as \"Fly by Night\", \"Made in England\" and \"Different Germany\"\u2014later made their way into Jethro Tull live sets.\n\nIn 1984, Jethro Tull released ''[[Under Wraps (Jethro Tull album)|Under Wraps]]'', a heavily electronic album with no \"live\" drummer and instead, as on ''Walk into Light'', a drum-machine was used. Although the band were reportedly proud of the sound, the album was not well received.  However, the video for \"Lap of Luxury\" did manage to earn moderate rotation on the newly influential [[MTV]] music video channel.  As a result of the throat problems Anderson developed singing the demanding ''Under Wraps'' material on tour, Jethro Tull took a three-year break. Vettese quit the band after the tour, angry at critics for the bad reviews of ''The Broadsword and the Beast'' (1982), ''Walk into Light'' (1983), and ''Under Wraps'' (1984).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.isbuc.co.uk/People/IanAnd.htm| title=Ian Anderson| author=Isle of Skye Business Community| accessdate=22 April 2007}}</ref> During this hiatus, Anderson continued to oversee the salmon farm he had founded in 1978, although the single \"Coronach\" was released in the UK in 1986 after it was used as the theme tune for a Channel 4 television program called \"Blood of the British\".\n\n===Anderson, Barre, Pegg and Perry: the \"hard rock\" Tull (1987\u20131994)===\nJethro Tull returned in 1987 with ''[[Crest of a Knave]]''. With Vettese absent (Anderson contributed the synth programming) and the band relying more heavily on Barre's electric guitar than they had since the early 1970s, the album was a critical and commercial success. Shades of their earlier electronic excursions were still present, however, as three of the album's songs again used a drum machine, with Doane Perry and Gerry Conway sharing drum duties on the other tracks. Prior to the ''Crest of a Knave'' tour, keyboardist [[Don Airey]] (ex-[[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Michael Schenker Group]]) joined the band.\n\nThe band won the 1988 [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental]], beating the favorite [[Metallica]] and their ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]'' album. The award was particularly controversial as many did not consider Jethro Tull hard rock, much less heavy metal. On the advice of their manager, who told them they had no chance of winning, no one from the band attended the award ceremony.<ref name=\"ArtistWiki\">{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Jethro+Tull/+wiki |title=Artist Wiki: Jethro Tull |publisher=Last.fm |date=26 November 2013}}</ref> In response to the criticism they received over the award, their label, Chrysalis, took out an advertisement in a British music periodical with a picture of a flute lying amid a pile of iron re-bar and the line, \"the flute is a heavy metal instrument.\" In response to an interview question about the controversy, Ian Anderson quipped, \"Well, we do sometimes play our mandolins very loudly.\" In 2007, the win was named one of the ten biggest upsets in Grammy history by [[Entertainment Weekly]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Grammy's 10 Biggest Upsets| work=Entertainment Weekly| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,1567466_20010834_20010795_0,00.html| accessdate=13 February 2007}}</ref> In 1992, when Metallica finally won the Grammy in the category, Metallica drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] joked, \"First thing we're going to do is thank Jethro Tull for not putting out an album this year\", a play on a Grammy comment by [[Paul Simon]] some years before thanking [[Stevie Wonder]] for the same thing.\n\nThe style of ''[[Crest of a Knave]]'' (1987) has been compared to that of [[Dire Straits]], in part because Anderson no longer seemed to have the vocal range he once possessed and preferred to use the lower registers, while Martin Barre's guitar sound apparently drifted towards [[Mark Knopfler]]'s style. Two songs in particular\u2014\"Farm on the Freeway\" and \"Steel Monkey\"\u2014got heavy radio airplay. The album also contained the popular live song \"Budapest\", which depicts a backstage scene with a shy local female stagehand. Although \"Budapest\" was the longest song on that album (at just over ten minutes), \"Mountain Men\" became more famous in Europe, depicting a scene from World War II in Africa. Ian Anderson referred to the battles of [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]] and the [[Falkland Islands]], drawing historical parallels of the angst that women left behind by their warrior husbands might have felt: {{quote|died in the trenches at El Alamein,<br />died in the Falklands on TV}}\n\nThey toured this album with \"The Not Quite the World, More the Here and There Tour\". It was also the first time in the band's history that it had two electric guitar players on stage, when Anderson, albeit rarely, played rhythm guitar.\n\n1988 was notable for the release of ''[[20 Years of Jethro Tull]]'', a five-LP themed set (also released as a three-CD set, and as a truncated single CD version on ''20 Years of Jethro Tull: Highlights'') consisting largely of rarities and outtakes from throughout the band's history, as well as a variety of live and remastered tracks. It also included a booklet outlining the band's history in detail. Now out of print, it has become a collector's item, although many (but not all) of the outtakes have been included as bonus tracks on remastered releases of the band's studio albums.\n\nIn 1989, the band released ''[[Rock Island (Jethro Tull album)|Rock Island]]'', which met with less commercial and critical success than ''Crest of a Knave'' (1987). The lead-off track, \"Kissing Willie\", featured bawdy double-entendre lyrics and over-the-top heavy metal riffing that seemed to take a satiric view of the group's recent Grammy award win. The song's accompanying video found difficulty in receiving airplay because of its sexual imagery.  Although ''Rock Island'' was something of a miss for the group, a couple of fan favourites did emerge from the album. \"Big Riff and Mando\" reflects life on the road for the relentlessly touring musicians, giving a wry account of the theft of Barre's prized mandolin by a starstruck fan. \"Another Christmas Song\", an upbeat number celebrating the humanitarian spirit of the holiday season, stood out against the brooding and sombre mood of many of the songs on the album and was well received at concerts. It was re-recorded for the 2003 ''[[The Jethro Tull Christmas Album]]'' release.\n\n1991's ''[[Catfish Rising]]'' was a more solid album than ''Rock Island'' (1989). Despite being labelled as a \"return to playing the blues\", the album actually is marked by the generous use of mandolin and acoustic guitar and much less use of keyboards than any Tull album of the Eighties. Notable tracks included \"Rocks on the Road\", which highlighted gritty acoustic guitar work and hard-bitten lyrics about urban life and \"Still Loving You Tonight\", a bluesy, low-key ballad.\n\n===''Roots to Branches'' and ''J-Tull.com'': the world music influences (1995\u20132000)===\n[[File:Jethro tull - Jerusalem 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jethro Tull performing in [[Jerusalem]], 2007]]\n\nFollowing a further, semi-acoustic 1992 tour (which included [[Dave Mattacks]] but not [[Andrew Giddings|Andy Giddings]], and which was documented with ''[[A Little Light Music]]'', the band's second official live album), Anderson relearned how to play the flute (after his daughter, who took up flute classes at school, discovered that her father often used the wrong fingering)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jethro-tull.com/musicians/iananderson/equipment.html |title=Ian Anderson's Equipment&nbsp;\u2013 The Official Jethro Tull Website |publisher=Jethro-tull.com |accessdate=6 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713103527/http://jethro-tull.com/musicians/iananderson/equipment.html |archive-date=13 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and began writing songs that heavily featured world music influences. However, the first Tull releases containing the \"relearned\" flute were the 1993 ''[[25th Anniversary Box Set]]'' which, as well as the remixes of classic songs and unreleased live material, included a whole CD of old songs from the band's entire career recorded by the current line-up, and the 1993 ''[[Nightcap (album)|Nightcap]]'' compilation album containing unreleased studio material (mainly from the scrapped pre-''A Passion Play'' album), with multiple flute parts re-recorded.\n\nPrior to the recording of 1995's ''[[Roots to Branches]]'' album, longstanding bass player Dave Pegg left the band, wishing to concentrate on Fairport Convention and not being keen on the world-music direction the band chose. Doane Perry (returning as the band's full-time drummer) recruited his friend and widely respected session bass player [[Steve Bailey]] to fill the gap: Ian Anderson, in turn, relinquished control of the rhythm section arrangements on that record, leaving them completely to Bailey and Perry. Despite his studio contributions, however, Bailey did not join the band, and Pegg's formal replacement as Jethro Tull bassist was [[Jonathan Noyce]].\n\n''Roots to Branches'' (1995) and 1999's ''[[J-Tull Dot Com]]'' were less rock-based than ''Crest of a Knave'' (1987) or ''Catfish Rising'' (1991). Songs on these albums reflect the musical influences of decades of performing all around the globe. In songs such as \"Out of the Noise\" and \"Hot Mango Flush\", Anderson paints vivid pictures of third-world street scenes. These albums reflected Anderson's coming to grips with being an old rocker, with songs such as the pensive \"Another Harry's Bar\", \"Wicked Windows\" (a meditation on reading glasses), and the gruff \"Wounded, Old and Treacherous\".\n\n===Live albums, world tours and ''The Jethro Tull Christmas Album'' (2001\u20132010)===\nIn January 2002, the original lineup of the band (including Anderson, Abrahams, Cornick and Bunker) reunited for a one-off pub performance in England that was filmed for inclusion in the ''Living with the Past'' DVD.  It was the first and only time the original four members had played together since 1968, as well as the only time a former Tull lineup has ever reunited.\n\n2003 saw the release of ''[[The Jethro Tull Christmas Album]]'', a collection of traditional Christmas songs together with old and new Christmas songs written by Jethro Tull. It is the last studio album of this band. It became the band's biggest commercial success since the 1987 ''Crest of a Knave''. An Ian Anderson live double album and DVD was released in 2005 called ''[[Ian Anderson Plays the Orchestral Jethro Tull]]''. In addition, a DVD entitled ''[[Nothing Is Easy: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970]]'' and a live album ''[[Aqualung Live]]'' (recorded in 2004) were released in 2005.\n\n2006 saw the release of a dual boxed set DVD ''Collector's Edition'', containing two DVDs\u2014''[[Nothing Is Easy: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970]]'' and ''[[Living with the Past]]''. Bassist Jon Noyce left the band in March 2006. Keyboardist [[Andrew Giddings]] quit the band in July 2006, citing constant touring allowing not enough time for family. They were replaced by [[David Goodier]] and [[John O'Hara (musician)|John O'Hara]] respectively. In the following year ''[[The Best of Acoustic Jethro Tull]]'', a 24-song set of Tull's and Ian Anderson's acoustic performances taken from various albums, was released. Included are a new live acoustic version of \"One Brown Mouse\" and a live performance of the traditional song (attributed to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]), \"[[Pastime with Good Company]]\".\n\nIn September 2007, Jethro Tull released CD/DVD ''[[Live at Montreux 2003 (Jethro Tull album)|Live at Montreux 2003]]''. The concert was recorded on 4 July 2003 and featured, among others, \"Fat Man\", \"With You There to Help Me\" and \"Hunting Girl\", with the longest unchanged line-up: Anderson, Barre, Perry, Noyce and Giddings.\n\nIn February 2010, the band were commemorated with a [[Heritage Award]] by [[PRS for Music]]. A plaque was erected on a Catholic church in [[Blackpool]], where the band performed their first ever gig.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/lancashire/8536951.stm |work=BBC News | title=Jethro Tull's church gig honoured | date=25 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Anderson and Barre go solo and the end of Jethro Tull (2011\u20132012)===\n2011 marked the 40th Anniversary of ''[[Aqualung (Jethro Tull album)|Aqualung]]'' (1971). A new re-issue was released with new remix of the album (by [[Porcupine Tree]]'s [[Steven Wilson]]) and include a DVD and unreleased songs.\n\nDuring interviews in November 2011, Martin Barre stated that there were no current plans for future Jethro Tull work. In 2012, Barre assembled and toured with a group, billed as Martin Barre's New Day, which included Jonathan Noyce that played mostly Tull material.<ref name=\"crr\">{{cite web | url=http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/interviewmartinbarre2011.htm | title=Forty years of Aqualung: An interview with Jethro Tull's Martin Barre | accessdate=25 November 2011 | author=Wright, Jeb | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123173724/http://www.classicrockrevisited.com/interviewmartinbarre2011.htm | archive-date=23 November 2011 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|date=22 November 2011|work=Classic Rock Revisited|title=Interview with Martin Barre}}</ref> In 2015, Barre stated \"It's important that people realize there will never be a Jethro Tull again.

This will be followed by tours in the UK and US, during which the album will be played in its entirety. ''Homo Erraticus'' will be a prog-rock concept album which, according to Anderson, \"chronicles the weird imaginings of one Ernest T. Parritt, as recaptured by the now middle-aged Gerald Bostock after a trip to Mathew Bunter's Old Library Bookshop in Linwell village. Bostock and Bunter came across this dusty, unpublished manuscript, written by local amateur historian Ernest T. Parritt, (1873\u20131928), and entitled Homo Britanicus Erraticus.\" Like ''Thick as a Brick 2'', ''Homo Erraticus'' is billed as an Ian Anderson solo album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jethrotull.com/homo-erraticus-the-new-studio-album-from-ian-anderson/ | title=Homo Eratticus&nbsp;\u2013 The New Studio Album From Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson |accessdate=8 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn an April 2014 interview following the release of Anderson's solo album ''Homo Erraticus'', Anderson announced that from that point on, he would be releasing all his music under his own name. Anderson stated that Tull \"kind of came more or less to an end during the last 10 years or so\", and stated his preference \"in my twilight years, to use my own name for the most part being composer of virtually all Tull songs and music since 1968\".<ref name=\"billboard end\"/><ref name=\"billboard end\"/> In the liner notes Anderson explains that he will continue to operate under his own name.\n\n2015 saw Anderson tour with the ''Ian Anderson Touring Band'' and the project ''Jethro Tull&nbsp;\u2013 The Rock Opera''; a lyrically modified Tull repertoire and new rock songs about the namesake of the band, Jethro Tull, together with elaborate video productions to the stage.

Please do not change \"are\" to \"is\". --> a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Blackpool]], Lancashire, in 1967. Initially playing [[blues rock]] and [[jazz fusion]], the band later developed their sound to incorporate elements of [[hard rock]] and [[folk music|folk]] to forge a [[progressive rock]] signature.<ref>{{cite web|last=Eder |first=Bruce |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jethro-tull-p4610 |title=Jethro Tull |website=AllMusic |accessdate=31 March 2012}}</ref> The band is led by vocalist/flautist/guitarist [[Ian Anderson]], and has featured a revolving door of lineups through the years including significant members such as guitarists [[Mick Abrahams]] and [[Martin Barre]], keyboardists [[John Evan]] and [[Dee Palmer]], drummers [[Clive Bunker]], [[Barriemore Barlow]], and [[Doane Perry]], and bassists [[Glenn Cornick]], [[Jeffrey Hammond]], [[John Glascock]], and [[Dave Pegg]].\n\nThe group first achieved commercial success in 1969, with the folk-tinged electric blues album ''[[Stand Up (Jethro Tull album)|Stand Up]]'', which reached No. 1 in the UK, and they toured regularly in the UK and the US. Their musical style shifted in the direction of progressive rock with the albums ''[[Aqualung (Jethro Tull album)|Aqualung]]'' (1971), ''[[Thick as a Brick]]'' (1972) and ''[[A Passion Play]]'' (1973), and shifted again to hard rock mixed with [[folk rock]] with ''[[Songs from the Wood]]'' (1977) and ''[[Heavy Horses]]'' (1978). After an excursion into [[electronic rock]] in the early-to-mid 1980s, the band won its sole [[Grammy Award]] with the 1987 album ''[[Crest of a Knave]]''. Jethro Tull have sold an estimated 60&nbsp;million albums worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jethrotull.com/ian-andersons-homo-erraticus-to-be-released-on-14th-april/ |title=Ian Anderson's 'Homo Erraticus' to be released on 14 April |publisher=Official Jethro Tull website |accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref> with 11 gold and five platinum albums among them.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/304588/jethro-tull/biography |title=Jethro Tull&nbsp;\u2013 Biography |magazine=Billboard.com |accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref> They have been described by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as \"one of the most commercially successful and eccentric progressive rock bands\".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/jethro-tull/biography |title=Jethro Tull Biography |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe last works as a group to contain new material were released in 2003, though the band continued to tour until 2011.

The compilation ''[[50 for 50]]'' was released in 2018.\n\nThe reformed group\u2014now billed as \"Ian Anderson and the Jethro Tull band\"\u2014still performs live, and has announced tour dates into 2020.  The current band line-up includes musicians who have been members of Anderson's solo band since 2012.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n[[Ian Anderson]], [[Jeffrey Hammond]] and [[John Evan]] (originally Evans), who would become members of Jethro Tull, attended [[grammar school]] together in [[Blackpool]]. Anderson was born in [[Dunfermline]], [[Scotland]] and grew up in [[Edinburgh]] before moving to Blackpool in January 1960.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=4}} Evans had become a fan of [[the Beatles]] after seeing them play \"[[Love Me Do]]\" on [[Granada Television]]'s ''Scene at 6:30''. Though he was an accomplished pianist, he decided to take up the drums, as it was an instrument featured in the Beatles' line-up.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=5\u20136}} Anderson had acquired a [[Classical guitar|Spanish guitar]] and taught himself how to play it, and the pair decided to form a band.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=7}} The pair recruited Hammond on bass, who brought along his collection of [[blues music|blues]] records to listen to.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=8}}\n\nThe group initially played as a three piece at local clubs and venues, before Evans became influenced by [[Georgie Fame]] and [[the Animals]] and switched to organ, recruiting drummer [[Barriemore Barlow|Barrie Barlow]]{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=14\u201315}} and guitarist Mike Stephens from local band the Atlantics.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=12}}{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=12}} By 1964 the band had recruited guitarist Chris Riley{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=12}} and developed into a six-piece [[blue-eyed soul]] band called the John Evan Band (later the John Evan Smash). Evans had shortened his surname to \"Evan\" at the insistence of Hammond, who thought it sounded better and more unusual. The group recruited Johnny Taylor as a booking agent and played gigs further afield around northwest England,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=15}} playing a mixture of blues and [[Motown]] covers.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=14}} Hammond subsequently quit the band to go to [[art school]].{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=15}} He was briefly replaced by Derek Ward, then by [[Glenn Cornick]].{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=17}} Riley also quit and was replaced by Neil Smith.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=17}} The group recorded three songs at Regent Sound Studios in [[Denmark Street]], London in April 1967, and appeared at [[The Marquee]] club in June.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=27}}\n\nIn November 1967, the band moved to the London area, basing themselves in [[Luton]]. They signed a management deal with Terry Ellis and Chris Wright and replaced Smith with guitarist [[Mick Abrahams]],{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=19}} but quickly realised that supporting a 6-piece band was financially impractical, and the group split up. Anderson, Abrahams and Cornick decided to stay together, recruiting Abrahams' friend [[Clive Bunker]] on drums{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=18}} and becoming a [[British blues]] band.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=26}} Cornick recalled that although Evan left, the band said he was welcome to rejoin at a later date.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=27}} Anderson shared a ground-floor flat with Cornick in a large house at the top of Studley Road in Luton,<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/zzjul76.htm Zigzag, July 1976]</ref> and worked as a cleaner for the Luton Ritz Cinema to pay the rent.<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/bbc79a.htm BBC Radio interview, March 1979]</ref> According to Cornick, \"we were so poor that we would share one can of stew or soup between us each evening.\" <ref>[https://www.psychedelicbabymag.com/2011/12/glenn-cornick-interview-about-jethro.html Psychedelic Baby Magazine, 13 December 2011] Retrieved 22 September 2019</ref>\n\n===Early years (1967\u20131968)===\nAt first, the new band had trouble getting repeat bookings and they took to changing their name frequently to continue playing the London club circuit, names which included \"Navy Blue\", \"Ian Henderson's Bag o' Nails\", and \"Candy Coloured Rain\". Anderson recalled looking at a poster at a club and concluding that the band name he didn't recognise was his.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=22}} Band names were often supplied by their booking agents' staff, one of whom, a history enthusiast, eventually christened them \"Jethro Tull\" after [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|the 18th-century agriculturist]]. The name stuck because they happened to be using it the first time a club manager liked their show enough to invite them to return.<ref name=\"billboard end\"/> They recorded a session with producer [[Derek Lawrence]], which resulted in the single \"Sunshine Day\". The B-side \"Aeroplane\" was an old John Evan Band track with the saxophones mixed out. It was released in February 1968 on [[MGM Records]], miscredited to \"Jethro Toe\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|pp=23\u201323}} Anderson has since questioned the misnomer as a way to avoid paying royalties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austindaze.com/2006/08/29/jethro-tull-ian-anderson/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108173613/http://www.austindaze.com/2006/08/29/jethro-tull-ian-anderson/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 November 2011 |title=Jethro Tull (Ian Anderson) |publisher=Austin Daze |date=29 August 2006 |accessdate=11 November 2012 }}</ref> The more common version, with the name spelled correctly, is actually a [[counterfeit]] made in New York.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dag Sandbu |url=http://www.collecting-tull.com/Collectibles/7_JethroToe.htm |title=MGM Jethro Toe |publisher=Collecting-tull.com |accessdate=11 November 2012}}</ref> Anderson later met Hammond while in London and the two renewed their friendship, while Anderson moved into a [[bedsit]] in Chelsea with Evan.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=35}} Hammond became the subject of several songs, beginning with their next single, \"A Song for Jeffrey\".{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=36}}\n\nAnderson possessed a large [[overcoat]], his father having given it to him with the words \"You'd better take this. It's going to be a cold winter\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Ballad of Jethro Tull |date=2019 |publisher=Rocket 88 |location=London |isbn=9781910978429 |page=25}}</ref> This overcoat, and slightly later on the flute, became part of his early stage image. It was around this time that Anderson purchased a flute after becoming frustrated with his inability to play guitar as well as Abrahams, and because their managers thought he should remain a rhythm guitarist, with Abrahams becoming the front man.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=24}} \n\n<blockquote>I didn't want to be just another third-rate guitar player who sounded like a bunch of other third-rate guitar players. I wanted to do something that was a bit more idiosyncratic, hence the switch to another instrument. When Jethro Tull began, I think I'd been playing the flute for about two weeks. It was a quick learning curve&nbsp;... literally every night I walked onstage was a flute lesson.<ref name=\"Newsome\">Newsome, Jim. \"Living in the Present\". Interview with Ian Anderson, 23 April 2002. [http://www.jimnewsom.com/IanAndersonInterview.html jimnewsom.com]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe group's first major break occurred at the [[National Jazz and Blues Festival]] at [[Sunbury-on-Thames]] in August 1968, where the band drew a rapturous reception and positive reviews in the music press. The band have since claimed that the success at Sunbury was a result of their persistent touring, which had generated a grassroots following who had all assembled at the festival and encouraged the rest of the audience. Cornick recalled, \"from that moment on, we were a big band\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|pp=24\u201325}}\n\nThe group recorded their first album, ''[[This Was]]'', between June and August 1968, and it was released in October, reaching number 10 in the charts.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=41,42}} In addition to original material, the album included the traditional \"Cat's Squirrel\", which highlighted Abrahams' blues-rock style, while the [[Rahsaan Roland Kirk]]-penned jazz piece \"Serenade to a Cuckoo\" gave Anderson a showcase for his growing talents on the flute.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=42}} The overall sound of the group at this time was described in the ''[[Record Mirror]]'' by Anderson in 1968 as \"a sort of progressive blues with a bit of jazz\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tullpress.com/rm12oct68.htm |title=Record Mirror, 12 October, 1968 |access-date=11 February 2007 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61DN3yU3K?url=http://www.tullpress.com/rm12oct68.htm |archive-date=26 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the album's release, Abrahams left the band in December to form his own group, [[Blodwyn Pig]].{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=43}} There were a number of reasons given for his departure. Abrahams had heard that Ellis wanted Anderson to be the frontman and group leader, at his expense, and realised he was unlikely to have the majority share in songwriting.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=37}} Other reasons given were that Abrahams was a blues purist while Anderson wanted to branch out into other forms of music, and that Abrahams was unwilling to travel internationally or play more than three nights a week.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.themarqueeclub.net/jethro-tull |title=Jethro Tull biography at themarquee.net |publisher=Themarqueeclub.net |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175356/http://www.themarqueeclub.net/jethro-tull |archivedate=19 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.squirrelmusic.com/ |title=Mick's Bio at Mick Abrahams' official website |publisher=Squirrelmusic.com |date=}}</ref> Abrahams himself described his reasons more succinctly: \"I was fed up with all the nonsense, and I wanted to form a band like Blodwyn Pig.\"<ref>Rock Guitar Daily blog. [rockguitardaily.blogspot.com/mick-abrahams]</ref>\n\nThe group tried several replacements for Abrahams. The first was [[David O'List]], who had recently left [[the Nice]]. After a week's rehearsal, O'List didn't show up and lost contact with the group. The next choice was [[Mick Taylor]], who turned the group down because he felt his current gig with [[John Mayall's Bluesbreakers]] was a better deal.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=43}} Following this, the group put an advertisement in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' which was answered by [[Tony Iommi]]. After a few rehearsals, the group appeared in ''[[The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus]]'' on 11 December. The group performed \"A Song for Jeffrey\", but only Anderson's singing and flute were live; the rest was [[mime]]d. Iommi felt closer to his old band, 'Earth' (now known as Black Sabbath), so he returned to Birmingham to rejoin them. \n\nThe next choice was [[Martin Barre]], who had seen the band perform at Sunbury,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=47}} and had been tried out at the same audition as Iommi. Barre arranged a second audition with Anderson, who showed him some new songs that were in a different style to the blues they had been recording. Anderson was impressed by Barre's technique, and offered him the job as the new guitarist.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=44}} Barre played his first gig with Jethro Tull on 30 December 1968 at the Winter Gardens, Penzance.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=30}}\n\n===''Stand Up'' through ''Aqualung'' (1969\u20131971)===\nAfter Barre joined, the group did a few shows supporting [[Jimi Hendrix]] in Scandinavia,{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=49}} then set out on an extensive tour of the US, supporting [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Vanilla Fudge]].{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=31}} Having attracted a substantial live following, Ellis and Wright asked Anderson, who had become the dominant songwriter, to write a hit single. The result was \"[[Living in the Past (song)|Living in the Past]]\", which reached No. 3 in May on the UK singles chart and No. 11 in the US,{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=31}} and resulted in an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. Although other so-called \"serious\" groups actively resisted issuing stand-alone singles at the time, Jethro Tull felt a hit single was a positive move for the group, if not their priority.{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=32}}\n\n[[File:Jethro-Tull-9-73(2).jpg|thumb|140px|[[John Evan]], an old schoolfriend and bandmate, joined the band in April 1970, after several invitations to do so]]\nThe next album was ''[[Stand Up (Jethro Tull album)|Stand Up]]'', recorded during April\u2013May and August 1969.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=52}} It was released in September, and quickly reached No. 1 in the UK charts, the only album by the group to do so. Anderson had now established himself as the group's leader and songwriter, and wrote all of the material, aside from his jazzy rearrangement of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]]'s \"[[Bourr\u00e9e in E minor]] BWV 996 (fifth movement)\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=32}} The album cover unfolded to a photo insert of the band attached to the covers like a [[pop-up book]].\n\nImmediately after releasing ''Stand Up'', the group set off on their first headlining tour in the US, including an appearance at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]].{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=33}} Barre recalled, \"It was really the turning point for Jethro Tull\u2014for everything that we were to become and everything we were to inspire in others.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tullpress.com/gwjun99.htm |title=Guitar World, June, 1999 |access-date=17 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311053104/http://www.tullpress.com/gwjun99.htm |archive-date=11 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The band was invited to play in the [[Woodstock 1969|Woodstock Festival]], but Anderson declined, being afraid that the band would be permanently typecast as [[hippie]]s, able to play only one musical style.<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/craug01.htm Classic Rock, August, 2001]</ref>\n\nOn 29 January 1970 the band appeared on BBC's ''Top of the Pops'' again, performing \"Witch's Promise\".<ref>{{cite web|author=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/top-of-the-pops-uk/29th-january-1970-943665/ |title=Top of the Pops (UK)&nbsp;\u2013 Season 7, Episode 5: 29th January 1970 |publisher=TV.com |date= |accessdate=30 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{youtube|-0GAuexrVzo|Jethro Tull&nbsp;\u2013 The Witches Promise}}</ref> Evan rejoined the band in early 1970. He had stayed in London since the John Evan Band broke up, living with Anderson, and began studying music at the [[University of London]]. The pair did not see much of each other because of Jethro Tull's increasing workload, and Evan was reluctant to rejoin because of his studies, which gave him access to a free studio.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=65}} He played as a [[session musician]] on the next album, ''[[Benefit (album)|Benefit]]'' (1970), following which Anderson said they needed somebody to play the keyboard parts on tour. His tutor eventually persuaded him that it was a good idea, and Evan formally joined.{{sfn|Rees|1998|pp=36,37}} The album reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 11 in the US,{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=186}} and allowed the group to sell out 20,000-seat arenas, establishing themselves as a premier live act.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/jethro-tull/biography |title=Jethro Tull Biography |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=28 June 2013}}</ref> In August, the band played to one of their largest audiences at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|1970 Isle of Wight festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/nothing-is-easy-live-at-the-isle-of-wight-1970-dvd-mw0001016771|title=Nothing Is Easy : Live at the Isle of Wight 1970|first=Bruce|last=Eder|website=AllMusic|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Isle of Wight appearance was followed by another US tour, following which Cornick left the band.

The album was split into two sides, subtitled 'Aqualung' and 'My God', and featured Anderson's opinions about organised religion.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=76}} Recording the album was problematic because of technical issues in the studio and Hammond's rusty musical skills.

On a \"banter\" track that accompanies the 2005 ''Aqualung Live'' album recorded for [[XM Satellite Radio]], Anderson insisted, \"I always said at the time, this is not a concept album. It's an album of varied songs...in which three or four are kind of the keynote pieces for the album, but it doesn't make it a concept album.\"\n\nIn response to the many critics who called ''Aqualung'' a concept album, Anderson decided to \"come up with something that really is the mother of all concept albums\".{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=48}} He had become influenced by [[Monty Python]]'s humour, and wrote a suite that combined complex musical ideas with a sense of humour to make fun of the band, its audience and its critics.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|pp=84,85}} The album, released in 1972, became ''[[Thick as a Brick]]'', which was co-credited to a fictional schoolboy, [[Gerald Bostock]].{{sfn|Rees|1998|p=48}} It consisted of a single track running over 43 minutes, split over two sides, which was uncommon for rock albums.{{sfn|Smith|1997|p=113}} Although the finished album was a continuous piece of music, it was written and recorded in stages, with the whole band helping with the arrangements.{{sfn|Nollen|2002|p=83}} ''Thick as a Brick'' was the first Tull album to reach number one on the (US) Billboard Pop Albums chart{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=82}} with the following year's ''[[A Passion Play]]'' being the only other to do so.<ref>{{AllMusic |class=album|id=r10373|tab=charts-awards|label=Billboard chart info ''A Passion Play''|accessdate=16 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jethro-Tull-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Ian Anderson and Martin Barre of Jethro Tull in Chicago, 1973]]\n\n1972 also saw the release of ''[[Living in the Past (album)|Living in the Past]]'', a double-[[compilation album|album compilation]] of remixed singles, [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]s and outtakes (including the entirety of the ''Life Is a Long Song'' EP, which closes the album),{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=87}} with the third side recorded live in 1970 at New York's [[Carnegie Hall]] concert on 4 November 1970.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=67}} The album was successful, as it allowed new fans to catch up with early singles, particularly in the US where they had not been popular on initial release.{{sfn|Rabey|2013|p=87}} ''[[New Musical Express]]'' called Jethro Tull one of \"Britain's most important and successful 2nd generation progressive bands\".<ref>[http://www.tullpress.com/nme1jul72.htm NME, 1 July, 1972]</ref>\n\nIn 1973, while in [[tax exile]], the band attempted to produce a double album at France's [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]] studios, something [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[Elton John]] among others were doing at the time, but supposedly they were unhappy with the quality of the recording studio and abandoned the effort, subsequently mocking the studio as the \"Chateau d'Isaster\". They returned to England, and Anderson did some rewriting before Jethro Tull quickly recorded and released ''[[A Passion Play]]'' (1973), another single-track concept album, with allegorical lyrics focusing on the afterlife. Like ''Thick as a Brick'', ''A Passion Play'' contained instrumentation rather uncommon in rock music. The album also featured an eccentric interlude, \"The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles\", which was co-written (along with Anderson and Evan) and narrated by bassist Hammond.  ''A Passion Play'' sold well but received generally poor reviews, including a particularly damning review of its live performance by Chris Welch of ''[[Melody Maker]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tullpress.com/mm30jun73.htm |title=Melody Maker, 30 June, 1973 |access-date=19 June 2006 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/61DN4r5MA?url=http://www.tullpress.com/mm30jun73.htm |archive-date=26 August 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEven as the band's popularity with critics began to wane around this time, their popularity with the public remained strong, as evidenced by high sales of their follow-up album, 1974's ''[[War Child (album)|War Child]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=16870 |title=\"Bungle in the Jungle by Jethro Tull\" at |publisher=Songfacts.com |date=}}</ref> Originally intended to be a companion piece for a film, it reached number two on the US [[Billboard charts]] and received some critical acclaim, and produced the radio mainstays \"[[Bungle in the Jungle]]\" (#12 on the US singles chart) and \"[[Skating Away on the Thin Ice of the New Day]]\". It also included a short [[Acoustic music|acoustic song]], \"Only Solitaire\", widely thought to be aimed at ''L.A. Times'' rock music critic [[Robert Hilburn]], who had written a harsh review of the ''A Passion Play'' concerts at the [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]]. However, Anderson said the song was written before Hilburn's review and was aimed at music critics in general. The ''War Child'' tour also featured a female [[string quartet]] playing along with the group on the new material.\n\nIn 1975, the band released ''[[Minstrel in the Gallery]]'', an album which resembled ''Aqualung'' (1971) in that it contrasted softer, acoustic-guitar-based pieces with lengthier, more bombastic works headlined by Barre's electric guitar. Written and recorded during Anderson's divorce from his first wife [[Jennie Franks]], the album is characterised by a markedly more introspective tone than their previous album, and critics gave it mixed reviews.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} By this point Jethro Tull had been awarded six [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] gold records for sales of ''Stand Up'' (1969), ''Aqualung'' (1971), ''Thick as a Brick'' (1972), ''Living in the Past'' (1972), ''A Passion Play'' (1973), and ''Minstrel in the Gallery'' (1975).{{sfn|Murrells|1978|p=295}} For the 1975 tour, [[Dee Palmer|David Palmer]], who had long been the band's orchestra arranger, officially joined the band's stage show on keyboards and synthesisers. In February 1975 Jethro Tull sold out five nights at the 20,000-seat [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|Los Angeles Forum]], prompting ''Melody Maker'' to run the headline \"Jethro&nbsp;\u2013 Now The World's Biggest Band?\"<ref name=\"jethrotull.com\">{{cite web|url=http://jethrotull.com/minstrel-in-the-gallery/ |title=Minstrel in the Gallery |publisher=Jethro Tull |date=5 September 1975}}</ref> After the tour, bassist Hammond quit the band to pursue painting. [[John Glascock]], who earlier was playing with [[flamenco]]-rock band [[Carmen (rock band)|Carmen]], a support band on the previous Jethro Tull tour, became the band's new bassist.\n\n1976's ''[[Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die!]]'' was another concept album, this time about the life of an ageing rocker. Glascock made his first appearance on this album, contributing harmony and second vocals in addition to the bass lines. Palmer continued to arrange, and he recorded as a guest on two songs. For the 1976 tour, Jethro Tull became one of the first bands to use giant projection screens for the larger stadium shows.<ref name=\"jethrotull.com\"/> Although ''Too Old...'' did not sell as well as the other 1970s albums, the 1976 compilation ''[[M.U. - The Best of Jethro Tull]]'', achieved Platinum Album in US and Gold record in UK. A television special was recorded showing the development of the album's concept in a live show with the band (fully dressed in the most rock-hard-tongue-in-cheek outfits), but the programme was never officially released.\n\n===Folk rock (1977\u20131979)===\n[[File:Jethro Tull 5.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ian Anderson]] playing with Jethro Tull, [[Hammersmith Odeon]], March 1978]]\nIn the late 1970s, Jethro Tull released a trio of [[folk rock]] albums, ''[[Songs from the Wood]]'' (1977), ''[[Heavy Horses]]'' (1978), and ''[[Stormwatch (album)|Stormwatch]]'' (1979). ''Songs from the Wood'' (1977) was the first Tull album to receive generally positive reviews since the release of ''Living in the Past'' (1972).\n\nThe band had long ties to folk rockers [[Steeleye Span]] (Tull were the backing band on Steeleye Span front woman [[Maddy Prior]]'s 1978 solo album ''[[Woman in the Wings]]'' as a way of repaying her for contributing vocals on the ''Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die!'' album) and with [[Fairport Convention]] (Fairport members [[Dave Pegg]], [[Martin Allcock]], [[Dave Mattacks]] and Ric Sanders have all played with Tull at one point or another, as well as folk drummer [[Gerry Conway (musician)|Gerry Conway]] who became a Fairport member after playing with Tull). Although not formally considered a part of the folk rock movement (which had actually begun nearly a decade earlier with the advent of [[Fairport Convention]]), there was clearly an exchange of musical ideas among Tull and the folk rockers.<ref name=\"ArtistWiki\" /> By this time, Anderson had moved to a farm in the countryside, and his new bucolic lifestyle was clearly reflected in his songwriting, as in the title track of ''[[Heavy Horses]]'' (1978), a paean to [[Draft horse|draught horses]].\n\nThe band continued to tour, and released a live double album in 1978, titled ''[[Bursting Out]]'', which was recorded during the European leg of the ''Heavy Horses'' tour. During the US leg of this tour, John Glascock suffered health problems and was replaced by Anderson's friend and former [[Stealers Wheel]] bassist, [[Tony Williams (English musician)|Tony Williams]].\n\nTheir third folk influenced album, ''[[Stormwatch (album)|Stormwatch]]'', was released in 1979.  During the making of the album, Glascock suffered major health issues related to open heart surgery from the previous year, so Anderson played bass on much of the album.  After the release of ''Stormwatch'', due to Glascock's continued health issues, Fairport Convention bassist [[Dave Pegg]] was hired for the ensuing tour, during which Glascock died from heart complications at his home in England.<ref>\"A Tull Tale: Groovemaker in Jon Noyce\".

Different stories have been given over the years for the various reasons behind the band's restructuring, including that Barlow was depressed and withdrawn after Glascock's death and that Evan and Palmer found their futures in the band to be murky with Anderson's announcement that he wanted to work on a solo album. \nIn the 2008 Classic Artists documentary ''Jethro Tull: Their Fully Authorised Story'', Barlow claimed that he left the band on a mutual agreement with Anderson while Evan and Palmer both recalled being dismissed by a letter in the mail, with no prior contact.<ref>{{cite AV media| people = Al-Issawi, Omar (Director)| title = Jethro Tull: Their Fully Authorised Story | medium = DVD| publisher = Classic Artists| location = United Kingdom| date = 2008 }}</ref> \nFollowing their termination from Jethro Tull, Evan and Palmer briefly collaborated in a classical-based pop/rock band called Tallis.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://prod.whinc.net/tullrevision/musicians/pastmembers/johnevan.html| title=Past Members-John Evan| work=prod.whinc.net| accessdate=23 May 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523230652/http://prod.whinc.net/tullrevision/musicians/pastmembers/johnevan.html| archive-date=23 May 2014| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> Jethro Tull was left with Anderson (the only original member), Martin Barre and Dave Pegg.\n\nTull's first album of the 1980s was intended to be Ian Anderson's first solo album. Anderson retained Barre on electric guitar and Pegg on bass, while adding [[Mark Craney]] on drums, and special guest keyboardist/violinist [[Eddie Jobson]] (ex\u2013[[Roxy Music]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[Curved Air]] and [[U.K. (band)|U.K.]], the last of which had opened for several shows on Tull's ''Stormwatch'' tour). Highlighted by the prominent use of synthesisers, it contrasted sharply with the established \"Tull sound\".  After pressure from [[Chrysalis Records]], Anderson agreed to release it as a Jethro Tull album. Entitled ''[[A (Jethro Tull album)|A]]'' (taken from the labels on the master tapes for his scrapped solo album, marked simply \"A\" for \"Anderson\"), it was released in mid-1980.\n\nIn keeping with the mood of innovation surrounding the album, Jethro Tull developed a music video titled ''[[Slipstream (video)|Slipstream]]''.<ref>[http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v26124 ''Slipstream'' at allmovie.com] Retrieved 3 September 2014.</ref> Four staged and separately filmed music videos are mixed with concert footage from the ''A'' tour. London's [[HMV Hammersmith Apollo|Hammersmith Odeon]] was used for exterior scenes, but the main concert footage was actually from an American performance in Los Angeles, at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena|Los Angeles Sports Arena]] (as heard on the Magic Piper ROIO), filmed in November 1980. The video, released in 1981, was directed by [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]], who has directed numerous music videos, including the pioneering \"[[Ashes to Ashes (David Bowie song)|Ashes to Ashes]]\" video for [[David Bowie]].\n\nJobson and Craney returned to their own work following the ''A'' tour and Jethro Tull entered a period of revolving drummers: [[Gerry Conway (musician)|Gerry Conway]], who left after deciding he couldn't be the one to replace Barlow {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}, [[Phil Collins]] (as a fill-in for the recently departed Gerry Conway, played with the band at the first [[The Prince's Trust|Prince's Trust]] concert in 1982), [[Paul Burgess (musician)|Paul Burgess]] (for the US leg of the Broadsword and the Beast tour, and who left to settle down with his family) and permanent drummer [[Doane Perry]].\n\n1981 was the first year in their career that the band did not release an album; however, some recording sessions took place (Anderson, Barre, Pegg, and Conway, with Anderson playing the keyboards). Some of these tracks were released on the ''[[Nightcap (album)|Nightcap]]'' compilation in 1993.\n\nIn 1982, [[Peter-John Vettese]] joined on keyboards, and the band returned to a somewhat folkier sound\u2014albeit with synthesisers\u2014for 1982's ''[[The Broadsword and the Beast]]''. The ensuing concert tour for the album was well attended and the shows featured what was to be one of the group's last indulgences in full-dress theatricality. The stage was built to resemble a [[Longship|Viking longship]] and the band performed in faux-medieval regalia.\n\nAn Anderson solo album, which was in fact a collaborative Anderson-Vettese effort, appeared in 1983, in the form of the heavily electronic ''[[Walk into Light]]''.  As with later solo efforts by Anderson and Barre, some of the ''Walk into Light'' songs\u2014such as \"Fly by Night\", \"Made in England\" and \"Different Germany\"\u2014later made their way into Jethro Tull live sets.\n\nIn 1984, Jethro Tull released ''[[Under Wraps (Jethro Tull album)|Under Wraps]]'', a heavily electronic album with no \"live\" drummer and instead, as on ''Walk into Light'', a drum-machine was used. Although the band were reportedly proud of the sound, the album was not well received.  However, the video for \"Lap of Luxury\" did manage to earn moderate rotation on the newly influential [[MTV]] music video channel.  As a result of the throat problems Anderson developed singing the demanding ''Under Wraps'' material on tour, Jethro Tull took a three-year break. Vettese quit the band after the tour, angry at critics for the bad reviews of ''The Broadsword and the Beast'' (1982), ''Walk into Light'' (1983), and ''Under Wraps'' (1984).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.isbuc.co.uk/People/IanAnd.htm| title=Ian Anderson| author=Isle of Skye Business Community| accessdate=22 April 2007}}</ref> During this hiatus, Anderson continued to oversee the salmon farm he had founded in 1978, although the single \"Coronach\" was released in the UK in 1986 after it was used as the theme tune for a Channel 4 television program called \"Blood of the British\".\n\n===Anderson, Barre, Pegg and Perry: the \"hard rock\" Tull (1987\u20131994)===\nJethro Tull returned in 1987 with ''[[Crest of a Knave]]''. With Vettese absent (Anderson contributed the synth programming) and the band relying more heavily on Barre's electric guitar than they had since the early 1970s, the album was a critical and commercial success. Shades of their earlier electronic excursions were still present, however, as three of the album's songs again used a drum machine, with Doane Perry and Gerry Conway sharing drum duties on the other tracks. Prior to the ''Crest of a Knave'' tour, keyboardist [[Don Airey]] (ex-[[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Michael Schenker Group]]) joined the band.\n\nThe band won the 1988 [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental]], beating the favorite [[Metallica]] and their ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]'' album. The award was particularly controversial as many did not consider Jethro Tull hard rock, much less heavy metal. On the advice of their manager, who told them they had no chance of winning, no one from the band attended the award ceremony.<ref name=\"ArtistWiki\">{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Jethro+Tull/+wiki |title=Artist Wiki: Jethro Tull |publisher=Last.fm |date=26 November 2013}}</ref> In response to the criticism they received over the award, their label, Chrysalis, took out an advertisement in a British music periodical with a picture of a flute lying amid a pile of iron re-bar and the line, \"the flute is a heavy metal instrument.\" In response to an interview question about the controversy, Ian Anderson quipped, \"Well, we do sometimes play our mandolins very loudly.\" In 2007, the win was named one of the ten biggest upsets in Grammy history by [[Entertainment Weekly]].<ref>{{cite web| title=Grammy's 10 Biggest Upsets| work=Entertainment Weekly| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,1567466_20010834_20010795_0,00.html| accessdate=13 February 2007}}</ref> In 1992, when Metallica finally won the Grammy in the category, Metallica drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] joked, \"First thing we're going to do is thank Jethro Tull for not putting out an album this year\", a play on a Grammy comment by [[Paul Simon]] some years before thanking [[Stevie Wonder]] for the same thing.\n\nThe style of ''[[Crest of a Knave]]'' (1987) has been compared to that of [[Dire Straits]], in part because Anderson no longer seemed to have the vocal range he once possessed and preferred to use the lower registers, while Martin Barre's guitar sound apparently drifted towards [[Mark Knopfler]]'s style. Two songs in particular\u2014\"Farm on the Freeway\" and \"Steel Monkey\"\u2014got heavy radio airplay. The album also contained the popular live song \"Budapest\", which depicts a backstage scene with a shy local female stagehand. Although \"Budapest\" was the longest song on that album (at just over ten minutes), \"Mountain Men\" became more famous in Europe, depicting a scene from World War II in Africa. Ian Anderson referred to the battles of [[Second Battle of El Alamein|El Alamein]] and the [[Falkland Islands]], drawing historical parallels of the angst that women left behind by their warrior husbands might have felt: {{quote|died in the trenches at El Alamein,<br />died in the Falklands on TV}}\n\nThey toured this album with \"The Not Quite the World, More the Here and There Tour\". It was also the first time in the band's history that it had two electric guitar players on stage, when Anderson, albeit rarely, played rhythm guitar.\n\n1988 was notable for the release of ''[[20 Years of Jethro Tull]]'', a five-LP themed set (also released as a three-CD set, and as a truncated single CD version on ''20 Years of Jethro Tull: Highlights'') consisting largely of rarities and outtakes from throughout the band's history, as well as a variety of live and remastered tracks. It also included a booklet outlining the band's history in detail. Now out of print, it has become a collector's item, although many (but not all) of the outtakes have been included as bonus tracks on remastered releases of the band's studio albums.\n\nIn 1989, the band released ''[[Rock Island (Jethro Tull album)|Rock Island]]'', which met with less commercial and critical success than ''Crest of a Knave'' (1987). The lead-off track, \"Kissing Willie\", featured bawdy double-entendre lyrics and over-the-top heavy metal riffing that seemed to take a satiric view of the group's recent Grammy award win. The song's accompanying video found difficulty in receiving airplay because of its sexual imagery.  Although ''Rock Island'' was something of a miss for the group, a couple of fan favourites did emerge from the album. \"Big Riff and Mando\" reflects life on the road for the relentlessly touring musicians, giving a wry account of the theft of Barre's prized mandolin by a starstruck fan. \"Another Christmas Song\", an upbeat number celebrating the humanitarian spirit of the holiday season, stood out against the brooding and sombre mood of many of the songs on the album and was well received at concerts. It was re-recorded for the 2003 ''[[The Jethro Tull Christmas Album]]'' release.\n\n1991's ''[[Catfish Rising]]'' was a more solid album than ''Rock Island'' (1989). Despite being labelled as a \"return to playing the blues\", the album actually is marked by the generous use of mandolin and acoustic guitar and much less use of keyboards than any Tull album of the Eighties. Notable tracks included \"Rocks on the Road\", which highlighted gritty acoustic guitar work and hard-bitten lyrics about urban life and \"Still Loving You Tonight\", a bluesy, low-key ballad.\n\n===''Roots to Branches'' and ''J-Tull.com'': the world music influences (1995\u20132000)===\n[[File:Jethro tull - Jerusalem 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jethro Tull performing in [[Jerusalem]], 2007]]\n\nFollowing a further, semi-acoustic 1992 tour (which included [[Dave Mattacks]] but not [[Andrew Giddings|Andy Giddings]], and which was documented with ''[[A Little Light Music]]'', the band's second official live album), Anderson relearned how to play the flute (after his daughter, who took up flute classes at school, discovered that her father often used the wrong fingering)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jethro-tull.com/musicians/iananderson/equipment.html |title=Ian Anderson's Equipment&nbsp;\u2013 The Official Jethro Tull Website |publisher=Jethro-tull.com |accessdate=6 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713103527/http://jethro-tull.com/musicians/iananderson/equipment.html |archive-date=13 July 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and began writing songs that heavily featured world music influences. However, the first Tull releases containing the \"relearned\" flute were the 1993 ''[[25th Anniversary Box Set]]'' which, as well as the remixes of classic songs and unreleased live material, included a whole CD of old songs from the band's entire career recorded by the current line-up, and the 1993 ''[[Nightcap (album)|Nightcap]]'' compilation album containing unreleased studio material (mainly from the scrapped pre-''A Passion Play'' album), with multiple flute parts re-recorded.\n\nPrior to the recording of 1995's ''[[Roots to Branches]]'' album, longstanding bass player Dave Pegg left the band, wishing to concentrate on Fairport Convention and not being keen on the world-music direction the band chose. Doane Perry (returning as the band's full-time drummer) recruited his friend and widely respected session bass player [[Steve Bailey]] to fill the gap: Ian Anderson, in turn, relinquished control of the rhythm section arrangements on that record, leaving them completely to Bailey and Perry. Despite his studio contributions, however, Bailey did not join the band, and Pegg's formal replacement as Jethro Tull bassist was [[Jonathan Noyce]].\n\n''Roots to Branches'' (1995) and 1999's ''[[J-Tull Dot Com]]'' were less rock-based than ''Crest of a Knave'' (1987) or ''Catfish Rising'' (1991). Songs on these albums reflect the musical influences of decades of performing all around the globe. In songs such as \"Out of the Noise\" and \"Hot Mango Flush\", Anderson paints vivid pictures of third-world street scenes. These albums reflected Anderson's coming to grips with being an old rocker, with songs such as the pensive \"Another Harry's Bar\", \"Wicked Windows\" (a meditation on reading glasses), and the gruff \"Wounded, Old and Treacherous\".\n\n===Live albums, world tours and ''The Jethro Tull Christmas Album'' (2001\u20132010)===\nIn January 2002, the original lineup of the band (including Anderson, Abrahams, Cornick and Bunker) reunited for a one-off pub performance in England that was filmed for inclusion in the ''Living with the Past'' DVD.  It was the first and only time the original four members had played together since 1968, as well as the only time a former Tull lineup has ever reunited.\n\n2003 saw the release of ''[[The Jethro Tull Christmas Album]]'', a collection of traditional Christmas songs together with old and new Christmas songs written by Jethro Tull. It is the last studio album of this band. It became the band's biggest commercial success since the 1987 ''Crest of a Knave''. An Ian Anderson live double album and DVD was released in 2005 called ''[[Ian Anderson Plays the Orchestral Jethro Tull]]''. In addition, a DVD entitled ''[[Nothing Is Easy: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970]]'' and a live album ''[[Aqualung Live]]'' (recorded in 2004) were released in 2005.\n\n2006 saw the release of a dual boxed set DVD ''Collector's Edition'', containing two DVDs\u2014''[[Nothing Is Easy: Live at the Isle of Wight 1970]]'' and ''[[Living with the Past]]''. Bassist Jon Noyce left the band in March 2006. Keyboardist [[Andrew Giddings]] quit the band in July 2006, citing constant touring allowing not enough time for family. They were replaced by [[David Goodier]] and [[John O'Hara (musician)|John O'Hara]] respectively. In the following year ''[[The Best of Acoustic Jethro Tull]]'', a 24-song set of Tull's and Ian Anderson's acoustic performances taken from various albums, was released. Included are a new live acoustic version of \"One Brown Mouse\" and a live performance of the traditional song (attributed to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]), \"[[Pastime with Good Company]]\".\n\nIn September 2007, Jethro Tull released CD/DVD ''[[Live at Montreux 2003 (Jethro Tull album)|Live at Montreux 2003]]''. The concert was recorded on 4 July 2003 and featured, among others, \"Fat Man\", \"With You There to Help Me\" and \"Hunting Girl\", with the longest unchanged line-up: Anderson, Barre, Perry, Noyce and Giddings.\n\nIn February 2010, the band were commemorated with a [[Heritage Award]] by [[PRS for Music]].

Using the term ''sex worker'' rather than ''prostitute'' also allows more members of the sex industry to be represented and helps ensure that sex workers are not singled out and associated with the negative connotations of ''prostitute.'' In addition, choosing to use the term ''sex worker'' rather than ''prostitute'' shows ownership over the individuals' career choice. Some argue that those who prefer the term ''sex worker'' wish to separate their occupation from their person. Describing someone as a sex worker recognizes that the individual may have many different facets, and are not necessarily defined by their job.\n\nAccording to one view, [[sex work]] is different from [[sexual exploitation]], or the forcing of a person to commit sexual acts, in that sex work is voluntary \"and is seen as the commercial exchange of sex for money or goods\".<ref name=Burnes>{{cite book |last1=Burnes |first1=Theodore R. |editor1-last=Nadal |editor1-first=Kevin L. |title=The SAGE Encyclopedia of Psychology and Gender |date=2017 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |pages=1467\u20131470 |chapter=Sex Work|doi=10.4135/9781483384269.n494|isbn=9781483384283 }}</ref> In an attempt to further clarify the broad term that ''sex work'' is, John E.

For example, while pornography is legal in the United States, prostitution is illegal in most parts of the US. However, in other regions of the world, both pornography and prostitution are illegal; in others, both are legal. One example of a country in which pornography, prostitution, and all professions encompassed under the umbrella of sex work are all legal is New Zealand. Under the Prostitution Reform Act of New Zealand, laws and regulations have been put into place in order to ensure the safety and protection of its sex workers. For example, since the implementation of the Prostitution Reform Act, \"any person seeking to open a larger brothel, where more than four sex workers will be working requires a Brothel Operators Certificate, which certifies them as a suitable person to exercise control over sex workers in the workplace.

In one study, women involved in sex work were interviewed and asked if they thought it should be made legal. They answered that they thought it should not, as it would put women at higher risk from violent customers if it were considered legitimate work, and they would not want their friends or family entering the sex industry to earn money. Another argument is that legalizing sex work would increase the demand for it, and women should not be treated as sexual merchandise. A study showed that in countries that have legalized prostitution, there was an increase in child prostitution. An argument against legalizing sex work is to keep children from being involved in this industry. The studies also showed that legalizing sex work lead to an increase in sex trafficking, which is another reason people give for making sex work illegal.<ref name=\"Janice G.

One major argument for legalizing prostitution is that women should have a right to do what they want with their own bodies. The government should not have a say in what they do for work, and if they want to sell their bodies it is their own decision. Another common argument for legalizing prostitution is that enforcing prostitution laws is a waste of money. This is because prostitution has always, and will continue to persist despite whatever laws and regulations are implemented against it. In arguing for the decriminalization of sex work, the Minister of Justice of the Netherlands expanded upon this argument in court when stating that, \"prostitution has existed for a long time and will continue to do so\u2026Prohibition is not the way to proceed\u2026One should allow for voluntary prostitution. The authorities can then regulate prostitution, [and] it can become healthy, safe, transparent, and cleansed from criminal side-effects.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Weitzer|first1=Ronald John|title=Legalizing Prostitution: From Illicit Vice to Lawful Business|year=2012|publisher=NYU Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ercUCgAAQBAJ|isbn=9780814794630}}</ref> People who wish to legalize prostitution do not see enforcing laws against sex work as effective and think the money is better spent elsewhere. Many people also argue that legalization of prostitution will lead to less harm for the sex workers. They argue that the decriminalization of sex work will decrease the exploitation of sex workers by third parties such as pimps and managers. A final argument for the legalization of sex work is that prostitution laws are unconstitutional. Some argue that these laws go against people's rights to free speech, privacy, etc.{{sfn|Weitzer|1991}}\n\n== Risk reduction ==\nRisk reduction in sex work is a highly debated topic. \"Abolitionism\" and \"nonabolitionism\" or \"empowerment\" are regarded as opposing ways in which risk reduction is approached.<ref name=\"Traffic Violations\">{{cite journal|last=Saunders|first=Penelope|title=Traffic Violations: Determining the Meaning of Violence in Sexual Trafficking versus Sex Work|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|date=March 2005|volume=20|issue=3|pages=343\u2013360|url=http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Migration%20studies/Determining%20the%20meaning%20of%20violence%20in%20sexual%20trafficking%20versus%20sex%20work%20Saunders%20J%20Interpers%20Viol%202005%2020(3)%20343-360.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120915113821/http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Migration%20studies/Determining%20the%20meaning%20of%20violence%20in%20sexual%20trafficking%20versus%20sex%20work%20Saunders%20J%20Interpers%20Viol%202005%2020(3)%20343-360.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-09-15|accessdate=24 April 2014|doi=10.1177/0886260504272509|pmid=15684141|df=}}</ref>  While abolitionism would call for an end to all sex work, empowerment would encourage the formation of networks among sex workers and enable them to prevent STIs and other health risks by communicating with each other.<ref name=\"Reframing Sex Worker Health\">{{cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Joseph|author2=Astrid Tuminez|title=Reframing the Interpretation of Sex Worker Health: A Behavioral\u2013Structural Approach|journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=204|issue=5|pages=S1206\u201310|doi=10.1093/infdis/jir534|pmid=22043033|url=http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/204/suppl_5/S1206.short|accessdate=14 March 2014|pmc=3205084}}</ref> Both approaches aim to reduce rates of disease and other negative effects of sex work.\n\nIn addition, sex workers themselves have disputed the dichotomous nature of abolitionism and nonabolitionism, advocating instead a focus on sex workers' rights.

They face biological, personal, relational, and structural risks that all increase their chances of getting HIV. Biological factors include incorrect condom usage because of erectile dysfunction from hormones taken to become more feminine and receptive anal intercourse without a condom which is a high risk for developing HIV. Personal factors include mental health issues that lead to increased sexual risk, such as anxiety, depression, and substance abuse provoked through lack of support, violence, etc. Structural risks include involvement in sex work being linked to poverty, substance abuse, and other factors that are more prevalent in transgender women based on their tendency to be socially marginalized and not accepted for challenging gender norms. The largest risk for HIV is unprotected sex with male partners, and studies have been emerging that show men who have sex with transgender women are more likely to use drugs than men that do not.<ref name=\"Tonia Potiat - HIV risk and preventive interventions in transgender women sex workers\">{{cite journal|last=Potiat|first=Tonia|title=HIV risk and preventive interventions in transgender women sex workers|journal=The Lancet|date=January 23, 2015|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60833-3|pmid=25059941|volume=385|issue=9964|pages=274\u2013286|pmc=4320978}}</ref>\n\nCondom use is one way to mitigate the risk of contracting an STI. However, negotiating condom use with one's clients and partners is often an obstacle to practicing safer sex.

Brothels with strong workplace health practices, including the availability of condoms, have also increased condom use among their workers.<ref name=\"Violence + Condom Negotiation\" />\n\n'''''Health Concerns of Exotic Dancers'''''<br>''Mental Health and Stigma''<br>In order to protect themselves from the stigma of sex work, many dancers resort to othering themselves. Othering involves constructing oneself as superior to one's peers, and the dancer persona provides an internal boundary that separates the \"authentic\" from the stripper self. This practice creates a lot of stress for the dancers, in turn leading many to resort to using drugs and alcohol to cope. Since it is so widespread, the use of drugs has become normalized in the exotic dance scene.<br>Despite this normalization, passing as nonusers, or covering as users of less maligned drugs, is necessary. This is because strippers concurrently attribute a strong moral constitution to those that resist the drug atmosphere; it is a testament to personal strength and will power. It is also an occasion for dancers to \"other\" fellow strippers. Valorizing resistance to the drug space discursively positions \"good\" strippers against such a drug locale and indicates why dancers are motivated to closet hard drug use.<br>Stigma causes strippers to hide their lifestyles from friends and family alienating themselves from a support system. Further, the stress of trying to hide their lifestyles from others due to fear of scrutiny affects the mental health of dancers. Stigma is a difficult area to address because it is more abstract, but it would be helpful to work toward normalizing sex work as a valid way of making a living. This normalization of sex work would relieve the stress many dancers experience increasing the likelihood that they will be open about their work. Being open will allow them access to a viable support system and reduce the othering and drug use so rampant in the sex industry.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tyndale | first1 = Maticka | year = 2000 | title = Exotic dancing and health | url = | journal = Women & Health | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 87\u2013108 | doi=10.1300/j013v31n01_06| pmid = 11005222 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Barton | first1 = B | year = 2007 | title = Managing the toll of stripping boundary setting among exotic dancers | url = | journal = Journal of Contemporary Ethnography | volume = 36 | issue = 5| page = 571 | doi=10.1177/0891241607301971}}</ref>\n\n=== Forced sex work ===\n{{see also|Sexual slavery|Sex trafficking}}\nForced sex work is when an individual enters into any sex trade due to coercion rather than by choice.

Each year in London [[Sexual Freedom Awards|The Sexual Freedom Awards]] is held to honor the most notable advocates and pioneers of sexual freedom and sex workers' rights in the UK, where sex work is essentially legal.\n\n=== Unionization of sex work ===\nThe unionization of sex workers is a recent development. The first organization within the contemporary sex workers' rights movement was Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics ([[COYOTE]]), founded in 1973 in San Francisco, California. Many organizations in Western countries were established in the decade after the founding of COYOTE.<ref name=\"sex worker unionisation Gall\" />  Currently, a small number of sex worker unions exist worldwide. One of the largest is the International Union of Sex Workers, headquartered in the United Kingdom. The IUSW advocates for the rights of all sex workers, whether they chose freely or were coerced to enter the trade, and promotes policies that benefit the interests of sex workers both in the UK and abroad.<ref name=\"IUSW: Who We Are\">{{cite web|title=IUSW: Who We Are|url=http://www.iusw.org/iusw-who-we-are/|publisher=International Union of Sex Workers|accessdate=15 March 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315075748/http://www.iusw.org/iusw-who-we-are/|archivedate=15 March 2014|df=}}</ref> Many regions are home to sex worker unions, including Latin America, Brazil, Canada, Europe, and Africa.<ref name=\"Sex worker organizations around the world\">{{cite web|title=Sex Worker Rights Organizations and Projects Around the World|url=http://www.bayswan.org/orgs.html|publisher=Prostitutes' Education Network}}</ref>\n\nIn unionizing, many sex workers face issues relating to communication and to the legality of sex work. Because sex work is illegal in many places where they wish to organize, it is difficult to communicate with other sex workers in order to organize. There is also concern with the legitimacy of sex work as a career and an activity that merits formal organizing, largely because of the sexism often present in sex work and the devaluation of sex work as not comparable to other paid labor and employment.<ref name=\"sex worker unionisation Gall\"/>\n\nA factor affecting the unionization of sex work is that many sex workers belong to populations that historically have not had a strong representation in labor unions. While this unionization can be viewed as a way of empowering sex workers and granting them agency within their profession, it is also criticized as implicitly lending its approval to sexism and power imbalances already present in sex work. Unionization also implies a submission to or operation within the systems of capitalism, which is of concern to some feminists.<ref name=\"sex worker unionisation Gall\">{{cite journal|last=Gall|first=Gregor|title=Sex worker unionisation: an exploratory study of emerging collective organisation|journal=Industrial Relations Journal|date=1 January 2007|volume=38|issue=1|pages=70\u201388|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2338.2007.00436.x}}</ref>\n\n====Unionizing exotic dancers====\n''Independent contractor vs Employee''<br>Performers in general are problematic to categorize because they often exercise a high level of control over their work product, one characteristic of an independent contractor. Additionally, their work can be artistic in nature and often done on a freelance basis. Often, the work of performers does not possess the obvious attributes of employees such as regular working hours, places or duties. Consequently, employers misclassify them because they are unsure of their workers' status, or they purposely misclassify them to take advantage of independent contractors' low costs. Exotic dance clubs are one such employer that purposely misclassify their performers as independent contractors.\n\nThere are additional hurdles in terms of self-esteem and commitment to unionize. On the most basic level, dancers themselves must have the desire to unionize for collective action. For those who wish not to conform to group activity or want to remain independent, a union may seem as controlling as club management since joining a union would obligate them to pay dues and abide by decisions made through majority vote, with or without their personal approval.\n\nIn the ''Lusty Lady'' case study, this strip club was the first all-woman-managed club to successfully unionize in 1996. Some of the working conditions they were able to address included \"protest[ing] racist hiring practices, customers being allowed to videotape dancers without their consent via one-way mirrors, inconsistent disciplinary policies, lack of health benefits, and an overall dearth of job security\".  Unionizing exotic dancers can certainly bring better work conditions and fair pay, but it is difficult to do at times because of their dubious employee categorization. Also, as is the case with many other unions, dancers are often reluctant to join them. This reluctance can be due to many factors, ranging from the cost of joining a union to the dancers believing they do not need union support because they will not be exotic dancers for a long enough period of time to justify joining a union.<ref>Brooks, S.

For example, while pornography is legal in the United States, prostitution is illegal in most parts of the US. However, in other regions of the world, both pornography and prostitution are illegal; in others, both are legal. One example of a country in which pornography, prostitution, and all professions encompassed under the umbrella of sex work are all legal is New Zealand. Under the Prostitution Reform Act of New Zealand, laws and regulations have been put into place in order to ensure the safety and protection of its sex workers. For example, since the implementation of the Prostitution Reform Act, \"any person seeking to open a larger brothel, where more than four sex workers will be working requires a Brothel Operators Certificate, which certifies them as a suitable person to exercise control over sex workers in the workplace.

In one study, women involved in sex work were interviewed and asked if they thought it should be made legal. They answered that they thought it should not, as it would put women at higher risk from violent customers if it were considered legitimate work, and they would not want their friends or family entering the sex industry to earn money. Another argument is that legalizing sex work would increase the demand for it, and women should not be treated as sexual merchandise. A study showed that in countries that have legalized prostitution, there was an increase in child prostitution. An argument against legalizing sex work is to keep children from being involved in this industry. The studies also showed that legalizing sex work lead to an increase in sex trafficking, which is another reason people give for making sex work illegal.<ref name=\"Janice G.

One major argument for legalizing prostitution is that women should have a right to do what they want with their own bodies. The government should not have a say in what they do for work, and if they want to sell their bodies it is their own decision. Another common argument for legalizing prostitution is that enforcing prostitution laws is a waste of money. This is because prostitution has always, and will continue to persist despite whatever laws and regulations are implemented against it. In arguing for the decriminalization of sex work, the Minister of Justice of the Netherlands expanded upon this argument in court when stating that, \"prostitution has existed for a long time and will continue to do so\u2026Prohibition is not the way to proceed\u2026One should allow for voluntary prostitution. The authorities can then regulate prostitution, [and] it can become healthy, safe, transparent, and cleansed from criminal side-effects.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Weitzer|first1=Ronald John|title=Legalizing Prostitution: From Illicit Vice to Lawful Business|year=2012|publisher=NYU Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ercUCgAAQBAJ|isbn=9780814794630}}</ref> People who wish to legalize prostitution do not see enforcing laws against sex work as effective and think the money is better spent elsewhere. Many people also argue that legalization of prostitution will lead to less harm for the sex workers. They argue that the decriminalization of sex work will decrease the exploitation of sex workers by third parties such as pimps and managers. A final argument for the legalization of sex work is that prostitution laws are unconstitutional. Some argue that these laws go against people's rights to free speech, privacy, etc.{{sfn|Weitzer|1991}}\n\n== Risk reduction ==\nRisk reduction in sex work is a highly debated topic. \"Abolitionism\" and \"nonabolitionism\" or \"empowerment\" are regarded as opposing ways in which risk reduction is approached.<ref name=\"Traffic Violations\">{{cite journal|last=Saunders|first=Penelope|title=Traffic Violations: Determining the Meaning of Violence in Sexual Trafficking versus Sex Work|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|date=March 2005|volume=20|issue=3|pages=343\u2013360|url=http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Migration%20studies/Determining%20the%20meaning%20of%20violence%20in%20sexual%20trafficking%20versus%20sex%20work%20Saunders%20J%20Interpers%20Viol%202005%2020(3)%20343-360.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120915113821/http://myweb.dal.ca/mgoodyea/Documents/Migration%20studies/Determining%20the%20meaning%20of%20violence%20in%20sexual%20trafficking%20versus%20sex%20work%20Saunders%20J%20Interpers%20Viol%202005%2020(3)%20343-360.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-09-15|accessdate=24 April 2014|doi=10.1177/0886260504272509|pmid=15684141|df=}}</ref>  While abolitionism would call for an end to all sex work, empowerment would encourage the formation of networks among sex workers and enable them to prevent STIs and other health risks by communicating with each other.<ref name=\"Reframing Sex Worker Health\">{{cite journal|last=Tucker|first=Joseph|author2=Astrid Tuminez|title=Reframing the Interpretation of Sex Worker Health: A Behavioral\u2013Structural Approach|journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=204|issue=5|pages=S1206\u201310|doi=10.1093/infdis/jir534|pmid=22043033|url=http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/204/suppl_5/S1206.short|accessdate=14 March 2014|pmc=3205084}}</ref> Both approaches aim to reduce rates of disease and other negative effects of sex work.\n\nIn addition, sex workers themselves have disputed the dichotomous nature of abolitionism and nonabolitionism, advocating instead a focus on sex workers' rights.

They face biological, personal, relational, and structural risks that all increase their chances of getting HIV. Biological factors include incorrect condom usage because of erectile dysfunction from hormones taken to become more feminine and receptive anal intercourse without a condom which is a high risk for developing HIV. Personal factors include mental health issues that lead to increased sexual risk, such as anxiety, depression, and substance abuse provoked through lack of support, violence, etc. Structural risks include involvement in sex work being linked to poverty, substance abuse, and other factors that are more prevalent in transgender women based on their tendency to be socially marginalized and not accepted for challenging gender norms. The largest risk for HIV is unprotected sex with male partners, and studies have been emerging that show men who have sex with transgender women are more likely to use drugs than men that do not.<ref name=\"Tonia Potiat - HIV risk and preventive interventions in transgender women sex workers\">{{cite journal|last=Potiat|first=Tonia|title=HIV risk and preventive interventions in transgender women sex workers|journal=The Lancet|date=January 23, 2015|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60833-3|pmid=25059941|volume=385|issue=9964|pages=274\u2013286|pmc=4320978}}</ref>\n\nCondom use is one way to mitigate the risk of contracting an STI. However, negotiating condom use with one's clients and partners is often an obstacle to practicing safer sex.

Brothels with strong workplace health practices, including the availability of condoms, have also increased condom use among their workers.<ref name=\"Violence + Condom Negotiation\" />\n\n'''''Health Concerns of Exotic Dancers'''''<br>''Mental Health and Stigma''<br>In order to protect themselves from the stigma of sex work, many dancers resort to othering themselves. Othering involves constructing oneself as superior to one's peers, and the dancer persona provides an internal boundary that separates the \"authentic\" from the stripper self. This practice creates a lot of stress for the dancers, in turn leading many to resort to using drugs and alcohol to cope. Since it is so widespread, the use of drugs has become normalized in the exotic dance scene.<br>Despite this normalization, passing as nonusers, or covering as users of less maligned drugs, is necessary. This is because strippers concurrently attribute a strong moral constitution to those that resist the drug atmosphere; it is a testament to personal strength and will power. It is also an occasion for dancers to \"other\" fellow strippers. Valorizing resistance to the drug space discursively positions \"good\" strippers against such a drug locale and indicates why dancers are motivated to closet hard drug use.<br>Stigma causes strippers to hide their lifestyles from friends and family alienating themselves from a support system. Further, the stress of trying to hide their lifestyles from others due to fear of scrutiny affects the mental health of dancers. Stigma is a difficult area to address because it is more abstract, but it would be helpful to work toward normalizing sex work as a valid way of making a living. This normalization of sex work would relieve the stress many dancers experience increasing the likelihood that they will be open about their work. Being open will allow them access to a viable support system and reduce the othering and drug use so rampant in the sex industry.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tyndale | first1 = Maticka | year = 2000 | title = Exotic dancing and health | url = | journal = Women & Health | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 87\u2013108 | doi=10.1300/j013v31n01_06| pmid = 11005222 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Barton | first1 = B | year = 2007 | title = Managing the toll of stripping boundary setting among exotic dancers | url = | journal = Journal of Contemporary Ethnography | volume = 36 | issue = 5| page = 571 | doi=10.1177/0891241607301971}}</ref>\n\n=== Forced sex work ===\n{{see also|Sexual slavery|Sex trafficking}}\nForced sex work is when an individual enters into any sex trade due to coercion rather than by choice.

Advocates also want to see changes in legal practices involving sex work, the [[Red Umbrella Project]] has pushed for the decriminalization of condoms and changes to New York's sex workers diversion program.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://news.vice.com/article/not-everyone-is-happy-with-the-ny-courts-treating-sex-workers-as-trafficking-victims|title=Not Everyone Is Happy with the NY Courts Treating Sex Workers as Trafficking Victims |newspaper=VICE News|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-25}}</ref> Advocacy for the interests of sex workers can come from a variety of sources, including non-governmental organizations, labor rights organizations, governments, or sex workers themselves. Each year in London [[Sexual Freedom Awards|The Sexual Freedom Awards]] is held to honor the most notable advocates and pioneers of sexual freedom and sex workers' rights in the UK, where sex work is essentially legal.\n\n=== Unionization of sex work ===\nThe unionization of sex workers is a recent development. The first organization within the contemporary sex workers' rights movement was Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics ([[COYOTE]]), founded in 1973 in San Francisco, California. Many organizations in Western countries were established in the decade after the founding of COYOTE.<ref name=\"sex worker unionisation Gall\" />  Currently, a small number of sex worker unions exist worldwide. One of the largest is the International Union of Sex Workers, headquartered in the United Kingdom. The IUSW advocates for the rights of all sex workers, whether they chose freely or were coerced to enter the trade, and promotes policies that benefit the interests of sex workers both in the UK and abroad.<ref name=\"IUSW: Who We Are\">{{cite web|title=IUSW: Who We Are|url=http://www.iusw.org/iusw-who-we-are/|publisher=International Union of Sex Workers|accessdate=15 March 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315075748/http://www.iusw.org/iusw-who-we-are/|archivedate=15 March 2014|df=}}</ref> Many regions are home to sex worker unions, including Latin America, Brazil, Canada, Europe, and Africa.<ref name=\"Sex worker organizations around the world\">{{cite web|title=Sex Worker Rights Organizations and Projects Around the World|url=http://www.bayswan.org/orgs.html|publisher=Prostitutes' Education Network}}</ref>\n\nIn unionizing, many sex workers face issues relating to communication and to the legality of sex work. Because sex work is illegal in many places where they wish to organize, it is difficult to communicate with other sex workers in order to organize. There is also concern with the legitimacy of sex work as a career and an activity that merits formal organizing, largely because of the sexism often present in sex work and the devaluation of sex work as not comparable to other paid labor and employment.<ref name=\"sex worker unionisation Gall\"/>\n\nA factor affecting the unionization of sex work is that many sex workers belong to populations that historically have not had a strong representation in labor unions. While this unionization can be viewed as a way of empowering sex workers and granting them agency within their profession, it is also criticized as implicitly lending its approval to sexism and power imbalances already present in sex work. Unionization also implies a submission to or operation within the systems of capitalism, which is of concern to some feminists.<ref name=\"sex worker unionisation Gall\">{{cite journal|last=Gall|first=Gregor|title=Sex worker unionisation: an exploratory study of emerging collective organisation|journal=Industrial Relations Journal|date=1 January 2007|volume=38|issue=1|pages=70\u201388|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2338.2007.00436.x}}</ref>\n\n====Unionizing exotic dancers====\n''Independent contractor vs Employee''<br>Performers in general are problematic to categorize because they often exercise a high level of control over their work product, one characteristic of an independent contractor. Additionally, their work can be artistic in nature and often done on a freelance basis. Often, the work of performers does not possess the obvious attributes of employees such as regular working hours, places or duties. Consequently, employers misclassify them because they are unsure of their workers' status, or they purposely misclassify them to take advantage of independent contractors' low costs. Exotic dance clubs are one such employer that purposely misclassify their performers as independent contractors.\n\nThere are additional hurdles in terms of self-esteem and commitment to unionize. On the most basic level, dancers themselves must have the desire to unionize for collective action. For those who wish not to conform to group activity or want to remain independent, a union may seem as controlling as club management since joining a union would obligate them to pay dues and abide by decisions made through majority vote, with or without their personal approval.\n\nIn the ''Lusty Lady'' case study, this strip club was the first all-woman-managed club to successfully unionize in 1996. Some of the working conditions they were able to address included \"protest[ing] racist hiring practices, customers being allowed to videotape dancers without their consent via one-way mirrors, inconsistent disciplinary policies, lack of health benefits, and an overall dearth of job security\".  Unionizing exotic dancers can certainly bring better work conditions and fair pay, but it is difficult to do at times because of their dubious employee categorization. Also, as is the case with many other unions, dancers are often reluctant to join them. This reluctance can be due to many factors, ranging from the cost of joining a union to the dancers believing they do not need union support because they will not be exotic dancers for a long enough period of time to justify joining a union.<ref>Brooks, S.
