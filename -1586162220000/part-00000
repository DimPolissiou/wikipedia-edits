Because of the mountainous terrain, the existing network consisted of {{RailGauge|1067mm|lk=on}} narrow-gauge lines, which generally took indirect routes and could not be adapted to higher speeds. Consequently, Japan had a greater need for new high-speed lines than countries where the existing [[standard gauge]] or [[broad gauge]] rail system had more upgrade potential.\n\nAmong the key people credited with the construction of the first Shinkansen are [[Hideo Shima]], the Chief Engineer, and [[Shinji Sog\u014d]], the first President of [[Japanese National Railways]] (JNR) who managed to persuade politicians to back the plan. Other significant people responsible for its technical development were Tadanao Miki, Tadashi Matsudaira, and Hajime Kawanabe based at the [[Railway Technical Research Institute]] (RTRI), part of JNR. They were responsible for much of the technical development of the first line, the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]]. All three had worked on aircraft design during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Hood\">{{Cite book | last = Hood | first = Christopher P. | title = Shinkansen \u2013 From Bullet Train to Symbol of Modern Japan | series = Routledge Contemporary Japan Series | publisher = Routledge | location=London | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=cwbklrvmS-oC | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-415-32052-8 | pages = 18\u201343}}</ref>\n\n=== Early proposals ===\nThe popular English name ''bullet train'' is a literal translation of the Japanese term {{Nihongo|''dangan ressha''|\u5f3e\u4e38\u5217\u8eca}}, a nickname given to the project while it was initially being discussed in the 1930s. The name stuck because of the original [[0 Series Shinkansen]]'s resemblance to a bullet and its high speed.\n\nThe ''Shinkansen'' name was first formally used in 1940 for a proposed standard gauge passenger and freight line between Tokyo and [[Shimonoseki]] that would have used steam and electric locomotives with a top speed of {{convert|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Over the next three years, the Ministry of Railways drew up more ambitious plans to extend the line to Beijing (through a [[Japan\u2013Korea Undersea Tunnel|tunnel to Korea]]) and even [[Singapore]], and build connections to the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and other trunk lines in Asia. These plans were abandoned in 1943 as Japan's position in World War II worsened. However, some construction did commence on the line; several tunnels on the present-day Shinkansen date to the war-era project.\n\n=== Construction ===\nFollowing the end of World War II, high-speed rail was forgotten for several years while traffic of passengers and freight steadily increased on the conventional [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line]] along with the reconstruction of Japanese industry and economy. By the mid-1950s the T\u014dkaid\u014d Line was operating at full capacity, and the Ministry of Railways decided to revisit the Shinkansen project. In 1957, [[Odakyu Electric Railway]] introduced its [[Odakyu 3000 series SE|3000 series SE]] [[Romancecar]] train, setting a world speed record of {{convert|145|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} for a narrow gauge train. This train gave designers the confidence that they could safely build an even faster standard gauge train. Thus the first Shinkansen, the 0 series, was built on the success of the Romancecar.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Japanese national attitude was that railways would soon be outdated and replaced by air travel and highways as in America and many countries in Europe. However, [[Shinji Sog\u014d]], President of [[Japanese National Railways]], insisted strongly on the possibility of [[high-speed rail]], and the Shinkansen project was implemented.\n\nGovernment approval came in December 1958, and construction of the first segment of the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] between Tokyo and [[Osaka]] started in April 1959. The cost of constructing the Shinkansen was at first estimated at nearly 200 billion yen, which was raised in the form of a government loan, railway bonds and a low-interest loan of US$80 million from the [[World Bank]]. Initial cost estimates, however, had been deliberately understated and the actual figures were nearly double at about 400 billion yen. As the budget shortfall became clear in 1963, Sogo resigned to take responsibility.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first = Roderick A. |title = The Japanese Shinkansen |journal = The Journal of Transport History |volume =24/2 |issue =2 |pages = 222\u2013236 |publisher = Imperial College, London |year = 2003 |doi =10.7227/TJTH.24.2.6 }}</ref>\n\nA test facility for rolling stock, now part of the line, opened in [[Odawara, Kanagawa|Odawara]] in 1962.\n\n=== Initial success ===\n[[File:JNR 19641001 Table1.png|thumb|1964 JNR Passenger Timetable, Table 1, showing shinkansen service on the New Tokaido Line]]\nThe T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen began service on 1 October 1964, in time for the [[1964 Summer Olympics|first Tokyo Olympics]].<ref>Fukada, Takahiro, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081209i1.html Shinkansen about more than speed]\", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 9 December 2008, p. 3.</ref> The conventional Limited Express service took six hours and 40 minutes from Tokyo to Osaka, but the Shinkansen made the trip in just four hours, shortened to three hours and ten minutes by 1965.

Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] was an ardent supporter of the Shinkansen, and his government proposed an extensive network paralleling most existing trunk lines. Two new lines, the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]] and [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]], were built following this plan. Many other planned lines were delayed or scrapped entirely as [[Japanese National Railways|JNR]] slid into debt throughout the late 1970s, largely because of the high cost of building the Shinkansen network. By the early 1980s, the company was practically insolvent, leading to its privatization in 1987.\n\nDevelopment of the Shinkansen by the privatised regional JR companies has continued, with new train models developed, each generally with its own distinctive appearance (such as the [[500 Series Shinkansen|500 series]] introduced by [[JR West]]). Since 2014, Shinkansen trains run regularly at speeds up to {{convert|320|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}} on the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]], only the [[Shanghai maglev train]] and [[China Railway High-speed]] networks have commercial services that operate faster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2016-05-18/the-10-fastest-trains-in-the-world |title=The 10 fastest trains in the world |publisher=cntraveler.com |date= |accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nSince 1970, development has also been underway for the [[Ch\u016b\u014d Shinkansen]], a planned [[maglev]] line from Tokyo to Osaka. On 21 April 2015, a seven-car [[L0 series]] maglev trainset set a [[Land speed record for railed vehicles|world speed record]] of {{convert|603|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"guardian20150421\"/>\n\n== Technology ==\nTo enable high-speed operation Shinkansen uses a range of advanced technology compared with conventional rail, achieving not only high speed but also a high standard of safety and comfort. Its success has influenced other railways in the world and the importance and advantage of [[high-speed rail]] has consequently been reevaluated.\n\n=== Routing ===\nShinkansen routes are completely separate from conventional rail lines (except [[Mini-shinkansen]] which goes through to conventional lines). Consequently, the shinkansen is not affected by slower local or freight trains (except for [[Hokkaido Shinkansen]] while traveling through the [[Seikan Tunnel]]), and has the capacity to operate many high-speed trains punctually. The lines have been built without [[level crossing|road crossings at grade]]. Tracks are strictly off-limits with penalties against trespassing strictly regulated by law. It uses tunnels and [[viaduct]]s to go through and over obstacles rather than around them, with a minimum curve radius of 4,000&nbsp;meters (2,500&nbsp;meters on the oldest T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr11/history.html|title=Railway Modernization and Shinkansen|publisher=Japan Railway & Transport Review|date=30 April 2011|accessdate=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613154641/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr11/history.html|archive-date=13 June 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Track ===\n[[File:Toyohashi Station 001.JPG|thumb|Shinkansen [[standard gauge]] track, with welded rails to reduce vibration]]\nThe Shinkansen uses {{RailGauge|1435mm}} [[standard gauge]] in contrast to the {{RailGauge|1067mm}} narrow gauge of older lines. [[Continuous welded rail]] and [[swingnose crossing]] points are employed, eliminating gaps at turnouts and crossings. Long rails are used, joined by expansion joints to minimize gauge fluctuation due to thermal elongation and shrinkage.\n\nA combination of [[track ballast|ballasted]] and [[slab track]] is used, with slab track exclusively employed on concrete bed sections such as viaducts and tunnels. Slab track is significantly more cost-effective in tunnel sections, since the lower track height reduces the cross-sectional area of the tunnel, thereby reducing construction costs by up to 30%.<ref>Miura, S., Takai, H., Uchida, M., and Fukada, Y. The Mechanism of Railway Tracks. Japan Railway & Transport Review, 15, 38\u201345, 1998</ref>\nHowever, the smaller diameter of Shinkansen tunnels compared to some other high-speed lines has resulted in the issue of [[Piston effect|tunnel boom]] becoming a concern for residents living close to tunnel portals.\n\nThe slab track consists of rails, fasteners and track slabs with a cement asphalt mortar. On the roadbed and in tunnels, circular upstands (measuring 400\u2013520&nbsp;mm in diameter and 200&nbsp;mm high) are located at 5 metre intervals. The \nprefabricated upstands are made of either [[reinforced concrete]] or pre-stressed reinforced concrete; they prevent the track slab from moving along either the latitudinal or the longitudinal directions. One track slab weighs approximately 5 tons, measuring 2220\u20132340&nbsp;mm wide, 4900\u20134950&nbsp;mm long and 160\u2013200&nbsp;mm thick.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ando |first1=Katsutoshi |display-authors=etal |date=2001 |title=Development of Slab Tracks for Hokuriku Shinkansen Line |journal=Quarterly Report of RTRI |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=35\u201341 |doi=10.2219/rtriqr.42.35 }}</ref>\n\n=== Signal system ===\n[[File:ATC TEC.png|thumb|Braking curve for the original ATC-1 used on the [[Tokaido Shinkansen]] (vertical axis represents the speed of the train whereas the horizontal axis represents the distance)]]\n[[File:\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u7dcf\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u6240(\u4eac\u90fd\u9244\u9053\u535a\u7269\u9928).jpg|thumb|Replica of the Shinkansen CTC as seen at the [[Kyoto Railway Museum]]]]\nThe Shinkansen employs an [[Automatic Train Control|ATC]] (Automatic Train Control) system, eliminating the need for trackside signals. It uses a comprehensive system of [[Automatic Train Protection]].<ref name=\"Smith\" /> [[Centralized traffic control]] manages all train operations, and all tasks relating to train movement, track, station and schedule are networked and computerized.\n\n=== Electrical systems ===\nShinkansen uses a [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] overhead power supply (20 kV AC on [[Mini-shinkansen]] lines), to overcome the limitations of the 1,500 V [[direct current]] used on the existing electrified narrow-gauge system. Power is distributed along the axles of the train to reduce the heavy axle loads under single power cars.<ref name=\"Smith\" /> The AC frequency of the power supply for the Tokaido Shinkansen is 60&nbsp;Hz.\n\n=== Trains ===\nShinkansen trains are [[electric multiple unit]]s, offering fast acceleration, deceleration and reduced damage to the track because of the use of lighter vehicles compared to locomotives or power cars. The coaches are air-sealed to ensure stable air pressure when entering tunnels at high speed.\n[[File:Close look at Shinkansen coaches.JPG|thumb|A passenger's view of Shinkansen coaches]]\n\n=== Punctuality ===\nThe Shinkansen is very reliable thanks to several factors, including its near-total separation from slower traffic. In 2016, [[JR Central]] reported that the Shinkansen's average delay from schedule per train was 24 seconds. This includes delays due to uncontrollable causes, such as natural disasters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.jr-central.co.jp/company/ir/annualreport/_pdf/annualreport2016.pdf|title=Central Japan Railway Company Annual Report 2016|page=18|accessdate=24 July 2016}}</ref> The record, in 1997, was 18 seconds.\n\n=== Traction ===\nThe Shinkansen has used the [[electric multiple unit]] configuration from the outset, with the [[0 Series Shinkansen]] having all axles powered. Other railway manufacturers were traditionally reluctant, or unable to use distributed traction configurations ([[Talgo]], the German [[ICE 2]] and the French (and subsequently South Korean) [[TGV]] (and [[KTX-I]] and [[KTX-II]]) use the [[locomotive]] (also known as power car) configuration with the [[AVE Class 102]] and continues with it for the [[Talgo AVRIL]] on account of the fact that it is not possible to use powered bogies as part of Talgo's bogie design, which uses a modified [[Jacobs bogie]] with a single axle instead of two and allows the wheels to rotate independently of each other, on the ICE 2, TGV and KTX it is because it easily allows for a high ride quality and less electrical equipment.<ref>http://www.ejrcf.or.jp/jrtr/jrtr17/pdf/f40_technology.pdf</ref>) In Japan, significant engineering desirability exists for the electric multiple unit configuration. A greater proportion of motored axles results in higher acceleration, meaning that the Shinkansen does not lose as much time if stopping frequently.

Shinkansen lines, particularly in the very crowded coastal [[Taiheiy\u014d Belt]] [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]], met two primary goals:\n\n* Shinkansen trains reduced the congestion burden on regional transportation by increasing throughput on a minimal land footprint, therefore being economically preferable compared to modes (such as airports or highways) common in less densely populated regions of the world. \n* As rail was already the primary urban mode of passenger travel, from that perspective it was akin to a [[sunk cost]]; there was not a significant number of motorists to convince to switch modes. The initial megalopolitan Shinkansen lines were profitable and paid for themselves. Connectivity rejuvenated rural towns such as [[Kakegawa, Shizuoka|Kakegawa]] that would otherwise be too distant from major cities.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\nHowever, upon the introduction of the 1973 Basic Plan the initial prudence in developing Shinkansen lines gave way to political considerations to extend the mode to far less populated regions of the country, partly to spread these benefits beyond the key centres of [[Kant\u014d region|Kanto]] and [[Kinki]]. Although in some cases regional extension was frustrated by protracted land acquisition issues (sometimes influenced by the cancellation of the Narita Shinkansen following fierce protests by locals), over time Shinkansen lines were built to relatively sparsely populated areas with the intent the network would disperse the population away from the capital.\n\nSuch expansion had a significant cost. JNR, the national railway company, was already burdened with subsidizing unprofitable rural and regional railways. Additionally it assumed Shinkansen construction debt to the point the government corporation eventually owed some {{JPY|28 trillion}}, contributing to it being regionalised and privatized in 1987.<ref name=\"jrtr-kakumoto\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/F23_Kakumoto.html |title=Sensible Politics and Transport Theories? |publisher=Jrtr.net |accessdate=30 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606151933/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/F23_Kakumoto.html |archive-date=6 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The privatized JRs eventually paid a total of {{JPY|9.2 trillion}} to acquire JNR's Shinkansen network.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\nFollowing privatization, the JR group of companies have continued Shinkansen network expansion to less populated areas, but with far more flexibility to [[Corporate spin-off|spin off]] unprofitable railways or cut costs than in JNR days. Currently an important factor is the post [[Japanese asset price bubble|bubble]] [[zero interest-rate policy]] that allows JR to borrow huge sums of capital without significant concern regarding [[Amortization schedule|repayment timing]].\n\n=== Environmental impact ===\nTraveling by the Tokaido Shinkansen from Tokyo to Osaka produces only around 16% of the [[carbon dioxide]] of the equivalent journey by car, a saving of 15,000 tons of {{co2}} per year.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\n== Challenges encountered ==\n\n=== Noise pollution ===\n[[Noise pollution]] concerns mean that increasing speed is becoming more difficult. In Japan, the [[population density]] is high and there have been severe protests against the Shinkansen's noise pollution, meaning that its noise is now limited to less than 70 [[Decibel|dB]] in residential areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.env.go.jp/kijun/oto3.html |title=\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u9244\u9053\u9a12\u97f3\u306b\u4fc2\u308b\u74b0\u5883\u57fa\u6e96\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\uff08\u662d\u548c50\u5e74\u74b0\u5883\u5e81\u544a\u793a\uff09 The Environmental Regulation of Shinkansen Noise Pollution (1975, Environmental Agency) (Japanese) |publisher=Env.go.jp |date= |accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>\nHence, improvement and reduction of the [[pantograph (rail)|pantograph]], weight saving of cars, and construction of [[noise barrier]]s and other measures have been implemented. Current research is primarily aimed at reducing operational noise, particularly the [[Piston effect#Tunnel boom|tunnel boom]] phenomenon caused when trains transit tunnels at high speed.\n\n=== Earthquake ===\nBecause of the risk of earthquakes, the Urgent Earthquake Detection and Alarm System (UrEDAS) ([[earthquake warning system]]) was introduced in 1992. It enables automatic braking of bullet trains in the case of large earthquakes.\n\n=== Heavy snow ===\nThe [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] often experiences heavy snow in the area around [[Maibara Station]] in winter. Trains have to reduce speed, which can disrupt the timetable. Sprinkler systems were later installed, but delays of 10 to 20 minutes still occur during snowy weather. Additionally, treefalls related to excess snow have caused service interruptions. Along the route of the [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]], winter snow can be very heavy, with snow depths of two to three metres, so the line is equipped with stronger sprinklers and [[Ballastless track|slab track]], to mitigate the effects of deep snow.\n\n== Ridership ==\n\n===Annual===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+  Annual ridership figures for selected years (in million of passengers)<ref name=\"mlit\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/10/10a0excel.html |title=\u56fd\u571f\u4ea4\u901a\u7701\u9244\u9053\u8f38\u9001\u7d71\u8a08\u5e74\u5831\uff08\u5e73\u621019\u5e74\u5ea6\uff09 |access-date=19 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514103232/http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/10/10a0excel.html |archive-date=14 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n! !!

However, technical issues with the development of the GCT bogies means the train will not be available for service until at least 2025, requiring consideration of other options such as [[Tsubame (train)#Relay Tsubame|'relay']] service to ensure the line can open on schedule in fiscal 2022.<ref name=\"ajw.asahi.com\">{{cite web|url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201602240076 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-11-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225105059/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201602240076 |archivedate=25 February 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe proposal shortens the distance between Hakata and Nagasaki by 6.2% (9.6&nbsp;km), and while only 64% of the route will be built to full Shinkansen standards, it will eliminate the slowest sections of the existing narrow gauge route. Use of the GCT was estimated to result in a time saving of 28.5% (32 minutes) on the current timetable. The proposed time saving if a 'relay' service is introduced is unknown at this time.\n\nAs part of this proposal, the current 12.8&nbsp;km section of single track between Hizen Yamaguchi and Takeo Onsen is proposed to be duplicated. However, due to the delay in the development of the GCT, the proposal has not advanced.\n\nWith the completion of excavation of the 1351m Enogushi tunnel, being the sixth tunnel completed in this section, approximately 25% of the 40.7&nbsp;km of tunnel excavation work on the Takeo Onsen \u2013 Nagasaki section has been finished.

Shinkansen services to these lines traverse the [[Tohoku Shinkansen]] line from Tokyo before branching off to traditional main lines. On both the Yamagata/Shinjo and Akita lines, the narrow gauge lines were regauged, resulting in the local services being operated by [[701 series#701-5000 series|standard gauge versions]] of 1,067&nbsp;mm gauge suburban/interurban rolling stock. On the Akita line between Omagari and Akita, one of the two narrow gauge lines was regauged, and a section of the remaining narrow gauge line is dual gauge, providing the opportunity for Shinkansen services to pass each other without stopping.\n\nThe maximum speed on these lines is 130&nbsp;km/h, however the overall travel time to/from Tokyo is improved due to the elimination of the need for passengers to change trains at [[Fukushima, Fukushima|Fukushima]] and [[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]] respectively.\n\nAs the [[Loading gauge]] (size of the train that can travel on a line) was not altered when the rail gauge was widened, only Shinkansen trains specially built for these routes can travel on the lines. At present they are the E3 and E6 series trains.\n\nWhilst no further Mini-shinkansen routes have been proposed to date, it remains an option for providing Shinkansen services to cities on the narrow gauge network.\n\n=== Gauge Change Train ===\n{{Main|Gauge Change Train}}\n\nThis is the name for the concept of using a single train that is specially designed to travel on both {{RailGauge|1067mm}} narrow gauge railway lines and the {{RailGauge|1435mm}} standard gauge used by Shinkansen train services in Japan. The trucks/bogies of the Gauge Change Train (GCT) allow the wheels to be unlocked from the axles, narrowed or widened as necessary, and then relocked. This allows a GCT to traverse both standard gauge and narrow gauge tracks without the expense of regauging lines.\n\nThree test trains have been constructed, with the second set having completed reliability trials on the [[Yosan Line]] east of [[Matsuyama, Ehime|Matsuyama]] (in [[Shikoku]]) in September 2013. The third set was undertaking gauge changing trials at [[Shin-Yatsushiro Station]] (on [[Kyushu]]), commencing in 2014 for a proposed three-year period, however testing was suspended in December 2014 after accumulating approximating 33,000&nbsp;km, following the discovery of defective thrust bearing oil seals on the bogies.<ref name=\"mynavi20141224\">{{cite web |url= http://news.mynavi.jp/news/2014/12/24/335/ |script-title=ja:\u4e5d\u5dde\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u306e\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30b2\u30fc\u30b8\u30c8\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u3001\u6b20\u640d\u304c\u898b\u3064\u304b\u308a\u8010\u4e45\u8d70\u884c\u8a66\u9a13\u3092\u4e00\u6642\u4f11\u6b62 |trans-title= Kyushu Shinkansen Free Gauge Train endurance testing suspended following discovery of defects |date= 24 December 2014|work= Mynavi News|publisher= Mynavi Corporation |location= Japan|language= Japanese|accessdate= 27 December 2014}}</ref> The train was being trialled between [[Kumamoto]], travelling on the narrow gauge line to Shin-Yatsushiro, where a gauge changer has been installed, so the GCT could then be trialled on the Shinkansen line to [[Kagoshima]].

While no construction work was ever started, land along the proposed track, including an underground section leading to Shinjuku Station, remains reserved. If capacity on the current Tokyo\u2013\u014cmiya section proves insufficient, at some point, construction of the Shinjuku\u2013\u014cmiya link may be reconsidered.\n\nThe [[Narita Shinkansen]] project to connect Tokyo to [[Narita International Airport]], initiated in the 1970s but halted in 1983 after landowner protests, has been officially cancelled and removed from the Basic Plan governing Shinkansen construction. Parts of its planned right-of-way were used by the [[Narita Sky Access Line]] which opened in 2010. Although the Sky Access Line uses standard-gauge track, it was not built to Shinkansen specifications and there are no plans to convert it into a full Shinkansen line.\n\nIn December 2009, then transport minister [[Seiji Maehara]] proposed a bullet train link to [[Haneda Airport]], using an existing spur that connects the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] to a train depot. [[JR Central]] called the plan \"unrealistic\" due to tight train schedules on the existing line, but reports said that Maehara wished to continue discussions on the idea.<ref>{{Cite news|title= Maehara sounds out JR Tokai over shinkansen link for Haneda airport|newspaper= Japan Today|date= 28 December 2009|url= http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/maehara-sounds-out-jr-tokai-over-shinkansen-link-for-haneda-airport|accessdate= 28 December 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The current minister has not indicated whether this proposal remains supported. While the plan may become more feasible after the opening the Chuo Shinkansen (sometimes referred to as a bypass to the Tokaido Shinkansen) frees up capacity, construction is already underway for other rail improvements between Haneda and Tokyo station expected to be completed prior to the opening of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, so any potential Shinkansen service would likely offer only marginal benefit beyond that.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2|Line\n!colspan=2|Speed\n!colspan=2|Length\n!rowspan=2|Construction began/proposed\n!rowspan=2|Expected start of revenue services\n|-\n!km/h\n!mph\n!km\n!mi\n|-\n| [[Kyushu Shinkansen]] (West Kyushu Route)\n|{{convert|260|km/h|mph|disp=table}}\n|{{convert|66.7|km|mi|disp=table}} \n|2009 \n|FY2022\n|-\n| [[Hokuriku Shinkansen]] Phase 3 (Kanazawa \u2013 Tsuruga)\n|{{convert|260|km/h|mph|disp=table}}\n|{{convert|120.7|km|mi|disp=table}} \n|2012 \n|FY2023\n|-\n| [[Hokkaido Shinkansen]] Phase 2 (Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto \u2013 Sapporo)\n|{{convert|260|km/h|mph|disp=table}}\n|{{convert|211.3|km|mi|disp=table}}\n|2012 \n|FY2030\n|-\n| Hokuriku Shinkansen Phase 4 (Tsuruga \u2013 Obama \u2013 Kyoto \u2013 Shin-Osaka)\n|{{convert|260|km/h|mph|disp=table}}\n|{{TBD|disp=table}}\n|{{TBD|disp=table}} \n|2030 \n|FY2045\n|}\n\n== List of train types ==\nTrains are up to sixteen cars long.

has several advantages, including scheduling frequency and flexibility, punctual operation, comfortable seats, and convenient city-centre terminals.\n\nShinkansen fares are generally competitive with domestic air fares. From a speed and convenience perspective, the Shinkansen's market share has surpassed that of air travel for journeys of less than 750&nbsp;km, while air and rail remain highly competitive with each other in the 800\u2013900&nbsp;km range and air has a higher market share for journeys of more than 1,000&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shiomi|first1=Eiji|title=Do Faster Trains Challenge Air Carriers?|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr19/F04_Shiomi.html|website=Japan Railway & Transport Review|accessdate=7 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930083648/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr19/F04_Shiomi.html|archive-date=30 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n* Tokyo \u2013 Nagoya (342&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Sendai (325&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 [[Hanamaki, Iwate|Hanamaki]] ([[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]]) (496&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Niigata (300&nbsp;km): There were air services between these cities, but they were withdrawn after Shinkansen services started.

Additionally, unlike many cities, there is very little convenience advantage for the location of the Shinkansen stations of the two cities as [[Fukuoka Airport]] is located near the central [[Tenjin, Fukuoka|Tenjin]] district, and [[Fukuoka City Subway]] [[K\u016bk\u014d Line (Fukuoka City Subway)|Line 1]] connects the Airport and Tenjin via Hakata Station and [[Haneda Airport]] is similarly conveniently located.\n* Osaka \u2013 Fukuoka (554&nbsp;km): One of the most competitive sections. The Shinkansen takes about two and a half hours by ''Nozomi'' or ''Mizuho'', and the JR West ''Hikari Rail Star'' or JR West/JR Kyushu ''Sakura'' trains operate twice an hour, taking about 2 hours and 40 minutes between the two cities. Again the location of the airports involved helps with the popularity of air travel.\n* Tokyo \u2013 Aomori (675&nbsp;km): The fastest Shinkansen service between these cities is 3 hours.

Because of the mountainous terrain, the existing network consisted of {{RailGauge|1067mm|lk=on}} narrow-gauge lines, which generally took indirect routes and could not be adapted to higher speeds. Consequently, Japan had a greater need for new high-speed lines than countries where the existing [[standard gauge]] or [[broad gauge]] rail system had more upgrade potential.\n\nAmong the key people credited with the construction of the first Shinkansen are [[Hideo Shima]], the Chief Engineer, and [[Shinji Sog\u014d]], the first President of [[Japanese National Railways]] (JNR) who managed to persuade politicians to back the plan. Other significant people responsible for its technical development were Tadanao Miki, Tadashi Matsudaira, and Hajime Kawanabe based at the [[Railway Technical Research Institute]] (RTRI), part of JNR. They were responsible for much of the technical development of the first line, the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]]. All three had worked on aircraft design during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Hood\">{{Cite book | last = Hood | first = Christopher P. | title = Shinkansen \u2013 From Bullet Train to Symbol of Modern Japan | series = Routledge Contemporary Japan Series | publisher = Routledge | location=London | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=cwbklrvmS-oC | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-415-32052-8 | pages = 18\u201343}}</ref>\n\n=== Early proposals ===\nThe popular English name ''bullet train'' is a literal translation of the Japanese term {{Nihongo|''dangan ressha''|\u5f3e\u4e38\u5217\u8eca}}, a nickname given to the project while it was initially being discussed in the 1930s. The name stuck because of the original [[0 Series Shinkansen]]'s resemblance to a bullet and its high speed.\n\nThe ''Shinkansen'' name was first formally used in 1940 for a proposed standard gauge passenger and freight line between Tokyo and [[Shimonoseki]] that would have used steam and electric locomotives with a top speed of {{convert|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Over the next three years, the Ministry of Railways drew up more ambitious plans to extend the line to Beijing (through a [[Japan\u2013Korea Undersea Tunnel|tunnel to Korea]]) and even [[Singapore]], and build connections to the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and other trunk lines in Asia. These plans were abandoned in 1943 as Japan's position in World War II worsened. However, some construction did commence on the line; several tunnels on the present-day Shinkansen date to the war-era project.\n\n=== Construction ===\nFollowing the end of World War II, high-speed rail was forgotten for several years while traffic of passengers and freight steadily increased on the conventional [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line]] along with the reconstruction of Japanese industry and economy. By the mid-1950s the T\u014dkaid\u014d Line was operating at full capacity, and the Ministry of Railways decided to revisit the Shinkansen project. In 1957, [[Odakyu Electric Railway]] introduced its [[Odakyu 3000 series SE|3000 series SE]] [[Romancecar]] train, setting a world speed record of {{convert|145|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} for a narrow gauge train. This train gave designers the confidence that they could safely build an even faster standard gauge train. Thus the first Shinkansen, the 0 series, was built on the success of the Romancecar.\n\nIn the 1950s, the Japanese national attitude was that railways would soon be outdated and replaced by air travel and highways as in America and many countries in Europe. However, [[Shinji Sog\u014d]], President of [[Japanese National Railways]], insisted strongly on the possibility of [[high-speed rail]], and the Shinkansen project was implemented.\n\nGovernment approval came in December 1958, and construction of the first segment of the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] between Tokyo and [[Osaka]] started in April 1959. The cost of constructing the Shinkansen was at first estimated at nearly 200 billion yen, which was raised in the form of a government loan, railway bonds and a low-interest loan of US$80 million from the [[World Bank]]. Initial cost estimates, however, had been deliberately understated and the actual figures were nearly double at about 400 billion yen. As the budget shortfall became clear in 1963, Sogo resigned to take responsibility.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first = Roderick A. |title = The Japanese Shinkansen |journal = The Journal of Transport History |volume =24/2 |issue =2 |pages = 222\u2013236 |publisher = Imperial College, London |year = 2003 |doi =10.7227/TJTH.24.2.6 }}</ref>\n\nA test facility for rolling stock, now part of the line, opened in [[Odawara, Kanagawa|Odawara]] in 1962.\n\n=== Initial success ===\n[[File:JNR 19641001 Table1.png|thumb|1964 JNR Passenger Timetable, Table 1, showing shinkansen service on the New Tokaido Line]]\nThe T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen began service on 1 October 1964, in time for the [[1964 Summer Olympics|first Tokyo Olympics]].<ref>Fukada, Takahiro, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081209i1.html Shinkansen about more than speed]\", ''[[The Japan Times]]'', 9 December 2008, p. 3.</ref> The conventional Limited Express service took six hours and 40 minutes from Tokyo to Osaka, but the Shinkansen made the trip in just four hours, shortened to three hours and ten minutes by 1965.

Prime Minister [[Kakuei Tanaka]] was an ardent supporter of the Shinkansen, and his government proposed an extensive network paralleling most existing trunk lines. Two new lines, the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]] and [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]], were built following this plan. Many other planned lines were delayed or scrapped entirely as [[Japanese National Railways|JNR]] slid into debt throughout the late 1970s, largely because of the high cost of building the Shinkansen network. By the early 1980s, the company was practically insolvent, leading to its privatization in 1987.\n\nDevelopment of the Shinkansen by the privatised regional JR companies has continued, with new train models developed, each generally with its own distinctive appearance (such as the [[500 Series Shinkansen|500 series]] introduced by [[JR West]]). Since 2014, Shinkansen trains run regularly at speeds up to {{convert|320|km/h|mph|round=5|abbr=on}} on the [[T\u014dhoku Shinkansen]], only the [[Shanghai maglev train]] and [[China Railway High-speed]] networks have commercial services that operate faster.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2016-05-18/the-10-fastest-trains-in-the-world |title=The 10 fastest trains in the world |publisher=cntraveler.com |date= |accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref> \n\nSince 1970, development has also been underway for the [[Ch\u016b\u014d Shinkansen]], a planned [[maglev]] line from Tokyo to Osaka. On 21 April 2015, a seven-car [[L0 series]] maglev trainset set a [[Land speed record for railed vehicles|world speed record]] of {{convert|603|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"guardian20150421\"/>\n\n== Technology ==\nTo enable high-speed operation Shinkansen uses a range of advanced technology compared with conventional rail, achieving not only high speed but also a high standard of safety and comfort. Its success has influenced other railways in the world and the importance and advantage of [[high-speed rail]] has consequently been reevaluated.\n\n=== Routing ===\nShinkansen routes are completely separate from conventional rail lines (except [[Mini-shinkansen]] which goes through to conventional lines). Consequently, the shinkansen is not affected by slower local or freight trains (except for [[Hokkaido Shinkansen]] while traveling through the [[Seikan Tunnel]]), and has the capacity to operate many high-speed trains punctually. The lines have been built without [[level crossing|road crossings at grade]]. Tracks are strictly off-limits with penalties against trespassing strictly regulated by law. It uses tunnels and [[viaduct]]s to go through and over obstacles rather than around them, with a minimum curve radius of 4,000&nbsp;meters (2,500&nbsp;meters on the oldest T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr11/history.html|title=Railway Modernization and Shinkansen|publisher=Japan Railway & Transport Review|date=30 April 2011|accessdate=30 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613154641/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr11/history.html|archive-date=13 June 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Track ===\n[[File:Toyohashi Station 001.JPG|thumb|Shinkansen [[standard gauge]] track, with welded rails to reduce vibration]]\nThe Shinkansen uses {{RailGauge|1435mm}} [[standard gauge]] in contrast to the {{RailGauge|1067mm}} narrow gauge of older lines. [[Continuous welded rail]] and [[swingnose crossing]] points are employed, eliminating gaps at turnouts and crossings. Long rails are used, joined by expansion joints to minimize gauge fluctuation due to thermal elongation and shrinkage.\n\nA combination of [[track ballast|ballasted]] and [[slab track]] is used, with slab track exclusively employed on concrete bed sections such as viaducts and tunnels. Slab track is significantly more cost-effective in tunnel sections, since the lower track height reduces the cross-sectional area of the tunnel, thereby reducing construction costs by up to 30%.<ref>Miura, S., Takai, H., Uchida, M., and Fukada, Y. The Mechanism of Railway Tracks. Japan Railway & Transport Review, 15, 38\u201345, 1998</ref>\nHowever, the smaller diameter of Shinkansen tunnels compared to some other high-speed lines has resulted in the issue of [[Piston effect|tunnel boom]] becoming a concern for residents living close to tunnel portals.\n\nThe slab track consists of rails, fasteners and track slabs with a cement asphalt mortar. On the roadbed and in tunnels, circular upstands (measuring 400\u2013520&nbsp;mm in diameter and 200&nbsp;mm high) are located at 5 metre intervals. The \nprefabricated upstands are made of either [[reinforced concrete]] or pre-stressed reinforced concrete; they prevent the track slab from moving along either the latitudinal or the longitudinal directions. One track slab weighs approximately 5 tons, measuring 2220\u20132340&nbsp;mm wide, 4900\u20134950&nbsp;mm long and 160\u2013200&nbsp;mm thick.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ando |first1=Katsutoshi |display-authors=etal |date=2001 |title=Development of Slab Tracks for Hokuriku Shinkansen Line |journal=Quarterly Report of RTRI |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=35\u201341 |doi=10.2219/rtriqr.42.35 }}</ref>\n\n=== Signal system ===\n[[File:ATC TEC.png|thumb|Braking curve for the original ATC-1 used on the [[Tokaido Shinkansen]] (vertical axis represents the speed of the train whereas the horizontal axis represents the distance)]]\n[[File:\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u7dcf\u5408\u6307\u4ee4\u6240(\u4eac\u90fd\u9244\u9053\u535a\u7269\u9928).jpg|thumb|Replica of the Shinkansen CTC as seen at the [[Kyoto Railway Museum]]]]\nThe Shinkansen employs an [[Automatic Train Control|ATC]] (Automatic Train Control) system, eliminating the need for trackside signals. It uses a comprehensive system of [[Automatic Train Protection]].<ref name=\"Smith\" /> [[Centralized traffic control]] manages all train operations, and all tasks relating to train movement, track, station and schedule are networked and computerized.\n\n=== Electrical systems ===\nShinkansen uses a [[25 kV AC railway electrification|25 kV AC]] overhead power supply (20 kV AC on [[Mini-shinkansen]] lines), to overcome the limitations of the 1,500 V [[direct current]] used on the existing electrified narrow-gauge system. Power is distributed along the axles of the train to reduce the heavy axle loads under single power cars.<ref name=\"Smith\" /> The AC frequency of the power supply for the Tokaido Shinkansen is 60&nbsp;Hz.\n\n=== Trains ===\nShinkansen trains are [[electric multiple unit]]s, offering fast acceleration, deceleration and reduced damage to the track because of the use of lighter vehicles compared to locomotives or power cars. The coaches are air-sealed to ensure stable air pressure when entering tunnels at high speed.\n[[File:Close look at Shinkansen coaches.JPG|thumb|A passenger's view of Shinkansen coaches]]\n\n=== Punctuality ===\nThe Shinkansen is very reliable thanks to several factors, including its near-total separation from slower traffic. In 2016, [[JR Central]] reported that the Shinkansen's average delay from schedule per train was 24 seconds. This includes delays due to uncontrollable causes, such as natural disasters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.jr-central.co.jp/company/ir/annualreport/_pdf/annualreport2016.pdf|title=Central Japan Railway Company Annual Report 2016|page=18|accessdate=24 July 2016}}</ref> The record, in 1997, was 18 seconds.\n\n=== Traction ===\nThe Shinkansen has used the [[electric multiple unit]] configuration from the outset, with the [[0 Series Shinkansen]] having all axles powered. Other railway manufacturers were traditionally reluctant, or unable to use distributed traction configurations ([[Talgo]], the German [[ICE 2]] and the French (and subsequently South Korean) [[TGV]] (and [[KTX-I]] and [[KTX-II]]) use the [[locomotive]] (also known as power car) configuration with the [[AVE Class 102]] and continues with it for the [[Talgo AVRIL]] on account of the fact that it is not possible to use powered bogies as part of Talgo's bogie design, which uses a modified [[Jacobs bogie]] with a single axle instead of two and allows the wheels to rotate independently of each other, on the ICE 2, TGV and KTX it is because it easily allows for a high ride quality and less electrical equipment.<ref>http://www.ejrcf.or.jp/jrtr/jrtr17/pdf/f40_technology.pdf</ref>) In Japan, significant engineering desirability exists for the electric multiple unit configuration. A greater proportion of motored axles results in higher acceleration, meaning that the Shinkansen does not lose as much time if stopping frequently. Shinkansen lines have more stops in proportion to their lengths than high-speed lines elsewhere in the world.\n\n=== Safety record ===\nOver the Shinkansen's 50-plus year history, carrying over 10&nbsp;billion passengers, there have been no passenger fatalities due to train accidents such as derailments or collisions,<ref name=\"Safety\"/> despite frequent earthquakes and typhoons. Injuries and a single fatality have been caused by doors closing on passengers or their belongings; attendants are employed at platforms to prevent such accidents.<ref>{{citation |url= https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2001/03/08/national/railway-to-pay-for-1995-fatality/ |newspaper=[[The Japan Times]] |date=March 8, 2001 |title= Railway to pay for 1995 fatality; Shinkansen victim's parents win 49 million yen in damages  }}</ref> There have, however, been suicides by passengers jumping both from and in front of moving trains.<ref name=\"fact\">{{cite web|url=http://factsanddetails.com/japan.php?itemid=852&catid=23&subcatid=153|title=Shinkansen (Japanese Bullet Trains) and Maglev Magnetic Trains |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130122174638/http://factsanddetails.com/japan.php?itemid=852&catid=23&subcatid=153 |archivedate=22 January 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 30 June 2015, a passenger committed suicide on board a Shinkansen train by setting himself on fire, killing another passenger and seriously injuring seven other people.<ref name=BBC33322794>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-33322794 |title=Japan bullet train passenger starts fire injuring eight |work=BBC News Online |accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere have been two derailments of Shinkansen trains in passenger service.

Shinkansen lines, particularly in the very crowded coastal [[Taiheiy\u014d Belt]] [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]], met two primary goals:\n\n* Shinkansen trains reduced the congestion burden on regional transportation by increasing throughput on a minimal land footprint, therefore being economically preferable compared to modes (such as airports or highways) common in less densely populated regions of the world. \n* As rail was already the primary urban mode of passenger travel, from that perspective it was akin to a [[sunk cost]]; there was not a significant number of motorists to convince to switch modes. The initial megalopolitan Shinkansen lines were profitable and paid for themselves. Connectivity rejuvenated rural towns such as [[Kakegawa, Shizuoka|Kakegawa]] that would otherwise be too distant from major cities.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\nHowever, upon the introduction of the 1973 Basic Plan the initial prudence in developing Shinkansen lines gave way to political considerations to extend the mode to far less populated regions of the country, partly to spread these benefits beyond the key centres of [[Kant\u014d region|Kanto]] and [[Kinki]]. Although in some cases regional extension was frustrated by protracted land acquisition issues (sometimes influenced by the cancellation of the Narita Shinkansen following fierce protests by locals), over time Shinkansen lines were built to relatively sparsely populated areas with the intent the network would disperse the population away from the capital.\n\nSuch expansion had a significant cost. JNR, the national railway company, was already burdened with subsidizing unprofitable rural and regional railways. Additionally it assumed Shinkansen construction debt to the point the government corporation eventually owed some {{JPY|28 trillion}}, contributing to it being regionalised and privatized in 1987.<ref name=\"jrtr-kakumoto\">{{cite web |url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/F23_Kakumoto.html |title=Sensible Politics and Transport Theories? |publisher=Jrtr.net |accessdate=30 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606151933/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr22/F23_Kakumoto.html |archive-date=6 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The privatized JRs eventually paid a total of {{JPY|9.2 trillion}} to acquire JNR's Shinkansen network.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\nFollowing privatization, the JR group of companies have continued Shinkansen network expansion to less populated areas, but with far more flexibility to [[Corporate spin-off|spin off]] unprofitable railways or cut costs than in JNR days. Currently an important factor is the post [[Japanese asset price bubble|bubble]] [[zero interest-rate policy]] that allows JR to borrow huge sums of capital without significant concern regarding [[Amortization schedule|repayment timing]].\n\n=== Environmental impact ===\nTraveling by the Tokaido Shinkansen from Tokyo to Osaka produces only around 16% of the [[carbon dioxide]] of the equivalent journey by car, a saving of 15,000 tons of {{co2}} per year.<ref name=\"jrtr-okada\"/>\n\n== Challenges encountered ==\n\n=== Noise pollution ===\n[[Noise pollution]] concerns mean that increasing speed is becoming more difficult. In Japan, the [[population density]] is high and there have been severe protests against the Shinkansen's noise pollution, meaning that its noise is now limited to less than 70 [[Decibel|dB]] in residential areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.env.go.jp/kijun/oto3.html |title=\u65b0\u5e79\u7dda\u9244\u9053\u9a12\u97f3\u306b\u4fc2\u308b\u74b0\u5883\u57fa\u6e96\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\uff08\u662d\u548c50\u5e74\u74b0\u5883\u5e81\u544a\u793a\uff09 The Environmental Regulation of Shinkansen Noise Pollution (1975, Environmental Agency) (Japanese) |publisher=Env.go.jp |date= |accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref>\nHence, improvement and reduction of the [[pantograph (rail)|pantograph]], weight saving of cars, and construction of [[noise barrier]]s and other measures have been implemented. Current research is primarily aimed at reducing operational noise, particularly the [[Piston effect#Tunnel boom|tunnel boom]] phenomenon caused when trains transit tunnels at high speed.\n\n=== Earthquake ===\nBecause of the risk of earthquakes, the Urgent Earthquake Detection and Alarm System (UrEDAS) ([[earthquake warning system]]) was introduced in 1992. It enables automatic braking of bullet trains in the case of large earthquakes.\n\n=== Heavy snow ===\nThe [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] often experiences heavy snow in the area around [[Maibara Station]] in winter. Trains have to reduce speed, which can disrupt the timetable. Sprinkler systems were later installed, but delays of 10 to 20 minutes still occur during snowy weather. Additionally, treefalls related to excess snow have caused service interruptions. Along the route of the [[J\u014detsu Shinkansen]], winter snow can be very heavy, with snow depths of two to three metres, so the line is equipped with stronger sprinklers and [[Ballastless track|slab track]], to mitigate the effects of deep snow.\n\n== Ridership ==\n\n===Annual===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|+  Annual ridership figures for selected years (in million of passengers)<ref name=\"mlit\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/10/10a0excel.html |title=\u56fd\u571f\u4ea4\u901a\u7701\u9244\u9053\u8f38\u9001\u7d71\u8a08\u5e74\u5831\uff08\u5e73\u621019\u5e74\u5ea6\uff09 |access-date=19 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514103232/http://www.mlit.go.jp/k-toukei/10/10a0excel.html |archive-date=14 May 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n! !!

Shinkansen services to these lines traverse the [[Tohoku Shinkansen]] line from Tokyo before branching off to traditional main lines. On both the Yamagata/Shinjo and Akita lines, the narrow gauge lines were regauged, resulting in the local services being operated by [[701 series#701-5000 series|standard gauge versions]] of 1,067&nbsp;mm gauge suburban/interurban rolling stock. On the Akita line between Omagari and Akita, one of the two narrow gauge lines was regauged, and a section of the remaining narrow gauge line is dual gauge, providing the opportunity for Shinkansen services to pass each other without stopping.\n\nThe maximum speed on these lines is 130&nbsp;km/h, however the overall travel time to/from Tokyo is improved due to the elimination of the need for passengers to change trains at [[Fukushima, Fukushima|Fukushima]] and [[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]] respectively.\n\nAs the [[Loading gauge]] (size of the train that can travel on a line) was not altered when the rail gauge was widened, only Shinkansen trains specially built for these routes can travel on the lines. At present they are the E3 and E6 series trains.\n\nWhilst no further Mini-shinkansen routes have been proposed to date, it remains an option for providing Shinkansen services to cities on the narrow gauge network.\n\n=== Gauge Change Train ===\n{{Main|Gauge Change Train}}\n\nThis is the name for the concept of using a single train that is specially designed to travel on both {{RailGauge|1067mm}} narrow gauge railway lines and the {{RailGauge|1435mm}} standard gauge used by Shinkansen train services in Japan. The trucks/bogies of the Gauge Change Train (GCT) allow the wheels to be unlocked from the axles, narrowed or widened as necessary, and then relocked. This allows a GCT to traverse both standard gauge and narrow gauge tracks without the expense of regauging lines.\n\nThree test trains have been constructed, with the second set having completed reliability trials on the [[Yosan Line]] east of [[Matsuyama, Ehime|Matsuyama]] (in [[Shikoku]]) in September 2013.

While no construction work was ever started, land along the proposed track, including an underground section leading to Shinjuku Station, remains reserved. If capacity on the current Tokyo\u2013\u014cmiya section proves insufficient, at some point, construction of the Shinjuku\u2013\u014cmiya link may be reconsidered.\n\nThe [[Narita Shinkansen]] project to connect Tokyo to [[Narita International Airport]], initiated in the 1970s but halted in 1983 after landowner protests, has been officially cancelled and removed from the Basic Plan governing Shinkansen construction. Parts of its planned right-of-way were used by the [[Narita Sky Access Line]] which opened in 2010. Although the Sky Access Line uses standard-gauge track, it was not built to Shinkansen specifications and there are no plans to convert it into a full Shinkansen line.\n\nIn December 2009, then transport minister [[Seiji Maehara]] proposed a bullet train link to [[Haneda Airport]], using an existing spur that connects the [[T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen]] to a train depot.

has several advantages, including scheduling frequency and flexibility, punctual operation, comfortable seats, and convenient city-centre terminals.\n\nShinkansen fares are generally competitive with domestic air fares. From a speed and convenience perspective, the Shinkansen's market share has surpassed that of air travel for journeys of less than 750&nbsp;km, while air and rail remain highly competitive with each other in the 800\u2013900&nbsp;km range and air has a higher market share for journeys of more than 1,000&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shiomi|first1=Eiji|title=Do Faster Trains Challenge Air Carriers?|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr19/F04_Shiomi.html|website=Japan Railway & Transport Review|accessdate=7 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930083648/http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr19/F04_Shiomi.html|archive-date=30 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n* Tokyo \u2013 Nagoya (342&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Sendai (325&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 [[Hanamaki, Iwate|Hanamaki]] ([[Morioka, Iwate|Morioka]]) (496&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Niigata (300&nbsp;km): There were air services between these cities, but they were withdrawn after Shinkansen services started. Shinkansen runs between these cities in about two hours or less.\n* Tokyo \u2013 Osaka (515&nbsp;km): Shinkansen is dominant because of fast (2 hours 22 minutes) and frequent service (up to every 10 minutes by ''Nozomi''); however, air travel has a certain share (~20\u201330%).\n* Tokyo \u2013 Okayama (676&nbsp;km), Tokyo \u2013 Hiroshima (821&nbsp;km): Shinkansen is reported to have increased its market share from ~40% to ~60% over the last decade.<ref name=\"asia.nikkei.com\">{{cite web |url=http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Japanese-airlines-facing-threat-from-below |title=Japanese airlines facing threat from below- Nikkei Asian Review |publisher=Asia.nikkei.com |date=25 November 2013 |accessdate=7 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301141326/http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Trends/Japanese-airlines-facing-threat-from-below |archive-date=1 March 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Shinkansen takes about three to four hours and there are ''Nozomi'' trains every 30 minutes, but airlines may provide cheaper fares, attracting price-conscious passengers.\n* Tokyo \u2013 Fukuoka (1,069&nbsp;km): The Shinkansen takes about five hours on the fastest ''Nozomi'', and discount carriers have made air travel far cheaper, so most people choose air. Additionally, unlike many cities, there is very little convenience advantage for the location of the Shinkansen stations of the two cities as [[Fukuoka Airport]] is located near the central [[Tenjin, Fukuoka|Tenjin]] district, and [[Fukuoka City Subway]] [[K\u016bk\u014d Line (Fukuoka City Subway)|Line 1]] connects the Airport and Tenjin via Hakata Station and [[Haneda Airport]] is similarly conveniently located.\n* Osaka \u2013 Fukuoka (554&nbsp;km): One of the most competitive sections. The Shinkansen takes about two and a half hours by ''Nozomi'' or ''Mizuho'', and the JR West ''Hikari Rail Star'' or JR West/JR Kyushu ''Sakura'' trains operate twice an hour, taking about 2 hours and 40 minutes between the two cities. Again the location of the airports involved helps with the popularity of air travel.\n* Tokyo \u2013 Aomori (675&nbsp;km): The fastest Shinkansen service between these cities is 3 hours.

Probably, the most famous legend is that of the fiery-haired virgin girl who saved Baku's people from slavery. The epic shows roots to Azerbaijan's Zoroastrian believes and culture and has reached down to modern times.\n\n[[File:Sokolova% 20mitra% 207% 205.jpg|thumb|Baku's Holy Fire Temple- Tower (Maiden Tower), reconstruction by Davud Akhundov, The Architecture of Ancient and Early Medieval Azerbaijan, book, in Russian, Baku, 1986]]\n\n===The legend of the fiery-haired girl===\n\nOnce upon a time, there was an ancient town-fortress of Baku. The fortress had a Fire Temple-Tower. In very ancient times, an enemy encircled the fortress. The enemy ordered Baku's people to surrender but they refused. So the enemy launched a siege to demolish the fortress and capture all inhabitants as slaves. Many fortress' defenders died trying to stop enemy attacks. Meanwhile, the enemy's commander ordered the water supply lines to be cut. So everybody was thirsty inside the fortress. No water no food, only blood and death. And the Supreme [[Magi]], together with other priests, prayed to the Holy Fire in the fortress' Fire Temple-Tower, asking the God of [[Ahura Mazda]] to help the people. They prayed day and night asking Ahura Mazda to save their life and to push the enemy back. Finally, he heard their prayers. On the next day, the people saw that a large piece of the Holy Fire fell down from the top of the Fire Temple-Tower. A beautiful girl came out from the fire. She had long fire-colored hair. The crowd went down on their knees and started to pray to her. She said: \"Don't worry. I'll help and protect you. Give me a sword and a helmet. The enemy should not see my girl's hair, open a fortress' gate\". Meanwhile, the enemy's commander was waiting outside for the fortress' pahlevan for one-to-one combat. If the fortress' pahlevan had won the fight, then the enemy's army would back away. But if the enemy won, they would capture the fortress and all surviving inhabitants would be slaves. The fortress' gate was opened and the enemy's commander saw that one pahlevan was coming to fight him. The heavy battle began. In one of God's blessed moments, the fortress' pahlevan unhorsed the enemy and put a knife direct to his neck. The enemy's commander screamed: \"You win! Who are you? Take your helmet off. I want to see your face, pahlevan!\" He took off the helmet and saw that the fortress' pahlevan was a beautiful girl with long fire-colored hair. He exclaimed: \"Oh, you are a girl! You are brave and beautiful girl! If girls of Baku are so brave, I'll never capture your fortress! Don't kill me, beauty!\" He fell in love with her for her beauty and bravery. He asked her to marry him. Of course, the girl did not kill him. She fell in love with him too for his open heart. Thus, the enemy did not capture Baku and the local people named a tower as the Maiden tower.<ref name=\"azglobalcontext.org\">Mahir Khalifa-zadeh and Leyla Khalifazadeh, The Legend of Baku Maiden Tower (Zoroastrian legends), http://www.azglobalcontext.org/2017/02/the-legend-of-baku-maiden-tower_17.html</ref>\n[[File:Tahir Salakhov Maiden Tower.jpg|thumb|Maiden Tower, painting, Tahir Salahov]]\n\n===The legend of why Baku tower's fires stopped burning===\nThe next legend also has Zoroastrian roots:\n\nOnce upon a time, an enemy besieged the fortress of Baku. However, Baku's people refused the enemy's request surrender. They decided to fight and defend their lives and fortress. So Baku's people fought with great bravery but the situation inside the fortress became more and more perilous. The enemy implemented a tight siege to overthrow the defenders. The enemy cut the water supply. With no water and food, the defenders did not have any chance of survival. Meanwhile, Supreme Magi with other priests prayed in the fortress' Holy Fire Temple-Tower. All together, they prayed to God of Ahura Mazda asking him to protect and help the people. After several days of non-stop praying, He heard priests' blessings and prayers. A strong and devastating earthquake occurred. Thousand of enemies perished as a result and some survivors, ran away. Thus, the people of Baku escaped slavery but the Holy Fires were stopped on the top of the Fire Temple-Tower.<ref>Mahir Khalifa-zadeh, On the Problem of Ancient Baku's Location, edited by Prof Ziya Bunyatov, Newspaper Bakinsky Rabochiy, in Russian, Baku, Nov 24, 1988,https://ca.linkedin.com/in/prof-mahir-khalifa-zadeh-02a43844{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Source of the name \"Maiden Tower\"===\n\nProf Mahir Khalifa-zadeh believes that apart from legends, it has been difficult to find historical explanations or archaeological or written evidence as to why the tower was called the Maiden tower. In addition to epical backgrounds, it is believable that the word \"maiden\" means that the tower was not destroyed by any enemy and thus means (from the religious viewpoint) that it was never desecrated (touched) by the evil of [[Angra Mainyu]] and remains the \"virgin\" or \"maiden\" temple-tower of the Zoroastrianian God, [[Ahura Mazda]].<ref name=\"azglobalcontext.org\"/>\n\n==Architecture==\n\n[[File:Mahir Khalifa-zadeh.jpg|thumb|Baku's Holy Fire Temple-Tower, reconstruction, by Davud Akhundov, The Architecture of Ancient and Early Medieval Azerbaijan, book, in Russian, Baku, Azerbaijan]]\n\n[[File:Maiden towers entry old city baku azerbaijan.jpg|thumb|right|The entrance]]\n[[File:Baku Maiden Tower 2010.jpg|thumb|Architectural details of the Maiden Tower]]\nThe tower has been described as the \"most majestic and mysterious monument of Baku, the Gyz Galasy\", built on solid rock foundation, demonstrates right on the coast line, a fusion of Arabic, Persian and Ottoman influences. It was constructed alongside a natural oil well.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FZ2_aYHMl4IC&pg=PA53|title=Peoples of Western Asia|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|page=53|year=2006|isbn=0-7614-7677-6}}</ref> It is a cylindrical eight story structure that rises to a height of {{convert|29.5|m|ft}} with a base diameter of {{convert|16.5|m|ft}}. The internal space available in the tower is said to be adequate to accommodate 200 people. A long solid projection to the main tower faces east, which is oriented towards sunrise pointing to the equinoxes, which has led to the conclusion that it was built as an astronomical tower; while the buttress faces east, the door access to the tower faces southeast. Each floor of the tower has a shallow vaulted roof, \"a stone cupola\" that has a central opening. The thickness of the walls varies from {{convert|5|m|ft}} at the base tapering cylindrically to {{convert|3.2|-|4.2|m|ft}} at the top floors. All floors are connected by staircase which abuts the circular wall and are lighted by narrow windows or niches which flare inward. The structure built in stone masonry exhibits varying finished surfaces, which is inlaid with local grey limestone. The alternate courses of stone laid in [[gypsum]] plaster gives a black and white banded effect. The northwestern part of the tower retains the original surface finish. There is also a beak-like projection, a buttress, curved in shape, made in masonry. The earliest stonework has square corners.<ref name=evaluation/><ref name=Tower>{{Cite web|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai143_folder/143_articles/143_mt_secrets.html|title=Secrets of the Maiden Tower:What They Reveal about Early Man's Beliefs|author= Ronnie Gallagher and Betty Blair |accessdate= November 25, 2010|publisher=Azerbaijan International}}</ref><ref name=Maiden>{{Cite web|url=http://www.window2baku.com/eng/9devbashnya.htm|title=The Maiden Tower|accessdate=November 27, 2010|publisher=Window to Baku}}</ref>\n\nA detailed examination of the construction features of the tower by archaeologists suggests that the stone masonry, both on its interior and exterior surfaces, is diamond-shaped and is seen at the top as well as at the bottom of the tower wall. The diamond-shaped cut seen as a decorative feature, particularly on the outer face of the west side wall, is ornate at the top and plain at the bottom of the wall; a subtle feature noted throughout the tower suggests that it was built as one monolith unit at one period. However, the recent renovations are stated to be crude.<ref name=Tower/>\n\n;Water Well\nAnother notable structure seen in the tower is a water well of {{convert|0.7|m|ft}} diameter, which is {{convert|21|m|ft}} deep (its depth is up to the [[aquifer]]) that has been discovered at the second floor of the tower. It has an entrance also at the ground level which was discovered by Archaeologist Abbas Islamov during a recent study of the tower. This well has been interpreted as rainwater harvesting structure and the water is said to be clean and fresh (though close to the sea). The ceramic pipe ({{convert|30|cm|in}} in diameter) plumbing seen running down from the niches of the tower into the well was meant as a supply source. Since the ancient plumbing system is said to be in its original form, it needs to be cleaned and its layout ascertained by further studies to describe the drainage network that was originally built as part of the tower. The ceramics of the plumbing system and the silt deposited in them could also help to fix the age of the tower by using thermo-luminescence technique.<ref name=Tower/><ref name=Maiden/>\n\nAlso seen in the tower, between the 2nd floor and the 7th floor, is a gutter of semicircular shape at every floor. It is made of ceramic pipes fitted one above another and joined by lime mortar. The pipes are presumably produced with the potter's wheel technique. They are {{convert|20|-|25|cm|in}} in diameter with {{convert|2.2|cm|in}} thick walls and each segment is {{convert|40|-|45|cm|in}} long. Similar gutters are seen from the ground floor up to the foundation level but with the four cornered ceramic pipes of {{convert|22|cm|in}} \u00d7 {{convert|18|cm|in}} size, which run outside through the wall.<ref name=vision/>\n\n==Restoration==\nSubsequent to the declaration of the entire cultural property including the tower and the city walls as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], in 2000, there was an earthquake which caused damage to the property. UNESCO, noting the lack of efforts by the national authorities to adequately conserve this cultural heritage then listed these monuments under the \"[[List of World Heritage in Danger]],\" from 2004 to 2009 with the comment \"Loss of authenticity due in part to the earthquake in 2000 and to the urban development pressures.\" However, after the concerned authorities evolved a Conservation Master Plan and assured of adequate conservation and management of the property, the \"in danger\" tag attached to the heritage site has been removed by UNESCO in 2009. It was also requested that the State Party would submit to the World Heritage Centre, by 1 February 2010, an updated report on the state of conservation of the property and progress made for consideration by the World Heritage Committee at its 34th session in 2010.<ref name=World/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/642|title=Decision \u2013 27COM 7B.59 \u2013 Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace and Maiden Tower (Azerbaijan)|publisher=Unesco.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/170|title=Decision \u2013 28COM 15A.29|publisher=Unesco.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/347|title=Decides to retain the Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace and Maiden Tower (Azerbaijan) on the List of World Heritage in Danger| publisher=Unesco.org}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe legendary tale of the king willing to force his daughter to marry a man she doesn't love, which she escapes by asking her father to first build a tower for her, and when it is finished committing suicide by jumping from the top of it has been the subject of many Azerbaijani poems and plays. However, the ballet titled \u201cMaiden Tower\", was the first Azerbaijani ballet composed by Afrasiyyab Badalbayli, in 1940. This ballet is performed at Baku's Opera and Ballet Theatre. However, the story line is a modified version of the legend. According to the modified version of the Ballet, the king on his return from his war campaign found that his wife had given birth to a daughter instead of a son. He became furious and ordered killing of his baby daughter. However, the baby's nanny took her away to a secret place where she grew up to a beautiful lady. At age seventeen she got engaged to a lover. At this juncture, the king chanced to see her, wanted to marry her and therefore took her away and kept her in the Maiden Tower. The girl's lover was furious with this turn of events and he managed to kill the king. He then ran to the Maiden Tower to rescue his lover. However, when the girl heard sound of foot steps approaching towards the tower, she thought that it was the king coming to see her and she immediately committed suicide by jumping down from the tower.<ref name=vision/><ref name=Maiden/>\n\nAs of 2011, the tower also participates in \"[[Earth Hour]],\" a campaign against climate change in which large buildings \"go dark\" for an hour to draw awareness to the cause.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rustamov |first=Elshan |title=\u0414\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447\u044c\u044f \u0431\u0430\u0448\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0430\u0441 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0434\u044b |url=http://www.1news.az/society/20110324035120563.html |publisher=1news.az |accessdate=26 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110326054316/http://www.1news.az/society/20110324035120563.html |archivedate=26 March 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Picture gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"120px\">\nFile:Maidentt.jpg|The Maiden Tower in old town Baku.\nFile:Torre de la Doncella, Baku, Azerbaiy\u00e1n, 2016-09-26, DD 215-217 HDR.jpg|Illuminated Maiden Tower\nFile:Giz galasi.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape]]\n* [[Fire Temple of Baku]]\n* [[List of World Heritage Sites in Azerbaijan]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Maiden Tower}}\n* [http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai143_folder/143_articles/143_mt_secrets.html Secrets of the Maiden Tower.

However, the main mystery is: the Tower's design and purpose. Meanwhile, there are up to 20 legends related to Baku Maiden Tower. A large number of them are connected to the [[Islam]]ic and [[Medieval]] period of Baku's history. But others are rooted deeply in Azerbaijan's<ref>Azerbaijan. Pre-Islamic History, Encyclopedia Iranica, http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/azerbaijan-iii</ref> Zoroastrian or pre-Islamic history, religion and culture. Probably, the most famous legend is that of the fiery-haired virgin girl who saved Baku's people from slavery. The epic shows roots to Azerbaijan's Zoroastrian believes and culture and has reached down to modern times.\n\n[[File:Sokolova% 20mitra% 207% 205.jpg|thumb|Baku's Holy Fire Temple- Tower (Maiden Tower), reconstruction by Davud Akhundov, The Architecture of Ancient and Early Medieval Azerbaijan, book, in Russian, Baku, 1986]]\n\n===The legend of the fiery-haired girl===\n\nOnce upon a time, there was an ancient town-fortress of Baku. The fortress had a Fire Temple-Tower. In very ancient times, an enemy encircled the fortress. The enemy ordered Baku's people to surrender but they refused. So the enemy launched a siege to demolish the fortress and capture all inhabitants as slaves. Many fortress' defenders died trying to stop enemy attacks. Meanwhile, the enemy's commander ordered the water supply lines to be cut. So everybody was thirsty inside the fortress. No water no food, only blood and death. And the Supreme [[Magi]], together with other priests, prayed to the Holy Fire in the fortress' Fire Temple-Tower, asking the God of [[Ahura Mazda]] to help the people. They prayed day and night asking Ahura Mazda to save their life and to push the enemy back. Finally, he heard their prayers. On the next day, the people saw that a large piece of the Holy Fire fell down from the top of the Fire Temple-Tower. A beautiful girl came out from the fire. She had long fire-colored hair. The crowd went down on their knees and started to pray to her. She said: \"Don't worry. I'll help and protect you. Give me a sword and a helmet. The enemy should not see my girl's hair, open a fortress' gate\". Meanwhile, the enemy's commander was waiting outside for the fortress' pahlevan for one-to-one combat. If the fortress' pahlevan had won the fight, then the enemy's army would back away. But if the enemy won, they would capture the fortress and all surviving inhabitants would be slaves. The fortress' gate was opened and the enemy's commander saw that one pahlevan was coming to fight him. The heavy battle began. In one of God's blessed moments, the fortress' pahlevan unhorsed the enemy and put a knife direct to his neck. The enemy's commander screamed: \"You win! Who are you? Take your helmet off. I want to see your face, pahlevan!\" He took off the helmet and saw that the fortress' pahlevan was a beautiful girl with long fire-colored hair. He exclaimed: \"Oh, you are a girl! You are brave and beautiful girl! If girls of Baku are so brave, I'll never capture your fortress! Don't kill me, beauty!\" He fell in love with her for her beauty and bravery. He asked her to marry him. Of course, the girl did not kill him. She fell in love with him too for his open heart. Thus, the enemy did not capture Baku and the local people named a tower as the Maiden tower.<ref name=\"azglobalcontext.org\">Mahir Khalifa-zadeh and Leyla Khalifazadeh, The Legend of Baku Maiden Tower (Zoroastrian legends), http://www.azglobalcontext.org/2017/02/the-legend-of-baku-maiden-tower_17.html</ref>\n[[File:Tahir Salakhov Maiden Tower.jpg|thumb|Maiden Tower, painting, Tahir Salahov]]\n\n===The legend of why Baku tower's fires stopped burning===\nThe next legend also has Zoroastrian roots:\n\nOnce upon a time, an enemy besieged the fortress of Baku. However, Baku's people refused the enemy's request surrender. They decided to fight and defend their lives and fortress. So Baku's people fought with great bravery but the situation inside the fortress became more and more perilous. The enemy implemented a tight siege to overthrow the defenders. The enemy cut the water supply. With no water and food, the defenders did not have any chance of survival. Meanwhile, Supreme Magi with other priests prayed in the fortress' Holy Fire Temple-Tower. All together, they prayed to God of Ahura Mazda asking him to protect and help the people. After several days of non-stop praying, He heard priests' blessings and prayers. A strong and devastating earthquake occurred. Thousand of enemies perished as a result and some survivors, ran away. Thus, the people of Baku escaped slavery but the Holy Fires were stopped on the top of the Fire Temple-Tower.<ref>Mahir Khalifa-zadeh, On the Problem of Ancient Baku's Location, edited by Prof Ziya Bunyatov, Newspaper Bakinsky Rabochiy, in Russian, Baku, Nov 24, 1988,https://ca.linkedin.com/in/prof-mahir-khalifa-zadeh-02a43844{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Source of the name \"Maiden Tower\"===\n\nProf Mahir Khalifa-zadeh believes that apart from legends, it has been difficult to find historical explanations or archaeological or written evidence as to why the tower was called the Maiden tower. In addition to epical backgrounds, it is believable that the word \"maiden\" means that the tower was not destroyed by any enemy and thus means (from the religious viewpoint) that it was never desecrated (touched) by the evil of [[Angra Mainyu]] and remains the \"virgin\" or \"maiden\" temple-tower of the Zoroastrianian God, [[Ahura Mazda]].<ref name=\"azglobalcontext.org\"/>\n\n==Architecture==\n\n[[File:Mahir Khalifa-zadeh.jpg|thumb|Baku's Holy Fire Temple-Tower, reconstruction, by Davud Akhundov, The Architecture of Ancient and Early Medieval Azerbaijan, book, in Russian, Baku, Azerbaijan]]\n\n[[File:Maiden towers entry old city baku azerbaijan.jpg|thumb|right|The entrance]]\n[[File:Baku Maiden Tower 2010.jpg|thumb|Architectural details of the Maiden Tower]]\nThe tower has been described as the \"most majestic and mysterious monument of Baku, the Gyz Galasy\", built on solid rock foundation, demonstrates right on the coast line, a fusion of Arabic, Persian and Ottoman influences. It was constructed alongside a natural oil well.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FZ2_aYHMl4IC&pg=PA53|title=Peoples of Western Asia|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Corporation|page=53|year=2006|isbn=0-7614-7677-6}}</ref> It is a cylindrical eight story structure that rises to a height of {{convert|29.5|m|ft}} with a base diameter of {{convert|16.5|m|ft}}. The internal space available in the tower is said to be adequate to accommodate 200 people. A long solid projection to the main tower faces east, which is oriented towards sunrise pointing to the equinoxes, which has led to the conclusion that it was built as an astronomical tower; while the buttress faces east, the door access to the tower faces southeast. Each floor of the tower has a shallow vaulted roof, \"a stone cupola\" that has a central opening. The thickness of the walls varies from {{convert|5|m|ft}} at the base tapering cylindrically to {{convert|3.2|-|4.2|m|ft}} at the top floors. All floors are connected by staircase which abuts the circular wall and are lighted by narrow windows or niches which flare inward. The structure built in stone masonry exhibits varying finished surfaces, which is inlaid with local grey limestone. The alternate courses of stone laid in [[gypsum]] plaster gives a black and white banded effect. The northwestern part of the tower retains the original surface finish. There is also a beak-like projection, a buttress, curved in shape, made in masonry. The earliest stonework has square corners.<ref name=evaluation/><ref name=Tower>{{Cite web|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai143_folder/143_articles/143_mt_secrets.html|title=Secrets of the Maiden Tower:What They Reveal about Early Man's Beliefs|author= Ronnie Gallagher and Betty Blair |accessdate= November 25, 2010|publisher=Azerbaijan International}}</ref><ref name=Maiden>{{Cite web|url=http://www.window2baku.com/eng/9devbashnya.htm|title=The Maiden Tower|accessdate=November 27, 2010|publisher=Window to Baku}}</ref>\n\nA detailed examination of the construction features of the tower by archaeologists suggests that the stone masonry, both on its interior and exterior surfaces, is diamond-shaped and is seen at the top as well as at the bottom of the tower wall. The diamond-shaped cut seen as a decorative feature, particularly on the outer face of the west side wall, is ornate at the top and plain at the bottom of the wall; a subtle feature noted throughout the tower suggests that it was built as one monolith unit at one period. However, the recent renovations are stated to be crude.<ref name=Tower/>\n\n;Water Well\nAnother notable structure seen in the tower is a water well of {{convert|0.7|m|ft}} diameter, which is {{convert|21|m|ft}} deep (its depth is up to the [[aquifer]]) that has been discovered at the second floor of the tower. It has an entrance also at the ground level which was discovered by Archaeologist Abbas Islamov during a recent study of the tower. This well has been interpreted as rainwater harvesting structure and the water is said to be clean and fresh (though close to the sea). The ceramic pipe ({{convert|30|cm|in}} in diameter) plumbing seen running down from the niches of the tower into the well was meant as a supply source. Since the ancient plumbing system is said to be in its original form, it needs to be cleaned and its layout ascertained by further studies to describe the drainage network that was originally built as part of the tower. The ceramics of the plumbing system and the silt deposited in them could also help to fix the age of the tower by using thermo-luminescence technique.<ref name=Tower/><ref name=Maiden/>\n\nAlso seen in the tower, between the 2nd floor and the 7th floor, is a gutter of semicircular shape at every floor. It is made of ceramic pipes fitted one above another and joined by lime mortar. The pipes are presumably produced with the potter's wheel technique. They are {{convert|20|-|25|cm|in}} in diameter with {{convert|2.2|cm|in}} thick walls and each segment is {{convert|40|-|45|cm|in}} long. Similar gutters are seen from the ground floor up to the foundation level but with the four cornered ceramic pipes of {{convert|22|cm|in}} \u00d7 {{convert|18|cm|in}} size, which run outside through the wall.<ref name=vision/>\n\n==Restoration==\nSubsequent to the declaration of the entire cultural property including the tower and the city walls as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], in 2000, there was an earthquake which caused damage to the property. UNESCO, noting the lack of efforts by the national authorities to adequately conserve this cultural heritage then listed these monuments under the \"[[List of World Heritage in Danger]],\" from 2004 to 2009 with the comment \"Loss of authenticity due in part to the earthquake in 2000 and to the urban development pressures.\" However, after the concerned authorities evolved a Conservation Master Plan and assured of adequate conservation and management of the property, the \"in danger\" tag attached to the heritage site has been removed by UNESCO in 2009. It was also requested that the State Party would submit to the World Heritage Centre, by 1 February 2010, an updated report on the state of conservation of the property and progress made for consideration by the World Heritage Committee at its 34th session in 2010.<ref name=World/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/642|title=Decision \u2013 27COM 7B.59 \u2013 Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace and Maiden Tower (Azerbaijan)|publisher=Unesco.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/170|title=Decision \u2013 28COM 15A.29|publisher=Unesco.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/decisions/347|title=Decides to retain the Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace and Maiden Tower (Azerbaijan) on the List of World Heritage in Danger| publisher=Unesco.org}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe legendary tale of the king willing to force his daughter to marry a man she doesn't love, which she escapes by asking her father to first build a tower for her, and when it is finished committing suicide by jumping from the top of it has been the subject of many Azerbaijani poems and plays. However, the ballet titled \u201cMaiden Tower\", was the first Azerbaijani ballet composed by Afrasiyyab Badalbayli, in 1940. This ballet is performed at Baku's Opera and Ballet Theatre. However, the story line is a modified version of the legend. According to the modified version of the Ballet, the king on his return from his war campaign found that his wife had given birth to a daughter instead of a son. He became furious and ordered killing of his baby daughter. However, the baby's nanny took her away to a secret place where she grew up to a beautiful lady. At age seventeen she got engaged to a lover. At this juncture, the king chanced to see her, wanted to marry her and therefore took her away and kept her in the Maiden Tower. The girl's lover was furious with this turn of events and he managed to kill the king. He then ran to the Maiden Tower to rescue his lover. However, when the girl heard sound of foot steps approaching towards the tower, she thought that it was the king coming to see her and she immediately committed suicide by jumping down from the tower.<ref name=vision/><ref name=Maiden/>\n\nAs of 2011, the tower also participates in \"[[Earth Hour]],\" a campaign against climate change in which large buildings \"go dark\" for an hour to draw awareness to the cause.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rustamov |first=Elshan |title=\u0414\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447\u044c\u044f \u0431\u0430\u0448\u043d\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0447\u0430\u0441 \u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0434\u044b |url=http://www.1news.az/society/20110324035120563.html |publisher=1news.az |accessdate=26 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110326054316/http://www.1news.az/society/20110324035120563.html |archivedate=26 March 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Picture gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"120px\">\nFile:Maidentt.jpg|The Maiden Tower in old town Baku.\nFile:Torre de la Doncella, Baku, Azerbaiy\u00e1n, 2016-09-26, DD 215-217 HDR.jpg|Illuminated Maiden Tower\nFile:Giz galasi.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape]]\n* [[Fire Temple of Baku]]\n* [[List of World Heritage Sites in Azerbaijan]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Maiden Tower}}\n* [http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/ai143_folder/143_articles/143_mt_secrets.html Secrets of the Maiden Tower.

The dale is cut into a plateau of farmland and lies to the east of the village of [[Wormhill]]. The head of the valley leads into Peter Dale to the north. [[Millers Dale|Miller's Dale]] is at the foot of the valley to the sorth.<ref name=\"OS\">[[Ordnance Survey|OS]] ''Explorer'' map OL24W, 1:25,000 series.</ref>\n\nThe dale is named after monks of [[Lenton Priory]] (a [[Benedictines|Benedictine]] monastery in [[Nottingham]]). During the 12th-century the priory was granted the income from a large area of north Derbyshire by [[William Peverel]]. 14th-century carved stones (of the low septum, or stone screen, dividing the chancel from the nave) are all that remains of the monks' [[Monastic grange|grange]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Douglas|first=Ed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/26/country-diary-awkward-land-monks-dale-derbyshire|title=Country diary: felled by a faery sheep?|date=2018-10-26|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-02|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Godfrey|first=John Thomas|title=The history of the parish and priory of Lenton|publisher=Oxford University|year=1884|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe valley is dry over the summer but has a [[Winterbourne (stream)|winterbourne stream]] which runs into the [[River Wye, Derbyshire|River Wye]] at Miller's Dale.\n\nMonk's Dale is part of the [[Derbyshire Dales National Nature Reserve]]. [[Natural England]] manages the reserve which covers five separate dales of the [[White Peak]] ([[Lathkill Dale]], [[Cressbrook Dale]], Hay Dale, Long Dale and Monk's Dale). The reserve contains [[Fraxinus|ash]] and [[elm]] woodland and shrubs including [[Paris quadrifolia|herb Paris]], [[bird cherry]] and [[Cornus|dogwood]]. Uncommon flowers in the shady dale include [[Epipactis atrorubens|dark red helleborine]]. Native grasses include [[Helictotrichon pratense|meadow oat]], [[Carex flacca|glaucous sedge]], [[Oatgrass|oat grass]], [[Eriophorum|cottongrass]], [[Centaurea|knapweed]] and [[Bromus erectus|upright brome]].
