Moore is only the seventh ever unanimous selection.<ref name=\"preseason allamerican\"/>\n\n==Regular season==\n\n===Pre-season===\nThe Connecticut team opened the year ranked No. 1 in the ESPN Coaches poll and the AP Top 25 Poll, following a 39\u20130 record leading to a national championship in the prior season.<ref name=\"preseason polls\"/> In both cases, the polling results were unanimous. UConn graduated three seniors, Renee Montgomery, Tahirah Williams and Cassie Kerns, but only Renee was a regular starter. The team added one freshman, Kelly Faris, and Caroline Doty returned to the line-up after missing most of the prior season due to injury.\n\nThe two preseason games were wins against '''[[The College of Saint Rose|St. Rose College]]'''(85\u201344) and '''[[Vanguard University of Southern California|Vanguard]]''' (98\u201368).\n\n===Non-conference games===\nThe defending national champions opened their season against '''[[Northeastern University|Northeastern]]'''. The outcome of the game was never in doubt, with a final score of 105\u201335; the game was more about personal accomplishments than the game itself. Senior Tina Charles pulled down her 1000th career rebound while senior Kalana Greene scored her 1000th career point. The win would continue a consecutive streak started the previous year, then at 40 games.<ref name=\"Northeastern\"/>\nThe game against '''[[University of Texas at Austin|Texas]]''', played in San Antonio, the location of this season's Final Four, was expected to be competitive, as Texas was ranked tenth in the nation by the AP. However, UConn pulled out to a 21-point lead by halftime, and ended up winning by 25, 83\u201358.<ref name=\"Texas\"/>\n\nConnecticut's next game against '''[[College of the Holy Cross|Holy Cross]]''' would mark the 20th game between the two teams, an annual competition going back to the 1985\u201386 season. At the start of the series, the schools were competitive, with the teams splitting the first four meetings. However, UConn has not lost since, and entered the game with a 17\u20132 series record.<ref name=\"Holy Cross1\"/> UConn prevailed 87\u201334.<ref name=\"Holy Cross2\"/>\n\nAfter the WBCA Classic, UConn would play '''[[University of Vermont|Vermont]]'''  in a rematch of the previous year's NCAA opening round game. UConn won easily 84\u201342, on a night in which senior Tina Charles became the second leading rebounder in school history.<ref name=\"Vermont\"/>\n\nUConn's next opponent, '''[[University of Hartford|Hartford]]''', was coached by former UConn star [[Jennifer Rizzotti]]. Hartford had never beaten UConn, and this game would be no exception, with UConn winning 80\u201345 for the eleventh consecutive victory over the Hawks.<ref name=\"Hartford \"/> In the next game, UConn easily beat '''[[Iona College (New York)|Iona]]''' 90\u201335.<ref name=\"Iona\"/>\n\nThe '''[[Stanford University|Stanford]]''' game was one of the most anticipated games of the season.<ref name=\"Anticipation\"/> Both teams came into the game undefeated. UConn was ranked No. 1 in the AP writer's poll and the ESPN Coaches poll, while Stanford was ranked No. 2 in each poll.<ref name=\"Rankings\"/> Stanford's last loss was to UConn in the 2009 NCAA Final Four game, while UConn's last loss was to Stanford in the 2008 Final Four game.\nUConn hadn't been behind in a game at halftime or later all season until this game, but Stanford entered halftime with a slim two-point lead. However, after trading baskets early in the second half, UConn pulled out to a 22-point lead (74\u201352) with five minutes left in the game,<ref name=\"Play by play\"/> and coasted to their 49th consecutive victory, all of which were won with a double-digit margin.<ref name=\"Stanford\"/>\n\nUConn ended the calendar year with a 78\u201359 victory over 11th-ranked '''[[Florida State University|Florida State]]'''. The game was relatively close at halftime, 41\u201335, but UConn's Tina Charles scored 16 of her 24 points in the second half to help ensure a victory.<ref name=\"Florida State\"/>\n\nUConn took a break from conference games to play a home game against the '''[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]]'''(UNC).{{Rquote|left|The first half wasn't just the best basketball Connecticut played; it might have been the best basketball it can play.|Graham Hays|<ref name=\"Hays\"/>}} At the time, UNC was ranked seventh in the country. Despite the prospect of a close game, it was never close. Tina Charles scored 25 points in the first half, single-handedly outscoring the entire UNC team. UConn lead at halftime 56\u201324, and go on to win by 41 points, 88\u201347. ESPN's Graham Hays called \"the first-half play as good as it gets\".<ref name=\"UNC\"/>\n\nConnecticut had played [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] teams Florida State and North Carolina; on 18 January, they would play their third ACC team of the season, '''[[Duke University|Duke]]'''. Just as North Carolina had been ranked seventh at the time of the game, the Duke team was the seventh ranked team in the country. The margin of victory would not be as large as the UNC game, but it was still a convincing win, with UConn outscoring Duke 81\u201348. In contrast to the UNC game in which the first half was decision, Duke would remain reasonably close at halftime, down only ten, 38\u201328, but UConn would stretch out the lead in the second half. Maya Moore hit six three point field goals in the game, and Kalana Greene scored 18 points.<ref name=\"Duke\"/>\n\nConnecticut faced [[Oklahoma Sooners women's basketball|Oklahoma]] in a late, out-of-conference match-up on the 15th of February. Oklahoma was ranked 12th in the nation, but UConn had faced higher ranked opponents, and won relatively easily. Midway through the first half, it appeared UConn was heading for another easy win, as they had doubled the Sooners score 24\u201312. However, Oklahoma brought the game back to a two-point margin at halftime, and took a one-point lead in the second half. Five minutes later, UConn had opened up a ten-point lead, and extended the lead to a final 16 point margin 76\u201360.<ref name=\"Oklahoma MV\"/><ref name=\"Oklahoma\"/>\n\n===WBCA Classic===\nThe WBCA Classic Tournament was held at the UConn campus 27\u201329 November 2009. Coach Geno Auriemma is the current president of the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association]]. The four teams participating in the three-day [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] event were host UConn, [[Hofstra University|Hofstra]], [[University of Richmond|Richmond]], and [[Clemson University|Clemson]]. Richmond beat Clemson 86\u201367 in the first game.<ref name=\"Richmond Clemson\"/>  UConn easily beat '''Hofstra''' 91\u201346, but the game was notable for being Auriemma's 700th career win.<ref name=\"Hofstra\"/> Auriemma reached 700 victories the fastest of any coach in Division I history, reaching the mark in his 822nd game.<ref name=\"700 wins\"/>\n\nThe following day, Clemson defeated Hofstra 69\u201368,<ref name=\"Clemson Hofstra\"/> while UConn defeated '''Richmond''' 86\u201337.<ref name=\"Richmond \"/> On the final day of the tournament, Richmond defeated Hofstra 42\u201341,<ref name=\"Richmond Hofstra\"/> while UConn won the tournament with their victory over '''Clemson''' 87\u201348.<ref name=\"Clemson\"/>\n\n===Conference games===\nUConn opened conference play against '''[[Seton Hall University|Seton Hall]]''' on 2 Jan 2010. Most away games against Seton Hall are played on campus, but this game was played at the [[Prudential Center]] in Newark. The result was never in doubt, as UConn won 91\u201324, their largest margin over a Big East team in seven years.<ref name=\"Seton Hall\"/> UConn's second conference game was at home against the '''[[University of South Florida]]'''. UConn started out with an 18\u20132 run, but Charles and Moore got into early foul trouble, and had to sit on the bench. Nevertheless, UConn had a double-digit lead at halftime, leading coach Auriemma to quip, \"This is the only place in America where you've got to apologize for being up 14 at halftime.\"<ref name=\"USF\"/>\n\nUConn's next game, against '''[[University of Cincinnati|Cincinnati]]''', was notable more for the coaching match up than the game. After twelve years as an assistant coach at Connecticut and four years as a player, [[Jamelle Elliott]] took the head coaching job at Cincinnati. This would be the first match up between Cincinnati and Connecticut since Elliot left Connecticut. UConn won easily 83\u201351.<ref name=\"Cincinnati\"/>\n\nUConn returned to Big east play after the UNC game with a game against '''[[Marquette University|Marquette]]''' at their arena. The game outcome wasn't in doubt, as Tina Charles had a double-double (23 points, 11 rebounds) leading to a 24-point halftime lead, and a final score of 68\u201343.<ref name=\"Marquette\"/>  The game was unusual for a rare coaching decision near the end of the game. UConn typically declines to attempt to score if the game result is not in doubt, and they are inbounding the ball with less than 30 seconds to play, preferring just to dribble out the end of the game. However, in this game, with 72 seconds on the clock, Coach Auriemma instructed  his player not to even cross half-court, deliberately accepting a shot clock violation and a turnover. The announcers were unsure of the reason at the time, but subsequent remarks by Auriemma clarified that he felt the officials were not doing enough to stop rough play, and he didn't want to  \"put his players into any more physical danger by crossing midcourt\".<ref name=\"Marquette midcourt\"/>\n\nUConn's game against '''[[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]]''' on 16 January didn't tipoff until 9 pm, but the arena opened at 7:30 in the morning. The ESPN CollegeGame Day event, traditionally held at the campus on a men's basketball game, held its first ever College Game Day in connection with a women's basketball game. The campus, shut down for winter break, opened a day earlier than usual to allow students to return in time to attend GameDay. Thousands turned to be in the backdrop of the 10 am national coverage. Because the event occurred in the morning, the UConn team was able to participate.<ref name=\"GameDay\"/>\n{{Rquote|right|Right now, if you took a poll of those award-voters who truly follow women's hoops, Charles likely would be the unanimous winner for national player of the year. And she should be.|Mechelle Voepel|<ref name=\"Voepel on Charles\"/>}}\nThe game in the evening would pit two undefeated teams\u2014UConn, ranked No. 1 in the country with a 16\u20130 record and Notre Dame, ranked No. 3 in the country, with a 15\u20130 record. Despite the closeness of the rankings, and records, the game would not be close. UConn pulled out to a 42\u201319 halftime lead, and coasted to a 24-point victory, winning 70\u201346.<ref name=\"ND home\"/> Tina Charles had a double-double (23 points, 13 rebounds), leading ESPN's Mechelle Voepel to call Charles \"another one of UConn's all-time greats\".<ref name=\"Voepel on Charles\"/>\n\nUConn continued their undefeated season with a win over '''[[Villanova University|Villanova]]''', 74\u201335. This marked the first ever start for senior [[Meghan Gardler]]. While seniors traditionally get a starting role on senior day, the Villanova game was played near Gardler's hometown of Springfield Pennsylvania. Many friends and family members were at the game to see her play. The team, which normally would travel by plane to Pennsylvania, took the train, just for the experience.<ref name=\"Villanova\"/>\n\n'''[[Rutgers University|Rutgers]]''' is known for its defense, but UConn's defense would prove to be superior, as UConn held Rutgers to 36 points, while scoring 73.  Rutgers was the last team to beat UConn in the regular season, winning at their home in 2008, but on this day, the results would not be close.<ref name=\"Rutgers\"/> UConn next played '''[[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]]''', but the story of the game was not the game result, which UConn won easily. 98\u201356, but the benchmark reached by Tina Charles, as she became only the sixth player in UConn history to score 2,000 points in her career.<ref name=\"Pittsburgh\"/>\n\nThe next conference opponent, '''[[West Virginia University|West Virginia]]''' would be ranked No. 8 in the country at the time of the game, but had already faced strong teams this season, and had beaten West Virginia by 30 points in the previous year. This year's final score of 80\u201347 would produce a wider margin, but with a halftime margin of only 12, and a lead dropping to single-digits a few minutes into the second half, the game outcome appeared more in doubt than the final score would indicate.<ref name=\"West Virginia\"/>\n\nThe last time Connecticut played '''[[University of Louisville|Louisville]]''', it was for the national championship in April 2009. That game wasn't close, but this one would be less of a challenge. UConn tripled Louisville's first half scoring, leading to a 54\u201318 first half score, and cruised to a final score of 84\u201338.<ref name=\"Louisville\"/>\n\n[[DePaul Blue Demons|DePaul]] was within nine points almost 15 minutes into the game, but Tiffany Hayes and Tina Charles started scoring, each ending up with 19 points for the game. The halftime lead was 20, and UConn started the second half with an 11\u20131 run to put the game away. The final score was 95\u201362.<ref name=\"DePaul\"/>\n\nBefore the game against [[St. John's University (New York)|St. John's]], Tina Charles was inducted into [[Huskies of Honor]], to reflect her position as one of the most significant figures in the history of the team. Despite the emotion, she scored 25 points and a career high 21 rebounds to help lead UConn over the 24th ranked Red Storm in one of the closest games of the year, with a final score of 66\u201352. Only the 12 point win over Stanford was closer than the 14 point win against St. John's.<ref name=\"St. John's\"/>\n\nConnecticut did not have any  trouble against [[Providence College|Providence]] on the 20th of February, quickly building a 20-point lead and extending the lead in the second half, behind a career high points total of 26 from Tina Charles and 21 from Maya Moore. UConn has now won 237 consecutive victories against unranked opponents at home.<ref name=\"Providence\"/>  Connecticut would continue their winning streak against [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]] four days later, when Maya Moore had a season high 38 points and a career-high 20 rebounds in an 87\u201366 victory.<ref name=\"Syracuse\"/>\n\nConnecticut played 11th ranked [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]] with an opportunity to clinch the Big East regular season title. Tina Charles, who had tied her season high points total a week earlier, set a new season record with 33 points, hitting 14 of 16 shot. Seniors Kaili McLaren, Meghan Gardler and Jacquie Fernandes started the game along with Charles and Greene, to follow the tradition of starting seniors in their final home game. Although Georgetown started out strong, hitting three 3-pointers to take an early 9\u20134 lead, and extended it to 15\u20139, the largest deficit UConn has faced this season, the team retook the lead later in the first half and did not trail again, winning with a final score of 84\u201362.<ref name=\"Georgetown\"/>\n\nThe last regular season game was a rematch against Notre Dame. The usual Big East schedule has two games against one opponent\u2014for several seasons, that opponent was Rutgers, but this season, it was the eighth ranked Notre Dame team. UConn won easily 76\u201351. Tina Charles set two UConn career records in the same game, becoming the all-time scoring leader, surpassing [[Nykesha Sales]]'s record of 2,178 and became the all-time rebound leader, surpassing [[Rebecca Lobo]]'s record of 1,268.<ref name=\"ND away\"/>\n\n===Roster===\n{{CBB roster/Header|sex =w|year=2009|team=Connecticut Huskies| teamcolors=y|high_school=y}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Heather|last=Buck|link=n|num=21|pos=FC|ft=6|in=3|class=FR|rs=y|home=Stonington, Conn.|high_school=Stonington}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Tina|last=Charles|dab=basketball|link=y|num=31|pos=C|ft=6|in=4|class=SR|rs=|home=Jamaica, N.Y.|high_school=Christ the King|note=C}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Lorin|last=Dixon|link=n|num=30|pos=G|ft=5|in=4|class=JR|rs=|home=Springfield Gardens, N.Y.|high_school=Christ the King}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Caroline|last=Doty|link=n|num=5|pos=G|ft=5|in=10|class=SO|rs=|home=Doylestown, Pa.|high_school=Germantown Academy}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Kelly|last=Faris|link=y|num=34|pos=G|ft=5|in=11|class=FR|rs=|home=Plainfield, Ind.|high_school=Heritage Christian}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Jacquie|last=Fernandes|link=n|num=13|pos=G|ft=5|in=9|class=SR|rs=|home=Pawcatuck, Conn.|high_school=Stonington}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Meghan|last=Gardler|link=y|num=22|pos=F|ft=6|in=0|class=SR|rs=|home=Springfield, Pa.|high_school=Cardinal O'Hara}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Kalana|last=Greene|link=y|num=32|pos=G|ft=5|in=10|class=SR|rs=|home=Saint Stephen, South Carolina|high_school=Timberland}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Tiffany|last=Hayes|link=y|num=3|pos=G|ft=5|in=10|class=SO|rs=|home=Lakeland, Florida|high_school=Winter Haven}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Kaili|last=McLaren|link=n|num=41|pos=F|ft=6|in=2|class=SR|rs=|home=Washington, D.C.|high_school=Our Lady of Good Counsel}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Maya|last=Moore|link=y|num=23|pos=F|ft=6|in=0|class=JR|rs=|home=Lawrenceville, Ga.|high_school=Collins Hill|note=C}}\n{{CBB roster/Footer|head_coach=[[Geno Auriemma]]|asst_coach=Chris Dailey  <br />[[Shea Ralph]]  <br />Marisa Moseley |roster_url=http://www.uconnhuskies.com/sports/w-baskbl/archive/w-baskbl-mtt-09.html|accessdate=2013-08-23}}\n\n===Regular season schedule===\nXLC\u2014Veterans Memorial Coliseum at [[XL Center]]\n{|   class=\"wikitable sortable\" <hiddentext>generated with   [[:de:Wikipedia:Helferlein/VBA-Macro for EXCEL tableconversion]]   V1.7<\\hiddentext>\n|-  align=\"center\"  style=\"background-color:#002868;color:#FFFFFF\"  align=\"center\" valign=\"bottom\"\n| width=\"16\"   height=\"13\" | &nbsp;\n| width=\"66\" | Date\n| width=\"90\" | Time (EST)\n| width=\"134\" | Opponent /   Event\n| width=\"250\" | Location\n| width=\"60\" | UConn Points\n| width=\"60\" | Opp. Points\n| width=\"70\" | Record\n|-     align=\"center\" valign=\"bottom\"[[File:WikEd replace next.png|16px|Replace next (shift-click: get selection)]]\n| height=\"13\" | {{ntsh|-1}}\n\n |   5 Nov 09\n\n |   7:30&nbsp;p.m.\n\n |   vs. St. Rose College \u03b5\n\n |   Storrs, Connecticut (Gampel Pavilion)\n\n |   &nbsp;

By virtue of being one of the top four seeds, UConn earned a double-bye, with their first game scheduled in the quarterfinals on Sunday. Syracuse beat Seton Hall on Friday, then beat Providence on Saturday to earn the match up against the number one seeded team in the tournament.\nThe game would never be close, with UConn leading at the half 44\u201317, and ended with a 77\u201341 victory. UConn's Tina Charles would tie her career high with 34 points, while Maya Moore would score the 2000th point of her career, ending the game with 16 points, 14 rebounds  and 7 assists. The win would be UConn's 70th consecutive win, tying an NCAA Division I record for the longest winning streak in the history of women's college basketball, set by UConn in 2003.<ref name=\"BETQuarter\"/>\n\n===Semi-Final===\nUConn would break their own 70-game winning streak with a 59\u201344 victory over Notre Dame on March 8, 2010, earning their 71st straight victory; every single victory during their current streak has been by at least 10 points.  The Huskies will play in the Big East Championship game on March 9, 2010, which will be their last game before the NCAA Tournament.<ref name=\"BETSemi\"/>\n\n===Big East Championship Game===\nUConn defeated West Virginia, 60\u201332, to improve their winning streak to 72 games, and making their season record 33\u20130.  [[Kalana Greene]]'s 15 points guided the Huskies to victory, and help her to earn the Most Outstanding Player award for the tournament. UConn closed the game on 27\u20134 run after leading 33\u201328 early in the second half.<ref name=\"BETFinal\"/>\n\n{{CBB schedule start|time=yes|rank=yes|tv=no|gamehighs=yes|attend=no}}\n{{CBB schedule entry\n| w/l          = w\n| date         = 7 March 10\n| nonconf      =\n| homecoming   =\n| time         = 2:00 PM\n| rank         = 1\n| away         =\n| neutral      =\n| opprank      =\n| opponent     = {{cbb link|year=2009\u201310|sex=women|team=Syracuse Orange|school=Syracuse University|title=Syracuse}}\n| site_stadium = [[XL Center]]\n| site_cityst  = [[Hartford, Connecticut]]\n| gamename     = [[Big East Women's Basketball Tournament]]\n| tv           = no\n| highscorer   = [[Tina Charles (basketball)|Tina Charles]]\n| points       = 34\n| highrebounder= [[Maya Moore]]\n| rebounds     = 14\n| highassister = [[Maya Moore]]\n| assists      = 7\n| score        = 77\u201341\n| overtime     =\n| attend       =\n| record       = 31\u20130\n}}\n{{CBB schedule entry\n| w/l          = w\n| date         = 8 March 10\n| nonconf      =\n| homecoming   =\n| time         = 6:00 PM\n| rank         = 1\n| away       =\n| neutral      =\n| opprank      = 7\n| opponent     = [[2009\u201310 Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's basketball team|Notre Dame]]\n| site_stadium = [[XL Center]]\n| site_cityst  = [[Hartford, Connecticut]]\n| gamename     = [[Big East Women's Basketball Tournament]]\n| tv           = no\n| highscorer   = [[Tina Charles (basketball)|Tina Charles]]\n| points       = 16\n| highrebounder= [[Tina Charles (basketball)|Tina Charles]]\n| rebounds     = 17\n| highassister = [[Maya Moore]]\n| assists      = 6\n| score        = 59\u201344\n| overtime     =\n| attend       =\n| record       = 32\u20130\n}}\n{{CBB schedule entry\n| w/l          = w\n| date         = 9 March 10\n| nonconf      =\n| homecoming   =\n| time         = 7:00 PM\n| rank         = 1\n| away       =\n| neutral      =\n| opprank      = 8\n| opponent     = {{cbb link|year=2009\u201310|sex=women|team=West Virginia Mountaineers\n|school=West Virginia University|title=West Virginia}}\n| site_stadium = [[XL Center]]\n| site_cityst  = [[Hartford, Connecticut]]\n| gamename     = [[Big East Women's Basketball Tournament]]\n| tv           = no\n| highscorer   = [[Kalana Greene]]\n| points       = 15\n| highrebounder= [[Kalana Greene]]\n| rebounds     = 12\n| highassister = [[Kalana Greene]]\n| assists      = 3\n| score        = 60\u201332\n| overtime     =\n| attend       =\n| record       = 33\u20130\n}}\n{{CBB schedule end|rank=yes|poll=|timezone=Eastern Time|ncg=|hc=no}}\n\n==Postseason==\n\n===NCAA Basketball Tournament===\n[[File:UConn women's basketball team at the White House 2010-05-17 1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=White House ceremony commemorating the 2010 NCAA National Champion Connecticut Huskies women's basketball team|The Huskies at the White House]]\n\nUConn was awarded a No. 1 seed (the number one overall seed) and assigned to the Dayton bracket. Their first-round game was against [[Southern Jaguars|Southern]], the winner of the [[Southwestern Athletic Conference|SWAC]] tournament. Southern would score the first two points, but that would be their only lead of the game. Tina Charles hit her first nine shot attempts, on her way to a 22-point game, and teammate Maya More would add 21. Others would score as well, but those two scored enough to outscore the Jaguars. UConn's defense would hold the Jaguars to just ten second half points.<ref name=\"Southern\"/>\n\nThe second-round game was against [[Temple Owls|Temple]]. The Temple team is coached by Tonya Cardoza, who was an assistant coach at UConn for 14 years, before she accepted the head coaching job at Temple prior to the start of the 2008\u20132009 season. The game also occurred on Auriemma's 56th birthday. UConn outscored Temple 55\u201312 in the first half, hitting 78% of their field goal attempts.  The starting players ended up playing no more than half the game. Auriemma described the game as \"pretty incredible performance\".<ref name=\"Temple\"/>\n\nThe Sweet Sixteen game was against [[Iowa State Cyclones|Iowa State]]. The two teams last played each other in 1999, when Iowa State knocked number one seeded UConn out of the NCAA tournament. This time, the result would be quite different. Maya Moore outscored Iowa State in the first half, despite sitting more than ten minutes with two fouls. The lead would grow to 50, at which time the starters all sat for the remainder of the game, and the final margin tightened. The final score was 74\u201336.<ref name=\"Iowa State\"/>\n\nIn the Dayton Regional final, there was a rematch of a game earlier this season against [[Florida State Seminoles|Florida State]], and it was no contest as the Huskies rolled thanks to Maya Moore's 22 points and Tina Charles added 20 points and had 14 rebounds in a 90\u201350 rout of the Lady Seminoles.<ref name=\"Dayton Regional final\"/> The win earned them a trip to the Women's Final Four and a date with [[Baylor Bears|Baylor]] and one of the most dominant players in women's basketball, [[Brittney Griner]].\n\n[[File:UConn National Championship Trophies 2010.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Trophies commemorating finishing first in the SA TODAY ESPN Division I Top 25 Coaches' Poll and winning the NCAA Tournament|The Waterford crystal NCAA/WBCA Coaches' Trophy (left), awarded to the team finishing first in the USA TODAY ESPN Division I Top 25 Coaches' Poll and the NCAA Championship trophy]]\n\nThe Final Four semi-final game against Baylor started the way many games this season have started. Despite playing a top-ranked team, Connecticut went out to leads of 11\u20133 and 25\u20138.  Baylor didn\u2019t quit, and by halftime, the 17-point lead was down to 13. UConn scored the first basket of the second half, but then Baylor scored twelve consecutive points, to cut the margin to three. Baylor's 6' 8\" center Griner had five blocks to go along with 13 points and six rebounds. In contrast, UConn's center Charles had two blocks along with 21 points and 13 rebounds, while Maya Moore scored 34 points, the fourth highest point total in semifinal history. The final score in favor of Connecticut was 70\u201350, setting up a rematch with Stanford.<ref name=\"Baylor\"/>\n\nThe National Championship game on Tuesday was against Stanford. Stanford's last loss was to Connecticut in December 2009, and Connecticut's last loss was to Stanford, exactly two years before, in the Final Four of 2008. The game started the way many games for Connecticut have started\u2014just over two minutes into the game, Connecticut had a 5\u20130 lead. However, they would not score for over ten minutes, missing sixteen consecutive shots. Stanford would lead by as many as nine points, and would go to halftime with a 20\u201312 lead. The twelve points scored by UConn was the lowest first half total in the history of Connecticut basketball.<ref name=\"Championship boxscore\"/>\n{{Rquote|right|the best team in all of sports, any sport, any gender, by far|[[Barack Obama]], May 17, 2010|<ref name=\"Obama Quote\"/>}}\n\nMaya Moore lead the team after the half, scoring 11 of the team's first 17 points, including the basket that put Connecticut back into the lead, this time for good. Moore would end up with 23 points and 11 rebounds, and earned Most Outstanding Player honors for the Final Four. Connecticut would go on to win 53\u201347, ending their streak of double-digit victories, but winning their 78th consecutive game, resulting in their seventh national championship, their second

The Huskies were coached by [[Geno Auriemma]], as the Huskies played their home games at the [[XL Center Veterans Memorial Coliseum|Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in the  [[XL Center]] located in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], and on campus at the [[Harry A. Gampel Pavilion]] in [[Storrs, Connecticut]]. The Huskies are a member of the [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East Conference]] and won their seventh NCAA championship against Stanford on April 6, 2010.\n\n==Offseason==\n[[File:Marisa Moseley UConn.jpg|thumb|120px|alt=Marisa Moseley |Marisa Moseley]]\n[[File:Kelly Faris UConn.jpg|thumb|120px|alt=Kelly Faris |Kelly Faris]]\n[[File:Lorin Dixon Uconn.jpg|thumb|120px|alt=Lorin Dixon |Lorin Dixon]]\n*May 5: [[Jamelle Elliott]], a 12-year member of Geno Auriemma's coaching staff was named head coach of the University of Cincinnati Bearcats women's team.

Senior [[Tina Charles (basketball)|Tina Charles]] contributed six points, two rebounds, a block and a steal in just 13 minutes of action.<ref name=\"UConn3\"/>\n*July 25: Rebecca Lobo became the first Connecticut player named as an inductee into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame, leading a class of six inductees.<ref name=\"Yahoo\"/> Lobo helped UConn to its first national championship with an undefeated season in 1995. The six individuals in the Class of 2010 will be formally inducted as members of the Hall of Fame on June 12, 2010, in Knoxville, Tenn.\n*July 30: The Women's Basketball Coaches Association ([[Women's Basketball Coaches Association|WBCA]]), on behalf of the Wade Coalition, announced the 2009\u20132010 preseason \"Wade Watch\" list for [[Wade Trophy|The State Farm Wade Trophy]] Division I Player of the Year. Three players from the Huskies, Tina Charles, [[Tiffany Hayes]] and [[Maya Moore]], have been named to the 2009\u201310 preseason \"Wade Watch\" list,<ref name=\"BE Wade\"/> which is made up of top NCAA Division I student-athletes who best embody the spirit of Lily Margaret Wade.

The team then will compete for the 2010 FIBA World Championship. Also on the 19 member team are former UConn players [[Renee Montgomery]], [[Swin Cash]], [[Asjha Jones]], [[Sue Bird]] and [[Diana Taurasi]]. The coach of the National Team is UConn coach [[Geno Auriemma]], although the team selections are made by [[USA Basketball]].<ref name=\"National Team\"/>\n*November 3: Maya Moore and Tina Charles selected to the preseason All-American team by the AP. Moore is only the seventh ever unanimous selection.<ref name=\"preseason allamerican\"/>\n\n==Regular season==\n\n===Pre-season===\nThe Connecticut team opened the year ranked No. 1 in the ESPN Coaches poll and the AP Top 25 Poll, following a 39\u20130 record leading to a national championship in the prior season.<ref name=\"preseason polls\"/> In both cases, the polling results were unanimous. UConn graduated three seniors, Renee Montgomery, Tahirah Williams and Cassie Kerns, but only Renee was a regular starter. The team added one freshman, Kelly Faris, and Caroline Doty returned to the line-up after missing most of the prior season due to injury.\n\nThe two preseason games were wins against '''[[The College of Saint Rose|St. Rose College]]'''(85\u201344) and '''[[Vanguard University of Southern California|Vanguard]]''' (98\u201368).\n\n===Non-conference games===\nThe defending national champions opened their season against '''[[Northeastern University|Northeastern]]'''. The outcome of the game was never in doubt, with a final score of 105\u201335; the game was more about personal accomplishments than the game itself. Senior Tina Charles pulled down her 1000th career rebound while senior Kalana Greene scored her 1000th career point. The win would continue a consecutive streak started the previous year, then at 40 games.<ref name=\"Northeastern\"/>\nThe game against '''[[University of Texas at Austin|Texas]]''', played in San Antonio, the location of this season's Final Four, was expected to be competitive, as Texas was ranked tenth in the nation by the AP. However, UConn pulled out to a 21-point lead by halftime, and ended up winning by 25, 83\u201358.<ref name=\"Texas\"/>\n\nConnecticut's next game against '''[[College of the Holy Cross|Holy Cross]]''' would mark the 20th game between the two teams, an annual competition going back to the 1985\u201386 season. At the start of the series, the schools were competitive, with the teams splitting the first four meetings. However, UConn has not lost since, and entered the game with a 17\u20132 series record.<ref name=\"Holy Cross1\"/> UConn prevailed 87\u201334.<ref name=\"Holy Cross2\"/>\n\nAfter the WBCA Classic, UConn would play '''[[University of Vermont|Vermont]]'''  in a rematch of the previous year's NCAA opening round game. UConn won easily 84\u201342, on a night in which senior Tina Charles became the second leading rebounder in school history.<ref name=\"Vermont\"/>\n\nUConn's next opponent, '''[[University of Hartford|Hartford]]''', was coached by former UConn star [[Jennifer Rizzotti]]. Hartford had never beaten UConn, and this game would be no exception, with UConn winning 80\u201345 for the eleventh consecutive victory over the Hawks.<ref name=\"Hartford \"/> In the next game, UConn easily beat '''[[Iona College (New York)|Iona]]''' 90\u201335.<ref name=\"Iona\"/>\n\nThe '''[[Stanford University|Stanford]]''' game was one of the most anticipated games of the season.<ref name=\"Anticipation\"/> Both teams came into the game undefeated. UConn was ranked No. 1 in the AP writer's poll and the ESPN Coaches poll, while Stanford was ranked No. 2 in each poll.<ref name=\"Rankings\"/> Stanford's last loss was to UConn in the 2009 NCAA Final Four game, while UConn's last loss was to Stanford in the 2008 Final Four game.\nUConn hadn't been behind in a game at halftime or later all season until this game, but Stanford entered halftime with a slim two-point lead. However, after trading baskets early in the second half, UConn pulled out to a 22-point lead (74\u201352) with five minutes left in the game,<ref name=\"Play by play\"/> and coasted to their 49th consecutive victory, all of which were won with a double-digit margin.<ref name=\"Stanford\"/>\n\nUConn ended the calendar year with a 78\u201359 victory over 11th-ranked '''[[Florida State University|Florida State]]'''. The game was relatively close at halftime, 41\u201335, but UConn's Tina Charles scored 16 of her 24 points in the second half to help ensure a victory.<ref name=\"Florida State\"/>\n\nUConn took a break from conference games to play a home game against the '''[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]]'''(UNC).{{Rquote|left|The first half wasn't just the best basketball Connecticut played; it might have been the best basketball it can play.|Graham Hays|<ref name=\"Hays\"/>}} At the time, UNC was ranked seventh in the country. Despite the prospect of a close game, it was never close. Tina Charles scored 25 points in the first half, single-handedly outscoring the entire UNC team. UConn lead at halftime 56\u201324, and go on to win by 41 points, 88\u201347. ESPN's Graham Hays called \"the first-half play as good as it gets\".<ref name=\"UNC\"/>\n\nConnecticut had played [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] teams Florida State and North Carolina; on 18 January, they would play their third ACC team of the season, '''[[Duke University|Duke]]'''. Just as North Carolina had been ranked seventh at the time of the game, the Duke team was the seventh ranked team in the country. The margin of victory would not be as large as the UNC game, but it was still a convincing win, with UConn outscoring Duke 81\u201348. In contrast to the UNC game in which the first half was decision, Duke would remain reasonably close at halftime, down only ten, 38\u201328, but UConn would stretch out the lead in the second half. Maya Moore hit six three point field goals in the game, and Kalana Greene scored 18 points.<ref name=\"Duke\"/>\n\nConnecticut faced [[Oklahoma Sooners women's basketball|Oklahoma]] in a late, out-of-conference match-up on the 15th of February. Oklahoma was ranked 12th in the nation, but UConn had faced higher ranked opponents, and won relatively easily. Midway through the first half, it appeared UConn was heading for another easy win, as they had doubled the Sooners score 24\u201312. However, Oklahoma brought the game back to a two-point margin at halftime, and took a one-point lead in the second half. Five minutes later, UConn had opened up a ten-point lead, and extended the lead to a final 16 point margin 76\u201360.<ref name=\"Oklahoma MV\"/><ref name=\"Oklahoma\"/>\n\n===WBCA Classic===\nThe WBCA Classic Tournament was held at the UConn campus 27\u201329 November 2009. Coach Geno Auriemma is the current president of the [[Women's Basketball Coaches Association]]. The four teams participating in the three-day [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] event were host UConn, [[Hofstra University|Hofstra]], [[University of Richmond|Richmond]], and [[Clemson University|Clemson]]. Richmond beat Clemson 86\u201367 in the first game.<ref name=\"Richmond Clemson\"/>  UConn easily beat '''Hofstra''' 91\u201346, but the game was notable for being Auriemma's 700th career win.<ref name=\"Hofstra\"/> Auriemma reached 700 victories the fastest of any coach in Division I history, reaching the mark in his 822nd game.<ref name=\"700 wins\"/>\n\nThe following day, Clemson defeated Hofstra 69\u201368,<ref name=\"Clemson Hofstra\"/> while UConn defeated '''Richmond''' 86\u201337.<ref name=\"Richmond \"/> On the final day of the tournament, Richmond defeated Hofstra 42\u201341,<ref name=\"Richmond Hofstra\"/> while UConn won the tournament with their victory over '''Clemson''' 87\u201348.<ref name=\"Clemson\"/>\n\n===Conference games===\nUConn opened conference play against '''[[Seton Hall University|Seton Hall]]''' on 2 Jan 2010. Most away games against Seton Hall are played on campus, but this game was played at the [[Prudential Center]] in Newark. The result was never in doubt, as UConn won 91\u201324, their largest margin over a Big East team in seven years.<ref name=\"Seton Hall\"/> UConn's second conference game was at home against the '''[[University of South Florida]]'''. UConn started out with an 18\u20132 run, but Charles and Moore got into early foul trouble, and had to sit on the bench. Nevertheless, UConn had a double-digit lead at halftime, leading coach Auriemma to quip, \"This is the only place in America where you've got to apologize for being up 14 at halftime.\"<ref name=\"USF\"/>\n\nUConn's next game, against '''[[University of Cincinnati|Cincinnati]]''', was notable more for the coaching match up than the game. After twelve years as an assistant coach at Connecticut and four years as a player, [[Jamelle Elliott]] took the head coaching job at Cincinnati. This would be the first match up between Cincinnati and Connecticut since Elliot left Connecticut. UConn won easily 83\u201351.<ref name=\"Cincinnati\"/>\n\nUConn returned to Big east play after the UNC game with a game against '''[[Marquette University|Marquette]]''' at their arena. The game outcome wasn't in doubt, as Tina Charles had a double-double (23 points, 11 rebounds) leading to a 24-point halftime lead, and a final score of 68\u201343.<ref name=\"Marquette\"/>  The game was unusual for a rare coaching decision near the end of the game. UConn typically declines to attempt to score if the game result is not in doubt, and they are inbounding the ball with less than 30 seconds to play, preferring just to dribble out the end of the game. However, in this game, with 72 seconds on the clock, Coach Auriemma instructed  his player not to even cross half-court, deliberately accepting a shot clock violation and a turnover. The announcers were unsure of the reason at the time, but subsequent remarks by Auriemma clarified that he felt the officials were not doing enough to stop rough play, and he didn't want to  \"put his players into any more physical danger by crossing midcourt\".<ref name=\"Marquette midcourt\"/>\n\nUConn's game against '''[[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]]''' on 16 January didn't tipoff until 9 pm, but the arena opened at 7:30 in the morning. The ESPN CollegeGame Day event, traditionally held at the campus on a men's basketball game, held its first ever College Game Day in connection with a women's basketball game. The campus, shut down for winter break, opened a day earlier than usual to allow students to return in time to attend GameDay. Thousands turned to be in the backdrop of the 10 am national coverage. Because the event occurred in the morning, the UConn team was able to participate.<ref name=\"GameDay\"/>\n{{Rquote|right|Right now, if you took a poll of those award-voters who truly follow women's hoops, Charles likely would be the unanimous winner for national player of the year. And she should be.|Mechelle Voepel|<ref name=\"Voepel on Charles\"/>}}\nThe game in the evening would pit two undefeated teams\u2014UConn, ranked No. 1 in the country with a 16\u20130 record and Notre Dame, ranked No. 3 in the country, with a 15\u20130 record. Despite the closeness of the rankings, and records, the game would not be close. UConn pulled out to a 42\u201319 halftime lead, and coasted to a 24-point victory, winning 70\u201346.<ref name=\"ND home\"/> Tina Charles had a double-double (23 points, 13 rebounds), leading ESPN's Mechelle Voepel to call Charles \"another one of UConn's all-time greats\".<ref name=\"Voepel on Charles\"/>\n\nUConn continued their undefeated season with a win over '''[[Villanova University|Villanova]]''', 74\u201335. This marked the first ever start for senior [[Meghan Gardler]]. While seniors traditionally get a starting role on senior day, the Villanova game was played near Gardler's hometown of Springfield Pennsylvania. Many friends and family members were at the game to see her play. The team, which normally would travel by plane to Pennsylvania, took the train, just for the experience.<ref name=\"Villanova\"/>\n\n'''[[Rutgers University|Rutgers]]''' is known for its defense, but UConn's defense would prove to be superior, as UConn held Rutgers to 36 points, while scoring 73.  Rutgers was the last team to beat UConn in the regular season, winning at their home in 2008, but on this day, the results would not be close.<ref name=\"Rutgers\"/> UConn next played '''[[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh]]''', but the story of the game was not the game result, which UConn won easily. 98\u201356, but the benchmark reached by Tina Charles, as she became only the sixth player in UConn history to score 2,000 points in her career.<ref name=\"Pittsburgh\"/>\n\nThe next conference opponent, '''[[West Virginia University|West Virginia]]''' would be ranked No. 8 in the country at the time of the game, but had already faced strong teams this season, and had beaten West Virginia by 30 points in the previous year. This year's final score of 80\u201347 would produce a wider margin, but with a halftime margin of only 12, and a lead dropping to single-digits a few minutes into the second half, the game outcome appeared more in doubt than the final score would indicate.<ref name=\"West Virginia\"/>\n\nThe last time Connecticut played '''[[University of Louisville|Louisville]]''', it was for the national championship in April 2009. That game wasn't close, but this one would be less of a challenge. UConn tripled Louisville's first half scoring, leading to a 54\u201318 first half score, and cruised to a final score of 84\u201338.<ref name=\"Louisville\"/>\n\n[[DePaul Blue Demons|DePaul]] was within nine points almost 15 minutes into the game, but Tiffany Hayes and Tina Charles started scoring, each ending up with 19 points for the game. The halftime lead was 20, and UConn started the second half with an 11\u20131 run to put the game away. The final score was 95\u201362.<ref name=\"DePaul\"/>\n\nBefore the game against [[St. John's University (New York)|St. John's]], Tina Charles was inducted into [[Huskies of Honor]], to reflect her position as one of the most significant figures in the history of the team. Despite the emotion, she scored 25 points and a career high 21 rebounds to help lead UConn over the 24th ranked Red Storm in one of the closest games of the year, with a final score of 66\u201352. Only the 12 point win over Stanford was closer than the 14 point win against St. John's.<ref name=\"St. John's\"/>\n\nConnecticut did not have any  trouble against [[Providence College|Providence]] on the 20th of February, quickly building a 20-point lead and extending the lead in the second half, behind a career high points total of 26 from Tina Charles and 21 from Maya Moore. UConn has now won 237 consecutive victories against unranked opponents at home.<ref name=\"Providence\"/>  Connecticut would continue their winning streak against [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]] four days later, when Maya Moore had a season high 38 points and a career-high 20 rebounds in an 87\u201366 victory.<ref name=\"Syracuse\"/>\n\nConnecticut played 11th ranked [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]] with an opportunity to clinch the Big East regular season title. Tina Charles, who had tied her season high points total a week earlier, set a new season record with 33 points, hitting 14 of 16 shot. Seniors Kaili McLaren, Meghan Gardler and Jacquie Fernandes started the game along with Charles and Greene, to follow the tradition of starting seniors in their final home game. Although Georgetown started out strong, hitting three 3-pointers to take an early 9\u20134 lead, and extended it to 15\u20139, the largest deficit UConn has faced this season, the team retook the lead later in the first half and did not trail again, winning with a final score of 84\u201362.<ref name=\"Georgetown\"/>\n\nThe last regular season game was a rematch against Notre Dame. The usual Big East schedule has two games against one opponent\u2014for several seasons, that opponent was Rutgers, but this season, it was the eighth ranked Notre Dame team. UConn won easily 76\u201351. Tina Charles set two UConn career records in the same game, becoming the all-time scoring leader, surpassing [[Nykesha Sales]]'s record of 2,178 and became the all-time rebound leader, surpassing [[Rebecca Lobo]]'s record of 1,268.<ref name=\"ND away\"/>\n\n===Roster===\n{{CBB roster/Header|sex =w|year=2009|team=Connecticut Huskies| teamcolors=y|high_school=y}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Heather|last=Buck|link=n|num=21|pos=FC|ft=6|in=3|class=FR|rs=y|home=Stonington, Conn.|high_school=Stonington}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Tina|last=Charles|dab=basketball|link=y|num=31|pos=C|ft=6|in=4|class=SR|rs=|home=Jamaica, N.Y.|high_school=Christ the King|note=C}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Lorin|last=Dixon|link=n|num=30|pos=G|ft=5|in=4|class=JR|rs=|home=Springfield Gardens, N.Y.|high_school=Christ the King}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Caroline|last=Doty|link=n|num=5|pos=G|ft=5|in=10|class=SO|rs=|home=Doylestown, Pa.|high_school=Germantown Academy}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Kelly|last=Faris|link=y|num=34|pos=G|ft=5|in=11|class=FR|rs=|home=Plainfield, Ind.|high_school=Heritage Christian}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Jacquie|last=Fernandes|link=n|num=13|pos=G|ft=5|in=9|class=SR|rs=|home=Pawcatuck, Conn.|high_school=Stonington}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Meghan|last=Gardler|link=y|num=22|pos=F|ft=6|in=0|class=SR|rs=|home=Springfield, Pa.|high_school=Cardinal O'Hara}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Kalana|last=Greene|link=y|num=32|pos=G|ft=5|in=10|class=SR|rs=|home=Saint Stephen, South Carolina|high_school=Timberland}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Tiffany|last=Hayes|link=y|num=3|pos=G|ft=5|in=10|class=SO|rs=|home=Lakeland, Florida|high_school=Winter Haven}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Kaili|last=McLaren|link=n|num=41|pos=F|ft=6|in=2|class=SR|rs=|home=Washington, D.C.|high_school=Our Lady of Good Counsel}}\n{{CBB roster/Player|sex=w|first=Maya|last=Moore|link=y|num=23|pos=F|ft=6|in=0|class=JR|rs=|home=Lawrenceville, Ga.|high_school=Collins Hill|note=C}}\n{{CBB roster/Footer|head_coach=[[Geno Auriemma]]|asst_coach=Chris Dailey  <br />[[Shea Ralph]]  <br />Marisa Moseley |roster_url=http://www.uconnhuskies.com/sports/w-baskbl/archive/w-baskbl-mtt-09.html|accessdate=2013-08-23}}\n\n===Regular season schedule===\nXLC\u2014Veterans Memorial Coliseum at [[XL Center]]\n{|   class=\"wikitable sortable\" <hiddentext>generated with   [[:de:Wikipedia:Helferlein/VBA-Macro for EXCEL tableconversion]]   V1.7<\\hiddentext>\n|-  align=\"center\"  style=\"background-color:#002868;color:#FFFFFF\"  align=\"center\" valign=\"bottom\"\n| width=\"16\"   height=\"13\" | &nbsp;\n| width=\"66\" | Date\n| width=\"90\" | Time (EST)\n| width=\"134\" | Opponent /   Event\n| width=\"250\" | Location\n| width=\"60\" | UConn Points\n| width=\"60\" | Opp. Points\n| width=\"70\" | Record\n|-     align=\"center\" valign=\"bottom\"[[File:WikEd replace next.png|16px|Replace next (shift-click: get selection)]]\n| height=\"13\" | {{ntsh|-1}}\n\n |   5 Nov 09\n\n |   7:30&nbsp;p.m.\n\n |   vs. St. Rose College \u03b5\n\n |   Storrs, Connecticut (Gampel Pavilion)\n\n |   &nbsp;

By virtue of being one of the top four seeds, UConn earned a double-bye, with their first game scheduled in the quarterfinals on Sunday. Syracuse beat Seton Hall on Friday, then beat Providence on Saturday to earn the match up against the number one seeded team in the tournament.\nThe game would never be close, with UConn leading at the half 44\u201317, and ended with a 77\u201341 victory. UConn's Tina Charles would tie her career high with 34 points, while Maya Moore would score the 2000th point of her career, ending the game with 16 points, 14 rebounds  and 7 assists.

Their first-round game was against [[Southern Jaguars|Southern]], the winner of the [[Southwestern Athletic Conference|SWAC]] tournament. Southern would score the first two points, but that would be their only lead of the game. Tina Charles hit her first nine shot attempts, on her way to a 22-point game, and teammate Maya More would add 21. Others would score as well, but those two scored enough to outscore the Jaguars. UConn's defense would hold the Jaguars to just ten second half points.<ref name=\"Southern\"/>\n\nThe second-round game was against [[Temple Owls|Temple]]. The Temple team is coached by Tonya Cardoza, who was an assistant coach at UConn for 14 years, before she accepted the head coaching job at Temple prior to the start of the 2008\u20132009 season. The game also occurred on Auriemma's 56th birthday. UConn outscored Temple 55\u201312 in the first half, hitting 78% of their field goal attempts.  The starting players ended up playing no more than half the game. Auriemma described the game as \"pretty incredible performance\".<ref name=\"Temple\"/>\n\nThe Sweet Sixteen game was against [[Iowa State Cyclones|Iowa State]]. The two teams last played each other in 1999, when Iowa State knocked number one seeded UConn out of the NCAA tournament. This time, the result would be quite different. Maya Moore outscored Iowa State in the first half, despite sitting more than ten minutes with two fouls. The lead would grow to 50, at which time the starters all sat for the remainder of the game, and the final margin tightened. The final score was 74\u201336.<ref name=\"Iowa State\"/>\n\nIn the Dayton Regional final, there was a rematch of a game earlier this season against [[Florida State Seminoles|Florida State]], and it was no contest as the Huskies rolled thanks to Maya Moore's 22 points and Tina Charles added 20 points and had 14 rebounds in a 90\u201350 rout of the Lady Seminoles.<ref name=\"Dayton Regional final\"/> The win earned them a trip to the Women's Final Four and a date with [[Baylor Bears|Baylor]] and one of the most dominant players in women's basketball, [[Brittney Griner]].\n\n[[File:UConn National Championship Trophies 2010.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Trphies commemorating finishing first in the SA TODAY ESPN Division I Top 25 Coaches' Poll and winning the NCAA Tournament|The Waterford crystal NCAA/WBCA Coaches' Trophy (left), awarded to the team finishing first in the USA TODAY ESPN Division I Top 25 Coaches' Poll and the NCAA Championship trophy]]\n\nThe Final Four semi-final game against Baylor started the way many games this season have started. Despite playing a top-ranked team, Connecticut went out to leads of 11\u20133 and 25\u20138.  Baylor didn\u2019t quit, and by halftime, the 17-point lead was down to 13. UConn scored the first basket of the second half, but then Baylor scored twelve consecutive points, to cut the margin to three. Baylor's 6' 8\" center Griner had five blocks to go along with 13 points and six rebounds. In contrast, UConn's center Charles had two blocks along with 21 points and 13 rebounds, while Maya Moore scored 34 points, the fourth highest point total in semifinal history. The final score in favor of Connecticut was 70\u201350, setting up a rematch with Stanford.<ref name=\"Baylor\"/>\n\nThe National Championship game on Tuesday was against Stanford. Stanford's last loss was to Connecticut in December 2009, and Connecticut's last loss was to Stanford, exactly two years before, in the Final Four of 2008. The game started the way many games for Connecticut have started\u2014just over two minutes into the game, Connecticut had a 5\u20130 lead. However, they would not score for over ten minutes, missing sixteen consecutive shots. Stanford would lead by as many as nine points, and would go to halftime with a 20\u201312 lead. The twelve points scored by UConn was the lowest first half total in the history of Connecticut basketball.<ref name=\"Championship boxscore\"/>\n{{Rquote|right|the best team in all of sports, any sport, any gender, by far|[[Barack Obama]], May 17, 2010|<ref name=\"Obama Quote\"/>}}\n\nMaya Moore lead the team after the half, scoring 11 of the team's first 17 points, including the basket that put Connecticut back into the lead, this time for good. Moore would end up with 23 points and 11 rebounds, and earned Most Outstanding Player honors for the Final Four. Connecticut would go on to win 53\u201347, ending their streak of double-digit victories, but winning their 78th consecutive game, resulting in their seventh national championship, their second consecutive undefeated season and their fourth overall undefeated season.<ref name=\"Championship\"/>\n\n{{CBB schedule start|time=yes|rank=yes|tv=yes|gamehighs=yes|attend=no}}\n{{CBB schedule

The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title '''''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'''''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty Harkness (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8,

by [[Hanna-Barbera]] which aired on [[NBC]] from September 8, 1979 to December 1, 1979.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First

|page=108}}</ref> It contained the following two segments:\n\n*''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]'' (a revival of ''The Flintstones'')\n*''The Thing'' (based on the [[Marvel Comics]] superhero [[Thing (comics)|Thing]])\n\nDespite the show's title, the two segments remained separate and did not crossover with one another. The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title '''''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'''''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty Harkness (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8, [[Ant-Man]] and [[Dragon Man]] give pink-haired rock star turned reluctant superhero Darla Deering her own Thing Rings to summon Ben Grimm's old rocky Thing-bodied [[powered exoskeleton|exoskeleton]]

Include fine crystalline variety, coarse crystalline rhombohedra and fine crystalline aggregates impregnated by a mixture of undetermined Fehydroxides.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> The mineralization of the siderites on certain layers is associated to the abundance of organic matter, with the decay of it ending on a progressive carbonate supersaturation, with an early precipitation on the nucleus of the siderites. They reflect also the conditions of salinity on the water, showing alternances in short periods, associated with the abundance of organic matter.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> Muds and mudstones consist mainly of particles with the size of common clay, some with an admixture of silt; sandy muds and mudstones are also encountered in counterpart to the pure clays and claystones, without admixtures of other fractions, that are rare or extremely rare. Mudstones are poorly consolidated, tren to disintegration, swell and become plastic, being the only exceptional ones those the heavy sideritic mudstones, that range from a wide variety of colors, from  brown or cherry-red in colour, with an olive shade often appearing.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> On the other hand, there are abundant poorly consolidated [[Quartz]] sandstones, that are regularly intercalated with [[Silt]] and [[Siltstone]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Along the Sandstones, there are [[Chlorite]] and [[Kaolinite]] grains. Plant microremains are common, concentrated with mica flakes on lamination planes, while larger wood fragments, several cm long, are also moderately frequent.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Heavy minerals are present and include as the most common [[Euhedral]] forms such as [[Zircon]], [[Rutile]] and [[Tourmaline]], along with angular fragments of [[Rutile]], [[Garnet]] and [[Staurolite]], with finally well-rounded oval grains of Zircon, Rutile, Garnet and Tourmaline. Outside the main heavy minerals, it is possible to find well-rounded grains of green [[Hornblende]], [[Apatite]], [[Disthene]], [[Epidote]], and finally on one study one [[Pyroxene]] grain was found.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The presence of [[Kaolinite]], related to continental formation in tropical climate environments for the chemical weathering of different igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, along with [[Chlorite]] & [[Biotite]], suggest a deposition linked to fluvial & deltaic forces. The eastern Sudetes and their foreland are the best candidates to be the origin of the transported material, as they have a nearly identical composition, being the Lower Jurassic deposits in the [[Fore-Sudetic Monocline]] linked [[Cracow-Cz\u00eastochowa Monocline]], with the strata of the Formation.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\n[[File:Wapienno - kamienio\u0142omy Cementowni Kujawy - Lafarge Cement 2009.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Wapienno]] Cement Quarry, with exposed strata of the Formation]]\nDeposits of the Ciechocinek Formation are related to a brackish-marine origin, being deposited in an epicontinental sedimentary basin on Poland, that was the eastern arm of the Mid-European [[Toarcian]] Basin.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Sedimentological analyses pointed to a deposition in a shallow basin, prevalently at <20 m deep, with present features of a large shallow embayment, influenced by deltaic facies, that has it\u00b4s origin on marginal parts. Well preseved estructural succesions along the strata show that the depositional environment of the formation was strongly influenced by storm periods.<ref name=storms>Leonowicz, P. M. (2016).

Along this strata, trace fossils are deposited on settings where geochemical analises show the presence of a brackish water influence on the basin.<ref name=storms/> The main component of the deposits are muds,  intercalate sandstones & silts disposed on a high variety of structures, with at least twelve lithofacies that run from fine-grained sedimentations to wave-dominated [[sandy shoal]]s. It is believed that the dominant sedimentation was by quiet [[mud]] and silt sedimentation from suspension, which probably come from near [[River Mouths]].  It was a sedimentary basin with a continuous influx of [[Clay]] and fine [[Silt]], to which sand was brought by events such as river transportation, storms, eustatic effects, and other related.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\">Leonowicz, P.

The presence of alluvial sedimentation still on the nearshore environments, as an effect probably related to floods.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On some layers it was observed that the chemistry of the sea water was changing as the deposition continues on the most recent layers of the Ciechocinek Formation, implying the possible formation of a brackish environment, probably due to the sedimentation of fluvial currents.

Include fine crystalline variety, coarse crystalline rhombohedra and fine crystalline aggregates impregnated by a mixture of undetermined Fehydroxides.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> The mineralization of the siderites on certain layers is associated to the abundance of organic matter, with the decay of it ending on a progressive carbonate supersaturation, with an early precipitation on the nucleus of the siderites. They reflect also the conditions of salinity on the water, showing alternances in short periods, associated with the abundance of organic matter.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> Muds and mudstones consist mainly of particles with the size of common clay, some with an admixture of silt; sandy muds and mudstones are also encountered in counterpart to the pure clays and claystones, without admixtures of other fractions, that are rare or extremely rare. Mudstones are poorly consolidated, tren to disintegration, swell and become plastic, being the only exceptional ones those the heavy sideritic mudstones, that range from a wide variety of colors, from  brown or cherry-red in colour, with an olive shade often appearing.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> On the other hand, there are abundant poorly consolidated [[Quartz]] sandstones, that are regularly intercalated with [[Silt]] and [[Siltstone]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Along the Sandstones, there are [[Chlorite]] and [[Kaolinite]] grains. Plant microremains are common, concentrated with mica flakes on lamination planes, while larger wood fragments, several cm long, are also moderately frequent.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Heavy minerals are present and include as the most common [[Euhedral]] forms such as [[Zircon]], [[Rutile]] and [[Tourmaline]], along with angular fragments of [[Rutile]], [[Garnet]] and [[Staurolite]], with finally well-rounded oval grains of Zircon, Rutile, Garnet and Tourmaline.

Because the Russian-made Kornet is an accurate, laser-guided weapon, it appeared that the bus was intentionally targeted. The attackers were never apprehended.

Israel said the yellow color of the bus made it easily identifiable and accused Hamas of \"crossing a line. The missile hit the bus after all but one of the children had been dropped off.

His mother was a singer,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} while his father was a composer and conductor for a symphony orchestra. His parents' experience with music allowed him to develop his talents as a young man.\n\n==Career==\n\nUvezian joined a jazz trio called the Lebanon Boys. They received a contract to perform at a hotel in [[Baghdad]] where they stayed for one year. After this, they signed a contract to perform at a hotel in [[Iran]]. While there, Avo received an invitation from [[Shah Reza Pahlavi]] to perform at his palace. In an interview with [[Cigar Aficionado]], Avo described this point in his career:<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cigaraficionado.com/article/avo-uvezian-the-man-in-the-white-suit-7486 |title=Avo Uvezian: The Man in the White Suit |last=Suckling |first=James |website=Cigar Aficionado |access-date=12 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"I spoke Farsi (referring to [[Persian language|Persian]]), so it sort of broke the ice with the Shah. I remember they were trying to dance the jitterbug and I said, 'You don't know how to dance that right. Let me show you.' We were invited back for two or three more events and finally, I became the Shah's pianist. The hotel didn't care since the Shah owned it.</blockquote>\n\nAfter a year of performing in Iran, the Shah arranged for Avo to travel to the [[United States of America]] in 1947. While living in New York, Avo played for multiple bands while studying classical piano and composition at the [[Juilliard School]].\n\nUvezian was drafted during the [[Korean War]] and sent to Fort Dix in New Jersey where he was put through infantry training. After impressing his officers with his musical talents, Uvezian was taken out of the Infantry and put into band training. When he arrived in Korea, the band would play at an Officers Club where they got paid twenty dollars a night. Uvezian was honorably discharged in 1952.\n\nAfter being discharged, Uvezian spent the next few years working with his father-in-law designing jewelry. This eventually brought him to Puerto Rico where he was paid to perform at the Palmas Del Mar resort.\n\n===Songwriting===\n\nUvezian claimed to have written the music for [[Frank Sinatra]]'s song ''[[Strangers in the Night]]'', even though the song is credited to [[Bert Kaempfert]].<ref name=\"NYT\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/28/nyregion/a-manhattan-theft-rooted-in-a-tale-of-songwriting-sinatra-and-cigars.html |title=A Manhattan Theft Rooted in a Tale of Songwriting, Sinatra and Cigars |last=Wilson |first=Michael |date=27 December 2015 |work=The New York Times |access-date=12 July 2018}}</ref> When he was living in New York, a friend who knew Frank Sintatra set up a meeting to discuss one of his melodies.

His mother was a singer,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} while his father was a composer and conductor for a symphony orchestra. His parents' experience with music allowed him to develop his talents as a young man.\n\n==Career==\n\nUvezian joined a jazz trio called the Lebanon Boys. They received a contract to perform at a hotel in [[Baghdad]] where they stayed for one year. After this, they signed a contract to perform at a hotel in [[Iran]]. While there, Avo received an invitation from [[Shah Reza Pahlavi]] to perform at his palace. In an interview with [[Cigar Aficionado]], Avo described this point in his career:<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cigaraficionado.com/article/avo-uvezian-the-man-in-the-white-suit-7486 |title=Avo Uvezian: The Man in the White Suit |last=Suckling |first=James |website=Cigar Aficionado |access-date=12 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"I spoke Farsi (referring to [[Persian language|Persian]]), so it sort of broke the ice with the Shah. I remember they were trying to dance the jitterbug and I said, 'You don't know how to dance that right. Let me show you.' We were invited back for two or three more events and finally, I became the Shah's pianist. The hotel didn't care since the Shah owned it.</blockquote>\n\nAfter a year of performing in Iran, the Shah arranged for Avo to travel to the [[United States of America]] in 1947. While living in New York, Avo played for multiple bands while studying classical piano and composition at the [[Juilliard School]].\n\nUvezian was drafted during the [[Korean War]] and sent to Fort Dix in New Jersey where he was put through infantry training. After impressing his officers with his musical talents, Uvezian was taken out of the Infantry and put into band training. When he arrived in Korea, the band would play at an Officers Club where they got paid twenty dollars a night. Uvezian was honorably discharged in 1952.\n\nAfter being discharged, Uvezian spent the next few years working with his father-in-law designing jewelry. This eventually brought him to Puerto Rico where he was paid to perform at the Palmas Del Mar resort.\n\n===Songwriting===\n\nUvezian claimed to have written the music for [[Frank Sinatra]]'s song ''[[Strangers in the Night]]'', even though the song is credited to [[Bert Kaempfert]].<ref name=\"NYT\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/28/nyregion/a-manhattan-theft-rooted-in-a-tale-of-songwriting-sinatra-and-cigars.html |title=A Manhattan Theft Rooted in a Tale of Songwriting, Sinatra and Cigars |last=Wilson |first=Michael |date=27 December 2015 |work=The New York Times |access-date=12 July 2018}}</ref> When he was living in New York, a friend who knew Frank Sintatra set up a meeting to discuss one of his melodies.

The team adopted the name '''The Revival''' in 2016, referencing \"reviving\" the classic tag team wrestling style of the 1980s, which has led to the two being compared favorably to [[The Brain Busters]] ([[Arn Anderson]] and [[Tully Blanchard]])\u2014one of the top teams of the 1980s. The team uses the phrase \"No flips, just fists\" to convey their more traditional, mat based in-ring style in contrast to the more high flying style of some contemporary teams.

The new format allowed for the participation of 12 club teams. The four semi-finalists of the previous year were to be seeded so as not to meet in the opening round of six games. The six losing first round teams would be divided into two groups of three to play a round-robin series with the winning team in each group going forward to join the six first-round winners in an open draw for the quarter-finals.\n\n==Results==\n===First round===\n\n{{football box collapsible\n| date = 23 April 2000\n| round = First round \n| team1 = [[Ballyduff Upper GAA|Ballyduff Upper]]\n| score = 2-10 -
