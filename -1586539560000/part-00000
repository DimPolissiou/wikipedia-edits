While Samar represents 2% and 5% of the Philippine population and territory respectively, 11% of all NPA related incidents have taken place on the island. Samar's terrain consists of densely forested mountainous areas, providing fertile ground for the conduct of guerrilla warfare.<ref name=Damw/>\n\nAn important factor in the spread of the rebellion was the issue of widespread landlessness. Land reforms provided only a limited solution for the millions of Philippine landless farmers. In the case of Samar, 40 landowning clans controlled approximately half of the island's agricultural land. Instances of landowner harassment and violence towards working class tenants led to escalating tensions between the two social groups.<ref name=Damw/> \n\nAnother factor into the Samar Island being a stronghold is historically the island has been among the most rebellious against the American Commonwealth rule, Spanish rule, and the Japanese occupation.<ref name=Damw/> \n\nIn 1976, NPA gained popular support among the inhabitants of Samar following vigilante actions against cattle rustling gangs. The following year, NPA transferred agents from [[Cebu]] and Manila where conditions were less favorable. The influx of troops enable NPA to form units fully engaged in guerrilla activities. In 1982, an unofficial communist government was formed, solidifying Samar as a communist stronghold. The 1980s downfall of the coconut industry greatly affected livelihoods of many Samaranos, further fueling the rebellion.

During the 1970s, 75% of the Philippine military was deployed on the island of [[Mindanao]], a Moro stronghold, despite the 1976 peace deal between the government and [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front|MILF]]. As of 2000, 40% of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|AFP]] troops continued to engage Moro rebels.<ref name=Damw />\n\nIn 2001, the AFP launched a campaign of selective [[extrajudicial killing]]s, in an attempt to suppress NPA activity. By targeting suspected rebel sympathizers, the campaign aimed to destroy the communist political infrastructure. The program was modeled after the [[Phoenix Program]], a U.S. project implemented during the [[Vietnam War]]. According to Dr William Norman Holden, [[University of Calgary]], security forces carried out a total of 1,335 extrajudicial killings between January 2001 \u2013 October 2012.<ref name=Damw />\n\nOn 9 August 2002, NPA was designated a [[Foreign Terrorist Organization]] (FTO) by the [[United States Department of State]].

Due to this declaration, the peace talks between the government and the NDF resumed on August 2016. The peace talks were carried out in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]].\n\nIn February 2017, the CPP-NPA-NDF declared that they will withdraw from the ceasefire, effective on 10 February 2017, due to the unfulfilled promise by the government that it will release all 392 political prisoners. However, the communists attacked and killed 3 soldiers before the withdrawal, which angered the government and made them declare a withdrawal from the ceasefire also. The peace talks was informally terminated and an all-out war was declared by the AFP after the withdrawal.\n\nIn March 2017, the government announced a new truce and the resumption of peace talks, to take place in April. The fifth round is planned to follow in June.{{fact|date=September 2019}}{{needs update|date=September 2019}}\n\nHowever, on 5 December 2017, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] declared the CPP and NPA as terrorist organizations after several attacks by the NPA against the government.

While Samar represents 2% and 5% of the Philippine population and territory respectively, 11% of all NPA related incidents have taken place on the island. Samar's terrain consists of densely forested mountainous areas, providing fertile ground for the conduct of guerrilla warfare.<ref name=Damw/>\n\nAn important factor in the spread of the rebellion was the issue of widespread landlessness. Land reforms provided only a limited solution for the millions of Philippine landless farmers. In the case of Samar, 40 landowning clans controlled approximately half of the island's agricultural land. Instances of landowner harassment and violence towards working class tenants led to escalating tensions between the two social groups.<ref name=Damw/> \n\nAnother factor into the Samar Island being a stronghold is historically the island has been among the most rebellious against the American Commonwealth rule, Spanish rule, and the Japanese occupation.<ref name=Damw/> \n\nIn 1976, NPA gained popular support among the inhabitants of Samar following vigilante actions against cattle rustling gangs. The following year, NPA transferred agents from [[Cebu]] and Manila where conditions were less favorable. The influx of troops enable NPA to form units fully engaged in guerrilla activities. In 1982, an unofficial communist government was formed, solidifying Samar as a communist stronghold. The 1980s downfall of the coconut industry greatly affected livelihoods of many Samaranos, further fueling the rebellion. Between January 2011 and December 2012, a total of 153 insurgency related incidents took place in [[Samar]], resulting in 21 deaths and 55 injuries.<ref name=Damw/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of the CPP-NPA-NDF rebellion]]\n* [[Maoism]]\n* [[Political killings in the Philippines (2001\u201310)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Communism in the Philippines}}\n{{The Marcoses}}\n{{Philippines topics}}\n{{Ongoing military conflicts}}\n{{Philippines conflicts}}\n{{Post-Cold War Asian conflicts}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:CPP-NPA-NDF rebellion}}\n[[Category:Communism in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Communist rebellions]]\n[[Category:20th-century conflicts]]\n[[Category:21st-century conflicts]]\n[[Category:Rebellions in the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Ongoing insurgencies]]\n[[Category:Maoism in Asia]]\n[[Category:Insurgencies in Asia]]\n[[Category:Military history of the Philippines]]\n[[Category:History of the Philippines (1965\u201386)]]\n[[Category:History of the Philippines (1986\u2013present)]]\n[[Category:Wars involving the Philippines]]\n[[Category:Proxy wars]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:National Democratic Front\u2192National Democratic Front (Philippines)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_rebellion_in_the_Philippines"}

In its business activities, DAMRI carries out city transport, transport within province, intercity transport, airport transport, tourism transport, logistics transport, transport to isolated areas and Inter-country transport.\n\n==History==\nDAMRI's history officially began in 1943, with the establishment of two enterprises during the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation of Java]]: {{nihongo|the Java Transportation Enterprise|\u30b8\u30e3\u30ef\u904b\u8f38\u4e8b\u696d\u793e|Jawa Un'yu Jigy\u014dsha|lead=yes|extra=[[Nihon-shiki]]: ''Zyawa Un'yu Zigy\u00f4sya''}} for freight logistics, and the {{nihongo|Automobile Board|\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u7dcf\u5c40|Jid\u014dsha S\u014dkyoku|lead=yes|extra=[[Nihon-shiki]]: ''Zid\u00f4sha S\u00f4kyoku''}} for passenger transport. After [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesia proclaimed independence in 1945]], Java Transportation Enterprise changed its name to Djawatan Pengangkoetan (Transport Enterprise) and Automobile Board changed its name to Djawatan Angkoetan Darat (Land Transport Enterprise) as both enterprises were taken over by the [[Ministry of Transportation (Indonesia)|Indonesian Department of Transportation]].<br>\n\nBy 25 November 1946, both enterprises were merged, through a [[Ministry of Transportation (Indonesia)|Ministry of Transportation]] announcement ({{lang-id|Maklumat Menteri Perhubungan No.01/DAM/46}}), into Djawatan Angkoetan Motor Repoeblik Indonesia (DAMRI). It was tasked to \"operate land transportation by buses, trucks and other types of motor vehicles\".<br>\n\nDAMRI has played an active role during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], especially during the resistance against the [[Politionele acties|Dutch military aggressions]].<br>\n\nIn 1961, DAMRI was reorganized as a General Director Board ({{lang-id|Badan Pimpinan Umum, BPU}}).

In its business activities, DAMRI carries out city transport, transport within province, intercity transport, airport transport, tourism transport, logistics transport, transport to isolated areas and Inter-country transport.\n\n==History==\nDAMRI's history officially began in 1943, with the establishment of two enterprises during the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation of Java]]: {{nihongo|the Java Transportation Enterprise|\u30b8\u30e3\u30ef\u904b\u8f38\u4e8b\u696d\u793e|Jawa Un'yu Jigy\u014dsha|lead=yes|extra=[[Nihon-shiki]]: ''Zyawa Un'yu Zigy\u00f4sya''}} for freight logistics, and the {{nihongo|Automobile Board|\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u7dcf\u5c40|Jid\u014dsha S\u014dkyoku|lead=yes|extra=[[Nihon-shiki]]: ''Zid\u00f4sha S\u00f4kyoku''}} for passenger transport. After [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesia proclaimed independence in 1945]], Java Transportation Enterprise changed its name to Djawatan Pengangkoetan (Transport Enterprise) and Automobile Board changed its name to Djawatan Angkoetan Darat (Land Transport Enterprise) as both enterprises were taken over by the [[Ministry of Transportation (Indonesia)|Indonesian Department of Transportation]].<br>\n\nBy 25 November 1946, both enterprises were merged, through a [[Ministry of Transportation (Indonesia)|Ministry of Transportation]] announcement ({{lang-id|Maklumat Menteri Perhubungan No.01/DAM/46}}), into Djawatan Angkoetan Motor Repoeblik Indonesia (DAMRI). It was tasked to \"operate land transportation by buses, trucks and other types of motor vehicles\".<br>\n\nDAMRI has played an active role during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], especially during the resistance against the [[Politionele acties|Dutch military aggressions]].<br>\n\nIn 1961, DAMRI was reorganized as a General Director Board ({{lang-id|Badan Pimpinan Umum, BPU}}). In 1965 the DAMRI BPU became a State Corporation ({{lang-id|Perusahaan Negara, PN}}), and in 1982 it was reorganized as a public corporation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.damrilogistics.co.id/tentang-kami| title=Sejarah Singkat| language=id| publisher=Damri Logistics|accessdate=March 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://damri.co.id/sejarah| title=Sejarah | language=id| publisher=Damri|accessdate=March 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==DAMRI offices==\n''' Perum DAMRI Head Office'''\n: Jl.

largest city in the [[Ancash Region]] of [[Peru]], and the capital of both [[Santa Province]] and [[Chimbote District]].\n\nThe city is located on the coast in [[Ferrol Bay]], 130 [[km]] south of [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] and {{convert|420|km|mi|sp=us}} north of [[Lima, Peru|Lima]] on the [[Pan-American Highway (South America)|North Pan-American highway]]. It is the start of a chain of important cities on the [[Peru]]vian north coast like [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], [[Chiclayo]] and [[Piura]]. The advantages of this geographic location made Chimbote into a transshipment junction for the [[Santa River]] [[valley]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1835, when General [[Andr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz|Santa Cruz]] granted Chimbote's first official acknowledgement, Chimbote was a village of [[fishermen]] with a population of no more than 800.\n\nIn 1871, an agreement was made with [[Henry Meiggs]] to build a [[railroad]] towards the interior of the country. Chimbote was classified as a [[port]], even though its population remained around 1,000. The opening of the [[Pan-American Highway (South America)|Pan-American Highway]] created easy access to Lima in the 1930s. In 1881, there was an attempt to cede a naval base to the U.S. in Chimbote Bay by Peru. The deal was blocked by Chile who sent its marines to occupy Chimbote after learning of the deal to cede a naval base to the U.S. Navy.\n\nIn 1940, Chimbote was still a small [[fishing port]], with only 2,400 inhabitants in an urbanized area of {{convert|80|ha|km2 sqmi|sp=us|abbr=out}}. In 1943, the government created the [[Corporaci\u00f3n Peruana del Santa]] (Peruvian Corporation of Santa). This entity assumed ownership of the [[railroad]], made improvements to the [[port]], and began work on a [[hydroelectric power station]] on the R\u00edo Santa (in the [[Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del Pato]] <nowiki>[Duck Canyon]</nowiki> in [[Huallanca District, Bolognesi|Huallanca]]). The first stage of the power station was inaugurated in 1958; also that year, an iron and steel plant was built.<ref group=\"nb\">The iron and steel plant is currently{{When|date=September 2010}} known as Empresa Sider\u00fargica del Per\u00fa S.A.A.</ref> By 1943, the first companies dedicated to the extraction of liver from the [[Sarda chiliensis|Pacific bonito]] fish arrived. This liver was sold for a high price abroad due to World&nbsp;War&nbsp;II.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Climate ===\nChimbote's climate is comfortable, despite being located in the tropics and in a desert. Although classified as subtropical, Chimbote's proximity to the cool [[Humboldt current]] leads to temperatures much cooler than those expected for a tropical desert, and is classified as a [[desert climate]]. On average, the warmest month is February with temperatures a little over {{convert|26|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}. September is considered the average coolest month, at around {{convert|13|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}. The annual average temperature is around 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F).\n\nThe city gets little to no precipitation; however, thick fog predominates through the months of May to November, usually overnight. Rainfall usually comes in February.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Chimbote (1961\u20131990)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 26.7\n|Feb high C = 27.8\n|Mar high C = 27.4\n|Apr high C = 25.5\n|May high C = 23.9\n|Jun high C = 22.8\n|Jul high C = 21.9\n|Aug high C = 21.5\n|Sep high C = 21.5\n|Oct high C = 22.4\n|Nov high C = 23.8\n|Dec high C = 25.3\n|year high C = 24.2\n|Jan low C = 17.4\n|Feb low C = 18.3\n|Mar low C = 18.3\n|Apr low C = 17.0\n|May low C = 15.7\n|Jun low C = 14.6\n|Jul low C = 13.9\n|Aug low C = 14.0\n|Sep low C = 13.7\n|Oct low C = 14.2\n|Nov low C = 14.8\n|Dec low C = 16.2\n|year low C = 15.7\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 1.6\n|Feb precipitation mm = 3.7\n|Mar precipitation mm = 3.6\n|Apr precipitation mm = 1.6\n|May precipitation mm = 0.2\n|Jun precipitation mm = 0.0\n|Jul precipitation mm = 0.3\n|Aug precipitation mm = 0.2\n|Sep precipitation mm = 0.0\n|Oct precipitation mm = 0.2\n|Nov precipitation mm = 0.2\n|Dec precipitation mm = 0.3\n|year precipitation mm = 11.9\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref name = NOAA>\n{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REGIII/PR/84531.TXT\n| title = Chimbote Climate Normals 1961\u20131990\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = April 23, 2015}}</ref>\n|date=April 2015\n}}\n\n==Population==\n[[Image:Satellite photo of Chimbote Peru.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Satellite image of Chimbote]]\nA large number of people migrated to Chimbote in the early 1970s. By that time, less than 5 percent of the people from Chimbote would truly consider themselves native; between 1960 and 1970, Chimbote's population multiplied by more than a hundred times. In 1900, the population of the port was 1,400; after 1970, it was 170,000. As of 2005, its population was 324,398.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Peru-Chimbote.html|title=Peru - Chimbote Agglomeration|work=www.citypopulation.de|last=Brinkhoff|first=Thomas|date=20 April 2007|accessdate=6 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702015740/http://www.citypopulation.de/Peru-Chimbote.html|archive-date=2 July 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe influx of residents was closely bound to the creation of the Corporaci\u00f3n Peruana del Santa, to the start and development of the [[fishing]] industry, and to the establishment of the iron and steel plant (\"[[SIDERPERU|Siderperu]]\"). Together, these multiplied the commercial and productive activities of the port. At the beginning of 1996, as [[Peru]]vian public companies were privatized,  the Peruvian-Brazilian company Acerco bought Siderperu.\n\n===Districts and neighborhoods===\nThe city of Chimbote, being a district itself, comprises 7 more districts: Santa, Coishco, Samanco, Nepe\u00f1a, Macate, Moro, C\u00e1ceres del Per\u00fa, and Nuevo Chimbote. The neighborhoods of El Barrio de Acero, Barrio Bolivar, El Progreso, Miraflores Alto and Miraflores Bajo surround Chimbote.\n\n==Economy==\n\nDuring the 1970s, the [[El Ni\u00f1o]] climate pattern, an [[earthquake]], and overfishing drastically affected the fishing industry, and restrictions were imposed to ensure its survival. More than 75 percent of Peru's fishing industry is based in Chimbote.\n\nChimbote is the largest fishing port in the world.<ref>https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2016/01/05/new-analysis-identifies-worlds-largest-and-busiest-fishing-ports</ref> Chimbote has more than 30 fish factories. Chimbote's active [[commerce]] and its diversified industrial development are characteristic of the city. Its population includes workers who have experience in [[fishing]], naval, [[canning]], and the iron-and-steel industry with the company [[SIDERPERU]].\n\nChimbote also has beaches that support tourism.\n\n===Peruvian anchoveta \"boom\"===\n\nShortly after the fish [[canning industry]] declined, the industrialization of [[Peruvian anchoveta|anchoveta]] fishing peaked. This attracted people from all over Peru, due to the high wages paid in the fishing industry at the time, fueling Chimbote's suburban growth. The strong migratory wave toward the city increased because of the serious crisis of the countryside in the 1960s, particularly in [[Ancash]], [[Cajamarca]] and the northern part of [[La Libertad Region]]. The axis of development moved from the [[Gossypium barbadense|Pima cotton]], [[sugarcane]], and [[rice]] plantations to the large city. In addition, Chimbote was a natural exit [[Channel (geography)|channel]] for the exports of the [[Santa Province|Santa valley]], and a starting point for the entry to the [[Callej\u00f3n de Huaylas]].\n\nThe Peruvian anchoveta [[Boom and bust|boom]] created wealth in the city, but it soon ended due to indiscriminate [[fishing]] that overwhelmed the [[bio-mass]]. An [[earthquake]] in 1970 damaged to the facilities of the [[Fishing industry|fishing industries]], causing [[unemployment]] and [[Poverty|impoverishment]]. During this period, the [[Diocese of Chimbote]] created the Social Welfare Commission, to organize diverse popular dining places in conjunction with [[UNICEF]].{{Vague|date=September 2010}} Since the 1960s, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh]] has served the poor at the Chimbote Mission, raising funds through the Chimbote Foundation.<ref name=\"Chimbote Foundation\">{{cite news|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/valleyindependent/news/s_192679.html|title=Local school children provide help for counterparts in Peru|last=Lelik|first=Emma Jene|date=5 May 2004|work=The Valley Independent|publisher=The Tribune-Review Publishing Company|page=1|accessdate=17 Dec 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502013106/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/valleyindependent/news/s_192679.html|archive-date=2 May 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Tourism==\n\nChimbote is surrounded by two natural bays, the Bay of Chimbote (or Ferrol) and the Bay of Samanco, both with excellent [[harbor]] conditions. Chimbote forms a [[conurbation]] with [[Nuevo Chimbote District]] to the south. Between these districts, the Humedales de Villa Mar\u00eda, a [[swamp]], is home to a local species of [[heron]], along with many species of [[frog]]s and fish. The swamp is formed by the [[Lacramarca River]].\n\nTo the south of the city, there are many beaches, such as [[Besique|Vesique]], [[Los Chim\u00fas (beach)|Los Chim\u00fas]], [[Tortugas beach|Tortugas]], [[Caleta Colorada]] and [[El Dorado beach|el Dorado]]. Also located near Chimbote is the [[Blanca Island|Isla Blanca]] (''white isle'', in English), which takes its name from the white color of the ground. Isla Blanca measures approximately {{convert|3200|m|ft|sp=us}} in length and {{convert|920|m|ft|sp=us}} in width, and reaches {{convert|204|m|ft|sp=us}} above sea level.\n\nLocated next to the city is the Cerro de la Juventud (Mountain of Youth), also called Cerro de la Paz (Mountain of Peace). Since 1985, this tourist attraction attracts hundreds annually. Visitors appreciate a panoramic view of Chimbote's bay from the top of this mountain. Tourists can also visit Isla Blanca Boulevard, which has many beautiful marble sculptures and fountains.\n\n[[File:Cruz Por La Paz - Cross at the top of Cerro de la Juventud aka Cerro de la Paz.jpg|thumb|Cross at the top of Cerro de la Juventud (Mountain of Youth) aka Cerro de la Paz (Mountain of Peace)]]\n\nFrom Chimbote, some short tourist circuits can be taken:\n* Chimbote - [[Casma]] - Sech\u00edn - Yaut\u00e1n\n* Chimbote - [[Nepe\u00f1a District|Nepe\u00f1a]] - [[San Jacinto (Peru)|San Jacinto]] - [[Moro (Peru)|Moro]] -[[Jimbe (Peru)|Jimbe]]\n* Chimbote - [[Santa Province|Santa]] - [[Huallanca District, Huaylas|Huallanca]]\n\nThe city is known for its ''[[ceviche]]'', a popular Peruvian dish whose ingredients include [[whitefish (fisheries term)|white fish]], [[octopus]], [[seashell]], [[squid]], [[crab]], and [[Capsicum annuum|red hot pepper]].\n\n[[File:Panoramica chimbote desde Cerro de la Paz.jpg|640px|thumb|center|View of the city of Chimbote from the Cerro de la Paz.]]\n\n==Festivals==\nChimbote has two important celebrations during the year: Holy Week and The Festivity of ''San Pedrito of Chimbote'' (also called ''Chimbote's Civic Anniversary'').\n*'''[[Festival of San Pedrito of Chimbote|Patronal feast of San Pedrito]]''', this festival has its origins in the 16th century with the first fishermen who populated Chimbote coming from [[Huanchaco]]. It is held from 23 to 30 June in devotion to the patron saint of fishermen San Pedro. The central feast day is on 29 June, the image of the saint is taken out in procession and It is paraded through the bay by boat.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.munisanta.gob.pe/web/institucional/nuestraciudad/nuestraciudad.php|title =Fiesta de San Pedrito|accessdate =3 September 2013|url-status =dead|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140510134350/http://www.munisanta.gob.pe/web/institucional/nuestraciudad/nuestraciudad.php|archivedate =10 May 2014|df =dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nThe [[Academia Preuniversitaria \"Perpetuo Socorro\"]] and the [[Catholic University Los Angeles of Chimbote]] are located in Chimbote.\n\n==Transportation==\n\nThe Chimbote-[[Huallanca District, Huaylas|Huallanca]] rail line, built in 1922, serves as a [[railway]] for [[coal]] and [[iron]] mines on the interior and a railway for the river valley by transporting [[rice]], [[cotton]], [[sugarcane]], and [[banana]]s.\n\n===Bus terminal===\n\nEl Chimbador Bus Terminal is Chimbote's primary ground transportation facility. The bus terminal is located outside of the city. It has become a vital connection for the region's workers, travelers and visitors, serving nearly 6,000 passengers a day.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Currently{{When|date=September 2010}} there are 30 bus carriers offering services for national and international travel.\n\n===Port===\nThe port of Chimbote is considered by some one of the most beautiful and safest ports in the [[Chala|Peruvian coast]]. It extends {{convert|12|km|mi|sp=us}}, from [[Caleta Colorada]] Bay (Red Creek Bay) in the north, where the present marine facilities are located, to [[Anconcillo]] in the south.\n\n===Airport===\nThe city is served by the [[Tnte.

[[Santa Province]] and [[Chimbote District]].\n\nThe city is located on the coast in [[Ferrol Bay]], 130 [[km]] south of [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]] and {{convert|420|km|mi|sp=us}} north of [[Lima, Peru|Lima]] on the [[Pan-American Highway (South America)|North Pan-American highway]]. It is the start of a chain of important cities on the [[Peru]]vian north coast like [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], [[Chiclayo]] and [[Piura]]. The advantages of this geographic location made Chimbote into a transshipment junction for the [[Santa River]] [[valley]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1835, when General [[Andr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz|Santa Cruz]] granted Chimbote's first official acknowledgement, Chimbote was a village of [[fishermen]] with a population of no more than 800.\n\nIn 1871, an agreement was made with [[Henry Meiggs]] to build a [[railroad]] towards the interior of the country. Chimbote was classified as a [[port]], even though its population remained around 1,000. The opening of the [[Pan-American Highway (South America)|Pan-American Highway]] created easy access to Lima in the 1930s. In 1881, there was an attempt to cede a naval base to the U.S. in Chimbote Bay by Peru. The deal was blocked by Chile who sent its marines to occupy Chimbote after learning of the deal to cede a naval base to the U.S. Navy.\n\nIn 1940, Chimbote was still a small [[fishing port]], with only 2,400 inhabitants in an urbanized area of {{convert|80|ha|km2 sqmi|sp=us|abbr=out}}. In 1943, the government created the [[Corporaci\u00f3n Peruana del Santa]] (Peruvian Corporation of Santa). This entity assumed ownership of the [[railroad]], made improvements to the [[port]], and began work on a [[hydroelectric power station]] on the R\u00edo Santa (in the [[Ca\u00f1\u00f3n del Pato]] <nowiki>[Duck Canyon]</nowiki> in [[Huallanca District, Bolognesi|Huallanca]]). The first stage of the power station was inaugurated in 1958; also that year, an iron and steel plant was built.<ref group=\"nb\">The iron and steel plant is currently{{When|date=September 2010}} known as Empresa Sider\u00fargica del Per\u00fa S.A.A.</ref> By 1943, the first companies dedicated to the extraction of liver from the [[Sarda chiliensis|Pacific bonito]] fish arrived. This liver was sold for a high price abroad due to World&nbsp;War&nbsp;II.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Climate ===\nChimbote's climate is comfortable, despite being located in the tropics and in a desert. Although classified as subtropical, Chimbote's proximity to the cool [[Humboldt current]] leads to temperatures much cooler than those expected for a tropical desert, and is classified as a [[desert climate]]. On average, the warmest month is February with temperatures a little over {{convert|26|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}. September is considered the average coolest month, at around {{convert|13|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|0}}. The annual average temperature is around 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F).\n\nThe city gets little to no precipitation; however, thick fog predominates through the months of May to November, usually overnight. Rainfall usually comes in February.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Chimbote (1961\u20131990)\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 26.7\n|Feb high C = 27.8\n|Mar high C = 27.4\n|Apr high C = 25.5\n|May high C = 23.9\n|Jun high C = 22.8\n|Jul high C = 21.9\n|Aug high C = 21.5\n|Sep high C = 21.5\n|Oct high C = 22.4\n|Nov high C = 23.8\n|Dec high C = 25.3\n|year high C = 24.2\n|Jan low C = 17.4\n|Feb low C = 18.3\n|Mar low C = 18.3\n|Apr low C = 17.0\n|May low C = 15.7\n|Jun low C = 14.6\n|Jul low C = 13.9\n|Aug low C = 14.0\n|Sep low C = 13.7\n|Oct low C = 14.2\n|Nov low C = 14.8\n|Dec low C = 16.2\n|year low C = 15.7\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 1.6\n|Feb precipitation mm = 3.7\n|Mar precipitation mm = 3.6\n|Apr precipitation mm = 1.6\n|May precipitation mm = 0.2\n|Jun precipitation mm = 0.0\n|Jul precipitation mm = 0.3\n|Aug precipitation mm = 0.2\n|Sep precipitation mm = 0.0\n|Oct precipitation mm = 0.2\n|Nov precipitation mm = 0.2\n|Dec precipitation mm = 0.3\n|year precipitation mm = 11.9\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref name = NOAA>\n{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REGIII/PR/84531.TXT\n| title = Chimbote Climate Normals 1961\u20131990\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = April 23, 2015}}</ref>\n|date=April 2015\n}}\n\n==Population==\n[[Image:Satellite photo of Chimbote Peru.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Satellite image of Chimbote]]\nA large number of people migrated to Chimbote in the early 1970s. By that time, less than 5 percent of the people from Chimbote would truly consider themselves native; between 1960 and 1970, Chimbote's population multiplied by more than a hundred times. In 1900, the population of the port was 1,400; after 1970, it was 170,000. As of 2005, its population was 324,398.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Peru-Chimbote.html|title=Peru - Chimbote Agglomeration|work=www.citypopulation.de|last=Brinkhoff|first=Thomas|date=20 April 2007|accessdate=6 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702015740/http://www.citypopulation.de/Peru-Chimbote.html|archive-date=2 July 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe influx of residents was closely bound to the creation of the Corporaci\u00f3n Peruana del Santa, to the start and development of the [[fishing]] industry, and to the establishment of the iron and steel plant (\"[[SIDERPERU|Siderperu]]\"). Together, these multiplied the commercial and productive activities of the port. At the beginning of 1996, as [[Peru]]vian public companies were privatized,  the Peruvian-Brazilian company Acerco bought Siderperu.\n\n===Districts and neighborhoods===\nThe city of Chimbote, being a district itself, comprises 7 more districts: Santa, Coishco, Samanco, Nepe\u00f1a, Macate, Moro, C\u00e1ceres del Per\u00fa, and Nuevo Chimbote. The neighborhoods of El Barrio de Acero, Barrio Bolivar, El Progreso, Miraflores Alto and Miraflores Bajo surround Chimbote.\n\n==Economy==\n\nDuring the 1970s, the [[El Ni\u00f1o]] climate pattern, an [[earthquake]], and overfishing drastically affected the fishing industry, and restrictions were imposed to ensure its survival. More than 75 percent of Peru's fishing industry is based in Chimbote.\n\nChimbote is the largest fishing port in the world.<ref>https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2016/01/05/new-analysis-identifies-worlds-largest-and-busiest-fishing-ports</ref> Chimbote has more than 30 fish factories. Chimbote's active [[commerce]] and its diversified industrial development are characteristic of the city. Its population includes workers who have experience in [[fishing]], naval, [[canning]], and the iron-and-steel industry with the company [[SIDERPERU]].\n\nChimbote also has beaches that support tourism.\n\n===Peruvian anchoveta \"boom\"===\n\nShortly after the fish [[canning industry]] declined, the industrialization of [[Peruvian anchoveta|anchoveta]] fishing peaked. This attracted people from all over Peru, due to the high wages paid in the fishing industry at the time, fueling Chimbote's suburban growth. The strong migratory wave toward the city increased because of the serious crisis of the countryside in the 1960s, particularly in [[Ancash]], [[Cajamarca]] and the northern part of [[La Libertad Region]]. The axis of development moved from the [[Gossypium barbadense|Pima cotton]], [[sugarcane]], and [[rice]] plantations to the large city. In addition, Chimbote was a natural exit [[Channel (geography)|channel]] for the exports of the [[Santa Province|Santa valley]], and a starting point for the entry to the [[Callej\u00f3n de Huaylas]].\n\nThe Peruvian anchoveta [[Boom and bust|boom]] created wealth in the city, but it soon ended due to indiscriminate [[fishing]] that overwhelmed the [[bio-mass]]. An [[earthquake]] in 1970 damaged to the facilities of the [[Fishing industry|fishing industries]], causing [[unemployment]] and [[Poverty|impoverishment]]. During this period, the [[Diocese of Chimbote]] created the Social Welfare Commission, to organize diverse popular dining places in conjunction with [[UNICEF]].{{Vague|date=September 2010}} Since the 1960s, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh]] has served the poor at the Chimbote Mission, raising funds through the Chimbote Foundation.<ref name=\"Chimbote Foundation\">{{cite news|url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/valleyindependent/news/s_192679.html|title=Local school children provide help for counterparts in Peru|last=Lelik|first=Emma Jene|date=5 May 2004|work=The Valley Independent|publisher=The Tribune-Review Publishing Company|page=1|accessdate=17 Dec 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502013106/http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/valleyindependent/news/s_192679.html|archive-date=2 May 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Tourism==\n\nChimbote is surrounded by two natural bays, the Bay of Chimbote (or Ferrol) and the Bay of Samanco, both with excellent [[harbor]] conditions. Chimbote forms a [[conurbation]] with [[Nuevo Chimbote District]] to the south. Between these districts, the Humedales de Villa Mar\u00eda, a [[swamp]], is home to a local species of [[heron]], along with many species of [[frog]]s and fish. The swamp is formed by the [[Lacramarca River]].\n\nTo the south of the city, there are many beaches, such as [[Besique|Vesique]], [[Los Chim\u00fas (beach)|Los Chim\u00fas]], [[Tortugas beach|Tortugas]], [[Caleta Colorada]] and [[El Dorado beach|el Dorado]]. Also located near Chimbote is the [[Blanca Island|Isla Blanca]] (''white isle'', in English), which takes its name from the white color of the ground. Isla Blanca measures approximately {{convert|3200|m|ft|sp=us}} in length and {{convert|920|m|ft|sp=us}} in width, and reaches {{convert|204|m|ft|sp=us}} above sea level.\n\nLocated next to the city is the Cerro de la Juventud (Mountain of Youth), also called Cerro de la Paz (Mountain of Peace). Since 1985, this tourist attraction attracts hundreds annually. Visitors appreciate a panoramic view of Chimbote's bay from the top of this mountain. Tourists can also visit Isla Blanca Boulevard, which has many beautiful marble sculptures and fountains.\n\n[[File:Cruz Por La Paz - Cross at the top of Cerro de la Juventud aka Cerro de la Paz.jpg|thumb|Cross at the top of Cerro de la Juventud (Mountain of Youth) aka Cerro de la Paz (Mountain of Peace)]]\n\nFrom Chimbote, some short tourist circuits can be taken:\n* Chimbote - [[Casma]] - Sech\u00edn - Yaut\u00e1n\n* Chimbote - [[Nepe\u00f1a District|Nepe\u00f1a]] - [[San Jacinto (Peru)|San Jacinto]] - [[Moro (Peru)|Moro]] -[[Jimbe (Peru)|Jimbe]]\n* Chimbote - [[Santa Province|Santa]] - [[Huallanca District, Huaylas|Huallanca]]\n\nThe city is known for its ''[[ceviche]]'', a popular Peruvian dish whose ingredients include [[whitefish (fisheries term)|white fish]], [[octopus]], [[seashell]], [[squid]], [[crab]], and [[Capsicum annuum|red hot pepper]].\n\n[[File:Panoramica chimbote desde Cerro de la Paz.jpg|640px|thumb|center|View of the city of Chimbote from the Cerro de la Paz.]]\n\n==Festivals==\nChimbote has two important celebrations during the year: Holy Week and The Festivity of ''San Pedrito of Chimbote'' (also called ''Chimbote's Civic Anniversary'').\n*'''[[Festival of San Pedrito of Chimbote|Patronal feast of San Pedrito]]''', this festival has its origins in the 16th century with the first fishermen who populated Chimbote coming from [[Huanchaco]]. It is held from 23 to 30 June in devotion to the patron saint of fishermen San Pedro. The central feast day is on 29 June, the image of the saint is taken out in procession and It is paraded through the bay by boat.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.munisanta.gob.pe/web/institucional/nuestraciudad/nuestraciudad.php|title =Fiesta de San Pedrito|accessdate =3 September 2013|url-status =dead|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140510134350/http://www.munisanta.gob.pe/web/institucional/nuestraciudad/nuestraciudad.php|archivedate =10 May 2014|df =dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nThe [[Academia Preuniversitaria \"Perpetuo Socorro\"]] and the [[Catholic University Los Angeles of Chimbote]] are located in Chimbote.\n\n==Transportation==\n\nThe Chimbote-[[Huallanca District, Huaylas|Huallanca]] rail line, built in 1922, serves as a [[railway]] for [[coal]] and [[iron]] mines on the interior and a railway for the river valley by transporting [[rice]], [[cotton]], [[sugarcane]], and [[banana]]s.\n\n===Bus terminal===\n\nEl Chimbador Bus Terminal is Chimbote's primary ground transportation facility. The bus terminal is located outside of the city. It has become a vital connection for the region's workers, travelers and visitors, serving nearly 6,000 passengers a day.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Currently{{When|date=September 2010}} there are 30 bus carriers offering services for national and international travel.\n\n===Port===\nThe port of Chimbote is considered by some one of the most beautiful and safest ports in the [[Chala|Peruvian coast]]. It extends {{convert|12|km|mi|sp=us}}, from [[Caleta Colorada]] Bay (Red Creek Bay) in the north, where the present marine facilities are located, to [[Anconcillo]] in the south.\n\n===Airport===\nThe city is served by the [[Tnte.

He was educated first by Edgcombe Rimell, curate of [[Mabe, Cornwall|Mabe]], and afterwards at Bellevue Academy, [[Penryn, Cornwall|Penryn]].<ref name=\"dnb\">{{cite web | last =Boase | first =G.

His steadiness and ability soon won for him the esteem of his employers, and in 1843, when they had built the Leigh water engine for the drainage of [[Haarlemmermeer|Haarlem Lake]], he was sent to the [[Netherlands]] to superintend its erection. As the machinery could not be landed for some time on account of the ice, he went to the village school at Sassenheym to learn [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. In six months he wrote and spoke it with fluency. On the death of the mechanical engineer in charge of the steam machinery on the drainage works in 1845, he succeeded to that post, when he planned and erected the half-weg engine. The lake when drained added {{convert|47000|acre|km2}} of rich [[Alluvium|alluvial]] soil to the country, and being situated in the midst of populous provinces proved of material importance. [[William II of the Netherlands|King William]] expressed his satisfaction, and on 13 March 1848 Husband was elected a member of the Koninklijk Instituut van Ingenieurs. In 1849 he suffered so severely from ague, from the effects of which he never fully recovered, that he resigned his situation and returned to England.<ref name=\"dnb\"/>\n\n===Other works===\nWhile in the Netherlands, in conjunction with his friends Colonel Wiebeking and Professor Munnich, he invented a plan for drying and warehousing grain at a small cost, and preserving it in good condition for years. On 2 May 1851 he submitted to [[Sir George Grey, 2nd Baronet|Sir George Grey]] a plan for a powder magazine in the [[River Mersey|Mersey]], on the recommendation of the [[Liverpool City Council|Liverpool town council]]. At the invitation of T. E. Blackwell, C.E., he went to [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]] to assist in some works in the [[Port of Bristol|Bristol docks]], when he planned a bridge for the [[Cumberland Basin (Bristol)|Cumberland basin]]. In September 1852 he undertook the management of the London business of the firm of Harvey & Company; in June 1854 he returned to Hayle to take the charge of the engineering department, and in 1863 became managing partner. He resumed the management of the business in London in October 1885, where he remained until his death.<ref name=\"dnb\"/>\n\nIn practical knowledge of [[Hydraulic machinery|hydraulic]] and mining machinery Husband was surpassed by few. In June 1859 he submitted to the [[admiralty]] a plan for a floating [[Artillery battery|battery]], and patented the following inventions: the balance valve for water-work purposes (this superseded the costly stand-pipe), the four-beat pump-valve, a safety plug for the prevention of boiler explosions, and a safety equilibrium cataract, used with the Cornish pumping engine for the prevention of accidents. He also effected many improvements in pneumatic ore stamps, finally perfecting and patenting those now known as Husband's oscillating cylinder stamps.<ref name=\"dnb\"/>\n\nDuring the last two years of his life he was employed in carrying out contracts for the pumping machinery at the [[Severn Tunnel]], and at the time of his death was planning further improvements in Cornish pumping engines.<ref name=\"dnb\"/>\n\n===Professional and other interests===\nOn 1 May 1866 he was elected a member of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]], and during 1881 and 1882 served as president of the [[Miners Association]] and [[Royal Institution of Cornwall]]. He actively supported the [[Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society]]. In 1855 he planned and superintended the erection of a breakwater at [[Porthleven]] in [[Mount's Bay]], thereby making it a safe harbour. He helped to secure a water supply for Hayle and a system of drainage. He originated and became first captain of the 8th Cornwall artillery volunteers in April 1860, a post which he held till 1865. He established science classes at Hayle in connection with South Kensington. In [[Spectroscopy|spectrum analysis]] and astronomy he took a great interest, and made many observations with a {{convert|10.25|in|mm|adj=on}} telescope.

He was educated first by Edgcombe Rimell, curate of [[Mabe, Cornwall|Mabe]], and afterwards at Bellevue Academy, [[Penryn, Cornwall|Penryn]].<ref name=\"dnb\">{{cite web | last =Boase | first =G.

His steadiness and ability soon won for him the esteem of his employers, and in 1843, when they had built the Leigh water engine for the drainage of [[Haarlemmermeer|Haarlem Lake]], he was sent to the [[Netherlands]] to superintend its erection. As the machinery could not be landed for some time on account of the ice, he went to the village school at Sassenheym to learn [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. In six months he wrote and spoke it with fluency. On the death of the mechanical engineer in charge of the steam machinery on the drainage works in 1845, he succeeded to that post, when he planned and erected the half-weg engine. The lake when drained added {{convert|47000|acre|km2}} of rich [[Alluvium|alluvial]] soil to the country, and being situated in the midst of populous provinces proved of material importance. [[William II of the Netherlands|King William]] expressed his satisfaction, and on 13 March 1848 Husband was elected a member of the Koninklijk Instituut van Ingenieurs. In 1849 he suffered so severely from ague, from the effects of which he never fully recovered, that he resigned his situation and returned to England.<ref name=\"dnb\"/>\n\n===Other works===\nWhile in the Netherlands, in conjunction with his friends Colonel Wiebeking and Professor Munnich, he invented a plan for drying and warehousing grain at a small cost, and preserving it in good condition for years. On 2 May 1851 he submitted to [[Sir George Grey, 2nd Baronet|Sir George Grey]] a plan for a powder magazine in the [[River Mersey|Mersey]], on the recommendation of the [[Liverpool City Council|Liverpool town council]]. At the invitation of T. E. Blackwell, C.E., he went to [[Clifton, Bristol|Clifton]] to assist in some works in the [[Port of Bristol|Bristol docks]], when he planned a bridge for the [[Cumberland Basin (Bristol)|Cumberland basin]]. In September 1852 he undertook the management of the London business of the firm of Harvey & Company; in June 1854 he returned to Hayle to take the charge of the engineering department, and in 1863 became managing partner. He resumed the management of the business in London in October 1885, where he remained until his death.<ref name=\"dnb\"/>\n\nIn practical knowledge of [[Hydraulic machinery|hydraulic]] and mining machinery Husband was surpassed by few. In June 1859 he submitted to the [[admiralty]] a plan for a floating [[Artillery battery|battery]], and patented the following inventions: the balance valve for water-work purposes (this superseded the costly stand-pipe), the four-beat pump-valve, a safety plug for the prevention of boiler explosions, and a safety equilibrium cataract, used with the Cornish pumping engine for the prevention of accidents. He also effected many improvements in pneumatic ore stamps, finally perfecting and patenting those now known as Husband's oscillating cylinder stamps.<ref name=\"dnb\"/>\n\nDuring the last two years of his life he was employed in carrying out contracts for the pumping machinery at the [[Severn Tunnel]], and at the time of his death was planning further improvements in Cornish pumping engines.<ref name=\"dnb\"/>\n\n===Professional and other interests===\nOn 1 May 1866 he was elected a member of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]], and during 1881 and 1882 served as president of the [[Miners Association]] and [[Royal Institution of Cornwall]]. He actively supported the [[Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society]]. In 1855 he planned and superintended the erection of a breakwater at [[Porthleven]] in [[Mount's Bay]], thereby making it a safe harbour. He helped to secure a water supply for Hayle and a system of drainage. He originated and became first captain of the 8th Cornwall artillery volunteers in April 1860, a post which he held till 1865. He established science classes at Hayle in connection with South Kensington. In [[Spectroscopy|spectrum analysis]] and astronomy he took a great interest, and made many observations with a {{convert|10.25|in|mm|adj=on}} telescope. On 28 and 29 March 1887, in company with Sir [[John Hawkshaw]] and Mr. Hayter, C.E., he was employed in inspecting nine pumping engines which his firm had erected in the Severn tunnel for keeping down the water.\n\n===Marriage and death===\nOn 20 June 1850 he married Anne, fifth daughter of Edward Nanney, by whom he had a family of four children. He died on 10 April 1887 of an attack of gall stones at his lodgings, 26 Sion Hill, Clifton, Bristol, and was buried at [[St. Erth]], Cornwall, 16 April. In 1890 a sum of \u00a3800. was raised to establish a Husband scholarship for the technical education of miners.<ref name=\"dnb\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{DNB|wstitle=Husband, William}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Husband, William}}\n[[Category:1822 births]]\n[[Category:1887 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Mylor, Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Mining in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Cornish engineers]]\n[[Category:British civil engineers]]\n[[Category:Haarlemmermeer]]\n", "name_user": "Gazamp", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNotes:AddedPortal:Cornwall", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Husband"}
