It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on February 20, 2011. The episode follows high school student [[Chris Griffin]], as he attempts to find a new hobby. He soon comes across a puppeteer named Franz, who befriends Chris and introduces him to his vast collection of puppets. Meanwhile, Chris' neighbor, [[Herbert (Family Guy)|Herbert]], tries to warn him of Franz's past as a [[Nazi]] during [[World War II]], but his attempts are largely unsuccessful.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Patrick Meighan (writer)|Patrick Meighan]] and directed by [[Cyndi Tang]].

The episode featured guest performances by [[Ralph Garman]] and [[Alan Tudyk]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] decide that [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] needs a new hobby; Peter and Chris begin collecting stamps and drinking, but Chris is not interested in either. He soon discovers a puppet shop, and befriends the shop's owner, Franz Gutentag. The two bond over the puppets, creating their own puppets and stories (which Chris describes as the \"Germanest thing he's ever seen\"), but [[Herbert (Family Guy)|Herbert]] realizes that Franz is someone from his past. Herbert confronts Peter and Lois, telling them that Franz is a [[Nazi]] [[SS]] lieutenant named Franz Schlechtnacht, whom he had met during [[World War II]] after being shot down in his plane. He was then taken to a [[Nazi concentration camp|concentration camp]] by the Nazis, after he was believed to be [[Homosexuality|Gay]], that was run by Franz, and was forced to undergo hard labor. Peter and Lois are reluctant to believe Herbert, instead deciding to invite Franz over for dinner. The next day, Chris visits Franz, and asks him if he is a Nazi. Franz immediately rejects the notion, and Peter enters the home to invite Franz over for dinner. Needing to use the restroom, Chris soon discovers a room filled with Nazi memorabilia.\n\nSoon after, Franz finds that Chris has discovered his secret and decides to take Peter and Chris to the basement to murder them. Successfully able to wrestle the gun from Franz, Chris is faced with whether to shoot his father or Franz, questioning which one is his \"real father.\" Peter then points out that he and Franz look nothing alike; confused, Chris asks when is his birthday \u2014 a question that Peter does not know the answer to. When Franz answers the question correctly, Chris shoots Peter, causing Franz to grab the gun from him and taking the two hostage. The next morning, Lois visits Franz, telling him that Chris and Peter did not return home. Franz tells Lois that he has not seen the two, but the two discover a small window in the basement that they have become trapped in. Chris sees Herbert come by and begs Herbert to save them. Dressing in his military uniform, Herbert storms Franz's home. Franz then rips off his sweater vest and shirt to reveal his Nazi uniform and the two veterans begin fighting; however, the fight is considerably slow given their respective ages and includes a visit from Franz's personal minder when he is unable to rise from the couch after he and Herbert stop to take their pills. Finally, however, Franz stumbles and falls off his front porch step, Herbert tries to grab him, but Franz grabs short of his hand and is killed instantly by the fall. Herbert then salutes Franz's corpse and says \"Say goodnight you Nazi bastard.\" After rescuing Chris and Peter, Chris thanks Herbert, and the two become friends again.

It was first announced at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhen [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] and [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] decide to go and see ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' together, Peter sneaks in [[liquor]], and the two become extremely intoxicated, disrupting the entire audience. [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] is then called upon to arrest them. In court, the two are ordered to attend [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] for thirty days, much to their annoyance. At the first meeting, Peter is told that alcohol is a bad part of his life, with Brian becoming reluctant to give up drinking. Realizing that the people in Alcoholics Anonymous have nowhere to drink without being judged, Brian and Peter decide to bring several cases of [[beer]] to their next meeting. Joe is once again called upon, under a noise complaint, causing everyone to transform the center into a [[Church (building)|church]] and spring into a large musical number, in order to trick Joe into leaving.\n\nAfterwards, Peter decides to drive home drunk, and ends up passing out at the wheel and crashing into a tree, killing him instantly. [[Death (Family Guy)|Death]] arrives, and Peter's soul exits his body. Death decides to give Peter a second chance, and takes Peter into the future, where he sees what will result from his continued excessive drinking: an abusive, drunken and filthy man who tortures his family with [[cigar]] burns (which [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] enjoys) and has sex with his boss [[Angela (Family Guy)|Angela]] while at work. After seeing this, Peter wishes that he had never touched a drop of alcohol in his life, so Death also shows Peter what his life would be like without alcohol: he is extremely cheerful, has a different voice and drinks [[milk]] with uptight friends at the Drunken Clam, and he also does not know Joe or [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]], but instead looks at them as noisy and uncouth. Peter also does not like this version of himself at all. Death explains to Peter that he doesn't need to give up alcohol altogether, but to drink responsibly, and persuades him that he can live his life without being totally dependent on alcohol.\n\nAfterwards, whenever Peter buys a 6-pack of beer, he takes three cans and throws them in the garbage, thus allowing him to drink in moderation, much to Lois' delight. The episode ends at a landfill site, where the seagulls become extremely intoxicated from drinking the beer that Peter threw away.\n\n==Production and development==\n[[File:Seth MacFarlane by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|right|thumb|155px|Seth MacFarlane announced the episode at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con.]]\nFirst announced at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] by series creator and executive producer [[Seth MacFarlane]],<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/110/1108415p1.html |title=SDCC 10: Family Guy Returns With Jedi |website=IGN |accessdate=2011-01-22 |date=2010-07-27 |last=Iverson |first=Dan}}</ref> the episode was written by series regular [[Brian Scully]] and directed by series regular [[John Holmquist]] during the course of the [[Family Guy (season 9)|ninth production season]].<ref name=\"episode\">{{cite episode |title=The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair|series=Family Guy |serieslink=Family Guy |credits=Scully, Brian; Holmquist, John; MacFarlane, Seth|network=Fox |airdate=2010-02-13 |season=09 |number=10}}</ref> Series veterans [[Peter Shin]] and [[James Purdum]], both of whom having previously served as animation directors, served as supervising directors for the episode,<ref name=\"episode\"/> with [[Andrew Goldberg (writer)|Andrew Goldberg]], Alex Carter, [[Elaine Ko]], Spencer Porter and [[Aaron Blitzstein]] serving as [[staff writer]]s for the episode.<ref name=\"episode\"/> Composer [[Walter Murphy]], who has worked on the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for \"Friends of Peter G\".<ref name=\"episode\"/>\n\nIn addition to the regular cast, voice actor [[H.

It aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on February 13, 2011. The episode follows [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] as they are forced to join [[Alcoholics Anonymous]], due to their excessive drinking, much to their chagrin. Soon, however, Peter crashes his car while driving home drunk, and is approached by [[List of characters in Family Guy#Death|Death]], who shows him what his life will be like if he continues to drink alcohol, as well if he had never drank at all. Death persuades Peter that he has the willpower to put the bottle down sometimes.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Brian Scully]] and directed by [[John Holmquist]]. It received mostly mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 5.99 million homes in its original airing.<ref>{{cite web|title=TV Ratings Sunday: 'Grammy Awards' Rise; 'Desperate Housewives,' 'Brothers & Sisters,' 'Makeover' Hit Lows; 'American Dad,' 'Simpsons,' 'Bob's Burger's,' 'Family Guy' Down|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/02/14/tv-ratings-sunday-grammy-awards-rise-to-multi-year-highs/82526|work=TV By the Numbers|accessdate=2011-02-15|date=2011-01-14|last=Gorman |first=Bill}}</ref> The episode featured guest performances by [[H. Jon Benjamin]], [[Adam Carolla]], [[Carrie Fisher]], [[Phil LaMarr]], [[Jessica Stroup]] and [[Laura Vandervoort]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. It was first announced at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhen [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] and [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] decide to go and see ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' together, Peter sneaks in [[liquor]], and the two become extremely intoxicated, disrupting the entire audience. [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] is then called upon to arrest them. In court, the two are ordered to attend [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] for thirty days, much to their annoyance. At the first meeting, Peter is told that alcohol is a bad part of his life, with Brian becoming reluctant to give up drinking. Realizing that the people in Alcoholics Anonymous have nowhere to drink without being judged, Brian and Peter decide to bring several cases of [[beer]] to their next meeting. Joe is once again called upon, under a noise complaint, causing everyone to transform the center into a [[Church (building)|church]] and spring into a large musical number, in order to trick Joe into leaving.\n\nAfterwards, Peter decides to drive home drunk, and ends up passing out at the wheel and crashing into a tree, killing him instantly. [[Death (Family Guy)|Death]] arrives, and Peter's soul exits his body. Death decides to give Peter a second chance, and takes Peter into the future, where he sees what will result from his continued excessive drinking: an abusive, drunken and filthy man who tortures his family with [[cigar]] burns (which [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] enjoys) and has sex with his boss [[Angela (Family Guy)|Angela]] while at work. After seeing this, Peter wishes that he had never touched a drop of alcohol in his life, so Death also shows Peter what his life would be like without alcohol: he is extremely cheerful, has a different voice and drinks [[milk]] with uptight friends at the Drunken Clam, and he also does not know Joe or [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]], but instead looks at them as noisy and uncouth. Peter also does not like this version of himself at all. Death explains to Peter that he doesn't need to give up alcohol altogether, but to drink responsibly, and persuades him that he can live his life without being totally dependent on alcohol.\n\nAfterwards, whenever Peter buys a 6-pack of beer, he takes three cans and throws them in the garbage, thus allowing him to drink in moderation, much to Lois' delight. The episode ends at a landfill site, where the seagulls become extremely intoxicated from drinking the beer that Peter threw away.\n\n==Production and development==\n[[File:Seth MacFarlane by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|right|thumb|155px|Seth MacFarlane announced the episode at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con.]]\nFirst announced at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] by series creator and executive producer [[Seth MacFarlane]],<ref name=\"ign\">{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/110/1108415p1.html |title=SDCC 10: Family Guy Returns With Jedi |website=IGN |accessdate=2011-01-22 |date=2010-07-27 |last=Iverson |first=Dan}}</ref> the episode was written by series regular [[Brian Scully]] and directed by series regular [[John Holmquist]] during the course of the [[Family Guy (season 9)|ninth production season]].<ref name=\"episode\">{{cite episode |title=The Hand That Rocks the Wheelchair|series=Family Guy |serieslink=Family Guy |credits=Scully, Brian; Holmquist, John; MacFarlane, Seth|network=Fox |airdate=2010-02-13 |season=09 |number=10}}</ref> Series veterans [[Peter Shin]] and [[James Purdum]], both of whom having previously served as animation directors, served as supervising directors for the episode,<ref name=\"episode\"/> with [[Andrew Goldberg (writer)|Andrew Goldberg]], Alex Carter, [[Elaine Ko]], Spencer Porter and [[Aaron Blitzstein]] serving as [[staff writer]]s for the episode.<ref name=\"episode\"/> Composer [[Walter Murphy]], who has worked on the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for \"Friends of Peter G\".<ref name=\"episode\"/>\n\nIn addition to the regular cast, voice actor [[H.

It premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on March 22, 2009. The episode is centered on housewife [[Lois Griffin]]'s employment at [[Fox News Channel]], despite the warnings of [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]. On her first day on the job, she is assigned to do a report on [[Michael Moore]]'s perceived [[homosexuality]], but it is rejected when the expos\u00e9 involves conservative [[Republicanism|Republican]] [[Rush Limbaugh]]. Meanwhile, husband [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and son [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] decide to create their own animated [[sitcom]]. The [[pilot episode]] is a success with the CEO, but Peter decides not to air it when it is suggested that it be edited.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Matt Fleckenstein]] and directed by [[Pete Michels]]. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], the episode was watched by 7.45 million viewers in its original airing in the United States. The episode featured guest performances by [[Seth Rogen]], [[Meredith Baxter]], [[Peter Chernin]], [[Fred Savage]], [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]], [[Ed Helms]], [[Sharon Tay]], [[John Moschitta, Jr.]] and [[Mark DeCarlo]]. \"Fox-y Lady\", along with the six remaining episodes from ''Family Guy''{{'}}s [[Family Guy (season 7)|seventh season]] and the first eight episodes from the [[Family Guy (season 8)|eighth season]], was released on a three-disc [[DVD]] set in the United States on June 15, 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nRhonda Latimer, an aging reporter for [[Fox News Channel]] who is idolized by viewers because of her good looks, is dismissed when the network's first [[High-definition television|high-definition]] broadcast exposes her wrinkles, leaving a job opportunity open. [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] auditions for the part, ignoring [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]'s warnings about Fox News' [[Fox News Channel controversies|conservative bias]], and she is chosen as the new reporter. On her first day reporting, she is assigned to do an expos\u00e9 on [[Michael Moore]] to prove that he is a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]. When she spies on him outside his house, she sees [[Rush Limbaugh]] coming out, leading her to conclude that Limbaugh and Moore are in a gay relationship. However, Fox News refuses to allow any material against fellow conservative Limbaugh to be broadcast, leading Lois to realize that Brian was right about them. The two decide to take the story into their own hands and confront who they expect to be Moore and a naked Limbaugh in the same bedroom, only to discover that the both of them are portrayed by [[Fred Savage]], who has created bodysuits of them in order to continue his acting career. A flabbergasted Lois ultimately decides to report his story instead.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], with help from [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], decides to create an animated series about a trio of [[Disability|handicapped]] [[duck]]s entitled ''Handi-Quacks'' due to Lois' newfound connections with Fox. Meg's reasonable, albeit banal, suggestions are ignored by Peter in favor of Chris' outlandish ideas, and Peter eventually fires her. He and Chris settle on developing the show's [[pilot episode]] around a joke involving a [[wood-burning stove|wood stove]] and a [[house of cards]], and invite [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]], [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] and [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] to voice the characters. Although it is suggested that the crudely-animated and written pilot will likely fail, [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Peter Chernin]] enjoys it and agrees to produce the show, but Peter is insulted when he suggests that the character Poopyface Tomato Nose's nose be a [[plum]] instead of a [[tomato]]. Peter's passion for ''Handi-Quacks'' impresses Chernin, who allows him to retain complete creative control over its production, but a still-aggrieved Peter rebuffs the deal entirely, which he quickly regrets.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Lois is revealed to no longer work as a reporter; she does not bother to reveal how or why due to a [[Reset button technique|perceived lack of interest from the audience]].\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Seth Rogen by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|170px|Actor [[Seth Rogen]] guest starred in the episode.]]\n\n\"Fox-y Lady\" is the tenth episode of ''Family Guy''{{'}}s seventh season.

It premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on March 22, 2009. The episode is centered on housewife [[Lois Griffin]]'s employment at [[Fox News Channel]], despite the warnings of [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]. On her first day on the job, she is assigned to do a report on [[Michael Moore]]'s perceived [[homosexuality]], but it is rejected when the expos\u00e9 involves conservative [[Republicanism|Republican]] [[Rush Limbaugh]]. Meanwhile, husband [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and son [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] decide to create their own animated [[sitcom]]. The [[pilot episode]] is a success with the CEO, but Peter decides not to air it when it is suggested that it be edited.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Matt Fleckenstein]] and directed by [[Pete Michels]]. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], the episode was watched by 7.45 million viewers in its original airing in the United States. The episode featured guest performances by [[Seth Rogen]], [[Meredith Baxter]], [[Peter Chernin]], [[Fred Savage]], [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]], [[Ed Helms]], [[Sharon Tay]], [[John Moschitta, Jr.]] and [[Mark DeCarlo]]. \"Fox-y Lady\", along with the six remaining episodes from ''Family Guy''{{'}}s [[Family Guy (season 7)|seventh season]] and the first eight episodes from the [[Family Guy (season 8)|eighth season]], was released on a three-disc [[DVD]] set in the United States on June 15, 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nRhonda Latimer, an aging reporter for [[Fox News Channel]] who is idolized by viewers because of her good looks, is dismissed when the network's first [[High-definition television|high-definition]] broadcast exposes her wrinkles, leaving a job opportunity open. [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] auditions for the part, ignoring [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]'s warnings about Fox News' [[Fox News Channel controversies|conservative bias]], and she is chosen as the new reporter. On her first day reporting, she is assigned to do an expos\u00e9 on [[Michael Moore]] to prove that he is a [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]. When she spies on him outside his house, she sees [[Rush Limbaugh]] coming out, leading her to conclude that Limbaugh and Moore are in a gay relationship. However, Fox News refuses to allow any material against fellow conservative Limbaugh to be broadcast, leading Lois to realize that Brian was right about them. The two decide to take the story into their own hands and confront who they expect to be Moore and a naked Limbaugh in the same bedroom, only to discover that the both of them are portrayed by [[Fred Savage]], who has created bodysuits of them in order to continue his acting career. A flabbergasted Lois ultimately decides to report his story instead.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], with help from [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], decides to create an animated series about a trio of [[Disability|handicapped]] [[duck]]s entitled ''Handi-Quacks'' due to Lois' newfound connections with Fox. Meg's reasonable, albeit banal, suggestions are ignored by Peter in favor of Chris' outlandish ideas, and Peter eventually fires her. He and Chris settle on developing the show's [[pilot episode]] around a joke involving a [[wood-burning stove|wood stove]] and a [[house of cards]], and invite [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]], [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] and [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] to voice the characters. Although it is suggested that the crudely-animated and written pilot will likely fail, [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Peter Chernin]] enjoys it and agrees to produce the show, but Peter is insulted when he suggests that the character Poopyface Tomato Nose's nose be a [[plum]] instead of a [[tomato]]. Peter's passion for ''Handi-Quacks'' impresses Chernin, who allows him to retain complete creative control over its production, but a still-aggrieved Peter rebuffs the deal entirely, which he quickly regrets.\n\nAt the end of the episode, Lois is revealed to no longer work as a reporter; she does not bother to reveal how or why due to a [[Reset button technique|perceived lack of interest from the audience]].\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Seth Rogen by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|170px|Actor [[Seth Rogen]] guest starred in the episode.]]\n\n\"Fox-y Lady\" is the tenth episode of ''Family Guy''{{'}}s seventh season.

The applications typically use [[HTML]], [[CSS]] and [[JavaScript]] in the client, [[PHP]], [[ASP.NET]] ([[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]) or [[Java (programming language)|Java]] in the server, and [[http]] for communications between client and server. A [[web content management system]] is often used to develop and maintain web applications.\n\n== Nature of employment ==\n\nWeb developers are found working in various types of organizations, including large [[corporations]] and [[governments]], small and medium-sized [[companies]], or alone as [[freelancers]]. Some web developers work for one organization as a permanent [[Full-time job|full-time]] employee, while others may work as independent [[consultants]], or as contractors for an agency or at home personal use. Web developers typically handle both [[server-side]] and [[Front end development|front-end]] logic. This usually involves implementing all the visual elements that users see and use in the web applications or use, as well as all the web services that are necessary to power the usage of their developing work. Salaries vary depending on the type of development work, location, and level of seniority.\n\n== Type of work performed ==\n\nModern [[web application]]s often contain three or more [[multitier architecture|tier]]s, and depending on the size of the team a developer works on, he or she may specialize in one or more of these tiers - or may take a more [[interdisciplinary]] role. A web developer is usually classified as a [[Front-end web development]] or a Back-End Web Developer. For example, in a two-person team, one developer may focus on the technologies sent to the [[Client-side|client]] such as [[HTML]], [[JavaScript]], [[CSS]],  [[React (JavaScript library)|ReactJs]] or [[AngularJS]] and on the [[server-side]] frameworks (such as [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[PHP]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Active Server Pages|ASP]], [[ASP.NET]], [[Node.js]]) used to deliver content and scripts to the client. Meanwhile, the other developer might focus on the interaction between server-side frameworks, the [[webserver]], and a [[database]] system. Further, depending on the size of their organization, the aforementioned developers might work closely with a content creator/copywriter, marketing adviser, [[user experience design]]er, [[web designer]], [[web producer]], [[project manager]], [[software architect]], or [[database administrator]] - or they may be responsible for such tasks as [[web design]] and [[project management]] themselves.\n\n== Educational and licensure requirements ==\n\nThere are no formal educational or licensure requirements to become a web developer. However, many colleges and trade schools offer coursework in web development. There are also many tutorials and articles, which teach web development, freely available on the web - for example [[wikiversity: Basic JavaScript|Basic JavaScript]]\n\nEven though there are no formal educational requirements, dealing with web developing projects requires those who wish to be referred to as web developers to have advanced knowledge/skills in:\n* HTML/XHTML, [[Cascading_Style_Sheets|CSS]], JavaScript and jQuery.\n* [[server-side|Server]]/[[client-side|client]] side architecture like all or some of the above mentioned.  \n* Programming/Coding/Scripting in one of the many server-side languages or frameworks (e.g., [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], [[PHP]], [[Go (programming language)|Go]], [[ColdFusion Markup Language|CFML - ColdFusion]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Active Server Pages|ASP]], [[ASP.NET]], [[Node.js]])\n* Ability to utilize a [[database]]\n* Creating [[single page application]] with use of front-end tools such as EmberJS,<ref>{{cite web | url=https://emberjs.com | title=EmberJS website | work=EmberJS }}</ref> ReactJS<ref>{{cite web | url=https://facebook.github.io/react/ | title=ReactJS website | work=ReactJS }}</ref> or AngularJS<ref>{{cite web | url=https://angularjs.org/ | title=AngularJS website | work=AngularJS }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Outline of web design and web development]]\n* [[Website design]]\n* [[Web development]]\n* [[Web engineering]]\n* [[Software developer]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{American Web Design and Development Company/|[https://www.webmarkinc.com/web-designing-company-usa/ Web Designing Company USA]}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiversity|Web design}}\n* The US Department of Labor's description of [http://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/web-developers.htm/ Web Developers]\n* [https://www.w3.org/ / World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)]\n\n[[Category:Web development]]\n[[Category:Computer occupations]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the Mozilla extension|Web Developer (software)}}\n{{Refimprove|date=May 2013}}\n\nA '''web developer''' is a [[programmer]] who specializes in, or is specifically engaged in, the development of [[World Wide Web]] applications using a [[client\u2013server model]].

Now Principal Wally gives Cleveland one week to raise money to re-build the stadium before the season begins.

After the two go to the mall and beat up a swarm of old ladies (based on the real-life [[Red Hat Society]]), they visit the high school only to find out that there is no longer a team because Principal Wally disbanded the team. Principal Wally gives Cleveland a week to raise enough money to re-build the stadium before the baseball season begins.\n\nCleveland holds a bake sale, but does not come anywhere near the $5,000 needed. Terry shows up with a check for $120,000 that Mr. Waterman gave him (after Terry had to reach into his pocket to get it). Cleveland becomes the head coach and begins recruiting players. He tries to get [[Cleveland Brown Jr|Cleveland Jr.]] to join the team, but he states he wishes to join the Math Club instead. Cleveland runs into his old coach, Coach McFall\u2014an alcoholic has-been who has lost part of his jaw to [[oral cancer]] after years of chewing tobacco\u2014who gives him advice on how to get Jr. to join the team. Taking his advice, Cleveland decides to let Jr. wear his retired jersey in order to continue his legacy. Honored, Cleveland Jr. accepts and joins the team. During his first game, Cleveland Jr. is so obese that no one can pitch the ball down the middle and he is allowed to walk. However, he notices a ladybug on first base and tackles his teammate so he does not accidentally step on it and both of them are tapped out. Jr. goes on to become the team's worst player and Cleveland becomes ashamed of him.\n\nCleveland and Terry break into the school and steal his jersey back from Cleveland Jr. Principal Wally gives Cleveland Jr. a security tape and he finds out that Cleveland took his jersey back. Feeling ashamed, Cleveland apologizes and gives the jersey back. Heartbroken, Cleveland Jr. joins the Math Club and gives Principal Wally the jersey as he does not care anymore. As the baseball team is playing a game, Principal Wally brings Cleveland Jr. to the game. As Jr. wonders why they are there, Cleveland spots them and tries to make peace with his son again. Principal Wally then proceeds to douse Cleveland's jersey in gasoline and prepares to light it on fire as revenge for making him urinate in his pants during high school. Seeing the pain in his father's eyes in this, Cleveland Jr. tackles Principal Wally and returns the jersey to his father. Cleveland thanks him and they hug and make up. Cleveland then decides to teach Principal Wally a lesson for almost torching his jersey, as well as for calling Cleveland Jr. a \"chubby loser\" (to the shock of everyone attending the game), and proceeds to chase him around the field. However, after Cleveland corners Principal Wally, he once again urinates his pants, to Cleveland's delight.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z4&mo=12&d=30|title=FOX FLASH - FOX PRIMETIME - SCHEDULE|publisher=Fox Flash|accessdate=15 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106011811/http://www.foxflash.com/div.php/main/page?aID=1z4&mo=12&d=30|archive-date=6 January 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe episode was viewed by 6.96 million people and a rating 3.3/8 coming in third on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s Animation Domination and its timeslot.<ref>http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/01/04/tv-ratings-sunday-night-football-finishes-on-top-as-simpsons-housewives-return-up/37466</ref> ''[[The A.V.

It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on October 4, 2009. In the episode, [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] discovers that her mother is [[Judaism|Jewish]] and begins her struggle to adapt to her newfound heritage. Meanwhile, [[Irish Catholic]] [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] begins to embrace his wife's new religion, but after a spiritual visit from his deceased stepfather, [[List of Family Guy characters#Peter's family|Francis]], he becomes increasingly [[anti-semitic]] towards Lois and the family.\n\nFirst announced at the 2009 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], the episode was written by [[Mark Hentemann]] and directed by [[James Purdum]]. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and cultural references, in addition to receiving [[Criticism of Family Guy|criticism]] from the [[Parents Television Council]]. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 9.66 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by [[Jeff Bergman]], [[Max Burkholder]], [[Charles Durning]], [[Ben Stein]] and [[Bill Woodson]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \"Family Goy\" was released on [[DVD]] along with seven other episodes from the season on June 15, 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile at the Drunken Clam, Peter falls in love with a cardboard cutout of [[Kathy Ireland]]. He takes her home and has an 'affair' with her. Soon he is caught by Lois who calls him an idiot. Peter introduces Kathy to the kids as their new mom, but after finding that Chris took her into his room, he angrily confronts her and ends up ripping her in half. He tearfully buries her in the yard and begs Lois for forgiveness. Lois forgives him and they have [[sexual intercourse|sex]] and Lois is shocked when [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] discovers a [[wiktionary:lump|lump]] on her [[breast]], causing her to go to the hospital the next day to have it tested for [[breast cancer]]. The test comes back negative, but while looking through her medical records, Dr Hartman discovers that Lois' mother is a [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivor, making Lois and her children Jewish by heritage. [[Barbara Pewterschmidt|Barbara]] confirms her heritage, and [[Carter Pewterschmidt|Carter]] admits he kept it a family secret so that they could join the [[country club]]. Despite not being Jewish himself, Peter takes to it eagerly, much to Lois' frustration. That night, Peter is visited by the ghost of his adoptive father, [[Francis Griffin (Family Guy)|Francis]], who warns him that he will go to [[Hell]] for not being [[Catholicism|Catholic]]. The next day, Peter decides to re-convert the family to Catholicism and becomes prejudiced against Lois' heritage, becoming anti-Semitic.\n\nTaking advice from her mother not to let Peter suppress her identity, like her own husband did to her, Lois decides to hold a [[Passover Seder]], which Peter tries to ruin so he can celebrate [[Easter]]. He shows up in an [[Easter bunny]] costume while [[Alcohol intoxication|drunk]]. [[Jesus]] appears, revealing he himself is Jewish, and points out that [[Catholicism]] and [[Judaism]] are very similar. He then tells Peter that he should treat people of different faiths as fairly as he wants to be treated. Peter and Lois apologize to each other, but are at a loss for what religion they should follow. After being asked this by Peter, Jesus answers \"Six of one, they're all complete crap\", and then Brian, himself an [[atheist]], (offscreen) chimes in from the other side of the room, responding \"Thank you!\"\n\n==Production and development==\n[[File:Mark Hentemann by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Mark Hentemann wrote the episode.]]\nFirst announced at the 2009 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]] on July 25, 2009, by future showrunner Mark Hentemann,<ref>{{cite news|title=MacFarlane revels in 'Family Guy' noms|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|author=Maxwell, Erin|date=July 25, 2009|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118006495.html?categoryid=14&cs=1|accessdate=October 31, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 25, 2009|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2009/07/the-emmynominated-family-guy-and-the-abortion-episode-you-wont-see.html|author=Phillips, Jevon|title=The Emmy-nominated 'Family Guy' and the abortion episode you will not see|accessdate=October 31, 2009}}</ref> the episode was directed by supervising director [[James Purdum]], written by Hentemann, shortly after the conclusion of the [[Family Guy (season 7)|seventh production season]].\n\n\"Family Goy\", along with the seven other episodes from ''Family Guy''{{'}}s eighth season, were released on a three-disc [[DVD]] set in the United States on June 15, 2010.

At her cancer support group, she was exposed to promotions for a range of alternative treatments, many of which urged her to reject conventional medicine and not to have surgery or chemotherapy.  However, her research revealed that there was a lack of evidence to support the effectiveness of those alternative treatments.

In the media, she has presented expos\u00e9s of unproven treatments, some of which have resulted in successful legal prosecutions.

Her family moved to the United Kingdom in 1954, and then to [[South Australia]] in 1959.

At her cancer support group, she was exposed to promotions for a range of alternative treatments, many of which urged her to reject conventional medicine and not to have surgery or chemotherapy.  However, her research revealed that there was a lack of evidence to support the effectiveness of those alternative treatments. Marron said she became horrified to see how charlatans were attempting to take advantage of her and fellow sufferers, offering treatments with no verifiable benefits, often while charging large fees, and this drove her to expose the worst practices of people who promote unproven, \"alternative\" approaches.<ref name=Corderoy_20130309>{{cite news|last1=Corderoy|first1=Amy|title=Having a bone to pick with natural medicine|work=[[The Age]] (Melbourne)|date=9 March 2013|page=19|publisher=John Fairfax Publications|ISSN=0312-6307}}</ref>\n\n\"It's understandable that people reach out for alternatives when they are ill.

It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on March 8, 2009. In the episode, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] becomes temporarily gay after participating in a [[Human subject research|medical drug test]].\n\nThe episode was written by [[Richard Appel]] and directed by series regular Brian Iles. [[Seth Rogen]] provided a guest-voice as Peter under the effects of the \"Seth Rogen gene\" and [[Meredith Baxter]] provided a guest voice as herself. It received divided reviews from television sources and critics, in addition to receiving [[Criticism of Family Guy|criticism]] from the [[Parents Television Council]]. \"Family Gay\", along with two other episodes, was nominated in the \"[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]]\" category for the 2009 [[61st Primetime Emmy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile on his way to buy groceries, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] instead buys a brain-damaged horse, which not only disturbs everyone but also causes $100,000 worth of damage when Peter enters it in a race and it goes on a rampage. Though the horse ends up dying of a fatal heart attack and Peter disposes of the body by flinging it into [[Mort Goldman|Mort Goldman's]], the Griffins are in debt for initial damages. In order to pay for the damage, Peter decides to participate in a series of [[Human subject research|medical drug testing]] including one that makes him gay.\n\nLois is initially upset that Peter is now gay, but she warms up to the change when he begins exhibiting stereotypical gay behaviors like shopping for clothes and cooking muffins, only to reconsider her stance when Peter rejects her sexual advances. Upon learning that the effects of the gay gene may be permanent, she decides to make the best of things when Peter suddenly leaves her for a gay man named Scott. Seeing Lois heartbroken and depressed, [[Stewie Griffin]] and [[Brian Griffin]] (who is hesitant due to his support of gay rights) attempt to bring Peter back to his normal self by kidnapping him and sending him to a straight camp for [[conversion therapy]].\n\nWhen Scott comes over looking for Peter, Brian admits his actions. Lois states that she is willing to accept Peter the way he is now and takes him out of the straight camp, telling him to go back to Scott. However, the effects of the experimental gay gene are revealed to be temporary and the effects wear off right when Peter is in the middle of a gay orgy with Scott and nine other men. Peter returns to Lois, and they decide to never speak of the incident again. The episode ends when Mort throws the horse in the window yelling, \"Take back your fucking horse!\"\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Richard Appel by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|240px|alt=A Caucasian male wearing dark glasses, brown hair, and a brown beard.

It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on March 8, 2009. In the episode, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] becomes temporarily gay after participating in a [[Human subject research|medical drug test]].\n\nThe episode was written by [[Richard Appel]] and directed by series regular Brian Iles. [[Seth Rogen]] provided a guest-voice as Peter under the effects of the \"Seth Rogen gene\" and [[Meredith Baxter]] provided a guest voice as herself. It received divided reviews from television sources and critics, in addition to receiving [[Criticism of Family Guy|criticism]] from the [[Parents Television Council]]. \"Family Gay\", along with two other episodes, was nominated in the \"[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]]\" category for the 2009 [[61st Primetime Emmy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\nWhile on his way to buy groceries, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] instead buys a brain-damaged horse, which not only disturbs everyone but also causes $100,000 worth of damage when Peter enters it in a race and it goes on a rampage. Though the horse ends up dying of a fatal heart attack and Peter disposes of the body by flinging it into [[Mort Goldman|Mort Goldman's]], the Griffins are in debt for initial damages. In order to pay for the damage, Peter decides to participate in a series of [[Human subject research|medical drug testing]] including one that makes him gay.\n\nLois is initially upset that Peter is now gay, but she warms up to the change when he begins exhibiting stereotypical gay behaviors like shopping for clothes and cooking muffins, only to reconsider her stance when Peter rejects her sexual advances. Upon learning that the effects of the gay gene may be permanent, she decides to make the best of things when Peter suddenly leaves her for a gay man named Scott. Seeing Lois heartbroken and depressed, [[Stewie Griffin]] and [[Brian Griffin]] (who is hesitant due to his support of gay rights) attempt to bring Peter back to his normal self by kidnapping him and sending him to a straight camp for [[conversion therapy]].\n\nWhen Scott comes over looking for Peter, Brian admits his actions. Lois states that she is willing to accept Peter the way he is now and takes him out of the straight camp, telling him to go back to Scott. However, the effects of the experimental gay gene are revealed to be temporary and the effects wear off right when Peter is in the middle of a gay orgy with Scott and nine other men. Peter returns to Lois, and they decide to never speak of the incident again. The episode ends when Mort throws the horse in the window yelling, \"Take back your fucking horse!\"\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Richard Appel by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|240px|alt=A Caucasian male wearing dark glasses, brown hair, and a brown beard.

Directed by [[John Holmquist]] and written by [[Steve Callaghan]], the episode originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on February 14, 2010. In \"Extra Large Medium\", the show's main character, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], discovers that he has supposedly developed \"[[extrasensory perception]]\" (ESP) after his two sons, [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], go missing during a family hike in the woods. Soon after being rescued, Chris decides to ask out a classmate at his school, named Ellen, who has [[Down syndrome]], and eventually takes her on a romantic date, which he goes on to regret. Meanwhile, Peter begins performing [[psychic readings]], but is eventually discovered to be faking his ability once he is approached by the town's police force.\n\nThe episode generated significant controversy. Former [[Governor of Alaska]] and 2008 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Vice President of the United States|vice-presidential]] nominee [[Sarah Palin]], who is referenced briefly in the episode as being the mother of Ellen, took offense to the episode's portrayal of Down syndrome, due to her son's diagnosis of the disorder. [[Andrea Fay Friedman]], who was also diagnosed with Down syndrome and portrayed the character of Ellen, publicly refuted Palin, instead supporting executive producer and series creator [[Seth MacFarlane]], who defended the episode, and was also supported by [[Bill Maher]], the host of ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher|Real Time]].'' The episode got more [[Criticism of Family Guy|criticism]] from the [[Parents Television Council]] during its original broadcast.<ref>{{cite web |title= Family Guy on Fox |url= http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/bw/2010/0226worst.asp |work= Worst TV Show of the Week |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate= 2010-02-26}}</ref>\n\nDespite the controversy, critical responses to the episode were mostly positive; critics praised its storyline, numerous cultural references, and its portrayal of a person with Down syndrome. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 6.42 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Jennifer Birmingham, [[Jackson Douglas]], Andrea Fay Friedman, [[Phil LaMarr]], [[Michele Lee]] and [[Nana Visitor]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. It was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics, for the episode's song entitled \"Down Syndrome Girl\", at the [[62nd Primetime Emmy Awards]]. Both [[Walter Murphy]] and MacFarlane were recognized for their work on the music and lyrics. \"Extra Large Medium\" was released on [[DVD]], along with 11 other episodes from the season, on December 13, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen the [[Griffin family]] decide to go for a hike in the local woods, [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] get lost while chasing after a floating butterfly. As a result, they go missing for several days, with only limited supplies. As [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] is at her wits' end, she decides to see a [[psychic medium]] who assures her of the children's safety and well being. Eventually the boys are found and rescued by Bruce, and returned to their home in Quahog which only furthers Lois' psychic obsession to the annoyance of a skeptical [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]. In defiance of Lois' assertion that extrasensory perception exists, Brian has [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] perform a [[cold reading]] on a passerby in the park in order to demonstrate that psychic readings are purely an act, and not real. However, Peter is struck by his success as a medium, convincing himself that he actually has extrasensory perception, and decides to capitalize on it by opening his own [[psychic reading]]s business and [[John Edward|performing in front of a live audience]]. Soon after, Peter's bluff is finally called when [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] requests his help in a frantic search for a missing person who has been strapped to a bomb. Peter stalls for time during the search (as he just wants to feel the victim's daughter's breasts), eventually resulting in a gruesome death when the bomb explodes, prompting Peter to flatly admit that he actually has no psychic powers whatsoever.\n\nMeanwhile, during the time when Chris and Stewie were lost in the woods, Chris promises to ask out Ellen, a classmate of his who has [[Down syndrome]]. After their rescue, Stewie helps prepare Chris for a date by dressing him up, and instructing him on how to act through a prolonged musical number.

Directed by [[John Holmquist]] and written by [[Steve Callaghan]], the episode originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on February 14, 2010. In \"Extra Large Medium\", the show's main character, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], discovers that he has supposedly developed \"[[extrasensory perception]]\" (ESP) after his two sons, [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], go missing during a family hike in the woods. Soon after being rescued, Chris decides to ask out a classmate at his school, named Ellen, who has [[Down syndrome]], and eventually takes her on a romantic date, which he goes on to regret. Meanwhile, Peter begins performing [[psychic readings]], but is eventually discovered to be faking his ability once he is approached by the town's police force.\n\nThe episode generated significant controversy. Former [[Governor of Alaska]] and 2008 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Vice President of the United States|vice-presidential]] nominee [[Sarah Palin]], who is referenced briefly in the episode as being the mother of Ellen, took offense to the episode's portrayal of Down syndrome, due to her son's diagnosis of the disorder. [[Andrea Fay Friedman]], who was also diagnosed with Down syndrome and portrayed the character of Ellen, publicly refuted Palin, instead supporting executive producer and series creator [[Seth MacFarlane]], who defended the episode, and was also supported by [[Bill Maher]], the host of ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher|Real Time]].'' The episode got more [[Criticism of Family Guy|criticism]] from the [[Parents Television Council]] during its original broadcast.<ref>{{cite web |title= Family Guy on Fox |url= http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/bw/2010/0226worst.asp |work= Worst TV Show of the Week |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate= 2010-02-26}}</ref>\n\nDespite the controversy, critical responses to the episode were mostly positive; critics praised its storyline, numerous cultural references, and its portrayal of a person with Down syndrome. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 6.42 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Jennifer Birmingham, [[Jackson Douglas]], Andrea Fay Friedman, [[Phil LaMarr]], [[Michele Lee]] and [[Nana Visitor]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. It was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics, for the episode's song entitled \"Down Syndrome Girl\", at the [[62nd Primetime Emmy Awards]]. Both [[Walter Murphy]] and MacFarlane were recognized for their work on the music and lyrics. \"Extra Large Medium\" was released on [[DVD]], along with 11 other episodes from the season, on December 13, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nWhen the [[Griffin family]] decide to go for a hike in the local woods, [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] get lost while chasing after a floating butterfly. As a result, they go missing for several days, with only limited supplies. As [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] is at her wits' end, she decides to see a [[psychic medium]] who assures her of the children's safety and well being. Eventually the boys are found and rescued by Bruce, and returned to their home in Quahog which only furthers Lois' psychic obsession to the annoyance of a skeptical [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]. In defiance of Lois' assertion that extrasensory perception exists, Brian has [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] perform a [[cold reading]] on a passerby in the park in order to demonstrate that psychic readings are purely an act, and not real. However, Peter is struck by his success as a medium, convincing himself that he actually has extrasensory perception, and decides to capitalize on it by opening his own [[psychic reading]]s business and [[John Edward|performing in front of a live audience]]. Soon after, Peter's bluff is finally called when [[Joe Swanson|Joe]] requests his help in a frantic search for a missing person who has been strapped to a bomb. Peter stalls for time during the search (as he just wants to feel the victim's daughter's breasts), eventually resulting in a gruesome death when the bomb explodes, prompting Peter to flatly admit that he actually has no psychic powers whatsoever.\n\nMeanwhile, during the time when Chris and Stewie were lost in the woods, Chris promises to ask out Ellen, a classmate of his who has [[Down syndrome]]. After their rescue, Stewie helps prepare Chris for a date by dressing him up, and instructing him on how to act through a prolonged musical number. During the date, however, Ellen turns out to be pushy and demanding, and the relationship quickly goes wrong. Chris admits that he had bought into a [[Stereotyping|stereotype]] of people with Down syndrome being different, and she breaks up with him. Stewie consoles Chris by congratulating him for demonstrating courage, in asking her out on a date, as he had promised to do.\n\n==Production and development==\n[[File:Steve Callaghan by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|175px|alt=A man with brown hair, leans forward slightly to speak into a microphone.|[[Steve Callaghan]] wrote the episode.]]\nThe episode was directed by series regular [[John Holmquist]], and written by series show runner [[Steve Callaghan]] before the conclusion of the [[Family Guy (season 8)|eighth production season]].
