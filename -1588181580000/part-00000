In the south, Blacks were harshly treated, and were not expected to be anything other than a slave. This theory created by society allowed for Blacks to move full force into the movement.

There was no government assistance, but often northern industries, such as the [[railroad]]s, meatpacking, and stockyards, sometimes paid for transportation and relocation.\n\nBetween 1910 and 1930, the African-American population increased by about forty percent in Northern states as a result of the migration, mostly in the major cities. The cities of [[Philadelphia]], [[Detroit]], [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland]], [[History of the African Americans in Baltimore|Baltimore]], and [[New York City]] had some of the biggest increases in the early part of the twentieth century. Tens of thousands of blacks were recruited for industrial jobs, such as positions related to the expansion of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. Because changes were concentrated in cities, which had also attracted millions of new or recent European immigrants, tensions rose as the people competed for jobs and scarce housing. Tensions were often most severe between ethnic Irish, defending their recently gained positions and territory, and recent immigrants and blacks.\n\n=== Tensions and violence ===\nIn the late summer and autumn of 1919, racial tensions became violent and came to be known as the [[Red Summer]]. This period of time was defined by violence and prolonged rioting between blacks and whites in major United States cities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Broussard|first=Albert S.|date=Spring 2011|title=New Perspectives on Lynching, Race Riots, and Mob Violence|url=|journal=Journal of American Ethnic History|volume=30|issue=3|pages=71\u201375|via=EBSCO|doi=10.5406/jamerethnhist.30.3.0071}}</ref> The reasons for this violence vary.

Principally, many blacks were assuming the jobs of white men who went to go fight in World War I. As the war ended in 1918, many men returned home to find out their jobs had been taken by black men who were willing to work for far less.<ref name=\":02\" /> By the time the rioting and violence had subsided in Chicago, 38 people had lost their lives, with 500 more injured.

Black migration picked up from the start of the new century, with 204,000 leaving in the first decade. The pace accelerated with the outbreak of [[World War I]] and continued through the 1920s. By 1930, there were 1.3 million former southerners living in other regions.<ref name=\"JamesGregory\">Gregory, James N. (2009) \"The Second Great Migration: An Historical Overview,\" ''African American Urban History: The Dynamics of Race, Class and Gender since World War II'', eds. Joe W. Trotter Jr. and Kenneth L. Kusmer. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 22.</ref>\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] wiped out job opportunities in the northern industrial belt, especially for African Americans, and caused a sharp reduction in migration. In the 1930s and 1940s, increasing mechanization of agriculture virtually brought the institution of [[sharecropping]] that had existed since the Civil War to an end in the United States causing many landless black farmers to be forced off of the land.<ref>Gordon Marshall, \"[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-sharecro.html Sharecropping],\" ''Encyclopedia.com'', 1998.</ref>\n\nAs a result, approximately 1.4 million black southerners moved north or west in the 1940s, followed by 1.1 million in the 1950s, and another 2.4 million people in the 1960s and early 1970s. By the late 1970s, as deindustrialization and the Rust Belt crisis took hold, the Great Migration came to an end. But, in a reflection of changing economics, as well as the end of [[Jim Crow laws]] in the 1960s and improving race relations in the South, in the 1980s and early 1990s, more black Americans were heading South than leaving that region.<ref name=\"Gregory, James N. 2005 pp. 12\">Gregory, James N.

The other four states showed net increases in their African American populations in 1950 compared to 1920, with the percentage decreasing due to the white population increasing more.<ref name=\"JamesGregory\" /> Big cities were the principal destinations of southerners throughout the two phases of the Great Migration. In the first phase, eight major cities attracted two-thirds of the migrants: [[New York City|New York]] and [[Chicago]], followed in order by [[Philadelphia]], [[St. Louis]], [[Denver]], [[Detroit]], [[Pittsburgh]], and [[Indianapolis]]. The Second great black migration increased the populations of these cities while adding others as destinations, including the [[Western United States|Western states]]. Western cities such as [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Oakland]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Seattle]], and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] attracted African Americans in large numbers.<ref name=\"JamesGregory\" />\n\nThere were clear migratory patterns that linked particular states and cities in the South to corresponding destinations in the North and West. Almost half of those who migrated from Mississippi during the first Great Migration, for example, ended up in [[Chicago]], while those from Virginia tended to move to [[Philadelphia]]. For the most part, these patterns were related to geography, with the closest cities attracting the most migrants (such as Los Angeles and San Francisco receiving a disproportionate number of migrants from Texas and Louisiana). When multiple destinations were equidistant, [[chain migration]] played a larger role, with migrants following the path set by those before them.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = The Great Migration: The African American Exodus from The South|first=Dan |last=Kopf|url = http://priceonomics.com/the-great-migration-the-african-american-exodus/|website = Priceonomics|date=January 28, 2016|access-date = 2016-02-02|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Gallery===\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Percentage of African American population living in the American South.png|400px|Graph showing the percentage of the African-American population living in the American South, 1790\u20132010\nFile:GreatMigration1910to1970-UrbanPopulation.png|400px|The Great Migration shown by changes in the African-American share of populations of major U.S. cities, 1910\u201340 and 1940\u201370\nFile:Linchamientos.png|400px|Racially motivated murders per decade from 1865 to 1965.\n</gallery>\n\n== Cultural changes ==\nAfter moving from the racist pressures of the south to the northern states, [[African Americans]] were inspired to different kinds of creativity.

Many [[blues]] singers migrated from the [[Mississippi Delta]] to Chicago to escape racial discrimination. [[Muddy Waters]], [[Chester Burnett]], and [[Buddy Guy]] are among the most well-known blues artists who migrated to Chicago. Great Delta-born pianist [[Eddie Boyd]] told ''[[Living Blues]]'' magazine, \"I thought of coming to Chicago where I could get away from some of that racism and where I would have an opportunity to, well, do something with my talent....

In a number of states, there were decades of black population decline, especially across the Deep South \"black belt\" where cotton had been king. The migration changed the demographics of the South. In 1910, African Americans constituted the majority of the population of South Carolina and Mississippi, and more than 40 percent in Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and Texas; by 1970, only in Mississippi did the African-American population constitute more than 30 percent of the state's total. \"The disappearance of the 'black belt' was one of the striking effects\" of the Great Migration, James Gregory wrote.<ref name=\"Gregory18\">Gregory (2005), p. 18.</ref>\n\nIn Mississippi, blacks decreased from about 56% of the population in 1910 to about 37% by 1970,<ref name=PopRace>Gibson, Campbell and Kay Jung (September 2002).

In 1900, only 740,000 African Americans lived outside the South, just 8 percent of the nation's total black population. By 1970, more than 10.6 million African Americans lived outside the South, 47 percent of the nation's total.<ref name=\"Gregory18\" />\n\nBecause the migrants concentrated in the big cities of the north and west, their influence was magnified in those places. Cities that had been virtually all white at the start of the century became centers of black culture and politics by mid-century. Informal residential segregation and the tendency of people to settle with others of their home communities led to concentrations of blacks in certain areas. The northern \"Black metropolises\" developed an important infrastructure of newspapers, businesses, jazz clubs, churches, and political organizations that provided the staging ground for new forms of racial politics and new forms of black culture.\n\nAs a result of the Great Migration, the first large urban black communities developed in northern cities beyond New York, Boston, Baltimore, Washington D.C., and Philadelphia, which had black communities even before the Civil War, and attracted migrants after the war. It is conservatively estimated that 400,000 African Americans left the South in 1916 through 1918 to take advantage of a labor shortage in industrial cities during the First World War.<ref name=\"archives.gov\">[http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2015/onewayticket/site/assets/2014/10/03-1024x681.jpg James Gilbertlove, \"African Americans and the American Labor Movement\"], ''Prologue'', Summer 1997, Vol. 29.</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the African-American population of [[Detroit]] was 6,000.

People tended to take the cheapest rail ticket possible and go to areas where they had relatives and friends. For example, many people from [[Mississippi]] moved directly north by train to Chicago, from [[Alabama]] to Cleveland and Detroit, from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]] to [[New York City]], [[Baltimore]], [[Washington D.C.]] and [[Philadelphia]], and in the second migration, from Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Denver]], and [[Seattle]].\n\n=== Discrimination and working conditions ===\n[[File:Bronxhub1.jpeg|thumb|[[The Hub, Bronx|The Hub]] is the retail heart of the [[South Bronx]], New York City.<ref>[http://www.bronxhistoricalsociety.org/about/abrieflookatbronx.html A Brief Look at The Bronx], Bronx Historical Society.

Because so many people migrated in a short period of time, the African-American migrants were often resented by the urban white working class (often recent immigrants themselves); fearing their ability to negotiate rates of pay or secure employment, the ethnic whites felt threatened by the influx of new labor competition. Sometimes those who were most fearful or resentful were the last immigrants of the 19th and new immigrants of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nAfrican Americans made substantial gains in industrial employment, particularly in the steel, automobile, shipbuilding, and meatpacking industries. Between 1910 and 1920, the number of blacks employed in industry nearly doubled from 500,000 to 901,000.<ref name=\"archives.gov\" /> After the [[Great Depression]], more advances took place after workers in the steel and meatpacking industries organized into [[labor union]]s in the 1930s and 1940s, under the interracial [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO). The unions ended the segregation of many jobs, and African Americans began to advance into more skilled jobs and supervisory positions previously informally reserved for whites.\n\nBetween 1940 and 1960, the number of blacks in managerial and administrative occupations doubled, along with the number of blacks in white-collar occupations, while the number of black agricultural workers in 1960 fell to one-fourth of what it was in 1940.<ref>{{citation|last=Miller|first=Aurelia Toyer|title=The Social and Economic Status of the Black Population in the U.S.: An Historical View, 1790\u20131978|journal=[[The Review of Black Political Economy]]|volume=10|issue=3|year=1980|pages=314\u2013318|doi=10.1007/bf02689658}}</ref> Also, between 1936 and 1959, black income relative to white income more than doubled in various skilled trades.<ref>{{citation|last=Ashenfelter|first=Orley|author-link=Orley Ashenfelter|title=Changes in Labor Market Discrimination Over Time|journal=[[The Journal of Human Resources]]|volume=5|issue=4|pages=403\u2013430|year=1970|doi=10.2307/144999|jstor=144999}}</ref> Encountering very little [[employment discrimination]], blacks had higher [[Unemployment#Labor force participation rate|labor force participation rates]] than whites in every [[United States Census|U.S. Census]] from 1890 to 1950.<ref>{{citation|title=Historical Statistics of the United States: From Colonial Times to 1957|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], [[United States Government Publishing Office|U.S. Government Printing Office]]|url=https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/1208?start_page=83|year=1960|place=Washington, D.C.|page=72}}</ref> As a result of these advancements, the percentage of black families living below the poverty line declined from 87 percent in 1940 to 47 percent by 1960 and to 30 percent by 1970.<ref>{{citation|last1=Thernstrom|first1=Stephan|last2=Thernstrom|first2=Abigail|author-link1=Stephan Thernstrom|author-link2=Abigail Thernstrom|title=America in Black and White: One Nation, Indivisible|place=New York|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|year=1997|page=232}}</ref>\n\nPopulations increased so rapidly among both African-American migrants and new European immigrants that there were housing shortages in most major cities. With fewer resources, the newer groups were forced to compete for the oldest, most run-down housing. Ethnic groups created territories which they defended against change. Discrimination often restricted African Americans to crowded neighborhoods. The more established populations of cities tended to move to newer housing as it was developing in the outskirts. [[Mortgage discrimination]] and [[redlining]] in [[inner city]] areas limited the newer African-American migrants' ability to determine their own housing, or obtain a fair price. In the long term, the [[National Housing Act of 1934]] contributed to limiting the availability of loans to urban areas, particularly those areas inhabited by African Americans.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Kevin Fox |last=Gotham |title=Racialization and the State: The Housing Act of 1934 and the Creation of the Federal Housing Administration |journal=Sociological Perspectives |volume=43 |issue=2 |year=2000 |pages=291\u2013317 |jstor=1389798 |doi=10.2307/1389798 }}</ref>\n\nMigrants going to [[Albany, New York]] found poor living conditions and employment opportunities, but also higher wages and better schools and social services.

The black population in Pittsburgh jumped from 6,000 in 1880 to 27,000 in 1910.  Many took highly paid, skilled jobs in the steel mills. Pittsburgh's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled. They succeeded in building effective community responses that enabled the survival of new communities. <ref>Joe W.

They formed migration clubs, pooled their money, bought tickets at reduced rates, and often moved ingroups. Before they made the decision to move, they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process....In barbershops, poolrooms, and grocery stores, in churches, lodge halls, and clubhouses, and in private homes, southern blacks discussed, debated, and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North.<ref>Trotter, \"Reflections on the Great Migration to Western Pennsylvania,\" p 154.</ref>\n\n=== Integration and segregation ===\n[[File:We want white tenants.jpg|thumb|White tenants seeking to prevent blacks from moving into the [[Public housing in Detroit|Sojourner Truth]] housing project in [[Detroit]] erected this sign, 1942]]\nIn cities such as Newark, New York and Chicago, African Americans became increasingly integrated into society. As they lived and worked more closely with European Americans, the divide became increasingly indefinite. This period marked the transition for many African Americans from lifestyles as rural farmers to urban industrial workers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Black exodus : the great migration from the American South|date=1991|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|others=Harrison, Alferdteen.|isbn=9781604738216|location=Jackson|oclc=775352334}}</ref>\n\nThis migration gave birth to a cultural boom in cities such as Chicago and New York. In Chicago for instance, the neighborhood of Bronzeville became known as the \"Black Metropolis\". From 1924 to 1929, the \"Black Metropolis\" was at the peak of its golden years. Many of the community's entrepreneurs were black during this period. \"The foundation of the first African American YMCA took place in Bronzeville, and worked to help incoming migrants find jobs in the city of Chicago.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trcwabash.org/history.html|title=History|website=The Renaissance Collaborative}}</ref> The \"Black Belt\" geographical and racial isolation of this community, bordered to the north and east by whites, and to the south and west by industrial sites and ethnic immigrant neighborhoods, made it a site for the study of the development of an urban black community. For urbanized people, eating proper foods in a sanitary, civilized setting such as the home or a restaurant was a social ritual that indicated one's level of respectability. The people native to Chicago had pride in the high level of integration in Chicago restaurants, which they attributed to their unassailable manners and refined tastes.<ref>Poe, Tracy N. (1999). \"The Origins of Soul Food in Black Urban Identity: Chicago, 1915-1947,\" ''American Studies International.''

With the defense buildup for [[World War II]] and with the post-war economic prosperity, migration was revived, with larger numbers of blacks leaving the South through the 1960s. After the political and civil gains of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], in the 1970s migration began to increase again. It moved in a different direction, as blacks traveled to new regions of the South for economic opportunity.\n\n== White southern reaction ==\nThe beginning of the Great Migration exposed a paradox in race relations in the American South at that time. Although blacks were treated with extreme hostility and subjected to legal discrimination, the southern economy was deeply dependent on them as an abundant supply of cheap labor, and black workers were seen as the most critical factor in the economic development of the South. One South Carolina politician summed up the dilemma: \"Politically speaking, there are far too many negroes, but from an industrial standpoint there is room for many more.\"<ref name=Reich>Reich, Steven A.: ''The Great Black Migration: A Historical Encyclopedia of the American Mosaic''</ref>\n\nWhen the Great Migration started in the 1910s, white southern elites seemed to be unconcerned, and industrialists and cotton planters saw it as a positive, as it was siphoning off surplus industrial and agricultural labor. As the migration picked up, however, southern elites began to panic, fearing that a prolonged black exodus would bankrupt the South, and newspaper editorials warned of the danger. White employers eventually took notice and began expressing their fears. White southerners soon began trying to stem the flow in order to prevent the hemorrhaging of their labor supply, and some began attempting to address the poor living standards and racial oppression experienced by Southern blacks in order to induce them to stay.\n\nAs a result, southern employers increased their wages to match those on offer in the North, and some individual employers opposed the worst excesses of Jim Crow laws. When the measures failed to stem the tide, white southerners, in concert with federal officials who feared the rise of [[black nationalism]], co-operated in attempting to coerce blacks to stay in the South. The Southern Metal Trades Association urged decisive action to stop black migration, and some employers undertook serious efforts against it. The largest southern steel manufacturer refused to cash checks sent to finance black migration, efforts were made to restrict bus and train access for blacks, agents were stationed in northern cities to report on wage levels, unionization, and the rise of black nationalism, and newspapers were pressured to divert more coverage to negative aspects of black life in the North. A series of local and federal directives were put into place with the goal of restricting black mobility, including local vagrancy ordinances, \"work or fight\" laws demanding all males either be employed or serve in the army, and conscription orders. Intimidation and beatings were also used to terrorize blacks into staying.<ref name=Reich /><ref name=anderson>Anderson, Talmadge and Stewart, James Benjamin: ''Introduction to African American Studies: Transdisciplinary Approaches and Implications''</ref> These intimidation tactics were described by Secretary of Labor [[William Bauchop Wilson|William B. Wilson]] as interfering with \"the natural right of workers to move from place to place at their own discretion\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=White rage : the unspoken truth of our racial

southerners were less concerned, as mechanization of agriculture in the late 1930s had resulted in another labor surplus so southern planters put up less resistance.<ref name=Reich />\n\n== In popular

Dubbed the [[New Great Migration]], it has seen a gradual increase of African American migration to the South, generally to states and cities where economic opportunities are the best. The reasons include economic difficulties of cities in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] United States, growth of jobs in the \"[[New South]]\" and its lower [[cost of living]], family and [[kinship]] ties, and improved racial relations.<ref name=BlacksMovingSouth>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/08/opinion/sunday/racism-is-everywhere-so-why-not-move-south.html|title=Racism Is Everywhere, So Why Not Move South?|author=Reniqua Allen|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 8, 2017|accessdate=July 9, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Causes ==\nThe primary factors for migration among southern African Americans were segregation, an increase in the spread of racist ideology, widespread [[lynching]] (nearly 3,500 African Americans were lynched between 1882 and 1968<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingsstate.html |title=Lynchings: By State and Race, 1882\u20131968 |accessdate=2010-07-26 |quote=Statistics provided by the Archives at Tuskegee Institute. |publisher=University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629081241/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/shipp/lynchingsstate.html |archivedate=2010-06-29 }}</ref>), and lack of social and economic opportunities in the South. In the south, Blacks were harshly treated, and were not expected to be anything other than a slave. This theory created by society allowed for Blacks to move full force into the movement.  There were also factors that pulled migrants to the north, such as labor shortages in northern factories brought about by World War I, resulting in thousands of jobs in steel mills, railroads, meatpacking plants, and the automobile industry.<ref name=\"Pearson Education, Inc\">{{cite book|last1=Hine|first1=Darlene|last2=Hine|first2=William|last3=Harrold|first3=Stanley|title=African Americans: A Concise History|date=2012|publisher=Pearson Education, Inc.|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-205-80627-0|pages=[https://archive.org/details/africanamericans0000hine_i0f5/page/388 388\u2013389]|edition=4th|url=https://archive.org/details/africanamericans0000hine_i0f5/page/388}}</ref> The pull of jobs in the north was strengthened by the efforts of labor agents sent by northern businessmen to recruit southern workers.<ref name=\"Pearson Education, Inc\" /> Northern companies offered special incentives to encourage black workers to relocate, including free transportation and low-cost housing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Migration ==\n{{Nadir of American race relations|Reactions}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2014}}\n=== First migrations ===\nWhen the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was signed in 1863, less than eight percent of the African-American population lived in the Northeastern or Midwestern United States.<ref name=Migrations>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/african/afam008.html|title=Migrations \u2013 The African-American Mosaic Exhibition \u2013 Exhibitions (Library of Congress)|first=United States Bureau of the|last=Census|date=23 July 2010|website=www.loc.gov}}</ref> This began to change over the next decade; by 1880, a migration was underway to Kansas.

There was no government assistance, but often northern industries, such as the [[railroad]]s, meatpacking, and stockyards, sometimes paid for transportation and relocation.\n\nBetween 1910 and 1930, the African-American population increased by about forty percent in Northern states as a result of the migration, mostly in the major cities. The cities of [[Philadelphia]], [[Detroit]], [[Chicago]], [[Cleveland]], [[History of the African Americans in Baltimore|Baltimore]], and [[New York City]] had some of the biggest increases in the early part of the twentieth century. Tens of thousands of blacks were recruited for industrial jobs, such as positions related to the expansion of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. Because changes were concentrated in cities, which had also attracted millions of new or recent European immigrants, tensions rose as the people competed for jobs and scarce housing. Tensions were often most severe between ethnic Irish, defending their recently gained positions and territory, and recent immigrants and blacks.\n\n=== Tensions and violence ===\nIn the late summer and autumn of 1919, racial tensions became violent and came to be known as the [[Red Summer]]. This period of time was defined by violence and prolonged rioting between blacks and whites in major United States cities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Broussard|first=Albert S.|date=Spring 2011|title=New Perspectives on Lynching, Race Riots, and Mob Violence|url=|journal=Journal of American Ethnic History|volume=30|issue=3|pages=71\u201375|via=EBSCO|doi=10.5406/jamerethnhist.30.3.0071}}</ref> The reasons for this violence vary.

Principally, many blacks were assuming the jobs of white men who went to go fight in World War I. As the war ended in 1918, many men returned home to find out their jobs had been taken by black men who were willing to work for far less.<ref name=\":02\" /> By the time the rioting and violence had subsided in Chicago, 38 people had lost their lives, with 500 more injured. Additionally, $250,000 worth of property was destroyed, and over a thousand persons were left homeless.<ref name=\"Black Metropolis\">{{cite book |last1=Drake |first1=St. Claire |last2=Cayton |first2=Horace R. |title=Black Metropolis: A Study of Negro Life in a Northern Ciry |date=1945 |publisher=Harcourt, Brace and Company |location=USA |page=65}}</ref> In other cities across the nation many more had been affected by the violence of the [[Red Summer]]. The Red Summer enlightened many to the growing racial tension in America. The violence in these major cities prefaced the soon to follow [[Harlem Renaissance]], an African-American cultural revolution, in the 1920s.<ref name=\":1\" /> Racial violence appeared again in [[Airport Homes race riots|Chicago]] in the 1940s and in [[1943 Detroit race riot|Detroit]] as well as other cities in the Northeast as racial tensions over housing and employment discrimination grew.\n\n=== Continued migration ===\nJames Gregory calculates decade-by-decade migration volumes in his book, ''The Southern Diaspora.'' Black migration picked up from the start of the new century, with 204,000 leaving in the first decade. The pace accelerated with the outbreak of [[World War I]] and continued through the 1920s. By 1930, there were 1.3 million former southerners living in other regions.<ref name=\"JamesGregory\">Gregory, James N. (2009) \"The Second Great Migration: An Historical Overview,\" ''African American Urban History: The Dynamics of Race, Class and Gender since World War II'', eds. Joe W. Trotter Jr. and Kenneth L. Kusmer. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 22.</ref>\n\nThe [[Great Depression]] wiped out job opportunities in the northern industrial belt, especially for African Americans, and caused a sharp reduction in migration. In the 1930s and 1940s, increasing mechanization of agriculture virtually brought the institution of [[sharecropping]] that had existed since the Civil War to an end in the United States causing many landless black farmers to be forced off of the land.<ref>Gordon Marshall, \"[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-sharecro.html Sharecropping],\" ''Encyclopedia.com'', 1998.</ref>\n\nAs a result, approximately 1.4 million black southerners moved north or west in the 1940s, followed by 1.1 million in the 1950s, and another 2.4 million people in the 1960s and early 1970s. By the late 1970s, as deindustrialization and the Rust Belt crisis took hold, the Great Migration came to an end. But, in a reflection of changing economics, as well as the end of [[Jim Crow laws]] in the 1960s and improving race relations in the South, in the 1980s and early 1990s, more black Americans were heading South than leaving that region.<ref name=\"Gregory, James N. 2005 pp. 12\">Gregory, James N. (2005)''The Southern Diaspora: How the Great Migrations of Black and White Southerners Transformed America''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, pp. 12\u201317.</ref>\n\nAfrican Americans moved from the 14 states of the South, especially [[Alabama]], [[Mississippi]], [[Louisiana]], [[Texas]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Census figures show the following for these states:<ref name=\"Gregory, James N. 2005 pp. 12\" /> \n\n==Total statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! State\n!

The other four states showed net increases in their African American populations in 1950 compared to 1920, with the percentage decreasing due to the white population increasing more.<ref name=\"JamesGregory\" /> Big cities were the principal destinations of southerners throughout the two phases of the Great Migration. In the first phase, eight major cities attracted two-thirds of the migrants: [[New York City|New York]] and [[Chicago]], followed in order by [[Philadelphia]], [[St. Louis]], [[Denver]], [[Detroit]], [[Pittsburgh]], and [[Indianapolis]]. The Second great black migration increased the populations of these cities while adding others as destinations, including the [[Western United States|Western states]]. Western cities such as [[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]], [[Oakland]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Seattle]], and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] attracted African Americans in large numbers.<ref name=\"JamesGregory\" />\n\nThere were clear migratory patterns that linked particular states and cities in the South to corresponding destinations in the North and West. Almost half of those who migrated from Mississippi during the first Great Migration, for example, ended up in [[Chicago]], while those from Virginia tended to move to [[Philadelphia]]. For the most part, these patterns were related to geography, with the closest cities attracting the most migrants (such as Los Angeles and San Francisco receiving a disproportionate number of migrants from Texas and Louisiana). When multiple destinations were equidistant, [[chain migration]] played a larger role, with migrants following the path set by those before them.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = The Great Migration: The African American Exodus from The South|first=Dan |last=Kopf|url = http://priceonomics.com/the-great-migration-the-african-american-exodus/|website = Priceonomics|date=January 28, 2016|access-date = 2016-02-02|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Gallery===\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Percentage of African American population living in the American South.png|400px|Graph showing the percentage of the African-American population living in the American South, 1790\u20132010\nFile:GreatMigration1910to1970-UrbanPopulation.png|400px|The Great Migration shown by changes in the African-American share of populations of major U.S. cities, 1910\u201340 and 1940\u201370\nFile:Linchamientos.png|400px|Racially motivated murders per decade from 1865 to 1965.\n</gallery>\n\n== Cultural changes ==\nAfter moving from the racist pressures of the south to the northern states, [[African Americans]] were inspired to different kinds of creativity.

In a number of states, there were decades of black population decline, especially across the Deep South \"black belt\" where cotton had been king. The migration changed the demographics of the South. In 1910, African Americans constituted the majority of the population of South Carolina and Mississippi, and more than 40 percent in Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and Texas; by 1970, only in Mississippi did the African-American population constitute more than 30 percent of the state's total. \"The disappearance of the 'black belt' was one of the striking effects\" of the Great Migration, James Gregory wrote.<ref name=\"Gregory18\">Gregory (2005), p. 18.</ref>\n\nIn Mississippi, blacks decreased from about 56% of the population in 1910 to about 37% by 1970,<ref name=PopRace>Gibson, Campbell and Kay Jung (September 2002).

In 1900, only 740,000 African Americans lived outside the South, just 8 percent of the nation's total black population. By 1970, more than 10.6 million African Americans lived outside the South, 47 percent of the nation's total.<ref name=\"Gregory18\" />\n\nBecause the migrants concentrated in the big cities of the north and west, their influence was magnified in those places. Cities that had been virtually all white at the start of the century became centers of black culture and politics by mid-century. Informal residential segregation and the tendency of people to settle with others of their home communities led to concentrations of blacks in certain areas. The northern \"Black metropolises\" developed an important infrastructure of newspapers, businesses, jazz clubs, churches, and political organizations that provided the staging ground for new forms of racial politics and new forms of black culture.\n\nAs a result of the Great Migration, the first large urban black communities developed in northern cities beyond New York, Boston, Baltimore, Washington D.C., and Philadelphia, which had black communities even before the Civil War, and attracted migrants after the war. It is conservatively estimated that 400,000 African Americans left the South in 1916 through 1918 to take advantage of a labor shortage in industrial cities during the First World War.<ref name=\"archives.gov\">[http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2015/onewayticket/site/assets/2014/10/03-1024x681.jpg James Gilbertlove, \"African Americans and the American Labor Movement\"], ''Prologue'', Summer 1997, Vol. 29.</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the African-American population of [[Detroit]] was 6,000.

By the start of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] in 1929, the city's African-American population had increased to 120,000.\n\nIn 1900\u201301, Chicago had a total population of 1,754,473.<ref>Gibson, Campbell (June 1998).

By the 1920s, New York's [[Harlem]] became a center of black cultural life, influenced by the American migrants as well as new immigrants from the [[Caribbean]] area.\n\nSecond-tier industrial cities that were destinations for numerous black migrants were [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[Boston]], [[Milwaukee]], [[Minneapolis]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] and [[Indianapolis]], and smaller industrial cities such as [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]], [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]], [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], [[Muskegon, Michigan|Muskegon]], [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]],  [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], and [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. People tended to take the cheapest rail ticket possible and go to areas where they had relatives and friends. For example, many people from [[Mississippi]] moved directly north by train to Chicago, from [[Alabama]] to Cleveland and Detroit, from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]] to [[New York City]], [[Baltimore]], [[Washington D.C.]] and [[Philadelphia]], and in the second migration, from Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Denver]], and [[Seattle]].\n\n=== Discrimination and working conditions ===\n[[File:Bronxhub1.jpeg|thumb|[[The Hub, Bronx|The Hub]] is the retail heart of the [[South Bronx]], New York City.<ref>[http://www.bronxhistoricalsociety.org/about/abrieflookatbronx.html A Brief Look at The Bronx], Bronx Historical Society.

Because so many people migrated in a short period of time, the African-American migrants were often resented by the urban white working class (often recent immigrants themselves); fearing their ability to negotiate rates of pay or secure employment, the ethnic whites felt threatened by the influx of new labor competition. Sometimes those who were most fearful or resentful were the last immigrants of the 19th and new immigrants of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nAfrican Americans made substantial gains in industrial employment, particularly in the steel, automobile, shipbuilding, and meatpacking industries. Between 1910 and 1920, the number of blacks employed in industry nearly doubled from 500,000 to 901,000.<ref name=\"archives.gov\" /> After the [[Great Depression]], more advances took place after workers in the steel and meatpacking industries organized into [[labor union]]s in the 1930s and 1940s, under the interracial [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO). The unions ended the segregation of many jobs, and African Americans began to advance into more skilled jobs and supervisory positions previously informally reserved for whites.\n\nBetween 1940 and 1960, the number of blacks in managerial and administrative occupations doubled, along with the number of blacks in white-collar occupations, while the number of black agricultural workers in 1960 fell to one-fourth of what it was in 1940.<ref>{{citation|last=Miller|first=Aurelia Toyer|title=The Social and Economic Status of the Black Population in the U.S.: An Historical View, 1790\u20131978|journal=[[The Review of Black Political Economy]]|volume=10|issue=3|year=1980|pages=314\u2013318|doi=10.1007/bf02689658}}</ref> Also, between 1936 and 1959, black income relative to white income more than doubled in various skilled trades.<ref>{{citation|last=Ashenfelter|first=Orley|author-link=Orley Ashenfelter|title=Changes in Labor Market Discrimination Over Time|journal=[[The Journal of Human Resources]]|volume=5|issue=4|pages=403\u2013430|year=1970|doi=10.2307/144999|jstor=144999}}</ref> Encountering very little [[employment discrimination]], blacks had higher [[Unemployment#Labor force participation rate|labor force participation rates]] than whites in every [[United States Census|U.S. Census]] from 1890 to 1950.<ref>{{citation|title=Historical Statistics of the United States: From Colonial Times to 1957|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], [[United States Government Publishing Office|U.S. Government Printing Office]]|url=https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/title/1208?start_page=83|year=1960|place=Washington, D.C.|page=72}}</ref> As a result of these advancements, the percentage of black families living below the poverty line declined from 87 percent in 1940 to 47 percent by 1960 and to 30 percent by 1970.<ref>{{citation|last1=Thernstrom|first1=Stephan|last2=Thernstrom|first2=Abigail|author-link1=Stephan Thernstrom|author-link2=Abigail Thernstrom|title=America in Black and White: One Nation, Indivisible|place=New York|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|year=1997|page=232}}</ref>\n\nPopulations increased so rapidly among both African-American migrants and new European immigrants that there were housing shortages in most major cities. With fewer resources, the newer groups were forced to compete for the oldest, most run-down housing. Ethnic groups created territories which they defended against change. Discrimination often restricted African Americans to crowded neighborhoods. The more established populations of cities tended to move to newer housing as it was developing in the outskirts. [[Mortgage discrimination]] and [[redlining]] in [[inner city]] areas limited the newer African-American migrants' ability to determine their own housing, or obtain a fair price. In the long term, the [[National Housing Act of 1934]] contributed to limiting the availability of loans to urban areas, particularly those areas inhabited by African Americans.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Kevin Fox |last=Gotham |title=Racialization and the State: The Housing Act of 1934 and the Creation of the Federal Housing Administration |journal=Sociological Perspectives |volume=43 |issue=2 |year=2000 |pages=291\u2013317 |jstor=1389798 |doi=10.2307/1389798 }}</ref>\n\nMigrants going to [[Albany, New York]] found poor living conditions and employment opportunities, but also higher wages and better schools and social services.

Pittsburgh's black population increased to 37,700 in 1920 (6.4% of the total) while the black element in Homestead, Rankin, Braddock, and others nearly doubled.

Before they made the decision to move, they gathered information and debated the pros and cons of the process....In barbershops, poolrooms, and grocery stores, in churches, lodge halls, and clubhouses, and in private homes, southern blacks discussed, debated, and decided what was good and what was bad about moving to the urban North.<ref>Trotter, \"Reflections on the Great Migration to Western Pennsylvania,\" p 154.</ref>\n\n=== Integration and segregation ===\n[[File:We want white tenants.jpg|thumb|White tenants seeking to prevent blacks from moving into the [[Public housing in Detroit|Sojourner Truth]] housing project in [[Detroit]] erected this sign, 1942]]\nIn cities such as Newark, New York and Chicago, African Americans became increasingly integrated into society.

In Chicago for instance, the neighborhood of Bronzeville became known as the \"Black Metropolis\". From 1924 to 1929, the \"Black Metropolis\" was at the peak of its golden years. Many of the community's entrepreneurs were black during this period. \"The foundation of the first African American YMCA took place in Bronzeville, and worked to help incoming migrants find jobs in the city of Chicago.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trcwabash.org/history.html|title=History|website=The Renaissance Collaborative}}</ref> The \"Black Belt\" geographical and racial isolation of this community, bordered to the north and east by whites, and to the south and west by industrial sites and ethnic immigrant neighborhoods, made it a site for the study of the development of an urban black community. For urbanized people, eating proper foods in a sanitary, civilized setting such as the home or a restaurant was a social ritual that indicated one's level of respectability. The people native to Chicago had pride in the high level of integration in Chicago restaurants, which they attributed to their unassailable manners and refined tastes.<ref>Poe, Tracy N.

With the defense buildup for [[World War II]] and with the post-war economic prosperity, migration was revived, with larger numbers of blacks leaving the South through the 1960s. After the political and civil gains of the [[Civil Rights Movement]], in the 1970s migration began to increase again. It moved in a different direction, as blacks traveled to new regions of the South for economic opportunity.\n\n== White southern reaction ==\nThe beginning of the Great Migration exposed a paradox in race relations in the American South at that time. Although blacks were treated with extreme hostility and subjected to legal discrimination, the southern economy was deeply dependent on them as an abundant supply of cheap labor, and black workers were seen as the most critical factor in the economic development of the South. One South Carolina politician summed up the dilemma: \"Politically speaking, there are far too many negroes, but from an industrial standpoint there is room for many more.\"<ref name=Reich>Reich, Steven A.: ''The Great Black Migration: A Historical Encyclopedia of the American Mosaic''</ref>\n\nWhen the Great Migration started in the 1910s, white southern elites seemed to be unconcerned, and industrialists and cotton planters saw it as a positive, as it was siphoning off surplus industrial and agricultural labor. As the migration picked up, however, southern elites began to panic, fearing that a prolonged black exodus would bankrupt the South, and newspaper editorials warned of the danger. White employers eventually took notice and began expressing their fears. White southerners soon began trying to stem the flow in order to prevent the hemorrhaging of their labor supply, and some began attempting to address the poor living standards and racial oppression experienced by Southern blacks in order to induce them to stay.\n\nAs a result, southern employers increased their wages to match those on offer in the North, and some individual employers opposed the worst excesses of Jim Crow laws. When the measures failed to stem the tide, white southerners, in concert with federal officials who feared the rise of [[black nationalism]], co-operated in attempting to coerce blacks to stay in the South. The Southern Metal Trades Association urged decisive action to stop black migration, and some employers undertook serious efforts against it. The largest southern steel manufacturer refused to cash checks sent to finance black migration, efforts were made to restrict bus and train access for blacks, agents were stationed in northern cities to report on wage levels, unionization, and the rise of black nationalism, and newspapers were pressured to divert more coverage to negative aspects of black life in the North. A series of local and federal directives were put into place with the goal of restricting black mobility, including local vagrancy ordinances, \"work or fight\" laws demanding all males either be employed or serve in the army, and conscription orders. Intimidation and beatings were also used to terrorize blacks into staying.<ref name=Reich /><ref name=anderson>Anderson, Talmadge and Stewart, James Benjamin: ''Introduction to African American Studies: Transdisciplinary Approaches and Implications''</ref> These intimidation tactics were described by Secretary of Labor [[William Bauchop Wilson|William B.

LAL reacts with bacterial [[lipopolysaccharide|endotoxin lipopolysaccharide]] (LPS), which is a [[cell membrane|membrane]] component of [[gram-negative bacteria]].

It was later recognized that the animal's blood cells, mobile cells called [[amoebocyte]]s, contain granules with a [[clotting factor]] known as [[coagulogen]]; this is released outside the cell when bacterial endotoxin is encountered.

The primary application for LAL is the testing of [[Route of administration#Parenteral by injection or infusion|parenteral]] pharmaceuticals and medical devices that contact [[blood]] or [[cerebrospinal fluid]]. In the United States, the FDA has published a guideline for validation of the [https://www.criver.com/products-services/qc-microbial-solutions/endotoxin-testing/lal-reagents-accessories LAL test] as an endotoxin test for such products.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guidance for Industry: Pyrogen and Endotoxins Testing: Questions and Answers|url=https://www.fda.gov/drugs/guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm314718.htm|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration | access-date=5 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe LAL [[Biochemical cascade|cascade]] is also triggered by (1,3)-\u03b2-D-[[glucan]], via a different Factor G.

If the product being tested causes the endotoxin recovery to be less than expected, the product is inhibitory to the LAL test. Products which cause higher than expected values are enhancing. Overcoming the inhibition and enhancement properties of a product is required by the FDA as part of the validation of the LAL test for use in the final release testing of injectables and medical devices. Proper endotoxin recovery must be proven before LAL can be used to release product.<ref>{{cite book | veditors = Williams KL |title=Endotoxins pyrogens, LAL testing and depyrogenation |date=2007 |publisher=Informa Healthcare |location=New York |isbn=1420020595 |page = 342 | edition=3rd |url= https://archive.org/details/endotoxins00kevi |url-access=registration|quote=Proper endotoxin recovery must be proven before LAL can be used to release product.|access-date=7 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Alternatives ==\n\n=== Recombinant factor C ===\n{{see also|Atlantic horseshoe crab#Conservation and management}}\n\nThe LAL test makes up a great source of animal product dependence in the biomed industry, and with reports of the higher-than anticipated mortality rate, it was considered more ethical to try to move away from the test. Since 2003, a synthetic substitute for the LAL test has been commercially available. Named the [[Recombinant technology|recombinant]] factor C (rFC) assay, it is based on the same [[Limulus clotting factor C]] protein, produced by genetically modified organisms like insect gut cells. (The specific factor C sequence used does not necessarily come from the Atlantic horseshoe crab.)<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nInstead of emulating the whole clotting pathway, rFC tests let factor C cleave a fluorogenic molecule, so that the sample lights up when endotoxin activates the factor. Since it does not contain factor G, (1,3)-\u03b2-D-glucan will not cause false-positives.

After arriving in New York in 1776, Hamilton meets [[Aaron Burr]], [[John Laurens]], [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]], and [[Hercules Mulligan]] (\"[[Aaron Burr, Sir]]\"), and impresses them with his rhetorical skills (\"[[My Shot]]\"). They affirm their revolutionary goals to each other (\"[[The Story of Tonight]]\"). Meanwhile, wealthy sisters [[Angelica Schuyler Church|Angelica]], [[Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton|Eliza]], and [[Peggy Schuyler]] go into town seeking out potential suitors (\"[[The Schuyler Sisters]]\"). [[Samuel Seabury]] warns everyone about the dangers of Congress, but Hamilton disagrees and tries to counter Seabury (\"[[Farmer Refuted]]\"). [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]] then insists on his authority (\"[[You'll Be Back]]\"). During the [[New York and New Jersey campaign]], Hamilton accepts a position as [[George Washington]]'s [[aide-de-camp]] (\"[[Right Hand Man (Hamilton song)|Right Hand Man]]\"), instead of field command.\n\nAt Philip Schuyler's ball (\"A Winter's Ball\"),  Hamilton meets, falls in love with, and later marries Eliza Schuyler (\"[[Helpless (Hamilton song)|Helpless]]\"), as Angelica suppresses her feelings for the sake of their happiness at the wedding (\"[[Satisfied (Hamilton song)|Satisfied]]\"). After the wedding, Burr congratulates Hamilton on his position as aide-de-camp to Washington; Hamilton admits that he would much rather have Burr's position on the battlefield (\"[[The Story of Tonight (Reprise)]]\"). Burr reflects on Hamilton's swift rise while considering his own career as more cautious (\"[[Wait for It (song)|Wait For It]]\").\n\nAs conditions worsen for the Continental Army, Hamilton aids Laurens in a [[duel]] against [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]] (\"Stay Alive\"), who insulted Washington. Laurens injures Lee, who in turn yields (\"[[Ten Duel Commandments]]\"). Hamilton is temporarily suspended by Washington (\"Meet Me Inside\") over the duel and is sent home. There, Eliza reveals that she is pregnant with her first child, and asks Hamilton to slow down to take in what has happened in their lives (\"That Would Be Enough\"). After Lafayette convinces France to get involved on the colonists' side (\"Guns and Ships\"), he urges Washington to call Hamilton back to help plan the final [[Siege of Yorktown]]. Washington agrees but explains to Hamilton\u2014who is convinced he should die a martyr and a hero in war\u2014that he should be careful with his actions because whatever he does will be known for ages to come (\"[[History Has Its Eyes on You]]\"). At the [[Siege of Yorktown]], Hamilton meets up with Lafayette to take down the British, revealing that Mulligan was recruited as a spy, helping them figure out how to trap the British and win the war (\"[[Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)]]\").\n\nSoon after the victory at Yorktown, King George asks the rebels how they will succeed in governing on their own (\u201c[[You'll Be Back|What Comes Next?]]\u201d). Lafayette returns to France with plans to inspire his people to have [[The French Revolution|their own revolution]]. Hamilton's son [[Philip Hamilton|Philip]] is born, while Burr has a daughter, [[Theodosia Burr Alston|Theodosia]], and the two tell their children how they will do anything to protect them (\"[[Dear Theodosia]]\"). Hamilton receives word that his friend Laurens has been killed in [[Battle of the Combahee River|a seemingly pointless battle]] after the war was won and throws himself into his work (\"[[Tomorrow There'll Be More of Us]]\"). He co-authors ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' and is selected as [[Secretary of the Treasury (United States)|Secretary of the Treasury]] by newly elected President Washington. Eliza begs Hamilton to stay. Angelica moves to London with her new husband (\"Non-Stop\").\n\n=== Act II ===\n[[Thomas Jefferson]] returns to America from being the [[List of ambassadors of the United States to France|U.S. ambassador to France]] (\"What'd I Miss\"). In 1789, Jefferson and Hamilton debate the latter's financial proposals at a [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] meeting. Washington pulls Hamilton aside, and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress (\"[[Cabinet Battle]] #1\").\n\nEliza and her family\u2014along with Angelica, back from London\u2014travel upstate during the summer, while Hamilton stays home to work on the compromise (\"Take a Break\"). Hamilton [[Hamilton\u2013Reynolds sex scandal|begins an affair]] with [[Maria Reynolds]], making him vulnerable to her husband's blackmail (\"[[Say No To This]]\"). Hamilton, Jefferson, and [[James Madison]] create the [[Compromise of 1790]] over a private dinner, exchanging Hamilton's financial plan for placing the country's permanent capital on the Potomac River. Burr is envious of Hamilton's sway in the government and wishes he had similar power (\"[[The Room Where It Happens]]\"). Burr switches political parties and defeats Philip Schuyler, making Hamilton now a rival (\"Schuyler Defeated\").\n\nIn another Cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in its [[War of the First Coalition|conflict with Britain]]. President Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument for remaining [[Proclamation of Neutrality|neutral]] (\"[[Cabinet Battle]] #2\"). In the wake of this, Jefferson, Madison, and Burr decide to join forces to find a way to discredit Hamilton in Washington's eyes (\"Washington on Your Side\"). Washington decides to retire from the presidency, and Hamilton assists in writing a [[George Washington's Farewell Address|farewell address]] (\"[[One Last Time (Hamilton)|One Last Time]]\").\n\nA flabbergasted King George receives word that George Washington has stepped down, and will be replaced by [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Paris]] signatory [[John Adams]] (\u201cI Know Him\u201d). John Adams [[1796 United States presidential election|becomes the second President]] and fires Hamilton, who publishes an inflammatory critique of the new president as a response (\"[[The Adams Administration]]\"). In the face of accusations of speculation of government funds by Jefferson, Madison, and Burr\u2014and out of fear that his affair with Maria Reynolds will be used against him in his political career (\"We Know\")\u2014Hamilton chooses to publicize his affair (\"Hurricane\") in the Reynolds Pamphlet (\"[[The Reynolds Pamphlet (song)|The Reynolds Pamphlet]]\"), damaging his relationship with Eliza. Eliza, in a heartbroken retaliation, burns all the letters Hamilton wrote her (\"Burn\"). Philip, instructed by Hamilton, challenges [[George Eacker]] to a duel and is critically injured (\"Blow Us All Away\") and dies (\"Stay Alive (Reprise)\"), causing a reconciliation between Alexander and Eliza (\"[[It's Quiet Uptown]]\").\n\nHamilton's endorsement of Jefferson in [[1800 United States presidential election|the presidential election of 1800]] (\"The Election of 1800\") results in further animosity between Hamilton and Burr, who [[Burr\u2013Hamilton duel|challenges Hamilton to a duel]] via an exchange of letters (\"[[Your Obedient Servant (song)|Your Obedient Servant]]\"). Hamilton writes his last letter in a rush while Eliza tells him to go back to bed (\u201cBest of Wives and Best of Women\u201d). Burr and Hamilton travel to New Jersey for the duel. During the duel, both Burr and Hamilton fire at each other after ten paces, with Hamilton intentionally missing (''[[Deloping|throwing away]]'') his shot. Hamilton dies as a result, with Eliza and Angelica at his side. Burr laments that even though he survived, he is cursed to be remembered as the villain who killed Hamilton (\"[[The World Was Wide Enough]]\"). The musical closes with a reflection on historical memory, showing how Eliza kept Hamilton's legacy alive (\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\").\n\n== Roles and principal casts ==\n=== Original production casts ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

About the origin of the song, Yankovic said, \"Lin pitched it to me as a polka medley way more hesitantly than [he] should have. He was like, 'Would you want to do a polka medley?' I was like, 'Of course I do!{{'\"}} Since Yankovic was busy working on his new tour, he wouldn't be able to release the song in February, so he suggested calling March 2 \"February 30th\".

For example, while Angelica did have a strong relationship with Hamilton, it was exaggerated in the show. During \"Satisfied\", Angelica explains why Hamilton is not suitable for her despite wanting him. In particular, she states, \"I'm a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich. My father has no sons so I'm the one who has to social climb for one.\" In actuality, Angelica had less pressure on her to do this. [[Philip Schuyler]] actually had fifteen children, including two sons who survived into adulthood (one of whom was New York State Assemblyman [[Philip Jeremiah Schuyler]]), and Angelica had eloped with [[John Barker Church]] three years before she met Hamilton at her sister's wedding, when she was already a mother of two of her eight children with Church.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"The Lovesick Colonel\"</ref> Miranda stated that he chose to do this because it is stronger dramatically if Angelica is available but cannot marry him.<ref>{{cite video |last=[[Genius (website)|Genius]] |title=Hamilton: Lin-Manuel Miranda on the Play's Historical Inaccuracies |date=November 2, 2015 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRJEOsyCfvQ |accessdate=March 23, 2016 |via=YouTube |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412170327/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRJEOsyCfvQ |archivedate=April 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://genius.com/7912429 |title=Satsified Lyrics and Commentary |work=Genius |access-date=May 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"bustle accuracy\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/165821-how-historically-accurate-is-hamilton-a-breakdown-of-the-musicals-events-what-really-happened-so |title=How Historically Accurate Is 'Hamilton'?

For example, while Burr was present at the [[Battle of Monmouth]], Burr did not serve as Charles Lee's second in his duel with John Laurens as seen in \"Ten Duel Commandments\"; Lee's second was Evan Edwards.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"A Frenzy of Valor\"</ref> Hamilton also never approached Burr to help write ''The Federalist Papers'' as portrayed in \"Non-Stop\".<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"Publius\"</ref>\n\nDuring Act I, the character of Aaron Burr says that \"...[[Martha Washington]] named her feral tomcat after him! [Hamilton]\", to which Alexander Hamilton replies: \"That's true!\"<ref>{{cite web |title=A Winter's Ball |url=https://genius.com/Lin-manuel-miranda-a-winters-ball-lyrics |website=genius.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160721091940/http://genius.com/Lin-manuel-miranda-a-winters-ball-lyrics |archivedate=July 21, 2016}}</ref> In fact, it is false. The idea of Hamilton as a serial adulterer has been one of the biggest mischaracterizations of the real Alexander Hamilton for two centuries, with celebrated authors repeating the story over and over again, notwithstanding that the sexual connotation of ''tomcat'' as a womanizer did not appear in dictionaries until the first half of the 20th century. The \"tomcat\" story has been previously discredited by author Stephen Knott,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Knott |first1=Stephen F. |title='Hamilton: An American Musical' echoes John and Abigail Adams's accusations that Alexander Hamilton was a serial adulterer.

While it is true that John Adams and Hamilton did not particularly get along, John Adams did not fire Hamilton as told in the show. Hamilton tendered his resignation from his position as Secretary of the Treasury on December 1, 1794,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hamilton |first1=Alexander |title=Letter from Alexander Hamilton to George Washington, 1 December 1794 |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-17-02-0392 |website=Founders Online}}</ref> two years before Adams became president.

In summer 1797, journalist [[James T. Callender]] broke the story of Hamilton's infidelity. Hamilton blamed Monroe, and the altercation nearly ended in a duel.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"Too Near The Sun\"</ref> With nothing left to do, Hamilton then published ''The Reynolds Pamphlet''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/alexander-hamiltons-adultery-and-apology-18021947/ |title=Alexander Hamilton's Adultery and Apology |last=Serratore |first=Angela |website=Smithsonian |access-date=March 24, 2016}}</ref> The impact of the pamphlet's publication is exaggerated, as it was actually the later publication of a pamphlet criticizing Adams during the election of 1800 (referenced in \u201cThe Adams Administration\u201d) that effectively ended Hamilton's political career.\n\nIn \"Take a Break\", Philip Hamilton, at age 9, claims, \"I have a sister, but I want a little brother\". Philip already had two younger brothers at the time: [[Alexander Hamilton Jr.]] and [[James Alexander Hamilton]]. On the same song, Angelica sends a letter to Hamilton, revealing she would come back to America from Europe for the summer. She did not send such a letter and remained in her home.\n\nIn \"Blow Us All Away\", George Eacker and Philip engage in a duel, before the events of the 1800 presidential election. The duel actually occurred in 1801, with Philip Hamilton dying on November 24. In the song, Eacker fires on Philip at the count of seven; in real life, both men refused to fire for over a minute before Eacker shot Philip in the hips.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"A World Full of Folly\"</ref>\n\nFinally, it was not the presidential election of 1800 that led to Burr and Hamilton's duel. Burr did become Jefferson's vice-president, but when Jefferson decided not to run with Burr for reelection in 1804, Burr opted to run for [[Governor of New York]] instead. Burr lost to [[Morgan Lewis (governor)|Morgan Lewis]] in a landslide. Afterward, a letter was published in ''The Albany Register'' from [[Charles D. Cooper]] to Philip Schuyler, claiming that Hamilton called Burr \"a dangerous man and one who ought not be trusted with the reins of government\", and that he knew of \"a still more despicable opinion which General Hamilton has expressed of Mr. Burr\".<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AroTfeaadKYC |title=Duel: Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr, and the Future of America |last=Flemming |first=Thomas |publisher=Basic Books |year=1999 |isbn=0-465-01737-1 |location=New York |pages=233\u2013284 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513225100/https://books.google.com/books?id=AroTfeaadKYC |archivedate=May 13, 2016}}</ref> This led to the letters between Burr and Hamilton as seen in the show in \"Your Obedient Servant\".\n\n==== Critical analysis and scholarship ====\nThe show has been critiqued for a simplistic depiction of Hamilton and vilification of Jefferson.

After arriving in New York in 1776, Hamilton meets [[Aaron Burr]], [[John Laurens]], [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]], and [[Hercules Mulligan]] (\"[[Aaron Burr, Sir]]\"), and impresses them with his rhetorical skills (\"[[My Shot]]\"). They affirm their revolutionary goals to each other (\"[[The Story of Tonight]]\"). Meanwhile, wealthy sisters [[Angelica Schuyler Church|Angelica]], [[Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton|Eliza]], and [[Peggy Schuyler]] go into town seeking out potential suitors (\"[[The Schuyler Sisters]]\"). [[Samuel Seabury]] warns everyone about the dangers of Congress, but Hamilton disagrees and tries to counter Seabury (\"[[Farmer Refuted]]\"). [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]] then insists on his authority (\"[[You'll Be Back]]\"). During the [[New York and New Jersey campaign]], Hamilton accepts a position as [[George Washington]]'s [[aide-de-camp]] (\"[[Right Hand Man (Hamilton song)|Right Hand Man]]\"), instead of field command.\n\nAt Philip Schuyler's ball (\"A Winter's Ball\"),  Hamilton meets, falls in love with, and later marries Eliza Schuyler (\"[[Helpless (Hamilton song)|Helpless]]\"), as Angelica suppresses her feelings for the sake of their happiness at the wedding (\"[[Satisfied (Hamilton song)|Satisfied]]\"). After the wedding, Burr congratulates Hamilton on his position as aide-de-camp to Washington; Hamilton admits that he would much rather have Burr's position on the battlefield (\"[[The Story of Tonight (Reprise)]]\"). Burr reflects on Hamilton's swift rise while considering his own career as more cautious (\"[[Wait for It (song)|Wait For It]]\").\n\nAs conditions worsen for the Continental Army, Hamilton aids Laurens in a [[duel]] against [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]] (\"Stay Alive\"), who insulted Washington. Laurens injures Lee, who in turn yields (\"[[Ten Duel Commandments]]\"). Hamilton is temporarily suspended by Washington (\"Meet Me Inside\") over the duel and is sent home. There, Eliza reveals that she is pregnant with her first child, and asks Hamilton to slow down to take in what has happened in their lives (\"That Would Be Enough\"). After Lafayette convinces France to get involved on the colonists' side (\"Guns and Ships\"), he urges Washington to call Hamilton back to help plan the final [[Siege of Yorktown]]. Washington agrees but explains to Hamilton\u2014who is convinced he should die a martyr and a hero in war\u2014that he should be careful with his actions because whatever he does will be known for ages to come (\"[[History Has Its Eyes on You]]\"). At the [[Siege of Yorktown]], Hamilton meets up with Lafayette to take down the British, revealing that Mulligan was recruited as a spy, helping them figure out how to trap the British and win the war (\"[[Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)]]\").\n\nSoon after the victory at Yorktown, King George asks the rebels how they will succeed in governing on their own (\u201c[[You'll Be Back|What Comes Next?]]\u201d). Lafayette returns to France with plans to inspire his people to have [[The French Revolution|their own revolution]]. Hamilton's son [[Philip Hamilton|Philip]] is born, while Burr has a daughter, [[Theodosia Burr Alston|Theodosia]], and the two tell their children how they will do anything to protect them (\"[[Dear Theodosia]]\"). Hamilton receives word that his friend Laurens has been killed in [[Battle of the Combahee River|a seemingly pointless battle]] after the war was won and throws himself into his work (\"[[Tomorrow There'll Be More of Us]]\"). He co-authors ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' and is selected as [[Secretary of the Treasury (United States)|Secretary of the Treasury]] by newly elected President Washington. Eliza begs Hamilton to stay. Angelica moves to London with her new husband (\"Non-Stop\").\n\n=== Act II ===\n[[Thomas Jefferson]] returns to America from being the [[List of ambassadors of the United States to France|U.S. ambassador to France]] (\"What'd I Miss\"). In 1789, Jefferson and Hamilton debate the latter's financial proposals at a [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] meeting. Washington pulls Hamilton aside, and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress (\"[[Cabinet Battle]] #1\").\n\nEliza and her family\u2014along with Angelica, back from London\u2014travel upstate during the summer, while Hamilton stays home to work on the compromise (\"Take a Break\"). Hamilton [[Hamilton\u2013Reynolds sex scandal|begins an affair]] with [[Maria Reynolds]], making him vulnerable to her husband's blackmail (\"[[Say No To This]]\"). Hamilton, Jefferson, and [[James Madison]] create the [[Compromise of 1790]] over a private dinner, exchanging Hamilton's financial plan for placing the country's permanent capital on the Potomac River. Burr is envious of Hamilton's sway in the government and wishes he had similar power (\"[[The Room Where It Happens]]\"). Burr switches political parties and defeats Philip Schuyler, making Hamilton now a rival (\"Schuyler Defeated\").\n\nIn another Cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in its [[War of the First Coalition|conflict with Britain]]. President Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument for remaining [[Proclamation of Neutrality|neutral]] (\"[[Cabinet Battle]] #2\"). In the wake of this, Jefferson, Madison, and Burr decide to join forces to find a way to discredit Hamilton in Washington's eyes (\"Washington on Your Side\"). Washington decides to retire from the presidency, and Hamilton assists in writing a [[George Washington's Farewell Address|farewell address]] (\"[[One Last Time (Hamilton)|One Last Time]]\").\n\nA flabbergasted King George receives word that George Washington has stepped down, and will be replaced by [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Paris]] signatory [[John Adams]] (\u201cI Know Him\u201d). John Adams [[1796 United States presidential election|becomes the second President]] and fires Hamilton, who publishes an inflammatory critique of the new president as a response (\"[[The Adams Administration]]\"). In the face of accusations of speculation of government funds by Jefferson, Madison, and Burr\u2014and out of fear that his affair with Maria Reynolds will be used against him in his political career (\"We Know\")\u2014Hamilton chooses to publicize his affair (\"Hurricane\") in the Reynolds Pamphlet (\"[[The Reynolds Pamphlet (song)|The Reynolds Pamphlet]]\"), damaging his relationship with Eliza. Eliza, in a heartbroken retaliation, burns all the letters Hamilton wrote her (\"Burn\"). Philip, instructed by Hamilton, challenges [[George Eacker]] to a duel and is critically injured (\"Blow Us All Away\") and dies (\"Stay Alive (Reprise)\"), causing a reconciliation between Alexander and Eliza (\"[[It's Quiet Uptown]]\").\n\nHamilton's endorsement of Jefferson in [[1800 United States presidential election|the presidential election of 1800]] (\"The Election of 1800\") results in further animosity between Hamilton and Burr, who [[Burr\u2013Hamilton duel|challenges Hamilton to a duel]] via an exchange of letters (\"[[Your Obedient Servant (song)|Your Obedient Servant]]\"). Hamilton writes his last letter in a rush while Eliza tells him to go back to bed (\u201cBest of Wives and Best of Women\u201d). Burr and Hamilton travel to New Jersey for the duel. During the duel, both Burr and Hamilton fire at each other after ten paces, with Hamilton intentionally missing (''[[Deloping|throwing away]]'') his shot. Hamilton dies as a result, with Eliza and Angelica at his side. Burr laments that even though he survived, he is cursed to be remembered as the villain who killed Hamilton (\"[[The World Was Wide Enough]]\"). The musical closes with a reflection on historical memory, showing how Eliza kept Hamilton's legacy alive (\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\").\n\n== Roles and principal casts ==\n=== Original production casts ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

A fan of Yankovic since childhood, Miranda became friends with him after they tried to develop a musical together. About the origin of the song, Yankovic said, \"Lin pitched it to me as a polka medley way more hesitantly than [he] should have. He was like, 'Would you want to do a polka medley?' I was like, 'Of course I do!{{'\"}} Since Yankovic was busy working on his new tour, he wouldn't be able to release the song in February, so he suggested calling March 2 \"February 30th\".

For example, while Angelica did have a strong relationship with Hamilton, it was exaggerated in the show. During \"Satisfied\", Angelica explains why Hamilton is not suitable for her despite wanting him. In particular, she states, \"I'm a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich. My father has no sons so I'm the one who has to social climb for one.\" In actuality, Angelica had less pressure on her to do this. [[Philip Schuyler]] actually had fifteen children, including two sons who survived into adulthood (one of whom was New York State Assemblyman [[Philip Jeremiah Schuyler]]), and Angelica had eloped with [[John Barker Church]] three years before she met Hamilton at her sister's wedding, when she was already a mother of two of her eight children with Church.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"The Lovesick Colonel\"</ref> Miranda stated that he chose to do this because it is stronger dramatically if Angelica is available but cannot marry him.<ref>{{cite video |last=[[Genius (website)|Genius]] |title=Hamilton: Lin-Manuel Miranda on the Play's Historical Inaccuracies |date=November 2, 2015 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRJEOsyCfvQ |accessdate=March 23, 2016 |via=YouTube |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412170327/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRJEOsyCfvQ |archivedate=April 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://genius.com/7912429 |title=Satsified Lyrics and Commentary |work=Genius |access-date=May 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"bustle accuracy\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/165821-how-historically-accurate-is-hamilton-a-breakdown-of-the-musicals-events-what-really-happened-so |title=How Historically Accurate Is 'Hamilton'?

For example, while Burr was present at the [[Battle of Monmouth]], Burr did not serve as Charles Lee's second in his duel with John Laurens as seen in \"Ten Duel Commandments\"; Lee's second was Evan Edwards.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"A Frenzy of Valor\"</ref> Hamilton also never approached Burr to help write ''The Federalist Papers'' as portrayed in \"Non-Stop\".<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"Publius\"</ref>\n\nDuring Act I, the character of Aaron Burr says that \"...[[Martha Washington]] named her feral tomcat after him!

Burr did become Jefferson's vice-president, but when Jefferson decided not to run with Burr for reelection in 1804, Burr opted to run for [[Governor of New York]] instead. Burr lost to [[Morgan Lewis (governor)|Morgan Lewis]] in a landslide. Afterward, a letter was published in ''The Albany Register'' from [[Charles D.

Fibrillation.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Normal rhythm tracing (top) Atrial fibrillation (bottom)]]\n[[File:Atrial fib stroke.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|How a stroke can occur during atrial fibrillation]]\nAF is usually accompanied by symptoms related to a rapid heart rate. Rapid and irregular heart rates may be perceived as [[palpitations|the sensation of the heart beating too fast, irregularly, or skipping beats (palpitations)]] or [[exercise intolerance]] and occasionally may produce [[Angina pectoris|anginal chest pain]] (if the high heart rate causes [[ischemia|the heart's demand for oxygen to increase beyond the supply of available oxygen (ischemia)]]). Other possible symptoms include [[heart failure|congestive heart failure]] symptoms such as fatigue, [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], or [[edema|swelling]]. The [[Heart arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia)]] is sometimes only identified with the onset of a [[stroke]] or a [[transient ischemic attack]] (TIA). It is not uncommon for a person to first become aware of AF from a routine physical examination or [[electrocardiogram|ECG]], as it often does not cause symptoms.<ref name=AHA2006/>\n\nSince most cases of AF are secondary to other medical problems, the presence of [[chest pain]] or [[angina]], signs and symptoms of [[hyperthyroidism]] (an overactive [[thyroid gland]]) such as [[weight loss]] and [[diarrhea]], and symptoms suggestive of [[lung disease]] can indicate an underlying cause. A history of stroke or TIA, as well as [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[heart failure]], or [[rheumatic fever]], may indicate whether someone with AF is at a higher risk of complications.<ref name=AHA2006/> The risk of a blood clot forming in the left atrial chamber of the heart, [[embolus|breaking off, and then traveling in the bloodstream]] can be assessed using the [[CHADS2 score|CHADS<sub>2</sub>]] or CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score.\n\n===Rapid heart rate===\nPresentation is similar to other forms of [[tachycardia|rapid heart rate]] and may be asymptomatic.<ref name=\"Gutierrez2011\">{{cite journal |vauthors = Gutierrez C, Blanchard DG |title = Atrial Fibrillation: Diagnosis and Treatment |journal = Am Fam Physician |volume = 83 |issue = 1 |pages = 61\u201368 |date = January 2011 |url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2011/0101/p61.html |type = Review |pmid = 21888129 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131224120005/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2011/0101/p61.html |archivedate = 24 December 2013 }}</ref> [[Palpitations]] and chest discomfort are common complaints.<ref name=\"Gutierrez2011\"/> The rapid uncoordinated heart rate may result in reduced [[cardiac output|output of blood pumped by the heart (cardiac output)]], resulting in inadequate blood flow, and therefore oxygen delivery to the rest of the body. Common symptoms of uncontrolled atrial fibrillation may include [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]],<ref name=\"Gutierrez2011\"/> [[orthopnea|shortness of breath when lying flat]], dizziness, and [[paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea|sudden onset of shortness of breath during the night]]. This may progress to [[peripheral edema|swelling of the lower extremities]], a manifestation of congestive heart failure. Due to inadequate cardiac output, individuals with AF may also complain of [[light-headedness]],<ref name=\"Gutierrez2011\"/> may feel like they are [[presyncope|about to faint]], or may [[Syncope (medicine)|lose consciousness]].\n\nAF can cause [[respiratory distress]] due to congestion in the lungs. By definition, the heart rate will be [[tachycardia|greater than 100 beats per minute]]. Blood pressure may be variable, and often difficult to measure as the beat-by-beat variability causes problems for most digital (oscillometric) [[Sphygmomanometer|non-invasive blood pressure]] monitors. For this reason, when determining the heart rate in AF, direct cardiac [[auscultation]] is recommended. [[Hypotension|Low blood pressure]] is most concerning, and a sign that immediate treatment is required. Many of the symptoms associated with uncontrolled atrial fibrillation are a manifestation of congestive heart failure due to the reduced cardiac output. The affected person's respiratory rate often increases in the presence of respiratory distress. Pulse oximetry may confirm the presence of [[Hypoxia (medical)|too little oxygen reaching the body's tissues]], related to any precipitating factors such as [[pneumonia]]. Examination of the [[jugular veins]] may reveal elevated [[jugular venous pressure|pressure]] (jugular venous distention). Examination of the lungs may reveal crackles, which are suggestive of [[pulmonary edema]]. Examination of the heart will reveal a rapid irregular rhythm.\n\n==Causes==\n[[File:RiskFactors.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|Non-modifiable [[risk factors]] (top left box) and modifiable risk factors (bottom left box) for atrial fibrillation.

These diseases are associated with an increased risk of AF due to their remodeling effects on the left atrium.<ref name=\"Staerk\" />\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nThe normal [[electrical conduction system of the heart]] allows the impulse that is generated by the [[sinoatrial node]] (SA node) of the heart to be propagated to and stimulate the [[myocardium]] (muscular layer of the heart). When the myocardium is stimulated, it contracts. It is the ordered stimulation of the myocardium that allows efficient contraction of the heart, thereby allowing blood to be pumped to the body.\n\nIn AF, the normal regular electrical impulses generated by the sinoatrial node in the [[right atrium]] of the heart are overwhelmed by disorganized electrical impulses, usually originating in the roots of the [[pulmonary veins]]. This leads to irregular conduction of [[ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] impulses that generate the heartbeat.\n\n===Pathology===\nThe primary pathologic change seen in atrial fibrillation is the progressive [[fibrosis]] of the atria. This fibrosis is due primarily to atrial dilation; however, genetic causes and inflammation may be factors in some individuals. Dilation of the atria can be due to almost any structural abnormality of the heart that can cause a rise in the pressure within the heart. This includes [[valvular heart disease]] (such as [[mitral stenosis]], [[mitral regurgitation]], and [[tricuspid regurgitation]]), hypertension, and congestive heart failure. Any inflammatory state that affects the heart can cause fibrosis of the atria. This is typically due to sarcoidosis but may also be due to autoimmune disorders that create autoantibodies against [[myosin]] heavy chains. Mutation of the ''[[lamin]] AC'' gene is also associated with fibrosis of the atria that can lead to atrial fibrillation.\n\nOnce dilation of the atria has occurred, this begins a chain of events that leads to the activation of the [[renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system]] (RAAS) and subsequent increase in matrix [[metalloproteinase]]s and [[disintegrin]], which leads to atrial remodeling and fibrosis, with loss of atrial muscle mass. This process occurs gradually, and experimental studies have revealed patchy atrial fibrosis may precede the occurrence of atrial fibrillation and may progress with prolonged durations of atrial fibrillation.\n\nFibrosis is not limited to the muscle mass of the atria and may occur in the [[sinus node]] (SA node) and [[atrioventricular node]] (AV node), correlating with [[sick sinus syndrome]]. Prolonged episodes of atrial fibrillation have been shown to correlate with prolongation of the sinus node recovery time;<ref name=AHA2006/> this suggests that dysfunction of the SA node is progressive with prolonged episodes of atrial fibrillation.\n\n===Electrophysiology===\n{| border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=\"3\" align=\"right\"\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#abcdef\" colspan=\"3\" | Conduction\n|-\n| <small>Sinus rhythm</small> [[File:Heart conduct sinus.gif|none|230px]]\n| <small>Atrial fibrillation</small> [[File:Heart conduct atrialfib.gif|none|230px]]\n|}\n\nThere are multiple theories about the cause of atrial fibrillation. An important theory is that, in atrial fibrillation, the regular impulses produced by the sinus node for a normal heartbeat are overwhelmed by rapid electrical discharges produced in the atria and adjacent parts of the [[pulmonary veins]]. Sources of these disturbances are either automatic foci, often localized at one of the pulmonary veins, or a small number of localized sources in the form of either a re-entrant leading circle or electrical spiral waves (rotors); these localized sources may be found in the left atrium near the pulmonary veins or a variety of other locations through both the left or right atrium. Three fundamental components favor the establishment of a leading circle or a rotor: slow conduction velocity of the [[cardiac action potential]], a short [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]], and a small [[wavelength]]. Meanwhile, the wavelength is the product of velocity and refractory period. If the action potential has fast conduction, with a long refractory period and/or conduction pathway shorter than the wavelength, an AF focus would not be established. In multiple wavelet theory, a wavefront will break into smaller daughter wavelets when encountering an obstacle, through a process called vortex shedding. But, under the proper conditions, such wavelets can reform and spin around a center, forming an AF focus.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Waks |first1 = Jonathan W |last2 = Josephson |first2 = Mark E |title = Mechanisms of Atrial Fibrillation \u2013 Reentry, Rotors and Reality |journal = Arrhythmia & Electrophysiology Review|date = August 2015 |volume = 3 |issue = 2 |pages = 90\u2013100 |doi = 10.15420/aer.2014.3.2.90 |pmc = 4711504 |pmid = 26835073 }}</ref>\n\nIn a heart with AF, the increased calcium release from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] and increased calcium sensitivity can lead to an accumulation of intracellular calcium and causes downregulation of [[L-type calcium channel]]s. This reduces the duration of action potential and refractory period, thus favorable for the conduction of re-entrant waves. Increased expression of [[inward-rectifier potassium ion channel]]s can cause a reduced atrial refractory period and wavelength. The abnormal distribution of [[gap junction protein]]s such as [[GJA1]] (also known as Connexin 43), and [[GJA5]] (Connexin 40) causes non-uniformity of electrical conduction, thus causing the arrhythmia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Pellman |first1 = J |last2 = Sheikh |first2 = F |title = Atrial fibrillation: mechanisms, therapeutics, and future directions |journal = Comprehensive Physiology |date = April 2015 |volume = 5 |issue = 2 |doi = 10.1002/cphy.c140047 |pmc = 5240842 |pmid = 25880508 |pages = 649\u201365 }}</ref>\n\nAF can be distinguished from [[atrial flutter]] (AFL), which appears as an organized electrical circuit usually in the right atrium. AFL produces characteristic saw-toothed F-waves of constant amplitude and frequency on an [[electrocardiogram|ECG]], whereas AF does not. In AFL, the discharges circulate rapidly at a rate of 300&nbsp;beats per minute (bpm) around the atrium. In AF, there is no regularity of this kind, except at the sources where the local activation rate can exceed 500 bpm.  Although AF and atrial flutter are distinct arrhythmias, atrial flutter may degenerate into AF, and  an individual may experience both arrhythmias at different times.<ref name=Bun2015 />\n\nAlthough the electrical impulses of AF occur at a high rate, most of them do not result in a heartbeat. A heartbeat results when an electrical impulse from the atria passes through the [[Atrioventricular node|atrioventricular (AV) node]] to the ventricles and causes them to contract. During AF, if all of the impulses from the atria passed through the AV node, there would be severe [[ventricular tachycardia]], resulting in a severe reduction of [[cardiac output]]. This dangerous situation is prevented by the AV node since its limited conduction velocity reduces the rate at which impulses reach the ventricles during AF.<ref name='Klabunde2005'>{{cite book |last = Klabunde |first = Richard |title = Cardiovascular Physiology Concepts |publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |year = 2005 |location = |pages = 25, 28 |url = |doi = |id = |isbn = 9780781750301 }}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:RapidAFib150.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A 12-lead ECG showing atrial fibrillation at approximately 150 beats per minute]]\n[[Image:SinusRhythmLabels.svg|thumb|Diagram of [[normal sinus rhythm]] as seen on [[ECG]].

The goal of this evaluation is to determine the general treatment regimen for the individual. If the results of the general evaluation warrant it, further studies may then be performed.\n\n====History and physical examination====\nThe history of the individual's atrial fibrillation episodes is probably the most important part of the evaluation. Distinctions should be made between those who are entirely asymptomatic when they are in AF (in which case the AF is found as an incidental finding on an ECG or physical examination) and those who have gross and obvious symptoms due to AF and can pinpoint whenever they go into AF or revert to sinus rhythm.\n\n====Routine bloodwork====\nWhile many cases of AF have no definite cause, it may be the result of various other problems. Hence, [[kidney function]] and [[electrolyte]]s are routinely determined, as well as thyroid-stimulating hormone (commonly suppressed in [[hyperthyroidism]] and of relevance if [[amiodarone]] is administered for treatment) and a [[complete blood count|blood count]].<ref name=AHA2006/>\n\nIn acute-onset AF associated with [[chest pain]], [[troponin|cardiac troponins]], or other markers of damage to the heart muscle may be ordered.

Characteristic findings are the absence of P waves, with disorganized electrical activity in their place, and irregular R\u2013R intervals due to irregular conduction of impulses to the ventricles.<ref name=AHA2006/> At very fast heart rates, atrial fibrillation may look more regular, which may make it more difficult to separate from other [[supraventricular tachycardia]]s or [[ventricular tachycardia]].<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Issa |first1 = Ziad F. |last2 = Miller |first2 = John M. |last3 = Zipes |first3 = Douglas P. |name-list-format = vanc |title = Clinical arrhythmology and electrophysiology : a companion to Braunwald's heart disease |year = 2009 |publisher = Saunders |location = Philadelphia |isbn = 9781416059981 |page = 221 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=a8s8nd2JAiwC&pg=PA221 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170908144250/https://books.google.com/books?id=a8s8nd2JAiwC&pg=PA221 |archivedate = 8 September 2017 }}</ref>\n\n[[QRS complex]]es should be narrow, signifying that they are initiated by normal conduction of atrial electrical activity through the [[electrical conduction system of the heart|intraventricular conduction system]]. Wide QRS complexes are worrisome for ventricular tachycardia, although, in cases where there is a disease of the conduction system, wide complexes may be present in A-fib with rapid ventricular response.\n\nIf paroxysmal AF is suspected, but an ECG during an office visit shows only a regular rhythm, AF episodes may be detected and documented with the use of ambulatory [[Holter monitor]]ing (e.g., for a day). If the episodes are too infrequent to be detected by Holter monitoring with reasonable probability, then the person can be monitored for longer periods (e.g., a month) with an ambulatory [[cardiac event monitor|event monitor]].<ref name=AHA2006/>\n\n====Echocardiography====\nIn general, a non-invasive transthoracic [[echocardiogram]] (TTE) is performed in newly diagnosed AF, as well as if there is a major change in the person's clinical state. This ultrasound-based scan of the heart may help identify [[valvular heart disease]] (which may greatly increase the risk of stroke and alter recommendations for the appropriate type of anticoagulation), left and right atrial size (which predicts the likelihood that AF may become permanent), left ventricular size and function, peak right ventricular pressure ([[pulmonary hypertension]]), presence of left atrial thrombus (low sensitivity), presence of left ventricular hypertrophy and pericardial disease.<ref name=AHA2006/>\n\nSignificant enlargement of both the left and right atria is associated with long-standing atrial fibrillation and, if noted at the initial presentation of atrial fibrillation, suggests that the atrial fibrillation is likely to be of a longer duration than the individual's symptoms.\n\n===Extended evaluation===\nIn general, an extended evaluation is not necessary for most individuals with atrial fibrillation and is performed only if abnormalities are noted in the limited evaluation, if a reversible cause of the atrial fibrillation is suggested, or if further evaluation may change the treatment course.\n\n====Chest X-ray====\nIn general, a [[chest X-ray]] is performed only if a pulmonary cause of atrial fibrillation is suggested, or if other cardiac conditions are suspected (in particular [[congestive heart failure]]). This may reveal an underlying problem in the lungs or the blood vessels in the chest.<ref name=AHA2006/> In particular, if an underlying pneumonia is suggested, then treatment of the pneumonia may cause the atrial fibrillation to terminate on its own.\n\n====Transesophageal echocardiogram====\nA regular echocardiogram ([[Transthoracic echocardiogram|transthoracic echo/TTE]]) has a low sensitivity for identifying [[thrombus|blood clots]] in the heart. If this is suspected (e.g., when planning urgent electrical cardioversion), a [[Transesophageal echocardiogram|transesophageal echocardiogram/TEE]] (or TOE where British spelling is used) is preferred.<ref name=AHA2006/>\n\nThe TEE has much better visualization of the [[left atrial appendage]] than transthoracic echocardiography.<ref name=\"Romero2014\">{{cite journal |last1 = Romero |first1 = J |last2 = Cao |first2 = JJ |last3 = Garcia |first3 = MJ |last4 = Taub |first4 = CC |title = Cardiac imaging for assessment of left atrial appendage stasis and thrombosis |journal = Nature Reviews.

In individuals with symptoms of significant shortness of breath with exertion or palpitations regularly, a Holter monitor may be of benefit to determine whether rapid heart rates (or unusually slow heart rates) during atrial fibrillation are the cause of the symptoms.\n\n====Exercise stress testing====\nSome individuals with atrial fibrillation do well with normal activity but develop shortness of breath with exertion. It may be unclear whether the shortness of breath is due to a blunted heart rate response to exertion caused by excessive [[atrioventricular node]]-blocking agents, a very rapid heart rate during exertion, or other underlying conditions such as chronic lung disease or coronary ischemia. An [[cardiac stress test|exercise stress test]] will evaluate the individual's heart rate response to exertion and determine if the AV node blocking agents are contributing to the symptoms.\n\n===Classification===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style = \"float: right; margin-left:15px; text-align:center\"\n|+Classification system\n|-\n! width=\"100\"| AF category\n! width=\"350\"| Defining characteristics\n|-\n| &nbsp; First detected\n| &nbsp; only one diagnosed episode\n|-\n| &nbsp; Paroxysmal\n| &nbsp; recurrent episodes that stop on their own in less than seven days\n|-\n| &nbsp; Persistent\n| &nbsp; recurrent episodes that last more than seven days\n|-\n| &nbsp; Permanent\n| &nbsp; an ongoing long-term episode\n|-\n|}\n\nThe [[American College of Cardiology]] (ACC), [[American Heart Association]] (AHA), and the [[European Society of Cardiology]] (ESC) recommend in their guidelines the following classification system based on simplicity and clinical relevance.<ref name=AHA2006/>\n\nAll people with AF are initially in the category called ''first detected AF''.

If the episode lasts for more than seven days, it is unlikely to stop on its own and is then known as persistent AF. In this case, cardioversion can be used to stop the episode.

Fibrillation.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Normal rhythm tracing (top) Atrial fibrillation (bottom)]]\n[[File:Atrial fib stroke.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|How a stroke can occur during atrial fibrillation]]\nAF is usually accompanied by symptoms related to a rapid heart rate. Rapid and irregular heart rates may be perceived as [[palpitations|the sensation of the heart beating too fast, irregularly, or skipping beats (palpitations)]] or [[exercise intolerance]] and occasionally may produce [[Angina pectoris|anginal chest pain]] (if the high heart rate causes [[ischemia|the heart's demand for oxygen to increase beyond the supply of available oxygen (ischemia)]]). Other possible symptoms include [[heart failure|congestive heart failure]] symptoms such as fatigue, [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]], or [[edema|swelling]]. The [[Heart arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia)]] is sometimes only identified with the onset of a [[stroke]] or a [[transient ischemic attack]] (TIA). It is not uncommon for a person to first become aware of AF from a routine physical examination or [[electrocardiogram|ECG]], as it often does not cause symptoms.<ref name=AHA2006/>\n\nSince most cases of AF are secondary to other medical problems, the presence of [[chest pain]] or [[angina]], signs and symptoms of [[hyperthyroidism]] (an overactive [[thyroid gland]]) such as [[weight loss]] and [[diarrhea]], and symptoms suggestive of [[lung disease]] can indicate an underlying cause. A history of stroke or TIA, as well as [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[heart failure]], or [[rheumatic fever]], may indicate whether someone with AF is at a higher risk of complications.<ref name=AHA2006/> The risk of a blood clot forming in the left atrial chamber of the heart, [[embolus|breaking off, and then traveling in the bloodstream]] can be assessed using the [[CHADS2 score|CHADS<sub>2</sub>]] or CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score.\n\n===Rapid heart rate===\nPresentation is similar to other forms of [[tachycardia|rapid heart rate]] and may be asymptomatic.<ref name=\"Gutierrez2011\">{{cite journal |vauthors = Gutierrez C, Blanchard DG |title = Atrial Fibrillation: Diagnosis and Treatment |journal = Am Fam Physician |volume = 83 |issue = 1 |pages = 61\u201368 |date = January 2011 |url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2011/0101/p61.html |type = Review |pmid = 21888129 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131224120005/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2011/0101/p61.html |archivedate = 24 December 2013 }}</ref> [[Palpitations]] and chest discomfort are common complaints.<ref name=\"Gutierrez2011\"/> The rapid uncoordinated heart rate may result in reduced [[cardiac output|output of blood pumped by the heart (cardiac output)]], resulting in inadequate blood flow, and therefore oxygen delivery to the rest of the body. Common symptoms of uncontrolled atrial fibrillation may include [[dyspnea|shortness of breath]],<ref name=\"Gutierrez2011\"/> [[orthopnea|shortness of breath when lying flat]], dizziness, and [[paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea|sudden onset of shortness of breath during the night]]. This may progress to [[peripheral edema|swelling of the lower extremities]], a manifestation of congestive heart failure. Due to inadequate cardiac output, individuals with AF may also complain of [[light-headedness]],<ref name=\"Gutierrez2011\"/> may feel like they are [[presyncope|about to faint]], or may [[Syncope (medicine)|lose consciousness]].\n\nAF can cause [[respiratory distress]] due to congestion in the lungs. By definition, the heart rate will be [[tachycardia|greater than 100 beats per minute]]. Blood pressure may be variable, and often difficult to measure as the beat-by-beat variability causes problems for most digital (oscillometric) [[Sphygmomanometer|non-invasive blood pressure]] monitors. For this reason, when determining the heart rate in AF, direct cardiac [[auscultation]] is recommended. [[Hypotension|Low blood pressure]] is most concerning, and a sign that immediate treatment is required. Many of the symptoms associated with uncontrolled atrial fibrillation are a manifestation of congestive heart failure due to the reduced cardiac output. The affected person's respiratory rate often increases in the presence of respiratory distress. Pulse oximetry may confirm the presence of [[Hypoxia (medical)|too little oxygen reaching the body's tissues]], related to any precipitating factors such as [[pneumonia]]. Examination of the [[jugular veins]] may reveal elevated [[jugular venous pressure|pressure]] (jugular venous distention). Examination of the lungs may reveal crackles, which are suggestive of [[pulmonary edema]]. Examination of the heart will reveal a rapid irregular rhythm.\n\n==Causes==\n[[File:RiskFactors.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|Non-modifiable [[risk factors]] (top left box) and modifiable risk factors (bottom left box) for atrial fibrillation.

These diseases are associated with an increased risk of AF due to their remodeling effects on the left atrium.<ref name=\"Staerk\" />\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nThe normal [[electrical conduction system of the heart]] allows the impulse that is generated by the [[sinoatrial node]] (SA node) of the heart to be propagated to and stimulate the [[myocardium]] (muscular layer of the heart). When the myocardium is stimulated, it contracts. It is the ordered stimulation of the myocardium that allows efficient contraction of the heart, thereby allowing blood to be pumped to the body.\n\nIn AF, the normal regular electrical impulses generated by the sinoatrial node in the [[right atrium]] of the heart are overwhelmed by disorganized electrical impulses, usually originating in the roots of the [[pulmonary veins]]. This leads to irregular conduction of [[ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] impulses that generate the heartbeat.\n\n===Pathology===\nThe primary pathologic change seen in atrial fibrillation is the progressive [[fibrosis]] of the atria. This fibrosis is due primarily to atrial dilation; however, genetic causes and inflammation may be factors in some individuals. Dilation of the atria can be due to almost any structural abnormality of the heart that can cause a rise in the pressure within the heart. This includes [[valvular heart disease]] (such as [[mitral stenosis]], [[mitral regurgitation]], and [[tricuspid regurgitation]]), hypertension, and congestive heart failure. Any inflammatory state that affects the heart can cause fibrosis of the atria. This is typically due to sarcoidosis but may also be due to autoimmune disorders that create autoantibodies against [[myosin]] heavy chains. Mutation of the ''[[lamin]] AC'' gene is also associated with fibrosis of the atria that can lead to atrial fibrillation.\n\nOnce dilation of the atria has occurred, this begins a chain of events that leads to the activation of the [[renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system]] (RAAS) and subsequent increase in matrix [[metalloproteinase]]s and [[disintegrin]], which leads to atrial remodeling and fibrosis, with loss of atrial muscle mass. This process occurs gradually, and experimental studies have revealed patchy atrial fibrosis may precede the occurrence of atrial fibrillation and may progress with prolonged durations of atrial fibrillation.\n\nFibrosis is not limited to the muscle mass of the atria and may occur in the [[sinus node]] (SA node) and [[atrioventricular node]] (AV node), correlating with [[sick sinus syndrome]]. Prolonged episodes of atrial fibrillation have been shown to correlate with prolongation of the sinus node recovery time;<ref name=AHA2006/> this suggests that dysfunction of the SA node is progressive with prolonged episodes of atrial fibrillation.\n\n===Electrophysiology===\n{| border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=\"3\" align=\"right\"\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#abcdef\" colspan=\"3\" | Conduction\n|-\n| <small>Sinus rhythm</small> [[File:Heart conduct sinus.gif|none|230px]]\n| <small>Atrial fibrillation</small> [[File:Heart conduct atrialfib.gif|none|230px]]\n|}\n\nThere are multiple theories about the cause of atrial fibrillation. An important theory is that, in atrial fibrillation, the regular impulses produced by the sinus node for a normal heartbeat are overwhelmed by rapid electrical discharges produced in the atria and adjacent parts of the [[pulmonary veins]]. Sources of these disturbances are either automatic foci, often localized at one of the pulmonary veins, or a small number of localized sources in the form of either a re-entrant leading circle or electrical spiral waves (rotors); these localized sources may be found in the left atrium near the pulmonary veins or a variety of other locations through both the left or right atrium. Three fundamental components favor the establishment of a leading circle or a rotor: slow conduction velocity of the [[cardiac action potential]], a short [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]], and a small [[wavelength]]. Meanwhile, the wavelength is the product of velocity and refractory period. If the action potential has fast conduction, with a long refractory period and/or conduction pathway shorter than the wavelength, an AF focus would not be established. In multiple wavelet theory, a wavefront will break into smaller daughter wavelets when encountering an obstacle, through a process called vortex shedding. But, under the proper conditions, such wavelets can reform and spin around a center, forming an AF focus.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Waks |first1 = Jonathan W |last2 = Josephson |first2 = Mark E |title = Mechanisms of Atrial Fibrillation \u2013 Reentry, Rotors and Reality |journal = Arrhythmia & Electrophysiology Review|date = August 2015 |volume = 3 |issue = 2 |pages = 90\u2013100 |doi = 10.15420/aer.2014.3.2.90 |pmc = 4711504 |pmid = 26835073 }}</ref>\n\nIn a heart with AF, the increased calcium release from the [[sarcoplasmic reticulum]] and increased calcium sensitivity can lead to an accumulation of intracellular calcium and causes downregulation of [[L-type calcium channel]]s. This reduces the duration of action potential and refractory period, thus favorable for the conduction of re-entrant waves. Increased expression of [[inward-rectifier potassium ion channel]]s can cause a reduced atrial refractory period and wavelength. The abnormal distribution of [[gap junction protein]]s such as [[GJA1]] (also known as Connexin 43), and [[GJA5]] (Connexin 40) causes non-uniformity of electrical conduction, thus causing the arrhythmia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Pellman |first1 = J |last2 = Sheikh |first2 = F |title = Atrial fibrillation: mechanisms, therapeutics, and future directions |journal = Comprehensive Physiology |date = April 2015 |volume = 5 |issue = 2 |doi = 10.1002/cphy.c140047 |pmc = 5240842 |pmid = 25880508 |pages = 649\u201365 }}</ref>\n\nAF can be distinguished from [[atrial flutter]] (AFL), which appears as an organized electrical circuit usually in the right atrium. AFL produces characteristic saw-toothed F-waves of constant amplitude and frequency on an [[electrocardiogram|ECG]], whereas AF does not. In AFL, the discharges circulate rapidly at a rate of 300&nbsp;beats per minute (bpm) around the atrium. In AF, there is no regularity of this kind, except at the sources where the local activation rate can exceed 500 bpm.  Although AF and atrial flutter are distinct arrhythmias, atrial flutter may degenerate into AF, and  an individual may experience both arrhythmias at different times.<ref name=Bun2015 />\n\nAlthough the electrical impulses of AF occur at a high rate, most of them do not result in a heartbeat. A heartbeat results when an electrical impulse from the atria passes through the [[Atrioventricular node|atrioventricular (AV) node]] to the ventricles and causes them to contract. During AF, if all of the impulses from the atria passed through the AV node, there would be severe [[ventricular tachycardia]], resulting in a severe reduction of [[cardiac output]]. This dangerous situation is prevented by the AV node since its limited conduction velocity reduces the rate at which impulses reach the ventricles during AF.<ref name='Klabunde2005'>{{cite book |last = Klabunde |first = Richard |title = Cardiovascular Physiology Concepts |publisher = Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |year = 2005 |location = |pages = 25, 28 |url = |doi = |id = |isbn = 9780781750301 }}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:RapidAFib150.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A 12-lead ECG showing atrial fibrillation at approximately 150 beats per minute]]\n[[Image:SinusRhythmLabels.svg|thumb|Diagram of [[normal sinus rhythm]] as seen on [[ECG]].

The goal of this evaluation is to determine the general treatment regimen for the individual. If the results of the general evaluation warrant it, further studies may then be performed.\n\n====History and physical examination====\nThe history of the individual's atrial fibrillation episodes is probably the most important part of the evaluation. Distinctions should be made between those who are entirely asymptomatic when they are in AF (in which case the AF is found as an incidental finding on an ECG or physical examination) and those who have gross and obvious symptoms due to AF and can pinpoint whenever they go into AF or revert to sinus rhythm.\n\n====Routine bloodwork====\nWhile many cases of AF have no definite cause, it may be the result of various other problems. Hence, [[kidney function]] and [[electrolyte]]s are routinely determined, as well as thyroid-stimulating hormone (commonly suppressed in [[hyperthyroidism]] and of relevance if [[amiodarone]] is administered for treatment) and a [[complete blood count|blood count]].<ref name=AHA2006/>\n\nIn acute-onset AF associated with [[chest pain]], [[troponin|cardiac troponins]], or other markers of damage to the heart muscle may be ordered.

Characteristic findings are the absence of P waves, with disorganized electrical activity in their place, and irregular R\u2013R intervals due to irregular conduction of impulses to the ventricles.<ref name=AHA2006/> At very fast heart rates, atrial fibrillation may look more regular, which may make it more difficult to separate from other [[supraventricular tachycardia]]s or [[ventricular tachycardia]].<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Issa |first1 = Ziad F. |last2 = Miller |first2 = John M. |last3 = Zipes |first3 = Douglas P. |name-list-format = vanc |title = Clinical arrhythmology and electrophysiology : a companion to Braunwald's heart disease |year = 2009 |publisher = Saunders |location = Philadelphia |isbn = 9781416059981 |page = 221 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=a8s8nd2JAiwC&pg=PA221 |url-status = live |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170908144250/https://books.google.com/books?id=a8s8nd2JAiwC&pg=PA221 |archivedate = 8 September 2017 }}</ref>\n\n[[QRS complex]]es should be narrow, signifying that they are initiated by normal conduction of atrial electrical activity through the [[electrical conduction system of the heart|intraventricular conduction system]]. Wide QRS complexes are worrisome for ventricular tachycardia, although, in cases where there is a disease of the conduction system, wide complexes may be present in A-fib with rapid ventricular response.\n\nIf paroxysmal AF is suspected, but an ECG during an office visit shows only a regular rhythm, AF episodes may be detected and documented with the use of ambulatory [[Holter monitor]]ing (e.g., for a day). If the episodes are too infrequent to be detected by Holter monitoring with reasonable probability, then the person can be monitored for longer periods (e.g., a month) with an ambulatory [[cardiac event monitor|event monitor]].<ref name=AHA2006/>\n\n====Echocardiography====\nIn general, a non-invasive transthoracic [[echocardiogram]] (TTE) is performed in newly diagnosed AF, as well as if there is a major change in the person's clinical state. This ultrasound-based scan of the heart may help identify [[valvular heart disease]] (which may greatly increase the risk of stroke and alter recommendations for the appropriate type of anticoagulation), left and right atrial size (which predicts the likelihood that AF may become permanent), left ventricular size and function, peak right ventricular pressure ([[pulmonary hypertension]]), presence of left atrial thrombus (low sensitivity), presence of left ventricular hypertrophy and pericardial disease.<ref name=AHA2006/>\n\nSignificant enlargement of both the left and right atria is associated with long-standing atrial fibrillation and, if noted at the initial presentation of atrial fibrillation, suggests that the atrial fibrillation is likely to be of a longer duration than the individual's symptoms.\n\n===Extended evaluation===\nIn general, an extended evaluation is not necessary for most individuals with atrial fibrillation and is performed only if abnormalities are noted in the limited evaluation, if a reversible cause of the atrial fibrillation is suggested, or if further evaluation may change the treatment course.\n\n====Chest X-ray====\nIn general, a [[chest X-ray]] is performed only if a pulmonary cause of atrial fibrillation is suggested, or if other cardiac conditions are suspected (in particular [[congestive heart failure]]). This may reveal an underlying problem in the lungs or the blood vessels in the chest.<ref name=AHA2006/> In particular, if an underlying pneumonia is suggested, then treatment of the pneumonia may cause the atrial fibrillation to terminate on its own.\n\n====Transesophageal echocardiogram====\nA regular echocardiogram ([[Transthoracic echocardiogram|transthoracic echo/TTE]]) has a low sensitivity for identifying [[thrombus|blood clots]] in the heart.

In individuals with symptoms of significant shortness of breath with exertion or palpitations regularly, a Holter monitor may be of benefit to determine whether rapid heart rates (or unusually slow heart rates) during atrial fibrillation are the cause of the symptoms.\n\n====Exercise stress testing====\nSome individuals with atrial fibrillation do well with normal activity but develop shortness of breath with exertion. It may be unclear whether the shortness of breath is due to a blunted heart rate response to exertion caused by excessive [[atrioventricular node]]-blocking agents, a very rapid heart rate during exertion, or other underlying conditions such as chronic lung disease or coronary ischemia. An [[cardiac stress test|exercise stress test]] will evaluate the individual's heart rate response to exertion and determine if the AV node blocking agents are contributing to the symptoms.\n\n===Classification===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style = \"float: right; margin-left:15px; text-align:center\"\n|+Classification system\n|-\n! width=\"100\"| AF category\n! width=\"350\"| Defining characteristics\n|-\n| &nbsp; First detected\n| &nbsp; only one diagnosed episode\n|-\n| &nbsp; Paroxysmal\n| &nbsp; recurrent episodes that stop on their own in less than seven days\n|-\n| &nbsp; Persistent\n| &nbsp; recurrent episodes that last more than seven days\n|-\n| &nbsp; Permanent\n| &nbsp; an ongoing long-term episode\n|-\n|}\n\nThe [[American College of Cardiology]] (ACC), [[American Heart Association]] (AHA), and the [[European Society of Cardiology]] (ESC) recommend in their guidelines the following classification system based on simplicity and clinical relevance.<ref name=AHA2006/>\n\nAll people with AF are initially in the category called ''first detected AF''.
