Note the discussion of this under 'history,' below.-->\n\nThe company was founded as '''Activision, Inc.''' in October 1979 in [[Sunnyvale, California]], by former [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]] game developers, upset at how they were treated at Atari, to develop their own games for the popular [[Atari 2600]] home video game console. Activision was the first independent, third-party, console video game developer. The [[1983 video game crash]], in part created by too many new companies trying to follow in Activision's footsteps without the expertise of Activision's founders, hurt Activision's position in console games, forcing them to diversify into games for home computers, including the acquisition of [[Infocom]]. After a management shift, with CEO [[Jim Levy]] replaced by [[Bruce Davis (video game industry)|Bruce Davis]], the company renamed itself as '''Mediagenic''' and branched out into business software applications. Mediagenic quickly fell into debt, and the company was bought for around {{USD|500,000}} by [[Bobby Kotick]] and a small group of investors around 1991.\n\nKotick instituted a full rework of the company to cover its debts: dismissing most of its staff, moving the company to Los Angeles, and reverting to the Activision name. Building on existing assets, the Kotick-led Activision pursued more publishing opportunities and, after recovering from the former debt, started acquiring numerous studios and [[intellectual properties]] over the 1990s and 2000s, among these being the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero (series)|Guitar Hero]]'' series. A [[holding company]] was formed as Activision's parent company to manage the internal and acquired studios. In 2008, this holding merged with [[Vivendi Games]] (the parent company of [[Blizzard Entertainment]]) and formed Activision Blizzard, with Kotick as its CEO.

While there was still a demand for Activision games, uneducated consumers were more drawn to the heavily-discounted titles instead, reducing their income.

Around 2006, Kotick contacted [[Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy]], the new CEO of [[Vivendi]], a French media conglomerate. Vivendi had a games division, [[Vivendi Games]], that was struggling to be viable at the time, but its principle feature was that it owned [[Blizzard Entertainment]] and its highly-successful ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' game, which was drawing in {{USD|1.1 billion}} a year in subscription fees. Vivendi Games also owned [[Sierra Entertainment]].<ref name=\"forbes kotick\" />\n\nL\u00e9vy recognized Kotick wanted control of ''World of Warcraft'', and offered to allow the companies to merge, but only if L\u00e9vy held the majority shares in the merged group, forcing Kotick to cede control. Kotick fretted about this decision for a while, according to friends and investors. During this time in 2006\u20132007, some of Activision's former successful properties began to wane, such as ''Tony Hawk's'', and Activision faced harsher competition from Electronic Arts, who had purchased Harmonix after Activision bought Red Octane as to develop ''[[Rock Band]]'', a competing title to ''Guitar Hero''.<ref name=\"forbes kotick\" /> Kotick met with Blizzard's president [[Mike Morhaime]], and learned that Blizzard also had a successful inroad into getting their games into China, a potentially lucrative market.

Note the discussion of this under 'history,' below.-->\n\nThe company was founded as '''Activision, Inc.''' in October 1979 in [[Sunnyvale, California]], by former [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]] game developers, upset at how they were treated at Atari, to develop their own games for the popular [[Atari 2600]] home video game console. Activision was the first independent, third-party, console video game developer. The [[1983 video game crash]], in part created by too many new companies trying to follow in Activision's footsteps without the expertise of Activision's founders, hurt Activision's position in console games, forcing them to diversify into games for home computers, including the acquisition of [[Infocom]]. After a management shift, with CEO [[Jim Levy]] replaced by [[Bruce Davis (video game industry)|Bruce Davis]], the company renamed itself as '''Mediagenic''' and branched out into business software applications. Mediagenic quickly fell into debt, and the company was bought for around {{USD|500,000}} by [[Bobby Kotick]] and a small group of investors around 1991.\n\nKotick instituted a full rework of the company to cover its debts: dismissing most of its staff, moving the company to Los Angeles, and reverting to the Activision name. Building on existing assets, the Kotick-led Activision pursued more publishing opportunities and, after recovering from the former debt, started acquiring numerous studios and [[intellectual properties]] over the 1990s and 2000s, among these being the ''[[Call of Duty]]'' and ''[[Guitar Hero (series)|Guitar Hero]]'' series. A [[holding company]] was formed as Activision's parent company to manage the internal and acquired studios. In 2008, this holding merged with [[Vivendi Games]] (the parent company of [[Blizzard Entertainment]]) and formed Activision Blizzard, with Kotick as its CEO. Within this structure, Activision serves to manage numerous third-party studios and publish all of the parent company's games outside of those created by Blizzard.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Founding (1979) ===\n[[File:David Crane (10453626776).jpg|thumb|left|Co-founder David Crane in 2013]]\nBy 1979, [[Nolan Bushnell]] had sold [[Atari, Inc.]] to [[Warner Communications]] and then left the company over several disagreements with the direction Warner wanted to take the company\u2014particularly with the popular [[Atari 2600]] game console (then known as the Atari Video Game Console or VCS).<ref>{{cite book |last=Ramsay |first=Morgan |year=2012 |title=Gamers at Work: Stories Behind the Games People Play |isbn=978-1430233510}}</ref> Bushnell's replacement as CEO, [[Ray Kassar]], showed little respect to developers, giving them no financial compensation for profitable games<ref>{{cite web |title=Classic Gaming Expo Distinguished Guest: ALAN MILLER |url=http://www.cgexpo.com/bios/amiller.htm |work=Classic Gaming Expo |publisher=CGE Services, Corp |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |year=1999\u20132010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208143935/http://www.cgexpo.com/bios/amiller.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2012}}</ref> and refusing them public credit for fear they would be recruited by other game companies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/easter-eggs-the-hidden-secrets-of-videogames.html |title=Easter Eggs: The Hidden Secrets of Videogames |first=Jack |last=Yarwood |work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |date=March 27, 2016 |accessdate=March 27, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330033934/http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/easter-eggs-the-hidden-secrets-of-videogames.html |archive-date=March 30, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[David Crane (programmer)|David Crane]], one of Atari's [[game programmer|programmers]], recalled a memo sent by Kassar that listed the best-selling cartridges from the previous year to help guide game ideas; Crane noted that the games he was fully responsible for had brought in over {{USD|20 million}} for the company but he was still only receiving a {{USD|20,000}} salary.<ref name=\"Gamasutra\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1537/the_history_of_activision.php?print=1 |title=The History Of Activision |work=Gamasutra |first=Jeffrey |last=Flemming |accessdate=December 30, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220122651/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1537/the_history_of_activision.php?print=1 |archivedate=December 20, 2016}}</ref> Crane, along with [[Larry Kaplan]], [[Alan Miller (game designer)|Alan Miller]] and [[Bob Whitehead]], became vocal about the lack of recognition within the company and became known as the \"Gang of Four\".<ref name=\"Gamasutra\" /> The group met with Kassar in May 1979 to demand that the company treat developers as [[record labels]] treated musicians, with royalties and their names on game boxes.

This was a contributing factor to the [[video game crash of 1983]].<ref name=\"Gamasutra\" /> For Activision, while they survived the crash, they felt its effects in the following years. These third-party developers folded, leaving warehouses full of unsold games, which savvy retailers purchased and sold at a mass discount ({{USD|5}} compared to Activision's {{USD|40}} [[manufacturer's suggested retail price]]). While there was still a demand for Activision games, uneducated consumers were more drawn to the heavily-discounted titles instead, reducing their income. Because of this, Activision decided that they needed to diversify their games onto home computers such as the [[Commodore 64]], [[Apple, Inc.|Apple]], and [[Atari 8-bit family]] to avoid a similar event.<ref name=\"Gamasutra\" /> There still was a drain of talent through 1985 from the crash.

Around 2006, Kotick contacted [[Jean-Bernard L\u00e9vy]], the new CEO of [[Vivendi]], a French media conglomerate. Vivendi had a games division, [[Vivendi Games]], that was struggling to be viable at the time, but its principle feature was that it owned [[Blizzard Entertainment]] and its highly-successful ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' game, which was drawing in {{USD|1.1 billion}} a year in subscription fees. Vivendi Games also owned [[Sierra Entertainment]].<ref name=\"forbes kotick\" />\n\nL\u00e9vy recognized Kotick wanted control of ''World of Warcraft'', and offered to allow the companies to merge, but only if L\u00e9vy held the majority shares in the merged group, forcing Kotick to cede control. Kotick fretted about this decision for a while, according to friends and investors. During this time in 2006\u20132007, some of Activision's former successful properties began to wane, such as ''Tony Hawk's'', and Activision faced harsher competition from Electronic Arts, who had purchased Harmonix after Activision bought Red Octane as to develop ''[[Rock Band]]'', a competing title to ''Guitar Hero''.<ref name=\"forbes kotick\" /> Kotick met with Blizzard's president [[Mike Morhaime]], and learned that Blizzard also had a successful inroad into getting their games into China, a potentially lucrative market. Given this potential opportunity, Kotick agreed to the merger.<ref name=\"forbes kotick\" />\n\nActivision's board signed onto the merger by December 2007.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vivendi To Merge With Activision |url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/12/02/vivendi-computer-guitar-tech-media-cx_rr_1202activision.html |work=Forbes |publisher=Forbes.com LLC |accessdate=August 22, 2012 |first=Rachel |last=Rosmarin |date=December 2, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620012647/http://www.forbes.com/2007/12/02/vivendi-computer-guitar-tech-media-cx_rr_1202activision.html |archivedate=June 20, 2013}}</ref> The merger was completed in July 2008.

Formed earlier in 2009 by [[Glen Schofield]] and [[Michael Condrey]], former [[Visceral Games]] leads that had worked on ''[[Dead Space (series)|Dead Space]]'', Sledgehammer intended to develop a ''Call of Duty'' spin-off title fashioned after the gameplay in ''Dead Space''. However, in early 2010, [[Infinity Ward#2010 employee firings and departures|legal issues between Infinity Ward and Activision Blizzard]] led to several members of Infinity Ward leaving, and Activision assigned Sledgehammer to assist Infinity Ward in the next major ''Call of Duty'' title, ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3|Modern Warfare 3]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Flemming |first=Ryan |title=Inside Sledgehammer Games and the Biggest Gamble You Never Knew About |url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/inside-sledgehammer-games-and-the-biggest-gamble-you-never-heard-of/ |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |newspaper=Digital Trends |date=February 16, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221063229/http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/inside-sledgehammer-games-and-the-biggest-gamble-you-never-heard-of/ |archive-date=February 21, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> Since then, Sledgehammer, Infinity Ward, and Treyarch share development duties for the flagship series, with support from Raven and other studios as necessary.\n\nIn February 2010, Activision Blizzard reported significant losses in revenue stemming from a slow down in ''Guitar Hero'' sales and from its more casual games.

The [[Chief Constable]] is answerable to the [[Scottish Police Authority]], and the force is inspected by [[Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland]].\n\nScotland is also policed by the [[Ministry of Defence Police]], [[British Transport Police]] and the [[Civil Nuclear Constabulary]] within their respective jurisdictions. Both the [[Metropolitan Police]] and [[National Crime Agency]] also have some jurisdiction in Scotland.  In regards to the Metropolitan Police this is due to their national responsibilities in regards to the protection of the Royal Family and other protected persons, such as the Prime Minister.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/16/section/99/data.htm|title=Police Act 1996|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2019-08-24}}</ref> \n\n==History==\n\n===Prior to merger===\nAfter a consultation process,<ref>{{cite web|title=Keeping Scotland Safe and Strong: A Consultation on Reforming Police and Fire and Rescue Services in Scotland|date=15 September 2011|url=http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2011/09/15110325/0|publisher=Scottish Government|accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Keeping Scotland Safe and Strong: A Consultation on Reforming Police and Fire and Rescue Services in Scotland \u2013 Research Findings|date=16 December 2011|url=http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2011/12/15130636/0|publisher=Scottish Government|accessdate=24 April 2015}}</ref> the [[Scottish Government]] confirmed on 8 September 2011 that a single police service would be created in Scotland.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Single police and fire services|date=8 September 2011|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2011/09/08142643 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/3011/20130202143701/http://scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2011/09/08142643 |archivedate=2 February 2013|publisher=Scottish Government}}</ref> The Scottish Government stated that \"reform will safeguard frontline policing in communities by creating designated local senior officers for every council area with a statutory duty to work with councils to shape local services.

The Special Branches' primary role is to gather intelligence on terrorist operations and all terrorist related incidents, when the special branch obtains any intelligence they shall pass on the information to the security service (MI5) or the service / agency appropirate to the current situation. The Special Branch also gathers intelligence on political and animal rights extremist activity, and any environmental extremism. In addition the Special Branch provides personal protection to VIPs or certain individuals who may be vulnerable to potential terror attacks or other types of attacks. The special branch works very closely with the Secret Intelligence Service ([[MI6]]), The Security Service ([[MI5]]), and many police forces in the UK.\n\n====Organised Crime and Counter Terrorism Unit====\n\nPolice Scotland has limited responsibilities when it comes down to counter terrorism, with the [[Metropolitan Police]] being the main force behind counter terrorism operations throughout the UK. However, the SCD does have counter-terrorism in its remit, and relies on daily support from several UK agencies, including [[MI5]] and the [[Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism]] at the [[Home Office]].\n\n====Major Investigation Teams====\n\nMajor Investigation Teams (MITs) are located throughout Scotland and are responsible for leading the investigation of all murder inquiries and large-scale and complex criminal investigations. Although each MIT will be responsible for investigating cases within its own area, where required they will be able to be deployed anywhere in the country to respond to need and demand.<ref name=scd>{{cite web|title=Specialist Crime Division|url=http://www.scotland.police.uk/about-us/police-scotland/specialist crime-division/|publisher=Police Scotland|accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n====National Counter Corruption Unit====\n\nThe National Counter Corruption Unit is the first of its kind in UK policing and works in partnership with the public sector to prevent corruption in publicly funded organisations. The unit also offers a specialist investigative capability. The unit is split into two teams, one focused internally within Police Scotland whilst a second team focuses on other publicly funded organisations.<ref name=ccr-oct13 />\n\n====National Human Trafficking Unit====\n\nThe existing Scottish Intelligence Coordination Unit and Strathclyde Police Vice and Trafficking Unit combined on 1 April 2013 to form the new National Human Trafficking Unit (NHTU).<ref name=\"SPA_PBM_Mar13\"/>\n\n====National Rape Taskforce====\n\nThe investigation of rape and other sexual offences is a key priority for Police Scotland. National Rape Taskforce units are located in Glasgow and Aberdeen and work alongside Divisional Rape Investigation Units. They provide a national investigative capacity and a case review function.<ref name=\"scd\"/><ref name=ccr-oct13>{{cite web|title=Chief Constables Report 2nd October 2013|url=http://www.spa.police.uk/assets/126884/188888/item11|work=Public Board Meeting|publisher=Scottish Police Authority|accessdate=10 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Prison Intelligence Unit====\n\nThe Prison Intelligence Unit (PIU) provides an interface for the exchange of information and intelligence between Police Scotland and the [[Scottish Prison Service]]. The unit also develops and supports policy, procedure, planning, research, technology development, advice and communication between Police Scotland and the Scottish Prison Service.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chief Constables Report 30th October 2013|url=http://www.spa.police.uk/assets/126884/192814/item10|work=Public Board Meeting|publisher=Scottish Police Authority|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Licensing and Violence Reduction Division===\nThe Licensing and Violence Reduction Division (LVRD) contains a number of miscellaneous functions including the titular alcohol licensing and violence reduction teams.\n\nOne of the higher-profile units within the LVRD is the Domestic Abuse Task Force (DATF).  The DATF has a presence in each of the command areas as DATF (West), DATF (East) and DATF (North).  The DATF (North) is unique amongst the three in having sub-offices in N Division (Highlands and Islands), A Division (North-East) and D Division (Tayside). The DATF has national responsibility for pro-actively addressing domestic abuse.  Its divisional equivalents are the Domestic Abuse Investigation Units.\n\nAnother unit within the division is the Force Flexible Policing Unit (FFPU, or \"Flexi Teams\" as they are known locally), based in all three command areas (North, East, West). This unit's primary function is to act upon specific geographical intelligence relating to spikes in crime trends (particularly involving violence, alcohol, antisocial behaviour or other high volume crime), and carrying out taskings in the form of high visibility patrols and public reassurance.\n\n===Operational Support Division===\n\n====Roads Policing====\n\nPolicing of Scotland's roads network is the responsibility of the Roads Policing Unit. The unit is split into three areas, west, east and north which cover their respective Local Police Divisions.  The departments aim is to achieve casualty reduction and wider operational objectives. There are roughly 500 road policing officers in Scotland, Chief Superintendent Stewart Carle is currently the head of roads policing.<ref name=SPA_PBM_Mar13>{{cite web|title=Statement of Operational Readiness Day 1|url=http://www.spa.police.uk/assets/126884/140136/item08-policescotlandopreadiness|work=Public Board Meeting|publisher=Scottish Police Authority|accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref>\nThe Collision Investigation unit sits within Road Policing division. Unlike many other forces, there is no dedicated Collision Investigation. Instead investigating serious and fatal RTCs lies with specially trained officers who carry out the role beside their core road patrol functions.\n\n====Operational Support Unit====\n\nSix operational support units (OSUs) have been established to provide specially skilled officers trained in over ground search, [[Riot control|public order]] and [[CBRN defense|chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear]] (CBRN) response. When not used in their specialist roles OSU officers are deployed in local communities focusing on issues as directed by demand. OSUs are based in Aberdeen, Inverness and Dundee (North), Edinburgh and Alloa (East) and Glasgow (West). Across the force area the OSU comprises a total of 6 Inspectors, 18 Sergeants and 172 Constables.<ref name=\"SPA_PBM_AUG13\">{{cite web|title=PSOS Paper \u2013 OSU Paper|url=http://www.spa.police.uk/meetings-events/board-meetings/178259/|work=Public Board Meeting 21st August 2013|publisher=Scottish Police Authority|accessdate=25 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Armed Policing====\nArmed Policing provides [[Armed Response Vehicle]]s (ARV), the Specialist Firearms Unit and Armed Policing Training.\n\nPrior to the inception of Police Scotland, the routine tasking and visibility of ARV officers varied widely across Scotland with deployment models varying for matters such as if officers carried side arms with a standing authority or if they were secured in the vehicles. The operational functions and cover of the ARV's also varied including if they could be tasked for routine incidents and one legacy force did not have a regular ARV patrol.<ref name=\"HMICSfirearms\">{{cite book|author1=Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland|title=Review of Standing Firearms Authority for Armed Response Vehicle Crews within Police Scotland|date=October 2014|isbn=9781910165102|url=http://www.hmics.org/sites/default/files/publications/HMICS%20-%20Review%20of%20Standing%20Firearms%20Authority%20for%20Armed%20Response%20Vehicle%20Crews%20within%20Police%20Scotland.pdf|accessdate=28 May 2017}}</ref> Police Scotland introduced ARV patrols in all 13 local policing divisions in Scotland with 275 dedicated officers.<ref name=\"ARVmay2014\" /><ref name=\"HMICSfirearms\" /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Rose|first1=Gareth|title=Armed police to patrol all of Scotland|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/armed-police-to-patrol-all-of-scotland-1-2704945|accessdate=28 May 2017|work=The Scotsman|date=23 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"JusticeSecretary2016\" /> ARV officers carry a X26 or X2 [[Taser]], a [[Glock 17L|Glock 17]] handgun and a [[Heckler & Koch G36]] carbine.<ref name=\"BBCFirearms\" /><ref name=\"HMICSfirearms\" /> Former Chief Constable Sir [[Stephen House]]'s founding policy decision was that ARV officers would be granted a standing authority to overtly carry their sidearm and, in addition, controversially allowed ARV's to be able to respond to routine incidents (non-firearms incidents) \"to provide support to local policing through regular and tasked patrols\".<ref name=\"HMICSfirearms\" /><ref name=\"ARVmay2014\">{{cite press release|title=Assistant Chief Constable outlines armed policing policy|url=http://www.scotland.police.uk/whats-happening/news/2014/may/229392/|website=Police Scotland|accessdate=29 May 2017|date=19 May 2014}}</ref> This policy was made without proper consultation provoking both political and public debate.<ref name=\"HMICSfirearms\" /> In October 2014, the policy was changed so that an ARV can only be tasked to an incident involving firearms or a threat to life.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Review of firearms officer deployments announced as public protection put first|url=http://www.scotland.police.uk/whats-happening/news/2014/october/review-of-firearms-officer-deployments-announced|website=Police Scotland|accessdate=28 May 2017|date=1 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"JusticeSecretary2016\" />\n\nThe Specialist Firearms Unit (formerly the Tactical Firearms Unit), which was inherited from [[Strathclyde Police]], consists of [[Specialist Firearms Officer]]s (SFO) and [[Counter Terrorist Specialist Firearms Officer]]s (CTSFO), who form part of the [[United Kingdom]] [[Counter Terrorist Specialist Firearms Officer#CTSFO Network|CTSFO Network]], and are equipped with the\n[[SIG MCX]] carbine.<ref name=\"HMICSfirearms\" /><ref name=\"BBCFirearms\">{{cite news|last1=Buttle|first1=Cameron|title=Scotland to increase armed police numbers|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36547739|accessdate=28 May 2017|work=BBC News|date=16 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2016, it was announced there would be an additional 124 armed officers, of these, 90 officers would be dedicated to armed response vehicles and 34 would be trainers and specialist firearms officers, bringing the total number of armed officers to 365.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Security and safety enhanced through armed response increase|url=http://www.scotland.police.uk/whats-happening/news/2016/june/securitysafetyenhanced|website=Police Scotland|accessdate=28 May 2017|date=16 June 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"JusticeSecretary2016\">{{cite press release|title=Statement on policing and security - Parliamentary speech by Justice Secretary Michael Matheson|url=https://news.gov.scot/speeches-and-briefings/statement-on-policing-and-security|website=Scottish Government|accessdate=28 May 2017|date=6 June 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"BBCFirearms\" />\n\n====Dog Branch====\n\nThe Dog Branch comprises 75 [[police dog]] handlers located throughout Scotland.

Also included in the local resource figures are officers within the divisional Criminal Investigation Department and Public Protection Units.''\n\n===Specialist Crime Division===\nThe Specialist Crime Division (SCD) provides access to national investigative and intelligence resources for matters relating to major crime, organised crime, counter terrorism, intelligence, covert policing and public protection.<ref name=\"SPA_PBM_Mar13\"/> SCD comprises more than 2000 officers and targets individuals that pose the most significant threat to communities.<ref name=FOIOct13>{{cite web|last=WhatDoTheyKnow?|title=Freedom of Information Request|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/support_for_independence#incoming-444496|publisher=Police Scotland|accessdate=30 October 2013|date=October 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Border Policing Command====\n \nOfficers from Border Policing Command operate in the major airports in Scotland and undertake examinations and searches of passengers under the [[Terrorism Act 2000]].<ref name=FOIOct13 />\n\n====Special Branch====\n\nThe Special Branch - note that \"special branch\" is not the official term used by Police Scotland - is a covert branch. The Special Branches' primary role is to gather intelligence on terrorist operations and all terrorist related incidents, when the special branch obtains any intelligence they shall pass on the information to the security service (MI5) or the service / agency appropirate to the current situation. The Special Branch also gathers intelligence on political and animal rights extremist activity, and any environmental extremism. In addition the Special Branch provides personal protection to VIPs or certain individuals who may be vulnerable to potential terror attacks or other types of attacks. The special branch works very closely with the Secret Intelligence Service ([[MI6]]), The Security Service ([[MI5]]), and many police forces in the UK.\n\n====Organised Crime and Counter Terrorism Unit====\n\nPolice Scotland has limited responsibilities when it comes down to counter terrorism, with the [[Metropolitan Police]] being the main force behind counter terrorism operations throughout the UK. However, the SCD does have counter-terrorism in its remit, and relies on daily support from several UK agencies, including [[MI5]] and the [[Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism]] at the [[Home Office]].\n\n====Major Investigation Teams====\n\nMajor Investigation Teams (MITs) are located throughout Scotland and are responsible for leading the investigation of all murder inquiries and large-scale and complex criminal investigations. Although each MIT will be responsible for investigating cases within its own area, where required they will be able to be deployed anywhere in the country to respond to need and demand.<ref name=scd>{{cite web|title=Specialist Crime Division|url=http://www.scotland.police.uk/about-us/police-scotland/specialist crime-division/|publisher=Police Scotland|accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n====National Counter Corruption Unit====\n\nThe National Counter Corruption Unit is the first of its kind in UK policing and works in partnership with the public sector to prevent corruption in publicly funded organisations. The unit also offers a specialist investigative capability. The unit is split into two teams, one focused internally within Police Scotland whilst a second team focuses on other publicly funded organisations.<ref name=ccr-oct13 />\n\n====National Human Trafficking Unit====\n\nThe existing Scottish Intelligence Coordination Unit and Strathclyde Police Vice and Trafficking Unit combined on 1 April 2013 to form the new National Human Trafficking Unit (NHTU).<ref name=\"SPA_PBM_Mar13\"/>\n\n====National Rape Taskforce====\n\nThe investigation of rape and other sexual offences is a key priority for Police Scotland. National Rape Taskforce units are located in Glasgow and Aberdeen and work alongside Divisional Rape Investigation Units. They provide a national investigative capacity and a case review function.<ref name=\"scd\"/><ref name=ccr-oct13>{{cite web|title=Chief Constables Report 2nd October 2013|url=http://www.spa.police.uk/assets/126884/188888/item11|work=Public Board Meeting|publisher=Scottish Police Authority|accessdate=10 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Prison Intelligence Unit====\n\nThe Prison Intelligence Unit (PIU) provides an interface for the exchange of information and intelligence between Police Scotland and the [[Scottish Prison Service]]. The unit also develops and supports policy, procedure, planning, research, technology development, advice and communication between Police Scotland and the Scottish Prison Service.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chief Constables Report 30th October 2013|url=http://www.spa.police.uk/assets/126884/192814/item10|work=Public Board Meeting|publisher=Scottish Police Authority|accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Licensing and Violence Reduction Division===\nThe Licensing and Violence Reduction Division (LVRD) contains a number of miscellaneous functions including the titular alcohol licensing and violence reduction teams.\n\nOne of the higher-profile units within the LVRD is the Domestic Abuse Task Force (DATF).  The DATF has a presence in each of the command areas as DATF (West), DATF (East) and DATF (North).  The DATF (North) is unique amongst the three in having sub-offices in N Division (Highlands and Islands), A Division (North-East) and D Division (Tayside). The DATF has national responsibility for pro-actively addressing domestic abuse.  Its divisional equivalents are the Domestic Abuse Investigation Units.\n\nAnother unit within the division is the Force Flexible Policing Unit (FFPU, or \"Flexi Teams\" as they are known locally), based in all three command areas (North, East, West). This unit's primary function is to act upon specific geographical intelligence relating to spikes in crime trends (particularly involving violence, alcohol, antisocial behaviour or other high volume crime), and carrying out taskings in the form of high visibility patrols and public reassurance.\n\n===Operational Support Division===\n\n====Roads Policing====\n\nPolicing of Scotland's roads network is the responsibility of the Roads Policing Unit. The unit is split into three areas, west, east and north which cover their respective Local Police Divisions.  The departments aim is to achieve casualty reduction and wider operational objectives. There are roughly 500 road policing officers in Scotland, Chief Superintendent Stewart Carle is currently the head of roads policing.<ref name=SPA_PBM_Mar13>{{cite web|title=Statement of Operational Readiness Day 1|url=http://www.spa.police.uk/assets/126884/140136/item08-policescotlandopreadiness|work=Public Board Meeting|publisher=Scottish Police Authority|accessdate=26 September 2013}}</ref>\nThe Collision Investigation unit sits within Road Policing division. Unlike many other forces, there is no dedicated Collision Investigation. Instead investigating serious and fatal RTCs lies with specially trained officers who carry out the role beside their core road patrol functions.\n\n====Operational Support Unit====\n\nSix operational support units (OSUs) have been established to provide specially skilled officers trained in over ground search, [[Riot control|public order]] and [[CBRN defense|chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear]] (CBRN) response. When not used in their specialist roles OSU officers are deployed in local communities focusing on issues as directed by demand. OSUs are based in Aberdeen, Inverness and Dundee (North), Edinburgh and Alloa (East) and Glasgow (West). Across the force area the OSU comprises a total of 6 Inspectors, 18 Sergeants and 172 Constables.<ref name=\"SPA_PBM_AUG13\">{{cite web|title=PSOS Paper \u2013 OSU Paper|url=http://www.spa.police.uk/meetings-events/board-meetings/178259/|work=Public Board Meeting 21st August 2013|publisher=Scottish Police Authority|accessdate=25 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Armed Policing====\nArmed Policing provides [[Armed Response Vehicle]]s (ARV), the Specialist Firearms Unit and Armed Policing Training.\n\nPrior to the inception of Police Scotland, the routine tasking and visibility of ARV officers varied widely across Scotland with deployment models varying for matters such as if officers carried side arms with a standing authority or if they were secured in the vehicles.

With the Scotland Act 2016, the Scottish Parliament is now responsible for policing of railways in Scotland.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-36353498 |title=Holyrood gains new powers under Scotland Act 2016 |date=23 May 2016}}</ref> In August 2016, the Scottish Government announced that their programme for the coming year would include a Railway Policing Bill which would provide primary legislation for the full integration of the functions of British Transport Police in Scotland into Police Scotland and initiated an extensive consultation on the matter.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/police-scotland-to-merge-with-british-transport-police-1-4223713 |title=Police Scotland to merge with British Transport Police |work=The Scotsman |date=7 September 2016 |accessdate=27 September 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Justice/policies/police-fire-rescue/police-scotland/BTP British Transport Police, Scottish Government. retrieved 22 March 2017.]</ref> However, the proposal has received criticism due to the potential impact that it would have on the BTP and the future of it in the rest of Britain as a force,<ref>http://www.pfoa.co.uk/3/latest-news-events/article/451/national-armed-rapid-response</ref> as too the continued specialist nature of railway policing should the merger go ahead. The merger became possible after the responsibility for policing of railways in Scotland was devolved following a recommendation by the Smith Commission and its later inclusion in draft legislation, with the UK Government stating \"how rail transport is policed in Scotland will be a matter for Scotland once the legislation is passed\".\nIn 2017, the Railway Policing (Scotland) Bill was passed and the bill received Royal Assent, however in August 2018, the integration of railway policing in Scotland has been suspended amid concerns over Police Scotland officers and railway unions about the merge.{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n\nIt has been announced that a specialist \"Rail Policing Unit\" will be created within Police Scotland. This unit will sit alongside the Roads Policing Unit with offices receiving specialist training for dealing with rail incidents.\n\nOther proposals backed by the Scottish Government include merging the [[Civil Nuclear Constabulary]] (CNC) and [[Ministry of Defence Police]] (MDP)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.policeoracle.com/news/uniformed_operations/2017/Apr/05/civil-nuclear-constabulary-would-be-better-as-part-of-police-scotland_94552.html|title=Civil Nuclear Constabulary would be better as part of Police Scotland - UK Police News - Police Oracle|website=www.policeoracle.com|accessdate=12 August 2017}}</ref> into Police Scotland if further devolution over these areas is delivered to Holyrood.\n\n==Controversy==\nIn May 2015, Sheku Boyah died after being arrested by nine police officers whilst under the influence of drugs.

Her boyfriend John Yuile also died.<ref name=m9crash/>\n\nIn 2016, Police Scotland undertook a trial of so-called 'cyber-kiosks' for analysing the contents of mobile phones.

A path from the main village street will lead you in to flat pastureland. Head for the small rocky hill ahead of you and climb over it. On the other side is another flat area, rather thickly covered in thorn trees. It is worth finding a way through them to the dam that straddles the gap between the two nearby hills. The dam is an impressive edifice 50&nbsp;m wide and 7&nbsp;m high built from accurately hewn quartzite blocks.---There is a passage for the egress of water at the level of the ground on the dammed side. The flat land across which you have walked is clearly caused by centuries of silt deposits in the lake that once existed behind this dam. The land around has been vwey heavily quarried recently, so further archaeological finds are unlikely.}}</ref><ref name=anag>{{Citation |url=http://www.indiainfoweb.com/haryana/lakes/anagpur-dam.html |title=Anangpur Dam |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125185110/http://www.indiainfoweb.com/haryana/lakes/anagpur-dam.html |archive-date=25 November 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n=== Recreation ===\nFaridabad and various shopping malls including SRS Mall in Sector 12, Crown Interiorz Mall in Sector 37, Crown Plaza in Sector 15 A, Parasnath Mall along with several others.

The school opened on 5 September 1964 at a rented building owned by the Philippine Government Employees Association along Elliptical Road, Diliman, Quezon City. It was only in 1970 that the school moved to its present campus along Agham Road, Diliman, Quezon City.  In 1997, the PSHS System Law (R.A. 8496) was signed by President Fidel V. Ramos. It established the PSHS System and unified all the existing campuses into a single system of governance and management. In 2001, the PSHS System Law was further amended by R.A. No. 9036 consolidating the power and authority over all PSHS System campuses into a single Board of Trustees to ensure uniform policy coordination, standards and management.\n\n===SOCCSKSARGEN Region Campus===\nPSHS-SRC was founded on '''February 3, 2012''' by virtue of '''BOT Resolution No. 2012-02-04''' to ensure optimum distribution of opportunities for Science & Technology-gifted in Region XII and neighboring areas. The campus formally opened on '''June 17, 2013''' with a pioneering batch consisting 52 Filipino scholars. Since 2013 to present, SRC has been under the tutelage of Dr. Chuchi P. Garganera, Campus Director.\n\n==Admission==\nGrade 6 students who belong to the top 10% of the class or must have special aptitude in Science & Mathematics must take and perform well in the '''NCE''', the admission test of the Philippine Science High School System, also indicating their interest in the SOCCSKSARGEN Region Campus.\n\n===National Competitive Examination===\nAdmission to the PSHS System is through the PSHS System National Competitive Examination (PSHS-NCE). The screening consists of tests in Verbal, Abstract Reasoning, Science and Mathematics. To be eligible for admission, applicants must be Filipino students who must belong to the top 10% of the graduating class or must have special aptitude in science and math. The top 90 scholars from the region are admitted as scholars.\n\n===Lateral Admissions Qualifying Examination===\n\nA student who has finished Grade 7 / Grade 8 (under the high school curriculum or the new K-12 curriculum) outside of the PSHS System may be allowed admission/entry to the PSHS by passing the Lateral Admissions Qualifying Examination. It annually occurs during summer before the new Academic School year starts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Philippine.Science.High.School.System/photos/a.1656265191275219.1073741828.1641038776131194/1759578804277190/?type=3&theater}}</ref>\n\n==Administration==\n\n[[File:SRC-Administration.png|thumb|upright=2.4|this is the administration of PSHS-SRC]]\n\n===Board of Trustees===\nThe Board of Trustees is the highest policy-making body of the PSHS System.

It was first established by the PSHS-SRC pioneering batch of 2019 to help support and facilitate scholars\u2019 activities related to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, which also helps PSHS-SRC in promoting STEM inside and outside the campus.\n\nPRISM is headed by scholars elected from the student body to primarily organize the said activities. Any scholar who meets the eligibility requirements stipulated in the PRISM Constitution-and-by-Laws are automatically nominated to take an officership position under PRISM.\n\n===Alternative Learning Activities (ALA)===\n\n* '''Young Inventors' Club'''\n* '''The Environmentalists' Club'''\n* '''Sports Club'''\n* '''Book Lovers' Club'''\n* '''Art Club'''\n* '''Public Speakers' Guild'''\n* '''Math Club'''\n* '''Weave Club'''\n* '''Performing Arts Club''' (Music, Dance, Theatre Club)\n\n===The Tunog System===\nIn order to develop the bond and unity among scholars, the PSHS-SRC implemented the 'Tunog' System which is set to anchor any school activity this school year 2014-2015. The implementation of this system aims for six (6) aspects: Academic mentoring; Peer counseling to provide emotional support; Monitoring of overall student performances; Sports events for leisure and physical fitness; Musical, theatrical and cultural events and promotion; and, Maintenance of cleanliness and orderliness.\n\nThe system consists of six tunog which includes:\n# Debakandabest\n# Agong\n# Kudyapi\n# Gangza\n# Kulintang\n# Kubing'''\nEach tunog is composed of members from the students, faculty, and staff led by the Datu, Wai\u00edr and Raja Tagasulat. The names were derived from the balangay system of the first settlers in the Philippines to reflect patriotism in the Filipinos' cultural ways and to live out the core values of the Philippine Science High School System. \"The main purposes of the tunog system are to enhance the social interaction between the teachers and the students of different grade levels and to help every student in each tunog with their academic studies. I hope that it will fully prosper for years and will effectively serve its purpose,\" said Jhona Cresila Quezada, the schools' Student Services Division chief.<ref>Fornan, Glydel. (2014, June\u2013November). Tunog System rings for scholars. Pisay Scholar, p. A2.</ref>\n\nSince School Year 2016-2017, the Tunog System is no longer being used. The penultimate of the capabilities of the scholars are limitless.\n\n===School Publications===\n\nThe school annually produces two publications that allows the scholars the optimum opportunity to express their thoughts and opinions freely. '''THE TWELFTH QUILL''' is the PSHS-SRC's official publication in English. '''PISAY PLUMA''', on the other hand, is the official publication in Filipino. Both publications provide a good training ground for scholars in the field of journalism as reporting, layout, design, editing, and final production are done by the students under the supervision of a faculty adviser.\n\n===Science and Humanities & Sports Festival===\n\nThe school annually holds its own version of intramural named '''''Science and Humanities & Sports Festival'''''. The said event is an event where all students get to finally showcase their talents, skills, and abilities. The reigning champion of the event is Batch 2020, the present Grade 10.\n\n==Student Services and Facilities==\nAs true to its mission and vision, the campus is also equipped with certain facilities to provide its scholars the welfare and development they need when they are in school.\n\n===Residence Halls===\nThere are two dormitories in the vicinity of the campus, namely Girls\u2019 Residence Hall and Boys' Residence Hall. These dormitories offer accommodations for the nation\u2019s scholars from all over SOCCSKSARGEN and some neighboring areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mc.pshs.edu.ph/campus-life/student-services/dormitories/|title=Residence Halls}}</ref>\n\n===Library===\n===Guidance Center===\n===Clinic=== \nPSHS-SRC has its own clinic where students can go  if they have injuries, medical concerns, or if they need medicine. Student's health records are also kept in the clinic. The \"pisay\" smc clinic also has a nurse to help students when they need assistance.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Philippine Science High Schools}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:SOCCSKSARGEN Region Campus}}\n[[Category:Philippine Science High School System]]\n[[Category:Schools in South Cotabato]]\n[[Category:Education in Koronadal]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2014}}\n{{Infobox school \n| name                = Philippine Science High School - SOCCSKSARGEN Region Campus\n| native_name         = \n| motto               = \"Weaving the Culture of Science, Mathematics, and Technology in SOCCSKSARGEN\" \n| logo                = [[File:PSHS System Logo.png|100px]]\n| image               = [[File:PSHS-SRC Acad 2.jpg|300px]]\n| caption             = Academic Building 2\n| type                = [[Public school (government funded)|Public]] Specialized High School\n| established         = February 3, 2012\n| opened              = June 17, 2013 \n| streetaddress       = Brgy.

The student's current standing for a subject is calculated by adding 1/3 of the previous quarter's grade and 2/3 of the tentative grade of the quarter. The general weighted average (GWA) of the student should be 2.25 or better to be in good standing.\n\n====Stanine====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Grade\n! Percentage Range\n! Equivalent Range\n!

It was first established by the PSHS-SRC pioneering batch of 2019 to help support and facilitate scholars\u2019 activities related to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, which also helps PSHS-SRC in promoting STEM inside and outside the campus.\n\nPRISM is headed by scholars elected from the student body to primarily organize the said activities. Any scholar who meets the eligibility requirements stipulated in the PRISM Constitution-and-by-Laws are automatically nominated to take an officership position under PRISM.\n\n===Alternative Learning Activities (ALA)===\n\n* '''Young Inventors' Club'''\n* '''The Environmentalists' Club'''\n* '''Sports Club'''\n* '''Book Lovers' Club'''\n* '''Art Club'''\n* '''Public Speakers' Guild'''\n* '''Math Club'''\n* '''Weave Club'''\n* '''Performing Arts Club''' (Music, Dance, Theatre Club)\n\n===The Tunog System===\nIn order to develop the bond and unity among scholars, the PSHS-SRC implemented the 'Tunog' System which is set to anchor any school activity this school year 2014-2015. The implementation of this system aims for six (6) aspects: Academic mentoring; Peer counseling to provide emotional support; Monitoring of overall student performances; Sports events for leisure and physical fitness; Musical, theatrical and cultural events and promotion; and, Maintenance of cleanliness and orderliness.\n\nThe system consists of six tunog which includes:\n# Debakandabest\n# Agong\n# Kudyapi\n# Gangza\n# Kulintang\n# Kubing'''\nEach tunog is composed of members from the students, faculty, and staff led by the Datu, Wai\u00edr and Raja Tagasulat. The names were derived from the balangay system of the first settlers in the Philippines to reflect patriotism in the Filipinos' cultural ways and to live out the core values of the Philippine Science High School System. \"The main purposes of the tunog system are to enhance the social interaction between the teachers and the students of different grade levels and to help every student in each tunog with their academic studies. I hope that it will fully prosper for years and will effectively serve its purpose,\" said Jhona Cresila Quezada, the schools' Student Services Division chief.<ref>Fornan, Glydel. (2014, June\u2013November). Tunog System rings for scholars. Pisay Scholar, p. A2.</ref>\n\nSince School Year 2016-2017, the Tunog System is no longer being used. The penultimate of the capabilities of the scholars are limitless.\n\n===School Publications===\n\nThe school annually produces two publications that allows the scholars the optimum opportunity to express their thoughts and opinions freely. '''THE TWELFTH QUILL''' is the PSHS-SRC's official publication in English. '''PISAY PLUMA''', on the other hand, is the official publication in Filipino. Both publications provide a good training ground for scholars in the field of journalism as reporting, layout, design, editing, and final production are done by the students under the supervision of a faculty adviser.\n\n===Science and Humanities & Sports Festival===\n\nThe school annually holds its own version of intramural named '''''Science and Humanities & Sports Festival'''''. The said event is an event where all students get to finally showcase their talents, skills, and abilities. The reigning champion of the event is Batch 2020, the present Grade 10.\n\n==Student Services and Facilities==\nAs true to its mission and vision, the campus is also equipped with certain facilities to provide its scholars the welfare and development they need when they are in school.\n\n===Residence Halls===\nThere are two dormitories in the vicinity of the campus, namely Girls\u2019 Residence Hall and Boys' Residence Hall. These dormitories offer accommodations for the nation\u2019s scholars from all over SOCCSKSARGEN and some neighboring areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mc.pshs.edu.ph/campus-life/student-services/dormitories/|title=Residence Halls}}</ref>\n\n===Library===\n===Guidance Center===\n===Clinic=== \nPSHS-SRC has its own clinic where students can go  if they have injuries, medical concerns, or if they need medicine. Student's health records are also kept in the clinic. The \"pisay\" smc clinic also has a nurse to help students when they need assistance.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Philippine Science High Schools}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:SOCCSKSARGEN Region Campus}}\n[[Category:Philippine Science High School System]]\n[[Category:Schools in South Cotabato]]\n[[Category:Education in Koronadal]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toNarra(link changed toPterocarpus) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Science_High_School_SOCCSKSARGEN_Region_Campus"}

{"title_page": "Syledis", "text_new": "'''Syledis''' ('''SY'''stem '''LE'''ger pour mesure la '''DIS'''tance) was a terrestrial [[radio navigation]] and locating system. The system operated in the [[UHF]] segment of 420-450 MHz. It was manufactured in France by Sercel S.A. and was operational during the 1980s and until about 1995, providing positioning and navigational support for the petroleum sector in the [[North Sea]] and to other scientific projects. Syledis has been replaced by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]].\n\n==Functioning==\nDetermination of the position of mobile vehicles, like f.e.

There are two modes of operation, ''active range mode'' and ''passive pseudo-range mode''.\n\n===Further explanation of the functioning of the Syledis positioning system===\nA vessel is equipped with a transmitter that transmits a coded signal to at least three [[Electric beacon|radio beacons]] each placed at a known point. The beacons send the code back to the transmitter. The returned coded signal is placed in a [[timeslot]] to determine the origin of the returned code. Therefore, in an earlier stage a specified timeslot is connected to a specific beacon.\n\nThe elapsed time is proportional to twice the distance between the transmitter and the beacons.

If selected from the main menu, the Randomizer will randomly choose and start one game from the 52 available on the cartridge. The fifty-second game, ''Challenge'', is an endurance test to see how long the player lasts in a random series of the highest levels of the other games.\n\n== Development ==\nLittle is known about Vince Perri, the creator of ''Action 52''. Perri claims to be a businessman from [[Miami]], [[Florida]] and the owner and founder of [[Active Enterprises]]. He also explains that the breakthrough came by accident: \"I happened to see my son playing an illegal product made in [[Taiwan]] that had 40 games on it. The whole neighborhood went crazy over it\", Perri said. \"I figured I'd do it legally. It's obvious when you see something like that, you know there's something there\".<ref name=mimhe>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100506061008/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5487678_ITM Video Creator Plays 52 Games to Win]\". ''[[The Miami Herald]]''.</ref> In 1993, he showcased ''Action 52'' at the [[Consumer Electronics Show|International Winter Consumer Electronics Show]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&p_theme=aasb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAD91978A7B82C7&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Cartridge has 52 video games |date=1993-01-30 |newspaper=[[Austin American-Statesman]]}}</ref>\n\nFor the NES version, Perri raised $20 million from private backers in Europe, South America and Saudi Arabia. He and Ra\u00fal Gomila employed three college students (Mario Gonz\u00e1lez, Javier P\u00e9rez and Albert Hern\u00e1ndez) to do the game design, music, graphics and programming on an [[Atari ST]], with a three-month deadline and little playtesting or bug fixing done. Technical work was contracted out to Cronos Engineering, Inc., a [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]] company that had done work for [[IBM]].<ref name=mimhe/> According to Gonz\u00e1lez, the game has been misrepresented as a \"scam\" in the gaming press; he clarifies that Perri never intended for the game to be a scam, at least at first, and believed it was a genuinely good business venture after seeing his neighborhood become entranced by his son's Taiwanese multicart. However, it was Perri's overconfidence and lack of gaming business savvy that led to the project's downfall, by hiring inexperienced programmers and giving them such a short deadline without knowing how long games typically took to make, and thinking such a poor-quality product would be able to make him rich via the ''Cheetahmen'' franchise.\n\n''Action 52'' has eight extra game templates, since the distributor had the carts come with 60 games by default, as well as many unused [[Tile-based video game|tiles]]; this has been confirmed in an interview with Gonz\u00e1lez. Also, according to Gonz\u00e1lez, the development team was flown to Sculptured Software to develop the game. While Mario does not remember the name of the game company, he recalls them both being based in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the company was developing an NES adaptation of ''[[The Empire Strikes Back|Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back]]''. This, along with the game using Sculptured Software's sound engine, proves that the game was developed at Sculptured Software, but not by Sculptured Software staff.\n\nSeveral of the songs from the NES version of ''Action 52'' were [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] from example tunes included in Activision's ''The Music Studio'' for the [[Atari ST]]. The games with plagiarized music include ''Fuzz Power'', ''Silver Sword'', ''French Baker'', ''Streemerz'', ''Time Warp Tickers'' and ''Ninja Assault''. Those songs were composed by [[Ed Bogas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/all_comments?v=PGQAhV8Ga1k|title=YouTube Video demonstrating matching songs from \"The Music Studio\" and \"Action 52\"|date=2009-02-12}}{{unreliable source?|date=June 2014}}</ref> Additionally, programmer Kevin Horton analyzed the music code of ''Action 52'' and found that it matched a music engine programmed by [[Sculptured Software]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nesdev.parodius.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7626|title=Post on NESDev forums by Kevin Horton|date=2011-04-05}}{{unreliable source?|date=June 2014}}</ref> featured in all of their NES games.\n\nThe Sega Genesis version, released two years later, was developed by [[FarSight Studios|FarSight Technologies]] on a [[Macintosh LC]] over the course of a year, under the direction of [[Jay Obernolte]].<ref name=\"Cheetahmen Corner\">{{cite web |url=http://cheetahmen.silius.net/obernolte.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423092507/http://cheetahmen.silius.net/obernolte.html |archivedate=2009-04-23 |title=Jay Obernolte Interview |year=2003 |author1=Harris, Andrew |author2=Allwein, Dave |work=Cheetahmen Corner |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref> This version contained far fewer glitches than the NES version, due to FarSight having experienced programmers and pressuring Active into playtesting the game before release. P\u00e9rez and Hern\u00e1ndez were again involved in the development of this version but Gonz\u00e1lez had departed from the team at this point to spend more time with his girlfriend, whom he eventually married. Music for this version was contracted out to Mark Steven Miller and Jason Scher of Nu Romantic Productions, which was composed within 48 hours. FarSight was also set to develop a version of ''Action 52'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], as well as another multicart titled ''Sports 5'', but Active Enterprises withdrew from the video game industry shortly thereafter, and no copies of either game are known to exist.\n\n== Prototypes ==\nThere are two know variations of \"Action 52\" prototypes known to have been produced. Prototype I (earliest) featured a blue colored circuit board in a clear cartridge with a sold blue colored label and did not have the \"Active Enterprises\" embossed on the rear. The second, prototype II, featured a black circuit board and clear, transparent, label; and did include the \"Active Enterprises\" embossing. It is unknown how many units of prototype II were made or still exit but is believed to be more than prototype I. The final, released, version of ''Action 52'' for the NES featured a clear cartridge with a green circuit board and transparent label with the \"Active Enterprises\" embossing.<ref name=\"The Video Game Museum\">{{cite web |url=http://www.videogamemuseum.com/2010/06/17/whats-rarer-a-prototype-action-52-cart-or-a-person-who-met-vince-perri/ |title=What's Rarer: A Prototype Action 52 Cart or a Person Who Met Vince Perri? |publisher=The Video Game Museum}}</ref> In 2010, a prototype I cartridge of ''Action 52'' surfaced, owned by movie and video games distributor Greg Pabich.<ref name=\"The Video Game Museum\"/> Originally, Vince Perri had proposed a deal with Pabich asking him if he would be interested in working for Active Enterprises as a business partner. At this time, Perri only had a few prototype cartridges and not the final product. For various reasons, Pabich turned down the offer, but not before leaving with one of the prototype I's in his possession, which was stored in his warehouse for over twenty years before it was \"rediscovered\".\n\nThe prototypes contain numerous differences from the final ''Action 52'' cartridges. They contain minor text differences for the game titles as well as different color backgrounds for the game selection menus. The final version contains the words \"Action 52\" in its header and copyright information in its footer. The prototypes simply contain section numbers in each menu screen's header. The code for ''Action 52'' appears to be heavily based upon the pirate multicart ''52 in 1''. This is evident from the menu template in the ''Action 52'' prototypes being identical to that of ''52 in 1''. However, the biggest difference between the prototypes and the final game is that the final version contains the game ''Cheetahmen'', whereas the prototypes do not. In its place is a completely different ''Cheetahmen'' game titled \"Action Gamer\" (presumably taken from the name of the main character, the Action Gamemaster, in Cheetahmen). Action Gamer features only two levels, one of which is incomplete.\n\nAfter Vince Perri insisted on the inclusion of his \"Cheetahmen\" in the final version of the game the \"Action Gamer\" levels were re-worked and renamed to ultimately become the 5th game on the cartridge titled \"Ooze\", the same title which, as was promoted, that if an individual player were to beat that title they would be entered to win a prize of US$104,000 ($52,000 cash & $52,000 scholarship).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.videogamemuseum.com/2010/06/24/the-evolution-of-the-action-52/ |title=The Evolution of Action 52 |publisher=The Video Game Museum}}</ref>\n\nOn November 11, 2011, Greg Pabich publicly released reproductions of ''Action Gamer'', calling it \"Cheetahmen: The Creation\". This was achieved by stripping the ROM data from one of the original prototype I cartridges and completing the game coding.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cheetahmen/cheetahmen-ii-the-lost-levels |title=Cheetahmen Campaign |publisher=Greg Pabich}}</ref> This special package contains a sealed version of the game for collectors, an unsealed copy, a reproduction of the original ''Cheetahmen'' comic book, a ''Cheetahmen'' music CD, special edition T-shirts, and a poster.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.videogamemuseum.com/2011/10/21/cheetahmen-fever/ |title=Cheetahmen Fever! |publisher=The Video Game Museum}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2012, one of the four original ''Action 52'' developers surfaced, presenting their original boxed ''Action 52'' NES prototype I cartridge, one of only two prototype I's known to exist.

Those songs were composed by [[Ed Bogas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/all_comments?v=PGQAhV8Ga1k|title=YouTube Video demonstrating matching songs from \"The Music Studio\" and \"Action 52\"|date=2009-02-12}}{{unreliable source?|date=June 2014}}</ref> Additionally, programmer Kevin Horton analyzed the music code of ''Action 52'' and found that it matched a music engine programmed by [[Sculptured Software]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nesdev.parodius.com/bbs/viewtopic.php?t=7626|title=Post on NESDev forums by Kevin Horton|date=2011-04-05}}{{unreliable source?|date=June 2014}}</ref> featured in all of their NES games.\n\nThe Sega Genesis version, released two years later, was developed by [[FarSight Studios|FarSight Technologies]] on a [[Macintosh LC]] over the course of a year, under the direction of [[Jay Obernolte]].<ref name=\"Cheetahmen Corner\">{{cite web |url=http://cheetahmen.silius.net/obernolte.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423092507/http://cheetahmen.silius.net/obernolte.html |archivedate=2009-04-23 |title=Jay Obernolte Interview |year=2003 |author1=Harris, Andrew |author2=Allwein, Dave |work=Cheetahmen Corner |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref> This version contained far fewer glitches than the NES version, due to FarSight having experienced programmers and pressuring Active into playtesting the game before release. P\u00e9rez and Hern\u00e1ndez were again involved in the development of this version but Gonz\u00e1lez had departed from the team at this point to spend more time with his girlfriend, whom he eventually married. Music for this version was contracted out to Mark Steven Miller and Jason Scher of Nu Romantic Productions, which was composed within 48 hours. FarSight was also set to develop a version of ''Action 52'' for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], as well as another multicart titled ''Sports 5'', but Active Enterprises withdrew from the video game industry shortly thereafter, and no copies of either game are known to exist.\n\n== Prototypes ==\nThere are two know variations of \"Action 52\" prototypes known to have been produced. Prototype I (earliest) featured a blue colored circuit board in a clear cartridge with a sold blue colored label and did not have the \"Active Enterprises\" embossed on the rear. The second, prototype II, featured a black circuit board and clear, transparent, label; and did include the \"Active Enterprises\" embossing. It is unknown how many units of prototype II were made or still exit but is believed to be more than prototype I. The final, released, version of ''Action 52'' for the NES featured a clear cartridge with a green circuit board and transparent label with the \"Active Enterprises\" embossing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.videogamemuseum.com/2010/06/17/whats-rarer-a-prototype-action-52-cart-or-a-person-who-met-vince-perri/ |title=What's Rarer: A Prototype Action 52 Cart or a Person Who Met Vince Perri? |publisher=The Video Game Museum}}</ref> In 2010, a prototype I cartridge of ''Action 52'' surfaced, owned by movie and video games distributor Greg Pabich.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.videogamemuseum.com/2010/06/17/whats-rarer-a-prototype-action-52-cart-or-a-person-who-met-vince-perri/ |title=What's Rarer: A Prototype Action 52 Cart or a Person Who Met Vince Perri? |publisher=The Video Game Museum}}</ref> Originally, Vince Perri had proposed a deal with Pabich asking him if he would be interested in working for Active Enterprises as a business partner. At this time, Perri only had a few prototype cartridges and not the final product. For various reasons, Pabich turned down the offer, but not before leaving with one of the prototype I's in his possession, which was stored in his warehouse for over twenty years before it was \"rediscovered\".\n\nThe prototypes contain numerous differences from the final ''Action 52'' cartridges. They contain minor text differences for the game titles as well as different color backgrounds for the game selection menus. The final version contains the words \"Action 52\" in its header and copyright information in its footer. The prototypes simply contain section numbers in each menu screen's header. The code for ''Action 52'' appears to be heavily based upon the pirate multicart ''52 in 1''. This is evident from the menu template in the ''Action 52'' prototypes being identical to that of ''52 in 1''. However, the biggest difference between the prototypes and the final game is that the final version contains the game ''Cheetahmen'', whereas the prototypes do not. In its place is a completely different ''Cheetahmen'' game titled \"Action Gamer\" (presumably taken from the name of the main character, the Action Gamemaster, in Cheetahmen). Action Gamer features only two levels, one of which is incomplete. \n\nAfter Vince Perri insisted on the inclusion of his \"Cheetahmen\" in the final version of the game the \"Action Gamer\" levels were re-worked and re-named to ultimately become the 5th game on the cartridge titled \"Ooze\", the same title which, as was promoted, that if an individual player were to beat that title they would be entered to win a prize of $104,000 USD ($52,000 cash & $52,000 scholarship). <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.videogamemuseum.com/2010/06/24/the-evolution-of-the-action-52/ |title=The Evolution of Action 52 |publisher=The Video Game Museum}}</ref>\n\nOn November 11, 2011, Greg Pabich publicly released reproductions of ''Action Gamer'', calling it \"Cheetahmen: The Creation\". This was achieved by stripping the ROM data from one of the original prototype I cartridges and completing the game coding. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cheetahmen/cheetahmen-ii-the-lost-levels |title=Cheetahmen Campaign |publisher=Greg Pabich}}</ref> This special package contains a sealed version of the game for collectors, an unsealed copy, a reproduction of the original ''Cheetahmen'' comic book, a ''Cheetahmen'' music CD, special edition T-shirts, and a poster.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.videogamemuseum.com/2011/10/21/cheetahmen-fever/ |title=Cheetahmen Fever! |publisher=The Video Game Museum}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2012, one of the four original ''Action 52'' developers surfaced, presenting their original boxed ''Action 52'' NES prototype I cartridge, one of only two prototype I's known to exist.

Making her first appearance in ''[[Mortal Kombat 3]]'' (1995), she is of the multilimbed Shokan species from the otherworldly realm of Outworld, like [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]] and [[Kintaro (Mortal Kombat character)|Kintaro]]. She has served as the personal protector of Outworld emperor [[Shao Kahn]]'s queen, [[Sindel]], while harboring a bitter hatred for [[Motaro]], who is of the Shokan's sworn enemies, the Centaurians. In the 2011 [[Mortal Kombat (2011 game)|reboot]], her role in the storyline is that of Kahn's [[bodyguard]] and [[Prison officer|jailer]], holding [[Sonya Blade]] and [[Kitana]] captive on separate occasions.\n\nCreated as a stop motion-animated figurine like Goro and Kintaro, Sheeva was added into the ''MK'' (Mortal Kombat) series due to fan requests for a playable version of Goro. However, out of all the characters from the first generation of games, she has featured the least in the overall series continuity to date, only appearing as a playable in two additional titles after ''MK3'' and its upgrades (''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat Trilogy]]'') in addition to small roles in alternative ''Mortal Kombat''-related media, while appearing on no official merchandise. Reception to the character has been mixed in terms of her presence in the series and her finishing moves.\n\nHer name comes from the one true almighty [[Shiva]], the four-handed deity who is the one true god; the only difference is that Shiva is male and obviously the almighty and non comparable with anyone one in with world... Har Har Mahadev...\n\n==Appearances==\n===In video games===\nSheeva belongs to the ancient race of the Shokan, described as a subterranean people living in Outworld. Like all of her race, she possesses a tall, muscular build, red eyes, four arms with three fingers on each totaling 12 fingers, and two toes on each foot, however special to her only is the horns on her head. When [[Shao Kahn]] resurrected Sindel as the first step in his invasion of earth, he appointed Sheeva to be her personal protector. Sheeva became distrustful, however, when Kahn appointed the centaur [[Motaro]] to lead his Extermination Squads into battle. She saw this as an insult, as the Shokan and Centaurs have long been mortal enemies. She served the emperor in Earthrealm, but when she returned to Outworld, she was shocked to learn that Shao Kahn had betrayed the Shokans, and had launched an offensive against them. She joins her fellow Shokans in fighting Kahn\u2019s warriors. The Shokans are far outnumbered, and cannot hope to win, but when Shao Kahn is defeated by Earth\u2019s warriors and recalls his troops from all fronts, Sheeva takes this opportunity to get revenge on her nemesis, Motaro. Days later, she learns that Motaro has nursed his Earthrealm ally, Kano, back to health. Although Motaro had rescued Kano, it was merely to imprison him so he could later face the wrath of Shao Kahn for his failure to defeat Sonya. He gets imprisoned. Some time later, Sheeva arrives to the palace. The Shokan warrior kills Motaro outside of Kano's cell. She was on her way to assassinate Shao Kahn as well when Kano offered his assistance if Sheeva let him out of his cage. Kano and Sheeva proceeded to the throne room of Shao Kahn. When they arrived at the door, Kano suggested that he go in first to distract the Emperor. Kano would give the signal for Sheeva to enter and slay the preoccupied Shao Kahn. But Kano betrayed Sheeva and informed Shao Kahn of her assassination plot. When Kano called her in, Shao Kahn thrust a sword through her chest from behind.\n\nIn ''[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]]'' it is possible that Sheeva has escaped from the Netherealm some how, this is unknown how though as it was never confirmed. In ''Armegeddon's'' Konquest mode, Sheeva is seen in the Netherealm along with [[Kintaro (Mortal Kombat)|Kintaro]], [[Havik]], and a legion of demons all apparently working in an attempt to overthrow [[Shinnok]]'s rule at his spire. However, Shinnok later reveals that they were only apparitions created as a test for [[Taven]], thus making it clear that it was not the real Sheeva. In Sheeva's ''Armageddon'' ending, she defeats [[Blaze (Mortal Kombat)|Blaze]] and is met by the Elder Gods. She becomes the Goddess of Destruction, destroying realms using a Kamidogu; she then recreates the realms however she sees fit, but exactly what they are remade into is never revealed.<ref name=\"MKAend\">[http://mortalkombatwarehouse.com/mka/sheeva/ Sheeva's ''Armageddon'' info] at Mortal Kombat Warehouse.</ref>\n\nSheeva also appears in ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|Mortal Kombat 2011]]''. In the Story Mode, she is Shao Kahn's bodyguard, also serving as a jailer when Sonya and later Kitana are held captive, and must be fought several times by the characters the Story Mode focuses on. She is last seen defeated by Kabal in the streets of New York City after he escapes from Outworld. Despite this, she does not appear in ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]''.  In her noncanonical ending, she goes to Raiden for help in protecting her people from the loyal followers of Shao Kahn, fearing that the Shokan will be targets over her defeat of the emperor.  The Elder God shows her mercy and relocates her and her people to Earthrealm, where they make the continent of [[Australia]] their new home, and it is there that Sheeva becomes their new ruler.\n\nSheeva returns as an NPC ally of the heroes in ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]''. She is first seen when the past iteration of Kitana tries to convince her to aid Kotal Kahn against the returned Shao Kahn. Sheeva, however, is hesitant to get involved unless there is a real chance of victory. To that end, she states that she will join only if Baraka and his Tarkatans can be persuaded to join as well. After Kitana achieves this, Sheeva accompanies her in storming the Koliseum to prevent Kotal's execution. Later, Sheeva becomes one of Kitana's primary lieutenants after  the now-crippled Kotal appoints her the new Kahn. To that end, she joins the alliance for the final battle against Kronika's army in the Netherrealm, holding off Kronika's remaining armies while Liu Kang, Kung Lao, and Kitana proceed to Kronika's time chamber.\n\n====Design and gameplay====\nSheeva, whose name was derived from [[Shiva]], a Hindu deity of destruction, was introduced into the series due to fan requests for a playable version of [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]].<ref name=\"MKABioCard\">Sheeva's Bio Card. ''Mortal Kombat: Armageddon Premium Edition'' Bonus Disc, Midway Games, 2006.</ref> She was not included among the selectable fighters in the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] and [[Sega Genesis]] version of ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'' due to memory constraints, though she appeared as a glitch character in the SNES version of ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]''.  Sheeva's blood was green in ''MK3'' through ''[[Mortal Kombat Trilogy]]'' (although if this was done simply because she was a Shokan, it made little sense, seeing as both Goro and Kintaro had red blood in previous games). She was the first character to have this particular blood color (not counting the censored Japanese version of ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'', in which all characters had green blood). Her blood color was changed to red in ''Armageddon''.\n\nUntil the release of ''MK: Armageddon'', Sheeva had not appeared as a playable character since ''MK Trilogy'', nor did she have had any substantial cameos; only her corpse was found in the Netherealm in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Konquest mode and is seen running through the graveyard in the game's Krypt, in which almost all ''MK'' characters had cameos. Her fate after ''MK Trilogy'' was revealed in the text from ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Konquest mode. In ''Armageddon'''s arcade mode, Sheeva sometimes appeared as a sub-boss before the final fight with Blaze. She is the only Shokan character that can perform aerial combos, and the only Shokan character that can be thrown by normal characters in the game. While she has Goro's offensive moves, she is female so that she would be smaller in size and therefore the same height as the other fighters.\n\n===In other media===\nSheeva appears in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]],'' played by [[Marjean Holden]]. The [[shooting script]] included a lengthy fight scene with [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] that was omitted during filming; instead, she was simply crushed by a falling cage in Kahn's throne room. Her only action sequence was a brief quarrel with Motaro, though the film did acknowledge that she was once Sindel's personal protector. In a 2001 interview with fansite Total Mortal Kombat, Holden expressed her displeasure at the filmmakers' treatment of her character. In the [[shooting script]] and novelization, Sheeva met her demise in an extensive fight scene with newly mortal Raiden, but the scene was never filmed and her screen time was scant in the finished print, with Raiden instead fighting two Raptors and Sheeva's death simply coming from a falling cage. \"Here was a character, that was one of the most popular [in] the video game...and they killed her without even so much as a fight! Something I was not happy about at all. That was one of the reasons I wanted to do the role, was for the sheer fact that there were really great fights in the movie for this character, and they all got cut out.\"<ref name=\"tmk\">[http://www.totalmortalkombat.com/cast/interviews/index.php?action=interview&interview_id=2 Interview with: Marjean Holden] - Total Mortal Kombat, 2/4/01</ref>\n\nSheeva has a small role in the animated series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm]]'', in which she harbored a long-standing animosity toward Raiden. She was voiced by [[Dawnn Lewis]].\n\nIn the 2015 ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'' prequel comic miniseries produced by [[DC Comics]], Sheeva is crowned by Kintaro as the current leader of the Shokan in a peaceful treaty with Kotal Kahn, following the death of previous rule King Gorbak. Sheeva mourned Kintaro's death when a possessed [[Sonya Blade]] killed him in battle.\n\n==Reception==\nReception of the character has been mixed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sheevafanclub.wordpress.com/|title=Sheeva Fan Club|website=Sheeva Fan Club|language=en|access-date=2018-12-30}}</ref> ''SuperGamePower'' gave her their anti-awards for the ugliest female character of both 1996 and 1997.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1997|title=Os melhores do videogame|url=|journal=SuperGamePower|volume=38|pages=15|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1998|title=II Oscar do videogame|url=|journal=SuperGamePowe|volume=50|pages=11|via=}}</ref> In 2011, [[Wirtualna Polska]] featured her among the top ten villainesses in gaming, as \"an attraction for connoisseurs of unusual beauty and even more unusual quantities of the various parts of the body.\"<ref>[http://gry.wp.pl/galeria/10-najseksowniejszych-negatywnych-bohaterek,179679/10.html Sheeva \u2013 Mortal Kombat - 10 najseksowniejszych negatywnych bohaterek - Imperium gier - WP.PL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321150440/http://gry.wp.pl/galeria/10-najseksowniejszych-negatywnych-bohaterek,179679/10.html |date=2012-03-21 }} {{in lang|pl}}</ref> In 2012, [[UGO.com]] ranked her as the 28th top ''Mortal Kombat'' character.<ref>{{cite web |author=UGO Team |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/mortal-kombat-characters-sheeva |title=Sheeva - Top 50 Mortal Kombat Characters |publisher=UGO.com |date=2012-02-28 |accessdate=2012-10-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316074322/http://www.ugo.com/games/mortal-kombat-characters-sheeva |archivedate=2013-03-16 }}</ref> Sheeva ranked 36th on a 2013 fan poll hosted by Dorkly that rated the entire series roster.

She has served as the personal protector of Outworld emperor [[Shao Kahn]]'s queen, [[Sindel]], while harboring a bitter hatred for [[Motaro]], who is of the Shokan's sworn enemies, the Centaurians. In the 2011 [[Mortal Kombat (2011 game)|reboot]], her role in the storyline is that of Kahn's [[bodyguard]] and [[Prison officer|jailer]], holding [[Sonya Blade]] and [[Kitana]] captive on separate occasions.\n\nCreated as a stop motion-animated figurine like Goro and Kintaro, Sheeva was added into the ''MK'' (Mortal Kombat) series due to fan requests for a playable version of Goro. However, out of all the characters from the first generation of games, she has featured the least in the overall series continuity to date, only appearing as a playable in two additional titles after ''MK3'' and its upgrades (''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat Trilogy]]'') in addition to small roles in alternative ''Mortal Kombat''-related media, while appearing on no official merchandise. Reception to the character has been mixed in terms of her presence in the series and her finishing moves.\n\nHer name comes from [[Shiva]], the four-handed Indian deity; the only difference is that Shiva is male.\n\n==Appearances==\n===In video games===\nSheeva belongs to the ancient race of the Shokan, described as a subterranean people living in Outworld. Like all of her race, she possesses a tall, muscular build, red eyes, four arms with three fingers on each totaling 12 fingers, and two toes on each foot, however special to her only is the horns on her head. When [[Shao Kahn]] resurrected Sindel as the first step in his invasion of earth, he appointed Sheeva to be her personal protector. Sheeva became distrustful, however, when Kahn appointed the centaur [[Motaro]] to lead his Extermination Squads into battle. She saw this as an insult, as the Shokan and Centaurs have long been mortal enemies. She served the emperor in Earthrealm, but when she returned to Outworld, she was shocked to learn that Shao Kahn had betrayed the Shokans, and had launched an offensive against them. She joins her fellow Shokans in fighting Kahn\u2019s warriors. The Shokans are far outnumbered, and cannot hope to win, but when Shao Kahn is defeated by Earth\u2019s warriors and recalls his troops from all fronts, Sheeva takes this opportunity to get revenge on her nemesis, Motaro. Days later, she learns that Motaro has nursed his Earthrealm ally, Kano, back to health. Although Motaro had rescued Kano, it was merely to imprison him so he could later face the wrath of Shao Kahn for his failure to defeat Sonya. He gets imprisoned. Some time later, Sheeva arrives to the palace. The Shokan warrior kills Motaro outside of Kano's cell. She was on her way to assassinate Shao Kahn as well when Kano offered his assistance if Sheeva let him out of his cage. Kano and Sheeva proceeded to the throne room of Shao Kahn. When they arrived at the door, Kano suggested that he go in first to distract the Emperor. Kano would give the signal for Sheeva to enter and slay the preoccupied Shao Kahn. But Kano betrayed Sheeva and informed Shao Kahn of her assassination plot. When Kano called her in, Shao Kahn thrust a sword through her chest from behind.\n\nIn ''[[Mortal Kombat: Armageddon]]'' it is possible that Sheeva has escaped from the Netherealm some how, this is unknown how though as it was never confirmed. In ''Armegeddon's'' Konquest mode, Sheeva is seen in the Netherealm along with [[Kintaro (Mortal Kombat)|Kintaro]], [[Havik]], and a legion of demons all apparently working in an attempt to overthrow [[Shinnok]]'s rule at his spire. However, Shinnok later reveals that they were only apparitions created as a test for [[Taven]], thus making it clear that it was not the real Sheeva. In Sheeva's ''Armageddon'' ending, she defeats [[Blaze (Mortal Kombat)|Blaze]] and is met by the Elder Gods. She becomes the Goddess of Destruction, destroying realms using a Kamidogu; she then recreates the realms however she sees fit, but exactly what they are remade into is never revealed.<ref name=\"MKAend\">[http://mortalkombatwarehouse.com/mka/sheeva/ Sheeva's ''Armageddon'' info] at Mortal Kombat Warehouse.</ref>\n\nSheeva also appears in ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|Mortal Kombat 2011]]''. In the Story Mode, she is Shao Kahn's bodyguard, also serving as a jailer when Sonya and later Kitana are held captive, and must be fought several times by the characters the Story Mode focuses on. She is last seen defeated by Kabal in the streets of New York City after he escapes from Outworld. Despite this, she does not appear in ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]''.  In her noncanonical ending, she goes to Raiden for help in protecting her people from the loyal followers of Shao Kahn, fearing that the Shokan will be targets over her defeat of the emperor.  The Elder God shows her mercy and relocates her and her people to Earthrealm, where they make the continent of [[Australia]] their new home, and it is there that Sheeva becomes their new ruler.\n\nSheeva returns as an NPC ally of the heroes in ''[[Mortal Kombat 11]]''. She is first seen when the past iteration of Kitana tries to convince her to aid Kotal Kahn against the returned Shao Kahn. Sheeva, however, is hesitant to get involved unless there is a real chance of victory. To that end, she states that she will join only if Baraka and his Tarkatans can be persuaded to join as well. After Kitana achieves this, Sheeva accompanies her in storming the Koliseum to prevent Kotal's execution. Later, Sheeva becomes one of Kitana's primary lieutenants after  the now-crippled Kotal appoints her the new Kahn. To that end, she joins the alliance for the final battle against Kronika's army in the Netherrealm, holding off Kronika's remaining armies while Liu Kang, Kung Lao, and Kitana proceed to Kronika's time chamber.\n\n====Design and gameplay====\nSheeva, whose name was derived from [[Shiva]], a Hindu deity of destruction, was introduced into the series due to fan requests for a playable version of [[Goro (Mortal Kombat)|Goro]].<ref name=\"MKABioCard\">Sheeva's Bio Card. ''Mortal Kombat: Armageddon Premium Edition'' Bonus Disc, Midway Games, 2006.</ref> She was not included among the selectable fighters in the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] and [[Sega Genesis]] version of ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'' due to memory constraints, though she appeared as a glitch character in the SNES version of ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]''.  Sheeva's blood was green in ''MK3'' through ''[[Mortal Kombat Trilogy]]'' (although if this was done simply because she was a Shokan, it made little sense, seeing as both Goro and Kintaro had red blood in previous games). She was the first character to have this particular blood color (not counting the censored Japanese version of ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'', in which all characters had green blood). Her blood color was changed to red in ''Armageddon''.\n\nUntil the release of ''MK: Armageddon'', Sheeva had not appeared as a playable character since ''MK Trilogy'', nor did she have had any substantial cameos; only her corpse was found in the Netherealm in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deception]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Konquest mode and is seen running through the graveyard in the game's Krypt, in which almost all ''MK'' characters had cameos. Her fate after ''MK Trilogy'' was revealed in the text from ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Konquest mode. In ''Armageddon'''s arcade mode, Sheeva sometimes appeared as a sub-boss before the final fight with Blaze. She is the only Shokan character that can perform aerial combos, and the only Shokan character that can be thrown by normal characters in the game. While she has Goro's offensive moves, she is female so that she would be smaller in size and therefore the same height as the other fighters.\n\n===In other media===\nSheeva appears in ''[[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]],'' played by [[Marjean Holden]]. The [[shooting script]] included a lengthy fight scene with [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] that was omitted during filming; instead, she was simply crushed by a falling cage in Kahn's throne room. Her only action sequence was a brief quarrel with Motaro, though the film did acknowledge that she was once Sindel's personal protector. In a 2001 interview with fansite Total Mortal Kombat, Holden expressed her displeasure at the filmmakers' treatment of her character. In the [[shooting script]] and novelization, Sheeva met her demise in an extensive fight scene with newly mortal Raiden, but the scene was never filmed and her screen time was scant in the finished print, with Raiden instead fighting two Raptors and Sheeva's death simply coming from a falling cage. \"Here was a character, that was one of the most popular [in] the video game...and they killed her without even so much as a fight! Something I was not happy about at all. That was one of the reasons I wanted to do the role, was for the sheer fact that there were really great fights in the movie for this character, and they all got cut out.\"<ref name=\"tmk\">[http://www.totalmortalkombat.com/cast/interviews/index.php?action=interview&interview_id=2 Interview with: Marjean Holden] - Total Mortal Kombat, 2/4/01</ref>\n\nSheeva has a small role in the animated series ''[[Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm]]'', in which she harbored a long-standing animosity toward Raiden. She was voiced by [[Dawnn Lewis]].\n\nIn the 2015 ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'' prequel comic miniseries produced by [[DC Comics]], Sheeva is crowned by Kintaro as the current leader of the Shokan in a peaceful treaty with Kotal Kahn, following the death of previous rule King Gorbak. Sheeva mourned Kintaro's death when a possessed [[Sonya Blade]] killed him in battle.\n\n==Reception==\nReception of the character has been mixed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sheevafanclub.wordpress.com/|title=Sheeva Fan Club|website=Sheeva Fan Club|language=en|access-date=2018-12-30}}</ref> ''SuperGamePower'' gave her their anti-awards for the ugliest female character of both 1996 and 1997.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1997|title=Os melhores do videogame|url=|journal=SuperGamePower|volume=38|pages=15|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 1998|title=II Oscar do videogame|url=|journal=SuperGamePowe|volume=50|pages=11|via=}}</ref> In 2011, [[Wirtualna Polska]] featured her among the top ten villainesses in gaming, as \"an attraction for connoisseurs of unusual beauty and even more unusual quantities of the various parts of the body.\"<ref>[http://gry.wp.pl/galeria/10-najseksowniejszych-negatywnych-bohaterek,179679/10.html Sheeva \u2013 Mortal Kombat - 10 najseksowniejszych negatywnych bohaterek - Imperium gier - WP.PL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321150440/http://gry.wp.pl/galeria/10-najseksowniejszych-negatywnych-bohaterek,179679/10.html |date=2012-03-21 }} {{in lang|pl}}</ref> In 2012, [[UGO.com]] ranked her as the 28th top ''Mortal Kombat'' character.<ref>{{cite web |author=UGO Team |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/mortal-kombat-characters-sheeva |title=Sheeva - Top 50 Mortal Kombat Characters |publisher=UGO.com |date=2012-02-28 |accessdate=2012-10-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316074322/http://www.ugo.com/games/mortal-kombat-characters-sheeva |archivedate=2013-03-16 }}</ref> Sheeva ranked 36th on a 2013 fan poll hosted by Dorkly that rated the entire series roster.
