During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|7th Speaker of the New York State Assembly]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was simultaneously appointed the [[New York State Attorney General|2nd Attorney General of New York]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nVarick was also a founder of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], the [[American Bible Society]], and a longtime trustee of [[Columbia University]].\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born on March 15, 1753, at [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]] to John Varick and Jane (n\u00e9e Dey) Varick.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\">{{cite book|last1=Cushman|first1=Paul|title=Richard Varick : A Forgotten Founding Father : revolutionary war soldier, Federalist politician, mayor of New York|date=2010|publisher=Modern Memoirs|location=Amherst, MA|isbn=978-0-9772337-6-2|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aDOUOnCcpQYC}}</ref> His mother grew up in her father's house, the [[Dey Mansion]], which would go on to play a pivotal role in the revolution.\n\nBoth Varick's parents ancestors had emigrated with the [[Dutch West India Company]] in the early to mid 17th century and remained in the greater New York City area.

He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired is commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold.

In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives.

This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]].

Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City===\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nMost notably, Varick was the [[Mayor of New York City]] for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801.<ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he focused on the yellow fever epidemics which struck repeatedly.\n\n==Foundations & Societies==\n===American Bible Society===\nVarick was a founder of the [[American Bible Society]] in 1816.<ref name=\"sunypress\">{{cite web|title=Richard Varick: A Forgotten Founding Father|url=https://www.sunypress.edu/p-5293-richard-varick-a-forgotten-foun.aspx|website=www.sunypress.edu|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Wosh1994\">{{cite book|last1=Wosh|first1=Peter J.|title=Spreading the Word: The Bible Business in Nineteenth-century America|date=1994|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|isbn=0801429285|url=https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/spreadingwordbib00wosh/page/16 16]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> He would later become president (succeeding [[John Jay]]) in 1828 until his death in 1831.\n\n===Society of the Cincinnati===\nHe was an original member of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] beginning in 1783, and president of the New York chapter until his death.

At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold.

In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal.

Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government.

Segregation was never mandated by law in the Northern states, but a ''de facto'' system grew for schools, in which nearly all black students attended schools that were nearly all-black.

Exposure is the likelihood that a minority and a majority party will come in contact with one another. Clustering is the gathering of different minority groups into a single space; clustering often leads to one big [[ghetto]] and the formation of hyperghettoization. Centralization measures the tendency of members of a minority group to be located in the middle of an urban area, often computed as a percentage of a minority group living in the middle of a city (as opposed to the outlying areas). Concentration is the dimension that relates to the actual amount of land a minority lives on within its particular city. The higher segregation is within that particular area, the smaller the amount of land a minority group will control.\n\nThe pattern of hypersegregation began in the early 20th century. African-Americans who moved to large cities often moved into the inner-city in order to gain industrial jobs. The influx of new African-American residents caused many European American residents to move to the suburbs in a case of [[white flight]]. As industry began to move out of the inner-city, the African-American residents lost the stable jobs that had brought them to the area. Many were unable to leave the inner-city, however, and they became increasingly poor.<ref name=\"Hurst\">{{Cite book| author = Charles E.

The United States government began making low-interest mortgages available to families through the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veteran's Administration]]. Black families were legally entitled to these loans but were sometimes denied these loans because the planners behind this initiative labeled many black neighborhoods throughout the country as \"in decline\". The rules for loans did not say that \"black families cannot get loans\"; rather, they said people from \"areas in decline\" could not get loans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/02/banks-lending-minorities/|title=Here's Why Big Banks Are Lending to Fewer Blacks and Hispanics|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}</ref> While a case could be made that the wording did not appear to compel segregation, it tended to have that effect.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} In fact, this administration was formed as part of the [[New Deal]] to all Americans and mostly affected black residents of inner city areas; most black families did in fact live in the [[inner city]] areas of large cities and almost entirely occupied these areas after the end of World War II when whites began to move to new suburbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/soc_sec/hgreat.htm|title=The Great Depression and the New Deal|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-05-29}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to encouraging white families to move to suburbs by providing them loans to do so, the government uprooted many established African American communities by building elevated highways through their neighborhoods. To build a highway, tens of thousands of single-family homes were destroyed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} Because these properties were summarily declared to be \"in decline,\" families were given pittances for their properties, and were forced into federal housing called \"the projects\".

Parks' civil disobedience had the effect of sparking the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]]. Parks' act of defiance became an important symbol of the modern [[Civil Rights Movement]] and Parks became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation. \n[[File:1943 Colored Waiting Room Sign.jpg|thumb|Sign for \"colored\" waiting room at a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus terminal in [[Rome, Georgia]], 1943.]]\n\nSegregation was also pervasive in housing. State constitutions (for example, that of [[California Constitution|California]]) had clauses giving local jurisdictions the right to regulate where members of certain races could live. In 1917, the Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Buchanan v. Warley]]'' declared municipal resident segregation [[Local ordinance|ordinances]] unconstitutional. In response, whites resorted to the [[restrictive covenant]], a formal deed restriction binding white property owners in a given neighborhood not to sell to blacks. Whites who broke these agreements could be sued by \"damaged\" neighbors.<ref>[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=443 The Great Migration, Period: 1920s] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121121733/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=443 |date=January 21, 2008 }}</ref> In the 1948 case of ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] finally ruled that such covenants were unenforceable in a court of law. However, residential segregation patterns had already become established in most American cities, and have often persisted up to the present (see [[white flight]] and [[Redlining]]).\n\nIn most cities, the only way blacks could relieve the pressure of crowding that resulted from increasing migration was to expand residential borders into surrounding previously white neighborhoods, a process that often resulted in harassment and attacks by white residents whose intolerant attitudes were intensified by fears that black neighbors would cause property values to decline. Moreover, the increased presence of African Americans in cities, North and South, as well as their competition with whites for housing, jobs, and political influence sparked a series of race riots. In 1898 white citizens of Wilmington, North Carolina, resenting African Americans' involvement in local government and incensed by an editorial in an African-American newspaper accusing white women of loose sexual behavior, rioted and killed dozens of blacks. In the fury's wake, white supremacists overthrew the city government, expelling black and white office holders, and instituted restrictions to prevent blacks from voting. In Atlanta in 1906, newspaper accounts alleging attacks by black men on white women provoked an outburst of shooting and killing that left twelve blacks dead and seventy injured. An influx of unskilled black strikebreakers into [[East St Louis, Illinois]], heightened racial tensions in 1917. Rumors that blacks were arming themselves for an attack on whites resulted in numerous attacks by white mobs on black neighborhoods. On July 1, blacks fired back at a car whose occupants they believed had shot into their homes and mistakenly killed two policemen riding in a car. The next day, a full scaled riot erupted which ended only after nine whites and thirty-nine blacks had been killed and over three hundred buildings were destroyed.\n\nWith the migration to the North of many black workers at the turn of the 20th century, and the friction that occurred between white and black workers during this time, segregation was and continues to be a phenomenon in northern cities as well as in the South. Whites generally allocate [[tenements]] as housing to the poorest blacks. It would be well to remember, though, that while racism had to be legislated out of the South, many in the North, including [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and others who ran the [[Underground Railroad]], were ideologically opposed to Southerners' treatment of blacks. By the same token, many white Southerners have a claim to closer relationships with blacks than wealthy northern whites, regardless of the latter's stated political persuasion.<ref>[http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Social%20Issues/E/history.html History of Residential Segregation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041114125050/http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Social%20Issues/E/history.html |date=November 14, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n[[Anti-miscegenation laws]] (also known as miscegenation laws) prohibited whites and non-whites from marrying each other.

As one of many examples of such state laws, [[Utah]]'s marriage law had an anti-[[miscegenation]] component that was passed in 1899 and repealed in 1963.

This phenomenon is due to [[white flight]] where whites actively leave neighborhoods often because of a black presence. There are more than just geographical consequences to this, as the money leaves and poverty grows, crime rates jump and businesses leave and follow the money. This creates a job shortage in segregated neighborhoods and perpetuates the economic inequality in the inner city. With the wealth and businesses gone from inner city areas, the tax base decreases, which hurts funding for education. Consequently, those that can afford to leave the area for better schools leave decreasing the tax base for educational funding even more.

In analyzing racial and class segregation, the book documents the migration of white Americans from urban centers to small-town, exurban, and rural communities. Throughout the 20th Century, racial discrimination was deliberate and intentional. Today, racial segregation and division result from policies and institutions that are no longer explicitly designed to discriminate. Yet the outcomes of those policies and beliefs have negative, racial impacts, namely with segregation.<ref>Benjamin, Rich.

This was challenged in [[Montgomery, Alabama]] by [[Rosa Parks]], who refused to give up her seat to a white passenger, and by [[Rev. Martin Luther King]], who organized the [[Montgomery bus boycott]] (1955\u20131956). A federal court suit in Alabama, ''[[Browder v. Gayle]]'' (1956), was successful at the district court level, which ruled Alabama's bus segregation laws illegal. It was upheld at the Supreme Court level.\n\nIn 1961 [[Congress of Racial Equality]] director [[James Farmer]], other CORE members and some [[Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee]] members traveled as a mixed race group, [[Freedom Riders]], on Greyhound buses from Washington, D.C., headed towards [[New Orleans]]. In several states the travelers were subject to violence. In [[Anniston, Alabama]] the [[Ku Klux Klan]] attacked the buses, setting one bus on fire. After U.S. attorney general [[Robert F. Kennedy]] resisted taking action and urged restraint by the riders, Kennedy relented. He urged the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] to issue an order directing that buses, trains, and their intermediate facilities, such as stations, restrooms and water fountains be desegregated.<ref>'Freedom Rides,' The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute (Stanford) https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/freedom-rides</ref><ref>'Freedom Riders end racial segregation in Southern U.S. public transit, 1961,' Global Nonviolent Action Database, 2009, 2011 https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/freedom-riders-end-racial-segregation-southern-us-public-transit-1961</ref>\n\n==Effects==\n===Education===\n[[File:Colored School, by J.

The radical left-wing web-magazine [[ZNet]] featured a series of 4 articles on \"The New American Apartheid\" in which it drew parallels between the treatment of blacks by the American justice system and apartheid:\n\n<blockquote>Modern prisoners occupy the lowest rungs on the social class ladder, and they always have. The modern prison system (along with local jails) is a collection of ghettos or poorhouses reserved primarily for the unskilled, the uneducated, and the powerless. In increasing numbers this system is being reserved for racial minorities, especially blacks, which is why we are calling it the New American Apartheid. This is the same segment of American society that has experienced some of the most drastic reductions in income and they have been targeted for their involvement in drugs and the subsequent violence that extends from the lack of legitimate means of goal attainment.<ref>Shelden, Randall G.\nand William B.

This serves the purpose of making students of color more comfortable and highlighting the challenges they face on historically white-dominated campuses, although it may impair the ability of such students to interact with people outside of their specific group.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.nas.org/reports/separate-but-equal-again\n | title =Separate but Equal, Again\n | last =Pierre\n | first =Dion\n | date =29 April 2019\n | website =National Association of Scholars\n | access-date =28 June 2019 }}</ref>\n\nDue to education being funded primarily through local and state revenue, the quality of education varies greatly depending on the geographical location of the school. In some areas, education is primarily funded through revenue from property taxes; therefore, there is a direct correlation in some areas between the price of homes and the amount of money allocated to educating the area's youth.<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\">Massey, Douglas S. 2004. \"The New Geography of Inequality in Urban America,\" in C. Michael Henry, ed. Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy.

U.S. Census Bureau</ref> Therefore, in predominantly African-American areas, otherwise known as 'ghettos', the amount of money available for education is extremely low. This is referred to as \"funding segregation\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\"/> This questionable system of educational funding can be seen as one of the primary reasons contemporary racial segregation continues to prosper. Predominantly Caucasian areas with more money funneled into primary and secondary educational institutions, allow their students the resources to succeed academically and obtain post-secondary degrees. This practice continues to ethnically, socially and economically divide America.\n\nAlternative certificate programs were introduced in many inner-city schools and rural areas. These programs award a person a teaching license even though he/she has not completed a traditional teaching degree. This program came into effect in the 1980s throughout most states in response to the dwindling number of people seeking to earn a secondary degree in education.<ref>Feistritzer, Emily (February 1, 2006). \"Alternative Teacher Certification\". National Center for Alternative Certification</ref> This program has been very controversial. It is, \"booming despite little more than anecdotal evidence of their success.[\u2026] there are concerns about how they will perform as teachers, especially since they are more likely to end up in poor districts teaching students in challenging situations.\"<ref>{{cite news |author1=Morgan Smith  |author2=Nick Pandolfo  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=For-Profit Certification for Teachers is Booming |newspaper= The New York Times |date=November 26, 2011 |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/us/for-profit-certification-for-teachers-in-texas-is-booming.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0}}</ref> Alternative Certificate graduates tend to teach African-Americans and other ethnic minorities in inner-city schools and schools in impoverished small rural towns. Therefore, impoverished minorities not only have to cope with having the smallest amount of resources for their educational facilities but also with having the least trained teachers in the nation. Valorie Delp, a mother residing in an inner-city area whose child attends a school taught by teachers awarded by an alternative certificate program notes:\n\n<blockquote>One teacher we know who is in this program said he had visions of coming in to \"save\" the kids and the school and he really believes that this idea was kind of stoked in his program. No one ever says that you may have kids who threaten to stab you, or call you unspeakable names to your face, or can't read despite being in 7th grade.<ref>{{cite web|author=Valorie Delp |title=My Inner City Story: Why Alternative Certification Programs Don't Work, Parenting Education |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url= http://education.families.com/blog/my-inner-city-story-how-alternative-teacher-certification-programs-do-a-disservice-to-the-inner-city}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDelp showcases that, while many graduates of these certificate programs have honorable intentions and are educated, intelligent people, there is a reason why teachers have traditionally had to take a significant amount of training before officially being certified as a teacher. The experience they gain through their practicum and extensive classroom experience equips them with the tools necessary to educate today's youth.\n\nSome measures have been taken to try give less affluent families the ability to educate their children. President [[Ronald Reagan]] introduced the McKinney\u2013Vento Homeless Assistance Act on July 22, 1987.<ref>Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, \"McKinney-Vento Education for Homeless Children and Youths Program: Notice of school enrollment guidelines\"</ref> This Act was meant to allow children the ability to succeed if their families did not have a permanent residence. Leo Stagman, a single, African-American parent, located in Berkeley, California, whose daughter had received a great deal of aid from the Act wrote on October 20, 2012 that, \"During her education, she [Leo's daughter] was eligible for the free lunch program and received assistance under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Educational Act.

One of these Acts includes the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB).

This Act therefore, has done little to close the educational gap between Caucasian and minority children.<ref>\"Charting the Course: States Decide Major Provisions Under No Child Left Behind.\" U.S. Department of Education.</ref>\n\nThere has also been an issue with minority populations becoming educated because to a fear of being accused of \"Acting White\". It is a hard definition to pin down, however, this is a negative term predominantly used by African-Americans that showing interest in one's studies is a betrayal of the African-American culture as one is trying to be a part of white society rather than staying true to his/her roots. Roland G.

Poorer inner-cities often lack the health care that is available in outside areas. That many inner-cities are so isolated from other parts of society also is a large contributor to the poor health often found in inner-city residents. The overcrowded living conditions in the inner-city caused by hypersegregation means that the spread of infectious diseases, such as [[tuberculosis]], occurs much more frequently.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Acevedo-Garcia |first=Dolores |title=Residential Segregation and the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases |journal=Social Science & Medicine |volume=51 |issue=8 |year=2000 |pages=1143\u20131161 |doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00016-2 |pmid=11037206 }}</ref> This is known as \"epidemic injustice\" because racial groups confined in a certain area are affected much more often than those living outside the area.\n\nPoor inner-city residents also must contend with other factors that negatively affect health. Research has proven that in every major American city, hypersegregated blacks are far more likely to be exposed to dangerous levels of air toxins.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lopez |first=R. |title=Segregation and Black/White Differences in Exposure to Air Toxics in 1990 |journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]] |volume=110 |issue=Suppl. 2 |year=2002 |pages=289\u2013295 |doi= 10.1289/ehp.02110s2289 |pmid=11929740 |pmc=1241175 |jstor=3455065 }}</ref> Daily exposure to this polluted air means that African-Americans living in these areas are at greater risk of disease.\n\n===Crime===\nOne area where hypersegregation seems to have the greatest effect is in violence experienced by residents.

Everyone was supposed to receive the same public services (schools, hospitals, prisons, etc.), but with separate facilities for each race. In practice, the services and facilities reserved for African-Americans were almost always of lower quality than those reserved for whites, if they existed at all; for example, most [[African-American schools]] received less public funding per student than nearby white schools. Segregation was never mandated by law in the Northern states, but a ''de facto'' system grew for schools, in which nearly all black students attended schools that were nearly all-black.

Exposure is the likelihood that a minority and a majority party will come in contact with one another. Clustering is the gathering of different minority groups into a single space; clustering often leads to one big [[ghetto]] and the formation of hyperghettoization. Centralization measures the tendency of members of a minority group to be located in the middle of an urban area, often computed as a percentage of a minority group living in the middle of a city (as opposed to the outlying areas). Concentration is the dimension that relates to the actual amount of land a minority lives on within its particular city. The higher segregation is within that particular area, the smaller the amount of land a minority group will control.\n\nThe pattern of hypersegregation began in the early 20th century. African-Americans who moved to large cities often moved into the inner-city in order to gain industrial jobs. The influx of new African-American residents caused many European American residents to move to the suburbs in a case of [[white flight]]. As industry began to move out of the inner-city, the African-American residents lost the stable jobs that had brought them to the area. Many were unable to leave the inner-city, however, and they became increasingly poor.<ref name=\"Hurst\">{{Cite book| author = Charles E.

The United States government began making low-interest mortgages available to families through the [[Federal Housing Administration]] (FHA) and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veteran's Administration]]. Black families were legally entitled to these loans but were sometimes denied these loans because the planners behind this initiative labeled many black neighborhoods throughout the country as \"in decline\". The rules for loans did not say that \"black families cannot get loans\"; rather, they said people from \"areas in decline\" could not get loans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2016/06/02/banks-lending-minorities/|title=Here's Why Big Banks Are Lending to Fewer Blacks and Hispanics|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en}}</ref> While a case could be made that the wording did not appear to compel segregation, it tended to have that effect.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} In fact, this administration was formed as part of the [[New Deal]] to all Americans and mostly affected black residents of inner city areas; most black families did in fact live in the [[inner city]] areas of large cities and almost entirely occupied these areas after the end of World War II when whites began to move to new suburbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/soc_sec/hgreat.htm|title=The Great Depression and the New Deal|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-05-29}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to encouraging white families to move to suburbs by providing them loans to do so, the government uprooted many established African American communities by building elevated highways through their neighborhoods.

Parks' civil disobedience had the effect of sparking the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]]. Parks' act of defiance became an important symbol of the modern [[Civil Rights Movement]] and Parks became an international icon of resistance to racial segregation. \n[[File:1943 Colored Waiting Room Sign.jpg|thumb|Sign for \"colored\" waiting room at a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus terminal in [[Rome, Georgia]], 1943.]]\n\nSegregation was also pervasive in housing. State constitutions (for example, that of [[California Constitution|California]]) had clauses giving local jurisdictions the right to regulate where members of certain races could live. In 1917, the Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Buchanan v. Warley]]'' declared municipal resident segregation [[Local ordinance|ordinances]] unconstitutional. In response, whites resorted to the [[restrictive covenant]], a formal deed restriction binding white property owners in a given neighborhood not to sell to blacks. Whites who broke these agreements could be sued by \"damaged\" neighbors.<ref>[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=443 The Great Migration, Period: 1920s] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080121121733/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=443 |date=January 21, 2008 }}</ref> In the 1948 case of ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] finally ruled that such covenants were unenforceable in a court of law. However, residential segregation patterns had already become established in most American cities, and have often persisted up to the present (see [[white flight]] and [[Redlining]]).\n\nIn most cities, the only way blacks could relieve the pressure of crowding that resulted from increasing migration was to expand residential borders into surrounding previously white neighborhoods, a process that often resulted in harassment and attacks by white residents whose intolerant attitudes were intensified by fears that black neighbors would cause property values to decline. Moreover, the increased presence of African Americans in cities, North and South, as well as their competition with whites for housing, jobs, and political influence sparked a series of race riots. In 1898 white citizens of Wilmington, North Carolina, resenting African Americans' involvement in local government and incensed by an editorial in an African-American newspaper accusing white women of loose sexual behavior, rioted and killed dozens of blacks. In the fury's wake, white supremacists overthrew the city government, expelling black and white office holders, and instituted restrictions to prevent blacks from voting. In Atlanta in 1906, newspaper accounts alleging attacks by black men on white women provoked an outburst of shooting and killing that left twelve blacks dead and seventy injured. An influx of unskilled black strikebreakers into [[East St Louis, Illinois]], heightened racial tensions in 1917. Rumors that blacks were arming themselves for an attack on whites resulted in numerous attacks by white mobs on black neighborhoods. On July 1, blacks fired back at a car whose occupants they believed had shot into their homes and mistakenly killed two policemen riding in a car. The next day, a full scaled riot erupted which ended only after nine whites and thirty-nine blacks had been killed and over three hundred buildings were destroyed.\n\nWith the migration to the North of many black workers at the turn of the 20th century, and the friction that occurred between white and black workers during this time, segregation was and continues to be a phenomenon in northern cities as well as in the South. Whites generally allocate [[tenements]] as housing to the poorest blacks. It would be well to remember, though, that while racism had to be legislated out of the South, many in the North, including [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] and others who ran the [[Underground Railroad]], were ideologically opposed to Southerners' treatment of blacks. By the same token, many white Southerners have a claim to closer relationships with blacks than wealthy northern whites, regardless of the latter's stated political persuasion.<ref>[http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Social%20Issues/E/history.html History of Residential Segregation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041114125050/http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Social%20Issues/E/history.html |date=November 14, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n[[Anti-miscegenation laws]] (also known as miscegenation laws) prohibited whites and non-whites from marrying each other.

As one of many examples of such state laws, [[Utah]]'s marriage law had an anti-[[miscegenation]] component that was passed in 1899 and repealed in 1963.

This phenomenon is due to [[white flight]] where whites actively leave neighborhoods often because of a black presence. There are more than just geographical consequences to this, as the money leaves and poverty grows, crime rates jump and businesses leave and follow the money. This creates a job shortage in segregated neighborhoods and perpetuates the economic inequality in the inner city. With the wealth and businesses gone from inner city areas, the tax base decreases, which hurts funding for education. Consequently, those that can afford to leave the area for better schools leave decreasing the tax base for educational funding even more. Any business that is left or would consider opening doesn't want to invest in a place nobody has any money but has a lot of crime, meaning the only things that are left in these communities are poor black people with little opportunity for employment or education.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Newman |first=Katherine |title=No Shame in My Game: The Working Poor in the Inner City |url=https://archive.org/details/noshameinmygamew00newm |url-access=registration |location=New York |publisher=Knopf |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-375-40254-8 }}</ref>\n\nToday, a number of whites are willing, and are able, to pay a premium to live in a predominantly white neighborhood.

In analyzing racial and class segregation, the book documents the migration of white Americans from urban centers to small-town, exurban, and rural communities. Throughout the 20th Century, racial discrimination was deliberate and intentional. Today, racial segregation and division result from policies and institutions that are no longer explicitly designed to discriminate. Yet the outcomes of those policies and beliefs have negative, racial impacts, namely with segregation.<ref>Benjamin, Rich.

This was challenged in [[Montgomery, Alabama]] by [[Rosa Parks]], who refused to give up her seat to a white passenger, and by [[Rev. Martin Luther King]], who organized the [[Montgomery bus boycott]] (1955\u20131956). A federal court suit in Alabama, ''[[Browder v.

It was upheld at the Supreme Court level.\n\nIn 1961 [[Congress of Racial Equality]] director [[James Farmer]], other CORE members and some [[Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee]] members traveled as a mixed race group, [[Freedom Riders]], on Greyhound buses from Washington, D.C., headed towards [[New Orleans]]. In several states the travelers were subject to violence. In [[Anniston, Alabama]] the [[Ku Klux Klan]] attacked the buses, setting one bus on fire. After U.S. attorney general [[Robert F. Kennedy]] resisted taking action and urged restraint by the riders, Kennedy relented. He urged the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] to issue an order directing that buses, trains, and their intermediate facilities, such as stations, restrooms and water fountains be desegregated.<ref>'Freedom Rides,' The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute (Stanford) https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/freedom-rides</ref><ref>'Freedom Riders end racial segregation in Southern U.S. public transit, 1961,' Global Nonviolent Action Database, 2009, 2011 https://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/freedom-riders-end-racial-segregation-southern-us-public-transit-1961</ref>\n\n==Effects==\n===Education===\n[[File:Colored School, by J.

The radical left-wing web-magazine [[ZNet]] featured a series of 4 articles on \"The New American Apartheid\" in which it drew parallels between the treatment of blacks by the American justice system and apartheid:\n\n<blockquote>Modern prisoners occupy the lowest rungs on the social class ladder, and they always have. The modern prison system (along with local jails) is a collection of ghettos or poorhouses reserved primarily for the unskilled, the uneducated, and the powerless. In increasing numbers this system is being reserved for racial minorities, especially blacks, which is why we are calling it the New American Apartheid. This is the same segment of American society that has experienced some of the most drastic reductions in income and they have been targeted for their involvement in drugs and the subsequent violence that extends from the lack of legitimate means of goal attainment.<ref>Shelden, Randall G.\nand William B.

This serves the purpose of making students of color more comfortable and highlighting the challenges they face on historically white-dominated campuses, although it may impair the ability of such students to interact with people outside of their specific group.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =https://www.nas.org/reports/separate-but-equal-again\n | title =Separate but Equal, Again\n | last =Pierre\n | first =Dion\n | date =29 April 2019\n | website =National Association of Scholars\n | access-date =28 June 2019 }}</ref>\n\nDue to education being funded primarily through local and state revenue, the quality of education varies greatly depending on the geographical location of the school. In some areas, education is primarily funded through revenue from property taxes; therefore, there is a direct correlation in some areas between the price of homes and the amount of money allocated to educating the area's youth.<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\">Massey, Douglas S. 2004. \"The New Geography of Inequality in Urban America,\" in C. Michael Henry, ed. Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy.

This is referred to as \"funding segregation\".<ref name=\"autogenerated2004\"/> This questionable system of educational funding can be seen as one of the primary reasons contemporary racial segregation continues to prosper. Predominantly Caucasian areas with more money funneled into primary and secondary educational institutions, allow their students the resources to succeed academically and obtain post-secondary degrees. This practice continues to ethnically, socially and economically divide America.\n\nAlternative certificate programs were introduced in many inner-city schools and rural areas. These programs award a person a teaching license even though he/she has not completed a traditional teaching degree.

National Center for Alternative Certification</ref> This program has been very controversial. It is, \"booming despite little more than anecdotal evidence of their success.[\u2026] there are concerns about how they will perform as teachers, especially since they are more likely to end up in poor districts teaching students in challenging situations.\"<ref>{{cite news |author1=Morgan Smith  |author2=Nick Pandolfo  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=For-Profit Certification for Teachers is Booming |newspaper= The New York Times |date=November 26, 2011 |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/us/for-profit-certification-for-teachers-in-texas-is-booming.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0}}</ref> Alternative Certificate graduates tend to teach African-Americans and other ethnic minorities in inner-city schools and schools in impoverished small rural towns. Therefore, impoverished minorities not only have to cope with having the smallest amount of resources for their educational facilities but also with having the least trained teachers in the nation. Valorie Delp, a mother residing in an inner-city area whose child attends a school taught by teachers awarded by an alternative certificate program notes:\n\n<blockquote>One teacher we know who is in this program said he had visions of coming in to \"save\" the kids and the school and he really believes that this idea was kind of stoked in his program. No one ever says that you may have kids who threaten to stab you, or call you unspeakable names to your face, or can't read despite being in 7th grade.<ref>{{cite web|author=Valorie Delp |title=My Inner City Story: Why Alternative Certification Programs Don't Work, Parenting Education |accessdate= November 4, 2012 |url= http://education.families.com/blog/my-inner-city-story-how-alternative-teacher-certification-programs-do-a-disservice-to-the-inner-city}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDelp showcases that, while many graduates of these certificate programs have honorable intentions and are educated, intelligent people, there is a reason why teachers have traditionally had to take a significant amount of training before officially being certified as a teacher. The experience they gain through their practicum and extensive classroom experience equips them with the tools necessary to educate today's youth.\n\nSome measures have been taken to try give less affluent families the ability to educate their children. President [[Ronald Reagan]] introduced the McKinney\u2013Vento Homeless Assistance Act on July 22, 1987.<ref>Department of Education, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education, \"McKinney-Vento Education for Homeless Children and Youths Program: Notice of school enrollment guidelines\"</ref> This Act was meant to allow children the ability to succeed if their families did not have a permanent residence. Leo Stagman, a single, African-American parent, located in Berkeley, California, whose daughter had received a great deal of aid from the Act wrote on October 20, 2012 that, \"During her education, she [Leo's daughter] was eligible for the free lunch program and received assistance under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Educational Act.

This Act therefore, has done little to close the educational gap between Caucasian and minority children.<ref>\"Charting the Course: States Decide Major Provisions Under No Child Left Behind.\" U.S. Department of Education.</ref>\n\nThere has also been an issue with minority populations becoming educated because to a fear of being accused of \"Acting White\". It is a hard definition to pin down, however, this is a negative term predominantly used by African-Americans that showing interest in one's studies is a betrayal of the African-American culture as one is trying to be a part of white society rather than staying true to his/her roots. Roland G.

In New York City, 19 out of 32 school districts have fewer white students.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/26/new-york-schools-segregated_n_5034455.html|title=The Nation's Most Segregated Schools Aren't Where You'd Think They'd Be|last=Resmovits|first=Joy|date=2014-03-26|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-07-18|language=en-US}}</ref> The United States Supreme Court tried to deal with school segregation more than six decades ago but impoverished and colored students still do not have equal access to opportunities in education.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.uscourts.gov/educational-resources/educational-activities/history-brown-v-board-education-re-enactment|title=History \u2013 Brown v.

Poorer inner-cities often lack the health care that is available in outside areas. That many inner-cities are so isolated from other parts of society also is a large contributor to the poor health often found in inner-city residents. The overcrowded living conditions in the inner-city caused by hypersegregation means that the spread of infectious diseases, such as [[tuberculosis]], occurs much more frequently.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Acevedo-Garcia |first=Dolores |title=Residential Segregation and the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases |journal=Social Science & Medicine |volume=51 |issue=8 |year=2000 |pages=1143\u20131161 |doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(00)00016-2 |pmid=11037206 }}</ref> This is known as \"epidemic injustice\" because racial groups confined in a certain area are affected much more often than those living outside the area.\n\nPoor inner-city residents also must contend with other factors that negatively affect health. Research has proven that in every major American city, hypersegregated blacks are far more likely to be exposed to dangerous levels of air toxins.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lopez |first=R. |title=Segregation and Black/White Differences in Exposure to Air Toxics in 1990 |journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]] |volume=110 |issue=Suppl. 2 |year=2002 |pages=289\u2013295 |doi= 10.1289/ehp.02110s2289 |pmid=11929740 |pmc=1241175 |jstor=3455065 }}</ref> Daily exposure to this polluted air means that African-Americans living in these areas are at greater risk of disease.\n\n===Crime===\nOne area where hypersegregation seems to have the greatest effect is in violence experienced by residents. The number of violent crimes in the U.S. in general has fallen. The number of murders in the U.S. fell 9% from the 1980s to the 1990s.<ref name=\"Getting Away with Murder\">{{Cite journal| author = Douglas S.

As of 1993, young African-American men are eleven times more likely to be shot to death and nine times more likely to be murdered than their European American peers.<ref name=\"American Apartheid\"/> Poverty, high unemployment, and broken families, all factors more prevalent in hypersegregated inner-cities, all contribute significantly to the unequal levels of violence experienced by African-Americans. Research has proven that the more segregated the surrounding European American suburban ring is, the rate of violent crime in the inner-city will rise, but, likewise, crime in the outer area will drop.<ref name=\"Getting Away with Murder\"/>\n\n===Poverty===\nOne study finds that an area's residential racial segregation increases metropolitan rates of black poverty and overall black-white [[income inequality in the United States|income disparities]], while decreasing rates of white poverty and [[racial inequality in the United States|inequality]] within the white population.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Wrong Side(s) of the Tracks: The Causal Effects of Racial Segregation on Urban Poverty and Inequality|journal = American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|date = 2011-04-01|issn = 1945-7782|pages = 34\u201366|volume = 3|issue = 2|doi = 10.1257/app.3.2.34|first = Elizabeth Oltmans|last = Ananat|citeseerx = 10.1.1.637.8290}}</ref>\n\n===Single parenthood===\nOne study finds that African-Americans who live in segregated metro areas have a higher likelihood of single-parenthood than Blacks who live in more integrated places.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Are Ghettos Good or Bad?|url = http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/112/3/827|journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date = 1997-08-01|issn = 0033-5533|pages = 827\u2013872|volume = 112|issue = 3|doi = 10.1162/003355397555361|first = David M.|last = Cutler|first2 = Edward L.|last2 = Glaeser}}</ref>\n\n===Public spending===\nResearch shows that segregation along racial lines contributes to public goods inequalities.

It is based on the [[Agatha Christie]] [[Ordeal by Innocence|novel of the same name]] and is the third English-language filmed version to be broadcast. The drama stars [[Morven Christie]], [[Bill Nighy]], [[Anna Chancellor]], [[Alice Eve]] and [[Eleanor Tomlinson]] amongst others.\n\nThe show was originally intended to be broadcast as part of the BBC [[Christmas]] programming but was held back due to original cast member [[Ed Westwick]] being accused of sexual assault. His scenes were later reshot with [[Christian Cooke]] taking his place.\n\nThe series attracted positive reviews despite some backlash over the changes made to the plot. The direction and styling were afforded particular praise.\nThe series was released on DVD through [[Universal Pictures UK]] on 11 March 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Agatha-Christie-Ordeal-Innocence-DVD/dp/B07M7DG7FS/ref=sr_1_3?s=dvd&ie=UTF8&qid=1547405414&sr=1-3&keywords=ordeal+by+innocence|title=Agatha Christie: Ordeal By Innocence [DVD]|website=Amazon.co.uk|access-date=13 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nWealthy heiress Rachel Argyll is found bludgeoned to death in her palatial home where she lives with her husband, Leo; their five adopted children Mary, Mickey, Jack, Tina, and Hester; and their maid, Kirsten Lindquist. Jack is arrested for the crime as his fingerprints are found on the presumed murder weapon, but is killed in jail before he can stand trial.\n\nEighteen months later, Leo is set to marry his secretary Gwenda Vaughn, much to his children's dismay. A man named Arthur Calgary arrives and provides an alibi for Jack: he had given him a ride at the time of the murder. Calgary claims to have been working in the Arctic since the murder and only just learned about it. Leo believes him to be a charlatan and Mickey threatens him. Calgary is later approached by Mary's husband, Philip Durrant, who has become embittered towards the Argylls after being paralyzed in a car crash and suggests they work together to extort money from the family. Calgary rejects his offer but promises to clear Jack's name. Flashbacks reveal that Rachel was a cruel and unloving mother who alienated her children, leaving any of them with motive to murder her.\n\nAs Calgary returns to the Argyll estate, a car tries to run him down but crashes and kills the driver, Bellamy Gould, the police detective who investigated Rachel's murder. Calgary meets with Leo and admits that he had lied about his background. He was a scientist who had worked on the atomic bomb and suffered a mental breakdown from guilt. The night of the murder, Calgary escaped from a mental asylum and was recaptured after giving Jack a ride, and says that he saw another on the road that night. Durrant, having antagonized many of the family members, is confronted by the killer, who murders him via a drug overdose.\n\nThe next morning, Durrant's body is discovered by Leo and Calgary. The Argyll children and Kirsten begin to piece together what happened. Flashbacks show the events leading up to the murder. Jack, in an attempt to goad his mother, had confronted her with the fact that Mickey and Tina had become lovers. She, in turn, reveals to him that Kirsten is his biological mother and Leo his father, which causes him to flee the house. Rachel discovers Leo having an affair with Gwenda and threatens to divorce him, so he bludgeons her to death with one of his Egyptian statuettes. Bellamy Gould helps frame Jack, out of rage at Jack's affair with his wife. To prevent Jack from revealing the truth about his parentage, Leo and Bellamy conspire to have him killed before he can stand trial.\n\nIn the present, Calgary is taken away to the mental hospital on Leo's recommendation. Kirsten and the children confront Leo with their knowledge of his crime. Later that day, the police search for Leo, who has disappeared. Some time later, the Argyll siblings visit Calgary at the mental hospital, while Kirsten checks on Leo, imprisoned in the family's bomb shelter.\n\n===Differences from the novel===\nJust like many other novels and stories by Agatha Christie, ''Ordeal by Innocence'' is set in the [[West Country]] of England.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Webb|first1=Claire|title=Where is BBC Agatha Christie drama Ordeal by Innocence filmed?|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2018-04-01/ordeal-by-innocence-bbc-location-guide-filming-house/|website=Radio Times|accessdate=3 April 2018|date=1 April 2018}}</ref> This production shifted the location to Scotland and it was filmed in and around [[Inverkip]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Coulter|first1=Paul John|title=Film star Bill Nighy set for Ardgowan House return to re-shoot Agatha Christie drama|url=http://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/news/greenock/15815746.Film_star_Bill_Nighy_set_for_Ardgowan_House_return_to_re_shoot_Agatha_Christie_drama/|accessdate=3 April 2018|work=Greenock Telegraph|date=10 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe family name in the book is Argyle, whereas it is spelt Argyll in the programme (although the pronunciation is the same).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zemboy|first1=James|title=The Detective Novels of Agatha Christie: A Reader's Guide|date=2008|publisher=McFarland & Co., Publishers|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-3914-0|page=312}}</ref> The main suspect character, Jack, is called Jacko in the book,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Billen|first1=Andrew|title=Ordeal by Innocence: the Christie Mystery that almost got away|work=The Times|issue=72497|date=31 March 2018|location=Saturday Review|page=4|issn=0140-0460}}</ref> and he dies in prison from pneumonia instead of being beaten to death.\n\nWith regard to characters, Kirsten Lindstrom, the family's housekeeper, is a middle-aged [[Nordic race|Nordic]] woman in the novel, a detail that plays a key role in the book's solution; in the miniseries, she is depicted as a [[Scotland|Scottish]] woman in her thirties, who is one of Rachel's foundlings. The subplot of her and Leo being the biological parents of Jack was created for the series. Dr Calgary is portrayed as mentally disturbed in this version, putting his testimony into doubt, whereas in the book his testimony is seen as reliable from the very beginning. Other characters, such as Gwenda Vaughan, Mary Durrant, and Hester Argyll, are portrayed less uncritically than they were in the novel: Gwenda is bossy and smug, Mary is deeply embittered, and Hester is a secret alcoholic.\n\nThe solution has also been radically altered. In the book, the murderer is Kirsten, who is seduced by Jacko and instructed to kill Rachel.

As her body is being carried off on a stretcher, one of her five adopted children, Jack, is fingerprinted and talks the crime over with his dad, Leo Argyll, at the police station. Jack is later beaten to death in prison and the family buries him. Eighteen months later, Leo Argyll is preparing to marry his secretary, Gwenda Vaughan. This sees the return of son Mickey to the house and the arrival of a strange visitor, Dr Arthur Calgary, who reveals that he gave a lift to Jack at the time that Rachel Argyll was murdered, thus proving belatedly Jack's innocence. The delay in coming forward is explained away by Calgary being a physicist who has been in the [[Arctic]] on a research project. Later, whilst Calgary is sleeping in his hotel room, Mickey Argyll goes to question him and warn him off. At the hotel, Philip Durrant, the husband of Rachel's eldest adopted daughter, joins Calgary for dinner to propose a plan to make money from Calgary's revelation by selling the story to the newspapers. Durrant, a former [[Royal Air Force]] pilot who was disabled in a car crash, is shown as an abusive husband and a [[morphine]] addict. His wife Mary Durrant is also nasty to Tina Argyll and tells Gwenda that she will never replace her mother.\n| LineColor       = 9F260A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = Episode 2\n| DirectedBy      = Sandra Goldbacher\n| WrittenBy       = Sarah Phelps\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|04|08|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 6.11\n| ShortSummary    = Dr Calgary revisits Sunny Point and is spotted by Hester before Mickey forces him into a car and drives him to a railway station. He assaults Calgary and firmly puts him on a train and tells him to leave. Whilst in motion, Calgary gets the train to stop in the middle of nowhere so he can get off and go back. Over breakfast at Sunny Point, Phillip antagonises everyone and causes many arguments between the siblings. He points out that trying to hide the new found evidence from Calgary, would look suspicious to the police. Calgary later telephones the house with the housemaid, Kirsten, picking up the phone at the same time as Leo Argyll. Calgary informs Argyll that he is going to the police with Kirsten overhearing it all but saying nothing. Whilst Calgary is walking on the road, he is stopped by Bellamy Gould, Chief Constable and friend of Leo Argyll, who is driving a car. Gould questions Calgary's statement and seems to leave only to turn around and try to run Calgary down. Gould dies in trying, but Calgary survives. Calgary eventually gets a fair hearing form Leo Argyll and stays overnight at the house giving his version of events over dinner. The four remaining Argyll siblings meet later that night in the woods and argue about where they all were on the night of Rachel's murder and bicker in a display of sibling rivalry with Mary Durrant appearing as the most upset by events and how she feels the other children spoilt her relationship with Rachel. Near the end of the episode, Phillip Durrant is trying to leave the house when he hears footsteps behind him, he turns and says \"of course it's you!\". In the morning, Calgary reveals he wrote a detonation formula for the bombs dropped on [[Bombing of hiroshima|Hiroshima]] and [[Bombing of Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], this led him to go mad and be detained against his will at an asylum, not away at the Arctic, as he claimed in the first episode. On the night that Rachel died, he escaped and gave a lift to Jack. At breakfast, Calgary mentions that the shower in the Durrant's room has been going for some time. Leo Argyll and Calgary go to investigate and find Phillip Durrant dead on the floor of the shower with a hypodermic needle in his arm.\n| LineColor       = 9F260A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| Title           = Episode 3\n| DirectedBy      = Sandra Goldbacher\n| WrittenBy       = Sarah Phelps\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|04|15|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 5.87\n| ShortSummary    = This episode runs over a very short time period but has flashbacks for all the characters and details their reasons for possibly being the killer of Rachel. Hester runs away from the house and when Rachel tracks her down, she drugs her and takes her to hospital where she instructs the doctor to terminate the pregnancy. Jack witnesses Mickey and Tina in a passionate embrace and uses this against Rachel. Later we see Rachel telling Tina that she is filth. When Rachel goes into Leo's study and discovers women's underwear on the floor, she goes to the very top floor of the house and catches Leo and Gwenda on the bed. She informs Gwenda that Leo has a habit of sleeping with the staff and that she is not the first. Gwenda retaliates in kind and Rachel smacks her across the face. Rachel tells Leo she is divorcing him and through the conversation, it is understood that the money is in her name and he will be penniless. When she leaves Leo's study, she is confronted by Mary who is upset that Rachel does not love her. Rachel tells her that she only adopted her because she was sad, and that it wasn't Mary's fault she could not stop her sadness. Jack witnesses this and is aghast, so he confronts his mother and she in turn tells him he is the son of Kirsten, the cook. Jack goes to see Kirsten and through another flashback, Jack is shown in the police station telling Leo that he knows that Leo is his father and that Kirsten is his mother. He tells Leo acidly that he will destroy him and ruin his life. Rachel is then shown being hit on the head with an Egyptian statuette by Leo and soon afterwards, Kirsten goes in to confront her about telling Jack of his parentage. Rachel dies in Kirsten's arms and the policeman, Gould, conspires with Leo to have Jack killed in prison. After Phillip is discovered dead, Leo has Calgary taken away to the asylum and Leo is confronted by his children and Kirsten who show him the statuette as the murder weapon, not the decanter that had Jack's fingerprints on it. Later, Gwenda and the four remaining children are shown on the dock by the lake dressed up for the wedding, but with police divers searching the lake. They tell Gwenda Leo killed himself after admitting to killing their mother. Later, the children are seen rescuing Calgary from the asylum. Meanwhile, Leo is shown waking up in the bunker underneath the house and pleading to be let out whilst Kirsten walks away smiling.\n| LineColor       = 9F260A\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reshoots==\nAfter the drama had completed filming, the actor playing the part of Mickey Argyll ([[Ed Westwick]]) was accused of sexual assault in 2014 by two women.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Blankstein |first1=Andrew |last2=Ortiz |first2=Erik |title=Ed Westwick won't be prosecuted over sexual assault allegations |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/sexual-misconduct/actor-ed-westwick-will-not-be-prosecuted-over-sexual-assault-n895401 |accessdate=25 October 2019 |work=NBC News |date=27 July 2018 |language=en}}</ref> In the wake of other sexual assault scandals in 2017, the BBC decided to delay the broadcast pending an investigation into the allegations against Westwick.<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC One shelves drama after rape claims|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-41941904|accessdate=2 April 2018|work=BBC News|date=10 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen a third woman came forward to allege another 2014 assault by Westwick, the BBC auditioned a new actor and re-shot Westwick's part with [[Christian Cooke]].

Jack is arrested for the crime as his fingerprints are found on the presumed murder weapon, but is killed in jail before he can stand trial.\n\nEighteen months later, Leo is set to marry his secretary Gwenda Vaughn, much to his children's dismay. A man named Arthur Calgary arrives and provides an alibi for Jack: he had given him a ride at the time of the murder. Calgary claims to have been working in the Arctic since the murder and only just learned about it. Leo believes him to be a charlatan and Mickey threatens him. Calgary is later approached by Mary's husband, Philip Durrant, who has become embittered towards the Argylls after being paralyzed in a car crash and suggests they work together to extort money from the family. Calgary rejects his offer but promises to clear Jack's name. Flashbacks reveal that Rachel was a cruel and unloving mother who alienated her children, leaving any of them with motive to murder her.\n\nAs Calgary returns to the Argyll estate, a car tries to run him down but crashes and kills the driver, Bellamy Gould, the police detective who investigated Rachel's murder. Calgary meets with Leo and admits that he had lied about his background. He was a scientist who had worked on the atomic bomb and suffered a mental breakdown from guilt. The night of the murder, Calgary escaped from a mental asylum and was recaptured after giving Jack a ride, and says that he saw another on the road that night. Durrant, having antagonized many of the family members, is confronted by the killer, who murders him via a drug overdose.\n\nThe next morning, Durrant's body is discovered by Leo and Calgary. The Argyll children and Kirsten begin to piece together what happened. Flashbacks show the events leading up to the murder. Jack, in an attempt to goad his mother, had confronted her with the fact that Mickey and Tina had become lovers. She, in turn, reveals to him that Kirsten is his biological mother and Leo his father, which causes him to flee the house. Rachel discovers Leo having an affair with Gwenda and threatens to divorce him, so he bludgeons her to death with one of his Egyptian statuettes. Bellamy Gould helps frame Jack, out of rage at Jack's affair with his wife. To prevent Jack from revealing the truth about his parentage, Leo and Bellamy conspire to have him killed before he can stand trial.\n\nIn the present, Calgary is taken away to the mental hospital on Leo's recommendation. Kirsten and the children confront Leo with their knowledge of his crime. Later that day, the police search for Leo, who has disappeared. Some time later, the Argyll siblings visit Calgary at the mental hospital, while Kirsten checks on Leo, imprisoned in the family's bomb shelter.\n\n===Differences from the novel===\nJust like many other novels and stories by Agatha Christie, ''Ordeal by Innocence'' is set in the [[West Country]] of England.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Webb|first1=Claire|title=Where is BBC Agatha Christie drama Ordeal by Innocence filmed?|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2018-04-01/ordeal-by-innocence-bbc-location-guide-filming-house/|website=Radio Times|accessdate=3 April 2018|date=1 April 2018}}</ref> This production shifted the location to Scotland and it was filmed in and around [[Inverkip]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Coulter|first1=Paul John|title=Film star Bill Nighy set for Ardgowan House return to re-shoot Agatha Christie drama|url=http://www.greenocktelegraph.co.uk/news/greenock/15815746.Film_star_Bill_Nighy_set_for_Ardgowan_House_return_to_re_shoot_Agatha_Christie_drama/|accessdate=3 April 2018|work=Greenock Telegraph|date=10 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe family name in the book is Argyle, whereas it is spelt Argyll in the programme (although the pronunciation is the same).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zemboy|first1=James|title=The Detective Novels of Agatha Christie: A Reader's Guide|date=2008|publisher=McFarland & Co., Publishers|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-3914-0|page=312}}</ref> The main suspect character, Jack, is called Jacko in the book,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Billen|first1=Andrew|title=Ordeal by Innocence: the Christie Mystery that almost got away|work=The Times|issue=72497|date=31 March 2018|location=Saturday Review|page=4|issn=0140-0460}}</ref> and he dies in prison from pneumonia instead of being beaten to death.\n\nWith regard to characters, Kirsten Lindstrom, the family's housekeeper, is a middle-aged [[Nordic race|Nordic]] woman in the novel, a detail that plays a key role in the book's solution; in the miniseries, she is depicted as a [[Scotland|Scottish]] woman in her thirties, who is one of Rachel's foundlings. The subplot of her and Leo being the biological parents of Jack was created for the series. Dr Calgary is portrayed as mentally disturbed in this version, putting his testimony into doubt, whereas in the book his testimony is seen as reliable from the very beginning. Other characters, such as Gwenda Vaughan, Mary Durrant, and Hester Argyll, are portrayed less uncritically than they were in the novel: Gwenda is bossy and smug, Mary is deeply embittered, and Hester is a secret alcoholic.\n\nThe solution has also been radically altered. In the book, the murderer is Kirsten, who is seduced by Jacko and instructed to kill Rachel. Jacko then intends to use Calgary to establish an alibi for himself, but this backfires when the police are unable to locate him.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--Listed as per the credit listing on the broadcast programme; this follows [[MOS:TVCAST]] and the order SHOULD NOT be changed without a consensus-->\n{{div col}}\n*[[Bill Nighy]] as Leo Argyll,<ref name=\"Ordeal\">{{cite web|title=Episode 1, Series 1, Ordeal by Innocence - Credits - BBC One|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09yswj5/credits|website=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Meet the cast of Agatha Christie drama Ordeal by Innocence|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2018-04-01/meet-the-cast-of-agatha-christie-drama-ordeal-by-innocence/|website=Radio Times|accessdate=2 April 2018|date=1 April 2018}}</ref> father, Rachel's husband and engaged to Gwenda\n*[[Anthony Boyle]] as Jack Argyll, son and accused murderer\n*[[Anna Chancellor]] as Rachel Argyll,{{efn|[[Catherine Keener]] was originally cast in the role of Rachel Argyll.<ref name=\"Casting\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/ordeal-by-innocence-casting|title=Ordeal by Innocence casting|date=5 July 2017|access-date=4 April 2018|website=[[BBC]] Media Centre}}</ref>}} mother and murder victim\n*[[Morven Christie]] as Kirsten Lindstrom, housekeeper\n*[[Crystal Clarke]] as Tina Argyll, daughter\n*[[Christian Cooke]] as Mickey Argyll,{{efn|[[Ed Westwick]] was originally cast in the role of Mickey Argyll.<ref name=\"Casting\"/>}} son\n*[[Alice Eve]] as Gwenda Vaughn, former secretary engaged to Leo\n*[[Matthew Goode]] as Philip Durrant, Mary's husband\n*[[Ella Purnell]] as Hester Argyll, daughter\n*[[Eleanor Tomlinson]] as Mary Durrant, daughter and Philip's wife\n*[[Luke Treadaway]] as Doctor Arthur Calgary, Jack's potential alibi\n*[[Brian McCardie]] as Bellamy Gould, chief detective\n*Luke Murray as young Jack\n*Hayden Robertson as young Hester\n*Catriona McNicholl as young Mary\n*Abigail Conteh as young Tina\n*Rhys Lambert as young Mickey\n*[[Frances Grey (actress)|Frances Grey]] as Lydia Gould,<ref name=\"Ordeal\"/> Bellamy's wife\n*Sammy Moore as Clive<ref name=\"Episode 2\">{{cite web|title=Episode 2, Series 1, Ordeal by Innocence - Credits - BBC One|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09zg9dd/credits|website=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n*Sandy Welch as Doctor Edwin Morsuch<ref name=\"Episode 2\"/>\n*Sandy Batchelor as Simon<ref name=\"Episode 3\">{{cite web|title=Episode 3, Series 1, Ordeal by Innocence - Credits - BBC One|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b06rmw/credits|website=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n*[[Stuart McQuarrie]] as Doctor<ref name=\"Episode 3\"/>\n*Alexandra Finnie as young Kirsten<ref name=\"Episode 3\"/>\n{{div col end}}\n\n'''Changes in cast'''{{notelist}}\n\n==Production==\nThe mystery drama was adapted for the screen by [[Sarah Phelps]] who was behind the previous two Christie adaptations for the BBC over the Christmas period (''[[And Then There Were None (miniseries)|And Then There Were None]]'' and ''[[The Witness for the Prosecution (miniseries)|The Witness for the Prosecution]]'').<ref>{{cite news|last1=Billen|first1=Andrew|title=Ordeal by Innocence: the Christie Mystery that almost got away|work=The Times|issue=72497|date=31 March 2018|location=Saturday Review|pages=4&ndash;5|issn=0140-0460}}</ref> Phelps acknowledged changing some elements of the story, particularly the ending, and when asked about what the purists might think, she responded \"I don\u2019t give a [[bollocks]] about people saying it has to be pure.

As her body is being carried off on a stretcher, one of her five adopted children, Jack, is fingerprinted and talks the crime over with his dad, Leo Argyll, at the police station. Jack is later beaten to death in prison and the family buries him. Eighteen months later, Leo Argyll is preparing to marry his secretary, Gwenda Vaughan. This sees the return of son Mickey to the house and the arrival of a strange visitor, Dr Arthur Calgary, who reveals that he gave a lift to Jack at the time that Rachel Argyll was murdered, thus proving belatedly Jack's innocence. The delay in coming forward is explained away by Calgary being a physicist who has been in the [[Arctic]] on a research project. Later, whilst Calgary is sleeping in his hotel room, Mickey Argyll goes to question him and warn him off. At the hotel, Philip Durrant, the husband of Rachel's eldest adopted daughter, joins Calgary for dinner to propose a plan to make money from Calgary's revelation by selling the story to the newspapers. Durrant, a former [[Royal Air Force]] pilot who was disabled in a car crash, is shown as an abusive husband and a [[morphine]] addict. His wife Mary Durrant is also nasty to Tina Argyll and tells Gwenda that she will never replace her mother.\n| LineColor       = 9F260A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = Episode 2\n| DirectedBy      = Sandra Goldbacher\n| WrittenBy       = Sarah Phelps\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|04|08|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 6.11\n| ShortSummary    = Dr Calgary revisits Sunny Point and is spotted by Hester before Mickey forces him into a car and drives him to a railway station. He assaults Calgary and firmly puts him on a train and tells him to leave. Whilst in motion, Calgary gets the train to stop in the middle of nowhere so he can get off and go back. Over breakfast at Sunny Point, Phillip antagonises everyone and causes many arguments between the siblings. He points out that trying to hide the new found evidence from Calgary, would look suspicious to the police. Calgary later telephones the house with the housemaid, Kirsten, picking up the phone at the same time as Leo Argyll. Calgary informs Argyll that he is going to the police with Kirsten overhearing it all but saying nothing. Whilst Calgary is walking on the road, he is stopped by Bellamy Gould, Chief Constable and friend of Leo Argyll, who is driving a car. Gould questions Calgary's statement and seems to leave only to turn around and try to run Calgary down. Gould dies in trying, but Calgary survives. Calgary eventually gets a fair hearing form Leo Argyll and stays overnight at the house giving his version of events over dinner. The four remaining Argyll siblings meet later that night in the woods and argue about where they all were on the night of Rachel's murder and bicker in a display of sibling rivalry with Mary Durrant appearing as the most upset by events and how she feels the other children spoilt her relationship with Rachel. Near the end of the episode, Phillip Durrant is trying to leave the house when he hears footsteps behind him, he turns and says \"of course it's you!\". In the morning, Calgary reveals he wrote a detonation formula for the bombs dropped on [[Bombing of hiroshima|Hiroshima]] and [[Bombing of Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], this led him to go mad and be detained against his will at an asylum, not away at the Arctic, as he claimed in the first episode. On the night that Rachel died, he escaped and gave a lift to Jack. At breakfast, Calgary mentions that the shower in the Durrant's room has been going for some time. Leo Argyll and Calgary go to investigate and find Phillip Durrant dead on the floor of the shower with a hypodermic needle in his arm.\n| LineColor       = 9F260A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| Title           = Episode 3\n| DirectedBy      = Sandra Goldbacher\n| WrittenBy       = Sarah Phelps\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|04|15|df=y}}\n| Viewers         = 5.87\n| ShortSummary    = This episode runs over a very short time period but has flashbacks for all the characters and details their reasons for possibly being the killer of Rachel. Hester runs away from the house and when Rachel tracks her down, she drugs her and takes her to hospital where she instructs the doctor to terminate the pregnancy. Jack witnesses Mickey and Tina in a passionate embrace and uses this against Rachel. Later we see Rachel telling Tina that she is filth. When Rachel goes into Leo's study and discovers women's underwear on the floor, she goes to the very top floor of the house and catches Leo and Gwenda on the bed. She informs Gwenda that Leo has a habit of sleeping with the staff and that she is not the first. Gwenda retaliates in kind and Rachel smacks her across the face. Rachel tells Leo she is divorcing him and through the conversation, it is understood that the money is in her name and he will be penniless. When she leaves Leo's study, she is confronted by Mary who is upset that Rachel does not love her. Rachel tells her that she only adopted her because she was sad, and that it wasn't Mary's fault she could not stop her sadness. Jack witnesses this and is aghast, so he confronts his mother and she in turn tells him he is the son of Kirsten, the cook. Jack goes to see Kirsten and through another flashback, Jack is shown in the police station telling Leo that he knows that Leo is his father and that Kirsten is his mother. He tells Leo acidly that he will destroy him and ruin his life. Rachel is then shown being hit on the head with an Egyptian statuette by Leo and soon afterwards, Kirsten goes in to confront her about telling Jack of his parentage. Rachel dies in Kirsten's arms and the policeman, Gould, conspires with Leo to have Jack killed in prison. After Phillip is discovered dead, Leo has Calgary taken away to the asylum and Leo is confronted by his children and Kirsten who show him the statuette as the murder weapon, not the decanter that had Jack's fingerprints on it. Later, Gwenda and the four remaining children are shown on the dock by the lake dressed up for the wedding, but with police divers searching the lake. They tell Gwenda Leo killed himself after admitting to killing their mother. Later, the children are seen rescuing Calgary from the asylum. Meanwhile, Leo is shown waking up in the bunker underneath the house and pleading to be let out whilst Kirsten walks away smiling.\n| LineColor       = 9F260A\n}}\n}}\n\n==Reshoots following allegations against Westwick==\nAfter the drama had completed filming, the actor playing the part of Mickey Argyll ([[Ed Westwick]]) was accused of sexual assault in 2014 by two women.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Blankstein |first1=Andrew |last2=Ortiz |first2=Erik |title=Ed Westwick won't be prosecuted over sexual assault allegations |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/sexual-misconduct/actor-ed-westwick-will-not-be-prosecuted-over-sexual-assault-n895401 |accessdate=25 October 2019 |work=NBC News |date=27 July 2018 |language=en}}</ref> In the wake of other sexual assault scandals in 2017, the BBC decided to delay the broadcast pending an investigation into the allegations against Westwick.<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC One shelves drama after rape claims|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-41941904|accessdate=2 April 2018|work=BBC News|date=10 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen a third woman came forward to allege another 2014 assault by Westwick, the BBC auditioned a new actor and re-shot Westwick's part with [[Christian Cooke]].

This \"cultural decade\" is more loosely defined than the actual decade, beginning around [[1963]] with the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy assassination]] and ending around [[1974]] with the [[Watergate scandal]].<ref name=\"Barth84Exhaustion\">[[John Barth]] (1984) intro to ''[[The Literature of Exhaustion]]'', in ''The Friday Book''.</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/05/books/05masl.html| work= [[The New York Times]] | title= Brokaw Explores Another Turning Point, the '60s  | date= 5 November 2007 | accessdate= 26 August 2011 | author = [[Janet Maslin|Maslin, Janet]]}}</ref>\n\n\"The Sixties\", as they are known in both scholarship and popular culture, is a term used by historians, journalists, and other academics to describe the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] and revolution in social norms about clothing, music, drugs, dress, sexuality, formalities, and schooling; and in others to denounce the decade as one of irresponsible excess, flamboyance, and decay of social order. The decade was also labeled the [[Swinging London|Swinging Sixties]] because of the fall or relaxation of social taboos that occurred during this time, but also because of the emergence of a wide range of music; from a folk music revival, to the Beatles revolution, to the serious lyrics of Bob Dylan and Paul Simon. Norms of all kinds were broken down, especially in regards to civil rights and expectations the men would go off to meaningless wars.\n\nCommentator [[Christopher Booker]]<ref>[[Christopher Booker]]: ''The Neophiliacs:  A Study of the Revolution in English Life in the Fifties and Sixties'', Gambit Incorporated, London, 1970</ref> described this era as a classical [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] nightmare cycle, where a rigid culture, unable to contain the demands for greater [[Individualism|individual freedom]], broke free of the social constraints of the previous age through extreme deviation from the norm. He charts the rise, success, fall/nightmare and explosion in the London scene of the 1960s. Several [[Western culture|Western]] nations such as the United States, United Kingdom, France, and [[West Germany]] turned to the [[Left-wing politics|political left]] in the early and mid-1960s.\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, war-ravaged Europe had largely finished reconstruction and began a tremendous economic boom. World War II had brought about a huge leveling of social classes in which the remnants of the old feudal gentry disappeared. There was a major expansion of the middle class in western European countries and by the 1960s, many working-class people in Western Europe could afford a radio, television, refrigerator, and motor vehicle. Meanwhile, the East such as the Soviet union and other Warsaw Pact countries were improving quickly after rebuilding from WWII. Real GDP growth averaged 6% a year during the second half of the decade. Thus, the overall worldwide economic trend in the 1960s was one of prosperity, expansion of the middle class, and the proliferation of new domestic technology.\n\nThe [[Cold War|confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union]] dominated geopolitics during the '60s, with the struggle expanding into developing nations in Latin America, Africa, and Asia as the Soviet Union moved from being a regional to a truly global [[superpower]] and began vying for influence in the developing world. After President [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy's assassination]], direct tensions between the US and Soviet Union cooled and the superpower confrontation moved into a contest for control of the Third World, a battle characterized by [[proxy war]]s, funding of insurgencies, and puppet governments.\n\nIn response to [[nonviolent]] [[direct action]] campaigns from groups like the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]], a [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]]<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842353-7,00.html|title=The Economy: We Are All Keynesians Now|date=31 December 1965|accessdate=1 January 2011|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|quote=Keynesianism made its biggest breakthrough under John Kennedy, who, as Arthur Schlesinger reports in A Thousand Days, \"was unquestionably the first Keynesian President.\"}}</ref> and staunch [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], pushed for social reforms.  Kennedy's assassination in 1963 was a shock. Liberal reforms were finally passed under [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] including civil rights for [[African Americans]] and healthcare for [[Medicare (United States)|the elderly]] and [[Medicaid|the poor]]. Despite his large-scale [[Great Society]] programs, Johnson was increasingly reviled by the [[New Left]] at home and abroad. The heavy-handed American role in the [[Vietnam War]] outraged student protestors around the globe.

Unlike other European nations, the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portuguese regime]] did not leave its African colonies, or the overseas provinces, during the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1960s, various armed independence movements, most prominently led by [[communist]]-led parties who cooperated under the [[CONCP]] umbrella and pro-U.S. groups, became active in these areas, most notably in [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], and [[Portuguese Guinea]].

Mao alleged that \"liberal bourgeois\" elements were permeating the party and society at large and that they wanted to restore [[capitalism]]. Mao insisted that these elements be removed through post-revolutionary [[class struggle]] by mobilizing the thoughts and actions of China's youth, who formed [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] groups around the country. The movement subsequently spread into the military, urban workers, and the party leadership itself. Although Mao himself officially declared the Cultural Revolution to have ended in 1969, the power struggles and political instability between 1969 and the arrest of the [[Gang of Four]] in 1976 are now also widely regarded as part of the Revolution.\n*The [[Naxalite]] movement in India began in 1967 with an [[Naxalbari uprising|armed uprising]] of tribals against local landlords in the village of [[Naxalbari]], [[West Bengal]], led by certain leaders of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]]. The movement was influenced by [[Maoism|Mao Zedong's ideology]] and spread to many tribal districts in Eastern India, gaining strong support among the radical urban youth. After counter-insurgency operations by the police, military and paramilitary forces, the movement fragmented but is still active in many districts.\n* [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland began with the rise of the [[Northern Ireland civil rights movement]] in the mid-1960s, the conflict continued into the later 1990s.\n* The [[Compton's Cafeteria Riot]] occurred in August 1966 in the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California|Tenderloin]] district of San Francisco. This incident was one of the first recorded [[transgender]] riots in United States history, preceding the more famous 1969 Stonewall Riots in New York City by three years.\n* The [[Stonewall riots]] occurred in June 1969 in New York City. The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations against a police raid that took place in the [[Stonewall Inn]], in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of New York City. They are frequently cited as the first instance in American history when people in the homosexual community fought back against a government-sponsored system that persecuted sexual minorities, and they have become the defining event that marked the start of the [[gay rights movement]] in the United States and around the world.\n* In 1967, the [[National Farmers Organization]] withheld milk supplies for 15 days as part of an effort to induce a quota system to stabilize prices.\n* [[May 1968 events in France|The May 1968 student and worker uprisings in France]].\n* Mass socialist or Communist movement in most European countries (particularly France and Italy), with which the student-based new left was able to forge a connection. The most spectacular manifestation of this was the [[May 1968 in France|May]] student revolt of 1968 in Paris that linked up with a general strike of ten million workers called by the trade unions; and for a few days seemed capable of overthrowing the government of [[Charles de Gaulle]]. De Gaulle went off to visit French troops in Germany to check on their loyalty. Major concessions were won for trade union rights, higher minimum wages and better working conditions.\n* University students protested in the hundreds of thousands against the Vietnam War in London, Paris, Berlin and Rome.\n* In Eastern Europe students also drew inspiration from the protests in the West. In Poland and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] they protested against restrictions on free speech by [[communist]] regimes.\n* The [[Tlatelolco massacre]] \u2013 was a government massacre of student and civilian protesters and bystanders that took place during the afternoon and night of 2 October 1968, in the [[Plaza de las Tres Culturas]] in the [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]] section of Mexico City.\n\n===Coups===\n{{Main|List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts#1960\u20131969}}\nProminent [[coups d'\u00e9tat]] of the decade included:\n* On 27 May 1960, a coup in [[Turkey]] led by [[Cemal G\u00fcrsel]] and [[Cemal Madano\u011flu]] overthrew the government of [[Adnan Menderes]].\n* On 16 May 1961, a coup in [[South Korea]] led by army officer [[Park Chung-hee]] made the establishment of temporary military rule.\n* In 1963, a coup in [[South Viet Nam]] leads to the death of President [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m]] and the establishment of temporary military rule.\n* On 21 April 1967, in Greece a group of colonels established a [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|military dictatorship]] for seven years.\n* In 1968, a coup in Iraq led to the overthrow of [[Abdul Rahman Arif]] by the [[Arab socialism|Arab Socialist]] [[Baath Party]].\n* On 1 September 1969, a small group of military officers led by the army officer [[Muammar Gaddafi]] overthrows monarchy in [[Libya]].\n\n===Nuclear threats===\n[[File:Cuban missiles.jpg|thumb|150px|Pictures of Soviet missile silos in [[Cuba]], taken by United States spy planes on 1 November 1962.]]\n* The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (16\u201328 October 1962) \u2013 a near-military confrontation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union about the presence of Soviet missiles in [[Cuba]].

President Kennedy had plans to restore Sino-US relations, but his assassination, the war in Vietnam, and the Cultural Revolution put an end to that. Not until Richard Nixon took office in 1969 was there another opportunity.\n* Following Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's expulsion in 1964, Sino-Soviet relations devolved into open hostility. The Chinese were deeply disturbed by the Soviet suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968, as the latter now claimed the right to intervene in any country it saw as deviating from the correct path of socialism. Finally, in March 1969, armed clashes took place along the Sino-Soviet border in Manchuria. This drove the Chinese to restore relations with the U.S., as Mao Zedong decided that the Soviet Union was a much greater threat against them.\n\n=====India=====\n* In India a literary and cultural movement started in Calcutta, Patna, and other cities by a group of writers and painters who called themselves \"Hungryalists\", or members of the [[Hungry generation]].

About 80% of the city was destroyed.\n* 1963 \u2013 [[Vajont Dam#Landslide and wave|Vajont dam disaster]] \u2013 The Vajont dam flood in Italy was caused by a mountain sliding in the dam, and causing a flood wave that killed approximately 2,000 people in the towns in its path.\n* 1964 \u2013 The [[1964 Alaska earthquake|Good Friday earthquake]], the most powerful earthquake recorded in the U.S. and North America, struck [[Alaska]] and killed 143 people.\n* 1965 \u2013 [[Hurricane Betsy]] caused severe damage to the U.S. Gulf Coast, especially in the state of [[Louisiana]].\n* 1969 \u2013 The [[Cuyahoga River]] caught fire in Ohio. Fires had erupted on the river many times, including 22 June 1969, when a river fire captured the attention of Time magazine, which described the Cuyahoga as the river that \"oozes rather than flows\" and in which a person \"does not drown but decays.\" This helped spur legislative action on water pollution control resulting in the Clean Water Act, Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, and the creation of the federal Environmental Protection Agency.\n* 1969 \u2013 [[Hurricane Camille]] hit the U.S. Gulf Coast at Category 5 Status. To date it is the strongest hurricane ever recorded at landfall in means of sustained windspeed in the Atlantic Basin, reaching sustained winds of 190&nbsp;mph and a low pressure of 905 mbs. It is one of only three hurricanes in the Atlantic to ever make landfall at Category 5 Status and one of only four hurricanes worldwide to reach a maximum sustained windspeed of 190&nbsp;mph.\n\n'''Non-natural:'''\n* On 16 December 1960, a [[United Airlines]] DC-8 and a [[Trans World Airlines]] Lockheed Constellation [[1960 New York mid-air collision|collided over New York City]] and crashed, killing 134 people.\n* On 15 February 1961, [[Sabena Flight 548]] crashed on its way to Brussels, Belgium, killing all 72 passengers on board and 1 person on the ground. Among those killed were all 18 members of the US figure skating team, on their way to the World Championships. \n* On 16 March 1962, [[Flying Tiger Line Flight 739]], a Lockheed Super Constellation, inexplicably disappeared over the Western Pacific, leaving all 107 on board presumed dead.

This created a \"counterculture\" that sparked a social revolution throughout much of the Western world. It began in the United States as a reaction against the conservatism and social conformity of the 1950s, and the U.S. government's extensive military intervention in Vietnam. The youth involved in the popular social aspects of the movement became known as [[hippies]]. These groups created a movement toward liberation in society, including the [[sexual revolution]], questioning authority and government, and demanding more freedoms and rights for women and minorities. The [[Underground Press]], a widespread, eclectic collection of newspapers served as a unifying medium for the counterculture. The movement was also marked by the first widespread, socially accepted drug use (including [[LSD]] and [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]) and [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] music.\n\n===Anti-war movement===\n{{main|Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War}}\n[[File:Vietnamdem.jpg|thumb|left|A demonstrator offers a flower to military police guarding [[the Pentagon]] during the [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam]]'s 21 October 1967 \"March on the Pentagon\"]]\nThe war in Vietnam would eventually lead to a commitment of over half a million American troops, resulting in over 58,500 American deaths and producing a large-scale antiwar movement in the United States. As late as the end of 1965, few Americans protested the American involvement in Vietnam, but as the war dragged on and the body count continued to climb, civil unrest escalated. Students became a powerful and disruptive force and university campuses sparked a national debate over the war. As the movement's ideals spread beyond college campuses, doubts about the war also began to appear within the administration itself. A mass movement began rising in opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], ending in the massive [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Moratorium]] protests in 1969, as well as the movement of resistance to [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] (\"the Draft\") for the war.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nThe [[antiwar movement]] was initially based on the older 1950s [[Peace movement]], heavily influenced by the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]], but by the mid-1960s it outgrew this and became a broad-based mass movement centered in universities and churches: one kind of protest was called a \"[[sit-in]]\".  Other terms heard in the United States included \"[[the Draft]]\", \"[[draft dodger]]\", \"[[conscientious objector]]\", and \"[[Vietnam veteran|Vietnam vet]]\". Voter age-limits were challenged by the phrase: \"If you're old enough to die for your country, you're old enough to vote.\"\n\n===Civil rights movement===\n{{Main|Civil rights movement}}\n[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march posing in front of the statue of Abraham Lincoln... - NARA - 542063.tif|thumb|240px|Leaders of the [[civil rights movement]]'s 28 August 1963, [[March on Washington]] in front of the [[Abraham Lincoln (Lincoln Memorial)|statue of Abraham Lincoln]]]]\n\nBeginning in the mid-1950s and continuing into the late 1960s, African-Americans in the United States aimed at outlawing [[racism|racial discrimination]] against [[African American|black American]]s and [[Suffrage|voting rights]] to them. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1955 and 1968, particularly in the South. The emergence of the [[Black Power movement]], which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the civil rights movement to include racial dignity, [[Economy of the United States|economic]] and [[politics of the United States|political]] [[self-sufficiency]], and [[anti-imperialism]].\n\nThe movement was characterized by major campaigns of [[civil resistance]]. Between 1955 and 1968, acts of [[civil disobedience]] and [[Nonviolent action|nonviolent]] protest produced crisis situations between activists and government authorities. Federal, state, and local governments, businesses, and communities often had to respond immediately to these situations that highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of protest and/or civil disobedience included [[boycott]]s such as the successful [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] (1955\u20131956) in Alabama; \"[[sit-in]]s\" such as the influential [[Greensboro sit-ins]] (1960) in North Carolina; [[Demonstration (people)|marches]], such as the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] (1965) in Alabama; and a wide range of other nonviolent activities.\n\nNoted legislative achievements during this phase of the civil rights movement were passage of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],<ref name=\"cra64\">{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21|title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 - CRA - Title VII - Equal Employment Opportunities - 42 US Code Chapter 21}}</ref> that banned discrimination based on \"race, color, religion, or national origin\" in employment practices and public accommodations; the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], that restored and protected voting rights; the [[Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965]], that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]], that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.\n\n===Hispanic and Chicano movement===\nAnother large ethnic minority group, the [[Mexican-Americans]], are among other [[Hispanics]] in the U.S. who fought to end racial discrimination and socioeconomic disparity. The largest Mexican-American populations was in the [[Southwestern United States]], such as [[California]] with over 1 million ''[[Chicanos]]'' in Los Angeles alone, and [[Texas]] where [[Jim Crow]] laws included Mexican-Americans as \"non-white\" in some instances to be legally segregated.\n\nSocially, the [[Chicano Movement]] addressed what it perceived to be negative [[ethnic stereotype]]s of Mexicans in mass media and the American consciousness. It did so through the creation of works of literary and visual art that validated Mexican-American ethnicity and culture. Chicanos fought to end social stigmas such as the usage of the Spanish language and advocated official [[bilingualism]] in federal and state governments.\n\nThe Chicano Movement also addressed discrimination in public and private institutions. Early in the twentieth century, Mexican Americans formed organizations to protect themselves from discrimination. One of those organizations, the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]], was formed in 1929 and remains active today.<ref>[http://www.lulac.org/about/history.html History | LULAC-League of United Latin American Citizens<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe movement gained momentum after World War II when groups such as the [[American G.I. Forum]], which was formed by returning Mexican American veterans, joined in the efforts by other civil rights organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americangiforum.org/about.cfm |title=americangiforum.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706223234/http://www.americangiforum.org/about.cfm |archivedate=6 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\nMexican-American civil-rights activists achieved several major legal victories including the 1947 ''[[Mendez v. Westminster]]'' [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling which declared that segregating children of \"Mexican and Latin descent\" was unconstitutional and the 1954 ''[[Hernandez v. Texas]]'' ruling which declared that Mexican Americans and other racial groups in the United States were entitled to equal protection under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latinola.com/story.php?story=432|title=LatinoLA \u2013 Hollywood :: Mendez v.

Texas \u2013 The Oyez Project at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law|work=oyez.org}}</ref>\n\nThe most prominent civil-rights organization in the Mexican-American community, the [[Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (MALDEF), was founded in 1968.<ref>[http://www.maldef.org/about/index.htm MALDEF{{spaced ndash}} About Us<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422002948/http://www.maldef.org/about/index.htm |date=22 April 2008 }}</ref> Although modeled after the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]], MALDEF has also taken on many of the functions of other organizations, including political advocacy and training of local leaders.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]] in the U.S. mainland fought against racism, police brutality and socioeconomic problems affecting the three million Puerto Ricans residing in the 50 states. The main concentration of the population was in New York City.\n\nIn the 1960s and the following 1970s, Hispanic-American culture was on the rebound like ethnic music, foods, culture and identity both became popular and assimilated into the American mainstream. Spanish-language television networks, radio stations and newspapers increased in presence across the country, especially in U.S.\u2013Mexican border towns and East Coast cities like New York City, and the growth of the [[Cuban American]] community in [[Miami, Florida]].\n\nThe multitude of discrimination at this time represented an inhuman side to a society that in the 1960s was upheld as a world and industry leader. The issues of civil rights and warfare became major points of reflection of virtue and democracy, what once was viewed as traditional and inconsequential was now becoming the significance in the turning point of a culture.  A document known as the Port Huron Statement exemplifies these two conditions perfectly in its first hand depiction, \"while these and other problems either directly oppressed us or rankled our consciences and became our own subjective concerns, we began to see complicated and disturbing paradoxes in our surrounding America. The declaration \"all men are created equal...\" rang hollow before the facts of Negro life in the South and the big cities of the North. The proclaimed peaceful intentions of the United States contradicted its economic and military investments in the Cold War status quo.\" These intolerable issues became too visible to ignore therefore its repercussions were feared greatly, the realization that we as individuals take the responsibility for encounter and resolution in our lives issues was an emerging idealism of the 1960s.\n\n===Second-wave feminism===\n{{Main|Second-wave feminism}}\nA second wave of feminism in the United States and around the world gained momentum in the early 1960s. While the first wave of the early 20th century was centered on gaining suffrage and overturning ''de jure'' inequalities, the second wave was focused on changing cultural and social norms and ''de facto'' inequalities associated with women. At the time, a woman's place was generally seen as being in the home, and they were excluded from many jobs and professions. In the U.S., a [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women]] found discrimination against women in the workplace and every other aspect of life, a revelation which launched two decades of prominent women-centered legal reforms (i.e., the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], [[Title IX]], etc.) which broke down the last remaining legal barriers to women's personal freedom and professional success.\n\nFeminists took to the streets, marching and protesting, authoring books and debating to change social and political views that limited women. In 1963, with [[Betty Friedan]]'s book, ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', the role of women in society, and in public and private life was questioned. By 1966, the movement was beginning to grow in size and power as women's group spread across the country and Friedan, along with other feminists, founded the [[National Organization for Women]]. In 1968, \"[[Women's Liberation]]\" became a household term as, for the first time, the new women's movement eclipsed the [[civil rights movement]] when [[New York Radical Women]], led by [[Robin Morgan]], [[Miss America protest|protested the annual Miss America pageant]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. The movement continued throughout the next decades. [[Gloria Steinem]] was a key feminist.\n\n===Gay rights movement===\n{{Main|Gay Liberation|LGBT social movements}}\nThe United States, in the middle of a social revolution, led the world in LGBT rights in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Inspired by the civil-rights movement and the women's movement, early gay-rights pioneers had begun, by the 1960s, to build a movement.  These groups were rather conservative in their practices, emphasizing that ''gay men and women are no different from those who are straight'' and deserve full equality.  This philosophy would be dominant again after [[AIDS]], but by the very end of the 1960s, the movement's goals would change and become more radical, demanding a right to be different, and encouraging [[gay pride]].\n\nThe symbolic birth of the [[gay rights movement]] would not come until the decade had almost come to a close.  Gays were not allowed by law to congregate.  Gay establishments such as the [[Stonewall Inn]] in New York City were routinely raided by the police to arrest gay people.  On a night in late June 1969, LGBT people resisted, for the first time, a police raid, and rebelled openly in the streets.  This uprising called the [[Stonewall Riots]] began a new period of the LGBT rights movement that in the next decade would cause dramatic change both inside the LGBT community and in the mainstream American culture.\n\n===New Left===\nThe rapid rise of a \"[[New Left]]\" applied the class perspective of [[Marxism]] to postwar America, but had little organizational connection with older Marxist organizations such as the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], and even went as far as to reject organized labor as the basis of a unified left-wing movement. Sympathetic to the ideology of [[C. Wright Mills]], the New Left differed from the traditional left in its resistance to dogma and its emphasis on personal as well as societal change. [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) became the organizational focus of the New Left and was the prime mover behind the opposition to the War in Vietnam. The 1960s left also consisted of ephemeral campus-based [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]], [[Maoism|Maoist]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] groups, some of which by the end of the 1960s had turned to [[Militant (word)|militancy]].\n\n===Crime===\nThe 1960s was also associated with a large increase in crime and urban unrest of all types. Between 1960 and 1969 reported incidences of violent crime per 100,000 people in the United States nearly doubled and have yet to return to the levels of the early 1960s.<ref>[https://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-23.pdf U.S. Census Bureau Data https://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-23.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924134627/http://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-23.pdf |date=24 September 2015 }}</ref> Large riots broke out in many cities like [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], Los Angeles, New York City, [[Newark, New Jersey]], [[Oakland, California]] and Washington, D.C. By the end of the decade, politicians like [[George Wallace]] and [[Richard Nixon]] campaigned on restoring law and order to a nation troubled with the new unrest.\n\n==Science and technology==\n\n===Science===\n\n====Space exploration====\n[[File:As08-16-2593.jpg|right|thumb|250px|On 21 December 1968 the [[Apollo 8]] crew took a picture, for the first time in history, of the entire Earth]]\n[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Apollo 11]] mission landed the first humans on the Moon in July 1969.]]\nThe [[Space Race]] between the United States and the Soviet Union dominated the 1960s. The Soviets sent the first man, [[Yuri Gagarin]], into [[outer space]] during the [[Vostok 1]] mission on 12 April 1961 and scored a host of other successes, but by the middle of the decade the U.S. was taking the lead. In May 1961, President Kennedy set the goal for the United States of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s.\n\nIn June 1963, [[Valentina Tereshkova]] became the first woman in space during the [[Vostok 6]] mission. In 1965, Soviets launched the first probe to hit another planet of the [[Solar System]] ([[Venus]]), [[Venera 3]], and the first probe to make a soft landing on and transmit from the surface of the Moon, [[Luna 9]]. In March 1966, the Soviet Union launched [[Luna 10]], which became the first [[space probe]] to enter orbit around the Moon, and in September, 1968, [[Zond 5]] flew the first terrestrial beings, including two tortoises, to circumnavigate the Moon.\n\nThe deaths of astronauts [[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger B. Chaffee]] in the [[Apollo 1]] fire on 27 January 1967 put a temporary hold on the U.S. space program, but afterward progress was steady, with the [[Apollo 8]] crew ([[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell]], [[William Anders]]) being the first manned mission to orbit another celestial body (the Moon) during Christmas of 1968.\n\nOn 20 July 1969, [[Apollo 11]], the [[Moon landing|first human spaceflight landed on the Moon]]. Launched on 16 July 1969, it carried mission Commander [[Neil Armstrong]], Command Module Pilot [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], and the Lunar Module Pilot [[Buzz Aldrin]]. Apollo 11 fulfilled President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of reaching the Moon by the end of the 1960s, which he had expressed during a speech given before a joint session of Congress on 25 May 1961: \"I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\"\n\nThe Soviet program lost its sense of direction with the death of chief designer [[Sergey Korolyov]] in 1966. Political pressure, conflicts between different design bureaus, and engineering problems caused by an inadequate budget would doom the Soviet attempt to land men on the Moon.\n\nA succession of unmanned American and Soviet probes traveled to the Moon, [[Venus]], and [[Mars]] during the 1960s, and commercial satellites also came into use.\n\n====Other scientific developments====\n[[File:Antibabypille.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[birth control pill]] was introduced in 1960.]]\n* 1960 \u2013 The female birth-control contraceptive, [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], was released in the United States after [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval.\n* 1963 - The measles vaccine was released after being approved by the FDA\n* 1964 - The discovery and confirmation of the [[Cosmic microwave background]] in 1964 secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe. \n* 1965 \u2013 [[AstroTurf]] introduced.\n* 1967 \u2013 First [[heart transplantation]] operation by Professor [[Christiaan Barnard]] in South Africa.\n* 1967 \u2013 Discovery of the first known [[pulsar]] (a rapidly spinning [[neutron star]]).\n\n===Technology===\n\n====Automobiles====\nAs the 1960s began, American cars showed a rapid rejection of 1950s styling excess, and would remain relatively clean and boxy for the entire decade. The horsepower race reached its climax in the late 1960s, with [[muscle cars]] sold by most makes. The compact [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Ford Mustang]], launched in 1964, was one of the decade's greatest successes. The \"[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]\" American automakers enjoyed their highest ever sales and profitability in the 1960s, but the demise of [[Studebaker]] in 1966 left [[American Motors Corporation]] as the last significant independent. The decade would see the car market split into different size classes for the first time, and model lineups now included [[Compact car|compact]] and [[Mid-size car|mid-sized]] cars in addition to [[Full-size car|full-sized]] ones.\n\nThe popular modern hatchback, with front-wheel-drive and a two-box configuration, was born in 1965 with the introduction of the [[Renault 16]], many of this car's design principles live on in its modern counterparts: a large rear opening incorporating the rear window, foldable rear seats to extend boot space. The [[Mini]], released in 1959, had first popularised the front wheel drive two-box configuration, but technically was not a hatchback as it had a fold-down bootlid.\n\nJapanese cars also began to gain acceptance in the Western market, and popular economy models such as the [[Toyota Corolla]], [[Datsun 510]], and the first popular Japanese sports car, the [[Datsun 240Z]], were released in the mid- to late-1960s.\n\n====Electronics and communications====\n[[File:60s tech.jpg|thumb|Examples of 1960s technology, including two rotary-dial telephones and a Kodak camera.]]\n* 1960 \u2013 The first working laser was demonstrated in May by [[Theodore Maiman]] at [[Hughes Research Laboratories]].\n* 1960 \u2013 [[Tony Hoare]] announces the [[Quicksort]] [[algorithm]], the most common sorter on computers.\n* 1961 \u2013 [[Unimate]], the first [[industrial robot]], was introduced.\n* 1962 \u2013 First transatlantic satellite broadcast via the [[Telstar]] satellite.\n* 1962 \u2013 The first computer video game, ''[[Spacewar!]]'', was invented.\n* 1962 \u2013 Red [[LED]]s were developed.\n* 1963 \u2013 The first [[Geosynchronous satellite|geosynchronous communications satellite]], '''[[Syncom 2]]''' is launched.\n* 1963 \u2013 First transpacific satellite broadcast via the [[Relay 1]] satellite.\n* 1963 \u2013 [[Touch-Tone]] telephones introduced.\n* 1963 \u2013 [[Sketchpad]] was the first touch interactive [[computer graphics]] program.\n* 1963 \u2013 The [[Nottingham]] Electronic Valve company produced the first home [[Videocassette recorder|video recorder]] called the \"Telcan\".\n* 1964 \u2013 [[8-track tape]] audio format was developed.\n* 1964 \u2013 The [[Compact Cassette]] was introduced.\n* 1964 \u2013 The first successful [[Minicomputer]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s 12-bit [[PDP-8]], was marketed.\n* 1964 \u2013 The [[programming language]] [[BASIC]] was created.\n* 1964 \u2013 The world's first [[supercomputer]], the [[CDC 6600]], was introduced.\n* 1964 \u2013 [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] released [[Integrated Circuit|IC]]s with [[Dual in-line package|dual in-line packaging]].\n* 1967 \u2013 [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] broadcast color television systems started publicly transmitting in Europe.\n* 1967 \u2013 The first [[Automatic Teller Machine]] was opened in [[Barclays Bank]], London.\n* 1968 \u2013 [[Ralph Baer]] developed his [[Brown Box]] (a working prototype of the Magnavox Odyssey).\n* 1968 \u2013 The [[The Mother of All Demos|first public demonstration]] of the [[computer mouse]], the [[paper paradigm]] [[Graphical user interface]], [[video conference|video conferencing]], [[teleconference|teleconferencing]], [[email]], and [[hypertext]].\n* 1969 \u2013 [[Arpanet]], the research-oriented prototype of the [[Internet]], was introduced.\n* 1969 \u2013 [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] invented at AT&T [[Bell Labs]], used as the electronic imager in still and video cameras.\n\n==Additional notable worldwide events==\n* The [[Manson Murders]] occurred between 8\u201310 August 1969, when actress [[Sharon Tate]], coffee heiress [[Abigail Folger]], and several others were brutally murdered in the Tate residence by [[Charles Manson]]'s \"family.\" [[Rosemary LaBianca]] & [[Leno LaBianca]] were also murdered by the Manson family the following night.\n* Canada celebrated its 100th anniversary of [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1967 by hosting [[Expo 67]], the World's Fair, in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. During the anniversary celebrations, French president [[Charles De Gaulle]] visited Canada, and caused a considerable uproar by declaring his support for Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois independence.\n\n==Popular culture==\nThe counterculture movement dominated the second half of the 1960s, its most famous moments being the [[Summer of Love]] in San Francisco in 1967, and the [[Woodstock Festival]] in [[upstate New York]] in 1969. [[Psychedelic drugs]], especially [[LSD]], were widely used medicinally, spiritually and recreationally throughout the late 1960s, and were popularized by [[Timothy Leary]] with his slogan \"[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]\". [[Ken Kesey]] and the [[Merry Pranksters]] also played a part in the role of \"turning heads on\". [[Psychedelia|Psychedelic]] influenced the music, artwork and films of the decade, and a number of prominent musicians died of drug overdoses (see [[27 Club]]). There was a growing interest in Eastern religions and philosophy, and many attempts were made to found communes, which varied from supporting free love to religious puritanism.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:The Beatles i H\u00f6torgscity 1963.jpg|280px|right|thumb|The arrival of the [[Beatles]] in the US during 1964, and particularly their appearance on television's ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', marked the beginning of the [[British invasion]] in the history of music, in which a large number of rock and pop music acts from the United Kingdom gained enormous popularity in the US]]\n{{Quote box\n| quote = \"The 60's{{sic}} were a leap in human consciousness.

As the 1960s began, the major rock 'n' roll stars of the '50s such as [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]] had dropped off the charts and popular music in the U.S. came to be dominated by [[girl group]]s, [[surf music]], novelty pop songs, clean-cut teen idols, and [[Motown]] music. Another important change in music during the early 1960s was the [[American folk music revival]] which introduced [[Bob Dylan]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[The Kingston Trio]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Odetta]], and many other [[singer-songwriters]] to the public.\n\n[[Girl group]]s and female singers, such as [[the Shirelles]], [[Betty Everett]], [[Little Eva]], the [[The Dixie Cups|Dixie Cups]], the [[Ronettes]], and [[the Supremes]] dominated the charts in the early 1960s. This style consisted typically of light pop themes about teenage romance and lifestyles, backed by vocal harmonies and a strong rhythm. Most girl groups were [[African-American]], but white girl groups and singers, such as [[Lesley Gore]], the [[The Angels (American group)|Angels]], and the [[The Shangri-Las|Shangri-Las]] also emerged during  this period.\n\nAround the same time, record producer [[Phil Spector]] began producing girl groups and created a new kind of pop music production that came to be known as the [[Wall of Sound]]. This style emphasized higher budgets and more elaborate arrangements, and more melodramatic musical themes in place of a simple, light-hearted pop sound. Spector's innovations became integral to the growing sophistication of popular music from 1965 onward.\n\nAlso during the early '60s, [[surf rock]] emerged, a rock subgenre that was centered in Southern California and based on beach and surfing themes, in addition to the usual songs about teenage romance and innocent fun. [[The Beach Boys]] quickly became the premier surf rock band and almost completely and single-handedly overshadowed the many lesser-known artists in the subgenre. Surf rock reached its peak in 1963\u20131965 before gradually being overtaken by bands influenced by the [[British Invasion]] and the counterculture movement.\n\nThe [[car song]] also emerged as a rock subgenre in the early 60s, which focused on teenagers' fascination with [[car culture]]. The Beach Boys also dominated this subgenre, along with the duo [[Jan and Dean]]. Such notable songs include \"[[Little Deuce Coupe (song)|Little Deuce Coupe]],\" \"[[409 (song)|409]],\" and \"[[Shut Down (The Beach Boys song)|Shut Down]],\" all by the Beach Boys; [[Jan and Dean]]'s \"[[Little Old Lady from Pasadena]]\" and \"[[Drag City (song)|Drag City]],\" [[Ronny and the Daytonas]]' \"[[Little GTO]],\" and many others. Like girl groups and surf rock, car songs also became overshadowed by the British Invasion and the counterculture movement.\n\nThe early 1960s also saw the golden age of another rock subgenre, the [[teen tragedy song]], which focused on lost teen romance caused by sudden death, mainly in [[traffic accident]]s. Such songs included [[Mark Dinning]]'s \"[[Teen Angel (song)|Teen Angel]],\" [[Ray Peterson]]'s \"[[Tell Laura I Love Her]],\" [[Jan and Dean]]'s \"[[Dead Man's Curve]],\" the [[The Shangri-Las|Shangri-Las']] \"[[Leader of the Pack]],\" and [[J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers|J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers']] \"[[Last Kiss]].\"\n\nWhile rock 'n' roll had \"disappeared\" from the U.S. charts in the early '60s, it never died out in Europe and Britain in particular was a hotbed of rock 'n' roll activity during this time. In late 1963, the Beatles embarked on their first US tour. A few months later, rock 'n' roll founding father [[Chuck Berry]] emerged from a 2-1/2-year prison stint and resumed recording and touring. The stage was set for the spectacular revival of rock music.\n\nIn the UK, the Beatles played raucous rock 'n' roll \u2013 as well as doo wop, girl-group songs, show tunes \u2013 and wore leather jackets. Their manager [[Brian Epstein]] encouraged the group to wear suits. [[Beatlemania]] abruptly exploded after the group's appearance on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1964. Late in 1965, the Beatles released the album ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' which marked the beginning of their transition to a sophisticated power pop group with elaborate studio arrangements and production, and a year after that, they gave up touring entirely to focus only on albums. A host of imitators followed the Beatles in the so-called British Invasion, including groups like the [[Rolling Stones]] and [[the Kinks]] who would become legends in their own right.\n\nAs the counterculture movement developed, artists began making new kinds of music influenced by the use of psychedelic drugs. Guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]] emerged onto the scene in 1967 with a radically new approach to electric guitar that replaced Chuck Berry, previously seen as the gold standard of rock guitar. Rock artists began to take on serious themes and social commentary/protest instead of simplistic pop themes.\n\nA major development in popular music during the mid-1960s was the movement away from singles and towards albums. Previously, popular music was based around the 45 single (or even earlier, the 78 single) and albums such as they existed were little more than a hit single or two backed with filler tracks, instrumentals, and covers. The development of the AOR (album oriented rock) format was complicated and involved several concurrent events such as Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, the introduction by Bob Dylan of \"serious\" lyrics to rock music, and the Beatles' new studio-based approach. In any case, after 1965 the vinyl LP had definitively taken over as the primary format for all popular music styles.\n\nBlues also continued to develop strongly during the '60s, but after 1965, it increasingly shifted to the young white rock audience and away from its traditional black audience, which moved on to other styles such as soul and funk.\n\nJazz music during the first half of the '60s was largely a continuation of '50s styles, retaining its core audience of young, urban, college-educated whites. By 1967, the death of several important jazz figures such as [[John Coltrane]] and [[Nat King Cole]] precipitated a decline in the genre. The takeover of rock in the late '60s largely spelled the end of jazz as a mainstream form of music, after it had dominated much of the first half of the 20th century.\n\n[[Country music]] gained popularity on the [[West coast of the United States|West Coast]], due in large part to the [[Bakersfield sound]], led by [[Buck Owens]] and [[Merle Haggard]]. Female country artists were also becoming more mainstream (in a genre dominated by men in prior decades), with such acts as [[Patsy Cline]], [[Loretta Lynn]], and [[Tammy Wynette]].\n\n'''Significant events in music in the 1960s:'''\n* [[Elvis Presley]] returned to civilian life in the U.S. after two years away in the [[U.S. Army]].

Movies began to break social taboos such as [[sex]] and [[violence]] causing both controversy and fascination. They turned increasingly dramatic, unbalanced, and hectic as the cultural revolution was starting. This was the beginning of the [[New Hollywood]] era that dominated the next decade in theatres and revolutionized the film industry. Films of this time also focused on the changes happening in the world. [[Dennis Hopper]]'s ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) focused on the drug culture of the time. Movies also became more sexually explicit, such as [[Roger Vadim]]'s'' [[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'' (1968) as the [[counterculture]] progressed.\n\nIn Europe, [[Art Cinema]] gains wider distribution and sees movements like [[French New Wave|la Nouvelle Vague]] (The French New Wave) featuring French filmmakers such as [[Roger Vadim]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], [[Alain Resnais]], and [[Jean-Luc Godard]]; [[Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] documentary movement in Canada, France and the United States; [[Swedish cinema|Swedish filmmaker]] [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[cinema of Chile|Chilean filmmaker]] [[Alexandro Jodorowsky]] and [[Polish cinema|Polish filmmakers]] [[Roman Polanski]] and [[Wojciech Jerzy Has]] produced original and offbeat masterpieces and the high-point of [[Italian cinema|Italian filmmaking]] with [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and [[Federico Fellini]] making some of their most known films during this period. Notable films from this period include: ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', ''[[8\u00bd]]''; ''[[La Notte]]''; ''[[L'Eclisse]]'', ''[[The Red Desert]]''; ''[[Blowup]]''; ''[[Fellini Satyricon]]''; ''[[Accattone]]''; ''[[The Gospel According to St. Matthew (film)|The Gospel According to St. Matthew]]''; ''[[Theorem (film)|Theorem]]''; ''[[Winter Light]]''; ''[[The Silence (1963 film)|The Silence]]''; ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]''; ''[[Shame (1968 film)|Shame]]''; ''[[The Passion of Anna|A Passion]]''; ''[[Au Hasard Balthazar]]''; ''[[Mouchette]]''; ''[[Last Year at Marienbad]]''; ''[[Chronique d'un \u00e9t\u00e9]]''; ''[[Titicut Follies]]''; ''[[High School (1968 film)|High School]]''; ''[[Salesman (1969 film)|Salesman]]''; ''[[La jet\u00e9e]]''; ''[[Warrendale (film)|Warrendale]];'' ''[[Knife in the Water]]''; ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]''; ''[[The Saragossa Manuscript]]''; ''[[El Topo]]''; ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''; and the [[cinema verite]] ''[[Dont Look Back]]''.\n\nIn Japan, a film version of the story of the [[forty-seven ronin]] entitled ''[[Chushingura: Hana no Maki, Yuki no Maki]]'' directed by [[Hiroshi Inagaki]] was released in 1962, the legendary story was also remade as a television series in Japan. Academy Award-winning [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]] director [[Akira Kurosawa]] produced ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961), and ''[[Sanjuro]]'' (1962), which both starred [[Toshiro Mifune]] as a mysterious [[Samurai]] swordsman for hire. Like his previous films both had a profound influence around the world. The ''[[Spaghetti Western]]'' genre was a direct outgrowth of the Kurosawa films. The influence of these films is most apparent in [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964) starring [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]]'s ''[[Last Man Standing (1996 film)|Last Man Standing]]'' (1996). ''Yojimbo'' was also the origin of the \"[[Man with No Name]]\" trend which included Sergio Leone's ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'', and ''[[The Good, The Bad and The Ugly]]'' both also starring Clint Eastwood, and arguably continued through his 1968 opus ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', starring [[Henry Fonda]], [[Charles Bronson]], [[Claudia Cardinale]], and [[Jason Robards]]. ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' a 1960 American [[western film]] directed by [[John Sturges]] was a [[remake]] of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1954 film, ''[[Seven Samurai]]''.\n\nThe 1960s were also about experimentation.

Its popularity continued throughout the first half of the 1970s and then disappeared temporarily from mainstream fashion before making a comeback in the mid-1980s.\n* Men's mainstream hairstyles ranged from the [[pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]], the [[crew cut]], the [[flattop]] hairstyle, the tapered hairstyle, and short, parted hair in the early part of the decade, to longer parted hairstyles with [[sideburns]] towards the latter half of the decade.\n* Women's mainstream hairstyles ranged from [[Beehive (hairstyle)|beehive hairdos]], the bird's nest hairstyle, and the [[chignon (hairstyle)|chignon]] hairstyle in the early part of the decade, to very short styles popularized by [[Twiggy]] and [[Mia Farrow]] in [[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]] towards the latter half of the decade.\n* African-American hairstyles for men and women included the [[afro]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Mop-top hair.jpg|The [[Beatle haircut|mop-top haircut]], which became popular due to the Beatles but was considered at the time a rebellious hairstyle, was particularly fashionable among young men during the decade\nFile:On the Beach at Tiberias.jpg|The [[bikini]] became a fashionable item in the Western world during the decade\nFile:Londons_Carnaby_Street,_1966.jpg|\"Swinging London\" fashions on [[Carnaby Street]], c. 1966\nFile:TieDyeShirtMpegMan.jpg|[[Tie-dye]] shirt\n</gallery>\n{{-}}\n\n===Literature===\n{{see also|List of years in literature#1960s}}\n\n===Sports===\n\n====Olympics====\nThere were six [[Olympic Games]] held during the decade.

Major League Baseball sanctioned both the [[Houston Colt .45s]] and the [[New York Mets]] as new [[National League]] franchises in 1962.\n\nIn 1969, the [[American League]] expanded when the [[Kansas City Royals]] and [[Seattle Pilots]], were admitted to the league prompting the expansion of the post-season (in the form of the [[League Championship Series]]) for the first time since the creation of the World Series. The Pilots stayed just one season in Seattle before moving and becoming the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] in 1970. The National League also added two teams in 1969, the [[Montreal Expos]] and [[San Diego Padres]]. By 1969, the New York Mets won the [[World Series]] in only the 8th year of the team's existence.\n\n====Basketball====\nThe [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] tournaments during the 1960s were dominated by the [[Boston Celtics]], who won eight straight titles from 1959 to 1966 and added two more consecutive championships in 1968 and 1969, aided by such players as [[Bob Cousy]], [[Bill Russell (basketball)|Bill Russell]] and [[John Havlicek]]. Other notable NBA players included [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Elgin Baylor]], [[Jerry West]] and [[Oscar Robertson]].\n\nAt the [[NCAA]] level, the [[UCLA Bruins]] also proved dominant. Coached by [[John Wooden]], they were helped by [[Lew Alcindor]] and by [[Bill Walton]] to win championships and dominate the American college basketball landscape during the decade.\n\n====Disc sports (Frisbee)====\nAlternative sports, using the flying disc, began in the mid-sixties. As numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they resisted and looked for alternatives. They would form what would become known as the [[counterculture]]. The forms of escape and resistance would manifest in many ways including social activism, alternative lifestyles, experimental living through foods, dress, music and alternative recreational activities, including that of throwing a [[Frisbee]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Countercultural Sports in America: The History and Meaning of Ultimate Frisbee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qycPRAAACAAJ|author=Jordan Holtzman-Conston |publisher=Waltham, Mass|year= 2010|isbn=978-3838311951}}</ref> Starting with promotional efforts from [[Wham-O]] and [[Irwin Toy]] (Canada), a few tournaments and professionals using [[Frisbee]] show tours to perform at universities, fairs and sporting events, disc sports such as [[Flying disc freestyle|freestyle]], [[double disc court]], [[Guts (flying disc game)|guts]], [[Ultimate (sport)|disc ultimate]] and [[disc golf]] became this sports first events.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Flying Disc Federation|url=http://wfdf.org/|work=WFDF Official Website|accessdate=19 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=World Flying Disc Federation |url=http://wfdf.org/history-stats/history-of-fyling-disc |work=History of the Flying Disc |accessdate=20 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019095944/http://wfdf.org/history-stats/history-of-fyling-disc |archivedate=19 October 2013 }}</ref> Two sports, the team sport of [[Ultimate (sport)|disc ultimate]] and [[disc golf]] are very popular worldwide and are now being played semi professionally.<ref>{{cite web|title=Professional Disc Golf Association|url=http://www.pdga.com/|work=PDGA Official Website|accessdate=19 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=American Ultimate Disc League|url=http://theaudl.com/|work=AUDL Official Website|accessdate=20 October 2013}}</ref> The [[World Flying Disc Federation]], [[Professional Disc Golf Association]] and the Freestyle Players Association are the official rules and sanctioning organizations for flying disc sports worldwide.

This \"cultural decade\" is more loosely defined than the actual decade, beginning around [[1963]] with the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy assassination]] and ending around [[1974]] with the [[Watergate scandal]].<ref name=\"Barth84Exhaustion\">[[John Barth]] (1984) intro to ''[[The Literature of Exhaustion]]'', in ''The Friday Book''.</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/05/books/05masl.html| work= [[The New York Times]] | title= Brokaw Explores Another Turning Point, the '60s  | date= 5 November 2007 | accessdate= 26 August 2011 | author = [[Janet Maslin|Maslin, Janet]]}}</ref>\n\n\"The Sixties\", as they are known in both scholarship and popular culture, is a term used by historians, journalists, and other academics to describe the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] and revolution in social norms about clothing, music, drugs, dress, sexuality, formalities, and schooling; and in others to denounce the decade as one of irresponsible excess, flamboyance, and decay of social order. The decade was also labeled the [[Swinging London|Swinging Sixties]] because of the fall or relaxation of social taboos that occurred during this time, but also because of the emergence of a wide range of music; from a folk music revival, to the Beatles revolution, to the serious lyrics of Bob Dylan and Paul Simon. Norms of all kinds were broken down, especially in regards to civil rights and expectations the men would go off to meaningless wars.\n\nCommentator [[Christopher Booker]]<ref>[[Christopher Booker]]: ''The Neophiliacs:  A Study of the Revolution in English Life in the Fifties and Sixties'', Gambit Incorporated, London, 1970</ref> described this era as a classical [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] nightmare cycle, where a rigid culture, unable to contain the demands for greater [[Individualism|individual freedom]], broke free of the social constraints of the previous age through extreme deviation from the norm. He charts the rise, success, fall/nightmare and explosion in the London scene of the 1960s. Several [[Western culture|Western]] nations such as the United States, United Kingdom, France, and [[West Germany]] turned to the [[Left-wing politics|political left]] in the early and mid-1960s.\n\nBy the end of the 1950s, war-ravaged Europe had largely finished reconstruction and began a tremendous economic boom. World War II had brought about a huge leveling of social classes in which the remnants of the old feudal gentry disappeared. There was a major expansion of the middle class in western European countries and by the 1960s, many working-class people in Western Europe could afford a radio, television, refrigerator, and motor vehicle. Meanwhile, the East such as the Soviet union and other Warsaw Pact countries were improving quickly after rebuilding from WWII. Real GDP growth averaged 6% a year during the second half of the decade. Thus, the overall worldwide economic trend in the 1960s was one of prosperity, expansion of the middle class, and the proliferation of new domestic technology.\n\nThe [[Cold War|confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union]] dominated geopolitics during the '60s, with the struggle expanding into developing nations in Latin America, Africa, and Asia as the Soviet Union moved from being a regional to a truly global [[superpower]] and began vying for influence in the developing world. After President [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy's assassination]], direct tensions between the US and Soviet Union cooled and the superpower confrontation moved into a contest for control of the Third World, a battle characterized by [[proxy war]]s, funding of insurgencies, and puppet governments.\n\nIn response to [[nonviolent]] [[direct action]] campaigns from groups like the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]] (SNCC) and the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC), U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]], a [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian]]<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842353-7,00.html|title=The Economy: We Are All Keynesians Now|date=31 December 1965|accessdate=1 January 2011|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|quote=Keynesianism made its biggest breakthrough under John Kennedy, who, as Arthur Schlesinger reports in A Thousand Days, \"was unquestionably the first Keynesian President.\"}}</ref> and staunch [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], pushed for social reforms.  Kennedy's assassination in 1963 was a shock. Liberal reforms were finally passed under [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] including civil rights for [[African Americans]] and healthcare for [[Medicare (United States)|the elderly]] and [[Medicaid|the poor]]. Despite his large-scale [[Great Society]] programs, Johnson was increasingly reviled by the [[New Left]] at home and abroad. The heavy-handed American role in the [[Vietnam War]] outraged student protestors around the globe.  The [[assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.]] upon working with underpaid [[Memphis Sanitation Strike|Tennessee garbage collectors]] and the [[anti-Vietnam War movement]], and [[Chicago Seven|the police response towards protesters of the 1968 Democratic National Convention]], defined politics of violence in the United States.\n\nIn Western Europe and Japan, organizations such as [[Situationist International|those present at May 1968]], the [[Red Army Faction]], and the [[Zengakuren]] tested [[Liberal democracy|liberal democracy's]] ability to satisfy its marginalized or alienated citizenry amidst [[Advanced capitalism|post-industrial age hybrid capitalist economies]].

Unlike other European nations, the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portuguese regime]] did not leave its African colonies, or the overseas provinces, during the 1950s and 1960s. During the 1960s, various armed independence movements, most prominently led by [[communist]]-led parties who cooperated under the [[CONCP]] umbrella and pro-U.S. groups, became active in these areas, most notably in [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], and [[Portuguese Guinea]].

Mao alleged that \"liberal bourgeois\" elements were permeating the party and society at large and that they wanted to restore [[capitalism]]. Mao insisted that these elements be removed through post-revolutionary [[class struggle]] by mobilizing the thoughts and actions of China's youth, who formed [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] groups around the country. The movement subsequently spread into the military, urban workers, and the party leadership itself. Although Mao himself officially declared the Cultural Revolution to have ended in 1969, the power struggles and political instability between 1969 and the arrest of the [[Gang of Four]] in 1976 are now also widely regarded as part of the Revolution.\n*The [[Naxalite]] movement in India began in 1967 with an [[Naxalbari uprising|armed uprising]] of tribals against local landlords in the village of [[Naxalbari]], [[West Bengal]], led by certain leaders of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]]. The movement was influenced by [[Maoism|Mao Zedong's ideology]] and spread to many tribal districts in Eastern India, gaining strong support among the radical urban youth. After counter-insurgency operations by the police, military and paramilitary forces, the movement fragmented but is still active in many districts.\n* [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland began with the rise of the [[Northern Ireland civil rights movement]] in the mid-1960s, the conflict continued into the later 1990s.\n* The [[Compton's Cafeteria Riot]] occurred in August 1966 in the [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California|Tenderloin]] district of San Francisco. This incident was one of the first recorded [[transgender]] riots in United States history, preceding the more famous 1969 Stonewall Riots in New York City by three years.\n* The [[Stonewall riots]] occurred in June 1969 in New York City. The Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations against a police raid that took place in the [[Stonewall Inn]], in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of New York City. They are frequently cited as the first instance in American history when people in the homosexual community fought back against a government-sponsored system that persecuted sexual minorities, and they have become the defining event that marked the start of the [[gay rights movement]] in the United States and around the world.\n* In 1967, the [[National Farmers Organization]] withheld milk supplies for 15 days as part of an effort to induce a quota system to stabilize prices.\n* [[May 1968 events in France|The May 1968 student and worker uprisings in France]].\n* Mass socialist or Communist movement in most European countries (particularly France and Italy), with which the student-based new left was able to forge a connection. The most spectacular manifestation of this was the [[May 1968 in France|May]] student revolt of 1968 in Paris that linked up with a general strike of ten million workers called by the trade unions; and for a few days seemed capable of overthrowing the government of [[Charles de Gaulle]]. De Gaulle went off to visit French troops in Germany to check on their loyalty. Major concessions were won for trade union rights, higher minimum wages and better working conditions.\n* University students protested in the hundreds of thousands against the Vietnam War in London, Paris, Berlin and Rome.\n* In Eastern Europe students also drew inspiration from the protests in the West. In Poland and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] they protested against restrictions on free speech by [[communist]] regimes.\n* The [[Tlatelolco massacre]] \u2013 was a government massacre of student and civilian protesters and bystanders that took place during the afternoon and night of 2 October 1968, in the [[Plaza de las Tres Culturas]] in the [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]] section of Mexico City.\n\n===Coups===\n{{Main|List of coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts#1960\u20131969}}\nProminent [[coups d'\u00e9tat]] of the decade included:\n* On 27 May 1960, a coup in [[Turkey]] led by [[Cemal G\u00fcrsel]] and [[Cemal Madano\u011flu]] overthrew the government of [[Adnan Menderes]].\n* On 16 May 1961, a coup in [[South Korea]] led by army officer [[Park Chung-hee]] made the establishment of temporary military rule.\n* In 1963, a coup in [[South Viet Nam]] leads to the death of President [[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m]] and the establishment of temporary military rule.\n* On 21 April 1967, in Greece a group of colonels established a [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|military dictatorship]] for seven years.\n* In 1968, a coup in Iraq led to the overthrow of [[Abdul Rahman Arif]] by the [[Arab socialism|Arab Socialist]] [[Baath Party]].\n* On 1 September 1969, a small group of military officers led by the army officer [[Muammar Gaddafi]] overthrows monarchy in [[Libya]].\n\n===Nuclear threats===\n[[File:Cuban missiles.jpg|thumb|150px|Pictures of Soviet missile silos in [[Cuba]], taken by United States spy planes on 1 November 1962.]]\n* The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (16\u201328 October 1962) \u2013 a near-military confrontation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union about the presence of Soviet missiles in [[Cuba]].

President Kennedy had plans to restore Sino-US relations, but his assassination, the war in Vietnam, and the Cultural Revolution put an end to that. Not until Richard Nixon took office in 1969 was there another opportunity.\n* Following Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's expulsion in 1964, Sino-Soviet relations devolved into open hostility. The Chinese were deeply disturbed by the Soviet suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968, as the latter now claimed the right to intervene in any country it saw as deviating from the correct path of socialism. Finally, in March 1969, armed clashes took place along the Sino-Soviet border in Manchuria. This drove the Chinese to restore relations with the U.S., as Mao Zedong decided that the Soviet Union was a much greater threat against them.\n\n=====India=====\n* In India a literary and cultural movement started in Calcutta, Patna, and other cities by a group of writers and painters who called themselves \"Hungryalists\", or members of the [[Hungry generation]].

In his campaign, John F. Kennedy promised to \"get America moving again.\" His goal was economic growth of 4\u20136% per year and unemployment below 4%. To do this, he instituted a 7% tax credit for businesses that invest in new plants and equipment. By the end of the decade, median family income had risen from $8,540 in 1963 to $10,770 by 1969.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. History \u2013 1960s|url=http://elcoushistory.tripod.com/economics1960.html}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the first half of the decade had low inflation, by 1966 Kennedy's tax credit had reduced unemployment to 3.7% and inflation remained below 2%. With the economy booming Johnson began his \"Great Society\" which vastly expanded social programs.

It caused localized tsunamis that severely battered the Chilean coast, with waves up to 25 meters (82&nbsp;ft). The main tsunami raced across the Pacific Ocean and devastated [[Hilo, Hawaii]].\n* [[1963 Skopje earthquake]] was a 6.1 moment magnitude earthquake which occurred in Skopje, SR Macedonia (present-day Republic of Macedonia) on 26 July 1963 which killed over 1,070 people, injured between 3,000 and 4,000 and left more than 200,000 people homeless. About 80% of the city was destroyed.\n* 1963 \u2013 [[Vajont Dam#Landslide and wave|Vajont dam disaster]] \u2013 The Vajont dam flood in Italy was caused by a mountain sliding in the dam, and causing a flood wave that killed approximately 2,000 people in the towns in its path.\n* 1964 \u2013 The [[1964 Alaska earthquake|Good Friday earthquake]], the most powerful earthquake recorded in the U.S. and North America, struck [[Alaska]] and killed 143 people.\n* 1965 \u2013 [[Hurricane Betsy]] caused severe damage to the U.S. Gulf Coast, especially in the state of [[Louisiana]].\n* 1969 \u2013 The [[Cuyahoga River]] caught fire in Ohio. Fires had erupted on the river many times, including 22 June 1969, when a river fire captured the attention of Time magazine, which described the Cuyahoga as the river that \"oozes rather than flows\" and in which a person \"does not drown but decays.\" This helped spur legislative action on water pollution control resulting in the Clean Water Act, Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, and the creation of the federal Environmental Protection Agency.\n* 1969 \u2013 [[Hurricane Camille]] hit the U.S. Gulf Coast at Category 5 Status. To date it is the strongest hurricane ever recorded at landfall in means of sustained windspeed in the Atlantic Basin, reaching sustained winds of 190&nbsp;mph and a low pressure of 905 mbs. It is one of only three hurricanes in the Atlantic to ever make landfall at Category 5 Status and one of only four hurricanes worldwide to reach a maximum sustained windspeed of 190&nbsp;mph.\n\n'''Non-natural:'''\n* On 16 December 1960, a [[United Airlines]] DC-8 and a [[Trans World Airlines]] Lockheed Constellation [[1960 New York mid-air collision|collided over New York City]] and crashed, killing 134 people.\n* On 15 February 1961, [[Sabena Flight 548]] crashed on its way to Brussels, Belgium, killing all 72 passengers on board and 1 person on the ground. Among those killed were all 18 members of the US figure skating team, on their way to the World Championships. \n* On 16 March 1962, [[Flying Tiger Line Flight 739]], a Lockheed Super Constellation, inexplicably disappeared over the Western Pacific, leaving all 107 on board presumed dead.  Since the wreckage of the aircraft is lost to this day, the cause of the crash remains a mystery.\n* On 3 June 1962, [[Air France Flight 007]], a Boeing 707, crashed on takeoff from Paris.  130 people were killed in the crash while 2 survived.\n* On 20 May 1965, [[PIA Flight 705]] crashed on approach to [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]].  121 died while 6 survived.\n* On 4 February 1966, [[All Nippon Airways Flight 60]], a Boeing 727, plunged into [[Tokyo Bay]] for reasons unknown.

A total of 155 people died in the crash.\n\n==Social and political movements==\n\n===Counterculture and social revolution===\n{{See also|Counterculture of the 1960s | Timeline of 1960s counterculture}}\n[[File:Flower-Power Bus.jpg|thumb|[[Flower Power]] Bus]]\nIn the second half of the decade, young people began to revolt against the conservative norms of the time, as well as remove themselves from mainstream liberalism, in particular the high level of materialism which was so common during the era. This created a \"counterculture\" that sparked a social revolution throughout much of the Western world. It began in the United States as a reaction against the conservatism and social conformity of the 1950s, and the U.S. government's extensive military intervention in Vietnam. The youth involved in the popular social aspects of the movement became known as [[hippies]]. These groups created a movement toward liberation in society, including the [[sexual revolution]], questioning authority and government, and demanding more freedoms and rights for women and minorities. The [[Underground Press]], a widespread, eclectic collection of newspapers served as a unifying medium for the counterculture. The movement was also marked by the first widespread, socially accepted drug use (including [[LSD]] and [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]) and [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] music.\n\n===Anti-war movement===\n{{main|Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War}}\n[[File:Vietnamdem.jpg|thumb|left|A demonstrator offers a flower to military police guarding [[the Pentagon]] during the [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam]]'s 21 October 1967 \"March on the Pentagon\"]]\nThe war in Vietnam would eventually lead to a commitment of over half a million American troops, resulting in over 58,500 American deaths and producing a large-scale antiwar movement in the United States. As late as the end of 1965, few Americans protested the American involvement in Vietnam, but as the war dragged on and the body count continued to climb, civil unrest escalated. Students became a powerful and disruptive force and university campuses sparked a national debate over the war. As the movement's ideals spread beyond college campuses, doubts about the war also began to appear within the administration itself. A mass movement began rising in opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], ending in the massive [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Moratorium]] protests in 1969, as well as the movement of resistance to [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] (\"the Draft\") for the war.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nThe [[antiwar movement]] was initially based on the older 1950s [[Peace movement]], heavily influenced by the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]], but by the mid-1960s it outgrew this and became a broad-based mass movement centered in universities and churches: one kind of protest was called a \"[[sit-in]]\".  Other terms heard in the United States included \"[[the Draft]]\", \"[[draft dodger]]\", \"[[conscientious objector]]\", and \"[[Vietnam veteran|Vietnam vet]]\". Voter age-limits were challenged by the phrase: \"If you're old enough to die for your country, you're old enough to vote.\"\n\n===Civil rights movement===\n{{Main|Civil rights movement}}\n[[File:Civil Rights March on Washington, D.C. (Leaders of the march posing in front of the statue of Abraham Lincoln... - NARA - 542063.tif|thumb|240px|Leaders of the [[civil rights movement]]'s 28 August 1963, [[March on Washington]] in front of the [[Abraham Lincoln (Lincoln Memorial)|statue of Abraham Lincoln]]]]\n\nBeginning in the mid-1950s and continuing into the late 1960s, African-Americans in the United States aimed at outlawing [[racism|racial discrimination]] against [[African American|black American]]s and [[Suffrage|voting rights]] to them. This article covers the phase of the movement between 1955 and 1968, particularly in the South. The emergence of the [[Black Power movement]], which lasted roughly from 1966 to 1975, enlarged the aims of the civil rights movement to include racial dignity, [[Economy of the United States|economic]] and [[politics of the United States|political]] [[self-sufficiency]], and [[anti-imperialism]].\n\nThe movement was characterized by major campaigns of [[civil resistance]]. Between 1955 and 1968, acts of [[civil disobedience]] and [[Nonviolent action|nonviolent]] protest produced crisis situations between activists and government authorities. Federal, state, and local governments, businesses, and communities often had to respond immediately to these situations that highlighted the inequities faced by African Americans. Forms of protest and/or civil disobedience included [[boycott]]s such as the successful [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]] (1955\u20131956) in Alabama; \"[[sit-in]]s\" such as the influential [[Greensboro sit-ins]] (1960) in North Carolina; [[Demonstration (people)|marches]], such as the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] (1965) in Alabama; and a wide range of other nonviolent activities.\n\nNoted legislative achievements during this phase of the civil rights movement were passage of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],<ref name=\"cra64\">{{cite web|url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21|title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 - CRA - Title VII - Equal Employment Opportunities - 42 US Code Chapter 21}}</ref> that banned discrimination based on \"race, color, religion, or national origin\" in employment practices and public accommodations; the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], that restored and protected voting rights; the [[Immigration and Nationality Services Act of 1965]], that dramatically opened entry to the U.S. to immigrants other than traditional European groups; and the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]], that banned discrimination in the sale or rental of housing.\n\n===Hispanic and Chicano movement===\nAnother large ethnic minority group, the [[Mexican-Americans]], are among other [[Hispanics]] in the U.S. who fought to end racial discrimination and socioeconomic disparity. The largest Mexican-American populations was in the [[Southwestern United States]], such as [[California]] with over 1 million ''[[Chicanos]]'' in Los Angeles alone, and [[Texas]] where [[Jim Crow]] laws included Mexican-Americans as \"non-white\" in some instances to be legally segregated.\n\nSocially, the [[Chicano Movement]] addressed what it perceived to be negative [[ethnic stereotype]]s of Mexicans in mass media and the American consciousness. It did so through the creation of works of literary and visual art that validated Mexican-American ethnicity and culture. Chicanos fought to end social stigmas such as the usage of the Spanish language and advocated official [[bilingualism]] in federal and state governments.\n\nThe Chicano Movement also addressed discrimination in public and private institutions. Early in the twentieth century, Mexican Americans formed organizations to protect themselves from discrimination. One of those organizations, the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]], was formed in 1929 and remains active today.<ref>[http://www.lulac.org/about/history.html History | LULAC-League of United Latin American Citizens<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe movement gained momentum after World War II when groups such as the [[American G.I. Forum]], which was formed by returning Mexican American veterans, joined in the efforts by other civil rights organizations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americangiforum.org/about.cfm |title=americangiforum.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706223234/http://www.americangiforum.org/about.cfm |archivedate=6 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\nMexican-American civil-rights activists achieved several major legal victories including the 1947 ''[[Mendez v. Westminster]]'' [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling which declared that segregating children of \"Mexican and Latin descent\" was unconstitutional and the 1954 ''[[Hernandez v. Texas]]'' ruling which declared that Mexican Americans and other racial groups in the United States were entitled to equal protection under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latinola.com/story.php?story=432|title=LatinoLA \u2013 Hollywood :: Mendez v.

Texas \u2013 The Oyez Project at IIT Chicago-Kent College of Law|work=oyez.org}}</ref>\n\nThe most prominent civil-rights organization in the Mexican-American community, the [[Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (MALDEF), was founded in 1968.<ref>[http://www.maldef.org/about/index.htm MALDEF{{spaced ndash}} About Us<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422002948/http://www.maldef.org/about/index.htm |date=22 April 2008 }}</ref> Although modeled after the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]], MALDEF has also taken on many of the functions of other organizations, including political advocacy and training of local leaders.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]] in the U.S. mainland fought against racism, police brutality and socioeconomic problems affecting the three million Puerto Ricans residing in the 50 states. The main concentration of the population was in New York City.\n\nIn the 1960s and the following 1970s, Hispanic-American culture was on the rebound like ethnic music, foods, culture and identity both became popular and assimilated into the American mainstream. Spanish-language television networks, radio stations and newspapers increased in presence across the country, especially in U.S.\u2013Mexican border towns and East Coast cities like New York City, and the growth of the [[Cuban American]] community in [[Miami, Florida]].\n\nThe multitude of discrimination at this time represented an inhuman side to a society that in the 1960s was upheld as a world and industry leader. The issues of civil rights and warfare became major points of reflection of virtue and democracy, what once was viewed as traditional and inconsequential was now becoming the significance in the turning point of a culture.  A document known as the Port Huron Statement exemplifies these two conditions perfectly in its first hand depiction, \"while these and other problems either directly oppressed us or rankled our consciences and became our own subjective concerns, we began to see complicated and disturbing paradoxes in our surrounding America. The declaration \"all men are created equal...\" rang hollow before the facts of Negro life in the South and the big cities of the North. The proclaimed peaceful intentions of the United States contradicted its economic and military investments in the Cold War status quo.\" These intolerable issues became too visible to ignore therefore its repercussions were feared greatly, the realization that we as individuals take the responsibility for encounter and resolution in our lives issues was an emerging idealism of the 1960s.\n\n===Second-wave feminism===\n{{Main|Second-wave feminism}}\nA second wave of feminism in the United States and around the world gained momentum in the early 1960s. While the first wave of the early 20th century was centered on gaining suffrage and overturning ''de jure'' inequalities, the second wave was focused on changing cultural and social norms and ''de facto'' inequalities associated with women. At the time, a woman's place was generally seen as being in the home, and they were excluded from many jobs and professions. In the U.S., a [[Presidential Commission on the Status of Women]] found discrimination against women in the workplace and every other aspect of life, a revelation which launched two decades of prominent women-centered legal reforms (i.e., the [[Equal Pay Act of 1963]], [[Title IX]], etc.) which broke down the last remaining legal barriers to women's personal freedom and professional success.\n\nFeminists took to the streets, marching and protesting, authoring books and debating to change social and political views that limited women. In 1963, with [[Betty Friedan]]'s book, ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', the role of women in society, and in public and private life was questioned. By 1966, the movement was beginning to grow in size and power as women's group spread across the country and Friedan, along with other feminists, founded the [[National Organization for Women]]. In 1968, \"[[Women's Liberation]]\" became a household term as, for the first time, the new women's movement eclipsed the [[civil rights movement]] when [[New York Radical Women]], led by [[Robin Morgan]], [[Miss America protest|protested the annual Miss America pageant]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. The movement continued throughout the next decades. [[Gloria Steinem]] was a key feminist.\n\n===Gay rights movement===\n{{Main|Gay Liberation|LGBT social movements}}\nThe United States, in the middle of a social revolution, led the world in LGBT rights in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Inspired by the civil-rights movement and the women's movement, early gay-rights pioneers had begun, by the 1960s, to build a movement.  These groups were rather conservative in their practices, emphasizing that ''gay men and women are no different from those who are straight'' and deserve full equality.  This philosophy would be dominant again after [[AIDS]], but by the very end of the 1960s, the movement's goals would change and become more radical, demanding a right to be different, and encouraging [[gay pride]].\n\nThe symbolic birth of the [[gay rights movement]] would not come until the decade had almost come to a close.  Gays were not allowed by law to congregate.  Gay establishments such as the [[Stonewall Inn]] in New York City were routinely raided by the police to arrest gay people.  On a night in late June 1969, LGBT people resisted, for the first time, a police raid, and rebelled openly in the streets.  This uprising called the [[Stonewall Riots]] began a new period of the LGBT rights movement that in the next decade would cause dramatic change both inside the LGBT community and in the mainstream American culture.\n\n===New Left===\nThe rapid rise of a \"[[New Left]]\" applied the class perspective of [[Marxism]] to postwar America, but had little organizational connection with older Marxist organizations such as the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], and even went as far as to reject organized labor as the basis of a unified left-wing movement. Sympathetic to the ideology of [[C. Wright Mills]], the New Left differed from the traditional left in its resistance to dogma and its emphasis on personal as well as societal change. [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) became the organizational focus of the New Left and was the prime mover behind the opposition to the War in Vietnam. The 1960s left also consisted of ephemeral campus-based [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]], [[Maoism|Maoist]] and [[anarchism|anarchist]] groups, some of which by the end of the 1960s had turned to [[Militant (word)|militancy]].\n\n===Crime===\nThe 1960s was also associated with a large increase in crime and urban unrest of all types. Between 1960 and 1969 reported incidences of violent crime per 100,000 people in the United States nearly doubled and have yet to return to the levels of the early 1960s.<ref>[https://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-23.pdf U.S. Census Bureau Data https://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-23.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924134627/http://www.census.gov/statab/hist/HS-23.pdf |date=24 September 2015 }}</ref> Large riots broke out in many cities like [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], Los Angeles, New York City, [[Newark, New Jersey]], [[Oakland, California]] and Washington, D.C. By the end of the decade, politicians like [[George Wallace]] and [[Richard Nixon]] campaigned on restoring law and order to a nation troubled with the new unrest.\n\n==Science and technology==\n\n===Science===\n\n====Space exploration====\n[[File:As08-16-2593.jpg|right|thumb|250px|On 21 December 1968 the [[Apollo 8]] crew took a picture, for the first time in history, of the entire Earth]]\n[[File:Aldrin Apollo 11 original.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Apollo 11]] mission landed the first humans on the Moon in July 1969.]]\nThe [[Space Race]] between the United States and the Soviet Union dominated the 1960s. The Soviets sent the first man, [[Yuri Gagarin]], into [[outer space]] during the [[Vostok 1]] mission on 12 April 1961 and scored a host of other successes, but by the middle of the decade the U.S. was taking the lead. In May 1961, President Kennedy set the goal for the United States of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s.\n\nIn June 1963, [[Valentina Tereshkova]] became the first woman in space during the [[Vostok 6]] mission. In 1965, Soviets launched the first probe to hit another planet of the [[Solar System]] ([[Venus]]), [[Venera 3]], and the first probe to make a soft landing on and transmit from the surface of the Moon, [[Luna 9]]. In March 1966, the Soviet Union launched [[Luna 10]], which became the first [[space probe]] to enter orbit around the Moon, and in September, 1968, [[Zond 5]] flew the first terrestrial beings, including two tortoises, to circumnavigate the Moon.\n\nThe deaths of astronauts [[Gus Grissom]], [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], and [[Roger B. Chaffee]] in the [[Apollo 1]] fire on 27 January 1967 put a temporary hold on the U.S. space program, but afterward progress was steady, with the [[Apollo 8]] crew ([[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell]], [[William Anders]]) being the first manned mission to orbit another celestial body (the Moon) during Christmas of 1968.\n\nOn 20 July 1969, [[Apollo 11]], the [[Moon landing|first human spaceflight landed on the Moon]]. Launched on 16 July 1969, it carried mission Commander [[Neil Armstrong]], Command Module Pilot [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], and the Lunar Module Pilot [[Buzz Aldrin]]. Apollo 11 fulfilled President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of reaching the Moon by the end of the 1960s, which he had expressed during a speech given before a joint session of Congress on 25 May 1961: \"I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\"\n\nThe Soviet program lost its sense of direction with the death of chief designer [[Sergey Korolyov]] in 1966. Political pressure, conflicts between different design bureaus, and engineering problems caused by an inadequate budget would doom the Soviet attempt to land men on the Moon.\n\nA succession of unmanned American and Soviet probes traveled to the Moon, [[Venus]], and [[Mars]] during the 1960s, and commercial satellites also came into use.\n\n====Other scientific developments====\n[[File:Antibabypille.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[birth control pill]] was introduced in 1960.]]\n* 1960 \u2013 The female birth-control contraceptive, [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the pill]], was released in the United States after [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval.\n* 1963 - The measles vaccine was released after being approved by the FDA\n* 1964 - The discovery and confirmation of the [[Cosmic microwave background]] in 1964 secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe. \n* 1965 \u2013 [[AstroTurf]] introduced.\n* 1967 \u2013 First [[heart transplantation]] operation by Professor [[Christiaan Barnard]] in South Africa.\n* 1967 \u2013 Discovery of the first known [[pulsar]] (a rapidly spinning [[neutron star]]).\n\n===Technology===\n\n====Automobiles====\nAs the 1960s began, American cars showed a rapid rejection of 1950s styling excess, and would remain relatively clean and boxy for the entire decade. The horsepower race reached its climax in the late 1960s, with [[muscle cars]] sold by most makes. The compact [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Ford Mustang]], launched in 1964, was one of the decade's greatest successes. The \"[[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]]\" American automakers enjoyed their highest ever sales and profitability in the 1960s, but the demise of [[Studebaker]] in 1966 left [[American Motors Corporation]] as the last significant independent. The decade would see the car market split into different size classes for the first time, and model lineups now included [[Compact car|compact]] and [[Mid-size car|mid-sized]] cars in addition to [[Full-size car|full-sized]] ones.\n\nThe popular modern hatchback, with front-wheel-drive and a two-box configuration, was born in 1965 with the introduction of the [[Renault 16]], many of this car's design principles live on in its modern counterparts: a large rear opening incorporating the rear window, foldable rear seats to extend boot space. The [[Mini]], released in 1959, had first popularised the front wheel drive two-box configuration, but technically was not a hatchback as it had a fold-down bootlid.\n\nJapanese cars also began to gain acceptance in the Western market, and popular economy models such as the [[Toyota Corolla]], [[Datsun 510]], and the first popular Japanese sports car, the [[Datsun 240Z]], were released in the mid- to late-1960s.\n\n====Electronics and communications====\n[[File:60s tech.jpg|thumb|Examples of 1960s technology, including two rotary-dial telephones and a Kodak camera.]]\n* 1960 \u2013 The first working laser was demonstrated in May by [[Theodore Maiman]] at [[Hughes Research Laboratories]].\n* 1960 \u2013 [[Tony Hoare]] announces the [[Quicksort]] [[algorithm]], the most common sorter on computers.\n* 1961 \u2013 [[Unimate]], the first [[industrial robot]], was introduced.\n* 1962 \u2013 First transatlantic satellite broadcast via the [[Telstar]] satellite.\n* 1962 \u2013 The first computer video game, ''[[Spacewar!]]'', was invented.\n* 1962 \u2013 Red [[LED]]s were developed.\n* 1963 \u2013 The first [[Geosynchronous satellite|geosynchronous communications satellite]], '''[[Syncom 2]]''' is launched.\n* 1963 \u2013 First transpacific satellite broadcast via the [[Relay 1]] satellite.\n* 1963 \u2013 [[Touch-Tone]] telephones introduced.\n* 1963 \u2013 [[Sketchpad]] was the first touch interactive [[computer graphics]] program.\n* 1963 \u2013 The [[Nottingham]] Electronic Valve company produced the first home [[Videocassette recorder|video recorder]] called the \"Telcan\".\n* 1964 \u2013 [[8-track tape]] audio format was developed.\n* 1964 \u2013 The [[Compact Cassette]] was introduced.\n* 1964 \u2013 The first successful [[Minicomputer]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s 12-bit [[PDP-8]], was marketed.\n* 1964 \u2013 The [[programming language]] [[BASIC]] was created.\n* 1964 \u2013 The world's first [[supercomputer]], the [[CDC 6600]], was introduced.\n* 1964 \u2013 [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] released [[Integrated Circuit|IC]]s with [[Dual in-line package|dual in-line packaging]].\n* 1967 \u2013 [[PAL]] and [[SECAM]] broadcast color television systems started publicly transmitting in Europe.\n* 1967 \u2013 The first [[Automatic Teller Machine]] was opened in [[Barclays Bank]], London.\n* 1968 \u2013 [[Ralph Baer]] developed his [[Brown Box]] (a working prototype of the Magnavox Odyssey).\n* 1968 \u2013 The [[The Mother of All Demos|first public demonstration]] of the [[computer mouse]], the [[paper paradigm]] [[Graphical user interface]], [[video conference|video conferencing]], [[teleconference|teleconferencing]], [[email]], and [[hypertext]].\n* 1969 \u2013 [[Arpanet]], the research-oriented prototype of the [[Internet]], was introduced.\n* 1969 \u2013 [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] invented at AT&T [[Bell Labs]], used as the electronic imager in still and video cameras.\n\n==Additional notable worldwide events==\n* The [[Manson Murders]] occurred between 8\u201310 August 1969, when actress [[Sharon Tate]], coffee heiress [[Abigail Folger]], and several others were brutally murdered in the Tate residence by [[Charles Manson]]'s \"family.\" [[Rosemary LaBianca]] & [[Leno LaBianca]] were also murdered by the Manson family the following night.\n* Canada celebrated its 100th anniversary of [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1967 by hosting [[Expo 67]], the World's Fair, in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]]. During the anniversary celebrations, French president [[Charles De Gaulle]] visited Canada, and caused a considerable uproar by declaring his support for Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois independence.\n\n==Popular culture==\nThe counterculture movement dominated the second half of the 1960s, its most famous moments being the [[Summer of Love]] in San Francisco in 1967, and the [[Woodstock Festival]] in [[upstate New York]] in 1969. [[Psychedelic drugs]], especially [[LSD]], were widely used medicinally, spiritually and recreationally throughout the late 1960s, and were popularized by [[Timothy Leary]] with his slogan \"[[Turn on, tune in, drop out]]\". [[Ken Kesey]] and the [[Merry Pranksters]] also played a part in the role of \"turning heads on\". [[Psychedelia|Psychedelic]] influenced the music, artwork and films of the decade, and a number of prominent musicians died of drug overdoses (see [[27 Club]]). There was a growing interest in Eastern religions and philosophy, and many attempts were made to found communes, which varied from supporting free love to religious puritanism.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:The Beatles i H\u00f6torgscity 1963.jpg|280px|right|thumb|The arrival of the [[Beatles]] in the US during 1964, and particularly their appearance on television's ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', marked the beginning of the [[British invasion]] in the history of music, in which a large number of rock and pop music acts from the United Kingdom gained enormous popularity in the US]]\n{{Quote box\n| quote = \"The 60's{{sic}} were a leap in human consciousness.

As the 1960s began, the major rock 'n' roll stars of the '50s such as [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Little Richard]] had dropped off the charts and popular music in the U.S. came to be dominated by [[girl group]]s, [[surf music]], novelty pop songs, clean-cut teen idols, and [[Motown]] music. Another important change in music during the early 1960s was the [[American folk music revival]] which introduced [[Bob Dylan]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[The Kingston Trio]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Odetta]], and many other [[singer-songwriters]] to the public.\n\n[[Girl group]]s and female singers, such as [[the Shirelles]], [[Betty Everett]], [[Little Eva]], the [[The Dixie Cups|Dixie Cups]], the [[Ronettes]], and [[the Supremes]] dominated the charts in the early 1960s. This style consisted typically of light pop themes about teenage romance and lifestyles, backed by vocal harmonies and a strong rhythm. Most girl groups were [[African-American]], but white girl groups and singers, such as [[Lesley Gore]], the [[The Angels (American group)|Angels]], and the [[The Shangri-Las|Shangri-Las]] also emerged during  this period.\n\nAround the same time, record producer [[Phil Spector]] began producing girl groups and created a new kind of pop music production that came to be known as the [[Wall of Sound]]. This style emphasized higher budgets and more elaborate arrangements, and more melodramatic musical themes in place of a simple, light-hearted pop sound. Spector's innovations became integral to the growing sophistication of popular music from 1965 onward.\n\nAlso during the early '60s, [[surf rock]] emerged, a rock subgenre that was centered in Southern California and based on beach and surfing themes, in addition to the usual songs about teenage romance and innocent fun. [[The Beach Boys]] quickly became the premier surf rock band and almost completely and single-handedly overshadowed the many lesser-known artists in the subgenre. Surf rock reached its peak in 1963\u20131965 before gradually being overtaken by bands influenced by the [[British Invasion]] and the counterculture movement.\n\nThe [[car song]] also emerged as a rock subgenre in the early 60s, which focused on teenagers' fascination with [[car culture]]. The Beach Boys also dominated this subgenre, along with the duo [[Jan and Dean]]. Such notable songs include \"[[Little Deuce Coupe (song)|Little Deuce Coupe]],\" \"[[409 (song)|409]],\" and \"[[Shut Down (The Beach Boys song)|Shut Down]],\" all by the Beach Boys; [[Jan and Dean]]'s \"[[Little Old Lady from Pasadena]]\" and \"[[Drag City (song)|Drag City]],\" [[Ronny and the Daytonas]]' \"[[Little GTO]],\" and many others. Like girl groups and surf rock, car songs also became overshadowed by the British Invasion and the counterculture movement.\n\nThe early 1960s also saw the golden age of another rock subgenre, the [[teen tragedy song]], which focused on lost teen romance caused by sudden death, mainly in [[traffic accident]]s. Such songs included [[Mark Dinning]]'s \"[[Teen Angel (song)|Teen Angel]],\" [[Ray Peterson]]'s \"[[Tell Laura I Love Her]],\" [[Jan and Dean]]'s \"[[Dead Man's Curve]],\" the [[The Shangri-Las|Shangri-Las']] \"[[Leader of the Pack]],\" and [[J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers|J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers']] \"[[Last Kiss]].\"\n\nWhile rock 'n' roll had \"disappeared\" from the U.S. charts in the early '60s, it never died out in Europe and Britain in particular was a hotbed of rock 'n' roll activity during this time. In late 1963, the Beatles embarked on their first US tour. A few months later, rock 'n' roll founding father [[Chuck Berry]] emerged from a 2-1/2-year prison stint and resumed recording and touring. The stage was set for the spectacular revival of rock music.\n\nIn the UK, the Beatles played raucous rock 'n' roll \u2013 as well as doo wop, girl-group songs, show tunes \u2013 and wore leather jackets. Their manager [[Brian Epstein]] encouraged the group to wear suits. [[Beatlemania]] abruptly exploded after the group's appearance on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1964. Late in 1965, the Beatles released the album ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' which marked the beginning of their transition to a sophisticated power pop group with elaborate studio arrangements and production, and a year after that, they gave up touring entirely to focus only on albums. A host of imitators followed the Beatles in the so-called British Invasion, including groups like the [[Rolling Stones]] and [[the Kinks]] who would become legends in their own right.\n\nAs the counterculture movement developed, artists began making new kinds of music influenced by the use of psychedelic drugs. Guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]] emerged onto the scene in 1967 with a radically new approach to electric guitar that replaced Chuck Berry, previously seen as the gold standard of rock guitar. Rock artists began to take on serious themes and social commentary/protest instead of simplistic pop themes.\n\nA major development in popular music during the mid-1960s was the movement away from singles and towards albums. Previously, popular music was based around the 45 single (or even earlier, the 78 single) and albums such as they existed were little more than a hit single or two backed with filler tracks, instrumentals, and covers. The development of the AOR (album oriented rock) format was complicated and involved several concurrent events such as Phil Spector's Wall of Sound, the introduction by Bob Dylan of \"serious\" lyrics to rock music, and the Beatles' new studio-based approach. In any case, after 1965 the vinyl LP had definitively taken over as the primary format for all popular music styles.\n\nBlues also continued to develop strongly during the '60s, but after 1965, it increasingly shifted to the young white rock audience and away from its traditional black audience, which moved on to other styles such as soul and funk.\n\nJazz music during the first half of the '60s was largely a continuation of '50s styles, retaining its core audience of young, urban, college-educated whites. By 1967, the death of several important jazz figures such as [[John Coltrane]] and [[Nat King Cole]] precipitated a decline in the genre. The takeover of rock in the late '60s largely spelled the end of jazz as a mainstream form of music, after it had dominated much of the first half of the 20th century.\n\n[[Country music]] gained popularity on the [[West coast of the United States|West Coast]], due in large part to the [[Bakersfield sound]], led by [[Buck Owens]] and [[Merle Haggard]]. Female country artists were also becoming more mainstream (in a genre dominated by men in prior decades), with such acts as [[Patsy Cline]], [[Loretta Lynn]], and [[Tammy Wynette]].\n\n'''Significant events in music in the 1960s:'''\n* [[Elvis Presley]] returned to civilian life in the U.S. after two years away in the [[U.S. Army]].

Movies began to break social taboos such as [[sex]] and [[violence]] causing both controversy and fascination. They turned increasingly dramatic, unbalanced, and hectic as the cultural revolution was starting. This was the beginning of the [[New Hollywood]] era that dominated the next decade in theatres and revolutionized the film industry. Films of this time also focused on the changes happening in the world. [[Dennis Hopper]]'s ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) focused on the drug culture of the time. Movies also became more sexually explicit, such as [[Roger Vadim]]'s'' [[Barbarella (film)|Barbarella]]'' (1968) as the [[counterculture]] progressed.\n\nIn Europe, [[Art Cinema]] gains wider distribution and sees movements like [[French New Wave|la Nouvelle Vague]] (The French New Wave) featuring French filmmakers such as [[Roger Vadim]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], [[Alain Resnais]], and [[Jean-Luc Godard]]; [[Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] documentary movement in Canada, France and the United States; [[Swedish cinema|Swedish filmmaker]] [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[cinema of Chile|Chilean filmmaker]] [[Alexandro Jodorowsky]] and [[Polish cinema|Polish filmmakers]] [[Roman Polanski]] and [[Wojciech Jerzy Has]] produced original and offbeat masterpieces and the high-point of [[Italian cinema|Italian filmmaking]] with [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and [[Federico Fellini]] making some of their most known films during this period. Notable films from this period include: ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', ''[[8\u00bd]]''; ''[[La Notte]]''; ''[[L'Eclisse]]'', ''[[The Red Desert]]''; ''[[Blowup]]''; ''[[Fellini Satyricon]]''; ''[[Accattone]]''; ''[[The Gospel According to St. Matthew (film)|The Gospel According to St. Matthew]]''; ''[[Theorem (film)|Theorem]]''; ''[[Winter Light]]''; ''[[The Silence (1963 film)|The Silence]]''; ''[[Persona (1966 film)|Persona]]''; ''[[Shame (1968 film)|Shame]]''; ''[[The Passion of Anna|A Passion]]''; ''[[Au Hasard Balthazar]]''; ''[[Mouchette]]''; ''[[Last Year at Marienbad]]''; ''[[Chronique d'un \u00e9t\u00e9]]''; ''[[Titicut Follies]]''; ''[[High School (1968 film)|High School]]''; ''[[Salesman (1969 film)|Salesman]]''; ''[[La jet\u00e9e]]''; ''[[Warrendale (film)|Warrendale]];'' ''[[Knife in the Water]]''; ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]''; ''[[The Saragossa Manuscript]]''; ''[[El Topo]]''; ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''; and the [[cinema verite]] ''[[Dont Look Back]]''.\n\nIn Japan, a film version of the story of the [[forty-seven ronin]] entitled ''[[Chushingura: Hana no Maki, Yuki no Maki]]'' directed by [[Hiroshi Inagaki]] was released in 1962, the legendary story was also remade as a television series in Japan. Academy Award-winning [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]] director [[Akira Kurosawa]] produced ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961), and ''[[Sanjuro]]'' (1962), which both starred [[Toshiro Mifune]] as a mysterious [[Samurai]] swordsman for hire. Like his previous films both had a profound influence around the world. The ''[[Spaghetti Western]]'' genre was a direct outgrowth of the Kurosawa films. The influence of these films is most apparent in [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964) starring [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]]'s ''[[Last Man Standing (1996 film)|Last Man Standing]]'' (1996). ''Yojimbo'' was also the origin of the \"[[Man with No Name]]\" trend which included Sergio Leone's ''[[For a Few Dollars More]]'', and ''[[The Good, The Bad and The Ugly]]'' both also starring Clint Eastwood, and arguably continued through his 1968 opus ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', starring [[Henry Fonda]], [[Charles Bronson]], [[Claudia Cardinale]], and [[Jason Robards]]. ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' a 1960 American [[western film]] directed by [[John Sturges]] was a [[remake]] of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1954 film, ''[[Seven Samurai]]''.\n\nThe 1960s were also about experimentation. With the explosion of light-weight and affordable cameras, the underground [[New American Cinema|avant-garde film]] movement thrived. Canada's [[Michael Snow]], Americans [[Kenneth Anger]], [[Stan Brakhage]], [[Andy Warhol]], and [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]]. Notable films in this genre are: ''[[Dog Star Man]]''; ''[[Scorpio Rising (film)|Scorpio Rising]]''; ''[[Wavelength (1967 film)|Wavelength]]''; ''[[Chelsea Girls]]''; ''[[Blow Job (film)|Blow Job]]''; ''[[Vinyl (1965 film)|Vinyl]]''; ''[[Flaming Creatures]]''.\n\nAside of [[Walt Disney]]'s most important blockbusters ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'', ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' and ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'', Animated feature films which are of notable status include ''[[Gay Purr-ee]]'', ''[[Hey There, It's Yogi Bear!]]'', ''[[The Man Called Flintstone]]'', ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'', ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' and ''[[A Boy Named Charlie Brown]]''.\n\n\n====Significant events in the film industry in the 1960s====\n\n*Removal of the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]'s [[Production Code]] in 1967.\n*The decline and end of the [[Studio system|Studio System]].\n*The rise of \"[[art house]]\" films and theaters.\n*The end of the [[classical hollywood cinema]] era.\n*The beginning of the [[New Hollywood]] Era due to the counterculture.\n*The rise of independent producers that worked outside the Studio System.\n*Move to all-color production in Hollywood films.\n*The invention of the [[Nagra]] 1/4\", sync-sound, portable open-reel tape deck.\n*[[Expo 67]] where new film formats like [[Imax]] were invented and new ways of displaying film were tested.\n*Flat-bed film editing tables appear, like the [[Steenbeck]], they eventually replace the [[Moviola]] editing platform.\n*The [[French New Wave]].\n*[[Direct Cinema]] and [[Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]] documentaries.\n*The beginning of the [[Golden Age of Porn]] in 1969, which continued throughout the 1970s and into the first half of the 1980s.\n\n===Television===\n{{Main|1960s in television}}\nThe most prominent American TV series of the 1960s include: ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]'', ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'', ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]'', ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', ''[[McHale's Navy]]'', ''[[Laugh-In]]'', ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[Gilligan's Island]], [[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'', ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'', ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'', ''[[The Danny Thomas Show]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[My Three Sons]]'', ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', ''[[Bewitched]]'' and ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]''. ''The Flintstones'' was a favoured show, receiving 420 million views an episode with an average of 69 million views a day.  Some programming such as ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]'' became controversial by challenging the foundations of America's corporate and governmental controls; making fun of world leaders, and questioning U.S. involvement in and escalation of the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n[[Walt Disney]], the founder of the [[Walt Disney Co.]] died on 15 December 1966, from a major tumor in his left lung.\n\n===Fashion===\n{{Main|1960s in fashion}}\nSignificant fashion trends of the 1960s include:\n* [[The Beatles]] exerted an enormous influence on young men's fashions and hairstyles in the 1960s which included most notably the [[Beatle haircut|mop-top haircut]], the [[Beatle boots]] and the [[Nehru jacket]].\n* The [[hippie]] movement late in the decade also had a strong influence on clothing styles, including [[Bell-bottoms|bell-bottom jeans]], [[tie-dye]] and [[batik]] fabrics, as well as [[Paisley (design)|paisley]] prints.\n* The [[bikini]] came into fashion in 1963 after being featured in the film ''[[Beach Party]]''.\n* [[Mary Quant]] invented the [[miniskirt]], which became one of the most popular fashion rages in the late 1960s among young women and teenage girls. Its popularity continued throughout the first half of the 1970s and then disappeared temporarily from mainstream fashion before making a comeback in the mid-1980s.\n* Men's mainstream hairstyles ranged from the [[pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]], the [[crew cut]], the [[flattop]] hairstyle, the tapered hairstyle, and short, parted hair in the early part of the decade, to longer parted hairstyles with [[sideburns]] towards the latter half of the decade.\n* Women's mainstream hairstyles ranged from [[Beehive (hairstyle)|beehive hairdos]], the bird's nest hairstyle, and the [[chignon (hairstyle)|chignon]] hairstyle in the early part of the decade, to very short styles popularized by [[Twiggy]] and [[Mia Farrow]] in [[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]] towards the latter half of the decade.\n* African-American hairstyles for men and women included the [[afro]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" perrow=\"5\">\nFile:Mop-top hair.jpg|The [[Beatle haircut|mop-top haircut]], which became popular due to the Beatles but was considered at the time a rebellious hairstyle, was particularly fashionable among young men during the decade\nFile:On the Beach at Tiberias.jpg|The [[bikini]] became a fashionable item in the Western world during the decade\nFile:Londons_Carnaby_Street,_1966.jpg|\"Swinging London\" fashions on [[Carnaby Street]], c. 1966\nFile:TieDyeShirtMpegMan.jpg|[[Tie-dye]] shirt\n</gallery>\n{{-}}\n\n===Literature===\n{{see also|List of years in literature#1960s}}\n\n===Sports===\n\n====Olympics====\nThere were six [[Olympic Games]] held during the decade.

Major League Baseball sanctioned both the [[Houston Colt .45s]] and the [[New York Mets]] as new [[National League]] franchises in 1962.\n\nIn 1969, the [[American League]] expanded when the [[Kansas City Royals]] and [[Seattle Pilots]], were admitted to the league prompting the expansion of the post-season (in the form of the [[League Championship Series]]) for the first time since the creation of the World Series. The Pilots stayed just one season in Seattle before moving and becoming the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] in 1970. The National League also added two teams in 1969, the [[Montreal Expos]] and [[San Diego Padres]]. By 1969, the New York Mets won the [[World Series]] in only the 8th year of the team's existence.\n\n====Basketball====\nThe [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] tournaments during the 1960s were dominated by the [[Boston Celtics]], who won eight straight titles from 1959 to 1966 and added two more consecutive championships in 1968 and 1969, aided by such players as [[Bob Cousy]], [[Bill Russell (basketball)|Bill Russell]] and [[John Havlicek]]. Other notable NBA players included [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Elgin Baylor]], [[Jerry West]] and [[Oscar Robertson]].\n\nAt the [[NCAA]] level, the [[UCLA Bruins]] also proved dominant. Coached by [[John Wooden]], they were helped by [[Lew Alcindor]] and by [[Bill Walton]] to win championships and dominate the American college basketball landscape during the decade.\n\n====Disc sports (Frisbee)====\nAlternative sports, using the flying disc, began in the mid-sixties. As numbers of young people became alienated from social norms, they resisted and looked for alternatives. They would form what would become known as the [[counterculture]]. The forms of escape and resistance would manifest in many ways including social activism, alternative lifestyles, experimental living through foods, dress, music and alternative recreational activities, including that of throwing a [[Frisbee]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Countercultural Sports in America: The History and Meaning of Ultimate Frisbee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qycPRAAACAAJ|author=Jordan Holtzman-Conston |publisher=Waltham, Mass|year= 2010|isbn=978-3838311951}}</ref> Starting with promotional efforts from [[Wham-O]] and [[Irwin Toy]] (Canada), a few tournaments and professionals using [[Frisbee]] show tours to perform at universities, fairs and sporting events, disc sports such as [[Flying disc freestyle|freestyle]], [[double disc court]], [[Guts (flying disc game)|guts]], [[Ultimate (sport)|disc ultimate]] and [[disc golf]] became this sports first events.<ref>{{cite web|title=World Flying Disc Federation|url=http://wfdf.org/|work=WFDF Official Website|accessdate=19 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=World Flying Disc Federation |url=http://wfdf.org/history-stats/history-of-fyling-disc |work=History of the Flying Disc |accessdate=20 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019095944/http://wfdf.org/history-stats/history-of-fyling-disc |archivedate=19 October 2013 }}</ref> Two sports, the team sport of [[Ultimate (sport)|disc ultimate]] and [[disc golf]] are very popular worldwide and are now being played semi professionally.<ref>{{cite web|title=Professional Disc Golf Association|url=http://www.pdga.com/|work=PDGA Official Website|accessdate=19 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=American Ultimate Disc League|url=http://theaudl.com/|work=AUDL Official Website|accessdate=20 October 2013}}</ref> The [[World Flying Disc Federation]], [[Professional Disc Golf Association]] and the Freestyle Players Association are the official rules and sanctioning organizations for flying disc sports worldwide.
