As discussed above, in this case there exists a regular conditional probability with respect to ''T''. Moreover, we can alternatively define the '''regular conditional probability''' for an event ''A'' given a particular value ''t'' of the random variable ''T'' in the following manner:\n\n:<math> P (A|T=t) = \\lim_{U\\supset \\{T= t\\}} \\frac {P(A\\cap U)}{P(U)},</math>\n\nwhere the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] is taken over the [[Net (mathematics)|net]] of [[Open set|open]] [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhoods]] ''U'' of ''t'' as they become [[Subset|smaller with respect to set inclusion]].  This limit is defined if and only if the probability space is [[Radon space|Radon]], and only in the support of ''T'', as described in the article.   This is the restriction of the transition probability to the support of ''T''.  To describe this limiting process rigorously:\n\nFor every <math>\\epsilon > 0,</math> there exists an open neighborhood ''U'' of the event {''T=t''}, such that for every open ''V'' with <math>\\{T=t\\} \\subset V \\subset U,</math>\n:<math>\\left|\\frac {P(A\\cap V)}{P(V)}-L\\right| < \\epsilon,</math>\nwhere <math>L = P (A|T=t)</math> is the limit.\n\n==Example==\nTo continue with our motivating example above, we consider a real-valued random variable ''X'' and write\n:<math>P(A|X=x_0) = \\nu(x_0,A) = \\lim_{\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0+} \\frac {P(A\\cap\\{x_0-\\epsilon < X < x_0+\\epsilon\\})}{P(\\{x_0-\\epsilon < X < x_0+\\epsilon\\})},</math>\n(where <math>x_0=2/3</math> for the example given.) This limit, if it exists, is a regular conditional probability for ''X'', restricted to <math>\\mathrm{supp}\\,X.</math>\n\nIn any case, it is easy to see that this limit fails to exist for <math>x_0</math> outside the support of ''X'': since the support of a random variable is defined as the set of all points in its state space whose every [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] has positive probability, for every point <math>x_0</math> outside the support of ''X'' (by definition) there will be an <math>\\epsilon > 0</math> such that <math>P(\\{x_0-\\epsilon < X < x_0+\\epsilon\\})=0.</math>\n\nThus if ''X'' is distributed uniformly on <math>[0,1],</math> it is truly meaningless to condition a probability on \"<math>X=3/2</math>\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[Conditioning (probability)]]\n* [[Disintegration theorem]]\n* [[Adherent point]]\n* [[Limit point]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://planetmath.org/regularconditionalprobability Regular Conditional Probability] on [http://planetmath.org/ PlanetMath]\n\n[[Category:Conditional probability]]\n[[Category:Measure theory]]\n", "name_user": "104.148.196.153", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Removed some untrue stuff.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_conditional_probability"}

For his actions, he was awarded the Medal of Honor nine months later, on January 15, 1945.\n\n== Medal of Honor citation ==\nMichael's official Medal of Honor citation reads:\n<blockquote>For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty while serving as pilot of a B17 aircraft on a [[Heavy bomber|heavy-bombardment]] mission to Germany, April 11, 1944. The group in which 1st Lt. Michael was flying was attacked by a swarm of fighters. His plane was singled out and the fighters pressed their attacks home recklessly, completely disregarding the Allied fighter escort and their own intense [[flak]]. His plane was riddled from nose to tail with exploding cannon shells and knocked out of formation, with a large number of fighters following it down, blasting it with cannon fire as it descended. A cannon shell exploded in the [[cockpit]], wounded the copilot, wrecked the instruments, and blew out the side window. 1st Lt. Michael was seriously and painfully wounded in the right thigh. [[Hydraulic fluid]] filmed over the windshield making visibility impossible, and smoke filled the cockpit. The controls failed to respond and 3,000 feet were lost before he succeeded in leveling off. The radio operator informed him that the whole bomb bay was in flames as a result of the explosion of 3 cannon shells, which had ignited the [[Incendiary device|incendiaries]]. With a full load of incendiaries in the bomb bay and a considerable gas load in the tanks, the danger of fire enveloping the plane and the tanks exploding seemed imminent. When the emergency release lever failed to function, 1st Lt. Michael at once gave the order to bail out and 7 of the crew left the plane. Seeing the [[Bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] firing the [[Flight officer|navigator]]'s gun at the enemy planes, 1st Lt. Michael ordered him to bail out as the plane was liable to explode any minute. When the bombardier looked for his parachute he found that it had been riddled with [[20 mm caliber|20mm.]] fragments and was useless. 1st Lt. Michael, seeing the ruined parachute, realized that if the plane was abandoned the bombardier would perish and decided that the only chance would be a crash landing. Completely disregarding his own painful and profusely bleeding wounds, but thinking only of the safety of the remaining crewmembers, he gallantly evaded the enemy, using violent evasive action despite the battered condition of his plane. After the plane had been under sustained enemy attack for fully 45 minutes, 1st Lt. Michael finally lost the persistent fighters in a cloud bank. Upon emerging, an accurate barrage of flak caused him to come down to treetop level where flak towers poured a continuous rain of fire on the plane. He continued into [[France]], realizing that at any moment a crash landing might have to be attempted, but trying to get as far as possible to increase the escape possibilities if a safe landing could be achieved. 1st Lt. Michael flew the plane until he became exhausted from the loss of blood, which had formed on the floor in pools, and he lost consciousness. The copilot succeeded in reaching England and sighted an [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] field near the coast. 1st Lt. Michael finally regained consciousness and insisted upon taking over the controls to land the plane. The [[Landing gear|undercarriage]] was useless; the bomb bay doors were jammed open; the hydraulic system and [[altimeter]] were shot out. In addition, there was no [[airspeed indicator]], the [[ball turret]] was jammed with the guns pointing downward, and the [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] would not respond. Despite these apparently insurmountable obstacles, he landed the plane without mishap.<ref name=ACMH>{{Cite web\n  |publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]]\n  |title = Medal of Honor recipients - World War II (M-S)\n  |work = Medal of Honor citations\n  |date = June 8, 2009\n  |url = http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/wwII-m-s.html\n  |accessdate = 2007-12-13}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Edward S Michael.JPEG|thumb|Edward S.

The plot has Bond on an assignment to bankrupt [[terrorist financing|terrorist financier]] [[Le Chiffre]] in a high-stakes [[poker]] game at the Casino Royale in [[Montenegro]]; Bond falls in love with femme fatale [[Vesper Lynd]], a treasury employee assigned to provide the money he needs for the game. The film begins a [[story arc]] that continues in the 2008 film, ''[[Quantum of Solace]]''.\n\nCasting involved a widespread search for a new actor to succeed [[Pierce Brosnan]] as James Bond; the choice of Craig, announced in October 2005, drew controversy. [[Location shooting|Location filming]] took place in the [[Czech Republic]], [[the Bahamas]], [[Italy]], and the [[United Kingdom]] with interior sets built at [[Barrandov Studios]] and [[Pinewood Studios]].\n\n''Casino Royale'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on 14 November 2006. It received an overwhelmingly positive critical response, with reviewers highlighting Craig's reinvention of the character and the film's departure from the tropes of previous Bond films.<ref>{{Citation|title=Casino Royale|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/casino_royale/|language=en|accessdate=2017-11-21}}</ref> It earned ${{Format price|606000000}} worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing ''James Bond'' film until the release of ''[[Skyfall]]'' in 2012.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent James Bond gains his status as a [[00 agent]] by assassinating traitorous section chief Dryden and his contact.\n\nIn [[Uganda]], the mysterious [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]] introduces Steven Obanno, a high-ranking member of the [[Lord's Resistance Army]], to [[Le Chiffre]], a [[private bank]]er to terrorists. Obanno entrusts Le Chiffre with a large sum of money to invest; Le Chiffre subsequently buys [[put option]]s on [[aerospace manufacturer]] Skyfleet, betting on the company's failure given his insider knowledge of a terrorist attack.\n\nIn [[Madagascar]], Bond pursues bomb-maker Mollaka to an [[embassy]], killing him and blowing up the building. In [[London]], MI6 chief [[M (James Bond)|M]] admonishes Bond for ignoring [[diplomatic immunity|international law]] and her orders to capture Mollaka alive. Clues point to corrupt [[Greece|Greek]] official [[Alex Dimitrios]], whom Bond finds in the [[Bahamas]]. After winning his 1964 [[Aston Martin DB5]] in a poker game and seducing his wife Solange, Bond pursues Dimitrios to [[Miami]], where he kills him. Following his henchman Carlos to the airport, Bond thwarts the destruction of [[Skyfleet S570|Skyfleet's airliner]] and Le Chiffre loses Obanno's money.\n\nTo recoup the money, Le Chiffre organizes a high-stakes [[Texas hold 'em]] tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. MI6 enters Bond in the tournament, believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre to seek asylum with the [[British government]] in exchange for information on his clients. Bond is paired with [[Vesper Lynd]], a [[HM Treasury|British Treasury]] agent protecting the $10&nbsp;million [[buying in (poker)|buy-in]]. In Montenegro, they meet their contact, [[Ren\u00e9 Mathis]].\n\nBond initially gains the upper hand, deducing Le Chiffre's [[Tell (poker)|tell]]. Obanno ambushes Le Chiffre and his girlfriend Valenka with a [[machete]], but allows him to continue playing to win back the money. Obanno's bodyguard spots Bond and Vesper, but Bond kills Obanno. After comforting a traumatised Vesper, Bond loses his [[poker staking|stake]] when Le Chiffre is tipped off to his own tell, and Vesper refuses to authorize the $5 million to buy back in. Preparing to kill Le Chiffre, Bond meets fellow player [[Felix Leiter]], a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent, who agrees to stake Bond in exchange for taking Le Chiffre into American custody. \n\nBond rebuilds his position until Valenka poisons his [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]] with [[digitalis]]. Retrieving an [[antidote]] and [[defibrillation|defibrillator]] from his [[Aston Martin DBS V12]], Bond passes out until Vesper rescues him. Bond returns to the game, which culminates in a $115 million hand in which the remaining players go [[All in (poker)|all in]]. Le Chiffre trumps the others, but Bond wins with a [[straight flush]].\n\nApparently tipped off by Mathis, Le Chiffre kidnaps Vesper. In pursuit, Bond crashes his car to avoid Vesper, tied up in the road. Le Chiffre brings the captive Bond and Vesper to an abandoned ship and tortures Bond to reveal the account number and password to the winnings, but Bond refuses. Le Chiffre prepares to castrate Bond, but Mr. White barges in and kills Le Chiffre, leaving Bond and Vesper alive.\n\nBond awakens in an MI6 hospital and has Mathis arrested as the traitor. After transferring the winnings, Bond goes away with Vesper, with whom he has fallen in love. He resigns from MI6 and they run away to [[Venice]], but when M reveals the money was never deposited, Bond realises Vesper has betrayed him. He follows her to a handoff of the money, where gunmen take her captive. Bond shoots the building's flotation devices, causing the foundation to sink into the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]]. He kills the gunmen but Vesper, imprisoned in an elevator, locks herself inside as the lift plunges into the rising water. Bond is unable to free Vesper before she drowns and his efforts to [[Resuscitation|resuscitate]] her fail. Mr. White escapes with the money.\n\nM informs Bond that the organisation behind Le Chiffre had threatened to kill Vesper's lover unless she became a [[double agent]]; she likely made a deal, trading the money for Bond's life. Bond coldly renounces Vesper as a traitor and tells M he will return to service. At an estate in [[Lake Como]], Bond locates Mr. White, shooting him in the leg and introducing himself: \"The name's Bond. James Bond.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]]: A British MI6 officer who, after being assigned 00 status, is sent on a mission to arrest a bomb-maker in [[Madagascar]], where he stumbles upon Le Chiffre's terrorist cell and is then sent to defeat him in a high-stakes poker game at Casino Royale.\n* [[Eva Green]] as [[Vesper Lynd]]: An agent for Her Majesty's Treasury assigned to supervise Bond and finance him in a high-stakes poker game.\n* [[Mads Mikkelsen]] as [[Le Chiffre]]: A banker who services many of the world's terrorists, he is a mathematical genius and expert chess player, and uses these skills when playing poker.\n* [[Judi Dench]] as [[M (James Bond)|M]]: The head of MI6, although she feels she has promoted Bond too soon and chides him for his rash actions, she acts as an important maternal figure in his life.

Kleinman said, \"The hearts not only represent cards but the tribulations of Bond's love story. So I took that as inspiration to use playing card graphics in different ways in the titles,\" like a club representing a puff of gun smoke, and slashed arteries spurting thousands of tiny hearts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Credits design |url=http://www.mi6-hq.com/news/index.php?itemid=4511 |work=[[MI6.co.uk|MI6-HQ.COM]] |date=6 December 2006 |accessdate=3 April 2007}}</ref> In creating the shadow images of the sequence, Kleinman digitised the footage of Craig and the film's stuntmen on the [[Inferno (operating system)|Inferno]] visual effects system, at [[Framestore CFC]] in London; the actors' silhouettes were incorporated into more than 20 digitally animated scenes depicting intricate and innovative card patterns. Kleinman decided not to use the female silhouettes commonly seen throughout the Bond title sequences, considering that the women did not fit with both the film's spirit and the storyline following Bond falling in love.<ref>{{cite web|title=Design / Casino Royale's Title Sequence|publisher=[[Framestore]] |url=http://www.framestore.com/#/Design/CasinoRoyale,TitleSequence |accessdate=29 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nFor the rest of the film, [[Chris Corbould]], the special effects and miniature effects supervisor, returned to a more realistic style of film making and significantly reduced digital effects. According to Corbould, \"CGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but I will fight to the tooth and nail to do something for real. It's the best way to go\".<ref name=\"Real\"/> Three scenes involving primarily physical effects in the film were the chase at a building site in Madagascar, the [[Miami Airport]] chase sequence, and the sinking Venetian house, with sets located on the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]] and in Pinewood Studios.<ref name=\"Real\"/>\n\nThe first scenes shot were ones involving a Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas on the site of a derelict hotel with which Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted  in 1977 during the filming of ''The Spy Who Loved Me''.<ref name=\"Real\"/> In the scene, Bond drives a [[Excavator|digger]] towards the building, slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger and reinforced with steel.<ref name=\"Real\"/>\n\nThe sequence at Miami International Airport was partly shot at the [[Dunsfold Aerodrome]], in Surrey, which is known from British car show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', with some footage from the Prague and Miami airports.<ref name=\"Real\"/> In filming the scene in which the engine thrust of the moving aircraft blows the police car high into the air, second unit directors Ian Lowe, Terry Madden, and Alex Witt used a crane with a strong lead cable attached to the rear bumper of the vehicle to move it up and backwards at the moment of full extension away from the plane.<ref name=\"Real\"/>\n\nThe Skyfleet S570 aircraft in the film was an ex-[[British Airways]] 747-200B [[G-BDXJ]], which had its engines removed and was modified for its appearance in the film. The modified aircraft had the outboard engines replaced by external fuel tanks, while the inboard engines were replaced by a mock-up pair of engines on each inboard pylon. The cockpit profile was altered to make the 747 look like a prototype of an advanced airliner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/planes/q0297.shtml |title=Boeing 747 in Casino Royale}}</ref> The plane used can be seen on the BBC motoring programme ''Top Gear'' on the [[Top Gear Test Track|Test Track]].\n\nThe sinking of the Venetian house at the climax of the film featured the largest rig ever built for a Bond film,<ref name=\"Real\"/> with tank consisting of a Venetian [[piazza]] and the interior of an abandoned house being constructed. The rig, weighing some 90 tons, incorporated electronics with hydraulic valves that were closely controlled by computer because of the dynamic movement within the system on its two axes. The same computer system also controlled the exterior model, which the effects team had built to one-third scale to film the building eventually collapsing into the Venetian canal. The model elevator within the rig could be immersed in {{convert|19|ft|m}} of water, and used banks of compressors to strictly regulate movement.<ref name=\"Real\"/>\n[[File:Aston Martin DBS (Casino Royale) front-left-2 National Motor Museum, Beaulieu.jpg|thumbnail|right|Aston Martin DBS driven by Bond in the film]]\nAt the time of filming, [[Aston Martin]] was still in the final phases of designing the [[Aston Martin DBS|DBS]].

Also a white prototype DB9 manual was supplied to the film crew so that the stunt drivers had something to practice with.<ref>https://astonmartins.com/car/dbs-v12-for-007/</ref> Owing to the low centre of gravity of the vehicle, an 18-inch (450&nbsp;mm) ramp had to be implemented on the road tarmac at [[Millbrook Proving Ground]]s and Adam Kirley, the stunt driver who performed the stunt, had to use an [[air blaster|air cannon]] located behind the driver's seat to propel the car into a roll at the precise moment of impact. At a speed exceeding <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">70&nbsp;mph&nbsp;(113&nbsp;km/h)</span>, the car rotated seven times while being filmed, and was confirmed by the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' on 5 November 2006 as a new [[world record]].<ref name=\"Real\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Casino Royale (2006 soundtrack)}}\nThe soundtrack of ''Casino Royale'', released by [[Sony Classical Records]] on 14 November 2006, featured music composed by veteran composer [[David Arnold]], his fourth soundtrack for the ''Bond'' film series, while Nicholas Dodd orchestrated and conducted the [[Film score|score]].

The plot has Bond on an assignment to bankrupt [[terrorist financing|terrorist financier]] [[Le Chiffre]] in a high-stakes [[poker]] game at the Casino Royale in [[Montenegro]]; Bond falls in love with femme fatale [[Vesper Lynd]], a treasury employee assigned to provide the money he needs for the game. The film begins a [[story arc]] that continues in the 2008 film, ''[[Quantum of Solace]]''.\n\nCasting involved a widespread search for a new actor to succeed [[Pierce Brosnan]] as James Bond; the choice of Craig, announced in October 2005, drew controversy. [[Location shooting|Location filming]] took place in the [[Czech Republic]], [[the Bahamas]], [[Italy]], and the [[United Kingdom]] with interior sets built at [[Barrandov Studios]] and [[Pinewood Studios]].\n\n''Casino Royale'' premiered at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] on 14 November 2006. It received an overwhelmingly positive critical response, with reviewers highlighting Craig's reinvention of the character and the film's departure from the tropes of previous Bond films.<ref>{{Citation|title=Casino Royale|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/casino_royale/|language=en|accessdate=2017-11-21}}</ref> It earned ${{Format price|606000000}} worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing ''James Bond'' film until the release of ''[[Skyfall]]'' in 2012.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent James Bond gains his status as a [[00 agent]] by assassinating traitorous section chief Dryden and his contact.\n\nIn [[Uganda]], the mysterious [[Mr. White (James Bond)|Mr. White]] introduces Steven Obanno, a high-ranking member of the [[Lord's Resistance Army]], to [[Le Chiffre]], a [[private bank]]er to terrorists. Obanno entrusts Le Chiffre with a large sum of money to invest; Le Chiffre subsequently buys [[put option]]s on [[aerospace manufacturer]] Skyfleet, betting on the company's failure given his insider knowledge of a terrorist attack.\n\nIn [[Madagascar]], Bond pursues bomb-maker Mollaka to an [[embassy]], killing him and blowing up the building. In [[London]], MI6 chief [[M (James Bond)|M]] admonishes Bond for ignoring [[diplomatic immunity|international law]] and her orders to capture Mollaka alive. Clues point to corrupt [[Greece|Greek]] official [[Alex Dimitrios]], whom Bond finds in the [[Bahamas]]. After winning his 1964 [[Aston Martin DB5]] in a poker game and seducing his wife Solange, Bond pursues Dimitrios to [[Miami]], where he kills him. Following his henchman Carlos to the airport, Bond thwarts the destruction of [[Skyfleet S570|Skyfleet's airliner]] and Le Chiffre loses Obanno's money.\n\nTo recoup the money, Le Chiffre organizes a high-stakes [[Texas hold 'em]] tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. MI6 enters Bond in the tournament, believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre to seek asylum with the [[British government]] in exchange for information on his clients. Bond is paired with [[Vesper Lynd]], a [[HM Treasury|British Treasury]] agent protecting the $10&nbsp;million [[buying in (poker)|buy-in]]. In Montenegro, they meet their contact, [[Ren\u00e9 Mathis]].\n\nBond initially gains the upper hand, deducing Le Chiffre's [[Tell (poker)|tell]]. Obanno ambushes Le Chiffre and his girlfriend Valenka with a [[machete]], but allows him to continue playing to win back the money. Obanno's bodyguard spots Bond and Vesper, but Bond kills Obanno. After comforting a traumatised Vesper, Bond loses his [[poker staking|stake]] when Le Chiffre is tipped off to his own tell, and Vesper refuses to authorize the $5 million to buy back in. Preparing to kill Le Chiffre, Bond meets fellow player [[Felix Leiter]], a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent, who agrees to stake Bond in exchange for taking Le Chiffre into American custody. \n\nBond rebuilds his position until Valenka poisons his [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]] with [[digitalis]]. Retrieving an [[antidote]] and [[defibrillation|defibrillator]] from his [[Aston Martin DBS V12]], Bond passes out until Vesper rescues him. Bond returns to the game, which culminates in a $115 million hand in which the remaining players go [[All in (poker)|all in]]. Le Chiffre trumps the others, but Bond wins with a [[straight flush]].\n\nApparently tipped off by Mathis, Le Chiffre kidnaps Vesper. In pursuit, Bond crashes his car to avoid Vesper, tied up in the road. Le Chiffre brings the captive Bond and Vesper to an abandoned ship and tortures Bond to reveal the account number and password to the winnings, but Bond refuses. Le Chiffre prepares to castrate Bond, but Mr. White barges in and kills Le Chiffre, leaving Bond and Vesper alive.\n\nBond awakens in an MI6 hospital and has Mathis arrested as the traitor. After transferring the winnings, Bond goes away with Vesper, with whom he has fallen in love. He resigns from MI6 and they run away to [[Venice]], but when M reveals the money was never deposited, Bond realises Vesper has betrayed him. He follows her to a handoff of the money, where gunmen take her captive. Bond shoots the building's flotation devices, causing the foundation to sink into the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]]. He kills the gunmen but Vesper, imprisoned in an elevator, locks herself inside as the lift plunges into the rising water. Bond is unable to free Vesper before she drowns and his efforts to [[Resuscitation|resuscitate]] her fail. Mr. White escapes with the money.\n\nM informs Bond that the organisation behind Le Chiffre had threatened to kill Vesper's lover unless she became a [[double agent]]; she likely made a deal, trading the money for Bond's life. Bond coldly renounces Vesper as a traitor and tells M he will return to service. At an estate in [[Lake Como]], Bond locates Mr. White, shooting him in the leg and introducing himself: \"The name's Bond. James Bond.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]]: A British MI6 officer who, after being assigned 00 status, is sent on a mission to arrest a bomb-maker in [[Madagascar]], where he stumbles upon Le Chiffre's terrorist cell and is then sent to defeat him in a high-stakes poker game at Casino Royale.\n* [[Eva Green]] as [[Vesper Lynd]]: An agent for Her Majesty's Treasury assigned to supervise Bond and finance him in a high-stakes poker game.\n* [[Mads Mikkelsen]] as [[Le Chiffre]]: A banker who services many of the world's terrorists, he is a mathematical genius and expert chess player, and uses these skills when playing poker.\n* [[Judi Dench]] as [[M (James Bond)|M]]: The head of MI6, although she feels she has promoted Bond too soon and chides him for his rash actions, she acts as an important maternal figure in his life.

A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger and reinforced with steel.<ref name=\"Real\"/>\n\nThe sequence at Miami International Airport was partly shot at the [[Dunsfold Aerodrome]], in Surrey, which is known from British car show ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', with some footage from the Prague and Miami airports.<ref name=\"Real\"/> In filming the scene in which the engine thrust of the moving aircraft blows the police car high into the air, second unit directors Ian Lowe, Terry Madden, and Alex Witt used a crane with a strong lead cable attached to the rear bumper of the vehicle to move it up and backwards at the moment of full extension away from the plane.<ref name=\"Real\"/>\n\nThe Skyfleet S570 aircraft in the film was an ex-[[British Airways]] 747-200B [[G-BDXJ]], which had its engines removed and was modified for its appearance in the film.
