About the situation in April 1793, when General [[Dumouriez]] had just been [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)|defeated at Neerwinden]] and defected to Austria, causing despair in France, it states: \"Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements de cette \u00e9poque sont les plus p\u00e9nibles \u00e0 d\u00e9crire de tous ceux qui ont signal\u00e9 ''les guerres de la coalition''.\" (\"The events of that time are the most painful to describe of all those that marked ''the wars of the coalition''.\")<ref>{{Cite book |author=Arnould |date=1803 |title=R\u00e9sultats des guerres, des n\u00e9gociations et des trait\u00e9s qui ont pr\u00e9ced\u0301\u00e9 et suivi la coalition contre la France |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DeYzAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA197 |location=Paris |publisher=Badouin |accessdate=27 May 2016 |language=fr}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1805, the ''Salzburger Intelligenzblatt'' was one of the first to number the Coalition Wars when it discussed \"Das Staatsinteresse von Baiern bei dem dritten Koalitions-Kriege\" (\"The national interest of Bavaria in the Third Coalition War\").<ref>{{Cite journal |last= |first= |date=January 1805 |title=Intelligenzblatt von Salzburg: 1805 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cYxEAAAAcAAJ&pg=RA1-PA143 |journal=Salzburger Intelligenzblatt |publisher=Verlag des Zeitungs-Comtoirs |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=143\u20134 |accessdate=27 May 2016 |language=de}}</ref> Although the Third Coalition had been formed by that time, war had not yet broken out;<ref>Great Britain had already declared war on France in 1803, but it had been [[Napoleonic Wars#War between Britain and France, 1803\u20131814|fighting France on its own]] while forming the Third Coalition, whose other members (Austria, Russia, Sweden, Naples and Sicily) would not join the war against France until September 1805.</ref> the Austrian newspaper discussed why the neighbouring [[Electorate of Bavaria]] was likely to side with the French Republic rather than the Austrian-led Coalition. On 30 September 1805, a few days after the launch of the [[Ulm Campaign]], Emperor Napoleon addressed his troops in Strasbourg, starting his speech with the words: \"Soldats, la guerre de la troisi\u00e8me coalition est commenc\u00e9e.\" (\"Soldiers, the war of the third coalition has begun.\")<ref>{{Cite book |last=Guizot |first=Fran\u00e7ois |authorlink1=Fran\u00e7ois Guizot |date=2015 |title=L'histoire de France depuis 1789 jusqu'en 1848 racont\u00e9e \u00e0 mes petits-enfants |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VimiBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT491 |location= |publisher=Primento |page=491 |isbn=9782335028768 |accessdate=27 May 2016 |language=fr}}</ref>\n\n=== Compared to other terms ===\nThe term is distinct from \"[[French Revolutionary Wars]]\", which covers any war involving Revolutionary France between 1792 and 1799, when Napoleon seized power with the [[Coup of 18 Brumaire]] (9 November 1799), which is usually considered the end of the French Revolution. Since the War of the Second Coalition (1798\u20131802) had already begun when Napoleon seized power, the war as a whole may<ref name=\"Encarta coalitieoorlogen\"/> or may not be counted amongst the French Revolutionary Wars, which therefore may end in 1799, 1801 ([[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]]) or 1802 ([[Treaty of Amiens]]).\n\nIt also differs from \"[[Napoleonic Wars]]\", which is variously defined as covering any war involving France ruled by Napoleon between 1799 and 1815 (which includes the War of the Second Coalition, 1798\u20131802), or not commencing until the [[War of the Third Coalition]] (1803/05, depending on periodisation). In the latter case, historians do not term the War of the Second Coalition \"Napoleonic\", since Napoleon did not initiate it himself, but merely \"inherited\" it from the Revolutionary French Directory which he overthrew during the war.\n\nBecause it only pertains to wars involving any of the Coalition parties, not all wars counted amongst the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars are considered \"Coalition Wars\". For example, the [[French invasion of Switzerland]] (1798, between the First and Second Coalition), the [[Stecklikrieg]] (1802, between the Second and Third Coalition) and the [[French invasion of Russia]] (1812, between the Fifth and Sixth Coalition) were not \"Coalition Wars\", since France fought against a single opponent.\n{{Timeline Coalition Wars}}\n\n== Coalition parties ==\nThe main European powers who forged the various anti-French Coalitions were [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], although except for Great Britain not all of them were involved in every Coalition. Smaller powers that occasionally joined the Coalitions include [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont\u2013Sardinia]], the [[Dutch Republic]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Sweden|Sweden]], [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] and various German and Italian states. The First until Fifth Coalitions fell apart when one or more parties were defeated by France and were forced to leave the alliance, and sometimes became French allies; the Sixth and Seventh were dissolved after Napoleon was defeated in 1814 and 1815 and a new balance of power was established between the parties at the [[Congress of Vienna]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%; margin:1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Members of each Coalition\n!

About the situation in April 1793, when General [[Dumouriez]] had just been [[Battle of Neerwinden (1793)|defeated at Neerwinden]] and defected to Austria, causing despair in France, it states: \"Les \u00e9v\u00e9nements de cette \u00e9poque sont les plus p\u00e9nibles \u00e0 d\u00e9crire de tous ceux qui ont signal\u00e9 ''les guerres de la coalition''.\" (\"The events of that time are the most painful to describe of all those that marked ''the wars of the coalition''.\")<ref>{{Cite book |author=Arnould |date=1803 |title=R\u00e9sultats des guerres, des n\u00e9gociations et des trait\u00e9s qui ont pr\u00e9ced\u0301\u00e9 et suivi la coalition contre la France |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DeYzAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA197 |location=Paris |publisher=Badouin |accessdate=27 May 2016 |language=fr}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1805, the ''Salzburger Intelligenzblatt'' was one of the first to number the Coalition Wars when it discussed \"Das Staatsinteresse von Baiern bei dem dritten Koalitions-Kriege\" (\"The national interest of Bavaria in the Third Coalition War\").<ref>{{Cite journal |last= |first= |date=January 1805 |title=Intelligenzblatt von Salzburg: 1805 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cYxEAAAAcAAJ&pg=RA1-PA143 |journal=Salzburger Intelligenzblatt |publisher=Verlag des Zeitungs-Comtoirs |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=143\u20134 |accessdate=27 May 2016 |language=de}}</ref> Although the Third Coalition had been formed by that time, war had not yet broken out;<ref>Great Britain had already declared war on France in 1803, but it had been [[Napoleonic Wars#War between Britain and France, 1803\u20131814|fighting France on its own]] while forming the Third Coalition, whose other members (Austria, Russia, Sweden, Naples and Sicily) would not join the war against France until September 1805.</ref> the Austrian newspaper discussed why the neighbouring [[Electorate of Bavaria]] was likely to side with the French Republic rather than the Austrian-led Coalition. On 30 September 1805, a few days after the launch of the [[Ulm Campaign]], Emperor Napoleon addressed his troops in Strasbourg, starting his speech with the words: \"Soldats, la guerre de la troisi\u00e8me coalition est commenc\u00e9e.\" (\"Soldiers, the war of the third coalition has begun.\")<ref>{{Cite book |last=Guizot |first=Fran\u00e7ois |authorlink1=Fran\u00e7ois Guizot |date=2015 |title=L'histoire de France depuis 1789 jusqu'en 1848 racont\u00e9e \u00e0 mes petits-enfants |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VimiBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT491 |location= |publisher=Primento |page=491 |isbn=9782335028768 |accessdate=27 May 2016 |language=fr}}</ref>\n\n=== Compared to other terms ===\nThe term is distinct from \"[[French Revolutionary Wars]]\", which covers any war involving Revolutionary France between 1792 and 1799, when Napoleon seized power with the [[Coup of 18 Brumaire]] (9 November 1799), which is usually considered the end of the French Revolution. Since the War of the Second Coalition (1798\u20131802) had already begun when Napoleon seized power, the war as a whole may<ref name=\"Encarta coalitieoorlogen\"/> or may not be counted amongst the French Revolutionary Wars, which therefore may end in 1799, 1801 ([[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]]) or 1802 ([[Treaty of Amiens]]).\n\nIt also differs from \"[[Napoleonic Wars]]\", which is variously defined as covering any war involving France ruled by Napoleon between 1799 and 1815 (which includes the War of the Second Coalition, 1798\u20131802), or not commencing until the [[War of the Third Coalition]] (1803/05, depending on periodisation). In the latter case, historians do not term the War of the Second Coalition \"Napoleonic\", since Napoleon did not initiate it himself, but merely \"inherited\" it from the Revolutionary French Directory which he overthrew during the war.\n\nBecause it only pertains to wars involving any of the Coalition parties, not all wars counted amongst the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars are considered \"Coalition Wars\". For example, the [[French invasion of Switzerland]] (1798, between the First and Second Coalition), the [[Stecklikrieg]] (1802, between the Second and Third Coalition) and the [[French invasion of Russia]] (1812, between the Fifth and Sixth Coalition) were not \"Coalition Wars\", since France fought against a single opponent.\n{{Timeline Coalition Wars}}\n\n== Coalition parties ==\nThe main European powers who forged the various anti-French Coalitions were [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], although except for Great Britain not all of them were involved in every Coalition. Smaller powers that occasionally joined the Coalitions include [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont\u2013Sardinia]], the [[Dutch Republic]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Sweden|Sweden]], [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] and various German and Italian states. The First until Fifth Coalitions fell apart when one or more parties were defeated by France and were forced to leave the alliance, and sometimes became French allies; the Sixth and Seventh were dissolved after Napoleon was defeated in 1814 and 1815 and a new balance of power was established between the parties at the [[Congress of Vienna]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%; margin:1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Members of each Coalition\n!

When the company was suddenly pinned down by a hail of extremely accurate enemy fire and was quickly separated from the remainder of the battalion by over five hundred meters of open and fire-swept ground, and casualties mounted rapidly, Lieutenant Barnum quickly made a hazardous reconnaissance of the area seeking targets for his artillery. Finding the rifle company commander mortally wounded and the radio operator killed, he, with complete disregard for his own safety, gave aid to the dying commander, then removed the radio from the dead operator and strapped it to himself.  He immediately assumed command of the rifle company, and moving at once into the midst of the heavy fire, rallying and giving encouragement to all units, reorganized them to replace the loss of key personnel and led their attack on enemy positions from which deadly fire continued to come.  His sound and swift decisions and his obvious calm served to stabilize the badly decimated units and his gallant example as he stood exposed repeatedly to point out targets served as an inspiration to all.  Provided with two armed helicopters, he moved fearlessly through enemy fire to control the air attack against the firmly entrenched enemy while skillfully directing one platoon in a successful counterattack in the key enemy positions.  Having thus cleared a small area, he requested and directed the landing of two transport helicopters for the evacuation of the dead and wounded.  He then assisted in the mopping up and final seizure of the battalion's objective.  His gallant initiative and heroic conduct reflected great credit upon himself and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and United States Naval Service.<ref name=\"USMC_MOH\"/>\n\n/S/[[Lyndon B.

Barnum Jr.'''<br/>\nUnited States Marine Corps\n</center>\nfor service as set forth in the following Citation:\n\n:For conspicuous gallantry and  intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty as Forward Observer for Artillery, while attached to Company H, [[2nd Battalion 9th Marines|Second Battalion]], [[9th Marine Regiment (United States)|Ninth Marines]], [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|Third Marine Division (Reinforced)]], in action against communist forces at [[Ky Phu]] in [[Qu\u1ea3ng T\u00edn Province|Quang Tin Province]], [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]], on 18 December 1965.  When the company was suddenly pinned down by a hail of extremely accurate enemy fire and was quickly separated from the remainder of the battalion by over five hundred meters of open and fire-swept ground, and casualties mounted rapidly, Lieutenant Barnum quickly made a hazardous reconnaissance of the area seeking targets for his artillery. Finding the rifle company commander mortally wounded and the radio operator killed, he, with complete disregard for his own safety, gave aid to the dying commander, then removed the radio from the dead operator and strapped it to himself.  He immediately assumed command of the rifle company, and moving at once into the midst of the heavy fire, rallying and giving encouragement to all units, reorganized them to replace the loss of key personnel and led their attack on enemy positions from which deadly fire continued to come.  His sound and swift decisions and his obvious calm served to stabilize the badly decimated units and his gallant example as he stood exposed repeatedly to point out targets served as an inspiration to all.  Provided with two armed helicopters, he moved fearlessly through enemy fire to control the air attack against the firmly entrenched enemy while skillfully directing one platoon in a successful counterattack in the key enemy positions.  Having thus cleared a small area, he requested and directed the landing of two transport helicopters for the evacuation of the dead and wounded.  He then assisted in the mopping up and final seizure of the battalion's objective.  His gallant initiative and heroic conduct reflected great credit upon himself and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and United States Naval Service.<ref name=\"USMC_MOH\"/>\n\n/S/[[Lyndon B.

Schama also wrote a trilogy of tie-in books for the show, which took the story up to the year 2000; there is some debate as to whether the books are the tie-in product for the TV series, or the other way around.

The Gurmukh embraces love for the Lord.\" (Guru Granth Sahib page 22) and \"Attuned to the Love of the One, there is no sorrow or suffering. ||3||\" (Guru Granth Sahib page 45), when one loves the Lord, all their sorrows and suffering are removed.\n\n== Gurbani ==\n* Sing, and listen, and let your mind be filled with love. \n* Gaavee-ai sunee-ai man rakhee-ai bhaa-o.
