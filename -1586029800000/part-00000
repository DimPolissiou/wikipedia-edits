The series premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on January 2, 2019, and is hosted by [[Nick Cannon]].\n\nThe series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|after]] [[Super Bowl LIV]] on February 2, 2020.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n==History==\n''The Masked Singer'' is based on the South Korean show ''[[King of Mask Singer]]''. Executive producer [[Craig Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a Thai restaurant. While an episode of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing on a television, he observed that the other patrons \"were all just staring at this TV watching this crazy kangaroo in like a [[Artificial leather|pleather]] outfit singing, and we didn't even finish dinner.\" Plestis and his daughter began to research the series, and he later secured the rights to produce an American adaptation, which he sold to Fox.\n\nDue to Plestis' relationship with the studio, the [[The Masked Singer (American season 1)|first season]] of ''The Masked Singer'' was produced by [[Endemol Shine North America]], then-owned partly by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s parent [[21st Century Fox]] (the stake is now owned by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]).

It was unlike the other eleven costumes as the gemstone-laden mask was sculpted out of clay and coated in gold to give it an \"armor-like aesthetic.\" The Monster, meanwhile, was designed around a 360\u00b0 foam cylinder with built-in vents made of mesh to provide oxygen to the performer. However, during filming, the large eye the celebrity saw out of frequently fogged up due to a lack of air; tiny [[Fan (machine)|fans]] were then installed inside the costume to provide circulation.<ref name=\"E!

Meanwhile, Fox was steampunk-inspired and the Penguin's mask was [[chrome plating|chromed]] in silver. Ice Cream was also innovative; the costume was formed during a complicated process of sculpting the head \"out of foam and [waxing it] onto the shoulder.\" As opposed to stereotypical black and red accents, Toybina wanted to create a sleek costume for Black Widow by experimenting with texture and movement for its design. Similarly, rather than designing the expected appearance of a Leopard, Toybina relegated animal print to the costume's mask only and instead created a vintage look with a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] dress and large collar. Toybina says she wanted to push the boundaries of costume design by creating a \"theatrical environment\" made of petals surrounding the face mask of the Flower. In order to confuse viewers, the celebrity inside the Flamingo saw out of a peephole in the neck instead of the head to hide their true height.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/> \n\nMovie and cultural influences were also present in the season; the [[hippie]]-like Eagle embodied [[Americana]] and was influenced by [[rock and roll|rock]] musicians [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]], while Skeleton was heavily inspired by the character [[Jack Skellington]] of [[Tim Burton]]'s 1993 film ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''. The Panda was imagined as a playful costume that would appeal to younger viewers of the show as the necklace was inspired by [[gumball machine|gumball machines]] and the clothing [[Japanese street fashion|Harajuku]]-like. The Egg costume, which was requested by a contestant, was described as \"somewhere between the runway and [[Lady Gaga]].\" It incorporated egg features in four different ways: the costume's mask was a [[boiled egg]], the hat was a [[fried egg]], the intricacy of the [[breastplate]] (which was hand-beaded) represented a [[Faberg\u00e9 egg]], and the [[overcoat]] resembled a cracked [[eggshell]]. Toybina inserted the beads and stones into the Butterfly costume by hand, which she says transforms the costume's darkness and sex appeal into beauty onstage.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/><ref name=\"VF Sep 24\"/> \n\nIncreasing the mobility of the celebrities inside the costumes was also a focus of the season's designs, Toybina said.<ref name=\"TW Oct 2\"/> For safety purposes, she had to reduce the extravagance of Ladybug's face mask to make it tight to the face and instead accentuated the volume of the body of the costume. Alternatively, the mask is the main feature of the street-inspired Rottweiler costume to allow the celebrity to move freely onstage. One of the last costumes that was created for the season was Thingamajig, which Toybina says resembles a grandfather and an elf with its long bead and ears. Contrary to popular belief, Toybina insists the costume was not made to resemble asparagus, rather, it was born out of pure creativity.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/><ref name=\"VF Sep 24\"/>\n\nToybina won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] in the Excellence in Variety, Reality-Competition, Live Television category in recognition of her work on the season two finale.<ref name=\"CAG 2020\">{{cite web|last=Tangcay|first=Jazz|title=''Hustlers'', ''Jojo Rabbit'' and ''Queen & Slim'' Receive Costume Design Nominations|url=https://variety.com/2019/artisans/news/costume-designers-guild-awards-nominations-2020-1203430594/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=April 3, 2020|date=December 10, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200205185900/https://variety.com/2019/artisans/news/costume-designers-guild-awards-nominations-2020-1203430594/|archive-date=February 5, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Season 3====\nThe third season featured eighteen new costumes. In addition to creating more mobility within the costumes, Toybina described the season's style focus as \"more fashion-forward and modern\" compared to the superhero and experimental feel of the first and second seasons.

series, part of the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise, featuring celebrities in head-to-toe costumes and face masks which conceal their identities from other contestants, panelists, and an audience. The series premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on January 2, 2019, and is hosted by [[Nick Cannon]].\n\nThe series is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|after]] [[Super Bowl LIV]] on February 2, 2020.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n==History==\n''The Masked Singer'' is based on the South Korean show ''[[King of Mask Singer]]''. Executive producer [[Craig Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a Thai restaurant. While an episode of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing on a television, he observed that the other patrons \"were all just staring at this TV watching this crazy kangaroo in like a [[Artificial leather|pleather]] outfit singing, and we didn't even finish dinner.\" Plestis and his daughter began to research the series, and he later secured the rights to produce an American adaptation, which he sold to Fox.\n\nDue to Plestis' relationship with the studio, the [[The Masked Singer (American season 1)|first season]] of ''The Masked Singer'' was produced by [[Endemol Shine North America]], then-owned partly by [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s parent [[21st Century Fox]] (the stake is now owned by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]). For the second season, production transitioned to a new in-house studio under the Fox network, Fox Alternative Entertainment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eonline.com/ca/news/1019279/the-secrets-of-the-masked-singer-everything-we-ve-learned-about-tv-s-most-mysterious-show|title=The Secrets of The Masked Singer: Everything We've Learned About TV's Most Mysterious Show|date=February 27, 2019|website=E!

The specific format of the competition varies by season and episode, depending on how many celebrities remain, but generally, each episode features four to six celebrities performing a cover of a famous song, and the panelists and audience vote for their favorite. The celebrity with the fewest votes in that episode is eliminated from the competition and must take off their mask and reveal their identity.<ref name=\"PeopleS3\">{{cite web |last1=Stone |first1=Natalie |title=The Masked Singer Renewed for Season 3, to Premiere After 2020 Super Bowl |url=https://people.com/tv/the-masked-singer-renewed-for-season-3/ |website=[[People (magazine)|People]] |publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]] |accessdate=May 13, 2019 |date=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the singing competition, hints to each masked singer's identity are offered during the show, referred to as the \"clue package\" by the panelists. Such clues may feature cryptic allusions to what the celebrity is known for, or may be more direct references to public but somewhat obscure knowledge of the celebrity. Pre-taped interviews are given as hints and feature celebrities' electronically masked voices.

Meanwhile, Fox was steampunk-inspired and the Penguin's mask was [[chrome plating|chromed]] in silver. Ice Cream was also innovative; the costume was formed during a complicated process of sculpting the head \"out of foam and [waxing it] onto the shoulder.\" As opposed to stereotypical black and red accents, Toybina wanted to create a sleek costume for Black Widow by experimenting with texture and movement for its design. Similarly, rather than designing the expected appearance of a Leopard, Toybina relegated animal print to the costume's mask only and instead created a vintage look with a [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] dress and large collar. Toybina says she wanted to push the boundaries of costume design by creating a \"theatrical environment\" made of petals surrounding the face mask of the Flower. In order to confuse viewers, the celebrity inside the Flamingo saw out of a peephole in the neck instead of the head to hide their true height.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/> \n\nMovie and cultural influences were also present in the season; the [[hippie]]-like Eagle embodied [[Americana]] and was influenced by [[rock and roll|rock]] musicians [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]], while Skeleton was heavily inspired by the character [[Jack Skellington]] of [[Tim Burton]]'s 1993 film ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''. The Panda was imagined as a playful costume that would appeal to younger viewers of the show as the necklace was inspired by [[gumball machine|gumball machines]] and the clothing [[Japanese street fashion|Harajuku]]-like. The Egg costume, which was requested by a contestant, was described as \"somewhere between the runway and [[Lady Gaga]].\" It incorporated egg features in four different ways: the costume's mask was a [[boiled egg]], the hat was a [[fried egg]], the intricacy of the [[breastplate]] (which was hand-beaded) represented a [[Faberg\u00e9 egg]], and the [[overcoat]] resembled a cracked [[eggshell]]. Toybina inserted the beads and stones into the Butterfly costume by hand, which she says transforms the costume's darkness and sex appeal into beauty onstage.<ref name=\"VUL Sep 25\"/><ref name=\"VF Sep 24\"/> \n\nIncreasing the mobility of the celebrities inside the costumes was also a focus of the season's designs, Toybina said.<ref name=\"TW Oct 2\"/> For safety purposes, she had to reduce the extravagance of Ladybug's face mask to make it tight to the face and instead accentuated the volume of the body of the costume. Alternatively, the mask is the main feature of the street-inspired Rottweiler costume to allow the celebrity to move freely onstage. One of the last costumes that was created for the season was Thingamajig, which Toybina says resembles a grandfather and an elf with its long bead and ears.
