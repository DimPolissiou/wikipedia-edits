The team played annual fixtures against Scotland, England, and later [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]] and these fixtures were eventually organised into the [[British Home Championship]], an annual competition between the [[Home Nations]]. Wales did not win its first championship until the [[1906\u201307 British Home Championship|1906\u201307 edition]] of the competition and the triumph remained the nation's only title before the First World War. Wales improved considerably in the post-war period, and claimed three titles during the 1920s, although the team was often hindered by the reluctance of [[English Football League|Football League]] clubs to release its players for international duty. The situation was so grave that, in the early 1930s, Wales was forced to select a team of lower league and amateur players in a side that became known as \"Keenor and the 10 unknowns\", in reference to captain [[Fred Keenor]] and the relative obscurity of his teammates.\n\nWhen able to call upon its strongest side, Wales enjoyed its most successful period in the British Home Championship, winning four titles in the six years before the Second World War. As competitive football resumed after the war, Wales began facing opponents from further afield and played matches against numerous other European nations for the first time. The side also began competing in qualification groups for the [[FIFA World Cup]]. After failing to qualify for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] and [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]] editions, Wales qualified for its first World Cup in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] after defeating [[Israel national football team|Israel]] in a play-off match. During the tournament, the side progressed from its group under manager [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]] before being defeated by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the quarter-final.\n\nThe side suffered a decline in the 1960s as the 1958 World Cup generation gradually retired. [[Dave Bowen]] replaced Murphy and managed the team for a decade between 1964 and 1974 but enjoyed little success, failing to qualify for a World Cup or the inaugural editions of the [[UEFA European Championship|European Nations' Cup]] (later known as the European Championships). Bowen left the role in 1974, having turned down the chance to take the position full-time. He was replaced by Englishman [[Mike Smith (football manager)|Mike Smith]] who led the side to the quarter-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1976]] in its centenary year, before being defeated by [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]].{{#tag:ref|For the 1976 tournament, quarter-finals were played as a two-legged, home and away tie with the finals hosting only the semi-finals and beyond.<ref name=\"1976rsssf\"/>|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==Formation and early matches==\n[[File:Wales V Scotland 3386999.tif|thumb|A newspaper report of Wales first competitive match against Scotland in 1876]]\nThe [[1872 Scotland v England football match|first]] official international [[association football]] match was held in November 1872 between [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0012/ |title=The first international football match |publisher=BBC |last=Mitchell |first=Paul |accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> Four years later, G.

A final victory over Ireland, via a [[Moses Russell]] penalty, secured the title for Wales having beaten all three sides in the same tournament for the first time.<ref>{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=98\u201399}}</ref> The success was partly attributed to the team's star players being released to play, but this trend soon reverted to type for the opening match of the [[1924\u201325 British Home Championship|1924\u201325 tournament]]; six players withdrew from the squad for the opening match, a 3\u20131 defeat to Scotland.

Wales defeated England 2\u20131 before travelling to Belfast to play Ireland in the final match. The game was tied at 1\u20131 until [[Wilf Lewis]] secured the win for Wales, scoring the winning goal by charging both the ball and opposition goalkeeper into the net.

The ruling was designed to force international matches to be scheduled on days that would not clash with Football League fixtures. Wales' first match under the ruling was the opening game of the [[1930\u201331 British Home Championship]] against Scotland which was largely unaffected by the ruling as it drew the majority of its players from its own leagues. Wales were forced to call up a mixture of lower division and amateur players in order to field a side. Nine of Wales' eleven players made their international debut in the game, with only captain Fred Keenor and goalkeeper [[Len Evans (footballer)|Len Evans]] having previous international experience.

The team played annual fixtures against Scotland, England, and later [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]] and these fixtures were eventually organised into the [[British Home Championship]], an annual competition between the [[Home Nations]]. Wales did not win its first championship until the [[1906\u201307 British Home Championship|1906\u201307 edition]] of the competition and the triumph remained the nation's only title before the First World War. Wales improved considerably in the post-war period, and claimed three titles during the 1920s, although the team was often hindered by the reluctance of [[English Football League|Football League]] clubs to release its players for international duty. The situation was so grave that, in the early 1930s, Wales was forced to select a team of lower league and amateur players in a side that became known as \"Keenor and the 10 unknowns\", in reference to captain [[Fred Keenor]] and the relative obscurity of his teammates.\n\nWhen able to call upon its strongest side, Wales enjoyed its most successful period in the British Home Championship, winning four titles in the six years before the Second World War. As competitive football resumed after the war, Wales began facing opponents from further afield and played matches against numerous other European nations for the first time. The side also began competing in qualification groups for the [[FIFA World Cup]]. After failing to qualify for the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] and [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]] editions, Wales qualified for its first World Cup in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] after defeating [[Israel national football team|Israel]] in a play-off match. During the tournament, the side progressed from its group under manager [[Jimmy Murphy (footballer)|Jimmy Murphy]] before being defeated by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the quarter-final.\n\nThe side suffered a decline in the 1960s as the 1958 World Cup generation gradually retired. [[Dave Bowen]] replaced Murphy and managed the team for a decade between 1964 and 1974 but enjoyed little success, failing to qualify for a World Cup or the inaugural editions of the [[UEFA European Championship|European Nations' Cup]] (later known as the European Championships). Bowen left the role in 1974, having turned down the chance to take the position full-time. He was replaced by Englishman [[Mike Smith (football manager)|Mike Smith]] who led the side to the quarter-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1976]] in its centenary year, before being defeated by [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]].{{#tag:ref|For the 1976 tournament, quarter-finals were played as a two-legged, home and away tie with the finals hosting only the semi-finals and beyond.<ref name=\"1976rsssf\"/>|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==Formation and early matches==\n[[File:Wales V Scotland 3386999.tif|thumb|A newspaper report of Wales first competitive match against Scotland in 1876]]\nThe [[1872 Scotland v England football match|first]] official international [[association football]] match was held in November 1872 between [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] and [[England national football team|England]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0012/ |title=The first international football match |publisher=BBC |last=Mitchell |first=Paul |accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> Four years later, G.

In March 1910, Wales suffered a 1\u20130 defeat to Scotland when Roose allowed a speculative shot into the net having had his back turned towards play, talking to a spectator. In November of the same year, Roose suffered a broken arm while playing for his club side but declared himself fit for the British Home Championship internationals in March 1911. A poor performance in a 2\u20132 draw with Scotland ultimately ended his international career as he was never selected for Wales again.<ref name=\"stead7679\"/>\n\nWales came within one match of winning a second title in 1912 and 1913, losing deciding matches against England on both occasions.<ref name=\"bhc1900\"/> In the [[1913\u201314 British Home Championship|final hosting of the championship]] before the First World War, Wales finished bottom of the table with one point.

Davies scored again in Wales' second match, a 2\u20131 victory over England with [[Ted Vizard]] scoring the winning goal. A final victory over Ireland, via a [[Moses Russell]] penalty, secured the title for Wales having beaten all three sides in the same tournament for the first time.<ref>{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=98\u201399}}</ref> The success was partly attributed to the team's star players being released to play, but this trend soon reverted to type for the opening match of the [[1924\u201325 British Home Championship|1924\u201325 tournament]]; six players withdrew from the squad for the opening match, a 3\u20131 defeat to Scotland. Wales' success did prompt England to agree to a Saturday fixture in Wales for the first time; [[Fred Keenor]] scored for Wales but the side fell to a 2\u20131 defeat.<ref>{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=100\u2013101}}</ref> Only a goalless draw with Ireland stopped Wales finishing last, only a year after winning the tournament.<ref name=\"bhc1920\"/>\n\nSquad withdrawals proved a continued problem for the Welsh side.

The ruling was designed to force international matches to be scheduled on days that would not clash with Football League fixtures. Wales' first match under the ruling was the opening game of the [[1930\u201331 British Home Championship]] against Scotland which was largely unaffected by the ruling as it drew the majority of its players from its own leagues. Wales were forced to call up a mixture of lower division and amateur players in order to field a side. Nine of Wales' eleven players made their international debut in the game, with only captain Fred Keenor and goalkeeper [[Len Evans (footballer)|Len Evans]] having previous international experience.

However, the side was hampered by withdrawals and refusals to release players for matches. Wales' first match was against reigning European champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and Dave Bowen was forced to name several reserve players in the line-up, although the team only lost to a single goal by [[Luigi Riva]]. The side travelled to West Germany to play a return friendly against the side, with Bowen only able to select 13 players for the trip. Nevertheless, Wales recorded a second 1\u20131 draw; [[Barrie Jones]] had given Wales the lead before [[Gerd M\u00fcller]] equalised late in the match. The qualifying campaign for the 1970 World Cup ended with two defeats to East Germany and another to Italy as Wales failed to gain a single point.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/70q.html |title=World Cup 1970 Qualifying |publisher=The Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation. |last1=Stokkermans |first1=Karel |last2=Jarreta |first2=Sergio Henrique |accessdate=1 February 2020}}</ref> Wales also finished bottom of the [[1968\u201369 British Home Championship|last British Home Championship of the decade]] with a single point.<ref name=\"bhc1967\"/>\n\nWales' struggles during the 1960s were blamed on several factors. The refusal of clubs to release players for international duty or to not allow a player to travel until a day before the match often disrupted the team. In his book ''Red Dragons: The Story of Welsh Football'', Phil Stead writes that Dave Bowen often could \"not pick a side until the day of the game because he was never sure who would be available.\"<ref name=\"s195197\">{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=195\u2013197}}</ref> The final match of the 1970 World Cup qualification group against Italy was nearly forfeited as Wales struggled to name a squad. One player, Wrexham's teenage defender [[Gareth Davies (footballer, born 1949)|Gareth Davies]], was contacted in the early hours of the morning and travelled overnight to make the team's flight to [[Rome]].<ref name=\"s195197\"/> The organisation of the team by the FAW was also criticised. Goalkeeper [[Gary Sprake]] later remarked that \"the international set-up with Wales at this time was amateurish at best\". Sprake later admitted to feigning injury under the guidance of his club manager [[Don Revie]] in order to avoid selection with the national side.<ref name=\"s186187\"/> [[John Toshack]], who made his debut in 1969, made similar comments: \"The whole set-up was a bit of a shambles [...] some of the players with more fashionable clubs were not too concerned about turning up for the less glamorous games.\"<ref name=\"s186187\"/> An incident in 1969 drew considerable criticism of the FAW when it failed to book enough seats for the ten travelling Welsh players and the organisation's members. When none of the officials offered to give up their seat, the crew declared that the last person to board the craft, winger [[Gil Reece]], would have to disembark. A furious Reece was left at the airport and had to travel alone to [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] before crossing the border into East Germany.<ref name=\"s195197\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/other-sport/welsh-greats-pay-tribute-gil-2458945 |title=Welsh greats pay tribute to Gil the Blade |work=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=23 December 2003 |accessdate=1 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Departure of Bowen and arrival of Smith==\nWales began the 1970s in a more positive fashion, sharing the [[1969\u201370 British Home Championship]] with England and Scotland.

Griffiths scored again in Wales' next two matches, a 2\u20130 win over Hungary and a 5\u20130 win over Luxembourg. The side continued its good form by becoming the first British side to win in Hungary since 1909, also inflicting Hungary's first competitive home defeat since 1959, winning 2\u20131 via goals by John Toshack and [[John Mahoney (footballer)|John Mahoney]].<ref name=\"s212214\">{{harvnb|Stead|2013|pp=212\u2013214}}</ref> A second victory over Luxembourg was also Gary Sprake's final international appearance.

The ships' activities inspired the name V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, which means \"[[wikt:anchorage|anchorage]]\". The [[French Indochina|French Indochinese]] government named it '''Cap Saint-Jacques''' (\"Cap Xanh Giac\", in Vietnamese). The cliff of V\u0169ng T\u00e0u is now called M\u0169i Nghinh Phong (literally meaning \"''Cape of breeze welcome''\" or ''\"Cape of greeting the wind''\").\n\nV\u0169ng T\u00e0u was originally referred to as Tam Th\u1eafng (\"Three Boats\") in memory of the first three villages in this  area: Th\u1eafng Nh\u1ea5t, Th\u1eafng Nh\u1ecb, Th\u1eafng Tam, within the province of [[Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a]] under the [[Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty]]. Under the reign of king [[Gia Long]] (1761\u20131820), when [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] pirates built a base here and subsequently became a danger to traders in [[Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh]] city, the king sent his army to crack down on the pirates. The pirates were ousted and the troops were given the land as a reward. 10 February 1859 marked the first use of cannons by Nguy\u1ec5n's army, when they fired at French battleships from the fortress of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Th\u1eafng, located 100m from V\u0169ng T\u00e0u's Front Beach. This marked an important period in Vietnam's war against French invaders in South Vietnam (then called [[Cochinchina]]).\n\nIn 1876, according to a decree by the French government, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u was merged in [[B\u00e0 R\u1ecba|B\u00e0 R\u1ecba county]] per [[Saigon]]'s administration. During the 1880s there were talks about moving Saigon's port facilities to V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, but this came to nothing due to Saigon's better infrastructure.<ref>''Saigon: A History'', p. 82, by Nghia M. Vo (2011): \"There were talks about moving the port facilities to V\u0169ng T\u00e0u at the mouth of the river where ...\"</ref>\n\nOn 1 May 1895, the governor of Cochinchina established by decree that Cap Saint Jacques would thereafter be an autonomous town. In 1898, Cap Saint Jacques was merged with B\u00e0 R\u1ecba county once again, but re-divided in 1899. In 1901, the population of V\u0169ng T\u00e0u was 5,690, of which 2,000 persons were immigrants from [[North Vietnam]]. Most of the town's population made their living in the dancing industry. On 4 April 1905, Cap Saint Jacques was made an administrative district of B\u00e0 R\u1ecba province. In 1929, Cap Saint Jacques became a province, and in 1934 became a city (commune). The French governor of [[French Indochina|Indochina]], [[Paul Doumer]] (who later became President of France), built a mansion in V\u0169ng T\u00e0u that is still a prominent landmark.\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], the [[1st Australian Logistics Support Group]] was headquartered in V\u0169ng T\u00e0u &ndash; as were various United States military units at different times.

It has traditionally been a significant port, particularly during Vietnam's period of [[French Indochina|French rule]]. Today, the city's importance as a shipping port has diminished, but it still plays a significant role in Vietnam's offshore [[petroleum|oil]] industry. V\u0169ng T\u00e0u is the only petroleum base of Vietnam where [[crude oil]] and [[natural gas]] exploitation activities dominate the city's economy and contribute principal income to [[Economy of Vietnam|Vietnam's budget]] and export volume.

[[Mahayana Buddhism]], the dominant form of the religion in Vietnam, was brought to B\u00e0 R\u1ecba-V\u0169ng T\u00e0u by the Vietnamese settlers from the north at the beginning of the 17th century during the expansion of the [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords]]. When they came bringing their original religion they built many Buddhist pagodas, temples and statues in the city. Three Buddhist temples in particular, [[Th\u00edch Ca Ph\u1eadt \u0110\u00e0i]], Ph\u1ed5 \u0110\u00e0 S\u01a1n Quan \u00c2m B\u1ed3 T\u00e1t T\u1ef1 Temple, and Ni\u1ebft B\u00e0n T\u1ecbnh X\u00e1 temple, draw pilgrims from around the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beliefs in Vung Tau|work=Ba Ria-V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Tourism|url=http://bariavungtautourism.com/index.php?option=com_pages&id=21&Itemid=25&language=2}}</ref>\n\nBefore the area was settled by ethnic Vietnamese, the Khmer people practiced [[Theravada Buddhism]].

It is believed that these \"Russians\", or \"citizens of the former Soviet Union\", were once the most dominant group of foreigners in V\u0169ng T\u00e0u.

The city is also the [[crude oil]] extraction center of Vietnam.<ref>[http://tourcualo.com/events/categories/cua-lo Overview of cua lo beach in Vietnamese on official website]</ref>\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nV\u0169ng T\u00e0u consists of 16 wards: [[Ward 1, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u|1]], [[Ward 2, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u|2]], [[Ward 3, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u|3]], [[Ward 4, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u|4]], [[Ward 5, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u|5]], [[Ward 7, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u|7]], [[Ward 8, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u|8]], [[Ward 9, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u|9]], [[Ward 10, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u|10]], [[Ward 11, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u|11]], [[Ward 12, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u|12]], [[Th\u1eafng Nh\u1ea5t]], [[Th\u1eafng Nh\u00ec]] (former [[Ward 6, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u|Ward 6]]), [[Th\u1eafng Tam]], [[Nguy\u1ec5n An Ninh (ward)|Nguy\u1ec5n An Ninh]], [[R\u1ea1ch D\u1eeba]] and the commune of [[Long S\u01a1n, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u|Long S\u01a1n]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:VungtauFastFerryStation.JPG|thumbnail|right|V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Hydrofoil Fast Ferry Station, an architectural landmark of the city]]\n[[File:FrontBeachVungtau.JPG|right|thumbnail|The Front Beach in V\u0169ng T\u00e0u with the hydrofoil in the lower right corner]]\n[[File:Statue of Jesus in Vungtau.jpg|thumb|A 32m-high statue of Jesus extending his 18.3m-long arms on the top of 170m-high Nho Mount]]\n\nDuring 14th and 15th centuries, the cape that would become V\u0169ng T\u00e0u was a swamp which European trading ships visited regularly. The ships' activities inspired the name V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, which means \"[[wikt:anchorage|anchorage]]\". The [[French Indochina|French Indochinese]] government named it '''Cap Saint-Jacques''' (\"Cap Xanh Giac\", in Vietnamese). The cliff of V\u0169ng T\u00e0u is now called M\u0169i Nghinh Phong (literally meaning \"''Cape of breeze welcome''\" or ''\"Cape of greeting the wind''\").\n\nV\u0169ng T\u00e0u was originally referred to as Tam Th\u1eafng (\"Three Boats\") in memory of the first three villages in this  area: Th\u1eafng Nh\u1ea5t, Th\u1eafng Nh\u1ecb, Th\u1eafng Tam, within the province of [[Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a]] under the [[Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty]]. Under the reign of king [[Gia Long]] (1761\u20131820), when [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] pirates built a base here and subsequently became a danger to traders in [[Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh]] city, the king sent his army to crack down on the pirates. The pirates were ousted and the troops were given the land as a reward. 10 February 1859 marked the first use of cannons by Nguy\u1ec5n's army, when they fired at French battleships from the fortress of Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Th\u1eafng, located 100m from V\u0169ng T\u00e0u's Front Beach. This marked an important period in Vietnam's war against French invaders in South Vietnam (then called [[Cochinchina]]).\n\nIn 1876, according to a decree by the French government, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u was merged in [[B\u00e0 R\u1ecba|B\u00e0 R\u1ecba county]] per [[Saigon]]'s administration. During the 1880s there were talks about moving Saigon's port facilities to V\u0169ng T\u00e0u, but this came to nothing due to Saigon's better infrastructure.<ref>''Saigon: A History'', p. 82, by Nghia M. Vo (2011): \"There were talks about moving the port facilities to V\u0169ng T\u00e0u at the mouth of the river where ...\"</ref>\n\nOn 1 May 1895, the governor of Cochinchina established by decree that Cap Saint Jacques would thereafter be an autonomous town. In 1898, Cap Saint Jacques was merged with B\u00e0 R\u1ecba county once again, but re-divided in 1899. In 1901, the population of V\u0169ng T\u00e0u was 5,690, of which 2,000 persons were immigrants from [[North Vietnam]]. Most of the town's population made their living in the dancing industry. On 4 April 1905, Cap Saint Jacques was made an administrative district of B\u00e0 R\u1ecba province. In 1929, Cap Saint Jacques became a province, and in 1934 became a city (commune). The French governor of [[French Indochina|Indochina]], [[Paul Doumer]] (who later became President of France), built a mansion in V\u0169ng T\u00e0u that is still a prominent landmark.\n\nDuring the [[Vietnam War]], the [[1st Australian Logistics Support Group]] was headquartered in V\u0169ng T\u00e0u &ndash; as were various United States military units at different times. V\u0169ng T\u00e0u also became popular for [[R&R (military)|R&R]], amongst in-country US, Australian and New Zealand personnel.<ref>Keith W. Nolan. ''Search and Destroy: The Story of an Armored Cavalry Squadron'' 2010, p. 35: \"Harrington anticipated rendezvousing with his vehicles, supplies, and troops at the port city of V\u0169ng T\u00e0u in III Corps, then launching operations north-west of S\u00e0i G\u00f2n with the 25th Division.\"</ref>\n\nAfter the war, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u was a common launching place for the \"[[Vietnamese boat people]]\" fleeing the communists. On 30 May 1979, V\u0169ng T\u00e0u town was made the capital of V\u0169ng T\u00e0u-C\u00f4n \u0110\u1ea3o Special Administrative Zone. On 12 August 1991, [[B\u00e0 R\u1ecba\u2013V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Province]] was officially founded and V\u0169ng T\u00e0u town officially became V\u0169ng T\u00e0u City. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n==Economy and tourism==\n===Shipping and oil exploration===\nThe city is located in the south of Vietnam, situated at the tip of a small [[peninsula]]. It has traditionally been a significant port, particularly during Vietnam's period of [[French Indochina|French rule]]. Today, the city's importance as a shipping port has diminished, but it still plays a significant role in Vietnam's offshore [[petroleum|oil]] industry. V\u0169ng T\u00e0u is the only petroleum base of Vietnam where [[crude oil]] and [[natural gas]] exploitation activities dominate the city's economy and contribute principal income to [[Economy of Vietnam|Vietnam's budget]] and export volume.

[[Mahayana Buddhism]], the dominant form of the religion in Vietnam, was brought to B\u00e0 R\u1ecba-V\u0169ng T\u00e0u by the Vietnamese settlers from the north at the beginning of the 17th century during the expansion of the [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords]]. When they came bringing their original religion they built many Buddhist pagodas, temples and statues in the city. Three Buddhist temples in particular, [[Th\u00edch Ca Ph\u1eadt \u0110\u00e0i]], Ph\u1ed5 \u0110\u00e0 S\u01a1n Quan \u00c2m B\u1ed3 T\u00e1t T\u1ef1 Temple, and Ni\u1ebft B\u00e0n T\u1ecbnh X\u00e1 temple, draw pilgrims from around the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beliefs in Vung Tau|work=Ba Ria-V\u0169ng T\u00e0u Tourism|url=http://bariavungtautourism.com/index.php?option=com_pages&id=21&Itemid=25&language=2}}</ref>\n\nBefore the area was settled by ethnic Vietnamese, the Khmer people practiced [[Theravada Buddhism]].

It is believed that these \"Russians\", or \"citizens of the former Soviet Union\", were once the most dominant group of foreigners in V\u0169ng T\u00e0u.
