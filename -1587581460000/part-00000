Brookline borders six of [[Boston]]'s neighborhoods: [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], [[Allston]], [[Fenway\u2013Kenmore]], [[Mission Hill, Boston|Mission Hill]], [[Jamaica Plain]], and [[West Roxbury]]. The city of [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]] lies to the west of Brookline.\n\nAt the 2010 census, the population of the town was 58,732. It is the most populous municipality in Massachusetts to have a [[New England town|town]] (rather than city) form of government.\n\nBrookline was first settled in 1638 as a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in Boston; it was incorporated as a separate town in 1705.\n\nBrookline was the birthplace and hometown of [[John F. Kennedy]], 35th [[President of the United States]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Dorchester 1858.jpg|thumb|right|1858 map of north-central Norfolk County, showing Brookline (upper left) along with Dorchester, Roxbury and West Roxbury, all three of which were later annexed by Boston]]\n\nOnce part of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] territory, Brookline was first settled by [[White people|European]] colonists in the early 17th century. The area was an outlying part of the colonial settlement of Boston and known as the hamlet of Muddy River. In 1705, it was incorporated as the independent town of Brookline. The northern and southern borders of the town were marked by two small rivers or brooks, hence the name. The northern border with Brighton (which was itself part of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] until 1807) was Smelt Brook. (That name appears on maps starting at least as early as 1852, but sometime between 1888 and 1925 the brook was covered over.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/rzeledon/www/city/NaturalProcesses.html Packard's Corner: Once and Future City] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725072914/http://web.mit.edu/rzeledon/www/city/NaturalProcesses.html |date=July 25, 2009 }}</ref>) The southern boundary, abutting Boston, was the [[Muddy River (Massachusetts)|Muddy River]].\n\nThe Town of [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]] was merged with Boston in 1874, and the Boston-Brookline border was redrawn to connect the new Back Bay neighborhood with Allston-Brighton. This merger created a narrow strip of land along the [[Charles River]] belonging to Boston, cutting Brookline off from the shoreline. It also put certain lands north of the Muddy River on the Boston side, including what are now [[Kenmore Square]] and [[Packard's Corner]]. The current northern border follows Commonwealth Avenue, and on the northeast, St. Mary's Street. When [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] designed the [[Emerald Necklace]] of parks and parkways for Boston in the 1890s, the Muddy River was integrated into the [[Riverway]] and [[Olmsted Park]], creating parkland accessible by both Boston and Brookline residents.\n\nThroughout its history, Brookline has resisted being annexed by Boston, in particular during the [[Boston\u2013Brookline annexation debate of 1873]]. The neighboring towns of [[West Roxbury]] and [[Hyde Park, Boston|Hyde Park]] connected Brookline to the rest of Norfolk County until they were annexed by Boston in 1874 and 1912, respectively, putting them in [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]. Brookline is now separated from the remainder of Norfolk County.\n\nBrookline has long been regarded as a pleasant and verdant environment. In the 1841 edition of the ''Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening'', Andrew Jackson Downing described the area this way:\n{{quote|The whole of this neighborhood of Brookline is a kind of landscape garden, and there is nothing in America of the sort, so inexpressibly charming as the lanes which lead from one cottage, or villa, to another. No animals are allowed to run at large, and the open gates, with tempting vistas and glimpses under the pendent boughs, give it quite an Arcadian air of rural freedom and enjoyment. These lanes are clothed with a profusion of trees and wild shrubbery, often almost to the carriage tracks, and curve and wind about, in a manner quite bewildering to the stranger who attempts to thread them alone; and there are more hints here for the lover of the picturesque in lanes than we ever saw assembled together in so small a compass.<ref>[http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/bonsai/beginnings.html Arnold Arboretum Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202082944/http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/bonsai/beginnings.html |date=February 2, 2007 }}</ref>}}\n\nBrookline residents were among the first in the country to propose extending the vote to women. [[Benjamin F. Butler]], in his 1882 campaign for Governor, advocated the idea.<ref>John Gould Curtis, History of the Town of Brookline Massachusetts, Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston and New York, 1933, pg.305</ref>\n\n===Transportation history===\nTwo branches of upper [[Boston Post Road]], established in the 1670s, passed through Brookline. Brookline Village was the original center of retail activity.<ref>[http://www.town.brookline.ma.us/Planning/brooklinevillage.html Brookline Village] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008104829/http://www.town.brookline.ma.us/Planning/brooklinevillage.html |date=October 8, 2007 }}</ref> In 1810, the Boston and Worcester Turnpike, now [[Massachusetts Route 9]], was laid out, starting on [[Huntington Avenue]] in Boston and passing through the village center on its way west.\n\nSteam railroads came to Brookline in the middle of the 19th century. The [[Boston and Worcester Railroad]] was constructed in the early 1830s, and passed through Brookline near the Charles River. The rail line is still in active use, now paralleled by the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]. The Highland Branch of the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] was built from Kenmore Square to Brookline Village in 1847, and was extended into Newton in 1852. In the late 1950s, this would become the [[Green Line \"D\" Branch]].\n\nThe portion of Beacon Street west of Kenmore Square was laid out in 1850.  [[Streetcar]] tracks were laid above ground on Beacon Street in 1888, from [[Coolidge Corner]] to [[Massachusetts Avenue (metropolitan Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] in Boston, via Kenmore Square.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooklinehistoricalsociety.org/history/presComm/beaconSt.asp|title=History of Beacon St.|website=www.brooklinehistoricalsociety.org|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}  In 1889, they were electrified and extended over the Brighton border at [[Cleveland Circle]]. They would eventually become the [[Green Line \"C\" Branch]].\n\nThanks to the [[Boston Elevated Railway]] system, this upgrade from [[horse-drawn carriage]] to electric trolleys occurred on many major streets all over the region, and made transportation into downtown Boston faster and cheaper. Much of Brookline was developed into a [[streetcar suburb]], with large brick apartment buildings sprouting up along the new streetcar lines.\n\n===Etymology===\nBrookline was known as the hamlet of '''Muddy River''' and was considered part of Boston until the Town of Brookline was independently incorporated in 1705.  (The [[Muddy River (Massachusetts)|Muddy River]] was used as the Brookline\u2013Boston border at incorporation.) It is said that the name derives from a farm therein once owned by Judge [[Samuel Sewall]].<ref>{{cite book\n| author = Dudley, Dean (1871)\n| title =Brookline, Jamaica Plain and West Roxbury Directory for 1871; Containing a General Directory of the Residents, Town Registers, Business Directory, Map, &c., &c.\n| year = 1871\n| publisher=Dean Dudley & Co.\n| location =  Boston\n| isbn =\n| pages = 15\u201316\n| quote = The name of Brookline came, as the late Rev. Samuel Sewall (great grandson of Judge Samuel Sewall) conjectures, from one of the farms within its bounds, namely the Gates' farm, hired of Judge Sewall, which was probably called Brookline because Smelt-brook, running through it, formed the line between that and one of the neighboring farms, and this brook also separated that farm from Cambridge.  Judge Sewall, in his journal, often mentions the name \"Brookline\" before the town was incorporated.  Rev. Mr. S. also thinks it was Judge Sewall that suggested that name for the town.}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Brookline has a total area of {{convert|17.7|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, all but {{convert|0.1|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} (0.44%) of which is land.\n\nThe northern part of Brookline, roughly north of the D-line tracks, is urban in character, as highly walkable and transit rich. The population density of this part of town is nearly {{convert|20,000|PD/sqmi|-3}}, on a par with the densest neighborhoods in nearby [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]], Massachusetts (the densest cities in New England), and just below that of central Boston's residential districts (Back Bay, South End, Fenway, etc.).  The overall density of Brookline, which also includes suburban districts and grand estates south of the D-line, is still higher than that of many of the largest cities in the United States, especially in the South and West.  Brookline borders [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]] (part of [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]]) to the west and [[Boston]] (part of [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]) in all other directions; it is therefore non-contiguous with any other part of Norfolk County.

Brookline borders six of [[Boston]]'s neighborhoods: [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]], [[Allston]], [[Fenway\u2013Kenmore]], [[Mission Hill, Boston|Mission Hill]], [[Jamaica Plain]], and [[West Roxbury]]. The city of [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]] lies to the west of Brookline.\n\nAt the 2010 census, the population of the town was 58,732. It is the most populous municipality in Massachusetts to have a [[New England town|town]] (rather than city) form of government.\n\nBrookline was first settled in 1638 as a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in Boston; it was incorporated as a separate town in 1705.\n\nBrookline was the birthplace and hometown of [[John F. Kennedy]], 35th [[President of the United States]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Dorchester 1858.jpg|thumb|right|1858 map of north-central Norfolk County, showing Brookline (upper left) along with Dorchester, Roxbury and West Roxbury, all three of which were later annexed by Boston]]\n\nOnce part of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] territory, Brookline was first settled by [[White people|European]] colonists in the early 17th century. The area was an outlying part of the colonial settlement of Boston and known as the hamlet of Muddy River. In 1705, it was incorporated as the independent town of Brookline. The northern and southern borders of the town were marked by two small rivers or brooks, hence the name. The northern border with Brighton (which was itself part of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] until 1807) was Smelt Brook. (That name appears on maps starting at least as early as 1852, but sometime between 1888 and 1925 the brook was covered over.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/rzeledon/www/city/NaturalProcesses.html Packard's Corner: Once and Future City] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725072914/http://web.mit.edu/rzeledon/www/city/NaturalProcesses.html |date=July 25, 2009 }}</ref>) The southern boundary, abutting Boston, was the [[Muddy River (Massachusetts)|Muddy River]].\n\nThe Town of [[Brighton, Boston|Brighton]] was merged with Boston in 1874, and the Boston-Brookline border was redrawn to connect the new Back Bay neighborhood with Allston-Brighton. This merger created a narrow strip of land along the [[Charles River]] belonging to Boston, cutting Brookline off from the shoreline. It also put certain lands north of the Muddy River on the Boston side, including what are now [[Kenmore Square]] and [[Packard's Corner]]. The current northern border follows Commonwealth Avenue, and on the northeast, St. Mary's Street. When [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] designed the [[Emerald Necklace]] of parks and parkways for Boston in the 1890s, the Muddy River was integrated into the [[Riverway]] and [[Olmsted Park]], creating parkland accessible by both Boston and Brookline residents.\n\nThroughout its history, Brookline has resisted being annexed by Boston, in particular during the [[Boston\u2013Brookline annexation debate of 1873]]. The neighboring towns of [[West Roxbury]] and [[Hyde Park, Boston|Hyde Park]] connected Brookline to the rest of Norfolk County until they were annexed by Boston in 1874 and 1912, respectively, putting them in [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]. Brookline is now separated from the remainder of Norfolk County.\n\nBrookline has long been regarded as a pleasant and verdant environment. In the 1841 edition of the ''Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening'', Andrew Jackson Downing described the area this way:\n{{quote|The whole of this neighborhood of Brookline is a kind of landscape garden, and there is nothing in America of the sort, so inexpressibly charming as the lanes which lead from one cottage, or villa, to another. No animals are allowed to run at large, and the open gates, with tempting vistas and glimpses under the pendent boughs, give it quite an Arcadian air of rural freedom and enjoyment. These lanes are clothed with a profusion of trees and wild shrubbery, often almost to the carriage tracks, and curve and wind about, in a manner quite bewildering to the stranger who attempts to thread them alone; and there are more hints here for the lover of the picturesque in lanes than we ever saw assembled together in so small a compass.<ref>[http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/bonsai/beginnings.html Arnold Arboretum Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202082944/http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/bonsai/beginnings.html |date=February 2, 2007 }}</ref>}}\n\nBrookline residents were among the first in the country to propose extending the vote to women. [[Benjamin F. Butler]], in his 1882 campaign for Governor, advocated the idea.<ref>John Gould Curtis, History of the Town of Brookline Massachusetts, Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston and New York, 1933, pg.305</ref>\n\n===Transportation history===\nTwo branches of upper [[Boston Post Road]], established in the 1670s, passed through Brookline. Brookline Village was the original center of retail activity.<ref>[http://www.town.brookline.ma.us/Planning/brooklinevillage.html Brookline Village] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008104829/http://www.town.brookline.ma.us/Planning/brooklinevillage.html |date=October 8, 2007 }}</ref> In 1810, the Boston and Worcester Turnpike, now [[Massachusetts Route 9]], was laid out, starting on [[Huntington Avenue]] in Boston and passing through the village center on its way west.\n\nSteam railroads came to Brookline in the middle of the 19th century. The [[Boston and Worcester Railroad]] was constructed in the early 1830s, and passed through Brookline near the Charles River. The rail line is still in active use, now paralleled by the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]. The Highland Branch of the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]] was built from Kenmore Square to Brookline Village in 1847, and was extended into Newton in 1852. In the late 1950s, this would become the [[Green Line \"D\" Branch]].\n\nThe portion of Beacon Street west of Kenmore Square was laid out in 1850.  [[Streetcar]] tracks were laid above ground on Beacon Street in 1888, from [[Coolidge Corner]] to [[Massachusetts Avenue (metropolitan Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]] in Boston, via Kenmore Square.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooklinehistoricalsociety.org/history/presComm/beaconSt.asp|title=History of Beacon St.|website=www.brooklinehistoricalsociety.org|access-date=2019-10-24}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}  In 1889, they were electrified and extended over the Brighton border at [[Cleveland Circle]]. They would eventually become the [[Green Line \"C\" Branch]].\n\nThanks to the [[Boston Elevated Railway]] system, this upgrade from [[horse-drawn carriage]] to electric trolleys occurred on many major streets all over the region, and made transportation into downtown Boston faster and cheaper. Much of Brookline was developed into a [[streetcar suburb]], with large brick apartment buildings sprouting up along the new streetcar lines.\n\n===Etymology===\nBrookline was known as the hamlet of '''Muddy River''' and was considered part of Boston until the Town of Brookline was independently incorporated in 1705.  (The [[Muddy River (Massachusetts)|Muddy River]] was used as the Brookline\u2013Boston border at incorporation.) It is said that the name derives from a farm therein once owned by Judge [[Samuel Sewall]].<ref>{{cite book\n| author = Dudley, Dean (1871)\n| title =Brookline, Jamaica Plain and West Roxbury Directory for 1871; Containing a General Directory of the Residents, Town Registers, Business Directory, Map, &c., &c.\n| year = 1871\n| publisher=Dean Dudley & Co.\n| location =  Boston\n| isbn =\n| pages = 15\u201316\n| quote = The name of Brookline came, as the late Rev. Samuel Sewall (great grandson of Judge Samuel Sewall) conjectures, from one of the farms within its bounds, namely the Gates' farm, hired of Judge Sewall, which was probably called Brookline because Smelt-brook, running through it, formed the line between that and one of the neighboring farms, and this brook also separated that farm from Cambridge.  Judge Sewall, in his journal, often mentions the name \"Brookline\" before the town was incorporated.  Rev. Mr. S. also thinks it was Judge Sewall that suggested that name for the town.}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Brookline has a total area of {{convert|17.7|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}}, all but {{convert|0.1|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} (0.44%) of which is land.\n\nThe northern part of Brookline, roughly north of the D-line tracks, is urban in character, as highly walkable and transit rich. The population density of this part of town is nearly {{convert|20,000|PD/sqmi|-3}}, on a par with the densest neighborhoods in nearby [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]], Massachusetts (the densest cities in New England), and just below that of central Boston's residential districts (Back Bay, South End, Fenway, etc.).  The overall density of Brookline, which also includes suburban districts and grand estates south of the D-line, is still higher than that of many of the largest cities in the United States, especially in the South and West.  Brookline borders [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]] (part of [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]]) to the west and [[Boston]] (part of [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]) in all other directions; it is therefore non-contiguous with any other part of Norfolk County.  Brookline became an [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] in 1873, when the neighboring town of [[West Roxbury]] was annexed by Boston (and left Norfolk County to join [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts|Suffolk County]]), and Brookline refused to be annexed by Boston after the [[Boston\u2013Brookline annexation debate of 1873]].\n\nBrookline separates the bulk of the city of Boston (except for a narrow neck or corridor near the [[Charles River]]) from its westernmost neighborhoods of [[Allston\u2013Brighton]], which had been the separate town of Brighton until annexed by Boston in 1873.\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n{{Expand list|date=August 2008}}\n\nThere are many neighborhood associations, some of which overlap.<ref>{{cite web |title=Map - Brookline Neighborhood Alliance |url=http://www.town.brookline.ma.us/gis/maplib/neighborhoodmaps/neighborhoods-all.pdf |accessdate=July 24, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811155332/http://www.town.brookline.ma.us/gis/maplib/neighborhoodmaps/neighborhoods-all.pdf |archivedate=August 11, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brooklinema.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=632:neighborhood-associations&catid=259:neighborhood-associations |title=Brookline Town website: Neighborhood Associations |publisher=Brooklinema.gov |accessdate=2011-12-31 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220001407/http://www.brooklinema.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=632%3Aneighborhood-associations&catid=259%3Aneighborhood-associations |archivedate=February 20, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nNeighborhoods, squares, and notable areas of Brookline include:\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* Aspinwall Hill\n* Beaconsfield\n* Brookline Hills\n* [[Brookline Village]]\n* Buttonwood Village\n* [[Brookline High School]], Near Pierce District\n* [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts|Chestnut Hill]], which also extends into [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]] and Boston\n* [[Coolidge Corner]]\n* Corey Farm\n* Corey Hill\n* [[Cottage Farm Historic District|Cottage Farm]]\n* Fisher Hill\n* JFK Crossing\n* North Brookline\n* [[Pill Hill, Brookline, Massachusetts|Pill Hill]] (also known as \"High Street Hill\")\n* The Point (originally \"Whiskey Point\")\n* The Runkle District\n* South Brookline (\"Sobro\")\n* The Heights (just west of Washington Square)\n* [[Washington Square (Brookline)|Washington Square]]\n{{Refend}}\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate of Brookline is [[Humid continental]] [[Humid continental climate|Dfa]].\n{{Weather box\n|location = Brookline, MA\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F = 72.0\n|Feb record high F = 70.0\n|Mar record high F = 89.0\n|Apr record high F = 94.0\n|May record high F = 97.0\n|Jun record high F = 100.0\n|Jul record high F = 104.0\n|Aug record high F = 102.0\n|Sep record high F = 102.0\n|Oct record high F = 90.0\n|Nov record high F = 83.0\n|Dec record high F = 76.0\n|Jan high F = 36.0\n|Feb high F = 39.0\n|Mar high F = 45.0\n|Apr high F = 56.0\n|May high F = 66.0\n|Jun high F = 76.0\n|Jul high F = 82.0\n|Aug high F = 80.0\n|Sep high F = 72.0\n|Oct high F = 61.0\n|Nov high F = 52.0\n|Dec high F = 41.0\n|year high F= 58.83\n|Jan record low F = -30.0\n|Feb record low F = -18.0\n|Mar record low F = -8.0\n|Apr record low F = 11.0\n|May record low F = 31.0\n|Jun record low F = 41.0\n|Jul record low F = 50.0\n|Aug record low F = 46.0\n|Sep record low F = 34.0\n|Oct record low F = 25.0\n|Nov record low F = -2.0\n|Dec record low F = -17.0\n|Jan low F = 22.0\n|Feb low F = 25.0\n|Mar low F = 31.0\n|Apr low F = 41.0\n|May low F = 50.0\n|Jun low F = 60.0\n|Jul low F = 65.0\n|Aug low F = 65.0\n|Sep low F = 57.0\n|Oct low F = 47.0\n|Nov low F = 38.0\n|Dec low F = 28.0\n|year low F= 44.08\n|Jan precipitation inch = 3.36\n|Feb precipitation inch = 3.38\n|Mar precipitation inch = 4.32\n|Apr precipitation inch = 3.74\n|May precipitation inch = 3.49\n|Jun precipitation inch = 3.68\n|Jul precipitation inch = 3.43\n|Aug precipitation inch = 3.35\n|Sep precipitation inch = 3.44\n|Oct precipitation inch = 3.94\n|Nov precipitation inch = 3.99\n|Dec precipitation inch = 3.78\n|year precipitation inch = 43.9\n|source 1 = Weather.com<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/02445 | publisher=Open Publishing |year=2009 |title=Brookline, MA Weather Data |accessdate=21 February 2014}}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\nBrookline falls under the [[USDA]] 6b Plant [[Hardiness zone]].<ref>| <USDA.gov= >{{cite web\n |url        = http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/#\n |title        = USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map\n |year        = 2012\n |publisher        = Agricultural Research Center, PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State University;

This model states that positive ingroup descriptions and negative outgroup descriptions are abstract and vague, while negative ingroup descriptions and positive outgroup descriptions are specific and observable. Abstract statements are vague and harder to prove wrong, while, concrete statements are specific, and easy to brush off as exceptions to the rule, therefore keeping stereotypes intact (Whitley & Kite, 2010).\nLinguistic intergroup bias is more likely to occur when outgroup members are performing a group stereotype consistent action. This implies that the linguistic intergroup bias is a cognitive process that requires little motivation (Maass, et al. 1989).\n\n==Research==\nB. W. Gorham performed an experiment in which he presented an actual newscast to white individuals who took a pre-study survey about the amount of time they spent watching cable news TV, network news TV, regular television and news websites such as CNN.com. These subjects were then shown an actual news clip where a murder investigation is presented and the suspect had been described as either a black male or a white male.\n\nThere were significant differences in responses of participants who saw the white man portrayed as the suspect rather than the black man:  Participants said the white suspect  \u201cprobably hurt the victims\u201d. However, when the black man was presented as the suspect, the participants said the suspect  \u201cis probably violent\u201d (Gorham, 2006).  Gorham found that participants were more likely to describe the (negative) incident with adjectives, the most abstract description, if the suspect was presented as black and therefore outgroup, while using more concrete terms to describe the white (ingroup) suspect.\n\nRecent research has identified a related linguistic effect in which counterstereotypical individuals are liked significantly less than stereotypical individuals when they are described using behaviours but significantly more when they are described using traits. So, for example, people like \u201ca man who is crying\u201d less than \u201ca woman who is crying\u201d but they like \u201ca sensitive man\u201d more than \u201ca sensitive woman\u201d. In both cases, the man is counterstereotypical and the woman is stereotypical. However, in the former case the man and woman are described using a behaviour (\u201ccrying\u201d) and in the latter case they are described using a trait (\u201csensitive\u201d).

The new legal status was then named ''Torato Umanuto''. The original purpose was to reach a comprehensive accommodation (later called [[Status quo (Israel)|religious Status quo]]) between the secular community and the Haredi population who were then living under the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]], and to prevent an internal conflict within the Jewish population (the [[Yishuv]]) while Israel was pleading to the [[UN]] for a [[Jewish and Democratic State]].\n\nBy contrast, Jewish Israelis who belong to the [[Religious Zionism]] sector serve in the military, often under the system of [[Hesder]] yeshivas combining Torah study with military service.\n\nOver the course of the years, while the Israeli population grew, the number of Haredi men eligible for exemption under the ''Torato Umanuto'' grew even faster from 800 men in 1968 to 41,450 in 2005 compared to 7 million for the entire population of Israel. In percentage terms, 2.4% of the soldiers enlisting to the army in 1974 were benefiting from ''Torato Umanuto'' compared to 9.2% in 1999, when it was projected that the number would reach 15% by the year 2012. The issue turned into a political debate  within Israeli society as to who should be obliged to risk his or her life serving in the Israeli army; many Jewish Israelis who are not Haredi, including those in the [[Religious Zionism]] sector, started to complain over the uneven burden of military service and risk of life. Beyond the three years of regular-compulsory service for men and two for women, men also serve as military reserve force, including military exercises on regular basis until they turn 50.\n\nFor many years the ''Torato Umanuto'' arrangement had the status of a regulation under the jurisdiction of the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Ministry of Defense]] (Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion also had the Defense portfolio). In the 1990s the [[Supreme Court of Israel#Court of Justice|High Court of Justice]] of Israel ruled that the Defense minister had no authority to determine the extent of these exemptions.
