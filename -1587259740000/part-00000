The light hairs around this [[foal]]'s muzzle and eyes indicate that it will gray like its mother. Not all foals show signs of graying this young.]]\nA gray [[foal]] may be born any color. However, [[bay (color)|bay]], [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]], or [[black (horse)|black]] base colors are most often seen.  As the horse matures, white hairs begin to replace the base or birth color. Usually white hairs are first seen by the muzzle, eyes and flanks, occasionally at birth, and usually by the age of one year. Over time, white hairs replace the birth color and the horse changes slowly to either a ''rose gray'', ''salt and pepper'' (or ''iron'' gray), or ''dapple gray.''  As the horse ages, the coat continues to lighten to a pure ''white '' or ''fleabitten'' gray hair coat. Thus, the many variations of gray coloring in horses are intermediate steps that a young horse takes while ''graying out'' from a birth color to a hair coat that is completely \"white.\"\n\nDifferent breeds, and individuals within each breed, take differing amounts of time to gray out. Thus, graying cannot be used to approximate the age of a horse except in the broadest of terms: a very young horse will never have a white coat (unless it is a true [[white (horse)|white horse]]), while a horse in its teens usually is completely grayed out. One must also be careful not to confuse the small amount of gray hairs that may appear on some older horses in their late teens or twenties, which do not reflect the gray gene and never cause a complete graying of the horse.\n\nThis change in hair color can be confusing. Many new horse owners, not understanding the workings of the gray gene, are disappointed to discover that their dapple gray horse turns completely white a few years later.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  Other times, people traveling with gray horses who have a pure white hair coat have encountered problems with non-horse-oriented officials such as police officers or border guards who are unclear about a horse who has papers saying it is \"gray\" when the horse in front of them appears white.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\nTo further complicate matters, the skin and eyes may be other colors if influenced by other factors such as [[Horse markings|white markings]], certain [[Pinto horse|white spotting patterns]] or [[dilution gene]]s.\n\n===Young gray horses===\n[[Image:Julgamento_\u00c1rabe_REFON.jpg|thumb|left|This yearling [[Arabian horse]] originally chestnut or bay, could be misclassified as roan. This stage is often called rose or iron gray.]]\nAn intermediate stage in young horses that are in the early stages of turning gray is sometimes called \"salt and pepper,\" \"iron gray,\" or \"steel gray.\" This coloring occurs when white and black hairs are intermingled on the body, usually seen in horses that are born black or dark bay.  This is the most common intermediate form of gray, which can give a silvery look to the coat.  \"Rose gray\" is a term used to describe this intermediate stage for a horse born a chestnut or lighter bay color. While these colors are \"graying out,\" both red and white hairs are often mixed on the body. Thus rose gray horses have a slight pinkish tinge to their graying coat. These horses are sometimes confused with  [[roan (horse)|roan]]s, but a gray continues to lighten with age, while a roan does not. Roaning also causes fewer white hairs on the legs and head, giving the horse the appearance of dark points, which is usually not true of gray.\n\n===Dapple gray===\n[[Image:Mangalarga Marchador.jpg|thumb|The dapple gray coat of this mature [[Mangalarga Marchador]] is becoming white, and the horse will eventually be completely white-haired.]]\n\"Dapple gray\" is an intermediate stage not seen on all grays, but often considered highly attractive.  It consists of a dark hair coat with \"dapples,\" which are dark rings with lighter hairs on the inside of the ring, scattered over the entire body of the animal. It is another possible intermediate step in the graying process of the horse. Dappled grays should not be confused with the slight dappling \"bloom\" seen on horses that are very healthy or slightly overweight, as \"bloom\" dapples disappear should the horse lose condition.\n\n===The \"flea-bitten\" gray===\n[[File:Asil Arabian Mare AC2008 0001.jpg|thumb|left|This [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] mare is a \"flea-bitten\" gray.  Note red speckles on white hair coat.]]\nA horse that has completely changed its base coat will either be pure white or \"flea-bitten\" gray. Flea-bitten gray is a color consisting of a white hair coat with small speckles or \"freckles\" of red-colored hair throughout. Most horses who become flea-bitten grays still go through a brief period when they are pure white.\n\nThe flea-bitten pattern, like freckles on a human, can also vary: Some horses may appear almost pure white, with only a few speckles observed on close examination. Others may have so many speckles that they are occasionally mistaken for a roan or even a type of [[sabino horse|sabino]]. One unique form of flea-bitten gray is the \"bloody shouldered\" horse. This is an animal that is so heavily flea-bitten on certain parts of the body, usually the shoulder area, that it almost appears as if blood had been spilled on the horse, hence the name. Arabian horse breeders hold the view that traditions of the desert [[Bedouin]] people considered the \"bloody shoulder\" to be a prized trait in a war mare and much desired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babsonarabians.com/Readers_Corner/Holly.htm|title=Holly|author=|date=|website=www.babsonarabians.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe flea-bitten pattern is seen primarily in heterozygous Grays.\n==The genetics of gray==\n[[File:Grey horse melanoma 3.JPG|thumb|Perianal gray horse melanoma]]\n[[File:Grey horse melanoma 1.JPG|thumb|Perianal gray horse melanoma, histology of tumor]]\n{{See also|Equine coat color genetics}}\nThe gray gene (G) is an autosomal [[dominant gene]].<ref name=locke2002/> In simple terms, a horse which has even one copy of the gray [[allele]], even if it has a gene for another coloring, will always become gray.  If a gray horse is [[homozygous]] (GG), meaning that it has a gray [[allele]] from both parents, it will always produce gray offspring. However, if a gray horse is [[heterozygous]] (Gg), meaning it inherits one copy of the [[recessive gene]] (g), that animal may produce offspring who are not gray (depending on what color gene an offspring inherits from its other parent).  Conversely, a gray horse must have at least one gray parent.  Genetic testing is now possible to determine whether a horse is homozygous or heterozygous for gray, or if it does not carry the gene at all.<ref>[http://www.animalgenetics.us/Gray.htm \"Gray - Horse Coat Color DNA Testing.\"  ''Animal Genetics, Incorporated.'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025094702/http://www.animalgenetics.us/Gray.htm |date=2010-10-25 }}. web page accessed August 29, 2008</ref>  The gray gene does not affect skin or eye color, so grays typically have dark skin and eyes, as opposed to the unpigmented pink skin of [[white (horse)|white horses]].<ref name=locke2002>{{cite journal |last=Locke |first=MM |author2=MCT Penedo |author3=SJ Brickker |author4=LV Millon |author5=JD Murray  |title=Linkage of the grey coat colour locus to microsatellites on horse chromosome 25 |journal=Animal Genetics |volume=33 |year=2002 |pages=329\u2013337 |quote=The progressive loss of colour in the hair of grey horses is controlled by a dominantly inherited allele at the Grey locus (G^G).

However, most [[White (horse)|white]] horses have pink skin and some have blue eyes. A horse with dark skin and dark eyes under a white hair coat is gray.  However, a gray horse with an underlying [[cream gene|homozygous cream]] base coat color may be born with rosy-pink skin, blue eyes and near-white hair. In such cases, DNA testing may clarify the genetics of the horse.\n\n===Roan===\nSome grays in intermediate stages of graying may be confused with a [[roan (horse)|roan]] or a [[rabicano]]. Some heavily fleabitten grays may also be confused with roans. However, roans are easily distinguishable from grays: roan consists of individual white hairs on a dark base coat, usually with the head and legs of the horse darker than the rest of the body. Rabicanos also have intermixed white hairs primarily on the body with a dark head.  With gray horses, the head is often the first area to lighten, especially around the eyes and muzzle. Also, roans do not lighten with age, while grays always do.\n\nThe [[varnish roan]] is another unusual coloration, sometimes seen in [[Appaloosa]] horses, that, like gray, can change with age, but unlike gray, the horse does not become progressively lighter until it is pure white. Varnish roans are created by the action of [[leopard complex]] within breeds such as the Appaloosa and are seldom seen elsewhere.\n\n===Diluted colors===\n[[File:Blue Dun Silver Dapple.jpg|thumb|Horse with both Blue dun and silver dapple dilution]]\nThe [[dilution gene]]s that create dun, cream, pearl, silver dapple and champagne coloring may occasionally result in confusion with gray.\n\nSome horses with a particular type of [[dun (color)|dun]] hair coat known as a \"blue dun\", [[grullo]], or \"mouse\" dun appear to be a solid gray. However, this color is caused by the [[dun gene]] acting on a black base coat, and horses who are dun have all hairs the same color; there is no intermingling of white and dark hairs. Also, dun horses do not get lighter as they age. Horses that are a light cream color are also not grays. These are usually cremello, perlino or smoky cream horses, all colors produced by the action of the [[cream gene]]. However, if a gray parent passes on the gene, the hairs will turn white like any other gray. Another cream-colored dilution, the [[pearl gene]] or \"barlink factor\", may also create very light-coated horses. Similarly, the [[champagne gene]] can lighten coat color, often producing dappling or light colors that can be confused with gray.\n\nIn spite of its name, the [[silver dapple gene]] has nothing to do with graying. It is a dilution gene that acts only on a [[black (horse)|black]] coat, diluting the coat to a dark brown and the mane to a flaxen shade. Horses that express the silver dapple gene (and do not have the gray gene) are born that color and it will not lighten. However, again, if one parent passes on the gray gene, the gray gene will again be dominant.\n\n==Mythology==\n{{See also|White horse (mythology)}}\nThroughout history, both gray and [[white (horse)|white]] horses have been mythologized. As part of its legendary dimension, the gray horse in myth has been depicted with seven heads ([[Uchaishravas]]) or eight feet ([[Sleipnir]]), sometimes in groups or singly. There are also mythological tales of divinatory gray horses who prophesy or warn of danger.<!--some evidence that the gray horse had special status because it \"magically\" turned white, but will need sourcing to add to article-->\n\n==See also==\n*[[Albinism]]\n*[[Equine coat color]]\n*[[Equine coat color genetics]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/coatcolor.php \"Introduction to Coat Color Genetics\"] ''from'' Veterinary Genetics Laboratory, School of Veterinary Medicine, [[University of California]], Davis.

This stage is often called rose or iron gray.]]\nAn intermediate stage in young horses that are in the early stages of turning gray is sometimes called \"salt and pepper,\" \"iron gray,\" or \"steel gray.\" This coloring occurs when white and black hairs are intermingled on the body, usually seen in horses that are born black or dark bay.  This is the most common intermediate form of gray, which can give a silvery look to the coat.  \"Rose gray\" is a term used to describe this intermediate stage for a horse born a chestnut or lighter bay color. While these colors are \"graying out,\" both red and white hairs are often mixed on the body. Thus rose gray horses have a slight pinkish tinge to their graying coat. These horses are sometimes confused with  [[roan (horse)|roan]]s, but a gray continues to lighten with age, while a roan does not. Roaning also causes fewer white hairs on the legs and head, giving the horse the appearance of dark points, which is usually not true of gray.\n\n===Dapple gray===\n[[Image:Mangalarga Marchador.jpg|thumb|The dapple gray coat of this mature [[Mangalarga Marchador]] is becoming white, and the horse will eventually be completely white-haired.]]\n\"Dapple gray\" is an intermediate stage not seen on all grays, but often considered highly attractive.  It consists of a dark hair coat with \"dapples,\" which are dark rings with lighter hairs on the inside of the ring, scattered over the entire body of the animal. It is another possible intermediate step in the graying process of the horse. Dappled grays should not be confused with the slight dappling \"bloom\" seen on horses that are very healthy or slightly overweight, as \"bloom\" dapples disappear should the horse lose condition.\n\n===The \"flea-bitten\" gray===\n[[File:Asil Arabian Mare AC2008 0001.jpg|thumb|left|This [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] mare is a \"flea-bitten\" gray.  Note red speckles on white hair coat.]]\nA horse that has completely changed its base coat will either be pure white or \"flea-bitten\" gray. Flea-bitten gray is a color consisting of a white hair coat with small speckles or \"freckles\" of red-colored hair throughout. Most horses who become flea-bitten grays still go through a brief period when they are pure white.\n\nThe flea-bitten pattern, like freckles on a human, can also vary: Some horses may appear almost pure white, with only a few speckles observed on close examination. Others may have so many speckles that they are occasionally mistaken for a roan or even a type of [[sabino horse|sabino]]. One unique form of flea-bitten gray is the \"bloody shouldered\" horse. This is an animal that is so heavily flea-bitten on certain parts of the body, usually the shoulder area, that it almost appears as if blood had been spilled on the horse, hence the name. Arabian horse breeders hold the view that traditions of the desert [[Bedouin]] people considered the \"bloody shoulder\" to be a prized trait in a war mare and much desired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.babsonarabians.com/Readers_Corner/Holly.htm|title=Holly|author=|date=|website=www.babsonarabians.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe flea-bitten pattern is seen primarily in heterozygous Grays.\n==The genetics of gray==\n[[File:Grey horse melanoma 3.JPG|thumb|Perianal gray horse melanoma]]\n[[File:Grey horse melanoma 1.JPG|thumb|Perianal gray horse melanoma, histology of tumor]]\n{{See also|Equine coat color genetics}}\nThe gray gene (G) is an autosomal [[dominant gene]].<ref name=locke2002/> In simple terms, a horse which has even one copy of the gray [[allele]], even if it has a gene for another coloring, will always become gray.  If a gray horse is [[homozygous]] (GG), meaning that it has a gray [[allele]] from both parents, it will always produce gray offspring. However, if a gray horse is [[heterozygous]] (Gg), meaning it inherits one copy of the [[recessive gene]] (g), that animal may produce offspring who are not gray (depending on what color gene an offspring inherits from its other parent).  Conversely, a gray horse must have at least one gray parent.  Genetic testing is now possible to determine whether a horse is homozygous or heterozygous for gray, or if it does not carry the gene at all.<ref>[http://www.animalgenetics.us/Gray.htm \"Gray - Horse Coat Color DNA Testing.\"  ''Animal Genetics, Incorporated.'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025094702/http://www.animalgenetics.us/Gray.htm |date=2010-10-25 }}. web page accessed August 29, 2008</ref>  The gray gene does not affect skin or eye color, so grays typically have dark skin and eyes, as opposed to the unpigmented pink skin of [[white (horse)|white horses]].<ref name=locke2002>{{cite journal |last=Locke |first=MM |author2=MCT Penedo |author3=SJ Brickker |author4=LV Millon |author5=JD Murray  |title=Linkage of the grey coat colour locus to microsatellites on horse chromosome 25 |journal=Animal Genetics |volume=33 |year=2002 |pages=329\u2013337 |quote=The progressive loss of colour in the hair of grey horses is controlled by a dominantly inherited allele at the Grey locus (G^G).

However, most [[White (horse)|white]] horses have pink skin and some have blue eyes. A horse with dark skin and dark eyes under a white hair coat is gray.  However, a gray horse with an underlying [[cream gene|homozygous cream]] base coat color may be born with rosy-pink skin, blue eyes and near-white hair. In such cases, DNA testing may clarify the genetics of the horse.\n\n===Roan===\nSome grays in intermediate stages of graying may be confused with a [[roan (horse)|roan]] or a [[rabicano]]. Some heavily fleabitten grays may also be confused with roans. However, roans are easily distinguishable from grays: roan consists of individual white hairs on a dark base coat, usually with the head and legs of the horse darker than the rest of the body. Rabicanos also have intermixed white hairs primarily on the body with a dark head.  With gray horses, the head is often the first area to lighten, especially around the eyes and muzzle. Also, roans do not lighten with age, while grays always do.\n\nThe [[varnish roan]] is another unusual coloration, sometimes seen in [[Appaloosa]] horses, that, like gray, can change with age, but unlike gray, the horse does not become progressively lighter until it is pure white. Varnish roans are created by the action of [[leopard complex]] within breeds such as the Appaloosa and are seldom seen elsewhere.\n\n===Diluted colors===\n[[File:Blue Dun Silver Dapple.jpg|thumb|Horse with both Blue dun and silver dapple dilution]]\nThe [[dilution gene]]s that create dun, cream, pearl, silver dapple and champagne coloring may occasionally result in confusion with gray.\n\nSome horses with a particular type of [[dun (color)|dun]] hair coat known as a \"blue dun\", [[grullo]], or \"mouse\" dun appear to be a solid gray. However, this color is caused by the [[dun gene]] acting on a black base coat, and horses who are dun have all hairs the same color; there is no intermingling of white and dark hairs. Also, dun horses do not get lighter as they age. Horses that are a light cream color are also not grays. These are usually cremello, perlino or smoky cream horses, all colors produced by the action of the [[cream gene]]. However, if a gray parent passes on the gene, the hairs will turn white like any other gray. Another cream-colored dilution, the [[pearl gene]] or \"barlink factor\", may also create very light-coated horses. Similarly, the [[champagne gene]] can lighten coat color, often producing dappling or light colors that can be confused with gray.\n\nIn spite of its name, the [[silver dapple gene]] has nothing to do with graying. It is a dilution gene that acts only on a [[black (horse)|black]] coat, diluting the coat to a dark brown and the mane to a flaxen shade. Horses that express the silver dapple gene (and do not have the gray gene) are born that color and it will not lighten. However, again, if one parent passes on the gray gene, the gray gene will again be dominant.\n\n==Mythology==\n{{See also|White horse (mythology)}}\nThroughout history, both gray and [[white (horse)|white]] horses have been mythologized. As part of its legendary dimension, the gray horse in myth has been depicted with seven heads ([[Uchaishravas]]) or eight feet ([[Sleipnir]]), sometimes in groups or singly. There are also mythological tales of divinatory gray horses who prophesy or warn of danger.<!--some evidence that the gray horse had special status because it \"magically\" turned white, but will need sourcing to add to article-->\n\n==See also==\n*[[Albinism]]\n*[[Equine coat color]]\n*[[Equine coat color genetics]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.vgl.ucdavis.edu/services/coatcolor.php \"Introduction to Coat Color Genetics\"] ''from'' Veterinary Genetics Laboratory, School of Veterinary Medicine, [[University of California]], Davis.
