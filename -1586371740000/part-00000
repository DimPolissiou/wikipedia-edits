The diffusion of the almost [[Manichaean]] sect of [[Paulician]]s westwards gave birth to the famous 11th and 12th century heresies of Western Europe. The first one was that of [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] in modern-day Bulgaria, a sort of sanctuary between Eastern and Western Christianity. By the 11th century, more organised groups such as the [[Pataria|Patarini]], the [[Dulcinian]]s, the [[Waldensians]] and the [[Cathars]] were beginning to appear in the towns and cities of northern Italy, southern France and Flanders.\n\nIn France the Cathars grew to represent a popular mass movement and the belief was spreading to other areas.<ref>\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,897752-1,00.html Massacre of the Pure].\" ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.

During the thirty-eight years of [[Henry VIII]]'s reign, about sixty heretics, mainly Protestants, were executed and a rather greater number of Catholics lost their lives on grounds of political offences such as treason, notably [[Sir Thomas More]] and Cardinal [[John Fisher]], for refusing to accept the king's supremacy over the Church in England.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUCY3otvttEC&pg=PA221&dq=More+refusal+accept+royal+supremacy+church&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0NglU8WWGMeShQfup4HgDQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=More%20refusal%20accept%20royal%20supremacy%20church&f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Tudor England|work=google.com}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wBdOvs2THGEC&pg=PA302&dq=More+refusal+accept+royal+supremacy+church&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0NglU8WWGMeShQfup4HgDQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=More%20refusal%20accept%20royal%20supremacy%20church&f=false Ron Christenson, ''Political Trials in History'' (Transaction Publishers 1991] {{ISBN|978-0-88738406-6}}), p. 302</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=pwoTGSsiqa4C&pg=PA558&dq=More+refusal+accept+royal+supremacy+church&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6t4lU6myMdGGhQeB3IHgAw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=More%20refusal%20accept%20royal%20supremacy%20church&f=false Oliver O'Donovan, Joan Lockwood O'Donovan, ''From Irenaeus to Grotius'' (Eerdmans 1999] {{ISBN|978-0-80284209-1}}), p. 558</ref> Under [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]], the heresy laws were repealed in 1547 only to be reintroduced in 1554 by [[Mary I of England|Mary I]]; even so two radicals were executed in Edward's reign (one for denying the reality of the incarnation, the other for denying Christ's divinity).<ref name=\"Dickens\">Dickens, A.G.

''The Reformation'' Penguin 2003, p.&nbsp;679</ref>\n\nAnother example of the persecution of heretics under Protestant rule was the execution of the [[Boston martyrs]] in 1659, 1660, and 1661. These executions resulted from the actions of the [[Anglican]] [[Puritans]], who at that time wielded political as well as ecclesiastic control in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. At the time, the colony leaders were apparently hoping to achieve their vision of a \"purer absolute theocracy\" within their colony .{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} As such, they perceived the teachings and practices of the rival Quaker sect as heretical, even to the point where laws were passed and executions were performed with the aim of ridding their colony of such perceived \"heresies\". {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n===Modern era===\n{{See also|Christian heresy in the modern era}}\nThe trial and subsequent execution of heretics under the banner of Christianity came to an end in 1826 with the last execution of a \"heretic\", [[Cayetano Ripoll]], by the [[Spanish Inquisition]].\n\nAlthough less common than in earlier periods, in modern times, formal charges of heresy within Christian churches still occur. Issues in the Protestant churches have included modern biblical criticism and the nature of God. In the Catholic Church, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] criticizes writings for \"ambiguities and errors\" without using the word \"heresy\".<ref>An example is the [https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010515_vidal_en.html Notification regarding certain writings of Fr.

Hitler became his godfather. He had a sister, Hertha, who died at the age of 5. He received his school education in England and Germany, where he also joined the [[Hitler Youth|Hitler Youth (HJ)]].\n\nHe went to the United States to study and was also an American citizen from birth on. As the son of a prominent former top official of the [[NSDAP]], about whom the American press reported regularly, Hanfstaengl also came into the focus of the reporting. The [[New York Times]] announced the admission of the 18-year-old to [[Harvard University]].<ref>''Hitler Ex-Aide's Son in Harvard.'' In: ''New York Times'', 23. September 1939.</ref> The newspaper also reported that he volunteered for the [[United States Army Air Corps]] in early 1941.<ref>''Hanfstaengl Jr. In Army; Harvard Man, Son of Ex-Nazi, Enlists in American Forces.'' In: ''New York Times, '' 30. Januar 1941.</ref><ref>[[Carlos Widmann]], [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-10126959.html Play it again, Putzi]. ''Der Spiegel'', 10/1999.</ref> The news about Hanfstaengl's entry into the [[US Army]] also received attention from [[Minister of Propaganda]] [[Joseph Goebbels]], he made a corresponding entry in his diary.<ref>''Die Tageb\u00fccher von Joseph Goebbels.'' Hrsg. Elke Fr\u00f6hlich. T. I, Bd. 9. M\u00fcnchen 1998, S. 119.</ref>\n\nJournalist [[John Franklin Carter]], who, as a consultant to [[US President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], had psychological assessments prepared of some Nazi leaders, also asked Hanfstaengl's father and his son. When Hanfstaengl started working on a book about the HJ, Roosevelt, who knew his father Ernst Hanfstaengl from studying in Harvard, spontaneously dictated several paragraphs for a foreword, according to the Carters report.<ref>Joseph E. Persico: ''Roosevelt's Secret War. FDR and World War II Espionage.'' New York 2002, S. 232.</ref> According to American records, Hanfstaengl offered Roosevelt to travel to Hitler in the [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]] near [[Berchtesgaden]] in 1943 to attack him, but the White House ignored this suggestion.<ref>Joseph E. Persico: ''Roosevelt's Secret War. FDR and World War II Espionage.''

He received his school education in England and Germany, where he also joined the [[Hitler Youth|Hitler Youth (HJ)]].\n\nHe went to the United States to study and was also an American citizen from birth on. As the son of a prominent former top official of the [[NSDAP]], about whom the American press reported regularly, Hanfstaengl also came into the focus of the reporting. The [[New York Times]] announced the admission of the 18-year-old to [[Harvard University]].<ref>''Hitler Ex-Aide's Son in Harvard.'' In: ''New York Times'', 23.

Roosevelt]], had psychological assessments prepared of some Nazi leaders, also asked Hanfstaengl's father and his son. When Hanfstaengl started working on a book about the HJ, Roosevelt, who knew his father Ernst Hanfstaengl from studying in Harvard, spontaneously dictated several paragraphs for a foreword, according to the Carters report.<ref>Joseph E.

It is based on Leah Napolin and [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]]'s [[Yentl|play of the same name]], itself based on Singer's short story \"Yentl the Yeshiva Boy.\"\n\nThe dramatic story incorporates humor and music to relate the story of an [[Ashkenazi]] [[Judaism|Jewish]] girl in [[Poland]] who decides to dress and live like a man so that she can receive an education in [[Talmudic Law]] after her father dies. The film's [[Film score|musical score]] and songs, composed by [[Michel Legrand]], include the songs \"[[Papa, Can You Hear Me?]]\" and \"[[The Way He Makes Me Feel]]\", both sung by Streisand. The film received the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] and the [[Golden Globe Award]]s for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture\u2014Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Streisand, making her the first, and only, woman to have won Best Director at the Golden Globes.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Barbra Streisand]] portrays Yentl Mendel, a girl living in an Ashkenazi [[shtetl]] named Pechev<ref>{{cite journal|last=Whitfield|first=Stephen|title=Yentl|journal=Jewish Social Studies|date=January 1999|page=154}}</ref> in [[Poland]] in 1904. Yentl's father, Rebbe Mendel ([[Nehemiah Persoff]]), secretly instructs her in the [[Talmud]] despite the proscription of such study by women according to the custom of her community.\n\nAfter the death of her father, Yentl decides to cut her hair short, dress like a man, take her late brother's name, Anshel, and enter a [[Yeshiva|Jewish religious school]] in [[Bychawa]]. Upon entering the yeshiva, Yentl befriends a fellow student, Avigdor ([[Mandy Patinkin]]), and meets his fianc\u00e9e, Hadass ([[Amy Irving]]). Things get complicated when Hadass's family cancels her wedding to Avigdor over fears that his family is tainted with insanity (his brother committed suicide), and decides that she should marry Anshel instead. Meanwhile, Hadass develops romantic feelings for Yentl (as Anshel), while Yentl herself is falling in love with Avigdor. After much turmoil, Avigdor and Hadass are reunited, while Yentl leaves [[Europe]] to go to the United States, where she hopes to lead a life with more freedom.\n\n==Themes==\n''Yentl'' begins with the same premise as Singer's original story. Streisand's character is a young woman growing up in an oppressive society that will not let her pursue her religious education. She is told she must have the \"soul of a man\" because of her desire to learn.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Whitfield|first=Stephen|title=Yentl|journal=Jewish Social Studies|date=Autumn 1998 \u2013 Winter 1999|volume=5|issue=1/2|page=154|doi=10.2979/jss.1998.5.1-2.154}}</ref> Her talent, curiosity and ambition are considered strictly masculine by her society and religious tradition. Unwilling to live without access to education on the basis of sex, Yentl leaves her home and conceals her sex to be able to pursue the scholarly occupation of a Jewish man. In doing so, Yentl inadvertently embarks on a journey of self-discovery that defies traditional ideas of gender roles within her community.\n\nYentl's defiance of social expectation and her reversal of traditional gender roles crosses deeply rooted religious boundaries, particularly once Yentl marries Hadass. Until this point, Yentl only adopts the appearance and occupation of a man, but now she lives as a man in a more complete sense, as a husband, occupying the traditionally male role in her household. Her identity as a woman, not only socially and religiously, but also personally and sexually, is called into question, as she occupies this role and develops an intimate, loving connection with Hadass, complete with hinted sexual chemistry.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fernley|first=Allison|author2=Paula Maloof |title=Yentl by Barbra Streisand|journal=Film Quarterly|date=Spring 1985|volume=38|issue=3|page=43|doi=10.1525/fq.1985.38.3.04a00070}}</ref>\n\nIn Singer's story, this dual betrayal of nature and the divine plan dooms Yentl to a life of pain, alienation, and shameful dishonesty. After her marriage ends in disaster, Yentl remains trapped forever in her disguise, unable to find redemption from her rejection of a normal life\u2014a take on the legend of the [[Wandering Jew]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fernley|first=Allison|author2=Paula Maloof |title=Yentl by Barbra Streisand|journal=Film Quarterly|date=Spring 1985|volume=38|issue=3|pages=39\u201341|doi=10.1525/fq.1985.38.3.04a00070}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Whitfield|first=Stephen|title=Yentl|journal=Jewish Social Studies|date=Autumn 1998 \u2013 Winter 1999|volume=5|issue=1/2|pages=170\u2013171|doi=10.2979/jss.1998.5.1-2.154}}</ref>\n\nIn Streisand's film, Yentl's defiance of expectation and definition, a rejection of sexist gender roles, is treated as a virtue. Though Yentl faces difficult choices in her attempt to live the life of her choosing, including sacrificing her love of Avigdor, she finds herself capable of following her dreams, of feeling different forms of love and intimacy with both sexes, as well as emerging from confusion and ambiguity with a powerful, independent sense of self-worth. At the film's conclusion, Yentl takes this developed, ever-evolving self to America to seek new possibilities and opportunities for discovery. Singer criticized the film's ending as hopelessly unrealistic, but the ending serves more as an affirmation of Yentl's independence and relentless optimism than a historically fitting conclusion to the narrative.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/04/27/reviews/streisand-singer.html \"I. B. Singer Talks to I. B. Singer About the Movie 'Yentl'\". ''New York Times''].</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Fernley|first=Allison|author2=Paula Maloof |title=Yentl by Barbra Streisand|journal=Film Quarterly|date=Spring 1985|volume=38|issue=3|pages=38\u201346|doi=10.1525/fq.1985.38.3.04a00070}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Whitfield|first=Stephen|title=Yentl|journal=Jewish Social Studies|date=Autumn 1998 \u2013 Winter 1999|volume=5|issue=1/2|pages=160\u2013161|doi=10.2979/jss.1998.5.1-2.154}}</ref>\n\nThroughout her complex interaction with Hadass and Avigdor, Yentl manages conflict with empathy and\nrespect. Her difficult experiences expand, rather than trap her personality. She does not conform to expectations from her surroundings or from her audience, neither remaining merely a woman hiding in men's clothing nor revealing herself to be neutered or firmly homosexual. She refuses to accept a limited, traditional life, even when offered one in marriage to Avigdor. Rather, Yentl becomes a \"real woman,\" thoroughly modern and encompassing \"what society has defined as both masculine and\nfeminine traits.\"<ref name=\"Fernley 39\u201340\">{{cite journal|last=Fernley|first=Allison|author2=Paula Maloof |title=Yentl by Barbra Streisand|journal=Film Quarterly|date=Spring 1985|volume=38|issue=3|pages=39\u201340|doi=10.1525/fq.1985.38.3.04a00070}}</ref> In the end, her pain, her confusion and her loss never destroy her hope or resolve. She remains assertive and defiant, daring to find or to create room for new self-definition and new possibility, without seeking simple or complete resolution to ongoing challenges in her constant thirst for more.\n\nThough Isaac Bashevis Singer insisted that ''Yentl'' does not have feminist undertones,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Whitfield|first=Stephen|title=Yentl|journal=Jewish Social Studies|date=January 1999|volume=5|issue=1/2|pages=76\u2013154|doi=10.2979/jss.1998.5.1-2.154}}</ref> many critics and viewers of the film consider Yentl to be a feminist role model. One reason is that she rebels against patriarchal Orthodox Jewish society by disguising herself as a man to do what she loves\u2014study the Torah. Another reason is that although she finds herself in love with Avigdor, she has the strength to leave him behind, in exchange for a freer life in the US.<ref name=\"Fernley 39\u201340\"/>\n\n===Jewish-American themes===\nStreisand's interpretation of I. B. Singer's \"Yentl the Yeshiva Boy\" has philosophical implications as a Jewish-American film. Streisand changed Singer's specific ending, in which Yentl wanders off, presumably to a different yeshiva, to continue her studies and her cross-dressing. In the film interpretation of the story, Yentl moves on, but this time to the US. Viewers are led to believe that in the States she can have both study and womanhood. This idea symbolizes a refusal to conform to old-world Jewish standards and instead move \"against the authority and authenticity of the Judaic past,\" which Streisand asserts has \"propelled itself so far from the austerity of Talmudic study.\"<ref name=\"Whitfield 1999 154\">{{cite journal|last=Whitfield|first=Stephen|title=Yentl|journal=Jewish Social Studies|date=31 January 1999|page=154}}</ref>\n\nOften, Jewish-American immigrants who struck out on their own were unable to dedicate the amount of time and energy into text study that their ancestors had; their lives instead were characterized by an \"individualism and experimentalism\" that \"Jewish immigrants and their descendants have so strikingly honored, reinforced, and revised.\"<ref name=\"Whitfield 1999 154\"/> The differences between the written version of this story, which originated in Warsaw, and the American film interpretation thus symbolize a potential philosophical shift from the self-understanding of Eastern-European Jewry to Jewish-American self-understanding: it suggests America can potentially alter preexisting Jewish values.<ref name=\"Whitfield 1999 154\"/>\n\n===Heterosexual themes===\n''Yentl'' blurs lines between male and female and its characters develop attractions that could be seen as homosexual, although the film upholds a heterosexual sensibility. Yentl's desire is exclusively for her study partner, Avigdor, while her marriage to a woman remains unconsummated and comic throughout the film.  Because Yentl chooses to reveal herself as a woman to Avigdor in hopes of gaining his love, Yentl firmly establishes herself as a heterosexual female force in the film.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rigney|first=Melissa|title=Brandon Goes to Hollywood: Boys Don't Cry and the Transgender Body in Film|journal=Film Criticism|date=Winter 2003}}</ref>\n\nWhile ''Yentl'' does not take its characters outside the realm of heterosexuality, the film critically questions the \"appropriateness of gender roles\" as determined by society.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fernley|first=Allison|author2=Paula Maloof |title=Yentl|journal=Film Quarterly|date=1985|volume=38|issue=3|page=41}}</ref> Ultimately it argues that the society Yentl lived in does not allow equal opportunities for happiness for all people, especially women.

However, like Passer, he was convinced that Streisand was too old and feminine to convincingly play the part the film would demand.<ref name=\"Riese 1993 407\"/> By 1976, after completing  ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star Is Born]]'', Streisand became convinced that she was, in fact, too old to play the part in ''Yentl'', and would take up the film as director.<ref name=\"Considine 1985 298\">{{cite book|last=Considine|first=Shaun|title=Barbra Streisand: The Woman, The Myth, The Music|year=1985|publisher=Delacorte Press|location=1 Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, New York, NY|page=298}}</ref> Because she had wanted to be both the star and director, studios continued to draw back from funding the film, with the fear that Streisand as a rookie director would be unable to responsibly handle a multi-million dollar project.<ref>{{cite book|last=Riese|first=Randall|title=Barbra Streisand: The Woman, The Myth, The Music|year=1985|publisher=Delacorte Press|location=1 Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, New York, NY|page=298}}</ref> Additionally, Streisand reported that studios claimed the film was \"not commercial\" because it was \"too ethnic.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Kroll|first=Jack|title=Barbra, the Yeshiva Boy|newspaper=Newsweek|date=1983|volume=102|issue=28|page=109}}</ref> In 1978, Streisand's friends, [[Alan and Marilyn Bergman]], suggested that ''Yentl'' be re-imagined as a musical.

For the sake of making memory of the occasion, Streisand had her brother take a photo of her standing next to her father's tombstone. The photo revealed that Emmanual Streisand's grave was directly next to that of a man named Anshel, the name of Yentl's dead brother that Yentl adopts when she takes on a male identity. Intrigued, Streisand asked her brother to contact a psychic to perform a seance, convinced that her father was beckoning her from beyond the grave to complete the film.<ref>{{cite book|last=Andersen|first=Christopher|title=Barbra: The Way She Is|year=2006|publisher=HarperCollins Publications|location=10 East 53rd st., New York, NY|page=274}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Riese|first=Randall|title=Her Name Is Barbra|year=1993|publisher=Carol Publishing Group|location=600 Madison Ave. New York, NY|page=411}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Considine|first=Shaun|title=Barbra Streisand: The Woman, The Myth, The Music|year=1985|publisher=Delacorte Press|location=1 Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, New York, NY|page=300}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Spada|first=James|title=Streisand: Her Life|year=1995|publisher=Crown Publishers, Inc.|location=201 East 50th St., New York, NY|page=404}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, Streisand finally reached an agreement with [[Orion Pictures]] to direct and star in ''Yentl''. She was working with a script by Ted Allen at the time, but discarded a majority of it, keeping the musical segments. The film was to be co-produced by Barbra's friends and associates: Joan Marshall Ashby and Jon Peters. To prepare for the film, Streisand exhaustively researched the many aspects of Judaism, ceremonies, relentless studying of the Torah, and consulted numerous rabbis,<ref name=\"Riese 1993 408\"/> one being Rabbi Lapin, whom Streisand appointed as the main religious consultant for the film.<ref>{{cite book|last=Riese|first=Randall|title=Her Name Is Barbra|year=1993|publisher=Carol Publishing|location=Madison Ave. New York, NY|page=410}}</ref>\n\nOrion Pictures made the announcement that it had agreed to produce ''Yentl'' as Barbra Streisand's directorial debut in the late summer of 1980. Traveling to Prague with a Super-8 camera and song lyrics, Streisand scouted out film locations while also shooting film of herself walking through the city in costume with early recordings of ''Yentl''{{'}}s soundtrack being played in the background.<ref>{{cite book|last=Andersen|first=Christopher|title=Barbra: The Way She Is|year=2006|publisher=HarperCollins|location=10 East 53rd st., New York, NY|page=278}}</ref> However, not long after her return, ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), a [[Michael Cimino]] picture produced by United Artists, lost $35 million at the box office, bringing Orion to cancel all films that exceeded a $10 million production cost in order to preserve itself. ''Yentl'', which was priced at $14 million, was cancelled.<ref name=\"Considine 1985 298\"/> The film was turned down again and again until Jon Peters, Peter Gruber, and Neil Bogart formed PolyGram Pictures and agreed to produce the film.

film|romantic]] [[musical film|musical]] [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed, co-written, co-produced by, and starring [[Barbra Streisand]]. It is based on Leah Napolin and [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]]'s [[Yentl|play of the same name]], itself based on Singer's short story \"Yentl the Yeshiva Boy.\"\n\nThe dramatic story incorporates humor and music to relate the story of an [[Ashkenazi]] [[Judaism|Jewish]] girl in [[Poland]] who decides to dress and live like a man so that she can receive an education in [[Talmudic Law]] after her father dies. The film's [[Film score|musical score]] and songs, composed by [[Michel Legrand]], include the songs \"[[Papa, Can You Hear Me?]]\" and \"[[The Way He Makes Me Feel]]\", both sung by Streisand. The film received the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]] and the [[Golden Globe Award]]s for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture\u2014Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Streisand, making her the first and only, woman to have won Best Director at the Golden Globes.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Barbra Streisand]] portrays Yentl Mendel, a girl living in an Ashkenazi [[shtetl]] named Pechev<ref>{{cite journal|last=Whitfield|first=Stephen|title=Yentl|journal=Jewish Social Studies|date=January 1999|page=154}}</ref> in [[Poland]] in 1904. Yentl's father, Rebbe Mendel ([[Nehemiah Persoff]]), secretly instructs her in the [[Talmud]] despite the proscription of such study by women according to the custom of her community.\n\nAfter the death of her father, Yentl decides to cut her hair short, dress like a man, take her late brother's name, Anshel, and enter a [[Yeshiva|Jewish religious school]] in [[Bychawa]]. Upon entering the yeshiva, Yentl befriends a fellow student, Avigdor ([[Mandy Patinkin]]), and meets his fianc\u00e9e, Hadass ([[Amy Irving]]). Things get complicated when Hadass's family cancels her wedding to Avigdor over fears that his family is tainted with insanity (his brother committed suicide), and decides that she should marry Anshel instead. Meanwhile, Hadass develops romantic feelings for Yentl (as Anshel), while Yentl herself is falling in love with Avigdor. After much turmoil, Avigdor and Hadass are reunited, while Yentl leaves [[Europe]] to go to the United States, where she hopes to lead a life with more freedom.\n\n==Themes==\n''Yentl'' begins with the same premise as Singer's original story. Streisand's character is a young woman growing up in an oppressive society that will not let her pursue her religious education. She is told she must have the \"soul of a man\" because of her desire to learn.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Whitfield|first=Stephen|title=Yentl|journal=Jewish Social Studies|date=Autumn 1998 \u2013 Winter 1999|volume=5|issue=1/2|page=154|doi=10.2979/jss.1998.5.1-2.154}}</ref> Her talent, curiosity and ambition are considered strictly masculine by her society and religious tradition. Unwilling to live without access to education on the basis of sex, Yentl leaves her home and conceals her sex to be able to pursue the scholarly occupation of a Jewish man. In doing so, Yentl inadvertently embarks on a journey of self-discovery that defies traditional ideas of gender roles within her community.\n\nYentl's defiance of social expectation and her reversal of traditional gender roles crosses deeply rooted religious boundaries, particularly once Yentl marries Hadass. Until this point, Yentl only adopts the appearance and occupation of a man, but now she lives as a man in a more complete sense, as a husband, occupying the traditionally male role in her household. Her identity as a woman, not only socially and religiously, but also personally and sexually, is called into question, as she occupies this role and develops an intimate, loving connection with Hadass, complete with hinted sexual chemistry.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fernley|first=Allison|author2=Paula Maloof |title=Yentl by Barbra Streisand|journal=Film Quarterly|date=Spring 1985|volume=38|issue=3|page=43|doi=10.1525/fq.1985.38.3.04a00070}}</ref>\n\nIn Singer's story, this dual betrayal of nature and the divine plan dooms Yentl to a life of pain, alienation, and shameful dishonesty. After her marriage ends in disaster, Yentl remains trapped forever in her disguise, unable to find redemption from her rejection of a normal life\u2014a take on the legend of the [[Wandering Jew]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fernley|first=Allison|author2=Paula Maloof |title=Yentl by Barbra Streisand|journal=Film Quarterly|date=Spring 1985|volume=38|issue=3|pages=39\u201341|doi=10.1525/fq.1985.38.3.04a00070}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Whitfield|first=Stephen|title=Yentl|journal=Jewish Social Studies|date=Autumn 1998 \u2013 Winter 1999|volume=5|issue=1/2|pages=170\u2013171|doi=10.2979/jss.1998.5.1-2.154}}</ref>\n\nIn Streisand's film, Yentl's defiance of expectation and definition, a rejection of sexist gender roles, is treated as a virtue. Though Yentl faces difficult choices in her attempt to live the life of her choosing, including sacrificing her love of Avigdor, she finds herself capable of following her dreams, of feeling different forms of love and intimacy with both sexes, as well as emerging from confusion and ambiguity with a powerful, independent sense of self-worth. At the film's conclusion, Yentl takes this developed, ever-evolving self to America to seek new possibilities and opportunities for discovery. Singer criticized the film's ending as hopelessly unrealistic, but the ending serves more as an affirmation of Yentl's independence and relentless optimism than a historically fitting conclusion to the narrative.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/04/27/reviews/streisand-singer.html \"I.

Her difficult experiences expand, rather than trap her personality. She does not conform to expectations from her surroundings or from her audience, neither remaining merely a woman hiding in men's clothing nor revealing herself to be neutered or firmly homosexual. She refuses to accept a limited, traditional life, even when offered one in marriage to Avigdor. Rather, Yentl becomes a \"real woman,\" thoroughly modern and encompassing \"what society has defined as both masculine and\nfeminine traits.\"<ref name=\"Fernley 39\u201340\">{{cite journal|last=Fernley|first=Allison|author2=Paula Maloof |title=Yentl by Barbra Streisand|journal=Film Quarterly|date=Spring 1985|volume=38|issue=3|pages=39\u201340|doi=10.1525/fq.1985.38.3.04a00070}}</ref> In the end, her pain, her confusion and her loss never destroy her hope or resolve. She remains assertive and defiant, daring to find or to create room for new self-definition and new possibility, without seeking simple or complete resolution to ongoing challenges in her constant thirst for more.\n\nThough Isaac Bashevis Singer insisted that ''Yentl'' does not have feminist undertones,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Whitfield|first=Stephen|title=Yentl|journal=Jewish Social Studies|date=January 1999|volume=5|issue=1/2|pages=76\u2013154|doi=10.2979/jss.1998.5.1-2.154}}</ref> many critics and viewers of the film consider Yentl to be a feminist role model. One reason is that she rebels against patriarchal Orthodox Jewish society by disguising herself as a man to do what she loves\u2014study the Torah. Another reason is that although she finds herself in love with Avigdor, she has the strength to leave him behind, in exchange for a freer life in the US.<ref name=\"Fernley 39\u201340\"/>\n\n===Jewish-American themes===\nStreisand's interpretation of I. B. Singer's \"Yentl the Yeshiva Boy\" has philosophical implications as a Jewish-American film. Streisand changed Singer's specific ending, in which Yentl wanders off, presumably to a different yeshiva, to continue her studies and her cross-dressing. In the film interpretation of the story, Yentl moves on, but this time to the US. Viewers are led to believe that in the States she can have both study and womanhood. This idea symbolizes a refusal to conform to old-world Jewish standards and instead move \"against the authority and authenticity of the Judaic past,\" which Streisand asserts has \"propelled itself so far from the austerity of Talmudic study.\"<ref name=\"Whitfield 1999 154\">{{cite journal|last=Whitfield|first=Stephen|title=Yentl|journal=Jewish Social Studies|date=31 January 1999|page=154}}</ref>\n\nOften, Jewish-American immigrants who struck out on their own were unable to dedicate the amount of time and energy into text study that their ancestors had; their lives instead were characterized by an \"individualism and experimentalism\" that \"Jewish immigrants and their descendants have so strikingly honored, reinforced, and revised.\"<ref name=\"Whitfield 1999 154\"/> The differences between the written version of this story, which originated in Warsaw, and the American film interpretation thus symbolize a potential philosophical shift from the self-understanding of Eastern-European Jewry to Jewish-American self-understanding: it suggests America can potentially alter preexisting Jewish values.<ref name=\"Whitfield 1999 154\"/>\n\n===Heterosexual themes===\n''Yentl'' blurs lines between male and female and its characters develop attractions that could be seen as homosexual, although the film upholds a heterosexual sensibility. Yentl's desire is exclusively for her study partner, Avigdor, while her marriage to a woman remains unconsummated and comic throughout the film.  Because Yentl chooses to reveal herself as a woman to Avigdor in hopes of gaining his love, Yentl firmly establishes herself as a heterosexual female force in the film.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rigney|first=Melissa|title=Brandon Goes to Hollywood: Boys Don't Cry and the Transgender Body in Film|journal=Film Criticism|date=Winter 2003}}</ref>\n\nWhile ''Yentl'' does not take its characters outside the realm of heterosexuality, the film critically questions the \"appropriateness of gender roles\" as determined by society.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fernley|first=Allison|author2=Paula Maloof |title=Yentl|journal=Film Quarterly|date=1985|volume=38|issue=3|page=41}}</ref> Ultimately it argues that the society Yentl lived in does not allow equal opportunities for happiness for all people, especially women.

For the sake of making memory of the occasion, Streisand had her brother take a photo of her standing next to her father's tombstone. The photo revealed that Emmanual Streisand's grave was directly next to that of a man named Anshel, the name of Yentl's dead brother that Yentl adopts when she takes on a male identity. Intrigued, Streisand asked her brother to contact a psychic to perform a seance, convinced that her father was beckoning her from beyond the grave to complete the film.<ref>{{cite book|last=Andersen|first=Christopher|title=Barbra: The Way She Is|year=2006|publisher=HarperCollins Publications|location=10 East 53rd st., New York, NY|page=274}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Riese|first=Randall|title=Her Name Is Barbra|year=1993|publisher=Carol Publishing Group|location=600 Madison Ave. New York, NY|page=411}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Considine|first=Shaun|title=Barbra Streisand: The Woman, The Myth, The Music|year=1985|publisher=Delacorte Press|location=1 Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, New York, NY|page=300}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Spada|first=James|title=Streisand: Her Life|year=1995|publisher=Crown Publishers, Inc.|location=201 East 50th St., New York, NY|page=404}}</ref>\n\nIn 1979, Streisand finally reached an agreement with [[Orion Pictures]] to direct and star in ''Yentl''. She was working with a script by Ted Allen at the time, but discarded a majority of it, keeping the musical segments. The film was to be co-produced by Barbra's friends and associates: Joan Marshall Ashby and Jon Peters. To prepare for the film, Streisand exhaustively researched the many aspects of Judaism, ceremonies, relentless studying of the Torah, and consulted numerous rabbis,<ref name=\"Riese 1993 408\"/> one being Rabbi Lapin, whom Streisand appointed as the main religious consultant for the film.<ref>{{cite book|last=Riese|first=Randall|title=Her Name Is Barbra|year=1993|publisher=Carol Publishing|location=Madison Ave. New York, NY|page=410}}</ref>\n\nOrion Pictures made the announcement that it had agreed to produce ''Yentl'' as Barbra Streisand's directorial debut in the late summer of 1980. Traveling to Prague with a Super-8 camera and song lyrics, Streisand scouted out film locations while also shooting film of herself walking through the city in costume with early recordings of ''Yentl''{{'}}s soundtrack being played in the background.<ref>{{cite book|last=Andersen|first=Christopher|title=Barbra: The Way She Is|year=2006|publisher=HarperCollins|location=10 East 53rd st., New York, NY|page=278}}</ref> However, not long after her return, ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), a [[Michael Cimino]] picture produced by United Artists, lost $35 million at the box office, bringing Orion to cancel all films that exceeded a $10 million production cost in order to preserve itself.
