[[Ferdinand de Saussure]] commented on 19th century evolutionary linguistics:\n{{Quote|text=\n\"Language was considered a specific sphere, a fourth natural kingdom ; this led to methods of reasoning which would have caused astonishment in other sciences. Today one cannot read a dozen lines written at that time without being struck by absurdities of reasoning and by the terminology used to justify these absurdities\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last=de Saussure|first=Ferdinand |title=Course in general linguistics |place=New York|publisher=Philosophy Library |date=1959 |orig-year=First published 1916|pages= |chapter= | url=https://monoskop.org/images/0/0b/Saussure_Ferdinand_de_Course_in_General_Linguistics_1959.pdf |isbn= 9780231157278| author-link=Ferdinand_de_Saussure}}</ref>|}}\n\n[[Mark Aronoff]] however argues that historical linguistics had its golden age during the time of Schleicher and his supporters, enjoying a place among the hard sciences, and considers the return of Darwnian linguistics as a positive development. [[Esa Itkonen]] nonetheless deems the revival of Darwinism as a hopeless enterprise:\n{{Quote|text=\n\"There is ... an application of intelligence in linguistic change which is absent in biological evolution; and this suffices to make the two domains totally disanalogous ... {{Square bracket open|1}}Grammaticalisation depends on{{Square bracket close|1}} cognitive processes, ultimately serving the goal of problem solving, which intelligent entities like humans must perform all the time, but which biological entities like genes cannot perform. Trying to eliminate this basic difference leads to confusion.\u201d<ref name=Itkonen_1999>{{cite journal |last=Itkonen |first=Esa |year=1999 |title=Functionalism yes, biologism no |url= |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Sprachwissenschaft |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=219\u2013221 |doi=10.1515/zfsw.1999.18.2.219|access-date=}}</ref>|}}\n\nItkonen also points out that the principles of natural selection are not applicable because language innovation and acceptance have the same source which is the speech community. In biological evolution, mutation and selection have different sources. This makes it possible for people to change their languages, but not their [[genotype]].<ref name=Itkonen_2011>{{cite journal |last1= Itkonen|first1= Esa|last2= |first2= |date= 2011|title= On Coseriu\u2019s legacy|url= http://www.romling.uni-tuebingen.de/energeia/zeitschrift/2011/pdf/On_Coserius_legacy.pdf|journal=Energeia |volume= |issue= III|pages= 1-29|doi= |access-date=2020-01-14 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Evolutionary biology}}\n{{col div|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Biolinguistics]]\n* [[Evolutionary psychology of language]]\n* [[FOXP2]]\n* [[Origin of language]]\n* [[Historical linguistics]]\n* [[Phylogenetic tree]]\n* [[Universal Darwinism]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |vauthors=Atkinson QD, Meade A, Venditti C, Greenhill SJ, Pagel M|title=Languages evolve in punctuational bursts |journal=Science |volume=319 |issue=5863 |pages=588 |year=2008 |pmid=18239118 |doi=10.1126/science.1149683}}\n*{{cite book |editor-last = Botha |editor-first = R |editor2 = Knight, C. |title = The Cradle of Language |series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749}}\n**{{cite book | last1 = Diller | first1 = Karl C. |last2 = Cann | first2 =Rebecca L. |title = Evidence Against a Genetic-Based Revolution in Language 50,000 Years Ago |editor=Rudolf Botha |editor2=Chris Knight| work= The Cradle of Language|series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749 | pages =135\u2013149}}\n**{{cite book |last = Power| first = Camilla |title=Sexual Selection Models for the Emergence of Symbolic Communication: Why They Should be Reversed |editor=Rudolf Botha |editor2=Chris Knight| work= The Cradle of Language|series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749| pages= 257\u2013280}}\n**{{cite book |last = Watts | first = Ian  |title=Red Ochre, Body Painting, and Language: Interpreting the Blombos Ochre |editor=Rudolf Botha |editor2=Chris Knight| work= The Cradle of Language|series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749 | pages =62\u201392}}\n*{{cite journal | doi = 10.1075/eoc.4.1.07can | last1 = Cangelosi | first1 = A. | authorlink2 = Stevan Harnad | last2 = Harnad | first2 = S. | year = 2001 | title = The adaptive advantage of symbolic theft over sensorimotor toil: Grounding language in perceptual categories | url = http://cogprints.org/2036/ | journal = Evolution of Communication | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 117\u2013142 }}\n*{{cite journal|last1=Carstairs-McCarthy|first1=Andrew|title=Language evolution: What linguists can contribute |journal=Lingua| volume=117|issue=3| year=2007| pages=503\u2013509| doi=10.1016/j.lingua.2005.07.004}}\n*{{Cite book  | last1 = Christiansen| first1 =  Morten H.|authorlink1=Morten H.

In this view, linguistics is seen as an [[Ecology |ecological]] environment for research traditions which are struggling for the same resources.<ref name=Croft_1993 /> According to [[David Hull]], these traditions correspond to species in biology. Relationships between research traditions can be [[symbiosis |symbiotic]], [[Competition (biology) |competitive]] or [[Parasitism |parasitic]]. An adaptation of Hull's theory in linguistics is proposed by [[William Croft (linguist) |William Croft]].<ref name=Croft_2008 /> He argues that the most biologically realistic tradition will prevail in the end due to its adaptative advantages.<ref name=Croft_1993 />\n\n==Approaches==\n\nEvolutionary linguistics is often divided into [[Adaptationism |functionalism]] and [[Structuralism (biology) |formalism]],<ref name=Darnell_1999>{{cite book |year=1999|editor-last1=Darnell|editor-last2=Moravcsik| editor-last3=Noonan | editor-last4=Newmeyer | editor-last5=Wheatley| title=Functionalism and Formalism in Linguistics, Vol. 1| publisher=John Benjamins |chapter= |url=  |pages=664\u2013667 |isbn=9789027298799 |access-date=}}</ref> concepts which are not to be confused with [[Structural functionalism |functionalism]] and [[Formalism (philosophy) |formalism]] in the humanistic reference.<ref name=Croft_2015>{{cite book |last=Croft |first=William |editor-last=Wright |editor-first=James | year=2015| title=International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences | chapter=Functional approaches to grammar |publisher=Elsevier |url= |pages= |isbn= 9780080970875 |access-date=}}</ref> Functional evolutionary linguistics considers languages as [[adaptation |adaptations]] to human mind.

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]] commented on 19th century evolutionary linguistics:\n{{Quote|text=\n\"Language was considered a specific sphere, a fourth natural kingdom ; this led to methods of reasoning which would have caused astonishment in other sciences. Today one cannot read a dozen lines written at that time without being struck by absurdities of reasoning and by the terminology used to justify these absurdities\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last=de Saussure|first=Ferdinand |title=Course in general linguistics |place=New York|publisher=Philosophy Library |date=1959 |orig-year=First published 1916|pages= |chapter= | url=https://monoskop.org/images/0/0b/Saussure_Ferdinand_de_Course_in_General_Linguistics_1959.pdf |isbn= 9780231157278| author-link=Ferdinand_de_Saussure}}</ref>|}}\n\n[[Mark Aronoff]] however argues that historical linguistics had its golden age during the time of Schleicher and his supporters, enjoying a place among the hard sciences, and considers the return of Darwnian linguistics as a positive development. [[Esa Itkonen]] nonetheless deems the revival of Darwinism as a hopeless enterprise:\n{{Quote|text=\n\"There is ... an application of intelligence in linguistic change which is absent in biological evolution; and this suffices to make the two domains totally disanalogous ... {{Square bracket open|1}}Grammaticalisation depends on{{Square bracket close|1}} cognitive processes, ultimately serving the goal of problem solving, which intelligent entities like humans must perform all the time, but which biological entities like genes cannot perform.

In biological evolution, mutation and selection have different sources.

Over the next years he built one of the most comprehensive recording archives for modern violin concertos.<ref>Broeker, Tobias (2004): ''Und Prokofjew ist an allem Schuld.. - \u00dcber eine Sammlung von modernen Werken f\u00fcr Violine und Orchester''. In: Forum Musikbibliothek, vol. 25, issue 3, pages 257-379</ref> The information derived from this research led to the publication of the encyclopedia ''The 20th century violin concertante'' in 2014. The book ''\"is a compendium of works that were written in and around the twentieth century featuring the violin in a solo role against an ensemble or other instrument(s). The catalogue lists compositions by composer, in alphabetical order.

Compositions that only exist in manuscript are typeset and published through his website. Publications were made in cooperation with national libraries and archives like the [[Baden State Library]], [[Saxon State and University Library Dresden]], [[Bavarian State Library]] or [[National Sz\u00e9ch\u00e9nyi Library]] and led to scores of composers like Josef Schelb, Siegfried Geissler, [[Carlos Veerhoff]] or [[Albert Siklos]].<ref>Tobias Broeker (2017): ''Die vergessenen Violinkonzerte des 20.

{"title_page": "Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed and the First International American Conference", "text_new": "==Mart\u00ed and the 1889-1890 Conference==\n[[Image:Mart\u00ed.DN100.jpeg|right|frame|Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]]\nThere was one unofficial chronicler of the [[First International American Conference]] ([[Washington, DC|Washington]], [[United States]], 1890) who was not only a brilliant writer, but also an astute political observer: the poet, hero and martyr of Cuban Independence, [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]]. During his long (1880\u20131895) exile in the United States Mart\u00ed came to know and understand his hosts well, and grew increasingly adept at interpreting their actions and words to his Latin American brothers. Mart\u00ed was an extraordinary \"bridge\" person not only between the major languages of the Hemisphere, but also across the wide cultural gap between the Anglo-Saxon and the Latin personalities and ways of being.\nAs Uruguayan consul in New York, Mart\u00ed had diplomatic status and entre to several delegations. Further, he had close personal friends in key delegations (especially the Argentine) and was a regular correspondent for several major Latin American newspapers, most notably ''[[La Naci\u00f3n]]'' of Buenos Aires. The observations he made in personal letters as well as his published writings are an invaluable complement to the formal documentary record of the Conference.\n\nMart\u00ed's comments on the Washington Conference emphasize the opportunities as well as the dangers inherent in a closer relationship between Latin America and the United States. His commentary helped forge public and official opinion in Argentina and other countries regarding the motives of the United States in calling for the meeting, and to some degree they continue to influence ambivalent Latin American attitudes towards US-led Panamericanism to this day. Finally, Mart\u00ed provides us with insights into the Conference's functioning in political, psychological, cultural and linguistic terms.\n\nes datelined New York, 2 November 1889, and published in the Buenos Aires newspaper on 19\u201320 December 1889. During the conference he also wrote the essay ''[[Nuestra Am\u00e9rica]]'' (Our America) that was published 1 of January 1891 in the New York ''Revista Ilustrada''. In the essay he stresses the threat of cultural imperialism of the United States in Latin America and develops the idea of a distinct pan-latinamerican culture. Most of his writings on the Conference have been published in book form in Buenos Aires as 'Argentina y la Primera Conferencia Panamericana'.\n\n==The \"Feel\" of the Conference==\nApart from their literary merit, Mart\u00ed's writings on the Conference have historical and political value because of the way they convey the \"feel\" of the inner workings of the numerous meetings, and the personal characteristics of the key players. Mart\u00ed refers to these inner workings as \"the entrails\": \"Las entra\u00f1as del congreso est\u00e1n como todas las entra\u00f1as, donde no se las ve\".<ref>Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, ''Argentina y la Primera Conferencia Panamericana'', edited by Dardo C\u00faneo. Buenos Aires: Ediciones Transici\u00f3n, nd, p. 81.</ref> Mart\u00ed's major contribution is to reveal these \"entrails\" to us in all their details, be they noble or petty.\n\nHis descriptions of the ambience in and out of the formal sessions are colorful and lifelike: \"But before the tour (of the U.S.) could begin the congress has been ceremoniously opened in Washington. There has already been maneuvering, intrigue, slander. The congress has a president. It has had a day of official activity. In the corridors of the Arlington (Hotel) only Spanish is heard: one delegate complains about the hotel; another politely bids farewell to an intrusive businessman; other delegates search for each other with their eyes, as if they were brothers; others, jealous, thought they could see a hidden meaning in a simple greeting...\".<ref>''Ibid'', p. 90</ref>\n\nThis first Pan-American Conference revealed a problem that has plagued inter-American diplomacy, commerce and human contact to this day: the curse of Babel. The ten members of the U.S. delegation were selected mainly for their business interest in Latin America, but none of them spoke any Spanish beyond a few social niceties.\nOf the seventeen Latin American delegates, only six spoke English, and these were mainly the delegates who held diplomatic postings in Washington at the time of the Conference. It appears that the U.S. organizers of the Conference were assuming that the delegates coming from the South would speak English, like their countrymen assigned in Washington. Most did not, and even those who did, insisted on speaking in Spanish, at least in the formal sessions, for reasons of national and cultural pride.\n\nAnd so the conference organizers, and the ad hoc secretariat, had to scramble at the last moment to find translators and interpreters. Two secretaries were named on the strength of their knowledge of both languages. Here is how Mart\u00ed describes them: \"With this the delegates began to take their seats around the conference table. The Peruvian Zegarra presides, a little nervous. On one side he has the Cuban Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Rodr\u00edguez, an expert in both languages, as well as in the art of blunting hostile harangues with skilful translation; he is also an expert in the intricacies of the law. On the other side of the presiding delegate is Fergusson, the Northamerican secretary, with his pompous moustache and Mart\u00edal voice, who grabs the Spanish he hears on the fly, and renders it into English just as he hears it, without adding any sugar or honey\".<ref>''Ibid'', p. 120</ref>\n\nThe corps of translators struggled with their monumental task of rendering each day's deliberations into both languages. Mart\u00ed notes that at the beginning the Spanish of the daily minutes was \"miserable\", but by late January 1890 was \"fluid and elegant\". The oral interpretation of speeches, especially when they became heated, was more difficult. There were, of course, no electronic facilities for simultaneous interpretation, as we would expect in any international conference today. Thus, any speech had to be interpreted consecutively into the other working language after the delegate finished. This was a lengthy and taxing process, and delegates who did speak both languages frequently would interrupt the interpreter to make corrections or points of order, further adding to the confusion. Some of the sessions became quite intense, with delegates speaking forcefully to each other. In these situations the interpreters frequently fell behind and the result was linguistic and diplomatic anarchy.\n\n==The Delegates==\nIn his contemporary published writings Mart\u00ed was fairly discreet in his descriptions of the various delegates. He was less so in his private letters to Quesada, which frequently provide less than flattering sketches of the various representatives. These 27 delegates were few enough in number, and the conference was so long (October\u2013April) that they became well known to each other and to those who, like Mart\u00ed, followed the conference closely. An even more frank description of the delegates was provided later by the first secretary of the conference, Fidel G. Sierra, in correspondence which was subsequently cited by Quesada.<ref>Samuel Guy Inman, ''Inter-American Conferences, 1826-1954: History and Problems''. Washington: The University Press, 1965, pp. 35-37.</ref>\n\nMart\u00ed was especially effusive in his description of the Argentine delegation, which was recognized by all concerned as being the most prestigious (its two chief delegates, Roque S\u00e1enz Pe\u00f1a and Manuel Quintana, later were to become Presidents of their nation). In a typical passage Mart\u00ed describes S\u00e1enz Pe\u00f1a as \"a noble elder\", and Quintana as \"a vigorous young man, striding forth as if to battle\" <ref>Mart\u00ed, ''op.cit''., pp.85-86</ref>\n\nHis characterizations of the U.S. delegates are less flattering. Emblematic of this treatment was the way Mart\u00ed presented the Secretary of State (and prime mover of the conference) to his readers. Early in  his exile in the United States Mart\u00ed had much admired [[James G. Blaine]], especially during his first tenure as Secretary in the Garfield administration in 1881, when he praised Blaine for his efforts to resolve border disputes among South American countries. But by the time of the 1889-90 conference, Mart\u00ed saw another side of Blaine: his role as leader of the annexationists and expansionists in American politics, men who argued that the U.S. ought to possess Cuba after expelling the Spaniards, and that Latin America should be the logical market for the expanding industrial base of the United States.\n\nMarti's suspicions (as well as those of many of the Latin American delegates) were fueled by the fact that most of the U.S. delegates had business or commercial backgrounds. Further, the extended six-week train trip through the United States' industrial heartland was clearly aimed at impressing the Latins with their host's commercial and economic power. As Mart\u00ed notes, the size and make-up of the U.S. delegation sometimes worked against U.S. interests: these were wealthy and independent-minded businessmen who did not necessarily agree with each other or with the Secretary of State on all matters. And so the Latin delegates were frequently confused when the ten U.S. delegates expressed highly divergent opinions and voting patterns. There were several occasions, recorded by Mart\u00ed,<ref>Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, ''Obras Completas, Volume 6: Nuestra Am\u00e9rica''. La Habana: Editorial Nacional de Cuba, 1963, pp.107, 137</ref> in which one U.S. delegate would make a motion and another of his countrymen would oppose it. There were also frequent moments when a proposal agreed to by a U.S. delegate in a committee session would be rejected by the U.S. delegation as a whole in plenary session.\n\n==The Conference and U.S.-Latin American Relations==\n\n===Concern over U.S. Hegemony===\nAlthough Mart\u00ed frequently expressed his admiration for the vitality and energy of his adopted home in exile, he was also concerned that those characteristics of the United States would lead it to dominate its southern neighbors who, he felt, were ill-equipped to resist the U.S. economic, cultural, diplomatic and even military onslaught. Mart\u00ed reported to his Hispanic audience, with some alarm, the frankly expansionist headlines carried by many U.S. newspapers regarding the Conference which stated that the purpose of the conference was to ratify the inevitable U.S. domination of the Hemisphere. He did see value in the Conference, however, as a mechanism by which the Latin Americans could show their Anglo-Saxon neighbor that they were capable of defending themselves with honor and dignity, and that the key to successful inter-American relations was that they be based on realism, knowledge of each other, and mutual respect.<ref>Mart\u00ed, ''Nuestra America'', op. cit., pp. 62-63</ref>\n\n===Pan-Americanism and \"Americanism\"===\n{{more footnotes|date=November 2014}}\nAlthough Mart\u00ed did not oppose the U.S. concept of [[Panamericanism]] as such, he was concerned that it carried with it the implicit assumption that this current of inter-American cooperation had been launched by the United States, that its first conference was being held in Washington, that its permanent secretariat would be established a short walking distance from the White House and the State Department, and that it would serve as the vehicle for U.S. commercial and diplomatic influence in the Hemisphere.\n\nTo this concept Mart\u00ed counterposed his broader notion of Americanism in terms of \"nuestra Am\u00e9rica\". Different from the U.S. concept of Pan-Americanism (and the Argentine one of an America still closely tied to Europe), Mart\u00ed's \"nuestra Am\u00e9rica\" stressed the things that made the New World different and independent from Europe. The most famous expression of this \"nuestra Am\u00e9rica\" was a speech Mart\u00ed gave at the New York \"Sociedad Literaria Hispanoamericana\" on 19 December 1889 to honor the visiting delegates of the First International American Conference. In it he paid homage to the democratic ideals of the [[founding fathers of the United States]], but his main thrust was to exalt the values of human dignity and love of liberty which he identified as belonging to all the noble sons of America.\n\n===The Issue of Cuban Independence===\nMart\u00ed was obsessed with the independence of his native land. It was, after all, the single greatest cause in his life, and the one he was ultimately martyrized for. We have noted his constant lobbying for the cause while in the United States, and he saw the 1889-90 conference as a magnificent opportunity to make his case. He was not alone: there were a number of other [[Cuban exile]]s residing in the United States like Mart\u00ed, who had learned the English language and the mysterious political ways of their hosts. Thus, they were of considerable value to the Conference's secretariat and to the various delegations, who accredited them as alternate delegates or translator/interpreters. For most of these Cuban exiles their first loyalty was to Cuba, and they too saw the utility of the Conference for their cause. However, to Mart\u00ed's dismay, many of these Cuban appointees in the conference had accepted the basic argument of the U.S. annexationists, and thus a behind the scenes battle at the conference was the struggle for influence among the Latin delegates by these two groups of Cubans. Mart\u00ed roundly condemned what he saw as treason by his countrymen: \"And they are Cubans! Cubans! who serve these interests under the cloak of ostentatious patriotism. There has never been a more cowardly thing in the annals of free peoples, nor a more cold-blooded evil.\".<ref>See Mart\u00ed's letter to Gonzalo de Quesada, 29 October 1889 in ''Obras Completas, Vol 1'', La Habana: Editorial Nacional de Cuba, 1963, pp. 247-252</ref>\n\nMart\u00ed was well aware of the strength of the annexationist movement in the United States, and he understood that a declining Spain could probably not hold out much longer on the island. Although the matter of Cuba was not on the formal agenda at the conference, Mart\u00ed knew from his inside information that Blaine and his U.S. delegates were doing their own lobbying, seeking approval among some sympathetic Latin delegates for a concerted effort to push Spain off the island and place it under U.S. protection.\n\n==Conclusions==\nDespite his many reservations, and the lack of any decisive action on the Cuban issue, Mart\u00ed felt that on balance the conference was a positive event. This view was strengthened after the defeat of Blaine's proposals on arbitration and the customs union, and the approval of less sweeping alternates proposed by the Latin American delegations. Mart\u00ed was especially impressed by the value of having key figures in Hemisphere diplomacy meet and work together for an extended period of time. Beyond the formal resolutions, Mart\u00ed observed, there were important human relationships which would result in closer ties between the diverse nations of the Hemisphere. In many ways, this was the enduring legacy of the Conference: the regular pattern of inter-American meetings at five-year intervals for many decades to come. Coupled with the establishment of a permanent secretariat, a library, and a data bank on matters pertaining to trade, commerce and transportation, the conference provided concrete instruments for consolidating Mart\u00ed's \"nuestra America\".\n\nIn following Mart\u00ed's writings from the beginning to end of the First International American Conference of 1889\u20131890, one senses a subtle change in Mart\u00ed himself. His sometimes harsh criticism of Blaine and the U.S. government becomes more muted as he realizes that the Latin Americans, standing together and working with their U.S. hosts, could forge a greater mutual understanding. For Mart\u00ed personally there was an important sequel in this world of inter-American conference diplomacy: in 1891 he was appointed Uruguay's delegate to the International Monetary Congress, which met in Washington from January to April 1891.\n\nAs he watched the delegates depart in May  1890, Mart\u00ed notes the way they have changed over the long seven months of personal and official contact:<ref>Mart\u00ed, Argentina y la Conferencia, ''op. cit.'', pp. 139-140</ref> \"They are leaving now, wiser and silent, the delegates who came from the nations of America to deal, at Washington's invitation, with American issues. The Central Americans are returning, more \"centralamerican\" than when they arrived, because when they arrived they were suspicious of each other, and now they return together as if they understood that this way of proceeding will be better for them. In the conversations all manner of things are emerging, little by little, without the caution seen in the official contacts: the curious notes, the correcting of misunderstandings, the astonishments\". Mart\u00ed quotes a U.S. delegate whom he labels \"converted\": \"Now I am convinced that I have spent my years chasing butterflies\".\n\nOne important by-product of the conference which Mart\u00ed notes as being significant was the increased respect the U.S. government now had for its Hemispheric neighbors. The easy assumption that the U.S. delegation would be able to convince their Latin American colleagues to approve resolutions giving the U.S. great advantages in matters of arbitration, customs unions and trade were demolished in the face of strong opposition. But the opposition was not simply negative reaction to the initiatives of the stronger nation: it was accompanied by counter-proposals which in the long run were accepted, albeit grudgingly, by the United States.\n\nIn the process the juridical and institutional seeds of the inter-American system were planted. It would be many years before they would come to full fruition, and indeed the problems facing the system today reflect basic differences of approach which are still unresolved. But as Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed has shown us, Ariel and Caliban came together and talked to each other in 1889\u20131890. They greatly increased their knowledge of each other in the six months of the First International American Conference. In the process they discovered that despite their differences, they shared a fundamental reality: our America.\n\nFootnotes\n<references/>\n\nReferences\n\nAbel, Christopher.

An even more frank description of the delegates was provided later by the first secretary of the conference, Fidel G. Sierra, in correspondence which was subsequently cited by Quesada.<ref>Samuel Guy Inman, ''Inter-American Conferences, 1826-1954: History and Problems''. Washington: The University Press, 1965, pp. 35-37.</ref>\n\nMart\u00ed was especially effusive in his description of the Argentine delegation, which was recognized by all concerned as being the most prestigious (its two chief delegates, Roque S\u00e1enz Pe\u00f1a and Manuel Quintana, later were to become Presidents of their nation). In a typical passage Mart\u00ed describes S\u00e1enz Pe\u00f1a as \"a noble elder\", and Quintana as \"a vigorous young man, striding forth as if to battle\" <ref>Mart\u00ed, ''op.cit''., pp.85-86</ref>\n\nHis characterizations of the U.S. delegates are less flattering. Emblematic of this treatment was the way Mart\u00ed presented the Secretary of State (and prime mover of the conference) to his readers. Early in  his exile in the United States Mart\u00ed had much admired [[James G. Blaine]], especially during his first tenure as Secretary in the Garfield administration in 1881, when he praised Blaine for his efforts to resolve border disputes among South American countries. But by the time of the 1889-90 conference, Mart\u00ed saw another side of Blaine: his role as leader of the annexationists and expansionists in American politics, men who argued that the U.S. ought to possess Cuba after expelling the Spaniards, and that Latin America should be the logical market for the expanding industrial base of the United States.\n\nMarti's suspicions (as well as those of many of the Latin American delegates) were fueled by the fact that most of the U.S. delegates had business or commercial backgrounds. Further, the extended six-week train trip through the United States' industrial heartland was clearly aimed at impressing the Latins with their host's commercial and economic power. As Mart\u00ed notes, the size and make-up of the U.S. delegation sometimes worked against U.S. interests: these were wealthy and independent-minded businessmen who did not necessarily agree with each other or with the Secretary of State on all matters. And so the Latin delegates were frequently confused when the ten U.S. delegates expressed highly divergent opinions and voting patterns. There were several occasions, recorded by Mart\u00ed,<ref>Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, ''Obras Completas, Volume 6: Nuestra Am\u00e9rica''. La Habana: Editorial Nacional de Cuba, 1963, pp.107, 137</ref> in which one U.S. delegate would make a motion and another of his countrymen would oppose it. There were also frequent moments when a proposal agreed to by a U.S. delegate in a committee session would be rejected by the U.S. delegation as a whole in plenary session.\n\n==The Conference and U.S.-Latin American Relations==\n\n===Concern over U.S. Hegemony===\nAlthough Mart\u00ed frequently expressed his admiration for the vitality and energy of his adopted home in exile, he was also concerned that those characteristics of the United States would lead it to dominate its southern neighbors who, he felt, were ill equipped to resist the U.S. economic, cultural, diplomatic and even military onslaught. Mart\u00ed reported to his Hispanic audience, with some alarm, the frankly expansionist headlines carried by many U.S. newspapers regarding the Conference which stated that the purpose of the conference was to ratify the inevitable U.S. domination of the Hemisphere. He did see value in the Conference, however, as a mechanism by which the Latin Americans could show their Anglo-Saxon neighbor that they were capable of defending themselves with honor and dignity, and that the key to successful inter-American relations was that they be based on realism, knowledge of each other, and mutual respect.<ref>Mart\u00ed, ''Nuestra America'', op. cit., pp. 62-63</ref>\n\n===Pan-Americanism and \"Americanism\"===\n{{citations|date=November 2014}}\nAlthough Mart\u00ed did not oppose the U.S. concept of [[Panamericanism]] as such, he was concerned that it carried with it the implicit assumption that this current of inter-American cooperation had been launched by the United States, that its first conference was being held in Washington, that its permanent secretariat would be established a short walking distance from the White House and the State Department, and that it would serve as the vehicle for U.S. commercial and diplomatic influence in the Hemisphere.\n\nTo this concept Mart\u00ed counterposed his broader notion of Americanism in terms of \"nuestra Am\u00e9rica\". Different from the U.S. concept of Pan-Americanism (and the Argentine one of an America still closely tied to Europe), Mart\u00ed's \"nuestra Am\u00e9rica\" stressed the things that made the New World different and independent from Europe. The most famous expression of this \"nuestra Am\u00e9rica\" was a speech Mart\u00ed gave at the New York \"Sociedad Literaria Hispanoamericana\" on 19 December 1889 to honor the visiting delegates of the First International American Conference. In it he paid homage to the democratic ideals of the [[founding fathers of the United States]], but his main thrust was to exalt the values of human dignity and love of liberty which he identified as belonging to all the noble sons of America.\n\n===The Issue of Cuban Independence===\nMart\u00ed was obsessed with the independence of his native land. It was, after all, the single greatest cause in his life, and the one he was ultimately martyrized for. We have noted his constant lobbying for the cause while in the United States, and he saw the 1889-90 conference as a magnificent opportunity to make his case. He was not alone: there were a number of other [[Cuban exile]]s residing in the United States like Mart\u00ed, who had learned the English language and the mysterious political ways of their hosts. Thus, they were of considerable value to the Conference's secretariat and to the various delegations, who accredited them as alternate delegates or translator/interpreters. For most of these Cuban exiles their first loyalty was to Cuba, and they too saw the utility of the Conference for their cause. However, to Mart\u00ed's dismay, many of these Cuban appointees in the conference had accepted the basic argument of the U.S. annexationists, and thus a behind the scenes battle at the conference was the struggle for influence among the Latin delegates by these two groups of Cubans. Mart\u00ed roundly condemned what he saw as treason by his countrymen: \"And they are Cubans! Cubans! who serve these interests under the cloak of ostentatious patriotism. There has never been a more cowardly thing in the annals of free peoples, nor a more cold-blooded evil.\".<ref>See Mart\u00ed's letter to Gonzalo de Quesada, 29 October 1889 in ''Obras Completas, Vol 1'', La Habana: Editorial Nacional de Cuba, 1963, pp. 247-252</ref>\n\nMart\u00ed was well aware of the strength of the annexationist movement in the United States, and he understood that a declining Spain could probably not hold out much longer on the island. Although the matter of Cuba was not on the formal agenda at the conference, Mart\u00ed knew from his inside information that Blaine and his U.S. delegates were doing their own lobbying, seeking approval among some sympathetic Latin delegates for a concerted effort to push Spain off the island and place it under U.S. protection.\n\n==Conclusions==\nDespite his many reservations, and the lack of any decisive action on the Cuban issue, Mart\u00ed felt that on balance the conference was a positive event. This view was strengthened after the defeat of Blaine's proposals on arbitration and the customs union, and the approval of less sweeping alternates proposed by the Latin American delegations. Mart\u00ed was especially impressed by the value of having key figures in Hemisphere diplomacy meet and work together for an extended period of time. Beyond the formal resolutions, Mart\u00ed observed, there were important human relationships which would result in closer ties between the diverse nations of the Hemisphere. In many ways, this was the enduring legacy of the Conference: the regular pattern of inter-American meetings at five-year intervals for many decades to come. Coupled with the establishment of a permanent secretariat, a library, and a data bank on matters pertaining to trade, commerce and transportation, the conference provided concrete instruments for consolidating Mart\u00ed's \"nuestra America\".\n\nIn following Mart\u00ed's writings from the beginning to end of the First International American Conference of 1889-1890, one senses a subtle change in Mart\u00ed himself. His sometimes harsh criticism of Blaine and the U.S. government becomes more muted as he realizes that the Latin Americans, standing together and working with their U.S. hosts, could forge a greater mutual understanding. For Mart\u00ed personally there was an important sequel in this world of inter-American conference diplomacy: in 1891 he was appointed Uruguay's delegate to the International Monetary Congress, which met in Washington from January to April 1891.\n\nAs he watched the delegates depart in May  1890, Mart\u00ed notes the way they have changed over the long seven months of personal and official contact:<ref>Mart\u00ed, Argentina y la Conferencia, ''op. cit.'', pp. 139-140</ref> \"They are leaving now, wiser and silent, the delegates who came from the nations of America to deal, at Washington's invitation, with American issues. The Central Americans are returning, more \"centralamerican\" than when they arrived, because when they arrived they were suspicious of each other, and now they return together as if they understood that this way of proceeding will be better for them. In the conversations all manner of things are emerging, little by little, without the caution seen in the official contacts: the curious notes, the correcting of misunderstandings, the astonishments\". Mart\u00ed quotes a U.S. delegate whom he labels \"converted\": \"Now I am convinced that I have spent my years chasing butterflies\".\n\nOne important by-product of the conference which Mart\u00ed notes as being significant was the increased respect the U.S. government now had for its Hemispheric neighbors. The easy assumption that the U.S. delegation would be able to convince their Latin American colleagues to approve resolutions giving the U.S. great advantages in matters of arbitration, customs unions and trade were demolished in the face of strong opposition. But the opposition was not simply negative reaction to the initiatives of the stronger nation: it was accompanied by counter-proposals which in the long run were accepted, albeit grudgingly, by the United States.\n\nIn the process the juridical and institutional seeds of the inter-American system were planted. It would be many years before they would come to full fruition, and indeed the problems facing the system today reflect basic differences of approach which are still unresolved. But as Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed has shown us, Ariel and Caliban came together and talked to each other in 1889-1890. They greatly increased their knowledge of each other in the six months of the First International American Conference. In the process they discovered that despite their differences, they shared a fundamental reality: our America.\n\nFootnotes\n<references/>\n\nReferences\n\nAbel, Christopher.

{"title_page": "Overlapping markup", "text_new": "In [[markup language]]s and the [[digital humanities]], '''overlap''' occurs when a document has two or more structures that interact in a non-[[hierarchical]] manner.\nA document with overlapping markup cannot be represented as a [[tree (graph)|tree]].\nThis is also known as '''concurrent markup'''.\nOverlap happens, for instance, in [[poetry]], where there may be a [[meter (poetry)|metrical]] structure of [[foot (prosody)|feet]] and lines; a linguistic structure of sentences and quotations; and a physical structure of volumes and pages and editorial annotations.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=The problem types}}\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Frankenstein.1831.inside-cover.jpg|thumb|right|The structural differences between multiple editions of ''[[Frankenstein]]'' have been analysed with overlapping techniques.{{sfn|Piez|2014}}]]\n\nThe problem of non-hierarchical structures in documents has been recognised since 1988; resolving it against the dominant paradigm of text as a single hierarchy (an ''ordered hierarchy of content objects'' or ''OHCO'') was initially thought to be merely a technical issue, but has, in fact, proven much more difficult.{{sfn|Renear|Mylonas|Durand|1993}}\nIn 2008, [[Jeni Tennison]] identified markup overlap as \"the main remaining problem area for markup technologists\".{{sfn|Tennison|2008}}\nMarkup overlap continues to be a primary issue in the digital study of theological texts in 2019, and is a major reason for the field retaining specialised markup formats&mdash;the [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] and the [[Theological Markup Language]]&mdash;rather than the inter-operable [[Text Encoding Initiative]]-based formats common to the rest of the [[digital humanities]].{{sfn|MoChridhe|2019}}\n\n== Properties and types ==\n\nA distinction exists between schemes that allow non-contiguous overlap, and those that allow only contiguous overlap. Often, 'markup overlap' strictly means the latter.\nContiguous overlap can always be represented as a linear document with milestones (typically co-indexed start- and end-markers), without the need for fragmenting a (logical) component into multiple physical ones. Non-contiguous overlap may require document fragmentation. Another distinction in overlapping markup schemes is whether elements can overlap with other elements of the same kind (''self-overlap'').{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=The problem types}}\n\nA scheme may have a ''privileged'' hierarchy.\nSome [[XML]]-based schemes, for example, represent one hierarchy directly in the XML document tree, and represent other, overlapping, structures by another means;\nthese are said to be ''non-privileged''.\n\n{{harvtxt|Schmidt|2012}} identifies a tripartite classification of instances of overlap: 1. \"Variation of content and structure\", 2. \"Overlay of multiple  perspectives or markup sets\", and 3. \"Overlap of individual start and end tags within a single markup perspective\";\nadditionally, some apparent instances of overlap are in fact schema definition problems, which can be resolved hierarchically.\nHe contends that type 1 is best resolved by a system of multiple documents external to the markup, but types 2 and 3 require dealing with internally.\n\n== Approaches and implementations ==\n\n{{harvtxt|DeRose|2004|loc=Evaluation criteria}} identifies several criteria for judging solutions to the overlap problem: \n* readability and maintainability, \n* tool support and compatibility with XML, \n* possible validation schemes, and \n* ease of processing.\n\n[[Tag soup]] is, strictly speaking, not overlapping markup\u2014it is malformed [[HTML]], which is a non-overlapping language, and may be ill-defined.\nSome [[web browsers]] attempted to represent overlapping start and end tags with non-hierarchical [[Document Object Model]]s (DOM), but this was not standardised across all browsers and was incompatible with the innately hierarchical nature of the DOM.{{sfn|Hickson|2002}}{{sfn|Sivonen|2003}}\n[[HTML5]] defines how processors should deal with such mis-nested markup in the HTML syntax and turn it into a single hierarchy.{{sfn|HTML|loc = [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#an-introduction-to-error-handling-and-strange-cases-in-the-parser \u00a7 8.2.8 An introduction to error handling and strange cases in the parser]}}\nWith [[XHTML]] and [[SGML]]-based HTML, however, mis-nested markup is a strict error and makes processing by standards-compliant systems impossible.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.1. Non-SGML Notations}}\nThe HTML standard defines a [[paragraph]] concept which can cause overlap with other elements and can be non-contiguous.{{sfn|HTML|loc = [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#paragraphs \u00a7 3.2.5.4 Paragraphs]}}\n\n[[SGML]], which early versions of HTML were based on, has a feature called CONCUR that allows multiple independent hierarchies to co-exist without privileging any.\n[[Document type definition|DTD]] validation is only defined for each individual hierarchy with CONCUR. Validation across hierarchies is not defined by the standard. CONCUR cannot support self-overlap, and it interacts poorly with some of SGML's abbreviatory features.\nThis feature has been poorly supported by tools and has seen very little actual use;\nusing CONCUR to represent document overlap was not a recommended use case, according to a commentary by the standard's editor.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.2. CONCUR}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=SGML CONCUR}}\n\n=== Within hierarchical languages ===\n\nThere are several approaches to representing overlap in a non-overlapping language.{{sfn|Di Iorio|Peroni|Vitali|2009}}\nThe [[Text Encoding Initiative]], as an XML-based markup scheme, cannot directly represent overlapping markup.\nAll four of the below approaches are suggested.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc = [https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html \u00a7 20 Non-hierarchical Structures]}}\nThe [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] is another XML-based scheme, designed to mark up the [[Bible]].\nIt uses empty milestone elements to encode non-privileged components.{{sfn|Durusau|2006}}\n\nTo illustrate these approaches, marking up the sentences and lines of a fragment of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] will be used as a running example. Where there is a privileged hierarchy, the lines will be used.\n\n==== Multiple documents ====\n''Multiple documents'' can each provide different internally consistent hierarchies. The advantage of this approach is that each document is simple and can be processed with existing tools, but requires maintenance of redundant content and it can be difficult to cross-reference between different views.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHME \u00a7 20.1 Multiple Encodings of the Same Information]}} With multiple documents, the overlap can be analysed with [[data comparison]] and [[delta encoding]] techniques, and, in an XML context, specific XML tree differencing algorithms are available.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009}}{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016}}\n\n{{harvtxt|Schmidt|2012|loc=3.5 Variation}} recommends this approach for encoding multiple variants of a single text and to accept the duplication of the parts which do not vary, rather than attempting to create a structure that represents all of the variation present;\nfurther, he suggests that this alignment be performed automatically, and that misalignment is rare in practice.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=4.1 Automating Variation}}\n\nExample, with lines marked up:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line>I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</line>\n  <line>Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</line>\n  <line>So much for that.\u2014The silent hours steal on,</line>\n  <line>And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</line>\n</source>\n\nWith sentences marked up:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <sentence>I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,\n  Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</sentence>\n  <sentence>So much for that.</sentence><sentence>\u2014The silent hours steal on,\n  And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</sentence>\n</source>\n\n==== Milestones ====\n''Milestones'' are empty elements that mark the beginning and end of a component. These can be used to embed a non-privileged structure within a hierarchical language, and can only represent contiguous overlap. Existing tools will also not understand the meaning of the milestone elements and so cannot easily process or validate the non-privileged structure.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHBM \u00a7 20.2 Boundary Marking with Empty Elements]}}{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.4. Milestones}} The markup being near the content is an advantage for maintainability and readability.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=TEI-style milestones}} [[CLIX (markup)|CLIX]] {{harv|DeRose|2004}} is an example of such an approach.\n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line><sentence-start />I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</line>\n  <line>Who prays continually for Richmond's good.<sentence-end /></line>\n  <line><sentence-start />So much for that.<sentence-end /><sentence-start />\u2014The silent hours steal on,</line>\n  <line>And flaky darkness breaks within the east.<sentence-end /></line>\n</source>\n\n[[Punctuation]] and [[Space (punctuation)|spaces]] have been identified as a type of milestone-style 'crypto-overlap' or 'pseudo-markup', as the boundaries of words, clauses, sentences and the like do not necessarily align with the formal markup boundaries hierarchically.{{sfn|Birnbaum|Thorsen|2015}}{{sfn|Haentjens Dekker|Birnbaum|2017}}\n\n==== Joins ====\n''Joins'' are pointers within a privileged hierarchy to other components of the privileged hierarchy, which may be used to reconstruct a non-privileged component akin to following a [[linked list]]. A single non-privileged element is ''segmented'' into several ''partial'' elements within the privileged hierarchy; the partial elements themselves do not represent a single unit in the non-privileged hierarchy, which can be misleading and make processing difficult.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHVE \u00a7 20.3 Fragmentation and Reconstitution of Virtual Elements]}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=Segmentation}} While this approach can support some discontiguous structures, it is not able to re-order elements.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.5. Fragmentation}} A slightly different approach can, however, express re-ordering by expressing the join away from the content, at the cost of directness and maintainability.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=Joins}}\n\nJoin-based representations can introduce the possibility of cycles between elements; detecting and rejecting these adds complexity to implementations.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=3.4 Interlinking}}\n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line><sentence id=\"a\">I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence continues=\"a\">Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence id=\"b\">So much for that.</sentence><sentence id=\"c\">\u2014The silent hours steal on,</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence continues=\"c\">And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</sentence></line>\n</source>\n\n==== Stand-off markup ====\n''Stand-off markup'' is similar to using joins, except that there is no privileged hierarchy: each part of the document is given a label (or might be referred to by an offset), and the document is constructed by pointing to the content from markup that 'stands off' from the content (possibly in an entirely different file), and might contain no content itself. The TEI guidelines identify the unity of the elements as a primary advantage of stand-off markup over joins, in addition to the ability to produce and distribute the annotations separately from the text, possibly even by different authors applying markup to a read-only document,{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc= [https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHSO \u00a7 20.4 Stand-off Markup]}} allowing collaborative approaches to markup by a [[wikt:divide and conquer|divide and conquer]] strategy.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=4.2 Markup Outside the Text}}\n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <span id=\"a\">I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</span>\n  <span id=\"b\">Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</span>\n  <span id=\"c\">So much for that.</span><span id=\"d\">\u2014The silent hours steal on,</span>\n  <span id=\"e\">And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</span>\n  ...\n  <line contents=\"a\" />\n  <line contents=\"b\" />\n  <line contents=\"c d\" />\n  <line contents=\"e\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"a b\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"c\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"d e\" />\n</source>\n\nIt has been claimed that separating markup and text can result in overall simplification and increased maintainability,{{sfn|Eggert|Schmidt|2019|loc=Conclusion}} and by 2017, ``[t]he current state of the art to [represent] (...) linguistically annotated data is to use a graph-based representation serialized as standoff XML as a pivot format\u00b4\u00b4 {{sfn|Ide|Chiarcos|Stede|Cassidy|2017|loc=p.99}}, i.e., that standoff was the most widely accepted approach to address the overlapping markup challenge.\n\nStandoff formalisms have been the basis for an ISO standard for linguistic annotation <ref>https://www.iso.org/standard/37326.html</ref>, they have been successfully applied for developing corpus management systems,{{sfn|Chiarcos|Dipper|G\u00f6tze|Leser|L\u00fcdeling|Ritz|Stede|2008|}} and (as of April 2020) they are actively being developed in the TEI.<ref>https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1745</ref> \n\n==== Challenges ====\n\nRepresenting overlapping markup within hierarchical languages is challenging, for reasons of redundancy and/or complexity. In the 2000s to 2010s, standoff formalisms were generally accepted as the most promising approach here {{sfn|Ide|Chiarcos|Stede|Cassidy|2017|loc=p.99}}, but a disadvantage of standoff is that validation is very challenging.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.6. Standoff Markup}} \nStandoff formalisms are not natively supported by database management systems, so that (by 2017) it was suggested to ``use ... standoff XML as a pivot format (...) and relational data bases for querying.\u00b4\u00b4{{sfn|Ide|Chiarcos|Stede|Cassidy|2017|loc=p.99}} In practical applications, this requires complicated architectures and/or labor-intense transformation between pivot format and internal representation. As a result, maintenance is problematic.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|log=Standoff markup}} This has been a motivation to develop corpus management systems on the basis of graph data bases and for using established graph-based formalisms as pivot formats.\n\n=== Special-purpose languages ===\n\nFor implementing the above-mentioned strategies, either existing markup languages (such as the TEI) can be extended or special-purpose languages can be designed. To design an entirely new markup language allow to forego the tool support in existing languages for a less complicated semantic model and more convenient syntax.\n\n==== Historical formalisms ====\n* [[LMNL]] is a non-hierarchical markup language first described in 2002 by [[Jeni Tennison]] and [[Wendell Piez]], annotating ranges of a document with properties and allowing self-overlap. [[CLIX (markup)|CLIX]], which originally stood for 'Canonical LMNL In XML', provides a method for representing any LMNL document in a milestone-style XML document.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=CLIX and LMNL}} It also has another XML serialisation, xLMNL.{{sfn|Piez|2012}}\n* [[MECS]] was developed by the [[University of Bergen]]'s [[Wittgenstein Archive]]. However, it had several problems: it allowed some non-sensical documents of overlapping elements, it could not support self-overlap, and it did not have the capacity to define a DTD-like grammar.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.7. MECS}} The theory of [[General Ordered-Descendant Directed Acyclic Graph]]s (GODDAGs), while not strictly a markup language itself, is a general data model for non-hierarchical markup. ''Restricted GODDAGs'' were designed specifically to match the semantics of MECS; general GODDAGs may be non-contiguous and need a more powerful language.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000}} [[TexMECS]] is a successor to MECS, which has a formal grammar and is designed to represent every GODDAG and nothing that is not a GODDAG.{{sfn|Huitfeldt|Sperberg-McQueen|2003}}\n* [[XCONCUR]] (previously MuLaX) is a melding-together of XML and SGML's CONCUR, and also contains a validation language, XCONCUR-CL, and a [[Simple API for XML|SAX]]-like API.{{sfn|Hilbert|Schonefeld|Witt|2005}}{{sfn|Witt|Schonefeld|Rehm|Khoo|2007}}{{sfn|Schonefeld|2008}}\n* Marinelli, Vitali and Zacchiroli provide algorithms to convert between restricted GODDAGs, ECLIX, LMNL, parallel documents in XML, contiguous stand-off markup and TexMECS.{{sfn|Marinelli|Vitali|Zacchiroli|2008}}\n\nNone of these formalisms seem to be maintained anymore. Consensus community seems to be to employ standoff XML or graph-based formalisms.\n\n==== Actively maintained standoff XML languages ====\n\n* GrAF-XML,<ref>https://sourceforge.net/projects/iso-graf/</ref> standoff-XML serialization of the Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF)<ref>https://www.iso.org/standard/37326.html</ref>, used, e.g., for the American National Corpus<ref>http://www.anc.org/</ref>\n* PAULA-XML,<ref>https://www.sfb632.uni-potsdam.de/en/paula.html</ref> standoff-XML serialization of the data model underlying the corpus management system ANNIS and the converter suite SALT<ref>https://corpus-tools.org/salt/</ref>\n* NAF (NLP Annotation Format / Newsreader Annotation Format),<ref>https://github.com/newsreader/NAF</ref>, standoff XML format originally developed in the NewsReader project (FP7, 2013-2015 <ref>https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/316404</ref>), currently used by NLP tools such as FreeLing<ref>http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/</ref> (with support for English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, German, Russian, Catalan, Galician, Croatian, Slovene, etc.), and EusTagger <ref>http://www.hitz.eus/en/nlp</ref> (with support for Basque, English, Spanish).\n\n=== Graph-based formalisms ===\n\nRather than grounding markup information in a tree, standoff XML employs a data model based on directed graphs.{{sfn|Ide|Suderman|2007}}\nAs an alternative to traditional markup, such graph-based data models can be represented with formalisms originally developed for generalised directed [[multigraph]]s, most notably the [[Resource Description Framework|Resource Description Framework (RDF)]].{{sfn|Cassidy|2010|log=cassidy}}{{sfn|Chiarcos|2012|log=POWLA}}\nEARMARK is an early [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]/[[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] representation that encompasses GODDAGs.{{sfn|Di Iorio|Peroni|Vitali|2009}}\n\nRDF provides different linearisations, including an XML format that can be modeled to mirror conventional standoff XML, and a linearization that lets RDF be expressed in XML attributes ([[RDFa]]). But while it is semantically equivalent to standoff XML, it does not require special-purpose technology for storing, parsing and querying. Multiple interlinked RDF files representing a document or a corpus may constitute an example of [[Linguistic Linked Open Data]].\n\nEggert & Schmidt describe encoding a corpus (the [[Charles Harpur Critical Archive]]) using 'multi-version documents' (MVD) to represent the variant versions of documents and as a means of indicating additions, deletions and revisions using a tactical combination of multiple documents and stand-off ranges within an underlying graph-based model. MVD is presented as an application file format, requiring specialised tools to view or edit.{{sfn|Eggert|Schmidt|2019}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n* {{ cite conference\n

'''overlap''' occurs when a document has two or more structures that interact in a non-[[hierarchical]] manner.\nA document with overlapping markup cannot be represented as a [[tree (graph)|tree]].\nThis is also known as '''concurrent markup'''.\nOverlap happens, for instance, in [[poetry]], where there may be a [[meter (poetry)|metrical]] structure of [[foot (prosody)|feet]] and lines; a linguistic structure of sentences and quotations; and a physical structure of volumes and pages and editorial annotations.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=The problem types}}\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Frankenstein.1831.inside-cover.jpg|thumb|right|The structural differences between multiple editions of ''[[Frankenstein]]'' have been analysed with overlapping techniques.{{sfn|Piez|2014}}]]\n\nThe problem of non-hierarchical structures in documents has been recognised since 1988; resolving it against the dominant paradigm of text as a single hierarchy (an ''ordered hierarchy of content objects'' or ''OHCO'') was initially thought to be merely a technical issue, but has, in fact, proven much more difficult.{{sfn|Renear|Mylonas|Durand|1993}}\nIn 2008, [[Jeni Tennison]] identified markup overlap as \"the main remaining problem area for markup technologists\".{{sfn|Tennison|2008}}\nMarkup overlap continues to be a primary issue in the digital study of theological texts in 2019, and is a major reason for the field retaining specialised markup formats&mdash;the [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] and the [[Theological Markup Language]]&mdash;rather than the inter-operable [[Text Encoding Initiative]]-based formats common to the rest of the [[digital humanities]].{{sfn|MoChridhe|2019}}\n\n== Properties and types ==\n\nA distinction exists between schemes that allow non-contiguous overlap, and those that allow only contiguous overlap. Often, 'markup overlap' strictly means the latter.\nContiguous overlap can always be represented as a linear document with milestones (typically co-indexed start- and end-markers), without the need for fragmenting a (logical) component into multiple physical ones. Non-contiguous overlap may require document fragmentation. Another distinction in overlapping markup schemes is whether elements can overlap with other elements of the same kind (''self-overlap'').{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=The problem types}}\n\nA scheme may have a ''privileged'' hierarchy.\nSome [[XML]]-based schemes, for example, represent one hierarchy directly in the XML document tree, and represent other, overlapping, structures by another means;\nthese are said to be ''non-privileged''.\n\n{{harvtxt|Schmidt|2012}} identifies a tripartite classification of instances of overlap: 1. \"Variation of content and structure\", 2. \"Overlay of multiple  perspectives or markup sets\", and 3. \"Overlap of individual start and end tags within a single markup perspective\";\nadditionally, some apparent instances of overlap are in fact schema definition problems, which can be resolved hierarchically.\nHe contends that type 1 is best resolved by a system of multiple documents external to the markup, but types 2 and 3 require dealing with internally.\n\n== Approaches and implementations ==\n\n{{harvtxt|DeRose|2004|loc=Evaluation criteria}} identifies several criteria for judging solutions to the overlap problem: \n* readability and maintainability, \n* tool support and compatibility with XML, \n* possible validation schemes, and \n* ease of processing.\n\n[[Tag soup]] is, strictly speaking, not overlapping markup\u2014it is malformed [[HTML]], which is a non-overlapping language, and may be ill-defined.\nSome [[web browsers]] attempted to represent overlapping start and end tags with non-hierarchical [[Document Object Model]]s (DOM), but this was not standardised across all browsers and was incompatible with the innately hierarchical nature of the DOM.{{sfn|Hickson|2002}}{{sfn|Sivonen|2003}}\n[[HTML5]] defines how processors should deal with such mis-nested markup in the HTML syntax and turn it into a single hierarchy.{{sfn|HTML|loc = [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#an-introduction-to-error-handling-and-strange-cases-in-the-parser \u00a7 8.2.8 An introduction to error handling and strange cases in the parser]}}\nWith [[XHTML]] and [[SGML]]-based HTML, however, mis-nested markup is a strict error and makes processing by standards-compliant systems impossible.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.1. Non-SGML Notations}}\nThe HTML standard defines a [[paragraph]] concept which can cause overlap with other elements and can be non-contiguous.{{sfn|HTML|loc = [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#paragraphs \u00a7 3.2.5.4 Paragraphs]}}\n\n[[SGML]], which early versions of HTML were based on, has a feature called CONCUR that allows multiple independent hierarchies to co-exist without privileging any.\n[[Document type definition|DTD]] validation is only defined for each individual hierarchy with CONCUR. Validation across hierarchies is not defined by the standard. CONCUR cannot support self-overlap, and it interacts poorly with some of SGML's abbreviatory features.\nThis feature has been poorly supported by tools and has seen very little actual use;\nusing CONCUR to represent document overlap was not a recommended use case, according to a commentary by the standard's editor.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.2. CONCUR}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=SGML CONCUR}}\n\n=== Within hierarchical languages ===\n\nThere are several approaches to representing overlap in a non-overlapping language.{{sfn|Di Iorio|Peroni|Vitali|2009}}\nThe [[Text Encoding Initiative]], as an XML-based markup scheme, cannot directly represent overlapping markup.\nAll four of the below approaches are suggested.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc = [https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html \u00a7 20 Non-hierarchical Structures]}}\nThe [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] is another XML-based scheme, designed to mark up the [[Bible]].\nIt uses empty milestone elements to encode non-privileged components.{{sfn|Durusau|2006}}\n\nTo illustrate these approaches, marking up the sentences and lines of a fragment of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] will be used as a running example. Where there is a privileged hierarchy, the lines will be used.\n\n==== Multiple documents ====\n''Multiple documents'' can each provide different internally consistent hierarchies. The advantage of this approach is that each document is simple and can be processed with existing tools, but requires maintenance of redundant content and it can be difficult to cross-reference between different views.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHME \u00a7 20.1 Multiple Encodings of the Same Information]}} With multiple documents, the overlap can be analysed with [[data comparison]] and [[delta encoding]] techniques, and, in an XML context, specific XML tree differencing algorithms are available.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009}}{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016}}\n\n{{harvtxt|Schmidt|2012|loc=3.5 Variation}} recommends this approach for encoding multiple variants of a single text and to accept the duplication of the parts which do not vary, rather than attempting to create a structure that represents all of the variation present;\nfurther, he suggests that this alignment be performed automatically, and that misalignment is rare in practice.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=4.1 Automating Variation}}\n\nExample, with lines marked up:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line>I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</line>\n  <line>Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</line>\n  <line>So much for that.\u2014The silent hours steal on,</line>\n  <line>And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</line>\n</source>\n\nWith sentences marked up:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <sentence>I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,\n  Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</sentence>\n  <sentence>So much for that.</sentence><sentence>\u2014The silent hours steal on,\n  And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</sentence>\n</source>\n\n==== Milestones ====\n''Milestones'' are empty elements that mark the beginning and end of a component. These can be used to embed a non-privileged structure within a hierarchical language, and can only represent contiguous overlap. Existing tools will also not understand the meaning of the milestone elements and so cannot easily process or validate the non-privileged structure.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHBM \u00a7 20.2 Boundary Marking with Empty Elements]}}{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.4. Milestones}} The markup being near the content is an advantage for maintainability and readability.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=TEI-style milestones}} [[CLIX (markup)|CLIX]] {{harv|DeRose|2004}} is an example of such an approach.\n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line><sentence-start />I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</line>\n  <line>Who prays continually for Richmond's good.<sentence-end /></line>\n  <line><sentence-start />So much for that.<sentence-end /><sentence-start />\u2014The silent hours steal on,</line>\n  <line>And flaky darkness breaks within the east.<sentence-end /></line>\n</source>\n\n[[Punctuation]] and [[Space (punctuation)|spaces]] have been identified as a type of milestone-style 'crypto-overlap' or 'pseudo-markup', as the boundaries of words, clauses, sentences and the like do not necessarily align with the formal markup boundaries hierarchically.{{sfn|Birnbaum|Thorsen|2015}}{{sfn|Haentjens Dekker|Birnbaum|2017}}\n\n==== Joins ====\n''Joins'' are pointers within a privileged hierarchy to other components of the privileged hierarchy, which may be used to reconstruct a non-privileged component akin to following a [[linked list]]. A single non-privileged element is ''segmented'' into several ''partial'' elements within the privileged hierarchy; the partial elements themselves do not represent a single unit in the non-privileged hierarchy, which can be misleading and make processing difficult.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHVE \u00a7 20.3 Fragmentation and Reconstitution of Virtual Elements]}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=Segmentation}} While this approach can support some discontiguous structures, it is not able to re-order elements.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.5. Fragmentation}} A slightly different approach can, however, express re-ordering by expressing the join away from the content, at the cost of directness and maintainability.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=Joins}}\n\nJoin-based representations can introduce the possibility of cycles between elements; detecting and rejecting these adds complexity to implementations.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=3.4 Interlinking}}\n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line><sentence id=\"a\">I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence continues=\"a\">Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence id=\"b\">So much for that.</sentence><sentence id=\"c\">\u2014The silent hours steal on,</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence continues=\"c\">And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</sentence></line>\n</source>\n\n==== Stand-off markup ====\n''Stand-off markup'' is similar to using joins, except that there is no privileged hierarchy: each part of the document is given a label (or might be referred to by an offset), and the document is constructed by pointing to the content from markup that 'stands off' from the content (possibly in an entirely different file), and might contain no content itself. The TEI guidelines identify the unity of the elements as a primary advantage of stand-off markup over joins, in addition to the ability to produce and distribute the annotations separately from the text, possibly even by different authors applying markup to a read-only document,{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc= [https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHSO \u00a7 20.4 Stand-off Markup]}} allowing collaborative approaches to markup by a [[wikt:divide and conquer|divide and conquer]] strategy.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=4.2 Markup Outside the Text}}\n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <span id=\"a\">I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</span>\n  <span id=\"b\">Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</span>\n  <span id=\"c\">So much for that.</span><span id=\"d\">\u2014The silent hours steal on,</span>\n  <span id=\"e\">And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</span>\n  ...\n  <line contents=\"a\" />\n  <line contents=\"b\" />\n  <line contents=\"c d\" />\n  <line contents=\"e\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"a b\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"c\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"d e\" />\n</source>\n\nIt has been claimed that separating markup and text can result in overall simplification and increased maintainability,{{sfn|Eggert|Schmidt|2019|loc=Conclusion}} and by 2017, ``[t]he current state of the art to [represent] (...) linguistically annotated data is to use a graph-based representation serialized as standoff XML as a pivot format\u00b4\u00b4 {{sfn|Ide|Chiarcos|Stede|Cassidy|2017|loc=p.99}}, i.e., that standoff was the most widely accepted approach to address the overlapping markup challenge.\n\nStandoff formalisms have been the basis for an ISO standard for linguistic annotation <ref>https://www.iso.org/standard/37326.html</ref>, they have been successfully applied for developing corpus management systems,{{sfn|Chiarcos|Dipper|G\u00f6tze|Leser|L\u00fcdeling|Ritz|Stede|2008|}} and (as of April 2020) they are actively being developed in the TEI.<ref>https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1745</ref> \n\n==== Challenges ====\n\nRepresenting overlapping markup within hierarchical languages is challenging, for reasons of redundancy and/or complexity. In the 2000s to 2010s, standoff formalisms were generally accepted as the most promising approach here {{sfn|Ide|Chiarcos|Stede|Cassidy|2017|loc=p.99}}, but a disadvantage of standoff is that validation is very challenging.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.6. Standoff Markup}} \nStandoff formalisms are not natively supported by database management systems, so that (by 2017) it was suggested to ``use ... standoff XML as a pivot format (...) and relational data bases for querying.\u00b4\u00b4{{sfn|Ide|Chiarcos|Stede|Cassidy|2017|loc=p.99}} In practical applications, this requires complicated architectures and/or labor-intense transformation between pivot format and internal representation. As a result, maintenance is problematic.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|log=Standoff markup}} This has been a motivation to develop corpus management systems on the basis of graph data bases and for using established graph-based formalisms as pivot formats.\n\n=== Special-purpose languages ===\n\nFor implementing the above-mentioned strategies, either existing markup languages (such as the TEI) can be extended or special-purpose languages can be designed. To design an entirely new markup language allow to forego the tool support in existing languages for a less complicated semantic model and more convenient syntax.\n\n==== Historical formalisms ====\n* [[LMNL]] is a non-hierarchical markup language first described in 2002 by [[Jeni Tennison]] and [[Wendell Piez]], annotating ranges of a document with properties and allowing self-overlap. [[CLIX (markup)|CLIX]], which originally stood for 'Canonical LMNL In XML', provides a method for representing any LMNL document in a milestone-style XML document.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=CLIX and LMNL}} It also has another XML serialisation, xLMNL.{{sfn|Piez|2012}}\n* [[MECS]] was developed by the [[University of Bergen]]'s [[Wittgenstein Archive]]. However, it had several problems: it allowed some non-sensical documents of overlapping elements, it could not support self-overlap, and it did not have the capacity to define a DTD-like grammar.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.7. MECS}} The theory of [[General Ordered-Descendant Directed Acyclic Graph]]s (GODDAGs), while not strictly a markup language itself, is a general data model for non-hierarchical markup. ''Restricted GODDAGs'' were designed specifically to match the semantics of MECS; general GODDAGs may be non-contiguous and need a more powerful language.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000}} [[TexMECS]] is a successor to MECS, which has a formal grammar and is designed to represent every GODDAG and nothing that is not a GODDAG.{{sfn|Huitfeldt|Sperberg-McQueen|2003}}\n* [[XCONCUR]] (previously MuLaX) is a melding-together of XML and SGML's CONCUR, and also contains a validation language, XCONCUR-CL, and a [[Simple API for XML|SAX]]-like API.{{sfn|Hilbert|Schonefeld|Witt|2005}}{{sfn|Witt|Schonefeld|Rehm|Khoo|2007}}{{sfn|Schonefeld|2008}}\n* Marinelli, Vitali and Zacchiroli provide algorithms to convert between restricted GODDAGs, ECLIX, LMNL, parallel documents in XML, contiguous stand-off markup and TexMECS.{{sfn|Marinelli|Vitali|Zacchiroli|2008}}\n\nNone of these formalisms seem to be maintained anymore. Consensus community seems to be to employ standoff XML or graph-based formalisms.\n\n==== Actively maintained standoff XML languages ====\n\n* GrAF-XML,<ref>https://sourceforge.net/projects/iso-graf/</ref> standoff-XML serialization of the Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF)<ref>https://www.iso.org/standard/37326.html</ref>, used, e.g., for the American National Corpus<ref>http://www.anc.org/</ref>\n* PAULA-XML,<ref>https://www.sfb632.uni-potsdam.de/en/paula.html</ref> standoff-XML serialization of the data model underlying the corpus management system ANNIS and the converter suite SALT<ref>https://corpus-tools.org/salt/</ref>\n* NAF (NLP Annotation Format / Newsreader Annotation Format),<ref>https://github.com/newsreader/NAF</ref>\n standoff XML format originally developed in the NewsReader project (FP7, 2013-2015 <ref>https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/316404</ref>), currently used by NLP tools such as FreeLing<ref>http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/</ref> (with support for English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, German, Russian, Catalan, Galician, Croatian, Slovene, etc.), and EusTagger <ref>http://www.hitz.eus/en/nlp</ref> (with support for Basque, English, Spanish).\n\n=== Graph-based formalisms ===\n\nRather than grounding markup information in a tree, standoff XML employs a data model based on directed graphs.{{sfn|Ide|Suderman|2007}}\nAs an alternative to traditional markup, such graph-based data models can be represented with formalisms originally developed for generalised directed [[multigraph]]s, most notably the [[Resource Description Framework|Resource Description Framework (RDF)]].{{sfn|Cassidy|2010|log=cassidy}}{{sfn|Chiarcos|2012|log=POWLA}}\nEARMARK is an early [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]/[[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] representation that encompasses GODDAGs.{{sfn|Di Iorio|Peroni|Vitali|2009}}\n\nRDF provides different linearisations, including an XML format that can be modeled to mirror conventional standoff XML, and a linearization that lets RDF be expressed in XML attributes ([[RDFa]]). But while it is semantically equivalent to standoff XML, it does not require special-purpose technology for storing, parsing and querying. Multiple interlinked RDF files representing a document or a corpus may constitute an example of [[Linguistic Linked Open Data]].\n\nEggert & Schmidt describe encoding a corpus (the [[Charles Harpur Critical Archive]]) using 'multi-version documents' (MVD) to represent the variant versions of documents and as a means of indicating additions, deletions and revisions using a tactical combination of multiple documents and stand-off ranges within an underlying graph-based model. MVD is presented as an application file format, requiring specialised tools to view or edit.{{sfn|Eggert|Schmidt|2019}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n* {{ cite conference\n

Using outward-opening doors allowed the DC-10's cargo area to be completely filled, since the door was not occupying usable interior space when open. To secure the door against the outward force from the [[pressurization]] of the fuselage at high altitudes, outward-opening doors must use heavy locking mechanisms. In the event of a door lock malfunction, there is great potential for explosive decompression.<ref name=waddington_p85-6>Waddington 2000, pp. 85\u201386.</ref>\n\n====American Airlines Flight 96====\n{{main|American Airlines Flight 96}}\nA problem with the outward-opening cargo door first became publicly known on June 12, 1972, when [[American Airlines Flight 96]] lost its [[aft]] cargo door shortly after takeoff from [[Detroit Metro Airport]], in flight above [[Windsor, Ontario]]. Before Flight 96 took off, an airport employee had forced the door shut. Due to the cargo door's design, the door appeared to be securely locked despite the internal locking mechanism not being fully engaged. Subsequently, when the aircraft reached approximately {{convert|11750|ft|m}} in altitude, the rear cargo door blew out, causing an [[explosive decompression]] that created a large pressure differential between the cabin above and the cargo bay below, causing the cabin floor to collapse.<ref name=aci>\"Behind Closed Doors\". ''Air Crash Investigation, Mayday (TV series)''. [[National Geographic Channel]], Season 5, Number 2.</ref> This collapsed section of the floor cut or impeded many of the control cables to the [[empennage]] control systems necessary to fly the aircraft, which were routed through the floor beams, leaving the pilots with very limited control of the aircraft.<ref name=fielder_birsch_p94/><ref name=fielder_birsch_p94>Fielder and Birsch 1992, p. 94.</ref><ref>[http://libraryonline.erau.edu/online-full-text/ntsb/aircraft-accident-reports/AAR73-02.pdf \"NTSB-AAR-73-02 Report, Aircraft Accident Report: American Airlines, Inc.

The door relied on a set of heavy steel hooks to secure it against the door frame. When the hooks were fully engaged, an outside lever on the cargo door could be depressed to drive a set of locking pins through the hooks to hold them in place. The NTSB investigation found that it was possible to close the outside lever without the hooks being fully engaged, and there would be no outward signs that the locking mechanism was not engaged; the cargo-door indicator in the cockpit would still register the door as being secured without hooks and locking pins being in the closed position. This combination of factors caused Flight 96 to take off without its aft cargo door being fully locked. Following the Windsor accident investigation, the NTSB made several recommendations, including repairing the faulty cargo door design to make it impossible for baggage handlers to close the cargo door lever without the locking pins being fully engaged. It was also recommended that vents be installed in the cabin floor, so that in case of an explosive decompression, the pressure difference between the cabin and cargo bay could quickly be equalized without collapsing the cabin floor and damaging critical control systems.<ref name=aci /> Although many carriers voluntarily modified the cargo doors, no [[airworthiness directive]] was issued to require reworking of the locking system, due to a [[gentlemen's agreement]] between the head of the FAA, [[John H. Shaffer]], and the head of McDonnell Douglas's aircraft division, Jackson McGowen. McDonnell Douglas did make modifications to the cargo door, but the basic design remained unchanged and problems persisted.<ref name=aci />\n\n====Turkish Airlines Flight 981====\n{{main|Turkish Airlines Flight 981}}\nOn March 3, 1974, an almost identical cargo-door blowout caused [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] to crash into a forest near the town of [[Ermenonville]], France, shortly after leaving Paris.<ref name=aci />  All 346 people on board died;<ref name=TA_Flt_981/> it was one of the deadliest air crashes of all time.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19740304&id=p-tRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RnMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4842,3446994 \"Plane crash in France kills 346\"].

The crew managed to fly the aircraft onto the runway in a partially controlled manner, and 185 of the 296 people on board survived (111 died) despite the destruction of the aircraft during the crash landing.<ref name=ntsb_AAR-90-06/>\n\nThe DC-10 included no cable backup for the hydraulic-powered flight controls because it was considered nearly impossible for three hydraulic systems to fail during one flight, and that the control surfaces were too large to be moved without hydraulic assistance. All three hydraulic systems were in close proximity, directly beneath the tail engine. The #2 engine explosion hurled fragments that ruptured all three lines, resulting in total loss of control to the elevators, ailerons, spoilers, horizontal stabilizer, rudder, flaps and slats.<ref name=ntsb_AAR-90-06>\"NTSB/AAR-90/06, Aircraft Accident Report United Airlines Flight 232, McDonnell Douglas DC-10-40, Sioux Gateway Airport, Sioux City, Iowa, July 19, 1989\" [http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/summary/AAR9006.html summary], [http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR90-06.pdf report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104033524/http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR90-06.pdf |date=January 4, 2011}}. ''NTSB'', November 1, 1990.</ref>\n\nFollowing the UAL 232 accident, [[Fuse (hydraulic)|hydraulic fuses]] were installed in the #3 hydraulic system in the area below the #2 engine on all DC-10 aircraft to ensure that sufficient control capability remained if all three hydraulic system lines should be damaged in the tail area. It is still possible to lose all three hydraulic systems elsewhere. This nearly happened to a cargo airliner in 2002 during takeoff when a main-gear tire exploded in the wheel well. The damage in the left wing area caused total loss of pressure from the #1 and the #2 hydraulic systems.

One cabin window separated from the fuselage after it was struck by debris flung from the exploding engine. The passenger sitting next to that window was killed and ejected from the aircraft. The crew initiated an emergency descent, and landed the aircraft safely.<ref name=job>[[Mcarthur Job]]. Air Disaster Volume 1. Aerospace Publications Pty Ltd. 1994. {{ISBN|1-875671-11-0}}</ref>\n* December 17, 1973: [[Iberia Airlines Flight 933]] crashed and struck the ALS system at [[Boston Logan International Airport]] which collapsed the front landing gear. All 168 passengers and crew survived. This is the first hull loss of a DC-10 aircraft.\n* November 12, 1975: [[Overseas National Airways|ONA]] Flight 032, a DC-10 on a ferry flight struck a heavy flock of seagulls while on its takeoff roll from JFK International Airport, New York. The captain aborted below V1 speed, but the #3 engine exploded, causing a partial braking failure. The landing gear collapsed and fire eventually destroyed the plane. All 139 ONA employees on board survived. Two were seriously injured, while 30 others had minor injuries.<ref>NTSB report, Identification: DCA76AZ010</ref>{{specify|This cite needs filling out|date=March 2014}}\n* January 2, 1976: An ONA DC-10 experienced an undershoot on a short runway in Istanbul, Turkey. The aircraft touched the ground and crash landed, then a fire in the #1 engine started. The aircraft was destroyed. All passengers survived.<ref>NTSB report, Identification: DCA76RA017</ref>{{specify|This cite needs filling out|date=March 2014}} \n* March 1, 1978: [[Continental Airlines Flight 603]], a DC-10-10, began its take-off from Los Angeles International Airport. Approaching V1 in the takeoff roll, the recapping tread of the No. 2 tire on the left main landing gear separated from the tire and the resulting overload caused that tire to blow out. That in turn, imposed an overload on the No. 1 tire on the same axle, resulting in a second blowout almost immediately after the first blowout. Shrapnel from the rims of the failed tires then damaged the No. 5 tire on the left main gear, causing it to also blow out. The blowouts ruptured a fuel tank, which combined with the excessive heat from the aborted take off maneuver, resulted in a massive fire. Two passengers were killed in the ensuing evacuation and two died later from injuries sustained in the accident.\n* October 31, 1979: [[Western Airlines Flight 2605]], a DC-10-10, collided with construction equipment after landing on a closed runway at Mexico City International Airport, killing 72 of the 88 people on board and one person on the ground. The crash was caused by failure to follow proper landing guidelines in consideration of the fog on the runway.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19791031-0|title=Accident description|last=|first=|date=|website=Aviation-safety.net|publisher=|access-date=January 24, 2017}}</ref>\n* November 11, 1979: an Aeromexico DC-10 entered a sustained stall while climbing through 29,800&nbsp;ft, to its assigned cruise altitude of 31,000&nbsp;ft, over [[Luxembourg]], Europe. The flight crew failed to monitor their flight instruments, so they did not immediately recognize that the plane was in a stalled condition. Instead, they blamed the heavy buffeting on the #3 engine, which they shut down, while continuing to hold the nose up. The plane continued to descend for one minute in a fully stalled condition, until the pilots lowered the nose and began a proper stall recovery procedure, which was completed at 18,900&nbsp;ft. The #3 engine was then restarted, the declaration of emergency was canceled and the flight continued to [[Miami, Florida]]. Ground inspection revealed four feet missing from each of the outboard elevator tips, including the balance weights.  The NTSB concluded that the sustained stall buffeting produced a dynamic structural overload on the elevator, which resulted in the failure of the elevator tips and balance weights. Further, the NTSB concluded that the autopilot had improperly been placed in vertical speed mode. That forced the AP to keep increasing the angle of attack to maintain the preselected vertical speed number, because maximum available engine thrust declined (normally) with increasing altitude. That caused the airspeed to fall below the stall speed of the aircraft.<ref>[http://www.fss.aero/accident-reports/dvdfiles/US/1979-11-11-US.pdf  \"In-flight upset, Aeromexico, DC-10-30, XA-DUH, over Luxembourg, Europe, November 11, 1979\"].

Using outward-opening doors allowed the DC-10's cargo area to be completely filled, since the door was not occupying usable interior space when open. To secure the door against the outward force from the [[pressurization]] of the fuselage at high altitudes, outward-opening doors must use heavy locking mechanisms. In the event of a door lock malfunction, there is great potential for explosive decompression.<ref name=waddington_p85-6>Waddington 2000, pp. 85\u201386.</ref>\n\n====American Airlines Flight 96====\n{{main|American Airlines Flight 96}}\nA problem with the outward-opening cargo door first became publicly known on June 12, 1972, when [[American Airlines Flight 96]] lost its [[aft]] cargo door shortly after takeoff from [[Detroit Metro Airport]], in flight above [[Windsor, Ontario]]. Before Flight 96 took off, an airport employee had forced the door shut. Due to the cargo door's design, the door appeared to be securely locked despite the internal locking mechanism not being fully engaged. Subsequently, when the aircraft reached approximately {{convert|11750|ft|m}} in altitude, the rear cargo door blew out, causing an [[explosive decompression]] that created a large pressure differential between the cabin above and the cargo bay below, causing the cabin floor to collapse.<ref name=aci>\"Behind Closed Doors\". ''Air Crash Investigation, Mayday (TV series)''. [[National Geographic Channel]], Season 5, Number 2.</ref> This collapsed section of the floor cut or impeded many of the control cables to the [[empennage]] control systems necessary to fly the aircraft, which were routed through the floor beams, leaving the pilots with very limited control of the aircraft.<ref name=fielder_birsch_p94/><ref name=fielder_birsch_p94>Fielder and Birsch 1992, p. 94.</ref><ref>[http://libraryonline.erau.edu/online-full-text/ntsb/aircraft-accident-reports/AAR73-02.pdf \"NTSB-AAR-73-02 Report, Aircraft Accident Report: American Airlines, Inc.

The door relied on a set of heavy steel hooks to secure it against the door frame. When the hooks were fully engaged, an outside lever on the cargo door could be depressed to drive a set of locking pins through the hooks to hold them in place. The NTSB investigation found that it was possible to close the outside lever without the hooks being fully engaged, and there would be no outward signs that the locking mechanism was not engaged; the cargo-door indicator in the cockpit would still register the door as being secured without hooks and locking pins being in the closed position. This combination of factors caused Flight 96 to take off without its aft cargo door being fully locked. Following the Windsor accident investigation, the NTSB made several recommendations, including repairing the faulty cargo door design to make it impossible for baggage handlers to close the cargo door lever without the locking pins being fully engaged. It was also recommended that vents be installed in the cabin floor, so that in case of an explosive decompression, the pressure difference between the cabin and cargo bay could quickly be equalized without collapsing the cabin floor and damaging critical control systems.<ref name=aci /> Although many carriers voluntarily modified the cargo doors, no [[airworthiness directive]] was issued to require reworking of the locking system, due to a [[gentlemen's agreement]] between the head of the FAA, [[John H. Shaffer]], and the head of McDonnell Douglas's aircraft division, Jackson McGowen. McDonnell Douglas did make modifications to the cargo door, but the basic design remained unchanged and problems persisted.<ref name=aci />\n\n====Turkish Airlines Flight 981====\n{{main|Turkish Airlines Flight 981}}\nOn March 3, 1974, an almost identical cargo-door blowout caused [[Turkish Airlines Flight 981]] to crash into a forest near the town of [[Ermenonville]], France, shortly after leaving Paris.<ref name=aci />  All 346 people on board died;<ref name=TA_Flt_981/> it was one of the deadliest air crashes of all time.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat=19740304&id=p-tRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=RnMDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4842,3446994 \"Plane crash in France kills 346\"].

The faulty procedure was done using a [[forklift]], which resulted in inadvertent structural damage.

The panel's report, published in June 1980, found \"critical deficiencies in the way the Government certifies the safety of American-built airliners\".

The flight crew, led by Captain [[Alfred C. Haynes|Al Haynes]] and assisted by DC-10 flight instructor [[Deadheading (aviation)|flying as a passenger]] ([[Dennis E.

All three hydraulic systems were in close proximity, directly beneath the tail engine. The #2 engine explosion hurled fragments that ruptured all three lines, resulting in total loss of control to the elevators, ailerons, spoilers, horizontal stabilizer, rudder, flaps and slats.<ref name=ntsb_AAR-90-06>\"NTSB/AAR-90/06, Aircraft Accident Report United Airlines Flight 232, McDonnell Douglas DC-10-40, Sioux Gateway Airport, Sioux City, Iowa, July 19, 1989\" [http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/summary/AAR9006.html summary], [http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR90-06.pdf report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104033524/http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR90-06.pdf |date=January 4, 2011}}.

The captain aborted below V1 speed, but the #3 engine exploded, causing a partial braking failure. The landing gear collapsed and fire eventually destroyed the plane.

Approaching V1 in the takeoff roll, the recapping tread of the No. 2 tire on the left main landing gear separated from the tire and the resulting overload caused that tire to blow out. That in turn, imposed an overload on the No. 1 tire on the same axle, resulting in a second blowout almost immediately after the first blowout. Shrapnel from the rims of the failed tires then damaged the No. 5 tire on the left main gear, causing it to also blow out. The blowouts ruptured a fuel tank, which combined with the excessive heat from the aborted take off maneuver, resulted in a massive fire. Two passengers were killed in the ensuing evacuation and two died later from injuries sustained in the accident.\n* October 31, 1979: [[Western Airlines Flight 2605]], a DC-10-10, collided with construction equipment after landing on a closed runway at Mexico City International Airport, killing 72 of the 88 people on board and one person on the ground. The crash was caused by failure to follow proper landing guidelines in consideration of the fog on the runway.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19791031-0|title=Accident description|last=|first=|date=|website=Aviation-safety.net|publisher=|access-date=January 24, 2017}}</ref>\n* November 11, 1979: an Aeromexico DC-10 entered a sustained stall while climbing through 29,800&nbsp;ft, to its assigned cruise altitude of 31,000&nbsp;ft, over [[Luxembourg]], Europe. The flight crew failed to monitor their flight instruments, so they did not immediately recognize that the plane was in a stalled condition. Instead, they blamed the heavy buffeting on the #3 engine, which they shut down, while continuing to hold the nose up. The plane continued to descend for one minute in a fully stalled condition, until the pilots lowered the nose and began a proper stall recovery procedure, which was completed at 18,900&nbsp;ft. The #3 engine was then restarted, the declaration of emergency was canceled and the flight continued to [[Miami, Florida]]. Ground inspection revealed four feet missing from each of the outboard elevator tips, including the balance weights.  The NTSB concluded that the sustained stall buffeting produced a dynamic structural overload on the elevator, which resulted in the failure of the elevator tips and balance weights. Further, the NTSB concluded that the autopilot had improperly been placed in vertical speed mode. That forced the AP to keep increasing the angle of attack to maintain the preselected vertical speed number, because maximum available engine thrust declined (normally) with increasing altitude. That caused the airspeed to fall below the stall speed of the aircraft.<ref>[http://www.fss.aero/accident-reports/dvdfiles/US/1979-11-11-US.pdf  \"In-flight upset, Aeromexico, DC-10-30, XA-DUH, over Luxembourg, Europe, November 11, 1979\"].
