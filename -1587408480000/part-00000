After the meal, Jesus is betrayed, arrested, tried, and then [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]].<ref name=CEvans465 /><ref name=Fahlbusch52 />\n\nKey events in the meal are the preparation of the disciples for the departure of Jesus, the predictions about the impending betrayal of Jesus, and the foretelling of the upcoming denial of Jesus by [[Apostle Peter]].<ref name=CEvans465 /><ref name=Fahlbusch52 />\n\n===Prediction of Judas' betrayal===\n{{Main|Jesus predicts his betrayal}}\nIn {{Bibleref2|Matthew|26:24\u201325}}, {{Bibleref2|Mark|14:18\u201321}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|22:21\u201323}} and {{Bibleref2|John|13:21\u201330}} during the meal, Jesus predicted that one of the apostles present would betray him.<ref name=Cox182 >Steven L. Cox, Kendell H Easley, 2007 ''Harmony of the Gospels'' {{ISBN|0805494448}} p. 182</ref> Jesus is described as reiterating, despite each apostle's assertion that he would not betray Jesus, that the betrayer would be one of those who were present, and saying that there would be \"woe to the man who betrays the [[Son of man (Christianity)|Son of man]]! It would be better for him if he had not been born.\"<ref>{{bibleref2|Mark|14:20\u201321}}</ref>\n\nIn {{Bibleref2|Matthew|26:23\u201325}} and {{Bibleref2|John|13:26\u201327}}, [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] is specifically identified as the traitor. In the Gospel of John, when asked about the traitor, Jesus states:\n{{quote|\"It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.\" Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him.<ref name=CEvans465 /><ref name=Fahlbusch52 />}}\n\n===Institution of the Eucharist===\n{{Main|Origin of the Eucharist}}\n{{Death of Jesus}}\nThe three Synoptic Gospel accounts give somewhat different versions of the order of the meal. In chapter 26 of the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus prays thanks for the bread, divides it, and hands the pieces of bread to his disciples, saying \"Take, eat, this is my body.\" Later in the meal Jesus takes a cup of wine, offers another [[prayer]], and gives it to those present, saying \"Drink from it, all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will never again drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father\u2019s kingdom.\"\n\nIn chapter 22 of the Gospel of Luke, however, the wine is blessed and distributed before the bread, followed by the bread, then by a second, larger cup of wine, as well as somewhat different wordings. Additionally, according to Paul and Luke, he tells the disciples \"do this in remembrance of me.\" This event has been regarded by Christians of most denominations as the institution of the [[Eucharist]]. There is recorded celebration of the Eucharist by the early Christian community [[Jerusalem in Christianity|in Jerusalem]].<ref name=ODCC>Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church / editors, F. L. Cross & E. A. Livingstone 2005 {{ISBN|978-0192802903}}, article ''Eucharist''</ref>\n\nThe institution of the Eucharist is recorded in the three Synoptic Gospels and in Paul's [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]]. As noted above, Jesus's words differ slightly in each account. In addition, {{Bibleref2|Luke|22:19b\u201320}} is a disputed text which does not appear in some of the early manuscripts of Luke.

John thus implies that the Friday of the crucifixion was the day of preparation for the feast (14 Nisan), not the feast itself (15 Nisan), and astronomical calculations of ancient Passover dates initiated by [[Chronology of Jesus#Astronomical analysis|Isaac Newton]], and posthumously published in 1733, support John's chronology.<ref>{{cite journal|author-last=Pratt|author-first=J.

According to Jaubert, Jesus would have celebrated the Passover on Tuesday, and the Jewish authorities three days later, on Friday.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re1049.htm |author=Pope Benedict XVI |chapter=The Dating of the Last Supper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cbzkRUa2j18C&pg=PA106 |title=Jesus of Nazareth |publisher=Catholic Truth Society and Ignatius Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-1586175009 |pages=106\u201315}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Humphreys has calculated that Jaubert's proposal cannot be correct, as the Qumran solar Passover would always fall {{em|after}} the official Jewish lunar Passover. Nevertheless, he agrees with the approach of two Passover dates, and argues that the Last Supper took place on the evening of Wednesday 1 April 33, based on his recent discovery of the Essene, [[Samaritan]], and [[Zealots (Judea)|Zealot]] {{em|lunar}} calendar, which is based on Egyptian reckoning.<ref>Humphreys 2011, pp. 164, 168</ref><ref name=humphreys >{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/135477/20110418/colin-humphreys-last-supper-challenge-biblical-calendar-jewish-calendar-final-days-of-jesus-good-fri.htm |author=Staff Reporter |title=Last Supper was on Wednesday, not Thursday, challenges Cambridge professor Colin Humphreys.| newspaper=[[International Business Times]] |date=18 April 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref> Humphreys' implication is that Jesus and other communities were following the original Hebrew calendar putatively imported from Egypt by Moses (which requires calculating the time of the invisible new moon), rather than the official Jewish calendar which had been adopted more recently, in the 6th century BC during the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]] (which simply requires observing the visible waxing moon). A Last Supper on Wednesday, he argues, would allow more time than in the traditional view (Last Supper on Thursday) for the various interrogations of Jesus and [[Pilate's Court|his presentation to Pilate]] before he was crucified on Friday. Furthermore, a Wednesday Last Supper, followed by a Thursday daylight [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|Sanhedrin trial]], followed by a Friday judicial confirmation and crucifixion would not require violating Jewish court procedure as documented in the 2nd century, which forbade capital trials at night and moreover required a confirmatory session the following day.\n\nIn a review of Humphreys' book, the Bible scholar William R Telford points out that the non-astronomical parts of his argument are based on the assumption that the chronologies described in the New Testament are historical and based on eyewitness testimony. In doing so, Telford says, Humphreys has built an argument upon unsound premises which \"does violence to the nature of the biblical texts, whose mixture of fact and fiction, tradition and redaction, history and myth all make the rigid application of the scientific tool of astronomy to their putative data a misconstrued enterprise.\"<ref name=\"Telford\">{{cite journal|last1=Telford|first1=William R.|title=Review of The Mystery of the Last Supper: Reconstructing the Final Days of Jesus|journal=The Journal of Theological Studies|date=2015|volume=66|issue=1|pages=371\u201376|doi=10.1093/jts/flv005|url=http://jts.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/02/27/jts.flv005|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Location===\n{{main|Cenacle}}\n[[File:Cenacle on Mount Zion.jpg|thumb|180px|left|The [[Cenacle]] on [[Mount Zion]], claimed to be the location of the Last Supper and [[Pentecost]].]]\nAccording to later tradition, the Last Supper took place in what is today called The [[Cenacle|Room of the Last Supper]] on [[Mount Zion]], just outside the walls of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]], and is traditionally known as The Upper Room. This is based on the account in the [[Synoptic Gospels]] that states that Jesus had instructed two disciples (Luke 22:8 specifies that Jesus sent Peter and John) to go to \"the city\" to meet \"a man carrying a jar of water\", who would lead them to a house, where they would find \"a large upper room furnished and ready\".{{Bibleref2c|Mark|14:13\u201315}} In this upper room they \"prepare the Passover\".\n\n[[Bargil Pixner]] claims the original site is located beneath the current structure of the Cenacle on [[Mount Zion]].<ref name=\"Pixner\">Bargil Pixner, ''The Church of the Apostles found on Mount Zion'', [[Biblical Archaeology Review]] 16.3 May/June 1990 [http://www.centuryone.org/apostles.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309011150/http://www.centuryone.org/apostles.html |date=9 March 2018 }}</ref> \n\nNo more specific indication of the location is given in the New Testament, and the \"city\" referred to may be a [[suburb]] of Jerusalem, such as Bethany, rather than Jerusalem itself.

Though Christians interpret ''Agape'' as meaning a ''divine'' form of love beyond human forms, in modern Greek the term is used in the sense of \"I love you\" (''romantic love'').</ref> These \"love feasts\" were apparently a full meal, with each participant bringing food, and with the meal eaten in a common room. They were held on Sundays, which became known as the [[Lord's Day]], to recall the resurrection, the appearance of Christ to the disciples on the [[road to Emmaus]], the [[Doubting Thomas|appearance to Thomas]] and the [[Pentecost]] which all took place on Sundays after the Passion.\n\n==Passover parallels==\n[[File:The-Last-Supper-large.jpg|thumbnail|''Last Supper'', [[Carl Bloch]]. In some depictions [[John the Apostle]] is placed on the right side of Jesus, some to the left.]]\nSince the late 20th century, with growing consciousness of the Jewish character of the early church and the improvement of Jewish-Christian relations, it became common among some lay people to associate the Last Supper with the Jewish [[Seder]]. This is due to the fact that the Synoptic Gospels  describe it as a Passover Meal. Some evangelical groups borrowed Seder customs, like [[Haggadah]]s, and incorporated them in new rituals meant to mimic the Last Supper; likewise, many secularized Jews presume that the event was a Seder. This identification is somewhat erroneous, as although it was most likely a Passover Meal, it was according to the Second Temple Period customs and included the consumption of a full lamb. The earliest elements in the current Passover Seder (a fortiori the full-fledged ritual, which is first recorded in full only in the ninth century) are a [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic enactment]] instituted in remembrance of the Temple, which was still standing during the Last Supper.<ref>for example: ''[https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2017/march-web-only/jesus-didnt-eat-seder-meal.html Jesus Didn\u2019t Eat a Seder Meal]'', [[Christianity Today]], 6 April 2017.</ref>\n\nThe fifth chapter in the [[Quran]], ''[[Al-Ma'ida]]'' (the table) contains a reference to a meal (Sura 5:114) with a table sent down from God to [[Jesus in Islam|\u02bf\u012as\u00e1]] (i.e., Jesus) and the apostles (Hawariyyin). However, there is nothing in Sura 5:114 to indicate that Jesus was celebrating that meal regarding his impending death, especially as the Quran states that Jesus was never crucified to begin with. Thus, although Sura 5:114 refers to \"a meal\", there is no indication that it is the Last Supper.<ref>''Christology in dialogue with Muslims'' by Ivor Mark Beaumont 2005 {{ISBN|1870345460}} p. 145</ref> However, some scholars believe that Jesus' manner of speech during which the table was sent down suggests that it was an affirmation of the apostles' resolves and to strengthen their faiths as the impending trial was about to befall them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Last Supper of Jesus According to Islam|first=Maan|last=Khalife|year=2012|url=http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-about-islam/faith-and-worship/quran-and-scriptures/460307-last-supper-of-jesuspbuh.html?Scriptures=}}</ref>\n\n==Historicity==\nJesus having a final meal with his disciples is almost beyond dispute among scholars, and belongs to the framework of the narrative of Jesus's life.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sanders|first1=E.

[[Byzantine]] artists frequently focused on the Apostles receiving Communion, rather than the reclining figures having a meal.

The second is the moment of the institution of the tradition of the [[Eucharist]]. The depictions here are generally solemn and mystical. The third major theme is the [[Farewell discourse|farewell of Jesus to his disciples]], in which [[Judas Iscariot]] is no longer present, having left the supper.

After the meal, Jesus is betrayed, arrested, tried, and then [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]].<ref name=CEvans465 /><ref name=Fahlbusch52 />\n\nKey events in the meal are the preparation of the disciples for the departure of Jesus, the predictions about the impending betrayal of Jesus, and the foretelling of the upcoming denial of Jesus by [[Apostle Peter]].<ref name=CEvans465 /><ref name=Fahlbusch52 />\n\n===Prediction of Judas' betrayal===\n{{Main|Jesus predicts his betrayal}}\nIn {{Bibleref2|Matthew|26:24\u201325}}, {{Bibleref2|Mark|14:18\u201321}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|22:21\u201323}} and {{Bibleref2|John|13:21\u201330}} during the meal, Jesus predicted that one of the apostles present would betray him.<ref name=Cox182 >Steven L. Cox, Kendell H Easley, 2007 ''Harmony of the Gospels'' {{ISBN|0805494448}} p. 182</ref> Jesus is described as reiterating, despite each apostle's assertion that he would not betray Jesus, that the betrayer would be one of those who were present, and saying that there would be \"woe to the man who betrays the [[Son of man (Christianity)|Son of man]]! It would be better for him if he had not been born.\"<ref>{{bibleref2|Mark|14:20\u201321}}</ref>\n\nIn {{Bibleref2|Matthew|26:23\u201325}} and {{Bibleref2|John|13:26\u201327}}, [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] is specifically identified as the traitor. In the Gospel of John, when asked about the traitor, Jesus states:\n{{quote|\"It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread when I have dipped it in the dish.\" Then, dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered into him.<ref name=CEvans465 /><ref name=Fahlbusch52 />}}\n\n===Institution of the Eucharist===\n{{Main|Origin of the Eucharist}}\n{{Death of Jesus}}\nThe three Synoptic Gospel accounts give somewhat different versions of the order of the meal. In chapter 26 of the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus prays thanks for the bread, divides it, and hands the pieces of bread to his disciples, saying \"Take, eat, this is my body.\" Later in the meal Jesus takes a cup of wine, offers another [[prayer]], and gives it to those present, saying \"Drink from it, all of you; for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will never again drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father\u2019s kingdom.\"\n\nIn chapter 22 of the Gospel of Luke, however, the wine is blessed and distributed before the bread, followed by the bread, then by a second, larger cup of wine, as well as somewhat different wordings. Additionally, according to Paul and Luke, he tells the disciples \"do this in remembrance of me.\" This event has been regarded by Christians of most denominations as the institution of the [[Eucharist]]. There is recorded celebration of the Eucharist by the early Christian community [[Jerusalem in Christianity|in Jerusalem]].<ref name=ODCC>Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church / editors, F. L.

John thus implies that the Friday of the crucifixion was the day of preparation for the feast (14 Nisan), not the feast itself (15 Nisan), and astronomical calculations of ancient Passover dates initiated by [[Chronology of Jesus#Astronomical analysis|Isaac Newton]], and posthumously published in 1733, support John's chronology.<ref>{{cite journal|author-last=Pratt|author-first=J.

According to Jaubert, Jesus would have celebrated the Passover on Tuesday, and the Jewish authorities three days later, on Friday.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re1049.htm |author=Pope Benedict XVI |chapter=The Dating of the Last Supper |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cbzkRUa2j18C&pg=PA106 |title=Jesus of Nazareth |publisher=Catholic Truth Society and Ignatius Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-1586175009 |pages=106\u201315}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Humphreys has calculated that Jaubert's proposal cannot be correct, as the Qumran solar Passover would always fall {{em|after}} the official Jewish lunar Passover. Nevertheless, he agrees with the approach of two Passover dates, and argues that the Last Supper took place on the evening of Wednesday 1 April 33, based on his recent discovery of the Essene, [[Samaritan]], and [[Zealots (Judea)|Zealot]] {{em|lunar}} calendar, which is based on Egyptian reckoning.<ref>Humphreys 2011, pp. 164, 168</ref><ref name=humphreys >{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/135477/20110418/colin-humphreys-last-supper-challenge-biblical-calendar-jewish-calendar-final-days-of-jesus-good-fri.htm |author=Staff Reporter |title=Last Supper was on Wednesday, not Thursday, challenges Cambridge professor Colin Humphreys.| newspaper=[[International Business Times]] |date=18 April 2011 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}</ref> Humphreys' implication is that Jesus and other communities were following the original Hebrew calendar putatively imported from Egypt by Moses (which requires calculating the time of the invisible new moon), rather than the official Jewish calendar which had been adopted more recently, in the 6th century BC during the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]] (which simply requires observing the visible waxing moon). A Last Supper on Wednesday, he argues, would allow more time than in the traditional view (Last Supper on Thursday) for the various interrogations of Jesus and [[Pilate's Court|his presentation to Pilate]] before he was crucified on Friday. Furthermore, a Wednesday Last Supper, followed by a Thursday daylight [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|Sanhedrin trial]], followed by a Friday judicial confirmation and crucifixion would not require violating Jewish court procedure as documented in the 2nd century, which forbade capital trials at night and moreover required a confirmatory session the following day.\n\nIn a review of Humphreys' book, the Bible scholar William R Telford points out that the non-astronomical parts of his argument are based on the assumption that the chronologies described in the New Testament are historical and based on eyewitness testimony. In doing so, Telford says, Humphreys has built an argument upon unsound premises which \"does violence to the nature of the biblical texts, whose mixture of fact and fiction, tradition and redaction, history and myth all make the rigid application of the scientific tool of astronomy to their putative data a misconstrued enterprise.\"<ref name=\"Telford\">{{cite journal|last1=Telford|first1=William R.|title=Review of The Mystery of the Last Supper: Reconstructing the Final Days of Jesus|journal=The Journal of Theological Studies|date=2015|volume=66|issue=1|pages=371\u201376|doi=10.1093/jts/flv005|url=http://jts.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/02/27/jts.flv005|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Location===\n{{main|Cenacle}}\n[[File:Cenacle on Mount Zion.jpg|thumb|180px|left|The [[Cenacle]] on [[Mount Zion]], claimed to be the location of the Last Supper and [[Pentecost]].]]\nAccording to later tradition, the Last Supper took place in what is today called The [[Cenacle|Room of the Last Supper]] on [[Mount Zion]], just outside the walls of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]], and is traditionally known as The Upper Room. This is based on the account in the [[Synoptic Gospels]] that states that Jesus had instructed two disciples (Luke 22:8 specifies that Jesus sent Peter and John) to go to \"the city\" to meet \"a man carrying a jar of water\", who would lead them to a house, where they would find \"a large upper room furnished and ready\".{{Bibleref2c|Mark|14:13\u201315}} In this upper room they \"prepare the Passover\".\n\n[[Bargil Pixner]] claims the original site is located beneath the current structure of the Cenacle on [[Mount Zion]].<ref name=\"Pixner\">Bargil Pixner, ''The Church of the Apostles found on Mount Zion'', [[Biblical Archaeology Review]] 16.3 May/June 1990 [http://www.centuryone.org/apostles.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309011150/http://www.centuryone.org/apostles.html |date=9 March 2018 }}</ref> \n\nNo more specific indication of the location is given in the New Testament, and the \"city\" referred to may be a [[suburb]] of Jerusalem, such as Bethany, rather than Jerusalem itself.

Though Christians interpret ''Agape'' as meaning a ''divine'' form of love beyond human forms, in modern Greek the term is used in the sense of \"I love you\" (''romantic love'').</ref> These \"love feasts\" were apparently a full meal, with each participant bringing food, and with the meal eaten in a common room. They were held on Sundays, which became known as the [[Lord's Day]], to recall the resurrection, the appearance of Christ to the disciples on the [[road to Emmaus]], the [[Doubting Thomas|appearance to Thomas]] and the [[Pentecost]] which all took place on Sundays after the Passion.\n\n==Passover parallels==\n[[File:The-Last-Supper-large.jpg|thumbnail|''Last Supper'', [[Carl Bloch]]. In some depictions [[John the Apostle]] is placed on the right side of Jesus, some to the left.]]\nSince the late 20th century, with growing consciousness of the Jewish character of the early church and the improvement of Jewish-Christian relations, it became common among some lay people to associate the Last Supper with the Jewish [[Seder]]. This is due to the fact that the Synoptic Gospels  describe it as a Passover Meal. Some evangelical groups borrowed Seder customs, like [[Haggadah]]s, and incorporated them in new rituals meant to mimic the Last Supper; likewise, many secularized Jews presume that the event was a Seder. This identification is somewhat erroneous, as although it was most likely a Passover Meal, it was according to the Second Temple Period customs and included the consumption of a full lamb. The earliest elements in the current Passover Seder (a fortiori the full-fledged ritual, which is first recorded in full only in the ninth century) are a [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic enactment]] instituted in remembrance of the Temple, which was still standing during the Last Supper.<ref>for example: ''[https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2017/march-web-only/jesus-didnt-eat-seder-meal.html Jesus Didn\u2019t Eat a Seder Meal]'', [[Christianity Today]], 6 April 2017.</ref>\n\nThe fifth chapter in the [[Quran]], ''[[Al-Ma'ida]]'' (the table) contains a reference to a meal (Sura 5:114) with a table sent down from God to [[Jesus in Islam|\u02bf\u012as\u00e1]] (i.e., Jesus) and the apostles (Hawariyyin). However, there is nothing in Sura 5:114 to indicate that Jesus was celebrating that meal regarding his impending death, especially as the Quran states that Jesus was never crucified to begin with. Thus, although Sura 5:114 refers to \"a meal\", there is no indication that it is the Last Supper.<ref>''Christology in dialogue with Muslims'' by Ivor Mark Beaumont 2005 {{ISBN|1870345460}} p. 145</ref> However, some scholars believe that Jesus' manner of speech during which the table was sent down suggests that it was an affirmation of the apostles' resolves and to strengthen their faiths as the impending trial was about to befall them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Last Supper of Jesus According to Islam|first=Maan|last=Khalife|year=2012|url=http://www.onislam.net/english/ask-about-islam/faith-and-worship/quran-and-scriptures/460307-last-supper-of-jesuspbuh.html?Scriptures=}}</ref>\n\n==Historicity==\nJesus having a final meal with his disciples is almost beyond dispute among scholars, and belongs to the framework of the narrative of Jesus's life.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sanders|first1=E.

[[Byzantine]] artists frequently focused on the Apostles receiving Communion, rather than the reclining figures having a meal. By the [[Renaissance]], the Last Supper was a favorite topic in Italian art.<ref name=McNamee >''Vested angels: eucharistic allusions in early Netherlandish paintings'' by Maurice B. McNamee 1998 {{ISBN|978-9042900073}} pp. 22\u201332</ref>\n\nThere are three major themes in the depictions of the Last Supper: the first is the dramatic and dynamic depiction of Jesus's [[Jesus predicts his betrayal|announcement of his betrayal]]. The second is the moment of the institution of the tradition of the [[Eucharist]]. The depictions here are generally solemn and mystical. The third major theme is the [[Farewell discourse|farewell of Jesus to his disciples]], in which [[Judas Iscariot]] is no longer present, having left the supper. The depictions here are generally melancholy, as Jesus prepares his disciples for his departure.<ref name=Zuffi >''Gospel figures in art'' by Stefano Zuffi 2003 {{ISBN|978-0892367276}} pp. 254\u201359</ref> There are also other, less frequently depicted scenes, such as the washing of the feet of the disciples.<ref name=Zuffi2>''Gospel figures in art'' by Stefano Zuffi 2003 {{ISBN|978-0892367276}} p. 252</ref>\n\nWell known examples include [[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Leonardo da Vinci's depiction]], which is considered the first work of [[High Renaissance]] art due to its high level of harmony,<ref name=Buser >''Experiencing art around us'' by Thomas Buser 2005 {{ISBN|978-0534641146}} pp. 382\u201383</ref> [[Last Supper (Tintoretto)|Tintoretto's depiction]] which is unusual in that it includes secondary characters carrying or taking the dishes from the table<ref>''Tintoretto: Tradition and Identity'' by Tom Nichols 2004 {{ISBN|1861891202}} p. 234</ref> and [[The Sacrament of the Last Supper|Salvadore Dali's depiction]] combines the typical Christian themes with modern approaches of [[Surrealism]].<ref>''The mathematics of harmony'' by Alexey Stakhov, Scott Olsen 2009 {{ISBN|978-9812775825}} pp. 177\u201378</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"5\" caption=\"Depictions of Last Supper\">\nFile:The Last Supper - Leonardo Da Vinci - High Resolution 32x16.jpg|''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]'', by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], late 15th century\nFile:Jacopo Tintoretto - The Last Supper - WGA22649.jpg|''[[Last Supper (Tintoretto)|The Last Supper]]'', by [[Tintoretto]], 1592\u20131594\nFile:\u00daltima Cena - Juan de Juanes.jpg|The first Eucharist, depicted by [[Juan de Juanes]] in ''The Last Supper'', c. 1562\nFile:Last Supper (Pisani).jpg|''[[The Last Supper (Pisani)|The Last Supper]]'' by [[Lazzaro Pisani]], the altarpiece of Corpus Christi Parish Church in G\u0127asri, Malta\nFile:Last Supper miniature from a Psalter c1220-40.png|Miniature depiction from c. 1230\nFile:Comunione degli apostoli, cella 35.jpg|''Communion of the Apostles'', by [[Fra Angelico]], with [[donor portrait]], 1440\u201341\nFile:Domenico ghirlandaio, cenacolo di ognissanti 01.jpg|[[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], 1480, depicting Judas separately\nFile:Valentin de Boulogne, Last Supper.jpg|[[Valentin de Boulogne]], 1625\u20131626\nFile:Wroc\u0142aw Last Supper.jpg|''Last Supper'', sculpture, c. 1500\nFile:Jaume Huguet - Last Supper - WGA11797.jpg|''Last Supper'' by [[Jaume Huguet]], c. 1470\nFile:Tiepolo Last Supper.jpg|''Last Supper'' by [[Tiepolo]], c. 1760\nFile:Bouveret Last Supper.jpg|''The Last Supper'', by [[Pascal Dagnan-Bouveret|Bouveret]], 19th century\nFile:Laatste Avondmaal, Gustave van de Woestyne, 1927, Groeningemuseum, 0040054000.jpg|''Last Supper'', by [[Gustave Van de Woestijne]], 1927\n</gallery>\n\n== Music ==\nThe Lutheran Passion hymn \"[[Da der Herr Christ zu Tische sa\u00df]]\" (When the Lord Christ sat at the table) derives from a depiction of the Last Supper.{{importance example|date=March 2020|reason=Basically every Communion hymn ever}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Friday the 13th]]\n* [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament]]\n* [[List of dining events]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{CathEncy|wstitle=The Last Supper|year=1912|last=Mershman|first=Francis|volume=14}}\n* [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/331170/Last-Supper \"Last Supper\"] on ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' Online.\n\n{{Easter}}\n{{Major events in Jesus life}}\n{{Apostles}}\n{{Last Supper in art}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Last Supper, The}}\n[[Category:Last Supper| ]]\n[[Category:1st century in Jerusalem]]\n[[Category:Christian terminology]]\n[[Category:Dining events]]\n[[Category:Luminous Mysteries]]\n[[Category:Passion of Jesus]]\n[[Category:Sacraments]]\n", "name_user": "188.28.43.10", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Undid revision 952133755 byElizium23(talk), unexplained blanking)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Supper"}

It is made clear that a woman's reputation is fragile in the community of Dagestan, and Patya's internal dialogue acknowledges and despises this.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n== Cultural Significance ==\nThe cultural significance of this novel is deep in magnitude, especially regarding it tackling the ideas of traditionalism, race, gender, and religion in Dagestan, Russia. \n\n=== Traditionalism ===\n[[File:Dagestan-Novolakskiy.png|thumb|Dagestan, Russia]]\nTraditionalism functions throughout the book largely through the scope of marriage. <ref name=\":3\" /> The fact that both characters are expected to marry by their early or mid-twenties is one of the key elements of the plot. This is perpetuated by the families of both characters. This was the same for their parents, and those before -- it was expected. One also gets to feel the pangs and echoes of a post-USSR Russia, where certain political opinions and ideas can put you in danger at times.<ref name=\":7\" /> Other times, these opinions create firm, divisive rifts between families and characters- Patya and Timur didn't get along for this very reason. The whole political youth group Timur was part of wouldn't disagree with him at all (besides Patya). They took what he said as fact, and fact alone. This powerful scene creates a sense of dread that the youth of Russia could be indoctrinated in a sort of \"[[Hitler Youth|Nazi Youth]]\" type fashion, and again contributes to the tone of dread laced throughout the book.\n\n=== Race ===\nGanieva tackles race in a subtle, interesting way throughout the book. Race plays a large role in who the main characters are permitted to marry, and is frequently noted throughout when mentioning potential candidates for marriage for both main characters. It is also highly sectionalized -- Russia has many microcosms of culture throughout its nation along with three separate dialects<ref name=\":5\" />, so the fact that race and traditionalism are still tied together in the beginning of this book by the parents of the main characters wanting them to \"keep it in the family\" paints a disparaging pre-modern picture of Russia, akin to a place similar to the \"wild west\"  where anything can go wrong at any minute.\n\n=== Gender ===\nIn the context of women, Ganieva presents a sense of sexism that is omnipresent and subtle and sometimes not so subtle throughout the book. For the not so subtle, one only needs to look to the first few pages of the book to be able to tell that women are not held as highly in esteem as men are, as Patya is almost raped, and casually goes about her day. This is not reported, and she doesn't tell anyone. Another character who highlights this is Timur, who, through his conversations about politics with Patya, subtly proves to think he is smarter than her and needs to change the ideas in her head because she is a woman who doesn't really know better. <ref name=\":4\" />Women are also considered less suitable if they do not have their virginity or already have kids, as this looks bad in the society presented in the book, and can lead to social isolation of sorts. Ganieva's awareness and criticism of sexism in Dagestan is apparent through her use of a male pseudonym to originally publish some of her works.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Religion ===\nAlthough the novel is fictitious, the religious tension that appears throughout ''Bride and Groom'' is no fantasy. Most religious content of the book involves conflict between different sects of [[Islam]]. The majority of people in the [[North Caucasus]] region practice the Islamic faith. Muslims in Dagestan, like in many other places in the world, are involved in an ongoing debate regarding the proper practice of Islam and the identity of the modern Muslim.<ref name=\":5\" /> Dagestan is a region that struggles with Islamic radicalism, a fact that is prevalent in the lives of Marat, Patya, and the author herself.<ref name=\":6\" /><br />\n== Synopsis ==\n[[File:Alisa Ganieva.jpg|thumb|[[Alisa Ganieva]], author of ''Bride and Groom'']]\nThe novel begins by introducing the main characters, Marat and Patya, through a series of events within Dagestan, Russia <ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />. Marat is a human rights lawyer who is working on solving a murder case, and Patya is a 25-year-old woman who is worrisome that she will not be able to find a husband soon. Marat and Patya have similar families -- both of which want them to find a spouse and get married as quickly as possible. Both families also observe the Islamic faith and share similar political beliefs, disliking what a central shady political character, Khalilbek, is doing within the government. Rumors and whispers of Khalilbek's wrongdoings pepper the community. Some, however, love Khalilbek, and claim he has done much for the community, disregarding the fact that he was in jail for the murder of a young man, who was ran over by him in the middle of the night, for some reason. The people who love Khalilbek create a very dystopic idea of the society they live in, blindly and wholeheartedly embrace him without any doubt of character, making his status near godhood.\n\nMarat and Patya meet at a concert which was supposed to celebrate his release- and both detest the concert. The two make an instant connection when they meet, and become romantic interests of one another. Marat attends a wedding at which an old lady cursed the bride and groom because the groom had gotten the old lady's daughter pregnant. While Marat's mother is continuously trying to set him up with a potential wife, Patya tries to sever ties with unwanted suitors, namely the aggressive Timur. Marat's mother requests that he go see a fortune teller to see if he will get married soon. Marat reluctantly agrees, and seems to gain nothing from the experience. On his way out, he finds out that a friend of his died in a religiously-based altercation. After a family dinner, Patya finds Marat outside and the two eat at a diner. Word quickly spreads, and despite Marat's mother desperately wanting her son to find a girl to marry, she does not approve of the relationship. Marat hears of a raid on his law firm, so he travels to Moscow at his next opportunity to try to salvage any important work left untouched. After Patya refuses to marry Timur, who her mother suggests, she meets up with Marat. Marat asks her to be his wife to which she agrees, but not without some reasonable doubt. Patya's news was not received well with her family. Marat met a stranger on the street who informed him of some of the reasonings behind Khalilbek's seemingly corrupt deeds among other things. Their conversation gives Marat new perspectives on the events of his life, and he felt his happiness become more pronounced. On the day of the wedding, Marat does not show up. Patya and her family are told that Marat has been taken by the police under the false accusation that he is a religious extremist. Patya leaves her house when nobody is watching and gets on a train headed for the shore. Marat is depicted to be beaten up in an interrogation room, slipping in and out of his real surroundings and a beachside conversation with Khalilbek.\n\n== Critical Reception ==\nReviews of the book were generally positive, with it garnering a good review from several people. Some notable examples include a review from Viv Groskop of the Observer <ref name=\":0\" />, which was posted on the Guardian, as well as a positive review from Emily D. Johnson in World Literature Today<ref name=\":1\" />. Both articles focus primarily on the tone of the book. For instance, Groskop  commented about how the tone feels generally clunky, but for the purpose of how it mirrors the characters' reality, where everyone speaks the same language but it is all mixed up in the chaos the author creates.  Emily D. Johnson comments in the same way about the nature of the Russia the characters live in, deeming it a chaotic and unstable environment where anything can go wrong at any minute. Olga Zillerbourg, also with World Literature Today, provides a great summary of the book which also mentions the dark tone of the book as well, mentioning the aspects of corruption within the book.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n''Bride and Groom''  received a radio adaptation by Bethan Roberts on [[BBC Radio 4]] in February of 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09r3xzw|title=BBC Radio 4 - Drama, Reading Europe - Russia: Bride and Groom, Episode 2|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''Bride and Groom'' is noted as the runner-up for 2015 [[Russian Booker Prize]], listed on the Asian Review of Books' top books of 2018, and included in a Russia Behind The Headlines list of top translated books of 2018.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n== References ==\n<br /><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Groskop|first=Viv|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/25/bride-and-groom-alisa-ganieva-review-odd-couples-dagestan|title=Bride and Groom review \u2013 odd couples in Dagestan|date=2018-03-25|work=The Observer|access-date=2020-04-01|language=en-GB|issn=0029-7712}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/2017/november/bride-and-groom-alisa-ganieva|title=Bride and Groom by Alisa Ganieva|date=2017-10-12|website=World Literature Today|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/07/27/love-in-daghestan-alisa-ganievas-bride-and-groom-a66569|title=Love in Dagestan: Alisa Ganieva's 'Bride and Groom'|last=Kapp|first=Sarah|date=2019-07-27|website=The Moscow Times|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Olson|first=Laura|title=The Worlds of Russian Village Women [Electronic Resource]: Tradition, Transgression, Compromise.|last2=Adonyeva|first2=Svetlana|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=JEWL}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Puppo|first=Lili Di|last2=Schmoller|first2=Jesko|date=2018|title=Islam and Ethnicity in Russia|url=|journal=Anthropological Journal of European Cultures|volume=27|pages=84-87|via=JEWL}}</ref><ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Tyrras|first=Nicholas S.|title=Russian Intellectual and Cultural History from the Ninth to the Twenty-First Century.|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=355-359|via=JEWL}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.asymptotejournal.com/criticism/alisa-ganieva-bride-and-groom/|title=Hannah Weber reviews Bride and Groom by Alisa Ganieva - Asymptote|website=www.asymptotejournal.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/2019/spring/what-read-now-contemporary-russian-language-literature-olga-zilberbourg|title=What to Read Now: Contemporary Russian-language Literature, by Olga Zilberbourg|date=2019-03-07|website=World Literature Today|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n<references />\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox book\n| name              = Bride and Groom\n| image             = \n| author            = [[Alisa Ganieva]]\n| language          = English (Translated from Russian)\n| country           = Russia\n| genre             = Fiction\n| published         = Deep Vellum\n| pub_date          = March 27, 2018\n| translator        = Carol Apollonio\n}}\n\n''Bride and Groom'' is a translation of a fictional novel by Russian contemporary author, [[Alisa Ganieva]], in which two people struggle to get married amidst the chaos of family, religion, politics, and life itself. <ref name=\":0\" /> <ref name=\":1\" /> The translation was done by Carol Apollonio, who had translated one of Ganieva's works before. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://slaviceurasian.duke.edu/people/carol-apollonio|title=Carol Apollonio {{!}} Duke Slavic & Eurasian Studies|website=slaviceurasian.duke.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>  \n\n== Publication ==\n''Bride and Groom'' was first published in 2015 in the original Russian with the title ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u0438 \u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430'' (''zhenikh i nevesta'').

Muslims in Dagestan, like in many other places in the world, are involved in an ongoing debate regarding the proper practice of Islam and the identity of the modern Muslim.<ref name=\":5\" /> Dagestan is a region that struggles with Islamic radicalism, a fact that is prevalent in the lives of Marat, Patya, and the author herself.<ref name=\":6\" /><br />\n== Synopsis ==\n[[File:Alisa Ganieva.jpg|thumb|[[Alisa Ganieva]], author of ''Bride and Groom'']]\nThe novel begins by introducing the main characters, Marat and Patya, through a series of events within Dagestan, Russia <ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />. Marat is a human rights lawyer who is working on solving a murder case, and Patya is a 25-year-old woman who is worrisome that she will not be able to find a husband soon. Marat and Patya have similar families -- both of which want them to find a spouse and get married as quickly as possible. Both families also observe the Islamic faith and share similar political beliefs, disliking what a central shady political character, Khalilbek, is doing within the government. Rumors and whispers of Khalilbek's wrongdoings pepper the community. Some, however, love Khalilbek, and claim he has done much for the community, disregarding the fact that he was in jail for the murder of a young man, who was ran over by him in the middle of the night, for some reason. The people who love Khalilbek create a very dystopic idea of the society they live in, blindly and wholeheartedly embrace him without any doubt of character, making his status near godhood.\n\nMarat and Patya meet at a concert which was supposed to celebrate his release- and both detest the concert. The two make an instant connection when they meet, and become romantic interests of one another. Marat attends a wedding at which an old lady cursed the bride and groom because the groom had gotten the old lady's daughter pregnant. While Marat's mother is continuously trying to set him up with a potential wife, Patya tries to sever ties with unwanted suitors, namely the aggressive Timur. Marat's mother requests that he go see a fortune teller to see if he will get married soon. Marat reluctantly agrees, and seems to gain nothing from the experience. On his way out, he finds out that a friend of his died in a religiously-based altercation. After a family dinner, Patya finds Marat outside and the two eat at a diner. Word quickly spreads, and despite Marat's mother desperately wanting her son to find a girl to marry, she does not approve of the relationship. Marat hears of a raid on his law firm, so he travels to Moscow at his next opportunity to try to salvage any important work left untouched. After Patya refuses to marry Timur, who her mother suggests, she meets up with Marat. Marat asks her to be his wife to which she agrees, but not without some reasonable doubt. Patya's news was not received well with her family. Marat met a stranger on the street who informed him of some of the reasonings behind Khalilbek's seemingly corrupt deeds among other things. Their conversation gives Marat new perspectives on the events of his life, and he felt his happiness become more pronounced. On the day of the wedding, Marat does not show up. Patya and her family are told that Marat has been taken by the police under the false accusation that he is a religious extremist. Patya leaves her house when nobody is watching and gets on a train headed for the shore. Marat is depicted to be beaten up in an interrogation room, slipping in and out of his real surroundings and a beachside conversation with Khalilbek.\n\n== Critical Reception ==\nReviews of the book were generally positive, with it garnering a good review from several people. Some notable examples include a review from Viv Groskop of the Observer <ref name=\":0\" />, which was posted on the Guardian, as well as a positive review from Emily D. Johnson in World Literature Today<ref name=\":1\" />. Both articles focus primarily on the tone of the book. For instance, Groskop  commented about how the tone feels generally clunky, but for the purpose of how it mirrors the characters' reality, where everyone speaks the same language but it is all mixed up in the chaos the author creates.  Emily D. Johnson comments in the same way about the nature of the Russia the characters live in, deeming it a chaotic and unstable environment where anything can go wrong at any minute. Olga Zillerbourg, also with World Literature Today, provides a great summary of the book which also mentions the dark tone of the book as well, mentioning the aspects of corruption within the book.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n''Bride and Groom''  received a radio adaptation by Bethan Roberts on [[BBC Radio 4]] in February of 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09r3xzw|title=BBC Radio 4 - Drama, Reading Europe - Russia: Bride and Groom, Episode 2|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''Bride and Groom'' is noted as the runner-up for 2015 [[Russian Booker Prize]], listed on the Asian Review of Books' top books of 2018, and included in a Russia Behind The Headlines list of top translated books of 2018.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n<br />\n\n== References ==\n<br /><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Groskop|first=Viv|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/25/bride-and-groom-alisa-ganieva-review-odd-couples-dagestan|title=Bride and Groom review \u2013 odd couples in Dagestan|date=2018-03-25|work=The Observer|access-date=2020-04-01|language=en-GB|issn=0029-7712}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/2017/november/bride-and-groom-alisa-ganieva|title=Bride and Groom by Alisa Ganieva|date=2017-10-12|website=World Literature Today|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/07/27/love-in-daghestan-alisa-ganievas-bride-and-groom-a66569|title=Love in Dagestan: Alisa Ganieva's 'Bride and Groom'|last=Kapp|first=Sarah|date=2019-07-27|website=The Moscow Times|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Olson|first=Laura|title=The Worlds of Russian Village Women [Electronic Resource]: Tradition, Transgression, Compromise.|last2=Adonyeva|first2=Svetlana|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=JEWL}}</ref><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Puppo|first=Lili Di|last2=Schmoller|first2=Jesko|date=2018|title=Islam and Ethnicity in Russia|url=|journal=Anthropological Journal of European Cultures|volume=27|pages=84-87|via=JEWL}}</ref><ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Tyrras|first=Nicholas S.|title=Russian Intellectual and Cultural History from the Ninth to the Twenty-First Century.|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=355-359|via=JEWL}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.asymptotejournal.com/criticism/alisa-ganieva-bride-and-groom/|title=Hannah Weber reviews Bride and Groom by Alisa Ganieva - Asymptote|website=www.asymptotejournal.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldliteraturetoday.org/2019/spring/what-read-now-contemporary-russian-language-literature-olga-zilberbourg|title=What to Read Now: Contemporary Russian-language Literature, by Olga Zilberbourg|date=2019-03-07|website=World Literature Today|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n<references />\n", "name_user": "Bondegezou", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCritical Reception", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bride_and_Groom_(Book)"}

Before becoming Japan's [[head of government]], Tojo was among the most outspoken proponents for [[preventive war]] against the United States during deliberations leading to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Upon becoming Prime Minister in October 17, 1941, he presided over the conquest of much of the West's territories in Asia and the Pacific until the defeat of Japanese forces at [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] and [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal]]. During his years in power, he also oversaw the perpetration of numerous war crimes including the systematic massacre and starvation of civilians and [[prisoners of war]]. As the war's tide increasingly turned against Japan, Tojo was forced to resign as Prime Minister on July 22, 1944. After Japan's surrender in September 1945, Tojo was arrested, convicted by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], sentenced to death, and hanged on December 23, 1948.{{sfn|Yenne|p=337}}\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHideki Tojo was born in the [[K\u014djimachi]] district of [[Tokyo]] on December 30, 1884,{{sfn|Gorman|p=43}} as the third son of Hidenori Tojo, a lieutenant general in the Imperial Japanese Army.{{sfn|Butow|p=4}} Under the ''[[bakufu]]'', Japanese society was divided rigidly into four castes; the merchants, artisans, peasants and the [[samurai]]. After the [[Meiji Restoration]], the caste system was abolished in 1871, but the former caste distinctions in many ways persisted afterwards, ensuring that those from the former samurai caste continued to enjoy their traditional prestige.{{sfn|Browne|p=19}} The Tojo family came from the samurai caste, though the Tojo's were relatively lowly warrior retainers for the great ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' (lords) that they had served for generations.{{sfn|Browne|p=11}} Tojo's father was a samurai turned Army officer and his mother was the daughter of a [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] priest, making his family very respectable, but poor.{{sfn|Browne|p=19}}\n\nHideki had an education typical of a Japanese youth in the Meiji era.{{sfn|Browne|pp=14\u201315, 19\u201320}} The purpose of the Meiji educational system was to train the boys to be soldiers as adults, and the message was relentlessly drilled into Japanese students that war was the most beautiful thing in the entire world, that the Emperor was a living god and that the greatest honor for a Japanese man was to die for the Emperor.{{sfn|Browne|pp=19\u201320}} Japanese girls were taught that the highest honor for a woman was to have as many sons as possible who could die for the Emperor in war. As a boy, Tojo was known for his stubbornness, lack of a sense of humor, for being an opinionated and combative youth fond of getting into fights with the other boys and for his tenacious way of pursuing what he wanted.{{sfn|Browne|p=20}} Japanese schools in the Meiji era were very competitive, and there was no tradition of sympathy for failure; those who did so were often bullied by the teachers.{{sfn|Browne|p=20}} Tojo was of average intelligence, but was known to compensate for his limited intelligence with a willingness to work extremely hard.{{sfn|Browne|p=20}} Tojo's boyhood hero was the 17th-century shogun [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] who issued the injunction: \"Avoid the things you like, turn your attention to unpleasant duties\".{{sfn|Browne|p=20}} Tojo liked to say: \"I am just an ordinary man possessing no shining talents. Anything I have achieved I owe to my capacity for hard work and never giving up\".{{sfn|Browne|p=20}}\n\n[[File:Young Tojo.JPG|thumb|Young Hideki Tojo]]\nIn 1899, Hideki entered the Army Cadet School. When he graduated from the Japanese Military Academy (ranked 10th of 363 cadets){{citation needed|date=November 2011}} in March 1905, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the infantry of the IJA. In 1905, Tojo shared in the general outrage in Japan at the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]], which ended the [[Russo-Japanese War|war with Russia]], and which the Japanese people saw as a betrayal as the war did not end with Japan annexing [[Siberia]] as popular opinion had demanded.{{sfn|Browne|pp=23\u201324}} The Treaty of Portsmouth was so unpopular that it set off anti-American riots known as the [[Hibiya incendiary incident]] as many Japanese were enraged at the way the Americans had apparently cheated Japan as the Japanese gains in the treaty were far less than what public opinion had expected. Very few Japanese at the time had understood that the war with Russia had pushed their nation to the verge of bankruptcy, and most people in Japan believed that the American president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] who had mediated the Treaty of Portsmouth had cheated Japan out of its rightful gains.{{sfn|Browne|p=24}} Tojo's anger at the Treaty of Portsmouth left him with an abiding dislike of Americans.{{sfn|Browne|p=24}}\n\nIn 1909, Hideki married Katsuko Ito, with whom he had three sons (Hidetake, Teruo, and Toshio) and four daughters (Mitsue, Makie, Sachie and Kimie).{{sfn|Baudot|p=455}}<ref>Courtney Browne, ''Tojo: The Last Banzai'', Angus & Robertson, 1967, pp. 170\u2013171</ref> In 1918\u201319, Tojo briefly served in Siberia as part of the Japanese expeditionary force sent to intervene in the [[Russian Civil War]].{{sfn|Browne|p=27}} Tojo served as Japanese military attache to Germany between 1919-1922.{{sfn|Browne|p=28}} As the Imperial Japanese Army had been trained by a German military mission in the 19th century, the Japanese Army was always very strongly influenced by intellectual developments in the German Army, and Tojo was no exception.{{sfn|Browne|pp=28\u201329}} In the 1920s, the German military favored preparing for the next war by creating a totalitarian ''Wehrstaat'' (Defense State), an idea that was taken up by the Japanese military as the \"national defense state\". In 1922, on his way home to Japan, Tojo took a train ride across the United States, his first and only visit to America, which left him with the impression that the Americans were a materialistic \"soft\" people devoted only to making money and to hedonistic pursuits like sex, partying and (despite [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]) drinking.{{sfn|Browne|p=29}}\n\nTojo boasted that his only hobby was his work, and he customarily brought home his paperwork to work late into the night, and he refused to have any part in raising his children, which he viewed both as a distraction from his work and a woman's work, having his wife do all the work of taking care of his children.{{sfn|Browne|p=29-30}} A stern, humorless man, Tojo was known for his brusque manner, his obsession with etiquette, and for his coldness.{{sfn|Browne|p=30}} Like almost all Japanese officers at the time, Tojo routinely slapped the faces of the men under his command when giving orders, saying that face-slapping was a \"means of training\" men who came from families that were not part of the samurai caste, and for whom ''bushido'' was not second nature.{{sfn|Browne|p=40}}\n\nIn 1924, Tojo was greatly offended by the [[Immigration Act of 1924|Immigration Control Act]] passed by the American Congress banning all Asian immigration into the United States with many Congressmen and Senators openly saying the act was necessary because the Asians worked harder than whites.{{sfn|Browne|p=30}} Tojo wrote with bitterness at the time that American whites would never accept Asians as equals and \"It [the Immigration Control Act] shows how the strong will always put their own interests first. Japan, too, has to be strong to survive in the world\".{{sfn|Browne|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nBy 1928, he was bureau chief of the Japanese Army and was shortly thereafter promoted to colonel. He began to take an interest in militarist politics during his command of the 8th Infantry Regiment. Reflecting the imagery often used in Japan to describe people in power, Tojo told his officers that they were to be both a \"father\" and a \"mother\" to the men under their command.{{sfn|Browne|p=40}} Tojo often visited the homes of the men under his command, assisted his men with personal problems and made loans to officers short of money.{{sfn|Browne|pp=40\u201341}} Like many other Japanese officers, Tojo disliked Western cultural influence in Japan, which was often disparaged as resulting in the [[Ero guro|ero-guro-nansensu]] (\"eroticism, grotesquerie and nonsense\") movement as he complained about such forms of \"Western decadence\" like young couples holding hands and kissing in public, which were undermining traditional values necessary to uphold the ''[[kokutai]]''.{{sfn|Browne|pp=47\u201348}}\n\n== Army career ==\n=== As major general ===\n[[File:Hideki Tojo posing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]]\ncashteam_marcus is the best bassketball prayer you see playing known go watch he will impress you\nIn 1934, Hideki was promoted to [[major general]] and served as Chief of the Personnel Department within the [[Minister of War of Japan|Army Ministry]].{{sfn|Fredrikson|p=507}} Tojo wrote a chapter in the book ''Hij\u014dji kokumin zensh\u016b'' (''Essays in time of national emergency''), a book published in March 1934 by the Army Ministry calling for Japan to become a totalitarian \"national defense state\".{{sfn|Bix|p=277}} This book of 15 essays by senior generals argued that Japan had defeated Russia in the war of 1904\u201305 because ''bushid\u014d'' had given the Japanese superior willpower as the Japanese did not fear death unlike the Russians who wanted to live, and what was needed to win the inevitable next war (against precisely whom the book did not say) was to repeat the example of the Russian-Japanese war on a much greater scale by creating the \"national defense state\" that would mobilize the entire nation for war.{{sfn|Bix|p=277}} In his essay Tojo wrote \"The modern war of national defense extends over a great many areas\" requiring \"a state that can monolithically control\" all aspects of the nation in the political, social and economic spheres.{{sfn|Bix|pp=277\u2013278}} Tojo attacked Britain, France and the United States for waging \"ideological war\" against Japan since 1919.{{sfn|Bix|p=278}} Tojo ended his essay stating that Japan must stand tall \"and spread its own moral principles to the world\" as the \"cultural and ideological war of the 'imperial way' is about to begin\".{{sfn|Bix|p=277}}\n\nTojo was appointed commander of the IJA 24th Infantry Brigade in August 1934.{{sfn|Lamont-Brown|p=65}} In September 1935, Tojo assumed top command of the [[Kenpeitai]] of the [[Kwantung Army]] in [[Manchuria]]. Politically, he was nationalist, and militarist, and was nicknamed {{nihongo|\"Razor\"|\u30ab\u30df\u30bd\u30ea|Kamisori}}, for his reputation of having a sharp and legalistic mind capable of quick decision-making. Tojo was a member of the ''[[T\u014dseiha]]'' (\"Control\") faction in the Army that was opposed by the more radical ''[[Imperial Way Faction|K\u014dd\u014dha]]'' (\"Imperial Way\") faction.{{sfn|Bix|p=244}} Both the ''T\u014dseiha'' and the ''K\u014dd\u014dha'' factions were militaristic groups that favored a policy of expansionism abroad and dictatorship under the Emperor at home, but differed over the best way of achieving these goals.{{sfn|Bix|p=244}} The Imperial Way faction wanted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] to achieve a [[Sh\u014dwa Restoration]]; emphasised \"spirit\" as the principle war-winning factor; and despite advocating socialist policies at home wanted to invade the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Bix|p=244}} The Control faction, while being willing to use assassination to achieve its goals, was more willing to work within the system to achieve reforms; wanted to create the \"national defense state\" to mobilize the entire nation before going to war; and, while not rejecting the idea of \"spirit\" as a war-winning factor also saw military modernization as a war-winning factor; and saw the United States as a future enemy just as much as the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Bix|p=244}}\n\nDuring the [[February 26 Incident|February 26 coup attempt]] of 1936, Tojo and [[Shigeru Honj\u014d]], a noted supporter of [[Sadao Araki]], both opposed the rebels who were associated with the rival \"Imperial Way\" faction.{{sfn|Takemae & Ricketts|p=221}} Emperor [[Hirohito]] himself was outraged at the attacks on his close advisers, and after a brief political crisis and stalling on the part of a sympathetic military, the rebels were forced to surrender. As the commander of the ''Kenpeitai'', Tojo ordered the arrest of all officers in the Kwantung Army suspected of supporting the coup attempt in Tokyo.{{sfn|Browne|p=59}} In the aftermath, the T\u014dseiha faction was able to purge the Army of radical officers, and the coup leaders were tried and executed. Following the purge, T\u014dseiha and K\u014dd\u014dha elements were unified in their nationalist but highly anti-political stance under the banner of the T\u014dseiha military clique, with Tojo in the leadership position.\n\nTojo was promoted to [[chief of staff (military)|Chief of staff]] of the Kwangtung Army in 1937.{{sfn|Dear & Foot|p=872}} As the \"[[Manchukuo|Empire of Manchukuo]]\" was, in reality, a Japanese colony in all but name, the Kwangtung Army's duties were just as much political as they were military.{{sfn|Browne|p=60}} During this period, Tojo become close to [[Y\u014dsuke Matsuoka]], the fiery ultra-nationalist CEO of the [[South Manchuria Railway]], one of Asia's largest corporations at the time, and [[Nobusuke Kishi]], the Deputy Minister of Industry in Manchukuo, who was the man ''de facto'' in charge of Manchukuo's economy.{{sfn|Browne|p=60}} Though Tojo regarded preparing for a war with the Soviet Union as his first duty, Tojo also supported the forward policy in north China as the Japanese sought to extend their influence into China.{{sfn|Browne|p=60}} As chief of staff, Tojo was responsible for the military operations designed to increase Japanese penetration into the [[Inner Mongolia]] border regions with [[Manchukuo]].

Tojo received [[Jew]]ish refugees in accordance with Japanese national policy and rejected the resulting Nazi German protests.{{sfn|Goodman & Miyazawa|p=113}} Tojo was recalled to Japan in May 1938 to serve as Vice-Minister of War under [[Ministry of War of Japan|Army Minister]] [[Seishir\u014d Itagaki]].{{sfn|Kato|p=127}} From December 1938 to 1940, Tojo was Inspector-General of Army Aviation.{{sfn|''The New International Year Book''|p=320}}\n\n== Political career ==\n=== Rise to Prime Minister ===\nOn June 1, 1940, the Showa Emperor appointed [[K\u014dichi Kido]], a leading \"reform bureaucrat\" as the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, making him into the Emperor's leading political advisor and fixer.{{sfn|Bix|p=370}} Kido had aided in the creation in the 1930s of an alliance between the \"reform bureaucrats\" and the \"Control\" faction in the Army, which was headed by General Mut\u014d Akira and General Tojo.{{sfn|Bix|p=370}} Kido's appointment also favored the rise of his allies in the Control faction.{{sfn|Bix|pp=370\u2013371}} On July 30, 1940, Hideki Tojo was appointed Army Minister in the second [[Fumimaro Konoe]] regime and remained in that post in the third Konoe cabinet. Prince Konoe had chosen Tojo\u2014a man representative of both the Army's hardline views and the Control faction while being considered reasonable to deal with\u2014to secure the Army's backing for his foreign policy.{{sfn|Bix|p=373}} Tojo was a militant ultra-nationalist, well respected for his work ethic and his ability to handle paperwork, who believed that the Emperor was a living god and favored \"direct imperial rule\", ensuring that he would faithfully follow any order from the Emperor.{{sfn|Bix|p=373}} Konoe favored having Germany mediate an end to the Sino-Japanese war, pressuring Britain to end its economic and military support of China even at the risk of war, seeking better relations with both Germany and the United States, and of taking advantage of the changes in the international order caused by Germany's victories in the spring of 1940 to make Japan a stronger power in Asia.{{sfn|Bix|pp=373\u2013374}} Konoe wanted to make Japan the dominant power in East Asia, but he also believed it was possible to negotiate a ''modus vivendi'' with the United States under which the Americans would agree to recognize the \"[[Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere]]\".{{sfn|Bix|pp=373\u2013374}}\n\nBy 1940, Konoe, who had started the war with China in 1937, no longer believed that a military solution to the \"China Affair\" was possible as he once did, instead favored having Germany mediate an end to the war that would presumably result in a pro-Japanese peace settlement, but would be less than he himself had outlined in the \"Konoe programme\" of January 1938.{{sfn|Bix|p=373}} For this reason, Konoe wanted Tojo, a tough general whose ultra-nationalism was beyond question, to provide \"cover\" for his attempt to seek a diplomatic solution to the war with China.{{sfn|Bix|p=373}} Tojo was a strong supporter of the [[Tripartite Pact]] between Imperial Japan, [[Nazi Germany]], and [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]]. As the Army Minister, he continued to expand the war with China.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} After negotiations with [[Vichy France]], Japan was given permission to place its troops in the southern part of [[French Indochina]] in July 1941. In spite of its formal recognition of the Vichy government, the United States retaliated against Japan by imposing [[economic sanctions]] in August, including a total embargo on oil and gasoline exports.{{sfn|Toland|p={{page needed|date=November 2011}} }} On September 6, a deadline of early October was fixed in the [[Gozen Kaigi|Imperial Conference]] for resolving the situation diplomatically. On October 14, the deadline had passed with no progress. Prime Minister Konoe then held his last cabinet meeting, where Tojo did most of the talking:\n\n{{quote |\nFor the past six months, ever since April, the foreign minister has made painstaking efforts to adjust relations. Although I respect him for that, we remain deadlocked&nbsp;... The heart of the matter is the imposition on us of withdrawal from Indochina and China&nbsp;... If we yield to America's demands, it will destroy the fruits of the China incident. Manchukuo will be endangered and our control of Korea undermined.{{sfn|Bix|p=417}}\n}}\n\nThe prevailing opinion within the Japanese Army at that time was that continued negotiations could be dangerous. However, Hirohito thought that he might be able to control extreme opinions in the army by using the charismatic and well-connected Tojo, who had expressed reservations regarding war with the West, although the Emperor himself was skeptical that Tojo would be able to avoid conflict. On October 13, he declared to [[K\u014dichi Kido]]: \"There seems little hope in the present situation for the Japan-U.S. negotiations. This time, if hostilities erupt, I have to issue a declaration of war.\"{{sfn|Kido|p=914}} During the last cabinet meetings of the Konoe government, Tojo emerged as a hawkish voice, saying he did not want a war with the United States but portrayed the Americans as arrogant, bullying white supremacists. He said that any compromise solution would only encourage them to make more extreme demands on Japan, in which case Japan might be better to choose war to uphold national honor.{{sfn|Bix|pp=417\u2013418}} Despite saying he favored peace, Tojo had often declared at cabinet meetings that any withdrawal from French Indochina and/or China would be damaging to military morale and might threaten the ''kokutai''; the \"China Incident\" could not be resolved via diplomacy and required a military solution; and attempting to compromise with the Americans would be seen as weakness by them.{{sfn|Bix|p=416}}\n\nOn October 16, Konoe, politically isolated and convinced that the Emperor no longer trusted him, resigned. Later, he justified himself to his chief cabinet secretary, Kenji Tomita:\n\n{{quote |\nOf course His Majesty is a pacifist, and there is no doubt he wished to avoid war. When I told him that to initiate war is a mistake, he agreed. But the next day, he would tell me: \"You were worried about it yesterday, but you do not have to worry so much.\" Thus, gradually, he began to lean toward war. And the next time I met him, he leaned even more toward war. In short, I felt the Emperor was telling me: \"My prime minister does not understand military matters, I know much more.\" In short, the Emperor had absorbed the views of the army and navy high commands.{{sfn|Fujiwara|p=126}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Tojo2.jpg|thumb|upright|Hideki Tojo in military uniform]]\n[[File:Hideki Tojo posing cropped2.png|170px|thumb]]\nAt the time, [[Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni]] was said to be the only person who could control the Army and the Navy and was recommended by Konoe and Tojo as Konoe's replacement. Hirohito rejected this option, arguing that a member of the imperial family should not have to eventually carry the responsibility for a war against the West as a defeat would ruin the prestige of the House of Yamato.{{sfn|Bix|p=418}} Following the advice of K\u014dichi Kido, he chose instead Tojo, who was known for his devotion to the imperial institution.{{sfn|Bix|p=418}}{{sfn|Terasaki|p=118}} Tojo's first speech on the radio made a call for \"world peace\", but also stated his determination to settle the \"China Affair\" on Japanese terms and to achieve the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" that would unite all of the Asian nations together.{{sfn|Browne|p=107}} Tojo was known to advocate war with the United States, and Prince Takamatsu wrote in his diary about hearing of the appointment: \"We have finally committed to war and now must do all we can to launch it powerfully. But we have clumsily telegraphed our intentions. We needn't have signaled what we're going to do; having [the entire Konoe cabinet] resign was too much. As matters stand now we can merely keep silent and without the least effort war will begin.\"{{sfn|Bix|p=419}} The Emperor summoned Tojo to the Imperial Palace one day before Tojo took office.{{sfn|Bix|p=418}} During the meetings of the senior statesmen to decide who was to succeed Prince Konoe, the former Prime Minister Admiral [[Keisuke Okada]] was opposed to Tojo as Prime Minister, while the powerful Lord Privy Seal [[K\u014dichi Kido]] pushed for Tojo, leading a compromise where Tojo would become Prime Minister while \"re-examining\" the options for dealing with the crisis with the United States, though Kido did not say that Tojo would attempt to avoid a war.{{sfn|Bix|pp=418\u2013419}} By tradition, the Emperor needed a consensus among the elder statesmen before appointing a prime minister, and as long as Admiral Okada was opposed to Tojo, it would be impolitic for the Emperor to appoint him as Prime Minister.{{sfn|Bix|pp=418\u2013419}}\n\nTojo wrote in his diary: \"I thought I was summoned because the Emperor was angry at my opinion.\" He was given one order from the Emperor: to make a policy review of what had been sanctioned by the Imperial Conferences.{{sfn|Bix|p=418-419}} Tojo, who was on the side of war, nevertheless accepted this order, and pledged to obey. According to Colonel Akiho Ishii, a member of the Army General Staff, the Prime Minister showed a true sense of loyalty to the emperor performing this duty. For example, when Ishii received from Hirohito a communication saying the Army should drop the idea of stationing troops in China to counter the military operations of the Western powers, he wrote a reply for the Prime Minister for his audience with the Emperor. Tojo then replied to Ishii: \"If the Emperor said it should be so, then that's it for me. One cannot recite arguments to the Emperor. You may keep your finely phrased memorandum.\"{{sfn|Wetzler|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nOn November 2, Tojo and Chiefs of Staff [[Hajime Sugiyama]] and [[Osami Nagano]] reported to Hirohito that the review had been in vain. The Emperor then gave his consent to war.{{sfn|Wetzler|pp=47\u201350}}{{sfn|Bix|p=421}} The next day, Fleet Admiral [[Osami Nagano]] explained in detail the Pearl Harbor attack plan to Hirohito.{{sfn|Wetzler|pp=29, 35}} The eventual plan drawn up by Army and Navy Chiefs of Staff envisaged such a mauling of the Western powers that Japanese defense perimeter lines\u2014operating on interior lines of communications and inflicting heavy Western casualties\u2014could not be breached. In addition, the Japanese fleet which attacked Pearl Harbor was under orders from Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] to be prepared to return to Japan on a moment's notice, should negotiations succeed.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Two days later, on November 5, Hirohito approved the operations plan for a war against the West and continued to hold meetings with the military and Tojo until the end of the month. On November 26, 1941, the American Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] handed Ambassador Nomura and Kurusu Saburo in Washington a \"draft mutual declaration of policy\" and \"Outline of Proposed Basis for Agreement between the United States and Japan\".{{sfn|Bix|p=428}} Hull proposed that Japan \"withdraw all military, naval, air and police forces\" from China and French Indochina in exchange for lifting the oil embargo, but left the term China undefined.{{sfn|Bix|p=428}} The \"[[Hull note]]\" as it is known in Japan made it clear the United States would not recognise the puppet government of Wang Jingwei as the government of China, but strongly implied that the United States might recognise the \"Empire of Manchukuo\"{{Opinion|date=April 2019}} and did not impose a deadline for the Japanese withdrawal from China.{{sfn|Bix|p=428}} On November 27, 1941, Tojo chose to misrepresent the \"Hull note\" to the Cabinet as an \"ultimatum to Japan\", which was incorrect as the \"Hull note\" did not have a timeline for its acceptance and was marked \"tentative\" in the opening sentence, which is inconsistent with an ultimatum.{{sfn|Bix|p=428}} The claim that the Americans had demanded in the \"Hull note\" Japanese withdrawal from all of China, instead of just the parts occupied since 1937 and together with the claim the note was an ultimatum was used as one of the principal excuses for choosing war with the United States.{{sfn|Bix|p=428-431}} On December 1, another conference finally sanctioned the \"war against the United States, England, and the Netherlands\".{{sfn|Wetzler|pp=28\u201330, 39}}\n\n=== As Prime Minister ===\n[[File:Hideki Tojo lands in Manila.jpg|thumb|Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo landed in [[Nichols Field]], an airfield south of Manila, for a state visit to the Philippines.]]\n\nOn December 7, 1941, Tojo went on Japanese radio to announce that Japan was now at war with the United States, the British Empire and the Netherlands, reading out an Imperial Rescript that ended with the playing of the popular martial song ''[[Umi Yukaba]]'' (''Across the Sea''), which set to music a popular war poem from the classic collection ''[[Many\u014dsh\u016b]]'', featuring the lyrics \"Across the sea, corpses soaking in the water, Across the mountains corpses heaped up in the grass, We shall die by the side of our lord, We shall never look back\".{{sfn|Dower|p=25}} Tojo continued to hold the position of Army Minister during his term as Prime Minister from October 17, 1941, to July 22, 1944.

As Home Minister, he ordered various [[Eugenics in Japan|eugenics]] measures (including the sterilization of the \"mentally unfit\").\n\nTojo had popular support in the early years of the war as Japanese forces moved from one victory to another. In March 1942, Tojo in his capacity as Army Minister gave permission for the Japanese Army in Taiwan to ship 50 \"[[comfort women]]\" from Taiwan to Borneo without ID papers (his approval was necessary as the Army's rules forbade people without ID traveling to the new conquests).{{sfn|Yoshimi|pp=81\u201383}} The Japanese historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi noted this document proves that Tojo was aware of and approved of the \"comfort women\" corps.{{sfn|Yoshimi|pp=81\u201383}} On April 18, 1942, the Americans staged the [[Doolittle Raid]], bombing Tokyo.{{sfn|Bix|p=448}} Some of the American planes were shot down and their pilots taken prisoner.{{sfn|Bix|p=448}} The Army General Staff led by Field Marshal [[Hajime Sugiyama]] insisted on executing the eight American fliers, but were opposed by Tojo, who feared that the Americans would retaliate against Japanese POWs if the Doolittle fliers were executed.{{sfn|Bix|p=448}} The dispute was resolved by the Emperor who commuted the death sentences of five fliers while allowing the other three to die, for reasons that remain unclear as the documents relating to the Emperor's intervention were burned in 1945.{{sfn|Bix|p=448}}\n\nAs the Japanese went from victory to victory, Tojo and the rest of the Japanese elite were gripped by what the Japanese called \"[[victory disease]]\" as the entire elite was caught up in a state of hubris, believing Japan was invincible and the war was as good as won.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=329}} By May 1942, Tojo approved a set of \"non-negotiable\" demands to be presented once the Allies sued for peace that allowed Japan to keep everything it already conquered while assuming possession of considerably more. {{sfn|Weinberg|p=329}} Under such demands, Japan would assume control of the following territories:\n*the British Crown colonies of India and Honduras well as the British dominions of Australia, Australian New Guinea, Ceylon, New Zealand, British Columbia and the Yukon Territory \n*the American state of Washington, Alaska and Hawaii\n*most of Latin America including Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti and the rest of the West Indies.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=329}} \n\nAdditionally, Tojo wanted all of China to be under the rule of the puppet [[Wang Jingwei]], planned to buy Macau and East Timor from Portugal and to create new puppet kingdoms in Burma, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Malaya.{{sfn|Weinberg|pp=329\u2013330}} As the Burmese had proved to be enthusiastic collaborators in the \"New Order in Asia\", the new Burmese kingdom would be allowed to annex much of north-east India as a reward.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=330}} The Navy for its part demanded that Japan take New Caledonia, Fiji, and Samoa.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=330}}\n\nWhile Tojo was prime minister, the main forum for military decision-making was the Imperial General Headquarters presided over by the Emperor. It consisted of the Army and Navy ministers; the Army and Navy chiefs of staff; and chiefs of the military affairs bureaus in both services.{{sfn|Falk|p=511}} The Imperial GHQ was not a joint chiefs of staff as existed in the United States and United Kingdom, but rather two separate services command operating under the same roof who would meet about twice a week to attempt to agree on a common strategy.{{sfn|Falk|pp=511\u2013512}} The Operations Bureaus of the Army and Navy would develop their own plans and then attempt to \"sell them\" to the other, which was often not possible.{{sfn|Falk|p=512}} Tojo was one voice out of many speaking at the Imperial GHQ, and was not able to impose his will on the Navy, which he had to negotiate with, like he was dealing with an ally.{{sfn|Falk|p=512}} The American historian Stanley Falk described the Japanese system as characterized by \"bitter inter-service antagonisms\" as the Army and Navy worked \"at cross-purposes\", observing the Japanese system of command was \"uncoordinated, ill-defined and inefficient\".{{sfn|Falk|p=518}}\n\n[[File:Cabinet of Hideki Tojo 3.jpg|thumb|Cabinet ministers of the first Tojo Cabinet, October 1941]]\nHowever, after the [[Battle of Midway]], with the tide of war turning against Japan, Tojo faced increasing opposition from within the government and military. In August\u2013September 1942, a major crisis gripped the Tojo cabinet when the Foreign Minister [[Shigenori T\u014dg\u014d]] objected quite violently on August 29, 1942 to the Prime Minister's plan to establish a Greater East Asia Ministry to handle relations with the puppet regimes in Asia as an insult to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (the ''Gaimusho'') and threatened to resign in protest.{{sfn|Bix|p=457}} Tojo went to see the Emperor, who backed the Prime Minister's plans for the Greater East Asia Ministry, and on September 1, 1942 Tojo told the cabinet he was establishing the Greater East Asia Ministry and could not care less about how the ''Gaimusho'' felt about the issue, leading T\u014dg\u014d to resign in protest.{{sfn|Bix|p=457}} The American historian Herbert Bix wrote that Tojo was a \"dictator\" only in the narrow sense that from September 1942 on, he was generally able to impose his will on the Cabinet without seeking a consensus, but at same time noted that Tojo's authority was based upon the support of the Emperor, who held ultimate power.{{sfn|Bix|p=457}} In November 1942, Tojo, as Army Minister, was involved in drafting the regulations for taking \"comfort women\" from China, Japan (which included Taiwan and Korea at this time) and Manchukuo to the \"South\", as the Japanese called their conquests in South-East Asia, to ensure that the \"comfort women\" had the proper papers before departing. Until then the War Ministry required special permission to take \"comfort women\" without papers, and Tojo was tired of dealing with these requests.{{sfn|Yoshimi|p=83}} At the same time, Tojo, as the Army Minister, became involved in a clash with the Army chief of staff over whether to continue the battle of Guadalcanal or not. Tojo sacked the Operations office and his deputy at the general staff, who were opposed to withdrawing, and ordered the abandonment of the island.{{sfn|Falk|p=510}}\n\n[[File:\u6c6a\u7cbe\u536b\u89c1\u4e1c\u6761\u82f1\u673a.jpg|thumb|[[Wang Jingwei]] of the Japanese-sponsored [[Wang Jingwei Government|puppet government in Nanjing]] meeting with Tojo in 1942]]\nIn September 1943, the Emperor and Tojo agreed that Japan would pull back to an \"absolute defense line\" in the south-west Pacific to stem the American advance, and considered abandoning Rabaul base, but changed their minds in face of objections from the Navy.{{sfn|Bix|p=467-468}} In November 1943, the American public's reaction to the [[Battle of Tarawa]] led Tojo to view Tarawa as a sort of Japanese victory, believing that more battles like Tarawa would break American morale, and force the U.S. to sue for peace.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=348}} Moreover, Tojo believed that the Americans would become bogged down in the Marshalls, giving more time to strengthen the defenses in the Marianas.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=348}} In late 1943, with the support of the Emperor, Tojo made a major effort to make peace with China to free up the 2 million Japanese soldiers in China for operations elsewhere, but the unwillingness of the Japanese to give up any of their \"rights and interests\" in China doomed the effort.{{sfn|Bix|p=473}} China was by far the largest theater of operations for Japan, and with the Americans steadily advancing in the Pacific, Tojo was anxious to end the quagmire of the \"China affair\" to redeploy Japanese forces.{{sfn|Bix|p=473}} In an attempt to enlist support from all of Asia, especially China, Tojo opened the [[Greater East Asia Conference]] in November 1943, which issued a set of Pan-Asian war aims, which made little impression on most Asians.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=498}} On January 9, 1944, Japan signed a treaty with the puppet Wang regime under which Japan gave up its extraterritorial rights in China as part of a bid to win Chinese public opinion over to a pro-Japanese viewpoint, but as the treaty changed nothing in practice, the gambit failed.{{sfn|Bix|pp=473\u2013474}} At the same time as he sought a diplomatic effort to end the war with China, Tojo also approved of the planning for [[Operation Ichi-Go]], a huge offensive against China intended to take the American air bases in China and finally knock China out of the war once and for all.{{sfn|Bix|p=474}} In January 1944, Tojo approved of orders issued by Imperial General Headquarters for an invasion of India, where the Burma Area Army in Burma under General [[Masakazu Kawabe]] was to seize the Manipour and Assam provinces with the aim of cutting off American aid to China (the railroad that supplied the American air bases in north-east India that allowed for supplies to be flown over \"[[the Hump]]\" of the Himalayas to China passed through these provinces).{{sfn|Weinberg|pp=640\u2013641}} Cutting off American aid to China in turn might have the effect of forcing Chiang Kai-shek to sue for peace. Following the 15th Army into India in the U-Go offensive were the Indian nationalist [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] and his Indian National Army, as the political purpose of the operation was to provoke a general uprising against British rule in India that might allow the Japanese to take all of India.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=641}} The roads necessary to properly supply the 150,000 Japanese soldiers committed to invading India would turn into mud when the monsoons arrived, giving the Japanese a very short period of time to break through.

A similar number had starved to death or died of diseases as the logistics to support an invasion of India were lacking, once the monsoons turned the roads of Burma into impassable mud.{{sfn|Bix|p=475}} Of the 150,000 Japanese soldiers who had participated in the March invasion of India, most were dead by July 1944.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=642}}\n\nIn parallel with the invasion of India, in April 1944 Tojo began [[Operation Ichi-Go|Operation Ichigo]], the largest Japanese offensive of the entire war, with the aim of taking southern China.{{sfn|Bix|p=474}}\n\nIn the [[Battle of Saipan]], about 70,000 Japanese soldiers, sailors, and civilians were killed in June\u2013July 1944 and in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] the Imperial Navy suffered a crushing defeat.{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} The first day of the Battle of the Philippine Sea, June 19, 1944, was dubbed by the Americans \"the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\" as over the course of the dogfights in the air, the United States Navy lost 30 planes while shooting down about 350 Imperial Japanese planes, in one of the Imperial Navy's most humiliating defeats.{{sfn|Willmott|p=208}} The Japanese believed that indoctrination in ''bushido'' (\"the way of the warrior\") would give them the edge as the Japanese longed to die for the Emperor, while the Americans were afraid to die, but superior American pilot training and airplanes meant the Japanese were hopelessly outclassed by the Americans.{{sfn|Willmott|p=208}} With Saipan in American hands, the Americans could take other islands in the Marianas to build airbases.{{sfn|Willmott|p=213}} The establishment of American bases in the Marianas meant the cities of Japan were within the range of B-29 Superfortress bombers and the British historian H. P. Willmott noted that \"even the most hard-headed of the Japanese militarists could dimly perceive that Japan would be at the end of her tether in that case\".{{sfn|Willmott|p=213}} As the news of the disastrous defeat suffered at Saipan reached Japan, it turned elite opinion against the Tojo government.{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} The Emperor himself was furious about the defeat at Saipan; had called a meeting of the Board of Field Marshals and Fleet Admirals to see if were possible to recapture Saipan (it was not); and Prince Takamatsu wrote in his diary \"he flares up frequently\".{{sfn|Bix|p=477}} Tojo was the Prime Minister, Minister of War and Chief of the Army General Staff, and was seen both in Japan and in the US as, in words of Willmott, \"the embodiment of national determination, hardline nationalism and militarism\".{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} Prince Konoe and Admiral Okada had long been plotting to bring down the Tojo government since the spring of 1943, and their principal problem had been the support of the Emperor, who did not wish to lose his favorite Prime Minister.{{sfn|Bix|p=478}}\n\nAfter the Battle of Saipan, it was clear to at least some of the Japanese elite that the war was lost, and Japan needed to make peace before the ''[[kokutai]]'' and perhaps even the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]] itself was destroyed.{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} Tojo had been so demonized in the United States during the war that, for the American people, Tojo was the face of Japanese militarism, and it was inconceivable that the United States would make peace with a government headed by Tojo.{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} Willmott noted that an additional problem for the \"peace faction\" was that: \"Tojo was an embodiment of ''mainstream opinion'' within the nation, the armed services and particularly the Army. Tojo had powerful support, and by Japanese standards, he was not extreme.\"{{sfn|Willmott|pp=216\u2013217}} Tojo was more of a follower than a leader, and he represented mainstream opinion in the Army, and so his removal from office would not mean the end of the political ambitions of an Army still fanatically committed to victory or death.{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} The ''jushin'' (elder statesmen) had advised the Emperor that Tojo needed to go after Saipan and further advised the Emperor against partial changes in the cabinet, demanding that the entire Tojo cabinet resign.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Tojo, aware of the intrigues to bring him down, had sought the public approval of the Emperor, which was denied, with the Emperor sending him a message to the effect that the man responsible for the disaster of Saipan was not worthy of his approval.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Tojo suggested reorganizing his cabinet to regain Imperial approval, and was rebuffed with the Emperor saying the entire cabinet had to go.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Once it was clear that Tojo no longer had the support of the Chrysanthemum Throne, Tojo's enemies had little trouble bringing down his government.{{sfn|Bix|p=478}} The politically powerful Lord Privy Seal, Marquis [[K\u014dichi Kido]] spread the word that the Emperor no longer supported Tojo.{{sfn|Bix|p=478}} After the [[fall of Saipan]], he was forced to resign on July 18, 1944.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} The ''jushin'' advised the Emperor to appoint a former Prime Minister, Admiral [[Mitsumasa_Yonai|Mitsumasa Yonai]] as Prime Minister as he was popular with the Navy, the diplomatic corps, the bureaucracy and the \"peace faction\", but Yonai refused to serve, knowing full well that a Prime Minister who attempted to make peace with the Americans might be assassinated as many Army officers were still committed to victory or death and regarded any talk of peace as treason.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Admiral Yonai stated that only another general could serve as Prime Minister, and advised General [[Kuniaki_Koiso|Kuniaki Koiso]] should serve as Prime Minister.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} At a conference with the Emperor, Koiso and Yonai were told by the Emperor to co-operate in forming a government without saying who was to be the new Prime Minister.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} As the Emperor was worshiped as a living god, neither Yonai and Koiso could ask him who was to be the Prime Minister, as one does not ask questions of a god, and after the meeting, both men were very confused as to which of the two was now the Prime Minister.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Finally, the Lord Privy Seal, K\u014dichi Kido resolved the muddle by saying Koiso was the Prime Minister.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Two days after Tojo resigned, the Emperor gave him an imperial rescript offering him unusually lavish praise for his \"meritorious services and hard work\" and declaring \"Hereafter we expect you to live up to our trust and make even greater contributions to military affairs\".{{sfn|Bix|p=478}}\n\n== Arrest, trial, and execution ==\n[[File:Tojo suicide.jpg|thumb|Hideki Tojo after his attempted suicide during his arrest]]\nAfter [[surrender of Japan|Japan's unconditional surrender]] in 1945, U.S. general [[Douglas MacArthur]] ordered the arrest of forty alleged war criminals, including Tojo. Five American GIs were sent to serve the arrest warrant.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Man Who Captured Tojo|last1=Carola|first1=Chris|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qdh_aqh7TTU}}</ref> As American soldiers surrounded Hideki's house on September 11, he shot himself in the chest with a pistol but missed his heart. As a result of this experience, the Army had medical personnel present during the later arrests of other accused Japanese war criminals, such as [[Shigetar\u014d Shimada]].\n\nAs he bled, Tojo began to talk, and two Japanese reporters recorded his words: \"I am very sorry it is taking me so long to die. The Greater East Asia War was justified and righteous. I am very sorry for the nation and all the races of the Greater Asiatic powers. I wait for the righteous judgment of history. I wished to commit suicide but sometimes that fails.\"{{sfn|Toland|pp=871\u2013872}}\n\nAfter recovering from his injuries, Tojo was moved to [[Sugamo Prison]].

Consequently, now that the war has been lost, it is presumably necessary that I be judged so that the circumstances of the time can be clarified and the future peace of the world be assured. Therefore, with respect to my trial, it is my intention to speak frankly, according to my recollection, even though when the vanquished stands before the victor, who has over him the power of life and death, he may be apt to toady and flatter. I mean to pay considerable attention to this in my actions, and say to the end that what is true is true and what is false is false.

Bix]] and [[John W. Dower]] criticize the work done by General MacArthur and his staff to exonerate Emperor Hirohito and all members of the imperial family from criminal prosecutions. According to them, MacArthur and Brigadier General [[Bonner Fellers]] worked to protect the Emperor and shift ultimate responsibility to Tojo.{{sfn|Bix|pp=583\u2013585}}{{sfn|Dower|pp=324\u2013326}}{{sfn|Yenne|pp=337\u2013338}}\n\nAccording to the written report of Sh\u016bichi Mizota, interpreter for Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai, Fellers met the two men at his office on March 6, 1946, and told Yonai: \"It would be most convenient if the Japanese side could prove to us that the Emperor is completely blameless. I think the forthcoming trials offer the best opportunity to do that. Tojo, in particular, should be made to bear all responsibility at this trial.\"{{sfn|Toyoda|pp=170\u2013172}}{{sfn|Bix|p=584}}\n\nThe sustained intensity of this campaign to protect the Emperor was revealed when, in testifying before the tribunal on December 31, 1947, Tojo momentarily strayed from the agreed-upon line concerning imperial innocence and referred to the Emperor's ultimate authority. The American-led prosecution immediately arranged that he be secretly coached to recant this testimony. [[Ry\u016bkichi Tanaka]], a former general who testified at the trial and had close connections with chief prosecutor [[Joseph B.

politician and [[general officer|general]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) who served as [[Prime Minister of Japan]] and President of the [[Imperial Rule Assistance Association]] for the majority of [[World War II]]. Before becoming Japan's [[head of government]], Tojo was among the most outspoken proponents for [[preventive war]] against the United States during deliberations leading to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Upon becoming Prime Minister in October 17, 1941, he presided over the conquest of much of the West's territories in Asia and the Pacific until the defeat of Japanese forces at [[Battle of Midway|Midway]] and [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal]]. During his years in power, he also oversaw the perpetration of numerous war crimes including the systematic massacre and starvation of civilians and [[prisoners of war]]. As the war's tide increasingly turned against Japan, Tojo was forced to resign as Prime Minister on July 22, 1944. After Japan's surrender in September 1945, Tojo was arrested, convicted by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]], sentenced to death, and hanged on December 23, 1948.{{sfn|Yenne|p=337}}\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHideki Tojo was born in the [[K\u014djimachi]] district of [[Tokyo]] on December 30, 1884,{{sfn|Gorman|p=43}} as the third son of Hidenori Tojo, a lieutenant general in the Imperial Japanese Army.{{sfn|Butow|p=4}} Under the ''[[bakufu]]'', Japanese society was divided rigidly into four castes; the merchants, artisans, peasants and the [[samurai]]. After the [[Meiji Restoration]], the caste system was abolished in 1871, but the former caste distinctions in many ways persisted afterwards, ensuring that those from the former samurai caste continued to enjoy their traditional prestige.{{sfn|Browne|p=19}} The Tojo family came from the samurai caste, though the Tojo's were relatively lowly warrior retainers for the great ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' (lords) that they had served for generations.{{sfn|Browne|p=11}} Tojo's father was a samurai turned Army officer and his mother was the daughter of a [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] priest, making his family very respectable, but poor.{{sfn|Browne|p=19}}\n\nHideki had an education typical of a Japanese youth in the Meiji era.{{sfn|Browne|pp=14\u201315, 19\u201320}} The purpose of the Meiji educational system was to train the boys to be soldiers as adults, and the message was relentlessly drilled into Japanese students that war was the most beautiful thing in the entire world, that the Emperor was a living god and that the greatest honor for a Japanese man was to die for the Emperor.{{sfn|Browne|pp=19\u201320}} Japanese girls were taught that the highest honor for a woman was to have as many sons as possible who could die for the Emperor in war. As a boy, Tojo was known for his stubbornness, lack of a sense of humor, for being an opinionated and combative youth fond of getting into fights with the other boys and for his tenacious way of pursuing what he wanted.{{sfn|Browne|p=20}} Japanese schools in the Meiji era were very competitive, and there was no tradition of sympathy for failure; those who did so were often bullied by the teachers.{{sfn|Browne|p=20}} Tojo was of average intelligence, but was known to compensate for his limited intelligence with a willingness to work extremely hard.{{sfn|Browne|p=20}} Tojo's boyhood hero was the 17th-century shogun [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] who issued the injunction: \"Avoid the things you like, turn your attention to unpleasant duties\".{{sfn|Browne|p=20}} Tojo liked to say: \"I am just an ordinary man possessing no shining talents. Anything I have achieved I owe to my capacity for hard work and never giving up\".{{sfn|Browne|p=20}}\n\n[[File:Young Tojo.JPG|thumb|Young Hideki Tojo]]\nIn 1899, Hideki entered the Army Cadet School. When he graduated from the Japanese Military Academy (ranked 10th of 363 cadets){{citation needed|date=November 2011}} in March 1905, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the infantry of the IJA. In 1905, Tojo shared in the general outrage in Japan at the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]], which ended the [[Russo-Japanese War|war with Russia]], and which the Japanese people saw as a betrayal as the war did not end with Japan annexing [[Siberia]] as popular opinion had demanded.{{sfn|Browne|pp=23\u201324}} The Treaty of Portsmouth was so unpopular that it set off anti-American riots known as the [[Hibiya incendiary incident]] as many Japanese were enraged at the way the Americans had apparently cheated Japan as the Japanese gains in the treaty were far less than what public opinion had expected. Very few Japanese at the time had understood that the war with Russia had pushed their nation to the verge of bankruptcy, and most people in Japan believed that the American president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] who had mediated the Treaty of Portsmouth had cheated Japan out of its rightful gains.{{sfn|Browne|p=24}} Tojo's anger at the Treaty of Portsmouth left him with an abiding dislike of Americans.{{sfn|Browne|p=24}}\n\nIn 1909, Hideki married Katsuko Ito, with whom he had three sons (Hidetake, Teruo, and Toshio) and four daughters (Mitsue, Makie, Sachie and Kimie).{{sfn|Baudot|p=455}}<ref>Courtney Browne, ''Tojo: The Last Banzai'', Angus & Robertson, 1967, pp. 170\u2013171</ref> In 1918\u201319, Tojo briefly served in Siberia as part of the Japanese expeditionary force sent to intervene in the [[Russian Civil War]].{{sfn|Browne|p=27}} Tojo served as Japanese military attache to Germany between 1919-1922.{{sfn|Browne|p=28}} As the Imperial Japanese Army had been trained by a German military mission in the 19th century, the Japanese Army was always very strongly influenced by intellectual developments in the German Army, and Tojo was no exception.{{sfn|Browne|pp=28\u201329}} In the 1920s, the German military favored preparing for the next war by creating a totalitarian ''Wehrstaat'' (Defense State), an idea that was taken up by the Japanese military as the \"national defense state\". In 1922, on his way home to Japan, Tojo took a train ride across the United States, his first and only visit to America, which left him with the impression that the Americans were a materialistic \"soft\" people devoted only to making money and to hedonistic pursuits like sex, partying and (despite [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]) drinking.{{sfn|Browne|p=29}}\n\nTojo boasted that his only hobby was his work, and he customarily brought home his paperwork to work late into the night, and he refused to have any part in raising his children, which he viewed both as a distraction from his work and a woman's work, having his wife do all the work of taking care of his children.{{sfn|Browne|p=29-30}} A stern, humorless man, Tojo was known for his brusque manner, his obsession with etiquette, and for his coldness.{{sfn|Browne|p=30}} Like almost all Japanese officers at the time, Tojo routinely slapped the faces of the men under his command when giving orders, saying that face-slapping was a \"means of training\" men who came from families that were not part of the samurai caste, and for whom ''bushido'' was not second nature.{{sfn|Browne|p=40}}\n\nIn 1924, Tojo was greatly offended by the [[Immigration Act of 1924|Immigration Control Act]] passed by the American Congress banning all Asian immigration into the United States with many Congressmen and Senators openly saying the act was necessary because the Asians worked harder than whites.{{sfn|Browne|p=30}} Tojo wrote with bitterness at the time that American whites would never accept Asians as equals and \"It [the Immigration Control Act] shows how the strong will always put their own interests first. Japan, too, has to be strong to survive in the world\".{{sfn|Browne|pp=33\u201334}}\n\nBy 1928, he was bureau chief of the Japanese Army and was shortly thereafter promoted to colonel. He began to take an interest in militarist politics during his command of the 8th Infantry Regiment. Reflecting the imagery often used in Japan to describe people in power, Tojo told his officers that they were to be both a \"father\" and a \"mother\" to the men under their command.{{sfn|Browne|p=40}} Tojo often visited the homes of the men under his command, assisted his men with personal problems and made loans to officers short of money.{{sfn|Browne|pp=40\u201341}} Like many other Japanese officers, Tojo disliked Western cultural influence in Japan, which was often disparaged as resulting in the [[Ero guro|ero-guro-nansensu]] (\"eroticism, grotesquerie and nonsense\") movement as he complained about such forms of \"Western decadence\" like young couples holding hands and kissing in public, which were undermining traditional values necessary to uphold the ''[[kokutai]]''.{{sfn|Browne|pp=47\u201348}}\n\n== Army career ==\n=== As major general ===\n[[File:Hideki Tojo posing.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Hideki T\u014dj\u014d]]\n\nIn 1934, Hideki was promoted to [[major general]] and served as Chief of the Personnel Department within the [[Minister of War of Japan|Army Ministry]].{{sfn|Fredrikson|p=507}} Tojo wrote a chapter in the book ''Hij\u014dji kokumin zensh\u016b'' (''Essays in time of national emergency''), a book published in March 1934 by the Army Ministry calling for Japan to become a totalitarian \"national defense state\".{{sfn|Bix|p=277}} This book of 15 essays by senior generals argued that Japan had defeated Russia in the war of 1904\u201305 because ''bushid\u014d'' had given the Japanese superior willpower as the Japanese did not fear death unlike the Russians who wanted to live, and what was needed to win the inevitable next war (against precisely whom the book did not say) was to repeat the example of the Russian-Japanese war on a much greater scale by creating the \"national defense state\" that would mobilize the entire nation for war.{{sfn|Bix|p=277}} In his essay Tojo wrote \"The modern war of national defense extends over a great many areas\" requiring \"a state that can monolithically control\" all aspects of the nation in the political, social and economic spheres.{{sfn|Bix|pp=277\u2013278}} Tojo attacked Britain, France and the United States for waging \"ideological war\" against Japan since 1919.{{sfn|Bix|p=278}} Tojo ended his essay stating that Japan must stand tall \"and spread its own moral principles to the world\" as the \"cultural and ideological war of the 'imperial way' is about to begin\".{{sfn|Bix|p=277}}\n\nTojo was appointed commander of the IJA 24th Infantry Brigade in August 1934.{{sfn|Lamont-Brown|p=65}} In September 1935, Tojo assumed top command of the [[Kenpeitai]] of the [[Kwantung Army]] in [[Manchuria]]. Politically, he was nationalist, and militarist, and was nicknamed {{nihongo|\"Razor\"|\u30ab\u30df\u30bd\u30ea|Kamisori}}, for his reputation of having a sharp and legalistic mind capable of quick decision-making. Tojo was a member of the ''[[T\u014dseiha]]'' (\"Control\") faction in the Army that was opposed by the more radical ''[[Imperial Way Faction|K\u014dd\u014dha]]'' (\"Imperial Way\") faction.{{sfn|Bix|p=244}} Both the ''T\u014dseiha'' and the ''K\u014dd\u014dha'' factions were militaristic groups that favored a policy of expansionism abroad and dictatorship under the Emperor at home, but differed over the best way of achieving these goals.{{sfn|Bix|p=244}} The Imperial Way faction wanted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] to achieve a [[Sh\u014dwa Restoration]]; emphasised \"spirit\" as the principle war-winning factor; and despite advocating socialist policies at home wanted to invade the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Bix|p=244}} The Control faction, while being willing to use assassination to achieve its goals, was more willing to work within the system to achieve reforms; wanted to create the \"national defense state\" to mobilize the entire nation before going to war; and, while not rejecting the idea of \"spirit\" as a war-winning factor also saw military modernization as a war-winning factor; and saw the United States as a future enemy just as much as the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Bix|p=244}}\n\nDuring the [[February 26 Incident|February 26 coup attempt]] of 1936, Tojo and [[Shigeru Honj\u014d]], a noted supporter of [[Sadao Araki]], both opposed the rebels who were associated with the rival \"Imperial Way\" faction.{{sfn|Takemae & Ricketts|p=221}} Emperor [[Hirohito]] himself was outraged at the attacks on his close advisers, and after a brief political crisis and stalling on the part of a sympathetic military, the rebels were forced to surrender. As the commander of the ''Kenpeitai'', Tojo ordered the arrest of all officers in the Kwantung Army suspected of supporting the coup attempt in Tokyo.{{sfn|Browne|p=59}} In the aftermath, the T\u014dseiha faction was able to purge the Army of radical officers, and the coup leaders were tried and executed. Following the purge, T\u014dseiha and K\u014dd\u014dha elements were unified in their nationalist but highly anti-political stance under the banner of the T\u014dseiha military clique, with Tojo in the leadership position.\n\nTojo was promoted to [[chief of staff (military)|Chief of staff]] of the Kwangtung Army in 1937.{{sfn|Dear & Foot|p=872}} As the \"[[Manchukuo|Empire of Manchukuo]]\" was, in reality, a Japanese colony in all but name, the Kwangtung Army's duties were just as much political as they were military.{{sfn|Browne|p=60}} During this period, Tojo become close to [[Y\u014dsuke Matsuoka]], the fiery ultra-nationalist CEO of the [[South Manchuria Railway]], one of Asia's largest corporations at the time, and [[Nobusuke Kishi]], the Deputy Minister of Industry in Manchukuo, who was the man ''de facto'' in charge of Manchukuo's economy.{{sfn|Browne|p=60}} Though Tojo regarded preparing for a war with the Soviet Union as his first duty, Tojo also supported the forward policy in north China as the Japanese sought to extend their influence into China.{{sfn|Browne|p=60}} As chief of staff, Tojo was responsible for the military operations designed to increase Japanese penetration into the [[Inner Mongolia]] border regions with [[Manchukuo]]. In July 1937, he personally led the units of the 1st Independent Mixed Brigade in [[Operation Chahar]], his only real combat experience.{{sfn|Cowley & Parker|p=473}}\n\nAfter the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]] marking the start of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Tojo ordered his forces to attack [[Hebei Province]] and other targets in northern China. Tojo received [[Jew]]ish refugees in accordance with Japanese national policy and rejected the resulting Nazi German protests.{{sfn|Goodman & Miyazawa|p=113}} Tojo was recalled to Japan in May 1938 to serve as Vice-Minister of War under [[Ministry of War of Japan|Army Minister]] [[Seishir\u014d Itagaki]].{{sfn|Kato|p=127}} From December 1938 to 1940, Tojo was Inspector-General of Army Aviation.{{sfn|''The New International Year Book''|p=320}}\n\n== Political career ==\n=== Rise to Prime Minister ===\nOn June 1, 1940, the Showa Emperor appointed [[K\u014dichi Kido]], a leading \"reform bureaucrat\" as the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, making him into the Emperor's leading political advisor and fixer.{{sfn|Bix|p=370}} Kido had aided in the creation in the 1930s of an alliance between the \"reform bureaucrats\" and the \"Control\" faction in the Army, which was headed by General Mut\u014d Akira and General Tojo.{{sfn|Bix|p=370}} Kido's appointment also favored the rise of his allies in the Control faction.{{sfn|Bix|pp=370\u2013371}} On July 30, 1940, Hideki Tojo was appointed Army Minister in the second [[Fumimaro Konoe]] regime and remained in that post in the third Konoe cabinet. Prince Konoe had chosen Tojo\u2014a man representative of both the Army's hardline views and the Control faction while being considered reasonable to deal with\u2014to secure the Army's backing for his foreign policy.{{sfn|Bix|p=373}} Tojo was a militant ultra-nationalist, well respected for his work ethic and his ability to handle paperwork, who believed that the Emperor was a living god and favored \"direct imperial rule\", ensuring that he would faithfully follow any order from the Emperor.{{sfn|Bix|p=373}} Konoe favored having Germany mediate an end to the Sino-Japanese war, pressuring Britain to end its economic and military support of China even at the risk of war, seeking better relations with both Germany and the United States, and of taking advantage of the changes in the international order caused by Germany's victories in the spring of 1940 to make Japan a stronger power in Asia.{{sfn|Bix|pp=373\u2013374}} Konoe wanted to make Japan the dominant power in East Asia, but he also believed it was possible to negotiate a ''modus vivendi'' with the United States under which the Americans would agree to recognize the \"[[Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere]]\".{{sfn|Bix|pp=373\u2013374}}\n\nBy 1940, Konoe, who had started the war with China in 1937, no longer believed that a military solution to the \"China Affair\" was possible as he once did, instead favored having Germany mediate an end to the war that would presumably result in a pro-Japanese peace settlement, but would be less than he himself had outlined in the \"Konoe programme\" of January 1938.{{sfn|Bix|p=373}} For this reason, Konoe wanted Tojo, a tough general whose ultra-nationalism was beyond question, to provide \"cover\" for his attempt to seek a diplomatic solution to the war with China.{{sfn|Bix|p=373}} Tojo was a strong supporter of the [[Tripartite Pact]] between Imperial Japan, [[Nazi Germany]], and [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]]. As the Army Minister, he continued to expand the war with China.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} After negotiations with [[Vichy France]], Japan was given permission to place its troops in the southern part of [[French Indochina]] in July 1941. In spite of its formal recognition of the Vichy government, the United States retaliated against Japan by imposing [[economic sanctions]] in August, including a total embargo on oil and gasoline exports.{{sfn|Toland|p={{page needed|date=November 2011}} }} On September 6, a deadline of early October was fixed in the [[Gozen Kaigi|Imperial Conference]] for resolving the situation diplomatically. On October 14, the deadline had passed with no progress. Prime Minister Konoe then held his last cabinet meeting, where Tojo did most of the talking:\n\n{{quote |\nFor the past six months, ever since April, the foreign minister has made painstaking efforts to adjust relations. Although I respect him for that, we remain deadlocked&nbsp;... The heart of the matter is the imposition on us of withdrawal from Indochina and China&nbsp;... If we yield to America's demands, it will destroy the fruits of the China incident. Manchukuo will be endangered and our control of Korea undermined.{{sfn|Bix|p=417}}\n}}\n\nThe prevailing opinion within the Japanese Army at that time was that continued negotiations could be dangerous. However, Hirohito thought that he might be able to control extreme opinions in the army by using the charismatic and well-connected Tojo, who had expressed reservations regarding war with the West, although the Emperor himself was skeptical that Tojo would be able to avoid conflict. On October 13, he declared to [[K\u014dichi Kido]]: \"There seems little hope in the present situation for the Japan-U.S. negotiations. This time, if hostilities erupt, I have to issue a declaration of war.\"{{sfn|Kido|p=914}} During the last cabinet meetings of the Konoe government, Tojo emerged as a hawkish voice, saying he did not want a war with the United States but portrayed the Americans as arrogant, bullying white supremacists. He said that any compromise solution would only encourage them to make more extreme demands on Japan, in which case Japan might be better to choose war to uphold national honor.{{sfn|Bix|pp=417\u2013418}} Despite saying he favored peace, Tojo had often declared at cabinet meetings that any withdrawal from French Indochina and/or China would be damaging to military morale and might threaten the ''kokutai''; the \"China Incident\" could not be resolved via diplomacy and required a military solution; and attempting to compromise with the Americans would be seen as weakness by them.{{sfn|Bix|p=416}}\n\nOn October 16, Konoe, politically isolated and convinced that the Emperor no longer trusted him, resigned. Later, he justified himself to his chief cabinet secretary, Kenji Tomita:\n\n{{quote |\nOf course His Majesty is a pacifist, and there is no doubt he wished to avoid war. When I told him that to initiate war is a mistake, he agreed. But the next day, he would tell me: \"You were worried about it yesterday, but you do not have to worry so much.\" Thus, gradually, he began to lean toward war. And the next time I met him, he leaned even more toward war. In short, I felt the Emperor was telling me: \"My prime minister does not understand military matters, I know much more.\" In short, the Emperor had absorbed the views of the army and navy high commands.{{sfn|Fujiwara|p=126}}\n}}\n\n[[File:Tojo2.jpg|thumb|upright|Hideki Tojo in military uniform]]\n[[File:Hideki Tojo posing cropped2.png|170px|thumb]]\nAt the time, [[Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni]] was said to be the only person who could control the Army and the Navy and was recommended by Konoe and Tojo as Konoe's replacement. Hirohito rejected this option, arguing that a member of the imperial family should not have to eventually carry the responsibility for a war against the West as a defeat would ruin the prestige of the House of Yamato.{{sfn|Bix|p=418}} Following the advice of K\u014dichi Kido, he chose instead Tojo, who was known for his devotion to the imperial institution.{{sfn|Bix|p=418}}{{sfn|Terasaki|p=118}} Tojo's first speech on the radio made a call for \"world peace\", but also stated his determination to settle the \"China Affair\" on Japanese terms and to achieve the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" that would unite all of the Asian nations together.{{sfn|Browne|p=107}} Tojo was known to advocate war with the United States, and Prince Takamatsu wrote in his diary about hearing of the appointment: \"We have finally committed to war and now must do all we can to launch it powerfully. But we have clumsily telegraphed our intentions. We needn't have signaled what we're going to do; having [the entire Konoe cabinet] resign was too much. As matters stand now we can merely keep silent and without the least effort war will begin.\"{{sfn|Bix|p=419}} The Emperor summoned Tojo to the Imperial Palace one day before Tojo took office.{{sfn|Bix|p=418}} During the meetings of the senior statesmen to decide who was to succeed Prince Konoe, the former Prime Minister Admiral [[Keisuke Okada]] was opposed to Tojo as Prime Minister, while the powerful Lord Privy Seal [[K\u014dichi Kido]] pushed for Tojo, leading a compromise where Tojo would become Prime Minister while \"re-examining\" the options for dealing with the crisis with the United States, though Kido did not say that Tojo would attempt to avoid a war.{{sfn|Bix|pp=418\u2013419}} By tradition, the Emperor needed a consensus among the elder statesmen before appointing a prime minister, and as long as Admiral Okada was opposed to Tojo, it would be impolitic for the Emperor to appoint him as Prime Minister.{{sfn|Bix|pp=418\u2013419}}\n\nTojo wrote in his diary: \"I thought I was summoned because the Emperor was angry at my opinion.\" He was given one order from the Emperor: to make a policy review of what had been sanctioned by the Imperial Conferences.{{sfn|Bix|p=418-419}} Tojo, who was on the side of war, nevertheless accepted this order, and pledged to obey. According to Colonel Akiho Ishii, a member of the Army General Staff, the Prime Minister showed a true sense of loyalty to the emperor performing this duty. For example, when Ishii received from Hirohito a communication saying the Army should drop the idea of stationing troops in China to counter the military operations of the Western powers, he wrote a reply for the Prime Minister for his audience with the Emperor. Tojo then replied to Ishii: \"If the Emperor said it should be so, then that's it for me. One cannot recite arguments to the Emperor. You may keep your finely phrased memorandum.\"{{sfn|Wetzler|pp=51\u201352}}\n\nOn November 2, Tojo and Chiefs of Staff [[Hajime Sugiyama]] and [[Osami Nagano]] reported to Hirohito that the review had been in vain. The Emperor then gave his consent to war.{{sfn|Wetzler|pp=47\u201350}}{{sfn|Bix|p=421}} The next day, Fleet Admiral [[Osami Nagano]] explained in detail the Pearl Harbor attack plan to Hirohito.{{sfn|Wetzler|pp=29, 35}} The eventual plan drawn up by Army and Navy Chiefs of Staff envisaged such a mauling of the Western powers that Japanese defense perimeter lines\u2014operating on interior lines of communications and inflicting heavy Western casualties\u2014could not be breached. In addition, the Japanese fleet which attacked Pearl Harbor was under orders from Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] to be prepared to return to Japan on a moment's notice, should negotiations succeed.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Two days later, on November 5, Hirohito approved the operations plan for a war against the West and continued to hold meetings with the military and Tojo until the end of the month. On November 26, 1941, the American Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] handed Ambassador Nomura and Kurusu Saburo in Washington a \"draft mutual declaration of policy\" and \"Outline of Proposed Basis for Agreement between the United States and Japan\".{{sfn|Bix|p=428}} Hull proposed that Japan \"withdraw all military, naval, air and police forces\" from China and French Indochina in exchange for lifting the oil embargo, but left the term China undefined.{{sfn|Bix|p=428}} The \"[[Hull note]]\" as it is known in Japan made it clear the United States would not recognise the puppet government of Wang Jingwei as the government of China, but strongly implied that the United States might recognise the \"Empire of Manchukuo\"{{Opinion|date=April 2019}} and did not impose a deadline for the Japanese withdrawal from China.{{sfn|Bix|p=428}} On November 27, 1941, Tojo chose to misrepresent the \"Hull note\" to the Cabinet as an \"ultimatum to Japan\", which was incorrect as the \"Hull note\" did not have a timeline for its acceptance and was marked \"tentative\" in the opening sentence, which is inconsistent with an ultimatum.{{sfn|Bix|p=428}} The claim that the Americans had demanded in the \"Hull note\" Japanese withdrawal from all of China, instead of just the parts occupied since 1937 and together with the claim the note was an ultimatum was used as one of the principal excuses for choosing war with the United States.{{sfn|Bix|p=428-431}} On December 1, another conference finally sanctioned the \"war against the United States, England, and the Netherlands\".{{sfn|Wetzler|pp=28\u201330, 39}}\n\n=== As Prime Minister ===\n[[File:Hideki Tojo lands in Manila.jpg|thumb|Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo landed in [[Nichols Field]], an airfield south of Manila, for a state visit to the Philippines.]]\n\nOn December 7, 1941, Tojo went on Japanese radio to announce that Japan was now at war with the United States, the British Empire and the Netherlands, reading out an Imperial Rescript that ended with the playing of the popular martial song ''[[Umi Yukaba]]'' (''Across the Sea''), which set to music a popular war poem from the classic collection ''[[Many\u014dsh\u016b]]'', featuring the lyrics \"Across the sea, corpses soaking in the water, Across the mountains corpses heaped up in the grass, We shall die by the side of our lord, We shall never look back\".{{sfn|Dower|p=25}} Tojo continued to hold the position of Army Minister during his term as Prime Minister from October 17, 1941, to July 22, 1944.

As Home Minister, he ordered various [[Eugenics in Japan|eugenics]] measures (including the sterilization of the \"mentally unfit\").\n\nTojo had popular support in the early years of the war as Japanese forces moved from one victory to another. In March 1942, Tojo in his capacity as Army Minister gave permission for the Japanese Army in Taiwan to ship 50 \"[[comfort women]]\" from Taiwan to Borneo without ID papers (his approval was necessary as the Army's rules forbade people without ID traveling to the new conquests).{{sfn|Yoshimi|pp=81\u201383}} The Japanese historian Yoshiaki Yoshimi noted this document proves that Tojo was aware of and approved of the \"comfort women\" corps.{{sfn|Yoshimi|pp=81\u201383}} On April 18, 1942, the Americans staged the [[Doolittle Raid]], bombing Tokyo.{{sfn|Bix|p=448}} Some of the American planes were shot down and their pilots taken prisoner.{{sfn|Bix|p=448}} The Army General Staff led by Field Marshal [[Hajime Sugiyama]] insisted on executing the eight American fliers, but were opposed by Tojo, who feared that the Americans would retaliate against Japanese POWs if the Doolittle fliers were executed.{{sfn|Bix|p=448}} The dispute was resolved by the Emperor who commuted the death sentences of five fliers while allowing the other three to die, for reasons that remain unclear as the documents relating to the Emperor's intervention were burned in 1945.{{sfn|Bix|p=448}}\n\nAs the Japanese went from victory to victory, Tojo and the rest of the Japanese elite were gripped by what the Japanese called \"[[victory disease]]\" as the entire elite was caught up in a state of hubris, believing Japan was invincible and the war was as good as won.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=329}} By May 1942, Tojo approved a set of \"non-negotiable\" demands to be presented once the Allies sued for peace that allowed Japan to keep everything it already conquered while assuming possession of considerably more. {{sfn|Weinberg|p=329}} Under such demands, Japan would assume control of the following territories:\n*the British Crown colonies of India and Honduras well as the British dominions of Australia, Australian New Guinea, Ceylon, New Zealand, British Columbia and the Yukon Territory \n*the American state of Washington, Alaska and Hawaii\n*most of Latin America including Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti and the rest of the West Indies.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=329}} \n\nAdditionally, Tojo wanted all of China to be under the rule of the puppet [[Wang Jingwei]], planned to buy Macau and East Timor from Portugal and to create new puppet kingdoms in Burma, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Malaya.{{sfn|Weinberg|pp=329\u2013330}} As the Burmese had proved to be enthusiastic collaborators in the \"New Order in Asia\", the new Burmese kingdom would be allowed to annex much of north-east India as a reward.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=330}} The Navy for its part demanded that Japan take New Caledonia, Fiji, and Samoa.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=330}}\n\nWhile Tojo was prime minister, the main forum for military decision-making was the Imperial General Headquarters presided over by the Emperor. It consisted of the Army and Navy ministers; the Army and Navy chiefs of staff; and chiefs of the military affairs bureaus in both services.{{sfn|Falk|p=511}} The Imperial GHQ was not a joint chiefs of staff as existed in the United States and United Kingdom, but rather two separate services command operating under the same roof who would meet about twice a week to attempt to agree on a common strategy.{{sfn|Falk|pp=511\u2013512}} The Operations Bureaus of the Army and Navy would develop their own plans and then attempt to \"sell them\" to the other, which was often not possible.{{sfn|Falk|p=512}} Tojo was one voice out of many speaking at the Imperial GHQ, and was not able to impose his will on the Navy, which he had to negotiate with, like he was dealing with an ally.{{sfn|Falk|p=512}} The American historian Stanley Falk described the Japanese system as characterized by \"bitter inter-service antagonisms\" as the Army and Navy worked \"at cross-purposes\", observing the Japanese system of command was \"uncoordinated, ill-defined and inefficient\".{{sfn|Falk|p=518}}\n\n[[File:Cabinet of Hideki Tojo 3.jpg|thumb|Cabinet ministers of the first Tojo Cabinet, October 1941]]\nHowever, after the [[Battle of Midway]], with the tide of war turning against Japan, Tojo faced increasing opposition from within the government and military. In August\u2013September 1942, a major crisis gripped the Tojo cabinet when the Foreign Minister [[Shigenori T\u014dg\u014d]] objected quite violently on August 29, 1942 to the Prime Minister's plan to establish a Greater East Asia Ministry to handle relations with the puppet regimes in Asia as an insult to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (the ''Gaimusho'') and threatened to resign in protest.{{sfn|Bix|p=457}} Tojo went to see the Emperor, who backed the Prime Minister's plans for the Greater East Asia Ministry, and on September 1, 1942 Tojo told the cabinet he was establishing the Greater East Asia Ministry and could not care less about how the ''Gaimusho'' felt about the issue, leading T\u014dg\u014d to resign in protest.{{sfn|Bix|p=457}} The American historian Herbert Bix wrote that Tojo was a \"dictator\" only in the narrow sense that from September 1942 on, he was generally able to impose his will on the Cabinet without seeking a consensus, but at same time noted that Tojo's authority was based upon the support of the Emperor, who held ultimate power.{{sfn|Bix|p=457}} In November 1942, Tojo, as Army Minister, was involved in drafting the regulations for taking \"comfort women\" from China, Japan (which included Taiwan and Korea at this time) and Manchukuo to the \"South\", as the Japanese called their conquests in South-East Asia, to ensure that the \"comfort women\" had the proper papers before departing. Until then the War Ministry required special permission to take \"comfort women\" without papers, and Tojo was tired of dealing with these requests.{{sfn|Yoshimi|p=83}} At the same time, Tojo, as the Army Minister, became involved in a clash with the Army chief of staff over whether to continue the battle of Guadalcanal or not.

Following the 15th Army into India in the U-Go offensive were the Indian nationalist [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] and his Indian National Army, as the political purpose of the operation was to provoke a general uprising against British rule in India that might allow the Japanese to take all of India.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=641}} The roads necessary to properly supply the 150,000 Japanese soldiers committed to invading India would turn into mud when the monsoons arrived, giving the Japanese a very short period of time to break through. The Japanese were counting on capturing food from the British to feed their army, which in turn was based on the assumption that all of India would rise up when the Japanese arrived, causing the collapse of the Raj.{{sfn|Weinberg|pp=641\u2013642}}{{sfn|Willmott|pp=155\u2013156}} The Japanese brought along with them enough food to last for only 20 days, and after that, they would have to capture food from the British to avoid starving.{{sfn|Willmott|pp=156\u2013157}} Bose had impressed Tojo at their meetings as the best man to inspire an anti-British revolution in India.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=641}}\n[[File:Hideki T\u014dj\u014d and Nobusuke Kishi in 1943.jpg|thumb|T\u014dj\u014d and his minister [[Nobusuke Kishi]], who later became a prime minister in postwar Japan]]\n\nIn the central Pacific, the Americans destroyed the main Japanese naval base at [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] in an [[Operation Hailstone|air raid]] on February 18, 1944, forcing the Imperial Navy back to the Marianas (the oil to fuel ships and planes operating in the Marshalls, Caroline and Gilbert islands went up in smoke at Truk).{{sfn|Bix|p=472}} This breach of the \"absolute defense line\", five months after its creation, led Tojo to fire Admiral [[Osami Nagano]] as the Navy Chief of Staff, for incompetence.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=649}} The Americans had penetrated 1,300 miles across the \"absolute defense line\" and destroyed Truk, which caused a major crisis in Tokyo as Tojo, senior generals and admirals all blamed each other for the situation.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=348}} To strengthen his position in face of criticism of the way the war was going, on February 21, 1944, Tojo assumed the post of Chief of the [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff]], arguing he needed to take personal charge of the Army.{{sfn|Bix|p=472}} When [[Hajime Sugiyama|Field Marshal Sugiyama]] complained to the Emperor about being fired and having the Prime Minister run the General Staff, the Emperor told him he supported Tojo.{{sfn|Bix|p=472}} Tojo's major concern as Army Chief of Staff was planning the operations in China and India, with less time given over to the coming battles in the Marianas.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=651}} Tojo decided to take the strategic offensive for 1944 with his plans to win the war in 1944 being as follows:\n* Operation Ichigo would end the war with China, freeing up some 2 million Japanese soldiers.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=349}}\n* Operation U-Go would take India.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=349}}\n* When the Americans made the expected offensive into the Marianas, the Imperial Navy's Combined Fleet would fight a decisive battle of annihilation against the U.S. 5th Fleet, and halt the American drive in the central Pacific.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=349}}\n* In the South-west Pacific, the Japanese forces in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands would stay on the defensive and try to slow down the American, Australian, and New Zealand forces for long as possible.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=349}} Knowing of General MacArthur's personal obsession with returning to the Philippines, Tojo expected MacArthur to head for the Philippines rather than the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese-occupied]] [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern Indonesia), which was a relief from the Japanese viewpoint; the Dutch East Indies were rich in oil while the Philippines were not.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=349}}\nTojo expected that a major American defeat in the Marianas together with the conquest of China and India would so stun the Americans that they would sue for peace.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=348}} By this point, Tojo no longer believed the war aims of 1942 could be achieved, but he believed that his plans for victory 1944 would lead to a compromise peace that would allow him to present as a victory to the Japanese people.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=348}} By serving as Prime Minister, Army Minister and Army Chief of Staff, Tojo was taking on all of the responsibility, and if plans for victory in 1944 failed, he would have no scapegoat.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=651}}\n\n[[File:Hideki T\u014dj\u014d inspecting Kuching airfield, 1943.jpg|thumb|T\u014dj\u014d inspecting an airfield in Kuching in [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|occupied British Borneo]], July 1943]]\nOn March 12, 1944, the Japanese launched the [[Operation U-Go|U-Go offensive]] and invaded India.{{sfn|Weinberg|pp=641\u2013642}} Tojo had some doubts about Operation U-Go, but it was ordered by the Emperor himself, and Tojo was unwilling to oppose any decision of the Emperor.{{sfn|Bix|p=475}}\n\n[[File:Greater East Asia Conference.JPG|thumb|[[Greater East Asia Conference]] in November 1943, participants left to right: [[Ba Maw]], [[Zhang Jinghui]], [[Wang Jingwei]], Hideki Tojo, [[Wan Waithayakon]], [[Jos\u00e9 P.

On July 5, 1944, the Emperor accepted Tojo's advice to end the invasion of India as 72,000 Japanese soldiers had been killed in battle. A similar number had starved to death or died of diseases as the logistics to support an invasion of India were lacking, once the monsoons turned the roads of Burma into impassable mud.{{sfn|Bix|p=475}} Of the 150,000 Japanese soldiers who had participated in the March invasion of India, most were dead by July 1944.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=642}}\n\nIn parallel with the invasion of India, in April 1944 Tojo began [[Operation Ichi-Go|Operation Ichigo]], the largest Japanese offensive of the entire war, with the aim of taking southern China.{{sfn|Bix|p=474}}\n\nIn the [[Battle of Saipan]], about 70,000 Japanese soldiers, sailors, and civilians were killed in June\u2013July 1944 and in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] the Imperial Navy suffered a crushing defeat.{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} The first day of the Battle of the Philippine Sea, June 19, 1944, was dubbed by the Americans \"the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\" as over the course of the dogfights in the air, the United States Navy lost 30 planes while shooting down about 350 Imperial Japanese planes, in one of the Imperial Navy's most humiliating defeats.{{sfn|Willmott|p=208}} The Japanese believed that indoctrination in ''bushido'' (\"the way of the warrior\") would give them the edge as the Japanese longed to die for the Emperor, while the Americans were afraid to die, but superior American pilot training and airplanes meant the Japanese were hopelessly outclassed by the Americans.{{sfn|Willmott|p=208}} With Saipan in American hands, the Americans could take other islands in the Marianas to build airbases.{{sfn|Willmott|p=213}} The establishment of American bases in the Marianas meant the cities of Japan were within the range of B-29 Superfortress bombers and the British historian H. P. Willmott noted that \"even the most hard-headed of the Japanese militarists could dimly perceive that Japan would be at the end of her tether in that case\".{{sfn|Willmott|p=213}} As the news of the disastrous defeat suffered at Saipan reached Japan, it turned elite opinion against the Tojo government.{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} The Emperor himself was furious about the defeat at Saipan; had called a meeting of the Board of Field Marshals and Fleet Admirals to see if were possible to recapture Saipan (it was not); and Prince Takamatsu wrote in his diary \"he flares up frequently\".{{sfn|Bix|p=477}} Tojo was the Prime Minister, Minister of War and Chief of the Army General Staff, and was seen both in Japan and in the US as, in words of Willmott, \"the embodiment of national determination, hardline nationalism and militarism\".{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} Prince Konoe and Admiral Okada had long been plotting to bring down the Tojo government since the spring of 1943, and their principal problem had been the support of the Emperor, who did not wish to lose his favorite Prime Minister.{{sfn|Bix|p=478}}\n\nAfter the Battle of Saipan, it was clear to at least some of the Japanese elite that the war was lost, and Japan needed to make peace before the ''[[kokutai]]'' and perhaps even the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]] itself was destroyed.{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} Tojo had been so demonized in the United States during the war that, for the American people, Tojo was the face of Japanese militarism, and it was inconceivable that the United States would make peace with a government headed by Tojo.{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} Willmott noted that an additional problem for the \"peace faction\" was that: \"Tojo was an embodiment of ''mainstream opinion'' within the nation, the armed services and particularly the Army. Tojo had powerful support, and by Japanese standards, he was not extreme.\"{{sfn|Willmott|pp=216\u2013217}} Tojo was more of a follower than a leader, and he represented mainstream opinion in the Army, and so his removal from office would not mean the end of the political ambitions of an Army still fanatically committed to victory or death.{{sfn|Willmott|p=216}} The ''jushin'' (elder statesmen) had advised the Emperor that Tojo needed to go after Saipan and further advised the Emperor against partial changes in the cabinet, demanding that the entire Tojo cabinet resign.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Tojo, aware of the intrigues to bring him down, had sought the public approval of the Emperor, which was denied, with the Emperor sending him a message to the effect that the man responsible for the disaster of Saipan was not worthy of his approval.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Tojo suggested reorganizing his cabinet to regain Imperial approval, and was rebuffed with the Emperor saying the entire cabinet had to go.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Once it was clear that Tojo no longer had the support of the Chrysanthemum Throne, Tojo's enemies had little trouble bringing down his government.{{sfn|Bix|p=478}} The politically powerful Lord Privy Seal, Marquis [[K\u014dichi Kido]] spread the word that the Emperor no longer supported Tojo.{{sfn|Bix|p=478}} After the [[fall of Saipan]], he was forced to resign on July 18, 1944.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} The ''jushin'' advised the Emperor to appoint a former Prime Minister, Admiral [[Mitsumasa_Yonai|Mitsumasa Yonai]] as Prime Minister as he was popular with the Navy, the diplomatic corps, the bureaucracy and the \"peace faction\", but Yonai refused to serve, knowing full well that a Prime Minister who attempted to make peace with the Americans might be assassinated as many Army officers were still committed to victory or death and regarded any talk of peace as treason.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Admiral Yonai stated that only another general could serve as Prime Minister, and advised General [[Kuniaki_Koiso|Kuniaki Koiso]] should serve as Prime Minister.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} At a conference with the Emperor, Koiso and Yonai were told by the Emperor to co-operate in forming a government without saying who was to be the new Prime Minister.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} As the Emperor was worshiped as a living god, neither Yonai and Koiso could ask him who was to be the Prime Minister, as one does not ask questions of a god, and after the meeting, both men were very confused as to which of the two was now the Prime Minister.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Finally, the Lord Privy Seal, K\u014dichi Kido resolved the muddle by saying Koiso was the Prime Minister.{{sfn|Willmott|p=217}} Two days after Tojo resigned, the Emperor gave him an imperial rescript offering him unusually lavish praise for his \"meritorious services and hard work\" and declaring \"Hereafter we expect you to live up to our trust and make even greater contributions to military affairs\".{{sfn|Bix|p=478}}\n\n== Arrest, trial, and execution ==\n[[File:Tojo suicide.jpg|thumb|Hideki Tojo after his attempted suicide during his arrest]]\nAfter [[surrender of Japan|Japan's unconditional surrender]] in 1945, U.S. general [[Douglas MacArthur]] ordered the arrest of forty alleged war criminals, including Tojo.

{"title_page": "Hole carding", "text_new": "{{short description|Card games technique}}\nIn [[Card game|card games]], '''hole carding''' is the obtaining of knowledge of cards that are supposed to be hidden from view. The term is usually applied to [[blackjack]] but can apply to other games with hidden hole cards, like [[three card poker]] and [[Caribbean stud poker]]. So long as it does not involve the use of a device like a mirror or actions like touching the dealer's cards, in most jurisdictions hole carding is a legal form of [[advantage gambling]] in casino table games. In other games, like [[stud poker]], casinos normally have rules against [[rubbernecking]] or having a confederate stand behind an opponent to signal hole cards.\n\nBlackjack players must usually make playing decisions based on only seeing one of the dealer's cards (the upcard). But if the dealer's hole card is spotted, a player who plays correctly has a theoretical advantage of up to 13% instead of the normal player disadvantage of around 0.5%. A hole-card player will often choose not to make certain plays, such as hitting a hard 19 against a dealer 20, so as not to reveal that he can see the dealer's hole card.\n\nThis technique is not applicable in most games outside of the United States where the second dealer card is normally not dealt until all players have played.\n\n==Hole card strategies==\n\nA normal blackjack strategy has ten columns, for an ace through dealer ten value card. Strategy tables for hole carding differ from normal blackjack tables as they include a column for each possible total dealer hand instead of simply the visible card. Below is a sample hole card hit/stand table for six decks, stand on soft-17. The columns are based on the dealer hand and the rows based on the player hand. Green denotes a hit.\n\n[[File:Blackjack_Hit-Stand_holecarding_strategy_table.png||center]]\n\n==First-basing and spooking==\nOne method of hole carding is to peek at the card when the dealer checks the hole card for blackjack. This is called \"first-basing\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Blaine |first1=Rick |title=Blackjack blueprint : how to play like a pro-- part-time |publisher=Huntington Press |isbn=0-929712-16-1 |page=154}}</ref> A modification called \"spooking\" refers to a partner with a better view peeking at the hole card in the same circumstance and communicating the information to the player. Peeking devices have made these methods largely obsolete.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Snyder |first1=Arnold |title=The big book of blackjack |publisher=Cardoza Pub |isbn=1-58042-155-5 |page=311 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n==Front-loading==\nFront-loading refers to observing the hole card as it is slid under the upcard.<ref>Uston, Ken ''Million Dollar Blackjack''. Sept. 1, 1992, Carol Publishing Corporation.</ref> Newer methods of hole-carding concentrate on observation before the down card is placed under the upcard. This provides information about the card even if the dealer upcard is not a ten or an ace. The advantage varies depending on the rules, the percentage of cards seen, and the strategies used.\n\n==Partial information==\nAt times the player will see a corner of the hole card, but not enough to determine the exact card. For example, if there is no pip in the corner, the card may be an ace, 2 or 3. Or, if there is a pip in the corner, it is a 4-10, but not a face card. To make use of this additional information, a different set of strategy tables must be used depending on the set of possible cards in the hole.<ref name=JG>{{cite book |last1=Grosjean |first1=James |title=Exhibit CAA : beyond counting |publisher=South Side Advantage Press, LLC |isbn=0-9790061-4-7 |pages=279 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nBelow is a sample blackjack, partial hole card hit/stand table for two decks. The columns are based on the dealer upcard and the rows based on the player hand. Partial hole card tables contain ten columns as the dealer's total hand is not known with complete certainty. A different set of tables must be used depending on the information acquired from the hole card. In this table, the hole card is a six or seven. Green denotes a hit. One might note that this table bears little resemblance to standard blackjack strategy.\n\n[[File:Blackjack Hole-Card Partial Information Hole = 6\u20137 Hit-Stand.png||center]]\n\n== Next card play ==\nHole carding generally refers to knowing the dealer\u2019s hole card. Next card play refers to knowing the next card to be dealt. If a round has not started, and a player knows what his or her first card will be, one can simply alter one's bet depending on the value of that card. In a game like blackjack, if the dealer has already dealt a player's first two cards, and the player knows the next card to be dealt, it becomes possible for playing decisions to be altered to include this additional information. Strategies are significantly more complex as there exists a different strategy table for each possible next card. Strategies may also differ depending on a player's position in the dealing rotation:\n* First Seat \u2013 If the player does not take the known card, another player gets it. \n* Last Seat \u2013 If the player does not take the card, the dealer may draw it. This also applies in a situation where no player to one's left is likely to draw a card.\n* No hole card \u2013 In a no-hole-card game, if the player does not take the card, it may become the dealer\u2019s second card.\n\n==Other methods==\n\n* Warped cards \u2013 In a casino where a blackjack dealer bends the hole card to check for a blackjack, the cards can become warped. The warps can be later used to determine the value of a face down card. This method is largely obsolete as most casinos use devices instead of bending cards to determine dealer blackjacks, and cards are regularly replaced with new decks.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Humble |first1=Lance |last2=Cooper |first2=Carl |title=The world's greatest blackjack book |publisher=Doubleday |isbn=0-385-15382-1 |page=141 |edition=Rev.}}</ref>\n* Dealer tells \u2013 When a blackjack dealer checks for a blackjack, some dealers may give clues as to the value of the down card, akin to Poker tells. Again, most casinos now use devices to check the down card, rendering this obsolete in most casinos.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Snyder|first1=Arnold|title=Blackbelt in blackjack : playing 21 as a martial art|date=2005|publisher=Cardoza Pub.|location=New York|isbn=978-1580421430|edition=3rd}}</ref>\n* Peeking at other players' cards \u2013 Depending on the game and casino, this may or may not be acceptable and may aid player decisions.\n* Counting by inference \u2013 In blackjack where player cards are dealt face down, the actions of other players can provide clues as to their hidden cards. This is less valuable in modern casinos due to the fewer number of single-deck games and reduction in penetration (how deeply the dealer deals before shuffling.)\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Blackjack}}\n\n[[Category:Gambling terminology]]\n[[Category:Blackjack]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Card games technique}}\nIn [[Card game|card games]], '''hole carding''' is the obtaining of knowledge of cards that are supposed to be hidden from view.

Peeking devices have made these methods largely obsolete.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Snyder |first1=Arnold |title=The big book of blackjack |publisher=Cardoza Pub |isbn=1-58042-155-5 |page=311 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n==Front-loading==\nFront-loading refers to observing the hole card as it is slid under the upcard.<ref>Uston, Ken ''Million Dollar Blackjack''. Sept. 1, 1992, Carol Publishing Corporation.</ref> Newer methods of hole-carding concentrate on observation before the down card is placed under the upcard. This provides information about the card even if the dealer upcard is not a ten or an ace. The advantage varies depending on the rules, the percentage of cards seen, and the strategies used.\n\n==Partial information==\nAt times the player will see a corner of the hole card, but not enough to determine the exact card. For example, if there is no pip in the corner, the card may be an ace, 2 or 3. Or, if there is a pip in the corner, it is a 4-10, but not a face card. To make use of this additional information, a different set of strategy tables must be used depending on the set of possible cards in the hole.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grosjean |first1=James |title=Exhibit CAA : beyond counting |publisher=South Side Advantage Press, LLC |isbn=0-9790061-4-7 |pages=279 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nBelow is a sample blackjack, partial hole card hit/stand table for two decks. The columns are based on the dealer upcard and the rows based on the player hand. Partial hole card tables contain ten columns as the dealer's total hand is not known with complete certainty. A different set of tables must be used depending on the information acquired from the hole card. In this table, the hole card is a six or seven. Green denotes a hit. One might note that this table bears little resemblance to standard blackjack strategy.\n\n[[File:Blackjack Hole-Card Partial Information Hole = 6\u20137 Hit-Stand.png||center]]\n\n== Next card play ==\nHole carding generally refers to knowing the dealer\u2019s hole card. Next card play refers to knowing the next card to be dealt. If a round has not started, and a player knows what his or her first card will be, one can simply alter one's bet depending on the value of that card. In a game like blackjack, if the dealer has already dealt a player's first two cards, and the player knows the next card to be dealt, it becomes possible for playing decisions to be altered to include this additional information. Strategies are significantly more complex as there exists a different strategy table for each possible next card. Strategies may also differ depending on a player's position in the dealing rotation:\n* First Seat \u2013 If the player does not take the known card, another player gets it. \n* Last Seat \u2013 If the player does not take the card, the dealer may draw it. This also applies in a situation where no player to one's left is likely to draw a card.\n* No hole card \u2013 In a no-hole-card game, if the player does not take the card, it may become the dealer\u2019s second card.\n\n==Other methods==\n\n* Warped cards \u2013 In a casino where a blackjack dealer bends the hole card to check for a blackjack, the cards can become warped. The warps can be later used to determine the value of a face down card. This method is largely obsolete as most casinos use devices instead of bending cards to determine dealer blackjacks, and cards are regularly replaced with new decks.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Humble |first1=Lance |last2=Cooper |first2=Carl |title=The world's greatest blackjack book |publisher=Doubleday |isbn=0-385-15382-1 |page=141 |edition=Rev.}}</ref>\n* Dealer tells \u2013 When a blackjack dealer checks for a blackjack, some dealers may give clues as to the value of the down card, akin to Poker tells. Again, most casinos now use devices to check the down card, rendering this obsolete in most casinos.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Snyder|first1=Arnold|title=Blackbelt in blackjack : playing 21 as a martial art|date=2005|publisher=Cardoza Pub.|location=New York|isbn=978-1580421430|edition=3rd}}</ref>\n* Peeking at other players' cards \u2013 Depending on the game and casino, this may or may not be acceptable and may aid player decisions.\n* Counting by inference \u2013 In blackjack where player cards are dealt face down, the actions of other players can provide clues as to their hidden cards. This is less valuable in modern casinos due to the fewer number of single-deck games and reduction in penetration (how deeply the dealer deals before shuffling.)\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Blackjack}}\n\n[[Category:Gambling terminology]]\n[[Category:Blackjack]]\n", "name_user": "Objective3000", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePartial information", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_carding"}
