If no shadow is seen, legend says, spring will come early. In Germany, the tradition evolved into a myth that if the sun came out on Candlemas, a [[hedgehog]] would cast its shadow, predicting snow all the way into May.<ref>{{cite web |title=Groundhog Day, Hedgehogs and Candlemas |url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art23627.asp |website=www.bellaonline.com |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref> When German immigrants settled in Pennsylvania, they transferred the tradition onto local fauna, replacing hedgehogs with groundhogs. Several other towns in the region hold [[Groundhog Day#Other locations|similar Groundhog Day events]]. \n\nEach year two scrolls are prepared by the vice president of the Inner Circle: One says early spring and the other says six more weeks of winter. These scrolls are placed during the ceremony on the stump and after Phil is awakened by the crowd, Phil communicates in Groundhogese to the President, who is then directed by Phil to the proper scroll and forecast.\n\nPhil first received his name in 1961. The origins of the name are unclear, but speculation suggests that it may have been indirectly named after [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].<ref>Lucas Reilly and Austin Thompson (February 1, 2019).

If no shadow is seen, legend says, spring will come early. In Germany, the tradition evolved into a myth that if the sun came out on Candlemas, a [[hedgehog]] would cast its shadow, predicting snow all the way into May.<ref>{{cite web |title=Groundhog Day, Hedgehogs and Candlemas |url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art23627.asp |website=www.bellaonline.com |accessdate=3 February 2017}}</ref> When German immigrants settled in Pennsylvania, they transferred the tradition onto local fauna, replacing hedgehogs with groundhogs. Several other towns in the region hold [[Groundhog Day#Other locations|similar Groundhog Day events]]. \n\nEach year two scrolls are prepared by the vice president of the Inner Circle: One says early spring and the other says six more weeks of winter. These scrolls are placed during the ceremony on the stump and after Phil is awakened by the crowd, Phil communicates in Groundhogese to the President, who is then directed by Phil to the proper scroll and forecast.\n\nPhil first received his name in 1961. The origins of the name are unclear, but speculation suggests that it may have been indirectly named after [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].<ref>Lucas Reilly and Austin Thompson (February 1, 2019).
