The lake is still used for many water activities such as boating, canoeing, fishing and also for walks and recreational steam train trips.\n\n==History==\nLegend has it that the village of [[Rudyard, Staffordshire|Rudyard]] was named after [[Ralph Rudyard]], a local man reputed to have killed [[Richard III]] at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]], although as the place-name was first recorded in 1022 and subsequently mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086<ref>{{cite book|last =Mills|first =A.D.|authorlink =A.D.

The bill to promote the construction failed in Parliament, and there was a suggestion for a bigger scheme, involving a canal from Marple on the [[Peak Forest Canal]] to the Caldon Canal, passing through Macclesfield and Rudyard. [[Benjamin Outram]], the engineer for the Peak Forest Canal, would have overseen the project, and again, it would have involved a reservoir at Rudyard. However, the Trent and Mersey re-submitted their bill in early 1797, and it became an [[Act of Parliament]] in March.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=200}}\n\nAs built, the lake is around {{convert|2|mi|km}} long and {{convert|0.25|mi|km}} wide. It was formed by creating a {{convert|63|ft|m|adj=on}} earth dam at the southern end of the steep wooded valley, which is faced with stone on the upstream side, to prevent erosion. A spillway, some {{convert|60|ft|m}} wide, was built at the eastern side of the dam, and feeds the {{convert|2.5|mi|0|adj=on}} feeder than carries water to the Leek Branch. The main source of water supply to the lake is a feeder that runs from the headwaters of the [[River Dane]]. This was refurbished in the mid-1990s by the [[Waterway Recovery Group]]. The lake has gradually silted up, but there are problems associated with dredging it, due to a lack of access for vehicles, and [[English Nature]]'s concern over the disturbance of some rare fauna.{{sfn |Sims |2004 |p=75}}\n\nOn 26 June 1846 the [[North Staffordshire Railway]] successfully took over the canal company and lake as part of one of its acts of parliament that resulted in the formation of the North Staffordshire Railway.  Having acquired the lake and the land around it the railway used the land down one side as the route for its [[Churnet Valley Line]] between Macclesfield and Uttoxeter.  Two stations were built, one at [[Rudyard railway station|Rudyard]] village (later renamed Rudyard Lake) and one at the north end of the lake called [[Cliffe Park railway station|Rudyard Lake]] (later renamed Cliffe Park)<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jeuda |first1=Basil |title=The Churnet Valley Railway |year=1999 |publisher=Lightmoor Press |location=[[Lydney]], [[Gloucestershire]]|isbn=978-1-899889-05-1 |page=62 }}</ref>\n\nBecause of the accessibility brought by the railway stations, daytrippers and tourists began visiting the lake.

An annual lake festival is held on a Sunday in August and a firework display takes place in November.\n\nThe [[Rudyard Lake Steam Railway]] runs narrow gauge steam trains that operate up the east side of the lake on many days throughout the year. It is possible to walk round the lake or walk part way and start/finish the journey by steam train.\n\n==''Top Gear'' episode==\nThe [[BBC]]'s motoring show ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'' held a challenge at the lake in 2006 to see which presenter had designed the best [[amphibious vehicle|amphibious]] car.

The lake is still used for many water activities such as boating, canoeing, fishing and also for walks and recreational steam train trips.\n\n==History==\nThe village of [[Rudyard, Staffordshire|Rudyard]] was named after [[Ralph Rudyard]], a local man reputed to have killed [[Richard III]] at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]], although as Rudyard was mentioned in the Domesday Book in 1086, it is more likely Ralph, if he existed , was named after the village.<ref name=\"Potteries\">[http://www.thepotteries.org/did_you/002.htm The Potteries \u2013 Did You Know, Rudyard Lake] Accessed 16 July 2012</ref> Rudyard Lake was constructed by the [[engineer]] [[John Rennie (engineer)|John Rennie]], for the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] company in 1797\u201398 to feed the [[Caldon Canal]].<ref name=\"Rudyard\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rudyardlake.com/rudyard_in_history.htm |publisher=Rudyard Lake |title=A history of Rudyard |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701225327/http://www.rudyardlake.com/rudyard_in_history.htm |archivedate=1 July 2012 |accessdate=16 July 2012}}</ref> The reservoir had been proposed in 1796, and would have been connected to the upper level of the Caldon Canal by a feeder, but in order to win the consent of landowners, the {{convert|3.3|mi|adj=on}} section below Leek was made navigable. The bill to promote the construction failed in Parliament, and there was a suggestion for a bigger scheme, involving a canal from Marple on the [[Peak Forest Canal]] to the Caldon Canal, passing through Macclesfield and Rudyard. [[Benjamin Outram]], the engineer for the Peak Forest Canal, would have overseen the project, and again, it would have involved a reservoir at Rudyard. However, the Trent and Mersey re-submitted their bill in early 1797, and it became an [[Act of Parliament]] in March.{{sfn |Hadfield |1985 |p=200}}\n\nAs built, the lake is around {{convert|2|mi|km}} long and {{convert|0.25|mi|km}} wide. It was formed by creating a {{convert|63|ft|m|adj=on}} earth dam at the southern end of the steep wooded valley, which is faced with stone on the upstream side, to prevent erosion. A spillway, some {{convert|60|ft|m}} wide, was built at the eastern side of the dam, and feeds the {{convert|2.5|mi|0|adj=on}} feeder than carries water to the Leek Branch. The main source of water supply to the lake is a feeder that runs from the headwaters of the [[River Dane]]. This was refurbished in the mid-1990s by the [[Waterway Recovery Group]]. The lake has gradually silted up, but there are problems associated with dredging it, due to a lack of access for vehicles, and [[English Nature]]'s concern over the disturbance of some rare fauna.{{sfn |Sims |2004 |p=75}}\n\nOn 26 June 1846 the [[North Staffordshire Railway]] successfully took over the canal company and lake as part of one of its acts of parliament that resulted in the formation of the North Staffordshire Railway.  Having acquired the lake and the land around it the railway used the land down one side as the route for its [[Churnet Valley Line]] between Macclesfield and Uttoxeter.  Two stations were built, one at [[Rudyard railway station|Rudyard]] village (later renamed Rudyard Lake) and one at the north end of the lake called [[Cliffe Park railway station|Rudyard Lake]] (later renamed Cliffe Park)<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jeuda |first1=Basil |title=The Churnet Valley Railway |year=1999 |publisher=Lightmoor Press |location=[[Lydney]], [[Gloucestershire]]|isbn=978-1-899889-05-1 |page=62 }}</ref>\n\nBecause of the accessibility brought by the railway stations, daytrippers and tourists began visiting the lake. Visitors included [[John Lockwood Kipling]] and [[MacDonald sisters|Alice Macdonald]], the parents of [[Rudyard Kipling]], who met there on a trip from [[Burslem]]. They liked the place so much they named their son after it.<ref name=\"Potteries\"/> By the end of the 19th century, crowds of up to 20,000 people could visit the lake on some days.<ref name=\"Rudyard\"/> Its popularity continued into the early 20th century, and over 20,000 visitors were carried to the site on 88 trains on a particular day in 1913.{{sfn |Sims |2004 |p=74}} [[Matthew Webb]], the first man to swim the English Channel, entertained crowds by demonstrating his swimming in the lake,<ref name=\"Rudyard\"/> and [[Carlos Trower]] (\"the African [[Blondin]]\") performed a [[tightrope walking|tightrope walk]] across the lake.<ref name=\"AfricanBlondin\">[http://theafricanblondin.com/performances.php The African Blondin - Performances] Accessed 9 May 2016</ref>\n\n==Attractions==\n\nThe lake is home to Rudyard Lake Sailing Club and North Staffordshire Rowing Club. Fishing, walking, [[canoeing]] and boat trips are popular attractions.<ref name=\"Activities\">[http://www.rudyardlake.com/lake_activities.htm Rudyard Lake official website \u2013 Activities] Accessed 16 July 2012</ref> The lake has a visitor centre, toilets and an activity centre which can be hired for functions or conferences. An annual lake festival is held on a Sunday in August and a firework display takes place in November.\n\nThe [[Rudyard Lake Steam Railway]] runs narrow gauge steam trains that operate up the east side of the lake on many days throughout the year. It is possible to walk round the lake or walk part way and start/finish the journey by steam train.\n\n==''Top Gear'' episode==\nThe [[BBC]]'s motoring show ''[[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]]'' held a challenge at the lake in 2006 to see which presenter had designed the best [[amphibious vehicle|amphibious]] car. [[Richard Hammond]]'s attempt sank while [[Jeremy Clarkson]]'s attempt capsized with Richard on board at the end of the challenge. However, [[James May]]'s [[Triumph Herald]], complete with sail and mast, performed well, despite the almost total absence of wind, and he was able to drive it out of the water, thus winning the challenge.<ref>{{citation |pages=42\u201343 |title=Top Gear: Ambitious but Rubbish: The Secrets Behind Top Gear's Craziest Creations |publisher=Ebury |year=2015 |isbn=9781448140084 |author=Richard Porter}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|Transport}}\n*[[Canals of the United Kingdom]]\n*[[History of the British canal system]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book \n  |first=Charles |last=Hadfield \n  |title=The Canals of the West Midlands \n  |publisher=David and Charles \n  |year=1985 \n  |isbn=978-0-7153-8644-6\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book \n  |first=Jon |last=Sims \n  |title=An Exceedingly Good Lake \n  |publisher=Waterways World \n  |date=April 2004 \n  |issn=0309-1422\n  |ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://www.rudyardlake.com/ Official Rudyard Lake website]\n* [http://www.rudyardlakesc.org.uk/ Rudyard Lake Sailing Club]\n* [http://www.nsrc.org.uk/ North Staffordshire Rowing Club]\n* [http://www.rlsr.org/ Rudyard Lake Steam Railway website]\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-36153037  \"The lake that people used to flock to\"], BBC, 30 April 2016\n\n[[Category:Canal reservoirs in England]]\n[[Category:Reservoirs of the Peak District]]\n[[Category:Reservoirs in Staffordshire]]\n[[Category:North Staffordshire Railway]]\n", "name_user": "Dartford Warbler", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:Amended the first sentence to correct the impression that what it was referring to was fact rather than folk legend.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Lake"}
