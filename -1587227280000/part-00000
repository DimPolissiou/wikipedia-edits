1939) is an Australian former politician who served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia|25th Prime Minister of Australia]] from 1996 to 2007. He is the second-longest serving Australian Prime Minister, behind only Sir [[Robert Menzies]], who was in office for over 18 years. He is also the [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia by age|oldest living former Australian Prime Minister]], having been so since the death of [[Bob Hawke]] on 16 May 2019. Howard was leader of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] from 1985 to 1989 and from 1995 to 2007.\n\nHoward was born in [[Sydney]] and studied law at the [[University of Sydney]]. He was a commercial lawyer before entering parliament. A former federal president of the [[Young Liberals (Australia)|Young Liberals]], he first stood for office at the [[1968 New South Wales state election]], but lost narrowly. At the [[1974 Australian federal election|1974 federal election]], Howard was elected to the [[Division of Bennelong]], which he would go on to represent until 2007. He was promoted to cabinet in 1977, and later in the year replaced [[Phillip Lynch]] as [[Treasurer of Australia]], remaining in that position until the defeat of [[Malcolm Fraser]]'s government [[1983 Australian federal election|in 1983]].\n\nIn 1985, Howard was elected leader of the Liberal Party for the first time, thus replacing [[Andrew Peacock]] as [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]]. He led the [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal\u2013National coalition]] to the [[1987 Australian federal election|1987 federal election]], but lost to [[Bob Hawke]]'s Labor government, and was removed from the leadership in 1989. Remaining a key figure in the party, Howard was re-elected leader in 1995 (replacing [[Alexander Downer]]), and subsequently led the Coalition to victory at the [[1996 Australian federal election|1996 federal election]].\n\nAfter defeating [[Paul Keating]]'s Labor government in 1996, the [[Howard Government]] was re-elected at the [[1998 Australian federal election|1998]], [[2001 Australian federal election|2001]] and [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 elections]]. Howard's actions as prime minister included [[Gun laws in Australia|new gun laws]] (in response to the [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur massacre]]), the introduction of [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|a nationwide value-added tax]], [[Pacific Solution|immigration reform]], and [[WorkChoices|industrial relations reform]]. Australia also contributed troops to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] and the [[Iraq War]] under his government, and led the [[International Force for East Timor]]. The Howard government was defeated at the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]], with the Labor Party's [[Kevin Rudd]] succeeding him as prime minister. Howard also lost his own seat at the election, becoming only the second prime minister to do so (after [[Stanley Bruce]] in [[1929 Australian federal election|1929]]).\n\n==Early and personal life==\n[[File:John Howard boy.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Photograph of John Howard as a boy, taken in the 1940s|Howard as a boy, 1940s]]\nJohn Winston Howard is the fourth son of Mona (''n\u00e9e'' Kell) and [[Lyall Howard]].

Bjelke-Petersen abandoned his bid for Prime Minister a month before the election.  However, the damage had already been done.  The end of the Coalition agreement led to a large number of three-cornered contests.  Additionally, a number of swing voters outside Queensland were alarmed at the prospect of Bjelke-Petersen holding the balance of power, and voted for Labor in order to ensure that the Liberals and Nationals would be defeated.

The Liberals actually won a majority in their own right with 75 seats, the most that the party had ever won.  It was only the third time (the others being 1975 and 1977) that the main non-Labor party has been even theoretically able to govern alone since the Coalition's formation.

The Coalition actually lost the national two-party preferred vote to Labor, suffering a 14-seat swing. However, the uneven nature of the swing allowed Howard to win a second term in government, with a considerably reduced majority (from 45 seats to 12).

an Australian former politician who served as the [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia|25th Prime Minister of Australia]] from 1996 to 2007. He is the second-longest serving Australian Prime Minister, behind only Sir [[Robert Menzies]], who was in office for over 18 years. He is also the [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia by age|oldest living former Australian Prime Minister]], having been so since the death of [[Bob Hawke]] on 16 May 2019. Howard was leader of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] from 1985 to 1989 and from 1995 to 2007.\n\nHoward was born in [[Sydney]] and studied law at the [[University of Sydney]]. He was a commercial lawyer before entering parliament. A former federal president of the [[Young Liberals (Australia)|Young Liberals]], he first stood for office at the [[1968 New South Wales state election]], but lost narrowly. At the [[1974 Australian federal election|1974 federal election]], Howard was elected to the [[Division of Bennelong]], which he would go on to represent until 2007. He was promoted to cabinet in 1977, and later in the year replaced [[Phillip Lynch]] as [[Treasurer of Australia]], remaining in that position until the defeat of [[Malcolm Fraser]]'s government [[1983 Australian federal election|in 1983]].\n\nIn 1985, Howard was elected leader of the Liberal Party for the first time, thus replacing [[Andrew Peacock]] as [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]]. He led the [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal\u2013National coalition]] to the [[1987 Australian federal election|1987 federal election]], but lost to [[Bob Hawke]]'s Labor government, and was removed from the leadership in 1989. Remaining a key figure in the party, Howard was re-elected leader in 1995 (replacing [[Alexander Downer]]), and subsequently led the Coalition to victory at the [[1996 Australian federal election|1996 federal election]].\n\nAfter defeating [[Paul Keating]]'s Labor government in 1996, the [[Howard Government]] was re-elected at the [[1998 Australian federal election|1998]], [[2001 Australian federal election|2001]] and [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 elections]]. Howard's actions as prime minister included [[Gun laws in Australia|new gun laws]] (in response to the [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur massacre]]), the introduction of [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|a nationwide value-added tax]], [[Pacific Solution|immigration reform]], and [[WorkChoices|industrial relations reform]]. Australia also contributed troops to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]] and the [[Iraq War]] under his government, and led the [[International Force for East Timor]]. The Howard government was defeated at the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]], with the Labor Party's [[Kevin Rudd]] succeeding him as prime minister. Howard also lost his own seat at the election, becoming only the second prime minister to do so (after [[Stanley Bruce]] in [[1929 Australian federal election|1929]]).\n\n==Early and personal life==\n[[File:John Howard boy.jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=Photograph of John Howard as a boy, taken in the 1940s|Howard as a boy, 1940s]]\nJohn Winston Howard is the fourth son of Mona (''n\u00e9e'' Kell) and [[Lyall Howard]].

Bjelke-Petersen abandoned his bid for Prime Minister a month before the election.  However, the damage had already been done.  The end of the Coalition agreement led to a large number of three-cornered contests.  Additionally, a number of swing voters outside Queensland were alarmed at the prospect of Bjelke-Petersen holding the balance of power, and voted for Labor in order to ensure that the Liberals and Nationals would be defeated.

The Liberals actually won a majority in their own right with 75 seats, the most that the party had ever won.

However, the uneven nature of the swing allowed Howard to win a second term in government, with a considerably reduced majority (from 45 seats to 12).

The song was heard by [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]], who played it on the radio station in 1997, helping Mishra gain recognition in a short space of time.<ref name=\"Sample 2020\" />\n\nMishra has stated that the lyrics could stem from or be related to multiple situations. He says \"When I wrote it, I was trying to write a pop song that had more than one perspective. Although it's written in the first person, the character behind that viewpoint isn't necessarily what the casual listener would expect\".<ref name=\"whitetown.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitetown.co.uk/faq/ |title=White Town \u2013 Your Questions Answered! |publisher=Whitetown.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref>\n\nMishra wrote that the themes of the song include: \"Being a member of an orthodox [[Trotskyist]] / [[Marxist]] movement. Being a straight guy in love with a lesbian. Being a gay guy in love with a straight man. Being a straight girl in love with a lying, two-timing, fake-arse Marxist. The hypocrisy that results when love and lust get mixed up with highbrow ideals.\"<ref name=\"whitetown.co.uk\"/> Mishra admitted that being signed to a major label ([[EMI]]) didn't allow him to express creative control, and the loss of his anonymity due to the song's popularity drove him \"mad\".<ref name=\"Sample 2020\" />\n\nThe '>Abort, Retry, Fail?_' message that appeared on some inlay cards was explained by the artist: \"Well, this cheerful message became a kind of [[shibboleth]] for me and sort-of characterizes what's been going on for me the last few years.\" The song was mixed on a microcomputer, the [[Atari ST]].\n\n==Composition==\nJ'na Jefferson of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' summarized the song's production as a [[juxtaposition]] of the sampled track's (\"My Woman\" by [[Al Bowlly#References in popular culture|Al Bowlly]]), \"despondent sound with upbeat, enduring energy\", which Mishra said was inspired by the 1970s [[BBC]] drama-comedy series\u00a0''[[Pennies From Heaven (TV series)|Pennies From Heaven]]''. She labeled it \"[[Alternative pop|alt-pop]]\", adding that it combines the Bowlly sample with \"[[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]-style [[funk]] from the '70s, [[Depeche Mode]]-inspired '80s [[Electropop|electro pop]], and '90s [[Boom bap|boom-bap hip-hop]].\"<ref name=\"Sample 2020\" />\n\nThe song's lyrics contain various perspectives about love and relationships, and is, according to Mishra, a \"flip\" of Bowlly's original \"anti-woman\" theme. Regarding the song's concept and the perspective of which it is sang from, Mishra said \"When you love somebody, it's not logical, it's not rational, and you think 'This is ridiculous, I can never be with you, I can never be the person you need, why am I even feeling these feelings?' So, I was trying to write from all these\u00a0different sides\u2026 I wanted people to go 'this is catchy' and sing it, but then be like, 'What the hell?' at the same time\".<ref name=\"Sample 2020\" />\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[Larry Flick]] from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' wrote that \"the lines dividing electronic dance music and hip-hop are blurred on this instantly infectious ditty, Actually, the real creative inspiration here appears to come from \"[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]\" and other classic hits by [[Chic (band)|Chic]]. It's evident in the jangly guitar licks and the bounce of the backbeat.\" He added that \"those with no historical reference will probably find the distorted vocals and mind-numbing horn samples good fun.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1997/Billboard-1997-03-01.pdf|title=Single Reviews: New & Noteworthy|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=1 March 1997|accessdate=6 February 2020|page=60|format=PDF}}</ref> Gina Morris from ''[[Smash Hits]]'' commented that \"what's cool is that he recorded his debut single in his own room and then watched it go to number one.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/smashhits90s/37290378546/in/album-72157660892601268/|title=Review: Albums|magazine=[[Smash Hits]]|volume=|issue=476|page=60|date=26 February 1997|accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n \n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] was produced in black and white [[silent film]] style. Most of the outdoor scenes were filmed in [[Derby]].\n\nIn the video, there are numerous elements of acting, cinematography and editing that suggest an old fashioned film style. The exaggerated gestures of the hat wearing woman, helpless and fearful, and those of her quick tempered lover hint at the acting style from 1920s [[Expressionism (film)|expressionist films]]. The ostensive [[metaphor]]s, such as the use of hypnosis on the woman by the man or the recurring shots of crossroad signs bearing names of romantic relationship related attitudes, remind of the 1920s and 1930s efforts to express [[subjectivism]] in film.\n\nThe use of circular masks, as to emphasise focal points or for a mere elegant look, also belongs to the aforementioned period. At the point where the woman first enters the man's bedroom and in the final rope scene, [[match cut]]s are used in a manner resemblant of that from silent experimental films. Mishra can be seen for brief moments on television screens in the background.\n\nThere is also a scene where the woman closes the door on the man's arm, as she tries to escape from his advances. This is a direct reference to scene from [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] and [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel|Luis Bu\u00f1uel's]] [[surrealism|surrealist]] film ''[[Un chien andalou]]'' (1928).\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1997)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Australia|2|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Austria|23|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Flanders|20|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Wallonia|7|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Canadatopsingles|4|chartid=3217|rowheader=true|accessdate=22 July 2019}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Canadaadultcontemporary|22|chartid=3232|rowheader=true|accessdate=22 July 2019}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Canadadance|5|chartid=3233|rowheader=true|accessdate=22 July 2019}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Canadarock|2|chartid=3188|rowheader=true|accessdate=22 July 2019}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Denmark ([[IFPI Denmark|IFPI]])<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aw4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA49|title=Billboard \u2013 Google Books|via=[[Google Books]]|date=12 April 1997|accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref>\n|4\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe ([[European Hot 100 Singles|Eurochart Hot 100]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/90s/1997/MM-1997-02-08.pdf|title=Eurochart Hot 100 Singles|magazine=[[Music & Media]]|volume=14|issue=6|page=19|date=8 February 1997|access-date=25 January 2020}}</ref>\n|11\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Finland|4|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|France|5|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Germany2|24|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|songid=3405|rowheader=true|accessdate=22 July 2019}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Hungary ([[Mahasz]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/90s/1997/MM-1997-05-24.pdf|title=Top 10 Hungary|work=[[Music & Media]]|accessdate=6 May 2018}}</ref>\n|5\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Iceland ([[\u00cdslenski listinn|\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://timarit.is/files/12413915.pdf#navpanes=1&view=FitH|title=\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40 (NR. 209 Vikuna 20.2.

The song was heard by [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]], who played it on the radio station in 1997, helping Mishra gain recognition in a short space of time.<ref name=\"Sample 2020\" />\n\nMishra has stated that the lyrics could stem from or be related to multiple situations. He says \"When I wrote it, I was trying to write a pop song that had more than one perspective. Although it's written in the first person, the character behind that viewpoint isn't necessarily what the casual listener would expect\".<ref name=\"whitetown.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitetown.co.uk/faq/ |title=White Town \u2013 Your Questions Answered! |publisher=Whitetown.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16}}</ref>\n\nMishra wrote that the themes of the song include: \"Being a member of an orthodox [[Trotskyist]] / [[Marxist]] movement. Being a straight guy in love with a lesbian. Being a gay guy in love with a straight man. Being a straight girl in love with a lying, two-timing, fake-arse Marxist. The hypocrisy that results when love and lust get mixed up with highbrow ideals.\"<ref name=\"whitetown.co.uk\"/> Mishra admitted that being signed to a major label ([[EMI]]) didn't allow him to express creative control, and the loss of his anonymity due to the song's popularity drove him \"mad\".<ref name=\"Sample 2020\" />\n\nThe '>Abort, Retry, Fail?_' message that appeared on some inlay cards was explained by the artist: \"Well, this cheerful message became a kind of [[shibboleth]] for me and sort-of characterizes what's been going on for me the last few years.\" The song was mixed on a microcomputer, the [[Atari ST]].\n\n==Composition==\nJ'na Jefferson of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' summarized the song's production as a [[juxtaposition]] of the sampled track's (\"My Woman\" by [[Al Bowlly#References in popular culture|Al Bowlly]]), \"despondent sound with upbeat, enduring energy\", which Mishra said was inspired by the 1970s [[BBC]] drama-comedy series\u00a0''[[Pennies From Heaven (TV series)|Pennies From Heaven]]''. She labeled it \"[[Alternative pop|alt-pop]]\", adding that it combines the Bowlly sample with \"[[George Clinton]]-style [[funk]] from the '70s, [[Depeche Mode]]-inspired '80s [[Electropop|electro pop]], and '90s [[Boom bap|boom-bap hip-hop]].\"<ref name=\"Sample 2020\" />\n\nThe song's lyrics contain various perspectives about love and relationships, and is, according to Mishra, a \"flip\" of Bowlly's original \"anti-woman\" theme. Regarding the song's concept and the perspective of which it is sang from, Mishra said \"When you love somebody, it's not logical, it's not rational, and you think 'This is ridiculous, I can never be with you, I can never be the person you need, why am I even feeling these feelings?' So, I was trying to write from all these\u00a0different sides\u2026 I wanted people to go 'this is catchy' and sing it, but then be like, 'What the hell?' at the same time\".<ref name=\"Sample 2020\" />\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[Larry Flick]] from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' wrote that \"the lines dividing electronic dance music and hip-hop are blurred on this instantly infectious ditty, Actually, the real creative inspiration here appears to come from \"[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]\" and other classic hits by [[Chic (band)|Chic]]. It's evident in the jangly guitar licks and the bounce of the backbeat.\" He added that \"those with no historical reference will probably find the distorted vocals and mind-numbing horn samples good fun.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1997/Billboard-1997-03-01.pdf|title=Single Reviews: New & Noteworthy|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=1 March 1997|accessdate=6 February 2020|page=60|format=PDF}}</ref> Gina Morris from ''[[Smash Hits]]'' commented that \"what's cool is that he recorded his debut single in his own room and then watched it go to number one.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/smashhits90s/37290378546/in/album-72157660892601268/|title=Review: Albums|magazine=[[Smash Hits]]|volume=|issue=476|page=60|date=26 February 1997|accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n \n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] was produced in black and white [[silent film]] style. Most of the outdoor scenes were filmed in [[Derby]].\n\nIn the video, there are numerous elements of acting, cinematography and editing that suggest an old fashioned film style. The exaggerated gestures of the hat wearing woman, helpless and fearful, and those of her quick tempered lover hint at the acting style from 1920s [[Expressionism (film)|expressionist films]]. The ostensive [[metaphor]]s, such as the use of hypnosis on the woman by the man or the recurring shots of crossroad signs bearing names of romantic relationship related attitudes, remind of the 1920s and 1930s efforts to express [[subjectivism]] in film.\n\nThe use of circular masks, as to emphasise focal points or for a mere elegant look, also belongs to the aforementioned period. At the point where the woman first enters the man's bedroom and in the final rope scene, [[match cut]]s are used in a manner resemblant of that from silent experimental films. Mishra can be seen for brief moments on television screens in the background.\n\nThere is also a scene where the woman closes the door on the man's arm, as she tries to escape from his advances. This is a direct reference to scene from [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]] and [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel|Luis Bu\u00f1uel's]] [[surrealism|surrealist]] film ''[[Un chien andalou]]'' (1928).\n\n==Charts and certifications==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1997)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Australia|2|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Austria|23|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Flanders|20|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Wallonia|7|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Canadatopsingles|4|chartid=3217|rowheader=true|accessdate=22 July 2019}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Canadaadultcontemporary|22|chartid=3232|rowheader=true|accessdate=22 July 2019}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Canadadance|5|chartid=3233|rowheader=true|accessdate=22 July 2019}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Canadarock|2|chartid=3188|rowheader=true|accessdate=22 July 2019}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Denmark ([[IFPI Denmark|IFPI]])<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Aw4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA49|title=Billboard \u2013 Google Books|via=[[Google Books]]|date=12 April 1997|accessdate=31 March 2014}}</ref>\n|4\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe ([[European Hot 100 Singles|Eurochart Hot 100]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/UK/Music-and-Media/90s/1997/MM-1997-02-08.pdf|title=Eurochart Hot 100 Singles|magazine=[[Music & Media]]|volume=14|issue=6|page=19|date=8 February 1997|access-date=25 January 2020}}</ref>\n|11\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Finland|4|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|France|5|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{Singlechart|Germany2|24|artist=White Town|song=Your Woman|songid=3405|rowheader=true|accessdate=22 July 2019}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Hungary ([[Mahasz]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/90s/1997/MM-1997-05-24.pdf|title=Top 10 Hungary|work=[[Music & Media]]|accessdate=6 May 2018}}</ref>\n|5\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Iceland ([[\u00cdslenski listinn|\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://timarit.is/files/12413915.pdf#navpanes=1&view=FitH|title=\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40 (NR. 209 Vikuna 20.2.

Kazin says to begin to wonder about the tiger, and its nature, can only lead to a daring to wonder about it. Blake achieves great power through the use of [[alliteration]] (\"frame\" and \"fearful\") combined with [[imagery]] (burning, fire, eyes), and he structures the poem to ring with incessant repetitive questioning, demanding of the creature, \"Who made thee?\" In the third stanza the focus moves from the tiger, the creation, to the creator \u2013 of whom Blake wonders \"What dread hand? & what dread feet?\".<ref name = \"Kazin\"/> \"The Tyger\" is six stanzas in length, each stanza four lines long.  Much of the poem follows the metrical pattern of its first line and can be scanned as [[trochaic tetrameter]] [[catalectic]].  A number of lines, however, such as line four in the first stanza, fall into [[iambic tetrameter]].\n\n\"The Tyger\" lacks narrative movement. The first stanza opens the central question, \"What immortal hand or eye, / Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\" Here the direct address to the creature becomes most obvious, but certainly, \"the Tyger\" cannot provide the lyrical \"I\" with a satisfactory answer, so the contemplation continues. \nThe second stanza questions \"the Tyger\" about where he was created; the third about how the creator formed him; the fourth about what tools were used. In the fifth stanza, Blake wonders how the creator reacted to \"the Tyger\", and who created the creature. \nFinally, the sixth restates the central question while raising the stakes; rather than merely question who or what \"could\" create the Tyger, the speaker wonders: ''who dares''.\n\n==Themes and critical analysis==\n\"The Tyger\" is the sister poem to \"[[The Lamb (poem)|The Lamb]]\" (from \"[[Songs of Innocence]]\"), a reflection of similar ideas from a different perspective (Blake's concept of \"contraries\"), with \"The Lamb\" bringing attention to innocence.  \"The Tyger\" presents a duality between aesthetic beauty and primal ferocity, and Blake believes that to see one, the hand that created \"The Lamb\", one must also see the other, the hand that created \"The Tyger\u201d: \"Did he who made the Lamb make thee?\" \n\nThe \"Songs of Experience\" were written as a contrary to the \"Songs of Innocence\" \u2013 a central tenet in Blake's philosophy, and central theme in his work.<ref name = \"Kazin\"/> The struggle of humanity is based on the concept of the contrary nature of things, Blake believed, and thus, to achieve truth one must see the contraries in innocence and experience. Experience is not the face of evil but rather another facet of that which created us. Kazin says of Blake, \"Never is he more heretical than ... where he glories in the hammer and fire out of which are struck ... the Tyger\".<ref name = \"Kazin\"/> Rather than believing in war between good and evil or heaven and hell, Blake thought each man must first see and then resolve the contraries of existence and life. In \"The Tyger\" he presents a poem of \"triumphant human awareness\" and \"a hymn to pure being\", according to Kazin.<ref name = \"Kazin\"/>\n\n==Musical versions==\nBlake's original tunes for his poems have been lost in time, but many artists have tried to create their own versions of the tunes. <ref>{{Citation|title=#3746: \"Songs of Experience\": Music Inspired by Poetry of William Blake {{!}} New Sounds - Hand-picked music, genre free|url=http://www.newsounds.org/story/songs-experience-music-inspired-poetry-william-blake/|language=en|accessdate=2017-12-07}}</ref> \n*[[Rebecca Clarke (composer)|Rebecca Clarke]] \u2013 \"The Tiger\" (1929\u201333)\n* [[Benjamin Britten]], in his [[song cycle]] ''[[Songs and Proverbs of William Blake]]'' (1965)\n*[[Marianne Faithfull]], in her song \"[http://www.mariannefaithfull.org.uk/music/dangerous-acquaintances/track/eye-communication/ Eye Communication]\" (1981) from the [[Dangerous Acquaintances]] album.\n* [[Duran Duran]] \u2013 \"Tiger Tiger\" (1983)\n* [[Greg Brown (folk musician)|Greg Brown]], on the album \"[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience (Greg Brown album)|Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]\" (1986)\n* [[John Tavener]] \u2013 \"The Tyger\" (1987)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer?category=Works&workid=11185 |title=John Tavener |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=musicsalesclassical.com |publisher=Chester Music |access-date=August 2, 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n* [[Tangerine Dream]] \u2013 the album [[Tyger (album)|Tyger]] (1987)\n* [[Jah Wobble]] \u2013 \"Tyger Tyger\" (1996)\n* [[Kenneth Fuchs]] \u2013 ''Songs of Innocence and of Experience: Four Poems by William Blake for Baritone, Flute, Oboe, Cello, and Harp'' (completed 2006)\n* [[Herbst in Peking]] \u2013 \"The Tyger and The Fly\" (2014)\n* [[Qntal]] \u2013 \"Tyger\" (2014)\n* [[Mephisto Walz]] \u2013 \"The Tyger\"\n\n[[Bob Dylan]] also references Blake\u2019s poem in \u201cRoll on John\u201d (2012).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fearful Symmetry (disambiguation)]]\n*[[Quasar, Quasar, Burning Bright]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [[Gerald Eades Bentley|Bentley, G.

In \"The Tyger\" he presents a poem of \"triumphant human awareness\" and \"a hymn to pure being\", according to Kazin.<ref name = \"Kazin\"/>\n\n==Musical versions==\nBlake's original tunes for his poems have been lost in time, but many artists have tried to create their own versions of the tunes. <ref>{{Citation|title=#3746: \"Songs of Experience\": Music Inspired by Poetry of William Blake {{!}} New Sounds - Hand-picked music, genre free|url=http://www.newsounds.org/story/songs-experience-music-inspired-poetry-william-blake/|language=en|accessdate=2017-12-07}}</ref> \n*[[Rebecca Clarke (composer)|Rebecca Clarke]] \u2013 \"The Tiger\" (1929\u201333)\n* [[Benjamin Britten]], in his [[song cycle]] ''[[Songs and Proverbs of William Blake]]'' (1965)\n*[[Marianne Faithfull]], in her song \"[http://www.mariannefaithfull.org.uk/music/dangerous-acquaintances/track/eye-communication/ Eye Communication]\" (1981) from the [[Dangerous Acquaintances]] album.\n* [[Duran Duran]] \u2013 \"Tiger Tiger\" (1983)\n* [[Greg Brown (folk musician)|Greg Brown]], on the album \"[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience (Greg Brown album)|Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]\" (1986)\n* [[John Tavener]] \u2013 \"The Tyger\" (1987)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer?category=Works&workid=11185 |title=John Tavener |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=musicsalesclassical.com |publisher=Chester Music |access-date=August 2, 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n* [[Tangerine Dream]] \u2013 the album [[Tyger (album)|Tyger]] (1987)\n* [[Jah Wobble]] \u2013 \"Tyger Tyger\" (1996)\n* [[Kenneth Fuchs]] \u2013 ''Songs of Innocence and of Experience: Four Poems by William Blake for Baritone, Flute, Oboe, Cello, and Harp'' (completed 2006)\n* [[Herbst in Peking]] \u2013 \"The Tyger and The Fly\" (2014)\n* [[Qntal]] \u2013 \"Tyger\" (2014)\n* [[Mephisto Walz]] \u2013 \"The Tyger\"\n\n[[Bob Dylan]] also references Blake\u2019s poem in \u201cRoll on John\u201d (2012).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fearful Symmetry (disambiguation)]]\n*[[Quasar, Quasar, Burning Bright]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* [[Gerald Eades Bentley|Bentley, G.

It was the first and, so far, only Summer Olympic Games to be held in Canada. [[Toronto]] hosted the [[1976 Summer Paralympics]] the same year as the Montreal Olympics, and still remain the only [[Summer Paralympics]] to be held in [[Canada]]. [[Calgary]] and [[Vancouver]] later hosted the Winter Olympic Games in [[1988 Winter Olympics|1988]] and [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010]], respectively.\n\nTwenty-nine countries, mostly African, boycotted the Montreal Games when the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) refused to ban New Zealand, after the [[New Zealand national rugby union team]] had [[1976 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|toured South Africa earlier in 1976]] in defiance of the [[United Nations]]' calls for a sporting embargo. The Soviet Union won the most gold and overall medals.\n\n==Host city selection==\n\nThe vote occurred on May 12, 1970, at the 69th [[List of IOC meetings#IOC Sessions|IOC Session]] in Amsterdam, [[Netherlands]]. While Los Angeles and Moscow were viewed as the favourites given that they represented the world's two main powers, many of the smaller countries supported Montreal as an [[underdog (term)|underdog]] and as a relatively neutral site for the games. Los Angeles was eliminated after the first round and Montreal won in the second round. Moscow would go on to host the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] and Los Angeles the [[1984 Summer Olympics]]. One blank vote was cast in the second and final round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aldaver.com/votes.html|title=IOC VOTE HISTORY|publisher=aldaver.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Stuart|first1=Charles Edward|title=Never Trust a Local: Inside the Nixon White House|date=2005|publisher=Algora Publishing|page=160}}</ref><ref name=votes>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesbids.com/english/archives/past.shtml |title=Past Olympic host city election results |publisher=[[GamesBids]] |accessdate=March 17, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124022022/http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/past.html |archivedate=January 24, 2011 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n[[Toronto]] had made its third attempt for the Olympics but failed to get the support of the [[Canadian Olympic Committee]], which selected Montreal instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2015/07/24/toronto-has-made-5-attempts-to-host-the-olympics-could-the-sixth-be-the-winner.html|title=Toronto has made 5 attempts to host the Olympics.

Indirect capital costs are ''not'' included, such as for road, rail, or airport infrastructure, or for hotel upgrades or other business investment incurred in preparation for the Games but not directly related to staging the Games. The cost overrun for Montreal 1976 is the highest cost overrun on record for any Olympics.

Youtube</ref> The Queen was accompanied by [[Michael Morris, 3rd Baron Killanin|Michael Morris]], Lord Killanin, President of the International Olympic Committee, and was greeted to an orchestral rendition of '[[O Canada]]', an arrangement that for many years later would be used in schools across the country as well as in the daily sign off of TV broadcasts in the country.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmXyWbrD0I CBC sign-on, sign-off video from 1987]. Youtube</ref>\n\nThe queen entered the Royal Box with her consort, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], and her son, [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]]. (Her daughter, [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]], was an equestrian competitor for the team from Great Britain. Prince Philip was also president of the [[International Equestrian Federation]] (FEI) at the time of the 1976 Summer Olympics.) She joined a number of Canadian and Olympic dignitaries, including: [[Jules L\u00e9ger]], Governor General of Canada, and his wife, [[Gabrielle L\u00e9ger|Gabrielle]]; Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] and wife, [[Margaret Trudeau|Margaret]]; [[Robert Bourassa]], Premier of the Province of Quebec; [[Roger Rousseau]], chief of the Montreal Olympic Organizing Committee (COJO); Sheila Dunlop, Lady Killanin, wife of the IOC President; Mayor of Montreal, [[Jean Drapeau]], and his wife, Marie-Claire.\n\nThe parade of athletes began moments later with the arrival of the Greek team and concluded with the entrance of the Canadian team. All other teams entered the stadium according to French alphabetical order.  The ceremony was marked by the adorning of [[Israel]]\u2019s flag with a black mourning ribbon, in memory of the eleven athletes and coaches killed by Palestinian terrorists at the previous Summer Olympic Games in [[Munich]] four years earlier. Although most would eventually boycott the Games in the days to follow, a number of African delegations did march in the parade. Much of the music performed for the parade was arranged by [[Vic Vogel]] and was inspired by late Quebec composer, [[Andr\u00e9 Mathieu]].<ref>Arthur Takacs. [http://www.montrealolympics.com/takac.php Sixty Olympic Years]. montrealolympics.com</ref>\n\nImmediately following the parade, a troupe of 80 women dancers dressed in white (representing the 80th anniversary of the revival of the Olympic Games) performed a brief dance in the outline of the Olympic rings.\n\nFollowing that came the official speeches, first by Roger Rousseau, head of the Montreal Olympic organizing committee, and Lord Killanin. Her Majesty was then invited to proclaim the Games open, which she did, first in French, then in English.\n\nAccompanied by the Olympic Hymn, the Olympic flag was carried into the stadium and hoisted at the west end of the stadium. The flag was carried by eight men and hoisted by four women, representing the ten provinces and two territories (at the time) of Canada. As the flag was hoisted, an all-male choir performed an a cappella version of the Olympic Hymn.\n\nOnce the flag was unfurled, a troupe of Bavarian dancers, representing Munich, host of the previous [[1972 Summer Olympics]], entered the stadium with the [[Olympic symbols#Antwerp flag|Antwerp flag]]. Following a brief dance, that flag was then passed from the Mayor of Munich to the IOC President and then to the Mayor of Montreal. Next came a presentation of traditional Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois folk dancers. The two troupes merged in dance together to the strains of \"Vive le Compagnie\" and exited the stadium with the Antwerp Flag, which would be displayed at Montreal City Hall until the opening of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow.\n\nThree cannons were then fired, as the 80-member troupe of female dancers unfolded special crates that released doves and ribbons in the five Olympic colours.\n\nAnother trumpet fanfare announced the arrival of the Olympic Flame. The torch was carried by two 15-year-olds, St\u00e9phane Pr\u00e9fontaine and Sandra Henderson, chosen as representatives of the unity within Canada's linguistic heritage. This would also be the first time two people would light the Olympic flame, and Henderson would become only the second woman to do the honours. The duo would make a lap of the stadium and then climbed a staircase on a special dais at the center of the stadium to set the Olympic flame alight in a temporary white aluminum cauldron. The flame was later transported to a more permanent cauldron just outside the running track to burn throughout the duration of the Games. A choir then performed the Olympic Cantata as onlookers admired the Olympic flame.\n\nThen, the 'Youth of Canada' took to the track to perform a colourful choreographed segment with flags, ribbons and a variety of rhythmic gymnast performers.\n\nThe flag bearers of each team then circled around the speaker's dais as Pierre St-Jean recited the Athletes' Oath and Maurice Forget recited the Judges' Oath, in English and in French, with right hand over the heart and the Canadian flag clutched in the left.\n\nFinally, a choral performance of 'O Canada' in both French and English marked the close of the opening ceremony, as the announcers concluded with a declaration of 'Vive les Jeux de Montreal! Long Live the Montreal Games'.\n\nThe Montreal ceremony would be the last of its kind, as future Olympic ceremonies, beginning with the 1980 Moscow Games, would become more focused on theatrical, cultural and artistic presentations and less on formality and protocol.\n\n== Highlights ==\n\n* These Olympics were the first of two summer games to be organised under the IOC presidency of [[Michael Morris, 3rd Baron Killanin]].\n* [[Taro Aso]] was a member of the Japanese shooting team. 32 years later, he would be elected as the prime minister of Japan.\n* The Games were opened by [[Elizabeth II]], as [[Monarchy of Canada|head of state of Canada]], and several members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] attended the opening ceremonies. This was particularly significant, as these were the first Olympic games hosted on Canadian soil. The Queen's daughter, [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]], also competed in the games as part of the British riding team. Additionally, the Queen's husband, [[Prince Philip]], was President of the [[International Equestrian Federation]] (FEI) at the time.\n* After a rainstorm doused the [[Olympic Flame]] a few days after the games had opened, an official relit the flame using his cigarette lighter. Organizers quickly doused it again and relit it using a backup of the original flame.\n* The Israeli team walked into the stadium at the opening ceremony wearing black ribbons in commemoration of the 1972 [[Munich massacre]].<ref>{{YouTube|-ZqPL9FOHI0}}</ref>\n* Women's events were introduced in basketball, [[team handball|handball]] and [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]].\n* Canada, the host country, finished with five silver and six bronze medals. This was the first time that the host country of the Summer Games had not won any [[gold medals]]. This feat had occurred previously only in the Winter Games \u2013 [[1924 Winter Olympics|1924]] in [[Chamonix]], France, and [[1928 Winter Olympics|1928]] in [[St. Moritz]], Switzerland. This later occurred at the [[1984 Winter Olympics|1984 Winter Games]] in [[Sarajevo]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and again at the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary]], Alberta, Canada.\n* Because of the [[Munich massacre]], security at these games was visible, as it had been earlier in the year at the [[1976 Winter Olympics|Winter Games]] in [[Innsbruck, Austria]].\n* At age 14, gymnast [[Nadia Com\u0103neci]] of Romania became the first person to score a [[Perfect 10 (gymnastics)|perfect 10]] at the Olympics, recording seven 10.00 scores and winning three gold medals, including the [[Gymnastics at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic individual all-around|all-around]]. The scoreboard could hold only 3 digits and the score was shown as 1.00. \n* [[Alberto Juantorena]] of Cuba became the first man to win both the 400 m and 800 m at the same Olympics.\n* Finland's [[Lasse Vir\u00e9n]] repeated his [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] double win in the 5,000 and 10,000 m runs, the first runner to successfully defend a 5,000 m win (since equalled by Britain's Mo Farah in 2016). Vir\u00e9n finished 5th in the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]], thereby failing to equal [[Emil Z\u00e1topek]]'s 1952 achievements.\n* [[Hasely Crawford]] won Trinidad and Tobago's first Olympic gold medal by finishing first in the 100 meter dash.\n* [[Viktor Saneyev]] of the [[Soviet Union]] won his third consecutive [[triple jump]] gold medal, while [[Klaus Dibiasi]] of Italy did the same in the platform [[Diving (sport)|diving]] event.\n* [[Boris Onishchenko]], a member of the Soviet Union's [[modern pentathlon]] team, was disqualified after it was discovered that he had rigged his [[\u00e9p\u00e9e]] to register a hit when there wasn't one. Because of this, the Soviet modern pentathlon team was disqualified. Due to his disqualification, it was suggested that he earned the nickname of \"Boris DISonish-chenko\".

However, Canada went on to win the most gold medals at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]].\n\n{{Medals table\n | caption        = \n | host           = \n | show_limit     = \n | remaining_text = \n | flag_template  = FlagIOC\n | event          = 1976 Summer\n | team           = \n | gold_URS = 49 | silver_URS = 41 | bronze_URS = 35\n | gold_GDR = 40 | silver_GDR = 25 | bronze_GDR = 25\n | gold_USA = 34 | silver_USA = 35 | bronze_USA = 25\n | gold_FRG = 10 | silver_FRG = 12 | bronze_FRG = 17\n | gold_JPN = 9 | silver_JPN = 6 | bronze_JPN = 10\n | gold_POL = 7 | silver_POL = 6 | bronze_POL = 13\n | gold_BUL = 6 | silver_BUL = 9 | bronze_BUL = 7\n | gold_CUB = 6 | silver_CUB = 4 | bronze_CUB = 3\n | gold_ROU = 4 | silver_ROU = 9 | bronze_ROU = 14\n | gold_HUN = 4 | silver_HUN = 5 | bronze_HUN = 13\n | gold_CAN = 0 | silver_CAN = 5 | bronze_CAN = 6 | host_CAN = yes\n}}\n{{Further|1976 Summer Olympics medal table}}\n\n== {{anchor|Boycott}}Non-participating National Olympic Committees ==\nTwenty-nine countries boycotted the Games<ref name=\"or\">{{cite web | title = Africa and the XXIst Olympiad | work=Olympic Review |url=https://digital.la84.org/98297a7f-a870-449e-af4c-2a886cc04373 |format=PDF| year = 1976 | publisher=[[IOC]] |accessdate =April 3, 2006 }}</ref><ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/17/newsid_3555000/3555450.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 17 &#124; 1976: African countries boycott Olympics |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=October 21, 2008 | date=July 17, 1976 | location=London}}</ref> due to the refusal of the IOC to ban New Zealand, after the [[New Zealand national rugby union team]] had [[1976 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|toured South Africa earlier in 1976]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/montreal-olympics-boycott |title=The Montreal Olympics boycott &#124; NZHistory.net.nz, New Zealand history online |publisher=Nzhistory.net.nz |accessdate=October 21, 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016030346/http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/montreal-olympics-boycott| archivedate=October 16, 2008| url-status=live}}</ref> The boycott was led by Congolese official {{Interlanguage link|Jean Claude Ganga|fr|Jean-Claude Ganga|lt=|WD=}}.

South Africa had been banned from the Olympics since 1964 due to its [[apartheid]] policies. Other countries, such as El Salvador and Zaire, did not participate in Montreal for purely economic reasons.<ref name=\"or\"/>\n\n[[File:1976 Summer Olympics (Montr\u00e9al) boycotting countries (blue).png|thumb|upright=1.7|Countries boycotting the 1976 Games are shaded blue]]\n\n===Republic of China boycott===\nAn unrelated boycott of the Montreal Games was the main issue between the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC). The ROC team withdrew from the games when Canada's [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government under [[Pierre Trudeau]] told it that the name \"Republic of China\" was not permissible at the Games because Canada had officially recognized the PRC in 1970. Canada attempted a compromise by allowing the ROC the continued use of its national flag and anthem in the Montreal Olympic activities; the ROC refused. Later in November 1976, the IOC recognized the PRC as the only recognized name of any Olympic activities representative of any Chinese government. In 1979 the IOC established in the [[Nagoya Resolution]] that the PRC agreed to participate in IOC activities if the Republic of China was referred to as \"[[Chinese Taipei]]\". [[1980 Summer Olympics|Another boycott]] would occur before the ROC would accept the provisions of the 1979 Resolution although the reason that so many other countries boycotted were not all the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|same as the ROC]].\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

Many citizens regard the Olympiad as a financial disaster for the city as it faced debts for 30 years after the Games had finished. The retractable roof of the Olympic Stadium never properly worked and on several occasions has torn, prompting the stadium to be closed for extended periods of time for repairs. The failure of the [[Montreal Expos]] baseball club is largely blamed on the failure of the Olympic Stadium to transition into an effective and popular venue for the club \u2013 given the massive capacity of the stadium, it often looked unimpressive even with regular crowds in excess of 20,000 spectators.\n\nThe year 1976 was also when the separatist [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] was first elected in Quebec, leading to new legislation to strengthen the legal status of the province's French-speaking majority; this also had the effect of driving migration of English speakers out of the province, especially to Ontario.\n\nMontreal's economy was also changing much like other industrial cities in the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River region of North America. In sum, numerous political, socio-cultural and economic changes affected the city at around the same time as the Olympics that would result in stalled growth and give the appearance of decline. That said, many of these factors existed prior to the Olympics and continued to have an effect on Montreal's growth and relative importance many years afterwards. There is no evidence which definitively proves that the Montreal Olympics played a specific role in that decline.\n\nBefore the 21st century, the relative benefits of the Olympics were defined differently. There were also different methods by which they were financed and presented to the public.\n\nThe Quebec provincial government took over construction when it became evident in 1975 that work had fallen far behind schedule. Work was still ongoing just weeks before the opening date, and the tower was not built. Mayor [[Jean Drapeau]] had confidently predicted in 1970 that \"the Olympics can no more have a deficit than a man can have a baby\", but the debt racked up to a billion dollars that the Quebec government mandated the city pay in full. This would prompt cartoonist [[Terry Mosher|Aislin]] to draw a pregnant Drapeau on the telephone saying, \"Allo, [[Henry Morgentaler|Morgentaler]]?\" in reference to a Montreal abortion provider.<ref>[https://montrealgazette.com/sports/aislin-looks-back-at-the-1976-summer-olympics Aislin looks back at the 1976 Summer Olympics], ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'', July 29, 2016</ref>\n[[File:OlympicStadium.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Olympic Stadium, seen next to the [[Montreal Botanical Garden]].]]\n[[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|The Olympic Stadium]] was designed by French architect [[Roger Taillibert]]. It is often nicknamed \"The Big O\" as a reference to both its name and to the doughnut-shape of the permanent component of the stadium's roof, though \"The Big Owe\" has been used to reference the astronomical cost of the stadium and the 1976 Olympics as a whole. It has never had an effective retractable roof, and the tower (called the Montreal Tower) was completed only after the Olympic Games were over. In December 2006 the stadium's costs were finally paid in full.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-s-big-owe-stadium-debt-is-over-1.602530 |title=Quebec's Big Owe stadium debt is over |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]  |author=CBC News |date= December 19, 2006|accessdate=October 21, 2008}}</ref> The total expenditure (including repairs, renovations, construction, [[interest]], and inflation) amounted to C$1.61&nbsp;billion. Today the stadium lacks a permanent tenant, as the [[Montreal Alouettes]] and [[Montreal Expos]] have moved, though it does host some individual games of the Alouettes as well as the [[Montreal Impact]].\n\nOne of the streets surrounding the Olympic Stadium was renamed to honor [[Pierre de Coubertin]], the founder of the Olympics.\n\nThe boycott by African nations over the inclusion of New Zealand, whose rugby team had played in South Africa that year, was a contributing factor in the massive protests and civil disobedience that occurred during the [[1981 Springbok Tour]] of New Zealand. Official sporting contacts between South Africa and New Zealand did not occur again until after the fall of apartheid.\n\nAustralia's failure to win a gold medal led the country to create the [[Australian Institute of Sport]].\n\nIn 2016, the 40th anniversary celebrations were held. In conjunction with the celebrations, the 2016 [[Quebec Games]] were held.<ref name=\"Global-2016-07-12\">{{cite news |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2820732/nadia-comaneci-to-watch-jeux-du-quebec-and-attend-montreal-olympics-anniversary/ |title=Nadia Comaneci to watch Jeux du Qu\u00e9bec and attend Montreal Olympics anniversary |author=Matthew Grillo |work=Global News  |publisher=Global.ca |date=July 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcasting==\n*{{flag|Canada}} \u2013 [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC/Radio-Canada]]\n*{{flag|United Kingdom}} - [[BBC]]\n*{{flag|Australia}} - [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]], [[Seven Network]], [[Nine Network]]\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Canada|Sports}}\n{{IOC seealso|games=1976 Summer Olympics}}\n*[[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games#1976 Montreal|Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games \u2014 1976 Montreal]]\n*[[Corridart]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* Paul Charles Howell.

It was the first and, so far, only Summer Olympic Games to be held in Canada. [[Toronto]] hosted the [[1976 Summer Paralympics]] the same year as the Montreal Olympics, and still remain the only [[Summer Paralympics]] to be held in [[Canada]]. [[Calgary]] and [[Vancouver]] later hosted the Winter Olympic Games in [[1988 Winter Olympics|1988]] and [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010]], respectively.\n\nTwenty-nine countries, mostly African, boycotted the Montreal Games when the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) refused to ban New Zealand, after the [[New Zealand national rugby union team]] had [[1976 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|toured South Africa earlier in 1976]] in defiance of the [[United Nations]]' calls for a sporting embargo. The Soviet Union won the most gold and overall medals.\n\n==Host city selection==\n\nThe vote occurred on May 12, 1970, at the 69th [[List of IOC meetings#IOC Sessions|IOC Session]] in Amsterdam, [[Netherlands]]. While Los Angeles and Moscow were viewed as the favourites given that they represented the world's two main powers, many of the smaller countries supported Montreal as an [[underdog (term)|underdog]] and as a relatively neutral site for the games. Los Angeles was eliminated after the first round and Montreal won in the second round. Moscow would go on to host the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] and Los Angeles the [[1984 Summer Olympics]].

Youtube</ref> The Queen was accompanied by [[Michael Morris, 3rd Baron Killanin|Michael Morris]], Lord Killanin, President of the International Olympic Committee, and was greeted to an orchestral rendition of '[[O Canada]]', an arrangement that for many years later would be used in schools across the country as well as in the daily sign off of TV broadcasts in the country.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqmXyWbrD0I CBC sign-on, sign-off video from 1987]. Youtube</ref>\n\nThe queen entered the Royal Box with her consort, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], and her son, [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Prince Andrew]]. (Her daughter, [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]], was an equestrian competitor for the team from Great Britain. Prince Philip was also president of the [[International Equestrian Federation]] (FEI) at the time of the 1976 Summer Olympics.) She joined a number of Canadian and Olympic dignitaries, including: [[Jules L\u00e9ger]], Governor General of Canada, and his wife, [[Gabrielle L\u00e9ger|Gabrielle]]; Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] and wife, [[Margaret Trudeau|Margaret]]; [[Robert Bourassa]], Premier of the Province of Quebec; [[Roger Rousseau]], chief of the Montreal Olympic Organizing Committee (COJO); Sheila Dunlop, Lady Killanin, wife of the IOC President; Mayor of Montreal, [[Jean Drapeau]], and his wife, Marie-Claire.\n\nThe parade of athletes began moments later with the arrival of the Greek team and concluded with the entrance of the Canadian team. All other teams entered the stadium according to French alphabetical order.  The ceremony was marked by the adorning of [[Israel]]\u2019s flag with a black mourning ribbon, in memory of the eleven athletes and coaches killed by Palestinian terrorists at the previous Summer Olympic Games in [[Munich]] four years earlier. Although most would eventually boycott the Games in the days to follow, a number of African delegations did march in the parade. Much of the music performed for the parade was arranged by [[Vic Vogel]] and was inspired by late Quebec composer, [[Andr\u00e9 Mathieu]].<ref>Arthur Takacs. [http://www.montrealolympics.com/takac.php Sixty Olympic Years]. montrealolympics.com</ref>\n\nImmediately following the parade, a troupe of 80 women dancers dressed in white (representing the 80th anniversary of the revival of the Olympic Games) performed a brief dance in the outline of the Olympic rings.\n\nFollowing that came the official speeches, first by Roger Rousseau, head of the Montreal Olympic organizing committee, and Lord Killanin. Her Majesty was then invited to proclaim the Games open, which she did, first in French, then in English.\n\nAccompanied by the Olympic Hymn, the Olympic flag was carried into the stadium and hoisted at the west end of the stadium. The flag was carried by eight men and hoisted by four women, representing the ten provinces and two territories (at the time) of Canada. As the flag was hoisted, an all-male choir performed an a cappella version of the Olympic Hymn.\n\nOnce the flag was unfurled, a troupe of Bavarian dancers, representing Munich, host of the previous [[1972 Summer Olympics]], entered the stadium with the [[Olympic symbols#Antwerp flag|Antwerp flag]]. Following a brief dance, that flag was then passed from the Mayor of Munich to the IOC President and then to the Mayor of Montreal. Next came a presentation of traditional Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois folk dancers. The two troupes merged in dance together to the strains of \"Vive le Compagnie\" and exited the stadium with the Antwerp Flag, which would be displayed at Montreal City Hall until the opening of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow.\n\nThree cannons were then fired, as the 80-member troupe of female dancers unfolded special crates that released doves and ribbons in the five Olympic colours.\n\nAnother trumpet fanfare announced the arrival of the Olympic Flame. The torch was carried by two 15-year-olds, St\u00e9phane Pr\u00e9fontaine and Sandra Henderson, chosen as representatives of the unity within Canada's linguistic heritage. This would also be the first time two people would light the Olympic flame, and Henderson would become only the second woman to do the honours. The duo would make a lap of the stadium and then climbed a staircase on a special dais at the center of the stadium to set the Olympic flame alight in a temporary white aluminum cauldron. The flame was later transported to a more permanent cauldron just outside the running track to burn throughout the duration of the Games. A choir then performed the Olympic Cantata as onlookers admired the Olympic flame.\n\nThen, the 'Youth of Canada' took to the track to perform a colourful choreographed segment with flags, ribbons and a variety of rhythmic gymnast performers.\n\nThe flag bearers of each team then circled around the speaker's dais as Pierre St-Jean recited the Athletes' Oath and Maurice Forget recited the Judges' Oath, in English and in French, with right hand over the heart and the Canadian flag clutched in the left.\n\nFinally, a choral performance of 'O Canada' in both French and English marked the close of the opening ceremony, as the announcers concluded with a declaration of 'Vive les Jeux de Montreal! Long Live the Montreal Games'.\n\nThe Montreal ceremony would be the last of its kind, as future Olympic ceremonies, beginning with the 1980 Moscow Games, would become more focused on theatrical, cultural and artistic presentations and less on formality and protocol.\n\n== Highlights ==\n\n* These Olympics were the first of two summer games to be organised under the IOC presidency of [[Michael Morris, 3rd Baron Killanin]].\n* [[Taro Aso]] was a member of the Japanese shooting team. 32 years later, he would be elected as the prime minister of Japan.\n* The Games were opened by [[Elizabeth II]], as [[Monarchy of Canada|head of state of Canada]], and several members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] attended the opening ceremonies. This was particularly significant, as these were the first Olympic games hosted on Canadian soil. The Queen's daughter, [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]], also competed in the games as part of the British riding team. Additionally, the Queen's husband, [[Prince Philip]], was President of the [[International Equestrian Federation]] (FEI) at the time.\n* After a rainstorm doused the [[Olympic Flame]] a few days after the games had opened, an official relit the flame using his cigarette lighter. Organizers quickly doused it again and relit it using a backup of the original flame.\n* The Israeli team walked into the stadium at the opening ceremony wearing black ribbons in commemoration of the 1972 [[Munich massacre]].<ref>{{YouTube|-ZqPL9FOHI0}}</ref>\n* Women's events were introduced in basketball, [[team handball|handball]] and [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]].\n* Canada, the host country, finished with five silver and six bronze medals. This was the first time that the host country of the Summer Games had not won any [[gold medals]]. This feat had occurred previously only in the Winter Games \u2013 [[1924 Winter Olympics|1924]] in [[Chamonix]], France, and [[1928 Winter Olympics|1928]] in [[St. Moritz]], Switzerland. This later occurred at the [[1984 Winter Olympics|1984 Winter Games]] in [[Sarajevo]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and again at the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary]], Alberta, Canada.\n* Because of the [[Munich massacre]], security at these games was visible, as it had been earlier in the year at the [[1976 Winter Olympics|Winter Games]] in [[Innsbruck, Austria]].\n* At age 14, gymnast [[Nadia Com\u0103neci]] of Romania became the first person to score a [[Perfect 10 (gymnastics)|perfect 10]] at the Olympics, recording seven 10.00 scores and winning three gold medals, including the [[Gymnastics at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's artistic individual all-around|all-around]]. The scoreboard could hold only 3 digits and the score was shown as 1.00. \n* [[Alberto Juantorena]] of Cuba became the first man to win both the 400 m and 800 m at the same Olympics.\n* Finland's [[Lasse Vir\u00e9n]] repeated his [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]] double win in the 5,000 and 10,000 m runs, the first runner to successfully defend a 5,000 m win (since equalled by Britain's Mo Farah in 2016). Vir\u00e9n finished 5th in the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]], thereby failing to equal [[Emil Z\u00e1topek]]'s 1952 achievements.\n* [[Hasely Crawford]] won Trinidad and Tobago's first Olympic gold medal by finishing first in the 100 meter dash.\n* [[Viktor Saneyev]] of the [[Soviet Union]] won his third consecutive [[triple jump]] gold medal, while [[Klaus Dibiasi]] of Italy did the same in the platform [[Diving (sport)|diving]] event.\n* [[Boris Onishchenko]], a member of the Soviet Union's [[modern pentathlon]] team, was disqualified after it was discovered that he had rigged his [[\u00e9p\u00e9e]] to register a hit when there wasn't one. Because of this, the Soviet modern pentathlon team was disqualified. Due to his disqualification, it was suggested that he earned the nickname of \"Boris DISonish-chenko\". However, many assumed that he was a victim of a Soviet \"win it all\" mentality.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/playback/strangest-moments/episodes/onischenko-pushes-the-button-and-oversteps-boundaries-for-fencing-glory/ |title=Onischenko pushes the button and oversteps boundaries for fencing glory |website=Olympic Channel}}</ref>\n* Five American [[boxing|boxers]] \u2013 [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], [[Leon Spinks]], [[Michael Spinks]], [[Leo Randolph]] and [[Howard Davis Jr.]] won gold medals in [[boxing]]. This has been often called the greatest Olympic boxing team the United States ever had, and, out of the five American gold medalists in boxing, all but Davis went on to become professional world champions.\n* [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] of the United Kingdom was the only female competitor not to have to submit to a [[Sex determination in sports|sex test]].<ref>This has often been reported as fact as early as 1977, but never verified by the Olympics authorities.

Fujimoto broke his leg on the floor exercise, and due to the closeness in the overall standings with the USSR, he hid the extent of the injury. With a broken knee, Fujimoto was able to complete his event on the rings, performing a perfect triple somersault dismount, maintaining perfect posture. He scored a 9.7 thus securing gold for Japan. Years later, when asked if he would do it again, he stated bluntly \"No, I would not.\"<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympics2000/fans_guide/883355.stm \"Fujimoto caps Japanese success\"], BBC, September 29, 2000</ref>\n* The U.S. men's swimming team won all but one gold medal. [[John Naber]] won four gold medals and a silver medal.\n* In winning the gold medal for the men's 100m freestyle, [[Jim Montgomery (swimmer)|Jim Montgomery]] became the first person to break the 50 second mark in the event, taking first place in the final in a time of 49.99.\n* [[Luann Ryon]] won the women's [[Archery]] gold for the USA; Ryon had never before competed at the international level.\n* [[Bruce Jenner]] won the gold medal for [[decathlon]], setting a world record of 8,634 points.\n* [[Alex Oakley]], the Canadian race walker, became the oldest track and field athlete to compete at the Olympic Games. He was aged 50, and taking part in his fifth Olympics.\n* The [[New Zealand men's national field hockey team]] beat Australia to win gold, becoming the first non-Asian/European team to win the gold medal in hockey. It is also the first Olympic games in which hockey was played on artificial turf.\n* The Polish men's volleyball team came back from being down 2 sets against the USSR to win the gold medal.\n* Twenty-year-old [[Morehouse College]] student [[Edwin Moses]] sets a new world record in the 400m hurdles, less than a year after taking up the event. He is also America's only male individual track gold medalist.\n* [[Thomas Bach]] of [[West Germany]] won a gold medal in the [[Fencing at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team foil|team foil]] event in [[Fencing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|fencing]]. He would later become [[IOC President]].\n* Heavyweight boxer [[Clarence Hill (boxer)|Clarence Hill]] won a bronze medal for [[Bermuda]].

Some of the boycotting nations (including Morocco, Cameroon and Egypt) had already participated, however, and withdrew after the first few days. [[Senegal]] and [[Ivory Coast]] were the only African countries that competed throughout the duration of the Games. Elsewhere, both Iraq and Guyana also opted to join the Congolese-led boycott. South Africa had been banned from the Olympics since 1964 due to its [[apartheid]] policies. Other countries, such as El Salvador and Zaire, did not participate in Montreal for purely economic reasons.<ref name=\"or\"/>\n\n[[File:1976 Summer Olympics (Montr\u00e9al) boycotting countries (blue).png|thumb|upright=1.7|Countries boycotting the 1976 Games are shaded blue]]\n\n===Republic of China boycott===\nAn unrelated boycott of the Montreal Games was the main issue between the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC). The ROC team withdrew from the games when Canada's [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government under [[Pierre Trudeau]] told it that the name \"Republic of China\" was not permissible at the Games because Canada had officially recognized the PRC in 1970. Canada attempted a compromise by allowing the ROC the continued use of its national flag and anthem in the Montreal Olympic activities; the ROC refused. Later in November 1976, the IOC recognized the PRC as the only recognized name of any Olympic activities representative of any Chinese government. In 1979 the IOC established in the [[Nagoya Resolution]] that the PRC agreed to participate in IOC activities if the Republic of China was referred to as \"[[Chinese Taipei]]\". [[1980 Summer Olympics|Another boycott]] would occur before the ROC would accept the provisions of the 1979 Resolution although the reason that so many other countries boycotted were not all the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|same as the ROC]].\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

Many citizens regard the Olympiad as a financial disaster for the city as it faced debts for 30 years after the Games had finished. The retractable roof of the Olympic Stadium never properly worked and on several occasions has torn, prompting the stadium to be closed for extended periods of time for repairs. The failure of the [[Montreal Expos]] baseball club is largely blamed on the failure of the Olympic Stadium to transition into an effective and popular venue for the club \u2013 given the massive capacity of the stadium, it often looked unimpressive even with regular crowds in excess of 20,000 spectators.\n\nThe year 1976 was also when the separatist [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] was first elected in Quebec, leading to new legislation to strengthen the legal status of the province's French-speaking majority; this also had the effect of driving migration of English speakers out of the province, especially to Ontario.\n\nMontreal's economy was also changing much like other industrial cities in the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River region of North America. In sum, numerous political, socio-cultural and economic changes affected the city at around the same time as the Olympics that would result in stalled growth and give the appearance of decline. That said, many of these factors existed prior to the Olympics and continued to have an effect on Montreal's growth and relative importance many years afterwards. There is no evidence which definitively proves that the Montreal Olympics played a specific role in that decline.\n\nBefore the 21st century, the relative benefits of the Olympics were defined differently. There were also different methods by which they were financed and presented to the public.\n\nThe Quebec provincial government took over construction when it became evident in 1975 that work had fallen far behind schedule. Work was still ongoing just weeks before the opening date, and the tower was not built. Mayor [[Jean Drapeau]] had confidently predicted in 1970 that \"the Olympics can no more have a deficit than a man can have a baby\", but the debt racked up to a billion dollars that the Quebec government mandated the city pay in full. This would prompt cartoonist [[Terry Mosher|Aislin]] to draw a pregnant Drapeau on the telephone saying, \"Allo, [[Henry Morgentaler|Morgentaler]]?\" in reference to a Montreal abortion provider.<ref>[https://montrealgazette.com/sports/aislin-looks-back-at-the-1976-summer-olympics Aislin looks back at the 1976 Summer Olympics], ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'', July 29, 2016</ref>\n[[File:OlympicStadium.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Olympic Stadium, seen next to the [[Montreal Botanical Garden]].]]\n[[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|The Olympic Stadium]] was designed by French architect [[Roger Taillibert]]. It is often nicknamed \"The Big O\" as a reference to both its name and to the doughnut-shape of the permanent component of the stadium's roof, though \"The Big Owe\" has been used to reference the astronomical cost of the stadium and the 1976 Olympics as a whole. It has never had an effective retractable roof, and the tower (called the Montreal Tower) was completed only after the Olympic Games were over. In December 2006 the stadium's costs were finally paid in full.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-s-big-owe-stadium-debt-is-over-1.602530 |title=Quebec's Big Owe stadium debt is over |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]  |author=CBC News |date= December 19, 2006|accessdate=October 21, 2008}}</ref> The total expenditure (including repairs, renovations, construction, [[interest]], and inflation) amounted to C$1.61&nbsp;billion. Today the stadium lacks a permanent tenant, as the [[Montreal Alouettes]] and [[Montreal Expos]] have moved, though it does host some individual games of the Alouettes as well as the [[Montreal Impact]].\n\nOne of the streets surrounding the Olympic Stadium was renamed to honor [[Pierre de Coubertin]], the founder of the Olympics.\n\nThe boycott by African nations over the inclusion of New Zealand, whose rugby team had played in South Africa that year, was a contributing factor in the massive protests and civil disobedience that occurred during the [[1981 Springbok Tour]] of New Zealand. Official sporting contacts between South Africa and New Zealand did not occur again until after the fall of apartheid.\n\nAustralia's failure to win a gold medal led the country to create the [[Australian Institute of Sport]].\n\nIn 2016, the 40th anniversary celebrations were held. In conjunction with the celebrations, the 2016 [[Quebec Games]] were held.<ref name=\"Global-2016-07-12\">{{cite news |url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2820732/nadia-comaneci-to-watch-jeux-du-quebec-and-attend-montreal-olympics-anniversary/ |title=Nadia Comaneci to watch Jeux du Qu\u00e9bec and attend Montreal Olympics anniversary |author=Matthew Grillo |work=Global News  |publisher=Global.ca |date=July 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcasting==\n*{{flag|Canada}} \u2013 [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC/Radio-Canada]]\n*{{flag|United Kingdom}} - [[BBC]]\n*{{flag|Australia}} - [[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC]], [[Seven Network]], [[Nine Network]]\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Canada|Sports}}\n{{IOC seealso|games=1976 Summer Olympics}}\n*[[Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games#1976 Montreal|Use of performance-enhancing drugs in the Olympic Games \u2014 1976 Montreal]]\n*[[Corridart]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* Paul Charles Howell.
