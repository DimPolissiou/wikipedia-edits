Advanced police school courses last two years, and require one to have been a police officer for at least two years.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Spain===\nIn [[Spain]], there is a [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)|Ministry of the Interior]]'s [[National Police Corps|National Police]] centralized academy near [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]] ({{Coord|40.666044|-4.653832|display=inline}}.) The [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Guardia Civil]] runs two centralized academies, one for enlisted ''guardias'' and [[sub-officer]]s in [[Baeza]] ([[Province of Ja\u00e9n (Spain)|Ja\u00e9n]], {{Coord|37.995590|-3.480421|display=inline}}) and another one for [[Officer (armed forces)|commanding officers]] in two campuses at [[Aranjuez]] ({{Coord|40.052223|-3.600720|display=inline}}) and [[San Lorenzo de El Escorial|El Escorial]] ({{Coord|40.599491|-4.132105|display=inline}}) ([[Community of Madrid|Madrid]]). The autonomous [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Catalan]] and [[Basque Government|Basque]] police forces \u2014the [[Mossos d'Esquadra]] and the [[Ertzaintza]]\u2014 also have their own academies in [[Mollet del Vall\u00e8s]] ([[Province of Barcelona|Barcelona]], {{Coord|41.551442|2.221305|display=inline}}) and [[Arcaute]] ([[\u00c1lava]], {{Coord|42.858187|-2.618719|display=inline}}). No candidates with a criminal record are accepted.\n\nCandidates attend these centralized public academies after passing the police force's [[Civil service entrance examination|entry examination]], this way recruits are already enlisted and will automatically become police officers if they don't fail the course or drop out. Recruits' training is tuition free and the candidates are paid a police cadet's wage as members of the force. Basic training ranges from 5 months for an entry-level ''polic\u00eda nacional'' or ''guardia civil'' to 9 months for a ''mosso'', but realistically takes 18 months to two years including practicums and additional training. Local police forces including [[Polic\u00eda Municipal de Madrid|Madrid]]'s or [[Gu\u00e0rdia Urbana de Barcelona|Barcelona]]'s are often trained at these large public academies too. High-rank or highly specialized courses are longer and eventually lead to a college-like degree.\n\nThe Spanish police academies must not be confused with the many fee-paying private ''academias'' training potential candidates to pass the entry examination beforehand. While these private academies may be helpful, studying at them is not requireed and potential candidates are able to take the entry examination without thesecourses.\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nSri Lanka established the [[Sri Lanka Police Academy]] in 2008, bringing together several police training institutions including the Sri Lanka Police College.\n\n===Sweden===\n{{Details|Swedish Police Authority#Police training}}\nSince 2015, police training has been entirely outsourced by the [[Swedish Police Authority]], and is carried out at three universities: [[Linnaeus University|V\u00e4xj\u00f6]], [[Ume\u00e5 University|Ume\u00e5]], and [[S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn University|S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn]].<ref>{{cite web|title=S\u00f6dert\u00f6rns h\u00f6gskola f\u00e5r utbilda poliser|url=https://polisen.se/Stockholms_lan/Arkiv/Pressmeddelandearkiv/Rikspolisstyrelsen/Sodertorns-hogskola-far-utbilda-poliser/|publisher=Swedish Police Authority|accessdate=10 August 2015|language=Swedish}}</ref> The training covers five terms, and the last two include six months of paid workplace practicum as a Police Trainee.

In 1938, a police college, (high school), was established in [[Ankara]] in order to prepare students for the Police Academy. Today, the police academy recruits police officers in 26 schools located in different parts of Turkey, and police chiefs in one school located in [[Ankara]].\n\n===United Arab Emirates===\nIn UAE, the [[Emirate]]s either train their own police force or outsource training to academies of other [[Emirate]]s. There are mainly two academies, one located in [[Abu Dhabi]] and the other in [[Dubai]].\n\n====Abu Dhabi====\nIn the Abu Dhabi Police Academy, the study program includes practical and field training. After successful completion of the program the student is awarded a bachelor's degree in Law and Policing Sciences.\n\nAn Institute for officer training affiliated with the Police College was established in 1992. In 2002, the system of study in the college was changed to incorporate training theory programs and field work.\n\nThe four years of study are divided into two levels of study consisting of eight terms:\n\n=====Basic level \u2013 two years=====\nOne year for theoretical study and another for field work.\n\n=====Advanced level \u2013 two years=====\nThese two levels are preceded by an introductory period for the physical and psychological preparation of the students. After successful completion of the study and training programs the student will be awarded a bachelor's degree in Police Sciences and Criminal Justice.\n\n====Dubai====\nThe Dubai Police Academy was founded in 1987, and was granted autonomy from the police force as long as it retained some affiliation with Dubai Police General Headquarters. It was fully inaugurated in 1989 in the presence of [[Sheikh Maktoum Bin Rashid Al Maktoum]]. In 1992, degrees offered by the academy were given university equivalency. \n\nThe first class was from 1987 to 1988, and consisted of 51 cadets and 30 full-time students, (some of whom were existing police officers), which graduated in 1991. During the academic year of 1996\u20131997, students from other Arabic countries such as Yemen and the Palestinian Territories were admitted.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n\n====England and Wales====\nAll candidates for the 43 police forces for England and Wales must be over the age of 18\u00bd; of a reasonable standard of physical fitness, with good health and eyesight.

Each state has an agency which certifies state-specific police academies and their programs. Most states have minimum physical and academic requirements to be completed prior to entry into the academy. Some states may require additional certifications before qualification as a police officer. While some states allow open enrollment in police academies, many require cadets to be hired by a police department in order to attend training. Departments and/or state certification agencies may also require individuals to pass background checks, psychological evaluations, polygraph exams, drug screenings,, firearms qualifications and demonstrations of driving skills as prerequisites of employment/certification.\n    ====Federal====\nWhile some federal law enforcement agencies have their own training requirements and training facilities, 91 federal law enforcement agencies (including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and [[United States Marshals Service]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fletc.gov/current-partners|title=Current Partners - FLETC|website=www.fletc.gov|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> require agents, officers and prospective agents/officers to attend basic and in-service training at the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers]] (FLETC).

All law enforcement officers in the state are certified as such by a governing body appointed by the governor called the ''Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission'' under the [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]]. All applicants must pass a state examination and be hired by a law enforcement agency within 4 years of graduation to be considered certified.\n    ====Kentucky====\nAll law enforcement officers in Kentucky, (except as listed below), hired after 1998 are required to complete the minimum screening, physical training and classroom requirements of the Kentucky's ''Police Officer Professional Standards (POPS)'' prior to being certified, and acting, as a law enforcement officer.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://docjt.ky.gov/history.html|title=Welcome to the Department of Criminal Justice Training|first=|last=bbowling@docjt.jus.state.ky.us|website=docjt.ky.gov|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> Larger agencies, such as the [[Kentucky State Police]], as well as the [[Louisville Metro Police]] and the [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] Division of Police, operate their own police academies and may have requirements that exceed the minimum POPS standards. Agencies in Kentucky who do not run their own academies send their prospective officers to a 16-week basic training class at the Kentucky Department of Criminal Justice Training Academy, operated by the [[Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet]] and located on the campus of [[Eastern Kentucky University]] in [[Richmond, Kentucky|Richmond]]. <ref name=\"auto\"/> Exceptions to POPS training and certification are officers hired prior to 1998 and elected law enforcement officers whose duties and requirements are set forth in the [[Kentucky Constitution]]. These include [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriffs]], [[Constables in the United States|constables]], [[coroner]]s and [[jailer]]s, (though generally not deputies).  Many of these office holders, however, hold POPS certification from previous employment as law enforcement officers prior to their election and some will receive POPS certification or approved equivalent training before taking office.\n    ====Maryland====\nIn Maryland, the [[Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commission]] is the civilian governing body that sets standards for law enforcement personnel within the state. Most major [[List of law enforcement agencies in Maryland|law enforcement agencies]] operate their own academy in which recruits must pass over 550 objectives including, (but not limited to), criminal and traffic law, officer safety techniques, [[self-defense|defensive tactics]], report writing, a 40-hour block of emergency vehicle operations, a 40-hour block of [[Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation|First Responder]], and a 40-hour block of weapon training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dpscs.state.md.us/aboutdpscs/pct/peltp/peltp.shtml|title=DPSCS.state.md.us|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> Most agencies operate non-resident academies; however, the [[Maryland State Police]] requires recruits to live at the academy and, dependent on their performance level for the week, may leave campus for the weekend.<ref>[http://recruiting.mdsp.org/training.asp Recruiting.mdsp.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005063842/http://recruiting.mdsp.org/training.asp |date=October 5, 2011 }}</ref> Many colleges such as the [[University of Maryland]] and other [[community colleges]] offer police academy instruction as well.<ref>[http://www.outlook.umd.edu/article.cfm?id=2041 Outlook.umd.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607130843/http://www.outlook.umd.edu/article.cfm?id=2041 |date=June 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n    ====Michigan====\nIn Michigan, in order to become law enforcement officers, all applicants have the option to be certified by the ''Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards'' or MCOLES. All persons wishing to become police officers in the State of Michigan must be certified through MCOLES. Cadets must pass a physical fitness exam as well as a reading and writing exam. Applicants also cannot have any felonies, weapons violations, or a history of domestic violence posted on their criminal records. Police academies are most often part of [[community colleges]], city or county police and sheriff departments, or the [[Michigan State Police]].\n\nAfter the police academy, candidates take the MCOLES test. Upon successful completion, candidates are 'certifiable' and have a period of one year to obtain employment as law enforcement officers, (if not sponsored by an agency). If a candidate is unable to obtain a law enforcement position within that year, and if the candidate wishes to be considered in the future, he/she must attend a two-week re-certification course, which adds a year to the candidate's window of opportunity.\n    ====New Hampshire====\nNew Hampshire's PSTC, (Police Standards and Training Council), provides all training and maintains certification standards for every full and part-time law enforcement officer in the state. This includes anyone who has the power of arrest, (except federal officers), under New Hampshire law.   The PSTC also provides training and certification for correctional officers employed directly by the State. All recruits must have at least a conditional offer of employment from a law enforcement agency, have a clear background check, pass a medical exam and a physical fitness test. Agencies may add other qualifications such as education, polygraph and drug exams. The PSTC law enforcement academies require each recruit to qualify with a firearm, demonstrate driving skills, maintaining physical fitness, pass subject matter exams and scenario evaluations as a condition of certification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pstc.nh.gov/|title=NH Police Standards and Training Council|website=www.pstc.nh.gov|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nMost agencies in the state use a Field Training Officer program to provide additional training and evaluation of new hires.\n    ====Texas====\nThe agency which certifies police academies in Texas is the [[Texas Commission on Law Enforcement]] (TCOLE). Many major cities and sheriff's offices also operate their own training academies, while some smaller municipalities cooperate to maintain regional academies. Some community colleges offer police training courses as well. There are three state-level law enforcement academies: the [[Texas Highway Patrol|Texas Department of Public Safety]] which trains state troopers, the [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]] who train game wardens, and the [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] that trains state [[Corrections Officer|corrections officers]]. Police academies typically last from 18 to 30 weeks, though there are many variations. All police cadets are required to obtain at least a Basic Peace Officer Proficiency Certification from TCOLE before beginning active duty; some academies also require their cadets to obtain an Intermediate certification before graduating. TCOLE offers certifications for jailers and corrections officers, who must also undergo training prior to being commissioned, (albeit typically much less than police officers).\n    ====Utah====\nThe basis of the Utah basic training for police officers is to protect the community and the citizens the officers are serving. They do this by completing basic training, firearms training, curriculum development, canine training, defensive tactics, emergency vehicle operations, and physical fitness training. Training for Utah officers is broken into two separate sections, called blocks. The two blocks are Special Functions and Law Enforcement. In order to be certified in the state of Utah an individual must successfully finish both blocks of training. This training is intended to teach the officers to be as professional and as up to date as possible. Officers are also required to do an additional 40 hours of training annually in order to stay up to date on all current laws and police procedures.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://publicsafety.utah.gov/post/academy/basic.html|title = Utah Department of Public Safety|date = March 8, 2013|accessdate = March 20, 2015|website = The Academy - Basic Training Bureau|publisher = State of Utah|last = |first = |url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402151823/http://publicsafety.utah.gov/post/academy/basic.html|archivedate = April 2, 2015|df = }}</ref>\n\n===Vietnam===\nLocated in Tu Liem district, [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]], The Vietnam People's Police Academy is one of the leading schools of the [[Vietnam People's Public Security]], training officers with university degrees and postgraduate degrees.

The NPA's new cadets and 4th class cadets, alongside their armed forces counterparts, have had a joint 4th class cadet training program since 2008, after completing it the police officer cadets spend the remaining 4 years of study in Semarang.\n\n===India===\n{{Main|Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy}}\nLocated in [[Hyderabad, India]], [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy]] is the national institute for training of [[Indian Police Service]] (IPS) officers before they are assigned to their respective Indian state cadres.\n\n===Ireland===\n{{Main|Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na College}}\nIn the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na College]] in [[Templemore]] is the only police academy, All trainees for the [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na]] and [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na Reserve]] study here.\n\n===Italy===\n\nFor prospective candidates to the [[Polizia di Stato]], basic education is conducted at the Scuola Superiore di Polizia while the Scuola di perfezionamento per le Forze di Polizia conducts advanced education and implements courses on new legislation, regulations and operational techniques.<ref>http://www.poliziadistato.it/articolo/965M</ref>\n\n===Malaysia===\nIn Malaysia, there are fifteen police academies, one of them being the [[Royal Malaysia Police College]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]] which is a combination of four police training institutes, (the Kuala Kubu Baru Police College, the Special Branch Training School, the College of Criminal Investigation, and Traffic School), which train higher-ranking officers. The college has plans to be upgraded to a Police University in collaboration with the [[Sultan Idris Education University]].\n\n===Nepal===\n{{Main|National Police Academy, Nepal}}\nThe National Police Academy (NPA), (formerly known as Central Police Training Centre (CPTC), founded in 1956), was established with the onset of the police regulation of 1993.\n\n===New Zealand===\nLocated in Papakowhai, approximately 2 km north of Porirua City, the [[Royal New Zealand Police College]] is the central training institution for all police recruits and police officers in New Zealand.\n\n===Norway===\n{{Main|Norwegian Police University College}}\nThe [[Norwegian Police University College]] offers education for the [[police force]] of Norway, including a three-year basic education program and a possible expansion that would offer a [[Master's degree]].\n\n===Philippines===\nDuring the 1980s, the [[Philippine National Police Academy]] in [[Cavite]] served as a school for selected enlisted personnel and civilians to join as Police/Fire Lieutenants in the defunct [[Integrated National Police]]. After the merging of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] and INP on January 1, 1991 it became the primary officer's school for the new [[Philippine National Police]], the [[Bureau of Fire Protection]] and the [[Bureau of Jail Management and Penology]], all under the [[Department of the Interior and Local Government]]. The Philippine National Police Academy graduates are automatically appointed as Inspectors/Lieutenants in the Philippine National Police, Bureau of Fire Protection, and the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology according to their choice of public safety curriculum during their cadetship. This is under the supervision of the DILG and the [[Philippine Public Safety College]].\n\n===Poland===\nThe Polish Police college is located in the town of [[Szczytno]]. Police schools are in [[Pi\u0142a]], [[S\u0142upsk]], [[Katowice]], and [[Legionowo]]. Border guard training centers are located in [[K\u0119trzyn]], [[Koszalin]], and [[Luba\u0144]]. Poland also has a \"higher educational institution\" called ''Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Policji.'' where officers are enrolled in academic studies and trained in modern policing techniques, weapons' handling, and informatics.\n\n===Romania===\nOffering three levels of training for officers, ([[Bachelor's Degree]] (3 years), [[Master's Degree]], (2 years) and [[Doctorate|Dr]] (3+1 years)), The Romanian Police academy is located in [[Bucure\u015fti]].\n\nThe Border Police School and Training Center is located in [[Oradea]], [[Avram Iancu]], the Coast Guard Center is in Constanta. Centers for Training Border Police Personnel are in [[Ia\u0219i]] and [[Orsova]].\n\n===Serbia===\nIn Serbia, future police officers are trained at the [[Basic Police Training Centre]] in Sremska Kamenica, the former Police High School. The training lasts for 1 year and is followed by a 6-month probation period at a Regional Police Department. The skills the recruits learn are for general jurisdiction police officers, and after they are employed, they may specialize in a line of work (traffic police, border police, special forces, etc.).\nThere is also the [[Academy of Criminalistic and Police Studies]], a higher education institution established as a legal successor of the Advanced School of Internal Affairs, formed in 1972; and Police Academy, formed in 1993.\n\n===Slovak Republic===\nIn the Slovak Republic, the Police College, (University), offers courses in security specialization for police, public administration, and private security services. Some branches are open to civilians, while some only allow police officers, firefighters, soldiersand the like. The schools offer Bachelor's Degrees, Master's Degrees, and Doctoral Degrees.\n\nAll police officers must pass through the basic training centers for new police officers, called secondary police schools.\n\n===Slovenia===\nIn Slovenia, the police academy conducts training programs, education, and training for the police and for external users. All candidates need to have a high-school education before attending. Candidates spend eighteen months in basic training in order to become a police officer, followed by a six-month evaluation period. Advanced police school courses last two years, and require one to have been a police officer for at least two years.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Spain===\nIn [[Spain]], there is a [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)|Ministry of the Interior]]'s [[National Police Corps|National Police]] centralized academy near [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]] ({{Coord|40.666044|-4.653832|display=inline}}.) The [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Guardia Civil]] runs two centralized academies, one for enlisted ''guardias'' and [[sub-officer]]s in [[Baeza]] ([[Province of Ja\u00e9n (Spain)|Ja\u00e9n]], {{Coord|37.995590|-3.480421|display=inline}}) and another one for [[Officer (armed forces)|commanding officers]] in two campuses at [[Aranjuez]] ({{Coord|40.052223|-3.600720|display=inline}}) and [[San Lorenzo de El Escorial|El Escorial]] ({{Coord|40.599491|-4.132105|display=inline}}) ([[Community of Madrid|Madrid]]). The autonomous [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Catalan]] and [[Basque Government|Basque]] police forces \u2014the [[Mossos d'Esquadra]] and the [[Ertzaintza]]\u2014 also have their own academies in [[Mollet del Vall\u00e8s]] ([[Province of Barcelona|Barcelona]], {{Coord|41.551442|2.221305|display=inline}}) and [[Arcaute]] ([[\u00c1lava]], {{Coord|42.858187|-2.618719|display=inline}}). No candidates with a criminal record are accepted.\n\nCandidates attend these centralized public academies after passing the police force's [[Civil service entrance examination|entry examination]], this way recruits are already enlisted and will automatically become police officers if they don't fail the course or drop out. Recruits' training is tuition free and the candidates are paid a police cadet's wage as members of the force. Basic training ranges from 5 months for an entry-level ''polic\u00eda nacional'' or ''guardia civil'' to 9 months for a ''mosso'', but realistically takes 18 months to two years including practicums and additional training. Local police forces including [[Polic\u00eda Municipal de Madrid|Madrid]]'s or [[Gu\u00e0rdia Urbana de Barcelona|Barcelona]]'s are often trained at these large public academies too. High-rank or highly specialized courses are longer and eventually lead to a college-like degree.\n\nThe Spanish police academies must not be confused with the many fee-paying private ''academias'' training potential candidates to pass the entry examination beforehand. While these private academies may be helpful, studying at them is not requireed and potential candidates are able to take the entry examination without thesecourses.\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nSri Lanka established the [[Sri Lanka Police Academy]] in 2008, bringing together several police training institutions including the Sri Lanka Police College.\n\n===Sweden===\n{{Details|Swedish Police Authority#Police training}}\nSince 2015, police training has been entirely outsourced by the [[Swedish Police Authority]], and is carried out at three universities: [[Linnaeus University|V\u00e4xj\u00f6]], [[Ume\u00e5 University|Ume\u00e5]], and [[S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn University|S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn]].<ref>{{cite web|title=S\u00f6dert\u00f6rns h\u00f6gskola f\u00e5r utbilda poliser|url=https://polisen.se/Stockholms_lan/Arkiv/Pressmeddelandearkiv/Rikspolisstyrelsen/Sodertorns-hogskola-far-utbilda-poliser/|publisher=Swedish Police Authority|accessdate=10 August 2015|language=Swedish}}</ref> The training covers five terms, and the last two include six months of paid workplace practicum as a Police Trainee.

In 1938, a police college, (high school), was established in [[Ankara]] in order to prepare students for the Police Academy. Today, the police academy recruits police officers in 26 schools located in different parts of Turkey, and police chiefs in one school located in [[Ankara]].\n\n===United Arab Emirates===\nIn UAE, the [[Emirate]]s either train their own police force or outsource training to academies of other [[Emirate]]s. There are mainly two academies, one located in [[Abu Dhabi]] and the other in [[Dubai]].\n\n====Abu Dhabi====\nIn the Abu Dhabi Police Academy, the study program includes practical and field training. After successful completion of the program the student is awarded a bachelor's degree in Law and Policing Sciences.\n\nAn Institute for officer training affiliated with the Police College was established in 1992. In 2002, the system of study in the college was changed to incorporate training theory programs and field work.\n\nThe four years of study are divided into two levels of study consisting of eight terms:\n\n=====Basic level \u2013 two years=====\nOne year for theoretical study and another for field work.\n\n=====Advanced level \u2013 two years=====\nThese two levels are preceded by an introductory period for the physical and psychological preparation of the students. After successful completion of the study and training programs the student will be awarded a bachelor's degree in Police Sciences and Criminal Justice.\n\n====Dubai====\nThe Dubai Police Academy was founded in 1987, and was granted autonomy from the police force as long as it retained some affiliation with Dubai Police General Headquarters. It was fully inaugurated in 1989 in the presence of [[Sheikh Maktoum Bin Rashid Al Maktoum]]. In 1992, degrees offered by the academy were given university equivalency. \n\nThe first class was from 1987 to 1988, and consisted of 51 cadets and 30 full-time students, (some of whom were existing police officers), which graduated in 1991. During the academic year of 1996\u20131997, students from other Arabic countries such as Yemen and the Palestinian Territories were admitted.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n\n====England and Wales====\nAll candidates for the 43 police forces for England and Wales must be over the age of 18\u00bd; of a reasonable standard of physical fitness, with good health and eyesight.  Candidates also must hold British citizenship, be a citizen of the Commonwealth with no restrictions on his or her stay within Britain or be a citizen of the Republic of Ireland. All candidates serve two years as probationary constables, which will be spent training in both academic and practical situations. From 2007, all training was managed by the now defunct [[National Policing Improvement Agency]] with the [[College of Policing]] taking over in 2013.\n\n====Scotland====\nAll new police officers in Scotland attend an initial 11-week training course at the [[Scottish Police College]] at [[Tulliallan Castle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Training - Police Officers - Police Scotland|url=http://www.scotland.police.uk/recruitment/police-officers/training/|website=Police Service of Scotland - Training Information|accessdate=7 October 2016}}</ref> The college has been operating since 1954 and hosts initial training of new officers as well as a range of courses such as the training of traffic officers and detectives.<ref>{{cite web|title=Police Scotland College - About Us - Police Scotland|url=http://www.scotland.police.uk/about-us/police-scotland/scottish-police-college/|website=Police Service of Scotland - About Us|accessdate=7 October 2016}}</ref> Many courses have received accreditation from the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]] (SQA) or are credit rated on the [[Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework]] (SCQF).

Each state has an agency which certifies state-specific police academies and their programs. Most states have minimum physical and academic requirements to be completed prior to entry into the academy. Some states may require additional certifications before qualification as a police officer. While some states allow open enrollment in police academies, many require cadets to be hired by a police department in order to attend training. Departments and/or state certification agencies may also require individuals to pass background checks, psychological evaluations, polygraph exams, drug screenings,, firearms qualifications and demonstrations of driving skills as prerequisites of employment/certification.\n    ====Federal====\nWhile some federal law enforcement agencies have their own training requirements and training facilities, 91 federal law enforcement agencies (including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and [[United States Marshals Service]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fletc.gov/current-partners|title=Current Partners - FLETC|website=www.fletc.gov|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> require agents, officers and prospective agents/officers to attend basic and in-service training at the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers]] (FLETC).

All law enforcement officers in the state are certified as such by a governing body appointed by the governor called the ''Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission'' under the [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]]. All applicants must pass a state examination and be hired by a law enforcement agency within 4 years of graduation to be considered certified.\n    ====Kentucky====\nAll law enforcement officers in Kentucky, (except as listed below), hired after 1998 are required to complete the minimum screening, physical training and classroom requirements of the Kentucky's ''Police Officer Professional Standards (POPS)'' prior to being certified, and acting, as a law enforcement officer.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://docjt.ky.gov/history.html|title=Welcome to the Department of Criminal Justice Training|first=|last=bbowling@docjt.jus.state.ky.us|website=docjt.ky.gov|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> Larger agencies, such as the [[Kentucky State Police]], as well as the [[Louisville Metro Police]] and the [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] Division of Police, operate their own police academies and may have requirements that exceed the minimum POPS standards. Agencies in Kentucky who do not run their own academies send their prospective officers to a 16-week basic training class at the Kentucky Department of Criminal Justice Training Academy, operated by the [[Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet]] and located on the campus of [[Eastern Kentucky University]] in [[Richmond, Kentucky|Richmond]]. <ref name=\"auto\"/> Exceptions to POPS training and certification are officers hired prior to 1998 and elected law enforcement officers whose duties and requirements are set forth in the [[Kentucky Constitution]]. These include [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriffs]], [[Constables in the United States|constables]], [[coroner]]s and [[jailer]]s, (though generally not deputies).  Many of these office holders, however, hold POPS certification from previous employment as law enforcement officers prior to their election and some will receive POPS certification or approved equivalent training before taking office.\n    ====Maryland====\nIn Maryland, the [[Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commission]] is the civilian governing body that sets standards for law enforcement personnel within the state. Most major [[List of law enforcement agencies in Maryland|law enforcement agencies]] operate their own academy in which recruits must pass over 550 objectives including, (but not limited to), criminal and traffic law, officer safety techniques, [[self-defense|defensive tactics]], report writing, a 40-hour block of emergency vehicle operations, a 40-hour block of [[Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation|First Responder]], and a 40-hour block of weapon training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dpscs.state.md.us/aboutdpscs/pct/peltp/peltp.shtml|title=DPSCS.state.md.us|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> Most agencies operate non-resident academies; however, the [[Maryland State Police]] requires recruits to live at the academy and, dependent on their performance level for the week, may leave campus for the weekend.<ref>[http://recruiting.mdsp.org/training.asp Recruiting.mdsp.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005063842/http://recruiting.mdsp.org/training.asp |date=October 5, 2011 }}</ref> Many colleges such as the [[University of Maryland]] and other [[community colleges]] offer police academy instruction as well.<ref>[http://www.outlook.umd.edu/article.cfm?id=2041 Outlook.umd.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607130843/http://www.outlook.umd.edu/article.cfm?id=2041 |date=June 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n    ====Michigan====\nIn Michigan, in order to become law enforcement officers, all applicants have the option to be certified by the ''Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards'' or MCOLES. All persons wishing to become police officers in the State of Michigan must be certified through MCOLES. Cadets must pass a physical fitness exam as well as a reading and writing exam. Applicants also cannot have any felonies, weapons violations, or a history of domestic violence posted on their criminal records. Police academies are most often part of [[community colleges]], city or county police and sheriff departments, or the [[Michigan State Police]].\n\nAfter the police academy, candidates take the MCOLES test. Upon successful completion, candidates are 'certifiable' and have a period of one year to obtain employment as law enforcement officers, (if not sponsored by an agency). If a candidate is unable to obtain a law enforcement position within that year, and if the candidate wishes to be considered in the future, he/she must attend a two-week re-certification course, which adds a year to the candidate's window of opportunity.\n    ====New Hampshire====\nNew Hampshire's PSTC, (Police Standards and Training Council), provides all training and maintains certification standards for every full and part-time law enforcement officer in the state. This includes anyone who has the power of arrest, (except federal officers), under New Hampshire law.   The PSTC also provides training and certification for correctional officers employed directly by the State. All recruits must have at least a conditional offer of employment from a law enforcement agency, have a clear background check, pass a medical exam and a physical fitness test. Agencies may add other qualifications such as education, polygraph and drug exams. The PSTC law enforcement academies require each recruit to qualify with a firearm, demonstrate driving skills, maintaining physical fitness, pass subject matter exams and scenario evaluations as a condition of certification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pstc.nh.gov/|title=NH Police Standards and Training Council|website=www.pstc.nh.gov|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nMost agencies in the state use a Field Training Officer program to provide additional training and evaluation of new hires.\n    ====Texas====\nThe agency which certifies police academies in Texas is the [[Texas Commission on Law Enforcement]] (TCOLE). Many major cities and sheriff's offices also operate their own training academies, while some smaller municipalities cooperate to maintain regional academies. Some community colleges offer police training courses as well. There are three state-level law enforcement academies: the [[Texas Highway Patrol|Texas Department of Public Safety]] which trains state troopers, the [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]] who train game wardens, and the [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] that trains state [[Corrections Officer|corrections officers]]. Police academies typically last from 18 to 30 weeks, though there are many variations. All police cadets are required to obtain at least a Basic Peace Officer Proficiency Certification from TCOLE before beginning active duty; some academies also require their cadets to obtain an Intermediate certification before graduating. TCOLE offers certifications for jailers and corrections officers, who must also undergo training prior to being commissioned, (albeit typically much less than police officers).\n    ====Utah====\nThe basis of the Utah basic training for police officers is to protect the community and the citizens the officers are serving. They do this by completing basic training, firearms training, curriculum development, canine training, defensive tactics, emergency vehicle operations, and physical fitness training. Training for Utah officers is broken into two separate sections, called blocks. The two blocks are Special Functions and Law Enforcement. In order to be certified in the state of Utah an individual must successfully finish both blocks of training. This training is intended to teach the officers to be as professional and as up to date as possible. Officers are also required to do an additional 40 hours of training annually in order to stay up to date on all current laws and police procedures.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://publicsafety.utah.gov/post/academy/basic.html|title = Utah Department of Public Safety|date = March 8, 2013|accessdate = March 20, 2015|website = The Academy - Basic Training Bureau|publisher = State of Utah|last = |first = |url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402151823/http://publicsafety.utah.gov/post/academy/basic.html|archivedate = April 2, 2015|df = }}</ref>\n\n===Vietnam===\nLocated in Tu Liem district, [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]], The Vietnam People's Police Academy is one of the leading schools of the [[Vietnam People's Public Security]], training officers with university degrees and postgraduate degrees.

Espresso coffee can be made with a wide variety of coffee beans and roasts. Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, has a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and has ''crema'' on top (a foam with a creamy consistency).<ref>Illy, \"Il caff\u00e8 e i cinque sensi\" [http://www.illy.com/wps/wcm/connect/it/caffe/degustazione-caffe]: \"La tazzina di porcellana bianca incornicia la ''crema'': una trama sottile nei toni del nocciola, percorsa da leggere striature rossastre\"</ref> As a result of the pressurized brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso are very concentrated. The three dispersed phases in espresso are what make this beverage unique. The first dispersed phase is an emulsion of oil droplets.  The second phase is suspended solids, while the third is the layer of gas bubbles or foam.  The dispersion of very small oil droplets is perceived in the mouth as creamy.  This characteristic of espresso contributes to what is known as the body of the beverage.  These oil droplets preserve some of the aromatic compounds that are lost to the air in other coffee forms.

The act of producing a shot of espresso is often termed \"pulling\" a shot, originating from lever espresso machines, which require pulling down a handle attached to a spring-loaded piston, forcing hot water through the coffee at high pressure.

Seventeen years later, in 1901, Luigi Bezzera, from [[Milan]], devised and patented several improvements to the espresso machine, the first of which was applied for on 19 December 1901. Titled \"Innovations in the machinery to prepare and immediately serve coffee beverage\"; Patent No. 153/94, 61707, was granted on 5 June 1902. In 1903, the patent was bought by Desiderio Pavoni, who founded the La Pavoni company and began to produce the machine industrially, manufacturing one machine daily in a small workshop in Via Parini, [[Milan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-long-history-of-the-espresso-machine-126012814/|title=The Long History of the Espresso Machine|last=Stamp|first=Jimmy|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref>\n\nThe popularity of espresso developed in various ways; a detailed discussion of the spread of espresso is given in {{Harv|Morris|2007}}, which is a source of various statements below. In Italy, the rise of espresso consumption was associated with urbanization, [[espresso bar]]s providing a place for socializing. Further, coffee [[price controls|prices were controlled]] by local authorities, provided the coffee was consumed standing up, encouraging the \"stand at a bar\" culture.\n\nIn the English-speaking world, espresso became popular, particularly in the form of [[cappuccino]], owing to the tradition of drinking coffee with milk and the exotic appeal of the foam; in the United States, this was more often in the form of [[latte]]s, with or without flavored syrups added. The latte is claimed to have been invented in the 1950s by Italian American Lino Meiorin of [[Caffe Mediterraneum]] in [[Berkeley, California]], as a long cappuccino, and was then popularized in Seattle,<ref>{{cite web | website = Caffe Mediterraneum | title = Invention of the Caffe Latte | url = http://www.caffemed.com/about_us | accessdate = 19 April 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090614060123/http://www.caffemed.com/about_us | archive-date = 14 June 2009 | url-status = dead }}</ref> and then nationally and internationally by Seattle-based [[Starbucks]] in the late 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, espresso grew in popularity among youth in the 1950s, who felt more welcome in the coffee shops than in [[pub]]s. Espresso was initially popular, particularly within the Italian diaspora, growing in popularity with tourism to Italy exposing others to espresso, as developed by Eiscaf\u00e8s established by Italians in Germany. Initially, expatriate Italian espresso bars were seen as downmarket venues, serving the working-class Italian diaspora and thus providing appeal to the alternative subculture; this can still be seen in the United States in Italian American neighborhoods, such as [[North End, Boston|Boston's North End]], [[Little Italy, Manhattan|New York's Little Italy]], and [[North Beach, San Francisco|San Francisco's North Beach]]. As specialty coffee developed in the 1980s (following earlier developments in the 1970s and even 1960s), an indigenous artisanal coffee culture developed, with espresso instead positioned as an upmarket drink.\n\nIn the 2010s, [[coffee culture]] commentators distinguish large-chain mid-market coffee as \"Second Wave Coffee\", and upmarket artisanal coffee as \"[[Third wave of coffee|Third Wave Coffee]]\". In the Middle East and Asia, espresso is growing in popularity, with the opening of Western coffee-shop chains.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bbQrDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=espresso+became+popular+because+of+cappuccino&source=bl&ots=RrpyrJSKIE&sig=IwKrxvqfae1TCPzE7DtNqt8vtvs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjc09zXp8vYAhVH82MKHXZaBWIQ6AEIYTAJ#v=onepage&q=espresso%20became%20popular%20because%20of%20cappuccino&f=false|title=Coffee Culture|last=Hutchins|first=Timothy|date=3 July 2017|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781387074518|language=en}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Caf\u00e9 vs. home preparation===\n[[File:2018 0121 Quick Mill 0820 espresso machine.jpg|thumb|A Quickmill 820 home espresso machine]]\nHome espresso machines have increased in popularity with the general rise of interest in espresso. Today, a wide range of home espresso equipment can be found in kitchen and appliance stores, online vendors, and department stores. The first espresso machine for home use was the [[Gaggia]] Gilda.{{sfn|Bersten|1993|page=131}} Soon afterwards, similar machines such as the Faema Faemina, FE-AR La Peppina and VAM Caravel followed suit in similar form factor and operational principles.{{sfn|Bersten|1993|page=132-133}} These machines still have a small but dedicated share of fans. Until the advent of the first small electrical pump-based espresso machines such as the Gaggia Baby and Quickmill 810, home espresso machines were not widely adopted. In recent years, the increased availability of convenient counter-top fully automatic home espresso makers and pod-based espresso serving systems has increased the quantity of espresso consumed at home. The popularity of home espresso making parallels the increase of [[home roasting coffee|home coffee roasting]]. Some amateurs pursue both [[home roasting coffee]] and making espresso.\n\n{{see also|Espresso machine}}\n\n==Etymology and spelling==\n[[File:Italian-American cafe espresso shop on MacDougal Street 8d21752v.jpg|thumb|right|An Italian-American espresso shop.]]\nAlthough some Anglo-American dictionaries simply refer to \"pressed-out\",<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary\n | title = espresso\n | url = http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50078079/50078079spg1\n | accessdate = 30 October 2009\n | year = 1989\n | publisher = Oxford University press\n}}</ref> \"espresso\", much like the English word \"express\", conveys the senses of \"just for you\" and \"quickly\", which can be related to the method of espresso preparation.\n\n{{quote|The words ''express'', ''expres'' and ''espresso'' each have several meanings in English, French and Italian.

The Italian [[multiplier (linguistics)|multiplier]] term ''doppio'' is often used for a double, with ''solo'' and ''triplo'' being more rarely used for singles and triples. The single shot is the traditional shot size, being the maximum that could easily be pulled on a lever machine.\n\nSingle baskets are sharply tapered or stepped down in diameter to provide comparable depth to the double baskets and, therefore, comparable resistance to water pressure. Most double baskets are gently tapered (the \"Faema model\"), while others, such as the La Marzocco, have straight sides. Triple baskets are normally straight-sided.\n\nPortafilters will often come with two spouts, usually closely spaced, and a double-size basket \u2013 each spout can optionally dispense into a separate cup, yielding two solo-size (but doppio-brewed) shots, or into a single cup (hence the close spacing). True ''solo'' shots are rare, with a single shot in a caf\u00e9 generally being half of a ''doppio'' shot.\n\nIn espresso-based drinks in America, particularly larger milk-based drinks, a drink with three or four shots of espresso will be called a \"triple\" or \"quad\", respectively.\n\n=== Length ===\nThe length of the shot can be ''ristretto'' (or ''stretto'') (reduced), ''normale'' or standard (normal), or ''lungo'' (long):<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/07/travel/fare-of-the-country-in-italy-espresso-is-the-elixir-of-life.html|title=Fare of the Country: In Italy, Espresso is the Elixir of Life|last=Hofmann|first=Paul|date=7 August 1983|access-date=25 March 2018|language=en}}</ref> these may correspond to a smaller or larger drink with the same amount of ground coffee and same level of extraction or to different length of extraction. Proportions vary and the volume (and low density) of crema make volume-based comparisons difficult (precise measurement uses the mass of the drink). Typically ''ristretto'' is half the volume of ''normale'', and ''lungo'' is double to triple the ''normale'' volume.  For a double shot, (14 grams of dry coffee), a ''normale'' uses about 60 ml of water.  A ''double ristretto,'' a common form associated with espresso, uses half the amount of water, about 30 ml.<ref name=\"ristretto\">{{cite web|url=https://coffee-brewing-methods.com/how-to-brew-espresso-perfect-shot/|title=How To Brew Espresso - Pulling the Perfect Shot |publisher=Coffee-Brewing-Methods.com}}</ref>\n\n''Ristretto, normale'', and ''lungo'' may not simply be the same shot, stopped at different times{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} \u2013 which may result in an underextracted shot (if run too short a time) or an overextracted shot (if run too long a time).{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Rather, the grind is adjusted (finer for ''ristretto'', coarser for ''lungo'') so the target volume is achieved by the time extraction finishes.<ref name=\"Basics of Making Espresso\">{{cite web|title=The Basics of Making Espresso \u2013 Tips and Techniques for Brewing |url=https://tastycoffeemaker.com/brewing-the-best-cup-of-espresso/|accessdate=28 February 2019 }}</ref>\n\nA significantly longer shot is the ''[[caff\u00e8 crema]]'', which is longer than a ''lungo'', ranging in size from 120\u2013240 ml (4\u20138 US fl oz), and brewed in the same way, with a coarser grind.\n\nThe method of adding hot water produces a milder version of original flavor, while passing more water through the load of ground coffee will add other flavors to the espresso, which might be unpleasant for some people.\n\n==Variations==\n\n=== Caff\u00e8 Freddo ===\n\nA ''Caff\u00e8 Freddo'' or ''Espresso Freddo'' espresso is the cold version of an espresso, mostly served in [[southern Europe]]. In Rome, coffee bars have the drink already prepared and chilled. \n\n=== Freddo Espresso ===\n\nIn [[Cyprus]], [[Greece]] and neighbouring countries, a cold espresso is a ''Freddo Espresso''. Despite its Italian name, the drink is prepared differently from its Italian counterpart.

For macchiatos, cappuccino, flat white, and smaller lattes and Americanos, the espresso is brewed into the cup, then the milk or water is poured in. For larger drinks, where a tall glass will not fit under the brew head, the espresso is brewed into a small cup, then poured into the larger cup; for this purpose a [[demitasse]] or specialized [[espresso brew pitcher]] may be used. This \"pouring into an existing glass\" is a defining characteristic of the latte macchiato and classic renditions of the red eye. Alternatively, a glass with \"existing\" water may have espresso brewed into it \u2013 to preserve the crema \u2013 in the long black. Brewing onto milk is not generally done.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Coffee|Drink}}\n* [[Arabic coffee]]\n* [[Cuban espresso]]\n* [[List of coffee drinks]]\n* [[List of hot beverages]]\n* [[Knockbox]]\n* [[Moka pot]]\n* [[Third wave of coffee]]\n* [[Barista]]\n* [[Bikini barista]]\n* {{portal-inline|Coffee}}\n\n==References==\n\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n;Sources\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Bersten |first=Ian |authorlink= |title=Coffee Floats Tea Sinks: Through History and Technology to a Complete Understanding |year=1993 |publisher=Helian Books |location= |isbn= 0-646-09180-8 |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Burchfield |first=R.

Espresso coffee can be made with a wide variety of coffee beans and roasts. Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, has a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and has ''crema'' on top (a foam with a creamy consistency).<ref>Illy, \"Il caff\u00e8 e i cinque sensi\" [http://www.illy.com/wps/wcm/connect/it/caffe/degustazione-caffe]: \"La tazzina di porcellana bianca incornicia la ''crema'': una trama sottile nei toni del nocciola, percorsa da leggere striature rossastre\"</ref> As a result of the pressurized brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of espresso are very concentrated. The three dispersed phases in espresso are what make this beverage unique. The first dispersed phase is an emulsion of oil droplets.  The second phase is suspended solids, while the third is the layer of gas bubbles or foam.  The dispersion of very small oil droplets is perceived in the mouth as creamy.  This characteristic of espresso contributes to what is known as the body of the beverage.  These oil droplets preserve some of the aromatic compounds that are lost to the air in other coffee forms.  This preserves the strong coffee flavor present in the espresso.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Illy |first1=Andrea |title=Espresso Coffee: The Science of Quality |date=2005 |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press}}</ref> Espresso is also the base for other types of coffee, including [[caff\u00e8 latte]], [[cappuccino]], [[caff\u00e8 macchiato]], [[caff\u00e8 mocha]], [[flat white]], or [[caff\u00e8 Americano]].\n\nEspresso has more [[caffeine]] per unit volume than most coffee beverages, but because the usual serving size is much smaller, the total caffeine content is less than a mug of standard brewed coffee, contrary to a common belief.<ref name=\"Mr. Coffee blog post\">{{cite web|title=The Great Debate: Does Espresso or Drip Coffee Have More Caffeine?|url=http://www.mrcoffee.com/blog/archive/2014/october/the-great-debate%3A-does-espresso-or-drip-coffee-have-more-caffeine%3F.html|publisher=[[Mr. Coffee]]|date=24 October 2014|accessdate=21 June 2015}}</ref> The actual caffeine content of any coffee drink varies by size, bean origin, roast method and other factors, but a typical serving of espresso usually contains 120 to 170 milligrams of caffeine, whereas a typical serving of drip coffee usually contains 150 to 200&nbsp;mg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/4291|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131124143904/http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/4291 |title=Show Foods|archivedate=24 November 2013|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/caffeine/AN01211 How much caffeine is in your daily habit? \u2013 MayoClinic.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/4290|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122090248/http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/4290 |title=Show Foods|archivedate=22 November 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Brewing==\n[[File:Espresso video.ogv|thumb|right|Video of how espresso is typically made in the U.S.]]\n[[Image:linea doubleespresso.jpg|thumb|Espresso brewing]]\n[[File:Fine espresso.png|thumb|right|Finely-ground coffee for espresso]]\n\nEspresso is made by forcing very hot water under high pressure through finely ground compacted coffee.

The act of producing a shot of espresso is often termed \"pulling\" a shot, originating from lever espresso machines, which require pulling down a handle attached to a spring-loaded piston, forcing hot water through the coffee at high pressure.

It is not a specific bean, bean blend, or [[Coffee roasting|roast level]]. Any bean or roasting level can be used to produce authentic espresso. For example, in southern Italy, a darker roast is generally preferred.  Farther north, the trend moves toward slightly lighter roasts, while outside Italy a wide range is popular.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Illy|first1=Francesco|last2=Illy|first2=Riccardo|title=The book of coffee : a gourmet's guide|date=1992|publisher=Abbeville Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1558593213|edition=1st American}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2011}}\n\n[[Image:Angelo-moriondo-portrait-espresso-machine-inventor.jpg|right|thumb|[[Angelo Moriondo]], inventor of an important precursor to the espresso coffee machine]]\n[[Image:Manual Elektra espresso machine.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A manual espresso machine]]\n[[Image:Modern espresso machine.jpg|right|thumb|A modern espresso machine]]\n\n[[Angelo Moriondo]], from [[Turin]], patented a [[Angelo Moriondo#First Espresso machine|steam-driven \"instantaneous\" coffee beverage making device]] in 1884 (No. 33/256). The device is \"almost certainly the first Italian bar machine that controlled the supply of steam and water separately through the coffee\" and Moriondo is \"certainly one of the earliest discoverers of the expresso {{sic}} machine, if not the earliest\".{{sfn|Bersten|1993|page=105}} Unlike true espresso machines, it brewed in bulk, not as individual servings. Seventeen years later, in 1901, Luigi Bezzera, from [[Milan]], devised and patented several improvements to the espresso machine, the first of which was applied for on 19 December 1901. Titled \"Innovations in the machinery to prepare and immediately serve coffee beverage\"; Patent No. 153/94, 61707, was granted on 5 June 1902. In 1903, the patent was bought by Desiderio Pavoni, who founded the La Pavoni company and began to produce the machine industrially, manufacturing one machine daily in a small workshop in Via Parini, [[Milan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-long-history-of-the-espresso-machine-126012814/|title=The Long History of the Espresso Machine|last=Stamp|first=Jimmy|website=Smithsonian|language=en|access-date=2019-04-04}}</ref>\n\nThe popularity of espresso developed in various ways; a detailed discussion of the spread of espresso is given in {{Harv|Morris|2007}}, which is a source of various statements below. In Italy, the rise of espresso consumption was associated with urbanization, [[espresso bar]]s providing a place for socializing. Further, coffee [[price controls|prices were controlled]] by local authorities, provided the coffee was consumed standing up, encouraging the \"stand at a bar\" culture.\n\nIn the English-speaking world, espresso became popular, particularly in the form of [[cappuccino]], owing to the tradition of drinking coffee with milk and the exotic appeal of the foam; in the United States, this was more often in the form of [[latte]]s, with or without flavored syrups added. The latte is claimed to have been invented in the 1950s by Italian American Lino Meiorin of [[Caffe Mediterraneum]] in [[Berkeley, California]], as a long cappuccino, and was then popularized in Seattle,<ref>{{cite web | website = Caffe Mediterraneum | title = Invention of the Caffe Latte | url = http://www.caffemed.com/about_us | accessdate = 19 April 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090614060123/http://www.caffemed.com/about_us | archive-date = 14 June 2009 | url-status = dead }}</ref> and then nationally and internationally by Seattle-based [[Starbucks]] in the late 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, espresso grew in popularity among youth in the 1950s, who felt more welcome in the coffee shops than in [[pub]]s. Espresso was initially popular, particularly within the Italian diaspora, growing in popularity with tourism to Italy exposing others to espresso, as developed by Eiscaf\u00e8s established by Italians in Germany. Initially, expatriate Italian espresso bars were seen as downmarket venues, serving the working-class Italian diaspora and thus providing appeal to the alternative subculture; this can still be seen in the United States in Italian American neighborhoods, such as [[North End, Boston|Boston's North End]], [[Little Italy, Manhattan|New York's Little Italy]], and [[North Beach, San Francisco|San Francisco's North Beach]]. As specialty coffee developed in the 1980s (following earlier developments in the 1970s and even 1960s), an indigenous artisanal coffee culture developed, with espresso instead positioned as an upmarket drink.\n\nIn the 2010s, [[coffee culture]] commentators distinguish large-chain mid-market coffee as \"Second Wave Coffee\", and upmarket artisanal coffee as \"[[Third wave of coffee|Third Wave Coffee]]\". In the Middle East and Asia, espresso is growing in popularity, with the opening of Western coffee-shop chains.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bbQrDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=espresso+became+popular+because+of+cappuccino&source=bl&ots=RrpyrJSKIE&sig=IwKrxvqfae1TCPzE7DtNqt8vtvs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjc09zXp8vYAhVH82MKHXZaBWIQ6AEIYTAJ#v=onepage&q=espresso%20became%20popular%20because%20of%20cappuccino&f=false|title=Coffee Culture|last=Hutchins|first=Timothy|date=3 July 2017|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781387074518|language=en}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Caf\u00e9 vs. home preparation===\n[[File:2018 0121 Quick Mill 0820 espresso machine.jpg|thumb|A Quickmill 820 home espresso machine]]\nHome espresso machines have increased in popularity with the general rise of interest in espresso. Today, a wide range of home espresso equipment can be found in kitchen and appliance stores, online vendors, and department stores. The first espresso machine for home use was the [[Gaggia]] Gilda.{{sfn|Bersten|1993|page=131}} Soon afterwards, similar machines such as the Faema Faemina, FE-AR La Peppina and VAM Caravel followed suit in similar form factor and operational principles.{{sfn|Bersten|1993|page=132-133}} These machines still have a small but dedicated share of fans. Until the advent of the first small electrical pump-based espresso machines such as the Gaggia Baby and Quickmill 810, home espresso machines were not widely adopted. In recent years, the increased availability of convenient counter-top fully automatic home espresso makers and pod-based espresso serving systems has increased the quantity of espresso consumed at home. The popularity of home espresso making parallels the increase of [[home roasting coffee|home coffee roasting]]. Some amateurs pursue both [[home roasting coffee]] and making espresso.\n\n{{see also|Espresso machine}}\n\n==Etymology and spelling==\n[[File:Italian-American cafe espresso shop on MacDougal Street 8d21752v.jpg|thumb|right|An Italian-American espresso shop.]]\nAlthough some Anglo-American dictionaries simply refer to \"pressed-out\",<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n | encyclopedia = Oxford English Dictionary\n | title = espresso\n | url = http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50078079/50078079spg1\n | accessdate = 30 October 2009\n | year = 1989\n | publisher = Oxford University press\n}}</ref> \"espresso\", much like the English word \"express\", conveys the senses of \"just for you\" and \"quickly\", which can be related to the method of espresso preparation.\n\n{{quote|The words ''express'', ''expres'' and ''espresso'' each have several meanings in English, French and Italian. The first meaning is to do with the idea of \"expressing\" or squeezing the flavour from the coffee using the pressure of the steam. The second meaning is to do with speed, as in a train. Finally there is the notion of doing something \"expressly\" for a person&nbsp;...

The Italian [[multiplier (linguistics)|multiplier]] term ''doppio'' is often used for a double, with ''solo'' and ''triplo'' being more rarely used for singles and triples. The single shot is the traditional shot size, being the maximum that could easily be pulled on a lever machine.\n\nSingle baskets are sharply tapered or stepped down in diameter to provide comparable depth to the double baskets and, therefore, comparable resistance to water pressure. Most double baskets are gently tapered (the \"Faema model\"), while others, such as the La Marzocco, have straight sides. Triple baskets are normally straight-sided.\n\nPortafilters will often come with two spouts, usually closely spaced, and a double-size basket \u2013 each spout can optionally dispense into a separate cup, yielding two solo-size (but doppio-brewed) shots, or into a single cup (hence the close spacing). True ''solo'' shots are rare, with a single shot in a caf\u00e9 generally being half of a ''doppio'' shot.\n\nIn espresso-based drinks in America, particularly larger milk-based drinks, a drink with three or four shots of espresso will be called a \"triple\" or \"quad\", respectively.\n\n=== Length ===\nThe length of the shot can be ''ristretto'' (or ''stretto'') (reduced), ''normale'' or standard (normal), or ''lungo'' (long):<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/07/travel/fare-of-the-country-in-italy-espresso-is-the-elixir-of-life.html|title=Fare of the Country: In Italy, Espresso is the Elixir of Life|last=Hofmann|first=Paul|date=7 August 1983|access-date=25 March 2018|language=en}}</ref> these may correspond to a smaller or larger drink with the same amount of ground coffee and same level of extraction or to different length of extraction. Proportions vary and the volume (and low density) of crema make volume-based comparisons difficult (precise measurement uses the mass of the drink). Typically ''ristretto'' is half the volume of ''normale'', and ''lungo'' is double to triple the ''normale'' volume.  For a double shot, (14 grams of dry coffee), a ''normale'' uses about 60 ml of water.  A ''double ristretto,'' a common form associated with espresso, uses half the amount of water, about 30 ml.<ref name=\"ristretto\">{{cite web|url=https://coffee-brewing-methods.com/how-to-brew-espresso-perfect-shot/|title=How To Brew Espresso - Pulling the Perfect Shot |publisher=Coffee-Brewing-Methods.com}}</ref>\n\n''Ristretto, normale'', and ''lungo'' may not simply be the same shot, stopped at different times{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} \u2013 which may result in an underextracted shot (if run too short a time) or an overextracted shot (if run too long a time).{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Rather, the grind is adjusted (finer for ''ristretto'', coarser for ''lungo'') so the target volume is achieved by the time extraction finishes.<ref name=\"Basics of Making Espresso\">{{cite web|title=The Basics of Making Espresso \u2013 Tips and Techniques for Brewing |url=https://tastycoffeemaker.com/brewing-the-best-cup-of-espresso/|accessdate=28 February 2019 }}</ref>\n\nA significantly longer shot is the ''[[caff\u00e8 crema]]'', which is longer than a ''lungo'', ranging in size from 120\u2013240 ml (4\u20138 US fl oz), and brewed in the same way, with a coarser grind.\n\nThe method of adding hot water produces a milder version of original flavor, while passing more water through the load of ground coffee will add other flavors to the espresso, which might be unpleasant for some people.\n\n==Variations==\n\n=== Caff\u00e8 Freddo ===\n\nA ''Caff\u00e8 Freddo'' or ''Espresso Freddo'' espresso is the cold version of an espresso, mostly served in [[southern Europe]]. In Rome, coffee bars have the drink already prepared and chilled. \n\n=== Freddo Espresso ===\n\nIn [[Cyprus]], [[Greece]] and neighbouring countries, a cold espresso is a ''Freddo Espresso''. Despite its Italian name, the drink is prepared differently from its Italian counterpart. Conceived in [[Greece]], along with [[Cappuccino Freddo|freddo cappuccino]] in the early 1990s, freddo espresso is in higher demand during summer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nespresso.com/gr/el/pages/freddo|title=Freddo Espresso & Freddo Cappuccino {{!}} Nespresso Hellas|website=www.nespresso.com|access-date=3 December 2016}}</ref> After 2 shots of espresso (usually ristretto) are prepared, the coffee is stirred in a big metal can along with sugar (if desired) and 2\u20133 ice cubes until the coffee is cold.

For macchiatos, cappuccino, flat white, and smaller lattes and Americanos, the espresso is brewed into the cup, then the milk or water is poured in. For larger drinks, where a tall glass will not fit under the brew head, the espresso is brewed into a small cup, then poured into the larger cup; for this purpose a [[demitasse]] or specialized [[espresso brew pitcher]] may be used. This \"pouring into an existing glass\" is a defining characteristic of the latte macchiato and classic renditions of the red eye. Alternatively, a glass with \"existing\" water may have espresso brewed into it \u2013 to preserve the crema \u2013 in the long black. Brewing onto milk is not generally done.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Coffee|Drink}}\n* [[Arabic coffee]]\n* [[Cuban espresso]]\n* [[List of coffee drinks]]\n* [[List of hot beverages]]\n* [[Knockbox]]\n* [[Moka pot]]\n* [[Third wave of coffee]]\n* [[Barista]]\n* [[Bikini barista]]\n* {{portal-inline|Coffee}}\n\n==References==\n\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n;Sources\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Bersten |first=Ian |authorlink= |title=Coffee Floats Tea Sinks: Through History and Technology to a Complete Understanding |year=1993 |publisher=Helian Books |location= |isbn= 0-646-09180-8 |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book |last=Burchfield |first=R.

His parents ended up working and living in [[Catalonia]], Spain, where Parris later bought a house.\n\n==Education==\nParris was educated at [[Waterford Kamhlaba|Waterford Kamhlaba United World College of Southern Africa]], an [[independent school]] just outside [[Mbabane]] in Swaziland, and [[Clare College, Cambridge]], where he gained a [[first class degree]] in law and was a member of the [[Cambridge University Liberal Club|Liberal Club]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/matthew_parris/article6987062.ece | location=London | work=The Times | title=Invicta what a terrible choice of poem | first=Matthew | last=Parris | date=14 January 2010}}</ref> He won a [[Paul Mellon]] scholarship and studied [[international relations]] at [[Yale University]].\n\nHe has said that an early reading of ''[[Animal Farm]]'' made him a Conservative, as \"An admiration for [the pigs'] intelligence and sense of order dawned in me.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/hearingisbelieving/article4242110.ece|title=Matthew Parris: Animal Farm by George Orwell (1945)|first=Matthew|last=Parris|newspaper=The Times}}</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nAt the age of 19, Parris drove across Africa to Europe in a [[Morris Oxford]]; the trip was traumatically punctuated when he and his female companion were attacked, and he was forced to witness her rape.<ref>''Chance Witness'', pp. 94\u201395</ref>\n\nParris was offered a job as an [[MI6]] officer,<ref>''Chance Witness'', p.134</ref> but instead worked for the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] for two years.

In 1991, a compilation of his pieces in ''[[The Times]]'' appeared, entitled ''So Far, So Good''. Since then there have been further compilations. ''Scorn'', a book he has edited of quotations about curses, jibes and general invective, was published in October 1994. He has achieved continuing success as a parliamentary reporter and columnist through his knowledge and understanding of politicians and ability to write well about them. He worked as [[parliamentary sketch writing|parliamentary sketch writer]] for ''The Times'' newspaper from 1988 to 2001 and has had weekly columns in ''The Times'' and ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine. In 2004, Parris became Writer of the Year in [[Granada Television]]'s ''[[What the Papers Say]]'' Awards. In part, this was for reporting on elections in Iraq and Afghanistan. His previous accolades include Columnist of the Year in the 1991 and 1993 [[British Press Awards]], and in the ''What the Papers Say'' Awards 1992. In 1990 he received the [[London Press Club]]'s [[Edgar Wallace]] Outstanding Reporter of the Year Award. In 2005, Parris published ''A Castle in Spain'' about his family's project to refurbish a derelict sixteenth-century mansion, L'Avenc, in [[Catalonia]], close to the foothills of the [[Pyrenees]], and make his home there.\n\nIn 2011, ''[[Total Politics]]'' said that Parris's column \"is considered essential reading by many in [[Westminster]].

Francis Parris''' (born 7 August 1949) is a British political writer  and broadcaster, formerly a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament]]. He was born in South Africa to British parents.\n\n==Early life and family==\nParris is the eldest of six children (three brothers and two sisters) and grew up in several British territories and former territories: South Africa, Cyprus, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Swaziland (now Eswatini) and Jamaica, where his father was working as an electrical engineer. His parents ended up working and living in [[Catalonia]], Spain, where Parris later bought a house.\n\n==Education==\nParris was educated at [[Waterford Kamhlaba|Waterford Kamhlaba United World College of Southern Africa]], an [[independent school]] just outside [[Mbabane]] in Swaziland, and [[Clare College, Cambridge]], where he gained a [[first class degree]] in law and was a member of the [[Cambridge University Liberal Club|Liberal Club]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/matthew_parris/article6987062.ece | location=London | work=The Times | title=Invicta what a terrible choice of poem | first=Matthew | last=Parris | date=14 January 2010}}</ref> He won a [[Paul Mellon]] scholarship and studied [[international relations]] at [[Yale University]].\n\nHe has said that an early reading of ''[[Animal Farm]]'' made him a Conservative, as \"An admiration for [the pigs'] intelligence and sense of order dawned in me.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/hearingisbelieving/article4242110.ece|title=Matthew Parris: Animal Farm by George Orwell (1945)|first=Matthew|last=Parris|newspaper=The Times}}</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nAt the age of 19, Parris drove across Africa to Europe in a [[Morris Oxford]]; the trip was traumatically punctuated when he and his female companion were attacked, and he was forced to witness her rape.<ref>''Chance Witness'', pp. 94\u201395</ref>\n\nParris was offered a job as an [[MI6]] officer,<ref>''Chance Witness'', p.134</ref> but instead worked for the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] for two years. In 1976 he left this secure career because he did not like its formality, and because he wanted to become a [[Member of Parliament]]. He eventually joined the [[Conservative Research Department]] and moved on to become correspondence secretary to [[Margaret Thatcher]]. He was awarded an [[RSPCA]] medal (presented by Mrs Thatcher, then [[Leader of the Opposition]]), for jumping into the [[Thames]] and rescuing a dog.<ref>''Chance Witness'', p.197</ref>\n\n==Parliamentary career==\nParris was the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP for the [[parliamentary constituency]] of [[Derbyshire West (UK Parliament constituency)|West Derbyshire]] from 1979 to 1986. Competing prospective candidates for the seat included [[Peter Lilley]] and [[Michael Howard]]. He voiced support for [[gay rights]].

The series, broadcast since 1977 with Walden at its helm, ran for two more years under Parris before being cancelled in 1988.\n\nHe presents [[BBC Radio 4]]'s ''[[Great Lives]]'' biography series, and has appeared on the comedy news programme ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'' and presented ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.openmedia.co.uk/afterdark.htm|title=After Dark: with presenters including Tony Wilson and Anthony Clare|website=Openmedia.co.uk}}</ref> In 2007, Parris presented two light-hearted but caustic documentaries for Radio 4 on politicians' use of clich\u00e9 and jargon, entitled ''Not My Words, Mr Speaker''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qgvj |title=BBC Radio 4 \u2013 Not My Words, Mr Speaker|publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=19 September 2007 |accessdate=15 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 8 July 2011, on Radio 4's ''[[Any Questions]]'', at the height of the furore surrounding the alleged illegal and corrupt activities of ''[[News of the World]]'' journalists, Parris eulogised the newspaper and gave an enthusiastic appreciation of what he considered the virtues and positive achievements of [[Rupert Murdoch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qgvj |title=BBC Radio 4 \u2013 Any Questions? |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2017 Parris appeared, in a cameo role, in the Anniversary edition of BBC's ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09kcxdt|title=Royston Vasey Mon Amour, Anniversary Specials, The League of Gentlemen - BBC Two|website=BBC}}</ref>\n\n==Writing and journalism==\n\nParris is a prolific writer and has written many books on politics and travel. In 1991, a compilation of his pieces in ''[[The Times]]'' appeared, entitled ''So Far, So Good''. Since then there have been further compilations. ''Scorn'', a book he has edited of quotations about curses, jibes and general invective, was published in October 1994. He has achieved continuing success as a parliamentary reporter and columnist through his knowledge and understanding of politicians and ability to write well about them. He worked as [[parliamentary sketch writing|parliamentary sketch writer]] for ''The Times'' newspaper from 1988 to 2001 and has had weekly columns in ''The Times'' and ''[[The Spectator]]'' magazine. In 2004, Parris became Writer of the Year in [[Granada Television]]'s ''[[What the Papers Say]]'' Awards. In part, this was for reporting on elections in Iraq and Afghanistan. His previous accolades include Columnist of the Year in the 1991 and 1993 [[British Press Awards]], and in the ''What the Papers Say'' Awards 1992. In 1990 he received the [[London Press Club]]'s [[Edgar Wallace]] Outstanding Reporter of the Year Award. In 2005, Parris published ''A Castle in Spain'' about his family's project to refurbish a derelict sixteenth-century mansion, L'Avenc, in [[Catalonia]], close to the foothills of the [[Pyrenees]], and make his home there.\n\nIn 2011, ''[[Total Politics]]'' said that Parris's column \"is considered essential reading by many in [[Westminster]]. He has a penchant for holding opinions that go against the grain. Parris has written scathingly about the [[localism (politics)|localism]] agenda, and was a long-time defender of the [[yah-boo politics]] of [[PMQs]], although he recently changed his mind.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.totalpolitics.com/articles/277577/top-100-political-journalists-2011.thtml |title=Top 100 political journalists 2011 |publisher=Total Politics |accessdate=25 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301171422/http://www.totalpolitics.com/articles/277577/top-100-political-journalists-2011.thtml |archivedate=1 March 2014 }}</ref>\n\nParris's writing has often attracted wider comment.

In the early 1900s, electric and gas appliances included [[washing machine]]s, [[water heater]]s, [[refrigerator]]s, [[kettle]]s and [[sewing machine]]s. The invention of Earl Richardson's small electric [[clothes iron]] in 1903 gave a small initial boost to the home appliance industry.<!--For this sentence only   <ref name=\"George2003\"/>  .

Brown goods typically require high technical knowledge and skills (which get more complex with time, such as going from a [[soldering iron]] to a hot-air soldering station), while white goods may need more practical skills and force to manipulate the devices and heavy tools required to repair them.\n\n==Definition==\nGiven a broad usage, the domestic application attached to home appliance is tied to the definition of [[Appliance (disambiguation)|appliance]] as \"an instrument or device designed for a particular use or function\".<ref>{{cite dictionary | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/appliance | title=Appliance | dictionary=Merriam Webster | accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref> More specifically, [[Collins English Dictionary]] defines \"home appliance\" as: \"devices or machines, usually electrical, that are in your home and which you use to do jobs such as cleaning or cooking\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/household-appliances | title=Definition of household appliances | publisher=Collins Dictionary | accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref> The broad usage, afforded to the definition allows for nearly any device intended for domestic use to be a home appliance, including [[consumer electronics]] as well as [[stove]]s,<ref name=\"Bulletin 2014\"/> [[refrigerator]]s, [[toaster]]s<ref name=\"Bulletin 2014\"/> and [[air conditioner]]s.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Toaster, Universal, Model E947, c. 1915, Landers, Frary and Clark, New Britain, Connecticut, Wolfsonian-FIU Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Early 20th century electric [[toaster]]]]\n<!-- The reference structure of this section seems to be \"refs at the end of each paragraph\". Feel free to reference however you like, though-->\nWhile many appliances have existed for centuries, the self-contained electric or gas powered appliances are a uniquely American innovation that emerged in the twentieth century. The development of these appliances is tied to the disappearance of full-time [[domestic servant]]s and the desire to reduce the time-consuming activities in pursuit of more recreational time. In the early 1900s, electric and gas appliances included [[washing machine]]s, [[water heater]]s, [[refrigerator]]s, [[kettle]]s and [[sewing machine]]s. The invention of Earl Richardson's small electric [[clothes iron]] in 1903 gave a small initial boost to the home appliance industry.<!--For this sentence only   <ref name=\"George2003\"/>  .

Also, linking to [[Earl Richardson]] will give the wrong person --> In the [[Post\u2013World War II economic expansion]], the domestic use of [[dishwasher]]s, and [[clothes dryer]]s were part of a shift for convenience.

It was published by [[JoWooD Productions]] and developed by Similis. The game takes place in the year 2173. It features flying cars in the city of New York.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe highways of [[New York City]] are teeming with illegal rush-hour grave-racers. Bad racers end up scraped off the side of skyscrapers while good ones build reputations that some would literally kill for. This is no pedestrian street race scene.

Finally, it is suggested that the law-of-the-father, as apartheid bequest, organises and animates identity struggles for this generation.}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Viljoen|first=Martina|title=Johannes Kerkorrel en postapartheid-Afrikaneridentiteit|date=1 November 2005|language=Afrikaans|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Johannes+Kerkorrel+en+postapartheid-Afrikaneridentiteit.-a0155039300|accessdate=21 April 2013|journal=Literator|issn=0258-2279|publisher=Literator Society of South Africa|trans-title=Johannes Kerkorrel and post Apartheid Afrikaaner Identity}}\n*{{cite book|last=Hopkins|first=Pat|title=Vo\u00eblvry the movement that rocked South Africa|year=2006|publisher=Zebra Press|location=Cape Town|isbn=9781770071209|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8lr1FloqLZsC}}\n*{{cite thesis |type=MA |first=Hendrick Michael Grobler |last=Uys |title=A psycho-biographical study of Ralph John Rabie |publisher=NMMU |year=2011|hdl=10948/1366}}\n*{{cite web|title=Johannes Kerkorrel|url=http://www.roekeloos.co.za/argief/kerkorrel.html|publisher=roekeloos.co.za|accessdate=21 April 2013|language=Afrikaans}} \n*{{cite web|title=Music Artists: Johannes Kerkorrel |url=http://entertainmentafrica.mobi/music/view/artist/308 |publisher=Entertainmentafrica Mobile |accessdate=21 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029213207/http://entertainmentafrica.mobi/music/view/artist/308 |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}\n*{{cite web|title=Vo\u00eblvry|url=http://www.shifty.co.za/shif4.html|publisher=Shifty|accessdate=22 April 2013|quote=Ralph Rabie, who was at that time a journalist on an Afrikaans paper, went down to Cape Town to interview Andr\u00e9 when V\u00ear van die ou Kalahari was released. There was a meeting of minds which eventually led to both of them playing in the first incarnation of the Gereformeerde Blues Band. A short while later, Andr\u00e9 left to forge a solo career as Koos Kombuis, while Ralph, by then known as Johannes Kerkorrel, went on to record the seminal Eet Kreef album with the remaining members of the GBB.

This time the insurrection was a musical one, with the GBB as rock & roll outlaws slinging guitars and stinging criticism against the laager mentality of volks kultuur and the apartheid way of life. Moving conventional rock into the realm of political theatre and satire as successfully as they did proved that if the GBB were to be seen as cultural upstarts, they were upstarts with a vision both innovative and lucid that could not be ignored.}}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kerkorrel, Johannes}}\n[[Category:1960 births]]\n[[Category:2002 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:20th-century male writers]]\n[[Category:20th-century South African singers]]\n[[Category:Afrikaans-language singers]]\n[[Category:Gay musicians]]\n[[Category:Gay writers]]\n[[Category:LGBT dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:LGBT musicians from South Africa]]\n[[Category:LGBT singers]]\n[[Category:LGBT songwriters]]\n[[Category:LGBT writers from South Africa]]\n[[Category:Male dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:Male suicides]]\n[[Category:Singers who committed suicide]]\n[[Category:South African dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:South African journalists]]\n[[Category:South African musicians]]\n[[Category:South African singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Suicides by hanging in South Africa]]\n", "name_user": "Bearcat", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFurther reading:recat", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kerkorrel"}
