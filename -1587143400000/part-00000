Built in 1851 in the [[Scottish Baronial]] style by William Mitchell-Innes, then [[List of Scottish feudal baronies|feudal baron of Ayton]], to the design of [[James Gillespie Graham]]]]\n\nIn [[Scotland]], a '''baron''' is the head of a [[feudal baron]]y, also known as a prescriptive barony. This used to be attached to a particular piece of land on which was situated the ''[[caput]]'' ([[Latin]] for \"head\") or essence of the barony, normally a building, such as a castle or manor house. Accordingly, the owner of the piece of land containing the ''caput'' was called a [[baron]] (or baroness).\n\nThe [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] issued a ruling in April 2015 that recognises a person possessing the dignity of baron and other feudal titles (lordship/earl/marquis). The [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] now prefers the approach of recognizing the particular feudal noble dignity as expressed in the Crown Charter that the petitioner presents.<ref name=\"lyon-court.com\">http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/files/Menking%20Decision.pdf</ref> These titles are recognised as the status of a minor baron but not a peer. Scottish feudal baronies may be passed to any person, of either sex, by inheritance or conveyance.<ref>{{cite book |first=Professor Kenneth |last=Reid |year=2003 |title=The Abolition of Feudal Tenure in Scotland |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Tottel}}</ref>\n\nScotland has a [[Scots Law|distinct legal system]] within the [[United Kingdom]]. Historically, in the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], the Lord Lyon King of Arms, as the Sovereign's minister in matters armorial, is at once [[herald]] and [[judge]]. The Scottish equivalent of an English baron is a [[Lord of Parliament]].\n\n==History==\nA \"Scottish Prescriptive Barony by [[Land tenure|Tenure]]\" was, from [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660|1660]] until 2004, the [[Feudalism|feudal]] description of the only genuine degree of title of [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[nobility]] capable of being bought and sold (along with the ''caput'', or property), rather than passing strictly by blood inheritance.\n\nStatutes of 1592 and the ''Baronetcy Warrants'' of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] show the non-peerage Table of Precedence as: [[Baronet]]s, [[Knight]]s, [[Baron]]s and [[Laird (title)|Lairds]], [[Esquire]] and [[Gentlemen]].\n\nA ''[[Sasine|General Register of Sasines]]'' was set up by Statute in 1617, with entry in the Register giving the ''prescriptive'' right (right by normal or correct usage), after so many years, to the ''caput'' or essence of the barony. The individual who owned the said piece of land containing the ''caput'' was hence the baron or baroness. Uncertainty over armorial right was removed by the ''Lyon Register'' being set up by Statute in 1672, such that no arms were to be borne in Scotland unless validly entered in Lyon Register.\n\nUp until 1874, each new baron was confirmed in his barony by the Crown by Charter of Confirmation. Up until 28 November 2004, a barony was an [[estate (land)|estate]] of land held directly of [[the Crown]], or the [[Prince and Great Steward of Scotland]]. It was an essential element of a barony title that there existed a Crown [[Charter]] erecting the land into a barony, recorded in the Register of the [[Great Seal of Scotland]]. Often the original Charter was later lost, however an Official Extract has the same [[legal status]] as the original Charter.\n\nFrom the [[Treaty of Union]] of 1707 - until 1999 - a unified [[Parliament of Great Britain]] (since January, 1801, known as the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]), at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]], was responsible for passing legislation affecting [[private law]] both north and south of the [[Scotland|Scottish]] border. In 1999, the devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] was established, and private law measures can now be passed at [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]], the seat of the Scottish Parliament in [[Edinburgh]].\n\nUsing a \"prescriptive feudal grant\" allowed developers to impose [[Eternity|perpetual]] conditions affecting the land. The courts became willing to accept the validity of such obligations, which became known as \"real burdens\". In practical and commercial terms, these real burdens were like English [[leasehold]] tenure.\n\n==Abolition of feudal tenure==\nThe first [[Scottish Executive]] was committed to abolishing the [[anachronism]] of the [[Feudalism|feudal system]]. On 28 November 2004, the ''[[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]]'' came into full force and effect, putting an end to Scotland's feudal system. Under [[Scots law]], a Scottish Prescriptive Barony by Tenure is now \"incorporeal feudal heritage\", not attached to the land and remains the only genuine, ''prescriptive'', degree of title of UK nobility capable of being bought and sold \u2013 since under Section 63(1) of the Act, the dignity of baron is preserved after the abolition of the feudal system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/63 |title=Section 63 |work=Abolition of Feudal Tenure, etc (Scotland) Act 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/deleted/library/documents-w10/afs2-12.htm |work=Report on Abolition of Feudal System |title=Appendix A12: ''See Explanatory Notes on Clause 57 Subsection (2)'' |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041119234609/http://www.scotland.gov.uk/deleted/library/documents-w10/afs2-12.htm |archivedate=19 November 2004 }}</ref> However, the Abolition Act did end the ability to get feudal land privileges by inheriting or acquiring the ''caput'' (land or castle) in Scotland.  In [[common law]] jurisdictions, land may still be owned and inherited through a barony if the land is titled in \"the Baron of X\" as baron rather than in the individual's name.  In America, it passes with the barony as a [[fee simple]] appurtenance to an otherwise [[incorporeal hereditament]], the barony being treated like a landowning [[corporation]].<ref>{{cite court  |litigants=Re Notarial Instrument of the Earl of Galloway; Disposition; Warrant for Letters Patent |reporter=No.s 103, 104, 105, ''Palmyra Island Land Recordation'', United States District Court for the District of Hawaii |date=2017 |court=D.C. Hawaii-Palmyra I.}}</ref> In Scotland, the practice has not been tested in a [[Court of Session]] case since the Act.\n\nWhat is possibly the oldest barony in Scotland, the [[Clan MacLea|Barony of the Bachuil]], has not depended on land ownership for centuries; the barony passes along with the possession of a certain ancient stick, \"The Bachuil M\u00f3r\", which was once the bishop's staff of the [[Picts|Pictish]] [[Moluag|Saint Moluag]] in the year 562.  Unlike all other barons in Scotland, the lawful possessor of the stick is the Baron of the Bachuil, regardless of landholdings.<ref name=\"bachuil\">{{cite book |title=The MacLeas or Livingstones and their Allodial Barony of the Bachuil |first=Niall |last=Livingston of the Bachuil, yr. |publisher= Baronage Press |date=2006 |url=http://baronage.co.uk/2006a/Bachuil.pdf |access-date= 2018-05-21}}</ref>\n\nAfter 28 November 2004 under Scots law, a Scottish barony, which was previously Scottish heritable property (real property), became incorporeal heritable property (not attached to the land). Prior to the Act coming into effect, Scottish feudal baronies (including lordships and earldoms) were the only genuine title of UK nobility capable of being transferred following the sale of land containing a ''caput'' (or the sale of a feudal superiority).\n\nMost baronies were created (erected) prior to 1745, but one was erected as late as 1824. Since the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 came into effect, the [[Lord Lyon]], who is the Chief Herald of Scotland, has restored a more traditional form to the [[coat of arms]] of a baron. Barons are now identified by the helm befitting their degree. A new policy statement has been made by the Lord Lyon to this effect.\n\nIndependent Scots legal advice should always be taken before entering into any contract that claims to offer a baronial title for sale. The holder of the dignity of a barony may petition the Lord Lyon for a [[Grant of Arms|grant of arms]], as he falls under the jurisdiction of the [[Court of the Lord Lyon|Lyon's Court]]. A policy statement has been made to this effect by the Lord Lyon.<ref name=\"lyon-court.com\"/> The Lyon Court has no jurisdiction in relation to the transfer of, or legal \"trade\" in, feudal titles. Any prospective purchaser should seek specialist independent Scots [[Scots law|legal]] [[legal advice|advice]].\n\n==Usage==\nAn English barony is a [[peerage]] (yet the abolition act of 1660 allows for some remaining non-peer baronies not converted by writ to remain as feudal baronies of free socage \"incorporeal hereditament\" similar to a lordship of the manor), but whether Scottish barons rightfully rank as peers is disputable.<ref>{{cite web |author=Graham Senior-Milne, 41st Baron of Mordington  |date=27 June 2005  |url=http://www.peerage.org/genealogy/Baronies.htm |title=Scottish feudal baronies (feudal barons, feudal baron) including the oath of a knight}}</ref> They are known as minor barons currently treated as noble titles of less than peerage rank.  The Scottish equivalent of an English baron is \"[[List of Barons|Lord of Parliament]]\".\n\nThe feudal baronial title tends to be used when a landed family is not in possession of any United Kingdom peerage title of higher rank, subsequently granted, or has been created a knight of the [[realm]].  The name recorded by the [[Lord Lyon]] as part of any grant of arms or matriculation becomes the holder's name for all official purposes.\n\nThe holder of a Scottish barony (''e.g.'', \"Inverglen\") may add the title to his existing name (''e.g.'', \"John Smith, Baron of Inverglen\") or add the territorial designation to his surname if still in possession of the caput (\"John Smith of Inverglen, Baron of Inverglen\"); some of the oldest Scottish families prefer to be styled by the [[territorial designation]] alone (\"Smith of Inverglen\").<ref name=\"scotsbarons1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsbarons.org/titles_and_usages.htm |title=Titles and Usages |publisher=Scotsbarons.org |accessdate=17 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225165126/http://www.scotsbarons.org/titles_and_usages.htm |archivedate=25 February 2015  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-of-address/titles/scottish--and-irish-titles/scottish-feudal-baronies.aspx |title=Scottish Feudal Baronies, Scottish and Irish Titles, Titles, Forms Of Address &#124; Debrett's |publisher=Debretts.com |accessdate=17 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725234418/http://www.debretts.com/forms-of-address/titles/scottish--and-irish-titles/scottish-feudal-baronies.aspx |archivedate=25 July 2013  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peerage.org/genealogy/Baronies.htm#Forms_of_address |title=Scottish feudal baronies (feudal barons, feudal baron) including the oath of a knight |publisher=Peerage.org |accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> Formal and in writing, they are styled as [[The Much Honoured]] Baron of Inverglen.

If accepted (and if the applicant wishes to include the title), the correct form is for the applicant to include the territorial designation as part of their surname (Surname of territorial designation e.g. ''Smith of Inverglen''). The Observation would then show the holder's full name, followed by their feudal title e.g. ''The holder is John Smith, Baron of Inverglen''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/118548/titles-included-in-passports.pdf |title=Titles included in passports |page=3 |publisher=UK government website}}</ref>\n\n==Scottish heraldry==\n[[File:ScotsBaronsHelm.JPG|thumb|A Scottish baron's [[Barons in Scotland#Helmet|helmet]]]]\nThe former Lord Lyon declined to award the following baronial additaments to the arms of those feudal barons registering arms now that the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 is in force.  However, the current Lord Lyon has confirmed in a recent policy statement that he will officially recognise feudal barons or those possessing the dignity of baron who meet certain conditions and will grant them arms with a helmet befitting their degree. Scottish Barons rank below Lords of Parliament; while noble, they are not conventionally considered peerage titles. Unlike others, the titles can be hereditary or bought and sold.\n\nIn showing that Scottish barons are titles of nobility, reference may be made, amongst others, to Lyon Court in the Petition of Maclean of Ardgour for a Birthbrieve by Interlocutor dated 26 February 1943 which \"Finds and Declares that the Minor Barons of Scotland are, and have both in this Nobiliary Court, and in the Court of Session, been recognised as 'titled' nobility, and that the estait of the Baronage (The Barones Minores) is of the ancient Feudal Nobility of Scotland\".\n\nSir Thomas Innes of Learney in his 'Scots Heraldry' (2nd Ed., p.&nbsp;88, note 1) states that 'The Act 1672, cap 47, specially qualifies the degrees thus: Nobles (i.e. peers, the term being here used in a restricted seventeenth-century English sense), Barons (i.e. Lairds of baronial fiefs and their \"heirs\", who, even if fiefless, are equivalent to heads of Continental baronial houses) and Gentlemen (apparently all other armigers).' Baronets and knights are evidently classed as 'Gentlemen' here and are of a lower degree than Barons. The Scottish Head of Baronial Houses, includes all the various styles and titles which designate the territorial nobility i.e. baron of X.\n\nBarons may also wear two eagle feathers when in traditional dress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartansauthority.com/highland-dress/modern/how-to-wear-the-kilt/some-advice/ |title=How to wear the kilt &#124; Scottish Tartans Authority |publisher=Tartansauthority.com |accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsbarons.org/hereditary_offices.htm |title=Hereditary offices |publisher=Scotsbarons.org |accessdate=17 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226024221/http://www.scotsbarons.org/hereditary_offices.htm |archivedate=26 February 2015}}</ref> If the baron is a member of a clan, it is advisable to consult the clan chief on clan customs and traditions. The Lord Lyon only gives guidance and not governance on the wearing of feathers and recommends consulting with a clan chief.\n\n===Chapeau===\n[[File:Azure Chapeau.PNG|thumb|An azure [[chapeau]]]]\nPreviously, between the 1930s and 2004, when new arms were granted or a matriculation of existing arms took note of a barony, the owner was given a ''[[chapeau]]'' or [[cap of maintenance]] as part of his [[Coat of arms|armorial achievement]] on petitioning for the same. This chapeau is described as \"gules doubled ermine\" for barons in possession of the caput of the barony. An azure chapeau is appropriate for the heirs of ancient baronial families who are no longer owners of the estates. This chapeau was a relatively recent armorial invention of the late [[Lord Lyon]] [[Thomas Innes of Learney]].  Accordingly, a number of ancient arms of feudal barons do not display the chapeau, and now it is no longer granted.\n\nAt the [[Treaty of Perth]] in 1266, Norway relinquished its claim to the Hebrides and Man, and they became part of Scotland. In 1292, Argyll was created a shire and \"The Barons of all [[Argyll]] and the [[Lord of the Isles|Foreigners' Isles]]\", which had preceded the kingdom of Scotland, became eligible to attend the \"Scots\" Parliament&nbsp;\u2013 appearing in the record of the parliament at [[St Andrews|St. Andrews]] in 1309. Historically they have a chapeau, \"gules doubled ermines\", [[Ermine (heraldry)#Later variations|ermines]] being white tails on black.\n\nThere is a unique exception: the [[Bachuil|Barony of the Bachuil]] is not of feudal origin like other baronies but is [[Allodial title|allodial]] in that it predates (562 A.D.) Scotland itself and the feudal system, dating from the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] Kingdom of [[D\u00e1l Riata]]. In recognition as allodial ''Barons par la gr\u00e2ce de Dieu'' not barons by a [[feudal]] crown grant, the Baron of the Bachuil has the only chapeau allowed to have a [[vair]] ([[squirrel]] fur) lining.<ref name=\"bachuil\"/>\n\nA chapeau, if part of an armorial achievement, is placed into the space directly above the shield and below the helmet. It may otherwise be used on a [[visiting card]], the flap of an envelope, or to ensign the circlet of a crest badge as used on a bonnet.\n\n===Feudo-baronial mantle===\n[[File:Barony Robe and Chapeau.PNG|thumb|The historical Scottish baron's mantle and chapeau from the 1930s to 2004, which are no longer granted]]\nParticularly Scottish in character is the ''feudo-baronial mantle'' or robe of estate - described as gules doubled silk argent, fur-edged of miniver and collared in ermine, fastened on the right shoulder by five spherical buttons Or. This may be displayed in a [[Mantle and pavilion (heraldry)|pavilioned form]], draped behind the complete achievement of arms - or the armorial shield alone - tied open with cords and tassels, and surmounted by the chapeau. Again, Lord Lyon is no longer granting these heraldic mantles.\n\n===Helmet===\nThe ''helmet'' is now the chief mode of recognition of a Scottish baron.  The Lord Lyon has adopted a steel helm with grille of three grilles, garnished in gold, as the current baronial additament.  Alternatively, a feudal steel tilting helm garnished in gold, that may be shown affront\u00e9, may appear, or a helmet of some other degree if the baron holds a higher rank, such as a lordship of parliament.\n\n===Supporters===\n''[[Supporters]]'', are now usually reserved for the holders of the older baronies (chartered before 1587) and those that have been in continuous [[Family business|family ownership]]. In England, supporters are reserved for the peerage, and a Scottish baron who approaches the English [[College of Arms]] is not allowed supporters. A ''compartment'' has occasionally been granted to barons, representing their territories, even in cases where there are no supporters.\n\n===Badge===\nA ''badge'' \u2013 distinct from the ''crest'' \u2013 as a separate armorial device, is not necessarily a feature of the arms. The badge may be used by the \"tail\" or following of a landowner baron. The grant is linked to the baron's ''standard'', a heraldic flag, in the [[livery]] colours that carries a large representation of the badge. The standard is blazoned in the grant or matriculation. The livery colours are usually the two most prominent colours of the arms themselves.\n\n===Flags===\nA ''Standard'' \u2013 an elongated shape, tapering from 1.2 m down to 60&nbsp;cm, with the fly edge split and rounded (lanceolate). The length is according to rank, from 7.5 m for the Sovereign down to 3.5 m for a Knight, '''Baron''' or Chief. It bears the Arms as on the shield or the saltire in the hoist, with the tail parted per fess with the Crest, Badge and/or Supporter, plus the motto on one or more Ribands. The Standard is set before the '''Baron/Chief's''' tent (as it's a \"Headquarters\" flag and does not indicate that the Armiger is in residence) rather than carried like the banner. A Standard requires a separate grant by the Lord Lyon and is only made under certain conditions.\n\nA ''Guidon'' \u2013 one-third shorter than a Standard and tapering to a round, unsplit end at the fly. These are assigned by Lord Lyon to individuals who have Supporters to their Arms, and to others who have a following \u2013 those in a position of leadership or some official position.\n\nA ''Pennon'' \u2013 a smaller, elongated flag 4&nbsp;ft long with a pointed, rounded or swallow-tailed end, designed to be displayed on a lance, assigned by Lord Lyon King to an Armiger who applies for one. It is charged with the motto of the armiger as well as the arms as on the shield.\n\nA ''Banner'' \u2013 a square or rectangular upright representation of the Arms designed for carrying in warfare or tournaments, but now flown as a \"house flag\" when the Armiger is in residence and is NOT the flag of the Clan or Family.  Originally, conspicuous gallantry in battle was marked by cutting off the tail of the Standard or Pennon, turning it into a Banner. Strictly speaking, the sizes and shapes are:\n \n''Square banner'' \u2013 Sovereign, 1.5 m square; Dukes; 1.25 m sq; Earls, 1.1 m sq; Viscounts and Barons, 1 m sq; Baronets and '''feudal barons''', 0.9 m sq; other Armigers, 70&nbsp;cm wide x 85&nbsp;cm high\n \n''Rectangular banner'' \u2013 typically in the ratio 3:2, or 5:4 when flown as the \"house flag\" of an Armiger.\n \n''Carrying flag'' \u2013 this should be sized as follows (width x height): Peers, 1.2 m x 1.5 m; '''Feudal Barons''', 90&nbsp;cm x 115&nbsp;cm; Chiefs, 85&nbsp;cm x 110&nbsp;cm; Chieftains, 80&nbsp;cm x 90&nbsp;cm.\n\nA ''Ensign'' may be occasionally granted and blazoned. This is a square flag, smaller than the flying banner, and carrying the full embroidered achievement (arms, crest, motto), again fringed in livery colours.\n\nA ''Pipe banner'' \u2013 rather similar to a Banner, but of a size to fit on the longest drone of the pipes (usually 45&nbsp;cm) and richly decorated with gold fringing, tassles and the like. The pipe banner for a Chief who is also a Peer or a '''Feudal Baron''' should have a rounded end extending beyond the length, and any other Chief a split rounded end. A feudal baron is authorised two pipers.\n\n==List of Feudal Baronies (created before 1707)==\nBelow is a list of some Scottish feudal baronies created before 1707; this list does not include Scottish feudal baronies created between that year and 1838 (BGH), when the most recent creation of a Scottish feudal barony occurred.\n\n{{Expand list|date=January 2011}}\n:''When updating this list, please create for each new entry a separate, [[WP:Wikify|wikified]] article titled \"Scottish feudal barony of X\", which records a brief biography of the previous incumbent and is wikilinked to this list.  Please do not simply delete the name of the previous incumbent.

Built in 1851 in the [[Scottish Baronial]] style by William Mitchell-Innes, then [[List of Scottish feudal baronies|feudal baron of Ayton]], to the design of [[James Gillespie Graham]]]]\n\nIn [[Scotland]], a '''baron''' is the head of a [[feudal baron]]y, also known as a prescriptive barony. This used to be attached to a particular piece of land on which was situated the ''[[caput]]'' ([[Latin]] for \"head\") or essence of the barony, normally a building, such as a castle or manor house. Accordingly, the owner of the piece of land containing the ''caput'' was called a [[baron]] (or baroness).\n\nThe [[Court of the Lord Lyon]] issued a ruling in April 2015 that recognises a person possessing the dignity of baron and other feudal titles (lordship/earl/marquis). The [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] now prefers the approach of recognizing the particular feudal noble dignity as expressed in the Crown Charter that the petitioner presents.<ref name=\"lyon-court.com\">http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/files/Menking%20Decision.pdf</ref> These titles are recognised as the status of a minor baron but not a peer. Scottish feudal baronies may be passed to any person, of either sex, by inheritance or conveyance.<ref>{{cite book |first=Professor Kenneth |last=Reid |year=2003 |title=The Abolition of Feudal Tenure in Scotland |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Tottel}}</ref>\n\nScotland has a [[Scots Law|distinct legal system]] within the [[United Kingdom]]. Historically, in the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], the Lord Lyon King of Arms, as the Sovereign's minister in matters armorial, is at once [[herald]] and [[judge]]. The Scottish equivalent of an English baron is a [[Lord of Parliament]].\n\n==History==\nA \"Scottish Prescriptive Barony by [[Land tenure|Tenure]]\" was, from [[Tenures Abolition Act 1660|1660]] until 2004, the [[Feudalism|feudal]] description of the only genuine degree of title of [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[nobility]] capable of being bought and sold (along with the ''caput'', or property), rather than passing strictly by blood inheritance.\n\nStatutes of 1592 and the ''Baronetcy Warrants'' of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] show the non-peerage Table of Precedence as: [[Baronet]]s, [[Knight]]s, [[Baron]]s and [[Laird (title)|Lairds]], [[Esquire]] and [[Gentlemen]].\n\nA ''[[Sasine|General Register of Sasines]]'' was set up by Statute in 1617, with entry in the Register giving the ''prescriptive'' right (right by normal or correct usage), after so many years, to the ''caput'' or essence of the barony. The individual who owned the said piece of land containing the ''caput'' was hence the baron or baroness. Uncertainty over armorial right was removed by the ''Lyon Register'' being set up by Statute in 1672, such that no arms were to be borne in Scotland unless validly entered in Lyon Register.\n\nUp until 1874, each new baron was confirmed in his barony by the Crown by Charter of Confirmation. Up until 28 November 2004, a barony was an [[estate (land)|estate]] of land held directly of [[the Crown]], or the [[Prince and Great Steward of Scotland]]. It was an essential element of a barony title that there existed a Crown [[Charter]] erecting the land into a barony, recorded in the Register of the [[Great Seal of Scotland]]. Often the original Charter was later lost, however an Official Extract has the same [[legal status]] as the original Charter.\n\nFrom the [[Treaty of Union]] of 1707 - until 1999 - a unified [[Parliament of Great Britain]] (since January, 1801, known as the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]), at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]], was responsible for passing legislation affecting [[private law]] both north and south of the [[Scotland|Scottish]] border. In 1999, the devolved [[Scottish Parliament]] was established, and private law measures can now be passed at [[Holyrood, Edinburgh|Holyrood]], the seat of the Scottish Parliament in [[Edinburgh]].\n\nUsing a \"prescriptive feudal grant\" allowed developers to impose [[Eternity|perpetual]] conditions affecting the land. The courts became willing to accept the validity of such obligations, which became known as \"real burdens\". In practical and commercial terms, these real burdens were like English [[leasehold]] tenure.\n\n==Abolition of feudal tenure==\nThe first [[Scottish Executive]] was committed to abolishing the [[anachronism]] of the [[Feudalism|feudal system]]. On 28 November 2004, the ''[[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]]'' came into full force and effect, putting an end to Scotland's feudal system. Under [[Scots law]], a Scottish Prescriptive Barony by Tenure is now \"incorporeal feudal heritage\", not attached to the land and remains the only genuine, ''prescriptive'', degree of title of UK nobility capable of being bought and sold \u2013 since under Section 63(1) of the Act, the dignity of baron is preserved after the abolition of the feudal system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2000/5/section/63 |title=Section 63 |work=Abolition of Feudal Tenure, etc (Scotland) Act 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/deleted/library/documents-w10/afs2-12.htm |work=Report on Abolition of Feudal System |title=Appendix A12: ''See Explanatory Notes on Clause 57 Subsection (2)'' |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041119234609/http://www.scotland.gov.uk/deleted/library/documents-w10/afs2-12.htm |archivedate=19 November 2004 }}</ref> However, the Abolition Act did end the ability to get feudal land privileges by inheriting or acquiring the ''caput'' (land or castle) in Scotland.  In [[common law]] jurisdictions, land may still be owned and inherited through a barony if the land is titled in \"the Baron of X\" as baron rather than in the individual's name.  In America, it passes with the barony as a [[fee simple]] appurtenance to an otherwise [[incorporeal hereditament]], the barony being treated like a landowning [[corporation]].<ref>{{cite court  |litigants=Re Notarial Instrument of the Earl of Galloway; Disposition; Warrant for Letters Patent |reporter=No.s 103, 104, 105, ''Palmyra Island Land Recordation'', United States District Court for the District of Hawaii |date=2017 |court=D.C.

Prior to the Act coming into effect, Scottish feudal baronies (including lordships and earldoms) were the only genuine title of UK nobility capable of being transferred following the sale of land containing a ''caput'' (or the sale of a feudal superiority).\n\nMost baronies were created (erected) prior to 1745, but one was erected as late as 1824. Since the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 came into effect, the [[Lord Lyon]], who is the Chief Herald of Scotland, has restored a more traditional form to the [[coat of arms]] of a baron. Barons are now identified by the helm befitting their degree. A new policy statement has been made by the Lord Lyon to this effect.\n\nIndependent Scots legal advice should always be taken before entering into any contract that claims to offer a baronial title for sale. The holder of the dignity of a barony may petition the Lord Lyon for a [[Grant of Arms|grant of arms]], as he falls under the jurisdiction of the [[Court of the Lord Lyon|Lyon's Court]]. A policy statement has been made to this effect by the Lord Lyon.<ref name=\"lyon-court.com\"/> The Lyon Court has no jurisdiction in relation to the transfer of, or legal \"trade\" in, feudal titles. Any prospective purchaser should seek specialist independent Scots [[Scots law|legal]] [[legal advice|advice]].\n\n==Usage==\nAn English barony is a [[peerage]] (yet the abolition act of 1660 allows for some remaining non-peer baronies not converted by writ to remain as feudal baronies of free socage \"incorporeal hereditament\" similar to a lordship of the manor), but whether Scottish barons rightfully rank as peers is disputable.<ref>{{cite web |author=Graham Senior-Milne, 41st Baron of Mordington  |date=27 June 2005  |url=http://www.peerage.org/genealogy/Baronies.htm |title=Scottish feudal baronies (feudal barons, feudal baron) including the oath of a knight}}</ref> They are known as minor barons currently treated as noble titles of less than peerage rank.  The Scottish equivalent of an English baron is \"[[List of Barons|Lord of Parliament]]\".\n\nThe feudal baronial title tends to be used when a landed family is not in possession of any United Kingdom peerage title of higher rank, subsequently granted, or has been created a knight of the [[realm]].  The name recorded by the [[Lord Lyon]] as part of any grant of arms or matriculation becomes the holder's name for all official purposes.\n\nThe holder of a Scottish barony (''e.g.'', \"Inverglen\") may add the title to his existing name (''e.g.'', \"John Smith, Baron of Inverglen\") or add the territorial designation to his surname if still in possession of the caput (\"John Smith of Inverglen, Baron of Inverglen\"); some of the oldest Scottish families prefer to be styled by the [[territorial designation]] alone (\"Smith of Inverglen\").<ref name=\"scotsbarons1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsbarons.org/titles_and_usages.htm |title=Titles and Usages |publisher=Scotsbarons.org |accessdate=17 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225165126/http://www.scotsbarons.org/titles_and_usages.htm |archivedate=25 February 2015  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.debretts.com/forms-of-address/titles/scottish--and-irish-titles/scottish-feudal-baronies.aspx |title=Scottish Feudal Baronies, Scottish and Irish Titles, Titles, Forms Of Address &#124; Debrett's |publisher=Debretts.com |accessdate=17 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725234418/http://www.debretts.com/forms-of-address/titles/scottish--and-irish-titles/scottish-feudal-baronies.aspx |archivedate=25 July 2013  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peerage.org/genealogy/Baronies.htm#Forms_of_address |title=Scottish feudal baronies (feudal barons, feudal baron) including the oath of a knight |publisher=Peerage.org |accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> Formal and in writing, they are styled as [[The Much Honoured]] Baron of Inverglen.

If accepted (and if the applicant wishes to include the title), the correct form is for the applicant to include the territorial designation as part of their surname (Surname of territorial designation e.g. ''Smith of Inverglen''). The Observation would then show the holder's full name, followed by their feudal title e.g. ''The holder is John Smith, Baron of Inverglen''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/118548/titles-included-in-passports.pdf |title=Titles included in passports |page=3 |publisher=UK government website}}</ref>\n\n==Scottish heraldry==\n[[File:ScotsBaronsHelm.JPG|thumb|A Scottish baron's [[Barons in Scotland#Helmet|helmet]]]]\nThe former Lord Lyon declined to award the following baronial additaments to the arms of those feudal barons registering arms now that the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 is in force.  However, the current Lord Lyon has confirmed in a recent policy statement that he will officially recognise feudal barons or those possessing the dignity of baron who meet certain conditions and will grant them arms with a helmet befitting their degree. Scottish Barons rank below Lords of Parliament; while noble, they are not conventionally considered peerage titles. Unlike others, the titles can be hereditary or bought and sold.\n\nIn showing that Scottish barons are titles of nobility, reference may be made, amongst others, to Lyon Court in the Petition of Maclean of Ardgour for a Birthbrieve by Interlocutor dated 26 February 1943 which \"Finds and Declares that the Minor Barons of Scotland are, and have both in this Nobiliary Court, and in the Court of Session, been recognised as 'titled' nobility, and that the estait of the Baronage (The Barones Minores) is of the ancient Feudal Nobility of Scotland\".\n\nSir Thomas Innes of Learney in his 'Scots Heraldry' (2nd Ed., p.&nbsp;88, note 1) states that 'The Act 1672, cap 47, specially qualifies the degrees thus: Nobles (i.e. peers, the term being here used in a restricted seventeenth-century English sense), Barons (i.e. Lairds of baronial fiefs and their \"heirs\", who, even if fiefless, are equivalent to heads of Continental baronial houses) and Gentlemen (apparently all other armigers).' Baronets and knights are evidently classed as 'Gentlemen' here and are of a lower degree than Barons. The Scottish Head of Baronial Houses, includes all the various styles and titles which designate the territorial nobility i.e. baron of X.\n\nBarons may also wear two eagle feathers when in traditional dress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tartansauthority.com/highland-dress/modern/how-to-wear-the-kilt/some-advice/ |title=How to wear the kilt &#124; Scottish Tartans Authority |publisher=Tartansauthority.com |accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsbarons.org/hereditary_offices.htm |title=Hereditary offices |publisher=Scotsbarons.org |accessdate=17 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226024221/http://www.scotsbarons.org/hereditary_offices.htm |archivedate=26 February 2015}}</ref> If the baron is a member of a clan, it is advisable to consult the clan chief on clan customs and traditions. The Lord Lyon only gives guidance and not governance on the wearing of feathers and recommends consulting with a clan chief.\n\n===Chapeau===\n[[File:Azure Chapeau.PNG|thumb|An azure [[chapeau]]]]\nPreviously, between the 1930s and 2004, when new arms were granted or a matriculation of existing arms took note of a barony, the owner was given a ''[[chapeau]]'' or [[cap of maintenance]] as part of his [[Coat of arms|armorial achievement]] on petitioning for the same. This chapeau is described as \"gules doubled ermine\" for barons in possession of the caput of the barony. An azure chapeau is appropriate for the heirs of ancient baronial families who are no longer owners of the estates. This chapeau was a relatively recent armorial invention of the late [[Lord Lyon]] [[Thomas Innes of Learney]].  Accordingly, a number of ancient arms of feudal barons do not display the chapeau, and now it is no longer granted.\n\nAt the [[Treaty of Perth]] in 1266, Norway relinquished its claim to the Hebrides and Man, and they became part of Scotland. In 1292, Argyll was created a shire and \"The Barons of all [[Argyll]] and the [[Lord of the Isles|Foreigners' Isles]]\", which had preceded the kingdom of Scotland, became eligible to attend the \"Scots\" Parliament&nbsp;\u2013 appearing in the record of the parliament at [[St Andrews|St. Andrews]] in 1309. Historically they have a chapeau, \"gules doubled ermines\", [[Ermine (heraldry)#Later variations|ermines]] being white tails on black.\n\nThere is a unique exception: the [[Bachuil|Barony of the Bachuil]] is not of feudal origin like other baronies but is [[Allodial title|allodial]] in that it predates (562 A.D.) Scotland itself and the feudal system, dating from the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] Kingdom of [[D\u00e1l Riata]]. In recognition as allodial ''Barons par la gr\u00e2ce de Dieu'' not barons by a [[feudal]] crown grant, the Baron of the Bachuil has the only chapeau allowed to have a [[vair]] ([[squirrel]] fur) lining.<ref name=\"bachuil\"/>\n\nA chapeau, if part of an armorial achievement, is placed into the space directly above the shield and below the helmet. It may otherwise be used on a [[visiting card]], the flap of an envelope, or to ensign the circlet of a crest badge as used on a bonnet.\n\n===Feudo-baronial mantle===\n[[File:Barony Robe and Chapeau.PNG|thumb|The historical Scottish baron's mantle and chapeau from the 1930s to 2004, which are no longer granted]]\nParticularly Scottish in character is the ''feudo-baronial mantle'' or robe of estate - described as gules doubled silk argent, fur-edged of miniver and collared in ermine, fastened on the right shoulder by five spherical buttons Or. This may be displayed in a [[Mantle and pavilion (heraldry)|pavilioned form]], draped behind the complete achievement of arms - or the armorial shield alone - tied open with cords and tassels, and surmounted by the chapeau. Again, Lord Lyon is no longer granting these heraldic mantles.\n\n===Helmet===\nThe ''helmet'' is now the chief mode of recognition of a Scottish baron.  The Lord Lyon has adopted a steel helm with grille of three grilles, garnished in gold, as the current baronial additament.  Alternatively, a feudal steel tilting helm garnished in gold, that may be shown affront\u00e9, may appear, or a helmet of some other degree if the baron holds a higher rank, such as a lordship of parliament.\n\n===Supporters===\n''[[Supporters]]'', are now usually reserved for the holders of the older baronies (chartered before 1587) and those that have been in continuous [[Family business|family ownership]]. In England, supporters are reserved for the peerage, and a Scottish baron who approaches the English [[College of Arms]] is not allowed supporters. A ''compartment'' has occasionally been granted to barons, representing their territories, even in cases where there are no supporters.\n\n===Badge===\nA ''badge'' \u2013 distinct from the ''crest'' \u2013 as a separate armorial device, is not necessarily a feature of the arms. The badge may be used by the \"tail\" or following of a landowner baron. The grant is linked to the baron's ''standard'', a heraldic flag, in the [[livery]] colours that carries a large representation of the badge. The standard is blazoned in the grant or matriculation. The livery colours are usually the two most prominent colours of the arms themselves.\n\n===Flags===\nA ''Standard'' \u2013 an elongated shape, tapering from 1.2 m down to 60&nbsp;cm, with the fly edge split and rounded (lanceolate). The length is according to rank, from 7.5 m for the Sovereign down to 3.5 m for a Knight, '''Baron''' or Chief. It bears the Arms as on the shield or the saltire in the hoist, with the tail parted per fess with the Crest, Badge and/or Supporter, plus the motto on one or more Ribands. The Standard is set before the '''Baron/Chief's''' tent (as it's a \"Headquarters\" flag and does not indicate that the Armiger is in residence) rather than carried like the banner. A Standard requires a separate grant by the Lord Lyon and is only made under certain conditions.\n\nA ''Guidon'' \u2013 one-third shorter than a Standard and tapering to a round, unsplit end at the fly. These are assigned by Lord Lyon to individuals who have Supporters to their Arms, and to others who have a following \u2013 those in a position of leadership or some official position.\n\nA ''Pennon'' \u2013 a smaller, elongated flag 4&nbsp;ft long with a pointed, rounded or swallow-tailed end, designed to be displayed on a lance, assigned by Lord Lyon King to an Armiger who applies for one. It is charged with the motto of the armiger as well as the arms as on the shield.\n\nA ''Banner'' \u2013 a square or rectangular upright representation of the Arms designed for carrying in warfare or tournaments, but now flown as a \"house flag\" when the Armiger is in residence and is NOT the flag of the Clan or Family.  Originally, conspicuous gallantry in battle was marked by cutting off the tail of the Standard or Pennon, turning it into a Banner. Strictly speaking, the sizes and shapes are:\n \n''Square banner'' \u2013 Sovereign, 1.5 m square; Dukes; 1.25 m sq; Earls, 1.1 m sq; Viscounts and Barons, 1 m sq; Baronets and '''feudal barons''', 0.9 m sq; other Armigers, 70&nbsp;cm wide x 85&nbsp;cm high\n \n''Rectangular banner'' \u2013 typically in the ratio 3:2, or 5:4 when flown as the \"house flag\" of an Armiger.\n \n''Carrying flag'' \u2013 this should be sized as follows (width x height): Peers, 1.2 m x 1.5 m; '''Feudal Barons''', 90&nbsp;cm x 115&nbsp;cm; Chiefs, 85&nbsp;cm x 110&nbsp;cm; Chieftains, 80&nbsp;cm x 90&nbsp;cm.\n\nA ''Ensign'' may be occasionally granted and blazoned. This is a square flag, smaller than the flying banner, and carrying the full embroidered achievement (arms, crest, motto), again fringed in livery colours.\n\nA ''Pipe banner'' \u2013 rather similar to a Banner, but of a size to fit on the longest drone of the pipes (usually 45&nbsp;cm) and richly decorated with gold fringing, tassles and the like. The pipe banner for a Chief who is also a Peer or a '''Feudal Baron''' should have a rounded end extending beyond the length, and any other Chief a split rounded end. A feudal baron is authorised two pipers.\n\n==List of Feudal Baronies (created before 1707)==\nBelow is a list of some Scottish feudal baronies created before 1707; this list does not include Scottish feudal baronies created between that year and 1838 (BGH), when the most recent creation of a Scottish feudal barony occurred.\n\n{{Expand list|date=January 2011}}\n:''When updating this list, please create for each new entry a separate, [[WP:Wikify|wikified]] article titled \"Scottish feudal barony of X\", which records a brief biography of the previous incumbent and is wikilinked to this list.
