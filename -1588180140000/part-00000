The Cimbrian War was the first time since the [[Second Punic War]] that [[Italia (Roman province)|Italia]] and [[Rome]] itself had been seriously threatened.\n\nThe timing of the war had a great effect on the internal politics of Rome, and the organization of its military. The war contributed greatly to the political career of [[Gaius Marius]], whose [[consul]]ships and political conflicts challenged many of the [[Roman Republic]]'s political institutions and customs of the time. The Cimbrian threat, along with the [[Jugurthine War]], inspired the landmark [[Marian reforms]] of the [[Roman legion]]s.\n\nRome was finally victorious, and its Germanic adversaries\u2014who had inflicted on the Roman armies the heaviest losses that they had suffered since the [[Second Punic War]] with victories at the battles of [[Battle of Arausio|Arausio]] and [[Battle of Noreia|Noreia]]\u2014were left almost completely annihilated after Roman victories at [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae|Aquae Sextiae]] and [[Battle of Vercellae|Vercellae]].

Together they defeated the [[Scordisci]], along with the [[Boii]], many of whom apparently joined them. In 113 BC they arrived on the [[Danube]], in [[Noricum]], home to the Roman-allied [[Taurisci]]. Unable to hold back these new, powerful invaders on their own, the Taurisci called on Rome for aid.\n\n== Initial Roman defeats ==\nThe following year the Roman [[consul]] [[Gnaeus Papirius Carbo (consul 113 BC)|Gnaeus Papirius Carbo]] led the [[Roman legion|legions]] into Noricum, and after making an impressive show of force, took up a strong defensive position and demanded that the Cimbri and their allies leave the province immediately. The Cimbri initially set about complying peacefully with Rome's demands, but soon discovered that Carbo had laid an ambush against them. Infuriated by this treachery, they attacked and, at the [[Battle of Noreia]], annihilated Carbo's army, almost killing Carbo in the process.\n\nItaly was now open to invasion, yet for some reason, the Cimbri and their allies moved west over the Alps and into [[Gaul]]. In 109 BC, they invaded the Roman province of [[Gallia Narbonensis]] and defeated the Roman army there under [[Marcus Junius Silanus (consul 109 BC)|Marcus Junius Silanus]]. In 107 BC, the Romans were defeated again, this time by the [[Tigurini]], who were allies of the Cimbri whom they had met on their way through the [[Alps]]. That same year, they defeated another Roman army at the [[Battle of Burdigala]] (modern day [[Bordeaux]]) and killed its commander, the consul [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus Ravalla]].\n\n== Disaster at Arausio ==\nIn 105 BC, Rome and its new consul [[Gnaeus Mallius Maximus]] and the proconsul [[Quintus Servilius Caepio]], in order to settle the matter once and for all, gathered the largest force it had fielded since the Second Punic War, and possibly the largest force it had ever sent to battle. The force consisted of over 80,000 men, along with tens of thousands of support personnel and camp followers in two armies, one led by each consul.\n\nThe consuls led their armies on their own armed migration to the [[Rh\u00f4ne River]] near [[Orange, Vaucluse]], where, disliking and distrusting each other, they erected separate camps on opposite sides of the river; by so doing they left their disunited force open to separate attack. The overconfident Caepio foolishly attacked without support from Maximus; his legions were wiped out and his undefended camp overrun. The now isolated and demoralized troops of Maximus were then easily defeated. Thousands more were slain trying desperately to rally and defend his poorly positioned camp. Only Caepio, Maximus, and a few hundred Romans escaped with their lives across the carnage-choked river. The [[Battle of Arausio]] was the costliest defeat Rome had suffered since [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]] and, in fact, the losses and long-term consequences were far greater. For the Cimbri and Teutones it was a great (though temporary) triumph.\n\nInstead of immediately gathering their allies and marching on Rome, the Cimbri proceeded to [[Hispania]]. There, they suffered their first defeat, not at the hands of a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] army, but against a [[Celtiberians|Celtiberian]] coalition.<ref>Livio. ''Periochae''. LXVII.</ref> In the meantime, the Teutones remained in Gaul. Why they again failed to invade Italy remains a mystery. [[Theodor Mommsen]] speculatively describes their methods of war:\n\n{{quote|text=Their system of warfare was substantially that of the Celts of this period, who no longer fought, as the Italian Celts had formerly done, bareheaded and with merely sword and dagger, but with copper helmets often richly adorned and with a peculiar missile weapon, the ''materis''; the large sword was retained and the long narrow shield, along with which they probably wore also a coat of mail. They were not destitute of cavalry; but the Romans were superior to them in that arm. Their order of battle was as formerly a rude phalanx professedly drawn up with just as many ranks in depth as in breadth, the first rank of which in dangerous combats not unfrequently tied together their metallic girdles with cords.<ref>[http://italian.classic-literature.co.uk/history-of-rome/04-the-revolution/ebook-page-67.asp Mommsen, Theodor, History of Rome, Book IV \"The Revolution\", pp 66\u201372.]</ref>|sign=|source=}}\n\n== Marius takes command ==\n{{Main|Marian reforms}}\nFollowing the devastation of the Arausio, fear shook the Roman Republic to its foundations. The ''terror cimbricus'' became a watchword, as Rome expected the Cimbri at its gates at any time. In this atmosphere of panic and desperation, an emergency was declared. The constitution was ignored and [[Gaius Marius]], the victor over [[Jugurtha]] of [[Numidia]] was elected consul for an unprecedented, and arguably illegal, five years in a row, starting in 104 BC. Because of the destruction of the Roman force at Arausio and the pressure of the impending crisis, Marius was now given the latitude to construct a new army on his own terms.\n\nUntil now, the army had been a well-trained, well-regulated [[militia]] drawn from all able-bodied, land-owning male citizens.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Marius replaced this with a professional standing force composed mostly of able-bodied but landless volunteers. He improved and standardized training, weapons, armour, equipment, and command structure, and made the [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]] the main tactical and administrative unit of the legion. Along with these new arrangements came new standards and symbols, such as the [[Aquila (Roman)|aquila]], which the troops came to revere and which was almost never allowed to fall into enemy hands.\n\nWhile the panicked Senate and people of Rome gave Marius the power he needed to build his army, the failure of the Cimbri and Teutones to follow up on their victory gave him the time he needed to finish it. They would soon be confronted by an army of organized, highly trained, professional soldiers under the leadership of a brilliant and ruthless commander.\n\n== Turning point ==\nBy 102 BC, Marius was ready to face the Cimbri; the latter, after difficulties in Spain, had turned north into Gaul, where they were joined by the [[Teutons]], a Germanic tribe apparently from north-Germany or Denmark. After this union, the Germanic coalition determined to move back south upon Italy, which they had previously avoided.<ref>A. H. Beesely, ''The Gracchi, Marius, and Sulla Epochs of Ancient History'', (Kindle edition), ch. V., P. 53</ref> Marching south through [[Switzerland]] and [[Savoy]], their army was augmented by some tribes of [[Helveti]]ans, particularly the [[Tigurini]], and the [[Ambrones]] of uncertain descent.<ref>Beesely, p. 54</ref> Before approaching Italy, the Germans decided on a two pronged movement; the Teutons with the Ambrones and the Tigurini would move from the west along the coast-road from Transalpine into Cisalpine Gaul; while the Cimbri would march east and turn around into Italy by the Julian and Carnic Alps.<ref>Beesely, Ibid</ref> When Marius heard of their movements, he advanced to [[Valence (city)|Valence]], and established his camp at the confluence of the [[Is\u00e8re (river)|Is\u00e8re]] and the [[Rh\u00f4ne]], where he could observe and halt the march of the Teutons. When the Teutons arrived, they attempted to force him into battle, but he declined; they attacked the Roman camp, but were beaten off. Impatient of the delay and of Marius' passivity, they finally decided to simply march past him into Italy. So enormous were their numbers, that they reportedly took 6 whole days marching by his camp, and in their arrogance they taunted the Romans, ''what message they wished them to give to their wives?''<ref>Beesely, ibid</ref>  Marius followed cautiously, maintaining distance from the enemy, but closely following his movements. A few days later, a skirmish turned into a battle with the Ambrones, who for some reason camped separately from the Teutones.<ref name=MPOF1>Marc Hyden, ''Gaius Marius'', pp 132-134; Plutarch, ''Life of Marius'', 19.1-6; Orosius, ''Against the Pagans'', 5.16; Florus, ''Epitome of Roman History'', 1.38.9.</ref> The Ambrones were defeated with heavy losses and fled to their Teutonic allies.<ref name=MPOF1/> The Teutones halted their trek south and awaited Marius near [[Aquae Sextiae]]. This afforded Marius favorable conditions, for with his enemy stationary he got to scout the battlegrounds and he chose his ground carefully. In the subsequent [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae|battle]], he lured the Teutones and their allies into attacking him while his army was occupying the highground. During their attack they were ambushed from the rear by a select force of five cohorts which Marius had hidden in a nearby wood. The Teutones were routed and massacred and their king, [[Teutobod]], was placed in Roman chains. But Aquae Sextiae had only evened the score: while the Teutones had been eliminated, the Cimbri remained a formidable threat.\n[[File:The defeat of the Cimbri.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Defeat of the Cimbri'', by [[Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps|Alexandre Gabriel D\u00e9camps]]]]\nIn 101 BC, the Cimbri returned to Gaul and prepared for the final stage of their struggle with Rome. For the first time they penetrated through the Alpine passes, which Marius's co-consul for that year, [[Quintus Lutatius Catulus]], had failed to fortify, into northern Italy. Catulus withdrew behind the [[Po River]], leaving the countryside open to the invaders. But the Cimbri took their time ravishing the fertile region, which gave Marius time to arrive with reinforcements \u2014 his same victorious legions from Aquae Sextiae. It would be at [[Battle of Vercellae|Vercellae]] near the confluence of the [[Sesia River]] with the Po on the Raudine Plain where the superiority of the new Roman legions and their cavalry were clearly demonstrated. In the devastating defeat the Cimbri were virtually annihilated, and both their highest leaders, [[Boiorix]] and Lugius, fell. The women killed both themselves and their children in order to avoid slavery. Thus the war, which began with a mass migration, ended in defeat and mass suicide.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Cimbri were not completely wiped off the face of the map or from the pages of history. Their allies, the [[Boii]], with whom they intermixed, settled in southern Gaul and Germania and were there to welcome and confront [[Julius Caesar]],  Marius's nephew, in his campaigns of conquest. Some of the surviving captives are reported to have been among the rebelling [[gladiator]]s in the [[Third Servile War]].<ref name=strauss/>\n\nThe political consequences from the war had an immediate and lasting impact on Rome. The end of the Cimbrian war marked the beginning of the rivalry between Marius and [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]], which eventually led to the first of Rome's great [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars]]. Moreover, following the final victory at Vercellae, and without first asking permission from the Senate, Marius granted Roman citizenship to his Italian allied soldiers, claiming that in the din of battle he could not distinguish between the voices of Romans and the Italic allies. Henceforth all Italian legions became Roman legions and the allied cities of the Italian peninsula progressively began to demand a greater say in the external policy of the Republic, leading eventually to the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n*Dupuy, R.

The Teutones were routed and massacred and their king, [[Teutobod]], was placed in Roman chains. But Aquae Sextiae had only evened the score: while the Teutones had been eliminated, the Cimbri remained a formidable threat.\n[[File:The defeat of the Cimbri.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Defeat of the Cimbri'', by [[Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps|Alexandre Gabriel D\u00e9camps]]]]\nIn 101 BC, the Cimbri returned to Gaul and prepared for the final stage of their struggle with Rome. For the first time they penetrated through the Alpine passes, which Marius's co-consul for that year, [[Quintus Lutatius Catulus]], had failed to fortify, into northern Italy. Catulus withdrew behind the [[Po River]], leaving the countryside open to the invaders. But the Cimbri took their time ravishing the fertile region, which gave Marius time to arrive with reinforcements \u2014 his same victorious legions from Aquae Sextiae. It would be at [[Battle of Vercellae|Vercellae]] near the confluence of the [[Sesia River]] with the Po on the Raudine Plain where the superiority of the new Roman legions and their cavalry were clearly demonstrated. In the devastating defeat the Cimbri were virtually annihilated, and both their highest leaders, [[Boiorix]] and Lugius, fell. The women killed both themselves and their children in order to avoid slavery. Thus the war, which began with a mass migration, ended in defeat and mass suicide.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe Cimbri were not completely wiped off the face of the map or from the pages of history. Their allies, the [[Boii]], with whom they intermixed, settled in southern Gaul and Germania and were there to welcome and confront [[Julius Caesar]],  Marius's nephew, in his campaigns of conquest. Some of the surviving captives are reported to have been among the rebelling [[gladiator]]s in the [[Third Servile War]].<ref name=strauss/>\n\nThe political consequences from the war had an immediate and lasting impact on Rome. The end of the Cimbrian war marked the beginning of the rivalry between Marius and [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]], which eventually led to the first of Rome's great [[Roman Republican civil wars|civil wars]]. Moreover, following the final victory at Vercellae, and without first asking permission from the Senate, Marius granted Roman citizenship to his Italian allied soldiers, claiming that in the din of battle he could not distinguish between the voices of Romans and the Italic allies. Henceforth all Italian legions became Roman legions and the allied cities of the Italian peninsula progressively began to demand a greater say in the external policy of the Republic, leading eventually to the [[Social War (91\u201388 BC)|Social War]].\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n*Dupuy, R.

Embarrassment is similar to [[shame]] in some sense, except that shame may be experienced for an act known only to oneself.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Also, embarrassment usually carries the connotation of being caused by an act that is merely socially unacceptable, rather than [[morality|morally]] wrong.\n\n== Causes ==\nTrying to come for me and saying things cant be edited on wikipedia makes it not a credible source. Embarrassment can be personal, caused by unwanted attention to private matters or personal flaws or mishaps or shyness. Some causes of embarrassment stem from personal actions, such as being caught in a lie or in making a mistake. In many cultures, being seen [[nude]] or inappropriately dressed is a particularly stressful form of embarrassment (see [[Body modesty|modesty]]). Personal embarrassment can also stem from the actions of others who place the embarrassed person in a socially awkward situation\u2014such as a parent showing one's baby pictures to friends, having someone make a derogatory comment about one's appearance or behavior, discovering one is the victim of [[gossip]], being rejected by another person (see also [[humiliation]]), being made the focus of attention (e.g., [[birthday]] celebrants, newlyweds), or even [[Vicarious embarrassment|witnessing someone else's embarrassment]].\n\nPersonal embarrassment is usually accompanied by some combination of [[blushing]], [[sweating]], [[Anxiety|nervousness]], [[stammer]]ing, and [[fidgeting]].  Sometimes the embarrassed person tries to mask embarrassment with smiles or [[nervous laughter]], especially in etiquette situations. Such a response is more common in certain cultures, which may lead to misunderstanding. There may also be feelings of [[anger]] depending on the perceived seriousness of the situation, especially if the individual thinks another person is intentionally causing the embarrassment. There is a range of responses, with the most minor being a perception of the embarrassing act as inconsequential or even [[humor]]ous, to intense apprehension or fear.\n\nThe idea that embarrassment serves an apology or appeasement function originated with Goffman who argued the embarrassed individual \"demonstrates that he/she is at least disturbed by the fact and may prove worthy at another time\".{{sfn|Goffman|1067}} Semin and Manstead demonstrated social functions of embarrassment whereby the perpetrator of knocking over a sales display (the \"bad act\") was deemed more likable by others if he/she appeared embarrassed than if he/she appeared unconcerned \u2013 regardless of restitution behavior (rebuilding the display).{{sfn|Semin|Manstead|1982}} The capacity to experience embarrassment can also be seen as functional for the group or culture. It has been demonstrated that those who are not prone to embarrassment are more likely to engage in antisocial behavior \u2013 for example, adolescent boys who displayed more embarrassment were found less likely to engage in aggressive/delinquent behaviors. Similarly, embarrassment exhibited by boys more likely to engage in aggressive/delinquent behavior was less than one-third of that exhibited by non-aggressive boys.{{sfn|Ketlner et al|1995}} Thus proneness to embarrassment (i.e., a concern for how one is evaluated by others) can act as a brake on behavior that would be dysfunctional for a group or culture.\n\n===Professional embarrassment===\nEmbarrassment can also be '''professional''' or '''official''', especially after statements expressing confidence in a stated course of action, or willful disregard for evidence.  Embarrassment increases greatly in instances involving official duties or workplace facilities, large amounts of money or materials, or loss of human life.  Examples of causes include a government's failed public policy, exposure of corrupt practices or unethical behavior, a celebrity whose personal habits receive public scrutiny or face legal action, or officials caught in serious personally embarrassing situations. Even small errors or miscalculations can lead to significantly greater official embarrassment if it is discovered that there was willful disregard for evidence or directives involved (e.g., see [[Space Shuttle Challenger]]).\n\nNot all official failures result in official embarrassment, even if the circumstances lead to some slight personal embarrassment for the people involved.  For example, losing a close political election might cause some personal embarrassment for the candidate but generally would be considered an honorable loss in the profession and thus not necessarily lead to professional embarrassment. Similarly, a scientist might be personally disappointed and embarrassed if one of his hypotheses was proven wrong, but would not normally suffer professional embarrassment as a result.  By contrast, exposure of falsified data supporting a scientific claim (e.g., see [[Hwang Woo-Suk]]) would likely lead to professional embarrassment in the scientific community.

Embarrassment is similar to [[shame]] in some sense, except that shame may be experienced for an act known only to oneself.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Also, embarrassment usually carries the connotation of being caused by an act that is merely socially unacceptable, rather than [[morality|morally]] wrong.\n\n== Causes ==\nEmbarrassment can be personal, caused by unwanted attention to private matters or personal flaws or mishaps or shyness. Some causes of embarrassment stem from personal actions, such as being caught in a lie or in making a mistake. In many cultures, being seen [[nude]] or inappropriately dressed is a particularly stressful form of embarrassment (see [[Body modesty|modesty]]). Personal embarrassment can also stem from the actions of others who place the embarrassed person in a socially awkward situation\u2014such as a parent showing one's baby pictures to friends, having someone make a derogatory comment about one's appearance or behavior, discovering one is the victim of [[gossip]], being rejected by another person (see also [[humiliation]]), being made the focus of attention (e.g., [[birthday]] celebrants, newlyweds), or even [[Vicarious embarrassment|witnessing someone else's embarrassment]].\n\nPersonal embarrassment is usually accompanied by some combination of [[blushing]], [[sweating]], [[Anxiety|nervousness]], [[stammer]]ing, and [[fidgeting]].  Sometimes the embarrassed person tries to mask embarrassment with smiles or [[nervous laughter]], especially in etiquette situations. Such a response is more common in certain cultures, which may lead to misunderstanding. There may also be feelings of [[anger]] depending on the perceived seriousness of the situation, especially if the individual thinks another person is intentionally causing the embarrassment. There is a range of responses, with the most minor being a perception of the embarrassing act as inconsequential or even [[humor]]ous, to intense apprehension or fear.\n\nThe idea that embarrassment serves an apology or appeasement function originated with Goffman who argued the embarrassed individual \"demonstrates that he/she is at least disturbed by the fact and may prove worthy at another time\".{{sfn|Goffman|1067}} Semin and Manstead demonstrated social functions of embarrassment whereby the perpetrator of knocking over a sales display (the \"bad act\") was deemed more likable by others if he/she appeared embarrassed than if he/she appeared unconcerned \u2013 regardless of restitution behavior (rebuilding the display).{{sfn|Semin|Manstead|1982}} The capacity to experience embarrassment can also be seen as functional for the group or culture. It has been demonstrated that those who are not prone to embarrassment are more likely to engage in antisocial behavior \u2013 for example, adolescent boys who displayed more embarrassment were found less likely to engage in aggressive/delinquent behaviors. Similarly, embarrassment exhibited by boys more likely to engage in aggressive/delinquent behavior was less than one-third of that exhibited by non-aggressive boys.{{sfn|Ketlner et al|1995}} Thus proneness to embarrassment (i.e., a concern for how one is evaluated by others) can act as a brake on behavior that would be dysfunctional for a group or culture.\n\n===Professional embarrassment===\nEmbarrassment can also be '''professional''' or '''official''', especially after statements expressing confidence in a stated course of action, or willful disregard for evidence.  Embarrassment increases greatly in instances involving official duties or workplace facilities, large amounts of money or materials, or loss of human life.  Examples of causes include a government's failed public policy, exposure of corrupt practices or unethical behavior, a celebrity whose personal habits receive public scrutiny or face legal action, or officials caught in serious personally embarrassing situations. Even small errors or miscalculations can lead to significantly greater official embarrassment if it is discovered that there was willful disregard for evidence or directives involved (e.g., see [[Space Shuttle Challenger]]).\n\nNot all official failures result in official embarrassment, even if the circumstances lead to some slight personal embarrassment for the people involved.  For example, losing a close political election might cause some personal embarrassment for the candidate but generally would be considered an honorable loss in the profession and thus not necessarily lead to professional embarrassment. Similarly, a scientist might be personally disappointed and embarrassed if one of his hypotheses was proven wrong, but would not normally suffer professional embarrassment as a result.  By contrast, exposure of falsified data supporting a scientific claim (e.g., see [[Hwang Woo-Suk]]) would likely lead to professional embarrassment in the scientific community. Professional or official embarrassment is often accompanied by public expressions of [[anger]], [[denial]] of involvement, or attempts to [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimize]] the consequences.  Sometimes the embarrassed entity issues press statements, removes or distance themselves from sub-level employees, attempts to carry on as if nothing happened, suffers income loss, emigrates, or vanishes from public view.\n\n===Vicarious embarrassment===\n\n{{Main|Vicarious embarrassment}}\nVicarious embarrassment is an embarrassed feeling from observing the embarrassing actions of another person.<ref name=validation>Ahmet Uysal, G\u00fcl\u00e7in Akbas, Elif Helvac\u0131, and Irem Metin, [https://www.academia.edu/6563886/Validation_and_correlates_of_the_vicarious_embarrassment_scale Validation and correlates of the vicarious embarrassment scale], ''Personality and Individual Differences'' 60 (2014), pp. 48\u201353</ref> People who rate themselves as more empathic are more likely to experience vicarious embarrassment.<ref name=eurekalert>EurekAlert!, [https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-04/plos-yfa041211.php Your flaws are my pain], 13 April 2011</ref> The effect is present whether or not the observed party is aware of the embarrassing nature of their actions, although awareness generally increases the strength of the felt vicarious embarrassment, as does an accidental (as opposed to intentional) action.<ref name=flaws>S\u00f6ren Krach, Jan Christopher Cohrs, Nicole Cruz de Echeverr\u00eda Loebell, Tilo Kircher, Jens Sommer, Andreas Jansen, and Frieder Michel Paulus, [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0018675 Your Flaws Are My Pain: Linking Empathy To Vicarious Embarrassment], PLoS ONE, 13 April 2011</ref>\n\n===Types in social psychology===\n[[File:Antoine Watteau 014.jpg|thumb|''An embarrassing proposal'' by [[Antoine Watteau]]]]\nOne typology of embarrassment is described by Sharkey and Stafford.
