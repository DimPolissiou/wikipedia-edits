His father, [[Cumhall]], a warrior in Conn's service, was a suitor of [[Muirne]], daughter of the druid [[Tadg mac Nuadat]], but Tadg refused his suit, so Cumhall abducted her. Conn went to war against him, and Cumhall was killed by [[Goll mac Morna]] in the Battle of Cnucha. But Muirne was already pregnant, and Tadg rejected her, ordering her to be burned. She fled to Conn, and Conn put her under the protection of Cumhall's brother-in-law Fiacal mac Conchinn. It was in Fiacal's house that she gave birth to a son, Deimne, who was later renamed Fionn.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/f01.html \"The Cause of the Battle of Cnucha\"], [[Tom Peete Cross]] & Clark Harris Slover (eds.), ''Ancient Irish Tales'', Henry Holt & Co, 1936, pp. 357\u2013359</ref> When he was ten, Fionn came to Tara put himself into Conn's service. He learned that every year at [[Samhain]], the monster [[Aillen]] would put everyone at Tara to sleep with his music, and burn down the palace with his fiery breath.

Connla fell in love with a fairy woman from [[Mag Mell]], and went with her to her otherworld home in her crystal boat, leaving Art alone.

She had fallen in love with Art from a distance and sought him out in her [[currach]], but when she met Conn and learned he was without a wife, agreed to marry him instead, on the condition that Art be banished from Tara for a year. The men of Ireland thought this unjust, and Ireland was barren during that year. The druids discovered that this was B\u00e9 Chuille's fault, and declared that the famine could be ended by the sacrifice of the son of a sinless couple in front of Tara. Conn went in search of this boy in B\u00e9 Chuille's currach. He landed on a strange island of apple-trees. The queen of the island had a young son, the result of her only sexual union. Conn told her that Ireland would be saved if the boy bathed in the water of Ireland, and she agreed. He took him back to Ireland, but when the druids demanded his death, he, Art and Fionn mac Cumhaill swore to protect him. Just then, a woman driving a cow carrying two bags approached, and the cow was sacrificed instead of the boy. The bags were opened: one contained a bird with one leg, the other a bird with twelve legs. The two birds fought, and the one-legged bird won. The woman said the twelve-legged bird represented the druids, and the one-legged bird the boy, and revealed herself as his mother. She told Conn that the famine would end if he would put B\u00e9 Chuille away, but he refused. B\u00e9 Chuille was later banished from Tara as the result of a series of challenges she and Art made each other over a game of ''[[fidchell]]''.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/art.html \"The Adventures of Art son of Conn\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 491\u2013502</ref>\n\n===Death===\n\nConn was eventually killed by [[Tipraite T\u00edrech]], king of the [[Ulaid]].

His father, [[Cumhall]], a warrior in Conn's service, was a suitor of [[Muirne]], daughter of the druid [[Tadg mac Nuadat]], but Tadg refused his suit, so Cumhall abducted her. Conn went to war against him, and Cumhall was killed by [[Goll mac Morna]] in the Battle of Cnucha. But Muirne was already pregnant, and Tadg rejected her, ordering her to be burned. She fled to Conn, and Conn put her under the protection of Cumhall's brother-in-law Fiacal mac Conchinn. It was in Fiacal's house that she gave birth to a son, Deimne, who was later renamed Fionn.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/f01.html \"The Cause of the Battle of Cnucha\"], [[Tom Peete Cross]] & Clark Harris Slover (eds.), ''Ancient Irish Tales'', Henry Holt & Co, 1936, pp. 357\u2013359</ref> When he was ten, Fionn came to Tara put himself into Conn's service. He learned that every year at [[Samhain]], the monster [[Aillen]] would put everyone at Tara to sleep with his music, and burn down the palace with his fiery breath. Fionn killed Aillen, having kept himself awake by pressing the head of his spear to his forehead, and warded off Aillen's flame with his magical cloak, and Conn made him head of the ''[[fianna]]'' in place of Goll.<ref>Standish James O'Grady (trans.), ''[http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/colloquy_ogrady.pdf The Colloquy with the Ancients]'', In Parentheses Publications, pp. 46\u201348</ref>\n\n===Family===\nConn had two sons, [[Connla the Ruddy|Connla]] and [[Art mac Cuinn|Art]]. Connla fell in love with a fairy woman from [[Mag Mell]], and went with her to her otherworld home in her crystal boat, leaving Art alone. After that Art was known as ''\u00d3enfer'' \u2013 the \"lone\" or \"solitary\".<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/connla.html \"The Adventures of Connla the Fair\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 488\u2013490</ref> Connla's tale is told in the ''[[Echtra Condla]]''.\n\nAfter Conn's wife [[Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota]] <ref>[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095745694 \"Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota on Oxford Index\"] </ref>, daughter of Cathair M\u00f3r, died, another fairy woman, [[B\u00e9 Chuille]], was banished by the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]] to Ireland. She had fallen in love with Art from a distance and sought him out in her [[currach]], but when she met Conn and learned he was without a wife, agreed to marry him instead, on the condition that Art be banished from Tara for a year. The men of Ireland thought this unjust, and Ireland was barren during that year. The druids discovered that this was B\u00e9 Chuille's fault, and declared that the famine could be ended by the sacrifice of the son of a sinless couple in front of Tara. Conn went in search of this boy in B\u00e9 Chuille's currach. He landed on a strange island of apple-trees. The queen of the island had a young son, the result of her only sexual union. Conn told her that Ireland would be saved if the boy bathed in the water of Ireland, and she agreed. He took him back to Ireland, but when the druids demanded his death, he, Art and Fionn mac Cumhaill swore to protect him. Just then, a woman driving a cow carrying two bags approached, and the cow was sacrificed instead of the boy. The bags were opened: one contained a bird with one leg, the other a bird with twelve legs. The two birds fought, and the one-legged bird won. The woman said the twelve-legged bird represented the druids, and the one-legged bird the boy, and revealed herself as his mother. She told Conn that the famine would end if he would put B\u00e9 Chuille away, but he refused. B\u00e9 Chuille was later banished from Tara as the result of a series of challenges she and Art made each other over a game of ''[[fidchell]]''.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/art.html \"The Adventures of Art son of Conn\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 491\u2013502</ref>\n\n===Death===\n\nConn was eventually killed by [[Tipraite T\u00edrech]], king of the [[Ulaid]].

His son-in-law [[Conaire C\u00f3em]] succeeded him as High King, and Conn's son Art would later succeed him. The ''Lebor Gab\u00e1la'' synchronises Conn's reign with that of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Marcus Aurelius]] (161\u2013180). The chronology of Geoffrey Keating's ''Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn'' dates his reign to 116\u2013136, that of the ''Annals of the Four Masters'' to 122\u2013157.\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Cathair M\u00f3r]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[List of High Kings of Ireland|High King of Ireland]]|years=[[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn|LGE]] 2nd century AD<br>[[Geoffrey Keating|FFE]] AD 116\u2013136<br>[[Annals of the Four Masters|AFM]] AD 122\u2013157}}\n{{s-aft|after=[[Conaire C\u00f3em]]}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n==Family tree==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | TTM |TTM=[[Tuathal Techtmar]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!|}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | FRM | | CAM |FRM=[[Fedlimid Rechtmar]]|CAM=[[Cathair M\u00f3r]]|}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | |!|}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | CON |y| ETH |CON='''Conn C\u00e9tchathach'''|ETH=[[Eithne Th\u00e1ebfhota]]|}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | |,|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|^|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|-|-|-|.}}\n{{familytree | | MLD |~| AMC |y| ACH | | CNL | | MML |y| SDB |y| AAL | | SAR |V| CNC |MLD=[[Medb Lethderg]]|AMC=[[Art mac Cuinn]]|ACH=[[Achtan]]|CNL=Connla|MML=Macnia mac Lugdach|SAR=Saruit|AAL=[[Ailill Aulom]]|SDB=[[Sadb ingen Chuinn|Sadb]]|CNC=[[Conaire C\u00f3em]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | |!| | | | | | | |:|}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | CMA | | | | | | | | | | LMC | | EOM | | | | | | |:|CMA=[[Cormac mac Airt]]|LMC=[[Lugaid mac Con]]|EOM=[[\u00c9ogan M\u00f3r]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | |:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |:| | | | | | | |:|}}\n{{familytree | | |F|~|~|~|V|~|A|~|V|~|~|~|V|~|~|~|7| | | | | |:| | | | | | | |:|}}\n{{familytree | | CNN | | UIN | | DLR | | UIM | | AIR | | | | EOG | | | | | | DLR | |CNN=''[[Connachta]]''|UIN=''[[U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]]''|DLR=''[[*]]''|UIM=''[[U\u00ed Maine]]''|AIR=''[[Airg\u00edalla]]''|EOG=''[[Connacht Elanesse]]''}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Explanatory notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n{{Connachta}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Conn Of The Hundred Battles}}\n[[Category:Cycles of the Kings]]\n[[Category:Legendary High Kings of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Fenian Cycle]]\n", "name_user": "Cormac1cormac1", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDeath", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conn_of_the_Hundred_Battles"}

It was the second of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in warfare, the first being [[Little Boy]], and its detonation marked the third nuclear explosion in history. It was built by scientists and engineers at [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] using [[plutonium]] from the [[Hanford Site]], and it was dropped from the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] ''[[Bockscar]]'' piloted by Major [[Charles Sweeney]].\n \nThe name Fat Man refers to the early design of the bomb because it had a wide, round shape; it was also known as the Mark III. Fat Man was an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]] with a solid plutonium core. The first of that type to be detonated was the Gadget in the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] less than a month earlier on 16 July at the [[Holloman Air Force Base|Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range]] in New Mexico. Two more were detonated during the [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests at [[Bikini Atoll]] in 1946, and some 120 were produced between 1947 and 1949, when it was superseded by the [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb]]. The Fat Man was retired in 1950.\n\n==Early decisions==\n[[Robert Oppenheimer]] held conferences in Chicago in June 1942, prior to the Army taking over wartime atomic research, and in Berkeley, California, in July, at which various engineers and physicists discussed nuclear bomb design issues. They chose a [[Gun-type fission weapon|gun-type]] design in which two sub-critical masses would be brought together by firing a \"bullet\" into a \"target\".{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=42\u201344}} [[Richard C. Tolman]] suggested an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]], but the proposal attracted little interest.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=55}}\n\nThe feasibility of a plutonium bomb was questioned in 1942. [[Wallace Akers]], the director of the British \"[[Tube Alloys]]\" project, told [[James Bryant Conant]] on 14 November that [[James Chadwick]] had \"concluded that plutonium might not be a practical fissionable material for weapons because of impurities.\"{{sfn|Nichols|1987|p=64}} Conant consulted [[Ernest Lawrence]] and [[Arthur Compton]], who acknowledged that their scientists at Berkeley and Chicago respectively knew about the problem, but they could offer no ready solution. Conant informed [[Manhattan Project]] director Brigadier General [[Leslie R. Groves Jr.]], who in turn assembled a special committee consisting of Lawrence, Compton, Oppenheimer, and McMillan to examine the issue. The committee concluded that any problems could be overcome simply by requiring higher purity.{{sfn|Nichols|1987|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nOppenheimer reviewed his options in early 1943 and gave priority to the gun-type weapon,{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=55}} but he created the E-5 Group at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] under [[Seth Neddermeyer]] to investigate implosion as a hedge against the threat of pre-detonation. Implosion-type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms of explosive yield per unit mass of fissile material in the bomb, because compressed fissile materials react more rapidly and therefore more completely. Nonetheless, it was decided that the plutonium gun would receive the bulk of the research effort, since it was the project with the least amount of uncertainty involved. It was assumed that the uranium gun-type bomb could be easily adapted from it.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=87}}\n\n==Naming==\nThe gun-type and implosion-type designs were codenamed \"[[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]]\" and \"Fat Man\" respectively. These code names were created by [[Robert Serber]], a former student of Oppenheimer's who worked on the Manhattan Project. He chose them based on their design shapes; the Thin Man was a very long device, and the name came from the [[Dashiell Hammett]] detective novel ''[[The Thin Man]]'' and [[The Thin Man (film)|series of movies]]. The Fat Man was round and fat and was named after [[Sydney Greenstreet]]'s character in ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''. [[Little Boy]] came last as a variation of Thin Man.{{sfn|Serber|Crease|1998|p=104}}\n\n==Development==\nNeddermeyer discarded Serber and Tolman's initial concept of implosion as assembling a series of pieces in favor of one in which a hollow sphere was imploded by an explosive shell. He was assisted in this work by [[Hugh Bradner]], [[Charles Critchfield]], and John Streib. [[L.T.E. Thompson|L. T. E. Thompson]] was brought in as a consultant, and discussed the problem with Neddermeyer in June 1943. Thompson was skeptical that an implosion could be made sufficiently symmetric. Oppenheimer arranged for Neddermeyer and [[Edwin McMillan]] to visit the [[National Defense Research Committee]]'s Explosives Research Laboratory near the [[Experimental Mine, U.S. Bureau of Mines|laboratories]] of the [[United States Bureau of Mines|Bureau of Mines]] in [[Bruceton, Pennsylvania]] (a [[Pittsburgh]] suburb), where they spoke to [[George Kistiakowsky]] and his team. But Neddermeyer's efforts in July and August at imploding tubes to produce cylinders tended to produce objects that resembled rocks. Neddermeyer was the only person who believed that implosion was practical, and only his enthusiasm kept the project alive.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=86\u201390}}\n\n[[File:AirForceMuseum FatManReplica.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|left|alt=Fat Man Replica|Replica mockup of a ''Fat Man'' displayed in the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]], beside the ''[[Bockscar]]'' B-29 that dropped the original device \u2013 black liquid asphalt sealant was sprayed over the original bomb casing's seams, simulated on the mockup.]]\nOppenheimer brought [[John von Neumann]] to Los Alamos in September 1943 to take a fresh look at implosion. After reviewing Neddermeyer's studies, and discussing the matter with [[Edward Teller]], von Neumann suggested the use of high explosives in [[shaped charge]]s to implode a sphere, which he showed could not only result in a faster assembly of [[fissile]] material than was possible with the gun method, but which could greatly reduce the amount of material required, because of the resulting higher density.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=130\u2013133}} The idea that, under such pressures, the plutonium metal itself would be compressed came from Teller, whose knowledge of how dense metals behaved under heavy pressure was influenced by his pre-war theoretical studies of the [[Earth's core]] with [[George Gamow]].{{sfn|Teller|2001|pp=174\u2013176}} The prospect of more-efficient nuclear weapons impressed Oppenheimer, Teller, and [[Hans Bethe]], but they decided that an expert on explosives would be required. Kistiakowsky's name was immediately suggested, and Kistiakowsky was brought into the project as a consultant in October 1943.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=130\u2013133}}\n \nThe implosion project remained a backup until April 1944, when experiments by [[Emilio G. Segr\u00e8]] and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos on the newly reactor-produced [[plutonium]] from the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at [[Clinton Engineer Works|Oak Ridge]] and the [[B Reactor]] at the [[Hanford site]] showed that it contained impurities in the form of the [[isotope]] [[plutonium-240]]. This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate and radioactivity than [[plutonium-239]]. The [[cyclotron]]-produced isotopes, on which the original measurements had been made, held much lower traces of plutonium-240. Its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium appeared unavoidable. This meant that the spontaneous fission rate of the reactor plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely that it would [[predetonation|predetonate]] and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=228}} The distance required to accelerate the plutonium to speeds where predetonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber. The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was therefore implosion.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=240\u2013244}}\n\n[[File:X-Ray-Image-HE-Lens-Test-Shot.gif|thumb|Flash X-Ray images of the converging shock waves formed during a test of the high-explosive lens system.]]\nThe impracticability of a gun-type bomb using plutonium was agreed at a meeting in Los Alamos on 17 July 1944. All gun-type work in the [[Manhattan Project]] was directed at the Little Boy, enriched-uranium gun design, and the Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized, with almost all of the research focused on the problems of implosion for the Fat Man bomb.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=240\u2013244}} The idea of using shaped charges as three-dimensional [[explosive lens]]es came from [[James L. Tuck]], and was developed by von Neumann.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=163}} To overcome the difficulty of synchronizing multiple detonations, [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]] and [[Lawrence H. Johnston|Lawrence Johnston]] invented [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]s to replace the less precise [[primacord]] detonation system.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=163}} [[Robert Christy]] is credited with doing the calculations that showed how a solid subcritical sphere of plutonium could be compressed to a critical state, greatly simplifying the task, since earlier efforts had attempted the more-difficult compression of a hollow spherical shell.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=270\u2013271}} After Christy's report, the solid-plutonium core weapon was referred to as the \"[[pit (nuclear weapon)#Christy pits|Christy Gadget]]\".{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=293, 307\u2013308}}\n \nThe task of the [[metallurgist]]s was to determine how to cast plutonium into a sphere. The difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure the density of plutonium gave inconsistent results. At first contamination was believed to be the cause, but it was soon determined that there were multiple [[allotropes of plutonium]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=244\u2013245}} The brittle \u03b1 phase that exists at room temperature changes to the plastic \u03b2 phase at higher temperatures. Attention then shifted to the even more malleable \u03b4 phase that normally exists in the {{convert|300|-|450|\u00b0C|F|round=5}} range. It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with [[alpha particles]], which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then hit upon a [[plutonium\u2013gallium alloy]], which stabilized the \u03b4 phase and could be [[hot pressing|hot pressed]] into the desired spherical shape. As plutonium was found to corrode readily, the sphere was coated with nickel.{{sfn|Baker|Hecker|Harbur|1983|pp=144\u2013145}}\n\n[[File:Fat Man test unit being raised from the pit into the bomb bay of a B-29.jpg|thumb|left|A [[pumpkin bomb]] (Fat Man test unit) being raised from the pit into the bomb bay of a B-29 for bombing practice during the weeks before the attack on Nagasaki.]]\nThe size of the bomb was constrained by the available aircraft. The only Allied aircraft considered capable of carrying the Fat Man without major modification were the British [[Avro Lancaster]] and the American [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]].{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=380\u2013383}}{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=119\u2013120}}{{sfn|Groves|1962|p=254}} At the time, the B-29 represented the epitome of bomber technology with significant advantages in [[MTOW]], range, speed, flight ceiling, and survivability. Without the availability of the B-29, dropping the bomb would likely have been impossible. However, this still constrained the bomb to a maximum length of {{convert|11|ft}}, width of {{convert|5|ft}} and weight of {{convert|20000|lb}}. Removing the bomb rails allowed a maximum width of {{convert|5.5|ft}}.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\nDrop tests began in March 1944, and resulted in modifications to the [[Silverplate]] aircraft due to the weight of the bomb.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=8\u201310}} High-speed photographs revealed that the tail fins folded under the pressure, resulting in an erratic descent. Various combinations of stabilizer boxes and fins were tested on the Fat Man shape to eliminate its persistent wobble until an arrangement dubbed a \"California Parachute\", a cubical open-rear tail box outer surface with eight radial fins inside of it, four angled at 45\u00b0 and four perpendicular to the line of fall holding the outer square-fin box to the bomb's rear end, was approved.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=380\u2013383}} In drop tests in early weeks, the Fat Man missed its target by an average of {{convert|1,857|ft|m|0}}, but this was halved by June as the bombardiers became more proficient with it.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=131}}\n\nThe early Y-1222 model Fat Man was assembled with some 1,500 bolts.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=52}}{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=121}} This was superseded by the Y-1291 design in December 1944.

There were also the Y-1563 and Y-1564, which were practice bombs with no detonators at all.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=127}} The final wartime Y-1561 design was assembled with just 90 bolts.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=52}}\nOn 16 July 1945, a Y-1561 model Fat Man, known as the Gadget, was detonated in a [[nuclear weapons testing|test explosion]] at a remote site in [[New Mexico]], known as the \"[[Trinity test|Trinity]]\" test.

''Bockscar'' was flown by Major [[Charles W. Sweeney]] and his crew, with Commander [[Frederick L. Ashworth]] from Project Alberta as the weaponeer in charge of the bomb.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=32}}\n===Bombing of Nagasaki===\n\n''Bockscar'' lifted off at 03:47 on the morning of 9 August 1945, with Kokura as the primary target and Nagasaki the secondary target. The weapon was already armed, but with the green electrical safety plugs still engaged. Ashworth changed them to red after ten minutes so that Sweeney could climb to {{convert|17000|ft}} in order to get above storm clouds.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=740}} During the pre-flight inspection of ''Bockscar'', the flight engineer notified Sweeney that an inoperative fuel transfer pump made it impossible to use {{convert|640|USgal|l}} of fuel carried in a reserve tank. This fuel would still have to be carried all the way to Japan and back, consuming still more fuel. Replacing the pump would take hours; moving the Fat Man to another aircraft might take just as long and was dangerous as well, as the bomb was live. Colonel [[Paul Tibbets]] and Sweeney therefore elected to have ''Bockscar'' continue the mission.{{sfn|Sweeney|Antonucci|Antonucci|1997|pp=204\u2013205}}\n\n[[File:Nagasaki 1945 - Before and after (adjusted).jpg|thumb|right|Effects of the Fat Man's detonation on Nagasaki]]\nThe target for the bomb was the city of [[Kokura]], but it was found to be obscured by clouds and drifting smoke from fires started by a major firebombing raid by 224 B-29s on nearby [[Yahata, Fukuoka|Yahata]] the previous day. This covered 70% of the area over Kokura, obscuring the aiming point. Three bomb runs were made over the next 50 minutes, burning fuel and repeatedly exposing the aircraft to the heavy defenses of Yahata, but the bombardier was unable to drop visually. By the time of the third bomb run, Japanese anti-aircraft fire was getting close; Second Lieutenant [[Jacob Beser]] was monitoring Japanese communications, and he reported activity on the Japanese fighter direction radio bands.{{sfn|Sweeney|Antonucci|Antonucci|1997|pp=179, 213\u2013215}}\n\nSweeney then proceeded to the alternative target of Nagasaki. It was obscured by cloud, as well, and Ashworth ordered Sweeney to make a radar approach. At the last minute, however, bombardier{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=740}} Captain [[Kermit K. Beahan]]{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=32}} found a hole in the clouds. The Fat Man was dropped and exploded at 11:02 local time, following a 43-second free-fall, at an altitude of about {{convert|1,650|ft}}.{{sfn|Rhodes|1986|p=740}} There was poor visibility due to cloud cover and the bomb missed its intended detonation point by almost two miles, so the damage was somewhat less extensive than that in [[Hiroshima]].\n\nAt least 25 people were killed by the bombing at Nagasaki. A total of 60,000\u201380,000 fatalities resulted, including from long-term health effects, the strongest of which was leukemia with an attributable risk of 46% for bomb victims.<ref>[http://k1project.org/explore-health/hiroshima-and-nagasaki-the-long-term-health-effects Columbia university center for nuclear studies: Hiroshima and Nagasaki: The Long Term Health Effects] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723042220/http://k1project.org/explore-health/hiroshima-and-nagasaki-the-long-term-health-effects |date=23 July 2015 }}, updated 7/3/2014</ref> Others died later from related blast and burn injuries, and hundreds more from radiation illnesses from exposure to the bomb's initial radiation.{{sfn|Craven|Cate|1953|pp=723\u2013725}} Most of the direct deaths and injuries were among munitions or industrial workers.<ref name=\"HOG\">{{cite book |title=Nuke-Rebuke: Writers & Artists Against Nuclear Energy & Weapons (The Contemporary anthology series) |pages=22\u201329 |date=1 May 1984 |publisher=The Spirit That Moves Us Press}}</ref>\n\nMitsubishi's industrial production in the city was also severed by the attack; the dockyard would have produced at 80 percent of its full capacity within three to four months, the steelworks would have required a year to get back to substantial production, the electric works would have resumed some production within two months and been back at capacity within six months, and the arms plant would have required 15 months to return to 60 to 70 percent of former capacity.

The first was known as ''Gilda'' after [[Rita Hayworth]]'s character in the 1946 movie [[Gilda]], and it was dropped by the B-29 ''[[Big Stink (B-29)|Dave's Dream]]''; it missed its aim point by {{convert|710|yd}}. The second bomb was nicknamed ''Helen of Bikini'' and was placed without its tail fin assembly in a steel caisson made from a submarine's conning tower; it was detonated {{convert|90|ft|m|0}} beneath the landing craft ''[[USS LSM-60]]''. The two weapons yielded about {{convert|23|kt(TNT)}} each.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nThe Los Alamos Laboratory and the Army Air Forces had already commenced work on improving the design. The [[North American B-45 Tornado]], [[Convair XB-46]], [[Martin XB-48]], and [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] bombers had bomb bays sized to carry the [[Grand Slam (bomb)|Grand Slam]], which was much longer but not as wide as the Fat Man. The only American bombers that could carry the Fat Man were the B-29 and the [[Convair B-36]]. In November 1945, the Army Air Forces asked Los Alamos for 200 Fat Man bombs, but there were only two sets of plutonium cores and high-explosive assemblies at the time. The Army Air Forces wanted improvements to the design to make it easier to manufacture, assemble, handle, transport, and stockpile. The wartime [[Project W-47]] was continued, and drop tests resumed in January 1946.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=137\u2013142}}\n\nThe Mark III Mod 0 Fat Man was ordered into production in mid-1946. High explosives were manufactured by the [[Salt Wells Pilot Plant]], which had been established by the Manhattan Project as part of [[Project Camel]], and a new plant was established at the [[Iowa Army Ammunition Plant]]. Mechanical components were made or procured by the [[Rock Island Arsenal]]; electrical and mechanical components for about 50 bombs were stockpiled at Kirtland Army Air Field by August 1946, but only nine plutonium cores were available. Production of the Mod 0 ended in December 1948, by which time there were still only 53 cores available. It was replaced by improved versions known as Mods 1 and 2 which contained a number of minor changes, the most important of which was that they did not charge the X-Unit firing system's capacitors until released from the aircraft. The Mod 0s were withdrawn from service between March and July 1949, and by October they had all been rebuilt as Mods 1 and 2.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=142\u2013145}} Some 120 Mark III Fat Man units were added to the stockpile between 1947 and 1949{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=87}} when it was superseded by the [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb]].{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=143}} The Mark III Fat Man was retired in 1950.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=87}}{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=150}}\n\nA nuclear strike would have been a formidable undertaking in the post-war 1940s due to the limitations of the Mark III Fat Man. The lead-acid batteries which powered the fuzing system remained charged for only 36 hours, after which they needed to be recharged. To do this meant disassembling the bomb, and recharging took 72 hours. The batteries had to be removed in any case after nine days or they corroded. The plutonium core could not be left in for much longer, because its heat damaged the high explosives. Replacing the core also required the bomb to be completely disassembled and reassembled. This required about 40 to 50 men and took between 56 and 72 hours, depending on the skill of the bomb assembly team, and the [[Armed Forces Special Weapons Project]] had only three teams in June 1948. The only aircraft capable of carrying the bomb were Silverplate B-29s, and the only group equipped with them was the 509th Bombardment Group at [[Walker Air Force Base]] in [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. They would first have to fly to [[Sandia Base]] to collect the bombs, and then to an overseas base from which a strike could be mounted.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=147\u2013149}}\n\nThe Soviet Union's first nuclear weapon was based closely on Fat Man's design thanks to spies [[Klaus Fuchs]], [[Theodore Hall]], and [[David Greenglass]], who provided them with secret information concerning the Manhattan Project and Fat Man.

It was the second of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in warfare, the first being [[Little Boy]], and its detonation marked the third nuclear explosion in history. It was built by scientists and engineers at [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] using [[plutonium]] from the [[Hanford Site]], and it was dropped from the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] ''[[Bockscar]]'' piloted by Major [[Charles Sweeney]].\n \nThe name Fat Man refers to the early design of the bomb because it had a wide, round shape; it was also known as the Mark III. Fat Man was an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]] with a solid plutonium core. The first of that type to be detonated was the Gadget in the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] less than a month earlier on 16 July at the [[Holloman Air Force Base|Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range]] in New Mexico. Two more were detonated during the [[Operation Crossroads]] nuclear tests at [[Bikini Atoll]] in 1946, and some 120 were produced between 1947 and 1949, when it was superseded by the [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb]]. The Fat Man was retired in 1950.\n\n==Early decisions==\n[[Robert Oppenheimer]] held conferences in Chicago in June 1942, prior to the Army taking over wartime atomic research, and in Berkeley, California, in July, at which various engineers and physicists discussed nuclear bomb design issues. They chose a [[Gun-type fission weapon|gun-type]] design in which two sub-critical masses would be brought together by firing a \"bullet\" into a \"target\".{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=42\u201344}} [[Richard C. Tolman]] suggested an [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]], but the proposal attracted little interest.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=55}}\n\nThe feasibility of a plutonium bomb was questioned in 1942. [[Wallace Akers]], the director of the British \"[[Tube Alloys]]\" project, told [[James Bryant Conant]] on 14 November that [[James Chadwick]] had \"concluded that plutonium might not be a practical fissionable material for weapons because of impurities.\"{{sfn|Nichols|1987|p=64}} Conant consulted [[Ernest Lawrence]] and [[Arthur Compton]], who acknowledged that their scientists at Berkeley and Chicago respectively knew about the problem, but they could offer no ready solution. Conant informed [[Manhattan Project]] director Brigadier General [[Leslie R. Groves Jr.]], who in turn assembled a special committee consisting of Lawrence, Compton, Oppenheimer, and McMillan to examine the issue. The committee concluded that any problems could be overcome simply by requiring higher purity.{{sfn|Nichols|1987|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nOppenheimer reviewed his options in early 1943 and gave priority to the gun-type weapon,{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=55}} but he created the E-5 Group at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] under [[Seth Neddermeyer]] to investigate implosion as a hedge against the threat of pre-detonation. Implosion-type bombs were determined to be significantly more efficient in terms of explosive yield per unit mass of fissile material in the bomb, because compressed fissile materials react more rapidly and therefore more completely. Nonetheless, it was decided that the plutonium gun would receive the bulk of the research effort, since it was the project with the least amount of uncertainty involved. It was assumed that the uranium gun-type bomb could be easily adapted from it.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=87}}\n\n==Naming==\nThe gun-type and implosion-type designs were codenamed \"[[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]]\" and \"Fat Man\" respectively. These code names were created by [[Robert Serber]], a former student of Oppenheimer's who worked on the Manhattan Project. He chose them based on their design shapes; the Thin Man was a very long device, and the name came from the [[Dashiell Hammett]] detective novel ''[[The Thin Man]]'' and [[The Thin Man (film)|series of movies]]. The Fat Man was round and fat and was named after [[Sydney Greenstreet]]'s character in ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''. [[Little Boy]] came last as a variation of Thin Man.{{sfn|Serber|Crease|1998|p=104}}\n\n==Development==\nNeddermeyer discarded Serber and Tolman's initial concept of implosion as assembling a series of pieces in favor of one in which a hollow sphere was imploded by an explosive shell. He was assisted in this work by [[Hugh Bradner]], [[Charles Critchfield]], and John Streib. [[L.T.E. Thompson|L. T. E. Thompson]] was brought in as a consultant, and discussed the problem with Neddermeyer in June 1943. Thompson was skeptical that an implosion could be made sufficiently symmetric. Oppenheimer arranged for Neddermeyer and [[Edwin McMillan]] to visit the [[National Defense Research Committee]]'s Explosives Research Laboratory near the [[Experimental Mine, U.S. Bureau of Mines|laboratories]] of the [[United States Bureau of Mines|Bureau of Mines]] in [[Bruceton, Pennsylvania]] (a [[Pittsburgh]] suburb), where they spoke to [[George Kistiakowsky]] and his team. But Neddermeyer's efforts in July and August at imploding tubes to produce cylinders tended to produce objects that resembled rocks. Neddermeyer was the only person who believed that implosion was practical, and only his enthusiasm kept the project alive.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=86\u201390}}\n\n[[File:AirForceMuseum FatManReplica.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|left|alt=Fat Man Replica|Replica mockup of a ''Fat Man'' displayed in the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]], beside the ''[[Bockscar]]'' B-29 that dropped the original device \u2013 black liquid asphalt sealant was sprayed over the original bomb casing's seams, simulated on the mockup.]]\nOppenheimer brought [[John von Neumann]] to Los Alamos in September 1943 to take a fresh look at implosion. After reviewing Neddermeyer's studies, and discussing the matter with [[Edward Teller]], von Neumann suggested the use of high explosives in [[shaped charge]]s to implode a sphere, which he showed could not only result in a faster assembly of [[fissile]] material than was possible with the gun method, but which could greatly reduce the amount of material required, because of the resulting higher density.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=130\u2013133}} The idea that, under such pressures, the plutonium metal itself would be compressed came from Teller, whose knowledge of how dense metals behaved under heavy pressure was influenced by his pre-war theoretical studies of the [[Earth's core]] with [[George Gamow]].{{sfn|Teller|2001|pp=174\u2013176}} The prospect of more-efficient nuclear weapons impressed Oppenheimer, Teller, and [[Hans Bethe]], but they decided that an expert on explosives would be required. Kistiakowsky's name was immediately suggested, and Kistiakowsky was brought into the project as a consultant in October 1943.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=130\u2013133}}\n \nThe implosion project remained a backup until April 1944, when experiments by [[Emilio G. Segr\u00e8]] and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos on the newly reactor-produced [[plutonium]] from the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at [[Clinton Engineer Works|Oak Ridge]] and the [[B Reactor]] at the [[Hanford site]] showed that it contained impurities in the form of the [[isotope]] [[plutonium-240]]. This has a far higher spontaneous fission rate and radioactivity than [[plutonium-239]]. The [[cyclotron]]-produced isotopes, on which the original measurements had been made, held much lower traces of plutonium-240. Its inclusion in reactor-bred plutonium appeared unavoidable. This meant that the spontaneous fission rate of the reactor plutonium was so high that it would be highly likely that it would [[predetonation|predetonate]] and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=228}} The distance required to accelerate the plutonium to speeds where predetonation would be less likely would need a gun barrel too long for any existing or planned bomber. The only way to use plutonium in a workable bomb was therefore implosion.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=240\u2013244}}\n\n[[File:X-Ray-Image-HE-Lens-Test-Shot.gif|thumb|Flash X-Ray images of the converging shock waves formed during a test of the high-explosive lens system.]]\nThe impracticability of a gun-type bomb using plutonium was agreed at a meeting in Los Alamos on 17 July 1944. All gun-type work in the [[Manhattan Project]] was directed at the Little Boy, enriched-uranium gun design, and the Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized, with almost all of the research focused on the problems of implosion for the Fat Man bomb.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=240\u2013244}} The idea of using shaped charges as three-dimensional [[explosive lens]]es came from [[James L.

The difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure the density of plutonium gave inconsistent results. At first contamination was believed to be the cause, but it was soon determined that there were multiple [[allotropes of plutonium]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=244\u2013245}} The brittle \u03b1 phase that exists at room temperature changes to the plastic \u03b2 phase at higher temperatures.

It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with [[alpha particles]], which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then hit upon a [[plutonium\u2013gallium alloy]], which stabilized the \u03b4 phase and could be [[hot pressing|hot pressed]] into the desired spherical shape.

The wartime [[Project W-47]] was continued, and drop tests resumed in January 1946.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=137\u2013142}}\n\nThe Mark III Mod 0 Fat Man was ordered into production in mid-1946. High explosives were manufactured by the [[Salt Wells Pilot Plant]], which had been established by the Manhattan Project as part of [[Project Camel]], and a new plant was established at the [[Iowa Army Ammunition Plant]]. Mechanical components were made or procured by the [[Rock Island Arsenal]]; electrical and mechanical components for about 50 bombs were stockpiled at Kirtland Army Air Field by August 1946, but only nine plutonium cores were available. Production of the Mod 0 ended in December 1948, by which time there were still only 53 cores available. It was replaced by improved versions known as Mods 1 and 2 which contained a number of minor changes, the most important of which was that they did not charge the X-Unit firing system's capacitors until released from the aircraft. The Mod 0s were withdrawn from service between March and July 1949, and by October they had all been rebuilt as Mods 1 and 2.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=142\u2013145}} Some 120 Mark III Fat Man units were added to the stockpile between 1947 and 1949{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=87}} when it was superseded by the [[Mark 4 nuclear bomb]].{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=143}} The Mark III Fat Man was retired in 1950.{{sfn|Coster-Mullen|2012|p=87}}{{sfn|Hansen|1995|p=150}}\n\nA nuclear strike would have been a formidable undertaking in the post-war 1940s due to the limitations of the Mark III Fat Man. The lead-acid batteries which powered the fuzing system remained charged for only 36 hours, after which they needed to be recharged. To do this meant disassembling the bomb, and recharging took 72 hours. The batteries had to be removed in any case after nine days or they corroded. The plutonium core could not be left in for much longer, because its heat damaged the high explosives. Replacing the core also required the bomb to be completely disassembled and reassembled. This required about 40 to 50 men and took between 56 and 72 hours, depending on the skill of the bomb assembly team, and the [[Armed Forces Special Weapons Project]] had only three teams in June 1948. The only aircraft capable of carrying the bomb were Silverplate B-29s, and the only group equipped with them was the 509th Bombardment Group at [[Walker Air Force Base]] in [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. They would first have to fly to [[Sandia Base]] to collect the bombs, and then to an overseas base from which a strike could be mounted.{{sfn|Hansen|1995|pp=147\u2013149}}\n\nThe Soviet Union's first nuclear weapon was based closely on Fat Man's design thanks to spies [[Klaus Fuchs]], [[Theodore Hall]], and [[David Greenglass]], who provided them with secret information concerning the Manhattan Project and Fat Man. It was detonated on 29 August 1949 as part of [[RDS-1|Operation \"First Lightning\"]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/spies-who-spilled-atomic-bomb-secrets-127922660/|title=Spies Who Spilled Atomic Bomb Secrets|magazine=Smithsonian |first=        Marian Smith |last=Holmes |date=19 April 2009 |access-date=5 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Holloway |first1=David |year=1993 |title=Soviet Scientists Speak Out |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |volume=49 |issue=4 |pages=18\u201319 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQwAAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq8.html#nfaq8.1.1 |title=Section 8.1.1 The Design of Gadget, Fat Man, and \"Joe 1\" (RDS-1)|first=Carey|last=Sublette |date=3 July 2007 |work=Nuclear Weapons FAQ |accessdate=12 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |last=Baker |first=Richard D. |last2=Hecker |first2=Siegfried S. |last3=Harbur |first3=Delbert R.|title=Plutonium: A Wartime Nightmare but a Metallurgist's Dream |url=http://library.lanl.gov/cgi-bin/getfile?07-16.pdf |journal=[[Los Alamos Science]] |issue=Winter/Spring |year=1983 |pages=142\u2013151 |access-date=22 November 2010|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Richard H. |year=2005 |title=The Silverplate Bombers: A History and Registry of the Enola Gay and Other B-29s Configured to Carry Atomic Bombs |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |publisher=McFarland & Company |isbn= 978-0-7864-2139-8 |oclc=58554961 |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Coster-Mullen |first=John |title=Atom Bombs: The Top Secret Inside Story of Little Boy and Fat Man |location=Waukesha, Wisconsin |publisher=J.

Daoud Khan's irredentist foreign policy to reunite the Pashtun homeland caused much tension with Pakistan, a nation that allied itself with the United States. Daoud Khan's irredentist policy was fueled by his desire to unite his divided country. To unite his divided country, Daoud Khan started emulating policies of Emir [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] and for that he needed a popular cause (a Pashtun homeland) to unite the Afghan people divided along the tribal lines and a modern, well equipped Afghan army which would be used to surpass anyone who would oppose the Afghan government.<ref name=\"unite\"/> Daoud Khan's policy to annex Pashtun areas of Pakistan had also angered Non-Pashtun population of Afghanistan.<ref name=\"abcclio\"/> Similarly, Pashtun population in Pakistan were also not interested in having their areas being annexed by Afghanistan.<ref name=\"unhappy\"/> In 1951, the United States's State Department urged Afghanistan to drop its claim against Pakistan and accept the Durrand Line.<ref>Rubin, Barnett R.

Despite reaching this agreement with Taraki, the Soviets continued to be reluctant to intervene further in Afghanistan and repeatedly refused Soviet military intervention within Afghan borders during Taraki's rule as well as later during Amin's short rule.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rasanayagam, Angelo|title=Afghanistan: A Modern History|publisher=[[I.B.Tauris]]|year=2005|isbn=978-1-85043-857-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/afghanistan00ange/page/86 86\u201388]|url=https://archive.org/details/afghanistan00ange/page/86}}</ref>\n\n===Initiation of the insurgency===\n{{Main|Soviet Union\u2013United States relations|Pakistan\u2013Soviet Union relations}} {{See also|Adolph Dubs|l1=Kidnapping and assassination of U.S. Ambassador Adolph Dubs}}\n[[File:\u0410\u0413\u0421-17 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043b\u0451\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u043d\u0435\u043c \u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044f \u0413\u0410\u0417-66.jpeg|thumb|left|Soviet infantry at the time of deployment]]\n\nAfghanistan, under the regime of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], had hostile relations with both [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=giwiAwAAQBAJ&q=To+change+the+attitude+of+Daoud+Khan+who+was+known+to+be+pro-Moscow%2C+anti-Shah+and+anti-Pakistan#v=snippet&q=To%20change%20the%20attitude%20of%20Daoud%20Khan%20who%20was%20known%20to%20be%20pro-Moscow%2C%20anti-Shah%20and%20anti-Pakistan&f=false|title=The Middle East in World Politics (Routledge Revivals)|last=Ayoob|first=Mohammed|publisher=Routledge|page=147|date=2014|isbn=9781317811282}}</ref><ref name=\"unite\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC|title=Afghanistan's Two-Party Communism: Parcham and Khalq|last=Arnold|first=Anthony|pages=12, 45|isbn=9780817977931}}</ref> Like all previous Afghan rulers since 1901, Daoud Khan also wanted to emulate Emir [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] and unite his divided country.

Supposedly, two of Amin's guards killed the former president Nur Muhammad Taraki with a pillow, and Amin, himself, was suspected to be a CIA agent. The latter, however, is still disputed with Amin repeatedly demonstrating friendliness toward the various delegates of the Soviet Union who would arrive in Afghanistan. Soviet General [[Vasily Zaplatin]], a political advisor of [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] Brezhnev at the time, claimed that four of President Taraki's ministers were responsible for the destabilization.

However, as the situation continued to deteriorate from May\u2013December 1979, Moscow changed its mind on dispatching Soviet troops.  The reasons for this complete turnabout are not entirely clear, and several speculative arguments include: the grave internal situation and inability for the Afghan government; the effects of the [[Iranian Revolution]] that brought an Islamic theocracy into power, leading to fears that religious fanaticism would spread through Afghanistan and into Soviet Muslim Central Asian republics; Taraki's murder and replacement by Amin, who the Soviets feared could become aligned with the Americans and provide them with a new strategic position after the loss of Iran; and the deteriorating ties with the United States after [[NATO Double-Track Decision|NATO's two-track missile deployment decision]] and the failure of Congress to ratify the [[SALT II]] treaty, creating the impression that d\u00e9tente was \"already effectively dead.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/e-dossier_4.pdf |title=Documents on the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan e-Dossier No. 4. |date=November 2001 |website= |publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars |accessdate=17 April 2016}}</ref> The British journalist Patrick Brogan wrote in 1989: \"The simplest explanation is probably the best.

The Soviets would bomb villages that were near sites of guerrilla attacks on Soviet convoys or known to support resistance groups. Local peoples were forced to either flee their homes or die as daily Soviet attacks made it impossible to live in these areas. By forcing the people of Afghanistan to flee their homes, the Soviets hoped to deprive the guerrillas of resources and safe havens. The second strategy consisted of subversion, which entailed sending spies to join resistance groups and report information as well as bribing local tribes or guerrilla leaders into ceasing operations. Finally, the Soviets used military forays into contested territories in an effort to root out the [[guerrillas]] and limit their options. Classic [[search and destroy]] operations were implemented using [[Mil Mi-24]] helicopter gunships that would provide cover for ground forces in armored vehicles. Once the villages were occupied by Soviet forces, inhabitants who remained were frequently interrogated and tortured for information or killed.<ref name=\"Report from Afghanistan\">[http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/afghan/report.pdf Report from Afghanistan] Claude Malhuret</ref>\n\n[[File:Afghan village destroyed by the Soviets.jpg|thumb|An Afghan village left in ruins after being destroyed by [[Soviet Armed Forces|Soviet forces]]]]\n\nTo complement their brute force approach to weeding out the [[insurgency]], the Soviets used [[KHAD]] (Afghan secret police) to gather intelligence, infiltrate the mujahideen, spread false information, bribe tribal militias into fighting and organize a government [[militia]].

Perhaps the most notable of these groups was the [[Liberation Organization of the People of Afghanistan]] (SAMA), which launched skilled guerilla attacks and controlled some territory north of Kabul in the early years of the war. The Maoist resistance eventually lost its pace and was severely weakened following the deaths of leaders [[Faiz Ahmad]] and [[Mulavi Dawood]] in 1986, both committed by the [[Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin]] mujahideen faction.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[File:Afghanistan insurgency 1985.png|thumb|left|The areas where the different mujahideen forces operated in 1985]]\n\nIn the course of the guerrilla war, leadership came to be distinctively associated with the title of \"commander\". It applied to independent leaders, eschewing identification with elaborate military [[bureaucracy]] associated with such ranks as general. As the war produced leaders of reputation, \"commander\" was conferred on leaders of fighting units of all sizes, signifying pride in independence, self-sufficiency, and distinct ties to local communities. The title epitomized Afghan pride in their struggle against a powerful foe. Segmentation of power and religious leadership were the two values evoked by nomenclature generated in the war. Neither had been favored in the ideology of the former Afghan state.\n\nAfghanistan's resistance movement was born in chaos, spread and triumphed chaotically, and did not find a way to govern differently. Virtually all of its war was waged locally by regional [[warlord]]s. As warfare became more sophisticated, outside support and regional coordination grew. Even so, the basic units of mujahideen organization and action continued to reflect the highly segmented nature of Afghan society.<ref name=\"loc1\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0101) The Path to Victory and Chaos: 1979\u201392 \u2013 Library of Congress country studies](Retrieved Thursday 31, 2007)</ref>\n\n[[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]] estimates that after four years of war, there were at least 4,000 bases from which mujahideen units operated. Most of these were affiliated with the seven expatriate parties headquartered in Pakistan, which served as sources of supply and varying degrees of supervision. Significant commanders typically led 300 or more men, controlled several bases and dominated a district or a sub-division of a province. Hierarchies of organization above the bases were attempted. Their operations varied greatly in scope, the most ambitious being achieved by [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] of the [[Panjshir valley]] north of [[Kabul]]. He led at least 10,000 trained troopers at the end of the Soviet war and had expanded his political control of [[Tajiks|Tajik]]-dominated areas to Afghanistan's northeastern provinces under the Supervisory Council of the North.<ref name=\"loc1\" />\n[[File:August 1985 Muja.jpg|thumb|Three mujahideen in [[Asmar]], 1985]]\n\nRoy also describes regional, ethnic and sectarian variations in mujahideen organization. In the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] areas of the east, south and southwest, tribal structure, with its many rival sub-divisions, provided the basis for military organization and leadership. Mobilization could be readily linked to traditional fighting allegiances of the tribal ''lashkar'' (fighting force). In favorable circumstances such formations could quickly reach more than 10,000, as happened when large Soviet assaults were launched in the eastern provinces, or when the mujahideen besieged towns, such as [[Khost]] in [[Paktia]] province in July 1983.<ref>The siege was ended only in November 1987 through the conduct of Operation Magistal'</ref> But in campaigns of the latter type the traditional explosions of manpower\u2014customarily common immediately after the completion of harvest\u2014proved obsolete when confronted by well dug-in defenders with modern weapons. Lashkar durability was notoriously short; few sieges succeeded.<ref name=\"loc1\"/>\n\nMujahideen mobilization in non-Pashtun regions faced very different obstacles. Prior to the intervention, few non-Pashtuns possessed firearms. Early in the war they were most readily available from army troops or [[gendarmerie]] who defected or were ambushed. The international arms market and foreign military support tended to reach the minority areas last. In the northern regions, little military tradition had survived upon which to build an armed resistance. Mobilization mostly came from political leadership closely tied to Islam. Roy contrasts the social leadership of religious figures in the [[Persian language|Persian]]- and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking regions of Afghanistan with that of the Pashtuns. Lacking a strong political representation in a state dominated by Pashtuns, minority communities commonly looked to pious learned or charismatically revered ''[[pir (Sufism)|pirs]]'' (saints) for leadership. Extensive [[Sufi]] and [[maraboutic]] networks were spread through the minority communities, readily available as foundations for leadership, organization, communication and indoctrination. These networks also provided for political mobilization, which led to some of the most effective of the resistance operations during the war.<ref name=\"loc1\" />\n\nThe mujahideen favoured [[sabotage]] operations. The more common types of sabotage included damaging [[electric power transmission|power lines]], knocking out [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and radio stations, blowing up government [[office building]]s, [[air terminal]]s, hotels, cinemas, and so on. In the border region with Pakistan, the mujahideen would often launch 800 [[rocket]]s per day. Between April 1985 and January 1987, they carried out over 23,500 [[shell (projectile)|shelling]] attacks on government targets. The mujahideen surveyed firing positions that they normally located near villages within the range of Soviet artillery posts, putting the villagers in danger of death from Soviet retaliation. The mujahideen used [[land mines]] heavily. Often, they would enlist the services of the local inhabitants, even children.\n[[File:Mujahideen prayer in Shultan Valley Kunar, 1987.jpg|thumb|Mujahideen praying in Shultan Valley, 1987]]\n\nThey concentrated on both civilian and military targets, knocking out bridges, closing major roads, attacking [[convoy]]s, disrupting the electric power system and industrial production, and attacking police stations and Soviet military installations and air bases. They assassinated government officials and PDPA members, and laid siege to small rural outposts. In March 1982, a bomb exploded at the [[Ministry (government department)|Ministry]] of Education, damaging several buildings. In the same month, a widespread [[power failure]] darkened Kabul when a pylon on the transmission line from the Naghlu power station was blown up. In June 1982 a column of about 1,000 young [[communist party]] members sent out to work in the Panjshir valley were ambushed within 30&nbsp;km of Kabul, with heavy loss of life. On September 4, 1985, insurgents shot down a domestic Bakhtar Airlines plane as it took off from Kandahar airport, killing all 52 people aboard.\n\nMujahideen groups used for assassination had three to five men in each. After they received their mission to kill certain government officials, they busied themselves with studying his pattern of life and its details and then selecting the method of fulfilling their established mission. They practiced shooting at automobiles, [[drive by|shooting out of automobiles]], laying mines in government accommodation or houses, using poison, and rigging explosive charges in transport.\n\nIn May 1985, the seven principal rebel organizations formed the [[Seven Party Mujahideen Alliance]] to coordinate their military operations against the Soviet army. Late in 1985, the groups were active in and around Kabul, unleashing rocket attacks and conducting operations against the communist government.\n\n===Media reaction===\n{{quote box |align=right|width=30%|quote = Those hopelessly brave warriors I walked with, and their families, who suffered so much for faith and freedom and who are still not free, they were truly the people of God. \u2013 Journalist [[Rob Schultheis]], 1992<ref>Schultheis, Rob. \"Night Letters Inside Wartime Afghanistan\", 1992. p. 155</ref><ref name=\"pete\">[[Peter Bergen|Bergen, Peter]], ''[[Holy War, Inc.]]'', 2001</ref>}}\n\nInternational journalistic perception of the war varied.

Kaplan note that \"none of the American TV networks had a bureau for a war\",{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=10}} and television cameramen venturing to follow the mujahideen \"trekked for weeks on little food, only to return ill and half starved\".{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=14}} In October 1984 the Soviet ambassador to Pakistan, Vitaly Smirnov, told [[Agence France Presse]] \"that journalists traveling with the mujahidin 'will be killed.

During this phase, the Soviet contingent was restricted to supporting the DRA forces by providing [[artillery]], air support and technical assistance, though some large-scale operations were still carried out by Soviet troops.\n\nUnder Soviet guidance, the DRA armed forces were built up to an official strength of 302,000 in 1986. To minimize the risk of a coup d'\u00e9tat, they were divided into different branches, each modeled on its Soviet counterpart. The ministry of defence forces numbered 132,000, the ministry of interior 70,000 and the ministry of state security ([[KHAD]]) 80,000. However, these were theoretical figures: in reality each service was plagued with [[desertion]]s, the army alone suffering 32,000 per year.\n\nThe decision to engage primarily Afghan forces was taken by the Soviets, but was resented by the PDPA, who viewed the departure of their protectors without enthusiasm. In May 1987 a DRA force attacked well-entrenched mujahideen positions in the [[Arghandab District]], but the mujahideen held their ground, and the attackers suffered heavy casualties.<ref>Urban, ''War in Afghanistan'', p. 219</ref> In the spring of 1986, an offensive into [[Paktia Province]] briefly occupied the mujahideen base at [[Battles of Zhawar|Zhawar]] only at the cost of heavy losses.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grau |first=Lester |authorlink2=Ali Ahmad Jalali|last2=Jalali |first2=Ali Ahmad|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2001/010900-zhawar.htm|title=The campaign for the caves: the battles for Zhawar in the Soviet-Afghan War|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=March 29, 2007}}</ref> Meanwhile, the mujahideen benefited from expanded foreign military support from the United States, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and other Muslim nations.

Gorbachev had been attempting to remove the Soviet Union from the economic stagnation that had set in under the leadership of Brezhnev, and to reform the Soviet Union's economy and image with the [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]] policies. Gorbachev had also been attempting to ease cold war tensions by signing the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] with the U.S. in 1987 and withdrawing the troops from Afghanistan, whose presence had garnered so much international condemnation. Gorbachev regarded confrontation with China and resulting military build ups on that border as one of Brezhnev's biggest mistakes.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Beijing had stipulated that a normalization of relations would have to wait until Moscow withdrew its army from Afghanistan (among other things), and in 1989 the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years took place.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Maley, William  |author2=Saikal, Amin |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=127}}</ref> At the same time, Gorbachev pressured his Cuban allies in Angola to scale down activities and withdraw even though Soviet allies were faring somewhat better there.<ref>{{cite book|last=Urban, Mark|title=War in Afghanistan|year=1990|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page= 300}}</ref> The Soviets also pulled many of their troops out of [[Mongolia]] in 1987, where they were also having a far easier time than in Afghanistan, and restrained the [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War|Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea]] to the point of an all out withdrawal in 1988.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Maley, William  |author2=Saikal, Amin |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=132}}</ref> This massive withdrawal of Soviet forces from such highly contested areas shows that the Soviet government's decision to leave Afghanistan was based upon a general change in Soviet foreign policy \u2013 from one of confrontation to avoidance of conflict wherever possible.\n\nIn the last phase, Soviet troops prepared and executed their withdrawal from Afghanistan, whilst limiting the launching of offensive operations by those who hadn't withdrawn yet.\n\nBy mid-1987 the Soviet Union announced that it would start withdrawing its forces. [[Sibghatullah Mojaddedi]] was selected as the head of the Interim Islamic State of Afghanistan, in an attempt to reassert its legitimacy against the Moscow-sponsored Kabul regime. Mojaddedi, as head of the Interim Afghan Government, met with then Vice President of the United States [[George H. W. Bush]], achieving a critical diplomatic victory for the Afghan resistance. Defeat of the Kabul government was their solution for peace. This confidence, sharpened by their distrust of the United Nations, virtually guaranteed their refusal to accept a political compromise.\n\nIn September 1988, Soviet MiG-23 fighters shot down two Iranian [[Bell AH-1 SuperCobra|AH-1J Cobra]], which had intruded in Afghan airspace.<ref>\"The Aviation History\", Florian Ion Petrescu, Relly Victoria Petrescu, 2012, p. 82</ref>\n\n''[[Operation Magistral]]'' was one of the final offensive operations undertaken by the Soviets, a successful sweep operation that cleared the road between [[Gardez]] and [[Khost]].

It was weakened by divisions within the PDPA and the Parcham faction, and the regime's efforts to expand its base of support proved futile. Moscow came to regard Karmal as a failure and blamed him for the problems. Years later, when Karmal's inability to consolidate his government had become obvious, Mikhail Gorbachev, then General Secretary of the [[Soviet Communist Party]], said, \"The main reason that there has been no national consolidation so far is that Comrade Karmal is hoping to continue sitting in Kabul with our help.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:RIAN archive 644461 First stage in the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|A column of Soviet BTR armored personnel carriers departing from Afghanistan.]]\n\nIn November 1986, [[Mohammad Najibullah]], former chief of the Afghan [[secret police]] ([[KHAD]]), was elected president and a new constitution was adopted.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} He also introduced in 1987 a policy of \"national reconciliation,\" devised by experts of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], and later used in other regions of the world.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Despite high expectations, the new policy neither made the Moscow-backed Kabul regime more popular, nor did it convince the insurgents to negotiate with the ruling government.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nInformal negotiations for a Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan had been underway since 1982.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In 1988, the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan, with the United States and Soviet Union serving as guarantors, signed an agreement settling the major differences between them known as the [[Geneva Accords (1988)|Geneva Accords]]. The United Nations set up a special [[United Nations Good Offices Mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan|Mission]] to oversee the process. In this way, Najibullah had stabilized his political position enough to begin matching Moscow's moves toward withdrawal. On July 20, 1987, the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country was announced. The withdrawal of Soviet forces was planned out by Lt. Gen. [[Boris Gromov]], who, at the time, was the commander of the [[40th Army]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nAmong other things the Geneva accords identified the US and Soviet non-intervention in the internal affairs of Pakistan and Afghanistan and a timetable for full Soviet withdrawal.

In order to counter the Soviet jets, United States started providing F-16 jets to Pakistan.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/> These F-16 jets lacked the capability to fire radar-guided beyond-visual range missiles and thus required to get close to their opponents in order to use their AIM-9P and more advanced AIM-9L Sidewinder heat-seeking or their 20-millimeter Vulcan cannons. On 17 May 1986, two Pakistan Air Force (PAF) F-16 intercepted two [[Sukhoi Su-17|Su-22M3K]] belonging to Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Air Force (DRAAF) near the Pakistani airspace.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/> Pakistani officials insisted that both the fighter jets belonging to DRAAF were shot down while Afghan officials confirmed loss of only one fighter jet. Following the engagement, there was major decline in the number of attacks on Afghan refugees camps in Pakistan. On 16 April 1987, a group of PAF F-16s again chased down two DRAAF Su-22 and managed to shoot down one of them and capture its pilot.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/> In the year 1987, Soviet Union reported that Pakistani fighter jets were roaming in Afghan airspace, harassing attempts to aerial resupply the besieged garrisons like the one in [[Khost province|Khost]]. On 30 March 1987, two PAF F-16s shot down an [[Antonov An-26|An-26]] cargo plane, killing all 39 personnel on board the aircraft. In the coming years, PAF claimed credit for shooting down several Mi-8 transports helicopter, another An-26 which was on a reconnaissance mission in 1989.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/> In the year 1987, two PAF F-16 ambushed four [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|Mig-23]] who were bombing Mujahideen supply bases. In the clash, one PAF F-16 was lost after it was accidentally hit by an AIM-9 Sidewinder fired by the second PAF F-16. The PAF pilot landed in Afghanistan territory and was smuggled back to Pakistan along with wreckage of his aircraft by the Mujahideen. However, some Russian sources claim that F-16 was shot down by Mig-23, though the Russian Mig-23 were not carrying air-to-air missiles.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/>\n\nOn 8 August 1988, Colonel [[Alexander Rutskoy]] was leading a group of [[Sukhoi Su-25]] fighter jets to attack a refugee camp in [[Miramshah]], Pakistan.

A month later, around twelve [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|Mig-23]] crossed into Pakistani airspace with the aim to lure ambush the Pakistani F-16s. Two PAF F-16s flew towards the Soviet fighter jets.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/> The Soviet radars failed to detect the low flying F-16s and the sidewinder fired by one of F-16 damaged one of the Mig-23. However, the damaged Mig-23 managed to reach back home. Two Mig-23 engaged the two PAF F-16s. The Pakistani officials state that both the Mig-23 were shot down. However, Soviet records show that no additional aircraft was lost on that day. The last aerial engagement took place on 3 November 1988. One Su-2M4K belonging to DRAAF was shot down by Pakistani airforce jet.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/>\n\nDuring the conflict, Pakistan Air Force F-16 had shot down ten aircraft, belonging to Soviet Union, which had intruded into Pakistani territory. However, the Soviet record only confirmed five kills (three Su-22s, one Su-25 and one An-26). Some sources show that PAF had shot down at least a dozen more aircraft during the war. However, those kills were not officially acknowledged because they took place in Afghanistan's airspace and acknowledging those kills would mean that Afghan airspace was violated by PAF.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\">{{cite web|url=https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/pakistan%E2%80%99s-f-16s-battled-soviet-jets%E2%80%94and-shot-down-future-vice-president-russia-47717|title=Pakistan's F-16s Battled Soviet Jets\u2014and Shot Down the Future Vice President of Russia|date=16 March 2019|work=National Interest|last=Roblin|first=Sebastian|accessdate=20 December 2019}}</ref> In all, Pakistan Air Force F-16 had downed several MiG-23s, Su-22s, an Su-25, and an An-24 while lost only one F-16.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=88JvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=PAF%20F-16s%20downed%20several%20MiG-23s%2C%20Su-22s%2C%20an%20Su-25%2C%20and%20an%20An-24.&f=false|title=Air Warfare in the Missile Age|last=Nordeen|first=Lon O.|accessdate=20 December 2019|publisher=Smithsonian Institution, 2010|page=170|isbn=9781588342829|year=2010}}</ref>\n\n==Atrocities==\n\n===Massacres===\nAmerican professor [[Samuel Totten]],<ref name=Totten/> Australian professor [[Paul R.

China and Afghanistan had neutral relations with each other during the King's rule. When the pro-Soviet Afghan Communists seized power in Afghanistan in 1978, relations between China and the Afghan communists quickly turned hostile. The Afghan pro-Soviet communists supported China's then-enemy Vietnam and blamed China for supporting Afghan anti-communist militants. China responded to the Soviet war in Afghanistan by supporting the mujahideen and ramping up their military presence near Afghanistan in [[Xinjiang]]. China acquired military equipment from America to defend itself from Soviet attack.<ref>{{cite book|author=S. Frederick Starriditor=S. Frederick Starr|year=2004|edition=illustrated|publisher=M.E.

The intervention, along with other events, such as the [[Iranian revolution]] and the US hostage stand-off that accompanied it, the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], the [[1982 Lebanon War]] and the escalating tensions between Pakistan and India, contributed to the volatility of the Middle East and South Asian regions in the 1980s.\n\nThe [[Non-Aligned Movement]] was sharply divided between those who believed the Soviet deployment to be a legitimate police action and others who considered the deployment an illegal invasion.

The large Red Army formations weren't mobile enough to engage small groups of Muj fighters that easily merged back into the terrain.<ref name=Fremont-Barnes/> The set strategy also meant that troops were discouraged from \"tactical initiative\", essential in counter insurgency, because it \"tended to upset operational timing\".<ref name=Grau-201/>\n* The Russians used large-scale offensives against Mujahideen strongholds, such as in the Panjshir Valley, which temporarily clearing those sectors and killed many civilians in addition to enemy combatants.

The peak number of Soviet troops during the war was 115,000. The bulk of these troops were conscripts, which led to poor combat performance in their Motor-Rifle Formations. However, the Russians did have their elite infantry units, such as the famed Spetsnaz, the VDV, and their recon infantry. The problem with their elite units was not combat effectiveness, but that there were not enough of them and that they were employed incorrectly.<ref name=Fremont-Barnes/>\n* Intelligence gathering, essential for successful COIN, was inadequate. The Soviets over-relied on less-than-accurate aerial recon and radio intercepts rather than their recon infantry and special forces.

In the non-Russian republics, those interested in independence were emboldened by the army's defeat. In Russia the war created a cleavage between the party and the military, changing the perceptions of leaders about the ability to put down anti-Soviet resistance militarily (as it had in [[Prague Spring#Invasion|Czechoslovakia in 1968]], [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary in 1956]], and [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|East Germany in 1953]]). As the war was viewed as \"a Russian war fought by non Russians against Afghans\", outside of Russia it undermined the legitimacy of the Soviet Union as a trans-national political union. The war created new forms of political participation, in the form of new civil organizations of war veterans (Afghansti), which weakened the political hegemony of the communist party. It also started the transformation of the press and media, which continued under [[glasnost]].<ref name=REUVENY-1999/>\n\n===Civil war===\n{{Main|Conflict in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|Civil war in Afghanistan (1989\u20131992)}}\n[[File:T-54A and T-55 at Bagram Air Base.jpg|thumb|Two Soviet [[T-55]] tanks left by the Soviet army during their withdrawal lie rusting in a field near [[Bagram Airfield]], in 2002]]\n\nThe war did not end with the withdrawal of the Soviet Army. The Soviet Union left Afghanistan deep in winter, with intimations of panic among Kabul officials. The Afghan mujahideen were poised to attack provincial towns and cities and eventually Kabul, if necessary. Najibullah's government, though failing to win popular support, territory, or international recognition, was able to remain in power until 1992.\n\nCivil war between the Afghan army and mujahideen continued and about 400,000 Afghan civilians had lost their lives in the chaos and civil war of the 1990s.<ref>\"[http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/0920/p1s3-wosc.html/(page)/4 Life under Taliban cuts two ways]\". ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''. September 20, 2001</ref> Ironically, until demoralized by the defections of its senior officers, the Afghan Army had achieved a level of performance it had never reached under direct Soviet tutelage. Kabul had achieved a stalemate that exposed the mujahideen's weaknesses, political and military. But for nearly three years, while Najibullah's government successfully defended itself against mujahideen attacks, factions within the government had also developed connections with its opponents.\n\nAccording to Russian publicist [[Andrey Karaulov]], the main trigger for Najibullah losing power was Russia's refusal to sell oil products to Afghanistan in 1992 for political reasons (the new Yeltsin government did not want to support the former communists), which effectively triggered an embargo.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The defection of General [[Abdul Rashid Dostam]] and his Uzbek [[militia]], in March 1992, further undermined Najibullah's control of the state.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In April, Najibullah and his communist government fell to the mujahideen, who replaced Najibullah with a new governing council for the country.\n\nGrain production declined an average of 3.5% per year between 1978 and 1990 due to sustained fighting, instability in rural areas, prolonged drought, and deteriorated infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_TmRaZQYDZcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Afghanistan Business Intelligence Report|last=Staff|first=Global Investment and Business Center, Inc|last2=Staff|first2=International Business Publications|date=May 2000|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=9780739725009}}</ref> Soviet efforts to disrupt production in rebel-dominated areas also contributed to this decline.

Daoud Khan's irredentist foreign policy to reunite the Pashtun homeland caused much tension with Pakistan, a nation that allied itself with the United States. Daoud Khan's irredentist policy was fueled by his desire to unite his divided country. To unite his divided country, Daoud Khan started emulating policies of Emir [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] and for that he needed a popular cause (a Pashtun homeland) to unite the Afghan people divided along the tribal lines and a modern, well equipped Afghan army which would be used to surpass anyone who would oppose the Afghan government.<ref name=\"unite\"/> Daoud Khan's policy to annex Pashtun areas of Pakistan had also angered Non-Pashtun population of Afghanistan.<ref name=\"abcclio\"/> Similarly, Pashtun population in Pakistan were also not interested in having their areas being annexed by Afghanistan.<ref name=\"unhappy\"/> In 1951, the United States's State Department urged Afghanistan to drop its claim against Pakistan and accept the Durrand Line.<ref>Rubin, Barnett R.

Despite reaching this agreement with Taraki, the Soviets continued to be reluctant to intervene further in Afghanistan and repeatedly refused Soviet military intervention within Afghan borders during Taraki's rule as well as later during Amin's short rule.<ref>{{cite book|author=Rasanayagam, Angelo|title=Afghanistan: A Modern History|publisher=[[I.B.Tauris]]|year=2005|isbn=978-1-85043-857-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/afghanistan00ange/page/86 86\u201388]|url=https://archive.org/details/afghanistan00ange/page/86}}</ref>\n\n===Initiation of the insurgency===\n{{Main|Soviet Union\u2013United States relations|Pakistan\u2013Soviet Union relations}} {{See also|Adolph Dubs|l1=Kidnapping and assassination of U.S. Ambassador Adolph Dubs}}\n[[File:\u0410\u0413\u0421-17 \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043b\u0451\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0434\u043d\u0435\u043c \u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044f \u0413\u0410\u0417-66.jpeg|thumb|left|Soviet infantry at the time of deployment]]\n\nAfghanistan, under the regime of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], had hostile relations with both [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=giwiAwAAQBAJ&q=To+change+the+attitude+of+Daoud+Khan+who+was+known+to+be+pro-Moscow%2C+anti-Shah+and+anti-Pakistan#v=snippet&q=To%20change%20the%20attitude%20of%20Daoud%20Khan%20who%20was%20known%20to%20be%20pro-Moscow%2C%20anti-Shah%20and%20anti-Pakistan&f=false|title=The Middle East in World Politics (Routledge Revivals)|last=Ayoob|first=Mohammed|publisher=Routledge|page=147|date=2014|isbn=9781317811282}}</ref><ref name=\"unite\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cd85ioPsz6cC|title=Afghanistan's Two-Party Communism: Parcham and Khalq|last=Arnold|first=Anthony|pages=12, 45|isbn=9780817977931}}</ref> Like all previous Afghan rulers since 1901, Daoud Khan also wanted to emulate Emir [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] and unite his divided country.

Supposedly, two of Amin's guards killed the former president Nur Muhammad Taraki with a pillow, and Amin, himself, was suspected to be a CIA agent. The latter, however, is still disputed with Amin repeatedly demonstrating friendliness toward the various delegates of the Soviet Union who would arrive in Afghanistan. Soviet General [[Vasily Zaplatin]], a political advisor of [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] Brezhnev at the time, claimed that four of President Taraki's ministers were responsible for the destabilization.

However, as the situation continued to deteriorate from May\u2013December 1979, Moscow changed its mind on dispatching Soviet troops.  The reasons for this complete turnabout are not entirely clear, and several speculative arguments include: the grave internal situation and inability for the Afghan government; the effects of the [[Iranian Revolution]] that brought an Islamic theocracy into power, leading to fears that religious fanaticism would spread through Afghanistan and into Soviet Muslim Central Asian republics; Taraki's murder and replacement by Amin, who the Soviets feared could become aligned with the Americans and provide them with a new strategic position after the loss of Iran; and the deteriorating ties with the United States after [[NATO Double-Track Decision|NATO's two-track missile deployment decision]] and the failure of Congress to ratify the [[SALT II]] treaty, creating the impression that d\u00e9tente was \"already effectively dead.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/e-dossier_4.pdf |title=Documents on the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan e-Dossier No. 4. |date=November 2001 |website= |publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars |accessdate=17 April 2016}}</ref> The British journalist Patrick Brogan wrote in 1989: \"The simplest explanation is probably the best.

The Soviets would bomb villages that were near sites of guerrilla attacks on Soviet convoys or known to support resistance groups. Local peoples were forced to either flee their homes or die as daily Soviet attacks made it impossible to live in these areas. By forcing the people of Afghanistan to flee their homes, the Soviets hoped to deprive the guerrillas of resources and safe havens. The second strategy consisted of subversion, which entailed sending spies to join resistance groups and report information as well as bribing local tribes or guerrilla leaders into ceasing operations. Finally, the Soviets used military forays into contested territories in an effort to root out the [[guerrillas]] and limit their options. Classic [[search and destroy]] operations were implemented using [[Mil Mi-24]] helicopter gunships that would provide cover for ground forces in armored vehicles. Once the villages were occupied by Soviet forces, inhabitants who remained were frequently interrogated and tortured for information or killed.<ref name=\"Report from Afghanistan\">[http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/afghan/report.pdf Report from Afghanistan] Claude Malhuret</ref>\n\n[[File:Afghan village destroyed by the Soviets.jpg|thumb|An Afghan village left in ruins after being destroyed by [[Soviet Armed Forces|Soviet forces]]]]\n\nTo complement their brute force approach to weeding out the [[insurgency]], the Soviets used [[KHAD]] (Afghan secret police) to gather intelligence, infiltrate the mujahideen, spread false information, bribe tribal militias into fighting and organize a government [[militia]].

Perhaps the most notable of these groups was the [[Liberation Organization of the People of Afghanistan]] (SAMA), which launched skilled guerilla attacks and controlled some territory north of Kabul in the early years of the war. The Maoist resistance eventually lost its pace and was severely weakened following the deaths of leaders [[Faiz Ahmad]] and [[Mulavi Dawood]] in 1986, both committed by the [[Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin]] mujahideen faction.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[File:Afghanistan insurgency 1985.png|thumb|left|The areas where the different mujahideen forces operated in 1985]]\n\nIn the course of the guerrilla war, leadership came to be distinctively associated with the title of \"commander\". It applied to independent leaders, eschewing identification with elaborate military [[bureaucracy]] associated with such ranks as general. As the war produced leaders of reputation, \"commander\" was conferred on leaders of fighting units of all sizes, signifying pride in independence, self-sufficiency, and distinct ties to local communities. The title epitomized Afghan pride in their struggle against a powerful foe. Segmentation of power and religious leadership were the two values evoked by nomenclature generated in the war. Neither had been favored in the ideology of the former Afghan state.\n\nAfghanistan's resistance movement was born in chaos, spread and triumphed chaotically, and did not find a way to govern differently. Virtually all of its war was waged locally by regional [[warlord]]s. As warfare became more sophisticated, outside support and regional coordination grew. Even so, the basic units of mujahideen organization and action continued to reflect the highly segmented nature of Afghan society.<ref name=\"loc1\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0101) The Path to Victory and Chaos: 1979\u201392 \u2013 Library of Congress country studies](Retrieved Thursday 31, 2007)</ref>\n\n[[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]] estimates that after four years of war, there were at least 4,000 bases from which mujahideen units operated. Most of these were affiliated with the seven expatriate parties headquartered in Pakistan, which served as sources of supply and varying degrees of supervision. Significant commanders typically led 300 or more men, controlled several bases and dominated a district or a sub-division of a province. Hierarchies of organization above the bases were attempted. Their operations varied greatly in scope, the most ambitious being achieved by [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] of the [[Panjshir valley]] north of [[Kabul]]. He led at least 10,000 trained troopers at the end of the Soviet war and had expanded his political control of [[Tajiks|Tajik]]-dominated areas to Afghanistan's northeastern provinces under the Supervisory Council of the North.<ref name=\"loc1\" />\n[[File:August 1985 Muja.jpg|thumb|Three mujahideen in [[Asmar]], 1985]]\n\nRoy also describes regional, ethnic and sectarian variations in mujahideen organization. In the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] areas of the east, south and southwest, tribal structure, with its many rival sub-divisions, provided the basis for military organization and leadership. Mobilization could be readily linked to traditional fighting allegiances of the tribal ''lashkar'' (fighting force). In favorable circumstances such formations could quickly reach more than 10,000, as happened when large Soviet assaults were launched in the eastern provinces, or when the mujahideen besieged towns, such as [[Khost]] in [[Paktia]] province in July 1983.<ref>The siege was ended only in November 1987 through the conduct of Operation Magistal'</ref> But in campaigns of the latter type the traditional explosions of manpower\u2014customarily common immediately after the completion of harvest\u2014proved obsolete when confronted by well dug-in defenders with modern weapons. Lashkar durability was notoriously short; few sieges succeeded.<ref name=\"loc1\"/>\n\nMujahideen mobilization in non-Pashtun regions faced very different obstacles. Prior to the intervention, few non-Pashtuns possessed firearms. Early in the war they were most readily available from army troops or [[gendarmerie]] who defected or were ambushed. The international arms market and foreign military support tended to reach the minority areas last. In the northern regions, little military tradition had survived upon which to build an armed resistance. Mobilization mostly came from political leadership closely tied to Islam. Roy contrasts the social leadership of religious figures in the [[Persian language|Persian]]- and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking regions of Afghanistan with that of the Pashtuns. Lacking a strong political representation in a state dominated by Pashtuns, minority communities commonly looked to pious learned or charismatically revered ''[[pir (Sufism)|pirs]]'' (saints) for leadership. Extensive [[Sufi]] and [[maraboutic]] networks were spread through the minority communities, readily available as foundations for leadership, organization, communication and indoctrination. These networks also provided for political mobilization, which led to some of the most effective of the resistance operations during the war.<ref name=\"loc1\" />\n\nThe mujahideen favoured [[sabotage]] operations. The more common types of sabotage included damaging [[electric power transmission|power lines]], knocking out [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and radio stations, blowing up government [[office building]]s, [[air terminal]]s, hotels, cinemas, and so on. In the border region with Pakistan, the mujahideen would often launch 800 [[rocket]]s per day. Between April 1985 and January 1987, they carried out over 23,500 [[shell (projectile)|shelling]] attacks on government targets. The mujahideen surveyed firing positions that they normally located near villages within the range of Soviet artillery posts, putting the villagers in danger of death from Soviet retaliation. The mujahideen used [[land mines]] heavily. Often, they would enlist the services of the local inhabitants, even children.\n[[File:Mujahideen prayer in Shultan Valley Kunar, 1987.jpg|thumb|Mujahideen praying in Shultan Valley, 1987]]\n\nThey concentrated on both civilian and military targets, knocking out bridges, closing major roads, attacking [[convoy]]s, disrupting the electric power system and industrial production, and attacking police stations and Soviet military installations and air bases. They assassinated government officials and PDPA members, and laid siege to small rural outposts. In March 1982, a bomb exploded at the [[Ministry (government department)|Ministry]] of Education, damaging several buildings. In the same month, a widespread [[power failure]] darkened Kabul when a pylon on the transmission line from the Naghlu power station was blown up. In June 1982 a column of about 1,000 young [[communist party]] members sent out to work in the Panjshir valley were ambushed within 30&nbsp;km of Kabul, with heavy loss of life. On September 4, 1985, insurgents shot down a domestic Bakhtar Airlines plane as it took off from Kandahar airport, killing all 52 people aboard.\n\nMujahideen groups used for assassination had three to five men in each. After they received their mission to kill certain government officials, they busied themselves with studying his pattern of life and its details and then selecting the method of fulfilling their established mission. They practiced shooting at automobiles, [[drive by|shooting out of automobiles]], laying mines in government accommodation or houses, using poison, and rigging explosive charges in transport.\n\nIn May 1985, the seven principal rebel organizations formed the [[Seven Party Mujahideen Alliance]] to coordinate their military operations against the Soviet army. Late in 1985, the groups were active in and around Kabul, unleashing rocket attacks and conducting operations against the communist government.\n\n===Media reaction===\n{{quote box |align=right|width=30%|quote = Those hopelessly brave warriors I walked with, and their families, who suffered so much for faith and freedom and who are still not free, they were truly the people of God. \u2013 Journalist [[Rob Schultheis]], 1992<ref>Schultheis, Rob. \"Night Letters Inside Wartime Afghanistan\", 1992. p. 155</ref><ref name=\"pete\">[[Peter Bergen|Bergen, Peter]], ''[[Holy War, Inc.]]'', 2001</ref>}}\n\nInternational journalistic perception of the war varied.

Kaplan note that \"none of the American TV networks had a bureau for a war\",{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=10}} and television cameramen venturing to follow the mujahideen \"trekked for weeks on little food, only to return ill and half starved\".{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=14}} In October 1984 the Soviet ambassador to Pakistan, Vitaly Smirnov, told [[Agence France Presse]] \"that journalists traveling with the mujahidin 'will be killed.

During this phase, the Soviet contingent was restricted to supporting the DRA forces by providing [[artillery]], air support and technical assistance, though some large-scale operations were still carried out by Soviet troops.\n\nUnder Soviet guidance, the DRA armed forces were built up to an official strength of 302,000 in 1986. To minimize the risk of a coup d'\u00e9tat, they were divided into different branches, each modeled on its Soviet counterpart. The ministry of defence forces numbered 132,000, the ministry of interior 70,000 and the ministry of state security ([[KHAD]]) 80,000. However, these were theoretical figures: in reality each service was plagued with [[desertion]]s, the army alone suffering 32,000 per year.\n\nThe decision to engage primarily Afghan forces was taken by the Soviets, but was resented by the PDPA, who viewed the departure of their protectors without enthusiasm. In May 1987 a DRA force attacked well-entrenched mujahideen positions in the [[Arghandab District]], but the mujahideen held their ground, and the attackers suffered heavy casualties.<ref>Urban, ''War in Afghanistan'', p. 219</ref> In the spring of 1986, an offensive into [[Paktia Province]] briefly occupied the mujahideen base at [[Battles of Zhawar|Zhawar]] only at the cost of heavy losses.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grau |first=Lester |authorlink2=Ali Ahmad Jalali|last2=Jalali |first2=Ali Ahmad|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2001/010900-zhawar.htm|title=The campaign for the caves: the battles for Zhawar in the Soviet-Afghan War|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=March 29, 2007}}</ref> Meanwhile, the mujahideen benefited from expanded foreign military support from the United States, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and other Muslim nations.

Gorbachev had been attempting to remove the Soviet Union from the economic stagnation that had set in under the leadership of Brezhnev, and to reform the Soviet Union's economy and image with the [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]] policies. Gorbachev had also been attempting to ease cold war tensions by signing the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] with the U.S. in 1987 and withdrawing the troops from Afghanistan, whose presence had garnered so much international condemnation. Gorbachev regarded confrontation with China and resulting military build ups on that border as one of Brezhnev's biggest mistakes.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Beijing had stipulated that a normalization of relations would have to wait until Moscow withdrew its army from Afghanistan (among other things), and in 1989 the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years took place.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Maley, William  |author2=Saikal, Amin |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=127}}</ref> At the same time, Gorbachev pressured his Cuban allies in Angola to scale down activities and withdraw even though Soviet allies were faring somewhat better there.<ref>{{cite book|last=Urban, Mark|title=War in Afghanistan|year=1990|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page= 300}}</ref> The Soviets also pulled many of their troops out of [[Mongolia]] in 1987, where they were also having a far easier time than in Afghanistan, and restrained the [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War|Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea]] to the point of an all out withdrawal in 1988.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Maley, William  |author2=Saikal, Amin |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=132}}</ref> This massive withdrawal of Soviet forces from such highly contested areas shows that the Soviet government's decision to leave Afghanistan was based upon a general change in Soviet foreign policy \u2013 from one of confrontation to avoidance of conflict wherever possible.\n\nIn the last phase, Soviet troops prepared and executed their withdrawal from Afghanistan, whilst limiting the launching of offensive operations by those who hadn't withdrawn yet.\n\nBy mid-1987 the Soviet Union announced that it would start withdrawing its forces. [[Sibghatullah Mojaddedi]] was selected as the head of the Interim Islamic State of Afghanistan, in an attempt to reassert its legitimacy against the Moscow-sponsored Kabul regime. Mojaddedi, as head of the Interim Afghan Government, met with then Vice President of the United States [[George H. W. Bush]], achieving a critical diplomatic victory for the Afghan resistance. Defeat of the Kabul government was their solution for peace. This confidence, sharpened by their distrust of the United Nations, virtually guaranteed their refusal to accept a political compromise.\n\nIn September 1988, Soviet MiG-23 fighters shot down two Iranian [[Bell AH-1 SuperCobra|AH-1J Cobra]], which had intruded in Afghan airspace.<ref>\"The Aviation History\", Florian Ion Petrescu, Relly Victoria Petrescu, 2012, p. 82</ref>\n\n''[[Operation Magistral]]'' was one of the final offensive operations undertaken by the Soviets, a successful sweep operation that cleared the road between [[Gardez]] and [[Khost]].

It was weakened by divisions within the PDPA and the Parcham faction, and the regime's efforts to expand its base of support proved futile. Moscow came to regard Karmal as a failure and blamed him for the problems. Years later, when Karmal's inability to consolidate his government had become obvious, Mikhail Gorbachev, then General Secretary of the [[Soviet Communist Party]], said, \"The main reason that there has been no national consolidation so far is that Comrade Karmal is hoping to continue sitting in Kabul with our help.\"{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:RIAN archive 644461 First stage in the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|A column of Soviet BTR armored personnel carriers departing from Afghanistan.]]\n\nIn November 1986, [[Mohammad Najibullah]], former chief of the Afghan [[secret police]] ([[KHAD]]), was elected president and a new constitution was adopted.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} He also introduced in 1987 a policy of \"national reconciliation,\" devised by experts of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], and later used in other regions of the world.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Despite high expectations, the new policy neither made the Moscow-backed Kabul regime more popular, nor did it convince the insurgents to negotiate with the ruling government.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nInformal negotiations for a Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan had been underway since 1982.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In 1988, the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan, with the United States and Soviet Union serving as guarantors, signed an agreement settling the major differences between them known as the [[Geneva Accords (1988)|Geneva Accords]]. The United Nations set up a special [[United Nations Good Offices Mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan|Mission]] to oversee the process. In this way, Najibullah had stabilized his political position enough to begin matching Moscow's moves toward withdrawal. On July 20, 1987, the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country was announced. The withdrawal of Soviet forces was planned out by Lt. Gen. [[Boris Gromov]], who, at the time, was the commander of the [[40th Army]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nAmong other things the Geneva accords identified the US and Soviet non-intervention in the internal affairs of Pakistan and Afghanistan and a timetable for full Soviet withdrawal.

In order to counter the Soviet jets, United States started providing F-16 jets to Pakistan.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/> These F-16 jets lacked the capability to fire radar-guided beyond-visual range missiles and thus required to get close to their opponents in order to use their AIM-9P and more advanced AIM-9L Sidewinder heat-seeking or their 20-millimeter Vulcan cannons. On 17 May 1986, two Pakistan Air Force (PAF) F-16 intercepted two [[Sukhoi Su-17|Su-22M3K]] belonging to Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Air Force (DRAAF) near the Pakistani airspace.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/> Pakistani officials insisted that both the fighter jets belonging to DRAAF were shot down while Afghan officials confirmed loss of only one fighter jet. Following the engagement, there was major decline in the number of attacks on Afghan refugees camps in Pakistan. On 16 April 1987, a group of PAF F-16s again chased down two DRAAF Su-22 and managed to shoot down one of them and capture its pilot.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/> In the year 1987, Soviet Union reported that Pakistani fighter jets were roaming in Afghan airspace, harassing attempts to aerial resupply the besieged garrisons like the one in [[Khost province|Khost]]. On 30 March 1987, two PAF F-16s shot down an [[Antonov An-26|An-26]] cargo plane, killing all 39 personnel on board the aircraft. In the coming years, PAF claimed credit for shooting down several Mi-8 transports helicopter, another An-26 which was on a reconnaissance mission in 1989.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/> In the year 1987, two PAF F-16 ambushed four [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|Mig-23]] who were bombing Mujahideen supply bases. In the clash, one PAF F-16 was lost after it was accidentally hit by an AIM-9 Sidewinder fired by the second PAF F-16. The PAF pilot landed in Afghanistan territory and was smuggled back to Pakistan along with wreckage of his aircraft by the Mujahideen. However, some Russian sources claim that F-16 was shot down by Mig-23, though the Russian Mig-23 were not carrying air-to-air missiles.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/>\n\nOn 8 August 1988, Colonel [[Alexander Rutskoy]] was leading a group of [[Sukhoi Su-25]] fighter jets to attack a refugee camp in [[Miramshah]], Pakistan.

A month later, around twelve [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23|Mig-23]] crossed into Pakistani airspace with the aim to lure ambush the Pakistani F-16s. Two PAF F-16s flew towards the Soviet fighter jets.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/> The Soviet radars failed to detect the low flying F-16s and the sidewinder fired by one of F-16 damaged one of the Mig-23. However, the damaged Mig-23 managed to reach back home. Two Mig-23 engaged the two PAF F-16s. The Pakistani officials state that both the Mig-23 were shot down. However, Soviet records show that no additional aircraft was lost on that day. The last aerial engagement took place on 3 November 1988. One Su-2M4K belonging to DRAAF was shot down by Pakistani airforce jet.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\"/>\n\nDuring the conflict, Pakistan Air Force F-16 had shot down ten aircraft, belonging to Soviet Union, which had intruded into Pakistani territory. However, the Soviet record only confirmed five kills (three Su-22s, one Su-25 and one An-26). Some sources show that PAF had shot down at least a dozen more aircraft during the war. However, those kills were not officially acknowledged because they took place in Afghanistan's airspace and acknowledging those kills would mean that Afghan airspace was violated by PAF.<ref name=\"nationalinterest\">{{cite web|url=https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/pakistan%E2%80%99s-f-16s-battled-soviet-jets%E2%80%94and-shot-down-future-vice-president-russia-47717|title=Pakistan's F-16s Battled Soviet Jets\u2014and Shot Down the Future Vice President of Russia|date=16 March 2019|work=National Interest|last=Roblin|first=Sebastian|accessdate=20 December 2019}}</ref> In all, Pakistan Air Force F-16 had downed several MiG-23s, Su-22s, an Su-25, and an An-24 while lost only one F-16.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=88JvDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=PAF%20F-16s%20downed%20several%20MiG-23s%2C%20Su-22s%2C%20an%20Su-25%2C%20and%20an%20An-24.&f=false|title=Air Warfare in the Missile Age|last=Nordeen|first=Lon O.|accessdate=20 December 2019|publisher=Smithsonian Institution, 2010|page=170|isbn=9781588342829|year=2010}}</ref>\n\n==Atrocities==\n\n===Massacres===\nAmerican professor [[Samuel Totten]],<ref name=Totten/> Australian professor [[Paul R.

China and Afghanistan had neutral relations with each other during the King's rule. When the pro-Soviet Afghan Communists seized power in Afghanistan in 1978, relations between China and the Afghan communists quickly turned hostile. The Afghan pro-Soviet communists supported China's then-enemy Vietnam and blamed China for supporting Afghan anti-communist militants. China responded to the Soviet war in Afghanistan by supporting the mujahideen and ramping up their military presence near Afghanistan in [[Xinjiang]]. China acquired military equipment from America to defend itself from Soviet attack.<ref>{{cite book|author=S. Frederick Starriditor=S. Frederick Starr|year=2004|edition=illustrated|publisher=M.E.

The intervention, along with other events, such as the [[Iranian revolution]] and the US hostage stand-off that accompanied it, the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]], the [[1982 Lebanon War]] and the escalating tensions between Pakistan and India, contributed to the volatility of the Middle East and South Asian regions in the 1980s.\n\nThe [[Non-Aligned Movement]] was sharply divided between those who believed the Soviet deployment to be a legitimate police action and others who considered the deployment an illegal invasion.

The large Red Army formations weren't mobile enough to engage small groups of Muj fighters that easily merged back into the terrain.<ref name=Fremont-Barnes/> The set strategy also meant that troops were discouraged from \"tactical initiative\", essential in counter insurgency, because it \"tended to upset operational timing\".<ref name=Grau-201/>\n* The Russians used large-scale offensives against Mujahideen strongholds, such as in the Panjshir Valley, which temporarily clearing those sectors and killed many civilians in addition to enemy combatants.

The peak number of Soviet troops during the war was 115,000. The bulk of these troops were conscripts, which led to poor combat performance in their Motor-Rifle Formations. However, the Russians did have their elite infantry units, such as the famed Spetsnaz, the VDV, and their recon infantry. The problem with their elite units was not combat effectiveness, but that there were not enough of them and that they were employed incorrectly.<ref name=Fremont-Barnes/>\n* Intelligence gathering, essential for successful COIN, was inadequate. The Soviets over-relied on less-than-accurate aerial recon and radio intercepts rather than their recon infantry and special forces.

In the non-Russian republics, those interested in independence were emboldened by the army's defeat. In Russia the war created a cleavage between the party and the military, changing the perceptions of leaders about the ability to put down anti-Soviet resistance militarily (as it had in [[Prague Spring#Invasion|Czechoslovakia in 1968]], [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary in 1956]], and [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|East Germany in 1953]]). As the war was viewed as \"a Russian war fought by non Russians against Afghans\", outside of Russia it undermined the legitimacy of the Soviet Union as a trans-national political union. The war created new forms of political participation, in the form of new civil organizations of war veterans (Afghansti), which weakened the political hegemony of the communist party. It also started the transformation of the press and media, which continued under [[glasnost]].<ref name=REUVENY-1999/>\n\n===Civil war===\n{{Main|Conflict in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|Civil war in Afghanistan (1989\u20131992)}}\n[[File:T-54A and T-55 at Bagram Air Base.jpg|thumb|Two Soviet [[T-55]] tanks left by the Soviet army during their withdrawal lie rusting in a field near [[Bagram Airfield]], in 2002]]\n\nThe war did not end with the withdrawal of the Soviet Army. The Soviet Union left Afghanistan deep in winter, with intimations of panic among Kabul officials. The Afghan mujahideen were poised to attack provincial towns and cities and eventually Kabul, if necessary. Najibullah's government, though failing to win popular support, territory, or international recognition, was able to remain in power until 1992.\n\nCivil war between the Afghan army and mujahideen continued and about 400,000 Afghan civilians had lost their lives in the chaos and civil war of the 1990s.<ref>\"[http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/0920/p1s3-wosc.html/(page)/4 Life under Taliban cuts two ways]\". ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''. September 20, 2001</ref> Ironically, until demoralized by the defections of its senior officers, the Afghan Army had achieved a level of performance it had never reached under direct Soviet tutelage. Kabul had achieved a stalemate that exposed the mujahideen's weaknesses, political and military. But for nearly three years, while Najibullah's government successfully defended itself against mujahideen attacks, factions within the government had also developed connections with its opponents.\n\nAccording to Russian publicist [[Andrey Karaulov]], the main trigger for Najibullah losing power was Russia's refusal to sell oil products to Afghanistan in 1992 for political reasons (the new Yeltsin government did not want to support the former communists), which effectively triggered an embargo.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The defection of General [[Abdul Rashid Dostam]] and his Uzbek [[militia]], in March 1992, further undermined Najibullah's control of the state.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In April, Najibullah and his communist government fell to the mujahideen, who replaced Najibullah with a new governing council for the country.\n\nGrain production declined an average of 3.5% per year between 1978 and 1990 due to sustained fighting, instability in rural areas, prolonged drought, and deteriorated infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_TmRaZQYDZcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Afghanistan Business Intelligence Report|last=Staff|first=Global Investment and Business Center, Inc|last2=Staff|first2=International Business Publications|date=May 2000|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=9780739725009}}</ref> Soviet efforts to disrupt production in rebel-dominated areas also contributed to this decline.

After travelling to England, he was posted to [[No. 15 Squadron RAF]] and was sent to France shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, flying [[Fairey Battle]]s on [[Aerial reconnaissance|photo-reconnaissance]] missions into [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. After his squadron returned to England and converted to [[Bristol Blenheim IV|Bristol Blenheim]]s, he flew several bombing missions during the [[Battle of France]]. Afterwards he spent several months on instructing duties before being posted to [[No. 487 Squadron RNZAF|No. 487 (NZ) Squadron]] in August 1942. He was shot down over [[Amsterdam]] while on a bombing mission, codenamed [[Operation Ramrod 16]], on 3 May 1943, becoming a prisoner of war. \n\nAfter the war, he was awarded the VC for his actions during Ramrod 16. He continued to serve with the RAF and was commander of [[No. 214 Squadron RAF|No. 214 Squadron]] during the [[Suez Crisis]]. He retired in June 1965 and lived in Australia, and then New Zealand, in his later years. He died in 1986, aged 71. \n\n==Early life==\nLeonard Henry Trent was born in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], New Zealand, on 14 April 1915, the son of Leonard Trent, a dentist, and his wife Irene {{nee|Everett}}.<ref name=\"Hayward 1\">{{DNZB|title=Trent, Leonard Henry|first= Joel|last= Hayward|id=5t20|accessdate=8 January 2011}}</ref> In April 1919 the family relocated to [[Takaka]], along the shore of [[Golden Bay]].{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=21}} Three years later, his father paid for Trent to take a short flight in a [[de Havilland DH.60 Moth|Gipsy Moth]] piloted by [[Malcolm C. McGregor]], a [[fighter ace]] of the [[First World War]], and subsequently Trent became interested in flying.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=22\u201323}} He was educated at [[Nelson College]], boarding at the school from 1928.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=24}} Not particularly academically inclined he became increasingly interested in golf and in his final year at school, in 1934, won the Nelson Golf Club Senior Championship.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=25}}\n\nTrent had intended to go to university to study dentistry,{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=25}} but the family could not afford to pay for his studies and he instead took up a position as a clerk in the administrative office of an [[abattoir]] in [[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]]. He gave up the work after a year and returned to Nelson to assist his father in his dental practice.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=26}} After a time he moved to [[Wellington, New Zealand|Wellington]] taking up office work again. He was soon earning enough money that he could afford to go to night school and study aero engineering and maintenance.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=26}}\n\n==Early service career==\nIn early 1937, in response to an advertisement in a newspaper, Trent applied for a short-term [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]] in the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF).{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=27}} He passed a selection interview and subsequent medical test and in August was accepted for flight training. Induction training was with the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] (RNZAF) and was held at [[Taieri]], near [[Dunedin]],{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=28\u201329}} where he flew [[Gipsy Moth]]s and [[Miles Magister]]s.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=27}} Trent then undertook flight training at the RNZAF's [[Wigram|Wigram Air Base]] in [[Christchurch]],{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=28\u201329}} flying [[Avro 626]] and [[Vickers Vildebeest]] aircraft.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=28\u201329}} He gained his [[Aircrew brevet|wings]] on 12 May 1938 and a month later he sailed for Britain to join the RAF.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=36\u201337}} He was granted a short-service commission of five years in the rank of [[pilot officer]] on 23 August 1938.<ref>{{London Gazette|publication_link=London Gazette |issue=34548 |date=6 September 1938 |page=5678 |supp=}}</ref>\n\nPosted to [[No. 15 Squadron RAF]], which operated [[Fairey Battle]]s out of [[RAF Abingdon|Abingdon]] in [[Berkshire]], Trent spent the next few months learning bombing and reconnaissance flying techniques.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=38}} In February 1939, he spent three months at [[Hamble-le-Rice|Hamble]], near [[Southampton]], attending a navigation course. Here he met Ursula Woolhouse, while playing golf at the local club in his downtime.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=41}}\n\n==Second World War==\nIn early September 1939, following the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], No. 15 Squadron flew to France as part of the [[RAF Advanced Air Striking Force]].{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=43}} Stationed at [[Vraux]], the squadron was to fly high-level [[Aerial reconnaissance|photo-reconnaissance]] missions over enemy territory, collecting information on [[Nazi Germany|German]] airfields, factories and major infrastructure. Trent flew his first mission into Germany on 24 September 1939, No. 15 Squadron's first operational sortie of the war.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=44\u201345}} This period of the war was known as the [[Phoney War]], and much the squadron's flying revolved around training and practice bombing missions. The squadron was sent back to England in early December to convert to the [[Bristol Blenheim IV]], operating from [[RAF Wyton|Wyton]].{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=48}} \n\nInitial conversion work was on the [[Bristol Blenheim I]] and during this time Trent had to make an emergency landing, having become lost in overcast conditions while on a flight to Scotland.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=52\u201353}} In March 1940, he was promoted to [[flying officer]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=34822 |date=2 April 1940 |page=1916 |supp=|nolink=y}}</ref> The squadron returned to operations when the Germans [[Battle of France|invaded France]] and the [[Low Countries]] on 10 May 1940.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=54}} That day he flew one of three aircraft that bombed German forces at an aerodrome near [[Rotterdam]].{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=55}} Further missions followed, including a bombing raid on bridges over the [[Albert Canal]] that saw six of the twelve participating aircraft destroyed.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=56\u201359}} On another mission, his aircraft suffered damage from [[flak]] and an attacking [[Messerschmitt Me 109]] fighter and he put down at an airfield on the way back to his base for repairs. However, advancing Germans threatened the airfield and as night fell, he and his crew had to fly to England as they could not navigate back to their base in France.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=63\u201364}} On 23 May, casualties in the squadron saw Trent promoted to acting [[flight lieutenant]] and taking command of one of the flights of the squadron.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=68}} He led several bombing sorties while [[Operation Dynamo]] was in effect and by mid-June had flown 14 sorties. Exhausted, he was sent on leave.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=69\u201370}} \n\nOn his return to duty, Trent was posted to [[No. 17 Operational Training Unit RAF|No. 17 Operational Training Unit]], stationed at [[RAF Upwood|Upwood]], as an instructor.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=71}} He taught trainees formation flying and made navigational flights in [[Avro Anson]]s.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|p=72}} He also had the opportunity to fly other aircraft; these included the [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington bomber]].

An [[Article XV squadrons|Article XV squadron]], much of its flying personnel were New Zealanders, although other nationalities also served with the squadron.{{sfn|Thompson|1953|pp=210\u2013217}} Trent, still hoping for a posting to No. 88 Squadron, was instead sent to No. 487 Squadron as one of its flight commanders.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=83\u201384}} The squadron was to operate [[Lockheed Ventura]]s; these were unpopular aircraft, being relatively slow and demanding to fly, with an inadequate defensive armament. Although the senior officers in the squadron were experienced flying personnel, many crews were novices and needed extensive practice in formation flying before reaching an acceptable standard for operational duties. The squadron flew its first mission in December, a raid on a factory at [[Eindhoven]]. Over the next several months, the squadron flew raids to targets in France and the Low Countries.{{sfn|Harper|Richardson|2007|p=288}}\n\nOn 3 May 1943 the squadron flew a bombing mission, codenamed [[Operation Ramrod 16]], on a power station in [[Amsterdam]]. The mission was intended to be as a diversion to another raid being carried out almost simultaneously on a power station at [[Ijmuiden]]. \"Ramrod\" was a term designating a daylight bombing mission, with a fighter escort, that targeted a specific objective. The twelve participating Venturas, led by Trent, were to cross the Dutch coast at sea level, escorted by six squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfires]]. Two more squadrons of Spitfires were to provide top cover for the Venturas over the target, with all of the aircraft keeping to sea level as they approached the Dutch coast so as to avoid showing up on German radar, before climbing to reach bombing height. However, the Spitfires flying top cover mistimed their departure from England, arriving early and failing to keep low enough when reaching the Dutch coast. This alerted the German defences.{{sfn|Thompson|1956|pp=143\u2013147}}{{sfn|Harper|Richardson|2007|pp=288\u2013290}} \n[[Image:487 Squadron RNZAF NCOs RAF Methold early 1943.JPG|thumb|right|Non-commissioned officers of Trent's No. 487 Squadron, with a Ventura at RAF Methwold, early 1943]]\nOne Ventura had returned to England with a malfunction and as the eleven remaining aircraft of No. 487 Squadron approached Amsterdam, they and their escorts were set upon by Me 109s and [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]s, 70 aircraft in all. The top cover, arriving well before the Venturas, had already been recalled having run low on fuel. The Fw 190s dealt with the escorting Spitfires while the Me 109s targeted the bombers. Under constant attack by the German fighters, No. 487 Squadron continued on to its target, with only five aircraft making it to Amsterdam to commence their bombing run. Only Trent successfully completed his run, and in doing so shot down one Me 109 with the forward [[machine gun]]s of his Ventura. Immediately afterwards, his own aircraft was hit and put into a spin. As the Ventura broke up, Trent and his [[navigator]] were thrown clear at {{convert|7000|ft|m|adj=off}} and became [[prisoners of war]] (POW).

This operation was intended to encourage the Dutch workmen in their resistance to enemy pressure and the target was known to be heavily defended. The importance of bombing it, regardless of enemy fighters or anti-aircraft fire, was strongly impressed on the aircrews taking part in the operation. Before taking off Squadron Leader Trent told the deputy leader that he was going over the target whatever happened. All went well until the eleven Venturas and their fighter escort were nearing the Dutch Coast. Then one bomber was hit and had to turn back. Suddenly large numbers of enemy fighters appeared. Our escorting fighters were hotly engaged and lost touch with the bombing force. The Venturas closed up for mutual protection and commenced their run up to the target. Unfortunately the fighters detailed to support them over the target had reached the area too early and had been recalled. Soon the bombers were attacked. They were at the mercy of fifteen to twenty Messerschmitts which dived on them incessantly. Within four minutes six Venturas were destroyed. Squadron Leader Trent continued on his course with the remaining three aircraft, and in a short time two more Venturas went down in flames. Heedless of the murderous attacks and of the heavy anti-aircraft fire which was now encountered, Squadron Leader Trent completed an accurate bombing run, and even shot down a Messerschmitt at point blank range. Dropping his bombs in the target area he turned away. The aircraft following him was shot down on reaching the target. Immediately afterwards his own aircraft was hit and went into a spin and broke up. Squadron Leader Trent and his navigator were thrown clear and became prisoners of war. The two other members of the crew perished. On this, his twenty-fourth sortie, Squadron Leader Trent showed outstanding leadership. Such was the trust placed in this gallant officer that the other pilots followed him unwaveringly.

An [[Article XV squadrons|Article XV squadron]], much of its flying personnel were New Zealanders, although other nationalities also served with the squadron.{{sfn|Thompson|1953|pp=210\u2013217}} Trent, still hoping for a posting to No. 88 Squadron, was instead sent to No. 487 Squadron as one of its flight commanders.{{sfn|Sanders|1983|pp=83\u201384}} The squadron was to operate [[Lockheed Ventura]]s; these were unpopular aircraft, being relatively slow and demanding to fly, with an inadequate defensive armament. Although the senior officers in the squadron were experienced flying personnel, many crews were novices and needed extensive practice in formation flying before reaching an acceptable standard for operational duties. The squadron flew its first mission in December, a raid on a factory at [[Eindhoven]]. Over the next several months, the squadron flew raids to targets in France and the Low Countries.{{sfn|Harper|Richardson|2007|p=288}}\n\nOn 3 May 1943 the squadron flew a bombing mission, codenamed [[Operation Ramrod 16]], on a power station in [[Amsterdam]]. The mission was intended to be as a diversion to another raid being carried out almost simultaneously on a power station at [[Ijmuiden]]. \"Ramrod\" was a term designating a daylight bombing mission, with a fighter escort, that targeted a specific objective. The twelve participating Venturas, led by Trent, were to cross the Dutch coast at sea level, escorted by six squadrons of [[Supermarine Spitfires]]. Two more squadrons of Spitfires were to provide top cover for the Venturas over the target, with all of the aircraft keeping to sea level as they approached the Dutch coast so as to avoid showing up on German radar, before climbing to reach bombing height. However, the Spitfires flying top cover mistimed their departure from England, arriving early and failing to keep low enough when reaching the Dutch coast. This alerted the German defences.{{sfn|Thompson|1956|pp=143\u2013147}}{{sfn|Harper|Richardson|2007|pp=288\u2013290}} \n[[Image:487 Squadron RNZAF NCOs RAF Methold early 1943.JPG|thumb|right|Non-commissioned officers of Trent's No. 487 Squadron, with a Ventura at RAF Methwold, early 1943]]\nOne Ventura had returned to England with a malfunction and as the eleven remaining aircraft of No. 487 Squadron approached Amsterdam, they and their escorts were set upon by Me 109s and [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]]s, 70 aircraft in all. The top cover, arriving well before the Venturas, had already been recalled having run low on fuel. The Fw 190s dealt with the escorting Spitfires while the Me 109s targeted the bombers. Under constant attack by the German fighters, No. 487 Squadron continued on to its target, with only five aircraft making it to Amsterdam to commence their bombing run. Only Trent successfully completed his run, and in doing so shot down one Me 109 with the forward [[machine gun]]s of his Ventura. Immediately afterwards, his own aircraft was hit and put into a spin. As the Ventura broke up, Trent and his [[navigator]] were thrown clear at {{convert|7000|ft|m|adj=off}} and became [[prisoners of war]] (POW).

This operation was intended to encourage the Dutch workmen in their resistance to enemy pressure and the target was known to be heavily defended. The importance of bombing it, regardless of enemy fighters or anti-aircraft fire, was strongly impressed on the aircrews taking part in the operation. Before taking off Squadron Leader Trent told the deputy leader that he was going over the target whatever happened. All went well until the eleven Venturas and their fighter escort were nearing the Dutch Coast. Then one bomber was hit and had to turn back. Suddenly large numbers of enemy fighters appeared. Our escorting fighters were hotly engaged and lost touch with the bombing force. The Venturas closed up for mutual protection and commenced their run up to the target. Unfortunately the fighters detailed to support them over the target had reached the area too early and had been recalled. Soon the bombers were attacked. They were at the mercy of fifteen to twenty Messerschmitts which dived on them incessantly. Within four minutes six Venturas were destroyed. Squadron Leader Trent continued on his course with the remaining three aircraft, and in a short time two more Venturas went down in flames. Heedless of the murderous attacks and of the heavy anti-aircraft fire which was now encountered, Squadron Leader Trent completed an accurate bombing run, and even shot down a Messerschmitt at point blank range. Dropping his bombs in the target area he turned away. The aircraft following him was shot down on reaching the target. Immediately afterwards his own aircraft was hit and went into a spin and broke up. Squadron Leader Trent and his navigator were thrown clear and became prisoners of war. The two other members of the crew perished. On this, his twenty-fourth sortie, Squadron Leader Trent showed outstanding leadership. Such was the trust placed in this gallant officer that the other pilots followed him unwaveringly.
