MacArthur stated, \"''I'm not into all that is traditionally known as dispensationalism, seven dispensations, two kingdoms, two New Covenants, two ways of salvation, discontinuity between the Old Testament and the New.''\"<ref name=\"MacArthur, John\"/>\n\n=== [[Soteriology]] ===\nMacArthur was a key person in the [[Lordship salvation controversy]] in the 1980s, arguing against [[free grace theology]]. He states, \"You must receive Jesus Christ for who He is, both Lord and Savior, to be truly saved (II Peter 2:20).\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gospel According to Jesus |author=MacArthur, John |isbn=0-310-39491-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt00maca_0 }}</ref> Regarding [[eternal security]], he states, \"It should never be presented merely as a matter of being once saved, always saved\u2014with no regard for what you believe or do. The writer of Hebrews 12:14 states frankly that only those who continue living holy lives will enter the Lord's presence.\" MacArthur's views raised controversy within U.S. evangelicalism and were challenged in print by non-lordship dispensationalist theologians [[Charles Ryrie]] and [[Zane C. Hodges]], who argued that MacArthur was teaching a form of works-based salvation. MacArthur has denied the charge, as attested on two tapes recorded in 1989 when he was asked to reason together with the IFCA man.<ref>https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-37/ifca-meeting-62689-part-2 https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-36/ifca-meeting-62689-part-1</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, the [[Bible Broadcasting Network]] terminated MacArthur's ''Grace to You'' program. In explaining that step, BBN president Lowell Davey referred to MacArthur's teachings on the blood of Christ and \"Lordship salvation.\" Davey called these teachings \"confusing\". In a letter dated January 15, 1990, Davey cited a \"drift by Dr. MacArthur to a theological position that we could not adhere to\" and said that MacArthur's sermon series on the theology of election \"convinced us that the direction of 'Grace to You' was toward Hyper-Calvinism.\" MacArthur preaches salvation by election of God's sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chosen from Eternity: Chosen by God--Part 1 |author=MacArthur, John |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Sermons/60-2}}</ref> However, the term \"Hyper-Calvinism\" is used by some to denote 5-point Calvinism or even any strong defense of Calvinism, rather than the historical \"Hyper-Calvinism\" position denies the doctrine of duty faith. This position does not seem to accurately reflect MacArthur's position in his sermons. The controversy concerning the efficacy of Christ's blood stems from MacArthur's statement that it is not the literal liquid blood of Christ that saves, but his sacrificial death on [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], a view that he espoused in an article titled \"Not His Bleeding, but His Dying,\" published in the May 1976 issue of the ''Grace to You'' family paper distributed to his church. MacArthur himself, though, later clarified what was stated of him in the article, noting his position concerning Christ's blood and death in atonement, mentioning that the efficacy of Christ's blood is not some particular physical property of the blood itself, but the fact that He shed blood in dying, and his affirmation that Christ's blood in death was necessary to satisfy God's holy requirement for atonement.<ref>{{cite web |title=What's All the Controversy About John MacArthur and the Blood of Christ? |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205235106/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Christology ===\nIn 1983, MacArthur first published his belief in the doctrine of \"[[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational sonship]].\" In 1989, after some criticism, he defended his views in a plenary session of the annual convention of the [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]]. In an article on MacArthur's web site ''Grace to You'' entitled \"Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ,\" he retraces his views from 1983 onward, concluding, \"I want to state publicly that I have abandoned the doctrine of 'incarnational sonship.' Careful study and reflection have brought me to understand that Scripture does indeed present the relationship between God the Father and Christ the Son as an eternal Father-Son relationship. I no longer regard Christ's sonship as a role He assumed in His incarnation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ |author=MacArthur, John |publisher=Grace to You |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Articles/593}}</ref>{{original research inline |date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Cessationism ===\n[[Image:Charismatic Chaos.jpg|thumb|widthpx|''Charismatic Chaos'' - one of the books where MacArthur argues for cessationism.]]\nMacArthur is a [[cessationism|cessationist]] and is one of the most prominent voices in the church against the [[continuationism|continuationist]] beliefs of [[Pentecostalism]] and the [[Charismatic Movement]]. He has written three books in support of his position: ''The Charismatics'' (1978), ''Charismatic Chaos'' (1993), and ''Strange Fire: The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship'' (2013). In October 2013, he hosted a conference called \"Strange Fire\" at his church to mark the launch of his book of the same name. The event featured a number of speakers who argued for a cessationist theology and strongly critiqued the Charismatic Movement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menzie|first1=Nicola|title='Strange Fire' Conference: John MacArthur Calls Out Charismatic Movement as 'Unfaithful'|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/strange-fire-conference-john-macarthur-calls-out-charismatic-movement-as-unfaithful-106849/|website=The Christian Post|publisher=The Christian Post|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In his opening remarks, MacArthur stated, \"Watching the behavior of some Hindus who belong to the Kundalini cult. Their body movements are almost identical to that of people in the charismatic movement, the extreme behavior of pagans. This is the work of Satan, it is the work of darkness, and not to be attributed to the Holy Spirit\". And that, \"The Charismatic movement as such has made no contribution to biblical clarity, interpretation, or sound doctrine ... It detracts and confuses.\" \"It has only produced distortion, confusion, and error.\" \"Have people truly been saved in Charismatic churches? Yes. But nothing coming from that movement has been the reason they were saved.\" \"Evangelicalism has thrown its arms open and has welcomed the Trojan horse of the charismatic movement into the city of God.

However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being \"a testimony to the absence of any theology,\" and charged that \"its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement.\" He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that \"In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to [[Calvary Chapel]]..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be.

He believes that the Biblical roles of [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]] and [[pastor]] are restricted to men by citing the biblical passage of [[1 Timothy 2:12|1 Timothy 2:11-12]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gty.org/resources/articles/A168/Gods-High-Call-for-Women|title=God's High Call for Women|author=Grace to You|work=gty.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gty.org/resources/bible-qna/BQ112012/Should-Women-Teach-in-Church|title=Should Women Teach in Church?|author=Grace to You|work=gty.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gty.org/blog/B130829/can-women-exercise-authority-in-the-church|title=Can Women Exercise Authority in the Church?|author=Grace to You|work=gty.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Psychology ===\nMacArthur is also an advocate of [[Nouthetic Counseling]], which stresses the Bible as a sufficient tool for counseling people with mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety. MacArthur does not reject all forms of psychological theories and techniques, though he considers some psychology and [[psychiatry]] as contrary to the Bible.<ref>{{Citation|author=Ganz and MacArthur|title=PsychoBabble: The Failure of Modern Psychology--and the Biblical Alternative|publisher=Crossway|year=1993}}</ref>\n\nHe has argued that \"True psychology (i.e. \"the study of the soul\") can be done only by Christians, since only Christians have the resources for understanding and transforming the soul. The secular discipline of psychology is based on godless assumptions and evolutionary foundations and is capable of dealing with people only superficially and only on the temporal level... Psychology is no more a science than the atheistic evolutionary theory upon which it is based. Like theistic evolution, [[Christian psychology]] is an attempt to harmonize two inherently contradictory systems of thought. Modern psychology and the Bible cannot be blended without serious compromise to or utter abandonment of the principle of Scripture's sufficiency.\"<ref>{{Citation|author=John F MacArthur|title=THE PSYCHOLOGY EPIDEMIC AND ITS CURE|journal=The Master's Seminary Journal|volume=2:1|year=1991|pages=3\u201320}}</ref>\n\nHis stance has caused several controversies, the most notable of which was the first time an employee of an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical church]] had ever been sued for malpractice.

MacArthur is very open about opposing same-sex marriage, against female pastors, and the social justice movement.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ix_eHfGYuA</ref> He has delivered multiple sermons where he discusses these issues.<ref name=\"gty.org\" />\n\nIn 2012, at The Shepherd's Conference, MacArthur was participating in a word association questionnaire where the moderator gave him the name \"[[Steven Furtick]].\" MacArthur proceeded to argue that Furtick, pastor of [[Elevation Church]], was \"unqualified\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Buttel |first1=Cameron |title=Unqualified, Not Unworthy |url=https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B160509/unqualified-not-unworthy |website=Grace To You |accessdate=25 November 2019 |date=9 May 2016}}</ref> Furtick responded to this comment in his 2016 book ''Unqualified: How God Uses Broken People to Do Big Things''. \n\nIn 2013, after the time of closing for the Annual Conference 'For His sake,' and hosted by pastor Miguel Nunez in the Dominican Republic, pastor MacArthur was asked by one of the attendants, What happens if a christian committed suicide? Does he  still go to heaven? replying MacArthur to this question in a positive way, and creating this an argument and disagreement by another attendant, the dominican, reformed Calvinist (TULIP) lead-pastor of Grace Bible Church in Santo Domingo Oriental, Willy Bayonet, who replied in the same time, and after this answer by MacArthur, that a supposed christian believer who takes his life is not a true christian. In 2018, and After five years trying to convince pastor John MacArthur and his followers and associates, pastor Willy Bayonet was ready to publish his book in Spanish 'La Nobleza de Dios: Vivir o Morir' ('The Nobility of God: Living or Dying' for the English title of the book which is still being translated into English) against MacArthur's teaching about Suicidals going to heaven or 'In Suicide, Against MacArthurion,' as the author Willy Bayonet, nicknamed it. Pastor Bayonet's book is centered on the classic reformed book by William Gurnall, 'The Christian in complete Armour,' the Confession of faith of London of 1689, several reformed authors from past centuries as pastor Spurgeon, Martyn Lloyd Jones, among others, and a few contemporary reformed authors, who he says never preached or taught about suicide. Pastor MacArthur also holds his position in his ministry 'Grace to You, and with written notes online, about those who he states \"Commit Suicide and still go to Heaven.\" When pastor Willy Bayonet is asked about what he expects from pastor John MacArthur, his answer is that pastor MacArthur should stay silent about suicidals' status, as it' has been done before.\n\nIn 2019, at the Truth Matters Conference, where, during a word association questionnaire, the name, \"Beth Moore\" was given. Reiterating his stance on 1 Timothy 2:12, MacArthur responded by stating that [[Beth Moore]] should, \"Go home\" and that, \"There is no case that can be made Biblically for a woman preacher. Period. Paragraph. End of Discussion.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=MacArthur |first1=John |title=Go Home Beth Moore |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeNKHqpBcgc&t=88s |website=YouTubw |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> Moore responded to this stance by stating on her Twitter account, \"I did not surrender to a calling of man when I was 18 years old. I surrendered to a calling of God. It never occurs to me for a second to not fulfill it. I will follow Jesus - and Jesus alone - all the way home. And I will see His beautiful face and proclaim, Worthy is the Lamb!\" Her response caused a lengthy discussion on social media and elsewhere on the inerrancy of Scripture and whether the Bible has changed in meaning since it was first written.\n\n==Selected publications==\n{{Main|John MacArthur bibliography}}\n\n*''Twelve Extraordinary Women: God Shaped Women of the Bible, and What He Wants to Do with You by John F.

MacArthur stated, \"''I'm not into all that is traditionally known as dispensationalism, seven dispensations, two kingdoms, two New Covenants, two ways of salvation, discontinuity between the Old Testament and the New.''\"<ref name=\"MacArthur, John\"/>\n\n=== [[Soteriology]] ===\nMacArthur was a key person in the [[Lordship salvation controversy]] in the 1980s, arguing against [[free grace theology]]. He states, \"You must receive Jesus Christ for who He is, both Lord and Savior, to be truly saved (II Peter 2:20).\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gospel According to Jesus |author=MacArthur, John |isbn=0-310-39491-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt00maca_0 }}</ref> Regarding [[eternal security]], he states, \"It should never be presented merely as a matter of being once saved, always saved\u2014with no regard for what you believe or do. The writer of Hebrews 12:14 states frankly that only those who continue living holy lives will enter the Lord's presence.\" MacArthur's views raised controversy within U.S. evangelicalism and were challenged in print by non-lordship dispensationalist theologians [[Charles Ryrie]] and [[Zane C. Hodges]], who argued that MacArthur was teaching a form of works-based salvation. MacArthur has denied the charge, as attested on two tapes recorded in 1989 when he was asked to reason together with the IFCA man.<ref>https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-37/ifca-meeting-62689-part-2 https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-36/ifca-meeting-62689-part-1</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, the [[Bible Broadcasting Network]] terminated MacArthur's ''Grace to You'' program. In explaining that step, BBN president Lowell Davey referred to MacArthur's teachings on the blood of Christ and \"Lordship salvation.\" Davey called these teachings \"confusing\". In a letter dated January 15, 1990, Davey cited a \"drift by Dr. MacArthur to a theological position that we could not adhere to\" and said that MacArthur's sermon series on the theology of election \"convinced us that the direction of 'Grace to You' was toward Hyper-Calvinism.\" MacArthur preaches salvation by election of God's sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chosen from Eternity: Chosen by God--Part 1 |author=MacArthur, John |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Sermons/60-2}}</ref> However, the term \"Hyper-Calvinism\" is used by some to denote 5-point Calvinism or even any strong defense of Calvinism, rather than the historical \"Hyper-Calvinism\" position denies the doctrine of duty faith. This position does not seem to accurately reflect MacArthur's position in his sermons. The controversy concerning the efficacy of Christ's blood stems from MacArthur's statement that it is not the literal liquid blood of Christ that saves, but his sacrificial death on [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], a view that he espoused in an article titled \"Not His Bleeding, but His Dying,\" published in the May 1976 issue of the ''Grace to You'' family paper distributed to his church. MacArthur himself, though, later clarified what was stated of him in the article, noting his position concerning Christ's blood and death in atonement, mentioning that the efficacy of Christ's blood is not some particular physical property of the blood itself, but the fact that He shed blood in dying, and his affirmation that Christ's blood in death was necessary to satisfy God's holy requirement for atonement.<ref>{{cite web |title=What's All the Controversy About John MacArthur and the Blood of Christ? |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205235106/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Christology ===\nIn 1983, MacArthur first published his belief in the doctrine of \"[[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational sonship]].\" In 1989, after some criticism, he defended his views in a plenary session of the annual convention of the [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]]. In an article on MacArthur's web site ''Grace to You'' entitled \"Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ,\" he retraces his views from 1983 onward, concluding, \"I want to state publicly that I have abandoned the doctrine of 'incarnational sonship.' Careful study and reflection have brought me to understand that Scripture does indeed present the relationship between God the Father and Christ the Son as an eternal Father-Son relationship. I no longer regard Christ's sonship as a role He assumed in His incarnation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ |author=MacArthur, John |publisher=Grace to You |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Articles/593}}</ref>{{original research inline |date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Cessationism ===\n[[Image:Charismatic Chaos.jpg|thumb|widthpx|''Charismatic Chaos'' - one of the books where MacArthur argues for cessationism.]]\nMacArthur is a [[cessationism|cessationist]] and is one of the most prominent voices in the church against the [[continuationism|continuationist]] beliefs of [[Pentecostalism]] and the [[Charismatic Movement]]. He has written three books in support of his position: ''The Charismatics'' (1978), ''Charismatic Chaos'' (1993), and ''Strange Fire: The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship'' (2013). In October 2013, he hosted a conference called \"Strange Fire\" at his church to mark the launch of his book of the same name. The event featured a number of speakers who argued for a cessationist theology and strongly critiqued the Charismatic Movement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menzie|first1=Nicola|title='Strange Fire' Conference: John MacArthur Calls Out Charismatic Movement as 'Unfaithful'|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/strange-fire-conference-john-macarthur-calls-out-charismatic-movement-as-unfaithful-106849/|website=The Christian Post|publisher=The Christian Post|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In his opening remarks, MacArthur stated, \"Watching the behavior of some Hindus who belong to the Kundalini cult. Their body movements are almost identical to that of people in the charismatic movement, the extreme behavior of pagans. This is the work of Satan, it is the work of darkness, and not to be attributed to the Holy Spirit\". And that, \"The Charismatic movement as such has made no contribution to biblical clarity, interpretation, or sound doctrine ... It detracts and confuses.\" \"It has only produced distortion, confusion, and error.\" \"Have people truly been saved in Charismatic churches? Yes. But nothing coming from that movement has been the reason they were saved.\" \"Evangelicalism has thrown its arms open and has welcomed the Trojan horse of the charismatic movement into the city of God.

However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being \"a testimony to the absence of any theology,\" and charged that \"its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement.\" He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that \"In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to [[Calvary Chapel]]..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be.

Addressing the \"Strange Fire\" conference, continuationist [[Calvinist Baptist]] [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] concurs that there are many abuses in the charismatic church, however he adds that \"we really need to keep in mind that every charismatic abuse has its mirror image in non-charismatic abuses...In some of these cases, the non-charismatic church is more guilty than the charismatic,\" such as, \"the absence of emotion, which is probably more deadly than the excesses.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Piper|first1=John|title=Piper Addresses Strange Fire and Charismatic Chaos|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/piper-addresses-strange-fire-and-charismatic-chaos|publisher=Desiring God|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Complementarianism ===\nMacArthur opposes \"male [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] views\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B100902|title=The Loving Husband: A Portrait of Christ|website=www.gty.org|access-date=April 10, 2017}}</ref> with a [[complementarian]] view on [[gender role]]s and considers that the Bible does not allow women to preach to men or exercise authority in churches.

Psychology is no more a science than the atheistic evolutionary theory upon which it is based.

Does he  still go to heaven? replying MacArthur to this question in a positive way, and creating this an argument and disagreement by another attendant, the dominican, reformed Calvinist (TULIP) lead-pastor of Grace Bible Church in Santo Domingo Oriental, Willy Bayonet, who replied in the same time, and after this answer by MacArthur, that a supposed christian believer who takes his life is not a true christian. In 2018, and After five years trying to convince pastor John MacArthur and his followers and associates, pastor Willy Bayonet was ready to publish his book in Spanish 'La Nobleza de Dios: Vivir o Morir' ('The Nobility of God: Living or Dying' for the English title of the book which is still being translated into English) against MacArthur's teaching about Suicidals going to heaven or 'In Suicide, Against MacArthurion,' as the author Willy Bayonet, nicknamed it. Pastor Bayonet's book is centered on the classic reformed book by William Gurnall, 'The Christian in complete Armour,' the Confession of faith of London of 1689, several reformed authors from past centuries as pastor Spurgeon, Martyn Lloyd Jones, among others, and a few contemporary reformed authors, who he says never preached or taught about suicide. Pastor MacArthur also holds his position in his ministry 'Grace to You, and with written notes online, about those who he states \"Commit Suicide and still go to Heaven.\" When pastor Willy Bayonet is asked about what he expects from pastor John MacArthur, his answer is that pastor MacArthur should stay silent about suicidals' status, as it' has been done before.\n\nIn 2019, at the Truth Matters Conference, where, during a word association questionnaire, the name, \"Beth Moore\" was given. Reiterating his stance on 1 Timothy 2:12, MacArthur responded by stating that [[Beth Moore]] should, \"Go home\" and that, \"There is no case that can be made Biblically for a woman preacher. Period. Paragraph. End of Discussion.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=MacArthur |first1=John |title=Go Home Beth Moore |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeNKHqpBcgc&t=88s |website=YouTubw |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> Beth Moore responded to this stance by stating on her Twitter account, \"I did not surrender to a calling of man when I was 18 years old. I surrendered to a calling of God. It never occurs to me for a second to not fulfill it. I will follow Jesus - and Jesus alone - all the way home. And I will see His beautiful face and proclaim, Worthy is the Lamb!\" Her response caused a lengthy discussion on social media and elsewhere on the inerrancy of Scripture and whether the Bible has changed in meaning since it was first written.\n\n==Selected publications==\n{{Main|John MacArthur bibliography}}\n\n*''Twelve Extraordinary Women: God Shaped Women of the Bible, and What He Wants to Do with You by John F.

His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"[[Love Is the Hero]]\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life (1950-1980) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as another story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\nHowever, Piper broke up soon after and Squier, the band's frontman, signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and started working on his solo debut ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'', which was released in spring 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and [[Mark Clarke]] (also known for his stints with [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFollowing a successful small summer tour with [[Alice Cooper]] in 1980, Squier got in contact with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] and proposed him to produce his next album. Due to scheduling conflicts, May declined, but he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]], who had produced Queen's most recent album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack joined forces to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which attracted rave reviews and spawned three hit singles, catapulting him to stardom. The first, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well as charting high in Canada and even in Britain, where the song remains his only chart entry. \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-ups. The album also featured \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", which became a radio favourite and one of his signature songs, despite not being released as a single (however, in Britain, it was featured as the b-side for \"In the Dark\"). Squier was also popular on the new MTV cable channel, where his straightforward performance received heavy rotation. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling over 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Retrospectively, ''Don't Say No'' is widely regarded as Squier's best solo album and one of the greatest rock albums of the 1980s.\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor. In the US, the album hit #5 and sold about 3 million copies. The sexually suggestive [[Emotions in Motion (Billy Squier song)|title track]] of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] members [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for six weeks straight. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 Hot Space Tour.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> That same year he recorded a song, \"Fast Times (The Best Years of Our Lives)\" for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. The next year, Squier led his own arena tour for the first time and was supported by English newcomer [[Def Leppard]]. He helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their breakthrough album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.\n\nSquier began recording his fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' in 1984. He had planned [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]] - the man behind Def Leppard's wildly successful ''Pyromania -'' to produce the album, but Lange was already reserved by [[The Cars]] and had suffered a breakdown, which prompted Squier to continue his search. He brought in [[Jim Steinman]], who was best known for his grandiose ballads and operatic rock n' roll songs, thus a rather odd choice for straightforward arena rocker like Squier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> When ''Signs of Life'' finally came in August 1984, Squier was at the peak of his success. The album brought him his third consecutive platinum certification. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]],\" reached #15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], hit the Top 10 of the [[Cash Box]] singles chart, and became his second #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. Despite the song being his highest-charting US single, its homoerotic video attracted negative responses from critics, fans and fellow musicians alike. It has been considered by many, including Squier himself, to be the reason for his subsequent downfall in popularity.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered soon after the video's world premiere and he stopped selling out shows, on some occasions even playing for half-empty stadiums. He fired both of his managers and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading and deceiving him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem to be a sellout.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Squier continued performing and released two more singles from ''Signs of Life'' later that same year: hard rocker \"All Night Long\" and more experimental \"Eye on You\", though with a little chart impact. In December, he appeared on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest, playing \"Rock Me Tonite\" and \"All Night Long\", which had became his fifth Top 10 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts in autumn and featured a performance-based music video, more typical of his style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-10/episode/7-ed-begley-jr-with-billy-squier-64776|title=SNL Season 10 Episode 07 - Ed Begley, Jr., Billy Squier - NBC.com|website=NBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/forget-rock-me-tonite--our-love-for-billy-squier-goes-all-night-long/2264984/|title=Forget 'Rock Me Tonite' ...

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is the Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold an estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. Squier chose not to embark on a tour since Capitol decided not to promote the album, which built strong tensions between him and the label.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' and is often regarded as one of the strongest inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"[[Don't Say You Love Me (Billy Squier song)|Don't Say You Love Me]]\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there and overall best-charting single since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album did briefly restore Squier's mainstream success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled All Excess was also well received. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return after the turn of the decade.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990s and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critical and audience reception were mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and some of its songs, such as his last Mainstream Rock entry \"Angry\" and fan favourite \"The Girl's All Right\" were later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He played a few dates in 1999 to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\", which was also included on the album as \"Stroke Me Blues\".\n=== Later career (1998-) ===\nAs time passed, Squier's albums went out of print, except for ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' and some greatest hits compilations; however, many of these would later be re-released.\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier embarked on\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \"James Cotton's Blues Summit\" at [[Lincoln Center]] in NYC, along with the legendary [[Pinetop Perkins]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] ([[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band), [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout! Factory released ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]: 30th Anniversary Edition'' on July 27, 2010, marking the first time that this album had been remastered in over 20 years. It was released in collaboration with Squier, who provided two live bonus cuts from his personal collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staticmultimedia.com/music/news/shout~_factory_re-issuing_concrete_blonde_~_billy_squier|title=Shout!

During Memorial Day weekend, Squier made a surprise appearance at the John Varvatos store in Easthampton, NY in support of his friend, rock photographer [[Rob Shanahan]] and his new book, \"Volume One.\" In June, Squier performed at the \"Industrial Hedgefund Awards Dinner\" in New York, in another fundraising effort for '[[Little Kids Rock]].' In September, Squier appeared as a guest during the set of the James Montgomery Band at the Westport Blues Festival. In December, Squier headlined a fund-raising concert for \"The American Revolution,\" a documentary on legendary rock FM station WBCN at the House Of Blues in Boston.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Squier performed his 'Electric Man' show at the Patchogue Music Festival on Long Island. In November, he played the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with [[Iggy Pop]]'s band), joined Squier on \"The Stroke.\" At the same time, [[Eminem]] released '[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]' which makes use of various samples from \"The Stroke.\" Later, on his 2014 effort, \"[[Shady XV]],\" he sampled \"[[My Kinda Lover]].\"\n\nIn September 2014, Squier took his 'Electric Man' show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, CA.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player. They divided their time between a home in [[Bridgehampton]], [[Long Island]] and an apartment in [[The San Remo]] on [[Central Park West]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]. Squier had been, as of 2016, an active volunteer for the [[Central Park Conservancy]] for more than 17 years, physically maintaining 20 acres (81,000 m2) of the park, as well as promoting the Conservancy in articles and interviews.

His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"[[Love Is the Hero]]\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life (1950-1980) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\nHowever, Piper broke up soon after and Squier, the band's frontman, signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and started working on his solo debut ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'', which was released in spring 1980. The album provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Along with Chouinard, his backing band consisted of Alan St. Jon on keyboards, Cary Sharaf on lead guitar and [[Mark Clarke]] (also known for his stints with [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]) on bass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFollowing a successful small summer tour with [[Alice Cooper]] in 1980, Squier got in contact with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] guitarist [[Brian May]] and proposed him to produce his next album. Due to scheduling conflicts, May declined, but he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]], who had produced Queen's most recent album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack joined forces to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which attracted rave reviews and spawned three hit singles, catapulting him to stardom. The first, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well as charting high in Canada and even in Britain, where the song remains his only chart entry. \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-ups. The album also featured \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", which became a radio favourite and one of his signature songs, despite not being released as a single (however, in Britain, it was featured as the b-side for \"In the Dark\"). Squier was also popular on the new MTV cable channel, where his straight-forward performance received heavy rotation. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling over 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Retrospectively, ''Don't Say No'' is widely regarded as Squier's best solo album and one of the greatest rock albums of the 1980s.\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor. In the US, the album hit #5 and sold about 3 million copies. The sexually suggestive [[Emotions in Motion (Billy Squier song)|title track]] of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] members [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for six weeks straight. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 Hot Space Tour.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> That same year he recorded a song, \"Fast Times (The Best Years of Our Lives)\" for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. The next year, Squier led his own arena tour for the first time and was supported by English newcomer [[Def Leppard]]. He helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their breakthrough album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.\n\nSquier began recording his fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' in 1984. He had planned [[Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange]] - the man behind Def Leppard's wildly successful ''Pyromania -'' to produce the album, but Lange was already reserved by [[The Cars]] and had suffered a breakdown, which prompted Squier to continue his search. He brought in [[Jim Steinman]], who was best known for his grandiose ballads and operatic rock n' roll songs, thus a rather odd choice for straight-forward arena rocker like Squier.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-10-12-ca-2715-story.html|title=SQUIER TRIES TO SHED AN IMAGE AS A VIDEO WIMP|date=1986-10-12|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> When ''Signs of Life'' finally came in August 1984, Squier was at the peak of his success. The album brought him his third consecutive platinum certification. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]],\" reached #15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], hit the Top 10 of the [[Cash Box]] singles chart, and became his second #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. Despite the song being his highest-charting US single, its homoerotic video attracted negative responses from critics, fans and fellow musicians alike. It has been considered by many, including Squier himself, to be the reason for his subsequent downfall in popularity.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered soon after the video's world premiere and he stopped selling out shows, on some occasions even playing for half-empty stadiums. He fired both of his managers and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading and deceiving him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem to be a sellout.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Squier continued performing and released two more singles from ''Signs of Life'' later that same year: hard rocker \"All Night Long\" and more experimental \"Eye on You\", though with a little chart impact. In December, he appeared on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest, playing \"Rock Me Tonite\" and \"All Night Long\", which had became his fifth Top 10 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts in autumn and featured a performance-based music video, more typical of his style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-10/episode/7-ed-begley-jr-with-billy-squier-64776|title=SNL Season 10 Episode 07 - Ed Begley, Jr., Billy Squier - NBC.com|website=NBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/forget-rock-me-tonite--our-love-for-billy-squier-goes-all-night-long/2264984/|title=Forget 'Rock Me Tonite' ...

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is the Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold an estimated 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. Squier chose not to embark on a tour since Capitol decided not to promote the album, which built strong tensions between him and the label.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989, after going through various delays. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]]'' and is often regarded as one of the strongest inputs of Squier's career by both fans and critics. It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"[[Don't Say You Love Me (Billy Squier song)|Don't Say You Love Me]]\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there and overall best-charting single since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album did briefly restore Squier's mainstream success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled All Excess was also well received. However, despite quite promising comeback chances, Squier wasn't able to pull off a notable return after the turn of the decade.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990s and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. Both critical and audience reception were mixed; many criticized the album for lacking innovation and being uninspired mainly on the songwriting side. Peaking only at #117 in US, the album became his lowest charting since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good. The album has subsequently spawned a strong cult reputation and some of its songs, such as his last Mainstream Rock entry \"Angry\" and fan favourite \"The Girl's All Right\" were later resurrected for Squier's future concert setlists.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He played a few dates in 1999 to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\", which was also included on the album as \"Stroke Me Blues\".\n=== Later career (1998-) ===\nAs time passed, Squier's albums went out of print, except for ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' and some greatest hits compilations; however, many of these would later be re-released.\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier embarked on\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J. Geils Band]]), the [[James Montgomery (singer)|James Montgomery Band]], [[Jon Butcher]], [[Sib Hashian]] ([[Boston (band)|Boston]]), [[Michael Carabello]] ([[Santana (band)|Santana]]), the Uptown Horns and James Cotton. Squier accepted Cotton's invitation in June to join him at the \"James Cotton's Blues Summit\" at [[Lincoln Center]] in NYC, along with the legendary [[Pinetop Perkins]], [[Hubert Sumlin]] ([[Howlin' Wolf]]'s band), [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and many more. In November, Squier appeared at the [[Iridium Jazz Club|Iridium]] in New York and played a double set that night, \"Blues Deluxe,\" that showcased songs from his blues upbringing and new versions of several of his hits.\n\nShout! Factory released ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]: 30th Anniversary Edition'' on July 27, 2010, marking the first time that this album had been remastered in over 20 years. It was released in collaboration with Squier, who provided two live bonus cuts from his personal collection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staticmultimedia.com/music/news/shout~_factory_re-issuing_concrete_blonde_~_billy_squier|title=Shout!

During Memorial Day weekend, Squier made a surprise appearance at the John Varvatos store in Easthampton, NY in support of his friend, rock photographer [[Rob Shanahan]] and his new book, \"Volume One.\" In June, Squier performed at the \"Industrial Hedgefund Awards Dinner\" in New York, in another fundraising effort for '[[Little Kids Rock]].' In September, Squier appeared as a guest during the set of the James Montgomery Band at the Westport Blues Festival. In December, Squier headlined a fund-raising concert for \"The American Revolution,\" a documentary on legendary rock FM station WBCN at the House Of Blues in Boston.\n\nIn the summer of 2013, Squier performed his 'Electric Man' show at the Patchogue Music Festival on Long Island. In November, he played the Voodoo Festival in New Orleans. The Stooges, a local brass band (not to be confused with [[Iggy Pop]]'s band), joined Squier on \"The Stroke.\" At the same time, [[Eminem]] released '[[Berzerk (song)|Berzerk]]' which makes use of various samples from \"The Stroke.\" Later, on his 2014 effort, \"[[Shady XV]],\" he sampled \"[[My Kinda Lover]].\"\n\nIn September 2014, Squier took his 'Electric Man' show to the 9th Jack Show in Anaheim, CA.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 2002, Squier married Nicole Schoen, a professional German soccer player.
